# SOUTHERNERS PROVE EASY FOR STANFORD
## Hartranft Throws 16 Pound Shot 50 Feet 11 1-2 Inches; Hale Runs Hundred in 9 9-10 
### Wallace Knox 
• itrriNY" Hartranft came within 1-2 inch of the world's record in the shot put
* Saturday when he landed the iron ball out 50 feet 11 1-2 inches, and insi
dentally helped the Stanford tracksters to snow the Southern Conference
under a 87 to 44 score.
The meet was also marked by the remarkable performance of Bill Kerr,
-who took first in the mile in 4:24 4-10. This is the best time Kerr has made
and in making it he was not pressed by any of the other runners.
Hale Wins Century
Marshal Hale entered the ranks of the less-than-10-fiat-sprinters when he
breasted the tape ahead of Cliff Argue, who was doped to win the event.
Hale's time was 0':09 9-10, the best time he has made this year.
"Dink has nothing to worry about in the high jump, as Fred Anderson won
the event "with a leap of 6 feet 1 inch, and Lou Kemnitzer followed close
behind with a height of 6 feet. The best that the stars from southern schools
could do was to tie Kemnitzer for second.
The only events in which the southerners lived up to expectations were
the two hurdle races. Maxwell of Pomona was in great shape and managed
to take both first places from Stanford's ace,, Swede Leistner. "Swede" has
not yet reached top form, but he does<§>

not need an alibi because of his loss '
to Maxwell, for the southerner is un
doubtedly the fastest hurdler in the
West.
Maxwell Takes First in Hurdles
Maxwell beat Leistner by a scant 15
inches in the high hurdles, and came
very near losing by default as he
knocked down two hurdles. In the low
sticks the Pomona had things a little
easier and led by a goodly margin
throughout the course of the event.
Good Time in Half
The 880-yard run was probably the
most interesting of the events. Charlie
Daly took the lead but soon surren
dered it to Bill Richardson. Richard
son led until the last three hundred
yards, followed closely by Mcintosh,
Daly, and Swayne. At the 300-yard
mark Swayne took the lead, but Rich
ardson at once uncorked the sprint
that should make him a winner in the
Big Meet and forged into the lead
again. Mcintosh passed Swayne on the
home stretch and placed second.
Miller Leads in 440
Powers, Oxy's crack quarter miler,
has a reputation for coming through
in competition, but he received a set
back in the person of Ted Miller.
Powers grabbed the pole and let until
the last 15 yards. Miller dogged his
steps throughout the early part of the
race and then slowly pulled up along
side. Powers quickened his pace but
could not shake off the Stanford run
ner. Then, inch by inch, Miller began
to forge ahead, being about two feet
to the good at the finish. Captain Van
Judah took a third.
Goodenough Wins vauit
Goodenough and Graham staged a
pretty battle for honors in the pole
vault. Dennis and Scofield dropped out
at 12 feet and left the southerners to
fight it out. Both of them cleaved 12
feet 6 and then Goodenough made 12
feet 9 on his next try. Graham missed
this mark, and on his second try his
pole broke. This shook him up so that
he could not get over the bar.
Dick Macßae and Bill Wright did
not have much trouble in beating
Frisgie, Pomona jumper, who was ex
pected to place first. Macßae did 22
feet 8 3-4, his best jump of the year,
while Wright was close behind with a
leap of 22 feet 6 inches.

The only events in which the southerners lived up to expectations were
the two hurdle races. Maxwell of Pomona was in great shape and managed

not yet reached top form, but he does<§>

not need an alibi because of his loss '
to Maxwell, for the southerner is un
doubtedly the fastest hurdler in the
West.
Maxwell Takes First in Hurdles
Maxwell beat Leistner by a scant 15
inches in the high hurdles, and came
very near losing by default as he
knocked down two hurdles. In the low
sticks the Pomona had things a little
easier and led by a goodly margin
throughout the course of the event.
Good Time in Half
The 880-yard run was probably the
most interesting of the events. Charlie
Daly took the lead but soon surren
dered it to Bill Richardson. Richard
son led until the last three hundred
yards, followed closely by Mcintosh,
Daly, and Swayne. At the 300-yard
mark Swayne took the lead, but Rich
ardson at once uncorked the sprint
that should make him a winner in the
Big Meet and forged into the lead
again. Mcintosh passed Swayne on the
home stretch and placed second.
Miller Leads in 440
Powers, Oxy's crack quarter miler,
has a reputation for coming through
in competition, but he received a set
back in the person of Ted Miller.
Powers grabbed the pole and let until
the last 15 yards. Miller dogged his
steps throughout the early part of the
race and then slowly pulled up along
side. Powers quickened his pace but
could not shake off the Stanford run
ner. Then, inch by inch, Miller began
to forge ahead, being about two feet
to the good at the finish. Captain Van
Judah took a third.
Goodenough Wins vauit
Goodenough and Graham staged a
pretty battle for honors in the pole
vault. Dennis and Scofield dropped out
at 12 feet and left the southerners to
fight it out. Both of them cleaved 12
feet 6 and then Goodenough made 12
feet 9 on his next try. Graham missed
this mark, and on his second try his
pole broke. This shook him up so that
he could not get over the bar.
Dick Macßae and Bill Wright did
not have much trouble in beating
Frisgie, Pomona jumper, who was ex
pected to place first. Macßae did 22
feet 8 3-4, his best jump of the year,
while Wright was close behind with a

Good Time in Half
The 880-yard run was probably the
most interesting of the events. Charlie
Daly took the lead but soon surren
dered it to Bill Richardson. Richard
son led until the last three hundred
yards, followed closely by Mcintosh,
Daly, and Swayne. At the 300-yard
mark Swayne took the lead, but Rich
ardson at once uncorked the sprint
that should make him a winner in the
Big Meet and forged into the lead
again. Mcintosh passed Swayne on the
home stretch and placed second.
Miller Leads in 440
Powers, Oxy's crack quarter miler,
has a reputation for coming through
in competition, but he received a set
back in the person of Ted Miller.
Powers grabbed the pole and let until
the last 15 yards. Miller dogged his
steps throughout the early part of the
race and then slowly pulled up along
side. Powers quickened his pace but
could not shake off the Stanford run
ner. Then, inch by inch, Miller began
to forge ahead, being about two feet
to the good at the finish. Captain Van
Judah took a third.
Goodenough Wins vauit
Goodenough and Graham staged a
pretty battle for honors in the pole
vault. Dennis and Scofield dropped out
at 12 feet and left the southerners to
fight it out. Both of them cleaved 12
feet 6 and then Goodenough made 12
feet 9 on his next try. Graham missed
this mark, and on his second try his
pole broke. This shook him up so that
he could not get over the bar.
Dick Macßae and Bill Wright did
not have much trouble in beating
Frisgie, Pomona jumper, who was ex
pected to place first. Macßae did 22
feet 8 3-4, his best jump of the year,
while Wright was close behind with a
