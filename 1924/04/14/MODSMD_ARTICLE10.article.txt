# BABES OVER WHELM CUBS IN TRACK
## FRESHMEN WIN FIRST BRUIN CINDERPATH VICTORY, 83 TO 47 First Year Men Defeat California In Third Major Sport; Hoffman Is High Point Man In Meet 
### Douglas Meservey 
STANFORD'S babe tracksters accomplished two feats Saturday when they
easily defeated the California yearlings, 83 1-4 to 47 3-4.
In the first place, a brace of freshman major-sport victories was increased
to a trio—the preceding two being football and basketball.
In the second place they broke an apparent tradition of eighteen years'
standing that a Cardinal freshman track team could not down a Bruin squad.
Fourteen consecutive Blue and Gold victories testify to the strength of this
tradition.
Twelve Card Firsts
Twelve out of fifteen first places with a majority of seconds and thirds
were chalked up by the Card freshmen. The usual "hidden stars" of Christie's
team failed to materialize.
No records were broken, on either track or field. Work, in the high jump,
after clearing the bar for 6 feet 2 inches and a first in the high jump,
attempted 6 feet 3 Inches but was unable to make it. The present frosh
record is 6 feet 2 7-8 inches held by Muller of California.
Hoffman of Stanford copped first honors in scoring for the day by taking
his usual firsts in the discus and shot and then playing the "dark horse" when

<B>he placed second in the javelin with a
heave of 162 feet. This latter event
was the only clean sweep of the day,
Shipkey and Anderson taking first and
1 third respectively.
Schwalb of California, a favorite in
1 the centnry and furlong, suffered up
sets in both races, Babcock, after lead
ing Adams in the furlong for 200 yards,
"tied up" and took second, leaving
third place to Schwalb. Adams also
tied with Schwalb in the 100 after the
latter had "broken" twice.
Distances Are Weak Spots
The distances, as predicted, were the
Cards' weak spots. California garnered
three firsts in the 880, mile, and two
mile, and Schwobeda finished strong
in the other two for firsts.
Spencer and West took first honors
in the low and high hurdles, respec
: tively, leaving Enos of California, who
was doped to give them a much harder
battle. The Bruin hurdler and Spencer
ran neck and neck in the lows until
the last hurdle when the lanky Card
made a final and winning spurt to the
tape. Spencer also took a first in the
440 after loafing for three-fourths of a
lap.
Firsts in All Field Evens
