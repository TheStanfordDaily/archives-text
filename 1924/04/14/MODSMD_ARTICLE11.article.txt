# YEARLING DIAMONDERS LOSE TO BRUIN NINE
## First Contest of Big Little Series Goes to Bruins By 5-4 Score 
### 
Poor base running and inability to hit
in the critical periods caused the Stan
ford yearling nine to drop its first game
of the big-little scries to the California
cubs by a score of 5 to 4 Saturday after
noon on the home lot.
Coach "Husky" Hunt's aggregation
apparently was not up to top form. Al
though the fielding was good on the
whole, and the batting was on a par
with the California frosh, the babes
lacked the necessary punch in the
pinches.
California Scores First.
The cubs drew first blood in the third
inning. Clvmer led off with a long
drive into center field but the ball went
high and David grabbed it for the first
out. Watson secured a walk and Robie
followed with a single over the third
i sack.
Both runners advanced a base when
a long throw from left field by Stewart
i got by the second baseman. Wilson
flyed out on the next play. Rohwer
came to the rescue with a long drive
into left field for two bases, scoring
both Watson and Robie. Caldwell and
Nauman both came through for singles
scoring Rohwer, but dying on bases
themselves when Maul struck three
times at the air for the third out.
After making two strong bids for
runs in the first and second frame the
Cardinal yearlings started the third
with a hungry look in their eyes. Lin
quist started the action when he led off
with a long drive to the left field fence
for two sacks.
David made the first out on the next
play in a sacrifice hit to second base
advancing Linquist to third. South
worth reached first on an overthrow
from short and stole second on the next
pitched ball.
Mackersie then dropped a Texas
leaguer into center scoring both Lin
quist and Southworth. Bill Stewart
flyed out to pitcher, and a minute later
Southworth was put out on an attempt
to steal second.
The Stanford frosh drew blood again
in the fifth inning when Southworth hit
a single followed by Machersie's hot
grounded to left field for two bases.
Southworth scored and Mackersie ad
vanced to third on the throw-in, but he
died on this corner when Bill Setwart
made the third out with a short crack
to second.
The most disheartening inning came
during the seventh when Morrill started
the batting order with a three-base hit,
and died on that bag after Linquist,
David, and Southworth had made three
straight outs.
Bruins Score Twice in Eighth.
The California frosh made two more
runs in the eighth inning when Cald
well made a double, followed by a single
by Nauman. With two outs and two
men on bases Clymer hit for three sacks
just inside the first baseline, scoring
his two teammates.
With the score 5-3 in favor of the
cubs, Coach Hunt's proteges made a
valiant effort to overcome this lead in
the last part of the ninth inning. Cap
tain Gerald Stewart started with a walk.
Osthaus advanced Stewart with a sac
rifice hit to pitcher. Riese was substi
tuted as a pinch hitter for Morrill and
made first base when the shortstop
erred, but he was put out on the next
second. Stewart who had advanced to
pitched ball when he attempted to steal
third scored on this play. Linquist
ended the game when he flied out to
third.
Mackersie Is Star
Mackersie was the individual star of
the game, making a two-base hit and
two singles in four times to bat, besides
playing a perfect game at first base.
Following is the lineup for Saturday's
game: G. Stewart, If; Osthaus, rf;
Morrill, 3b; Linquist, 2b; David, cf;
Southworth, ss; Mackersie, lb; Stew
art, c. and Collins, p. Substitutes:
