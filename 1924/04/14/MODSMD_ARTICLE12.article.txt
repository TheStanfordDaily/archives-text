Stan forcl freshman debaters will
their annual forensic clash with Cali
fornia at 8 o'clock in the Little
Theater.
Theodore Baer, Lloyd Sullivan, and
Raymond Bruce will argue the affirma
tive side of the question ''American
Rccignition for Russia."
Simultaneously with the debate here
Harold Peterson, Craven Scott, and
Rex Kramer of Stanford will endeavor
to prove the negative against the Col
lege of Pacific at San Jose.
Both teams have been working on
the debate since the middle of last quar
ter and hope to emulate the freshman
arguers of last year by annexing a dou
ble victory.
Babe Debaters Do Good Work.
According to Bert Levit, varsity de
bater, who is coaching the orators, the
1927 men rank with the best first-year
speakers Stanford has ever had. He
accords the affirmative team especially
good chances for turning in a win.
Bruce held the interscholastic debating
championship of Arizona while in high
school. Both Baer and Sullivan have
had extensive prep school forensic ex
perience. All of the negative speakers
have also debated in previous years.
Members of the faculty will officiate
as judges. Professor Lee Bassett of the
English department will preside.
