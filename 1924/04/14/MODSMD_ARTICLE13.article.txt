California defeated the freshman ten
nis team by a score of 4 to 1 Saturday
morning.
Captain Cranston Holman won the
only match of the day for the Cardinal
in the first singles, 6-2, 6-3, playing ex
cellent tennis that was more like ver
sity than freshman work. His oppo
nent. Stow, played well but turned his
ankle early in the second set. and was
bothered by it during the rest of the
afternoon.
Gardner Loses to Petty %
Gardner lost to Petty 6-1, having
the same misfortune a* Stow, but in this
case the accident occurred at the very
beginning of the match. It was serious
enough to keep him from covering the
court as he should have done, fnaking
the match a very one-sided affaffir,
Kurihara, who was expected to star,
played a fine game for the first twef
sets, which he split with Wise 6-8,
and the score in the last set was 4-4,
when he became ill and lost the next
two games. This was one of the
matches that was regarded as a sure
thing for Stanford and Kurihara's ill
ness cost not only his singles but also
the first doubles.
Stow-Petty Strong Combination.
Holman and Kurihara were counted
on to win in the doubles, but ran into
an exceedingly strong combination in
Stow and Petty. These two played re
markably well, and it is doubtful
whether Stanford could have taken the
match, even with Kurihara at his best.
The score was 6-3, 7-5.
The second doubles was the poorest
event of the day, Wise and Stearns de
feating Gardner and Bacr, 6-4, 6-0, with
only mediocre playing. Both sides were
handicapped by a lack of experience.
While injuries had no little part in
deciding the day, Stanford has no right
to hide behind them as an alibi. With
the exception of Cranston Holman, the
team was outplayed in almost every set.
