### 
Stanford supporters are singing the praises of "Dink" Tenipleton.
Last Saturday was a great day for the youngest track coach in the United
States.
While his vatsity was decisively defeating the powerful All Southern
Conference team, his freshmen were breaking all precedents by soundly
trouncing the California yearlings. It was the first track victory a Stan
ford freshman team ever won over its trans-bay rival.
The yearlings proved conclusively that they will offer some excellent
material for future varsities. The varsity proved that Walter Christie
and his Bruins are going to have a rough time of it on April 26.
While some of the men who came through with such excellent perform
ances Saturday have always been good athletes, several of them have been
developed by "Dinl<." Notable among these is "Tiny" Hartranft, who
came within one-half an inch of the world's record in the shot put.
Templeton's proteges will be heard from again before the year is
over. Not only should they establish a great reputation on April 26, but
they should also cut quite a figure in the 1. C. A. A. A. A. meet.
