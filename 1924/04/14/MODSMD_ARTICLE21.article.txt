How do you play catch-as-catch-can water polo?
Ansivcrcd by "Splash" Gargle, K.C.8., coach of the Spit and Splutter Athletic
Club. Author of "20j000 Leagues Under the Sea," "Personal Fouls and Hoiv to
Make Them," etc.
In order to play water polo it is necessary to have some water and a polo.
The first is fairly easy to get in this country even though it is five years after
the event of prohibition. But to get a polo is a different matter. The best
way is to get a polo-coat, or a polo-pony, and then extract the polo. The game
is played by Jonah and 14 whales, the referee being the Jonah.
The two essential things necessary for the player and the referee are breath
—and more breath. The players need it for boxing, wrestling, and a little
swimming, and the referee needs it to blow his whistle. When a player is
sunk it is one point for the opposition; when the whole team is scuttled the
game is won.
