# DURAND COMPLETES MODEL AEROPLANE FOR U. S. RESEARCH
## 
### 
Dr. W. F. Durand, nationally known
engineer and head of the Mechanical
Engineering department here, has just
completed model aeroplane which
will be used in research work for the
United States Government, in connec
tion with both the army and the navy.
Tests are to be made of the effect of
various objects on propellor efficiency.
The model was built in the pattern
shop by E. J. Stanley. It is about six
feet in length, and is one-third the
actual size of an aeroplane. Everything
on an ordinary aeroplane has been put
on this model, even to the pilot and
observor, which also have been re
duced proportionately..
The wind tunnels have been built
in the aero laboratory, through which
air is drawn by propellors, affecting
the model the same as actual flight.
One of the tunnels is honey-combed
in order to draw the air straight in.
The wind speed that this station is
capable of obtaining is 80 miles an
hour; the Italian government has just
completed one in which a wind speed
of 300 miles an hour has been claimed
to be obtained.
