# LARGE CHORUS TO BE ASSEMBLED FOR "ELIJAH" PRODUCTION
## 
### 
Ihe largest chorus ever organized
here is being assembled for a perform
ance of "Elijah.'' The performance
may take place in the Stadium, with the
support of the San Francisco Sym
phony Orchestra and a quartet of dis
tinguished soloists, if present plans
materialize, Mr. Louis Graveure will be
engaged for the principal role.
To give an adequate choral presenta
tion of Mendelssohn's masterpiece, it
will be necessary to have at least three
hundred voices. Every member of the
chorus will be expected to attend two
rehearsals weekly in order to learn the
music thoroughly in the two months
remaining.
One hundred singers attended Thurs
day's rehearsal, but the quota for Palo
Alto and vicinity is one hundred and
fifty. One hundred voices under the
direction of Dean Dennis will come
from the College of the Pacific, and
enough additional voices from San Jose
and Santa Clara county at large to
complete the total of three hundred.
It is possible that this number may be
augmented still further by accessions
from the peninsula and San Francisco.
All singers in the Palo Alto-Stan
ford community are urged to enroll,
whether or not they have participated
in previous choral productions at the
university. All members of the Morris
Club, Glee Club, Schubert Club, all fac
ulty people and members of their fam
ilies who sing, all singers who have
been or are connected with the choirs
of the town, all persons who have ever
had or wish to have choral experience,
all, in short, who can sing even a little
and can attend the following schedule
of rehearsals are urged to participate.

For sopranos and altos—Tuesdays at
7:30 p. m. in Room 84, inner quad
rangle.

Ihe largest chorus ever organized
here is being assembled for a perform
ance of "Elijah.'' The performance
may take place in the Stadium, with the
support of the San Francisco Sym
phony Orchestra and a quartet of dis
tinguished soloists, if present plans
materialize, Mr. Louis Graveure will be
engaged for the principal role.
To give an adequate choral presenta
tion of Mendelssohn's masterpiece, it
will be necessary to have at least three
hundred voices. Every member of the
chorus will be expected to attend two
rehearsals weekly in order to learn the
music thoroughly in the two months
remaining.
One hundred singers attended Thurs
day's rehearsal, but the quota for Palo
Alto and vicinity is one hundred and
fifty. One hundred voices under the
direction of Dean Dennis will come
from the College of the Pacific, and
enough additional voices from San Jose
and Santa Clara county at large to
complete the total of three hundred.
It is possible that this number may be
augmented still further by accessions
from the peninsula and San Francisco.
