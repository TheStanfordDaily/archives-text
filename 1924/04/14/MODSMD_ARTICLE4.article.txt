# SEQUOIA, LOS ARCOS, AND DELTA CHI WIN INTRAMURAL GAMES
## 
### 
Sequoia First loomed as a possible in
tramural baseball league winner Friday
when El Toro was taken down the line
to the tune of 25 to 4. In other games
the Los Arcos downed Alpha Sigma
Phi, 12 to 0, and Delta Chi defeated Phi
Gamma Delta, 6 to 1.
Sequoia's heavy hitters got into action
early against Licking, El Toro pitcher,
hammering three circuit clouts in the
opening frame. Two more in the course
of the fray brought the total to five.
Thompson led the list, belting the apple
over the fence twice. Chedister, Prior,
and Cooper for through
tickets.
Prior hurled four innings for the win
ners and Chedister the other two. Be
tween them they allowed four hits.
Several that might have been hits were
turned into outs by good fielding.
Los Arcos Wins.
Morrison, chucking for Los Arcos,
struck out eleven men in witewashing
Alpha Sigma Phi, 12 to 0. Campbell,
who started the game for the losers,
was wild as the proverbial March hare,
walking four in succession in the sec
ond. Hi' was jerked in the third in
favor of McCook, who held Los Arcos
to four hits, with no counters.
The Uelta Chi-Phi Gamma Delta
game \\,is marked by little ragged play
ing. Each team made a run in the
first, and the resulting tie was not
broken until the fourth, when Reticker
slid across the plate, putting Delta Chi
in the lead. A run by Coplen in the
fifth increased the lead to two, and in
the seventh, Delta Chi cinched things
when three men passed the pay-off sta
tion.
Reticker pitched a good game for
Delta Chi, letting four hits. Grace, for
the Phi Gamma Delta was going all
right until lie weakened in the seventh.
Tomorrow's games: Sequoia Second
vs. Encina First; Sigma Alpha Epsilon
vs. Phi Sigma Kappa; Phi Delta Theta
vs. Encina Second; Theta Chi vs. Alpha
Kappa Lambda.
