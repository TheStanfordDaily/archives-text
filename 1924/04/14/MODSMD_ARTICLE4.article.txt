# SEQUOIA, LOS ARCOS, AND DELTA CHI WIN INTRAMURAL GAMES
## 
### 
Sequoia First loomed as a possible in
tramural baseball league winner Friday
when El Toro was taken down the line
to the tune of 25 to 4. In other games
the Los Arcos downed Alpha Sigma
Phi, 12 to 0, and Delta Chi defeated Phi
Gamma Delta, 6 to 1.
Sequoia's heavy hitters got into action
early against Licking, El Toro pitcher,
hammering three circuit clouts in the
opening frame. Two more in the course
of the fray brought the total to five.
Thompson led the list, belting the apple
over the fence twice. Chedister, Prior,
and Cooper for through
tickets.
Prior hurled four innings for the win
ners and Chedister the other two. Be
tween them they allowed four hits.
Several that might have been hits were
turned into outs by good fielding.
Los Arcos Wins.
Morrison, chucking for Los Arcos,
struck out eleven men in witewashing
Alpha Sigma Phi, 12 to 0. Campbell,
who started the game for the losers,
was wild as the proverbial March hare,
walking four in succession in the sec
ond. Hi' was jerked in the third in
favor of McCook, who held Los Arcos
to four hits, with no counters.
The Uelta Chi-Phi Gamma Delta
game \\,is marked by little ragged play
