### 
Southern Branch boxers were a lit
tle too much for Stanford's team and
the Grizzlies took the measure of the
Cards 4 to 3 in the Southern Branch
gym in Los Angeles Saturday night.
The varsity returned to the campus
late last night and is ready to enter
the University championship bouts
whibh will be held in Encina gym
Wednesday night.

in the three Stanford victories, Mar
tin's man going out for the count of
ten in the first round. This is the
third consecutive knockout for Martin.
Hall and Robinson nearly succeeded in
dealing out the sleeping potions to the
Branch boxers, but good condition pre
vented.
Irwin Loses to Wood
Sid Wood, Grizzlie lightheavy,
trained down to the middleweight
class and took on Captain "Jake" Ir
win in the first bout of the evening.
After the first round there was no
question as to who would win, and
Irwin had to keep stepping to avoid
the well-directed blows of the south
ern fighter. "Jake" was the man to
stay three rounds with Wood this year
and his grit and persistent smile
caused much comment. The Branch
flash boxed in both lightheavy and
heavyweight classes against California
and won three interclass bouts in Los
Angeles competition.
Armbruster started into his lighter
opponent in the first round but his
right went wild and he failed to con
nect with a single solid smash in the
whole three rounds. The Branch fighter
got in a few good whacks, but nothing
that would have won the fight for him
had not Armbruster failed to take the
offense. The southern boxer outclassed
the Stanford featherweight.
"Ike" Harward tore into his man,
Frost, in the welterweight scrap and
seemed on the verge of giving him '
the kayo in each round with straight j
jabs with his left and pretty crossing
with his right. Frost landed a few
good wallops but nothing to phase
Harward who held his man at arm's
length most of the time. At the end of
three rounds, a draw was declared by
the referee. Harward appeared to have
the edge in the deciding round, but the
fight was given to Frost. This was
declared to be the best fight of the
evening.
Hall managed his man with little
difficulty and had he not been so hard
to hit would have sent him to the mfat.
Straight lefts with a few solid blows
from a strong right were enough to
put Cassion, the sout'aern welter, on
the defense.
Martin was nearly rushed off his
feet in the first few seconds of his
bout with Benny Goodman, but the
Stanford welter recovered and, with
a lew well-directed blows on Good
man's chin, soon ended the fight.
Sid Wood appeared in the ring
again, this time in the light-heavy
j weight class against Stewart Van
Hook. The Grizzlie boxer gave all he
: had but Van Hook stayed with him
and the first round was nearly even.
Wood tore into Van Hook in the sec
ond. A good left which the Card boxer
lacked was sufficient to win the fight
for Wood and had it not been for Van
Hook's in-fighting the bout would have
been even more one-sided.
Robinson had little trouble with
Sergis who was still suffering from a
black eye received from Wood in the
interclass bouts the previous week.
The fight went three rounds but it
I was due to Sergis' ability to cover and
his failure to take the offense that he
fared no worse.

Irwin Loses to Wood
Sid Wood, Grizzlie lightheavy,
trained down to the middleweight
class and took on Captain "Jake" Ir
win in the first bout of the evening.
After the first round there was no
question as to who would win, and
Irwin had to keep stepping to avoid
the well-directed blows of the south
ern fighter. "Jake" was the man to
stay three rounds with Wood this year
and his grit and persistent smile
caused much comment. The Branch
flash boxed in both lightheavy and
heavyweight classes against California
and won three interclass bouts in Los
Angeles competition.
Armbruster started into his lighter
opponent in the first round but his
right went wild and he failed to con
nect with a single solid smash in the
whole three rounds. The Branch fighter
got in a few good whacks, but nothing
that would have won the fight for him
had not Armbruster failed to take the
offense. The southern boxer outclassed
the Stanford featherweight.
"Ike" Harward tore into his man,
Frost, in the welterweight scrap and
seemed on the verge of giving him '
the kayo in each round with straight j
jabs with his left and pretty crossing
with his right. Frost landed a few
good wallops but nothing to phase
Harward who held his man at arm's
length most of the time. At the end of
three rounds, a draw was declared by
the referee. Harward appeared to have
the edge in the deciding round, but the
fight was given to Frost. This was
declared to be the best fight of the
evening.
Hall managed his man with little
difficulty and had he not been so hard
to hit would have sent him to the mfat.
Straight lefts with a few solid blows
from a strong right were enough to
put Cassion, the sout'aern welter, on
the defense.
Martin was nearly rushed off his
feet in the first few seconds of his
bout with Benny Goodman, but the
Stanford welter recovered and, with
a lew well-directed blows on Good
man's chin, soon ended the fight.
Sid Wood appeared in the ring
again, this time in the light-heavy
j weight class against Stewart Van
Hook. The Grizzlie boxer gave all he
: had but Van Hook stayed with him
and the first round was nearly even.
Wood tore into Van Hook in the sec
ond. A good left which the Card boxer
lacked was sufficient to win the fight
for Wood and had it not been for Van
Hook's in-fighting the bout would have
been even more one-sided.
Robinson had little trouble with
Sergis who was still suffering from a
black eye received from Wood in the
interclass bouts the previous week.
The fight went three rounds but it
I was due to Sergis' ability to cover and
his failure to take the offense that he
fared no worse.
Southern Branch boxers were a lit
tle too much for Stanford's team and
the Grizzlies took the measure of the
Cards 4 to 3 in the Southern Branch
gym in Los Angeles Saturday night.
The varsity returned to the campus

the University championship bouts
