# LILLIAN F. BIDWELL CHOSEN ASSOCIATE EDITOR 1925 QUAD
## 
### 
Lillian F. Bidvvell was yesterday ap
pointed associate editor of the 1925
Quad. She is the first woman to hold
the position, and will serve for the re
mainder of the present year.
The position was created last fall for
the purpose of providing a place which
would regularly be tilled by a woman
through appointment by the tryout board
at the end of each year. In this way it
was hoped to provide a definite goal for
the women entered in the Quad tryouts.
When the position was created it was
not intended that it should be tilled until
the regular selection was made for next
year. The excellence of Miss Bidwcll's
work, however, induced the Quad man
agement to make the first appointment
at this time.
M iss Bidwell is a member of Koble
Club.
