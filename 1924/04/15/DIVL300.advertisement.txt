Easter Shoes
Not merely because it's "right" should you
wear the correct shoes for each occasion—but
also because of Comfort, Service, and Price.
Moreover it will add Joy to Living to feel that
you are correctly attired.
In our EASTER display each style phase is
shown —in some cases developed in several
colors and shades. Here are modes to har
monize with the costume of those who wish to
appear most correctly dressed on Easter morn

and priced at $10 —the other a more dressy
style with a comfortable Spanish heel —priced

New shades and tints in Easter osiery at
