# CARDINAL FOOTBALL SQUAD HAS CAPABLE ARRAY OF CENTERS
## 
### 
Stanford's 1924 football varsity will i
be well fortified with centers. Two vet
erans and two youngsters make this an
assured fact.
When Dud DeGroot graduated a year
ago. he left a gapping hole in the middle
of the line that was hard to fill. DeGroot
was not only captain of the team his last j
year, but was all-coast center, so he was i
but rarely substituted for.
George Baker stepped into the hole!
last year, and made good. Without;
much previous varsity experience, and j
in spite of his light weight, Baker con-1
ducted himself like a veteran. He is |
fighting every minute of the game, but
still keeps his head cool and never con
fuses a signal, a fault of most inexperi
enced centers.
Baker was the target of a lot of mis-;
directed criticism last year, on account [
of the end-over-end pass which Coach i
| Warner is introducing to Pacific Coast j
intercollegiate football. Many critics!
blamed block punts to this source. How- |
j ever, actual facts show that this type I
of pass from center is as fast as the
i spiral pass and is much easier for the i
! backfield to handle.
As an understudy to Baker last sea- 1
I son, Boh Hunt, center on the 1926 fresh- j
i man outfit, saw plenty of action. Hunt I
has every advantage in weight and speed
and with more experience should fill
Baker's shoes at the close of next season.
Hunt has learned the Warner system of j
passing now, and should play in most;
of the games next fall.
In addition to liis duties at center, j
Hunt is an excellent kick-off man. He j
is a dead sure tackier, rarely missing a
man, and usually Mocking all attempts
to gain through the center of the line'
jon the part of the opponents. He is also j
j valuable for tearing holes in the line j
I for his own hacks.

| centers who have shown great promise.!

I Price undoubtedly surpasses him on the j
! offensive side. Working them alter- i

great advantage. I

Baker was the target of a lot of mis-;
directed criticism last year, on account [
of the end-over-end pass which Coach i
| Warner is introducing to Pacific Coast j
intercollegiate football. Many critics!
blamed block punts to this source. How- |
j ever, actual facts show that this type I
of pass from center is as fast as the
i spiral pass and is much easier for the i
! backfield to handle.
As an understudy to Baker last sea- 1
I son, Boh Hunt, center on the 1926 fresh- j
i man outfit, saw plenty of action. Hunt I
has every advantage in weight and speed
and with more experience should fill
Baker's shoes at the close of next season.
Hunt has learned the Warner system of j
passing now, and should play in most;
of the games next fall.
In addition to liis duties at center, j
Hunt is an excellent kick-off man. He j
is a dead sure tackier, rarely missing a
man, and usually Mocking all attempts
to gain through the center of the line'
jon the part of the opponents. He is also j
j valuable for tearing holes in the line j
I for his own hacks.
Price and Natchcr arc two freshmen

i Natchcr is what is termed as a defen-1

J sive center, this being his best depart-1

I Price undoubtedly surpasses him on the j
! offensive side. Working them alter- i
natcly, Coach Hunt utilized this fact to i
great advantage. I
Stanford's 1924 football varsity will i
be well fortified with centers. Two vet
erans and two youngsters make this an
assured fact.
When Dud DeGroot graduated a year
ago. he left a gapping hole in the middle
of the line that was hard to fill. DeGroot
was not only captain of the team his last j
year, but was all-coast center, so he was i
but rarely substituted for.
George Baker stepped into the hole!
last year, and made good. Without;
much previous varsity experience, and j
in spite of his light weight, Baker con-1
ducted himself like a veteran. He is |
fighting every minute of the game, but
still keeps his head cool and never con
fuses a signal, a fault of most inexperi
enced centers.
