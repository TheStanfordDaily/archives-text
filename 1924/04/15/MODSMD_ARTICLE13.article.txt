# SECOND INTRAMURAL BOUND HARD-FOUGHT
## El Campo Downs Phi Kappa Psi in One of Closest Games of Season 
### 
Two close games marked the open
ing of the second round intramural
baseball contests yesterday. El Campo,
downed Phi Kappa Psi, 11 to 10', and
Sigma Chi nosed out Zeta Psi, 7 to 6.
Other results: Alpha Delta Phi won
from Delta Kappa Epsilon, 19 to 10,
and Sigma Nu defeated Kappa Sigma,
20 to 15.
The Sigma Chi-Zeta Psi contest most j
nearly resembled a real baseball game.
Campbell, Sigma Chi chucker, had an j
edge on Crimmins, hurling for the |
Zetes. Campbell struck out 14 men to I
Crimmins' 10, and also allowed fewer I
hits. The game was tied at the end !
of the sixth. In the seventh the Zetes I
made two runs, Finley punching a j
through ticket. Sigma Chi, after two j
men were out, started a batting rally
that won them the game.
El Campo Game Close
score of the El Campo-Phi Psi
contest was tied three times. Phi Psi i
took the lead with four counters in 1
the first two rounds, El Campo draw- J
ing a goose-egg. Then in the fourth, j
the clubmen rallied and evened things. !
In the fifth the Phi Psi's broke away i
for a two-run lead, which was evened !
in the sixth. Again the Phi Psi's cut j
loose, pushing four men across the j
plate in the last frame. But El Campo j
was equal to the occasion, and the lie- !
cessary five men cashed in before a !
single out had been made. Both hurl
ers, Bumbaugh for Phi Psi and Smith
for El Campo, pitched good games, but
both weakened in the final round.
Alpha Delta Phi clouted three
homers in winning from the Dekes,
Huneke, Jayred, and Charles wielding
the wicked willow. Catching the habit,
Ackley belted one for the Dekes. Sev
eral shut-out frames were played, but
when the men connected it was usually
for doubles or triples.
Sigma Nu's heavy hitters got into
action again yesterday, this time
against Kappa Sigma. Charlie Deffe
bach, ex-varsity player, hurled for
Kappa Sigma, but he could not pre
vent Sigma Nu from batting around
on two different occasions.
Aydelott, Sigma Nu twirler, took
things easy after getting a comfort
able lead, and the Kappa Sigma score
mounted into two figures also.
Tomorrow's games: El Tigre vs.
Delta Upsilon; Kappa Alpha vs. Los
Arcos; Encina Third vs. Sequoia First;
Alpha Sigma Phi vs. Phi Gamma Delta.
