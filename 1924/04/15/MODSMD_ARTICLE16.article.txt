### Douglas Meservey 
Ten gold medals are up for compe
tition tomorrow night when varsity
and non-varsity boxers meet in the
annual University championships in
Encina gym at 7:30. Only a small
number of entries outside of the var
sity men have been made as yet, al
though all regularly enrolled students
in the University are eligible.
The varsity and freshman stars who
have been working out all year will
be seen in action and some new ma
terial for next year's team or for the
Olympic Games tryouts may possibly
be uncovered.
The classes are:
Bantamweight—l2o pounds and under.
Featherweight—l2o to 129.
Lightweight—l 29 to 137.
Junior welterweight—l 37 to 145.
Senior welterweight—l4s to 150.
Junior middleweight—lso to 156.
Senior middleweight—ls6 to 162.
Junior lightheavyweight—l62 to 170.
Senior lightheavyweight—l7o to 178.
Heavyweight—over 17S. pounds.
Freeman and Simmons should be
about even in the bantamweight class,
both having had only a little varsity
experience. Freeman was ineligible for
competition this year and Simmons
lost his only bout of the year to Mihle,
of Davis Farm,
Armbruster is the varsity man in
the featherweight division and should
easily defeat Miron unless he finds un
expected opposition.
In the lightweight clas, Harward, a
varsity boxer, lias the edge over Gold
water, although the latter is a fast
little fighter.
McCallister, Stanford, and Hall are
the entries for the senior welterweight
class. McCallister has won once over
Stanford but Hall has the edge over
the others due to his two varsity vic
tories this season. He won his bout
in the Davis Farm meet early in the
season and copped in Los Angeles last
