# PHILOSOPHY OF LIFE ESSENTIAL TO WORLD SAYS S. M. CROTHERS
## People Seek Peace in Past as Life Becomes More Complicated 
### 
"We all need a philosophy of life
which will meet the present world in
terms of wisdom and religion," stated
Dr. Samuel McChord Crothers of the
First Parish, Cambridge, Massachu
setts, in the Memorial Church yester
day morning. His sermon centered
around wisdom, and its application to
a changing world.
As life becomes more complicated,
people turn away from it, and seek
peace in the past. According to Dr.
Crothers, we must find our simplicity
in what we are seeking, by intellectual
and religious discipline. We must have
men and women who can deal with
this changing life, healthfully, honest
ly, and happily, and in order to do this,
they must know what wisdom and
understanding stand for.
"We can use our minds in analysis,
and study of some thing; highly spe
cialized intelligence has made all the
discoveries of the world, But this is
only half of what makes a citizen. He
must be able to shut out all other ele
ments, turn his mind the other way,
and feel a certain union," asserted Dr.
Crothers.
Educated Discriminate
"Education teaches us to discrimi
nate; if education only makes us criti
cize, it puts us out of relation with
the world which needs us, and of
which we are part," in his estimation.
Being right, and believing in righteous
ness are two different things, as are
being right, and watching the follies
of others without taking a responsi
bility in their folly.
"What we need," continued Dr. Cro
thers, "is an idealism based on realism,
we must see the facts first, then deal
with them ideally, as idealists."
