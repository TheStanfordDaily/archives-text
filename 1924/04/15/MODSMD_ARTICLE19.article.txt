The Class of 1925 has announced that but 250 tickets will be sold for
the Junior Prom this year. It is to be hoped that the juniors will stick to
their decision. With the new bleachers installed, the dancing space has
been cut down to a greater extent than had been expected.
Evidently the Class of 1925 learned a lesson from last year's Prom.
Five hundred couples danced last year, and an otherwise brilliant party
was somewhat ruined. The dancing space was a little over-estimated,
and there is grave danger of a repitition of the trouble if the juniors do
not maintain their position this year.
The Junior Prom is generally one of the most enjoyable social events
of the year. It is a shame to lose sight of this fact in the struggle to make
it a paying proposition. At the Military Ball, two weeks ago, in the neigh
borhood of 250 couples danced. The Pavilion was just comfortably
crowded. Three hundred couples—six hundred people would fill the hall
to its utmost capacity.
The Class of 1925 is to be congratulated upon its determination to
make the party an enjoyable affair rather than a financial success. Of
course, there will be a number of disappointed people who will be unable
to get tickets. However, these men will lie mostly lower classmen who
will have other Proms to which they will be admitted in the future.
