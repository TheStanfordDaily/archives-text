# DEANS OF THREE LAW SCHOOLS WILL DECIDE ON LEGAL ARGUMENT
## Rights of the Wife Will Be Topic of Law Society Debate 
### 
The deans of three law schools have j
hcen secured to officiate at the annual
legal argument between Phi Alpha Delta;
and Phi Delta Phi law fraternities, to j
he held Thursday evening, April 17. j
Dean McMurrav of the College of j
Jurisprudence of the University of Cali-,
fornia and Dean Harrison of Hastings i
College of Law, together with Judge;
Shurtleff. formerly a justice of the Cali-}
fornia Supreme Court, will act as judges, i
Dean Kirkwood of the Stanford Law |
School will act as chairman.
The debate will take the form of an
argument on appeal of a case involving j
the right of the wife to devise com-1
munity property acquired by her hus-!
band before 1923. The determination of I
this question involves a consideration of I
whole character of the community re- j
lationship between husband and wife and
the nature of the wife's interest in com- j
munity property. Cases involving this |
particular question arc now before the I
Supreme Court for decision and have j
aroused considerable interest. The men
who have consented to act as judges arc j
men who are recognized in the profes-j
sion as authorities upon this phase of the
law of real property.
It is probable that the debate this year!
will measure up to the high standard set
by the legal debates which have been i
held annually since they are initiated by
the late Dean Huston, as the four men !
who have been chosen to act as counsel j
are not only outstanding students in the
law school, but arc all of them able'
speakers. Comprehensive briefs were ex-j
changed and submitted to tlie judges one,
week ago. The debate will largely take
the form of an answer to those hriefs.
Phi Delta Phi will this year be repre-1
sented by Arthur Kent and P. Eugene |
(ilenn, while Phi Alpha Delta will be
represented by Joseph Prior and Edward '
J^andels.
