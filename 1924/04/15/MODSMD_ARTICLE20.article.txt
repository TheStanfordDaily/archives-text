# The
						Women's Pageant
## 
### 
Accordingly to plans announced recently, every woman in the univer
sity is to have some part in this year's pageant.
If the women carry out this idea, the "Legend of the Laurel" should
he their most successful production. The fact that the lake, such an im
portant factor in other pageants, will not offer any assistance this year,
does not seem to hinder their plans.
The women are to be commended upon their work. A production such
as is planned means a great deal of work, not only for the committees in
charge, but also for everyone who is taking part. Now that the women
are doing everything possible to make the production a success, it is up to
the student body as a whole to support it.
