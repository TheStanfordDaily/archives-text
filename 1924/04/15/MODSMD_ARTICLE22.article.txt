# WOMEN CONTINUE TO BE BANE OF MAN'S EXISTENCE
## 
### 
Sororities at the University of
Oregon have startled Eugene with a
new device for parting an unsuspect
ing man from his wealth.
It is called a "Dime Crawl" and is
described as an after-dinner dance
which any University man may attend
who has 10 cents and a pair of active
pedals.
The "Dime Crawls" are becoming
quite the thing in Eugene. They are
given under the auspicer of the
Women's League.
