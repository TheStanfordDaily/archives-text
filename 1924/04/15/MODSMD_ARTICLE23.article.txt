# CABBAGES and Things
## 
### 
No! Cabbages is not dead! That is,
■ it hasn't died. What we MEAN is that
the old Things haven't been altogether
extinguished; although we had to take
a long vacation in order to allow old
controversies to be settled, and let the
Big Thing rake the garden patch in
order to come out with a fresh crop
t of the old dears. We've got 'em. Four
teen of 'em. They came on the staff
yesterday, and they don't realize what
blasphemies lay before them on the
; rough furrows of the cabbage patch.
* * *
j Far.into the evening we sat and talked
Of the wonders of foreign lands,
! "If I had money I'd travel," I said,
So she put car fare in my hand.
* ♦ *
Life seems to be one permanent
wave after another, and those of us
who aren't swamped use hair nets for
a bailing bucket.
* * *
I rode a little bike to school,
And thought it quite a lark,
But soon I gave the darn thing up,
It wouldn't learn to bark.
* * *
The Tea-Pot scandal has reached
such proportions that they're begin
ning to try the secretaries in alpha
betical order.
♦ * *
My room-mate takes life easy
He does whate'er he pleases,
And ever during finals
He lives a life of "E's."
* * *
"Lagunita will be dry," wails the
aborigine queener. Cheer up old thing,
no water, no mosquitoes.
Those who will miss the mosquitoes
instead of the water might be con
soled by the fact that there will be
a capable and penetrating crop await
ing next year's Fiesta.

She smiled so sweetly at me,
Though she answered not my call.
But I forgave—for she was in
The frame upon the wall.
