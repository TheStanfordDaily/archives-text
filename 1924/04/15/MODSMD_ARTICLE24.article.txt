# IN MEMORIUM
## 
### 
To my moustache, that god-like wisp,
which, in its innocence was taken from
me four sad months ago:
It couldn't live, it had to die.
It passed away without a cry,
So frail, so weak, it barely curled,
Too holy for this mortal world,
It now has made the heavenly trip,
And rests upon some saintly lip.
