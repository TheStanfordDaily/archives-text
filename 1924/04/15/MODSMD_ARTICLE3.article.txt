Once more were campus excitement
j seekers disappointed when Encina fresh
men extinguished a potential conflagra
j tion in their dormitory at 2 p. m. yester
day before the lire department could get
! into action.
The long-suffering cigarette gets the
I blame again. This time it was thrown
i into a large bamboo bush in front of the
I hall, and fanned by a strong wind, quite
! a terrifying blaze sprung up almost im
mediately. George Bogue of yearling
grid fame proved himself the hero of
tlie day by training a fire hose 011 the
; blaze before it could gain headway. By
i the time the official fire-fighters appeared
| there was not even a vestige of smoke
!to be seen. Meanwhile, Bogue amused
himself with the fire hose, showering the
too curious ones who protruded their
| heads out the windows.
