# TALES FROM THE ARCHIVES
## A
						SERIES OF ARTICLES DEALING WITH THE HISTORY OF STANFORD'S BUILDINGS No. 9. STANFORD OF THE FUTURE 
### Esther Greenacre 
The completion of Toyon and Bran
ner halls and the Enema dining hall
marks another step in the building
program outlined for Stanford at the
time of the founding of the University.
Future plans for the institution
show the present buildings as but the
nucleus of the campus. Directly ad
jacent to the big Quadrangle will be
added east and west Quadrangles, the
former having as its main building the
library. The square east of Encina,
where Toyon and Branner are located,
will be devoted to men's residence
halls, as will also a group of buildings
opposite and north of this square.
Need Law Buildings
The buildings most urgently needed
are a new law building and a women's
gymnasium. The former will be placed
in the east Quad while the latter will
be located somewhere in the vicinity
ofe the women's gymnasium.
At present the law library
of 30,000 volumes is greatly crowded.
About 22,000 of the volumes are housed
in the law building, while the remain-

der are located in the basement of
the Administration building and are
scattered through the law offices.
Extensions to the present campus
will be started when the second mil
lion of the endowment fund is com
pleted. Other buildings which are ur
gently needed are the biological and
memorial buildings.
New Buildings Planned
The following structures are con
templated when funds become avail
able: more residence halls for men,
stores, postoft'ice, engineering exten
sion, journalism and press, park area,
bacteriology, anatomy and physiology,
laboratory for physical and industrial
chemistry, mining and geology, wo
men's residence hall, unassigned build
ings.
The east and west Quadrangles will
not be double, the courts being merely
service courts. Thus additions may be
made to the library into the court back
of it in such a manner that the best
lighting and shelving arrangements
can be obtained.
