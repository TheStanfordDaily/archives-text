## California Strongest in Weight Events and Sprints; Weak in Distances

UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA—
National intersectional contests are
few and far between at the University
of California and the track meet with
the University of Illinois to be held
on the California oval April 19 is arous
ing much comment and speculation
among the students and the general
public.
Jim Barber, California's sprinter,
will meet two men from Illinois, Dud
Evans and Bob Ayres, who have been
consistently equalling his best time.
Evans has been negotiating the 100
yards in 0:9 4-5 while Barber has been
doing 0:9 9-10. In the 220 both men
have been doing 0:21 4-5. Shepherd
and Farnsworth, Barber's running
mates, are figured to place in at least
one of the events for both these men
have been improving steadily and giv
ing Barber a hard time to breast the
tape in the lead.
In the distances, Illinois looks for
midable. In the 440, Smuts is doing
0:50 4-5; Bruington, 0:51; and Carter,
0:51 6-10. Hurst of California has been
doing the quarter in 0:51. Goertz, Ag
geler, and Willi will also run for the
Blue and Gold.
In the 880, Bruington of Illinois is
doing the 880 in 1:59 6-10. McMillan,
Deßeaumont, Pierce, Siems, and
Germly will also run for the Bruins
in the half mile.
Hall is the Illinois star in the mile,
establishing a new indoor record this
year of 4:23 6-10. Ross, Kitts, and
Dunn are making around 4:38 for Cali
fornia in this event,
Mieher of Illinois set a new confer
ence record in the two-mile. The time
was 9:41. California's most likely men
in this event are Jensen, Turner, and
Knowlton. Jensen is nearing the 10:00
mark and should make it in the com
ing meet.
The hurdles are scheduled to break
either way. Becker of California is do
ing the low sticks in 0:24 6-10 and the
high ones in 0:15 4-10. Captain John
son of Illinois, and Kensey and Rehm
have been doing around the same
time.
The field events give the edge to
California. Boren in the broad jump is
now jumping 22 feet 10 1-2 inches and
should win the event. Sweeney and
Wallace of Illinois have been doing 22
feet 5 inches.
The high jump should go to Wright
of Illinois who has been jumping 6 feet
3 inches. California will enter Wither
spoon, Koblic, and Garrett for its
points in this event.
In the weight events Illinois will
meet some mighty tough competition
in the person of Captain William Neu
feld. He has been throwing the dis
cus close to 140 feet, the shot over 47
feet, and the javelin 185 feet. Lang
and Francis are also doing good work
for the Bruins in the weights.
In the javelin Illinois will probably
place first as Angler holds the Ameri
can record of 20tf feet 9 inches and
the Western conference record of 198
feet 10 inches. Neufeld and Dodson
will enter the event for California.

During the middle ages many ani
mals were tried and convicted for
alleged crimes against human beings.
