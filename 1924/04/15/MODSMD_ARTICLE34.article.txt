## HERBERT R. (STUBBY) STOLZ, '11 
### 
A scholar and an athlete.
Such was "Stubby" Stolz, middle
weight boxing champion of Stanford,
a member of Phi Beta Kappa and the
varsity track and rugby teams, and
donor of one of the gold medals of
fered in the University boxing cham
pionships tomorrow.
Little doubt there is, then, as to his
fitness to accept the honor of a
Rhodes Scholarship the year following
graduation and two years at Oxford,
England.
While at Oxford he further added to
his laurels by being the first United
States Rhodes scholar to make a
place on the Oxford rugby football
eleven, and by making a name for
himself as a quarter miler and broad
jumper.
However, for fear that he was not
already a strong enough addition to
Oxford's athletic, background, he pro
ceeded to win the middleweight box
ing championship in the annual Ox
ford-Cambridge fistic tourney.
Following his stay at Oxford, Stolz
returned to Stanford where he served
a number of years until the World
War as head of the Department of
Physical Education. At the outbreak
of the struggle, he went into the ser
vice, served overseas for 14 months,
and rose to the rank of captain in the
Medical Corps.
The war over and the armistice
signed, Stolz made application for,
an dwas appointed, over many other
applicants, as coach of the United
States rugby team which later com
peted in the Inter-Allied Games at
Paris. This was at the same time that
Harry Maloney, now of Stanford, was
coach of the United States track squad.
Stolz is now State Superintendent
of Physical Education in California.
