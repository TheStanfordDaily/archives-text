## Annual Campus Recital Will Be Given This Evening In Assembly Hall 
### 
i Nine members of the Music Club
will unite to give tlie club's annual
■ campus program at 7:30 tonight in the
Assembly hall.
The concert will be divided into five
parts. First of the groups will be
; Luella Rackliffe's playing of Chopin's
! Polonaise, and Waltz in G flat, both
,of which are among the composer's
, best known and most popular selec
tions.
"If Winter Comes," by H. M. Ten
nant, and the "Wind Song," by James
Rogers, will be sung by Carol Lasater
Ito the piano accompaniment of Lois
Olmstead. Both women are making
their initial appearance before the
| campus as a whole. The selections
they are offering are written by modern
| composers. The "Wind Song" is a
rippling accompaniment of the piano
to a smooth theme carried by the
i voice.
Bolton White, Glee Club violin solo
list. will play Kreisler's arrangement
•of Beethoven's "Rondino" and Saint
! Saen's "Introduction and Rondo Capri
i cioso." The former selection is a light
i song, a contrast to the somewhat
heavy composition by Saint-Saens.
Martin D'Andrea, tenor, offers
Bizet's "Romance of Nadir from 'Les
I Pecheurs de Perles'," a soothing,
; melancholy composition, vastly differ
i ent from Bizet's masterpiece, "Car
men."

(White is R. Willis-Porter, known as
jGlee Club and Schubert Club accom
ipanist, and will direct this year's
Fiesta orchestra.
| D'Andrea will also sing the well
loved "Ave Maria," by Gounod, to
which Meribeth Cameron will play a
violin obbligato.
A.ibert Gregersen, baritone, will sing
"Sento nel core," by the eighteenth
cenry composer, Scarlatti; "Over the
Hills and Far Away," by N. Chesson;
: and "To a Messenger," by Frank La
, Forge, to the piano accompaniment of
Richard Malaby, who is known for his
i original compositions and his interpre
tation.
Gregersen, who is a graduate, ap-
I peared in campus concerts often, and
j has recently completed studying music
with the baritone, Louis Graveure.
Malaby and White have appeared
together in providing music for many
of the campus dramatic productions.
