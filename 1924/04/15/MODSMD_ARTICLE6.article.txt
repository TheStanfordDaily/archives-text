# GAIETY TO REIGN AT ANNUAL MASQUE BALL
## Nominations For King and Queen Of Merriment Open Tomorrow 
### Bradley Riter 
"If I were king, Ah Love; if I were king,
"What treasures to your throne I'd bring.
"I'd stoop beneath your sceptre, and I'd swear
"Allegiance to your eyes, and lips, and hair."

QUITE snoppyquopish, isn't it? Yet some red-blooded man of Stanford who
wouldst be blue-blooded for a single night, will have his opportunity. lie
will be duly coronated in a carnival spirit of gaiety and unrestrained merry
making—and that is not all. Seated on his left, there will be his Queen to
whom he may whisper tender verses and sonnets; and she will be beautiful —

'the prettiest and most attractive that
Stanford has to offer.
To Reign at Masque Ball
And it will be this Stanford man and
this Stanford woman, garbed in all
the magnificent splendor of an im
perial court, who will reign over sev
eral hundred merrymakers at the sec
ond annual A. S. S. U. Masque Ball
just one week from this coming Friday
in the pavilion.
'Midst a setting that will be multi
colored, gorgeous, and distinctive,
these two monarclis will rule over
gayety and jocularity. And snappy en
tertainment and rampant carnival
spirit will make the participants wild
eyed with excitement.
Students to Choose Monarchs
Now, who is to be King and who is
to occupy the other coveted throne
as Queen? And the answer rests demo
cratically in the hands of the people.
Not by divine right, but by popular
election —so will one man and one
woman be chosen. They wander
around the campus now merely as
Stanford students, even as you and I;
but 011 April 25, the evening before
the Bruin fracas, they will be elevated
to the position of mighty potentates.
What a rise in the world!
In tomorrow's issue of the Daily
Palo Alto, there will appear a nomina
tion blank, upon which every student
may write his or her choice of King
and Queen. Each slip, counting 100'
votes for the candidates named there
on, should be placed in the box near
the Romanic Languages department
