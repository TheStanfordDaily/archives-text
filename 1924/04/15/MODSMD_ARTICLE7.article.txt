# Yearling Forensic Men Take Annual Debate From Cubs
## 
### 
Another triumph was added to the al
ready long list of 1927 victories last
night when freshman debaters won a
unanimous decision over California lirst
year men, incidentally ringing up their
second forensic win in as many years.
Meanwhile the Cardinal negative team
—Rex Kramer, Craven Scott, and Mar
old Peterson—lost by a 2 to 1 decision
to the college of Pacific at San Jose.
"Resolved, That the United States
should immediately recognize soviet
Russia," was the question debated.
Raymond Bruce, Theodore Baer, and
Lloyd Sullivan upheld the affirmative for
Stanford. California negative speakers
were Miss Blasie Whitehead. L. Harland
Frederick, and A. Brooke Petray.
The Cardinal orators surpassed their
opponents in delivery, and showed
greater ability in arguing on the main
issues. Bert Levit coached them in the
preparation of their speeches.
Bruce Speaks Well
Bruce, in particular, exhibited ease of
speaking and powers of analysis which
mark him as first-class varsity material.
For the Blue and Gold, Petray presented
his arguments convincingly.
Affirmative supporters argued for rec
ognition on the grounds that Russia has
met the test that Secretary Hughes laid
down and that recognition would benefit
not only the soviet government, hut also
the United States and the world in gen
eral. They pointed out that Russia has
a stable government which is able to pro
tect the life and property of its citizens
and that it has taken steps to meet its
financial obligations.
Negative Opposes Present Recognition
The negative favored recognition, but
not at the present time. Its supporters
maintained that the present character
of the Russian government does not war
rant its recognition, holding that such a
step would l>e in effect a recognition of
the right of the soviets to confiscate the
property of our citizens and to repudiate
its obligations.
Professors Alsberg. Owens, and Hol
land of the Stanford faculty judged the
debate. Professor Lee Bassett was
chairman.
