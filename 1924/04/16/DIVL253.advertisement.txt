Why we guarantee our clothes
to you as wearer
Our guarantee to the wearer is the simplest way we know to emphasize the
high quality of our clothes, and relieve the mind of a "Doubting Thomas."
The cost to us of guaranteeing our product is so trivial as to really be an
insignificant item in our costs, even though abuse of this liberal policy is
apparent from time to time.
A broad varietyol pockets, After years of record, the guarantee has proven to be a silent compliment

our exacting specifications in converting raw materials to a beautifully fin

out sometime, but when more value and satisfaction than dollars paid has
been realized, the public is the fairest jury a manufacturer can enlist, it
seems from our years of record.
We, therefore, confidently guarantee our product.
