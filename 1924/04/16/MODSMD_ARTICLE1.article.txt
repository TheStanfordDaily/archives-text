# YEARLINGS WIN FROM STOCKTON HIGH NINE, 14-10
## Babe Diamond Artists Start Off Bad, But Rally in Sixth Inning 
### 
Playing indifferently and displaying
a decided lack of spirit the Cardinal
yearlings stumbled through a game
with the Stockton high school nine
yesterday afternoon and managed to
•crawl to the top side of a 14-10 score.
Osthaus started the first inning by
allowing four walks and one hit, and
aided by a couple of errors, Stockton
scored five runs. During the latter half
of the same inning the frosh made a
feeble attempt to "come back" but the
attempt progressed no further than
second base when they succeeded in
getting two men on bases by walks.
Score Six in Eighth
During the sixth inning the fresh
men came out of their daze long
enough to score six runs when they
were aided by six errors made by the
visitors, a two-base hit by Riese,
singles by Linquist and Mackersie, and
a home-run by Bill Stewart. Riese
struck out three straight men in the
first of the inning.
Stockton made three more runs in
the Bth inning when they succeeded in
getting two two-base hits from Hunter
who had been substituted for Riese
in the seventh inning.
Baillard started the game on the
receiving end of the battery and was
the only man on the team who did not
appear to be on the verge of a night
mare. He made two clean hits in three
times at bat and gave splendid sup
port to Osthaus.
Babes Hit Freely
The babes managed to score two
markers in the third frame when Ger
ald Stewart started the batting order
with a two-base hit. Riese was put out
when he hit a grounder to third but
Stewart advanced one base on this
play. Morrill hit a long drive into left
field for a complete circuit, thus bring
ing in the two scores. Linquist at
tempted to keep the rally in force with
a single, but he was forced out on a
fielder's choice when David hit to
short. David was put out on the next
play when he attempted to steal sec
ond.
In the fourth inning the freshmen
drew blood again with an error, a
single, and a home-run by Osthaus in
their favor. The "prep" school aggre
gation made two more counts in the
same inning when Osthaus hit one
batter and allowed three hits.
Osthaus, Riese, and Hunter allowed
the visitors 8 hits while the freshmen
hit the Stockton pitchers, Pigozzi and
ewitt, for 14 hits. The visitors made
six errors and the babes made eight.
It was lucky for the frosh that they
were able to hit the Stockton pitchers
because their fielding and general at
titude would have been their downfall
otherwise. Coach Hunt hopes to pull
them out of the slump before their
next tussle with the Cubs Saturday.

In the fourth inning the freshmen
drew blood again with an error, a
single, and a home-run by Osthaus in
their favor. The "prep" school aggre
gation made two more counts in the
same inning when Osthaus hit one
batter and allowed three hits.
Osthaus, Riese, and Hunter allowed
the visitors 8 hits while the freshmen
hit the Stockton pitchers, Pigozzi and
ewitt, for 14 hits. The visitors made
six errors and the babes made eight.
It was lucky for the frosh that they
were able to hit the Stockton pitchers
because their fielding and general at
titude would have been their downfall
otherwise. Coach Hunt hopes to pull
them out of the slump before their
next tussle with the Cubs Saturday.
Playing indifferently and displaying
a decided lack of spirit the Cardinal
yearlings stumbled through a game
with the Stockton high school nine
yesterday afternoon and managed to
•crawl to the top side of a 14-10 score.
Osthaus started the first inning by
allowing four walks and one hit, and
aided by a couple of errors, Stockton
scored five runs. During the latter half
of the same inning the frosh made a
feeble attempt to "come back" but the
attempt progressed no further than
second base when they succeeded in
getting two men on bases by walks.
Score Six in Eighth
During the sixth inning the fresh
men came out of their daze long
enough to score six runs when they
were aided by six errors made by the
visitors, a two-base hit by Riese,
singles by Linquist and Mackersie, and
a home-run by Bill Stewart. Riese
struck out three straight men in the
first of the inning.
Stockton made three more runs in
the Bth inning when they succeeded in
getting two two-base hits from Hunter
who had been substituted for Riese
in the seventh inning.
Baillard started the game on the
receiving end of the battery and was
the only man on the team who did not
appear to be on the verge of a night
mare. He made two clean hits in three
times at bat and gave splendid sup
port to Osthaus.
Babes Hit Freely
The babes managed to score two
markers in the third frame when Ger
ald Stewart started the batting order
with a two-base hit. Riese was put out
when he hit a grounder to third but
Stewart advanced one base on this
play. Morrill hit a long drive into left
field for a complete circuit, thus bring
ing in the two scores. Linquist at
tempted to keep the rally in force with
a single, but he was forced out on a
fielder's choice when David hit to
short. David was put out on the next
play when he attempted to steal sec
