# THIRTEEN THESES WRITTEN
## M. A. and Ph. D. Candidates Select Subjects Of Widely Varied Character 
### Marjorie Morehead 
Ten students submitted theses as
candidates for M.A. degree and three
for a Ph.D. at the end of the winter
quarter, on subjects ranging from
"The Growth and Degree of Maturity
of Chinook Salmon in the Ocean," to
"Tertriary Petrology in the Coalinga
District, California." These papers
represent anywhere from six months
to two years work.
Fearing Studies Equilibrium
Balance and the ability to stand still
were studied by Franklin Smith Fear
ing in his paper on "An Experimental
Study of Certain Factors Influencing
Static Equilibrium," a portion of a re
search on which he has been working
for the past year and a half.
Fearing, who is an instructor in the
Department of Phychology, based his
experiments on the influence of height
and weight on the amount that a per
son sways.
"A (all person," he says, "sways
more than a short person, and a thin
one more than a stocky one. To some
extent, this amount of swaying can be
reduced by practice. For instance, if
a person sways three times a week for
six months his sway will be reduced.
The small amount, of the reduction is
due to the fact that there is no ac
tivity practiced more than standing

erect. We don't learn it; the habit is
formed without practice.
"Swaying is also affected by the di
rection of the attention and the posi
tion of the feet, that is, whether a per
son's feet are together or apart.
Swaying Is Muscular Problem
Swaying, according to Fearing, is a
problem in muscular adjustment. It
is related to some extent to the func
tion of the semi-circular canals. It is
| also related to muscular co-ordination,
j As a proof of this there is the person
! who is suffering from a certain de
; generative disease of the central ner-
J vous system who cannot stand erect
j with his eyes closed.
200 Subjects Used
In his research work Fearing used j
i about 200 people, all of his experi
ments being made with the subject's
I eyes closed, limiting the sensations I
I to those from the muscles in the soles '
| of the feet.
The amount of sway is measured in
terms of millimeters by an ataximeter, l
an apparatus devised by Professor W.
It. Miles of the Psychology depart
ment, to measure the amount and path
i of sway when a person stands erect,
j This apparatus was used a great deal j
in testing men for aviation during the j
war.
