# VARIATION, TALENT SHOWN IN PROGRAM AT MUSIC RECITAL
## Skillful Technique and Clear Tones Are Evident in White's Playing 
### 
Variety of entertainment and con
trast in selections were outstanding
in last night's Music Club concert in
the Assembly hall.
Bolton White's playnig of Kreisler's
"Rondino" and of Saint-Saens', and the
difficult, but tuneful, "Introduction and
Rondo Capriccioso" delighted with its
artistry and the jclear melody of the
violin.
Trills Are Faultless
In the trills of the second selection,
White's technique was faultless, and
in every note quality of tone and feel
ing were evident.
His encore, "Contredanses," by
Beethoven-Seiss, was as inspiring as
the preceding numbers.
Albert Gregersen's baritone was
well accompanied by Richard Malaby
at the piano. Gregersen's voice has
range and depth. His treatment of
Scarlatti's "Sento nel core" was vigor
ous, showing the great resonance of
tone he can achieve. As encore to his
group, he sang Treharne's "Picka,-
ninny."
Trio Plays "Ave Maria"
Trio work was excellent in the play
ign of both "Ave Maria" and the en
core, "Dawn," a composition of a mod
ern composer, by Meribeth Cameron,
violinist, Martin D'Andrea, tenor, and
R. Willis-Porter at the piano. The
subdued, pleading tones of the ever
lovely "Ave Maria" were brought out
with pleasing artistry and feeling.
Chopin's "Waltz in C sharp minor,"
and "Waltz in G flat major" were
pleasingly interpreted by Luella Rack
liffe. In her encore, Chopin's "Waltz in
D flat major," she displayed more
feeling than in either of the other two
selections.
In the singing of H. M. Tennant's
"If Winter Comes," and James Rogers'
"Wind Song," Carol Lasater's person
ality was outstanding. What her voice
lacked in volume was made up by
great sweetness of tone. She was ac
companied by Lois Olmsted.
