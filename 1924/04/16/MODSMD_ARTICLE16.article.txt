# BOXING TITLES TO BE DECIDED IN ANNUAL MEET
## Bouts Start at 7:30 Tonight In Encina Gym; Winners To Get Medals 
### Douglas Meservey 
Not only champions but Olympic
I Games prospects will come to light
i tonight when Cardinal boxers meet in
| the anrual University championships
jto be held in Encina gymnasium at
| 7:30.
Every man in the University is eli
! gible to compete, whether he is a var
! sity or non-varsity man. Coach Harry
Maloney has made the tourney doubly
' interesting by rounding up nine gold
i medals, donated by former Stanford
' fistic title-holders, to be given the
j winners of the final bouts.
Martin Has Good Record
Two men will be watched with in
i terest tonight. Martin, a junior wel
j ter, has set an enviable record this
; season of three knockouts in as many
i intercollegiate bouts, all handed out
j with a few minutes of the opening
I gong. He is matched tonight with
! Parsons, a freshman, it being their
! third encounter —the previous two
I ending in draws. Martin is a varsity
man with a good wallop, as his three
i K. O.'s testify, but his punch will be
i matched against a speedy fighter with
good footwork. If he ever connects
; the trio of K. O.'s will be increased
jto four but Parson's speed will un
| doubtedly keep him safe.
Schall Is Promising Boxer
The other promising bout will
be between Schall, also a yearling, and
some man yet undecided upon. Schall
in in the senior middleweight division
1 and thus far this season has proved
' himself far superior to anything near
! his weight in the University, making
i his mitts greatly respected ones.
Armbruster has withdrawn as a
| featherweight entrant, leaving Miron
j and Tashjian to fight it out. The for
i raer should win easily, his past ex
-1 perience giving him the odds over
Tashjian, who has practiced little..
Bantamweights Evenly Matched
Freeman and Simmons are evenly
matched in the bantamweight class.
The former did well last year but has
been ineligible for varsity competition
this season. Simmons lost his only
bout of the year to Milhe of the Cali
fornia Aggies when the latter rushed
him off his feet for the first few
minutes.
Harward should win over Goldwater
in the lightweight division with good
ring experience back of him. Gold
water is speedy and is an all-around
competer in fencing, wrestling, and
boxing, but lacks the necessary skill
to be in Harward's class.
Three Men Out for Welter Title
Three men will have to mix it for
the senior welterweight title. Hall, a
varsity man, leads the trio with his
easy win over Caisson of the Grizzlie
squad last Saturday. He packs a
strong right punch in both fists and
uses good footwork.
McCallister and Stanford have both
fought in the elimination bouts but
are not in the ring consistently enough
to put them on Hall's level. McCallister
has a strong defense and two fast
mitts, while Stanford is only fair on
offensive but improving with daily
workouts.
Irwin Has Edge on Adams
Adams put on the best bout of the ]
second Aggie meet, March 7, and lost I
only after a 2 to 1 decision. Captain
Irwin, however, of the varsity squad,
has the edge, having beaten Barlow,
who handed Adams his defeat.
Van Hook, a light-heavy, is a hard
man to down, as Farmin, his oppon
ent, will find, and particularly when
it comes tc infighting. Farmin has a
good left and right and should put up
an interesting scrap.
Robinson and Huneke are unevenly
matched in the heavyweight division
and the former's weight should throw
the fight in his favor. Robinson lost
his first bout with Davis but beat
Sergis of the Southern Branch.

Robinson and Huneke are unevenly

Not only champions but Olympic
I Games prospects will come to light
i tonight when Cardinal boxers meet in

jto be held in Encina gymnasium at

Every man in the University is eli

Maloney has made the tourney doubly
' interesting by rounding up nine gold
i medals, donated by former Stanford
' fistic title-holders, to be given the
j winners of the final bouts.
Martin Has Good Record
Two men will be watched with in
i terest tonight. Martin, a junior wel
j ter, has set an enviable record this
; season of three knockouts in as many
i intercollegiate bouts, all handed out
j with a few minutes of the opening
I gong. He is matched tonight with
! Parsons, a freshman, it being their
! third encounter —the previous two
I ending in draws. Martin is a varsity
man with a good wallop, as his three
i K. O.'s testify, but his punch will be
i matched against a speedy fighter with
good footwork. If he ever connects
; the trio of K. O.'s will be increased
jto four but Parson's speed will un
| doubtedly keep him safe.
Schall Is Promising Boxer
The other promising bout will
be between Schall, also a yearling, and
some man yet undecided upon. Schall
in in the senior middleweight division
1 and thus far this season has proved
' himself far superior to anything near
! his weight in the University, making
i his mitts greatly respected ones.
Armbruster has withdrawn as a
| featherweight entrant, leaving Miron
j and Tashjian to fight it out. The for
i raer should win easily, his past ex
-1 perience giving him the odds over
Tashjian, who has practiced little..
Bantamweights Evenly Matched
Freeman and Simmons are evenly
matched in the bantamweight class.
The former did well last year but has
been ineligible for varsity competition
this season. Simmons lost his only
bout of the year to Milhe of the Cali
fornia Aggies when the latter rushed
him off his feet for the first few
minutes.
Harward should win over Goldwater
in the lightweight division with good
ring experience back of him. Gold
water is speedy and is an all-around
competer in fencing, wrestling, and
boxing, but lacks the necessary skill
to be in Harward's class.
Three Men Out for Welter Title
Three men will have to mix it for
the senior welterweight title. Hall, a
varsity man, leads the trio with his
easy win over Caisson of the Grizzlie
squad last Saturday. He packs a
strong right punch in both fists and
uses good footwork.
McCallister and Stanford have both
fought in the elimination bouts but
are not in the ring consistently enough
to put them on Hall's level. McCallister
has a strong defense and two fast
mitts, while Stanford is only fair on
offensive but improving with daily
workouts.
Irwin Has Edge on Adams
Adams put on the best bout of the ]
second Aggie meet, March 7, and lost I
only after a 2 to 1 decision. Captain
Irwin, however, of the varsity squad,
has the edge, having beaten Barlow,
who handed Adams his defeat.
Van Hook, a light-heavy, is a hard

him off his feet for the first few
minutes.
Harward should win over Goldwater
in the lightweight division with good
ring experience back of him. Gold
water is speedy and is an all-around
competer in fencing, wrestling, and
boxing, but lacks the necessary skill
to be in Harward's class.
Three Men Out for Welter Title
Three men will have to mix it for
the senior welterweight title. Hall, a
varsity man, leads the trio with his
easy win over Caisson of the Grizzlie
squad last Saturday. He packs a
strong right punch in both fists and
uses good footwork.
McCallister and Stanford have both
fought in the elimination bouts but
are not in the ring consistently enough
to put them on Hall's level. McCallister
has a strong defense and two fast
mitts, while Stanford is only fair on
offensive but improving with daily
workouts.
Irwin Has Edge on Adams
Adams put on the best bout of the ]
second Aggie meet, March 7, and lost I
only after a 2 to 1 decision. Captain
Irwin, however, of the varsity squad,
has the edge, having beaten Barlow,
who handed Adams his defeat.
Van Hook, a light-heavy, is a hard
man to down, as Farmin, his oppon
ent, will find, and particularly when
it comes tc infighting. Farmin has a
good left and right and should put up
an interesting scrap.
Robinson and Huneke are unevenly
matched in the heavyweight division
and the former's weight should throw
the fight in his favor. Robinson lost
his first bout with Davis but beat
Sergis of the Southern Branch.

Not only champions but Olympic
I Games prospects will come to light
i tonight when Cardinal boxers meet in
| the anrual University championships
jto be held in Encina gymnasium at
| 7:30.
Every man in the University is eli
! gible to compete, whether he is a var
! sity or non-varsity man. Coach Harry
Maloney has made the tourney doubly
' interesting by rounding up nine gold
i medals, donated by former Stanford
' fistic title-holders, to be given the
j winners of the final bouts.
Martin Has Good Record
Two men will be watched with in
i terest tonight. Martin, a junior wel
j ter, has set an enviable record this
; season of three knockouts in as many
i intercollegiate bouts, all handed out
j with a few minutes of the opening
I gong. He is matched tonight with
! Parsons, a freshman, it being their
! third encounter —the previous two
I ending in draws. Martin is a varsity
man with a good wallop, as his three
i K. O.'s testify, but his punch will be
i matched against a speedy fighter with
good footwork. If he ever connects
; the trio of K. O.'s will be increased
jto four but Parson's speed will un
| doubtedly keep him safe.
Schall Is Promising Boxer
The other promising bout will
be between Schall, also a yearling, and
some man yet undecided upon. Schall
in in the senior middleweight division
1 and thus far this season has proved
' himself far superior to anything near
! his weight in the University, making
i his mitts greatly respected ones.
Armbruster has withdrawn as a
| featherweight entrant, leaving Miron
j and Tashjian to fight it out. The for
i raer should win easily, his past ex
-1 perience giving him the odds over
Tashjian, who has practiced little..
Bantamweights Evenly Matched
Freeman and Simmons are evenly
matched in the bantamweight class.
The former did well last year but has
been ineligible for varsity competition
this season. Simmons lost his only
bout of the year to Milhe of the Cali
fornia Aggies when the latter rushed
him off his feet for the first few
minutes.
Harward should win over Goldwater
in the lightweight division with good
