# BOXING TITLES TO BE DECIDED IN ANNUAL MEET
## Bouts Start at 7:30 Tonight In Encina Gym; Winners To Get Medals 
### Douglas Meservey 
Not only champions but Olympic
I Games prospects will come to light
i tonight when Cardinal boxers meet in
| the anrual University championships
jto be held in Encina gymnasium at
| 7:30.
Every man in the University is eli
! gible to compete, whether he is a var
! sity or non-varsity man. Coach Harry
Maloney has made the tourney doubly
' interesting by rounding up nine gold
i medals, donated by former Stanford
' fistic title-holders, to be given the
j winners of the final bouts.
Martin Has Good Record
Two men will be watched with in
i terest tonight. Martin, a junior wel
j ter, has set an enviable record this
; season of three knockouts in as many
i intercollegiate bouts, all handed out
j with a few minutes of the opening
I gong. He is matched tonight with
! Parsons, a freshman, it being their
! third encounter —the previous two
I ending in draws. Martin is a varsity
man with a good wallop, as his three
i K. O.'s testify, but his punch will be
i matched against a speedy fighter with
good footwork. If he ever connects
; the trio of K. O.'s will be increased
jto four but Parson's speed will un
| doubtedly keep him safe.
Schall Is Promising Boxer
The other promising bout will
be between Schall, also a yearling, and
some man yet undecided upon. Schall
in in the senior middleweight division
1 and thus far this season has proved
' himself far superior to anything near
! his weight in the University, making
i his mitts greatly respected ones.
Armbruster has withdrawn as a
| featherweight entrant, leaving Miron
j and Tashjian to fight it out. The for
i raer should win easily, his past ex
-1 perience giving him the odds over
Tashjian, who has practiced little..
Bantamweights Evenly Matched
Freeman and Simmons are evenly
matched in the bantamweight class.
