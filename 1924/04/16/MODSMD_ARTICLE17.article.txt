# WOMEN OPPOSED TO INTERCOLLEGIATE CONTESTS
## 
### 
That each college make an effort to
do away with intercollegiate competi
tion was a resolution passed at the final
business meeting of the national Ath
letic Conference of American College
Women held at Berkeley April 10 to
12, which was attended by two hun
dred delegates.
Eunice Riddle, Stanford's official
delegate, read a paper opposing varsity
competition. The national conference
is definitely against such activity and by
the next countrywide convention it is
hoped that it will be completely abol
ished.
Swimming Rulings Presented.
Margaret Watson explained "Stand
ardization of Swimming Events." The
model accepted by the Western Sec
tional Conference has been incorpor
ated in a Spaulding manual, which in
sures its acceptance by the national or
ganization.
Ihe national conference meets only
once in three years. Its next confer
ence will be at Cornell University,
Ithaca, N. Y. The sectional meeting,
which was at Stanford last spring, is to
convene at the University of California
Southern Branch in 1925.
National Officer Elected.
An important step taken at the con
ference was the election of a national
secretary-treasurer which is to be a col
lege rather than an individual. The
University of Wisconsin was chosen to
fill the position, which will be the gen
eral headquarters for information as
■well as the national treasury. The an

nual news-letter will be published by
the University of California for the next
three years.
Those who attended the conference
from Stanford were: Miss Helen
Masters Bunting, Miss Isabel Capps,
Eunice Biddle, Margaret Watson, Lu
cille Alison, Geraldine Franklin, Lo
