Snakes, roughs, hall men, row men,
bold men, and timid men are all going

and they say it's going to be a real
party.
Just before S:3O University trucks
will roar up to Roble and thunder
down the row to bear the fair rushees
to the pavilion. Campus clothes will
be the thing and informality will reign
supreme. Chances to meet that secret
sorrow will abound for no introduc
tions are necessary. Music will be fur
nished by the famous Mertz-Alabaster
eight-piece orchestra.
