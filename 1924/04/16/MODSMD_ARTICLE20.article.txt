# How Many Rooters?
## 
### 
Students arc being given their last chance to purchase rooters' tickets
for the Big Meet this week. The precious pasteboards which will entitle
the holder to a good seat at the best track meet of the year will be
available tomorrow and Friday from 12 to 1 o'clock in the Administra
tion building. Saturday morning, the ticket office will be open until
noon. At that time, the rooting section will be closed and not only will
students have to pay the regular admission price, but they will also have
to sit outside the rooting section.
Stanford rooters, for the past few years, have had to be good losers.
They have filled their rooting sections to overflowing and have taken
their medicine. Now Stanford has a team of which she may well be
proud. The 1924 track squad is one of the strongest in the United
.States. On the team are men who will probably hold intercollegiate or
even world's records before the season is over. Those men may choose
the Big Meet as a suitable time to shatter existing records.
A section of the Stadium, large enough to hold the entire student body,
has been reserved and will remain closed to all but student rooters until
noon Saturday. Early sales indicate that the section will be full. It
should be full.
All red-blooded Stanford men and women should want to be in that
rooting section, not only to make it evident to the track men that they
have confidence in them, but also to help out with the bleacher stunts.
It has been a long time since Stanford rooters have had an opportunity
to serpentine. On April 26, they will probably have a chance to feel the
Stadium turf under their feet.
With a howling mob of red-hatted rooters dashing around on the
field below, the student who did not sit in the rooting section and hence
is not in on the fun, will feel pretty badly. The way to avoid that
lonesome feeling on April 26, is to walk up to the window in the
Administration building some time before Saturday noon, plank down
one iron man, walk away with the pasteboard, and then go into training
for the greatest yell fest in many years.
