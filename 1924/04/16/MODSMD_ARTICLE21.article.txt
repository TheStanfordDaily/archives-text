# How About Mother and Dad

### 
University Day, this year, should be the biggest ever held on the Farm.
Extensive arrangements have been made to show the alumni the time
of their lives on April 26.
At present, there are 125 sons and daughters of Sanford alumni
registered in the University. The alumni mothers and fathers should be
the easiest to reach. They will enjoy getting back to the Farm, and it is
up to the students to see that they get here.
Every year, alumni from all parts of the world return to Stanford
for University Day. Those who have sons and daughters in the Univer
sity now, are naturally more interested in what is going on than any
others. Just a word from the student undergraduate will probably
influence mother and dad to lay aside business and household duties for
a short time in order to be back with the "gang."
Send the folks a few copies of the Daily Palo Alto, telling of the plans
for University Day, and show them what they will miss by staying away.
