# Who's Who On Card Baseball Squad
## JIM LAWSON 
### 
Jim Lawson.
The blonde who plays catch with
blue eyes.
That's the way the small boy from
Palo Alto would describe James W.
Lawson, who backstops for the varsity
nine. Maybe he's right in his descrip
tion but only his baseball playing will
be discussed here.
Lawson played baseball and football
during his high school years, and on
the side competed in a few track
events. He hails from Long Beach and
was tutored in ball playing by Ed
Kienholtz, who is now coach of Santa
Clara.
He caught during his four years at
Long Beach and was named captain of
the club during his final semester.
Arriving at Stanford, he celebrated
by doing his share of work on the
1925 freshman team which took the
annual series from the Bear frosh.
Lawson was not in college last year
and is playing his first year of varsity
ball now.
Jim was out of two games daring
the latter part of this season due to a
split finger, but with the exception of
those, he has been in there, working
hard all the time.
