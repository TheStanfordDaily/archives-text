## OLYMPIC STARS OF OTHER YEARS 
### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Twenty-four years ago in Paris at the second Olympiad, a young competitor
from the United States named Alvin Kraenzlein startled the athletic world by
winning four first places. His efforts in the 60 metre run, the high and low
hurdle races and the running broad jump established four Olympic records
and netted his country twenty points.
True the competition wasn't nearly so severe as it will be in the forthcoming
games in Paris, for instance, but nevertheless, Kraenzlein was about two
decades ahead of his time when it came to form in hurdling, and if he had
specialized, as modern track athletes do, it probably would have lowered his
best marks.
Kraenzlein was at one time the holder of the world's records in both hurdle
races and the broad jump, and his mark of 23 3-5 seconds in the 220 yard
low hurdles established in 1898 was not broken until Brookins of lowa ran
23 1-5 seconds last year. Besides his Olympic victories, this remarkable
athlete won 7 national and 8 intercollegiate championships, and scored 45
points for Pennsylvania in the three years that he competed in the I. C. 4 A
games.
