A triple play featured the Sequoia-
Encina contest. With three men on,

It looked good for a double, but Ship

ond led off with two runs, but could
! not cross the pan again until the fifth,

Encina contest. With three men on,
Sequoia drove a liner down first base.
It looked good for a double, but Ship
key, first-baseman, grabbed it out of
the air, touched first, and threw to sec
ond before the runners knew what it
! was all about.
The game as a whole was ragged,
with many errors. Wells pitched for
Sequoia, Truman and Shipkey hurling
1 for Encina.
Against the Phi Delts, Encina Sec
ond led off with two runs, but could
! not cross the pan again until the fifth,
■when two men cashed in. The Phi
Delts scored in every round except
the fourth. Schacht, in the box for the
i winners, walked six men, but managed
to scatter the hits.
Sigma Alpha Epsilon scored ten runs
in one inning when it downed Phi
Sigma Kappa, 14 to 5. The latter led
until the fourth; then S. A. E. tied
the score and in the fifth cut loose
with the ten-run rally that put the
game on ice. Murphy, hurling for S.
A. E., struck out eight men. Johnson
pitched a good game for Phi Sigma
Kappa, but poor fielding threw the
game away.
A pretty double play ended the fra
; cas. Phi Sigma Kappa was at bat.
Smith had been caught off base at
| second after a single and a steal.
1 Comptpn was safe on an error, and
j advanced to second on a passed ball.
: Eva singled. Then Roberts clouted a
i hot one into the arms of Strong, S.
A. E. shortstop. Strong held onto the
ball and threw to second, where Bee
l man tagged Compton before he could
i touch base.
