# University Women Plan Program and Dancing For Conference Party
## 
### 
Tumblers, a song, and a negro im
personation! These comprise the pro
gram to be offered this evening at the
conference party for all University
women at the Women's Clubhouse.
Novel for conference parties is the
fact that admission will be free. The
only charges will be made for refresh
ments. Since home-made cake and ice
cream are on the menu, there will be
little objection to the prices, the pro
ceeds of which are to go to the
Women's Clubhouse fund.
Alice Roth, retiring president of
Organized Women, and Carolan
Strouse, president-elect, will give ac
counts of their recent trip, and con
duct a business meeting.
