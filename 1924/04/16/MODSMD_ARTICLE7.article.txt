# TRACK TEAM BEGINS PREPARATION FOR BEAR CONTEST
## Ian Campbell, Bill Stone, and Al Charles Are on List of Injured 
### Wallace Knox 
What is said to be the best dual
meet track team in the United States
has settled down to work in prepara
tion for the Big Meet with the Univer
sity of California which will take place
in the stadium on April 26.
Coach "Dink" Templeton's charges
have completed their preliminary sea
son without a defeat, and have shown
a steady improvement in each suc
ceeding meet. Last Saturday the
tracksters showed their ability to
through against the stift'est sort
of opposition, by running away from
the Southern Conference all-star team
to the tune of 87 to 44.
In this meet every member of the
squad did what was expected of him
with the exception of the pole vaulters.
