# TRACK TEAM BEGINS PREPARATION FOR BEAR CONTEST
## Ian Campbell, Bill Stone, and Al Charles Are on List of Injured 
### Wallace Knox 
What is said to be the best dual
meet track team in the United States
has settled down to work in prepara
tion for the Big Meet with the Univer
sity of California which will take place
in the stadium on April 26.
Coach "Dink" Templeton's charges
have completed their preliminary sea
son without a defeat, and have shown
a steady improvement in each suc
ceeding meet. Last Saturday the
tracksters showed their ability to
through against the stift'est sort
of opposition, by running away from
the Southern Conference all-star team
to the tune of 87 to 44.
In this meet every member of the
squad did what was expected of him
with the exception of the pole vaulters.
Phil Scofield and Guy Dennis man
aged to get over the 12-foot mark, but
could go no higher. As Scofleld did 12
feet 6 in the fracas with the Olympic
Club it was hoped that he could re
peat the performances against men
like Goodenough and Graham, but as
yet he is not up to the task. More
than a week remains before the Big
Meet, and "Dink" may be able to get
him going over the 12 foot G mark by
that time.
A1 Charles is hobbling around the
campus with bad shin splints. He will
not be able to work out for several
days, but it is probable that he will
participate in the crucial contest.
Charles has been one of the most con
sistent performers on the squad, win
ning the two-mile run in every meet,
usually in fast time. He is a likely first
place winner April 2G, unless he
should be unable to get back in shape.
Campbell on Hospital List
lan Campbell was unable to run last
week because of foot trouble. Camp
bell was a cinch to win the 220-yard
dash against the Blue and Gold and if
he is able to get into condition again
will undoubtedly carry off honors in
this distance.
The third member of the squad on
the hospital list is Bill Storie. He has
been suffering from internal trouble
for some time, but received doctors'
permission to compete last week. He
placed third in the 220-yard dash, but
looked badly out of form. Storie
strained himself at the beginning of
the season and he will have a hard
time getting back into shape by the

time of the Big Meet. The quarter
mile is his regular event and he will
probably not run it at top speed until
the day of the Big Meet and no one
can say in just what shape he will be
until then.
Hartranft After Record
"Tiny" Hartranft is getting better
in the weight events every day. Un
less he breaks his arm or something
similar before that time he is a cinch
to make ten points for the Cardinal.
His chances of shattering the world's
record in the shot put are also of the
very best. He missed it by only half
an inch last Saturday—close enough
to the record to make Ralph Rose
worry if he were alive today.
Jim Arthur got into action for the
first time against the Southern Con
ference. His performance was good,
although not up to his work of last
year. With a little more practice he
should round into shape so that he
can place second to Hartranft in the
discus and also garner a point or two
in the shot.
"Scotchy" Campbell has been doing
well in practice with the discus, land
ing the platter out 135 feet. If he can
do this in the Big Meet Stanfrod is
i likely to shut the Bears out in the
discus scoring.

an inch last Saturday—close enough
to the record to make Ralph Rose
worry if he were alive today.
Jim Arthur got into action for the
first time against the Southern Con
ference. His performance was good,
although not up to his work of last
year. With a little more practice he
should round into shape so that he
can place second to Hartranft in the
discus and also garner a point or two
in the shot.
"Scotchy" Campbell has been doing
well in practice with the discus, land
ing the platter out 135 feet. If he can
do this in the Big Meet Stanfrod is
i likely to shut the Bears out in the
discus scoring.
What is said to be the best dual
meet track team in the United States
has settled down to work in prepara
tion for the Big Meet with the Univer
sity of California which will take place
in the stadium on April 26.
Coach "Dink" Templeton's charges
have completed their preliminary sea
son without a defeat, and have shown
a steady improvement in each suc
ceeding meet. Last Saturday the
tracksters showed their ability to
through against the stift'est sort
of opposition, by running away from
the Southern Conference all-star team
to the tune of 87 to 44.
In this meet every member of the
squad did what was expected of him
with the exception of the pole vaulters.
Phil Scofield and Guy Dennis man
aged to get over the 12-foot mark, but
could go no higher. As Scofleld did 12
feet 6 in the fracas with the Olympic
Club it was hoped that he could re
peat the performances against men
like Goodenough and Graham, but as
yet he is not up to the task. More
than a week remains before the Big
Meet, and "Dink" may be able to get
him going over the 12 foot G mark by
that time.
A1 Charles is hobbling around the
campus with bad shin splints. He will
not be able to work out for several
days, but it is probable that he will
participate in the crucial contest.
Charles has been one of the most con
sistent performers on the squad, win
ning the two-mile run in every meet,
usually in fast time. He is a likely first
place winner April 2G, unless he
should be unable to get back in shape.
Campbell on Hospital List
lan Campbell was unable to run last
week because of foot trouble. Camp
bell was a cinch to win the 220-yard
dash against the Blue and Gold and if
he is able to get into condition again
will undoubtedly carry off honors in
this distance.
The third member of the squad on
the hospital list is Bill Storie. He has
been suffering from internal trouble
for some time, but received doctors'
permission to compete last week. He
placed third in the 220-yard dash, but
looked badly out of form. Storie
strained himself at the beginning of
the season and he will have a hard
time getting back into shape by the

time of the Big Meet. The quarter
mile is his regular event and he will
probably not run it at top speed until
the day of the Big Meet and no one
can say in just what shape he will be
until then.
Hartranft After Record
"Tiny" Hartranft is getting better
in the weight events every day. Un
less he breaks his arm or something
similar before that time he is a cinch
to make ten points for the Cardinal.
His chances of shattering the world's
record in the shot put are also of the
very best. He missed it by only half
an inch last Saturday—close enough
to the record to make Ralph Rose
worry if he were alive today.
