# WALTER CONFIDENT THAT CARDS CAN TRIM BRUINS
## Baseball Coach to Use Same Line-Up Next Saturday; Nevers to Pitch 
### 
Although the Bear varsity handed
the Cards a beating in the opening
game of the series, Coach Harry Wol
ter does not take a pessimistic view of
the outcome of the series.
On the contrary, he is confident that
the same line-up which took the field
last week can handle the California
team in next Saturday's contest, and
is contemplating no changes.
Cards Superior at Bat
At the bat Stanford was far superior
to the Blue and Gold club. McCandless
collected three safe blows out of four
attempts; May and Fuller each ac
counted for two, and Nevers slapped
out a homer. Each of the other Card
players connected once.
With the hitting power of Wolter's
club so great, the big thing necessary
for the team to do is to eliminate the
errors from its system. If it hadn't
been for errors —well —the Bears
wouldn't have come out ahead.
Nevers is expected to be Wolter's
choice for the hurling job in the sec
ond battle. The big boy pitched a win
ning game against the Berkeley team
and should be able to hold them in
check if proper support is given him.
However, no alibis are being offered
for Saturday's defeat and Coach Wol
ter is sending the men through a
daily practice on the field to the end
that a repetition of last week's sad
happening does not take place.
