## University Championships Are Decided by Fast Bouts In Tournament 
### 
Nine University championships were
decided last night in the annual all
"University championship boxing tour
ney. All the bouts were close and
speedy, providing the spectators with
the most interesting series of fights
held in many years at Stanford.
Gold medals, donated by former
champions, will be awarded the win
ners.
An exhibition bout between Schall.
a senior middleweight, and McCallis
ter, the third entry in the senior wel
ter division, touched oft the fireworks.
The fight was really a work-out for
Hall, who was later to meet the win
ner of the McCallister-Stanford bout,
but he was greatly outclassed in both
â– weight and ability by the experienced
Schall.
McCallister Downs Stanford
McCallister won the right to meet
Hall by taking a close decision over
Stanford in the senior welterweight
division. McCallister used a good right
to advantage and toward the end of
the second Stanford weakened. He at
tempted a recovery in the third but,
under straights to the face, again
weakened and lost the decision.
Simmons won the bantamweight
title after going two and one-half fast
rounds with Freeman and knocking
him for the count of ten near the
close of the third. Freeman had the
edge in the first round but was hard
pressed in the last two from hooks to
the head and wind.
Miron took a close decision from
Ta.shjian in the featherweight class,
all three rounds being a steady ex
change of blows. The bout started fast
with Miron getting through Tashjian's
defense in the first round; the second
was even; and the third went to Miron
after he had reached his opponent's
head with right hooks oftener than
the latter had returned the favor.
The lightweight crown found its
resting place on Harward's brow after
he had given the game Goldwater a
bad trio of rounds. Goldwater remain
ed on the defensive for the better
part of two rounds, attempting a
comeback in the third, but he was
unable to stop a fiercer pounding from
Harward.
Injured Ribs Stops Parsons
Ribs injured in a previous fight
forced Parsons to give up in the sec
ond round of his bout with Martin.
Martin forced the fight at every turn
but Parsons managed to keep away
from his dangerous right, catching
only a few in the head until his in
juries forced him to stop.
Captain Irwin was compelled to go
an extra round with Adams to cinch
his claim to the junior middleweight
title. Adams developed unexpected
powers at the first of the bout and
throughout the entire three rounds
gave Irwin a good run for his money,
even taking the edge of the first one.
The third was possibly Irwin's when
he came to life and the extra fourth
was also declared his although it
looked even all around.
Farmin Goes Four Rounds
Farmin was another victor who wap
forced to go a fourth round to win,
his verdict being obtained over Van
Hook. Time after time Farmin jabbed
his right through Van Hook's weak
defense. A better use of his left gave
Van Hook the third round but the
fourth round and the bout went to
Farmin when he resumed his straight
punching tactics.
Hall, although he himself took quite
a bit of punishment, administered the
same treatment to McCallister in the

finals of the welterweight class and
won by a kayo in the last of the
fourth round. McCallister was dropped
once for the count of nine in this
round and the bout ended when ho
went down a second time. This was
the best fight of the evening.
Robinson took it easy and won the
decision over Huneke in the heavy
weight class. The latter winded him
self by starting at a fast clip but re
fused to take the final count, even
after going down once for the count
of seven. He tried a final comeback
in the third but was too weak and
Robinson cinched the title with a
number of strong jabs to wind and
face.
