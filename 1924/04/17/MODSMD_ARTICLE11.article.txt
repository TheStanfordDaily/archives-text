at a booth near the Romanic Lan
guages building, Friday, from 8 to
12:15, and all next week at the same
place. To vote, a coupon from the
Daily Palo Alto is necessary, plus a
cent for every vote filled in on the
coupon. Any number of votes may be
filled in. depending on the enthusiasm
and the financial condition of the
voter. Thus, one cent accompanying
the coupon will entitle the votee to
one vote, ten cents to ten votes, ten
dollars to get the idea?
After Friday's voting the list will be
cut down, and another reduction made
Monday, so as to reduce the list to
a place where some concentration is
possible.
