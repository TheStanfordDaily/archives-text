# PRINCIPALS, CHORUS OF 1925 OPERA CAST IN LIGHT WORKOUTS
## 
### Ross Urquhart 
"Remember," says Delmer Daves'
flamboyant multicolored poster on the
Engineers' Corner, "the Junior Opera
is Coming." Who could forget it? The
past successes and the present cast,
with its all-star formation and its un
excelled beauty and pony choruses
ought to keep people awake nights
awaiting its coming.
Every night in the Assembly hall
to the tune of "Chubby" Tyroler's
piano, the principals and members of
the three choruses are going through
a light workout preparatory to going
into heavy training.
The footwork of the men's chorus
is a bit heavy now, but in time the
uneven beating of the stage floor
boards will begin to take 011 the rhyth
mic response to a bunch of regular
stage-steppers. The raw material looks
good and both Gene Trago, -the direc
tor, and Eileen Eyre, the chorus di
rector, have expressed the idea that
it should mould itself into a "none
such" male chorus. Equally good are
the beauty and pony choruses.
As to those members of the cast
carrying the more important roles,
little need be said. Such familiar
names as Lloyd Nolan, Hollis Chal
mers, Delmer Daves, Dave Mannoccir,
Marjorie Allen, and Aileene Burks on
a program insures an exceedingly en
tertaining evening.
The stage settings promise to be
elaborate. One set lias already been
painted and, by its appearance, with
its drooping cocoanut trees forming
an arch overhead, suggests cases of
contraband liquor in the South Seas.
Final selections were made in the
make-up of the different choruses.
Men's Chorus

George Frazier, Thomas McCleave,

More than 11,000,000' liquor pre- j
scriptions were filled by druggists j
in the United States, Porto Rico and i
Hawaii last year.

Modern Chinese music is said to
approximate closely to the music of
ancient Greece.

"Remember," says Delmer Daves'
flamboyant multicolored poster on the
Engineers' Corner, "the Junior Opera
is Coming." Who could forget it? The
past successes and the present cast,
with its all-star formation and its un
excelled beauty and pony choruses
ought to keep people awake nights
awaiting its coming.
Every night in the Assembly hall
to the tune of "Chubby" Tyroler's
piano, the principals and members of
the three choruses are going through
a light workout preparatory to going
into heavy training.
The footwork of the men's chorus
is a bit heavy now, but in time the
uneven beating of the stage floor
boards will begin to take 011 the rhyth
mic response to a bunch of regular
stage-steppers. The raw material looks
good and both Gene Trago, -the direc
tor, and Eileen Eyre, the chorus di
rector, have expressed the idea that
it should mould itself into a "none
such" male chorus. Equally good are
the beauty and pony choruses.
As to those members of the cast
carrying the more important roles,
little need be said. Such familiar
names as Lloyd Nolan, Hollis Chal
mers, Delmer Daves, Dave Mannoccir,
Marjorie Allen, and Aileene Burks on
a program insures an exceedingly en
tertaining evening.
The stage settings promise to be
elaborate. One set lias already been
painted and, by its appearance, with
its drooping cocoanut trees forming
an arch overhead, suggests cases of
contraband liquor in the South Seas.
