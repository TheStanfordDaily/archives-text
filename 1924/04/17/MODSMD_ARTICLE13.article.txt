# Big Meet Results To Be Broadcasted By Oakland Tribune
## 
### 
Radio land fans will be in for a
treat on the afternoon of April 26,
The air will be impregnated with
achievements of Cardinal and Califor
nia track performers. Alumni from
both colleges will press the receivers
closer to their ears in an effort to get
everything that is going on, and all
they will lack, to see the dedication of
the new Stanford Stadium track, will
be the actual visionary reflex.
All of which condenses to the fact
that the Oakland Tribune has con
sented to send a detailed report of
the Big Meet over the "wide open
spaces" to satisfy those who will be
handicapped by distance, and those
who haven't the price.
