# RACQUET WIELDERS GETTING READY FOR BERKELEY MATCHES
## Three Veterans of Last Year's Varsity Numbered On Squad 
### 
The varsity tennis team left for San
Francisco early this afternoon for its
last two practices before the big match
on Saturday morning.
The five men on the team are: Cap
tain Mertz, Overfelt, Hinckley, Tus
sing, and de√üack. Although the play
ing order of the California men has
not yet been anounced, the team will
consist of Bettens, Weinstein, Chand
ler, and Stratford.
Three of these men are veterans of
last year's varsity, and the other,
Chandler, was captain of the freshman
team which won from Stanford in
1923. Bettens is the second ranking
junior player of the country. Wein
stein, who was beaten by Mertz in the
big match last year, has improved
greatly and is now the best man on
the squad.
After the match at Berkeley, there
will be but one more event on the
schedule, a clash with Southern
Branch, which will take place on the
following Tuesday. Owing to the pre
valence of the hoof and mouth disease,
the annual tournament at Ojai which
was to have been played April 24-26,
has been called off.
Stanford was to have been repre
sented in the southern tournament by
Mertz and Hinckley in the open sin
gles and doubles. This is the first time
in many years that this classic has not
been held. It is the greatest tennis
event of the West, and is second only
to Forrest Hills in national impor
tance.
