# 'WORLD COURTS NEEDED' CLAIMS DR. M.O.HUDSON
## Speaker Outlines Progress of Peace Movement in Last Fifty Years 
### 
Emphasizing the need of permanent,
non-political international courts to
maintain world peace. Dr. Manley O.
Hudson outlined the progress made
in the last fifty years of world peace
movement, when he spoke before the
University assembly this morning on
"Will the League of Nations Live?"
"International organization has two
objectives," said Professor Hudson.
"One of these is the formation of non
political bodies to maintain uniform
regulations for the mutual convenience
of the countries. The first of these was
the Universal Postal Union estab
lished in 1875. Later came the inter
national union of weights and meas
ures.
"The Permanent Court of Arbitra
tion that was formed was more a hope
of permanency than a reality.
Fifty Four Countries Join
"At the end of the war a definite
machinery for international conference
was set up in the League of Nations.
It was launched in the most troubled
world which history has known, with
faith lacking and hate rampant. Fifty
four countries responded in the at
tempt to win the world away from
war."
The League of Nations is the result
of conscious, intelligent effort without
which nothing is accomplished in any
situation. Though the next generation
may alter it and others change it en
tirely, Professor Hudson sees in it a
definite advance toward world peace.
