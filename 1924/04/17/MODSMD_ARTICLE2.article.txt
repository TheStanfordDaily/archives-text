# WEST, COTTRELL TO ATTEND CONFERENCE OF POLITICAL STUDY
## 
### 
At the second National Conference
on the Science of Politics to be held in
Chicago from September eighth to
twelfth. Professors Victor J. West and
E. A. Cottrell of the Political Science
will each be in charge of
a round table for discussion and re
search.
To Set Nominating Methods
West, head of the round table con
cerned with nominating methods in
last year's conference at Madison,
Wisconsin, will again preside over
that table.
Cottrell, member of the table deal
ing with political statistics, will this
year have charge of the group con
cerned with municipal administration,
â€¢with special reference to devising a
system for rating the effectiveness of
city government.
In working on nominating methods,
the round table last year tried to find
methods of testing a given system of
nominating public officers.
The purpose of the convention is to
develop the technique of politics in
order to be better equipped to solve
modern problems. It was organized in
1922, and at the first conference last
year twenty states and forty-two in
stitutions were represented. Delegates
were chosen from the membership of
the American Political Science Asso
ciation.
At the conference last year, West
and his colleagues planned nine dif
ferent tests, each of which was given
to one member of the discussion for
further work and research, so that
the meeting this year will consist
largely of reports of material and re
sults found.
