With the announcement that Scalpers will give a jolly-up in the
pavilion Saturday night, the old controversy springs up again.
The Daily Palo Alto believes that, in the past, those who have
opposed these affairs have made "much ado about nothing." Why anyone
should actively take issue against jolly-ups in general is a mystery.
Granted that there are objectionable features about the "knock 'em
down, drag 'em out"' policies employed in the past, but, no one is forced
to go. Stanford women certainly have minds of their own and if they
think that their rights are violated at a jolly-up, they have only to stay
away.
One or two suggestions in this connection might not be amiss. Two
or three practices which have been employed in the past might be
eliminated with very desirable results. For instance, the idea of lining
the women up on one side of the building and men on the other is bad.
In the ensuing rush and mad scramble, the women are jostled about like
cattle. An occasional straight dance would help out a great deal to
break the montony.
It seems a shame that such a democratic institution as the jolly-up
should receive such unfavorable publicity. The fact that the same
women go back time after time proves that the supposed "disgrace" is
not so bad after all. Of course, women are often forced to dance with
men who are not adept at the terpsichorean art, but they know before
they go what risks they are taking.
Now look at the other side. Quite often some of our best snakes
show poor judgment in making their selections, and they, too, are in
for a bad time. That makes that about even, for the men also know
their risks before they go.
The Daily believes that a jolly-up, as a rule, gives all of us a chance
to forget our dignity for a short time and get in and have a good time.
The admission price is never prohibitive, and campus togs help to make
the party a democratic one.
Let's get these foolish ideas out of our heads and try to make the
jolly-up Saturday night a successful one. Jolly-ups are made to be
enjoyedâ€”it's all in fun.
