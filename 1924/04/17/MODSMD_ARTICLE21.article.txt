# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT

Editor Daily Palo'Alto:
Dear Sir:
In view of the heavy demand for
Prom tickets I have a suggestion to
make to the committee. Why not hold
the Prom in two sections as is done
with large dances at California and
other schools? Either Encina hall or
the gymnasium could be used. The
pavilion floor would not be too crowded
as people would dance where there
was more room.
There are at least ten seniors or
holdovers in my own hall who could
not get tickets. It, is their last chance
to go to the Prom. Most of them have
had dates for some time. It is rather
hard on the girls who have turned
down dates for the Prom to be shut
out from going.
Men are offering $12.50 for tickets
to the Prom and none are to be had
even at that price. Ticket scalping
should be prevented on Prom tickets
as it is on football tickets.

The committee might offer 100 tick
ets as a minimum with money return
able if that number were not sold.
Prom the looks of the crowd yesterday
there would be no trouble in selling
300 more tickets. With the gradual in
crease in enrollment and the growing
popularity of dancing the situation is
going to be worse next year. Why not
find the remedy now?
Yours truly,
One who will not be here next year.
