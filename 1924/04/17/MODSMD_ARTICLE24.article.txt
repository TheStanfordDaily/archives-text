Bruins and Cardinals will battle in
the second game of their baseball
series at 3 o'clock Saturday on Cali
fornia field. The Blue and Gold ball
chasers nosed out Stanford last Satur
day in the ninth inning with two out,
to take the opening struggle with a
; 5 to 4 score.
Coach Zamloch's men will have a
decided edge over the lads from the
'Farm Saturday. The unexpected rally
of the Bears which brought victory
when it appeared to be a Stanford
Day on a track and diamond could not
help but demoralize the Cardinals to
a certain extent. In addition, the
Bruins have the habit of losing open
ing contests and then coming back to
win championships. Stanford will find
it rather difficult to tie the series since
California pitchers and players have
, sampled the best Stanford has to of
j fer. At the same time the Bears failed
to give an inkling of even ordinary
hitting form, except in the pinches.
Coach Zamloch has not decided defi
nitely upon the twirler to start the
game as yet. Jack Nounan, the Bruins'
best, will probably start if his sore
arm will permit, while Toomey, Minty,
and Mitchell may be called upon to
j do the pitching. Loynd or Russell will
j function behind the bat.
