## GOING TO THE DOGS 
### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Tyrus Raymond Cobb, at the start of his 20th season in the big leagues,
announces that it will be his last. He will retire as a player and probably
spend a lot of his time with his four healthy youngsters and his famous dogs.
The Tiger manager already holds more individual records than any other ball
player who ever lived. Among his performances are those of playing in more
games and having a higher lifetime batting average than any other major
league player. He has also scored more runs, made more hits, made more
singles and triples, and stolen more bases than any other big leaguer. Then,
too, he holds numerous records for the American league.
