The number of tennis courts available
at the University nowhere equals the
demand, particularly for some hours
of the day. A large number of men
have signed up for tennis, both for the
fulfillment of the Physical Education
requirement and also for credit as
members of the varsity tennis squad.
A real effort is being made, this year
for the first time, to develop general
interest in tennis in an organized way
and under some sort of supervision.
This is, of course, essential if tennis
material in the University is going to
be found and developed. This use of
the courts for organized classes obvi
ously makes it impossible to accom
modate all the men who wish to play
at odd times, not as members of
classes. For the benefit of these men
the following hours are designated at
which time the courts will be open

for general use:
Daily—B to 11 a.m.
Tuesday and Thursday 11 to 12 a.m.
Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday
—5 to 6 p.m.
Saturday—all day.
At all other times the courts must
be reserved for the use of the regular
classes and it is suggested that men,
not members of these classes, who
desire to play, arrange their matches
so that there will be no further con
flict.
W. H. BARROW, M.D., Director.
