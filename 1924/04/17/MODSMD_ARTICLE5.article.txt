## El Tigre, Phi Gamma, Sequoia One, Los Arcos Win by One-Sided Scores 
### 
Three intramural baseball teams
won their second successive games
'yesterday; El Tigre defeated Delta
lipsilon, 8 to 1; Sequoia First swamped
Encina Third, 30 to 1; and Los Arcos
downed Kappa Alpha, 14 to 4. In the
1 other contest, Phi Gamma Delta
trounced Alpha Sigma Phi, 16 to 2.
Newton, El Tigre heaver, was large
ly responsible for the clubmen's vie
i tory, fanning 14 men and allowing but
one hit. Hubbard, of Delta Upsilon,
bingled in the first and went the rest
lof the way on infield errors, chalking
up D. U.'s only tally.
Atwill, D. U.'s chucker, took a cou
ple of rounds to warm up, in which
lEI Tigre garnered six runs. He then
; steadied, and but two more men
' crossed the pan.
i Sequoia First's heavy hitters had no
j trouble finding Weber, the hurler for
| Encina Third. Sequoia's first three
| men up got on base, and then Thomp
j son belted a homer.
In the second. Sequoia batted around
twice, Thompson again knocking a
| four-bagger with the bases crowded,
j The game was called at the end of
the fifth.
Los Arcos scored in every frame
against Kappa Alpha. The clubmen
i got on the long end of a 4 to 1 score
| in the first, and continued at the same
rate. Morrison, Los Arcos twirler, held
I K. A. to five hits, with four runs.
The Fijis put their game with Alpha
Sigma Phi on ice in the first frame,
more than batting around, and scoring
a total of seven runs. The game was |
slow until the fourth, when, with two
down, Riter started a rally for Alpha
Sigma Phi by getting hit with a j
pitched ball. Payne, following Riter, j
was also hit, and Pastorius walked, 1
filling the bases. But the budding rally j
was nipped when Stewart fanned.
Tomorrow's games: Tlieta Delta
Chi vs. Delta Tau Delta; El Capitan ,
vs. Chi Psi; Theta Xi vs. Breakers.

The Gideons, since 1899, have placed
