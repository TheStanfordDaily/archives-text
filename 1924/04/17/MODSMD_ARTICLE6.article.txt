# PHOTOGRAPHY GAINING PROFESSIONAL FAVOR
## 
### 
i Photography, though still in its
youth, has shown a great development
;as an industry, according to a recent
article in the News-Bulletin of the
Bureau of Vocational Information.
Women have played a large part in
its growth, ever since the time of
Mrs. Julia Margaret Cameron, out
j standing figure in the early history
iof photography in England. Her suc
; cess, hampered as she was by crude
methods, is a proof of the worth of the
jprofession.
A classification of the ways in which
, photography may be applied include
portrait, commercial, architectural,
and photographic finishing. The first
is the most popular branch and,
! though it requires considerable equip
ment, an ingenious person may save
1 considerably on the outlay.
Photography has become indispensi
ble in medical practice. During the
| war many women put their profes
sional experience to good use in the
j hospitals.
It is recommended by the writer of
! the article that women intending to
enter the profession should attend a
photographic school, to gain the funda
mentals. A knowledge of art is also
essential.
