# VARSITY BALL NINE DEFEATS FRESHMEN
## Coach Harry Wolter Pitches For Regulars and Beats Yearlings, 5 to 2 
### 
Coach Harry Wolter pitched the
varsity ball team to a victory over
the freshman nine in a six-inning game
yesterday. The final score was 5-2.
From a standpoint of showing what
men on the '27 team are likely pros
pects for next year's varsity, the game
was especially interesting.
Jerry Stewart, captain of the first
year club, played a steady game in
left field. Steve Collins, in the box,
hurled a good game against his older
opponents, and looks to be a cinch
for a position on Wolter's staff next
season.
Bailard, behind the bat, is another
freshman who showed up well. He
handled Collins' curves in nice style
and has a good throwing arm.
The freshmen got a flock of hits
off Wolter but failed to connect when
hits meant runs.
Today the varsity meets the second
string men in a short game. Wolter
expects to give all of the flingers on
the squad a workout, which means
that at least five men will have a
turn in the box.
Plenty of opportunity to practice
fielding is being afforded all the play
ers on the squad. If practice makes
perfect, the Stanford team should play
errorless ball against California next
Saturday, in the second game of the
series. And if the Cards do get through
the contest without bobbles, the Bears
are due for a beating.
