# FOUR FULLBACKS TO MAKE 1924 ELEVEN A REAL JUGGERNAUT
## 
### 
Coach Glenn "Pop" Warner's 1924
Stanford varsity football eleven will
have one of the most powerful full
backs in the country, to wit, Ernest
Nevers.
Nevers, last year, although ouly a
sophomore, achieved the distinction of
being one of the two coast men to
receive places on Walter Camp's
mythical all-American selections. Ac
cording to this, Nevers is the third
best in America. But the remarkable
thing is, that he has two more football
seasons to improve in.
Nevers Is Varsity Star
Nevers was without doubt the star
of the varsity last season. Sixty-yard
punts, followed by long smashes
through the line, were his favorite
dish. As for defensive, nothing got by
him.
In the California game Nevers came
dangerously near making more yards
than all the California backs com
bined. And yet he was playing the
game with injuries.
Nevers is the type of fullback that
cannot be stopped by anything short
of a brick wall. And even then he
might make a yard or two.
Solomon Good on Defense
Besides Nevers, there are several
other fullbacks above average ability.
Solomon, although not in Nevers' 208-
pound clas, is chunky, and a great line
plunger. He is especially effective on
the defense, and used largely for this
purpose.
Kelly is a twisting line-plunger who
should show great development under
the coaching of Warner. Leaving his
tracks at almost a dead run, he is al
ways sure of a yard or two before
being downed.
