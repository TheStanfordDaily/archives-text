# BRUIN TRACKSTERS TACKLE ILLINOIS RUNNERS TOMORROW
## 
### 
Coach Walter Christie will have a
chance to see what his Blue and Gold
track team can do against first class
competition tomorrow at 1:30 when
the Bears meet the University of Illi
nois aggregation on the California
oval.
The result of the Stanford-California
meet will hinge materially on the per
formances of several of the California
athletes against the eastern team. One
sport writer has it figured out that
California can win by a narrow margin
if a half a dozen of the Bears do a
little better in the Big meet than they
can reasonably be expected to do.
Whether or not these men have the
stuff in them will be seen tomorrow.
