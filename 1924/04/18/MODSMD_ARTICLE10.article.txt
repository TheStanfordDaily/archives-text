# BRUIN TRACKSTERS TACKLE ILLINOIS RUNNERS TOMORROW
## 
### 
Coach Walter Christie will have a
chance to see what his Blue and Gold
track team can do against first class
competition tomorrow at 1:30 when
the Bears meet the University of Illi
nois aggregation on the California
oval.
The result of the Stanford-California
meet will hinge materially on the per
formances of several of the California
athletes against the eastern team. One
sport writer has it figured out that
California can win by a narrow margin
if a half a dozen of the Bears do a
little better in the Big meet than they
can reasonably be expected to do.
Whether or not these men have the
stuff in them will be seen tomorrow.
Jensen Best Two-Miler
Jensen is one of "Brick" Morse's
hopes. He has been Hearing the 10:00
mark jn the two-mile, hut he will have
to get down to 9:55 or better if he is
to beat A1 Charles and Bill Kerr. Jen- |
sen will have all the competition he 1
wants in the person of Mieher, the
Illinois record-bolder, who is capable
of 9:41.
Morse also figures that Jim Barber,
Christie's phenomenal sprinter, can
beat Marshal Hale, and in addition,
that Shepard and Farnsworth can also i
turn the trick. If Barber hopes to beat |
Hale April 26 he must outrun Evans j
and Ayres of Illinois tomorrow. Evans [
has been doing 0:09 4-5, and so Barber
will have quite a task ahead of him.
Boh Hurst, in the quarter, must show
that he can finish the quarter-mile
under 0:50 seconds tomorrow if lie
wants to place in the quarter against j
Miller, Van Judah, and Storie.
These are only a few of the Cali
fornia men whom the San Francisco
writer picks to show up better than
the Cardinal runners if the Bruins are
to win the meet.
Walter Christie is one of the most 1
successful track coaches in the United
Statues and lie has developed stars al- |
most overnight in the past, but it must
be held in mind that "Dink" Temple
ton is just as expert.
