# SECOND CONTEST OF BEAR-CARD DIAMOND SERIES TOMORROW
## Varsity Beats Second Team In Practice Featured By Heavy Hitting 
### 
With the second game of the Cali
fornia series scheduled for tomorrow,
the Stanford varsity ball nine has
been spending its time in getting set
for a real battle.
A seven inning game between the
varsity and second team yesterday
showed that the regulars are just a bit
better than the Yannigans. The hit
ting was up to the standard that has
been set in the last few games.
And speaking of hitting, the Card
sluggers are pounding the ball harder,
and with greater frequency, at the
present time than they have all during
the season.
In yesterday's contest, four pitchers
shared the mound, each hurling for
both teams during short periods.
Teague started the game, and was fol
lowed in order by Oviatt, Solomon,
and Lowenstein.
Kohler, catcher for the second team,
came to bat in the fifth and slammed
out a homer, scoring one man ahead
of him and tying the score.
"Bus" McCandless duplicated his
feat for the varsity in the next inning,
and counted the runs that won the
game.
Jim Lawson and "Chuck" Johnston
worked behind the bat, Lawson start
ing the contest and "Chuck" relieving
him in the fourth.
Kohler and King showed up well as
the backstops for the second team.
While hits were frequent during the
contest, the team still shows a ten
dency to boot the ball around the
field. If that fault can be corrected,
the Card sluggers should pound
enough runs to win.
Nevers will probably start against
the Bears Saturday, and will be op
posed by either Toomey or Minty.
