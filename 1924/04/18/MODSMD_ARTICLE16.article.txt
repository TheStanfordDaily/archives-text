## 
### 
The Union Court fountain, which is
only temporarily completed at the
present time, will be in entire readi
ness for University Day. By that time
the new castings are expected to have
been put in place, and the regular
water flow turned on.
Experiments have just been com
pleted by A. Banham of the Mechani
cian Shop, and the order for the cast
ing placed with the Hendy Iron
Works. The finished casting is ex
pected to arrive any day now.
A six-inch model, one-third the size
of the main one, was made at an ap
proximate cost of $100. The experi
ment proved successful. A circular
spray head with many nozzles will
shoot the water four or five feet into
the air to a central point, from which
it will fall in a mass.
A colored electric light will be
placed in the center, making what is
expected to be a very beautiful effect.
