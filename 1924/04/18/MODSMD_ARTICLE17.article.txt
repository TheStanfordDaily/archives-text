# STANFORD-CALIFORNIA NET MATCH TOMORROW
## 
### 
Stanford's tennis team will play its
big match of the year tomorrow morn
ing at 10 o'clock on the varsity courts
at Berkeley.
California has one of the strongest
teams in its history, including Bettens,
Weinstein, Chandler, and Stratford.
While the odds are slightly In favor
of California, Stanford has a team
that is above average, and an upset in
the dope is not at all unlikely.
Captain Ted Mertz won his match
from Weinstein last year, but whether
he can do so again is a matter of con
jecture. Ex-Captain Dick Hinckley has
been steadily improving of late, and
hopes to make his last appearance on
the varsity a revenge for his last year's
defeat.
Harold Overfelt, who has recently
developed from a fair player to the
best man on the squad, has a good
chance of winning his match. He plays
a strong, brilliant game that promises
to make him a player of note before
he graduates.
In the doubles, Stanford is fortunate
in having two sets of men whose
strongest point is teamwork, although
they are all good individual players.
Mertz and Hinckley, the first pair,
have already played together for two
years, and cover the court as one man.
Tussing and de√üack, the other pair,
won their match last year and are in
better form than ever.
Bettens, the California captain,
holds a long string of titles, chief
among which is that of second ranking
junior in the United States. He is a
player of long experience and great
natural ability. Irving Weinstein has
developed during the past year until
he has recently been beating Bettens.
Chandler was captain of the 1923
freshman team and won his match
against Stanford. Stratford played in
the doubles last year and has also
been improving greatly.
