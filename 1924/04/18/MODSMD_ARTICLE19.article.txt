# BERKELEYITES DOWNCAST OVER TRACK PROSPECTS

(Daily Californian)
Although California's varsity track
squad has been improving with each
meet and to date has retrieved much
of its waning prestige, there is still
much to be hoped for if the Bruins
expect to take the annual Big Meet
against Stanford.
Coach Walter Christie started out
the preliminary training season with
only a shattered remnant of his last
year's formidable array of track talent
and has been forced to devote practi
cally his entire time to developing
green material.
With but little competitive practice,
the Bears stepped t>ut in their initial j
meet to clown the Trojans by a small !
margin, but in the Olympic Club affair I
last, Saturday they began to show J
symptoms of their real strength by !
snowing the clubmen under a 74 1-2 to j
56 1-2 score.
The Bruins apparently are not as l
weak in the track events as they first i
appeared. Jim Barber, who ran for ,
the frosh team last year without at- j
trading particular attention, has been

clipping off the century in 0:9 9-10 con-;
sistently of late, as well as making the ,
furlong in 0:21 4-5. With his team
mate, Shepherd, who has been close !
behind him in every race, they con
stitute a pair of sprinters that will
certainly make things interesting for i
Hale and Campbell on April 26.

The quarter seems to be one of the
weak spots on the Bruin squad, as j
Hurst, Aggeler, and Goertz have yet
to step the distance in anywhere near
winning time. However, Hurst showed
a marked improvement Saturday when
he took a close second to "Racehorse"
Cochran, former intercollegiate title- 1
holder, who is considered one of the
best in this event on the coast. This ,
fact does not speak well for the relay. 1
and as Coach Dink Templeton has j
plenty of good 440 men, the Cardinals i
will probably have little difficulty tak-1
ing the latter race.
As yet no exceptional times have j
been turned in in the distance events. 1
Dunn and Boss are the outstanding
tnilers. Art Jensen is going strong in j
the two-mile, and Charles will have I
