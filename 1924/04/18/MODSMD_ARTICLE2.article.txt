# JUNIORS, SENIORS OPEN INTERCLASS TENNIS APRIL 28
## 
### 
Interclass tennis starts a week from
Monday when the Juniors meet the
Seniors on the varsity courts.
Eight men will constitute a team.
All teams, with the exception of the
seniors, have been named, and the
later will be posted in the gym this
week.
Any man in the class will have the
privilege of challenging the players
lor their place on the team during the
next week, but at the end of that time
definite teams for interclass competi
tion will be posted. All men registered
in the University are eligible to play,
except freshmen and varsity men mak
ing their numeral or letter this year.
Each team will play three singles
and four doubles matches. A new regu
lation, giving seven points to a team
winning by default, makes it necessary
for the teams to be composed of eight
men. In the past, three men have been
chosen and three singles and one
doubles played.
Class numerals will be awarded to
the winning teams and the final stand
ing will count toward the Interclass
Trophy for the year.
The teams so far chosen are: Jun
iors: Overfelt, Davidson, Murphy, Wil
lis, Aydelott, and Loxan. Freshmen:
Kurihara/ Gardner, Baer, Newhouse,
Todd, Anawalt, Osthaus, and McCray.
Sophomores: Fairchild, Coffin, Mc-
Cleave, Ogden, Oatman, Weigel, Frank
lin, Welch.
