# Go Get 'Em!

Tomorrow morning, students will have their last opportunity to buy
rooters' tickets for the Big Meet.
From the dope sheets which have been pouring into the Daily
office every day, the student body, as a whole, is confident that the
Stanford varsity is going to win, and by a good margin. In view of
this fact, the rooting section should be packed with Cardinal rooters.
The Big Meet should be the greatest track duel in the history of
Stanford-California varsity competition. Some of the best performers
in the United States will be seen in action. That meet is not going to
be a walkaway for cither team.
At present, Stanford has the edge. However, the California track
athletes have been coming to the front fast. The Illinois-California
battle tomorrow will give Cardinal supporters a pretty definite idea of
what the Bears can do. Christie's team is going to have a hard time in
that meet, for the Illini come to the Pacific Coast with an enviable
reputation.
If California wins tomorrow, the Card tracksters will have their
hands full on April 26. If Illinois wins, it does not mean much, for the
Golden Bear always puts forth his best efforts against Stanford.
Regardless of what happens, the Big Meet next Saturday is going
to be well worth watching. Those who view it from the rooting section
may have a chance to serpentine. At all events, it is the duty of every
loyal Stanford man and woman to be there to support the varsity and
help out with the bleacher stunts.
BETTER PART WITH THAT DOLLAR BEFORE IT IS
TOO LATE!

Woe be unto the poor unfortunate who postpones his studying until
next week-end, if he intends to get very much done. University Day, the
P>ig Meet, the high school meet, two baseball games, and other attrac
tions should combine to make those few days the most enjoyable of the
year .
MORAL—GET SOME STUDYING DONE THIS WEEK.
