# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT
## 
### 
The Editor, Daily Palo Alto.
Dear Sir:
There are several things which I
wish to say in answer to "One who
will not be here next year;" may I use
your "Viewpoint" column to get them
to his attention?
First: It is a pleasure to find ONE
"Another Viewpoint" containing really
well-meant and constructive critcisin.
Second: The Prom Committee has
considered the very suggestion made
in last night's Daily but has decided
that it would not be practical because:
(1) No one would want to confine his
time to a secondary Prom, and not get
even a look-in at the "big tent." (2) If
people from such an overflow dance
WERE allowed to come into the pa
vilion, it would crowd those who
bought tickets of the first issue on the
understanding that their number was
strictly limited. (3) The overhead cost
and labor by Junior required to pre
pare for another dance would be so
great that it would not bo feasible to
put one on unless a number of tickets
equal to that of the first dance were

sold. (4) Programs have long since
been ordered from the East, and an
"imported" orchestra engaged; to
throw more tickets for another so
called Prom on the market would
cheapen what has been, and, we hope,
will be this year, the best dance of the
college year.
Third: The other members of the
Committee and I will be glad to dis
cuss the question further with you,
and with any of the many men who
have been disappointed in not secur
ing this year's Prom tickets. We have
willingly sacrificed the space in the
pavilion for seats to accommodate ath
letic crowds, now that the basketball
season is over and Junior Week ap
proaching, a few are having to stand
the brunt of the unpleasantness of that
sacrifice.
The only response the Prom Com
mittee feel they can give to your plea
and those of the other people who
were turned away is one in which you
can whole-heartedly "join in on the
chorus
"I'm sorry,"
