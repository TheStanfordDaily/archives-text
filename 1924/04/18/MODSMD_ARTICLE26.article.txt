Well, now that bidding is over, we
expect to see the various houses re
turn to normal. We always did think
that beans and hamburger were appe
tizing, anyway.
Frank —Do you mind if I smoke?
Frances —Why, I don't care if you
burn.

Little drinks of alcohol,
Little sips of gin
Make a regular frat man
Out of lots of men.

Algernon —Are you on your way to
Siam?
Joseph—Yes, Siam.
Which reminds us of the Ancient
Order of Siam.

That poem about a moustache the
other day Was good, but like all good
things, it reminds of another, one by
Malt Wason:
"Oh insufferable agony.
Oh immortal feeling of impotence.
Why have the gods marked me for
their fate?
Why should I be so weak and helpless?
Why, 1 cannot even raise
A moustache like the girl behind me!"

Lagnuita may be dry, but there is
no reason for it to spread through
these columns as it undoubtedly has.
But then, an onion by another name
would smell as sweet.

The valley's filled with trees so green,
The lake is full of water serene (like
'ell),
The wind is filled with joyous tunes,
And as for me, I'm full of prunes.

Under the spreading chestnut tree
The village smithy is seen
He is the town bootlegger now
And gathers in long green.
