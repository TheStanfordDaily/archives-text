# FORMER STANFORD MAN SOLVES TRAFFIC CONDITIONS IN U. S.
## 
### 
What is considered the best contribu
tion to the subject of the solution of
American traffic problems has just been
received from Miller McClintock, former
instructor on the English department,
and now Sheldon Research Fellow in the
Department of Government at Harvard
University. For the past three years
McClintock has been conducting a coun
try-wide survey of traffic conditions in
all the leading cities in an endeavor to
derive some formulae which would read
ily apply to a solution of all kinds of
traffic crises.
The unheard of numbers of our auto
mobiles naturally clutter up the streets,
and if Henry Ford's prophecy that eco
nomic saturation will not be reached un
til the present number has been doubled
is true, it io clear thyt some definite so
lution of this problem iff of vital im
portance.
Mere number of automobiles, how
ever, is not as important as the time
element involved. McClintock defines
congestion as "retardation or obstruction
to normal required law of traffic." Thus
it is evident that high density does not
cause congestion provided it is accom
panied by a high discharge factor. A
satisfactory traffic situation exists when
the existing number of automobiles can
move in all available street area in a de
sired length of time. Although ele
mentary in nature, this statement relates
to three variables: (1) Time Factor;
(2 )Street Area; (3) Vehicular Require
ments. A disturbance of any one of
these elements, as too slow a movement
or too small a street area, makes con
gestion.
