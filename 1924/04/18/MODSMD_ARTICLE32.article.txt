## 
### 
Twenty of the 22,000 plans for in
ternational peace which were sub
mitted during the Bok Peace Plan con
test were discussed and briefly sum
marized by I)r. Jordan last evening.
It was from these twenty, which were
considered the best submitted, that
the winning plan was selected.
"The plan suggested by Charles Her
bert Levermore, secretary of the New
York Peace Society and winner of the
$50,000 prize, advised the United
States to say just what it objected to
in the League of Nations and after the
imperfections were corrected, to join
it. His idea of a League of Na
tions was similar to that suggested by
many of the contestants," said Dr.
Jordan.
William Culbertson, tariff commis
sioner, advised a peace conference to
straighten out disagreements. "Close
ly resembling this was my own plan
for a bureau of conciliation," asserted
Dr. Jordan.
Gutzon Borglum, a prominent sculp
tor, suggested in his essay that a
League of Nations take control of all
the great international waterways.
"There is no reason," said Dr. Jordan,
"why these great waterways should
be under the control of one govern
ment."
Another novel plan was submitted
by Professor Wilson, a research chem
ist, in which he favored the calling
together by the government of the
leading chemists and physicists of the
world who were to be banded together
in an agreement not to make chemi
cals which might be used in war.
"The president of Bryn Mawr," said
Dr. Jordan, "suggested that the United
States issue a declaration of interde
pendence to outlaw war, while Charles
Brent, Bishop of West New York, made
an appeal to the church and favored
international co-operation in a world
court."
