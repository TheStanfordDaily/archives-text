# TRACK SHE GUESSES GIVE CARDS VICTORY
## 
### 
Every Big Meet score prediction so
far turned in for the Daily Palo Alto's
prize contest picked the Stanford team
to win by a top-heavy score.
The student, rough, co-ed, house
mother, faculty member, graduate, or
whoever it is that comes nearest to
guessing the final score of the big
classic will be given two tickets to
the Junior Opera. Summaries will be
received at the Daily Palo Alto office
until Thursday night. The winner will
be announced in the issue of April 28.
Several final scores have already
been received which correspond, the
Daily Palo Alto suggests that contest
ants include with their point summary
the names of the men who will place
in each event.
As previously announced, contest
ants may enter two summaries pro
vided that one of them was received
at the Daily office last night. Accord
ingly, the authors of the guesses al
ready received may submit another
summary next week.
