Every Big Meet score prediction so
far turned in for the Daily Palo Alto's
prize contest picked the Stanford team
to win by a top-heavy score.
The student, rough, co-ed, house
mother, faculty member, graduate, or
whoever it is that comes nearest to
guessing the final score of the big
classic will be given two tickets to
the Junior Opera. Summaries will be
received at the Daily Palo Alto office

at the Daily office last night. Accord

ready received may submit another
summary next week.
