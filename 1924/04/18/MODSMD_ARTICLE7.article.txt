Spectator will appear at all campus
news stands Monday morning, devoted
primarily to track, with a special
cover on the subject.
The last survey before the Big Meet
is by Norris James. A double-page
track picture accompanies the article.
Swimming for the past two months
is reviewed. A schedule to be followed
by the team for the next quarter is
to be included in the story.
The secondary feature of the num
ber will be a campus Hall of Fame
entitled "Spectator Considers." This
is a symposium of cartoons of noted
Stanford men and wo me n .
Famous men and women such as A1
Masters, Jim Lawson, Aileene Burks,
and Miriam Hilton will no doubt buy
copies.
"The Seamy Side of Paradise," an
anonymous short story, a short alle
gory, poems, editorials, and book re
views will complete the issue. The
frontispiece, a pen and ink sketch, was
drawn especially for the Spectator by
Les Kiler.
