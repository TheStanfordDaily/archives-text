### Paul Wayte 
Second game of the Stanford fresh
man-California Cub series will be
played on the University of California
baseball field tomorrow morning a(
10 o'clock.
Coach "Husky" Hunt's aggregation
will attempt to redeem themselves af
ter a 5-4 defeat last Saturday at the
hands of "Neb" Price's proteges. By
virtue of their victory last Saturday,
the Berkeley nine is conceded a slight
edge over the Cardinal babes.
New Battery Will Start
Hunt will start either Riese or Ost
haus in the box with Bailard behind
the bat. "Steve" Collins, who pitched
last Saturday, will be on the bench
ready to relieve in case these pitchers
cannot hold the Cubs.
Osthaus and Riese have both showed
themselves to be more than mediocre
during the preliminary season. Riese
seems to be a little more dependable
of the two although Osthaus pitches
the best game w-ien lie ?s nitting his
stride.
During the past week Coach Hunt's
squad has been in a slump. Their
showing against the Stockton high
school nine last Tuesday was weak. If
this condition is not remedied before
tomorrow they will prove easy meat
tor the Bears.
According to the preliminary results
the Stanford nine is a little the
superior team. California frosh have
won 15 games out of 17 played while
Stanford has won 14 games and lost
two. Alameda and U. C. Dental Col
lege have defeated Price's nine, and
while the Cardinal yearlings were beat
by Alameda they succeeded in beat
ing the U. C. Dental diamond artists
twice. Their second defeat was by San
Mateo high in the first game of the
season.

hit in four times to bat, while Linquist

twice. Their second defeat was by San
Mateo high in the first game of the
season.
Frosh Good Hitters
Hunt has one of the hardest-hitting
nines that have represented a fresh
man class for a number of years. Out
of 8 hits Saturday, they made two two
base hits and one three-bagger. Mack
ersie made two singles and a two-base
hit in four times to bat, while Linquist
made a two-base hit and a single out
of five times to bat.
In the game Tuesday with Stockton
high school the babes made 14 hits,
including four home-runs, two two
base hits, and S singles. Linquist bat
ted highest in this game with a home
run and two singles in five times at
bat.
Second game of the Stanford fresh
man-California Cub series will be
played on the University of California
baseball field tomorrow morning a(
10 o'clock.
Coach "Husky" Hunt's aggregation
will attempt to redeem themselves af
ter a 5-4 defeat last Saturday at the
hands of "Neb" Price's proteges. By
virtue of their victory last Saturday,
the Berkeley nine is conceded a slight
edge over the Cardinal babes.
New Battery Will Start
Hunt will start either Riese or Ost
haus in the box with Bailard behind
the bat. "Steve" Collins, who pitched
last Saturday, will be on the bench
ready to relieve in case these pitchers
cannot hold the Cubs.
Osthaus and Riese have both showed
themselves to be more than mediocre
during the preliminary season. Riese
seems to be a little more dependable
of the two although Osthaus pitches
the best game w-ien lie ?s nitting his
stride.
During the past week Coach Hunt's
squad has been in a slump. Their
showing against the Stockton high
school nine last Tuesday was weak. If
this condition is not remedied before
tomorrow they will prove easy meat
tor the Bears.
According to the preliminary results
the Stanford nine is a little the
superior team. California frosh have
won 15 games out of 17 played while
Stanford has won 14 games and lost
two. Alameda and U. C. Dental Col
lege have defeated Price's nine, and
while the Cardinal yearlings were beat
by Alameda they succeeded in beat
ing the U. C. Dental diamond artists
twice. Their second defeat was by San
Mateo high in the first game of the
season.
