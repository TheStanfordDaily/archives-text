Are Yon a
Winner—
for a Loser?
T7OU have undoubtedly
' S chosen to be a winner.
1 You are training your mind
. ! and strengthening your
; I will.
But what of your body?
1 1 Will it sustain you when
tlie race becomes fast and
strenuous?
To keep in a winning condition, you must
exercise every muscle and organ in the body.
The fuel-supplying organs —the stomach and
the digestive organs —need exercise in the
form of digesting rough foods such as: whole
wheat bread, bran, and hard cereals.
Grape-Nuts not only exercises these fuel
supplying organs, but its nutritive elements
of whole-wheat and malted barley, toasted to
a nutty crispness, make it the most delicious
breakfast food you have ever tasted.
For a well-balanced diet, try Grape-Nuts
—four teaspoonfuls sprinkled with sugar,
half cream and half milk. You wiH call for
it every morning. There s a reason.
