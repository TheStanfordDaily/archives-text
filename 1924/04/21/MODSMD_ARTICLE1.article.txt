# CHARLES K. FIELD TO BE SPEAKER AT FRIDAY ASSEMBLY
## Poet of Pioneer Class Will Read Poems of Stanford Student Life 
### 
"Dinosaur's Eggs, a Nest of Stanford
Verses," is the cryptic and depreca
tory title that Charles K. Field, '95, j
has given to the University assembly
at which he will be the chief figure,
Friday morning at 10 o'clock. Field
is, among other present-day activities,!
a member of the Stanford National
Board, which will be on the campus
Friday for its first meeting since its
creation. But as a member of the
"Pioneer Class" he was the recognized
college poet of Stanford during the
first four years of the Unive-sity's i
existence. The "Dinosaur's Eggs" are j
some of the verses reflecting student
life that he wrote then and will read
Friday.
To Read Poems
The assembly is the result of a
â€¢desire repeatedly expressed by a num-j
ber of alumni that Field read some of
This poems to undergraduates of today \
to show that the Stanford of that day
and this are the same in student spirit
and attitude toward life. The day of
the Stanford National Board meeting,
being just before University Day, with
its hundreds of returning alumni,
seemed particularly appropriate.
Dr. Jordan to Introduce Fieid
Dr. Jordan, who wrote an introduc
tion to a collection of Field's verses, |
published under the title, "Four-;
Leaved Clover," will introduce him,
and Shirley Baker, '95, will sing "The
Ideal Co-Ed," a number he sang in the!
first Junior Opera at Stanford, written
by Field. Baker and Field will also |
sing "In the Cold, Cold World," a
mournful duet about alumni, which i
they have sung hundreds of times:
before.
