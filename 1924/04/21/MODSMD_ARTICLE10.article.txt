# OPERA TICKETS ARE INCENTIVE TO ENTER MEET DOPE CONTEST
## 
### 
Why stand in line half the afternoon
trying to get tickets for the Junior opera,
only to find that nothing better than the
last row is obtainable once the ticket
window is reached ?
There is absolutely no reason in the
world for doing it because Roos Brothers
are going to give two tickets, located in
the best part of the house, to the winner
of the Daily Palo Alto's Big Meet score
guessing contest.
Everyone Eligible
Anyone is eligible to participate, and
someone is bound to get the tickets. Per
haps it will be you so get out your
Ouiji Board, find out the winner, and
send your guess to the Dope Contest
Editor of the Daily Palo Alto.
As most of the entrants in the contest
have been picking Stanford's score to be
spirit of joy is swallowed up in the mob.
That is why only a limited number of
tickets will go on sale tomorrow at 1
o'clock downstairs in the Administration
building: 300 of 'emâ€”that's all. Take
your razor along with you and line up
early, for the demand for the coveted
admissions is heavy. Two simoleons in
gold, silver, or currency, admit one couple
to the festivities.
Costumes for the dancc will be on dis
play in the pavilion tomorrow and Wed
nesday from 1:30 to 4:30. Take your
choice!
