From a brawny, picturesque, medieval
Norman king to an arrogant and bom
bastic rajah, a ferocious looking Turk, a
truculent savage, and magnificent cour
tiers and ladies of the French court of
Louis XIV, the Masque Ball Friday eve
| ning will be replete with colorful char-
J acters.
Portuguese, Argentines, and Greeks,
j Egyptians, Californians, and shieks —
I every historic character in world history
| will have a representative. What a
| grandios and glorious spectacle it will
all be—just as if a history lx>ok were
opened to allow troop after troop of fa
mous men and women to sep forth to
participate in a wild revel just for one
night, and then to return to the moth
eaten pages of antiquity.
Carnival Spirit to Reign
All the world will be gathered to
gether to witness the coronation of the
potentatious King and Queen of Merri
ment—sophistication will be discarded
as masqued couple after masqued couple
shout out their joy and mix in the fun.
And the pavilion will quake and tremble
when the spirit of carnival increases
crescendo-like as the evening wears on.
For the annual Masque .Ball is really
to happen. All the counts and no accounts
will be there, and the ladies of the court
will titter merrily as they watch the rol

licking antics of their Majesties. Merry
makers and "roughs" alike may cat right
copiously of the ambrosial delights and
sacharriue sweets in profusion every
where about them.
Entertainment on Program
Four acts of snappy vaudeville by the
best of campus talent, including some
chorus numbers, will amuse the dancers
from 11 o'clock on. "Hock" Chalmers is
working up this end of the program, and
something new and novel is promised.
As for the decorations —hold your
breath when you go in. The interior of
the pavilion is going to look like a thou
sand rainbows, and an intricate lighting
arrangement will emphasize the spirit of
Mardi Gras even more.
As for music—there's going to be ten
pieces, and the syncopators have already
gone into training for this one event.
Everything is being arranged to give
the campus the best evening ever, and a
person will have to be hopelessly dead if
he attends the Masque and doesn't jump
into the fun with both feet just as soon
as he arrives.
