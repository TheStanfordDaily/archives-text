# We're Just Wild About Harry
## 
### 
Coach Harry Wolter's Stanford varsity baseball team scored an im
pressive victory over its California rival last Saturday. The Cardinal nine
evidently has found itself and can be expected to help out with the big
celebration next Saturday.
Wolter deserves a great deal of credit for the showing his team has
made this year. Baseball has never attracted any very great amount of
interest here and it is a thankless job at best to work with a varsity nine.
This fact has not hampered Wolter in the slightest degree. In the face of
disappointments and numerous set-backs he has gone ahead and now the
results of his work are becoming evident.
The fact that his efforts are being appreciated by the student body as a
whoel is evident from the increased interest. In both of the varsity games,
which have been held at Berkeley, Stanford rooters have been very much in
evidence.
In the final game next Saturday, after the Big Meet, the bleachers will
undoubtedly be packed. Go get 'em varsity. Good luck Harry, we're
for vou.
