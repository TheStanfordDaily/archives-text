# Be Careful!

California's defeat at the hands of the Illinois track team last Saturday
does not necessarily mean very much. Contrary to the seemingly popular
idea that such a defeat eliminates the Golden Bear as a possible victor over
the Stanford varsity, it in no way changes the aspect of things.
In fact, California showed very impressive strength in the field events
â€”strength that many people did not think she possessed. Ihe Golden Bear,
always conies through with its best in a contest with the Cardinal. Next
Saturday's meet will probably be no exception to the rule.
Stanford rooters will need to be on hand to support their team to the
utmost. The men on the track squad are not over-confident, nor should
the rooters be.
It is not impossible that California should upset the dope and come
through, the winner. Stanford, it is true, has the edge, but "there is many
a slip." It is up to every Stanford man and woman to be in that rooting
section Saturday to help put a Cardinal victory across.
