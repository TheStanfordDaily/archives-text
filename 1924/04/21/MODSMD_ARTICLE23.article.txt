# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT
## 
### 
I Editor, Daily Palo Alto:
After the show there is a mad rush
to get home. Machines dash around
the campus like life depended on being
home in three and a half minutes.
Once home, there is the usual bull
session lasting indefinitely. And the
topic of conversation frequently is
some yarn about racing a speed cop
into L. A. or getting pinched in Red
wood, or making it from here to some
place in an incredibly short time. And
in most every case the few minutes
saved by speeding have been more
than dissipated in loafing or telling
about it,
The thought has been expressed
many times, and I merely call it to
your attention, "When will the limit
be reached? When will the terrible
tragedy occur and who will have to
be killed in order to bring this com
munity to its senses."
I do not own a car but frequently
have the pleasure of driving one. How
ever, as more legislation is found
necessary to insure even the slightest
degree of safety the pleasure of driv
ing fades in the dust of these many
"stop," "go," "warning," etc., signs.
I anticipate some drastic measures
on the campus in the very near future
but would rather see the winds of
freedom blowing as of old.
I stand for freedom but with a little
respect for life and limb. I believe it
is possible to get the thrills of life
without endangering other folks.

Not such a long time ago, there was
very much of a liub-bub concerning
permanent bleachers in the Basketball
pavilion. On this one issue there were
more words, eloquent "viewpoints"
and perspirations wasted than the
writer had witnessed in some little
time.
The idea seemed to be —were we to
have a pavilion devoted to backelball,
or was it to be devoted to dancing?
The big argument of those in favor
of permanent bleachers was —that
Stanford's athletics should be in the
minds of every one, and we were by
no means to let mere dancing inter
fere with basketball; permanent
bleachers were installed, thereby cut
ting down the available dancing space
by approximately 200 couples.
And "now comes the rub, as was an
ticipated by those against the bleach
ers —there's not enough room to dance
in, and the number of tickets have
to be reduced approximately a third
of those last year.
It was at first proposed to sell only
250 tickets to this year's prom, but
this number was later increased to
300. Six hundred people is going to
be considerable of a crowd on that
floor, but some concession had to be
made to iliose men of other classes
who had stood in line for a couple of
hours for tickets.
As one interested in this affair being
put over in a successful way, I see
absolutely no reason why we should
be forced to have our dance broken up
into two parts as was suggested by
"one who will not be here next year,"
in yesterday's "viewpoint." It would
mean extra decorating, extra music,
and, above all, it would be harder to
handle the crowd.
It is to be regretted that some men
will have to do without tickets, but
the event was foreseen when the
question of permanent bleachers was
first put forth. I cannot see why the

Junior Class should be in any way in
convenienced, or their plans interfered
with, because a few men who had the
opportunity of attending last year's
prom wish to take in this year's too.

After the show there is a mad rush
to get home. Machines dash around
the campus like life depended on being
home in three and a half minutes.
Once home, there is the usual bull
session lasting indefinitely. And the
topic of conversation frequently is
some yarn about racing a speed cop
into L. A. or getting pinched in Red
wood, or making it from here to some
place in an incredibly short time. And
in most every case the few minutes
saved by speeding have been more
than dissipated in loafing or telling
about it,
The thought has been expressed
many times, and I merely call it to
your attention, "When will the limit
be reached? When will the terrible
tragedy occur and who will have to
be killed in order to bring this com
munity to its senses."
I do not own a car but frequently
have the pleasure of driving one. How
ever, as more legislation is found
necessary to insure even the slightest
degree of safety the pleasure of driv
ing fades in the dust of these many
"stop," "go," "warning," etc., signs.
I anticipate some drastic measures
on the campus in the very near future
but would rather see the winds of
freedom blowing as of old.
I stand for freedom but with a little
respect for life and limb. I believe it
is possible to get the thrills of life
without endangering other folks.

Not such a long time ago, there was
very much of a liub-bub concerning
permanent bleachers in the Basketball
pavilion. On this one issue there were
more words, eloquent "viewpoints"
and perspirations wasted than the
writer had witnessed in some little
time.
The idea seemed to be —were we to
have a pavilion devoted to backelball,
or was it to be devoted to dancing?
The big argument of those in favor
of permanent bleachers was —that
Stanford's athletics should be in the
minds of every one, and we were by
no means to let mere dancing inter
fere with basketball; permanent
bleachers were installed, thereby cut
ting down the available dancing space
by approximately 200 couples.
And "now comes the rub, as was an
ticipated by those against the bleach
ers —there's not enough room to dance
in, and the number of tickets have
to be reduced approximately a third
of those last year.
It was at first proposed to sell only
250 tickets to this year's prom, but
this number was later increased to
300. Six hundred people is going to
be considerable of a crowd on that
floor, but some concession had to be
made to iliose men of other classes
who had stood in line for a couple of
hours for tickets.
As one interested in this affair being
put over in a successful way, I see
absolutely no reason why we should
be forced to have our dance broken up
into two parts as was suggested by
"one who will not be here next year,"
in yesterday's "viewpoint." It would
mean extra decorating, extra music,
and, above all, it would be harder to
handle the crowd.
It is to be regretted that some men
will have to do without tickets, but
the event was foreseen when the
question of permanent bleachers was
first put forth. I cannot see why the

Junior Class should be in any way in
convenienced, or their plans interfered
with, because a few men who had the
opportunity of attending last year's
prom wish to take in this year's too.
