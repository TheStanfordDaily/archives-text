# BRUIN TRACK TEAM LOSES MEET TO ILLINOIS, 72-58
## 
### Wallace Knox 
That the Golden Hear can be defeated
was conclusively proved Saturday when
Harry Gill's Illinois track team left for
Urbana after making the Bears take a
72 1-3 to 58 2-3 beating.
For the part, the California
strength against the middle westerners
was in events in which the Cards are
considered to be superior to Walter
Christie's contenders; nam- 1 )', in the
relay, half mile, discus, and shot.
Neufeldt Stars
California blanked Illinois in the shot
and discus, with Neufeldt, Lang, and
Witter placing in each event. Neufeldt's
mark in the shot was 46 feet 7 inches,
and in the discus, 139 feet 1 1-2 inches.
"Tiny" Hartranft should not have a great
deal of trouble in beating him out of
both firsts, but it is doubtful if Richards
or Arthur will be able to get a second,
although each of them has a good chance
to land a third. "Scotchy" Campbell must
also be reckoned with in the discus, as
he has been throwing it more than 130
feet in practice.
Chase, in the half mile, is rapidly be
coming better. He won handily from the
Illinois runners in 2:01 8-10, but he was
not forced to his limit. He is going to
give Bill Richardson a hard race, and it
would not be a bit surprising to see him
force Mcintosh into a third.
The much touted Jim Barber failed to
come through Saturday. He took a sec
ond in the century and a third in the fur
long, letting Sheppard beat him out in
the latter. The time of the 100-yard dash
was :0:10 flat. It may be that Barber
was in top form two weeks ago. but
that he is now 011 the down grade. How

ever, from his showing against Illinois,
it is safe to say that he will be lucky to
beat Marshal Hale next Saturday.
California will be able to depend 011
one first place, and that is in the broad
jump. Paul Boren landed out 24 feet 1
7-8 inches Saturday, which is a foot
more than he will need to win the Big
Meet.
The results of Walter Christie's train
ing are beginning to be shown in the Cal
ifornia field men. Upson, who was not
expected to do much better than 11 feet
6 inches, managed to clear the bar in a
tie for second at 12 feet 1 inch. In the
high jump Witherspoon got over 6 feet
1 inch. Both of these men will be able
to give Phil Scofield and Fred Anderson
a struggle for first honors.
Slow in Quarter
California didn't show much in the
quarter mile, and two mile, getting a
third in the mile and being shut out in
the two others. Stanford should not
have a hard time to repeat Illinois's
performance.
Becker, in the hurdles, was against one
of the best men in the country, Dan
Kinsey, and so his defeat in the hurdles
was not unexpected. Kinsey won the high
sticks in 0:15 flat and the lows in 0:24
4-5 flat. Becker was only able to get a
third in the high hurdles, Johnson, Illi
nois, coming second.
"Swede" Leistner can probably be de
pended upon to win both of these events
Saturday. From the looks of things,
Stanford should win by a point or two
more than Illinois did, but the Bears
might upset the dope in a few of the
field events and score enough points to
even the count.

a struggle for first honors.
Slow in Quarter
California didn't show much in the
quarter mile, and two mile, getting a
third in the mile and being shut out in
the two others. Stanford should not
have a hard time to repeat Illinois's
performance.
Becker, in the hurdles, was against one
of the best men in the country, Dan
Kinsey, and so his defeat in the hurdles
was not unexpected. Kinsey won the high
sticks in 0:15 flat and the lows in 0:24
4-5 flat. Becker was only able to get a
third in the high hurdles, Johnson, Illi
nois, coming second.
"Swede" Leistner can probably be de
pended upon to win both of these events
Saturday. From the looks of things,
Stanford should win by a point or two
more than Illinois did, but the Bears
might upset the dope in a few of the
field events and score enough points to
even the count.
That the Golden Hear can be defeated
was conclusively proved Saturday when
Harry Gill's Illinois track team left for
Urbana after making the Bears take a
72 1-3 to 58 2-3 beating.
For the part, the California
strength against the middle westerners
was in events in which the Cards are
considered to be superior to Walter
Christie's contenders; nam- 1 )', in the
relay, half mile, discus, and shot.
Neufeldt Stars
California blanked Illinois in the shot
and discus, with Neufeldt, Lang, and
Witter placing in each event. Neufeldt's
mark in the shot was 46 feet 7 inches,
and in the discus, 139 feet 1 1-2 inches.
"Tiny" Hartranft should not have a great
deal of trouble in beating him out of
both firsts, but it is doubtful if Richards
or Arthur will be able to get a second,
although each of them has a good chance
to land a third. "Scotchy" Campbell must
also be reckoned with in the discus, as
he has been throwing it more than 130
feet in practice.
Chase, in the half mile, is rapidly be
coming better. He won handily from the
Illinois runners in 2:01 8-10, but he was
not forced to his limit. He is going to
give Bill Richardson a hard race, and it
would not be a bit surprising to see him
force Mcintosh into a third.
The much touted Jim Barber failed to
come through Saturday. He took a sec
ond in the century and a third in the fur
long, letting Sheppard beat him out in
the latter. The time of the 100-yard dash
was :0:10 flat. It may be that Barber
was in top form two weeks ago. but
that he is now 011 the down grade. How

ever, from his showing against Illinois,
it is safe to say that he will be lucky to
beat Marshal Hale next Saturday.
California will be able to depend 011
one first place, and that is in the broad
jump. Paul Boren landed out 24 feet 1
7-8 inches Saturday, which is a foot
more than he will need to win the Big
Meet.
The results of Walter Christie's train
ing are beginning to be shown in the Cal
ifornia field men. Upson, who was not
expected to do much better than 11 feet
6 inches, managed to clear the bar in a
tie for second at 12 feet 1 inch. In the
high jump Witherspoon got over 6 feet
1 inch. Both of these men will be able
to give Phil Scofield and Fred Anderson
a struggle for first honors.
