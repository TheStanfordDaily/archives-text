## Defeat in Saturday's Contest, 6-3, Gives Bruins Title For 1924 Series 
### 
Poor fielding caused the Stanford
babe nine to drop their second game
to the California cubs by a score of
fi-.T Saturday morning on the Berkeley
diamond. The Cardinals lost the first
game of the little-big series a week
ago by a 5-4 score, thus Saturday's win
gives the Bear yearlings the title for
the 1924 series.
Coach Hunt's proteges hit Watson,
the cub moundsman, seven times,
which included two two-base hits and
two three-baggers. The California
frosh registered 7 hits against Riese,
only 2 of which were good for more
than one base.
California Scores First
"Nibs" Price's men drew first
when two balks, a passed ball, and a
hit gave them a marker. Up to this
time a Stanford player had not
reached first base.
Cardinals Blow Up
The score was tied at the last of
the 7th inning when the Cardinals
blew up and allowed four runs. Robie
started the merry-go-round with a two
base hit into left field. Wilson made
the first out when he hit on the ground
to second. Rohwer singled, advancing
Robie to third. Caldwell hit to short
but Soutliworth threw the ball wide to
first, base, drawing Mackersie off liis |
base. Stimson knocked a high fiy to
left field and Stewart dropped it, scor
ing Robie. Clymer hit a hard grounder
to second and was safe on a fielder's
choice. Rohwer was put out at home.
Maul reached first in the next play
when Morrill muffed his easy ground
er to third and allowed Caldwell to j
score. Niel singled to right, scoring I
Stimson and Clymer. Watson made :
the third out when he fouled out to 1
first base.

inning, Riese hit to center for two
bases. He stole third base on the next (
pitched ball and scored a minute later I

giving the Stanford babes their first
run.
Score on Three Errors

on third.
The Stanford freshmen tied the
score in the first of the sixth inning.
Osthaus fouled out to first base on
the second ball pitched. Morrill fol-1
lowed with a two-base drive over
short. Linguist drove deep into center,
but the ball went too high and he fiied |
out. But Morrill reached third on the
throw-in and scored on David's single.
David made the third out when he at
tempted to steal second.
Riese and Bailard made a formid
able battery but they lacked the neces
sary fielding support. The Stanford
frosli made 7 errors, most of which
were in critical periods of the game
when an error meant a run. The Cali
fornia frosh made only three errors j
when they were not felt.
