# NEVERS HURLS CARD NINE TO 7 TO 2 VICTORY OVER BRUINS IN SECOND DIAMOND TUSSLE
## May Crashes Home Run Into Right Field; Varsity Gives Perfect Support to Star Twirler 
### Bert Andrews 
AUTPLAYING the Bears all the way, the Stanford varsity nine romped in
with a 7-2 victory in the second game of the series Saturday 011 the Berkeley
diamond.
With the score tied, "Shorty" Roberts, lead-off man for the Cards, came to
bat in the eighth and slapped out a single. Captain Woodward laid down a
sacrifice bunt and advanced Roberts to second. Johnston walked and set the
stage for the Stanford rally.
Toomey, the Bear hurler, fielded McCandless' bunt and attempted to catch
Roberts going to third but threw the ball past Gerlach, allwoing Roberts and
Johnston to count.
May Gets Homers
With McCandless on base, "Lefty" May caught one squarely and knocked
it into the bleachers for four bases. Fuller and Mulchay, the next two
hitters, were easy outs, but the damage had been done and the Cards had
evened the series with the Bruins.
Although Stanford managed to get a man as far as third in the first inning
when Johnston doubled and advanced one base on a wild pitch, neither team

push a run over until the third. In
j this stanza, Ernie Nevers, the Cardinal
| hurler, duplicated his feat of the first
; game and slammed out a home run.
"Chuck" Johnston counted another for
! the Stanford nine in the fourth. After
j lie had been walked, McCandless beat out
I an attempted sacrifice, sending Johnston
j to second. "Chuck" scored on an error by
j the Bear second baseman.
Bears Tally in Fourth and Seventh
Sears, the first man up for the Bruins
in the fourth, doubled and advanced to
j third 011 Nevers' balk. Gerlach singled,
| scoring Sears. Nevers caught Sears off
second and the succeeding California hit
ters went out in easy fashion.
The other Bear run came in the sev
enth when Smith singled, was sacrificed
to third, and scored on Russell's hit.
For good measure, Stanford added an
other count in the ninth. Roberts walked
and crossed the plate when Woodward
smashed out a healthy double.
Improved Fielding
The brightest spot in Saturday's per
formance from a Cardinal standpoint was
the improved fielding of Coach Wolter's
men. The first game of the series was
practically presented to the California
nine through a combination of errors, but
in the second contest, not a misplay
marred the day's happenings. Not only
playing through the nine innings without
a bobble, the varsity stopped a pair of
incipient Bear rallies with two fast double
plays.
Nevers pitched his usual strong game
and allowed only one extra-base hit.
The varsity will play practice games
with the freshmen Tuesday and Wednes
day of this week in preparation for the
deciding game of the series which will
be played on the varsity field immediately
following the Big Meet.

Bears Tally in Fourth and Seventh
Sears, the first man up for the Bruins
in the fourth, doubled and advanced to
j third 011 Nevers' balk. Gerlach singled,
| scoring Sears. Nevers caught Sears off
second and the succeeding California hit
ters went out in easy fashion.
The other Bear run came in the sev
enth when Smith singled, was sacrificed
to third, and scored on Russell's hit.
For good measure, Stanford added an
other count in the ninth. Roberts walked
and crossed the plate when Woodward
smashed out a healthy double.
Improved Fielding
The brightest spot in Saturday's per
formance from a Cardinal standpoint was
the improved fielding of Coach Wolter's
men. The first game of the series was
practically presented to the California
nine through a combination of errors, but
in the second contest, not a misplay
marred the day's happenings. Not only
playing through the nine innings without
a bobble, the varsity stopped a pair of
incipient Bear rallies with two fast double
plays.
Nevers pitched his usual strong game
and allowed only one extra-base hit.
The varsity will play practice games
with the freshmen Tuesday and Wednes
day of this week in preparation for the
deciding game of the series which will
be played on the varsity field immediately
following the Big Meet.

AUTPLAYING the Bears all the way, the Stanford varsity nine romped in
with a 7-2 victory in the second game of the series Saturday 011 the Berkeley
diamond.
With the score tied, "Shorty" Roberts, lead-off man for the Cards, came to
bat in the eighth and slapped out a single. Captain Woodward laid down a
sacrifice bunt and advanced Roberts to second. Johnston walked and set the
stage for the Stanford rally.
Toomey, the Bear hurler, fielded McCandless' bunt and attempted to catch
Roberts going to third but threw the ball past Gerlach, allwoing Roberts and
Johnston to count.
May Gets Homers
With McCandless on base, "Lefty" May caught one squarely and knocked
it into the bleachers for four bases. Fuller and Mulchay, the next two
hitters, were easy outs, but the damage had been done and the Cards had
evened the series with the Bruins.
Although Stanford managed to get a man as far as third in the first inning
when Johnston doubled and advanced one base on a wild pitch, neither team

push a run over until the third. In
j this stanza, Ernie Nevers, the Cardinal
| hurler, duplicated his feat of the first
; game and slammed out a home run.
"Chuck" Johnston counted another for
! the Stanford nine in the fourth. After
j lie had been walked, McCandless beat out
I an attempted sacrifice, sending Johnston
j to second. "Chuck" scored on an error by
j the Bear second baseman.
Bears Tally in Fourth and Seventh
Sears, the first man up for the Bruins
in the fourth, doubled and advanced to
j third 011 Nevers' balk. Gerlach singled,
| scoring Sears. Nevers caught Sears off
second and the succeeding California hit
ters went out in easy fashion.
The other Bear run came in the sev
enth when Smith singled, was sacrificed
to third, and scored on Russell's hit.
For good measure, Stanford added an
other count in the ninth. Roberts walked
and crossed the plate when Woodward
smashed out a healthy double.
Improved Fielding
The brightest spot in Saturday's per
formance from a Cardinal standpoint was
the improved fielding of Coach Wolter's
men. The first game of the series was
practically presented to the California
nine through a combination of errors, but
in the second contest, not a misplay
marred the day's happenings. Not only
playing through the nine innings without
a bobble, the varsity stopped a pair of
incipient Bear rallies with two fast double
plays.
Nevers pitched his usual strong game
and allowed only one extra-base hit.
The varsity will play practice games
with the freshmen Tuesday and Wednes
day of this week in preparation for the
deciding game of the series which will
be played on the varsity field immediately
following the Big Meet.
