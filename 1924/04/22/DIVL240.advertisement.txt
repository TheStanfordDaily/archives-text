J-JERE the architects envisioned a picture, saw the modern office
building in terms of the great art of the Middle Ages—and the
result is a demonstration that the utilitarian structure, the modern office

their achievements of today and their promise of tomorrow.

tion, will prove more than equal to the demands of the architecture
of the future.
