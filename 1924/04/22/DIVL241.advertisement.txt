You won't fumble this cap!
Professional jugglers could handle the old
style shaving cream caps and never once drop
one down the drain or under the bath tub.
But for most of us, this new Williams Hinge-
Cap puts an end to an ancient nuisance.
Williams Shaving Cream is just as much
pleasanter to use as is the Hinge-Cap. It
softens the beard with uncanny speed. The
thicker lather holds the moisture in against
the skin where it is needed. This lather lu
bricates the skin, too, so that painful razor
friction is eliminated. And when your shave
is done, that famous ingredient in Williams
which helps the skin, leaves your face cool,
soothed and refreshed. No coloring matter
is used in Williams —it is a pure, natural
white shaving cream.
