# LIVE BRUIN TO BE VICTIM OF ROOTERS AT BIG MEET RALLY
## 
### 
A real live hairy bear who walks on
his hind feet and drinks his milk
straight without even blowing the
foam off the bottle is to be one of the !
last-minute additions to the rally pro
gram, according to Burt Lapp, yell
leader.
The money for the purchase of the J
beast was advanced by A1 Huneke, i
head of the Rally Committee. The total
price was twenty-five dollars and j
Huneke is depending upon the charity!
of the student body for his reimburse
ment.
Lapp plans to exhibit the bear at i
the rally and later at the Big Meet.
If enough gold dust can be scraped!
up the bruin will lack nothing in ap-j
propriate coloring.
