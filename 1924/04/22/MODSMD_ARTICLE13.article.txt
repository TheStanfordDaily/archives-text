# EL TIGRE WINS FROM PHI DELTS, 14 TO 12
## Kappa Alpha, Delta Upsilon Also Take Contests; A. K. L.'s Default 
### Donald Irving 
El Tigre won its third straight game
yesterday when it downed Phi Delta
Theta, 14 to 12. This victory places El
Tigre in first place in League 5 of
the intramural baseball series. Both
teams had won two games before this
contest. The results of the other
games were: Kappa Alpha defeated
Alpha Sigma Phi 6 to 3; Delta Upsilon
won from Theta Chi 7 to 3; Encina
Second won by default from Alpha
Kappa Lambda.
The El Tigre-Phi Delt game was a
hectic affair throughout. Phi Delta
Theta scored once in the second, while
El Tigre chalked up nine tallies in the
first two innings. Newton, on the
mound for the clubmen, weakened, and
nine Phi Delt runners crossed the
plate in the third and fourth. The El
Tigre batters continued to hit, scor
ing five times more during the game.
Newton has been pitching consistent
ball, and is greatly responsible for the
victories of the club. Dunmire per
formed well for the Phi Delts in the
field, and made some spectacular one
handed catches.
K. A.'s Score Early
Kappa Alpha's scores came in the
first three innings of the game. From
then on they were able to make only
two hits off Walt Campbell, Alpha Sig
chucker. Campbell's pitching was the
feature of the game. He fanned nine
men in the first four frames. In the
first he struck out three batters in a
row.
Delta Upsilon had things easy
against Theta Chi. The Theta Chi
batsmen were unable to solve the de
livery of Atwill until the fifth. In the
first four innings they went out in
one-two-three order. In the fifth they
scored three runs as the result of one
hit and three errors. During the sixth
and seventh the first three men up
were put out.
In the third inning, Schultzberg,
Theta Chi heaver, walked Hubbard,
the first man up. Coverley reached
first on an error, and hits by David
son and Coffin brought in three tal
lies. The other Delta Upsilon markers
came in the fourth and seventh.
Very few safe hits were registered
during th game. Theta Chi made two,
and the D. U.'s garnered but five
bingles.
Tomorrow's games: El Cuadro vs.
Alpha Tau Omega, Phi Kappa Sigma
vs. Beta Theta Pi. Theta Delta Chi vs.
Theta Xi, and El Capitan vs. Breakers.
