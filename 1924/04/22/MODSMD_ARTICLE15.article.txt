# FIRST RALLY OF QUARTER IS SET FOR TOMORROW
## "Dink" Templeton Will Be Principle Speaker at Spring Noisemaker 
### James Adams 
The increasing enthusiasm and in
terest in the Big Meet and Saturday's
Gala Day will be given every excuse
for a blow-out tomorrow night at the
Big Meet rally in the pavilion, accord
ing to the program which the rally
committee has arranged.
With the Big Meet looming as the
premier event of the season on the
Stanford campus the rally committee
has determined that the rally shall do
more than justice to the occasion.
Dr. Harry Reynolds, '96, active on
the campus in his time and prominent,
in alumni activities, is to speak and
tell how the graduates look forward
to Saturday when some old scores with
California are hoped to be evened up
a bit. Coach "Dink" Templeton is
slated for some pre-meet dope which
promises to set Stanford rooters on
edge.
Coach Wolters, coach of the Stan
ford ball team which defeated Cali
fornia Saturday, will prophesy as to
the chances of repeating the perform
ance next Saturday.
In the line of entertainment the
committee holds many aces. Two mys
tery acts, one of which will probably
be a skit, have taken much of the
time and interest of the committee
who jealously guard the secret of the
contents but who are emphatic as to
its high quality.
A saxaphone quartet of Louis Ala
baster, George Baker, Ted Mertz, and i
Ken Hess are on the card for a num-;
ber of selections.
Although pressed for time the com
mittee has consented to a discussion, 1
which will likely assume a fiery politi
cal nature, about the king and queen
contest. Discussion of qualifications, i
such as those of "Dope" Fuller or [
"Chuck" Johnston for king, will be
touched upon.
The Stanford Band and Yell Leader j
Burt Lapp with his assistants, "Dutch"
McAllister and "Red" Bell, will aid
the rooters in a workout of their
voices. Instructions to rooters for the
Big Meet will be given.
