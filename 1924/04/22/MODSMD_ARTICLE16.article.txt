j Dahler is leading Muriel Saxon for

Three More Days to Vote
i Only three more days remain in
i which to vote, the polls closing Fri
| day at 3 o'clock. The two candidates
having the greatest number of votes
to their credit at that time will be de
; clared king and queen respectively,
and their identity will be kept secret
until the time for the coronation ar
rives at 10 o'clock Friday night.
The success of the Masque rests
; largely with these two monarchs,
! since they will be in charge of the
' fun, gaiety, and festivities for the eve
j ning. For this reason, all students are
I asked to consider carefully the quali
ties which each candidate possesses
i for the position of a potentate at a
carnival masque.
The king should be comparatively
well known on the campus and should
possess a pleasing personality. He
should be able to reflect outwardly the
spirit of fun and gaiety. And the
i queen should likewise possess such
qualities. Much of the jovial spirit of
i the Masque is lost if the king and
queen who are elected are unable to
carry on their monarchial roles as
such parts should be acted.
"No one will be admitted to the
Masque Friday unless costumed," is
the anouncement made by the Masque
committee today. Costumes from Nor
man's may be selected at the pavilion
any afternoon this week. A 10 per
cent reduction on the regular rental
| is allowed students.

i the Masque is lost if the king and
queen who are elected are unable to
carry on their monarchial roles as
such parts should be acted.
"No one will be admitted to the
Masque Friday unless costumed," is
the anouncement made by the Masque
committee today. Costumes from Nor
man's may be selected at the pavilion
any afternoon this week. A 10 per
cent reduction on the regular rental
| is allowed students.
