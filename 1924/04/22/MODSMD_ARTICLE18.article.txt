Wednesday night, the annual Big Meet rally is scheduled to be held in
the pavilion. Burt Lapp and his assistants will he on hand to conduct the
affair and keep things moving. Those who have seen Lapp in action know
just how capable he is at that sort of thing.
From the meager details those in charge have given out, it is evident
that the program will he an interesting one. Six acts of vaudeville featur
ing some of the best campus talent together with other specialties, should
combine to make the rally well worth attending.
Last minute instructions as to what will he expected of the rooters at
the Big Meet Saturday will he given out. The rooters will play a very
important part in that meet and they should all be on hand to help out with
the arrangements. Freshmen, especially those who have just entered the
university, should avail themselves of the opportunity to crawl a little
farther on the boat.
Big Game and Big Meet rallies are among the most enjoyable experi
ences at Stanford. Forget the books for a little while and get over to the
pavilion Wednesday night for a little while to hear the plans for the down
fall of the Golden Bear.
The rally committee has obtained a small edition of the California bear,
in the person of a tiny l)ear cub which will be on exhibition at the rally.
Just by way of proving that the Golden Bear cannot be such a ferocious
and untamable creature, the little fellow will be there to take a leading role
in the program of the evening.
The man or woman who stays away from the rally Wednesday night
will miss a lot of fun. One hour will be plenty of time, and almost anyone
should be able to spare that much time for such an important event.
