# Harvard Business School Is Crowded to Capacity
## 
### 
Because 182 colleges besides Harvard
arc represented among the 600 students
now enrolled in the Harvard Graduate
School of Business Administration, the
announcement that the faculty of -the
business school has just voted to limit
the size of the school, is of interest
throughout the college world. Applica
tions for admission for the school year
1924-25, beginning September 22, 1924,
will be considered by priority of receipt,
provided the standards required are
reached. To avoid possible disappoint

j merits, the students' publicity committee
| of the business school club, made up
| of men from many colleges, is urging
| college seniors who are considering en
tering the business school to write
promptly for information and not to
wait until the close of the current
academic year, as lias been customary.
The following men, formerly of Stan
ford University, arc now students at the
Harvard Graduate School of Business
Administration: F. L. McElroy, Paul
H. Beuter, J. M. Davies, D. E. Favillc.
F. R. Fisher, Wendell R. Mortimer, J. R.
O'Laughlin. William W. Patterson. G. A.
I Wingard, D. L. Burdiclc, and R. H. Slice.
