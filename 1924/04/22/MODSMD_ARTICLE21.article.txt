# STANFORD NATIONAL BOARD TO MEET FOR FIRST TIME FRIDAY
## 
### 
Practically the entire membership of
the Stanford National Board of thirty
men from all parts of the country will
attend its first meeting since its organi
zation Friday and Saturday of next
week on the Stanford campus. The
new board consists of thirty men chosen
from geographical districts representing
all parts of the country so as to make it
national in scope. Its function is to
bring to the University the benefit of
ideas of men thus widely scattered in
residence and on the other hand to
serve as centers of information about
Stanford affairs in their own districts.
Two-thirds of the board are composed
of alumni of Stanford and one-third of
men who have not been connected mith
the university hitherto.
A full program has been arranged
for this first session for the purpose of
bringing the members into touch with
as many phases of the present-day uni
versity as possible, for their own infor
mation.
Friday morning they will inspect a
number of university buildings, which
will not only give them an idea of rep
resentative phases of university activi
ties but will also bring under view sev
eral buildings that are inadequate to
the demands upon them and most urg
ently in need of replacement. Their
tour will include the Law library, Me
morial church, Women's gymnasium,
University Press, Engineering labora
tories, and the University library.
That afternoon they will sit jointly
with the Stanford Board of Trustees,
which will hold its regular monthly
meeting at the president's office, and
that evening they will be the guests
with the Board of Trustees at a dinner
given by President and Mrs. Wilbur at
the president's house.
Saturday morning will be spent in
visiting various scientific departments,
including chemistry, zoology, geology
and mining, or for those who prefer,
the medical school in San Francisco.
The afternoon will be devoted to the
activities of University Day, which will
be in progress, including the Stanford-
California track meet in the Stanford
stadium in the afternoon and the big
University Day dinner in the basket
ball pavilion in the evening.
During their stay on the campus the
members of the board will be given an
opportunity to observe the new dining
rooms in operation, having luncheons
in the new Encina dining halls and the
Union.
