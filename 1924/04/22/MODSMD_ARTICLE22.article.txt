# STANFORD MERMEN ARE RECOMMENDED FOR 1924 OLYMPIAD
## 
### 
Three Cardinal swimming stars have
been commended by the American Olym
pic Swimming committee, and as a re
sult, are almost certain to go to the
Olympic games next summer.
Wally O'Connor and Elmer Collett
were mentioned for the water polo team,
and A1 White for the diving.
In view of his national reputation,
White's selection comes as no surprise,
but such high mention for O'Connor and
Collett is somewhat unexpected cause for
a jubilee.
Brandsten Member of Committee
Ernie Brandsten, Stanford swimming
coach, is a member of the committee
which recently made the recommenda
tions at a meeting in Chicago. Of course
the red-trunked paddlers will have to
qualify in the far western tryouts at
Searsville May 25 and the national try
outs at Indianapolis June 5, before their
selection is absolutely certain, but their
mention by the American committee
makes that result almost a foregone con
clusion.
Two Water Polo Teams to Go
In view of the "fact that former Amer
ican water polo aggregations have never
been well balanced in all departments it
was decided to remedy the fault by send
ing two full sevens this year. Because of
winning the national championship
the entire squad of the Illinois Athletic
Club is entitled to go.
Two swimmers from Stanford, three
from the Olympic Club, and one each
from the Chicago and New York Ath- J
letic Clubs were tentatively picked for
the second team. Jimmy Austin, former
aquatic point winner for the Cards, is one
of the trio from the San Francisco club.
Collett Starred Last Year
Elmer Collett gained an enviable rep
utation by his playing in the national
championships last year and his work
this season was noted with interest.
O'Connor was recommended on the
strength of his showing this year.
According to Brandsten, United States
will be represented by swimming and
water polo teams composed largely of
Pacific Coast performers. A high per
centage of the divers will in all likeli
hood be from Stanford.
O'Connor, Collett, McAllister, Myers,
Schmieder, Fletcher, and Allen, who com
pose the 1924 Card seven, are expected
to enter the Olympic tryouts May 25, so
there is a chance that more of Brand-,
stcn's men will be chosen.

there is a chance that more of Brand-,
stcn's men will be chosen.
Three Cardinal swimming stars have
been commended by the American Olym
pic Swimming committee, and as a re
sult, are almost certain to go to the
Olympic games next summer.
Wally O'Connor and Elmer Collett
were mentioned for the water polo team,
and A1 White for the diving.
In view of his national reputation,
White's selection comes as no surprise,
but such high mention for O'Connor and
Collett is somewhat unexpected cause for
a jubilee.
Brandsten Member of Committee
Ernie Brandsten, Stanford swimming
coach, is a member of the committee
which recently made the recommenda
tions at a meeting in Chicago. Of course
the red-trunked paddlers will have to
qualify in the far western tryouts at
Searsville May 25 and the national try
outs at Indianapolis June 5, before their
selection is absolutely certain, but their
mention by the American committee
makes that result almost a foregone con
clusion.
Two Water Polo Teams to Go
In view of the "fact that former Amer
ican water polo aggregations have never
been well balanced in all departments it
was decided to remedy the fault by send
ing two full sevens this year. Because of
winning the national championship
the entire squad of the Illinois Athletic
Club is entitled to go.
Two swimmers from Stanford, three
from the Olympic Club, and one each
from the Chicago and New York Ath- J
letic Clubs were tentatively picked for
the second team. Jimmy Austin, former
aquatic point winner for the Cards, is one
of the trio from the San Francisco club.
Collett Starred Last Year
Elmer Collett gained an enviable rep
utation by his playing in the national
championships last year and his work
this season was noted with interest.
O'Connor was recommended on the
strength of his showing this year.
According to Brandsten, United States
will be represented by swimming and
water polo teams composed largely of
Pacific Coast performers. A high per
centage of the divers will in all likeli
hood be from Stanford.
O'Connor, Collett, McAllister, Myers,
Schmieder, Fletcher, and Allen, who com
pose the 1924 Card seven, are expected
to enter the Olympic tryouts May 25, so
there is a chance that more of Brand-,
stcn's men will be chosen.
