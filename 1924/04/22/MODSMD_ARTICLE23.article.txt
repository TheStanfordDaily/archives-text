# TOYON HALL READY FOR UNIVERSITY DAY
## 
### 
Furniture and fixtures for Toyon hall
were installed last week and final touches
on the landscape gardening are being
made this week in preparation for Uni
versity Day. Work on the new hall has
been rushed by Comptroller A. E. Roth
during the past few weeks for the recep
tion of alumni, many of whom have not
seen the new dormitory since completion
the early part of this year.
Shipments of furniture and draperies
were received last week and have been
placed in the several reception rooms
and the lobby. Trees and shrubbery have
been transplanted to the court of the
hall, and graveled paths have been con
structed to put the new building in shape
for the inspection of Saturday's vis
itors.
Construction work on Brainier hall is
near completion, but exterior gardening
will not be rushed because of the short
time left before University Day.
