Ralph Rose, of San Francisco, holder of the world's record in the 16 pound
shot put (51 feet) won that event for the United States in the Olympic games
of 1904 and 1908. In the 1912 Olympiad, Rose had to be content with winning
the event in which the competitors put with both the right and left hand.
Ralph's defeat in the best hand event was a great blow to his pride, for up
to that time he had been supreme in the world of weight throwers. He had
beaten his own Olympic record, established in 1904 at St. Louis, but Pat
McDonald of New York had beaten him.
It has been told that Rose received a diamond medal for each world's record
that he made. He set a new shot put mark in 1904, and bettered the existing
record again in 1907, in 1908, and in 1909, and also put the 8, 12, and 28
pound balls further than any other athlete ever did. So he must have had
quite a collection of sparklers.
Rose was born in Healdsburg, California, on St. Patrick's Day, 1885. He
stood 6 feet 5*4 inches tall and weighed close to 300 pounds. He went to the
University of Michigan and later competed for the Olympic Club of San
Francisco.
