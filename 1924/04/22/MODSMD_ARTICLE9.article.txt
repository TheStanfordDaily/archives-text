# FIVE RECORDS MAY BE BROKEN IN TRACK MEET ON SATURDAY
## Present Mark in Century, Broad Jump, Quarter Mile, Shot, and Discus May Fall This Year

pOACH "Dink" Templeton is putting the finishing touches upon his tracksters
every afternoon on the new track in the stadium. The stadium track is
being used this week in order that the runners may become accustomed to it.
The new oval will not be altogether unfamiliar to the Bears, as Walter
Christie had a number of the Blue and Gold stars working out on it a couple
of weeks ago.
Without a doubt the new track is considerably faster than the old oval. It
is not unlikely that a number of Stanford-California records will fall by the
wayside, both in the track and in the field events.
The hundred, the quarter, the broad jump, the shot, and the discus are the
events in which new marks are likely to be made. The present record in
the century is 0:10 flat. As both Marshal Hale and Jim Barber are capable

of 0:09 9-10 it is highly possible that
one of them will breast the tape in
this time Saturday.
Quarter Record May Fall
The best time ever made in Big
Meets in the quarter is 0:50. Bill
Storie and Ted Miller are both equal
to 0:49 3-5, and so the one of them
who wins should also establish a new
record.
"Tiny" Hartranft should not have a
bit of trouble in shattering both of the
marks in the weight events. What
everyone is looking for him to do, is
to break the world's records in the
shot and approach it closely in the
discus. All he will have to do in the
shot is more than 48 feet 6 1-2 inches,
and in the discus, 137 feet 4 inches.
As he has been constantly exceeding
these distances all season, he will un
doubtedly do it again Saturday.
Paul Boren has a good chance of
setting a new mark in the broad jump.
The present record is 23 feet 8 5-8
inches. Boren jumped more than 24
feet against Illinois, and if he can do
it again he will garner a record as
well as a first place.
Kerr May Surprise
Bill Kerr may have the stuff to
shatter the old record in the mile run,
which is 4:20 1-5. This is one of the
older records, having stood since 1914.
Kerr ran the mile in 4:24 6-10 against
the Southern Conference and did not
seem particularly tired at the finish.
If he gets out and works for it he has
a very good chance of setting a lower
time.
A1 Charles is still on the hospital
list. His shin splint is not healing
very rapidly, and as a result, he will
be considerably handicapped against
the Bruins. A1 will be able to run. how
ever. To play safe, it is probable that
"Dink" will have A1 Smith run the
two-mile instead of the half or mile.
With Charles, Smith, Kerr, Frank
Hayes, and robably Pat Murphy en
tered in this event, the Bears will have
to do some fast running to get a single
place.
The Bears must still be given the
