fPHE first cost is practically the last —ask the man who owns a Masque Ball
■* ticket.
The upkeep is negligible, but they're new spring styles built for comfort
and not speed—and they satisfy. Costumes may be selected at the pavilion
until Friday.
You just know she wears them—ask dad, he knows. Phoenix. MacCallum,
and Holeproof will be displayed lav-<S> ——

ishly by the feminine contingent.
Uneeda refreshment. There'll be all
kinds of 'em for the merrymakers.
Balloon-dipped cords may be worn
by "roughs" in the balcony. Admis
sion 25 cents after 10 o'clock.
That's the insidious thing about it
all. and even your closest friends won't
tell you. Hut listen—it's the Masque
Ball Friday night in the pavilion.
Sure, already guessed it.
Stage Nearly Set
The stage is nearly set and the mas
queraders are making ready. The
whole campus will be there, dancers
ami "roughs" alike; and in such an
admirable setting, the whole Stanford
population will gather for revelry and

merymaking—an enthusiastic prologue
to the Big Meet on the following day.
The ticket sale yesterday was un
usually heavy and the quota of 300
pasteboards was snatched up quickly.
Because so many students did not get
them, a small additional allotment
was placed on sale today.
"Roughs to Be Admitted
The Masque will be an unprecedent
ed occasion for "roughing." Not only
may the "roughs" view the multi-col
ored. patchwork assortment of cos
tumes flitting about the dance floor,
but they will also be given the oppor
tunity to view the impressive corona
tion of the King and Queen at 10
o'clock, and four acts of entertainment
of the first water an hour later. And ,
all for two-bits a head!
"Hock" Chalmers, that facetious i
star of the Holdover show this spring, j
is going to do the coronating of Their
Majesties. He has worked up an elabo- j
rate ceremony and it will be difficult
to realize that the monarchs are just
students again—after the ball.
Entertainment Varied
Two snappy rapid-fire song and
dance revues by feminine choruses of
Ram's Head selection will be note-1
worthy for their beauty and elaborate- ;
ness. Arnold Bayley has worked up a
new act: Madame Somebody—anyway,
she's a Dutch songstress and she will |
yodel several melodies that will amuse
and please. Ted Van Deusen and Gar
diner Lippincott, the slippery-footed 1
genltemen, have collaborated on an-'
other of their soft-shoe novelties, and
it promises to he a whizz! Don't en-1
core too much, for it's hard work.
The lighting and decorations are
going to be nothing short of spectacu
lar for a carnival masque, and as you \"
enter the pavilion, the effect will daz
zle you. It shouldn't take you many j
seconds to warm up to the occasion. ■
Only two more days and the second
A. S. S. U. Masque Ball will be reality, j
And brother, what an evening it will
be!
