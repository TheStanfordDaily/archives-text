# RICHARDSON TO ENTER RELAY IN MEET SATURDAY
## Marshal Hale, Bill Storie Will Get Back Into Action On Track 
### Wallace Knox 
In spite of dope to the contrary,
things are beginning to look as if the
Big Meet will be close.
Stanford lias a decided edge, but
upsets are too common when Cali
fornia meets Stanford for compara
tive dope to mean very much. If dope
is to be considered prophetic the
Cards will win by twenty-five points,
but if California breaks into the scor
ing column in events where it should
not the meet is likely to be decided
by less than a fifteen point margin.
Bill Storie will enter the quarter
mile, but will not compete in the relay.
Bill Richardson will take his place.
The relay team will then consist of
Captain Van Judah, Ted Miller, Bill
Richardson, and Harvey Coverley.
Storie in Shape
Storie is beginning to get back into
(he form he had at the beginning of
the season. One race will not hurt, him,
but it is doubtful if he can stand the
strain of a second quarter, and "Dink"
is taking no chances on ruining him
permanently. Bill will probably give
Ted Miller a race in this event, and
the winner is likely to set a new
Stanford-California record.
Marshal Hale will be seen in action
in the 220-vard dash for the first time
this year. Hale has run but one race
during the season and his ability in
the furlong is unknown. Lan Campbell,
present holder of the record, is also
in good shape and should show his
heels to the field.
Evers has been steadily improving
in the javelin throw. He should heave
the spear between 175 and 180 feet
