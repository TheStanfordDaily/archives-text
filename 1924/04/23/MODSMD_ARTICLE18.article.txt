the fact that Cardinal and Bear baseball varsities will tangle in the decid
ing game of the annual series. Each team has one victory to its credit and

will be counted on for many points in the Olympic Games.
Stanford students are greatly privileged to be able to see the two
greatest track teams in the United States battling for supremacy. Five
Sanford-Califotrnia records and two world marks will be in danger when
the stars from the rival universities line up against each other Saturday.
In the heat of interest in the track meet, many people are overlooking
the fact that Cardinal and Bear baseball varsities will tangle in the decid
ing game of the annual series. Each team has one victory to its credit and
both will be travelling at top speed to take the odd one. Coach \\ olter has
developed a great baseball machine on the I" arm this year and one which
deserves a great deal of credit and support.
Tonight's rally will offer Stanford rooters their last opportunity to
prove their confidence in the teams which will have so much at stake Sat
urday. Burt Lapp, his and the Rally Committee as a whole
have been working hard on the details of the affair and an attractive pro
gram has been arranged.
Every student in the university should be able to take an hour off to
night to get in on the fun. The baby bear which has come into the pos
session of the Rally Committee will have an important part in the cere
monies.
Those attending the rally will be given an opportunity to hear from
those who should know just what are Stanford's chances in the two big
contests Saturday. All students in the university owe it to the athletes,
coaches, yell leaders, and themselves, to be on hand.
Every ticket on the Stanford side of the stadium has been sold and
more are being printed. This fact indicates that the Big Meet Saturday
will have the largest attendance of any such event in the history of Stan
ford-California competition.
