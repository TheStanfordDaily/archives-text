### Stanford Graduates 
Four students were (/runted advanced
degrees by the Geology department at the
end of winter quarter. Tim re ceil ted
M. A. degrees and tn>o Ph. D.'s. Three
of these graduates arc now applying the
information they gained from the re
search made for their theses in practical
work.
Dale Sparks, who wrote on the
"Orbitoid Foraminifera of the Cali
fornia Eocene," is now employed by
the Epirl Petroleum Company in Tam
pico, Mexico, where by means of the
discoveries made in his study of the
foraminifera, he is able to determine
the approximate depths reached during
the drilling of oil wells.
Up to this time geologists have, to a
large extent, neglected these primitive
little animals preferring to study
larger species. Sparks, however, real
ized that due to the great pressure in
the oil well sections the larger pre-his
toric animals were ground up, the tiny
foraminifera, alone being preserved in
their original shape.
As these tiny animals differ accord
ing to the age in which they lived
Sparks discovered that when the small
pieces of earth were brought out by the
drill, the foraminifera could be exam
ined, and thus the level which had been
reached could be determined, with the
approximate distance to which it would
be necessary to drill to reach oil.

"Recent Modreporaria of the Philip
pine Islands" is the subject of the
thesis submitted for a Ph.D. degree by
Leopoldo A. Faustino. Faustino's
paper will be published in book form
by the Philippino Journal of Science
this fall and will be the latest and best
book on the classification of corals, and
the only one available as a working
manual.
Among the important discoveries
made by Faustino is the fact that cer
tain coral beds in the Philippines are
older than they were previously thought
jto be. This discovery was made by a
I comparison with the formations found
I elsewhere, especially those in the East
Indies, and may mean that there is a
possibility of finding oil in this section.
This thesis deals directly with a re
vision of the corals of the Philippines
including a discription of several new
species and a comparison of them with
fossils from all over the world.

The thesis submitted by Ralph
Daniel Reed for a Ph.D. deals with the
"Tertiary Petrology in the Colinga
District, California." Reed is at pres
ent iti Wasco, California, engaged in
field work.
In his paper Reed discusses the geo
logic liistorv of this oil bearing district
during the Tertiary period.
"The tertiary eocene." says Reed,
had its first source in cretaceous rocks.
The next period found great quantities
of small plants and animals. At the
conclusion of the deposition of this ma
terial the sea bottom was exposed to
erosion and some strata folded along
the axis of the present Colinga anti
cline."
The next episode in the history of
the region according to Reed, was the
sweeping of sand and close gravel into
the sea. These materials were formed
by Franciscan and other rocks which
lay to the west of the sea. After the
deposition of these beds the sea bot
tom again emerged.
Later a marine condition was again
established which lasted through the
deposition o fthe etchegoin group. The
sea was shallow throughout the depo
sition and three or four times during
the epoc volcanic ash fell over the
region in such quantities as to make the
beds ten to twenty feet thick. Later
formation's of river and lake material
indicate at one time this section liar

bored both rivers and lakes.
Reed's paper includes a study of the
heavy minerals contained in sediment
ary beds and the correlation of differ
ent beds in the tertiary by means of
these minerals.

Fred Earle Buss chose "The Psysio
graphy of the Southern Wasatch Moun
tains and the Adjacent Valley Lands
With Especial Reference to the Origin
of the Topographic Forms," as a sub
ject for his thesis for an M.A. degree.
The area chosen by Buss for his re
search work heretofore has not been
studied intensively because it has no
producing mines and consequently it
preesnts many unsolved problems in
geologic history.
The glacial features of this region are
particularly interesting as there*still
remains a single small glacier a mile
in length and one-third of a mile wide,
a relic of prehistoric times.
According to Buss, in an earlier
period this area was worn down nearly
to sea level but later uplifted along a
series of normal faults. This region has
twice been a mountainous region and
there are one or two evidences of vol
canic atcion in ancient prehistoric times.
Buss' thesis contains a study of the
drainage of the system and the bearing
it had on the origin of the range.
Buss spent between six and eight
years in collecting material for this
thesis. He also made field trips
through the area in order to obtain the
information at first hand.
