## 
### 
Tennis as a major college sport is
making unusual progress throughout
all sections of the country, says a
bulletin of the United Slates Lawn
Tennis Association.
The Association has be«n collecting
data by the questionnaire method for
several months, and some interesting
results have been obtained. Replies
were received from 102 out of 108 col
leges to which letters were sent, and
more than 90 of them had tennis
teams. Of these, twenty-seven con
sidered the game as a major sport.
Harvard Tennis Ranks Second
Six institutions reported the pres
ence of tennis coaches and many oth
ers rated the game as a minor sport
with good standing.
The growth of the sport at Harvard
iB an example of its popularity in the
East. Since 1919 it has been second
only to crew, having been elected by
720 men, while the latter was elected
by 800. Squash, the most adaptable
indoor form of tennis, was third on
the list with 672 men. The most im
portant limiting factor there, as else
where, has always been the small
number of courts.

William H. Greer, Director of Physi
cal Education, Harvard, states: "It is

difficult to estimate the number who
would play the game if there were
more courts available." In five years
the number of squash courts at Har
vard has increased from 15 to* 30, and
the tennis courts from 50 to 80.
Julian S. Myrick, former vice-presi
dent of the U. S. L. T. A., says: "Base
ball, track, football, rowing—all these
have their place, but at best that place
ia limited by considerations of time
and opportunity. No matter how good
an athlete may be in college, in the
majority of cases his chance to enjoy
such sports ends with his graduation."

Students at the Ohio State Univer
sity will soon have another oppor
tunity to earn money. The University
Window Cleaning association, organ
ized by two students at the University
of Colorado in 1915, is to be estab
lished at the Ohio State. Twelve col
lege branches of this organization have
been established.

Autos in China must wear mud
