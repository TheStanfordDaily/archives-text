# SPORTS OF 1924
## The 						Penn and Drake Relays 
### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Today marks the start of the University of Pennsylvania and the Drake relay
carnivals. The greatest runners in college circles all over the country will
take part in one event or the other.
Charlie Paddock, West Coast sprinting demon, shows his stuff at Drake.
Liddell of the Oxford and Cambridge team will be one of the star performers
at Penn. It is safe to predict that many marks will go by fhe board today,
and that a definite line on many Olympic candidates will be had.
No, neither William Penn nor Sir Francis Drake, whose pictures appear,
ever competed in the respective relay carnivals.
