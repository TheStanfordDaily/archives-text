# CARD TENNIS TEAM DEFEATS SOUTHERN BRANCH, SCORE 6-0

### 
Stanford closed the tennis season
yesterday by defeating Southern
Branch, 6-0.
A high wind prevented any spectac
ular playing, and forced the men to
take the defensive as much as possible.
Captain Houser, of the southerners,
against Hinckley in the first singles,
put up the best opposition of the day,
losing 6-3, 6-4, in a hard-fought match.

sided, and at no time were the Stan
ford men forced to exert themslves.

Overfelt defeated Fisher, 6-1, G-4.
Mertz defeated Vargas, 6-1, 6-0.
Fairchild defeated Penney, 6-4, 6-2.

Tussing and de√üack defeated Vargas
and Penney 6-0, 6-2.
There are no more intercollegiate
games, but the team will stay in train
ing for its Australian trip and will
play in exhibition matches. Regular
practice to determine ratings will con
tinue under the following conditions:
The first five or six men on the squad
will play, as formerly, three times a
week with the men ranked just above
and below them. The remainder of the
men will play every day if possible,
and will be allowed to challenge other
players than the man directly above
