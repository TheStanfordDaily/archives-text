# FORTY MEN WANTED FOR SUMMER WORK
## 
### 
A word from the Appointment Sec'y:
"Definite arrangements for summer
work should be made early as there
is a scarcity of positions, in regard
to the "Wear Ever" Aluminum
proposition, 1 wish tosay that it
has my hearty endorsement. Stan
ford students have always had ex
cellent success in selling "Wear-
Ever." The unusual sales method
employed brings good financial re
turns, and at the same time makes
the proposition attractive to college
men."
Last summer 1300 college men
were selling aluminum cooking
utensile. These 1300 men averaged
$11.80 per 8 hr. day (gross profits)
and they did no canvassing from
house to house. Their sales were
made by appointments which were
secured through demonstrations.
A full explanation of the work in
cluding a demonstration will be giv
en at the Women's Clubhouse, 7:15,
Wednesday, April 23.
