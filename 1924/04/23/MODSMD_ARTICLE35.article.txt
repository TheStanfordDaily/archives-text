# Mechanical Engineers Challenge Swivelers to War on Ball Diamond
## 
### 
Hear ye; the mighty champions of
the M.E. department have sent the fol- !
lowing challenge to the doughty Civil
Engineers. "To the lowly and insig- i
nificant mud-muckers flatteringly
spoken of as the 'swivel engineers:'
"Be it known that the M.E.'s (mas
culine engineers) do hereby challenge,
unconditionally, the aforesaid mob of
mud crushers to do battle on the base- j
ball diamond. Choose your weapons,
if there are men among you—rise up—
chin yourselves—and express a willing- j
ness to be everlastingly ashamed."
The challenging team is headed by
E. A. Long, captain; and R. R. Robi
son, manager, respectively.
