# GLEE CLUB WILL SING AT FRIDAY ASSEMBLY
## Field and Baker Are to Be Included on Program With Students 
### 
Charles K. Field, '95, and Shirley
Baker, '95, will not be the only singers
at the assembly at 10 o'clock Friday.

Glee Club when they were in college,
but admit that the present organiza
tion is better in some ways.
The Glee Club of 1924 will sing two
of Field's songs, "Stanford Red," and
"The Little Vendome." The former is
as fitting to the Stanford spirit today
as it was when it was written, but the
latter refers to an era that is wholly
past. The Little Vendome was in May
flekl, and the song begins, "Oh, we'll
go down the road to the Little Ven
dome."
