# SEQUOIA 1, DELTA CHI NINES LEADING IN LEAGUE SIX
## 
### 
Sequoia 1 and Delta Chi kept up
their winning streaks by taking their
third straight games yesterday from
Los Arcos and Encina 3 respectively.
Sequoia 1 won 13 to 2, and Delta Chi
took its contest 14 to 8. These two
teams are now leading for honors in
League 6. In the other game Phi
Gamma Delta downed El Toro 7 to 3.
The game scheduled between Encina 4
and 5 was not played.
Encina 3 scored four runs in the
first half of the first inning on one
walk, two singles, and two doubles.
Delta Chi retaliated and rung up
seven markers.
The Sequoia 1 - Los Arcos game was
all in favor of Sequoia. Prior did the
twirling for the Hall, and Morrison
pitched for Los Arcos. Sequoia 1
nine is now a possible pennant con-
tender.
The Phi Gamma Delta - El Toro game
started out as a duel between Grace,
Fiji chucker, and Licking of El Toro.
