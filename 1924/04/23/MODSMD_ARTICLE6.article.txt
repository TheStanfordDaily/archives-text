# ENTERTAINMENT IS ARRANGED FOR OLD GRADS AT BANQUET
## Hollis Chalmers Will Present Campus Entertainers in Tuneful Numbers 
### 
Under the direction of Hollis Chal
mers, a program of entertainment has
been arranged for the alumni in the
pavilion after the annual University
Day banquet Saturday, which is ex
pected to surpass any potpourri of
song and dance acts presented on the
campus for some time.
Following the entertainment the old
timers will be given an opportunity
to dance to the strains of Alabaster's
orchestra.
Students will be admitted to the en
tertainment and dance after 9 o'clock.
Admission will be 75 cents.
Van Deusen-Lippincott Number
Ted Van Deusen and Gardner Lip
pincott will entertain the alumni with
some of their song and dance numbers
which have been favorably received in
a number of campus productions this
year.
A Prima Donna recital by Arnold
Bayley should draw several hearty
laughs out of the old grads. Bayley,
who will appear as Madame Blitzen, a
coloratura contralto, will be supported
by Richard Malaby on the piano.
