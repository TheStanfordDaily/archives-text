## 
### 
i "The one issue big enough for the
I reorganization of American politics is
j that between liberty and equality,"
1 said Dr. Arthur T. Hadley, president
! emeritus of Yale, last night when he
| traced the course of liberty and its
I development, in his talk on "The Con-
I flict between Liberty and Equality."
Gives Second Talk Tonight
"The Uses and Dangers of Property
: Right" will be Dr. Hadley's subject for
his second talk at 7:30 tonight in the
: Assembly hall. He will deliver the last
! of the series tomorrow night.
This issue, which can be a basis for
j the reorganization of politics is, accord
! ing to Hadley, based on "the relative
j importance of allowing individual citi
| zens to develop their powers in their
| own way, the claim of liberty, or of
i having all citizens given opportunities
i as nearly equal as possible for the
! pursuit of happiness, the claim of so
! cial justice."
Recommends Study
"The man who has studied the his
tory of liberty and equality and has
i thought out the lessons of history is
i likely to have the same advantage
| over the opportunist in dealing with
i the politics of the next twenty years
| that Lincoln had in his day over those
! who thought that the slavery question
| could be settled by expedients like the
I Kansas-Nebraska bill or squatter
j sovereignty."

Dr. Hadley continued, "I know of
no study which is more in line with
I the purposes for which this lectureship
I was established. If anything can aid
I us in understanding the relations be
tween human conduct and human des
tiny it should be the study of the his
tory of liberty.
"It will help us to see the inter
action between the needs, the ideals,
and the institutions of organized po
litical society in successive phases of
i its development. If carried out to the
| fullest extent, we shall see that it
gives history a new meaning and mor
i ality."
