# FIELD TO READ EARLY POETRY AT ASSEMBLY
## Dr. Jordan Will Introduce Writer; Shirley Baker Is on Program 
### Everett W. Smith, '99 
"A fellow can be young but once,",
Dr. Jordan wrote in his prefatory note
to "Four-Leaved Clover," the book of j
Stanford verse published by Charles j
K. Field, '95, twenty-five years ago, j
from which Field will read at tomor
row morning's assembly. Field has j
proved Dr. Jordan right by staying j
continuously young so far as Stan-;
ford is concerned through the whole I
quarter of a century. He has as close i
and sympathetic an understanding of J
undergraduate life today as he had;
■when he wrote the verses that have j
become recognized as interpretive
of that life.
Dr. Jordan to Introduce Field
Dr. Jordan will read this preface
-when he introduces Field at the as-:
sembly tomorrow. Charlie Field was a
conspicuous figure in early Stanford
history, as is indicated in a number
-of passages in Dr. Jordan's autobio-j
graphy, "The Days of a Man." Dr. (
Jordan, in his note written for "Four- 1
Leaved Clover," said that Field's
verses were a part of the traditions of
Stanford University.
This is borne out by a member of
the class of '99 on the campus for the 1
class's twenty-fifth anniversary re- j
■union. "As a freshman," said this man, ;
"I knew Charlie Field's verses by
heart and I know them yet, and can
still sing the songs he wrote —at least j
I could sing them if I could sing at all.
