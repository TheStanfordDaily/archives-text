# FIELD TO READ EARLY POETRY AT ASSEMBLY
## Dr. Jordan Will Introduce Writer; Shirley Baker Is on Program 
### Everett W. Smith, '99 
"A fellow can be young but once,",
Dr. Jordan wrote in his prefatory note
to "Four-Leaved Clover," the book of j
Stanford verse published by Charles j
K. Field, '95, twenty-five years ago, j
from which Field will read at tomor
row morning's assembly. Field has j
proved Dr. Jordan right by staying j
continuously young so far as Stan-;
ford is concerned through the whole I
quarter of a century. He has as close i
and sympathetic an understanding of J
undergraduate life today as he had;
■when he wrote the verses that have j
become recognized as interpretive
of that life.
Dr. Jordan to Introduce Field
Dr. Jordan will read this preface
-when he introduces Field at the as-:
sembly tomorrow. Charlie Field was a
conspicuous figure in early Stanford
history, as is indicated in a number
-of passages in Dr. Jordan's autobio-j
graphy, "The Days of a Man." Dr. (
Jordan, in his note written for "Four- 1
Leaved Clover," said that Field's
verses were a part of the traditions of
Stanford University.
This is borne out by a member of
the class of '99 on the campus for the 1
class's twenty-fifth anniversary re- j
■union. "As a freshman," said this man, ;
"I knew Charlie Field's verses by
heart and I know them yet, and can
still sing the songs he wrote —at least j
I could sing them if I could sing at all.
To me they represent the spirit of
Stanford today just as thoroughly.
Spirit Has Not Changed
"It is a fine thing at this time when
the undergraduates are welcoming us
old-timers back to the Farm to have
Charlie Field read these old verses
showing that the spirit of us old dino
saurs wasn't and isn't anything dif
ferent from that of the students to
day."

Shirley Baker, '95, who will be on
the program with Field tomorrow, was
his partner in song and sometimes in
dance also when they were students
together, and he, too. is a participant
in present-day Stanford life. The firm
of Baker & Carpenter, himself and
E. E. Carpenter, '98, was in charge of
the engineering work on the stadium
and track, contributing their fees to
the cost of the undertaking, so that
his appearance on the Assembly hall
stage just before the big track meet
is appropriate. Incidentally, Baker was
the first fraternity man at Stanford,
since he was the first man initiated
into Zeta Psi, the earliest fraternity
established in the University.
