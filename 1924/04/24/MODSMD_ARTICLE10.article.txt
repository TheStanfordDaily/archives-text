# "TEAPOT DOME" AFFECTS PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS
## Professor West Believes That McAdoo's Chances Are But Slightly Injured 
### 
In regard to the coming clcctions
and their connection with the Teapot
Dome scandal, Professor Victor J.
West, head of the Political Science de
partment, said in an interview yester
day: "McAdoo was apparently elimi
nated from the presidential race, but
he will have one-third of the conven
tion, anyhow."
If McAdoo is nominated by the
Democrats, his election depends on the
combination of men who are put up for
other offices by the party, according to
West.
Democrats Had Advantage.
He says, "The Democrats had the
advantage, anyway, without this affair.
The wide dissatisfaction with the pres
ent administration was indicated in the
election of 1922, when the Democrats
were generally very successful.
"The Democrats were entirely suc
cessful in twenty-eight states, and the
Republicans in only eleven. If the

Democrats carried the same twenty
eight states in the presidential election,
they would win without trouble, as they
would have 329 electoral votes, sixty
more than are necessary to elect a
president."
State Elections Prophetic.
The 1922 state elections were proph
etic. according to West, because they
were statewide, and the candidates
made their appeals to the same elec
torate as in national elections.
Taking it for granted that some states
would change parties, which they prob
ably will, the Democrats would still be
safe on account of the southern states,
which have always voted the Demo
cratic ticket since the Civil War.
"The only thing that has happened
since 1922 to change the political sit
uation was the death of Harding, which
brought Coolidge into office. Mr. Cool
idge's conduct of the office of president
was meeting with general approval,
but the swing toward the Republican
party has been halted by the investi- '
gations.
"1 he willingness of some members of
the Harding cabinet to subordinate pub
lic interests to their private advantage I
is having an adverse effect upon Re
publican chances of success.
"So far as the primaries prove any
thing, it is certain that Coolidge will be
nominated as a representative of the
conservative elements.
Third Party a Possibility.
"1 lie possibility of a third party will |
arise,' said West, "if the Democrats
do not nominate a man with progressive
tendencies. Then a group of progres
sive Repubilcans and Democrats will
support a third candidate. Such a can- l
didate might carry six or eight states
in the northwest, and enough electoral
votes to keep the Republicans and
Democrats from winning.
West, however, believes that if there |
is a third party, the Democrats will win.
Especially with a man from a western '
state, running for an important office
and with popular candidates for gov
ernors and senators in New York, New '
Jersey, and Ohio, they will carry it, he J
thinks.
Investigations Political Capital.
"As to the question of whether the !
investigation was made public at this !
time for the purpose of the Democratic j
campaign material, it is obvious that I
the Democrats did expect to make po-1
litical capital out of the revelations. !
That is human nature.
"But it should be noted that the in- j
vestigations could scarcely have been j
made earlier. Though the leases were j
made in 1922, there were nine months j
between the sixty-seventh session of :
Congress, which expired in March,
1923, with an overwhelming Republi
can majority, and the new Congress,
which did not meet until December,
1923.
"An attempt to defeat Daugherty in 1
the sixty-seventh Congress was de
feated by the Republicans. However, j
the fact that the Democrats and itisurg- !
ent Republicans now are in the majority |
in the Senate, made possible the in- !
vestigations which had been impossible !
before," he said.

"The Democrats were entirely suc
cessful in twenty-eight states, and the
Republicans in only eleven. If the

Democrats carried the same twenty
eight states in the presidential election,
they would win without trouble, as they
would have 329 electoral votes, sixty
more than are necessary to elect a
president."
State Elections Prophetic.
The 1922 state elections were proph
etic. according to West, because they
were statewide, and the candidates
made their appeals to the same elec
torate as in national elections.
Taking it for granted that some states
would change parties, which they prob
ably will, the Democrats would still be
safe on account of the southern states,
which have always voted the Demo
cratic ticket since the Civil War.
"The only thing that has happened
since 1922 to change the political sit
uation was the death of Harding, which
brought Coolidge into office. Mr. Cool
idge's conduct of the office of president
was meeting with general approval,
but the swing toward the Republican
party has been halted by the investi- '
gations.
"1 he willingness of some members of
the Harding cabinet to subordinate pub
lic interests to their private advantage I
is having an adverse effect upon Re
publican chances of success.
"So far as the primaries prove any
thing, it is certain that Coolidge will be
nominated as a representative of the
conservative elements.
Third Party a Possibility.
"1 lie possibility of a third party will |
arise,' said West, "if the Democrats
do not nominate a man with progressive
tendencies. Then a group of progres
sive Repubilcans and Democrats will
support a third candidate. Such a can- l
didate might carry six or eight states
in the northwest, and enough electoral
votes to keep the Republicans and
Democrats from winning.
West, however, believes that if there |
is a third party, the Democrats will win.
Especially with a man from a western '
state, running for an important office
and with popular candidates for gov
ernors and senators in New York, New '
Jersey, and Ohio, they will carry it, he J
thinks.

"As to the question of whether the !
investigation was made public at this !

West, head of the Political Science de

If McAdoo is nominated by the
Democrats, his election depends on the
combination of men who are put up for
other offices by the party, according to
West.
