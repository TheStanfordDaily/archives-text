# "TEAPOT DOME" AFFECTS PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS
## Professor West Believes That McAdoo's Chances Are But Slightly Injured 
### 
In regard to the coming clcctions
and their connection with the Teapot
Dome scandal, Professor Victor J.
West, head of the Political Science de
partment, said in an interview yester
day: "McAdoo was apparently elimi
nated from the presidential race, but
he will have one-third of the conven
tion, anyhow."
If McAdoo is nominated by the
Democrats, his election depends on the
combination of men who are put up for
other offices by the party, according to
West.
Democrats Had Advantage.
He says, "The Democrats had the
advantage, anyway, without this affair.
The wide dissatisfaction with the pres
ent administration was indicated in the
election of 1922, when the Democrats
were generally very successful.
"The Democrats were entirely suc
cessful in twenty-eight states, and the
Republicans in only eleven. If the

Democrats carried the same twenty
eight states in the presidential election,
they would win without trouble, as they
would have 329 electoral votes, sixty
more than are necessary to elect a
president."
State Elections Prophetic.
The 1922 state elections were proph
etic. according to West, because they
were statewide, and the candidates
made their appeals to the same elec
torate as in national elections.
Taking it for granted that some states
would change parties, which they prob
ably will, the Democrats would still be
safe on account of the southern states,
which have always voted the Demo
cratic ticket since the Civil War.
"The only thing that has happened
since 1922 to change the political sit
uation was the death of Harding, which
brought Coolidge into office. Mr. Cool
