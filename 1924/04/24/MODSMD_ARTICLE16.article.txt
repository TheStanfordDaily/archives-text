# CARDS FAVORED TO BEAT BEARS NEXT SATURDAY
## California Must Upset Dope In Six Events to Win Big Meet Classic 
### Wallace Knox 
\\ ith but two days remaining before
i the Stanford-California meet, little re
! mains that can be done, except to wait
i patiently until the time when the milers
; leave their marks at the report of the
j starter's gun. Then, the much looked
forward to Big Meet will be a reality.
Every conceivable indication points
to a Stanford victory. If the Bruins are
to win, they must upset the, dope in
| about six different events, which is an
j almost impossible task.
| Coach "Dink" Templeton has a well
| balanced team, with strength divided
among thirteen of the fifteen events,
1 he Cards are weak in the javelin throw,
and also in the broad jump. However,
the broad jump is the only event in
which the Redshirts have not a chance
to take first place.
Evers Improves.
Evers has been doing well in his prac
tice throws in the javelin during the
last week. It may be that he can toss it
185 feet, and if he does, he will be a
j potential contender for first. Even if he
! doesn't win he should slip in a throw
j that will give him a place.
Boren looks like a cinch in the broad
j jump by virtue of his leap of 24 feet
;1% inches against Illinois. Dick Mac
| Rae should get a second place, but
j Bondschu may beat him out.
Figures based on comparative per
: tormances in the different meets point
ito about a 79 to 52 score. However, if
j this is to be the result Scofield must
| win the pole vault, Anderson must win
or tie for first in the high* jump, and
Macßae must get a second in the
broad jump.
It is easily possible that the Bruins
can turn the trick in these events and
garner a few unexpected points. Upson
and Coates have not been doing much
in the pole vault all season, but if they
should have an "on" day Saturday, they
might get in ahead of Scofield and Den
nis in the event that the Card vaulters
are a bit off form.
High Jumps Doubtful.
Fred Anderson and Lou Kemnitzer
have been fairly consistent in the high
jump, although Anderson fell down in
the U. S. C. meet. Walter Christie
has a half dozen men who are likely to
get over 5 feet 11, and one or two of
them, particularly Witherspoon and
Garrett, may even clear six feet, and by
so doing threaten a first place for Stan
ford.
Although the Bears have a chance to
come through in the field events the
Cards have an equal chance to make
almost a clean sweept in the track
events.
Jim Barber's prestige took a decided
drop when he failed to win either oi
the sprints in the Illinois meet. Mar
shall Hale has come through in the
hundred all season, even against Cliff
Argue, when he was expected to lose,
and so he is just as likely as not to show
his heels to the California flash. Lan
Campbell and Louie Caspar are :10
flat men and they both are possibilities
for points in the hundred.
Campbell and Hale might place one,
two in the furlong. Campbell should
not have a great deal of trouble in win
ning the 220-yard dash, as none of the
Berkeley sprinters can begin to com
pare with him at this distance. Hale
has never been in stiff competition in
the furlong.
May Make Sweep.
In the quarter, half, mile, and two
mile the Redshirts have a good chance
of making a clean sweep.
Miller and Storie are in a class by
themselves and Captain Van Judah has
the ability to beat Hurst or Goertz.
Likewise, in the half with Richardson,
Mcintosh, Swayne, Daly, and Dole in
top form. Chase is likely to have a hard
time finishing better than sixth.
Milers Dependable.
In the mile Stanford is practically
certain of a clean sweep. Kerr, Smith,
and Elliott should not even have to ex
tend themselves to win. With Smith
and Kerr helping out in the two-mile
the men from the farm will try to place
three times in this distance. A1 Charles
is getting back into shape, and will
probably win with ease.
Leistner and Hartranft are cinches in
their respective events, but the Bears
may be able to gather in all of the sec
onds and thirds. Even if they do, it will
not dangerously threaten Stanford's
chances for a first in the meet.
The probable summary:
100-yard dash—Hale (S), and Barber
(C). tied; Shcpard (C), third.
.220-yard dash—Campbell (S), first;
Barber (C), second; Shepard (C), third.

Storie (S), second; Hurst (C), third.
<SBO-yard dash—Richardson (S), first;
Chase (C), second; Mcintosh (S),
third.
Mile run—Kerr (S), first; Smith (S),
second; Elliott (S), third.
Two-mile run—Charles (S), first;
Jensen (C), second; Kerr (S), third.
120-yard high hurdles—Leistner (S),
first; Becker (C), second; Boles (S),
third.
220-yard low hurdles—Leistner (S),
first; Becker (C), second; Ball (C),
third.
Relay—Stanford, first.
