# CARDS FAVORED TO BEAT BEARS NEXT SATURDAY
## California Must Upset Dope In Six Events to Win Big Meet Classic 
### Wallace Knox 
\\ ith but two days remaining before
i the Stanford-California meet, little re
! mains that can be done, except to wait
i patiently until the time when the milers
; leave their marks at the report of the
j starter's gun. Then, the much looked
forward to Big Meet will be a reality.
Every conceivable indication points
to a Stanford victory. If the Bruins are
to win, they must upset the, dope in
| about six different events, which is an
j almost impossible task.
| Coach "Dink" Templeton has a well
| balanced team, with strength divided
among thirteen of the fifteen events,
1 he Cards are weak in the javelin throw,
and also in the broad jump. However,
the broad jump is the only event in
which the Redshirts have not a chance
to take first place.
Evers Improves.
Evers has been doing well in his prac
tice throws in the javelin during the
last week. It may be that he can toss it
185 feet, and if he does, he will be a
j potential contender for first. Even if he
! doesn't win he should slip in a throw
j that will give him a place.
Boren looks like a cinch in the broad
j jump by virtue of his leap of 24 feet
;1% inches against Illinois. Dick Mac
| Rae should get a second place, but
j Bondschu may beat him out.
Figures based on comparative per
: tormances in the different meets point
ito about a 79 to 52 score. However, if
j this is to be the result Scofield must
| win the pole vault, Anderson must win
