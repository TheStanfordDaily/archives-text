# Hey, Gang, Charlie's Here

### 
Charles K. Field, '95, a member of the National Board, former presi
dent of the Alumni Association, one of the originators of University Day,
and one of Stanford's most prominent alumni, will have charge of a
student assembly tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock.
Just at first glance, an assembly featuring an old alumnus reading
some poems which he wrote while in college, may not appear very inter
esting to one who has never come into contact with Charles K. Field. To
those who know Field, the simple fact that he is to appear is enough to
assure them a most enjoyable hour.
Field is a man who will be interesting to every Stanford man and
woman. He is noted for his humor and ability to force an audience to
laugh with him. As a member of one of the earliest classes to graduate
from Stanford, he is a typical "old timer," full of stories and anecdotes
of the "good old days."
The poems he is to read tomorrow reflect the life students led here in
the first years of the university's existence. They are not dry and unin
tresting, but chuck full of the vigor and exuberance of a typical under
graduate. Field will be assisted in presenting his program by an old
classmate and "pardner in crime," Shirley Baker, and the Stanford Glee
Club. In addition to reading some of his poems, Field, with the assist
ance of Baker and the glee club, will present some songs composed at the
same time his poems were written.
Field is now editor of the Sunset Magazine and a man who is known
all over the United States. He is an active alumnus of whom Stanford
may well be proud.
The assembly tomorrow, contrary to precedent, has been arranged
entirely for the purpose of entertainment. It is a most fitting opening
for the week-end when Stanford alumni by the hundreds will return to
the campus. It will be a proper time for the meeting of all four sides of
Stanford life—an idea which Field originated. Trustees, faculty, alumni,
and students, all will find something of interest in the program.
Field, with his natural modesty, was rather dubious about putting on
such an assembly when it was first proposed to him. The large crowd of
students which will undoubtedly turn out to hear him, should assure Field
that his efforts are appreciated and that he is welcome on the Farm at any
time.

and students, all will find something of interest in the program.
Field, with his natural modesty, was rather dubious about putting on
such an assembly when it was first proposed to him. The large crowd of
students which will undoubtedly turn out to hear him, should assure Field
that his efforts are appreciated and that he is welcome on the Farm at any
time.
