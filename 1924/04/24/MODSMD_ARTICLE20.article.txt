Stanford University, Cal.
April 22, 1924.
Editor Daily Palo Alto, Campus:
Very recently the world has been
robbed of one of its greatest artists—
"La Duse."
Those of you who had the wonderful
privilege of seeing and hearing her this
season must have realized keenly the
greatness of her art; but let us not for
get that a great and beautiful art is the
product of a great and beautiful soul.
The soul of the frail, little Italian
woman, who glided upon the stage with
the lithe grace of a girl, gave us what
we called her "art." She knew the
greatest of all the secrets of her art —
that acting is an expression of the soul.
The voice and body to her were merely
instruments; and her whole attitude
breathed of that greatest of all charms
—sincerity.
A small nature can never produce
great art. Tier's was a nature of such
breadth and beauty as the world has
rarely seen. How can we overlook the
passing of such a one from us forever
without even the tribute of a passing
thought? If we reverence the great and
beautiful let us stop for a moment in
this busy life of ours and just breathe
the name "La Duse." It is a great
name and one which will always stand
for the highest art the stage world has
ever given us. It will always lift us
above the tawdry and common place
and, in a small way, might avert the
great tragedy of dramatic art—that
with the death of the actor, his art dies
also.
Let's not forget that she was great.
Let's not forget the strange, ringing
voice, the exquisite hands, and marvel
ously expressive face and body of
Eleonora Duse. And above all let us
not forget the gentle sincerity of her,
and the purity and beauty of such an
art as the world rarely knows.
Sincerely,
VIRGINIA J. HENDERSON.
Editor the D. P. A.:
Since my little outburst a few days
ago, there have been a number of com
ments and suggestions addressed to me
and I beg another inch or two of your
Viewpoint column to pass on a couple
of the suggestions—both from auto
owners.
The first was that a student cop force
or committee be put on the job to tone
down the recklessness. This has its
several drawbacks, however, and this
other suggestion seems a little better.
That the auto drivers themselves be
banded together either in an organiza
tion or by some sort of pledge or both,
to at least be reasonable and thus avert
any more or less unreasonable action
which might follow an accident.
To crystalize action, if the President
of the Student Body would appoint
someone to take the matter in hand and
find a solution there could be no harm
done, S. R. D. '22
