# Men Say Branner's Lights Are Turned Off Too Early
## 
### 
Complaints have been loged with the
custodian of Branner Hall that the
lights in the lobby are turned off too
early in the evening.
The custodian goes off duty at nine
o'clock and the rule requires that he
turn off the lobby lights at that time.
It is alleged that this docs not allow
the men to get the full benefit of the
lounging room.
The authorities are at work to adjust
the matter.
