# OXFORD TEAM WISHES TO DEBATE STANFORD
## 
### 
Requesting a debate with Stanford,
a letter has been received by President
Wilbur from the American representa
tives of the Debating Union of Oxford
University, England, stating that the
Oxford team will make a tour of the
Pacific Coast next fall.
It is planned that the Oxford team
will land in America in September.
They will meet the University of Mon
treal and other Canadian universities on
the way west, meet Washington, Cali
fornia, and Stanford on the coast, then
return east through the south.
Has Debated in East.
For the past two years an Oxford
team has come to this country to engage
in international debates, each time lim
iting its schedule to Princeton, Har
vard, Yale, and Bates. '' This year the
plan is for Cambridge to send a squad
to meet the schools on the eastern
coast and for Oxford to debate western
universities.
The trip is under the management
of the Institute of International Edu
cation, of New York. Dr. Stephen
Pierce Duggan, author of several books
on the League of Nations, is personally
making arrangements.
The Oxford men will all be graduate
students. Previously their teams have
been of undergraduates, but because
of this have been forced to return to
England for the beginning of the Mich
aelmas term in December. The team
next year will not return until Feb
ruary.
Oxford Teams Are World's Best.
For a number of years Oxford has
been regarded by debate authorities as
the producer of the best debating teams
in the world. Commenting on the pro
posed clash with Stanford, Professor
Lee Emerson Bassett, in charge of pub
lic speaking here, said, "If the contest
is arranged it will be probably the
greatest event in the history cf debate
at Stanford. The English style of de
bate is altogether different from that
known in American universities. Their
arguments are more informal, and di
rect to the audience. A Stanford-Ox
ford debate should be the forensic
classic of the west."
Debaters Are Famous.
Of the three men who composed the
last Oxford team to tour America, one
was the secretary of the National Con
servative party which turned Lloyd
George out of office, one was an ex
member of the upper legislative cham
ber of India, and the third was a pro
fessional humorous lecturer.
No question has yet been submitted,
and Oxford is requesting suggestions
from the American debaters.
The reply to the offer, sent by Pro
fessor Bassett, was a tentative accept
ance, contingent upon the allowance of
the debate budget by the 1924-25 exec
utive committee.
