### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Once upon a time, some 100,000 years ago, Ugly, the son of Ug, was playing
ball with his son, Plug. They used a rounded rock for a ball, and a big club
for a bat, if that interests you.
An old fossil by the name of %Wit was keeping score and umpiring for
them. "Cheep-cheap," the Illiothyptosus (a prehistoric canary) was snoozing
on a rock in the distance. Ugly was at bat, Plug pitching, no outs and the
bases full (of rocks). "Pitching to your father is no cinch," thought Plug.
"If I bean him he'll lick me," So he shot over a low curve which Ugly hit
to right field, where it landed, "Sock!" on Cheep-cheap's snoot, causing the
big bird to cry with rage. "Fowl Bawl," chiselled %Wit into the score card.
"Heh, heh, that's a good one!"
But the pre-historic canary was sore. So he soared over to where Ugly
was arguing with the Umps and picked him up by the seat of the Bear's skin
that he was wearing and flew off with him. Plug ran wildly along after his
father, calling him names. "Pop fly," pounded out VfeWit on the stone score
card. At which Cheep-cheap laughed so hard that he dropped Ugly to the
ground with a thud, thus originating the term, "short-stop."
