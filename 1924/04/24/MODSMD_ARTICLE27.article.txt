### 
Howard J. Hall of the English de
partment, profcssor*of American liter
ature, has recently completed a collec
tion of the poems of Benjamin Tomp
son, first native born American poet.
The books, which will be off the press
in a few weeks, is being pubilshed by
Houghton, Mifflin Co.
Benjamin Tompson (1642-1714) is
allied to some of the writers of today
by his disapproval of the younger gen
eration. Although the New England
of his day was but barely fifty years
old, he prophesied its swift decay and
social degeneration. His views were
expressed in vigorous satire which
smacked of Dryden in its wit and in its
style, rhymed pentameter couplets.
One can well picture his wrothy return
from a Harvard reunion to write a poem
voicing the standards of his day. His
best known work is "New England's
Crises," 1675, on King Philip's war.
