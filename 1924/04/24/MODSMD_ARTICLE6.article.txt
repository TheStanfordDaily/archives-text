# SHIFT MAY BE MADE IN LINE-UP DE CARD NINE FOR LAST GAME
## Roberts, Second Sacker, Ill; Draper May Replace Him Against Bruins By Bert Andrews 
### 
Unless "Shorty" Roberts, who has
been ill with an attack of tonsilitis, is
able to play in his position at second
base by Saturday, the varsity line-up
may be shifted for the third California
game.
Draper, substitute infielder, may re
place Roberts, with the rest of the
team taking the field as usual.
Another way in which Coach Wolter
may meet his difficulty will be to shift
Captain Woodward to second, with
Johnston covering first and Jim Law
son working behind the bat.
Varsity Trims Frosh
In short contests against the fresh
men, the Card varsity has continued
its batting streak and has pounded the
first-year hurlers for numerous runs.
Tuesday, the regulars ran up so
many runs against the frosh that the
scorer failed to keep up with the pro
cession.
In yesterday's session the numbers
of runs finally tallied by the varsity
was well over the twenty mark.
Every man on the team is slugging
the ball in a fashion which bodes ill
for the hurler who is sent against
Stanford by the Bears.
Nevers May Start
Since Nevers has shown ability to
keep the Bears off the bases in the
first two games of the series, he will
probably be Wolter's choice for the
pitching burden in the deciding con
test.
Nevers' hitting in the two contests
has disproved the theory that a pitch
er is supposed to have a weak batting
average. If he can crash out another
homer in the last game he will accom
plish a feat which no Stanford or Cali
fornia player has ever yet done, name
ly making one home run in each of
the three games of the series.

If the cells of the lungs were spread
out fiat they would form a surface of
480 square feet.
