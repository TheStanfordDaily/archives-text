# USES AND DANGERS OF PROPERTY RIGHT SHOWN BY HADLEY
## 
### 
That economic antagonisms have
| arisen between classes as the direct
I result of business consolidations, mak
| ing the property right as dangerous as
| it is helpful to security, is the opinion
I of Dr. Arthur Twining Hadley, presi-
I dent emeritus of Yale, who lectured
i last night on the "Uses and Dangers
j of Property Right."
Dr. Hadley will give his final lecture
tonight at 8:30 in the Assembly hall.
His concluding talk will deal with
"The Uses and Dangers of Representa
tive Government."
Selfish Motive Necessary
"Private property is the only way
i of securing the habit of conservation,"
said Dr. Hadley. "The selfish motive
is necessary to make man take care
of his possessions. The primitive would
j not care for his bow if every other
j member of the tribe were permitted
I to use it."
j Dr. Hadley questioned the conten
j tion that public ownership has worked
i as well as private. "For example," he
| said, "the public highways of our time
i are in much the same condition as
| the public slaves of ancient Greece —
| no one is willing to provide for the
i necessary repairs."
j The speaker gave the following defi-
I nition of liberty: "Liberty is the
| power to use intelligence as the de
: termining factor in our conduct." The
I modern method is to allow the indi
j vidual to meet the needs of the com-
J munity in his own way, with the re
j suit that the public at large benefits
I by the experiments of its members."
