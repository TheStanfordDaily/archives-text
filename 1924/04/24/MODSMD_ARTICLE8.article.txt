# ANNUAL UNIVERSITY DAY PLANS WORKED OUT BY COMMITTEE
## Alumni Gathering Will Draw Record Total of Grads to "Farm" Saturday 
### 
Alumni Day and the Big Track Meet
with California fall on the same day for
the first time in Stanford history, Satur
day. The combined attraction of a Big
Meet and University Day seems hard
for old-timers to resist, as over one
thousand have already signified their in
tention of throwing off the dull burden
of care and returning to the Farm for
a big week end.
The University Day committee, headed
by Charles P. Cuttcn, '99, has worked
out a program which should meet the
highest expectations of any of the re
turning alumni. It is the object of the
committee to have every old grad leave
with the desire to come back next year.
Special Reunions Planned
A number of special class and or
ganization reunions have been planned
for Saturday. Probably the biggest of
them will be the '99 gathering. The
ninety-niners are celebrating their twenty
fifth anniversary, and they will be the
guests of President and Mrs. Wilbur at
luncheon Saturday. Practically all living
groups on the campus are holding "open
house" for their alumni and friends.
The program arranged for the return
ing grads leaves the morning free for
them to do whatever appeals to them
most. Student guides will be provided
to conduct trips to old and new parts of
the campus, and the high school track
meet in the morning may attract some;
but most of the alumni will probably
prefer to use the morning to reacquaint
themselves with their alma mater.
The afternoon's program begins with
various class organization and group
luncheons. At 1:30 everyone on the cam
pus will assemble in the stadium to wit
ness the annual Stanford-California
track meet. The athletic program will
be concluded with the deciding contest
