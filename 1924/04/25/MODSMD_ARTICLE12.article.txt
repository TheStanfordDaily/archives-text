# DOPE FAVORS STANFORD TO AVENGE FOUR YEARS' DEFEAT
## Entire Squad Is In Best Of Shape; Hartranft, Hale, Miller, and Kerr May Break Records 
### Howard Bissell 
WHEN the Cardinal trackmen enter the football stadium for the Big Meet on
the new oval tomorrow afternoon, each man will be prepared to give
everything in an endeavor to swamp the Bruin rivals by the largest score
possible, and thereby avenge four successive defeats.
And among these thirty-odd Stanford entries will be at least four men who
will be watched with particular interest. "Tiny" Hartranft is expected to

'break records in the discus and shot;
Hale is looked to for a first place and
possibly a record in the 100; Miller
should easily break the existing mark
of 50 flat in the 440 with his previous
times of 49 6-10; Kerr will try for a
new mark in the mile run, hoping to
reduce the present time of 4:20 1-5.
Bears Enter Sixty-Eight
California will enter sixty-eight men
with the hope of holding the Cardinal
score down, taking advantage of
breaks, and forcing her way into the
lead, if possible, at an opportune mo
ment. Neufeld and Barber are the out
standing performers on the Bear
squad. Captain Neufeldt will probably
be high-point man in the meet with a
first in the javelin, and seconds in
both the shot and discus.
Barber will run a close century with
Hale and has the advantage from the
point of dope with his consistent times
of 9 9-10. Witherspoon will press An
derson in the high jump, and Upson
is decidedly in the running in the
pole vault with a height of 12 feet 1
inch made a week ago in the Illinois
meet. Boren is counted on by the Blue
and Gold supporters for a new record
in the broad jump, as the result of his
jump ol 24 feet 1 7-S inches last week.
Cards in Fine Shape
All of the Cardinal squad is in the
best shape and condition, and no alibis
will be forthcoming on the outcome
of the meet, according to Coach "Dink"
Templeton. Charles is ready to take
the lead in the two-mile, and Scofield
can be counted on for his best in the
pole vault. With these two men back
in shape, and with Storie in the pink
of condition, no gaps are left in the
Card entry lists
Dope sheets turned If.t Lailf
predict an outcome of from 65 to 100
points for the varsity. The winner of
the contest held this week will be
made known on Monday and the two
tickets to the Junior Opera, offered by
Roos brothers, will be awarded at that
time.
