# GLAMOR AND MERRIMENT TO DISTINGUISH MASQUE
## 
### 
(As chronicled and writ hereto by one
Bradley Riter by command and entreaty
of Their Majesties, and directed to
the populace of the Stanford Empire.)

¥N the presence of all ye hereunto assembled, be it. known that every and
each loyal and devoted subject of the realm should hie himself and herself
hence to the feast and Masque celebration gorgeous on the morrow evening

in the King's and Queen's palatial
pavilion. For ere the timepiece has
chimed the count of nine, the festivi
ties will have begun.
Anon withal, there will come upon
Their Majesties into the royal hall,
tlioy sitting in their throne royals, a
high minister or coronator who goeth
by the affixed name of Sir Hollis Chal
mers, bearing two coronets, a tribute
award to Their Excellencies from the
people great.
They then will kneel, surrounded

. . ■ | _
by noble knights and beauteous dam
sels of the court, and the said corona
tor will, with due ceremony and ab
sence of lnger, crown and confer upon
them the right to the title of King
: and Queen
of the mighty Stanford Empire where
the life color is red.
Now turn we unto the scene to the
extent of one hour later, for at that
established time will the rulers regal
present in elaborate manner an enter
tainment program that has never
•within this realm been surpassed
heretofore. Right truly pretty-looking
damsels, garnered from every corner
of the empire, will dance and sing as
one in two carefully-rehearsed acts.
And so the masqueraders may know
their identities as they whirl here
and from, to and fro, their names are
written here:
Eugenia Bentley, Dorothy Dahler,
Margaret Harroun, Elyse Braunchwei
ger, Margaret Randall, Marjorie An
derson, Janett Craig, and Muriel
Saxon.
Human Organ Will Perform
Now shall we speak of the next skit
in which is featured that facetious

funny subject, Arnold Bayley, the
human organ. Ah, sirs, and ladies,
what he shall perform will make you
truly laugh; for in prima donna man
ner will he give a most comical and
elusive operatic recital.
Remember ye not of those two
slippery-footed dancers in the year's
present Heads of Rams performance,
how they did wriggle and toss their
foot appendages in such almost in
extricable manner of way? Be it
known that they, too, will perform
likewise which is enough sufficient to
note at this moment. Their names are
Ted Van Deusen and Gardiner Lip
pincott.
So-called "roughs" are invited
cordially and may witness all the
elaborate proceedings after the hour
of ten after parting with but 25 pence
each.
