# They're Off!

Tomorrow afternoon on the Stadium track, two of the strongest teams
in the United States will battle for supremacy. For the thirty-first time
since 1893, Stanford and California cinder path stars will clash.
In thirty contests, the Golden Bear has won fifteen, Stanford thirteen,
and two have been ties. Stanford has not won a Big Meet since 1919.
Previous to that year, the Cardinal had triumphed for seven successive
years.
These are a few of the facts that make the prospect of victory tomorrow
look sweet to Cardinal followers. "Dink" Templefon, in his fourth year as
Stanford track coach has done wonders. Nearly every man on the team
has been developed. Very few of Templeton's men came to him as high
school stars. The building up process has been a long and tedious one,
but the Cardinal mentor has proved equal to the task and the results of his
admirable work will show up on the morrow.
Stanford goes into the Big Meet this year, doped to win. It may not
be an easy victory, but the Daily Palo Alto believes that it will be a VIC
TORY. Whether the margin of difference is one or sixty-one points,
when a Cardinal track team defeats its Golden Bear rival, there is just
cause for celebration.
Tomorrow's meet will be watched by athletic enthusiasts all over the
country, for some of America's best track athletes will be in action.
The Daily Palo Alto has a great deal of confidence in "Dink" Tem
pleton's performers. They have proved themselves in competition and
can be counted on to be at their best tomorrow.
Then, again, a Stanford athlete is always capable of his best perform
ance against California. Walter Christie's team can also be expected to
be on hand with a few surprises.
A Stanford track victory will be an appropriate start for the 1924
athletic season. All power to you, track team, GO GET 'EM.
