The Daily Palo Alto takes this opportunity to extend the glad hand of
welcome to some one thousand alumni who will be on the campus this
week end.
There is no group of people in the world that the undergraduates would
rather see than the alumni. They are a fine bunch and every student is
proud of them. The old-timers are usually mighty glad to get back to the
Farm, too, and it isn't very hard to entertain them.
Right at this point, the Daily makes a bow to Alumni Secretary Mc-
Dowell, and all the University Day committees who have helped in the
splendid arrangements. Every living group on the campus is throwing its
doors wide open tomorrow in an effort to make the alumni return seem
like a real homecoming. With prospects so bright for a double victory—
in track and baseball, it should indeed seem like old times.
University Day, as it was originated, and has been practiced, is one of
the best possible ways to bring the alumni in close touch with the under
graduates and keep them "in tune."
And so, old timers, come in and make yourselves at home. We hope
you enjoy being here as much as we do having you back again.
