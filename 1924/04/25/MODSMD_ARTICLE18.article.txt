# ALUMNI DAY IS LONG ESTABLISHED CUSTOM SAYS J. E. McDOWELL
## New Plan Brings Graduates in Closer Touch With Student Life 
### 
Alumni Day during Commencement
Week is a long-established tradition in
American universities, and always at
that time (at least according to en
thusiastic accounts published in alum
ni magazines) enjoyable and success
ful times are "had by all present."
In reality, except for a few who are
attracted for some particular purpose,
Alumni Day usually brings the same
small group of nearby alumni, who
always find, except for the seniors
who remain for Commencement, a de
serted campus, and uninhabited but
dirty, dusty, and uninviting dormi
tories and fraternity houses; and with !
the exception of a gathering of the!
clans at luncheon, the day is spent in ,
wandering about the campus, chatting
with friends, and dreaming about the
Good Old Days.
Actual Experience
This is the actual experience of
most universities, in spite of the opti- i
mistic reports of the festivities that
are always broadcasted to the college
world.
Weary of the constant strain and
effort of attempting to make Alumni j
Day a success at Commencement time,
and realizing the great possibilities of ;
a home-coming when the University
was in full swing, a few of the ever- j
faithful decided four years ago to at- j
tempt an alumni home-coming or re-!
union during the spring quarter, hop

ing to enlist the interest and co-opera
tion of faculty and students in making
the affair a genuine University Day.
First University Day
The first University Day, held in
May, 1920, arranged on four weeks'
notice, proved a great success, and
each year the number of returning
alumni has increased, the interest of
the faculty has become greater, and
the enthusiasm and responsibility of
the students have become more and
more an important factor, until now
University Day is no longer an experi
ment, but an established tradition in
Stanford life.
