# MEN OF '97 REPLACE OLD NUMERAL PLATE
## 
### 
Returning members of the class of
'97 will replace tomorrow the bronze
class plate which they laid in the floor
of the arcade in front of the Memorial
Church twenty-seven years ago with a
new one conforming with the design
of the other thirty-two tablets.
Ninety-seven was the second class
to lay a memorial tablet in the flagging
of the arcade, with a lead box beneath
it containing its class rolls and other
contemporary records, on Commence
ment Day, the custom having been in
augurated by '96. Its plate was of a
different pattern from that of '96, but
all succeeding classes have followed
the stvle set by the first class.
