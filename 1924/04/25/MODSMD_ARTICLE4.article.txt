Holtecamp (O. C.); Schall (S), middleweight, lost to Deal (O. C.); and
Farmin (S) lost to Emanuel (unattached) in the light-heavyweight division.
Martin seemed to have the advantage for the first round and put over a
number of punishing rights and lefts. Holtecamp's punches, on the other
hand, lacked weight, except for one which caught Martin off his guard in

the second round, knocking him out. <
Schall, middleweight, failed to put
up th*- showing expected of him on of
fense and was outpointed by Deal.
Fannin, light-heavy, lost to Emanuel
after two fast rounds when Coach
Harry Maloney called the fight to save
the former from further punishment.

Mancuso (Humboldt Athletic Club) in
a slow bout for a featherweight fight.

the second, but came back in the third
round and took the decision.
Ray Fee, only entrant in the fly
weight class and champion in his
weight of the Olympic Club for many
years, boxed a fast exhibition at tiiis
point with Mazoau of the "Winged O,"
only entrant in the bantamweight
class.

vision, Sweeney a high school boy
from Humboldt Evening school, who

Yont (O. C.) was forced to go two
extra rounds to cinch his win over
Wilman (O. C.) in the heavyweight

slow on their feet and depended on
hard jabs to the wind and face for
their points.
