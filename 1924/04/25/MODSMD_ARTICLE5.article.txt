# CARD NINE BATTLES BEARS FOR 1924 CHAMPIONSHIP
## Nevers Will Oppose Nounan On Mound; Roberts to Play on Second 
### Bert Andrews 
With the stage all set for the final
act of the 1924 baseball drama, the
Stanford varsity will take the field
against the California team tomorrow
afternoon prepared to wrest the dia
mond championship from the Bears.
Prospects for the return of "Shorty"
Roberts to second base look bright
since he is reported as being almost
entirely well. This, and the fact that
Nounan, the Bruin pitching ace, has
had a week's rest, removes any possi
ble alibi that either team could have
for playing a poor game.
Nevers Will Oppose Nounan
Ernie Nevers will take the mound
for Stanford and will have as his pitch-1
ing opponent, Jack Nounan. Nevers is j
the most dependable hurler on the
Cardinal staff and, with any justice at
all, should hold the Bear sluggers to a
small number of hits.
Infield Plays Air-Tight Ball
The Stanford infield, after making
several errors in the opening contest,
came back and played air-tight ball
against the Bears last week.
Captain Woodward on first, Roberts
or Draper at second, Mulchay at short
and Cuddeback covering the third baÂ£,
will comprise the inner defense of the
Cardinal nine. |
For California, Kyte will cover the
initial base, Russell and King will pro
tect the center of the infield, and Cap
tain Duffy Gerlach will be on the hot
corner.
Card Outfield Looks Good
Coach Wolter's outfield trio, com
posed of Fuller, McCandless, and May,
are on a par with Morse, Sears, and
Smith, who will chase flies in the
outer territory for the Bears.
For the Farm team, "Chuck" John
ston will be behind the bat, and Loynd
will handle the curves of the Blue and
Gold hurler.
The game will start at 3:30 on the
varsity diamond and those who attend
the track meet will have to leave
early to get a seat for the contest. I
