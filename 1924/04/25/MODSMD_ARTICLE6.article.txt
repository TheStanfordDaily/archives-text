Close scores in the Alpha Delta Phi-
Signia Nu and the Chi Psi-Delta Tau
Delta contests, and a walk-away for
Delta Kappa Epsilon against Sigma
Chi featured the intramural baseball
games played yesterday. Alpha Delta
Phi won 9 to 8, Chi Psi beat Delta Tau
1 to 0, and Delta Kappa Epsilon took
its game 14 to 2. The Kappa Sigma-
Zeta Psi game was not played,
Ditzler, on the mound for Chi Psi,
won his own game, and Incidentally
broke up a pitching duel against Col
lett of Delta Tau Delta, when he dou
bled in the third with one on.
The Alpha Delt-Slgma Nu contest
was fast, although the Alpha Delts
led all the time. Roy Dennis, of Alpha
Delta Phi, and Jim Aydelott, Sigma
Nu, did the twirling.
