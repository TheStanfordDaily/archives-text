# "DINOSAUR'S EGGS" TELL EARLY LIFE OF UNIVERSITY
## Verses of Charles K. Field Represent Spirit of Pioneer Class 
### 
Charles K. Field's "Nest of Dino
saur's Eggs," so-called "because it
is the lay of ttie first minstrel" gave
the undergraduates an enviable
picture of the spirit and youth in the
early days of the University.
"The red wine," so often referred
to in Field's songs, "was not alcohol,"
said Dr. Jordan. "It was the symbol
of youth and the greater things to
come."
"I wish San Francisquito creek were
plumb full of wine," quoted Field to
show the exhuberance of the early
students.
The days of '91 are chronicled in the
two rollicking songs, "Stanford Red"
and "Drinking Song," written by
Field which the Glee Club sang.
Fraternity Of Faculty And Students
"Honor Among Thieves," a poem
Field recited commemorating the
fraternity of faculty and student in
the Stanford vineyard, shows that the
youthful spirit was not entirely con
fined to the undergraduates.
Shirley Baker, '95, sang his and
Field's opinion of the "Ideal Co-ed."
His sentiments were echoed by the
present generation of students in the
Glee Club.
Final Song Lacks Symathy
Field apologized for his final song
as being in bad taste, since perhaps
it contained a note lacking sympathy
with the Blue and Gold. "The glitter
of the glamor is no more," a quota
tion from a California professor who
was referring to Stanford three weeks
after its establishment, was borrowed
to describe California following its
first defeat from the Cardinal
"Tomorrow," said Field, "I am going
over and sing that same song to the
crowd from Berkeley."
"That Cold, Cold World," (after
graduation) , sung in duet by Baker
and Field, who wrote it, completed
the program.
