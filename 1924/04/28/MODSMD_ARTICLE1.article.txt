# CARDS TAKE FIRST CINDERPATH VICTORY SINCE 1919 CONTEST
## Four Records Are Broken in Meet Saturday; Leistner, Hartranft Tie For High Point Honors 
### Howard Bissell 
■EVERYTHING was Cardinal Saturday afternoon when Coach "Dink" Temple
" ton's track team defeated the Golden Bear squad, for the first time in
five years, by a score of 83 to 4S.
Four Stanford-California records went by the boards, and one other was
equalled, despite the strong wind on the track and the slowness of the new
oval. "Tiny" Hartranft came through with his expected ten points and raised
the records in both the shot and discus; Miller did the expected in the
quarter-mile, lobbing off half a second from the existing record; Boren of
California increased the broad jump distance by one-quarter of an inch; and
Campbell beat out Hale for first in the hundred in 10 fiat, equalling the record
held jointly by five other runners. "Swede" Leistner tied with Hartranft for
high point honors by taking first in both of the hurdle events.

Neufeldt Rates Third
Neufeldt, who was rated as possible J
high-point man, dropped into third place |
when his teammate, V. Dodson, sprang l
a big surprise in the javelin and won the
event with a toss of 190 feet, within 3
feet 5 inchcs of the record made last
year by Sorrenti of California. Neu
feldt had to be content with three sec
onds, placing in the discus and shot next
to Hartranft, and in the javelin, totalling
9 points.
Dope Upsets Numerous
Upsets galore added immensely to the
interest of the meet, with the supreme
satisfaction to Stanford rooters of seeing
the breaks adding to the Cardinal score
rather than to the Bruin total as in for
mer years. Hale won the 220, with
Campbell second; after Campbell had
previously shoved Hale out of first place
in the century. Barber failed to place
in the hundred and took a poor third in
the furlong. Boles stumbled after clear
ing the ninth hurdle in the 220-yard race,
and Becker stumbled on the last one,
allowing two California men, Morris
and Corley, who had never been consid
ered in the running, to place.
Ludeke Ties With Witherspoon
Ludeke came through unexpectedly in
the high jump with a tie with Wither
spoon of California for second at a
previous inning, Coach Zamloch's war
riors started after the tying run in the
ninth. King smashed a hot one through
Cuddeback for a single. Teague was
jerked from the box and Oviatt took
his place.
Stitt sacrificed King to second. Kytc,
after fouling several over the third base
bleachers, was walked by Oviatt. Loynd,
another California pinch hitter, was safe
on a fielder's choice, Kyte being thrown
out at second. Nicholas was sent in to
run for Loynd.
And then Oviatt heaved the ball to
Woodward, who caught Nicholas a foot
off the bag.
Stanford, California Count in Hhird
The Berkeley team drew first blood in
the third when Smith and Rossell sin
gled in succession, the former scored on
a squeeze play, when King laid one down
to Woodward at first. Roberts covered
first and took "Bud's" throw, getting
King, but allowing Smith to count.
Stanford evened things in its half of
the inning when, with two out, Roberts
got on on the first baseman's error and
stole second. Woodward singled through
first base, scoring Roberts.
With three on base in the fourth, Cud
deback tripled into center field, clearing
the bases and putting the Stanford var
sity three runs to the good. The ball lit
in front of the center fielder and bounced
over his head.
In the sixth, Fuller, first up for the
Cardinals, doubled down the third base
line and scored when the Bear infielders
booted Mulchay's attempted sacrifice.
Stanford broke into the scoring col
umn for the last time in the seventh,
when two runs were counted on a walk,
a single and a pair of errors on the part
of the Bears' inner defense.

■EVERYTHING was Cardinal Saturday afternoon when Coach "Dink" Temple
" ton's track team defeated the Golden Bear squad, for the first time in
five years, by a score of 83 to 4S.
Four Stanford-California records went by the boards, and one other was
equalled, despite the strong wind on the track and the slowness of the new
oval. "Tiny" Hartranft came through with his expected ten points and raised
the records in both the shot and discus; Miller did the expected in the
quarter-mile, lobbing off half a second from the existing record; Boren of
California increased the broad jump distance by one-quarter of an inch; and
Campbell beat out Hale for first in the hundred in 10 fiat, equalling the record
held jointly by five other runners. "Swede" Leistner tied with Hartranft for
high point honors by taking first in both of the hurdle events.

Neufeldt Rates Third
Neufeldt, who was rated as possible J
high-point man, dropped into third place |
when his teammate, V. Dodson, sprang l
a big surprise in the javelin and won the
event with a toss of 190 feet, within 3
feet 5 inchcs of the record made last
year by Sorrenti of California. Neu
feldt had to be content with three sec
onds, placing in the discus and shot next
to Hartranft, and in the javelin, totalling
9 points.
Dope Upsets Numerous
Upsets galore added immensely to the
interest of the meet, with the supreme
satisfaction to Stanford rooters of seeing
the breaks adding to the Cardinal score
rather than to the Bruin total as in for
mer years. Hale won the 220, with
Campbell second; after Campbell had
previously shoved Hale out of first place
in the century. Barber failed to place
in the hundred and took a poor third in
the furlong. Boles stumbled after clear
ing the ninth hurdle in the 220-yard race,
and Becker stumbled on the last one,
allowing two California men, Morris
and Corley, who had never been consid
ered in the running, to place.
Ludeke Ties With Witherspoon
Ludeke came through unexpectedly in
the high jump with a tie with Wither
spoon of California for second at a
previous inning, Coach Zamloch's war
riors started after the tying run in the
ninth. King smashed a hot one through
Cuddeback for a single. Teague was
jerked from the box and Oviatt took
his place.
Stitt sacrificed King to second. Kytc,
after fouling several over the third base
bleachers, was walked by Oviatt. Loynd,
another California pinch hitter, was safe
on a fielder's choice, Kyte being thrown
out at second. Nicholas was sent in to
run for Loynd.
And then Oviatt heaved the ball to
Woodward, who caught Nicholas a foot
off the bag.
Stanford, California Count in Hhird
The Berkeley team drew first blood in
the third when Smith and Rossell sin
gled in succession, the former scored on
a squeeze play, when King laid one down
to Woodward at first. Roberts covered
first and took "Bud's" throw, getting
King, but allowing Smith to count.
Stanford evened things in its half of
the inning when, with two out, Roberts
got on on the first baseman's error and
stole second. Woodward singled through
first base, scoring Roberts.
With three on base in the fourth, Cud
deback tripled into center field, clearing
the bases and putting the Stanford var
sity three runs to the good. The ball lit
in front of the center fielder and bounced
over his head.
In the sixth, Fuller, first up for the
Cardinals, doubled down the third base
line and scored when the Bear infielders
booted Mulchay's attempted sacrifice.
Stanford broke into the scoring col
umn for the last time in the seventh,
when two runs were counted on a walk,
a single and a pair of errors on the part
of the Bears' inner defense.

9 points.
Dope Upsets Numerous
Upsets galore added immensely to the
interest of the meet, with the supreme
satisfaction to Stanford rooters of seeing
the breaks adding to the Cardinal score
rather than to the Bruin total as in for
mer years. Hale won the 220, with
Campbell second; after Campbell had
previously shoved Hale out of first place
in the century. Barber failed to place
in the hundred and took a poor third in
the furlong. Boles stumbled after clear
ing the ninth hurdle in the 220-yard race,
and Becker stumbled on the last one,
allowing two California men, Morris
and Corley, who had never been consid
ered in the running, to place.
Ludeke Ties With Witherspoon
Ludeke came through unexpectedly in
the high jump with a tie with Wither
spoon of California for second at a
previous inning, Coach Zamloch's war
riors started after the tying run in the
ninth. King smashed a hot one through
Cuddeback for a single. Teague was
jerked from the box and Oviatt took
his place.
Stitt sacrificed King to second. Kytc,
after fouling several over the third base
bleachers, was walked by Oviatt. Loynd,
another California pinch hitter, was safe
on a fielder's choice, Kyte being thrown
out at second. Nicholas was sent in to
run for Loynd.
And then Oviatt heaved the ball to
Woodward, who caught Nicholas a foot
off the bag.
Stanford, California Count in Hhird
The Berkeley team drew first blood in
the third when Smith and Rossell sin
gled in succession, the former scored on
a squeeze play, when King laid one down
to Woodward at first. Roberts covered
first and took "Bud's" throw, getting
King, but allowing Smith to count.
Stanford evened things in its half of
the inning when, with two out, Roberts
got on on the first baseman's error and
stole second. Woodward singled through
first base, scoring Roberts.
With three on base in the fourth, Cud
deback tripled into center field, clearing
the bases and putting the Stanford var
sity three runs to the good. The ball lit
in front of the center fielder and bounced
over his head.
In the sixth, Fuller, first up for the
Cardinals, doubled down the third base
line and scored when the Bear infielders
booted Mulchay's attempted sacrifice.
Stanford broke into the scoring col
umn for the last time in the seventh,
when two runs were counted on a walk,
a single and a pair of errors on the part
of the Bears' inner defense.

■EVERYTHING was Cardinal Saturday afternoon when Coach "Dink" Temple
" ton's track team defeated the Golden Bear squad, for the first time in
five years, by a score of 83 to 4S.
Four Stanford-California records went by the boards, and one other was
equalled, despite the strong wind on the track and the slowness of the new
oval. "Tiny" Hartranft came through with his expected ten points and raised
the records in both the shot and discus; Miller did the expected in the
quarter-mile, lobbing off half a second from the existing record; Boren of
California increased the broad jump distance by one-quarter of an inch; and
Campbell beat out Hale for first in the hundred in 10 fiat, equalling the record
held jointly by five other runners. "Swede" Leistner tied with Hartranft for
high point honors by taking first in both of the hurdle events.

Neufeldt Rates Third
Neufeldt, who was rated as possible J
high-point man, dropped into third place |
when his teammate, V. Dodson, sprang l
a big surprise in the javelin and won the
event with a toss of 190 feet, within 3
feet 5 inchcs of the record made last
year by Sorrenti of California. Neu
feldt had to be content with three sec

to Hartranft, and in the javelin, totalling
9 points.

■EVERYTHING was Cardinal Saturday afternoon when Coach "Dink" Temple
" ton's track team defeated the Golden Bear squad, for the first time in
five years, by a score of 83 to 4S.
Four Stanford-California records went by the boards, and one other was
equalled, despite the strong wind on the track and the slowness of the new
oval. "Tiny" Hartranft came through with his expected ten points and raised
the records in both the shot and discus; Miller did the expected in the
quarter-mile, lobbing off half a second from the existing record; Boren of
California increased the broad jump distance by one-quarter of an inch; and
Campbell beat out Hale for first in the hundred in 10 fiat, equalling the record
held jointly by five other runners. "Swede" Leistner tied with Hartranft for
high point honors by taking first in both of the hurdle events.

Neufeldt Rates Third
Neufeldt, who was rated as possible J
high-point man, dropped into third place |
when his teammate, V. Dodson, sprang l
a big surprise in the javelin and won the
event with a toss of 190 feet, within 3
feet 5 inchcs of the record made last
year by Sorrenti of California. Neu
feldt had to be content with three sec
onds, placing in the discus and shot next
to Hartranft, and in the javelin, totalling
9 points.
Dope Upsets Numerous
Upsets galore added immensely to the
interest of the meet, with the supreme
satisfaction to Stanford rooters of seeing
the breaks adding to the Cardinal score
rather than to the Bruin total as in for
mer years. Hale won the 220, with
Campbell second; after Campbell had
previously shoved Hale out of first place
in the century. Barber failed to place
in the hundred and took a poor third in
the furlong. Boles stumbled after clear
ing the ninth hurdle in the 220-yard race,
and Becker stumbled on the last one,
allowing two California men, Morris
and Corley, who had never been consid
ered in the running, to place.
Ludeke Ties With Witherspoon
Ludeke came through unexpectedly in
the high jump with a tie with Wither
spoon of California for second at a
previous inning, Coach Zamloch's war
riors started after the tying run in the
ninth. King smashed a hot one through
Cuddeback for a single. Teague was
jerked from the box and Oviatt took
his place.
Stitt sacrificed King to second. Kytc,
after fouling several over the third base
bleachers, was walked by Oviatt. Loynd,
another California pinch hitter, was safe
on a fielder's choice, Kyte being thrown
out at second. Nicholas was sent in to
run for Loynd.
And then Oviatt heaved the ball to
Woodward, who caught Nicholas a foot
off the bag.
Stanford, California Count in Hhird
The Berkeley team drew first blood in
the third when Smith and Rossell sin
gled in succession, the former scored on
a squeeze play, when King laid one down
to Woodward at first. Roberts covered
first and took "Bud's" throw, getting
King, but allowing Smith to count.
Stanford evened things in its half of
the inning when, with two out, Roberts
got on on the first baseman's error and
stole second. Woodward singled through
first base, scoring Roberts.
With three on base in the fourth, Cud
deback tripled into center field, clearing
the bases and putting the Stanford var
sity three runs to the good. The ball lit
in front of the center fielder and bounced
over his head.
In the sixth, Fuller, first up for the
Cardinals, doubled down the third base
line and scored when the Bear infielders
booted Mulchay's attempted sacrifice.
Stanford broke into the scoring col
umn for the last time in the seventh,
when two runs were counted on a walk,
a single and a pair of errors on the part
of the Bears' inner defense.
