### Howard Bissell 
■EVERYTHING was Cardinal Saturday afternoon when Coach "Dink" Temple
" ton's track team defeated the Golden Bear squad, for the first time in
five years, by a score of 83 to 4S.
Four Stanford-California records went by the boards, and one other was
equalled, despite the strong wind on the track and the slowness of the new
oval. "Tiny" Hartranft came through with his expected ten points and raised
the records in both the shot and discus; Miller did the expected in the
quarter-mile, lobbing off half a second from the existing record; Boren of
California increased the broad jump distance by one-quarter of an inch; and
Campbell beat out Hale for first in the hundred in 10 fiat, equalling the record
held jointly by five other runners. "Swede" Leistner tied with Hartranft for
high point honors by taking first in both of the hurdle events.

Neufeldt Rates Third
Neufeldt, who was rated as possible J
high-point man, dropped into third place |
when his teammate, V. Dodson, sprang l
a big surprise in the javelin and won the
event with a toss of 190 feet, within 3
feet 5 inchcs of the record made last
year by Sorrenti of California. Neu
feldt had to be content with three sec
onds, placing in the discus and shot next
to Hartranft, and in the javelin, totalling
9 points.
Dope Upsets Numerous
Upsets galore added immensely to the
interest of the meet, with the supreme
satisfaction to Stanford rooters of seeing
the breaks adding to the Cardinal score
rather than to the Bruin total as in for
mer years. Hale won the 220, with
Campbell second; after Campbell had
previously shoved Hale out of first place
in the century. Barber failed to place
in the hundred and took a poor third in
the furlong. Boles stumbled after clear
ing the ninth hurdle in the 220-yard race,
and Becker stumbled on the last one,
allowing two California men, Morris
and Corley, who had never been consid
ered in the running, to place.
