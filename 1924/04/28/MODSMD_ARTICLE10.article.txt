# FULLER AND SAXON RULE AT GAY CARNIVAL MASQUE
## 
### 
Dana Fuller and Muriel Saxon for
sook their roles as Stanford students
for one evening, and were crowned
King and Queen of the second annual
A. S. S. U. Masque Ball Friday night
in the pavilion. Hollis Chalmers, in an
"elaborate" pantomine ceremony, coro
nated them Monarchs of Merriment
shortly after 10 o'clock.
Spectacular Lighting
A wild, colorful, and hectic night it
was, and the lighting was most con
spicuous in making it so. Red, green,
blue, purple, and white "spots" were
played on a glass ball suspended from
the center of the pavilion, and as the
sphere slowly revolved, hundreds of
stars of various colors were reflected
overhead and on the floor below. It
was a beautiful and artistic concep
tion and had much to do with en
couraging an exhuberant and enthusi-1
astic spirit of carnival among the
merrymakers.
Costumes Original
The costumes were numerous and
spectacular, several of them showing
considerable originality. All were re
quired to wear domino masks until j
after the coronation ceremony, so that j

when the time for unmasking came,
merry and joyous was the spirit of
discovery.
Arnold Bayley, without doubt, head
lined the variety bill of four acts which
was presented at 11 o'clock. Garbed in
an exquisite gown, Madame Blitzen,
whoever she is, proved to be a "knock
out." It was one of the best imperson
ations that Bayley has ever done on
the campus, and his falsetto voice
seemed even better than usual. "Dick"
Malaby accompanied him at the con
sole, and was quite successful in keep
ing pace with the trills and expansions
of the temperamental prima donna's
voice.
Specialty Goes Big
Ted Van Deusen and Gardiner Lip
pincott, in an ingenious soft-shoe
dance conception, scored big. Repre
senting '08 and '99, they engaged in
a harmless underclass brawl; and slip
pery, entangling footwork prevented
each from suffering a horrible fate at
the hands of the other. The battle was
declared a draw, for both were par
excellent.
The bad acoustics of the pavilion
prevented the voices of the eight wo
men in the two chorus numbers from
carrying far, but the dancing was
good. The women who took part are:
Eugenia Bentley, Dorothy Dahler, Mar
garet Harroun, Elyse Braunchweiger,
Margaret Randall, Marjorie Anderson,
Janett Craig, and Muriel Saxon.
The stage for the entertainment at
one end of the hall was particularly
effective with its purple drops and
lighting effects.

"Historical Hikes" to discover his
toric spots, with the aid of an archeo
logist are a popular feature of the
University of Wisconsin's summer
session.

Two students at the University of
lowa recently broke the worlds
record for playing endurance, when
they played bridge for twenty-five
hours without interruption.
