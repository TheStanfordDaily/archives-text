### Bert Andrews 
fTHE Bear baseball jinx is dead!
* Two Stanford ball players aided in the murder. The obituary reads,
Nicholas caught off first in the ninth, for the third and last California out,
Oviatt to Woodward.
And thus to a sudden end, came the deciding game of the 1924 Stanford-
California diamond series, with the Cards on top, 7-6,
Bears' Rally Falls Short
Six runs behind in the eighth inning, the Bruins came tearing in from the
field resolved to get a flock of runs and win the game—like the heroes of
the storybook. How near they came to succeeding, was too much like the
story to please any of the Card followers.
Smith, first at bat, popped a foul fly to Woodward. Rossell got a free trip

to first. King knocked one straight at
Nevers in the box and both he and
Rossell were safe when Nevers threw
wild to second.
Zamloch, the Rear coach, sent in
Nounan to hit for Lenahan, but the
best Nounan could do was to pop a fly
to Cuddejback, on third. Nevers walked
Kyte, who was batting for Rossell, filling
the bases.
Solomon Takes Nevers' Place
At this point VVolter, the Card mentor,
substituted Solomon for Nevers. Solo
mon got two strikes on Tait, another
substitute bitter, and then walked him.
forcing in a run. Sears followed Kyte
and slammed a double into the right
field crowd, scoring King and Kyte and
sending Tait to third. The latter crossed
the plate when Johnston let one of
Solomon's curves go to the backstop.
The Bear captain, Duffy Gerlach,
duplicated Sears' feat and hit into the
crowd for two bases, sending the latter
home. Solomon walked Morse and then
hit Smith, loading the bases for the sec
ond time of the inning.
Teague Goes in for Solomon
Milt Teague relieved Solomon and
forced Rossell to fly to Fuller in left
field, ending the stanza, with the Bruins
still one run behind.
Starting where they had left off in the
height of 5 feet 10 inches. Upson bet
tered his previous best mark of 12 feet
1 inch in the pole vault with a height of
12 feet 3 inches and a first place.
Hut the biggest upset of the day de
veloped in the two-mile. Charles had
been considered an easy first with Hayes
a second, but the Blue and Gold entered
half a dozen men, three of whom were
capable of finishing one-two-three.
Charles led after the third lap until the
last quarter of the final lap when he was
passed by the three California men, who
had passed Hayes a quarter of a lap
earlier. Charles gave all he had, but
was forced to quit twenty-five yards
from the tape. He showed a lack of
condition, due to a two weeks' forced
rest when he was laid up with shin
splints.
Stanford Wins Mile
The mile run opened the meet. The
runners were called back for jumping
the gun, but got off to a good start on
the second trial. The runners were well
bunched to the final turn, where Kerr
stepped out ahead, and Elliott swung up
alongside of Smith. Ross placed fourth
to Kerr, Smith, and Elliott.
In the hundred, Earns worth took the
lead, but was passed by Campbell at the
50-yard mark. In a few strides Hale
also pased him and finished well ahead
of him. Barber was not irt the running,
and Caspar pushed Earnsworth hard for
third place. The time of 10 fiat equaled
the previous record held by Cadogan,
Abadie, and Sneigar of California, and
McKce and Kirksey of Stanford.
The 440 was a pretty race. Hurst led
to the turn, where Miller passed him.
I Storie also went ahead of him, and on
the straightaway Van Judah pulled up
into third place with yards to spare.
The time of 49 5-10 set a new Stanford-
California record, lowering the former
time of 50 fiat held by Wyniari of Stan
ford and Hendrizson of California.
Leistner led Becker in the high hur
dles all the way, although the Bruin star
pulled up to within a short distance of
"Swede" at the last hurdle. Boles took
an easy third.
"Tiny" Hartranft tried hard to set a
world's record in the shot after he won
the event at 49 feet B'/$ inches, but failed
in three attempts. His distance set a
new Stanford-California record, how
ever, bettering the old mark of 48 feet
6y 2 inches, set by "Here" Bihlman of
Stanford.
Anderson Wins High Jump
Anderson won the high jump at a
height of 6 feet, with Ludeke and
Witherspoon tied for second at 5 feet
10 inches. After cinching a first, Ander
son tried for a record, but was stopped
after he made 6 feet 2 1 /> inches, within
2 1 / i inches of the California-Stanford
record.
Dole stepped into the lead in the 880
and set the pace to the first turn, but
Richardson and Macintosh ran ahead on
the second lap and dashed neek-and-neck
50 yards to the tape, which Richardson
broke in the fast time of 1:55 5-10.
Swayne finished third by a great spurt
around the last turn, and Daly came in
fourth with a good lead on Chase, Cali
fornia's only hope.
Upson again outdid himself in the
pole vault, beating out Dennis for first
place with a height of 12 feet 3 inches.
His best previous mark was 12 feet 1
inch, made last week against Illinois.
Scofield took a third at 11 feet 9 inches.
Hale Takes First in 220 Dash
In the 220 Barber led to the half-way
mark, where Hale pulled ahead of him,
and Campbell raced neck-and-neck with
the Bruin ace to the tape, nosing him
out for second.
Leistner had an easy time in the 220
low hurdles, leading by yards all the
way. Becker and Boles ran second most
of the way, but Boles and Becker stum
bled and Morris and Corley of Califor
nia took the places.
Hartranft Breaks Discus Record
"Tiny" also broke the discus record,
set by Neufeldt last year, with a toss j
of 145 feet 11J4 inches. Neufeldt's best
toss Saturday was 135 feet 10 inches,
which gave him a second. Hartranft
tried for a record in this event also, but
had to be content with the two first and
two new Stanford-California records for
the day. However, lie later tried to
qualify in the javelin, but his best throw
of 145 feet was too short. Stanford was
shut out in this event, V. Dodson win
ning at 190 feet. G. Dodson pressed
Neufeldt close for second, but his throw
of 185 feet was a trifle short. Evers got
the spear out 177 feet 654 inches on one
nice toss.
Boren was expected to break the [

broad jump record after his jump of 24
feet Ujj a week ago. He came through,
but was only able to increase the dis
tance Hof an inch. He won the event
at 23 feet 2"4 inches, but in three addi
tional jumps made 23 feet 9 inches, send
ing the mark of Jackson of California
into the discard.
The relay was the final event on the
program and furnished one of the great
est thrills of the day, although the meet
had long since been won. Mixon ran a
strong race and finished only a yard be
hind Geertz; Coverly evened things up,
but Van Judah had a six-yard handicap
when the baton was fumbled in the ex
change. He made up three yards of the
loss, and Miller was content to trail
Hurst on the last lap by the same three
yards until the last turn. A pretty sprint
placed Miller well in the lead, and the
event ended with the Cardinal star quar
ter-miler safely ahead.
The rooters followed the victory with
a serpentine, and performed like vet
erans in the art before the small Cali
fornia rooting section.
