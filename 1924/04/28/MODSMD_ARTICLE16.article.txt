Students, alumni, and friends of Stanford are singing the praises of
"Dink" Templeton, Harry Wolter, and their athletes. And for good rea
son. Last Saturday, for the first time in many years, two Cardinal major
sport teams hung up glorious victories over their California rivals.
In winning their first Big Meet since 1919, the Stanford track men
showed great strength which may carry them as far as a national title.
The men who piled up such an overwhelming score on the Stadium track
deserve a great deal of credit, but too much cannot be said for "Dink"
Templeton, who was, in a large measure, responsible for the great showing.
For Templeton, it was the result of years of hard work. Some of the
men who were most instrumental in the Stanford victory were developed
entirely under his care. Very few of them came to him as high school
stars. As a Stanford man, "Dink" has proved a great credit to the uni
versity not only as an alitmnus, but also as a coach. His team triumphed
over a good aggregation Saturday. The California squad was not weak,
and it was coached by one of the most renowned track mentors in the
United States.
The superiority of Templeton's coaching system stood out in a very
pronounced manner. His men were not coached to beat the gun, but to
wait for it. They did. His men were not told to go out and "box" the
rival runners, but rather they had been developed to go out and WIN
without the aid of any questionable methods.
On top of the track victory, Harry Wolter's baseball nine came through
with a win over the California nine in the deciding game of the annual
series. Too much credit cannot be given Harry and his baseball men for
their showing. After a mediocre showing in preliminary games, the Card
nine lost the first game to California by a narrow margin after it had ap
parently been won. Undaunted, the Stanford team went back to Berkeley
the following week and won a decisive victory. Again Saturday ,by tak
ing a long chance after an early lead had been cut away, the Cards pulled
the third and deciding game out of the fire.
Harry Wolter drilled his team during the past week and saw the final
game Saturday, handicapped by a severe cold. His work this year has
proved that he is THE man to coach the Stanford baseball varsities of
the future.
Incidentally, Saturday's events proved to the satisfaction of every
Stanford supporter that the Cards will not have to worry about a coaching
staff for years to come. With Warner, Kerr, and Thornhill in charge of
football, Kerr and Thornhill directing basketball, Wolter taking care of
baseball, and Templeton in charge of track, all regular members of the
Physical Education Department, Stanford has a staff of coaches of which
any university in the United States might well be proud. Minor sports are
well taken care of by men such as Maloney, Brandsten, and Davis.
There is no one thing which can make a university feel more secure in
athletics than a coaching staff such as we have at Stanford. It would
indeed be a shame if this group of men were not kept at Stanford to direct
her teams for several vears to come.

The Daily Palo Alto believes that but one event marred the most en
joyable track meet seen here in many years. That event was the two mile.
Allan Charles, the Stanford favorite, is capable of better time than that in
which the race was won. Because of weak ankles, he was unable to keep
in condition and he was cut out of a place.
The Daily Palo Alto congratulates Charles on the nervy race he ran in
spite of his handicap and wishes him better luck next year.
