# Why work overtime?
## 
### 
The student who works overtime is
often the one who, for some reason, is
not truly efficient. The almost imper
ceptible slowing-down of his thinking
necessitates spending more time and
labor on his work.
It is a surprising fact that much of
this inefficiency is due to a slight neg
lect in eating. Many people do not
realize that all the healthful, nutritive
and laxative properties of whole wheat
bran can be secured in a really tempting
breakfast dish.
Post's Bran Flakes, while retaining
all the natural properties of bran, have
a rich, appetizing flavor that is deli
ciously different. Crisp, crunchy, and
nut-brown, Post's Bran Flakes appeal
to the fnost critical.
To satisfy your taste and your reason,
try Post's Bran Flakes for tomorrow's
breakfast. You will be treating your
self to a pleasant surprise, and storing
up hours, not for "overtime," but for
recreation.
