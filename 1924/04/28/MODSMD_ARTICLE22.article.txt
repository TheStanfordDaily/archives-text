# G. A. R. (Grace and Rhythm) in Sports
## 
### Feg Murray, '16 
Study these pictures. Notice the
smooth, easy, graceful swing that
Glenna Collett takes for a wooden
shot. Rhythm is the most essential
quality of a good golf swing, and the
former woman's champion has it to
the nth degree. Of the men golfers,
Bobby Jones is noted for having the
most rhythmic swing.
Dempsey, known as one of the most
graceful of all heavyweight cham
pions, is shown ready to shoot in his
powerful right. He is, in a way, posed
like the fair golfer, for both are at the
top of their swing—it is a case of
"just before the wallop" in both golf
and boxing, and it could be just as
well illustrated by a football player
about to shoot a forward pass, and a
batter about to put everything into

bis forward swing at the horsehide.
Joie Ray is about the smoothest,
easiest runner of the cinder-path today.
If Joie didn't have rhythm and grace,
and the ability to propel his arms and
legs without the least bit of wasted

action, he wouldn't be the champion
that he is, year after year.
A graceful swan dive is about the
prettiest thing there is to watch in all
outdoor sports. Duke Kahanamoku,
here shown volplaning through the air

like a bird, has that graceful rhythmic
something in his powerful crawl
stroke, as well as in his diving, which
enables him to continue breaking
swimming records even though he is
well over thirty years old.
