# Catalogue of Russian Newspapers Completed
## 
### 
A classification and catalogue of the
! newspapers, which form a large part of
the collection of Russian documents and
I literature recently given to the Hoover
War Library, has just been completed.
This collection is said to be equaled
only by that of the Romanzoff Museum
jin Russia. The classification shows four
complete files for the Russian period of
1914-1917, seventeen for that of the
Kcrensky regime, fifty for the Bolshevik
era, and over two hundred for the
period following this era.
The papers sliow all types of political
thought, and represent every part of
Russia. They are of all colors, and
many peculiar names may be found
among them, such as Day, Night, Jupi
ter, Venus, Poverty, Liberty, Star,
\ olga, Red Rover, Red Sailor, and Red
I Peasant.
Many of the papers were very short
lived, and some were forced, because of
political and economic reasons, to change
j their titles or colors numerous times.

William and Mary Colleges plans
to conduct an extension school in
Paris this summer.
