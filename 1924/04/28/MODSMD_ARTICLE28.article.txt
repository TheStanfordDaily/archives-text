"The best alumni reunion yet," was
the universal idea expressed at the
alumni banquet, held in the pavilion Sat
urday night. The idea next frequently

excellence of the student entertainment

sity Day committee, acted as toastmaster,
introducing Dr. Jordan and President
Wilbur, who gave short talks.
Students Entertain Well
Following these, the student enter
tainment, under the charge of Daniel
Evans, '21, and Hollis Chalmer, '23, was
presented. Arnold Bayley scored ap
plause first, as Madame Blitzen, a prima
donna, assisted by Dick Malaby at the
piano, and later assisted by Dave Lam
son in a variation of the famous Radio
stunt.
Lippincott and Van Deusen revived
old memories with a dance, depicting the
old "plug-ugly" fight. The Glee Club
sang two of Charles Field's songs, and
Shirley Baker, '95, sang Field's "Ideal
Co-ed." Then Field himself recited two
of his poems.
The pony chorus introduced the pro
