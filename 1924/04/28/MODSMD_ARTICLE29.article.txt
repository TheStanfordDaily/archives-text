# STANFORD STUDENT RATES THIRD IN BIRD BANDING COMPETITION
## 
### 
E. H. Quayle, Stanford, '25, took third
place in bird banding for the Cooper
Ornithological Club. He banded 206
birds.
The campaign for the banding of birds
was started in the United States about
1914 under the direction of the Ameri
can Bird Band Association, working in
co-operation with the United States Bio
logical Survey. The object of banding
at first was to discover routes of migra
tion, breeding and winter range of ducks
and game birds. It has proved to l>e a
means of getting accurate scientific data
concerning life habits.
Attempts are now being made to band
birds of every description. Index cards
are filled out for each bird, banded, and
sent to the United States Biological Sur
vey at Washington, D. C, where they
are kept on file.
Eugene Law of Altadena, Stanford
19tX), is in charge of the Pacific Coast
Division of the American Bird Banding
Association. Quayle lias l>ecn working
under him.
During the nesting season traps are
not set for fear of keeping birds away
from the nests. The only way to band
now is to watch for the very young birds.
Consequently, the Zoology department
will be glad to hear of birds' nests.
Those who discover nests are asked to
telephone Dr. Snyder.
