# SPRING FOOTBALL SHOWS PROMISING MATERIAL-WARNER
## 'Red' Roberts, All-American, Helps With Linesmen During Visit Here 
### 
"The spring football season, which
will end Friday of this week, has re
vealed a lot of new and promising
material. After four weeks of prac
tice I am satisfied with the results
attained so far, and pleased with the
interest and enthusiasm displayed by
the men. I believe that I have found
three or four new men, outside of this
last year's freshman team, who will
give the regulars hard competition for
their berths next year."
Cardinal Hopes Are High
The above statement by "Pop" War
ner, head football coach, should add
further encouragement to the hopes
of the Cardinals, who are anxious to
walk off with the coast championship
next fall. With the bulk of last year's
varsity men back in the autumn, with
a strong freshman squad to pick from,
and with new material discovered in
spring practice to help out and make
the varsity hustle to keep their jobs,
it is no wonder that Cardinal football
hopes were never higher.
"Red" Roberts on Campus
"Red" Roberts, famous All-Ameri
can, Centre College end, has been out
on the field recently in uniform, help
ing "Tiny" Thornhill with the lines
men, while he is stopping over on a
visit.
The daily practice sessions will
come to an end this Friday, the cus
tomary period of five weeks' training
having then been completed. An aver
age of ninety men have been out work
ing under the sun and on a hard turf
every day for the past month, and the
fact that few have dropped out has
proved, as Coach Warner says, that
the men are really out there to help
produce a winning team for next fall.
This number does not include most of
last season's varsity, who have been
busy with other sports.
Teams Not Selected
"No attempt has been made yet to
pick a first pr a second team," says
Coach Warner. "My main attempt so
far has been to get a line on the men
and to discover what new material I
can. One of our teams has been made
up mainly of men from last year's
varsity squad, and another almost en
tirely of men from this year's iresh
man team, but other than those, all
the rest of the elevens are somewhat
on a level."
One of the sensations of the past
few days of practice has been the
playing of Roy Dennis, an end, brother
of Guy Dennis of the varsity squad.
He entered this quarter and will be
eligible for the freshman team in the
fall quarter. Dennis weighs close to
two hundred pounds, is fast on his
feet, and is into every play. On the
receiving end of passes he gets every
thing that comes his way and is a
hard man to stop with the ball. He
has been all-Southern end for two
years in the C. I. F.
Three Good Halfbacks
Garthwaite, Tirth, and Trombetto,
from the freshman team, are three
halfbacks who loom up as likely pros
pects for the varsity next year as a
result of their playing in spring prac
tice. Bogue, fullback, has also shown
up well. Rafetto, tackle, is the out
standing candidate for the line from
the freshman team.
It will be a difficult task for "Pop"
Warner, "Andy" Kerr, and "Tiny"
Thornhill to pick their first team next
fall.
"No one will have a place on the
team cinched. There are too many
good men out for each position, and
even some of the stars on this year's
varsity are liable to be on the bench
at times," says "Pop."
