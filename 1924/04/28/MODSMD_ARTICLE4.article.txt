In answer to the challenge to a base-
I ball game issued by the Mechanical En-
I gincers, the Civil Engineer majors have
I sent the following reply :
"Be it known that we, the members
of the Civil Engineering department of-
Stanford University, after reading the
long-winded, extraneous, and pettifog
ging challenge of the lop-cared members
of the oil crew known as Mechanical
Engineers, do not wish to go into detail,
but beg to state that their noisy bellow
ing is empty of force, being full of sound
i and fury, signifying nothing, i. e. "vox
t>ctcrc ct nihilx," which freely translated
means "all hot air."
"To illustrate our point and in order
to further demonstrate the superiority
of those engaged in Civil Engineering
over the wast-slingers, we, the Civil En
gineers, accept the challenge to cross bats
in the national pastime.
