# Sorority House is Proud Winner of Granite Tombstone
## 
### 
The writing on the tombstone is to
be carved, oh, verydeep. And it is a
lovely gray stone, high-grade granite,
with artistic decorations of weeping wil
lows, if you want to call them that.
Bright and early yesterday morning
one of the sisters up the Row tripped
fgorth to church to give devout thanks
for the great track victory. She tripped,
with a frightened scream, over a large
gray object, which had been carefully
placed on the doorstep.
After a great deal of trouble, of
sweating and swearing (of course with
the help of many of the nextdoor
brothers who had been summoned by the
scream), the tombstone was carried to a
place of safety within the house. Here
it remained enthroned in state all day
long viewed by admiring multitudes.
After Miss Sherlock Holmes got on
the joh, it was discovered that the cheer
ful little present was the result of a
solmen promise given by a Stanford
man and therefore unbroken. If Stan
ford won the meet he was to bring a
tombstone to his lady as a token of
thanksgiving.
