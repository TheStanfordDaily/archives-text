## 
### 
Charles F. Johnston, jack-of-all
baseball positions, was elected cap
tain of the Stanford 1925 baseball
team by his team-mates, following
the 7 to 6 victory over the Califor
nia nine last Saturday.
Coach Wolter has found Johnston
to be the most valuable man on
the team this season. Johnston
started the year in left field, where
he played a noticeably flawless
game. He has been switched to first
base, and finally, in the California
series, Wolter played him as
catcher. It would be safe to state
that his playing in this position was
one reason why Stanford was able
to annex the baseball championship
after many years of defeat.
Aside from his contributions in
the outfield, infield, and behind the
plate, Johnston has been a consist
ent hitter. Fans will remember how
he broke up the first Ireland game
with his home run in the ninth in
ning with two men on base, two
strikes against him, and Stanford
needing three runs to win.
And now that the baseball season
is ended, Coach "Pop" Warner will
be looking for "Chuck" to appear in
his football suit to take place in
spring practice. Johnston plays
tackle on the gridiron team.
