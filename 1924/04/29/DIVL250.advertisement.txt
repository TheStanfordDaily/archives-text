Just when you're hurrying the most
— zip! and away goes that shaving
cream cap. The new cap on Williams
ends the nuisance forever. It's hinged V ■
on and can't get lost.
In shaving, too, Williams has just as noticeable im
provements: Williams lather is heavier and more closely
woven. It holds the water in against the beard. Result:
quicker softening. Williams lather lubricates —no irri
tating friction. Last, Williams is decidedly helpful to the
skin. It keeps your face comfortable no matter how
heavy your beard and how tender your skin. There's
no coloring matter in Williams—it is a natural white,
absolutely pure. Say "WilliamsHinge-Cap"toyour dealer.
