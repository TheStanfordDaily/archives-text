# STUART TO TALK ON NEW UNITED STATES POLICY
## Stanford Professor Favors Permanent Court for World Justice 
### 
Professor Graham H. Stuart of the
Political Science department will talk
on "A New Foreign Policy for the
United States" at 7:30 tonight in the
Assembly hall.
In discusing the isolation policy of
the United States, which has been so
strenuously followed since the first
days of the nation, Professor Stuart
speaks in favor of the Permanent
Court of International Justice which
would change the old attitude.
Educate Americans
As the only excuse for America's
continued isolation in such confer
ences at this time, he offers the fact
that through ignorance of world poli
tics and diplomacy this country may
be imposed upon and drawn into diffi
culties.
He believes, however, that it is in
excusable for the people to remain
untaught in these problems, and advo
cates learning by a greater interest
in world affairs.
Discussion Beneficial
As an example of the good results
obtained by these interests, Stuart
said, "The Washington Conference on
armament proved that a frank open
discussion of a difficult problem was
beneficial in every respect."
As author of several books dealing
with international relations, Professor
Stuart, who is about to make a study
of Peruvian governmental functions
for a report and book to be published
by the Carnegie Institute of Washing
ton. is an expert on the situation.
Comes from Wisconsin
Professor Stuart, before he came
here this year, served as professor at
the University of Wisconsin for six
years, where he received his degrees
of M.A. and Ph.D.
