# MEMORIAL CHURCH CHIMES FIRST INSTALLED IN 1903
## 
### Margaret R. Miller 
rTHE Westminster chimes, installed in the tower of the Memorial Church as
it was originally constructed in 1903, were purchased from the McNeely
Bell Company of New York City. As a result of the earthquake in 1906 the
tower and chimes fell. When the church was rebuilt, the chimes were placed
in the structure where they now stand.
There is a tale about the chimes, which, if not true, is at any rate interest
ing. One time, not so very long ago. some mischief-loving fellows played

a trick on the campus folk. After care-'
fully testing the tones of the different
bells, the conspirators stole to the
chimes in the dim and dusky silence of
the early morning hours, and soon
the melody which has all but. become a
classic since prohibition, "How Dry I
Am," floated out on the still air.
Aroused by the unusual behavior of
the chimes, the night watchman has
tened to the scene of the commotion.
The students, being prepared for an
attack, fled, leaving the song unfin
ished on an extremely pathetic note.
Those whose slumbers were disturbed
sat up in bed and pinched themselves
to make sure they were not dreaming
and then attempted to go back to
sleep with the unpleasant feeling of
having experienced a nightmare.-
Punishment of a rather severe na

ture was promised tne perpetrators of
this criminal offense if their identity
was ever disclosed. The guilty men,
however, slipped by and may be to
this day chuckling to themselves over
this college prank.
Chimes May Be Restored to Church
Such tales as this and more are told
of the Stanford chimes. It is because
of their romantic history as well as
their practical interest that they seem
such a part of Stanford.
It is possible that after the com
pletion of the present building plans,
the chimes may be replaced to
their original tower on the Memorial
Church. According to the President's
office, however, nothing definite has
been planned.
