# Marshal Hale Chosen To Lead Stanford Track Team for 1925 Season
## 
### 
Marshal Hale, Jr., '24, was elected
captain of the 1925 track team by the
members of the track squad yesterday
afternoon.
The other candidates were "Tiny"
Hartranft, "Swede" Leistner, lan
Campbell, and Dick Mac√üae.
Hale has been one of the outstand
ing athletes on the team this year. He
won the 100-yard dash in every meet
until the Big Meet, when he placed
second, but as a compensation, he
won the 20-yard dash. In the Southern
Conference meet he covered the cen
tury in 0:09 9-10, and by so doing beat
Cliff Argue, who is one of the fastest
men on the coast.
Because he can run the century in
less than :10 flat the newly-elected
captain will endanger the laurels of
several of the leading eastern runners
when he goes East to compete in the
I. C. A. A. A. A.
This is Hale's first year of varsity
competition. Before this he has been
bothered with pulled tendons, and as
a result has not been able to be very
active on the track. This trouble now
seems to have cleared up.
Hale is a member of Sigma Nu.
