# DAPHNE HODGSON WILL BE HERO IN WOMEN'S PAGEANT
## Dances and Pantomine Will Give Story Located on Island of Delos 
### Esther Greenacre 
Daphne Hodgson, as Apollo, will
play the hero role in the "Legend of
j the Laurel," the women's pageant to
be given next Saturday afternoon at
I 5 o'clock on the banks of Lagunita.
i This part calls for only one dance,
a love-making fantasy with Daphne,
the heroine; but it offers wide op
portunities for dramatic interpreta
tion. Apollo's entrance on the stage
| soon after the population of the Gre
j cian island of Delos has assembled for
a festival, is celebrated by various
i dances. In musical contest which soon
j takes place, the sprightly Pan, who
i plays the pipes, is proclaimed defeat
ed by Apollo, who performs on the
lyre. The sun god is crowned victor by
; Tmolus, god of the mountains, who
: presides at the festival.
Dancers Featured
The second half of the story shows
1 the various groups of dancers perform
ing before Apollo and celebrating his
victory. The gay festivities are sha
j dowed by the appearance of the old
| soothsayer, who brings an ill omen in
, the shape of an arrow. Cupid, the
owner of the arrow, springs in with
. his archers, challenges Apollo to a
; shooting contest, and when the sun
! god laughingly refuses to participate,
I vows revenge.
Soon, Wilma Randall, as the lovely
Daphne, a dew sprite, appears. Apollo
,is attracted by her gracefulness;
, whereupon Cupid hits the god with
his tiny arrow and Apollo becomes
! enamoured of Daphne. Apollo pur
i sues Daphne who eludes him in one
iof the main dances of the pageant.
Upon an appeal by the dew sprite to
the gods, a group of laurel maidens
: runs in and, surrounding Daphne, pre
j vents Apollo from reaching her. Apollo
i is grief-stricken. An ode of consola
tion sung by the priestesses concludes
the pageant.
Velma Randall as Daphne
As Daphne, Velma Randall distin
guishes herself by her graceful danc
ing. The dignity of Apollo and the
lightness of Daphne are in pleasing
contrast.
Anna McAnear takes the role of the
dignified Tmolus. Surrounded by her
attendants she makes an imposing
master of ceremonies at the festival.
Violet Knowles, as leader of the sun
maidens, has one of the prnicipal solo
dances in the pageant. The dance of
her group is one of the best in the
Fiesta.
Another solo dance is given by
Marcia Morton, who plays the role of
Artemis, the moon goddess and the
sister of Apollo. Gertrude Bvler is the
ancient and weird soothsayer who in
troduces the tragic note into the story.
Carolan Strouse and Marjorie Allen
take the parts of the frolicsome Pan
and daring Cupid.
