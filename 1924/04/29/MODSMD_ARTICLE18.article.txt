# The 						Class of '99

### 
The class of '99 is a shining example of just what an active alumni
group can and should be. Seemingly, the members of that famous class
have the same enthusiasm that characterizes the average undergraduate
body.
At '99's twenty-fifth anniversary reunion Saturday, the class pledged
$50,000 to the University. The simple fact that this sum of money was
subscribed and will be raised in the next ten years, means a great deal, but
the most significant thing about the donation is that the class designated
that the money should be used for any purposes the University sees fit.
While all gifts of money to the University are welcome, the majority
of them are made, with stipulations as to the use to which the money is to
be put. To some extent, this limits the usefulness of the donation.
The class of '99, in making their gift, recognized this fact and acted
accordingly. If every class which leaves the University would remain in
as close touch with conditions here as the '99ers do, it is quite probable that
the alumni body as a whole would I>e even more effective than it is now.
