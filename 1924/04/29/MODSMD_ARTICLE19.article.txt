# A 						Forward Step

Nearly 200 high school editors and managers will be on the campus this
week-end for a statewide convention. This conclave will he the first of its
kind ever held in the state of California.
At first glance, it may be difficult to see the significance of such a move.
However, the results should be far-reaching. These high school journalists
will have the fact impressed upon them while they are here that their in
tersts are alike and that they should work together.
The program, as it has been announced is different from the average
one presented at such a conclave. The delegates will not spend their time
wandering about, listening from time to time to high-sounding theories
which cannot benefit them. They will engage in discussions and listen to
speakers who can tell them things of practical value.
The high school journalists of today are the college and professional
journalists of tomorrow. They should be carefully trained for their fu
ture work. A move, such as the. one now on foot to bring them together
and impress on them the importance of their job, cannot help being of
benefit to the delegates themselves as well as the great University which is
sponsoring the movement.
