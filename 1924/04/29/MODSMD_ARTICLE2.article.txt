# OVERFELT ELECTED TO CAPTAIN 1925 RACQUET WIELDERS
## Young Stanford Player Has Come Into Limelight During Past Year 
### 
Harold Overfelt was elected varsity
tennis captain for next year, yester
day afternoon.
Overfelt is a man who has worked
his way to the top by sheer hard work
and the determination'to make good.
He was considered a good high school
player before he came to college, but
failed to make his numerals or a place
on the squad during his second year.
Has Improved Steadily
During the last season he has im
proved in little short of phenomenal
fashion. He practiced continually, and
was able to develop his game suffi
ciently to become the first man on
the squad, defeating such veterans as
Dick Hinckley, captain of the team
in 1922, Ted Mertz, captain during
the past season.
This lack of experience will largely
be made up during the long Aus
tralian trip this summer. So far the
titles to his credit are restricted to
Santa Clara and San Jose champion
ships.
Has Bright Future
With continuous practice between
now and June and more than a dozen
intercollegiate matches in Australia
during the summer, he should become
an outstanding player in Pacific Coast
tennis before the next regular season.
The prospects for next year's team
ore bright in spite of the loss of such
men as Mertz, Hinckley, and Tussing.
Besides Overfelt there will be "Nim"
deßack, winner in the doubles for two
years against California, and Cran
ston Holman, captain of this year's
freshman team, who gives promise of
becoming a star.
There are also plenty of other men
who were on the squad during the
past year and who will probably im
prove greatly before next year, such
as Fairchild, Ogden, McCleave, and
several others.
