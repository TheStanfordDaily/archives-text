# PRINCETONIAN COMPARES FRESHMAN RULINGS OF DISCIPLINE IN UNITED STATES COLLEGES
## 
### 
At a time when the question of fresh
man customs is raising so much discus
sion and comment here, it is interesting
to compare them in their application
and severity with those which hold
sway in other colleges. In spite of the
criticism of freshman restrictions and
"hazing" that has led to their partial
abolishment at Princeton, a comparison
shows them to be in general less strict
than those of other similar institutions.
With the exception of Harvard, which
has no pronounced regulation of fresh
man customs, the entering man of the
average college inevitably meets with
restrictions and customs as old as the
college itself. A few of these are listed
in this article.
Stanford Strictest
Leland Stanford University maintains
perhaps the most severe of customs.
Early in the year a fight takes place
between the sophomores and entering
men, which begins at 4 in the after
noon and continues as long as contest
ants are left, until 4, or after, the next
morning. For a freshman to talk to a
co-ed is an unpardonable offense, while
the "Law steps," a meeting place for
seniors, are forbidden to freshmen.
The yearlings wear green caps with
red buttons, and can smoke only corn
cob pipes about the campus.
At Michigan, a freshman's one am
bition is to carve his initials on the
tables in "Joe's Restaurant" which he
is not allowed to do until sophomore
year.
Yale Frosh Restricted.
At Yale freshmen are required to
carry matches at all times, for the im
mediate use of upperclassmen. They
cannot sit in the orchestra of the Schu
bert theater, eat in Morey's restaurant,
or enter the Hotel Garde. All first
year men are forbidden to sit on the
sophomore fence, except on the day of
the Harvard freshman baseball game
when Yale wins; and they are excluded
from the Junior Prom. Only seniors
are allowed to go without a hat or to
play marbles.
Amherst Forbids Smoking.
Amherst yearlings are forbidden to
smoke on the campus, or to wear prep
school letters; and are required to give
up their seats to upperclassmen on the
trolleys between Northampton and the
college. Green caps with black but
tons, known as "pea greens," must be
worn.
Columbia Has Uniform Dress.
Columbia freshmen wear black caps
with white buttons, cuffless trousers,
black ties and socks, and arc expected
always to carry a copy of the fresh
man rules in sight. At an annual song
fest, freshmen are required to sing for
the benefit of any requesting sopho
more, and those who refuse have their
faces painted with iodine.
According to the "Ten Command
ments," or freshman rules, at N. Y. U.
entering men are restricted to cuffless
trousers, black socks and ties, and can
not smoke on the campus. On Hal
lowe'en they are herded on the pedes
tal of the "Fountain of Youth" and
forced to render the college cheers, vio
lation of this to be penalized by duck
ing.
Raccoon coats and college colors are
forbidden to the Williams yearlings.
Black caps with green buttons alter

nate annually with black toques deco
rated with class'colors. Leather coats
and corduroy trousers are tahoo and
only blue ties may be worn. Fresh
men cannot smoke on the campus or in
a senior's room, and must give up their
seats to upperclassmen in the trolleys.
At the beginning of freshman year
at the University of Vermont a class
fight and "tie-up" takes place. The en
tering men are required to paste up
posters of freshman rules; and they
must salute professors, wear green caps
and always carry Bull Durham tobacco.
Rutger Frosh Wear Signs.
At Rutgers freshmen wear black
caps with green buttons and green ties,
cannot smoke on the street or campus,
and for the first few weeks wear large
placards hanging from their shoulders
with name and address prominently
inscribed. They are obliged to run
errands for upperclassmen upon re
quest.
Lafayette freshmen are restricted to
a similar costume, can smoke only corn
cob pipes on the campus, and must
carry matches. When an upperclass
rnan cries "hit it up," neighboring year
lings must run with their caps in their
mouths and hands overhead.
Cornell freshmen cannot walk on the
grass or sit in the first three rows of
the orchestra of any town theater. The
regulation head-dress is a gray cap
with black button, and those wearing
arctics must have them always but
toned. In fraternity houses freshmen
have the task of keeping house and
grounds in general order and running
errands for upperclassmen.
DAILY PRINCETONIAN.

The radio was brought into use to
allow Herbert Hoover and Will Irwin
to talk to the 1922 Alumni banquet.

caps with green buttons and green ties,
cannot smoke on the street or campus,
and for the first few weeks wear large
placards hanging from their shoulders
with name and address prominently
inscribed. They are obliged to run
errands for upperclassmen upon re
quest.
Lafayette freshmen are restricted to
a similar costume, can smoke only corn
cob pipes on the campus, and must
carry matches. When an upperclass
rnan cries "hit it up," neighboring year
lings must run with their caps in their
mouths and hands overhead.
Cornell freshmen cannot walk on the
grass or sit in the first three rows of
the orchestra of any town theater. The
regulation head-dress is a gray cap
with black button, and those wearing
arctics must have them always but
toned. In fraternity houses freshmen
have the task of keeping house and
grounds in general order and running
errands for upperclassmen.

The radio was brought into use to
allow Herbert Hoover and Will Irwin
to talk to the 1922 Alumni banquet.
At a time when the question of fresh
man customs is raising so much discus
sion and comment here, it is interesting
to compare them in their application
and severity with those which hold
sway in other colleges. In spite of the
criticism of freshman restrictions and
"hazing" that has led to their partial
abolishment at Princeton, a comparison
shows them to be in general less strict
than those of other similar institutions.
With the exception of Harvard, which
has no pronounced regulation of fresh
man customs, the entering man of the
average college inevitably meets with
restrictions and customs as old as the
college itself. A few of these are listed
in this article.
Stanford Strictest
Leland Stanford University maintains
perhaps the most severe of customs.
Early in the year a fight takes place
between the sophomores and entering
men, which begins at 4 in the after
noon and continues as long as contest
ants are left, until 4, or after, the next
morning. For a freshman to talk to a
co-ed is an unpardonable offense, while
the "Law steps," a meeting place for
seniors, are forbidden to freshmen.
The yearlings wear green caps with
red buttons, and can smoke only corn
cob pipes about the campus.
At Michigan, a freshman's one am
bition is to carve his initials on the
tables in "Joe's Restaurant" which he
is not allowed to do until sophomore
year.
Yale Frosh Restricted.
At Yale freshmen are required to
carry matches at all times, for the im
mediate use of upperclassmen. They
cannot sit in the orchestra of the Schu
bert theater, eat in Morey's restaurant,
or enter the Hotel Garde. All first
year men are forbidden to sit on the
sophomore fence, except on the day of
the Harvard freshman baseball game
when Yale wins; and they are excluded
from the Junior Prom. Only seniors
are allowed to go without a hat or to
play marbles.
Amherst Forbids Smoking.
Amherst yearlings are forbidden to
smoke on the campus, or to wear prep
school letters; and are required to give
up their seats to upperclassmen on the
trolleys between Northampton and the
college. Green caps with black but
tons, known as "pea greens," must be
worn.
Columbia Has Uniform Dress.
Columbia freshmen wear black caps
with white buttons, cuffless trousers,
black ties and socks, and arc expected
always to carry a copy of the fresh
man rules in sight. At an annual song
fest, freshmen are required to sing for
the benefit of any requesting sopho
more, and those who refuse have their
faces painted with iodine.
According to the "Ten Command
ments," or freshman rules, at N. Y. U.
entering men are restricted to cuffless
trousers, black socks and ties, and can
not smoke on the campus. On Hal
lowe'en they are herded on the pedes
tal of the "Fountain of Youth" and
forced to render the college cheers, vio
lation of this to be penalized by duck
ing.
Raccoon coats and college colors are
forbidden to the Williams yearlings.
Black caps with green buttons alter

nate annually with black toques deco
rated with class'colors. Leather coats
and corduroy trousers are tahoo and
only blue ties may be worn. Fresh
men cannot smoke on the campus or in
a senior's room, and must give up their
seats to upperclassmen in the trolleys.
At the beginning of freshman year
at the University of Vermont a class
fight and "tie-up" takes place. The en
tering men are required to paste up
posters of freshman rules; and they
must salute professors, wear green caps
and always carry Bull Durham tobacco.

At a time when the question of fresh
man customs is raising so much discus
sion and comment here, it is interesting
to compare them in their application
and severity with those which hold
sway in other colleges. In spite of the
criticism of freshman restrictions and
"hazing" that has led to their partial
abolishment at Princeton, a comparison
shows them to be in general less strict
than those of other similar institutions.
With the exception of Harvard, which
has no pronounced regulation of fresh
man customs, the entering man of the
average college inevitably meets with
restrictions and customs as old as the
college itself. A few of these are listed
in this article.
Stanford Strictest
Leland Stanford University maintains
perhaps the most severe of customs.
Early in the year a fight takes place
between the sophomores and entering
men, which begins at 4 in the after
noon and continues as long as contest
ants are left, until 4, or after, the next
morning. For a freshman to talk to a
co-ed is an unpardonable offense, while
the "Law steps," a meeting place for
seniors, are forbidden to freshmen.
The yearlings wear green caps with
red buttons, and can smoke only corn
cob pipes about the campus.
At Michigan, a freshman's one am
bition is to carve his initials on the
tables in "Joe's Restaurant" which he
is not allowed to do until sophomore
year.
Yale Frosh Restricted.
At Yale freshmen are required to
carry matches at all times, for the im
mediate use of upperclassmen. They
cannot sit in the orchestra of the Schu
bert theater, eat in Morey's restaurant,
or enter the Hotel Garde. All first
year men are forbidden to sit on the
sophomore fence, except on the day of
the Harvard freshman baseball game
when Yale wins; and they are excluded
from the Junior Prom. Only seniors
are allowed to go without a hat or to
play marbles.
Amherst Forbids Smoking.
Amherst yearlings are forbidden to
smoke on the campus, or to wear prep
school letters; and are required to give
up their seats to upperclassmen on the
trolleys between Northampton and the
college. Green caps with black but
tons, known as "pea greens," must be
worn.
Columbia Has Uniform Dress.
Columbia freshmen wear black caps
with white buttons, cuffless trousers,
black ties and socks, and arc expected
always to carry a copy of the fresh
man rules in sight. At an annual song
fest, freshmen are required to sing for
the benefit of any requesting sopho
more, and those who refuse have their
faces painted with iodine.
According to the "Ten Command
ments," or freshman rules, at N. Y. U.
entering men are restricted to cuffless
trousers, black socks and ties, and can
not smoke on the campus. On Hal
lowe'en they are herded on the pedes
tal of the "Fountain of Youth" and
forced to render the college cheers, vio
lation of this to be penalized by duck
ing.
