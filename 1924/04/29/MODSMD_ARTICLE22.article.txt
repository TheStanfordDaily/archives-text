# Four Bob O'Links
## 
### Feg Murray, '16 
Here are the four famous Bobs of Golf, Jores. Gardner, Mac Donald and
Cruickshank. The two professionals came from Scotland, the two amateurs
are native-born Americans.
Bobby Jones, of Atlanta, the present holder of the National Open title, has
led the field through the last four Open championships by the big margin of
14 strokes. He qualified and won his first two matches in his first Open
at the age of 14. According to the concensus of view, a better golfer than
Jones is yet to be born.
Bob Gardner of Onwentsia, Chicago, won the National amateurs twice, and

has been a captain and member of the Walker Cup teams on various occasions.
Likely he will be with the Walker Cup team again this year. He is also
Vice-President of the U. S. G. A.
Bom Mac Donald of Bob O'Link, Chicago, has won the Metropolitan Open
twice and was third in the National Open at Baltusrol in 1915. He is one of
the longest hitters of all time, despite the fact that he uses very light clubs.
Bobby Cruickshank, of Schackamaxon, Westfield, N. J., was runner-up to
Bobby Jones last year in the Open. Despite his diminutive size, Cruikshank
is one of the best in the game.
