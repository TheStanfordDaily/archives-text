# GROWING INTEREST SHOWN IN GOLF AS COLLEGIATE SPORT
## Stanford Needs Convenient Course for Official Recognition 
### Ted Achilles 
Although golf was one of the least
successful minor sports at Stanford
during the past year, considerable in
terest has developed and there are
indications of a better year in 1924-25.
California won the big match last
fall, taking all except one round, won
by Clark, and one default. The Berke
leyans had an unusually strong team,
including Stanton Haight, now the
Northern California Open Champion.
Burlingame Country Club also defeat
ed the team, winning all rounds ex
cept that of Byerly and Lang, which
was even up.
The only victory of the year was
the freshman match with California,
which the babes took by a score of
10-6. Byerly and Klauber won their
rounds, Lang halved his, and McLean
lost in the morning play. McLean and
Byerly won and Lang and Klauber
lost in the afternoon.
The interest in the sport was shown
when six men, Hirschman, Byerly,
Lang, McLean, Klauber, and Condit
went to Del Monte for the California
Intercollegiate Championship at their
own expense as independent players.
None of them won, but they contribu
ted to the success of the event, which
will probably become an annual affair.
These men and several others have
been working hard to have golf made
a first class minor sport, as it is now
rated at California and the majority
of colleges on this coast. It is a very
popular sport in the East, many col
leges considering it a first class minor
and a few a major sport.
Stanford has a convenient golf
course just back of Lagunita which
could be fixed up at very little expense
and made into a really good course.
The number of men who are out prac
ticing up and down the Row and on
the polo field is a good indication of
how many men would turn out if there
were a links within reasonable dis
tance.
