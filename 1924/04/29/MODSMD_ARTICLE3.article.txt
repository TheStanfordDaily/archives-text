## 
### 
"Tomatah cans means twenty dol
lahs, sparigrass cans means ten dol
lahs, and Ah's got a bunch of cherry
cans which means one dollah and two
dollahs."
Guess again! Wrong! The price of
canned goods has not jumped to the
skies, it is merely "Pop" Harris' way of
segregating his wealth. "Pop," who is
the genial old gentleman of color pre
siding over the campus shbe-beautify
ing establishment, came forth with this
novel and distinctive method of bank
ing when he opened the second real
bank account of his seventy-odd years
this week with the Bank of Palo Alto.
For the past decade "Pop" has been
burying his surplus cash and accrued
profits in the back yard of his home in
Palo Alto. Persistent queries failed to
elicit from him the exact location of
said domicile, because, in his own
words, "How kin Ah tell when Ah may
want to bury some more, and den you
all would know where it was?"
The only trouble with this method of
banking, according to "Pop." is that
you are likely to forget just where you
buried what. He says that many a
time he has dug up twb or three hun
dred dollars before finding a one dollar
can. when, he wanted to pay a grocery
bill.
