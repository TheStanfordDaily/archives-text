# "DINK" TEMPLETON MAY ENTER TEAM IN I. C. 4 A.
## Cards Have Best Opportunity In Years at National Collegiate Meet 
### 
Stanford's recent victory over the
University of California track team
has placed the Cardinal cinderpathers
in a commanding position to win the
I. C. A. A. A. A. meet which will be
held at Cambridge, Mass., on May 30
and 31. Whether they will win or not
will depend largely on the efforts of
the individual stars on the team, and
not on the combined strength of the
second- and third-place winners as it
did in the Big Meet.
Several Cardinal runners and field
men are almost certain to be among
the list of point winners in the Inter
collegiate conflict. "Tiny" Hartranft,
heralded as the foremost weight man
in the United States, should easily
add ten points to the Stanford column,
and ten points in the I. C. A. A. A. A.
meet will put the Cardinals off to a
good start toward victory. The meet
last year was won by the University
of California, and it was the large
number of weight men who were re
sponsible for the good showing of the
western athletes.
Leistner in Top Form
Leistner was in top form Saturday
for the Big Meet and should place in
both hurdle events in the East. He is
in the habit of improving all season
and being at his best in the final meet.
However, he will have stiff competi
tion from Kinsey and Johnson of Illi
nois if the Big Ten college sends a
team to Boston. Brookins of lowa is
also a speed demon over the sticks.
Hale and Campbell in the 100 and
220 form a formidable pair who should
make a good account of themselves in
any sprint competition. Hale has run
the 100 in 9 9-10 and Campbell won
the 220 from California last year in
21 7-10. $
Miller Is Sure Bet.
Miller is a sure bet in the 440 after
his record run of 49 5-10 last Saturday,
and Storie can be counted on to hang
up good times in the same event.
Storie also runs a fast 220. In the
half-mile Richardson and Macintosh
will come close to places in any open
meet, after turning in such times as
1:55 5-10. And if "Dink" Templeton
decides to take a four-man two-mile
relay team to the Cambridge meet,
this pair with Swayne and Daly can
be counted on to make a good fight
for first honors.
In the mile is Kerr as the leader of
the trio of the Big Meet winners, with
Smith and Elliott close behind. All
three men are possible choices for
places on the team to make the trip
East. Charles has been right on deck
in the two-mile all season and with a
little further conditioning, which he
lacked last Saturday, he should be
much respected among the two-mile
competition in the I. C. A. A. A. A.
Anderson Is Possible Choice
Anderson proved himself a danger
ous competitor in the high jump when

he went over the bar at 6 feet 2y 2
inches after taking a first place Satur
day at 6 feet. Both he and Kemnitzer
have done 6 feet practically all season,
and Ludeke can also be considered a
prospect in the event, after his sur
prise jump of 5 feet 10 inches in the
Big Meet.
Mac√üae has made better than 22
feet G inches in the broad jump and
has been improving all season. Either
he or Wright, who has not been far
behind him, ma) land a place on the
team which will probably go East and
attend the annual classic. Probably
ten men will be taken with a possi
bility that as many as fifteen will
make the trip. With such good chances
to win the I. C. A. A. A. A. this year,
no effort will be spared to convert
those chances into a victory.
Dennis and Scofield in the pole
vault have done better than 12 feet
this year, but could hardly reach the
heights attained by Dean Brownell of
Ilinois. If a mile relay team i 3 anion,?
the lucky number, Coverley or Mixon
will probably be the fourtn man to
complete the team compose ! of Cap
tain Van Judah, Miller, and Storie.
