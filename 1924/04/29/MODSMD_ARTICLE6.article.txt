# "DINK" TEMPLETON MAY ENTER TEAM IN I. C. 4 A.
## Cards Have Best Opportunity In Years at National Collegiate Meet 
### 
Stanford's recent victory over the
University of California track team
has placed the Cardinal cinderpathers
in a commanding position to win the
I. C. A. A. A. A. meet which will be
held at Cambridge, Mass., on May 30
and 31. Whether they will win or not
will depend largely on the efforts of
the individual stars on the team, and
not on the combined strength of the
second- and third-place winners as it
did in the Big Meet.
Several Cardinal runners and field
men are almost certain to be among
the list of point winners in the Inter
collegiate conflict. "Tiny" Hartranft,
heralded as the foremost weight man
in the United States, should easily
add ten points to the Stanford column,
and ten points in the I. C. A. A. A. A.
meet will put the Cardinals off to a
good start toward victory. The meet
last year was won by the University
of California, and it was the large
number of weight men who were re
sponsible for the good showing of the
western athletes.
Leistner in Top Form
Leistner was in top form Saturday
for the Big Meet and should place in
both hurdle events in the East. He is
in the habit of improving all season
and being at his best in the final meet.
However, he will have stiff competi
tion from Kinsey and Johnson of Illi
nois if the Big Ten college sends a
team to Boston. Brookins of lowa is
also a speed demon over the sticks.
