# JUNIOR OPERA WILL COMBINE ACTION WITH ROMANCE
## Theme of Plot Switches From New York Society to Island of Bahamas 
### 
Three partners, romance, mystery,
and intrigue, will once more make
their bow before the footlights, when
the curtain goes up on the Junior
Opera the evening of May 10.
The plot sweeps along with amazing
rapidity and skill, from blase New
York, where society is just the same
humdrum thing over again and again
every day, to a mystery island in the
Bahamas, the home of pirates and
rum-runners. The first act starts out
without the usual delay of character
introduction. The action is fast, the
lines full of sarcastic or humorous
meaning, and the songs and chorus
numbers original and catchy.
Mr. and Mrs. Devoe, Dave Mannoc
eir and Helen Broughall (devout Chris
tian people), have an exceedingly
beautiful and eligible daughter, played
by Marjorie Allen. Blair Fawkes, as
Lew Forest, the lover, who is tired of
all the every day existence of New
York society with its shams and arti
ficialities, talks her into going to a
tropical island in the Bahams —the
back-to-nature stunt. Nan consents
only on one condition —that her Aunt
Abagail (Mable Ferry) go as chape
ron.
But, all is not yet over. The two
brothers of romance, mystery and in
trigue, sneak from the shadows and
pause before the footlights on their
way backstage—the devout Mr. Devoe
is not all he appears. Coupled beneath
his holy attitude lies a spirit that
breathes of wick;ed,ness and sup
pressed desires. A plot is evident be
tween him and Harvey—Murray Ward
—in which the sum of $10,000 changes
hands and smuggled liquor is men
tioned. Using the old saying, "the plot
thickens."
However, the seamy side of life is
evident in the person of Deacon Hig
gins. Being a spiritual side-kick of Mr.
Devoe, who, he thinks, believes in
Santa Claus, too, "Hock" Chalmers
ought to be the center of attraction
whenever he is on the stage. After
Trago has him rehearse by himself,
"Hock" has to go home so that the
rest of the cast can go on with their
rehearsals; otherwise another night
is chalked up as being a failure for
dramatic accomplishment.
