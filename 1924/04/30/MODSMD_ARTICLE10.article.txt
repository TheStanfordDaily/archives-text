Stanford Roughs appear to be more
interested in the name contest for the
confectionery than any other individu

the number of names suggested by
the hardy gentlemen. One Rough
turned in nineteen names.
Rules for the Name Contest are
printed again for the benefit of those
who are not yet acquainted with them.
Send all names suggested to the Name
Contest Editor, Daily Palo Alto, before
noon, Tuesday, May 6. At this time
the names will be turned over to the
Union Board of Governors who will
select the best name. A $5 money

the suggestion bearing the earliest
postmark will be awarded the prize.
