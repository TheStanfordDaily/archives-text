# Interest Grows in Name Contest; Roughs Active In Title Suggestions
## 
### 
Stanford Roughs appear to be more
interested in the name contest for the
confectionery than any other individu
al type of the campus, judging from
the number of names suggested by
the hardy gentlemen. One Rough
turned in nineteen names.
Rules for the Name Contest are
printed again for the benefit of those
who are not yet acquainted with them.
Send all names suggested to the Name
Contest Editor, Daily Palo Alto, before
noon, Tuesday, May 6. At this time
the names will be turned over to the
Union Board of Governors who will
select the best name. A $5 money
order on the store will be given to
the person who hands in the best
name. In case that more than one per
son should hand in the same name,
the suggestion bearing the earliest
postmark will be awarded the prize.

Stanford orchestra augmented by sev
eral volunteer players.
Will Give Harp Solo
Miss Barbara Merkley, a former
member of the San Francisco Sym
phony Orchestra, will give a harp solo.
Christine Howells Pfund, of San Fran
cisco, will give a flute solo.
With the exception of the intervals
in which the soloists perform, the
orchestra will play throughout the
performance. Parts of the pieces of
eminent composers have been arrang
ed into a continuous accompaniment
for the pageant. Selections appropriate
to the various moods of the dances
and to the different phases of the story
were chosen by Willis-Porter.
Priestesses Will Sing Chorals
Three choral odes, the words of
which were written by Evelyn Brown
ell, have been set to music by Maria
Anderson and Ottilia "Anderson. These
odes, which will be sung by the priest
esses, assisted by Schubert Club, ex
press the atmosphere of the story.
After the singing of the first choral
ode, the pageant opens with the
strains of Mendelssohn's "Overture."
Bach's "Awakening of Spring" makes
a triumphant accompaniment for the
entrance of Tmolus, god of the moun
tains, and his court. The "Valse," by
Burnham, furnishes music for Marcia
Morton's dance as Artemis, the moon
goddess. Violet Knowles and her sun
maidens dance to the strains of the
"Serenade d'Arlequin." Thame's "Sans
le Feuille" reflects the ill omen intro
duced by the old soothsayer in the
second part of the plot. Cilia's "Inter
mezzo" is a light accompaniment for
the dance of the flower maidens, while
Grieg's "Minuet" gives an appropriate
background for the rhythmic dance of
the rainbow maidens. The teasing
strains of MacDowell's "Witches
Dance" supply the melody for Apollo's
pursuit of Daphne.
