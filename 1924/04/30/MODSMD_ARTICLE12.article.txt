# CHANCES GOOD IN OLYMPICS
## Cards Should Make Favorable Showing In Tryouts For Swimming Team 
### Alfred Post 
PRESENT Stanford swimming prospects for participation in the Olympic
Games will be put to the acid test in the far west Olympic tryouts slated
for May 25 at Searsville lake.
With Wally O'Connor, Elmer Collett, and A1 White already recommended
by the American Olympic Swimming Committee and with other Card mermen

in good condition, chances are favor
able for a large delegation from the
Farm making the Paris trip.
Survivors of the Searsville tests
must qualify in the national tryouts
at Indianapolis June 5 before their
membership on the American team is
assured.
Dave Fall, holder of the junior low
board diving championship. the
Fletcher brothers, Ted Smith, Wayne
Smith, Van King, Johnny Kenney, Bid
die Dorcy, and "Dutch" McCallister
are a few of the other Card entries.

All except the Fletchers specialize in
the dives.
Norman Ross, world famous swimmer
developed by Brandstcn, is now training
i at Searsville, and will try to stage a
j comeback in the tryouts. Clarence Pink
| ston, former Stanford aquatic star, will
! also enter.
A large delegation from Hawaii in
cludes other probable entrants.
While the Olympic tryouts loom as
the most important event on the spring
swimming calendar, the P.A.A. cham
pionships billed for May come in for a
large share of attention.
Stanford and the Olympic Club will
be the principal contestants. The junior
indoor events will be held in the Encina
pool May 3, and the senior outdoor com
petition at Searsville May 10 and 11.
Tentative Card entries in the junior
meet are as follows:
50-yard free style—Doerr, Wright.
100-yard free style—Brooks.
220-yard free style—Williams, L.
Fletcher.
500-yard free style—Stevenson, Brooks.
150-yard back stroke—Allen.
220-yard breast stroke—Hanley.
Low board diving — Wayne Smith,
Dorcy, Kenney.
High board diving — Wayne Smith,
Dorcy, Kenney.
Four Record-Holders to Compete
Hanley, who equalled the Stanford-
California freshman record in his event
this year in 1:23, is a good bet to place
first. Doerr, who set a new record of
0:26 1-5 in the 50-yard free style in this
year's freshman meet, and L. Fletcher
and Newhouse, who performed similar
feats in the 100-yard back stroke and
plunge respectively, are other fast con
tenders. Fletcher's time was 1:18 and
Nevvhouse's mark was 68 feet 9 inches.
In the senior diving, White, Gibbons,
and Dorcy will take off from the 10-foot
board and White will perform at the
greater height. In view of his past show
ing A1 White is expected to walk off
with first honors, without much trouble.
A competition for the national diving
and swimming championship of the A.
A.'U. is on the boards at Searsville May
18, one week before the Olympic try
outs.
White, Fall Will Dive
A1 White and Dave Fall are Card en
tries in the senior high diving and have
a good chance to place first.
To Coach F.rnie Brandsten must go the
credit for Stanford swimmers' reputa
tion.

year's freshman meet, and L. Fletcher
and Newhouse, who performed similar
feats in the 100-yard back stroke and
