# FOOTBALL VETERANS START SPRING WORK
## 
### 
Practically all the men who were on
last fall's football team, and who will he
eligible next year, are now out on the
field for spring practice. These men in

hands at football once more after having
taken California down the line in base

Last night eight teams, with a few
extra men, worked out. A number of
new formations and plays were tried by
Warner, which may be used in the
fall. In addition, the men are being well
grounded in the fundamentals of the
Warner system.
"The men show a much better knowl
edge of football than they did in last
spring's practice," says Warner. He at

From the looks of things Stanford will
have abundant material to form two
backfields next fall. Nevers, Solomon,
and Bogue, are a powerful trio of full
backs. Dick Law son and Mitchell are
two quarterbacks, but Trombetta and
Baldwin from the may also be used
in this position.
There will bo plenty of halfbacks on
hand next fall. Noy-ni Cleaveland,
star half of )ast season'? team, who is
now in Paris with the American Olympic
rugby team, has announced his intention
of coming back to school in September,
as he will be eligible for one more year
of varsity competition. During the past
season he was troubled with a poor knee,
which handicapped him in several games,
