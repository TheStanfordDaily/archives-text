# FOOTBALL VETERANS START SPRING WORK
## 
### 
Practically all the men who were on
last fall's football team, and who will he
eligible next year, are now out on the
field for spring practice. These men in
clude Ernie Nevers, Solomon, Jim Law
son, "Chuck" Johnson, and Morris Cud
deback, who are now ready to try their
hands at football once more after having
taken California down the line in base
ball.
Signal practice and scrimmage have
been the main dishes which "Pop" War
ner has been serving up to the men out
for spring football.
Last night eight teams, with a few
extra men, worked out. A number of
new formations and plays were tried by
Warner, which may be used in the
fall. In addition, the men are being well
grounded in the fundamentals of the
Warner system.
"The men show a much better knowl
edge of football than they did in last
spring's practice," says Warner. He at
tributes this largely to Andy Kerr.
From the looks of things Stanford will
have abundant material to form two
backfields next fall. Nevers, Solomon,
and Bogue, are a powerful trio of full
backs. Dick Law son and Mitchell are
two quarterbacks, but Trombetta and
Baldwin from the may also be used
in this position.
There will bo plenty of halfbacks on
hand next fall. Noy-ni Cleaveland,
star half of )ast season'? team, who is
now in Paris with the American Olympic
rugby team, has announced his intention
of coming back to school in September,
as he will be eligible for one more year
of varsity competition. During the past
season he was troubled with a poor knee,
which handicapped him in several games,
but it is all right now and he should be
due for a big season next year.
Hyland Will Be Back
Dick Hyland, who is also in Paris,
starred as an open field runner for the
frosli the past season, and should make a
good man at advancing the ball. In ad
dition to these two, Dennis, Wheat, and
Cuddcback of last season's varsity will
be back. All three have played football
for two years under the Warner system.
To further add to the troubles which
Warner and Kerr will have in selecting
their backfield next fall, the frosh arc
sending up five more half backs who
look like potential varsity material,
Garthwaite, Docrr, Herth, Trombetta,
and Moore. Of these five, Herth and
Garthwaite have shown up best so far in
spring practice.

hand next fall. Noy-ni Cleaveland,
star half of )ast season'? team, who is
now in Paris with the American Olympic
rugby team, has announced his intention
of coming back to school in September,
as he will be eligible for one more year
of varsity competition. During the past
season he was troubled with a poor knee,
which handicapped him in several games,
but it is all right now and he should be
due for a big season next year.
Hyland Will Be Back
Dick Hyland, who is also in Paris,
starred as an open field runner for the
frosli the past season, and should make a
good man at advancing the ball. In ad
dition to these two, Dennis, Wheat, and
Cuddcback of last season's varsity will
be back. All three have played football
for two years under the Warner system.
To further add to the troubles which
Warner and Kerr will have in selecting
their backfield next fall, the frosh arc
sending up five more half backs who
look like potential varsity material,
Garthwaite, Docrr, Herth, Trombetta,
and Moore. Of these five, Herth and
Garthwaite have shown up best so far in
spring practice.

Practically all the men who were on
last fall's football team, and who will he
eligible next year, are now out on the
field for spring practice. These men in
clude Ernie Nevers, Solomon, Jim Law
son, "Chuck" Johnson, and Morris Cud
deback, who are now ready to try their
hands at football once more after having
taken California down the line in base
ball.
Signal practice and scrimmage have
been the main dishes which "Pop" War
ner has been serving up to the men out
for spring football.
Last night eight teams, with a few
extra men, worked out. A number of
new formations and plays were tried by
Warner, which may be used in the
fall. In addition, the men are being well
grounded in the fundamentals of the
Warner system.
"The men show a much better knowl
edge of football than they did in last
spring's practice," says Warner. He at
tributes this largely to Andy Kerr.
From the looks of things Stanford will
have abundant material to form two
backfields next fall. Nevers, Solomon,
and Bogue, are a powerful trio of full
backs. Dick Law son and Mitchell are
two quarterbacks, but Trombetta and
Baldwin from the may also be used
in this position.
There will bo plenty of halfbacks on
