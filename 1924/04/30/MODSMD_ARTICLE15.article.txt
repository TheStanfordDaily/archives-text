# CARD TRACKSTERS WILL PARTICIPATE IN RELAY EVENTS
## Varsity Will Be Entered in P. A. A. Meet at Stanford On Saturday, May 17 
### 
Because of a lack of interest, the
Western Relays, which were to have been
held at Berkeley, have been cancelled.
As a substitute, Coach "Dink" Tem
pleton will stage a relay carnival on the
track oval on May 8. Varsity and fresh
man athletes will compete in the quarter,
half, mile, two-mile, and four-mile re
lays. While the cinder pathcrs are com
peting in these events the field men will
be taking part in a regular competitive
meet.
The best four varsity runners in each
distance will run on the same team. Other
teams will be selected to run against the
varsity men, and will be given handicaps
to make the races closer and more inter
esting.
P. A. A. Meet May 17
The P. A. A. meet will take place at
Stanford the following week, on May
17. As this competition is also serving
as a meet for Olympic tryouts this year,
a strong group of entries are expected.
The two strongest outside entrants will
be the California varsity and freshman
stars and the Olympic Club track teams.
