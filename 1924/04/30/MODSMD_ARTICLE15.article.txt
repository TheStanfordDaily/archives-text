# CARD TRACKSTERS WILL PARTICIPATE IN RELAY EVENTS
## Varsity Will Be Entered in P. A. A. Meet at Stanford On Saturday, May 17 
### 
Because of a lack of interest, the
Western Relays, which were to have been
held at Berkeley, have been cancelled.
As a substitute, Coach "Dink" Tem
pleton will stage a relay carnival on the
track oval on May 8. Varsity and fresh
man athletes will compete in the quarter,
half, mile, two-mile, and four-mile re
lays. While the cinder pathcrs are com
peting in these events the field men will
be taking part in a regular competitive
meet.
The best four varsity runners in each
distance will run on the same team. Other
teams will be selected to run against the
varsity men, and will be given handicaps
to make the races closer and more inter
esting.
P. A. A. Meet May 17
The P. A. A. meet will take place at
Stanford the following week, on May
17. As this competition is also serving
as a meet for Olympic tryouts this year,
a strong group of entries are expected.
The two strongest outside entrants will
be the California varsity and freshman
stars and the Olympic Club track teams.
Some of the smaller organizations around
the peninsula will also send men to take
part.
The relay carnival and the P. A. A.
meet will give "Dink" an opportunity to
determine the men he will take East with
him to represent Stanford at the I. C.
A. A. A. A. It is probable that about
fifteen men will be selected to make the
trip; or at least, all of the men who
have a chance of placing in the nation's
track classic will be chosen.
Hale, Campbell, Gaspar, and Storie are
likely choices for the shorter distance
events. The mile relay team will prob
ably be made up of Miller, Storie, Ju
dah, and Mixon or Coverly.
Fast Two-Mile Team
In the two-mile relay Stanford has one
of the best, if not the best, teams in the
country. With Richardson and Mcintosh
both running less than 1:56 and with
Swayne and Daly doing beter than 2:00
flat the Redshirts would not have much
to worry about in any competition.
For the four-mile team, and equally
powerful aggregation is on hand, consist
ing of Kerr, Smith, Elliott, and Murphy
or Thayer.
However, these groups of first raters
are not so much superior to the other
runners under "Dink's" eye that they will
have any walkaway, considering that they
will be running against men who have a
handicap.
Field Men Not Chosen
The work of the field men in the next
two meets will be almost wholly respon
sible for the selection of those to go to
Cambridge. At present "Tiny" Hartranft
and Fred Anderson are about the only
men who are certain of berths. Ludeke
in the hammer, Arthur and Richards in
the weights, Scofield and Dennis in the
pole vault, Macßae and Wright in the
broad jump, and Evers in the javelin are
the other men who may get one of the
coveted places if they can show the nec
essary improvement between now and the
latter part of next month.

varsity men, and will be given handicaps
to make the races closer and more inter
esting.
P. A. A. Meet May 17
The P. A. A. meet will take place at
Stanford the following week, on May
17. As this competition is also serving
as a meet for Olympic tryouts this year,
a strong group of entries are expected.
The two strongest outside entrants will
be the California varsity and freshman
stars and the Olympic Club track teams.
Some of the smaller organizations around
the peninsula will also send men to take
part.
The relay carnival and the P. A. A.
meet will give "Dink" an opportunity to
determine the men he will take East with
him to represent Stanford at the I. C.
A. A. A. A. It is probable that about
fifteen men will be selected to make the
trip; or at least, all of the men who
have a chance of placing in the nation's
track classic will be chosen.
Hale, Campbell, Gaspar, and Storie are
likely choices for the shorter distance
events. The mile relay team will prob
ably be made up of Miller, Storie, Ju
dah, and Mixon or Coverly.
Fast Two-Mile Team
In the two-mile relay Stanford has one
of the best, if not the best, teams in the
country. With Richardson and Mcintosh
both running less than 1:56 and with
Swayne and Daly doing beter than 2:00
flat the Redshirts would not have much
to worry about in any competition.
For the four-mile team, and equally
powerful aggregation is on hand, consist
ing of Kerr, Smith, Elliott, and Murphy
or Thayer.
However, these groups of first raters
are not so much superior to the other
runners under "Dink's" eye that they will
have any walkaway, considering that they
will be running against men who have a
handicap.
Field Men Not Chosen
The work of the field men in the next
two meets will be almost wholly respon
sible for the selection of those to go to
Cambridge. At present "Tiny" Hartranft
and Fred Anderson are about the only
men who are certain of berths. Ludeke
in the hammer, Arthur and Richards in
the weights, Scofield and Dennis in the
pole vault, Macßae and Wright in the
broad jump, and Evers in the javelin are
the other men who may get one of the
coveted places if they can show the nec
essary improvement between now and the
latter part of next month.
Because of a lack of interest, the
Western Relays, which were to have been
held at Berkeley, have been cancelled.
As a substitute, Coach "Dink" Tem
pleton will stage a relay carnival on the
track oval on May 8. Varsity and fresh
man athletes will compete in the quarter,
half, mile, two-mile, and four-mile re
lays. While the cinder pathcrs are com
peting in these events the field men will
be taking part in a regular competitive
meet.
The best four varsity runners in each
distance will run on the same team. Other
teams will be selected to run against the
varsity men, and will be given handicaps
to make the races closer and more inter
esting.
