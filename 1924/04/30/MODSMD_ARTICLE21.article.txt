# "The Legend of the Laurel"
## 
### 
The Women of the University, through the W. A. A. will present the
"Legend of the Laurel" 011 the hanks of Lagunita Saturday afternoon.
This year's production has required a great deal of preparation and has
been worked up in spite of difficulties.
The lake, such an important part in the settings of past pageants, has
not been any help this year. The women have gone ahead, however, in
spite of all hindrances, and the production will be, from all indications, up
to the high standards set in the past.
This recommendation in itself should assure a good attendance Satur
day afternoon, for pageants of other years have been well handled. This
kind of entertainment is practically unique at Stanford. There is noth
ing which is exactly comparable to it.
Practically every woman in the University will have some part in the
fiesta or will help in producing it. Students as well as people of Palo Alto
will find the "Legend of the Laurel" well worth attending. It is a produc
tion well worthy of support and there should be a large crowd on hand to
make it a success.
