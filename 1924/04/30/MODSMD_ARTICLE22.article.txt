# An Opportunity
## 
### 
Every student in the University will be given an opportunity in the
next few days to contribute something to one of the most worthy causes
promoted here in many years.
The class of 1924 is taking the lead in this matter, and deserves a great
deal of credit for its handling of the case. It will not be charity, but will
rather be in the nature of compensation and recognition of a humanitarian
obligation.
A dollar or two here and there and, in some cases, fifty or a hundred,
will not be missed by the donors and it is certain that even small contribu
tions will help to assure that the necessary amount be raised.
It is the duty of every student who is financially able to help out, to at
least some small extent.
