# Thrift
## 
### 
A story which appeared in yesterday's issue of the Daily Palo Alto
tells of a unique way to pile up a savings account without the help of a
bank. Whether or not the system described is a practical one is neither
here nor there.
However, it is certain that the average undergraduate would do well to
follow such an example, at least to the extent of laying aside a dollar or so
occasionally. It is a safe bet that the majority of students go through
college, spending whatever money comes their way, without much thought
of the future. The typical college student is invariably "broke."
A habit of thrift, developed early in life, inevitably leads to practices
which will help a man or woman a great deal in the business or profes
sional world.
