### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
It's a peculiar animal we have here. The only four-legged golfer in captivity,
the only race horse that ever won the National Open. It's a good thing the
Professional Golfers' tournament at French Lick and the Derby at Louisville
are not scheduled for the same day, since the queer critter pictured above is
scheduled to appear in both.
The Centaur's big victories include: National Open championship, '22;
P. G. A. title, '22 and '23; Kentucky Derby, '24 (?); Unbeaten 2-year-old of '23
season. The Centaur's big rivals last year were Walter Hagen and Happy
Thoughts. Quite a versatile athlete, this Sarazen, what?
Question as to his daily exercise and diet when training for the Derby and
the National Open, Sarazen said, "I play eighteen holes—around the track.
Then I eat a bushel of hay and a bushel of divots."
"What's the correct stance for the mile-and-a-quarter race?" we asked.
"On the backswing the weight is on your right hind hoof," he said.
"And do you know how many hoof-strokes you take to a round?"
"Neight, neigh," he answered.
