# SENATE RETARDS FORMING OF NEW FOREIGN POLICIES
## Graham H. Stuart Discusses Need for Co-operation With Government 
### 
"There is too much senate, and not
enough president in the foreign policy
of the United States," said Professor
Graham H. Stuart, of the Political
Science department last night when
he spoke on "A New Foreign Policy
lor the United States."
"The president," he said, "can main
tain his position in foreign affairs
only with the backing of the people.
They must pay attention to foreign
policies. This will bring about better
results between the president and the
senate.
Wants World Court
"Coolidge is now asking for a World
Court, which was endorsed by five
presidents before, McKinley, Roose
velt, Taft, Wilson, and Harding. But
he is not getting it because the bill is
being pigeon-holed by the senate."
Stuart asked that this question not
be made a political issue. He said,
"The American people must form in
telligent opinions. A recalcitrant sen
ate is holding up the World Court.
The only way is to have the people
make their opinions felt."
Open Door Policy Alive
In reviewing the basis of the United
States foreign policy, the Monroe Doc
trine, the non-intervention policy, and
the Open Door policy, Professor Stu
art said that the only one which is still
alive is that of the Open Door.
Stuart believes that the Monroe
Doctrine, which has been in opera
tion since 1893, is obsolete today,
since there is no opportunity for fur
ther colonization in the western hem
isphere, and protection is no longer
needed against European govern
ments.
Washington's greatly-quoted fare
well address, in which the neutrality
policy was formulated, is usually read,
according to Stuart, without making
mention of the fact that he also said
the United States should perform all
agreements already made.
U. S. No Longer Isolated
Although the "Irreconcilables" in
terpret this to mean isolation, the vast
changes in communication, economic
factors, and political developments,
especially after 1896, when the United
States became a world power, makes
it impossible for the United States to
maintain the same political policies,
in the opinion of Stuart.
"The senate," said Stuart, "wishes
to maintain the same policy of isola
tion and is opposed to the World
Court even though the present admin
istration is in favor of it."
The Open Door policy, which is a
policy of cooperation, must have aid
by the people, thinks Stuart. It is the
one thing that has helped Japan and
the United States get together after
years of hostility.

policy was formulated, is usually read,
according to Stuart, without making
mention of the fact that he also said
the United States should perform all
agreements already made.
U. S. No Longer Isolated
Although the "Irreconcilables" in
terpret this to mean isolation, the vast
changes in communication, economic
factors, and political developments,
especially after 1896, when the United
States became a world power, makes
it impossible for the United States to
maintain the same political policies,
in the opinion of Stuart.
"The senate," said Stuart, "wishes
to maintain the same policy of isola
tion and is opposed to the World
Court even though the present admin
istration is in favor of it."
The Open Door policy, which is a
policy of cooperation, must have aid
by the people, thinks Stuart. It is the
one thing that has helped Japan and
the United States get together after
years of hostility.
"There is too much senate, and not
enough president in the foreign policy
of the United States," said Professor
Graham H. Stuart, of the Political
Science department last night when
he spoke on "A New Foreign Policy
lor the United States."
"The president," he said, "can main
tain his position in foreign affairs
only with the backing of the people.
They must pay attention to foreign
policies. This will bring about better
results between the president and the
senate.
Wants World Court
"Coolidge is now asking for a World
Court, which was endorsed by five
presidents before, McKinley, Roose
velt, Taft, Wilson, and Harding. But
he is not getting it because the bill is
being pigeon-holed by the senate."
Stuart asked that this question not
be made a political issue. He said,
"The American people must form in
telligent opinions. A recalcitrant sen
ate is holding up the World Court.
The only way is to have the people
make their opinions felt."
Open Door Policy Alive
In reviewing the basis of the United
States foreign policy, the Monroe Doc
trine, the non-intervention policy, and
the Open Door policy, Professor Stu
art said that the only one which is still
alive is that of the Open Door.
Stuart believes that the Monroe
Doctrine, which has been in opera
tion since 1893, is obsolete today,
since there is no opportunity for fur
ther colonization in the western hem
isphere, and protection is no longer
needed against European govern
ments.
Washington's greatly-quoted fare
well address, in which the neutrality
policy was formulated, is usually read,
according to Stuart, without making
mention of the fact that he also said
the United States should perform all
agreements already made.
