# CONFECTIONERY TO BE ENLARGED WHEN WEATHER PERMITS
## 
### 
As soon as the volume of business
justifies it and the weather permits,
the un-named Union sweet shoppe will
enlarge its quarters. This is not a re
sult of the great interest shown by
the campus in the present name con
test, but it may be an important fac
tor in the final selection of the names
suggested.
Tables will be placed outside on a
terrace, thus making outdoor service
available for those who prefer it. At
tractive awnings will be hung from
the second story of the Old Union,
giving a Russian effect.
To obtain this desired improvement
all the students have to do is to
spend more money with the "Campus
Life Saver," as one aspiring contest
ant insists upon calling it, and pray
for a warm summer sun. If this is
done, Miss Handy, the director of the
Stanford Union, has promised the
magic change to be made in the near
future.
Now, as to how the Name Contest
is progressing. FAMOUSLY! The
morning's mail brought an overflow
of suggestions, most of which were
good. The Snakes have even conde
scended to join with the rest, and
several have submitted appropriate
names. But the women are still far
behind; we hope to receive their sug
gestions sometime before noon, Tues
day, May 6, at which time the contest
will close.
The prize for the largest number of
names submitted by any one person
is held by a proud Snake. Until yes
terday a Rough this distinct honor,
but the Snake got busy and sent in 36
suggestions, which is double the num
ber received -from the former. Some
of the suggestions are: "The Bon Mot,"
"Sign of the Sour Apple," "Co-eds'
Tavern," "Spark Plug's Stable," "The
Rig Eat," "Epicurus' Home," "The
Better 'Ole," and "The Red Hat."
Do you want "The Thirst Controller"
to go through life with such a handi
cap as one of the above? If not, get
busy, send your suggestions to the
Name Contest Editor, in care of the
Daily Palo Alto, and win $5.00!

The course in hotel management at
Cornell has become so successful that
the students intend to start a hotel
wherein practical experience may be
obtained. This is a large undertaking
and its success or failure will prob
ably set the example for other col
leges.
