# CHARACTER. DANCING ROLES IN FIESTA NUMEROUS
## Detailed Rehearsal Held for Women's Pageant on May 3 
### 
Opportunity for individual dramatic
work as well as skill in sole and en
semble dancing is provided in the
"Legend of the Laurel," the women's
pageant to be given at the lake at 4
o'clock next Saturday afternoon.
A complete and detailed rehearsal
of the fiesta was held this afternoon
from 1 to 6 o'clock at the lake. The
entire twenty-five-piese orchestra

practiced with the cast for the first
time today.
Eight Character Roles
The pageant calls for eight charac
ter roles, and the women taking the
leading parts have endeavored to
make them distinctive and realistic.
Daphne Hodgson as Apollo, the sun
god, forms the center for most of the
action of the story. The pageant opens
with a festival on the Grecian island
of Delos. A musical contest between
Pan and Apollo is held in which the
sun god is proclaimed victor. The
sprightly Pan reluctantly offers to give
Apollo his pipes as the sign of the
god's superiority, but Apollo refuses
the little Pan's offer with a grace and
dignity which characterize his acting
throughout the pageant.
The latter part of the story is de
voted to the tale of Apollo's unre
quited love for Daphne, the dew sprite.
In the love-making fantasy which
takes place between Apollo and
Daphne, the yearning and desire of
the god and the modesty and elusive
ness of the dew sprite are well por
trayed. Velma Randall, as Daphne, dis
tinguishes herself by her graceful
dancing and excellent acting.
Carolan Strouse Is Pan
Carolan Strouse as Pan introduces
a note of the fantastic into the story.
She plays her part with enthusiasm.
Anna McAnear brings a regal dignity
to the role of Tmolus, the god of the
mountains. Gertrude Byler makes a
realistic ancient and threatening
soothsayer.
Among the solo dances in the pa
geant are those of Marcia Morton as
the moon goddess, Violet Knowles as
leader of the sun maidens, and Mar
garet Schaufelberger, leader of the
rainbow maidens.
Tickets for the fiesta will be on sale
on the grounds Saturday afternoon.
They are also being handled by Cran
dall's and by Sherman and Clay's in
Palo Alto. Students may purchase
tickets at J. E. McDowell's office.
