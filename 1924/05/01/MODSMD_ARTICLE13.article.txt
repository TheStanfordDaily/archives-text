# EXCLUSION BILL PRESENTED OPPORTUNELY, SAYS TREAT
## Former Elections Have Not Favored Sponsors Of Bills Violating Treaties 
### Beatrice Flesher 
"I was well aware that an attempt
would be made to pass an exclusion
bill at this session of Congress, and
that it would stand an unusual chance
of success because of the approaching
presidential election," said Professor
Payson J. Treat, head of the History
department, and an authority on Far
Kastern affairs, this week, when inter
viewed on the Japanese immigration
problem.
Exclusion Poor for Politics
Precedent, however, does not seem
to fayor those who have passed such
laws for like purposes, according to
Treat. He said, "In dealing with the
Chinese question thirty and forty
years ago, the drastic laws were I
passed on the eve of the presidential |

elections when both Republicans and
Democrats were vying with each other
for the vote of California, then a
doubtful state.
"It is of interest to the student of
politics to note that the presidents
who signed anti-Chinese bills, which
violated our treaty obligations with
China, were defeated in the following
elections.
Cleveland Failed
"Cleveland signed the Scott Act, in
1888, and was defeated that year. Har
rison signed the Geary Act, in 1892.
and soon after went down to defeat.
"And Congressman Geary of Cali
fornia, who introduced this drastic
anti-Chitiese measure, was retired by j
his own constituents in the following]
November.
"It is almost impossible for readers
of the current newspapers to under
stand the reason for so much surprise
and indignation in Japan at the pas
sage of an immigration bill by an
American Congress."
Japanese Indignation Warranted
Professor Treat says the reason for
this is simple. "The bill proposes to
violate an existing treaty without any
discussion or attempt, to meet the
problem by international agreement.
If the terms of the Commercial Treaty
of 1911 can be set aside as casually
as that, then the Japanese ask them
selves what faith can be attached to
the Washington Conference jtgree
ment and other treaties with Amer
ica."
