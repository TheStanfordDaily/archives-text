# OPERA SETS TO GIVE EFFECT OF REALISM
## South Sea Island Portrayed On Back-Drop Painted By Leslie Kiler 
### James Muir 
In designing and building the sets
for the. Junior Opera, the technical
staff has obtained realistic effects that
will surprise the audience.
Only two sets are used. The first
represents the luxurious New York
residence of Mr. Devoe, the pious
head of the Prohibition Enforcement
League. A series of platforms rise to
a terrace in back where there is a
wall of rich tapestries with two large
windows extending up out of sight.
The impression is one of elegance.
In the last two acts it is an ocean
scene on the Bahama Islands. The
back-drop, painted by Leslie Kiler,
"Portrays a sun-reflecting ocean with
a coral reef and islands covered with
cocoanut trees in the background.
Down stage, breeze-stirred palm trens
with a palm-covered hut on the sunlit
beach are silhouetted. One has the
feeling that he is sitting in a dark
cave looking out upon the gently
moving Atlantic ocean on a balmy
tropical day. In the night scenes stars
wink in the sky.
Lights to Bring Out Details
Lights will play on this back-drop
from all parts of the stage, from both
sides of the balcony and from the rear
of the Assembly hall to bring out
every detail of the scene.
Harvey Lytel, with his crew of stage
hands, has not been backward in his
work in erecting the sets. The first
act flats were completed two weeks
ago and the island scene was in use
at last night's rehearsal. This leaves
an entire week for experimental work
directed towards the heightening of
all the realistic effects.
