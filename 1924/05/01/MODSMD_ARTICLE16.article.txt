# Senate Has Privilege of Investigating Executive Acts, Says Victor J. West
## 
### 
"The Senate has a perfect right to
investigate executive acts in the Tea
Pot Oil Scandal and the president has
no right to object," said Victor J.
West of the Political Science Depart
ment before Euphronia Literary So
ciety at its regular meeting last night.
Professor West has made a special
study of the investigation in view of
the coming election and gave the Eu
phronia men the conclusions of this
study. "The cabinet is the creature of
the legislative department," he said,
"and has a perfect right to bring any
of its members before the legislature
to try them,"
The professor expressed himself as
satisfied, in the main, that the work
done by the investigating committees
was beneficial.
