# ALPHA DELT, CHI PSI LOSE TO KAPPA SIG AND THETA XI NINES
## 
### 
Theta Xi kept up its winning streak
yesterday when it won from Chi Psi
in the last inning by a score of 10
to 9. Kappa Sigma overwhelmed Alpha
Delta Phi 23 to 2 in the only other
intramural game played. El Capitan
won by default from Delta Tau Delta.
Theta Xi and El Capitan are tied
for first place in League 2. Both teams
have four victories to their credit and
no defeats. The winner of League 2
will be decided Monday when the two
nines clash in the final game.
The Theta Xi-Chi Psi contest was
full of thrills throughout. It was a see
aaw affair, with first one team in the
lead, and then the other. Theta Xi
scored one run in the first, and Chi Psi
forged ahead in the second, when they
chalked up five.
Theta Xi evened the score in the
fourth, and ran up a four-run lead the
following frame. The score remained
9 to 5 until the first half of the sev
enth.
With two on base, Ditzler, Chi Psi
chucker, knocked a home run to cen
ter field. One more runner scored, and
the rally had tied the score. This was
not enough, however. Thetu Xi's heav
er, Maillot, singled, and crossed the
plate for the winning run on infield
errors.
Alpha Delta Phi scored the first run
in their game with Kappa Sigma, but
the Kappa Sig batters hammered Roy
Dennis, Alpha Delt hurler, for seven
markers in the second. Moore, on the
mound for Kappa Sigma, had no trou
ble putting the opposing batsmen
away. The Kappa Sigs scored runs in
all but the first frame.
Tomorrow's games: Phi Delta Theta
vs. Delta Upsilon, Theta Chi vs. En
cnia 2, and El Tigre vs. Alpha Kappa
