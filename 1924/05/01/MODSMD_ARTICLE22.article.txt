# Hey, What's the Idea?
## 
### 
This morning at nine o'clock, some hundred and fifty students, mainly
upperclassmen, walked into an Economics class. The professor lectured
for about forty-five minutes and then announced that there would be a
short quiz.
The usual consternation that greets the announcement of a "sprung ex"
was evident on all sides. It was quite evident that no one expected such a
surprise. Some of the more fortunate and possibly more industrious
students went to work immediately with the confidence which comes of
constant preparation.
The less fortunate ones, among whom was numbered the writer of
this comment, gazed alxmt vacantly seeking inspiration which seemed ex
tremely elusive in many cases. In at least two cases the writer saw stu
dents resort to very questionable means for said inspiration; to-witâ€”their
neighbors' papers.
One case which was particularly flagrant, found an upperclassman
gazing furtively at the paper of a woman who sat on his right. The young
lady's writing must have been hard to decipher for the "sponge" was soon
so wrapped up in getting the desired information, that he forgot just how
peculiar a spectacle he was presenting. The writer was momentarily ex
pecting the dependent to ask the young lady to hand her paper over that he
might peruse it with greater ease.
The woman, who seemed to know just what the question meant and
how to answer it, soon finished and left, much to the chagrin of the parasite.
The Daily Palo Alto is at a very great loss to discover how a person's
mind works to force him to do that sort of thing. Plain cheating under
any system is despicable enough, but under the honor system it is intoler
able. The writer was tempted to get up, right in the middle of the exami
nation, and yell at the top of his voice, "Hey, what's the idea?"
However, nothing was done. The Daily Palo Alto assures the culprit
that the next case detected will be reporetd.
The Honor System has been in force at Stanford for about three years.
In that time, there have been comparatively few violations. The fact that
there are less cases of cheating here than in most universities, is not enough.
THERE SHOULD BE NO CHEATING UNDER THE HONOR
SYSTEM. When a man or woman is put on his or her honor, that should
remove all doubt as to any possibility of unfair and dishonest methods.
It is only a small but very obnoxious minority that offends in most
cases, It is this minority with which we must deal, if the Honor System
is to be perpetuated.
It will l)e noticed above, that the cheater has been called, in turn, a
sponge, a dependent, and a parasite. He is all of those, and a limited
vocabulary forces the Daily Palo Alto from expressing its real opinion of
the culprit.
