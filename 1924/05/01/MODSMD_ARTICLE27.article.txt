# AVERAGE STUDENT WALKS THOUSAND MILES A YEAR
## 
### 
How many miles does a student
walk each day? Carrying a pedome
ter, a sophomore in Oregon Agricul
tural College tried to answer this
question. The pedometer is a small in
strument, carried in the pocket, that
measures the distance walked.
The instrument registered miles
a day on the average. At this rate a
student would travel 32% miles a
school week, or 1040 miles a school
year.

Some of these reckless drivers who
are not wreckless drivers seem to be
driving on the theory that one good
turn deserves another.
