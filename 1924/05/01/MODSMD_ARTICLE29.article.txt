# STILLMAN'S BOOKS ON CHEMISTRY ARE GIVEN TO LIBRARY
## 
### 
The collection of books relating to
the history of chemistry, gathered by
the late Professor John Maxson Still
man, numbering 125 volumes and in
cluding many rare and valuable items,
has been presented to the Library. Dr.
Stillman, who was head of the Chem
istry department from the opening of
the University until his retirement in
1917, was deeply interested in the his
tory of chemistry, and these books
were purchased by him over a long
period of years. In his purchases he
avoided duplicating books possessed
already by the general Library or the
Lane Library of the Stanford Medical
School, so that this gift supplements
and enriches material already in the
University's possession on the history
of chemistry.
Works of Paracelsus in Collection
Among the especially scarce and
valuable volumes are the works of j
Paracelsus published in Strassburg,!
1616-18, the "Physiological Essays" of,
oyle, London, 1669, and "La Pirotech
nie" by Biringuccio, Paris, 1572.
The books were utilized by Dr. Still
man In a history of chemistry before
the modern era which he had com
pleted before his death and which will
be published during the summer by
the Appletons under the title, "Story
of Early Chemistry." This volume is
being issued under the direction of j
Professor Stewart W. Young of the j
Stanford Chemistry department.
Former Book Authoritative
A former book resulting from Dr.
Stillman's first-hand investigations in j
the history of chemistry is recognized;
as an authoritative discussion of the i
proper place of Paracelsus, the famous
medieval figure whose contributions
to the development of chemistry have
been a subject of controversy. Dr.
Stillman died in December of last
year. He began during the early years J
of his teaching at Stanford to offer;
courses to small classes in the his
tory of chemistry and during the time
between his retirement from active
teaching and his death he devoted
much of his energies to the comple
tion of his "Story of Early Chemistry."
