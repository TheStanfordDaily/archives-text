# TRAFFIC LAW 228 YEARS OLD BANNED IN LONDON
## 
### 
Law dating back to 1695 has just
been banned in London. It prohibited
the use of roads in Hyde Park by
"cabs." The commissioner of works
has decided that this regulation is out
of date. This new privilege will mean
a relief of pressure on the traffic
crowded streets of London.

The 1924 Quad sponsored a closed
date dance last spring, and at the
time it was thought that the custom
thus started would be continued in
future years.
