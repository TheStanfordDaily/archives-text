### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Grover Cleveland Alexander, famous Chicago Cub pitcher, has been in the
game since 1909 and never had any season in which he was nicked for more
than 3.62 runs per game as an average for the season. He is the holder of
numerous pitching records. Among his feats is the one of pitching 62 con
secutive innings without giving a base on balls. Maybe his name has some
thing to do with his successâ€”Grover Cleveland for the front part and
Alexander for the last. All Cub fans know him as "Alex the Great."
