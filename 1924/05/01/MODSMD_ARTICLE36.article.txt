# TALES FROM THE ARCHIVES
## A 						SERIES OF ARTICLES DEALING WITH THE HISTORY OF STANFORD'S BUILDINGS No. 11. ART GALLERY 
### Esther Greenacre 
Like the church and museum, the Stan
ford art gallery contributes materially to
the artistic atmosphere which distin
guishes Stanford from other American
universities.
The gift of Senator Stanford's brother,
Thomas Welton Stanford, the art gallery
was completed in 1917. It is identified
as one of the important art galleries of
California. With the exception of one in
Oakland, the Stanford art gallery is the
only one in California which is municipal
in the sense that it is open to the public
and that it contains exhibitions which are
changed periodically.
The building will serve as the key of
a future quadrangle. It was designed by
Bakewell and Brown, the two Stanford
alumni who planned Toyon and Branner
lulls. The primary purpose of the edifice
was to contain the numerous paintings
which Thomas Welton Stanford collected
in Australia. Senator Stanford's brother
first went to Australia with the purpose
of introducing kerosene lamps into the
country which was just being opened as a
mining field.
Stanford arranged and chartered
ships to carry oil to Australia and made
that country his home during the re
mainder of his life. He was an ardent
patron of Australian art and sent a total
of seventy-five pictures to the Univer
sity during his absence. These paintings
were housed in the museum until the
earthquake of 1906 destroyed two of the
wings of that building. The inadequate
room space in the museum after this
disaster made it impossible to effectively
display these paintings, and a gallery was
planned to contain them.
During the World War it was impos
sible to ship over Stanford's pictures
from Australia. With the assistance of
Vanderlynn Stow, business manager of
the University, and of President Wilbur,
Pedro Lemos arranged for changing ex
hibitions which should be displayed in the
gallery until the Stanford paintings

should arrive. Lemos, who had been di
rector of the Art Institute in San Fran
cisco and who came to Stanford in 1914,
has continued this plan of changing exhi
bitions, which has done much to make
the Stanford art gallery of note in Cali
fornia. He is also in charge of the
museum, being assisted in the art gallery
by his brother, F. B. Lemos.
Thomas Welton Stanford died shortly
after the close of the war, and his main
collection of paintings was sent to Stan
ford. The patron was very in
terested in the Australian artist, Curtis,
and kept him under his employment. He
was especially fond of Curtis' landscapes,
and many of these are found in the Stan
ford collection. In addition to those pic
tures which are hung in the art gallery,
numerous others collected by Thomas
Welton Stanford are distributed among
the offices and dormitories on the cam
pus. The entire group numbers between
two and three hundred paintings.
Frequent trips to Eastern art centers
are taken by Pedro Lemos for the pur
pose of scheduling exhibitions for the
Stanford gallery. Lemos is the western
representative of the American Art Fed
eration and arranges circuits in the west
for various artists. As many as three
exhibitions have been on display in the
building at one time. The pictures are
changed on the average of twice a month.
The Stanford gallery is purely educa
tional as it lays no stress on the com
mercial field. It is visited regularly by
art patrons from Cartnel, Monterey, and
the bay district. Announcements of its
exhibitions are made weekly in the Oak
land. Berkeley, and Carmel papers.
The lighting and hanging arrangements
in the building are considered excellent.
Neutral tinted walls display all colors to
best advantage while even at night the
lighting in the structure is remarkable.
All pictures in the various collections are
hung by F. B. Lemos, who arranges them
with great care.
