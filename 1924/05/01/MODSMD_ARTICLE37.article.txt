# SALAMANDER LIVES FOUR YEARS WITHOUT EATING
## 
### 
The biology department of the Uni
versity of Oregon has a salamander
which has not eaten for four years.
The animal shows clearly the results
of its long fast, for it is very emaciated
and fits well into the "skin and bones"
class. Its skin is wrinkled and hard,
and almost every bone in the animal's
body is visible.
When first acquired by the depart
ment, the salamander was given food,
but it showed no desire for decaying
leaves and dead organisms. For the
past four years it has not had any
thing to eat, yet it lives and is ex
pected to do so for some time.
Members of the biology faculty ex
plain that the animal is living on
stored-up energy and, due to its in
activity, it required but little of that.
