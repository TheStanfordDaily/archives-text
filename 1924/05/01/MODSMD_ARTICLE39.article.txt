# FIRST AID SERVICE PUT IN EFFECT FOR PENINSULA DRIVERS
## California Auto Association Announces New System For Its Members 
### 
The California Automobile Associa
tion announces mat a twenty-four
hour emergency road service has been
established for members of the asso
ciation in the vicinity of Palo Alto.
Mechanical aid and towing will be fur
nished to any stalled member of the
association providing that they have
their membership card with them. No
charge will be made for the service
and the no tipping rule will be strictly
enforced.
A telephone call to the association's
mechanical service station in Palo
Alto will bring an expert trouble
shooter to the scene at any time of
day or night. A special feature of the
service is the changing of tires for
motorists of the fairer sex. The Stan
lord Auto Company has been desig
nated as the official station and will
maintain the equipment that the asso
ciation requires. If you are a member
of the association and you are stalled
for any reason whatsoever, don't fail
to call the station. If mechanical as
sistance can not be rendered on the
road, or if the car is wrecked, it will
be towed to the station.
This service has been established
all over the northern part of the state
and the present plans are to extend
it still farther. The Automobile Asso
ciation claims that it is the first in the
West to provide lis members with a
combined mechanical and first aid
towing service.
