# Art Gallery Shows Wood Block Prints Of Mexican Views
## 
### 
"One of the best collections of wood
blocks ever shown at Stanford lias just
been placed on display," says John T.
Lemos, of the Art Gallery. The prints
are the work of Gustave Baumann, of
Santa Fe, New Mexico, who is recog
nized as one of the foremost wood
block artists of America."
The prints show views found in New
Mexico and in the surrounding coun
try. They are particularly rich in
varying color schemes, and the artist's
technique shows a master handling of
his medium, especially in many of the
detailed parts.
Wood blocks come under the main
subject of prints, and are the indi
vidual work of the artist. Each main
color in a print must be cut from a
separate block of wood.
Colors Are Superimposed
These are then superimposed one
over another, and the completed color
effect obtained. This work requires a
line knowledge of color schemes and
of printing processes. In some cases
six or seven blocks have been cut to
produce the desired effect.
While the art of wood block is only
now becoming popular, Baumann has
always been interested in this work.
He has illustrated many books entire
ly with wood blocks, and in many
cases of short poems cutting the let
tering in wood also.
Baumann has won many awards.
One of them was the Gold Medal for
prints, at the Panama Pacific Exposi
tion.
