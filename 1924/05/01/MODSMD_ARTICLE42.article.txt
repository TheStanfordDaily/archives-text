# FORENSIC SPEECHES TO BE PUBLISHED IN DEBATE ANNUAL
## 
### 
Speeches of the varsity debate team
delivered in the Tri-Debate with Cali
fornia and Southern California last
winter are to be published in the De
bater's Annual for 1923-24.
The Annual is published by the H.
W. Wilson Company and is edited by
Edith M. Phelps. Each year ten repre
sentative debates throughout the
United States are selected. The books
have received wide circulation and
are to be found in most of the college
and university libraries.
It is the aim of the publishers to
select good examples of technical art
from the purely argumentative stand- !
point, and also to publish discussions
on questions that are popular and
under consideration. The Stanford
speeches are on the subject of "The
California Criminal Syndicalism Law,"
the law which makes criminal the ad- i
vocacy of revolution.
It is thought probable that the
speeches delivered by both the Cali

fornia and the Stanford men in the
Joffre debate will also be published.
Phonographic and stenographic copies
of the addresses were taken at the
time and are available for use. Negoti
ations for these are still in stage of
development.
Several Stanford teams have had
their speeches published in past
years, the last ones to appear being
in 1921.
The Tri-Debate men whose work
will be presented are: Thomas A.
Bailey, Stanley A. Weigel, Bertram W.
Levit, and Robert Littler.
