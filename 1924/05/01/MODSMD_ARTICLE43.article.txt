# U. OF O. OBJECTS TO GREEK LETTER SOCIETIES IN SCHOOLS
## 
### 
As an outgrowth of the recent con
troversy in Portland over the exis
tence of Greek letter societies in the
high schools there the Oregon Uni
versity interfraternity council has
started action to curtail the activities
of such groups.
In a general discussion before the
council last night it was disclosed
that on the whole fraternity men on
the campus are opposed to the activi
ties of the so-called high school fra
ternities.
