# DEAN YOST RETURNS FROM SOUTHERN TRIP
## Finds Prospective Women Students Well Trained By High Schools 
### 
"Does Stanford give enough re
sponsibility to her freshman women?"
questioned Dean Yost, after her re
turn yesterday from her visit to Soutli
ern California, where she interviewed
women applicants for entrance to the
University.
"I was particularly impressed with
what the high schools are doing for
the students and for the high schools,"
she said. "For example, the president
of the Girls' Senior Board at the Los
Angeles high school arranged a pro
gram, which worked with perfect
smoothness, by which 1 was able to
interview all the students who came
to see me. Perhaps we should give
these highly-trained freshmen more to
do when they come to college."
Attended Conference at Tucson
Miss Yost has been absent from the
campus for three weeks. The primary
object of her trip was the Western
Conference of Deans of Women and
Associated Women Students, held at
the University of Arizona, Tuscon,
April 9 to 11.
The purpose of the visit to Los
Angeles and Southern California was
two-fold. Miss Yost wished to meet
the high school principals, vice-prin
cipals, and teachers who recommend
ed women students for entrance to
Stanford, thus establishing a personal
relation between the schools and the
University. She also desired to meet
the women who are applying, and had
an individual interview with each ap
plicant. Miss Yost hopes that this
information may prove helpful to the
committee on entrances.
"I received the most cordial co
operation in Los Angeles," she said.
"Those in charge went out of their
way to make it possible for me to see
all the students who wished to come
to Stanford. Los Angeles high school
invited all the vice-principals in the
city to come there, bringing their ap
plicants, and we talked over the whole
problem together. This plan was a
great time-saver."
Miss Yost visited a number of
southern high schools: Pasadena,
South Pasadena, and Los Angeles. She
also went to two private schools in
Los Angeles, Marlborough and Colle
giate.
