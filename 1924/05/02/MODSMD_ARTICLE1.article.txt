Delegates Welcomed
Welcoming addresses by President
Wilbur and A1 Masters opened the
assembly, the first event on the con

new responsibilities of the newspaper
make necessary a high sense of pro

our schools and colleges can aid in
training journalists of a better type,

Masters welcomed the delegates on
behalf of the student body, lauding
