# SIGMA NU DEFEATS SIGMA CHI NINE IN INTRAMURAL CLASH
## Phi Psi and Sequoia Second Default to Phi Sigma Kappa, El Campo 
### 
Good fielding enabled Sigma Nu to
down Silgma Chi 6 to 5 in the only
intramural game played yesterday. In
the other scheduled contests Phi
Kappa Psi and Sequoia Second de
faulted to Phi Sigma Kappa and El
Campo respectively. Encina First and
Sigma Alpha Epsilon agreed to post
pone their tilt until today.
Campbell, on the mound for Sigma
Chi, was* not hit as hard as Aydelott,
the Sigma Nu heaver, but his support
was a trifle ragged. The Sigma Nu's
were fast and accurate in the field and
by bunching their hits garnered
enough runs to win.
They went after Campbell with a
vengeance in the opening frame, driv
ing in three tallies and holding their
opponents scoreless. One more run
was chalked up fqr them in the second,
but the Sigma Chi's countered with
two markers.
Aydelott Wins Own Game
Aydelott won his own game in the
fifth by crashing out a three-bagger
with a man on base. He himself was
brought in by a single a moment later.
Sigma Chi came to life in their half
of the inning and one man crossed
the plate. They added two more in the
sixth but lacked the punch to tie the
count.
After defaulting to El Campo be
cause of having only eight players,
Sequoia Second inserted Sequoia First
men in their line-up and staged a prac-1
tice game with the club men which
resulted in a 14 to 12 victory for El
Campo.
Smith, twirling for the eating club,
struck out five men, allowed but eight
hits, and knocked two home runs. His
teammates found Wells and Brazil,
Sequoia chuckers, for nineteen bingles.
Monday's games: Theta Chi vs. Chi
