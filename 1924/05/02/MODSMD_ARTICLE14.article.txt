# CONVENTION SPIRIT, EXCHANGE OF IDEAS AIMS OF CONCLAVE
## Gathering Will Be First of Kind Tried in State Of California 
### Carl Shoup 
President of Sigma Delta Clii
In bringing together high school edi
tors, business managers, and faculty
advisers in journalism from all over
the state, we hope to accomplish in
the main two things which should
have a direct bearing on improving
high school journalism.
First, we hope that the convention
spirit—the sense of being part of a
large group—will permeate the dele
gates of the individual schools to such
an extent that they will return feeling
that their school and their publica
tions are not isolated, but an integral
part of the high school journalism of
this state.
Exchange of Ideas
Second, we hope that by practical
talks and discussions ideas may be
broached and exchanged to such an
extent that the standard of each paper
will be raised in all of its depart
ments; so that, irrespective of what
goes 011 elsewhere, each school will
feel that its own paper is on the up
grade constantly.
Is First Convention
This convention, so far as we know,
is the first of its kind to be held in
the state, covering, as it does, all of
California, and including in its dele
gates editors and managers of both
newspapers and annuals, and faculty
advisers in journalism. Being the first
of its kind, then, much of its worth
in the future as something to refer to
when seeking a sense of unity and co
operation, will depend upon the spirit
shown by those present at its meet
ings. From the letters we have re
ceived, we feel sure that there will be
enough earnest desire to accomplish
something definite in the convention,
to make it worth while in the strictest
sense of the word.
Room for Improvement
There can be little doubt but that
there is great room for improvement
in high school journalism at the pres
ent time —and, from current comment,
that need for a journalistic forward
march is not confined to the high
schools. Attacks upon the press all
over the country are becoming more
and more frequent, especially as the
tendency to combine a large amount |
of power in the hands of a few pub
lishers becomes alarmingly noticeable. !
It seems logical that the place to at
tack evils in journalism is where the
disadvantageous habits have not yet
had a chance to become firmly fixed —!
namely, in the high schools and uni- (
versities. This involves the question!
of ethics, which may seem to some I
high schools rather vague and unim
portant; but the good or evil that aj
school paper can do is realized by us
all when we take time to think about
it. The high school whose paper or
annual is not published for the benefit
of the school as a whole is evidently
greatly handicapped in advancing
along any lines.
Question of Mechanics
Probably, however, the every-day
question of mechanics in operating aj
paper is of more importance to high
schools than the question of ethics.
Problems of copy, make-up, selection
of editor and manager, and, above all
perhaps, financing, are causing much
worry.
These problems can beat be settled i
by discussion among the delegates
themselves. It is for this reason that
we are devoting a large part of the
convention to round table talks. These
group discussions will be led by men
and women active in journalism either
in the professional field or in the Uni
versity; but it is essential that the
delegates themselves broach the ques
tions to be discussed, give their own
ideas on the subjects, and take a very
active part in the talks. The main pur
pose of the leaders will be to draw
forth discussions and attempt to an
swer questions in their particular
field. It is on these round table dis
cussions that a large part of the suc
cess of the convention hinges; and
whether or not they fulfill their pur- j
pose will depend on the extent to
which the delegates enter into the,
spirit of the talks. The importance of |
"opening up" and exchanging ideas;
can hardly be overestimated.
Statistics of Convention
The statistics of the convention are
approximately as follows: 55 high'
schools, represented by 175 delegates.
From the way in which responses
came in during the last three weeks,
it is doubtless true that there are
many high schools that did not answer
our first invitations that would be glad
to attend the convention; and our only
regret is that we could not urge them j
to attend at the last minute. However, i
as this is a first attempt, we believed j
it best to limit the attendance to,
those who signed up some time in I
advance.
As to whether or not there will be a
similar convention again in the near
future —that depends largely on the
measure of success achieved at this
time. If the high schools deem it
worth while to gather once a year,,
and express that opinion, there is no
reason why this year's gathering
should not be repeated.
Measure of Success
One measure of what this year's
convention has done will be seen in
the improvement the school publica
tions show during the coming year. If j

they exhibit a marked improvement,
we shall know that the work will not
have been in vain; if they do not, we
shall be forced to the conclusion that
a journalism convention is not worth
the effort it entails. We are con
vinced, however, that a state-wide con
vention is bound to be productive of
good results; and shall be much sur
prised if it turns out otherwise. Con
ventions can degenerate into mere
useless tangles where everything is
tried and nothing done; but when
delegates come, some of them from
long distances, with a serious purpose
in mind, such degeneration is extreme
ly unlikely.
Service Throughout Year
Another word, not directly con
nected with the convention, is in
order: Stanford Chapter of Sigma
Delta Chi wishes all the visiting dele
gates to know that it offers its ser
vices throughout the entire year as a
species of "service department," to
which any high school publication in
the state is urged to send letters and
publications discussing their problems
and asking for any assistance we may
give. The reason for this offer is that
Sigma Delta Chi, as a professional—
not an honorary—journalism society,
is interested especially in improving
the quality and quantity of high school
journalism. The life of the society de
pends upon its activity; and if we can
be of help to high school papers by
instituting this all-year 'round "cor
respondence service," we wish to fol
low that line of work. Therefore, it is
urged that during the next year all
the high schools keep in touch with
us and discuss freely the problems
confronting them.'Perhaps we may be

able to be of help.
The convention is here, and what
is to be achieved depends on the co
operation of all of us. Stanford bids
the delegates a hearty welcome, and 1
hopes to see them many more times.

reason why this year's gathering
should not be repeated.
Measure of Success
One measure of what this year's
convention has done will be seen in
the improvement the school publica
tions show during the coming year. If j

they exhibit a marked improvement,
we shall know that the work will not
have been in vain; if they do not, we
shall be forced to the conclusion that
a journalism convention is not worth
the effort it entails. We are con
vinced, however, that a state-wide con
vention is bound to be productive of
good results; and shall be much sur
prised if it turns out otherwise. Con
ventions can degenerate into mere
useless tangles where everything is
tried and nothing done; but when
delegates come, some of them from
long distances, with a serious purpose
in mind, such degeneration is extreme
ly unlikely.
Service Throughout Year
Another word, not directly con
nected with the convention, is in
order: Stanford Chapter of Sigma
Delta Chi wishes all the visiting dele
gates to know that it offers its ser
vices throughout the entire year as a
species of "service department," to
which any high school publication in
the state is urged to send letters and
publications discussing their problems
and asking for any assistance we may
give. The reason for this offer is that
Sigma Delta Chi, as a professional—
not an honorary—journalism society,
is interested especially in improving
the quality and quantity of high school
journalism. The life of the society de
pends upon its activity; and if we can
be of help to high school papers by
instituting this all-year 'round "cor
respondence service," we wish to fol
low that line of work. Therefore, it is
urged that during the next year all
the high schools keep in touch with
us and discuss freely the problems
confronting them.'Perhaps we may be

able to be of help.
The convention is here, and what
is to be achieved depends on the co
operation of all of us. Stanford bids
the delegates a hearty welcome, and 1
hopes to see them many more times.
President of Sigma Delta Clii
In bringing together high school edi
tors, business managers, and faculty
advisers in journalism from all over
the state, we hope to accomplish in
the main two things which should
have a direct bearing on improving
high school journalism.
First, we hope that the convention
spirit—the sense of being part of a
large group—will permeate the dele
gates of the individual schools to such
an extent that they will return feeling
that their school and their publica
tions are not isolated, but an integral
part of the high school journalism of
this state.
Exchange of Ideas
Second, we hope that by practical
talks and discussions ideas may be
broached and exchanged to such an
extent that the standard of each paper
will be raised in all of its depart
ments; so that, irrespective of what
goes 011 elsewhere, each school will
feel that its own paper is on the up
grade constantly.
Is First Convention
This convention, so far as we know,
is the first of its kind to be held in
the state, covering, as it does, all of
California, and including in its dele
gates editors and managers of both
newspapers and annuals, and faculty
advisers in journalism. Being the first
of its kind, then, much of its worth
in the future as something to refer to
when seeking a sense of unity and co
operation, will depend upon the spirit
shown by those present at its meet
ings. From the letters we have re
ceived, we feel sure that there will be
enough earnest desire to accomplish
something definite in the convention,
to make it worth while in the strictest
sense of the word.
Room for Improvement
There can be little doubt but that
there is great room for improvement
in high school journalism at the pres
ent time —and, from current comment,
that need for a journalistic forward
march is not confined to the high
schools. Attacks upon the press all
over the country are becoming more
and more frequent, especially as the
tendency to combine a large amount |
of power in the hands of a few pub
lishers becomes alarmingly noticeable. !
It seems logical that the place to at
tack evils in journalism is where the
disadvantageous habits have not yet
had a chance to become firmly fixed —!
namely, in the high schools and uni- (
versities. This involves the question!
of ethics, which may seem to some I
high schools rather vague and unim
portant; but the good or evil that aj
school paper can do is realized by us
all when we take time to think about
it. The high school whose paper or
annual is not published for the benefit
of the school as a whole is evidently
greatly handicapped in advancing
along any lines.
Question of Mechanics
Probably, however, the every-day
question of mechanics in operating aj
paper is of more importance to high
schools than the question of ethics.
Problems of copy, make-up, selection
of editor and manager, and, above all
perhaps, financing, are causing much
worry.
These problems can beat be settled i
by discussion among the delegates
themselves. It is for this reason that
we are devoting a large part of the
convention to round table talks. These
group discussions will be led by men
and women active in journalism either
in the professional field or in the Uni
versity; but it is essential that the
delegates themselves broach the ques
tions to be discussed, give their own
ideas on the subjects, and take a very
active part in the talks. The main pur
pose of the leaders will be to draw
forth discussions and attempt to an
swer questions in their particular
field. It is on these round table dis
cussions that a large part of the suc
cess of the convention hinges; and
whether or not they fulfill their pur- j
pose will depend on the extent to
which the delegates enter into the,
spirit of the talks. The importance of |
"opening up" and exchanging ideas;
can hardly be overestimated.
Statistics of Convention
The statistics of the convention are
approximately as follows: 55 high'
schools, represented by 175 delegates.
From the way in which responses
came in during the last three weeks,
it is doubtless true that there are
many high schools that did not answer
our first invitations that would be glad
to attend the convention; and our only
regret is that we could not urge them j
to attend at the last minute. However, i
as this is a first attempt, we believed j
it best to limit the attendance to,
those who signed up some time in I
advance.
As to whether or not there will be a
similar convention again in the near
future —that depends largely on the
measure of success achieved at this
time. If the high schools deem it
worth while to gather once a year,,
and express that opinion, there is no
reason why this year's gathering
should not be repeated.

paper is of more importance to high
schools than the question of ethics.
Problems of copy, make-up, selection
of editor and manager, and, above all
perhaps, financing, are causing much
worry.
These problems can beat be settled i
by discussion among the delegates
themselves. It is for this reason that
we are devoting a large part of the
convention to round table talks. These
group discussions will be led by men
and women active in journalism either
in the professional field or in the Uni
versity; but it is essential that the
delegates themselves broach the ques
tions to be discussed, give their own
ideas on the subjects, and take a very
active part in the talks. The main pur
pose of the leaders will be to draw
forth discussions and attempt to an
swer questions in their particular
field. It is on these round table dis
cussions that a large part of the suc
cess of the convention hinges; and
whether or not they fulfill their pur- j
pose will depend on the extent to
which the delegates enter into the,
spirit of the talks. The importance of |
"opening up" and exchanging ideas;
can hardly be overestimated.
Statistics of Convention
The statistics of the convention are
approximately as follows: 55 high'
schools, represented by 175 delegates.
From the way in which responses
came in during the last three weeks,
it is doubtless true that there are
many high schools that did not answer
our first invitations that would be glad
to attend the convention; and our only
regret is that we could not urge them j
to attend at the last minute. However, i
as this is a first attempt, we believed j
it best to limit the attendance to,
those who signed up some time in I
advance.
As to whether or not there will be a
similar convention again in the near
future —that depends largely on the
measure of success achieved at this
time. If the high schools deem it
worth while to gather once a year,,
and express that opinion, there is no
reason why this year's gathering
should not be repeated.
Measure of Success
One measure of what this year's
convention has done will be seen in
the improvement the school publica
tions show during the coming year. If j

they exhibit a marked improvement,
we shall know that the work will not
have been in vain; if they do not, we
shall be forced to the conclusion that
a journalism convention is not worth
the effort it entails. We are con
vinced, however, that a state-wide con
vention is bound to be productive of
good results; and shall be much sur
prised if it turns out otherwise. Con
ventions can degenerate into mere
useless tangles where everything is
tried and nothing done; but when
delegates come, some of them from
long distances, with a serious purpose
in mind, such degeneration is extreme
ly unlikely.
Service Throughout Year
Another word, not directly con
nected with the convention, is in
order: Stanford Chapter of Sigma
Delta Chi wishes all the visiting dele
gates to know that it offers its ser
vices throughout the entire year as a
species of "service department," to
which any high school publication in
the state is urged to send letters and
publications discussing their problems
and asking for any assistance we may
give. The reason for this offer is that
Sigma Delta Chi, as a professional—
not an honorary—journalism society,
is interested especially in improving
the quality and quantity of high school
journalism. The life of the society de
pends upon its activity; and if we can
be of help to high school papers by
instituting this all-year 'round "cor
respondence service," we wish to fol
low that line of work. Therefore, it is
urged that during the next year all
the high schools keep in touch with
us and discuss freely the problems
confronting them.'Perhaps we may be

able to be of help.
The convention is here, and what
is to be achieved depends on the co
operation of all of us. Stanford bids
the delegates a hearty welcome, and 1
hopes to see them many more times.
President of Sigma Delta Clii
In bringing together high school edi
tors, business managers, and faculty
advisers in journalism from all over
the state, we hope to accomplish in
the main two things which should
have a direct bearing on improving
high school journalism.
First, we hope that the convention
spirit—the sense of being part of a
large group—will permeate the dele
gates of the individual schools to such
an extent that they will return feeling
that their school and their publica
tions are not isolated, but an integral
part of the high school journalism of
this state.
Exchange of Ideas
Second, we hope that by practical
talks and discussions ideas may be
broached and exchanged to such an
extent that the standard of each paper
will be raised in all of its depart
ments; so that, irrespective of what
goes 011 elsewhere, each school will
feel that its own paper is on the up
grade constantly.
Is First Convention
This convention, so far as we know,
is the first of its kind to be held in
the state, covering, as it does, all of
California, and including in its dele
gates editors and managers of both
newspapers and annuals, and faculty
advisers in journalism. Being the first
of its kind, then, much of its worth
in the future as something to refer to
when seeking a sense of unity and co
operation, will depend upon the spirit
shown by those present at its meet
ings. From the letters we have re
ceived, we feel sure that there will be
enough earnest desire to accomplish
something definite in the convention,
to make it worth while in the strictest
sense of the word.
Room for Improvement
There can be little doubt but that
there is great room for improvement
in high school journalism at the pres
ent time —and, from current comment,
that need for a journalistic forward
march is not confined to the high
schools. Attacks upon the press all
over the country are becoming more
and more frequent, especially as the
tendency to combine a large amount |
of power in the hands of a few pub
lishers becomes alarmingly noticeable. !
It seems logical that the place to at
tack evils in journalism is where the
disadvantageous habits have not yet
had a chance to become firmly fixed —!
namely, in the high schools and uni- (
versities. This involves the question!
of ethics, which may seem to some I
high schools rather vague and unim
portant; but the good or evil that aj
school paper can do is realized by us
all when we take time to think about
it. The high school whose paper or
annual is not published for the benefit
of the school as a whole is evidently
greatly handicapped in advancing
along any lines.
Question of Mechanics
Probably, however, the every-day
question of mechanics in operating aj
paper is of more importance to high
schools than the question of ethics.

goes 011 elsewhere, each school will
feel that its own paper is on the up
grade constantly.
Is First Convention
This convention, so far as we know,
is the first of its kind to be held in
the state, covering, as it does, all of
California, and including in its dele
gates editors and managers of both
newspapers and annuals, and faculty
advisers in journalism. Being the first
of its kind, then, much of its worth
in the future as something to refer to
when seeking a sense of unity and co
operation, will depend upon the spirit
shown by those present at its meet
ings. From the letters we have re
ceived, we feel sure that there will be
enough earnest desire to accomplish
something definite in the convention,
to make it worth while in the strictest
sense of the word.
Room for Improvement
There can be little doubt but that
there is great room for improvement
in high school journalism at the pres
ent time —and, from current comment,
that need for a journalistic forward
march is not confined to the high
schools. Attacks upon the press all
over the country are becoming more
and more frequent, especially as the
tendency to combine a large amount |
of power in the hands of a few pub
lishers becomes alarmingly noticeable. !
It seems logical that the place to at
tack evils in journalism is where the
disadvantageous habits have not yet
had a chance to become firmly fixed —!
namely, in the high schools and uni- (
versities. This involves the question!
of ethics, which may seem to some I
high schools rather vague and unim
portant; but the good or evil that aj
school paper can do is realized by us
all when we take time to think about
it. The high school whose paper or
annual is not published for the benefit
of the school as a whole is evidently
greatly handicapped in advancing
along any lines.
Question of Mechanics
Probably, however, the every-day
question of mechanics in operating aj
paper is of more importance to high
schools than the question of ethics.
Problems of copy, make-up, selection
of editor and manager, and, above all
perhaps, financing, are causing much
worry.
These problems can beat be settled i
by discussion among the delegates
themselves. It is for this reason that
we are devoting a large part of the
convention to round table talks. These
group discussions will be led by men
and women active in journalism either
in the professional field or in the Uni
versity; but it is essential that the
delegates themselves broach the ques
tions to be discussed, give their own
ideas on the subjects, and take a very
active part in the talks. The main pur
pose of the leaders will be to draw
forth discussions and attempt to an
swer questions in their particular
field. It is on these round table dis
cussions that a large part of the suc
cess of the convention hinges; and
whether or not they fulfill their pur- j
pose will depend on the extent to
which the delegates enter into the,
spirit of the talks. The importance of |
"opening up" and exchanging ideas;
can hardly be overestimated.
Statistics of Convention
The statistics of the convention are
approximately as follows: 55 high'
schools, represented by 175 delegates.
From the way in which responses
came in during the last three weeks,
it is doubtless true that there are
many high schools that did not answer
our first invitations that would be glad
to attend the convention; and our only
regret is that we could not urge them j
to attend at the last minute. However, i
as this is a first attempt, we believed j
it best to limit the attendance to,
those who signed up some time in I
advance.
As to whether or not there will be a
similar convention again in the near
future —that depends largely on the
measure of success achieved at this
time. If the high schools deem it
worth while to gather once a year,,
and express that opinion, there is no
reason why this year's gathering
should not be repeated.
Measure of Success
One measure of what this year's
convention has done will be seen in
the improvement the school publica
tions show during the coming year. If j

they exhibit a marked improvement,
we shall know that the work will not
have been in vain; if they do not, we
shall be forced to the conclusion that
a journalism convention is not worth
the effort it entails. We are con
vinced, however, that a state-wide con
vention is bound to be productive of
good results; and shall be much sur
prised if it turns out otherwise. Con
ventions can degenerate into mere
useless tangles where everything is
tried and nothing done; but when
delegates come, some of them from
long distances, with a serious purpose
in mind, such degeneration is extreme
ly unlikely.
Service Throughout Year
Another word, not directly con
nected with the convention, is in
order: Stanford Chapter of Sigma
Delta Chi wishes all the visiting dele
gates to know that it offers its ser
vices throughout the entire year as a
species of "service department," to
which any high school publication in
the state is urged to send letters and
publications discussing their problems
and asking for any assistance we may
give. The reason for this offer is that
Sigma Delta Chi, as a professional—
not an honorary—journalism society,
is interested especially in improving
the quality and quantity of high school
journalism. The life of the society de
pends upon its activity; and if we can
be of help to high school papers by
instituting this all-year 'round "cor
respondence service," we wish to fol
low that line of work. Therefore, it is
urged that during the next year all
the high schools keep in touch with
us and discuss freely the problems
confronting them.'Perhaps we may be

able to be of help.
The convention is here, and what
is to be achieved depends on the co
operation of all of us. Stanford bids
the delegates a hearty welcome, and 1
hopes to see them many more times.
