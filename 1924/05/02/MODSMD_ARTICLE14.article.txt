# CONVENTION SPIRIT, EXCHANGE OF IDEAS AIMS OF CONCLAVE
## Gathering Will Be First of Kind Tried in State Of California 
### Carl Shoup

In bringing together high school edi
tors, business managers, and faculty
advisers in journalism from all over
the state, we hope to accomplish in
the main two things which should
have a direct bearing on improving
high school journalism.
First, we hope that the convention
spirit—the sense of being part of a
large group—will permeate the dele
gates of the individual schools to such
an extent that they will return feeling
that their school and their publica
tions are not isolated, but an integral
part of the high school journalism of
this state.
Exchange of Ideas
Second, we hope that by practical
talks and discussions ideas may be
broached and exchanged to such an
extent that the standard of each paper
will be raised in all of its depart
ments; so that, irrespective of what
goes 011 elsewhere, each school will
feel that its own paper is on the up
grade constantly.
Is First Convention
This convention, so far as we know,
is the first of its kind to be held in
the state, covering, as it does, all of
California, and including in its dele
gates editors and managers of both
newspapers and annuals, and faculty
advisers in journalism. Being the first
of its kind, then, much of its worth
in the future as something to refer to
when seeking a sense of unity and co
operation, will depend upon the spirit
shown by those present at its meet
ings. From the letters we have re
ceived, we feel sure that there will be
enough earnest desire to accomplish
something definite in the convention,
