### Ross Urquhart 
Seats in the orchestra pit should
be selling at double premium when
the Junior Opera seat sale opens up
Tuesday afternoon, May 6, if news
about the chorus costumes leaks out.
The three brothers, romance, mys
tery, and intrigue, faded into the night
outside the stage door when the cast
lined up last night to have pictures
*
taken. Fixed smiles were the order
of the evening. "Hock" Chalmers was
(here, dressed as a country deacon,
and the fixed smiles changed many
times.
Chorus Is Photographed
The pony chorus* flounced out bash
fully in their "joy" costumes —the first
six rows were spoken for. The next
four sold out when they appeared in
their hula costumes, which will be
used in the second act.
The beauty chorus, all dressed up
in evening gowns, assumed the fixed
smile and waited for the little white

rabbit. "Hock" spoke. The picture had
to be taken over again. Posing with
them was the men's chorus, looking
very classy in their tuxedos.
Aileen Burks Is Fiery Spaniard
Aileen Burks wore a stunning Span
ish costume. Those who remember her
in "Captain Applejack" will look for
ward to seeing her portray the fiery
Spanish type again. Lloyd Nolan, as
a greasy Spaniard in blue pants and
bare feet, clutched the hand that held
the glittering knife —in the picture.
A white evening gown will be worn
by Marjorie Allen in the first act and
something less formal on the rum
smuggling island. Lew Forrest will
help the play along in evening clothes.
Charles Simons, of Swedish-maid
fame in the Merchant of Menace, will
wear something absolutely new. He
has been understudying John Harry
more in Sherlock Holmes for days now
and should be able to give any inter
esting impersonation.
