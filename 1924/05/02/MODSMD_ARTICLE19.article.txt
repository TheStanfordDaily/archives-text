# Welcome, High School Journalists!
## 
### 
The Daily Palo Alto takes great pleasure in welcoming the*delegation
of high school journalists to the Stanford campus. The university as a
whole, and every one concerned with it is glad of the opportunity to meet
those who are doing such an important work in the high schools of Cali
fornia.
From the delegates who will attend the two-day convention will prob
ably come future Stanford journalists, and many who will carry on jour
nalistic work in the world of tomorrow. Those who are here to represent
their schools should feel honored. They are accomplishing a great work
and can gain much by getting together to discuss their common problems
and to hear the advice of those who have had more experience.
The statewide convention, which is the first of its kind to be tried in
California, will undoubtedly prove of mutual benefit to both those who at
tend and to Stanford. The program whicti lias been arranged is not the
old time-worn system of keeping the delegates penned up to listen to dry
speakers who expound fine sounding theories. Rather it is a well-balanced
affair, including in it, discussion by recognized authorities of actual prob
lems which every journalist must face and solve.
In this way, the delegates will be able to leave with the knowledge that
they received something of real benefit. As far as the University is con
cerned, it is a great credit to her to have such a fine group of high school
leaders here.
Those who are responsible for bringing the convention to the Farm
deserve a great deal of credit. The arrangements which have been an
nounced are ample proof of the fact that the committees have worked very
hard. Sigma Delta Chi, men's professional journalistic fraternity, is re
sponsible for originating the idea of the conclave.
With the kind assistance of merchants of Palo Alto and various student
organizations and publications, it has been possible to award trophies for
the best high school publications. Those who receive the awards are to be
commended upon the type of papers they are publishing. Those who do
not receive prizes need not feel discouraged for there will undoubtedly be
other conventions and they will have opportunities to make improvements.
THE DAILY PALO ALTO EXTENDS ON BEHALF OF THE
ENTIRE STUDENT BODY AND FACULTY, A HAND OF WEL
COME TO YOU. HIGH SCHOOL JOURNALISTS. WE ARE
MIGHTY GLAD TO HAVE YOU WITH US. WE SINCERELY
HOPE THAT YOUR STAY WILL BE A PLEASANT ONE.
