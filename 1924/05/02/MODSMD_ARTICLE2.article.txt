# Scribes and Ink Slingers Play Second Game Sunday
## 
### 
On Sunday the front-room pen-push
ers will bestir themselves the morning
after the night before and once more
give battle to the hefty back-room
gang.
This is the second game of the
aeries and will be played at ten o'clock
Sunday morning. The lineup will be
more or less the same as previously
and confidence rests serene on the
brows of all. May the best side win.
