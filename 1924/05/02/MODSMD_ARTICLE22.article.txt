# Cupid Rampages; Knocks Out Four All in Same Room
## 
### 
Someone made a mistake when he
placed "231" on a certain door in the
New Union. It should have been "213."
Anyway, Cupid is all enthusiastic
and is beaming like a child over his
recent miraculous successes, for in
less than six weeks he has shot no
less than four arrows at the inmates
of 231, and all have been true.
Call it a jinx or not, but betrothals
seem to be contagious. Today, there
comes the announcement of the en
gagement of Milo E. Rowell, '24, to
Miss Marie Jeannette Sessions of San
Francisco —No. 4 in 231.
Dan Evans Instigator
Daniel W. Evans, '20, started the
fireworks when it was announced last
spring vacation that he was engaged
to Miss Ellowene Delahoyde, '24. Then
along came the second musketeer,
Dana Burks, '18, who became be
trothed to Miss Ruth Crutcher, '18.
By this time, Cupid was bubbling
over with enthusiasm and eagerness,
so he took another arrow from his
quiver, and with careful aim, let fly
the dart. And then kerflump, the be
trothal of Andrew R. Boone, '23, and
Edythe G. Baylis, '24, was made
known. Now the Rowell-Sessions en
gagement.
Nuptial Dates Announced
Evans and Miss Delahoyde will be
married later this year, while the nup
tial ceremony of Burks and Miss
Crutcher is announced for September.
The other two couples have not as yet
decided on the dates of their mar
riages.
Of the four Stanford men, three
hang around the Law department and
one is a chemistry fiend.
Oh yes, there's another suite-mate
still in 231 who hasn't startled the
world as yet with any such announce
ment. He is also a lawyer and his
name as it appears in the "Bawl-out,"
is Philip Grey Smith. According to
an authoritative statement, he "is now
available."
