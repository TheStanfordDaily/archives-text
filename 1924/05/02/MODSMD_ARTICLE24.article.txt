# 50 SCHOOLS SUBMIT PAPERS, ANNUALS IN AWARDS CONTEST
## 
### Bradley Riter 
Awards Committee Chairman
If the number of papers and annuals
submitted by high schools in the award
contest is a good omen, then the first
state-wide convention of high school edi
tors and business managers which opened
today at Stanford, bids well to be a com
mendable and overwhelming success.
Papers and annuals from more than
fifty schools from Chico in the north to
Calexico in the south were sent in, and
it has been a merry scramble pouring
over them to select the winners. The
selection has finally been made, but the
prize-winners will not be disclosed until
the final session of the convention tomor
row afternoon.
Divided Into Three Classes
In order to distribute the prizes and
allow a fairer basis for the awards, the
papers were divided into three classes:
Those published in schools of 1,000 at
tendance or over, those of schools having
an attendance under 1,000, and mimeo
graphed enterprizes. By successive "cuts,"
the number in each division was nar
rowed down to six or eight, from which
final selections were made. At first, sec-,
ond, and third were chosen in each in
stance, and in some cases when the com
petition was exceedingly keen, honorary
mentions were made.
"Make-up", proper placing of news
stories, features, feature departments,
"leads," and the general calibre and tone
of the stories, were all considered in
awarding the prizes. With regard to the
annuals, organization, design, the quality
of writing, and especially originality were
stressed.
In addition to these prizes, awards were
also made for the best editorial, news
story, make-up, feature story, humor
column, short story appearing in an an
nual, and the best advertisement from the
standpoint of originality.
Wealth of Editorials
In selecting the best editorial, emphasis'
was placed on the literary ability of the
writer, which included the quality of his
writing, tact, his breadth of thought
and vision, and whether or not he was
successful in getting the editorial "across"
in a pleasing manner and in a way so
that it scored anl left an impression upon
the reader.
Something similar may be said in the
selection of the best news story, although
leads and organization of the story were
considered the most important.
Two "make-ups" which are generally
considered the best are the "balanced"
and the "sliding" or "step" arrangement.
The balanced seemed to be predominant,
and the award was finally given a paper
which had an almost perfect one.
There is nothing which brightens up a
paper more and makes it interesting and
readable than short, clcvcr feature stories
—they help to relieve the heavy, some
what sombre news of the day. One school
was noteworthy for the quality of these
features, and there was no question in the
minds of the judges as to which of the
contestants deserved the prize.
Most Humor Not Original
The trouble with most of the humor
columns in the several papers was that
the humor was not original. It was a
"colyum" of original, short, snappy stuff,
compelling laughs, which came out on top
and received the award.
A startling and somewhat interesting
best short story appearing in an annual—
fact was brought to light in choosing the
that the high school mind in a majority
of cases, has a strong tendency toward
the weird and gruesome —murder, blood
curdling stuff; and some of the stories
were exceptionally well handled. Origin
ality and literary ability of course counted
most in the award in this case.
Neatness of design and appearance,
language, and impressiveness were con
sidered in choosing the prize-winning ad
vertisement.
All in all, the contest was keen through
out, and there were several papers which
in nearly every instance which survived
until the final slash, only failing then
because they lacked a certain degree of
finish and polish.

ond, and third were chosen in each in
stance, and in some cases when the com
petition was exceedingly keen, honorary
mentions were made.
"Make-up", proper placing of news
stories, features, feature departments,
"leads," and the general calibre and tone
of the stories, were all considered in
awarding the prizes. With regard to the
annuals, organization, design, the quality
of writing, and especially originality were
stressed.
In addition to these prizes, awards were
also made for the best editorial, news
story, make-up, feature story, humor
column, short story appearing in an an
nual, and the best advertisement from the
standpoint of originality.
Wealth of Editorials
In selecting the best editorial, emphasis'
was placed on the literary ability of the
writer, which included the quality of his
writing, tact, his breadth of thought
and vision, and whether or not he was
successful in getting the editorial "across"
in a pleasing manner and in a way so
that it scored anl left an impression upon
the reader.
Something similar may be said in the
selection of the best news story, although
leads and organization of the story were
considered the most important.
Two "make-ups" which are generally
considered the best are the "balanced"
and the "sliding" or "step" arrangement.
The balanced seemed to be predominant,
and the award was finally given a paper
which had an almost perfect one.
There is nothing which brightens up a
paper more and makes it interesting and
readable than short, clcvcr feature stories
—they help to relieve the heavy, some
what sombre news of the day. One school
was noteworthy for the quality of these
features, and there was no question in the
minds of the judges as to which of the
contestants deserved the prize.
Most Humor Not Original
The trouble with most of the humor
columns in the several papers was that
the humor was not original. It was a
"colyum" of original, short, snappy stuff,
compelling laughs, which came out on top
and received the award.
A startling and somewhat interesting
best short story appearing in an annual—
fact was brought to light in choosing the
that the high school mind in a majority
of cases, has a strong tendency toward
the weird and gruesome —murder, blood
curdling stuff; and some of the stories
were exceptionally well handled. Origin
ality and literary ability of course counted
most in the award in this case.
Neatness of design and appearance,
language, and impressiveness were con
sidered in choosing the prize-winning ad
vertisement.
All in all, the contest was keen through
out, and there were several papers which
in nearly every instance which survived
until the final slash, only failing then
because they lacked a certain degree of
finish and polish.
Awards Committee Chairman
If the number of papers and annuals
submitted by high schools in the award
contest is a good omen, then the first
state-wide convention of high school edi
tors and business managers which opened
today at Stanford, bids well to be a com
mendable and overwhelming success.
Papers and annuals from more than
fifty schools from Chico in the north to
Calexico in the south were sent in, and
it has been a merry scramble pouring
over them to select the winners. The
selection has finally been made, but the
prize-winners will not be disclosed until
the final session of the convention tomor
row afternoon.
Divided Into Three Classes
In order to distribute the prizes and
allow a fairer basis for the awards, the
papers were divided into three classes:
Those published in schools of 1,000 at
tendance or over, those of schools having
an attendance under 1,000, and mimeo
graphed enterprizes. By successive "cuts,"
the number in each division was nar
rowed down to six or eight, from which
final selections were made. At first, sec-,
ond, and third were chosen in each in
stance, and in some cases when the com
