# HIGH SCHOOL JOURNALISTS REGISTER FOR CONVENTION
## 
### 
fjUFTY-FIVE high schools, representing the entire state, are sending delegates
* to the convention of high school journalists, which is being held on the
campus today and tomorrow.
The delegations represent schools of all sizes, and of varying degrees of
interest. Many of the large schools have well-established papers as well as
classes in journalism; others have but recently started their college papers
or have only an annual; while still others having no student publication, are
coming to the convention. Many suggestions have been received from the
delegates for discussion during the convention. These have come chiefly

from the smaller schools either on estab
lishing a sclgDol paper or on stirring up
interest in one recently started.
Benefits of Journalism
High school papers seem, as a rule, to
have the thorough support of the high
school faculties. They are believed to be
beneficial, not only on account of the
training in concise statement and the
handling of English which they give, but
also in stirring up interest in school
activities and maintaining school spirit.
Representatives From South
The representation from the southern
part of the state is not as large as was
expected, owing to a convention of the
southern press association, which coin
cides with this meeting. The numbers
are about as great as can be conveniently
handled.
