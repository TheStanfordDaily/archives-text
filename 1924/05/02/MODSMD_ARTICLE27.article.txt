"Round table" discussion groups will
4* the principle means by which the state
convention of high school editors and
• managers will carry on their work during
their two-day session which opened here
this morning with the registration of
delegates.
These discussions will be conducted by
newspaper; men, university journalists,
and high school principles and advisors.
The problems will be suggested by the
advisors and delegates and will pertain
to general problems that come before the
young journalists in connection with
their high school publications.
Delegates have been notified by mail
of these discussions and are expected to
have considerable information concerning
general problems connected with school
publications. The groups are limited to a
small number of students and it is hoped
that much constructive information may
come from these conferences.
The committee in charge hopes to
make these groups act as a clearing house
for ideas which are being used by dif
ferent schools throughout the state. Some
of the questions that have been suggested
for discussion are: 1. That an annual
scholarship fund be created by high school
papers to be awarded each year to the
most high school editor. 2.
Formation of active press associations
among schools in certain sections of the
state. 3. Financial difficulties in connec
tion with high school papers.
The discussions began at 2 o'clock this
afternoon in the seminar rooms on the
third floor of the library. During this
time groups 1, 2, 3, 4, were conducted
through the University Press building
by Donald McKay, editor of the 1025
Quad.
Each group stays in the room allotted
to it, and the speakers move from one
room to another at half-hour intervals.
Following is a list of leaders of the
round table discussions with their sub
jects :
