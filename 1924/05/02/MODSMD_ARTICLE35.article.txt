# NAME CONTEST ENDS NEXT TUESDAY NOON
## 
### 
DON'T FORGET, in the mad scramble
of the week-end, to send in your sug
gestions for the future name of the
Confectionery.
DON'T FORGET, also, that you can
send in any number of names you wish.
DON'T FORGET, yet again, that the
contest will be over next Tuesday.
DON'T FORGET, once more, that
there are but three whole days remain
ing.
DON'T FORGET, ditto, that there is
five dollars' worth of honor naming such
a "Ilappy Hollow."
REMEMBER, to glance over the fol
lowing suggestions, and then see if you
can better them: "Catchy Cave," "The
Cardinal Catch," "Ye Old Hangout,"
"The Cardinal Cottage," "Ye Red Shirt
Tavern," and "The Last Resort."

Extensive plans are being made at
the McPherson College for May Day.
The festivities are to begin at 9 o'clock
and will continue throughout the day.
