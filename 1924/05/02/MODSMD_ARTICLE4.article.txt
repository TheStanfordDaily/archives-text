# CAP AND GOWN WILL GIVE BENEFIT DANCE TOMORROW EVENING
## 
### 
Syncopation fiends will once more
sally forth to the Women's Clubhouse
for a Cap and Gown dance tomorrow
night. During the past two weeks, the
Clubhouse has been deserted for the
more spectacular pavilion functions.
Action will begin at the usual hour
(9 o'clock) to the accompaniment of
the unusual Mertz-Alabaster orchestra.
Saturday's dance will be the first
given by the Cap and Gown society
this quarter.
The customary admission price of
$1.10 will be charged. The proceeds
will go towards paying the debt on
the Clubhouse.
