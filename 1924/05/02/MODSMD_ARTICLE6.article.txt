### Douglas Meservey

ond, an hour later, was accomplished on

<>f continued success.
The Cardinal football eleven, while not
rounding up an entirely successful sea
son, proved itself one of the most-feared
in the Pacific Coast Conference. Al

the conference rating. Six men were
placed on the All-Coast elevens, and
one on Walter Camp's third All-Ameri
can.

Coach "Dink" Templeton's tracksters
came through their season with a clean
slate and a total of 334 points to their

men is slated to make a tour of Aus
tralia this summer.

which the Blue and Gold seven has never

the Illinois Athletic Club for national
honors. The "Winged O" won, 5-3, after
a stiff fight.
Soccer Winds Up Well

of material but wound up the winter
quarter by dropping only two games.
Coach Harry Maloney's fencers for
the fourth consecutive year were vic
