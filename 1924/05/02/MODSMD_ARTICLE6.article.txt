# CARD SPORT SEASON ENDS WITH VICTORY OVER BEARS

### Douglas Meservey 
Thousands of Stanford well-wishers,
last Saturday, had the unalloyed satis
faction of seeing two teams wearing the
Blue and Gold go down to defeat. One
victory came on the cinderpath. The sec

lost the first game of the series.
P. C. C. Basketball

placed third in the Pacific Coast Con

of which decided the winner of the south
ern half of the P. C. C., was lost to the
