The place chosen this year for the
presentation of the Fiesta will become
the permanent pageant stage. The
sloping hillside above the lake bank
forms a natural ampitheatre. The hill
has been terraced and rows of seats
put in. Two rows of pines across the
stage make an appropriate setting for
the graceful Grecian dances. A large
throne backed by three huge white
pillars has been erected in the rear
center of the stage. The priestesses'
marble altar is placed at one side. An
abundance of shrubbery has been
massed across the back of the stage
and around the throne.
Apollo and Pan Compete
"The Legend of the Laurel" has as
its locale the island of Delos, the
birthplace of Apollo, the sun god. The
pageant opens with the entrance of
the priestesses who build an altar fire
and await a musical contest between
two dieties, Apollo and Pan, the little
god of the woods and streams. In the
contest which follows, Apollo's play
ing is judged superior, and he is
crowned victor by Tmolus, god of the
mountains. The sun god's victory is
celebrated by dancing, feasting, and
games. The arrival of an old Delian
soothsayer brings a sudden end to the
merriment, for she carries a feather
from the god's Sacred Swan pierced
by Cupid's arrow. The entire assem
blage is frightened by this ill omen;
the priestesses offer libation to the
deities and Apollo defiantly burns the
feather.
Soon Cupid appears and challenges
Apollo to an archery contest. The god
; refuses and Cupid, angered, plots re
' venge. Later Apollo becomes enam
oured of Daphne. Cupid sends a leaden

arrow of hate into Daphne's heart, and
the dew nymph flees from Apollo. Im
mediately laurel leaf maidens come
forth to protect her. Thus the Dew is
not vanquished by the Sun; instead,
she brings forth the luxuriant laurel
tree as a symbol of her purity. The
pageant is concluded by the singing of
a choral ode by the priestesses, who
have reflected the story throughout
the performance.
Tickets are still on sale in J. E.
McDowell's office in the Administra
tion building. They may also be ob
tained at Crandall's and Sherman and
Clay's in Palo Alto. Tickets will be on
sale at the grounds Saturday.
