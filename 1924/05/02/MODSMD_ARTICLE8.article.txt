# BABES DOWN BEARS IN SEVEN SPORTS
## 
### Douglas Meservey 
Years hence, say in 1940, when a
greatly improved Stanford athletic or
ganization makes freshman victories
a certainty instead of a myth, a record
of three major-sport triumphs in one
season over California will seem little
"to write home about."
Today, three weeks after the first
yearling track victory in 18 years over
the Berkeley babes, we look back
upon a most successful season for the
Stanford freshman major- and minor
sport teams.
Football Victories
As a forecast of what was to follow
in other sports, Coach "Husky" Hunt
and his aggregation of 1927 footballers
pulled through their season up to the
California battle with only one defeat,
that being administered by the highly
touted yearlings from U. S. C., 10 to 0.
In the final struggle of the season with
California, the Card eleven, failing to
display any anticipated "breaks," trounced
the invading Bears with a 12 to 0 score.
These twelve points made the season's
total read: Stanford, 131; opponents, 10.
Thirteen Victories
The progress of the freshman basket
ball quintet through the court season was
even more auspicious. Twelve successive
and decisive victories preceded the Cali
fornia series and on the thirteenth of
March and in their thirteenth game of the
season, the Card five downed the Bears,
29 to 22.. The second contest went to
California, 9 to 14; but the third, and
with it the series, was won by Stanford,
27 to 20—the first Card yearling win since
1917. The season's total of points read:
Stanford, 352; opponents, 195.
A fitting climax to the athletic year came
