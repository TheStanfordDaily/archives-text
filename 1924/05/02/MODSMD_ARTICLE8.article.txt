# BABES DOWN BEARS IN SEVEN SPORTS
## 
### Douglas Meservey 
Years hence, say in 1940, when a
greatly improved Stanford athletic or
ganization makes freshman victories
a certainty instead of a myth, a record
of three major-sport triumphs in one
season over California will seem little
"to write home about."
Today, three weeks after the first
yearling track victory in 18 years over
the Berkeley babes, we look back
upon a most successful season for the
Stanford freshman major- and minor
sport teams.
Football Victories
As a forecast of what was to follow
in other sports, Coach "Husky" Hunt
and his aggregation of 1927 footballers
pulled through their season up to the
California battle with only one defeat,
that being administered by the highly
touted yearlings from U. S. C., 10 to 0.
In the final struggle of the season with
California, the Card eleven, failing to
display any anticipated "breaks," trounced
the invading Bears with a 12 to 0 score.
These twelve points made the season's
total read: Stanford, 131; opponents, 10.
Thirteen Victories
The progress of the freshman basket
ball quintet through the court season was
even more auspicious. Twelve successive
and decisive victories preceded the Cali
fornia series and on the thirteenth of
March and in their thirteenth game of the
season, the Card five downed the Bears,
29 to 22.. The second contest went to
California, 9 to 14; but the third, and
with it the series, was won by Stanford,
27 to 20â€”the first Card yearling win since
1917. The season's total of points read:
Stanford, 352; opponents, 195.
A fitting climax to the athletic year came
on the cinderpath when for the first time
in the history of Stanford-California
freshman competition, the Card babe
tracksters overwhelmingly defeated the
Bears, 83 1-4 to 47 3-4, taking twelve out
of fifteen firsts. This win followed a sea
son unbroken by defeat and one in which
a number of certain prospects were un
covered for varsity competition in 1925.
Although Stanford's freshman diamond
ers lost both of their clashes with the
Blue and Gold in the annual series, the
preliminary season was much brighter.
Fifteen victories and only two defeats
were chalked up in the seventeen prac
tice games held.
Lowell High Beaten
Lowell high and Oakland tech were
downed by the tennis squad in the meets
preliminary to the California series, but
in the latter, Captain Holman was the
only man to turn in a win. Holman also
added the San Francisco junior cham
pionship to his list of titles early in the
year.
Two victories were garnered by the
swimming team over the "Winged O"
juniors and Alameda high school in pre
liminary clashes. Buth the swimmers and
water polo teams took their Bruin series,
the former winning 59 to 9 and breaking
three records, and the latter winning by
a 13 to 1 score.
Bruin Golfers Downed
Golf, a new first-year activity, made a
hopeful entry onto the list when the babe
team downed its Berkeley rivals 10 to 6
on the Burlingame course.
Soccer ended a mediocre season when
the babe eleven downed the Bear yearl
ings, 4 to 1, after they had previously
tied them, 1 to 1, and took the scries.
