### Bradley Riter 
■FORMATION of the California Interscholastic Press Association culminated
* the convention of high school editors and business managers at Stanford
last Friday and Saturday under the auspices of Sigma Delta Chi. It was the
first state-wide conclave of its nature ever to be held.
Burnell Gould of Oakland University High School was elected president
■with Dorothy Carrow of Stockton High vice-president and secretary.
The purpose of the new organization is to provide for the unification of
high school journalism, to afford a means for the exchange of news and
illustrations, and principally to insure a yearly meeting.
Noisy enthusiasm characterized the last general session in the Little

Saturday afternoon, and Sig
ma Delta Chi was cheered loud and
vociferously by the 150-odd delegates ;
from all parts of the state, from Claico
| in the north to Calexico in the south,
j Final committee reports, an awarding
jof prizes by Bradley Riter, Awards
! Committee chairman, and brief con
| eluding addresses by Norris James,'
j newly-elected head of Sigma Delta Chi,
; and Carl Shoup, retiring head, consti-!
tuted the final program.
Much of the work of the convention
j was done by round-table talks. The
body of delegates was divided into
seven groups, each group being led by
journalists from the professional field
and from the University. The sessions ,
were strictly informal, and much of
the discussion was carried on by the
, delegates themselves who had ideas
to advance and problems to bring up
for solution.
