# PHI DELTA THETA WINS INTRAMURAL GAME FROM D. U.'S
## 
### 
Encina second shut out Theta Chi, 10 to
0, and Phi Delta Theta won from Delta
Upsilon, 5 to 2, in the final games of the
fifth round of the intramural baseball
series Friday. Sigma Alpha Epsilon and
El Tigre won by default from Encina
first and Alpha Kappa Lambda, re
spectively.
El Tigre is still the leader in League
5, with four victories and no defeats.
O'Hara twirled the Phi Delts to vic
tory, keeping his opponents' hits scat
tered, and tightening up when threatened.
Atwill pitched a good game for Delta
Upsilon, but the Phi Delts had the punch
when it was needed.
Phi Delta Theta scored twice in the
first inning, and put one more run across
in the second. The D. U's tallies came
in the third and fourth.
Encina second put their game on ice
in the initial frame, when they chalked
up four markers. Encina nicked Schultz
berg, Theta Chi heaver, for nine hits.
Three of these were for two bases.
Johnson, on the mound for Encina sec
ond, allowed six hits, but kept them
scattered. Edwards of Encina got three
hits out of four times at the plate.
Tomorrow's games: Kappa Sigma vs.
Sigma Chi, Alpha Delta Phi vs. Zeta
Psi, Phi Kappa Psi vs. Encina first, Se
quoia second vs. Sigma Alpha Epsilon.
