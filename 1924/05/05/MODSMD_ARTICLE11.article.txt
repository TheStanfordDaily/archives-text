# GROUP DANCES SURPASS INDIVIDUAL WORK IN "LEGEND OF THE LAUREL"
## Variety of Costumes, Effective Staging, Characterize Pageant Production 
### Esther Greenacre 
A variety of costumes and effective
staging characterized "The Legend of
! the Laurel," the second biennial wo
men's pageant which was presented at
j the lake Saturday afternoon.
As a whole, the group dances sur
i passed the individual dramatic and
j solo work. Of the principals, the work
j of Velma Itandall as Daphne, Carolan
| Strouse as Pan, and Ann McAnear as
Tmolus, was especially commendable.
Of the solo dancers, Violet Knowles
as leader of the sun maidens stood out
distinctly. Margret Schaufelberger
who headed the rainbow maidens, and
Frances Summers, leader of the Water
sprites, did good work.
Velma Randall, as Daphne, the dew

* nymph, combined beauty with a na
tural and unaffected grace in her danc
ing and acting. In the dance with
Apollo in which the sun god pursued
the dew nymph and she found escape
by being transformed into a laurel
tree, Daphne embodied the freshness
and spirit of the entire pageant.
Daphne Hodgson as Apollo larked
individuality and force in her acting.
However, the role was a difficult one
in that it required at once manliness
and grace and an abrupt change from
spontaneity to dejection.
Anna McAnear made an ideal
Tmolus. She played the part of the old
god of the mountains with appropriate
dignity and a regal air. One of the
most charming features of the pageant
was introduced by Carolan Strouse as
Pan, the gay little god of the woods
and streams. The acting of Pan and
his group of satyrs was entertaining,
giving a humorous touch to the pro
duction. Gertrude Byler, as the an
cient soothsayer, and Marjorie Allen,
as the sprightly cupid, took their parts
well.
Of the group dances, that of the dew
sprites and sun maids stood out. The
rather intricate steps and harmonious
costumes combined to make the dance
extremely effective. The rainbow
maidens, with their flowing bright
colored costumes made a lovely pic
ture, as did the water sprites and
flower maidens.
An excellent interpretation of the
Bacchanale was given by Adelaide
Kelly, Helen Whitney, and Margret
Schaufelberger.
The imposing and artistic throne, as
well as the arrangement of the arti
ficial shrubbery were planned by
Helen Whitney. The simplicity of the
stage properties, added to the beauty
of the natural scenery, made an excel
lent background for the play.
The music accompaniment, arranged
by R. Willis-Porter and played by the
University orchestra, contributed to
the atmosphere of the pageant and
reflected the different moods of the
actors. Schubert Club assisted a group
of priestesses in the choral odes which
opened and closed the pageant.
Apollo's harp solo, played behind
scenes by Miss Barbara Murkley of
Sacramento, was well received, as was
also the flute solo by Mrs. Christine
Powells Pfund, a member of the San
Francisco Symphony Orchestra.
It is estimated that about 1000 peo
ple witnessed the pageant. The tem
porary bleachers were completely
filled and a considerable number of
people were standing.
Edythe Baylis directed the entire
pageant, with Miss Hannah Mathews
of Castilleja supervising most of the
dancing. Dorothy Brenholts had com
plete charge of the costuming. The
costumes were not only lovely in ef
fect but carried out in every detail the
spirit of the early days of Greece.
They made up the most charming fea
ture of the performance.
The fiesta programs were extremely
attractive and sold well. The program
cover was designed by Delia Taylor.
