rriCKETS for "So This Is Eden," the forthcoming Junior Opera, will go on
sale tomorrow afternoon at 1 o'clock at the Administration building and at
Crandall's. At the most, only 100 roughs' seats will be sold and, should these
be needed as regular seats, none will be available.
Carrying with it a plot that would be able to get across with any audience
regardless of music or chorus numbers, the Junior Opera should be one of the
best presented campus plays of the year. The story opens in the fashionable
Riverside Drive apartment of Mr. Devoe, where a party to a number of
theatrical people is in progress. It is at this party that the never-failing soft
shoe dancers, Lippincott and Van Deusen, will do the "Woolworth Lurch."

something original in the way of a;
bacchanale dance.
This everlasting go-go-go- of the
night life has so disgusted Blair
Fawkes, and Nan Devoe, his lover,
that they decide to leave and seek
"the wide open spaces, where men are
men." Accompanied by Aunt Abagail,
as chaperon, they leave the bright
lights of Broadway for the transplant
ed Garden of Eden in the Bahama
Islands.
Bootleggers Enter
Mr. Devoe, although President of
the Prohibition League of New York
City and outlying districts, is shown
to deal with Harvey in the formation
of the biggest bootlegging ring in the
history of New York. Shortly after,
Deacon Higgins, who believes Devoe's
soul is as white as that of a little
child, makes plans wifch him in the
surbing of this dreadful evil.
Strange to say, the lovers' Garden
of Eden turns out to be the center of
the bootlegging ring, and the second
act, with its gorgeous settings and
exquisite lighting effects, reveals the
lovers on the smugglers' island, filling
their lungs with great gulps of pure
air.
Finding his daughter gone, Devoe
organizes a search party and in due
time arrives on his palatial yacht at
the smugglers' den, where he finds
Nan, Blair, and Aunt Abagail in the
clutches of a dirty villain, Roderiguez,
who handles the export end of his
smuggling outfit. The plot thickens.
Harvey Double Crosses
Running true to all pirate plays,
double crosses filter out from the plot.
Harvey employs Roderiguez to double
cross Devoe, and Piazza —"the flaming
barrier" —played by Delmer Daves, in
veigles Harvey into double crossing
Roderiguez. In the meantime, Roderi
guez has scorned his mistress, Celes
tina, for the white beauty, Nan, who
is helpless in his captivity. But Celes
tina, the fiery Spanish dancer, is not
to be left in the dust by anyone. She
works her feminine charms on Piazza,
trying -to get him to organize the cut
throat gang of rum-runners against
Roderiguez. The plot continues to
thicken.
The third act finds the romantic and
mysterious isle in the most beautiful
of settings. Deacon Higgins, influenced
by the exotic surroundings of mellow
moonlight and soft music, falls madly
in love with Aunt Abagail. It is here
that the "to be famous" Cave Man
song is sung. "Hock" Chalmers, dress
ed as a deacon, singing a cave man
song over the footlights, ought to fill
the house at first suggestion.
Plot Unravels
Ten minutes before the curtain falls
on the last encore, the situation is
this: Celestia has plotted to enmesh
Roderiguez through the agency of
Piazza and Blair. Harvey has tried to
double cross Roderiguez and Devoe
with Celestina and Piazza. Devoe's
white soul is coming to the top again,
he is becoming disgusted with way
wardness and dissipation. He tries to
dispose of his bootleggers island. Both
Blair and Nan, the Deacon and Aunt
Abagail are wrapt up in the agonizing
glory of each other.
A prize of an aluminum cooking set,
three egg strainers, and three cans of
Campbell's Tomato Soup—not an adv.
—will be given the person who can
fit the right endings on this unhomo
genious mass of detail. Members of
the cast are ineligible. Send all an
swers care of the Contest Editor,

really is.

something original in the way of a;
bacchanale dance.
This everlasting go-go-go- of the
night life has so disgusted Blair
Fawkes, and Nan Devoe, his lover,
that they decide to leave and seek
"the wide open spaces, where men are
men." Accompanied by Aunt Abagail,
as chaperon, they leave the bright
lights of Broadway for the transplant
ed Garden of Eden in the Bahama
Islands.
Bootleggers Enter
Mr. Devoe, although President of
the Prohibition League of New York
City and outlying districts, is shown
to deal with Harvey in the formation
of the biggest bootlegging ring in the
history of New York. Shortly after,
Deacon Higgins, who believes Devoe's
soul is as white as that of a little
child, makes plans wifch him in the
surbing of this dreadful evil.
Strange to say, the lovers' Garden
of Eden turns out to be the center of
the bootlegging ring, and the second
act, with its gorgeous settings and
exquisite lighting effects, reveals the
lovers on the smugglers' island, filling
their lungs with great gulps of pure
air.
Finding his daughter gone, Devoe
organizes a search party and in due
time arrives on his palatial yacht at
the smugglers' den, where he finds
Nan, Blair, and Aunt Abagail in the
clutches of a dirty villain, Roderiguez,
who handles the export end of his
smuggling outfit. The plot thickens.
Harvey Double Crosses
Running true to all pirate plays,
double crosses filter out from the plot.
Harvey employs Roderiguez to double
cross Devoe, and Piazza —"the flaming
barrier" —played by Delmer Daves, in
veigles Harvey into double crossing
Roderiguez. In the meantime, Roderi
guez has scorned his mistress, Celes
tina, for the white beauty, Nan, who
is helpless in his captivity. But Celes
tina, the fiery Spanish dancer, is not
to be left in the dust by anyone. She
works her feminine charms on Piazza,
trying -to get him to organize the cut
throat gang of rum-runners against
Roderiguez. The plot continues to
thicken.
The third act finds the romantic and
mysterious isle in the most beautiful
of settings. Deacon Higgins, influenced
by the exotic surroundings of mellow
moonlight and soft music, falls madly
in love with Aunt Abagail. It is here
that the "to be famous" Cave Man
song is sung. "Hock" Chalmers, dress
ed as a deacon, singing a cave man
song over the footlights, ought to fill
the house at first suggestion.
Plot Unravels
Ten minutes before the curtain falls
on the last encore, the situation is
this: Celestia has plotted to enmesh
Roderiguez through the agency of
Piazza and Blair. Harvey has tried to
double cross Roderiguez and Devoe
with Celestina and Piazza. Devoe's
white soul is coming to the top again,
he is becoming disgusted with way
wardness and dissipation. He tries to
dispose of his bootleggers island. Both
Blair and Nan, the Deacon and Aunt
Abagail are wrapt up in the agonizing
glory of each other.

child, makes plans wifch him in the
surbing of this dreadful evil.
Strange to say, the lovers' Garden
of Eden turns out to be the center of
the bootlegging ring, and the second
act, with its gorgeous settings and
exquisite lighting effects, reveals the
lovers on the smugglers' island, filling
their lungs with great gulps of pure
air.
Finding his daughter gone, Devoe
organizes a search party and in due
time arrives on his palatial yacht at
the smugglers' den, where he finds
Nan, Blair, and Aunt Abagail in the
clutches of a dirty villain, Roderiguez,
who handles the export end of his
smuggling outfit. The plot thickens.
Harvey Double Crosses
Running true to all pirate plays,
double crosses filter out from the plot.
Harvey employs Roderiguez to double
cross Devoe, and Piazza —"the flaming
barrier" —played by Delmer Daves, in
veigles Harvey into double crossing
Roderiguez. In the meantime, Roderi
guez has scorned his mistress, Celes
tina, for the white beauty, Nan, who
is helpless in his captivity. But Celes
tina, the fiery Spanish dancer, is not
to be left in the dust by anyone. She
works her feminine charms on Piazza,
trying -to get him to organize the cut
throat gang of rum-runners against
Roderiguez. The plot continues to
thicken.
The third act finds the romantic and
mysterious isle in the most beautiful
of settings. Deacon Higgins, influenced
by the exotic surroundings of mellow
moonlight and soft music, falls madly
in love with Aunt Abagail. It is here
that the "to be famous" Cave Man
song is sung. "Hock" Chalmers, dress
ed as a deacon, singing a cave man
song over the footlights, ought to fill
the house at first suggestion.
Plot Unravels
Ten minutes before the curtain falls
on the last encore, the situation is
this: Celestia has plotted to enmesh
Roderiguez through the agency of
Piazza and Blair. Harvey has tried to
double cross Roderiguez and Devoe
with Celestina and Piazza. Devoe's
white soul is coming to the top again,
he is becoming disgusted with way
wardness and dissipation. He tries to
dispose of his bootleggers island. Both
Blair and Nan, the Deacon and Aunt
Abagail are wrapt up in the agonizing
glory of each other.
