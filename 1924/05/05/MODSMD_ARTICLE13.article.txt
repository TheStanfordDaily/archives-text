# ARNE BORG FAILS TO BREAK SWIM RECORD AT NEPTUNE BEACH
## 
### 
Arne Borg of Swedkn v Europe's great
est merman, and second only to Johnnie
Wcismuller as record holder, failed
by eight seconds to break the world's
record for 400 meters Saturday at Nep
tune Beach. Borg has been training in
Eticina pool the past week,
Borg's time for the 400 meters was 5
minutes 114-5 seconds, eight seconds
over that made by Wcismuller. The
Swede was swimming under the handi
cap of an abcess in his ear, however, and
was in great pain throughout the dis
tance.
At the end of the first lap, Borg was
timed at 59 3-5 seconds; the 200 yards
was finished in 2:11 2-5 seconds; and the
furlong in 2:25 4-5 seconds. His third
lap was slow, but in the fourth and last
lap he showed his great reserve strength
and finished like a sprinter.
Borg's style, both while swimming and
turning, is peculiar. He uses the under
water turn and a fast arm action, cross
ing his arms in a peculiar manner in
front of his face. The pull of his arm
is also but half the length of the sweep
used by the average American swimmer
and his leg drive is a combination of the
Australian and American crawls.
