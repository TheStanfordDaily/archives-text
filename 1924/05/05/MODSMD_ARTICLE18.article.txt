# How About It?

I he college year of 1923-24 has been the most successful that Stanford
has experienced since the war. That statement is rather hroad but the
Daily Palo Alto believes that it is none the less true.
Not only from the standpoint of athletics but from practically every
possible veiwpoint, the present year has been a satisfactory one. Probably
the most notable change has come through the freshmen. By winning
three major sports from their Blue and Gold rivals, the first year men have
put themselves in an enviable position on the athletic field. In other lines
of activity, too, they have proved themselves worthy of the great institution
which they represent.
On top of their extraordinary achievements in outside activity they
have proved that, as a whole, they have a serious purpose in attending
Stanford. The 'class of 1927 has hung up an enviable scholastic record,
losing but few of its members through the flunkout route.
Undoubtedly, there are many causes which have contributed to the
change, but the Daily Palo Alto believes that the Sponsor System has
been, in a very large mueasure, responsible. The freshmen have lived to
gether in Encina hall for nearly a year. In that time, they have become
acquainted with each other and have learned to work together. They were
given plenty of opportunity to look around before the time came for them
to decide upon the organization with which they were to affiliate.
In nearly a year s time, the freshmen have learned what the Stanford
traditions are and most of them have observed them as a matter of course.
1 here are some who have not fitted in and have made no attempt to get
their bearings but they are in the minority and will either drop by the way
side or be assimilated in the course of time. Taken all in all, the freshmen
have gotten a good foundation for their careers here as Stanford men and
women.
Now it is up to the various organizations which have taken these new
comers in, to put on the finishing touches and keep them on the right track.
They must be made to realize that STANFORD comes first in every case.
No small group within the University should interfere with, or put itself
ahead of, the welfare of the larger and more important body.
UNFORTUNATELY, SOME OF THESE SMALL GROUPS
HAVE PROVED WITHIN THE PAST FEW DAYS THAT THEY
THEMSELVES, NO NOT CONSIDER THE UNIVERSITY
FIRST.
The disgusting selfishness and absolute lack of judgment combined
with complete lack of foresight which cropped up so conspicuously in a
recent occurrence gives absolute proof of this fact. It is quite evident
that the peanut politicians have again gotten busy. Fortunately for Stan
ford, some of her sons had the good sense to "smear" the political frame
up and at the same time refrain from making a big fuss about it. It will
be interesting to see whether or not the organizations involved will have
sufficient intelligence to profit by their lesson. If they have, they will
make so such attempts in the future and, seeing the error of their ways,
they will make amends by discouraging any such tendencies on the part of
their underclassmen.
1 he organizations, themselves, are not the only sources through which
the Sponsor System may be retained and improved. Improved, because
it is by no means perfect. A year's association with the new system should
give the freshmen ideas which would help materially in making improve
ments next year. As sophomores, the members of the class of 1927 will
have a very important effect upon the existing system.

without flaws, it is a step in the right direction. _ It should be retained and
cherished as one of the most beneficial of Stanford's institutions.

their bearings but they are in the minority and will either drop by the way
side or be assimilated in the course of time. Taken all in all, the freshmen
have gotten a good foundation for their careers here as Stanford men and
women.
Now it is up to the various organizations which have taken these new
comers in, to put on the finishing touches and keep them on the right track.
They must be made to realize that STANFORD comes first in every case.
No small group within the University should interfere with, or put itself
ahead of, the welfare of the larger and more important body.

HAVE PROVED WITHIN THE PAST FEW DAYS THAT THEY
THEMSELVES, NO NOT CONSIDER THE UNIVERSITY
FIRST.
The disgusting selfishness and absolute lack of judgment combined
with complete lack of foresight which cropped up so conspicuously in a
recent occurrence gives absolute proof of this fact. It is quite evident
that the peanut politicians have again gotten busy. Fortunately for Stan
ford, some of her sons had the good sense to "smear" the political frame
up and at the same time refrain from making a big fuss about it. It will
be interesting to see whether or not the organizations involved will have
sufficient intelligence to profit by their lesson. If they have, they will
make so such attempts in the future and, seeing the error of their ways,
they will make amends by discouraging any such tendencies on the part of
their underclassmen.
1 he organizations, themselves, are not the only sources through which
the Sponsor System may be retained and improved. Improved, because
it is by no means perfect. A year's association with the new system should
give the freshmen ideas which would help materially in making improve
ments next year. As sophomores, the members of the class of 1927 will
have a very important effect upon the existing system.

I he college year of 1923-24 has been the most successful that Stanford
has experienced since the war. That statement is rather hroad but the
Daily Palo Alto believes that it is none the less true.
Not only from the standpoint of athletics but from practically every
possible veiwpoint, the present year has been a satisfactory one. Probably
the most notable change has come through the freshmen. By winning
three major sports from their Blue and Gold rivals, the first year men have
put themselves in an enviable position on the athletic field. In other lines
of activity, too, they have proved themselves worthy of the great institution
which they represent.
On top of their extraordinary achievements in outside activity they
have proved that, as a whole, they have a serious purpose in attending
Stanford. The 'class of 1927 has hung up an enviable scholastic record,
losing but few of its members through the flunkout route.
Undoubtedly, there are many causes which have contributed to the
change, but the Daily Palo Alto believes that the Sponsor System has
been, in a very large mueasure, responsible. The freshmen have lived to
gether in Encina hall for nearly a year. In that time, they have become
acquainted with each other and have learned to work together. They were
given plenty of opportunity to look around before the time came for them
to decide upon the organization with which they were to affiliate.
