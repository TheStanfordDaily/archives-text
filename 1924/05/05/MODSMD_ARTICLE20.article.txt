Overseas League, April 6, 1924.
Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Dear Sir—l was very pleased to hear
that you had published my account of the
Socialist riots in Hamburg, and 1 am
now sending in a brief account of the
Oxford-Cambridge boat race, which I
was lucky enough to be able to see, as
I think that it would perhaps be of in
terest (o some of the fellows, especially
as it is not so long ago since Stanford
took a prominent part in boat racing.
Should you publish it. will you be kind
enough to keep me a copy of the paper
and I will call for it personally. 1 hopt;
to be back in California by the latter
part of May, and to re-enter Stanford
next fall. Yours very sincerely,
VV. ERNEST BILTSEN, Ex-'25.

The Oxford-Cambridge Boat Race
Although boat racing is no longer an
item in the Stanford sports program,
there are, doubtlessly, still many on the
campus who remember Stanford boat
race triumphs, and regret the banishment
of this sport. L think, therefore, that an
account of the Oxford-Cambridge boat
race will be of interest to many.
The Oxford and Cambridge boat race
is, without a doubt, one of the most
classic and well-known sports events in
the world. The first race was rowed
in 1829 over a 2J4-mile course upstream.
The team's uniform consisted of straw
hats, sweaters, and long canvas trousers,
while most of the men had long beards
and mustaches after the fashion of that
time.
It was not till the year 1856 that the
race became an annual event.
Although there has been 76 races,
Oxford has won 40. Cambridge 35 (in
cluding this year's), while in 1?77 the
race resulted in a tie.
This year's race took place on April 5,
which dawned cold and windy. From
early morning, the banks of the Thames
were lined with spectators.
By 2 o'clock in the afternoon, there
was over a quarter of a million people
lining both sides of the course, im
patiently waiting, among which could be
seen dashes of light blue and dark blue,
the colors of the rival universities.
By 2:15 both the teams had appeared,
to be greeted by great bursts of cheer
ing, not the regulated cheering we have
in America, but a huge swelling noise,
like the buzzing of a giant bee hive.
At 2:20, the boats were at the start
ing post. The river had been cleared of
all traffic, and the sun was shining
brightly, although there was a cold
breeze blownig.
Cambridge had won the toss, and,

'greatly to everybody's surprise, chose the
sunny side of the river, or the longer
side, the course not being straight, but
almost a right angle. They nad. How
ever, the advantage of smoother water
on that side.
Oxford was the general favorite, the
crew was heavier than the Cambridge
crew, and they had been showing excel
lent form in the past week.
Presently there was a huge roaring
cry, "They are off!"
Out Hashed the two boats, Oxford
slightly in the lead, followed by four
small motor boats containing the um
pires and movie film cameras, while in
back of them came four large river pas
senger boats, crowded with press re
porters and people of note.
At the mile post both the boats were
even, and slowly Cambraidge started to
draw ahead. In vain did Mellen, the Ox
ford stroke, who, by the way, is an
American, try to catch up. The Cam
bridge crew were invincible and was
working coolly and machine-like.
My this time they had passed beyond
my vision, and I had to content myself
with hearing the radio speakers, whicli
reported the progress of the race.
Suddenly there was a pause, all the
crowd holding its breath, and slowly the
light blue flag of Cambridge was hoisted
to the top of the mast on the boating
club. Cambridge had won by four and
a half lengths, covering me
course down stream in 18 minutes 42
seconds, or the closest result ever made
to the record of 18 minutes 29 seconds,
established by Oxford in 191.3.
The Oxford defeat was a surp ise to
everybody, it being evident that they had
overtrained and gone stale, tor while the
Cambridge crew was comparatively
fresh at the finish, the Oxford crew was
in a very exhausted condition.
Thus was the 76th Oxford and Cam
bridge boat race rowed.
Needless to say, there were scenes of
wild rejoicing in London Town that
night, and next morning Mellen found
himself reposing in the Vine-street jail.
He had evidently tried to drown his sor
rows in—well—not root beer, anyway.

The averages in studies at the Uni
versity of Colorado show the average
for all men to be 75.80 and for all
women to be 76.89.

while most of the men had long beards
and mustaches after the fashion of that
time.
It was not till the year 1856 that the
race became an annual event.
Although there has been 76 races,
Oxford has won 40. Cambridge 35 (in
cluding this year's), while in 1?77 the
race resulted in a tie.
This year's race took place on April 5,
which dawned cold and windy. From
early morning, the banks of the Thames
were lined with spectators.
By 2 o'clock in the afternoon, there
was over a quarter of a million people
lining both sides of the course, im
patiently waiting, among which could be
seen dashes of light blue and dark blue,
the colors of the rival universities.
By 2:15 both the teams had appeared,
to be greeted by great bursts of cheer
ing, not the regulated cheering we have
in America, but a huge swelling noise,
like the buzzing of a giant bee hive.
At 2:20, the boats were at the start
ing post. The river had been cleared of
all traffic, and the sun was shining
brightly, although there was a cold
breeze blownig.
Cambridge had won the toss, and,

'greatly to everybody's surprise, chose the
sunny side of the river, or the longer
side, the course not being straight, but
almost a right angle. They nad. How
ever, the advantage of smoother water
on that side.
Oxford was the general favorite, the
crew was heavier than the Cambridge
crew, and they had been showing excel
lent form in the past week.
Presently there was a huge roaring
cry, "They are off!"
Out Hashed the two boats, Oxford
slightly in the lead, followed by four
small motor boats containing the um
pires and movie film cameras, while in
back of them came four large river pas
senger boats, crowded with press re
porters and people of note.
At the mile post both the boats were
even, and slowly Cambraidge started to
draw ahead. In vain did Mellen, the Ox
ford stroke, who, by the way, is an
American, try to catch up. The Cam
bridge crew were invincible and was
working coolly and machine-like.
My this time they had passed beyond
my vision, and I had to content myself
with hearing the radio speakers, whicli
reported the progress of the race.
Suddenly there was a pause, all the
crowd holding its breath, and slowly the
light blue flag of Cambridge was hoisted
to the top of the mast on the boating
club. Cambridge had won by four and
a half lengths, covering me
course down stream in 18 minutes 42
seconds, or the closest result ever made
to the record of 18 minutes 29 seconds,
established by Oxford in 191.3.
The Oxford defeat was a surp ise to
everybody, it being evident that they had
overtrained and gone stale, tor while the
Cambridge crew was comparatively
fresh at the finish, the Oxford crew was
in a very exhausted condition.
Thus was the 76th Oxford and Cam
bridge boat race rowed.
Needless to say, there were scenes of
wild rejoicing in London Town that
night, and next morning Mellen found
himself reposing in the Vine-street jail.
He had evidently tried to drown his sor
rows in—well—not root beer, anyway.

The averages in studies at the Uni
versity of Colorado show the average
for all men to be 75.80 and for all
women to be 76.89.

I think that it would perhaps be of in

as it is not so long ago since Stanford
took a prominent part in boat racing.
Should you publish it. will you be kind

The Oxford-Cambridge Boat Race
Although boat racing is no longer an
item in the Stanford sports program,
there are, doubtlessly, still many on the
campus who remember Stanford boat
race triumphs, and regret the banishment
of this sport. L think, therefore, that an
account of the Oxford-Cambridge boat
race will be of interest to many.
The Oxford and Cambridge boat race
is, without a doubt, one of the most
classic and well-known sports events in
the world. The first race was rowed
in 1829 over a 2J4-mile course upstream.
The team's uniform consisted of straw
hats, sweaters, and long canvas trousers,
while most of the men had long beards
and mustaches after the fashion of that

crew was heavier than the Cambridge
crew, and they had been showing excel
lent form in the past week.
Presently there was a huge roaring
cry, "They are off!"
Out Hashed the two boats, Oxford
slightly in the lead, followed by four
small motor boats containing the um
pires and movie film cameras, while in
back of them came four large river pas
senger boats, crowded with press re
porters and people of note.
At the mile post both the boats were
even, and slowly Cambraidge started to
draw ahead. In vain did Mellen, the Ox
ford stroke, who, by the way, is an
American, try to catch up. The Cam
bridge crew were invincible and was
working coolly and machine-like.
My this time they had passed beyond
my vision, and I had to content myself
with hearing the radio speakers, whicli
reported the progress of the race.
Suddenly there was a pause, all the
crowd holding its breath, and slowly the
light blue flag of Cambridge was hoisted
to the top of the mast on the boating
club. Cambridge had won by four and
a half lengths, covering me
course down stream in 18 minutes 42
seconds, or the closest result ever made
to the record of 18 minutes 29 seconds,
established by Oxford in 191.3.
The Oxford defeat was a surp ise to
everybody, it being evident that they had
overtrained and gone stale, tor while the
Cambridge crew was comparatively
fresh at the finish, the Oxford crew was
in a very exhausted condition.
Thus was the 76th Oxford and Cam
bridge boat race rowed.
Needless to say, there were scenes of
wild rejoicing in London Town that
night, and next morning Mellen found
himself reposing in the Vine-street jail.
He had evidently tried to drown his sor
rows in—well—not root beer, anyway.

The averages in studies at the Uni
versity of Colorado show the average
for all men to be 75.80 and for all
women to be 76.89.

Editor Daily Palo Alto:
Dear Sir—l was very pleased to hear
that you had published my account of the
Socialist riots in Hamburg, and 1 am
now sending in a brief account of the
Oxford-Cambridge boat race, which I
was lucky enough to be able to see, as
I think that it would perhaps be of in
terest (o some of the fellows, especially
as it is not so long ago since Stanford
took a prominent part in boat racing.
Should you publish it. will you be kind
enough to keep me a copy of the paper
and I will call for it personally. 1 hopt;
to be back in California by the latter
part of May, and to re-enter Stanford
next fall. Yours very sincerely,

The Oxford-Cambridge Boat Race
Although boat racing is no longer an
item in the Stanford sports program,
there are, doubtlessly, still many on the
campus who remember Stanford boat
race triumphs, and regret the banishment
of this sport. L think, therefore, that an
account of the Oxford-Cambridge boat
race will be of interest to many.
The Oxford and Cambridge boat race
is, without a doubt, one of the most
classic and well-known sports events in
the world. The first race was rowed
in 1829 over a 2J4-mile course upstream.
The team's uniform consisted of straw
hats, sweaters, and long canvas trousers,
while most of the men had long beards
and mustaches after the fashion of that
time.
It was not till the year 1856 that the
race became an annual event.
Although there has been 76 races,
Oxford has won 40. Cambridge 35 (in
cluding this year's), while in 1?77 the
race resulted in a tie.
This year's race took place on April 5,
which dawned cold and windy. From
early morning, the banks of the Thames
were lined with spectators.
By 2 o'clock in the afternoon, there
was over a quarter of a million people
lining both sides of the course, im
patiently waiting, among which could be
seen dashes of light blue and dark blue,
the colors of the rival universities.
By 2:15 both the teams had appeared,
to be greeted by great bursts of cheer
ing, not the regulated cheering we have
in America, but a huge swelling noise,
like the buzzing of a giant bee hive.
At 2:20, the boats were at the start
ing post. The river had been cleared of
all traffic, and the sun was shining
brightly, although there was a cold
breeze blownig.
Cambridge had won the toss, and,

'greatly to everybody's surprise, chose the
sunny side of the river, or the longer
side, the course not being straight, but
almost a right angle. They nad. How
ever, the advantage of smoother water
on that side.
