On your mark! Get set! Fore!
Here comes our old friend, Earl Thomson, breaking the course record for
the high hurdles over bunkers and traps. Earl is quite a versatile athlete,
holding the world's record for the 120-yard high hurdles, being an "80-or
thereabouts" golfer, and the father of twins. While at Dartmouth in 1920 he
ran the 130-yard high hurdles in 14 2-5 seconds for an all-time record which
still stands. At present Earl is track coach at Yale and has shot 18 holes in 86,
which goes to show that as a golfer he is a darned good hurdler. He writes:
"My golf game is yet in its infancy. I like it better than anything else except
money. Was low handicap man at Morgantown Country Club last summer,
but left there before the championships were played. The queerest shot I
ever made was on a short water hole. I topped my mashi shot but the ball hit
the water, skipped across the pond, and stopped my mashi shot but the ball hit
a short putt for a birdie two."
