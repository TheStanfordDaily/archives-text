# Journalists Even Up Series in Game With S. U. P. Yesterday
## 
### "Dad" McNabb (Mgr. S. U. P 
The strategic tactics of the would-be
journalists served its purpose in defeat
ing the proletariats in the second game
between the aforesaid teams by the score
of 14-13.
After the S. U. P. men had run them
selves to near unconsciousness (not be
ing in training for track work), knock
ing the ball to all corners of the lot,
thereby tiring themselves till they could
hardly navigate, in one case one man
collapsing after a homer, the D. P. A.
came from behind in the last inning
with five runs (with some pretty raw
decisions), thus nosing out a much bet
ter team of ball players.
This makes it horse and horse. The
next game will decide who are the real
champions. I predict it will not be the
white collar bunch.
