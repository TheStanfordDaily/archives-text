# INITIAL BABE GOLF TOURNAMENT STAGED FRIDAY IS SUCCESS
## 
### 
John Leiter won the trophy offered
for the low net score with a card of
91-20-71 in the first freshman golf
tournament held on the Lincoln Park
course in San Francisco Friday after
noon. Lloyd Byerly and Charles McLean
tied for the low gross cup with 90's.
Byerly won the draw and with it the
prize.
A very strong wind added several
strokes to what would otherwise have
been creditable scores. The majority of
contestants had never played over the
course before and two had never
previously swung a club. Twenty-two
first-year men were entered.
