# STANFORD RELAYS ARE INNOVATION FOR TRACKMEN
## Event to Be Held Thursday on Varsity Oval; P. A. A. Set for May 17 
### 
"Dink" Templeton will give track
followers something new when he
stages his Stanford relay carnival on
the varsity oval Thursday afternoon. 1
The Stanford relays are being sub
stituted for the Far Western relays
which were to have been held at
Berkeley on Saturday but which were
cancelled. The best varsity team will
be selected in each event to run
against the next best team, which will
be given a handicap in order that the
race will be close.
The field men on the track squad
will also be given an opportunity for
a workout Thursday as they will take
part in a regulation field meet while
the runners are going through their
paces.
P. A. A. Next Week
As the relays and field events come
the week before the P. A. A., which j
is May 17, they will serve as a condi-1
tioner for the Stanford men. The var-1
sity will be entered in the P. A. A. as '
well as the best men from the fresh-j
man team.
It has been definitely decided that
the P. A. A. will be held in the sta- j
dium. Entries are being received until i
Friday, when the complete entry list
will be announced. It is expected that
California will enter the varsity men
who will make the trip to the I. C.
A. A. A. A. as well as several fresh
men. A strong array of athletes will
be entered by the Olympic club, and j
entries are also expected from the j
various athletic clubs around the bay, I
including the Italia Virtus, the Agne
tian club, and the Athens club.
Metric Distances Used
As the P. A. A. is serving as a pre-1
liminary tryout meet for the Olympic
games the events will be metric dis
tances, instead of the usual English
mesaurements. The races will include
the 100 and 200 metre dashes, and the
400, 880, 1500, 3000, and 6000 metre
runs. The six regular field events will
be included and also the hop, step, and
jump, and the hammer throw.
No Stanford entries have been an
nounced yet for either the relays or
the P. A. A. meet. The men who will,
comprise the teams in Thursday's
races will probably not be announced
until Wednesday.
