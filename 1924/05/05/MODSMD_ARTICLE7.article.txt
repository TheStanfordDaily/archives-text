# BASEBALLERS FROM MEIJI UNIVERSITY MEET VARSITY
## Wolter's Nine Will Play Post-Season Game Tomorrow Against Japanese 
### 
Fresh from its northern invasion,
the baseball nine representing the
Meiji University of Japan, arrives on
the campus tomorrow for a contest
with the Stanford varsity.
The island team lost a majority of
its games with the two colleges of
Washington and Oregon, but the
closeness of the scores indicates that
the Japanese have a clever outfit.
The Washington "Huskies" took
two battles from the invaders, the
first going ten innings to a 2-1 count,
and the second ending 5-1 in favor
of the Washington nine.
Against Gonzaga, Meiji participated
in a slugging match and took the short
end of a 9-8 count.
Japanese Beat Oregon
In their next game, with the Univer
sity of Oregon as opponents, the
islanders scored the first victory
against a college team, winning 9-8 in
a free-hitting struggle.
According to press reports, the vis
iting club has a very clever infield
and a bunch of hitters who, though
they do not hit the ball hard, hit it
often.
Stanford will probably take the field
with the same line-up as was used in
the California series.
The Japanese team will appear on
the diamond for the game, which is
scheduled for 3:30, as follows: Inaba,
3b; Nidegawa, rf; Kumaga, cf; Yuasa,
p; Daimon, c; Hayasha, ss; Smachi,
lb; Nakawaga, If; Yokozogagoo, 2b.
