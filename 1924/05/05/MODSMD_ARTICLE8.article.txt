# DR. JORDAN'S PORTRAIT TO BE ON EXHIBIT PERMANENTLY
## 
### 
"Room in the front gallery was recent
ly made for a portrait of Dr. Jordan,"
says John T. Lemos of the Stanford Art
Gallery. "The picture was painted by
Spencer Mackay, and has proved so
popular with both students and visitors
that it will remain on permanent display."
Collections are retained in the large
gallery at the entrance while those in the
other three galleries are changed every
few weeks, due to an understanding
when Thomas Welton Stanford, brother
of Senator Stanford donated the money
for the establishment of this gallery.
Some of the paintings belonging to his
own private collection were to be put
on permanent exhibition.
"The paintings placed in the front
room were all part of the Thomas Wel
ton collection, and while they are prac
tically all of the older school of paint
ing, some of them are well done tech
nically, and several are exceptional. Two
village scenes painted on wood panels
by the famous old Dutch master, Hob
benia, and dating back to 1700, are on
display.
"Two pictures that cause comment are
the portraits of Mr. and Mrs. Lincur.
While they are companion pictures, they
were painted by different artists, the one
of Mr. Lineur being painted by Moritz,
and the other by some unknown artist."
