"Designing in Masses''
THE new architecture transcends detail and expresses
the component solids of the great buildings of today
and tomorrow. Gigantic profiles are reared against the

into its own in architectural design, linking architect and
engineer ever more closely together.
Certainly modern invention—modern engineering skill
and organization, will prove more than equal to the
demands of the architecture of the future.
