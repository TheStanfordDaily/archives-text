### Donald Irving 
Theta Xi won the championship of
League Two yesterday by defeating
El Capitan 15 to 2 in the deciding
game of the series. The Theta Xi nine
•completely outclassed the club aggre
gation in all departments.
Delta Kappa Epsiion won from
Sigma N'u 7 to 2, and Breakers and
Chi Psi received forfeits from Delta
Tau Delta and Theta Delta Chi. In
an intramural game played Sunday,
Delta Kappa Epsiion nosed out Zeta
Psi 8 to 7.
Yesterday's contest was Theta Xi's
from the start. The Theta Xi nine
scored three runs in the first, five in
the third, and one in the fifth. In the
.sixth inning five more tallies were
chalked up, and another runner was
pushed across in the seventh.
Maillot did the heaving for Theta
Xi, and kept El Capitan scoreless for
six innings. Poor support in the last
period prevented him from turning in
a shut out. He allowed three hits, and
fanned twelve men.
The game threatened to break up in
a riot near the start, when the club
men protested a decision of the um
pire.
Dekes Win Another
The Deke-Sigma Nu game was
closely contested for the first four in
nings. In the fifth Aydelott, on the
mound for Sigma Nu, was hit for five
singles and a triple. Five runs were
scored before the third out was made.
The Dekes made one run in the
first. Sigma Nu tied the score in the
second, and then took the lead in the
fourth, when they scored again. The
runs made in the fifth by Delta Kappa
Epsiion put the game away.
