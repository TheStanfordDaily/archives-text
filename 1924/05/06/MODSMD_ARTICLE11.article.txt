# STANFORD BOXING TEAM FINISHES 1924 SEASON
## 
### Douglas Meservey 
With the Olympic Games boxing try
outs finished, the 1923-24 Stanford box
ing season has closed, after a fairly suc
cessful year. One intercollegiate meet
has been won and two lost, but two all-
University tournaments have been held
which have brought to liglit a number
of good prospects and aroused a greater
interest in the sport.
Coach Harry Maloney began this
year's program by staging a three-ring
circus on February 8 anufig the
wrestlers, fencers, and boxers—the latter
being the chief point of interest. Both
varsity and non-varsity men were eli
gible to enter in the seven divisions,
ranging from feathers to heavyweights,
the winners to be the likely opponents
for Davis Farm on February 14.
Cards Defeat Aggies
Following the three-ring circus a
week later, the Card fighters engaged
the California Aggies in Encina gym in

the first of two meets. Maloncy's squad
won, 5 to 1, after three knockouts had
added to the excitement—Martin knock
ing his man completely out and Tull of
Stanford and Millie of the Aggies being
given technical K. O's over their op
ponents.
In the return meet between Stanford
and Davis Farm, on March 7, the Aggies
showed up to better advantage by de
feating the Cardinals, 5 to 2.
Grizzlies Win, 4-3
Stanford's third meet of the season
was lost to the Southern Branch leather
pushers in Los Angeles on April 11, 4 to
3, Martin, Hall, and Robinson turning in
the three victories for the Card squad.
Maloney ended his program for the
year by holding a second, but larger, all-
University tournament, on April 16, the
winners of the nine divisions being de
clared 1024 boxing champions. Both
varsity and non-varsity men were al
lowed to enter and gold medals, donated
by former Cardinal title holders, were
given to the victors.
Captain "Jake" Irwin has headed the
Stanford squad well this season, being
downed only once (his first intercol
legiate defeat) by Wood of the Southern
Branch. Wood, a light heavy, had
trained down to middleweight and kept
Irwin stepping for three fast rounds.
Irwin was unable to fight in the second
Aggie meet because of poison oak, but
\vjpn over Barlow in the first one through
his aggressive attack. Irwin also beat
Adams of Stanford in the championship
tournament after a close four rounds,
thus annexing the junior middleweight
title.
Martin, a welter, has set a difficult
record to match by delivering three clean
knockouts this year in as many fights,
and all within a few minutes of the
opening gong. Goodman of S. B. U. C.,
Jensen of Davis Farm, and Captain Spill
man, also of Davis Farm, are the three
victims of Martin's well-directed blows.
Parsons Draws With Martin
Parsons, another Card welter and a
freshman, has fought two draws with
Martin, his .speed enabling him to keep
away from the latter's fists, although at
the same time he has never been able to
inflict any punishment on Martin. In a
third match in the recent championships,
Parsons was forced to leave the ring
in the middle of the second round be

cause of injured ribs, Martin getting the
decision.
Hall, in the welterweight division, is
the only other undefeated regular of the
squad, having won his two bouts of the
year. He was ineligible up to the spring
quarter and could enter only the South
ern Branch meet. Against the Grizzlies,
he had little trouble keeping Cassion on
the defensive most of the time, and in
the championship tourney defeated Mc-
Callister after four rounds of punish
ment for both men.
Van Hook Begins Well
Van Hook began the season well by
winning a hard bout over Kovecs of
Davis Farm in the first meet, but was ill
and could not light in the second match.
He lost to Farmin in the championship
bouts when the latter broke through his
defense with straight lefts to the jaw.
Farmin's only other fight this year was
his bout with Harris, in the first elimi
nation fights, which ended in a draw.
Robinson, a heavyweight, lost his first
bout in the return meet with the Aggies,
but came back strong in the Grizzly
bouts by downing Sergis with little
trouble. His coolness and experience
helped him win over Huneke for the
heavyweight title in the championship
tourney.
Harward has won and lost a pair of
fights this year, dropping one Aggie
bout and taking one by decision. He lost
at Los Angeles in the best fight of the
evening, and won the lightweight honors
over Goldwater in the title bouts.
Armbruster fought a draw with Burns
house of Davis in the first Aggie meet,

but lost his title of Pacific . Coast
featherweight champion to him in the
second. He also lost at Los Angeles.
Simmons, after losing to Millie of
Davis Farm, won the bantamweight title
in the championship fights by defeating
Freeman when the latter was knocked
down for the count of ten.

feating the Cardinals, 5 to 2.
Grizzlies Win, 4-3
Stanford's third meet of the season
was lost to the Southern Branch leather
pushers in Los Angeles on April 11, 4 to
3, Martin, Hall, and Robinson turning in
the three victories for the Card squad.
Maloney ended his program for the
year by holding a second, but larger, all-
University tournament, on April 16, the
winners of the nine divisions being de
clared 1024 boxing champions. Both
varsity and non-varsity men were al
lowed to enter and gold medals, donated
by former Cardinal title holders, were
given to the victors.
Captain "Jake" Irwin has headed the
Stanford squad well this season, being
downed only once (his first intercol
legiate defeat) by Wood of the Southern
Branch. Wood, a light heavy, had
trained down to middleweight and kept
Irwin stepping for three fast rounds.
Irwin was unable to fight in the second
Aggie meet because of poison oak, but
\vjpn over Barlow in the first one through
his aggressive attack. Irwin also beat
Adams of Stanford in the championship
tournament after a close four rounds,
thus annexing the junior middleweight
title.
Martin, a welter, has set a difficult
record to match by delivering three clean
knockouts this year in as many fights,
and all within a few minutes of the
opening gong. Goodman of S. B. U. C.,
Jensen of Davis Farm, and Captain Spill
man, also of Davis Farm, are the three
victims of Martin's well-directed blows.
Parsons Draws With Martin
Parsons, another Card welter and a
freshman, has fought two draws with
Martin, his .speed enabling him to keep
away from the latter's fists, although at
the same time he has never been able to
inflict any punishment on Martin. In a
third match in the recent championships,
Parsons was forced to leave the ring
in the middle of the second round be

cause of injured ribs, Martin getting the
decision.
Hall, in the welterweight division, is
the only other undefeated regular of the
squad, having won his two bouts of the
year. He was ineligible up to the spring
quarter and could enter only the South
ern Branch meet. Against the Grizzlies,
he had little trouble keeping Cassion on
the defensive most of the time, and in
the championship tourney defeated Mc-
Callister after four rounds of punish
ment for both men.
Van Hook Begins Well
Van Hook began the season well by
winning a hard bout over Kovecs of
Davis Farm in the first meet, but was ill
and could not light in the second match.
He lost to Farmin in the championship
bouts when the latter broke through his
defense with straight lefts to the jaw.
Farmin's only other fight this year was
his bout with Harris, in the first elimi
nation fights, which ended in a draw.
Robinson, a heavyweight, lost his first
bout in the return meet with the Aggies,
but came back strong in the Grizzly
bouts by downing Sergis with little
trouble. His coolness and experience
helped him win over Huneke for the
heavyweight title in the championship
tourney.
Harward has won and lost a pair of
fights this year, dropping one Aggie
bout and taking one by decision. He lost
at Los Angeles in the best fight of the
evening, and won the lightweight honors
over Goldwater in the title bouts.
Armbruster fought a draw with Burns
house of Davis in the first Aggie meet,

but lost his title of Pacific . Coast
featherweight champion to him in the
second. He also lost at Los Angeles.
Simmons, after losing to Millie of
Davis Farm, won the bantamweight title
in the championship fights by defeating
Freeman when the latter was knocked
down for the count of ten.
With the Olympic Games boxing try
outs finished, the 1923-24 Stanford box
ing season has closed, after a fairly suc
cessful year. One intercollegiate meet
has been won and two lost, but two all-
University tournaments have been held
which have brought to liglit a number
of good prospects and aroused a greater
interest in the sport.
Coach Harry Maloney began this
year's program by staging a three-ring
circus on February 8 anufig the
wrestlers, fencers, and boxers—the latter
being the chief point of interest. Both
varsity and non-varsity men were eli
gible to enter in the seven divisions,
ranging from feathers to heavyweights,
the winners to be the likely opponents
for Davis Farm on February 14.
Cards Defeat Aggies
Following the three-ring circus a
week later, the Card fighters engaged
the California Aggies in Encina gym in

the first of two meets. Maloncy's squad
won, 5 to 1, after three knockouts had
added to the excitement—Martin knock
ing his man completely out and Tull of
Stanford and Millie of the Aggies being
given technical K. O's over their op
ponents.

and all within a few minutes of the
opening gong. Goodman of S. B. U. C.,
Jensen of Davis Farm, and Captain Spill
man, also of Davis Farm, are the three
victims of Martin's well-directed blows.
Parsons Draws With Martin
Parsons, another Card welter and a
freshman, has fought two draws with
Martin, his .speed enabling him to keep
away from the latter's fists, although at
the same time he has never been able to
inflict any punishment on Martin. In a
third match in the recent championships,
Parsons was forced to leave the ring
in the middle of the second round be

cause of injured ribs, Martin getting the
decision.
Hall, in the welterweight division, is
the only other undefeated regular of the
squad, having won his two bouts of the
year. He was ineligible up to the spring
quarter and could enter only the South
ern Branch meet. Against the Grizzlies,
he had little trouble keeping Cassion on
the defensive most of the time, and in
the championship tourney defeated Mc-
Callister after four rounds of punish
ment for both men.
Van Hook Begins Well
Van Hook began the season well by
winning a hard bout over Kovecs of
Davis Farm in the first meet, but was ill
and could not light in the second match.
He lost to Farmin in the championship
bouts when the latter broke through his
defense with straight lefts to the jaw.
Farmin's only other fight this year was
his bout with Harris, in the first elimi
nation fights, which ended in a draw.
Robinson, a heavyweight, lost his first
bout in the return meet with the Aggies,
but came back strong in the Grizzly
bouts by downing Sergis with little
trouble. His coolness and experience
helped him win over Huneke for the
heavyweight title in the championship
tourney.
Harward has won and lost a pair of
fights this year, dropping one Aggie
bout and taking one by decision. He lost
at Los Angeles in the best fight of the
evening, and won the lightweight honors
over Goldwater in the title bouts.
Armbruster fought a draw with Burns
house of Davis in the first Aggie meet,

but lost his title of Pacific . Coast
featherweight champion to him in the
second. He also lost at Los Angeles.
Simmons, after losing to Millie of
Davis Farm, won the bantamweight title
in the championship fights by defeating
Freeman when the latter was knocked
down for the count of ten.
With the Olympic Games boxing try
outs finished, the 1923-24 Stanford box
ing season has closed, after a fairly suc
cessful year. One intercollegiate meet
has been won and two lost, but two all-
University tournaments have been held
which have brought to liglit a number
of good prospects and aroused a greater
interest in the sport.
Coach Harry Maloney began this
year's program by staging a three-ring
circus on February 8 anufig the
wrestlers, fencers, and boxers—the latter
being the chief point of interest. Both
varsity and non-varsity men were eli
gible to enter in the seven divisions,
ranging from feathers to heavyweights,
the winners to be the likely opponents
for Davis Farm on February 14.
Cards Defeat Aggies
Following the three-ring circus a
week later, the Card fighters engaged
the California Aggies in Encina gym in

the first of two meets. Maloncy's squad
won, 5 to 1, after three knockouts had
added to the excitement—Martin knock
ing his man completely out and Tull of
Stanford and Millie of the Aggies being
given technical K. O's over their op
ponents.
In the return meet between Stanford
and Davis Farm, on March 7, the Aggies
showed up to better advantage by de
feating the Cardinals, 5 to 2.
Grizzlies Win, 4-3
Stanford's third meet of the season
was lost to the Southern Branch leather
pushers in Los Angeles on April 11, 4 to
3, Martin, Hall, and Robinson turning in
the three victories for the Card squad.
Maloney ended his program for the
year by holding a second, but larger, all-
University tournament, on April 16, the
winners of the nine divisions being de
clared 1024 boxing champions. Both
varsity and non-varsity men were al
lowed to enter and gold medals, donated
by former Cardinal title holders, were
given to the victors.
Captain "Jake" Irwin has headed the
Stanford squad well this season, being
downed only once (his first intercol
legiate defeat) by Wood of the Southern
Branch. Wood, a light heavy, had
trained down to middleweight and kept
Irwin stepping for three fast rounds.
Irwin was unable to fight in the second
Aggie meet because of poison oak, but
\vjpn over Barlow in the first one through
his aggressive attack. Irwin also beat
Adams of Stanford in the championship
tournament after a close four rounds,
thus annexing the junior middleweight
title.
Martin, a welter, has set a difficult
record to match by delivering three clean
knockouts this year in as many fights,
and all within a few minutes of the
opening gong. Goodman of S. B. U. C.,
