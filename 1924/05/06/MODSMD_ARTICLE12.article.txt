# Warner Brothers' Circus To Enter Real Calliope In Junior Week Parade
## 
### 
The harmony of sound as well as
the beauty of color will figure largely
in the Junior Week Automobile Float
Parade Saturday afternoon; for a real
circus calliope will render the strains
of Boilersolin's March at the head of
the column of joy-makers. Through
the efforts of William L. Wright, the
Warner Brothers circus at San Jose
has consented to enter its music box
in the Junior Week Parade.
Many clever and original ideas for
floats have been sent in to the Junior
Committee by the various living
groups who are entering the contest,
according to Helen Broughall. How
ever, not half of the sixty eligible or
ganizations have responded as yet.
