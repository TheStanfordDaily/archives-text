A brief account of the Stanford Uni
versity collection of portraits of emi
nent naturalists written by Prof.
George J. Peirce of the Stanford Bot
any department is contained in a re
cent issue of "Science,"
The collection had its beginning in
the year of the earthquake in 1906.
A serious attempt has been made to
obtain engravings and prints of other
sorts, rather than photographs, whose
permanence in the strong light of this
climate is sometimes questionable.
Among the notable portraits hang
ing on the walls of thÂ§. library of
the department of botany, are.
of four generations of Darwi,us, a
beautiful engraved portrait of Ljn
naius, dated 1779, a engrav
ing of Humboldt, a ateel engraving of
Sir Joseph a portrait of Hux
ley, an artist proof wood engraving of
Asa Gray, u very line photograph of
W, T. Sedgwick, and an engraved por*
trait of Harvey which Sedgwick him
self bought at Oxford.
A number of these portraits are ex
ceedingly rare, and the collection is
increasing in value each year.
