# CHURCH ORGAN TO BE ENLARGED AND REBUILT THIS YEAR
## Plans for Improvement With Equipment Funds Made For This Summer 
### 
j Stanford University lias embarked
I upon a program of the rebuilding and
j enlargement of the organ in the Memo
j rial Church. Comptroller A. E. Roth,
: representing the University, is arranging
' with the Skinner Organ Company of
j Boston for extensive improvements of
j the organ during the summer and prepar-
I ing for future additions from time to
j time, as money is made available from
j the equipment funds of the University
or by gifts for this purpose.
The changes to be made during the
I summer will result in a vastly improved
| organ for the beginning of the next col
; lege year. The present three-manual
| console will be replaced by one of four
j manuals, which will contain provisions
for more than eighty stops, as is planned
for the organ when it is finally com
i pleted, instead of the fifty-two of the
present time. New actions will be in
installod for the old stops at once. A
small number of new pipes will be add
ed, and space will be provided for others
that are contemplated both inside and
outside the present swell-boxes. The
present swell-boxes will also be rear
ranged so as to bring some pipes Into
better position for reflection of their full
tone toward the choir and congregation
than is the case now, adding greatly to
the effectiveness of the present organ,
even if there were no other changes,
since some of the sctions are now very
unfavorably placed for throwing their
tone towards the choir and congregation.
New Parts from Skinner
The rebuilding of the swell-boxes and
the installation of the new equipment to
be sent from the Skinner factory will
be done by Schoenstein Brothers of San
Francisco. This work, Iwsides securing
increased effectiveness of the organ ac
coustically and greater flexibility of con
trol through the new console immediate
ly, will be the first step toward carrying
out the plans of Warren D. Allen, the
University organist, for a complete mod
ernization of the organ from a mechani
cal standpoint and tonal additions that
will make it thoroughly adequate for the
Memorial Church.
The new console will probably be the
largest west of Cleveland with the ex
ception of the one in the Municipal
Auditorium in San Francisco. It will
contain more than 100 stop-knobs for
the control, not only of the present or
gan. hut also of the instrument, as it will
be when finally completed. The acces
sories for the control of the registers
will comprise the most useful that the
ingenuity of the builder can devise; ad
justable pistons affecting all departments
of stops and couplers will enable the or
ganist to do much that is well-night im

possible on the present console.
Solo Organ to Be Installed
The crowning glory of the new organ
will eventually be the new solo organ, of
nine sets, containing some of the mod
ern tone for which Ernest M. Skinner,
the builder, has become so famous,
played from the fourth manual and the
new console. Three or four sets of or
chestral strings and flutes, the marvel
lously imitative French horn, English
horn, and bassoon, and a tuba mirabilis
of great power, will completely revolu
tionize the Stanford organ, and, com
bined with the beautiful tone of the old
instrument, make it in fact one of the
finest instruments to be heard anywhere.
