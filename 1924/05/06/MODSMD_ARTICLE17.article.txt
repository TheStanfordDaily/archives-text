# CHURCH ORGAN TO BE ENLARGED AND REBUILT THIS YEAR
## Plans for Improvement With Equipment Funds Made For This Summer 
### 
j Stanford University lias embarked
I upon a program of the rebuilding and
j enlargement of the organ in the Memo
j rial Church. Comptroller A. E. Roth,
: representing the University, is arranging
' with the Skinner Organ Company of
j Boston for extensive improvements of
j the organ during the summer and prepar-
I ing for future additions from time to
j time, as money is made available from
j the equipment funds of the University
or by gifts for this purpose.
The changes to be made during the
I summer will result in a vastly improved
| organ for the beginning of the next col

| console will be replaced by one of four
j manuals, which will contain provisions
for more than eighty stops, as is planned
for the organ when it is finally com
i pleted, instead of the fifty-two of the
present time. New actions will be in
installod for the old stops at once. A
small number of new pipes will be add
ed, and space will be provided for others
that are contemplated both inside and
outside the present swell-boxes. The
present swell-boxes will also be rear
ranged so as to bring some pipes Into
better position for reflection of their full
tone toward the choir and congregation
than is the case now, adding greatly to
the effectiveness of the present organ,
even if there were no other changes,
since some of the sctions are now very
unfavorably placed for throwing their
tone towards the choir and congregation.
New Parts from Skinner
The rebuilding of the swell-boxes and
the installation of the new equipment to
be sent from the Skinner factory will
be done by Schoenstein Brothers of San
Francisco. This work, Iwsides securing
