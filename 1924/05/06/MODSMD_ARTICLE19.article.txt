# An Important Matter
## 
### 
A story in the columns of yesterday's Daily Palo Alto announced new
plans for choosing a rally committee and the yell leader. At first glance
such an announcement may not seem very important.
However, the work done by the rally committee and yell leader this
year is ample proof that a great deal can be done in this line of activity. A
good yell leader, such as Stanford has been fortunate in having this year,
aided by a wide awake rally committee can accomplish a great deal of good.
Handling a rooting section is no easy matter. In the past, the yell
leader has been forced to rely entirely upon his assistants for help in plan
ning and putting on bleacher stunts. Under the new system, the yell
leader may expect assistance from a group of interested and trained stu
dents. This plan takes some of the worry and a great deal of the arduous
work away from the man who already has enough responsibilities.
The new system which is proposed differs but slightly from the plan
which has been carried out for the past year. The rally committee will
consist of old meml)ers who have proved themselves worthy and new
ones chosen by the president of the student body and the yell leader-elect
The finances of the organization will be handled by the A. S. S. U.
manager.
With this plan in use, the rally committee will be composed of students
who have either had experience on the body or those who have showed
interest in such work.
The purpose of the new method of choosing the yell leader and his
assistants is to remove the election as far as possible from politics. This
is, in itself, a very worthy aim. It is impossible to eliminate politics alto
gether from any student body election at Stanford. However, if trifling
politicians can be eliminated to a sufficient degree to assure the election of
the best man, a great work will have been accomplished.
With the rally committee cutting the squad of sophomore tryoutees
under the supervision of the Executive Committee, there is a good assur
ance that those chosen will be selected on the basis of merit. Two of the
six sophomores chosen will be elected to the position of assistant yell
leader at the regular spring election. The following spring, one of these
two will be made head yell leader at the Quad election.
The two plans outlined above seem to be the best available at the pres
ent time and if they are adopted, their work will be watched with interest.

gether from any student body election at Stanford. However, if trifling
politicians can be eliminated to a sufficient degree to assure the election of
the best man, a great work will have been accomplished.
With the rally committee cutting the squad of sophomore tryoutees
under the supervision of the Executive Committee, there is a good assur
ance that those chosen will be selected on the basis of merit. Two of the
six sophomores chosen will be elected to the position of assistant yell
leader at the regular spring election. The following spring, one of these
two will be made head yell leader at the Quad election.
The two plans outlined above seem to be the best available at the pres
ent time and if they are adopted, their work will be watched with interest.
