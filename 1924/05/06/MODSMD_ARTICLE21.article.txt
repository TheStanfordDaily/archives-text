# NESTORIANS CLASH WITH EUPHRONIANS OVER MELLON PLAN
## 
### 
Nestoria and Euphronia Literary so
cieties hold their annual inter-society
debate Wednesday at 7:30 in the Lit
tle Theatre.
The question under discussion is:
"Resolved, That the Mellon tax pro
posal should be adopted." Euphronia
defends the affirmative and Nestoria
the negative.
Will Be Twenty-Fifth Debate
The discussion Wednesday will be
the twenty-fifth clash between the two
societies. In every debate of which
the records are now extant, Euphronia
has been the victor.
The judges for the debate who have
been selected are: Edwin A. Cottrell
of the Political Science department,
and Benjamin Leroy Holland and Wil
liam B. Owens of the Law department.
Euphronia will be represented by
Bertram W. Levit, '24, and Richard L.
Jenkins, '24, both ex-varsity debaters.
Levit was on the Stanford team which
met the University of Southern Cali
fornia this winter. Jenkins was on the
varsity squad two years ago and was
selected for the Joffre squad this
spring.
The Nestoria representatives are
Emmet B. McCaffery, '24, and Victor
H. Harding, '25. McCaffery represented
Stanford against the University of
Oregon last year and was chosen to be
on the Joffre squad in 1924.
New Rebuttal System
The new varsity system of rebuttals
has been adopted. The affirmative will
thus have three rebuttals, instead of
two. The times will be five minutes
for the first two and three minutes for
the final. The negative will have two
six-minute refutation periods. In this
plan the affirmative is given one min
ute longer for refutation, while the
negative is given the last long rebut
tal period. The main speeches will be
fifteen minutes in length.
On May 30 the Euphronia team
plans to meet the Modesto Junior Col
lege, at Modesto, taking the same side
of the same question, the arrange
ments of details being practical!:' the
same as with Nestoria. The Nestoria
men are negotiating for a clash with
Sacramento Junior College for the first
of June, but definite arrangements
have not yet been made.
It has been the custom of Nestoria
to meet St. Ignatius College sometime
in the fall for an outside debate. This
year that was impossible and the Nes
toria men wish to substitute the con
test with Sacramento Junior College
for that of St. Ignatius.
It is probable that the same men
who represent their societies in the
intersociety debate will take part in
the outside contests.
