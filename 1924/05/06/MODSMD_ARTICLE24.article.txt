# SPORTS OF 1924
## Two Big League Umpires 
### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Ernie Quigley is a very good baseball umpire. He is au excellent football
official. He is a first-class basketball referee. Umpiring sports is his life
work, and he does it all year round. In 1922 Quigley umpired 161 baseball
games, 25 football contests and 109 basketball games* Do you know of any
one else who sees more sport In one year than this man? He also coaches
the St. Mary's, Kansas, football team, just to keep busy on off days, I suppose.
He has been with the National League for 10 years.
Harvard University, in selecting Quigley to officiate in the Harvard-Centre
game of 1921, paid Ernie a great compliment, for they knew that the Centre
coach, Charlie Moran, was one of Quigley's closest friends, yet that would not
prejudice Quigley in his decisions during the game.
Hank O'Day is so used to hostile demonstrations by players and crowds
that they don't bother him in the slightest way. He's been umpiring in the
National League for 25 years, that's why. Hank is one of the few star
players to make good as an umpire, and because he used to be a big league
pitcher, he is especially good at calling balls and strikes.
