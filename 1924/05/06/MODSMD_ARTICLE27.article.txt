# SPRING FOOTBALL PRACTICE BRINGS OUT ADDITIONAL VARSITY GRIDIRON MATERIAL
## 
### 
With the conclusion of the spring
practice, football uniforms are being
packed away in the moth balls until
next autmn. Last Friday marked the
final practice session of the spring
season.
"The most successful spring foot
ball season since I have been con
nected with Stanford athletics," is the
way in which Coach "Pop" Warner
characterizes this year's spring foot
ball.
During the season, which lasted for
five weeks, an average of eighty-five
men were out on the field each night.
The first part of the practice was de
voted mainly to fundamentals, while
signal practice and scrimmage was in
dulged in freely the last three weeks.
As a result of the practice, much new
material and several promising candi
dates for next year's varsity were
brought to light, according to "Pop."
"The spring season is not so much
for the old men," says Warner, "with
varsity experience already, as it was
to furnish an opportunity for new men
to show up, men who have little op
portunity in the regular fall practice.
I believe that I have found three or
four entirely new prospects, outside
of this year's freshman team, who will
bear watching in the fall."
The greatest wealth of material that
Stanford has known since it re-adopted
American football will be on hand in
| the fall for Coaches Warner, Kerr, and
Thornhill to mould into a team with
which the Cardinals hope to walk off
with the Coast Championship.
For the fullback position, there will
be "Ernie" Nevers, Ail-American and
All-Coast back, whom it will take
nothing short of an incollapsible brick
wall to stop next fall, and Solomon,
and Bogue, from this year's freshman
team. Both Solomon and Bogue are
able substitutes to Nevers.
Warner will have to develop a new
man for quarter, but with three such
candidates to pick from as Dick Law
son, "Mugs" Mitchell, and Baldwin, of
the freshmen, he should not find him
self confronted with a very difficult
task. Although Campbell's loss will
probably be felt in the first games, by !
the end of the season the Cardinals
should be as well fortified at the quar
-1 terback position as it ever was. All
these three men have great possibili
ties for further development.
One of the greatest aggregations of
halfbacks that has ever been out for
a Cardinal eleven will be on hand in
the fall. Cleaveland, Wheat, Dennis,
and Cuddeback, of this year's varsity,
will be back. In addition, a number of I
excellent prospects from the frosh are j
coming up. These are Herth, Garth
waite, Hyland, Trombetto, Moore, and
Phillips. Any one of these is likely to
make a place on the team. As h result
of the spring practice Herth looks to
be the most likely prospect. He weighs
180 pounds, is very fast on his feet, !
and has had a good deal of experience, i
He and Cleaveland would be a hard 1
pair of halves to stop. Herth is; also
a good man defensively.
For the end positions the regular
last season's ends, Jim Lawson and
A. B. Thomas, will be back. If either
of these men have to drop out as a
result of injuries four other high-class

>wing men will be ready to step into
their places. They are Middleton and
Dole, of last season's varsity squad, in
themselves two of the best end pros
pects on the coast. Both are big, fast,
and understand the game thoroughly.
Then there will be Ted Shipkey and
Wilbur Adams, two of the ablest ends
that aver graceh a Stanford frosh
eleven, on hand also to fight for a
position. This makes three pairs of
ends, any one of which could take the
field and hold their own with any
other pair of ends on the coast.
"Chuck" Johnson and Harry Ship
key, last season the best pair of tack
les on the coast, will be back again
next fall, and with an additional sea
son of experience behind them, should
mow down their opponents. Every
eleven that the Cardinals play next
fall will be watching out for Johnson
and Shipkey.
The guard positions present more
of a problem. With Faville and Cra
vens gone, Warner will have to re
place them with two men. At the pres
ent time it looks as though Bob Hunt
and Rafetto, of this year's freshman
team, will be used in the guard posi
tions. Rafetto was a tackle on the
frosh eleven, but his weight, 230
pounds, should not stand him in bad
stead at guard.
The center job will be well fortified
with George Baker back, and Price and
Natcher, of the freshman team, to fight
for the job. Fred Price is a center
who can be expected to hold his own
in any company. His record on the
frosh team show him to be one of the
best center prospects that has come
to Stanford since the days of "Dud"
DeGroot. Natcher shines in passing
the ball, at which occupation he is one
of the most accurate centers on the
squad. Bob Hunt, if he is not used at
guard, may be used at center part of
the time, as he was Baker's under
study during the past season.
"There will be so much material on
hand next fall," Says Warner, "that
no one will be certain of his job.
Every man will have to be out there
fighting all the time."

Ore containing 76 per cent platinum
is reported to have been discovered
along the River Biely, a tributary to the
Anadyr River. This region is in the
extreme portion of Siberia at about the
-same latitude as Alaska.

Dole, of last season's varsity squad, in
themselves two of the best end pros
pects on the coast. Both are big, fast,
and understand the game thoroughly.
Then there will be Ted Shipkey and
Wilbur Adams, two of the ablest ends
that aver graceh a Stanford frosh
eleven, on hand also to fight for a
position. This makes three pairs of
ends, any one of which could take the
field and hold their own with any
other pair of ends on the coast.
"Chuck" Johnson and Harry Ship
key, last season the best pair of tack
les on the coast, will be back again
next fall, and with an additional sea
son of experience behind them, should
mow down their opponents. Every
eleven that the Cardinals play next
fall will be watching out for Johnson
and Shipkey.
The guard positions present more
of a problem. With Faville and Cra
vens gone, Warner will have to re
place them with two men. At the pres
ent time it looks as though Bob Hunt
and Rafetto, of this year's freshman
team, will be used in the guard posi
tions. Rafetto was a tackle on the
frosh eleven, but his weight, 230
pounds, should not stand him in bad
stead at guard.
The center job will be well fortified
with George Baker back, and Price and
Natcher, of the freshman team, to fight
for the job. Fred Price is a center
who can be expected to hold his own
in any company. His record on the
frosh team show him to be one of the
best center prospects that has come
to Stanford since the days of "Dud"
DeGroot. Natcher shines in passing
the ball, at which occupation he is one
of the most accurate centers on the
squad. Bob Hunt, if he is not used at
guard, may be used at center part of
the time, as he was Baker's under
study during the past season.
"There will be so much material on
hand next fall," Says Warner, "that
no one will be certain of his job.
Every man will have to be out there
fighting all the time."

With the conclusion of the spring
practice, football uniforms are being
packed away in the moth balls until
next autmn. Last Friday marked the
final practice session of the spring
season.
"The most successful spring foot
ball season since I have been con
nected with Stanford athletics," is the
way in which Coach "Pop" Warner
characterizes this year's spring foot
ball.
During the season, which lasted for
five weeks, an average of eighty-five
men were out on the field each night.
The first part of the practice was de
voted mainly to fundamentals, while
signal practice and scrimmage was in
dulged in freely the last three weeks.
As a result of the practice, much new
material and several promising candi
dates for next year's varsity were
brought to light, according to "Pop."
"The spring season is not so much
for the old men," says Warner, "with
varsity experience already, as it was
to furnish an opportunity for new men
to show up, men who have little op
portunity in the regular fall practice.
I believe that I have found three or
four entirely new prospects, outside
of this year's freshman team, who will
bear watching in the fall."
The greatest wealth of material that
Stanford has known since it re-adopted
American football will be on hand in
| the fall for Coaches Warner, Kerr, and
Thornhill to mould into a team with
which the Cardinals hope to walk off
with the Coast Championship.
For the fullback position, there will
be "Ernie" Nevers, Ail-American and
All-Coast back, whom it will take
nothing short of an incollapsible brick
wall to stop next fall, and Solomon,
and Bogue, from this year's freshman
team. Both Solomon and Bogue are
able substitutes to Nevers.
Warner will have to develop a new
man for quarter, but with three such
candidates to pick from as Dick Law
son, "Mugs" Mitchell, and Baldwin, of
the freshmen, he should not find him
self confronted with a very difficult
task. Although Campbell's loss will
probably be felt in the first games, by !
the end of the season the Cardinals
should be as well fortified at the quar
-1 terback position as it ever was. All
these three men have great possibili
ties for further development.
One of the greatest aggregations of
halfbacks that has ever been out for
a Cardinal eleven will be on hand in
the fall. Cleaveland, Wheat, Dennis,
and Cuddeback, of this year's varsity,
will be back. In addition, a number of I
excellent prospects from the frosh are j
coming up. These are Herth, Garth
waite, Hyland, Trombetto, Moore, and
Phillips. Any one of these is likely to
make a place on the team. As h result
of the spring practice Herth looks to
be the most likely prospect. He weighs
180 pounds, is very fast on his feet, !
and has had a good deal of experience, i
He and Cleaveland would be a hard 1
pair of halves to stop. Herth is; also
a good man defensively.
For the end positions the regular
last season's ends, Jim Lawson and
A. B. Thomas, will be back. If either
of these men have to drop out as a
result of injuries four other high-class

>wing men will be ready to step into
their places. They are Middleton and
Dole, of last season's varsity squad, in
themselves two of the best end pros

four entirely new prospects, outside
of this year's freshman team, who will
bear watching in the fall."
The greatest wealth of material that
Stanford has known since it re-adopted
American football will be on hand in
| the fall for Coaches Warner, Kerr, and
Thornhill to mould into a team with
which the Cardinals hope to walk off
with the Coast Championship.
For the fullback position, there will
be "Ernie" Nevers, Ail-American and
All-Coast back, whom it will take
nothing short of an incollapsible brick
wall to stop next fall, and Solomon,
and Bogue, from this year's freshman
team. Both Solomon and Bogue are
able substitutes to Nevers.
Warner will have to develop a new
man for quarter, but with three such
candidates to pick from as Dick Law
son, "Mugs" Mitchell, and Baldwin, of
the freshmen, he should not find him
self confronted with a very difficult
task. Although Campbell's loss will
probably be felt in the first games, by !
the end of the season the Cardinals
should be as well fortified at the quar
-1 terback position as it ever was. All
these three men have great possibili
ties for further development.
One of the greatest aggregations of
halfbacks that has ever been out for
a Cardinal eleven will be on hand in
the fall. Cleaveland, Wheat, Dennis,
and Cuddeback, of this year's varsity,
will be back. In addition, a number of I
excellent prospects from the frosh are j
coming up. These are Herth, Garth
waite, Hyland, Trombetto, Moore, and
Phillips. Any one of these is likely to
make a place on the team. As h result
of the spring practice Herth looks to
be the most likely prospect. He weighs
180 pounds, is very fast on his feet, !
and has had a good deal of experience, i
He and Cleaveland would be a hard 1
pair of halves to stop. Herth is; also
a good man defensively.
For the end positions the regular
last season's ends, Jim Lawson and
A. B. Thomas, will be back. If either
of these men have to drop out as a
result of injuries four other high-class

>wing men will be ready to step into
their places. They are Middleton and
Dole, of last season's varsity squad, in
themselves two of the best end pros
pects on the coast. Both are big, fast,
and understand the game thoroughly.
Then there will be Ted Shipkey and
Wilbur Adams, two of the ablest ends
that aver graceh a Stanford frosh
eleven, on hand also to fight for a
position. This makes three pairs of
ends, any one of which could take the
field and hold their own with any
other pair of ends on the coast.
"Chuck" Johnson and Harry Ship
key, last season the best pair of tack
les on the coast, will be back again
next fall, and with an additional sea
son of experience behind them, should
mow down their opponents. Every
eleven that the Cardinals play next
fall will be watching out for Johnson
and Shipkey.
The guard positions present more
of a problem. With Faville and Cra
vens gone, Warner will have to re
place them with two men. At the pres
ent time it looks as though Bob Hunt
and Rafetto, of this year's freshman
team, will be used in the guard posi
tions. Rafetto was a tackle on the
frosh eleven, but his weight, 230
pounds, should not stand him in bad
stead at guard.
The center job will be well fortified
with George Baker back, and Price and
Natcher, of the freshman team, to fight
for the job. Fred Price is a center
who can be expected to hold his own
in any company. His record on the
frosh team show him to be one of the
best center prospects that has come
to Stanford since the days of "Dud"
DeGroot. Natcher shines in passing
the ball, at which occupation he is one
of the most accurate centers on the
squad. Bob Hunt, if he is not used at
guard, may be used at center part of
the time, as he was Baker's under
study during the past season.
"There will be so much material on
hand next fall," Says Warner, "that
no one will be certain of his job.
Every man will have to be out there
fighting all the time."

With the conclusion of the spring
practice, football uniforms are being
packed away in the moth balls until
next autmn. Last Friday marked the
final practice session of the spring
season.
"The most successful spring foot
ball season since I have been con
nected with Stanford athletics," is the
way in which Coach "Pop" Warner
characterizes this year's spring foot
ball.
During the season, which lasted for
five weeks, an average of eighty-five
men were out on the field each night.
The first part of the practice was de
voted mainly to fundamentals, while
signal practice and scrimmage was in
dulged in freely the last three weeks.
As a result of the practice, much new
material and several promising candi
dates for next year's varsity were
brought to light, according to "Pop."
"The spring season is not so much
for the old men," says Warner, "with
varsity experience already, as it was
to furnish an opportunity for new men
to show up, men who have little op
portunity in the regular fall practice.
I believe that I have found three or
four entirely new prospects, outside
of this year's freshman team, who will
bear watching in the fall."
