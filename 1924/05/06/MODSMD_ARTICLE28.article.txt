### 
Decorations for the Junior Prom are
progressing rapidly with the inspira
tion of dance music every evening for
half an hour to aid juniors in hteir
work in the basketball pavilion.
Juniors are exerting every effort to
carry out the plans for the art work
on a frieze of painted silhouettes, un
der the supervision of Ellen Callender
and her committee including Meribeth
Cameron, Elizabeth Roper, and Mabel
McKibbon.
Women and men of the class are
asked to help every afternoon from
1 to 6 and every evening between 7
and 10.
Construction work is under the su
pervision of Robert Myers, assisted by
Lafe Brown, Harry Noland, John Hall,
and Paul Sievers.
On Saturday a squad of tep men
put in the wires to support the false
ceiling, but more of the class of '25
is urged to attend the daily meetings.
