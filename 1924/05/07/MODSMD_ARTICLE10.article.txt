# Bigger, Better Fires Needed on Campus for Student Entertainment
## 
### 
Fire-hunters on the campus were
again disappointed at noon by a small
grass fire that started at the intersec
tion of the path that runs from the
Geology corner to Sequoia and the
road that runs a few hundred feet
west of the hall.
The fire was put out by Fire Chief
Dugan and an assistant armed with
wet gunnysacks. No harm was done
although the blaze endangered the
botany greenhouse. The fire was prob
ably caused by a cigarette in the dry
grass. "What the campus needs is
'bigger and better fires'."
