# FAST TIMES EXPECTED IN RELAYS TOMORROW
## Coach Templeton's Varsity Runners Oppose Other Teams at Handicap 
### 
Some fast races are promised track
fans at 4:30 tomorrow afternoon when
Coach "Dink" Templeton puts his var
sity runners through their paces in
the first Stanford relays.
The meet will be absolutely informal
and no teams will be picked until to
morrow. However, the varsity runners
will compose the first team and com
petition will be provided for them by
a second team which will be given a
handicap. The men on the second team
will be tracksters who happen to be
around at the time of the events.
To Be Four Relays
Tentative plans call for four relays,
the half-mile, the mile, two-mile, and
four-mile. Most of the field men will be
on hand to get in a little practice in
their respective events before the P.
A. A. meet, a week from Saturday.
Every Stanford man who wishes
may enter the P. A. A. meet whether
he be a freshman or varsity athlete.
All of the varsity men who are still
in training will be entered.
It looks as if the P. A. A. will de
velop into a three-cornered struggle
for first honors. The Olympic Club is
expected to send down a strong ag
gregation, California will probably
enter the men who will represent the
Blue and Gold at the I. C. A. A. A. A.,
and the Redshirts will be on deck to
give both of them plenty of competi
tion.
As yet no action has been taken on
the suggested trip of the Cardinal
tracksters to the I. C. A. A. A. A. It
is probable tht the Board of Athletic
Control will give its consent, but no
plans can be made yet regarding the
number of men who will be taken
East.
The men who have the best chance
of going are: Hale and Campbell in
the sprints; Miller, Storie, and Judah
in the quarter; Richardson and Mc
intosh in the half mile; Kerr. Smith,
and Elliott in the mile; Charles in the
two mile; Leistner in the hurdles;
Hartranft and Arthur in the weights;
Ludeke in the hammer; and Anderson
in the high jump.
