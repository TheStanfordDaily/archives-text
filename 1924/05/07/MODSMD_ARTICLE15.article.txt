# JAPANESE DEFEAT VARSITY IN TENTH INNING RALLY, 4-3
## Yokozawa's Double in Last Stanza Paves Way for Winning Tally 
### 
Meiji University's ball team came
all the way from Japan to show the
Stanford varsity how America's na
tional game should be played, and
defeated the Cards 4 to 3 in a ten
inning battle.
After coming from behind and tying
the score in the ninth, the visitors
knocked in the winning run in the
next stanza.
Yokozawa, first man up for Meiji,
found Oviatt for a two-base hit and
the latter was jerked in favor of Milt
Teague. lnaba sacrificed Yokozawa to
third.
Meiji's right fielder, Idegawa, laid a
perfect bunt in front of the plate and
beat it out to first, Yokozawa scoring.
Idegawa stole second and third but
died there when the next two men
went out.
The Japanese were first to score,
pushing two runs over in the third.
Nakagawa reached first on a fielder's
choice and got to second on Mulchay's
error. Yokozawa duplicated Naka
gawa's method of getting on and both
men advanced on a passed ball. Inaba
singled, scoring the two runners.
The Cards came back in their half
of the third and counted once when
Cuddeback doubled, went to third
when Oviatt was out on an infield
grounder, and scored on Woodward's
single.
Two more were added to Stanford's
total in the sixth. Johnston singled
over third and took second when Mc-
Candless was safe on an error by the
Meiji first baseman. "Lefty" May
socked one into right field and both
Johnston and McCandless scored.
Amachi, the visitors' catcher, came
in for a big cheer from the stands
when he snagged Mulchay's foul fly in
the fourth after a strenuous run. His
accomplishment of the seemingly im
possible spurred "Chuck" Johnston,
the Card backstop, into doing the
same thing in the next inning. "Chuck"
didn't have quite so far to run but
he had more weight to carry around
so his feat was worthy of as much
praise.
The Japanese team played a smart
game of ball all through the game
and showed why they are champions
of the island empire.
Oviatt hurled a nice game until the
start of the tenth, but an extra effort
found him just a little too tired.

singled, scoring the two runners.
The Cards came back in their half
of the third and counted once when
Cuddeback doubled, went to third
when Oviatt was out on an infield
grounder, and scored on Woodward's
single.
Two more were added to Stanford's
total in the sixth. Johnston singled
over third and took second when Mc-
Candless was safe on an error by the
Meiji first baseman. "Lefty" May
socked one into right field and both
Johnston and McCandless scored.
Amachi, the visitors' catcher, came
in for a big cheer from the stands
when he snagged Mulchay's foul fly in
the fourth after a strenuous run. His
accomplishment of the seemingly im
possible spurred "Chuck" Johnston,
the Card backstop, into doing the
same thing in the next inning. "Chuck"
didn't have quite so far to run but
he had more weight to carry around
so his feat was worthy of as much
praise.
The Japanese team played a smart
game of ball all through the game
and showed why they are champions
of the island empire.
Oviatt hurled a nice game until the
start of the tenth, but an extra effort
found him just a little too tired.
