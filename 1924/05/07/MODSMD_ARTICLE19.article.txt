### 
Under the above head, the Daily Palo Alto will publish from time to
time, short sketches of prominent men and women about the campus. The
aim in this group of comments will be to acquaint the students with those
who are doing most, in the opinion of the Daily, for Stanford University.
Leaders in every line of activity will be considered. Men and women
alike will be mentioned, and reasons given for their selection.
The Daily Palo Alto believes that there are many students on the Stan
ford campus who deserve a great deal of credit for the things they are
doing to put Stanford to the front in various lines of activity. It is
through the efforts of these leaders that the University's reputation is up
held not only in the United States, but all over the world.
The Daily is satisfied that those whose names will appear in this column
are deserving of everything that is said of them. If any names are omitted
which, in the minds of the students, should be included, the Daily Palo
Alto is sorry.
An unbiased and unprejudiced stand will be taken and it will be the
earnest effort of the writer of these comments to maintain this attitude
throughout.
