# Paul Davis, Graduate Manager
## 
### 
First of all, the Daily doffs its hat to the above named gentleman, the
most efficient graduate manager Stanford has ever been fortunate enough
to secure.
Davis' work, in two years at his important post, has proved him
worthy of this tribute. He looks ahead, far into the future, something
that no other graduate manager has done successfully. His ground plan
carries the University's'athletic expansion program fifteen years into the
future. All his time is not spent in planning, however.
He brought to his position a combination of engineering and execu
tive ability which he has used to good advantage. He has put the finan
cial side of the graduate manager's office on a sound basis through the in
troduction of a budget system which has proved thoroughly satisfactory.
Davis' merit is well proved by the fact that he has the absolute confi
dence of the Board of Athletic Control, something of which few men in
his position have been able to l>oast. His ability to choose men who can
accomplish things, for his assistants has aided him a great deal in his work.
Some men, who can accomplish big things, fair down in routine mat
ters. Not so with Davis. Small matters, which are none the less im
portant because they are small, receive his attention along with his heavier
duties.
In all his work, which at times involves his taking steps, the wisdom
of which is not apparent to the students, he has maintained his popularity.
He is always willing to listen to reason and does not try to railroad his
own ideas through.
Stanford University is fortunate, indeed, in having a man like Davis,
under contract for three years. He has established friendly relations with
all the leading daily newspapers in this vicinity and his stay in his present
position will undoubtedly be beneficial to the University and all those who
are connected either directly or indirectly with it.
