THE PLEDGING OF LAURA.
A feast for Sore Eyesâ€”By 200
Cabbages @ 75c per head.
Enter the Priestesses, leaders hold
ing the sack. They peerade in a portly
manner to the altar. Once there, they
do a Hatfield. Light the railroad fus
see. No Skyrocket. No rain. Music:
"Precipitation hath ceased indefinite
ly, but how are the forefathers to be
informed?"
Tabaccus and followers appear from
behind the wall, waving Eucalyptus
shrubs, wearing goat feathers. Wild,
aboriginal cavortings. Tabaccussite
does a slide for home plate. Cheers
from the multitude.
What ho! An orchard. Applle and
cohorts appear. Music! "So This Is
Eden." Applies and Tabaccusites pull
a relay. Wind makes a clean sweep
ot the meet.
Straightforth Tabaccus plays a flute
solo, "Carolina Mammy, I'm Daphne
About You." (Applause.) Applle: "Say
kid, you don't rate. Hood River, bring
me my harpie." Tabaccuss: "! ! !"
Solo by Applle: "What Newton Didn't
Know."
Simolious, the king, crowns Applle.
Shot-putters appear. Tiny outclassed.
Great joy in the court. Simolious exits,
half stooping as he runs across back
stage. Think you were hiding, kid?
Bearded lady appears (courtesy of
Barnum). Incidental music by steam
calliope. Let Warren D. try to con
sole it. Old lady shows the white
feather. Applle tries another Hatfield,
calling on the rainbow sprites to help
him out. Audience offers to assist.
Enter Cupid, challenging Applle to a
William Tell. Applle refers the matter
to the Council, in the meantime falling
in love with his secretary.
Scene: The Chase. Characters:
Applle, the chaser. Secretary, the
chasee. Cupid's arrowroots hold arch
ery contest. Batting average .000.
Cupid makes a hit with a dart of hate.
Applle spurned, cut to the core.
Music: "Nobody's Sweetheart." Enter
the Laura maidens, and 10, there is a
tree where but a stick did stand.
Exit march: "T'hell, t'hell, t'hell
with the ten o'clock rule."
Moral: "Be sure you're right, then
sign the paper. Cash in advance."
Well, how did you expect to know
what it was all about if you didn't buy
a program.
