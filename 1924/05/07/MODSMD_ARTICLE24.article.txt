# MOVING PICTURES AID MASSACHUSETTS R. O. T. C
## 
### 
R. O. T. C. Infantry men are taught
the loading and shooting of a rifle, the
manual of arms, and the school of
the squad, by moving pictures in the
Massachusetts schools. The entire
class counts in cadence as the men
on the screen execute the manual of
arms. This method gives the students
an opportunity to observe the manual
of arms and correct their own errors.
