# CARDINAL FENCING TEAMS COMPLETE SUCCESSFUL SEASON
## 
### H. W. Dryden 
Fencing at Stanford has enjoyed one
of the most successful seasons since
Harry Maloney introduced it to the
Stanford campus in the schedule con
cluded April 15. Card swordsmen won
both first and second places in the in
dividual championships of the North
Pacifiic Coast section of the Amateur
Fencing League of America, held at
San Francisco on that date.
Stanford produced a fencing wizard
three years ago in Carl Sandrette who
won the Pacifiic Coast championship.
Last year Stanford held its own with
the organizations with which it com
peted. But this year Stanford demon
strated beyond a doubt that as far as
fencing goes it is the peer of Pacific
Coast colleges.
Under the expert coaching and super
vision of Harry Maloney, fencing has
come to be a popular Stanford minor
sport and is claiming more adherents
annually. The past year, in addition to
the regular coaching of the varsity
fencers, Maloney has conducted gymna-.
slum classes in fencing and large num
bers of men signed up for the sport.
This has brought to light a number of
promising candidates for next year's
varsity, who will be needed inasmuch
as three of the men on this year's team
will be ineligible for competition next
season.
The fencing season began in the win
ter quarter with a local tournament to
determine the men to make up the var
sity squad. The men chosen were Ken- 1
neth Gardner, who was elected cap
tain; Elwyn Bugge, Scott Smith, Jack
Wallace, and Michel de Cazotte.
The first major meet of the season
was the intercollegiate fencing tourna
ment with the University of California
in March. This meet resulted in an
overwhelming victory for the Card rep
resentatives, the final score being:
Stanford, 20 bouts; California, 5. This
was the fourth straight win for Stan
ford in fencing over California. In this
contest the Card fencers demonstrated
complete superiority over the Berkeley
representatives, who showed lack of
coaching and experience.
Cards Enter Coast Championship.
Following the meet with California
the Card fencers practiced for the
major event of the coast fencing sea
son, the fencing championships of the
North Pacific Coast section of the
Amateur Fencing League of America,
held at the Olympic Club in San Fran
cisco the night of April 15. In this
meet Stanford not only won first and
second individual honors, but also cap
tured the team championship. The or
ganizations participating were the
Olympic Club, Italia Virtus, Unione
Italia Sportiva, and Stanford. The
meet was declared to have brought out
the best fencing seen on the coast for
many seasons. Elwyn Bugge won first
place, and Michel de Cazotte took sec
ond. . »
"I am well satisfied with the showing
made by our men during the past sea
son," says Harry Maloney. "We are
planning a larger schedule for next
year. The rest of this year I am going
to devote to developing new material
since three of this year's team will not
be back next fall."

North Pacific Coast section of the
Amateur Fencing League of America,
held at the Olympic Club in San Fran
cisco the night of April 15. In this
meet Stanford not only won first and
second individual honors, but also cap
tured the team championship. The or
ganizations participating were the
Olympic Club, Italia Virtus, Unione
Italia Sportiva, and Stanford. The
meet was declared to have brought out
the best fencing seen on the coast for
many seasons. Elwyn Bugge won first

"I am well satisfied with the showing
made by our men during the past sea
son," says Harry Maloney. "We are
planning a larger schedule for next
year. The rest of this year I am going
to devote to developing new material
since three of this year's team will not
be back next fall."
Fencing at Stanford has enjoyed one
of the most successful seasons since
Harry Maloney introduced it to the
Stanford campus in the schedule con
cluded April 15. Card swordsmen won
both first and second places in the in
dividual championships of the North
Pacifiic Coast section of the Amateur
Fencing League of America, held at
San Francisco on that date.
Stanford produced a fencing wizard
three years ago in Carl Sandrette who
won the Pacifiic Coast championship.
Last year Stanford held its own with
the organizations with which it com
peted. But this year Stanford demon
strated beyond a doubt that as far as
fencing goes it is the peer of Pacific
Coast colleges.
Under the expert coaching and super
vision of Harry Maloney, fencing has
come to be a popular Stanford minor
sport and is claiming more adherents
annually. The past year, in addition to
the regular coaching of the varsity
fencers, Maloney has conducted gymna-.
slum classes in fencing and large num
bers of men signed up for the sport.
This has brought to light a number of
promising candidates for next year's
varsity, who will be needed inasmuch
as three of the men on this year's team
will be ineligible for competition next
season.
The fencing season began in the win
ter quarter with a local tournament to
determine the men to make up the var
sity squad. The men chosen were Ken- 1
neth Gardner, who was elected cap
tain; Elwyn Bugge, Scott Smith, Jack
Wallace, and Michel de Cazotte.
The first major meet of the season
was the intercollegiate fencing tourna
ment with the University of California
in March. This meet resulted in an
overwhelming victory for the Card rep
resentatives, the final score being:
Stanford, 20 bouts; California, 5. This
was the fourth straight win for Stan
ford in fencing over California. In this
contest the Card fencers demonstrated
complete superiority over the Berkeley
representatives, who showed lack of
coaching and experience.
Cards Enter Coast Championship.
Following the meet with California
the Card fencers practiced for the
major event of the coast fencing sea
son, the fencing championships of the
North Pacific Coast section of the
Amateur Fencing League of America,
held at the Olympic Club in San Fran
