# Lane Medical Library Is Lauded in "Health News"

### 
The Alameda County Public Health
News, in the publication widely dis
tributed by the Public Health Center
of Alameda County in its April issue,
has the following about the collection
on the history of medicine in the Lane
Medical library of the Stanford Medi
cal School:
"Very valuable and extremely in
teresting is the historical medical col
lection that has recently been ac
quired by Lane Library. Another
world opens before one as case after
case of wonderful books bearing dates
from 1437 upward appear to view, and
the realization comes that, barring
accidents, these books will not only
outlast us, but also all our modern
libraries of paper-printed volumes. Our
present-day braggadocio dies away at
the sight of Vesalius' Anatomy, for
example, a ponderous tome with its
wooden backs hinged with leather and
fastened with brass clasps, its velvety
parchment pages with clear printing
and beautiful hand illuminated letter
ing, and its excellent drawings of
anatomical figures artistically posed
against attractive landscapes. It ip all
most fascinatingâ€”only a visit will do
this collection justice."
