### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
The American marathon team, headed by Clarence de Mar, who last month
broke the world's record for the 26-mile grind, sails this week-end for France
to try to win that event for America in the coming Olympics. The only time
that an American ever finished first in this race —the classic competition of
each Olympiad—was when Hicks won at the St. Louis games in 1904, and
there was little foreign competition at the time. An American won again in
1908 at the London games, but only after the Italian Dorondo, who finished
first, was disqualified.
Dorando Pietri, as game an Italian as ever lived, entered the stadium at the
end of his 26-mile run and started to walk to the finish line some 400 yards
away. His worn-out muscles would not respond to his will, however, and he
collapsed on the track. Helping hands lifted him to his feet and again he
struggled on, only to collapse once more. Another heroic effort—for he really
was in a pitiful condition —and he sank again on the cinderpath. A cry went
up—"An American," and the eyes of the crowd turned to the entrance where
Johnny Hayes was trotting into the stadium. Dorando was helped the rest
of the distance to the tape by the clerk of the course. There was nothing else
to do but to disqualify him, however, as a competitor must finish a race alone
and unaided. Thus Johnny Hayes of America won the Marathon in 1908.
