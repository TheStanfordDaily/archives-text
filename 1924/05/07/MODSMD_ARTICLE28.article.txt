# MATERIAL ABOUNDS FOR 1925 BASKETBALL TEAM
## 
### Ted Achilles 
"Next year looks like a big one for
basketball," says Andy Kerr. "Cali
fornia won this year because it had
plenty of experienced substitutes,
while Stanford had to play the same
men for a whole game or else lose
the best of its teamwork. Next year
we will have all the material we can
use."
Although finishing but third in the
Pacific Coast Conference, Stanford
missed the championship by a margin
that was much too small for Cali
fornia's comfort. Throughout the
whole season the Cardinal team was
one to be proud of.
Cards Beat Olympic Club
The first game of any importance
was with the much-talked-of Olympic
Club team. The clubmen entered the
game as favorites but came out on the
short end of a 31-11 score. The Cards
showed remarkable teamwork for an
early season game, playing a five-man
game on the offense as well as the
defense. Captain McHose and "Ernie"
Nevers worked their almost irresisti
ble scoring combination that was a
feature of every game for the rest of
the season.
Santa Clara was the next victim,
going under to the tune of 27-16. The
Missionites were outplayed from the
start, but they had a magnificent de
fense that kept the ball near the mid
dle of the court. "Nip". McHose was
the outstanding figure of the game,
making 13 points, most of which were
scored on long shots.
U. S. C. Wins First Game
U. S. C. came north for the first
Conference games and divided the
series, taking the first game 20-17 and
losing the second 25-19. The first game
see-sawed back and forth for the first
half, U. S. C. finishing the half with
a lead of 10-7. The Southerners stalled
a great deal during the rest of the
game, managing to keep slightly ahead
until the end.
The second game, which required an
extra period, was a real basketball
classic. Both teams fought to the ut
most of their ability, keeping either
side from acquiring a lead of more
than four points. With the score tied
7-7 at the start of the second half, a
battle began that kept the spectators
on their feet without a moment's rest
for the remainder of the game.
The lead changed hands every few
minutes, with an abundance of person
al fouls on each side making the re
sult largely a question of accurate
shooting from the foul line. With less
than half a minute to go and the
visitors leading 18-16, McHose sunk a

field goal, saving the day.
In the five-minute extra period, Stan
ford went wild and ran up nine points
to the opponents' one. Every man on
the team seemed not only to be having
a chance at the basket, but to making
good his shots.
Nevada Drops Two
The following week saw two more
victories, over Nevada this time. Nei
ther game was particularly close nor
exciting, the varsity rolling up scores
of 28-13 and 30-10. McHose and Oliva
were the stars of both games, the
former finding the basket with ease
and the latter making short Avork of
any offense that the visitors at
tempted.
The first California game marked
another Stanford victory, a hard
fought affair ending 18-17. Both teams
were nervous, missing many easy
shots and making a large number of
easily avoidable fouls. Dave Oliva,
who had been one of the stars of the
team in every game, suffered a twisted
knee that kpt him out of the play
until the last game of the season.
Bears Cop Free-for-AII
California came back in the second
game, winning what was little better
than a free-for-all, by a score of 26-25.
The game was a constant succession
of personals, every player having at
least two called against him. Nevers
was the star; all California's rough
ness leaving him as unscathed as if
he had been merely a spectator.
The varsity split two more games
with U. S. C. in Los Angeles, losing
24-20 and winning 29-22. The absence
of Oliva was a big handicap, but Ship
key filled his place like a veteran. Mc-
Burney and Steele continued to play

steadily good games at running guard
and center respectively.
With Stanford, California, and U. S.
C. in a three-cornered tie for the cham
pionship, the Blue and Gold won the
third game of the series, by a power
ful offensive at the very end of the
game, finishing 27-23. Stanford's team
was weakened by lack of strong sub
stitutes, while California's reserves
were practically on a par with her
first five.
Bruins Take Series
The last game of the year was a
desperate struggle which California
won again through the strength of her
substitutes. The game was extremely
rough, McHose and Steele being taken
out on personals early in the second
half and several other players narrow
ly escaping the same fate. The whole
team played a stellar game, piling up
a 12-9 lead in the first half, only to
lose it before one of California's whirl
wind finishes.

General revision of rules will be made
by the Intercollegiate Basketball League,
it is stated, as a result of the recent
semi-annual meeting.
