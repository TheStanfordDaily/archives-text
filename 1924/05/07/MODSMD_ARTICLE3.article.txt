# "Art for Fifty Cents" Motif for Twelve-Page Junior Week Programs
## 
### 
Members of the class of '400 will
verify their membership by appearing
in the Stanford Bookstore as early as
possible and demanding, with fitting
haughteur and fifty cents, a Junior
Week souvenir program. Only 400 have
been published.
Now whether or not members of the
class of 1925 and the class of '400 are
one and the same remains to be seen
by the statistics of the sale.
"Art for fifty cents" has been the
motto of the program committee. The
soft leather cover has been embossed
with a design by R. E. Stoll, Quad
artist, with real gold letters for the
title.
Twelve pages of program have been
incorporated into the booklet, which is
quite some layout for just three days.
In fact, there is quite a bit of activity
crammed into those three days, and
the Junior Week program is the only
one that knows all about it.
