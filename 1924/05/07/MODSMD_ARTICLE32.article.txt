## No. 12. PALO ALTO 
### Esther Greenacre 
At San Prancisquito creek and the
state highway, towers the giant red
wood from which the town of Palo
Alto took its name.
The tree is intimately connected
with the history of this locality. The
ranch upon which is situated the Uni
versity took its name, which in Span
ish means "high pole," from this red
wood and the name was in turn ap
plied to the town. When the Univer
sity first opened the old monarch was
chosen as the most fitting symbol for
the official seal.
Originally there were two redwoods
standing close together 011 the bank.
Undermined by spring freshets one of
the pair fell and when Stanford opened
only one tree remained standing. The
survivor is about nine feet in diame
ter at the base and is over a hundred
feet in height. By counting the body
rings in the fallen tree it has been
estimated that its companion must be
about 950 years old.
It is related that as early as March
26. 177(5, Lieutenant-Colonel Juan Bau
tista Anza gave the name of Palo Alto
to the Indian Rancheria 011 the Arroyo

de San Francisquito because of the
two tall trees which, when seen from
a distance, "rise like a tower above the
surrounding trees." The town of Palo
Alto in turn took its name from the
Indian Rancheria.
During the gold rush of *49 these
trees were conspicuous landmarks
serving as guide posts to travelers. On
a clear day they could be seen from j
both San Jose and Rincon Hill, San I
Francisco.
During 1849 to 1850 two lumber
camps were established by Edward
Gallagher, one in the bottom of the
Canada del Rayniundo, the other on
the flank of the mountain. One hun
dred and fifteen men were employed
in ripping out lumber which was
hauled to Embarcadero (now Redwood
City) for shipment either by water to
San .Francisco or by train to San
Jose. Several times the lumber men
were in the act of cutting down the
Palos Colorados, the red trees, as they
were called by travelers. Had not the
Argonaut fleet arrived from New Eng
land early in 1850 with lumber brought
around the Horn, the landmarks would
undoubtedly have been destroyed.

versity took its name, which in Span
ish means "high pole," from this red
wood and the name was in turn ap
plied to the town. When the Univer
sity first opened the old monarch was
chosen as the most fitting symbol for
the official seal.
Originally there were two redwoods
standing close together 011 the bank.
Undermined by spring freshets one of
the pair fell and when Stanford opened
only one tree remained standing. The
survivor is about nine feet in diame
ter at the base and is over a hundred
feet in height. By counting the body
rings in the fallen tree it has been
estimated that its companion must be
about 950 years old.
It is related that as early as March
26. 177(5, Lieutenant-Colonel Juan Bau
tista Anza gave the name of Palo Alto
to the Indian Rancheria 011 the Arroyo

de San Francisquito because of the
two tall trees which, when seen from
a distance, "rise like a tower above the
surrounding trees." The town of Palo
Alto in turn took its name from the
Indian Rancheria.
During the gold rush of *49 these
trees were conspicuous landmarks
serving as guide posts to travelers. On
a clear day they could be seen from j
both San Jose and Rincon Hill, San I
Francisco.
During 1849 to 1850 two lumber
camps were established by Edward
Gallagher, one in the bottom of the
Canada del Rayniundo, the other on
the flank of the mountain. One hun
dred and fifteen men were employed
in ripping out lumber which was
hauled to Embarcadero (now Redwood
City) for shipment either by water to
San .Francisco or by train to San
Jose. Several times the lumber men
were in the act of cutting down the
Palos Colorados, the red trees, as they
were called by travelers. Had not the
Argonaut fleet arrived from New Eng
land early in 1850 with lumber brought
around the Horn, the landmarks would
undoubtedly have been destroyed.
