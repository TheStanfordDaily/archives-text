# SILVER SHEET ROBS ROOTERS OF TEDDY, MASCOT BEAR CUB
## 
### 
Teddy, the eiglre-weeKs-old bear cub
that was imported from Humboldt
county as mascot fo rthe Big Meet,
has proven that he is not only a crack
mascot, but, also, that he is going
to throw a scare into some of the fam
ous animal actors of the screen.
The original scenario for the student
movie that is being filmed contained
no part for the versatile young cup but
Martin Morris, the student director,
saw that a place was made for the
bear. After one day on location with
the beast Martin has decided that his
hunch was not so good.
The dope was set for the bear to
come charging out from behind a rock
and pursue Peggy Richardson, the
leading lady. Either the young lady
offered no inducement to the bear or
he was too sleepy to perform, for he
flatly refused to act despite the most
heart-ringing appeals and careful ex
planations of Morris.
Morris hit upon the plan to entice
the bear across the path of the camera
â€”namely to play upon the fact that
the cub might be hungry. Armed with
a milk bottle he backed away from
the bear. The plan would have worked
fine if the bear had been hungry and
if he had not been sleepy. The bear
refused to proceed more than a fewj
feet at a time, and on one of his
sallies he succeeded in getting a hold
of one of Morris' fingers and, although
the injury ia not serious it is decided
ly painful.
Teddy is now back on the campus
and is being petted and pampered as
ever by the indulgent Row. The bear
makes a nice pet now but when he
gets a little older the girls from the
next-door houses will not be clamor
ing to pet it. Like an elephant he will
be "nice to look at but terrible to
own."
