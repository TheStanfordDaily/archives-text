# Stanford Man Sets Stage For Three Contest Plays
## 
### 
Carol Alexander, formerly of Stan
ford, is directing the stage settings in
a group of three one-act plays, which
are being presented. May 5-10, by the
Players Club of San Francisco. These
plays, "Boots," by Ransom Rideout,
which won first place over nearly fifty
others; "Reverse English," a comedy
by Richard Melville; and "Joey Mar
tin, Fisherman," by Mrs. C. L. Kellam,
were the first three choices in a con
test recently held by the Players Club
for local playwrights. Sufficient good
material was submitted to make a
second bill, if public approval is fa
vorable.
A few tickets, good for any of this
week's performances, are on sale at
the office of the secretary of the Eng
lish department. The plays will be
presented at the Players Theatre.
