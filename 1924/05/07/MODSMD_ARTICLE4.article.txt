# DR. ADAMS DEFENDS "CLOAK OF IGNORANCE"
## Says That Manipulation of Knowledge Is Essential To Man's Prestige 
### 
Many people have a just claim to i
the "decent cloak of ignorance," main- 1
tained Dr. John Adams of the Univer-1
sity of London in his lecture last night j
in the Little Theatre.
"Prestige in society depends on how j
well a man utilizes his knowledge
rather than on his stock of informa
tion," said Adams. "In regard to gen
eral knowledge in society, accuracy is
subordinate to the manipulation of
knowledge.
"Reaction to intelligence examina
tions shows what is happening in so
ciety," he said.
".There is a difference between in
telligence and information. <Jeneral
information is used as a test for intel
ligence, but is different from intellect.
Common experience shows that the
well-informed man is usually the in
telligent man, but in intelligence tests,
guesswork is sometimes possible.
"There is no parallelism between in
formation and intelligence, although
statistics show a high correlation be
tween the * two," insisted Adams.
"There is an objection to the intru
sion of mental testing into the ignor
ance of adult people.
Society in Conspiracy
"The conspiracy of silence in regard
to general knowledge in society comes
from a dread of being shown up, and
consequently we have a fellow feeling
for our neighbors whom we suspect
are in the same situation as we. We
shudder at the position of the school
boy who is laid open to xamination.
"The world is not a great examina
tion hall where everyone is put on his
mettle, and the defaulters are ex
posed. There is a limit to the knowl
edge and the kind of knowledge ne
cessary for self-respect.
"In ordinary society, the individual
is free from questions on general
knowledge. One is grateful to the din
ner partner who avoids dangerous
questions."
"However," said Adams, "there is
no escape from children." Among oth
ers who are generally embarrassing
to the individual, he listed those who
make use of the "completion of quota
tion tyranny," that is, begin a quota
tion, forget it, and then appeal to com
panions for aid.
He also mentioned the elderly ladies
of a literary turn of mind who have
vague recollections of books, and want
help in remembering what they are.
All branches of professionals are
open to attack from such sources.
"Some people go to the schoolmaster
for knowledge, as others go to a fish
monger for flsh. Rut if a pedagogue
claims a pedestal he must take the
consquences."
