# CHORUS NUMBERS TO PROVE HIT OF OPERA
## Pony and Beauty Choruses Vie For Charm in Dancing and Colorful Costumes in Junior Play 
### Ross Urquhart 
fj'ROM the raising of the curtain on the opening chorus of the first act to the
last drop on the grand finale, the oustanding feature of "So This Is Eden"
should be the dancing and singing of the three choruses.
Boasting some of the most beautiful and best known young women on the

campus, the choruses should prove the decided "hit" of the evening. Such
ponies as Peggy Richardson, Rowena Mason, and Dorothy Kinkead, should
prove strong competition to such members of the beauty chorus as Adelaide
Kelly, Marcia Morton, and Grace Reed, in the eyes of Old Man Spot, shining
$>down on their charming costumes and

gracious ways.
Much of the credit for training in
experienced people in stage dances is
due to Eileen Eyre, the chorus direc
tor who has been assisting Gene Trago
in the development of the show and
training the dancers and singers six
weeks.
The time-worn gag of the darky
minstrel who used to come out, pin a
handkerchief on the curtain for
scenery, and after much mysterious
sh-sh-'ings and lowered stage whisper
ings, begin to tell "about the little
dark-haired girl—second from the end
—you know: Mm'm —well, if you knew
what I knew about her " will not
be worked this time.
Just the same, the chorus members
have their dark secrets. How one of
the ponies worked so hard prancing
over the hard stage every night that
she had a breakdown, and how one of
her sisters had to fill her place, is just
one of the many things that filters
out from backstage. This is confiden
tial stuff now and it will be up to the
audience to find the one who filled in
at the last minute —y/ho is she?
Chrysella Dunker is noted for her
original settings and costumes. From
the time the pony chorus comes on in
its "joy" costumes through its "notch,"
hula, and gingham dress costumes, the
oil's and all's of that delighted mass —
the audience, should bear out this fact.
The beauty chorus works mainly in
evening gowns, while the men's chorus
struts proudly forth in dinner jackets,
beachcomers' rags, and sailors' garb.
The seat sale yesterday afternoon
broke all existing records and practi
cally the whole house was sold out.
However, a few available seats may
still be had at the office of the Alumni
Secretary in the Administration build

what I knew about her " will not
be worked this time.
Just the same, the chorus members
have their dark secrets. How one of
the ponies worked so hard prancing
over the hard stage every night that
she had a breakdown, and how one of
her sisters had to fill her place, is just
one of the many things that filters
out from backstage. This is confiden
tial stuff now and it will be up to the
audience to find the one who filled in
at the last minute —y/ho is she?
Chrysella Dunker is noted for her
original settings and costumes. From
the time the pony chorus comes on in
its "joy" costumes through its "notch,"
hula, and gingham dress costumes, the
oil's and all's of that delighted mass —
the audience, should bear out this fact.
The beauty chorus works mainly in
evening gowns, while the men's chorus
struts proudly forth in dinner jackets,
beachcomers' rags, and sailors' garb.
The seat sale yesterday afternoon
broke all existing records and practi
cally the whole house was sold out.
However, a few available seats may
still be had at the office of the Alumni
Secretary in the Administration build

fj'ROM the raising of the curtain on the opening chorus of the first act to the
last drop on the grand finale, the oustanding feature of "So This Is Eden"
should be the dancing and singing of the three choruses.
Boasting some of the most beautiful and best known young women on the

campus, the choruses should prove the decided "hit" of the evening. Such
ponies as Peggy Richardson, Rowena Mason, and Dorothy Kinkead, should
prove strong competition to such members of the beauty chorus as Adelaide
Kelly, Marcia Morton, and Grace Reed, in the eyes of Old Man Spot, shining
$>down on their charming costumes and

gracious ways.
Much of the credit for training in
experienced people in stage dances is
due to Eileen Eyre, the chorus direc
tor who has been assisting Gene Trago
in the development of the show and
training the dancers and singers six
weeks.
The time-worn gag of the darky
minstrel who used to come out, pin a
handkerchief on the curtain for
scenery, and after much mysterious
sh-sh-'ings and lowered stage whisper
ings, begin to tell "about the little
dark-haired girl—second from the end
—you know: Mm'm —well, if you knew
what I knew about her " will not
be worked this time.
