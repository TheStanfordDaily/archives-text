# Original Ideas In Custom-Made Cars Being Worked Out
## 
### 
Originality of ideas and cleverness of
construction characterizes the plans
that have been sent in to the Junior
Week Committee by the various living
groups for their entries in the Automo
bile Float Parade. Everything from a
baby carriage to a peanut stand will be
represented when the parade moves
down Lasuen Saturday afternoon.
Over half the campus organizations
have turned in their designs and are
beginning construction work on their
Cadillacs and puddle-jumpers. The
houses that have not responded as yet
are urged to do so as soon as possible
so the committee can complete its plans
for the procession. Men's groups will
vie for possession of the Wideinan Cup
while the cleverest women's float will
be awarded the Roos Brothers Trophy.
