# NORTHERN TOUR MAY BE MADE NEXT YEAR BY WOMEN DEBATERS
## 
### 
An offer has been received from the
Oregon Agricultural College to send
a Stanford women's debate team
north to meet that school next year.
Last year California sent a women's
I team on a northern trip to meet O. A.
, C., Oregon, Reed College, University
i of Washington, and University of Brit
-1 ish Columbia. It is now suggested that
Stanford do the same next year.
Oregon Agricultural College made
! no definite financial guarantee, but if
the plans of the California women's'
team were followed the trip would
practically pay for itself.
No reply has yet been given to the
offer, according to the announcement
of Professor Lee Emerson Bassett, 1
professor of English in charge of pub
lic speaking. "If the women show suf
ficient interest it is altogether prob
able that such a trip could be ar
ranged. It would require considerable
work on the part of the women par
ticipating, and if they do not care to
sacrifice the time we can see fit to
make no effort to complete arrange
ments."
The proposition will probably be
presented to Wranglers, women's de
bating society, to foster an open try
out next fall, similar to that held for
men's debate.
