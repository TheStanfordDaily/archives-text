# TWENTY-ONE CARD TRACKSTERS WILL ENTER P.A.A. MEET
## Tryouts for Olympiad to Be Combined With Annual Contest May 17 
### 
Stanford will be represented by
twenty-one track and field athletes in
the annual P. A. A. meet to be held in
the Stanford Stadium Saturday after
noon, May 17.
The Pacific Coast tryouts for the
Olympic games will be combined with
the P. A. A. meet this year. The dis
tances will be in meters.
The meet will undoubtedly develop
into a fight between the Stanford and
California varsity and freshman squads,
and the Olympic Club of San Francisco,
for first place. One or two smaller
athletic clubs in San Francisco may
make a strong bid for the honors.
California will be represented at least
by the men that are to make the trip
back .east to represent her in the I. C.
A. A. A. A. meet, and probably by some
other athletes.
The hurdles will be close and excit
ing, as such men as Becker, California,
and Krogness, of the Olympic Club,
will be entered in addition to Leistner,
of Stanford.
If Sudden of the Olympic Club en
ters the meet, the 100-meter dash
should be a great race. Hale and
Campbell, of Stanford, will both com
pete.
"Tiny" Hartranft, sensational Cardi
nal weight man, will take another lling
at the world's records in the shot and
discus. At present lie stands out as the
foremost weight man in the United
States, and will no doubt represent
America in Paris this summer. His re
cent toss of 50 feet 11inches with
the iron ball came within J4-"U'h of
equaling the world's record set by
Ralph Rose, of the Olympic Club, in
1900.
Miller to Run.
Ted Miller, Stanford's find of the
season, who broke the Stanford-Cali
fornia record in the quarter mile on
April 26, will be on hand for the 400-
meter run. Re was defeated by Cocli
eran of the Olympic Club at the begin
ning of the season, and this race will
probably see the two pitted against
each other again.

the Olympic Games candidates from
the section including Northern Cali
fornia, Nevada, Utah, Hawaii, and the
Philippine Islands.
