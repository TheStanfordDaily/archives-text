# Awards Assembly
## 
### 
Sixty-four men and women, leaders in various lines of activity at Stan
ford were presented with token of appreciation of their work in the annual
awards assembly this morning.
Athletics, dramatics, and debating, were represented on the stage as
the students were called upon to receive their awards. The awards as
sembly, which was established last year, is one of the most admirable of
Stanford's newer traditions.
In this way, the student body as a whole is intimately introduced to
some of the people who are really doing things for the University, it is
altogether fitting that the medals and other awards which have been
earned in various lines of activity should be presented in a student as
sembly.
The student body is indebted to Frank Guerenna, '11, for his help in
making the assembly a success this morning. As one of Stanford's most
prominent and enthusiastic alumni, Guerenna was a happy choice for the
important part which he played.
