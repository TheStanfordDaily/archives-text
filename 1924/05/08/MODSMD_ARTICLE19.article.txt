The smallest pitcher in captivity.
That's Milt Teague. Milt weighs (with
his clothes on) one hundred and
thirty-five pounds.
Before coming to college, Teague
performed on the Santa Paula high
school team. In his first two years he
worked as utility infielder, switching
between third and short in most of
the contests.
In his junior year he was elected
captain, and during that, and his last
season, spent most of-the time in the
pitcher's box.
During the 1925 frosh series between
California and Stanford, Teague waited
until the third game for his chance,
and when given it, stepped out and
beat the Bears.
lie played on the varsity last year
and pitched in the big series.
Milt bats and throws right handed
and is five feet nine inches tall. He
has one more year of varsity baseball.
