## 
### 
Nestoria defeated Euphronia Liter
ary Society by a two-to-one decision in
their annual intersocietv debate in
the Little Theatre last night.
McCaffery and Victor Harding were
the Nestoria representatives.
The question presented was: "Re
solved, That the Mellon tax proposal
should be immediately adopted." The
Nestoria men defended the negative
of the discussion.
The victors attacked the Mellon pro
posal on the grounds that it discrimi
nated unduly against the farmer and
small merchant classes, that there
was too much reduction in large in
comes and not enough in small ones.
Nestoria submitted an alternative
plan in the form of the Garner pro
posal, which they held forth as tem
porary, to be put into effect until a
constitutional amendment could be
passed eliminating tax exempt securi
ties of large investors.
Euphronia men in the clash were
Bertram W. Levit and Richard Jen
kins. They contended that taxes on
large incomes would increase busi
ness, and that the differentiation in
regard to the small farmer and mer
chants was justified. They attacked
the negative's alternative plan in that
it would not produce sufficient reve
nue to run the government and was
not equitable in its reduction of raxes.
The contest was the twenty-fifth an
nual clash between the two societies.
Both organizations date their origin to
the pioneer days of Stanford.
The decisions were rendered by Pro
fessor Edwin A. Cottrell of the Politi
cal Science department. Professor
Benjamin L. Holland and Professor
William B. Owens of the Law depart
ment. Reginald G. Trotter, assistant
professor of history, was chairman.
