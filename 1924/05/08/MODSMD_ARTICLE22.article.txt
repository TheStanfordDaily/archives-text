# SPORTS OF 1924
## He Improves With Age 
### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
"Stubby" Kruger, of Hawaii and the Illinois Athletic Club, is a remarkable
swimmer. He is not only remarkable because of the records he makes or the
races he wins, but because he has been doing it for twelve years and now
is better than ever. Kruger was in the limelight in 1917 when he was breaking
records for the Healani Club of Honolulu, and went to the 1920 Olympic
games, where he swam in the 100 metre backstroke race but didn't place. He
was regulated to the "has been" class, but made the most sensational of
comebacks in 1922, scoring 21V& points in the national championships, or 9
more than his nearest competitor.
Stubby, besides holding 8 world's backstroke records, the record for the
medley race, and being a member of the I. A. C. championship 200 and 400
yard relay teams, is the Indoor and Outdoor Pentathlon champion. Last April
Kruger won all five events in the Indoor Pentathlon, the first time any
swimmer had ever done this.
This husky bird isn't through yet and will probably accompany his plump
coach, Bill Bachrach, to whom he owes much of his recent success, to the
Olympic games. No, not as a water comedian, than whom there is no
funnier, but to compete again in the backstroke race or relay. Stubby can
"crawl" 100 yards in 55 seconds.
