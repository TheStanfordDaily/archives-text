# FIRST BATHTUB INVENTED CLAIMED UNHYGIENIC
## 
### 
Cincinnati claims the original bath
tub, which was constructed by a
wealthy citizen in the early 40'Â«, ac
cording to the Medical Record. This
tub was seven feet long and four feet
wide. Upon completion of this tub the
owner gave a party for his male
friends and all of them are said to
have tried out the new convenience.
For many years bathtubs were not
popular, and the Boston city council
passed an ordinance prohibiting the
use of the bathtub without the advice
of a physician.
