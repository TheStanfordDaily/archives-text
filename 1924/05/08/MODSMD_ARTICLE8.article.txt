# Hydraulic Laboratory To Have Big Modern Accessories Added
## 
### 
Many accessories are to be added to
the Hydraulics Laboratory this quar
ter to make it modern in every par
ticular. Hy far the most important of
these will be a current meter rating
station, in the form of a tramway con
structed over one of the several canals
or trenches.
The laboratory, located just across
from the new Union store, was built
ten years ago. Originally it was com
posed of a row of sixteen large, grey
colored measuring tanks extending
down the entire left side of the room,
a distance of a hundred feet or more.
Since this first outlay, trenches have
been constructed and water pipes to
test friction loss have been installed.
Eight of the tanks are on a level
with the floor, while others, called
weirs, are high above and must be
reached by ascending to a specially
built steel platform. Still higher above
are the pressure tanks, much smaller
in size, from which the water for the
weirs comes. In the weir boxes are
triangular, rectangular, and trapezoi
dal openings, and circular orifices,
through which the water passes to
the lower tanks. The object of these
openings is to test the flow through

â– each, to find the most economical
opening for the amount of water flow
ing through. The velocity of the water
is also tested, and the amount of fric
tion determined.
Some of the tanks that catch the
water weigh it, while -others calibrate
it for volume. From these lower tanks
the water is allowed to run into the
trenches, where certain tests are
made. It then flows out of the building
into underground tanks, from which it
is pumped back into the pressure
tanks when needed.
In this way the same water is used
year in and year out, with loss only
through evaporation. Years ago it
came from Searsville, but it is not of
fensive now. for its continual flowing
has purified it.
The proposed current meter rating
station, to be installed this quarter, is
to be constructed over the largest
trench. The object of the new appa
ratus is to test the amount of water
flowing past a given point. Since the
flow in the trench cannot be accu
rately regulated, the meter will have
to be drawn through still water, and
will be constructed on a kind of tram
way. In the past a boat has been
pushed through the lake to make these
tests. Of course, this latter process
had many disadvantages.
Supply Pipes Nearly Ready
Alftther improvement will be ready
in a couple of weeks, in the form of
four- and six-inch supply water pipes
used to test friction loss. The purpose
of these will be to teach students
something about water flow, so that
they will be able to figure out the size
of pipe best fitted to take the water
most economically and with the least
amount of friction. In the past they
have had to be content with one- and
two-inch pipes to make these tests.
One of the newest additions has
been a siphon spillway, an exact mod
el of one used in New York on Lake
Champlain. When the water rises to a
certain height, a supply of air is cut
off, causing the water flow through the
spillway, increasing in volume. There
are about twenty such spillways in
the Hetch-Hetchy dam. This model
will be used during the quarter as the
basis for a new problem.
