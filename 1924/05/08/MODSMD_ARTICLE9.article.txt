# SOPHOMORE TRIO TO STAR IN JUNIOR MUSICAL SHOW
## Dress Rehearsals Show Preparations About Complete; Lippincott and Van Deusen Appear in "Woolworth Lurch" 
### James Muir 
WITH a plot that could carry the show over on its own merits unaided by j
" chorus or song, and a cast of characters that needs no introduction to
this season's playgoers, "So This Is Eden" awaits the opening curtain Saturday j

night with an air of quiet confidence. Dress rehearsal last night was a final j
performance in itself. Even the director seemed happy.
If the lucky possessors of the "Heebies" or "Jeehies" have any doubts about!
seeing some real dramatic acting as well as a brilliant array of costumes and j
snappy chorus numbers, they liave only to glance at the cast of principals.

In the first place, they find Marjorie,
j Allen, Aileene Burks, and Lloyd No-1
I lan, the sophomore triple threat to any
dramatic production. These three were
j introduced to the campus in the
sophomore play, "Captain Applejack,"
; last fall. Since then no cast has been
without one or all of them. This is |
their first adventure into eye and ear;
i entertainment and their popularity
can only increase as they sing and
dance in the final act of Junior Week.
For a doubles team that will cause
more side-aches than can be forgotten
in a long while, Gene Trago presents
Mable Ferry as Aunt Abagail and Hol
lis Chalmers as Deacon Higgins. When
these two break into the specialty i
dance that they have worked up all
by themselves there won't be a dry
eye in the audience. Mable Ferry can
easily be remembered as the one who
made "Bambalina" famous while Hol
lis Chalmers enough said.
