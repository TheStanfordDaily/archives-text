# PHILOLOGICAL CLUB HAS FIRST MEETING SINCE DISBANDMENT
## 
### 
The Philological Association held its
first meeting, since its revival, yester
day in the Women's Clubhouse. Two
papers were read, one on "Dramatic
Irony in Chaucer," by Germaine Col
lette, and the other on "Greek and
Latin Versification," by Dr. 13. O. Fos
ter.
Miss Collette's paper was formed
from part of her thesis for her doc
tor's degree, which she expects to take
this spring. In this paper she brought
out that dramatic irony so constantly
found in Chaucer came from his own
viewpoint towards life, strengthened
by the influences of his reading, and
not from just the influences upon him.
She said that Chaucer wanted good
stories and humor, and that the iron
ies of life and incongruities of situa
tion gave these to him. She added that
he did not depend solely on these for
his humor, but added his skillful char
acterizations.
