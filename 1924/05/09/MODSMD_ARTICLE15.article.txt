quoia First for the lead in League 6 by
handing Alpha Sigma Phi a 37-3 drub
bing in an intramural game played
yesterday. Incidentally, the Delta Chi's
hung up a new Stanford record for
number of runs scored.

to take a hard-fought contest from Los
Arcos 9-8. El Toro defaulted to Kappa
Alpha.

closely resembled a track meet than a
baseball game. Driving in twenty-seven
runs in the first frame the winners
broke down their opponents' morale.
They slowed up a little in the second
when only ten runners crossed the
pan. lleticker pitched good ball for
Delta Chi.
Delta Chi Has Clean Slate
Alpha Sigma Phi succeeded in tally
ing three times in the first inning. Mc-
Cook did some fair twirling for the
losers but his teammates gave him
no support.
Both Delta Chi and Sequoia First
have clean slates thus far, but each
has a pair of contests yet to play. They
will meet in the deciding game May
14.
Encina Third and Los Arcos were
evenly matched. Twelve strikeouts by
Phil Duncan, Encina moundsman,
proved the deciding factor in his
team's triumph. Although he was
touched for eleven hits he was in
vincible in the pinches. Encina col
lected fifteen bingles off Morrison of
Los Arcos.
Freshmen Score First
The freshmen put the first run
across in the second. Los Arcos tied
the count in the third, but fell behind
in the fourth when it tallied one
marker to its opponents' three. En
cina added four in the fifth, at the
same time blanking Los Arcos. The
eating club started a rally in the sixth
which netted six runs in two innings,
tying the score at eight up.
With one away in the seventh, Par
ker and Duncan of Encina singled and
Smythe crashed out a two-bagger,
bringing Parker in with the winning
tally.

Alpha Sigma Phi succeeded in tally
ing three times in the first inning. Mc-
Cook did some fair twirling for the
losers but his teammates gave him
no support.
Both Delta Chi and Sequoia First
have clean slates thus far, but each
has a pair of contests yet to play. They
will meet in the deciding game May
14.
Encina Third and Los Arcos were
evenly matched. Twelve strikeouts by
Phil Duncan, Encina moundsman,
proved the deciding factor in his
team's triumph. Although he was
touched for eleven hits he was in
vincible in the pinches. Encina col
lected fifteen bingles off Morrison of
Los Arcos.
Freshmen Score First
The freshmen put the first run
across in the second. Los Arcos tied
the count in the third, but fell behind
in the fourth when it tallied one
marker to its opponents' three. En
cina added four in the fifth, at the
same time blanking Los Arcos. The
eating club started a rally in the sixth
which netted six runs in two innings,
tying the score at eight up.
With one away in the seventh, Par
ker and Duncan of Encina singled and
Smythe crashed out a two-bagger,
bringing Parker in with the winning
tally.
