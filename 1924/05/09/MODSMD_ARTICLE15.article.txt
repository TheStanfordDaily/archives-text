# DELTA CHI NINE TIED WITH SEQUOIA FIRST FOR LEAGUE 6 LEAD
## Alpha Sigs Swamped 37-3 in Slugging Exhibition; Encina Third Wins 
### 
Delta Chi went into a tie with Se
quoia First for the lead in League 6 by
handing Alpha Sigma Phi a 37-3 drub
bing in an intramural game played
yesterday. Incidentally, the Delta Chi's
hung up a new Stanford record for
number of runs scored.
Good pitching enabled Encina Third
to take a hard-fought contest from Los
Arcos 9-8. El Toro defaulted to Kappa
Alpha.
The Delta Chi-Alpha Sig melee more
closely resembled a track meet than a
baseball game. Driving in twenty-seven
runs in the first frame the winners
broke down their opponents' morale.
They slowed up a little in the second
when only ten runners crossed the
pan. lleticker pitched good ball for
Delta Chi.
Delta Chi Has Clean Slate
Alpha Sigma Phi succeeded in tally
ing three times in the first inning. Mc-
Cook did some fair twirling for the
losers but his teammates gave him
no support.
Both Delta Chi and Sequoia First
have clean slates thus far, but each
has a pair of contests yet to play. They
will meet in the deciding game May
14.
Encina Third and Los Arcos were
evenly matched. Twelve strikeouts by
Phil Duncan, Encina moundsman,
