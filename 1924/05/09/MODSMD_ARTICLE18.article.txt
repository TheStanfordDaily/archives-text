# Junior Week
## 
### 
Junior week opened last night with the Corduroy ball and the fire
works on the banks of what used to be Lake Lagunita.
For the next two days, the Class of 1925 will act in the capacity of host
to the entire campus. Anyone who has happened down into the Pavilion
while the juniors have been decorating, is easily convinced that '25 is stop
ping at practically nothing to make the week end a success.
The Prom decorations are well planned and have l>een well carried out.
Judging from the annonucements concerning music and other detailed
arrangements, this year's Junior Prom will go down in history as one of
the best parties in recent years. Advance notices on the Opera also indi
cate Junior Week will have a successful conclusion.
The Class of 1925 has worked under a severe handicap in making ar
rangements for Junior Week this year. The lake, such an important part
of former junior festivities, has been of no help. The juniors have gone
ahead in spite of the handicaps and planned what looks to be the best pos
sible substitute for the lake sports.
The student body looks forward to the week-end, juniors. Good luck
to you, we all hope your plans are successful in making this the greatest
junior week in Stanford's history.
