# Be Sure You're Right

The following letter came to the Daily Palo Alto office this morning:
"Editor, Daily Palo Alto,
Dear Sir: A few clays ago I addressed to you a letter relative to the
method in which teams are chosen for interclass tennis. Since writing it,
I have discovered that I exaggerated the matter considerably. Probably
your own good judgment impelled you to refrain from using it; but in any
event, please do not use it now, as it conveys a wrong impression of those
who made arrangements for the interclass tennis tournament."
The writer of this letter has sent two communications to the Daily
office in the past week. The first of these is the one referred to in the above
letter. Contrary to the opinion of the man who sent in the communica
tions, it was not a case of good judgment or anything of the sort. It was
merely a case of the Daily Palo Alto doing what he should have done be
fore he wrote any such communication. The matter was investigated and
it was found that the charges made could not be substantiated^
While the man who sent in the communications and the letter is to lie
commended on his desire to right matters when he found out the truth, he
did not make the attempt to find out the facts soon enough. Suppose, for
the sake of argument, the Daily had published his vituperative communi
cation when it came to hand, without any investigation. Reflections would
have been cast on some people who are apparently not to blame.
It is just this sort of thing which causes trouble not only at Stanford
but elsewhere. A critical attitude is desirable and can accomplish a great
deal of good. However, an uninformed man cannot maintain such a crit
ical attitude consistently.
We will get along much better here at Stanford if we are not too much
inclined to be suspicious of our fellows. A good motto to follow in mak
ing adverse criticism is, "BE SURE YOU'RE RIGHT, I HEN GO
AHEAD."
