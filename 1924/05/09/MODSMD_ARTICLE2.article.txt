# SENIORS TAKE WIN FROM SECOND YEAR PLAYERS IN TENNIS
## 
### 
1924 took the lead in the interclass
tennis yesterday afternoon by defeat
ing the sophomores 4-3. This practi
cally gives them first place as they
have only to play the freshmen, who
have been beaten by both the sopho
mores and juniors.
The juniors were victorious in three
out of the five matches that they have
so far played with the sophomores and
will probably come second to the sen

chance to win the final trophy for the
whole interclass season, are now near
