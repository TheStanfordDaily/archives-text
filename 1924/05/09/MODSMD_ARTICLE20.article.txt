To outdo "Dope" Fuller and Robert
MacSwiney at one fell swoop is the
ambition of Sam Dunmire of the Phi
Delta Theta house. At midnight to
night Dunmire will be allowed to take
his first bite since Tuesday, April 29,
when he made a bet with other men
in the Phi Delt house to the effect that
he could last ten days with no nour
ishment other than water.
When interviewed today Sam
claimed to feel pretty weak but other
wise O. K. As far as can be ascer
tained he is not an Orangeman and
he staunchly denies that he is trying
to detract from the work of the Irish
martyrs.
Dunmire is hardy enough to win this
bet if anyone could, having played
center on the famous Washington and

Jefferson team which played Califor
nia at Pasadena on New Year's day
two years ago.
