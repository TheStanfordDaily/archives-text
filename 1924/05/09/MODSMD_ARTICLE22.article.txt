# CARD DIVERS WILL BID FOR NATIONAL TITLE ON MAY 18
## 
### 
Three of Coach Ernie Brandsten's
proteges will bid for the National
Fancy High Diving championship to
be decided at a diving carnival which
will be held at Searsville lake at 3
o'clock Sunday afternoon, May 18.
Clarence Pinkston, former Stanford
man and holder of this and the world's
title in the same event, will be there
to defend his honors. Pinkston is one
of the men developed in the Encina
pool by Brandsten who has secured
world prominence by his springboard
work. He has been training in the
Venice pool for the past few months
in preparation for the Olympic Games.
Al White to Compete
A1 White, holder of the national
high and low springboard title, will
in all likelihood be the strongest con
tender to Pinkston and is conceded a
slight edge in the tournament by vir
tue of his recent work in the Chicago
meet when he successfully defended
his title against a strong array of con
tenders. White is captain of this year's
Stanford Varsity Diving and Swim
ming team. He has had very little
competition on this coast during the
past two years except from Pinkston.
Dave Fall will be the third Stan
ford man to enter the meet and his
good work in the Chicago meet where
he captured third place in the Low
Springboard Senior Championships
gives him a prominent place in the
tournament. Â«
Thomas McKee of the Olympic Club i
is also expected to be a strong con
tender in the meet. He is holder of
the Metropolitan Association Cham
pionship of New York City and will!
enter the meet with a national reputa-'
tion.
Patsy Young, of Cleveland, Ohio, an
other spring board artist of exception
al ability will again enter the tourna
ment in hopes of securing the title. He
was seriously injured in the tourna
ment last year and was unable to com
pete in the finals, but according to all
dope he is coming back stronger than
ever.
J. Hallvorsen, another eastern man,
who has been training in Chicago, will
compete. Nothing very much is known
about Hallvorsen except that he made
a very good showing last year in the
annual meet.
