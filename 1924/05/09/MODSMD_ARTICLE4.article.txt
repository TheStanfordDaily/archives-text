# Apaches Steal Clothes Of Stanford Ruggers
## 
### 
Followed by hard luck ever since
they arrived in Europe, the American
Rugby team now in Paris has almost
received the last straw which caves in
the camel's back, yesterday, when
sneak thieves entered their dressing
rooms and relieved them of their
money, jewelry, and clothes.
Among those who were thus treated
is Dudley DeGroot, and who by this
stroke of fortune was reduced to the j
well known "barrel condition."
Several men lost money and five,
were left only their Rugby suits which
fortunately they had on.
Arriving in England, the Rugby team j
played two games with British teams
and suffered defeats. Since their com- j
ing to Paris they have not only been '
refused practice games but an attempt l
is being made to keep the Americans ;
from taking their own motion pictures i
of the America-Rumania game x Sun- j
day, because of a monopoly which the
French committee claimed they have
given to a native company.
Manager Samuel Goodwin has
threatened to abandon the game if
the Americans are not allowed to film
the game.
DeGroot is now believed to be look
ing for garments in Paris which are
minus the French pleats and frills.
