# STANFORD DIVERS TO COMPETE IN P. A. A.
## 
### 
Coach Brandsten will enter six Car
dinal divers in the P. A. A. senior high
diving championships Sunday which
will be held at Lake Searsville at 2
o'clock.
A1 White will enter both the high
fancy and high plain diving events. He
is generally expected to add these
titles to his already long list of
laurels, although White spends most
of his time on springboard diving.
Ted Smith, Dave Fall, John Kenney,
and Riddle Dorcy compose the other
Stanford entries.
