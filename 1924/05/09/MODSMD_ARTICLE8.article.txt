# STAGE IS SET FOR 1925 JUNIOR OPERA
## Vivid Drama, Realistic Sets, Song Hits Galore and Well Trained Cast Promise Success 
### James Muir 
UOO THIS IS EDEN" opens at 8:15 tomorrow night for a limited campus
run with every probability or being hailed as the Jiest all-around show
ever staged in the Assembly hall.
Three choruses have been drilled afternoon and night for five weeks under
the active direction of Eileen Eyre. None of the old bounce-kick steps or

steals from musical road shows are on Miss Eyre's program. She has her
own ideas, as those who saw Ram's Head's show will testify.
With the "ballad" style of musical composition putting a lilting catch into
the songs and some good voices to send them over the footlights, "Tin Pan

$>Alley" will have to cross Stanford off
its market for the next few weeks.
Every number is different and when
set oft' by the colorful chorus costumes
an impression is created that should
stick for quite a while.
Realistic Sets
Realism was the object of Leslie
Kiler in designing the sets for the
Junior Opera. Harvey Lytel has car
ried out these ideas in construction in
a way that is remarkable. Both the
interior and exterior scenes leave
nothing to the imagination for vivid
| and graphic pictorial effects.
In the cast of characters we find an
j array of actors that is a hit in any
| league. Marjorie Allen, Aileene Burks,
| Lloyd Nolan, Dave Mannoccir, Delmer
| Daves, Murray Ward, Hollis Chalmers,
! Mabel Ferry, all carry roles that were
I written especially for them, if we are
i to take the word of George Thompson,
| author of the piece.
Aileene Burks, as Celestina, the im
pulsive Spanish woman, and Lloyd
! Nolan as Roderiguez, a hardy native
bootlegger, furnish a sub plot that is
full of the highest type of dramatic
emotional portrayal.
Those are a few of the reasons why
the Juniors expect to present the cam
; pus with a real treat tomorrow eve
| ning. The stage is set.

Celestina is loved by Roderiguez and Piazza. The result of Piazza's jealousy
is a mutinous uprising against Roddy, to acquire Celestina.
