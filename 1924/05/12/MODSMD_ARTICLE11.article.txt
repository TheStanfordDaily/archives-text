# MANY EXPECTED TO PARTICIPATE IN P. A. A, MEET
## Olympic Tryouts to Be Held Saturday Afternoon in Stanford Stadium 
### 
Early indications point to a record
breaking number of entries in the
P. A. A. track and field meet which
will be held in the stadium Saturday
afternoon.
As the P. A. A. will serve as division
tryouts for the Olympic games, con
siderable attention is being centered
on it. In addition to the score of Stan
ford entries, already published, six
teen off-campus entries have been re
ceived.
The entries already made do not in
clude the entire Stanford team, nor
the California or Olympic Club squads.
When these squads are entered it is
probable that 100 men will have signed
up to participate in the contests.
Sixteen Outsiders Enter
The sixteen entries received Satur
day are as follows:
404) meters —J. Giordanevgo, Italia
Virtus.
800 meters —John Caibel, unattached.
3000 meters —Clarence Hazeleur, un
attached.
Steeplechase—Clarence Hazeleur,
unattached.
5000 meters —James Prave, Italia
Virtus; Frank Pivocci, Italia Virtus;
Clarence Hazeleur, unattached.
10.000 meters —Vincenzo Gozo, Italia
Virtus; P. Giordanevgo, Italia Virtus;
A. Tommasini, Italia Virtus; Clarence
Hazeleur, unattached; Jules V. Lind
ner, unattached.
400-meter hurdles —John Cahill, un
attached.
10,000-meter walk —Dave Tyson,
Olympic Club.
High jump—Milton H. Carter, Hilo,
Honolulu.
Pole vault —R. H. Cartley, Honolulu.
No Celebrities
None of these men have records,
but they are all in good shape and
some of them may be able to make
the better-known tracksters step to
keep their laurels. Additional entrants
are expected from the Hawaiian Is
lands, and a number of men from the
Philippines should also be on deck
when the time for the meet comes
around.
The two Stanford men who will be
watched with the greatest interest
Saturday are Bill Richardson in the
800 meters and Ted Miller in the 400
meters. Richardson has not lost a race
this year and Miller has failed but
once to breast the tape, and that was
when he ran against "Racehorse"
Cochran of the Olympic Club. The
competition will be pretty keen Satur
day and if both of these men live up
to expectations they will take first
places, and thereby increase the Red

shirt chances at the I. C. A. A. A. A.

judges of weights—William Dooling,

Snedegar, Everett W. Smith, J. E. Mc-
Dowell; recorder —Charles Merchant.
Early indications point to a record
breaking number of entries in the
P. A. A. track and field meet which
will be held in the stadium Saturday
afternoon.
As the P. A. A. will serve as division
tryouts for the Olympic games, con
siderable attention is being centered
on it. In addition to the score of Stan
ford entries, already published, six
teen off-campus entries have been re
ceived.
The entries already made do not in
clude the entire Stanford team, nor
the California or Olympic Club squads.
When these squads are entered it is
probable that 100 men will have signed
up to participate in the contests.
Sixteen Outsiders Enter
The sixteen entries received Satur
day are as follows:
404) meters —J. Giordanevgo, Italia
Virtus.
800 meters —John Caibel, unattached.
3000 meters —Clarence Hazeleur, un
attached.
Steeplechase—Clarence Hazeleur,
unattached.
5000 meters —James Prave, Italia
Virtus; Frank Pivocci, Italia Virtus;
Clarence Hazeleur, unattached.
10.000 meters —Vincenzo Gozo, Italia
Virtus; P. Giordanevgo, Italia Virtus;
A. Tommasini, Italia Virtus; Clarence
Hazeleur, unattached; Jules V. Lind
ner, unattached.
400-meter hurdles —John Cahill, un
attached.
10,000-meter walk —Dave Tyson,
Olympic Club.
High jump—Milton H. Carter, Hilo,
Honolulu.
Pole vault —R. H. Cartley, Honolulu.
No Celebrities
None of these men have records,
but they are all in good shape and
some of them may be able to make
the better-known tracksters step to
keep their laurels. Additional entrants
are expected from the Hawaiian Is
lands, and a number of men from the
Philippines should also be on deck
when the time for the meet comes
around.
The two Stanford men who will be
watched with the greatest interest
Saturday are Bill Richardson in the
800 meters and Ted Miller in the 400
meters. Richardson has not lost a race
this year and Miller has failed but
once to breast the tape, and that was
when he ran against "Racehorse"
Cochran of the Olympic Club. The
competition will be pretty keen Satur
day and if both of these men live up
to expectations they will take first
places, and thereby increase the Red

shirt chances at the I. C. A. A. A. A.
