breaking number of entries in the
P. A. A. track and field meet which
will be held in the stadium Saturday

As the P. A. A. will serve as division
tryouts for the Olympic games, con
siderable attention is being centered
on it. In addition to the score of Stan
ford entries, already published, six
teen off-campus entries have been re
ceived.
The entries already made do not in
clude the entire Stanford team, nor
the California or Olympic Club squads.
When these squads are entered it is
probable that 100 men will have signed
up to participate in the contests.
