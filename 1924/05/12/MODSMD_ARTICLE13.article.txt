# JUNIOR OPERA ACCLAIMED HIT OF DRAMATIC SEASON
## Nolan, Burks, and Allen Repeat Successes; Chalmers Hailed as Dancing Fool 
### Hal Rorke 
"So This Is Eden" was lifted into
i the class of successful productions by
j the first kick of the pony chorus Sat
. urday night. At the end of the first
act the 1925 Junior Opera had been
! danced into a class bv itself. Not in
I
j generations has the campus been of
fered so much and such good enter
tainment.
Even the measles could not stop the
show. Gene Trago, to whom as direc
tor goes the credit for the hit, cheated
Fate by taking the place of one of the
i chorus men, Francis Manchester, when
he was taken sick at the last minute.
Without the help of her co-stars,
I Aileene Burks and Lloyd Nolan, Mar
jorie Allen was chiefly responsible for
; putting the first act in its high place,
i As the daughter of the sanctimonious
I bootlegger and the former actress,

played by David Mannoccir and Helen
Broughall, Miss Allen proved to be
the life of the party.
Islanders Intrigue
Aileene Burks as Celestina, the
dancer, and Lloyd Nolan, who played
a commanding Roderiguez, did not
appear until the scene shifted to the
bootlegging Island in the Bahamas to
which the over-civilized aristocrats
had eloped in search of love and Na
ture.
Unlike a great many Spanish danc
ers, Miss Burks proved even more
fascinating as she danced. She did so
well that it was early evident that
even so convincing a ruffian as Roderi
guez would never be able to resist
her. And as for a law-abiding audi
ence
Mollis Chalmers and Mabel Ferry
won the laugh-extracting contest by a
large plurality. Their comedy coup
was a burlesque classical dance in
which the temperance deacon turned
caveman lover and the spinster chape
ron reverted to Daphne-like coyness.
Music Exceptional
These two and the Allen-Nolan-
Burks combination sang the musical
hitsâ€”they and that knockout chorus.
Ted Van Deusen and Gardner Lip
pincott introduced their sure-fire dance
in act one, which was received even
better than usual. These veterans
were preceded by Adelaide Kelly, who
made her first appearance as a solo
dancer Saturday night in an ebullient
bacchanale with the pony chorus. This
dance made the first really big bang of
the show, but unfortunately no encore
was given.
Along with the other features of the
show, the music outdistanced that of
past Junior Operas. Three numbers in
particular stood out, "Some Little
Girl," "Celestina," and "Broadway
Nights," the last of which was perhaps
as good a finale number as could be
found anywhere.
A lot of the good lines were written
into the detective parts, played by
Charles Simons and Sidney Lewis.
George Thompson, who wrote the
book, had some of the catchiest com
edy yet presented at Stanford, as well
as a good plot. Simons and Lewis made
the most of their share as the drunken
prohibition sleuths.
Eyre Directs Chorus
In the role of Gerald Harvey, Murray
Ward set a mark for future villains to
shoot for. He proved to be an appal
ling dastard.
Delmer Daves made a great deal of
his small part as Piazza, the double
crossing captain. The part of Blair
Fawkes was played by Lew Forrest.
But, to come back to the chorus. All
of the numbers were the creations of
Eileen Eyre, and to her is due the
credit for training the three groups.
And be it recorded that in doing so
Miss Eyre did not sacrifice their sing
ing.
Costumes and scene design con
tributed much to the performance. Les
Kiler's tropical set, in particular, was
exceptional background for Chrysella
Dunker's technical effects.
