# JUNIOR OPERA ACCLAIMED HIT OF DRAMATIC SEASON
## Nolan, Burks, and Allen Repeat Successes; Chalmers Hailed as Dancing Fool 
### Hal Rorke 
"So This Is Eden" was lifted into
i the class of successful productions by

played by David Mannoccir and Helen
Broughall, Miss Allen proved to be
the life of the party.

Unlike a great many Spanish danc

fascinating as she danced. She did so
well that it was early evident that
even so convincing a ruffian as Roderi
guez would never be able to resist
her. And as for a law-abiding audi
