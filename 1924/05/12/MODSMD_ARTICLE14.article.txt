# Spark Plug Races With Locomotive in Parade
## 
### 
The Chi Psi band of engineers pilot- I
ing the locomotive and coal car on its'
cinder path by the brakeman's deft sig
naling, and the Tri-Delts with their
canary in a cage were awarded prizes in
the parade under junior auspices Satur
day afternoon.
With this commonplace gilded cage of
romance shocking members of the Pro
tection of Animals' Society, and Sen
ator Stanford's locomotive, were Barney
Google and his gang, Scary Ann, and
"Lovey" and the fourteen kids visiting j
the campus.
Calliope Appears
Parading before the august bench of i
judges stationed at the law steps, the
procession came, including the greatly
heralded calliope, and the many machine i
floats representing the various living
groups.
Prohibition officers have been hailing
the appearance of the Pi Phi-Phi Psi
water wagon as the first result of many
years' hard labor among college groups.
The Legend ef the Barrel presented
an apt picture of what the Greeks might
have done in one of their orgies,—disap
pointed that lack of Lagunita as usual
marred the scenery.
Bugs of a variety other than that driven
by the campus speed hounds, appeared
with a host of butterflies—also varying
from campus spccies.
And the everready fire engine always
lending its presence to Junior Week fes
tivities, led the procession.
