### 
Gordon Davis, who has been in the
East throughout the Spring Quarter,
is expected back on the Campus the
third or foutli of June, according to
latest reports. He has been in New
York studying the methods of drama
tic production in this season's plays,
and as presented by the eastern uni
versities and schools of dramatics.
He has seen most of the really good
plays and writes that this has been a
remarkable season. He mentioned es
pecially the mammoth production of
"The Miracle," in which Lady Diana
Manners played. While a guest of Pro
fessor Allard of Harvard he saw "The
Thief of Bagdad" on which he com
mented favorably. He was much im
pressed by Walter Hampden's revival
of Rostand's great play, "Cyrano de
Bergerac."
Studies At Harvard
Davis spent a number of days at
Harvard as the guest of Professor
Louis A. Allard of the department
of Romanic Languages. He went to
Harvard to study the dramatic situa
tion there. Professor Baker's theater
workshop there is the nucleus of one
of the best courses in play writing
and play production given in the
country, and has produced such plays
as "You and I" by Philip Barry, which
ran for months last winter in New
York. Davis saw the dress rehearsal
and production of this year's big an
nual play.
