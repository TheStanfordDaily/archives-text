# STANFORD GRADUATE DRAFTS PLANS FOR PLANTING ARBORETUM
## 
### 
Plans for developing the arboretum
have been drawn up by Gardiner Daily,
ex-'24. Daily is a landscape gardner in
San Francisco and has been working for
the Spring Valley Water Company. He
has designed a roof garden and has
beautified many seres of their holding.
Having a definite plan to work from
will eliminate much unnecessary work.
Beginning with the two plots in front of
the chemistry building which have been
planted this year, the whole arboretum
will eventually be set out in accordance
with this plan. The arboretum has been
divided into twenty-eight main groups
and these have been subdivided into about
four hundred smaller ones. Paths will
be' laid out and various shrubs and plants
will be planted. Flowering shrubs will
be planted along the roads and evergreens
and less showy plants will be set back of
these. About 15,000 species will be rep
resented.
