The All-Star water polo team, cap

Swimming fans got a glimpse of the
class of Sam Kahanamoku, considered
a coining world beater, when he pad
dled the 100-meter free style in 1:03
3-5. Warren Kealoha placed second
and his brother Pau, third.
White and Fall, Stanford's cham
pion divers, and Prentice, T. Smith,

i Breaking his own record by 4 4-5
seconds, Arne Borg hung up a new
! world mark of 10:38 3-5 in the half
mile free style as his part in the water
| carnival held at the Encina pool Fri
-1 day afternoon. The seating capacity
was taxed to the limit in response to
the high class program which Ernst
| Brandsten had arranged.
| The Stanford relay team of five men,
| who were to swim against Borg in
, order to press him, were never able to
j catch up with him although two of the
men started even with him in the last
I
laps. His strokes and turn, which are
both considered obsolete, proved very
effective, and Borg is almost certain
to find his name in the list of first
place winners in the Olympics.
