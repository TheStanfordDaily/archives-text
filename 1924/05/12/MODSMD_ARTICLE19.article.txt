# SPIRIT OF CARNIVAL RULES CAMPUS FOR 1925 JUNIOR WEEK
## 
### Steve O'Donnell 
The three full days of entertainment
| offered by the class of 1925 culminated
lat midnight Saturday, when the final
! strains of the Cast Dance music brought
! Junior Week to a close.
Every feature of the program fulfilled
j the most optimistic predictions. The
i From was a huge success. "Liz" Greer's
I Collegians, a Berkeley orchestra, fur
nished music for the occasion, and the
decorations, representing a beach scene,
proved to be attractive as well as appro
priate for a spring quarter dance.
Opera Well Received
The opera "So This Is Eden," pre
j sented Saturday night in the Assembly
I hall, was enthusiastically applauded by
â€¢ the audience. Every number was called
j back for an encore.
In the afternoons preceding the Prom
j and the opera there were two swimming
I meets in Encina pool. The first was
j an exhibition affair in which Arne Borg,
Swedish star, broke the world's record
in the half-mile free style. Exhibitions
i were also given by members of a Ha
-1 waiian team. A group of divers, headed
I by A1 White and Dave Fall entertained
| the crowd with fancy diving. A Stan
j ford relay team defeated a squad com
> posed of Hawaiians, but the varsity lost
I a water polo match to the Islanders by
j a score of 2-1.
