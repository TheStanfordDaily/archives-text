# Congratulations, 1925
## 
### 
The class of 1925 deserves a great deal of credit for putting on one
of the best Junior Weeks in many years. Starting with the Corduroy
Ball, and ending with the opera Saturday night, there was not a dull
moment.
The juniors outdid themselves in decorating for the Prom. The
scheme employed was not elaborate but rather simple and attractive.
The music was highly satisfactory as was the food which was served
in the Encina dining halls. Everything moved smoothly and the party
was a most enjoyable one.
One of the most commendable things about this year's Prom was
that the juniors did not try to make it a paying proposition, but rather
succeeded in showing all their guests a good time. The pavilion was
just comfortably crowded. Of course, a number of students who wished
to get tickets were unable to do so, but under the circumstances, this
was unavoidable.
The one regrettable thing in connection with this, was the fact that
there were many freshmen at the dance when upperclassmen were unable
to get tickets. This, however, was not the fault of the junior class. As
long as there are men who are willing to walk up and buy tickets for
those who had the least right to be at the dance, such conditions will
continue.
Those who simply bought tickets for their freshman friends were
bad enough, but the men who secured tickets and sold them at twice or
three times what they paid for them are out of the question. Uundoubted
ly, some of those culprits will be caught. The Daily Palo Alto will watch
with interest just what the Men's Council will do with a case of that sort.
The juniors came through in great shape with the Saturday afternoon
program in spite of the fact that Lagunita, such an important part in
other Junior Weeks, was out of the question. The automobile parade was
a great idea. It was well thought out and was executed well. Dancing
at Toyon and Branner topped the afternoon off well.
The opera, as the closing event of the week end, was well received by
a large audience. As a whole, it was one of the best productions in
recent years.
1925, you did well. The Daily Palo Alto wishes to congratulate you
on your success as a host, and thank you, for itself, for a most enjoyable
week-end.
