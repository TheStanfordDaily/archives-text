# Hawaiian Swimming Team To Practice at Stanford
## 
### 
The entire Hawaiian swimming
team arrived in Palo Alto this morn
ing and will remain here all week
practicing for the Olympic tryouts,
which will be held later in Indianapo
lis. They are staying at the University
Hotel and will work out daily in the
Encina pool. The practice should help
them materially in becoming accus
tomed to the much colder and less
humid climate than that of Waikiki.
The swimmers all have their "ukes"
and "steels" with them and the na
tives of Palo Alto should hear some
real Hawaiian music during the week.
Sam Kahanamoku, besides being re
nowned for his wonderful swimming,
is considered one of the best tenors
on the islands.
