"King of the Wild Horses," Varsity
Theatre.
If one likes horses enough to see
them graze through many feet of film,
without watching the usual percentage
of love scenes, the "King of the Wild
Horses" is a good picture.
Spectacular leaps and almost im
plausible running in the midst of a
forest fire are the exciting parts in
the picture.
A slight plot having to do with a
weak son, a dutiful daughter, a splen
did hero, and a mercenary villain fur
nish the action.
But, by and largeâ€”horses!
