## Famous Guys Who Golf 
### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Maurice McLoughlin, who ten years ago burned up the tennis courts in the
East, is now burning up golf courses in amateur tournaments in the West, and
his drive on the links today is winning him nearly as much glory as his drive
on the courts did of old. The hero of the 1914 Davis Cup matches, who
defeated the great Brookes and Wilding of Australia, plays 18 holes in 71 and
has only been playing about four years at that!
Shortly after taking up the game the "California Comet" was playing at
Long Beach, California, with a friend who was desirous of inspiring him with
confidence. At a water hole, the tee of which is built on a trestle right over a
small lake, Mac's friend proceeded to show how the game is played. "Where
upon he hit nine balls into the lake," said McLoughlin, "with a display of
language that was nothing short of classical. I nearly fell into the lake â€”I
was laughing so hard." "But what about you?" I asked him. "Oh, I gave four
a bath, too." "And the fifth?" "I carried that around as I wanted one left
to finish the round with."
