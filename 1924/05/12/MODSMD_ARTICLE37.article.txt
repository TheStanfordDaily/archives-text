# PHI DELTA THETA WINS FRATERNITY MEET IN SWIMMING CARNIVAL
## 
### 
Outclassing its opponents in nearly
every event, Phi Delta Theta swam
away with the Interfraternity meet,
which featured the Junior Week
water sports carnival Saturday in the
Eneina tank, by garnering 40 points.
The Phi Delts at the same time won
the intramural championship by tak
ing 33 marks to 25 for the Breakers,
their nearest competitors.
Attempting to break the 220-yard
free style Encina tank record, held by
Norman Ross at 1:21 1-5, Arne Borg
finished but a second too slow in an
exhibition race.
The times in the interfraternity
events were slow. The Phi Delts
cinched the meet when they took the
relay, but the Breakers pressed them
closely.
By expert management and co-oper
ation Charles Simons and Art Stewart
won the hotly contested canoe tilt and
incidentally a two-pound box of candy
donated by "Sticky" Wilson.
Curtis Wright emerged victorious
from the 1100 pounds of entries in the
fat man's race. The blindfold race
went to Les Peter who was the first
to crack his head against the end of
the pool at the finish.
