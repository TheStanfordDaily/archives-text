# BRUINS HAVE FOUR TRACK STARS FOR OLYMPIC TRY-OUTS
## Becker, Boren, Barber, and Neufeld Have Chance To Go Over Seas 
### W. O. Cole, '26. (Daily Californian 
California's chances for representa
tion at the Olympic games in Paris
have narrowed down to four track
athletes. These possibilities are Cap
tain Bill Neufeld, Paul Boren, Jim Bar
ber, and A1 Becker. Their chances of
entering the world's greatest competi
tive meet will depend a lot on what
they are able to accomplish in the P.
A. A. meet on May 17. If they show
to advantage Coach Walt Christie will
allow them to enter the Olympic try
outs.
Of the four men mentioned the out
standing is Paul Boren. If he can re
peat his performance in the broad jump
of last Saturday, lie will stand a very
good chance to place up among the
best at the tryouts to be held on the
Cardinal oval May 17. His leap of 24
feet 1 inches is surpassed by only a
trio of eastern athletes and no one in
the west has been able' to come any
where near this mark.
Captain Bill Neufeld consistently
heaves the shot out around the 47-foot
mark and if he is at his best when the
coast tryouts for this section are held
he should place second only to "Tiny"
Hartranft. Hartranft is conceded to be
the best weight man in the United
States and critics say he is due to break
the world's mark in this event soon.
Barber Is Possibility.
The two track men who are thought
to have a slim chance to get in the
Olympic running are Barber, dash man,
and Becker who takes care of the bar
rier events for Coach Walt Christie.
Everything depends on their ability to
annex a first in their events against the
Cardinals Saturday. If they show up
better than at any time during the sea
son Walt may allow them to enter the
tryouts. If not, the Bruin coach will
probably not see it advisable to allow
them to compete due to the closeness of
the I. C. A. A. A. A. meet in the east.
Becker takes the low sticks at 25 sec
onds' when he is in trim and has done
the highs in 15:2. If he is able to cut
this latter time down to the 15-second
mark he stands a fair opportunity to
place in the tryouts. Barber, who has
covered the 100-yard event in 9 9-10
seconds, is not conceded a very good
chance to place against such men as
Eddie Sudden and Charley Paddock.
There is a slight possibility, however,
that he can cut his time to 9 4-5 and
place well up with the leaders. He has
been unofficially clocked at the 9 4-5
mark and is probably capable of turn
ing the trick again.
Taking it all in all Paul Boren is
about the only man who really figures
to get a crack at the finals. Neufeld
might be able to turn the tables but he
will have to improve his heaves closer
to the 50-foot mark in order to enter
the finals at Boston.
