## 
### 
There are four distinct methods by
which men test what is right and wrong,
according to Dr. John Snape, pastor of
the First Baptist Church of Oakland, who
spoke yesterday morning in the Me
morial Church oil "Authority in Re
ligion."
"Some take the rationalistic stand,
holding that what appeals to reason is
right," said Dr. Snape. "Others feel that
faith is greater, and still another group
depends on conscience. However, Christ
alone is the real guide."
