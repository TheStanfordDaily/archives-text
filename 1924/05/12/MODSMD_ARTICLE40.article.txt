# WOODHEAD TO ENTER OLYMPIC FINALS
## 
### 
Orton Woodhead will be Stanford's
representative on the wrestling team
which will be sent to New York this
month to enter the Olympic Trials.
Woodhead won from John Becker, a
teammate on the Stanford squad, in
the finals of the welterweight division
last Friday night at the Olympic Club.
Vaughn Hosepian, last year's captain,
was defeated by G. Higgins of the
Olympic Club in the lightweight event,
the only other division in which a
Stanford man was finalist.
