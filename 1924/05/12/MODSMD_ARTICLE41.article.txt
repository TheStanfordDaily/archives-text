# Checkers Row's New Fad; Buttram Shining Artist
## 
### 
Clarence Buttram, although not a
member of the local chess and checker
club, claims to be the nonpareil plus
ultra of Stanford checker pushers, and
is being groomed and nursed by his
fraternity brothers at the Sigma Chi
house for the world's championship,
Olympic Games, and similar combats.
Buttram transferred last fall from
the University of Oklahoma, where he
distinguished himself by walking off
with the University Gold Checker,
given each year to the winner of the
school championship. Since he has
been at Stanford he has popularized
checkers on the Row to such an ex
tent that it now rivals ping pong, golf,
and horseshoes as a mental panegyric,
the center of the epidemic being the
Sigma Chi front porch, where many
wordy battles take place.
He is being backed by his fraternity
for any and all championships. He as
tounds his opponents by his skill in
motivating a tantalizing checker. Al
though not a grandfather, he is de
clared to be crafty enough at checkers
to have grandchildren at a compound
interest rate.
The secret of his success, Buttram
says, is that he plays "percentage
checkers," an invention of his own.
He also moves with his little finger.
That may have something to do with
it.
