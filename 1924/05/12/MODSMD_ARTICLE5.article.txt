# Huge Sums Change Hands In Shadow of Law Steps

### 
Spring must be here. Each morning
several freshmen gather near the law
steps and indulge in a contest of wit,
skill, and accuracy. The stakes arc low
and the game is the old grammar school
pastime of lagging pennies to a line.
Oblivious to onlookers, the daring
gamblers pursue their occupation. It's
rather reminiscent of barber college days,
but the lads must be amused.
Probably if the gentle art of gambling
were denied them, they would bring out
their tops and marbles—and maybe kites.
But the seniors look on with lazy eyes
and by their silence give consent. And
somehow we don't care, either.
Ho hum. Spring must be here.
