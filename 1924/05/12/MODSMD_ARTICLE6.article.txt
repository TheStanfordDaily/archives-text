# Circus Pronunciation of "Calliope" Places First
## 
### 
Bill Wright, of the automobile float
parade committee, has enabled a decision
to be rendered in the century old debate
between dictionary writers and middle
western-circus-goers over the pronuncia
tion of the word "calliope."
The dictionary writers have been dog
matic in their assertion that the correct
way to say the word was to follow the
Greek, and produce "cal-i-o-pe" while
the middle westerners would have none
of it and insist on "cal-yope."
Wright approached the manager of a
circus in San Jose to secure an instru
ment for the parade Saturday afternoon.
"Have you a cal-i-o-pe?"
"A what?" asked the manager.
"A cal-i-o-pe."
The manager shook his head in per
plexed thought. Finally Wright saw
light and made an experiment:
"Have you a cal-yope?"
"Oh, sure."
