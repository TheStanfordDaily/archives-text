# Arne Borg's Personality Gains Crowd's Good Will
## 
### 
Encina pool again added to its list of
great swimmers with the name of Arne
Borg Friday afternoon.
A mop of sandy hair, the ability to
fly through the water with the speed
and straightness of an arrow, and a few
words of broken English composed the
first impression of all this fame.
But tiring out four varsity swimmers,
and breaking his own world's record,
caused the admiring cheers of the on
lookers.
Then, once out of the water and bereft
of his business-like determined manner,
Borg was the perfect sportsman in his
enthusiasm for the others, and hearty
endorsement of their prowess.
