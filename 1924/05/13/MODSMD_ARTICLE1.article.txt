# MANY ENTERED IN OPENING EVENTS OF INTRAMURAL MEET
## Wet Track Results in Slow Times; Walker Wells Jumps 21 feet 4 
### 
Slow times were turned in by 270
athletes in the 100-yard dash at the
intramural track and field meet yes
terday afternoon.
By the time fifteen races had been
run the track was almost a sea of
mud, making record-breaking times
impossible. The broad jump, the other
event on the day's program, was like
wise impaired by the wet field.
Due to the number of men compet
ing it is impossible for the summary of
yesterday's events to be announced
until Wednesday, as the scoring is on
the mass system. The minor sports
staff is tabulating the results at pres-'
ent, and they will be ready for publi
cation tomorrow, according to C. W.
Davis, who has charge of the meet.
No one was able to turn in a time
of better than :10 2-5 in the century,
and the best that was done in the
broad jump was 21 feet 4 inches. The
best times in the hundred were: Allen,
Delta Chi; Bumbaugh, Phi Kappa Psi;
Caspar, Breakers; and Daly, El Toro;
all :10- 2-5; and Wright, Theta Chi,
10 3-5. Gaspar was incorrectly timed
the first time he ran, but later got
down to :10 1-5.
