# "ELIJAH" TO BE GIVEN IN STANFORD STADIUM JUNE 8
## Chorus Will Be Composed of Five Hundred; Louis Graveure to Sing Title Role 
### 
II7ITH a chorus of 500 voices, and with Louis Graveure as principal soloist '
" in the role of the prophet, Elijah, Mendelssohn's dramatic oratorio of this 1
name, will be presented at the Stanford stadium on the afternoon of Sunday, j
June 8. Warren D. Allen, of Stanford, director, today announced that the !
"distinguished baritone" is definitely secured for the part, which, with the 1
statement that Comptroller A. E. Roth of Stanford has completed organization '
of a committee of guarantors, assures that the huge musical production,

believed to be the greatest of its kind ever attempted in the West, will be
given in open air at the stadium.
As well as Graveure, three other artists, whose names will be announced
soon, will take leading parts. The San Francisco Symphony Orchestra will
be represented by sixty-five pieces selected from the organization.
In "Elijah" will be given the first great musical performance ever directly
sponsored or managed by Stanford, and this is said to mark a milestone in

the progress of this University as fars
as the recognition of music and its j
importance is concerned.
Under direction of Warren D. Allen,
organization of the huge chorus has
already begun. Making up the body of j
five hundred are:
The Palo Alto-Stanford community j
chorus, numbering 160 voices.
The College of the Pacific chorus,
including the A. Cappella Chori, num- j
bering 100 voices.
The Mountain View Choral Society
and the Peninsula Choral Society of i
San Mateo, numbering together over
100 voices. • I
Over 100 members of the Festival!

Chorus of San Francisco.
The last-named chorus, which sang j
the Mahler and Beethoven Symphonies |
under Alfred Hertz at the San Fran-;
cisco Music Festival, is well repre
sented in the Stanford performance,
and is conducting rehearsals each
Monday evening at the Girls' High.
School.
Dean Charles M. Dennis of the Col
lege of the Pacific, Neil Darrah of
Mountain View, and J. Sidney Lewis
of San Mateo are assisting Director
Allen in preparing the respective
chorus sections for work in "Elijah."
Louis Graveure, who will do Elijah
in this oratorio at the North Shore
Musical Festival of Northwestern Uni
versity immediately before going to
Stanford, is considered by critics the
leading exponent of this role t«uay.
Though not "operatic," he is probably
the most damatic of all the concert
artists, and the part of the prohpliet in
what is recognized as the most dra
matic of all oratorios is said to have
been "created for him."
The oratorio itself is concerned with
the prophet, "a man strong and zeal
ous, full of bitterness and scorn, the
antagonist of the rabble, whether of
courtiers or populace, well nigh the
antagonist of the world, and yet borne
aloft 011 the wings of angels." It car
ries him through struggles with King
Ahab of Northern Israel and the wor
shipers of Baal, through the triumph
of the Lord who lighted Elijah's altar,
through the miracle he worked to
God's glory in restoring the son of
the widow in whose home Elijah
sought shelter, and finally to his jour
ney to Mt. Horeb where the winds,
lightning, and tremors shook the
mountains about him, and where he
found the Lord "in none of these but
in the still small voice which came
after and whose message none shall
know."
Throughout the oratorio "is crowded
with stirring incident, and with music
which claims even the wholly unculti
vated ear."
"Elijah" was first performed Aug.
26, 1846, at Birmingham, England,
whose festival Mendelssohn was in
vited to conduct, and it has since
proved one of the most pbpular works
of its kind.
The performance at Stanford will be
guided by the Stanford Oratorio Com
mittee, chairman of which is Dr. D.
Charles Gardner. All business arrange
ments will be handled by Paul H.
Davis, graduate manager, and the
Stanford Board of Athletic Control.
The production will be given as a bene
fit for the Stanford Memorial Church,
and profits, if any, will go to rebuild
ing the church organ.
All athletic equipment will be re
moved from the Stanford stadium,
which will present to the audience
only the great turf and the oratorio
stage on June 8.

the most damatic of all the concert
artists, and the part of the prohpliet in

The oratorio itself is concerned with
the prophet, "a man strong and zeal
ous, full of bitterness and scorn, the
antagonist of the rabble, whether of
courtiers or populace, well nigh the
antagonist of the world, and yet borne
aloft 011 the wings of angels." It car

Ahab of Northern Israel and the wor
shipers of Baal, through the triumph
of the Lord who lighted Elijah's altar,
through the miracle he worked to
God's glory in restoring the son of
the widow in whose home Elijah
sought shelter, and finally to his jour

lightning, and tremors shook the
mountains about him, and where he
found the Lord "in none of these but
in the still small voice which came
after and whose message none shall

through the miracle he worked to
God's glory in restoring the son of
the widow in whose home Elijah
sought shelter, and finally to his jour
ney to Mt. Horeb where the winds,
lightning, and tremors shook the
mountains about him, and where he
found the Lord "in none of these but
in the still small voice which came
after and whose message none shall
know."
Throughout the oratorio "is crowded
with stirring incident, and with music
which claims even the wholly unculti
vated ear."
"Elijah" was first performed Aug.
26, 1846, at Birmingham, England,
whose festival Mendelssohn was in
vited to conduct, and it has since
proved one of the most pbpular works
of its kind.
The performance at Stanford will be
guided by the Stanford Oratorio Com
mittee, chairman of which is Dr. D.
Charles Gardner. All business arrange
ments will be handled by Paul H.
Davis, graduate manager, and the
Stanford Board of Athletic Control.
The production will be given as a bene
fit for the Stanford Memorial Church,
and profits, if any, will go to rebuild
ing the church organ.
All athletic equipment will be re
moved from the Stanford stadium,
which will present to the audience
only the great turf and the oratorio
stage on June 8.
