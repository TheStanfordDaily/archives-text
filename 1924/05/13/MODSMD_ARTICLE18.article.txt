# OLYMPIC CLUB TO ENTER POWERFUL SQUAD IN P. A. A.
## Close Race Between Cochran And Miller Is Expected In 400 Meter Run 
### Wallace Knox 
Charlie Hunter is entering the
strongest team the Olympic Club has
put in the field this season in the
P. A. A. track and field meet which
will be held in the stadium Saturday.
Coach Hunter is out to turn the
tables on the Cards, or at least par
tially make up for the defeat handed
his Post street athletes in a dual meet
by the Redshirts last quarter.
Olympics Stronger
The Winged "O" men were almost
helpless the last time they invaded
the farm, but their defeat by such a
large margin can largely be attributed
to the fact that most of their repre
sentatives were out of shape. The
Olympians have the talent, and their
showing Saturday is just a quest-ion
as to what condition the individuals
are in.
Eddie Sudden, "Racehorse" Coch
ran, and Elmer Boyden are the trio
most likely to endanger the Stanford
point-getters. Sudden has been one of
the fastest flyers in the country, but
his times have not been exceptional
this season. As the P. A. A. is serving
as tryouts for the Olympic games it is
likely that Eddie will make an effort
to show the doubtful ones that he has
not lost his old class.
Cochran in Shape
Cocliran is in good shape and could .
probably cover the quarter mile in
:49 2-5 or less Saturday, if that dis
tance were being run. He finished in
:49 1-5 in the dual meet with the
Cards. Ted Miller came second in that
event, but this was partially due to
the fact that he was running his first
440 against outside competition. Since
then Ted has been improving steadily
until at present he is being considered
as a possible winner at the I. C. A. A.
A. A. Miller and Cochran should run
neck and neck Saturday in the 400
meter, which is the metric equivalent
of 440 yards.
Elmer Boyden will always be
thought of as a dangerous contender
in the half mile or 800 meters when
ever he appears on the Farm, because
of his victory over Bill Richardson in
the freshman meet last year. Boyden
failed to place in the dual meet, and
last Thursday he could not gain on
Bill Swayne when the two of them
were running second for their respec
tive teams in the two mile relay at
the Stanford relays. Boyden is work
ing hard and he may be in tip-top
shape Saturday. If so, he may keep
right on Richardson's lieels.
Barber, Neufeldt, Becker, Francis,
Upson, Garrett, Boren, and the Dodson
brothers are the principal California
entries. The University of Nevada is
sending a trio of runners and jumpers.
The only other schools entering men
are the Fremont high school and the
San Mateo junior college.
None of the teams entered is power
ful enough to give the Cards much op
position, with the exception of the
Olympic Club. The Italian athletic
clubs will probably score heavily in
the distance events as they have a
strong field entered in these races.
