# THE 						DAILY PALO ALTO HALL OF FAME Al Masters, President of the A. S. S. U.
## 
### 
Students of the University have every right to congratulate themselves
on their good judgment last year in choosing A1 Masters for the presi
dency of the student body. He has turned out to be one of the strongest
and best-fitted men who have ever held this important position.
He has conducted himself and his office in a manner which is above re
proach. He has proved too big a man to let petty politics and jealousies
influence him. As the head of the Executive Committee, he has been in
strumental in putting the finances of the student body on a firm foundation.
It is Masters who is responsible for the idea of combining the duties
of the Graduate Manager and Student Manager under the former execu
tive. This sort sf insight on Masters' part is only possible because he is
thoroughly in touch with what is going on in the University.
In spite of jealous insinuations to the contrary, A1 Masters has done
his work impartially. Obstacles have meant nothing to him, and he has
gone on in spite of them, serving to the very utmost of his extraordinary
ability as an executive.
Not only here, but outside. Masters' worth has been recognized. Last
year, at Idaho, he was elected secretary-treasurer of the Pacific Student
Body Presidents' Association. As a member of the Board of Athletic
Control, he has been representative of student opinion and has won the
confidence and respect of the other members of the board.
In his work, Masters has been forced, at times, to follow his own judg
ment contrary to the dictates of some part of student opinion. In no case
has he stepped in the wrorig direction. He has made many friends through
his good work and he has forced those who have opposed him to respect
him.
At all times, he has had the courage to go ahead in the direction which
he has thought best. At this time of the year, with the annual election ap
proaching, the students may well hope that another man of Masters'
caliber will appear as a candidate for the presidency of the student body
next year.
