Strict amateur rulings arc necessary to unprofessional athletics but
there are limits to which they may be carried. The United States Lawn Ten
nis Association has by its adoption of the player-writer interpretation of
the amateur rule exceeded the natural bounds of common sense. In send
ing in their resignations for the Davis Cup team William Tilden and Vin
cent Richards are hardly to be blamed.
There is no valid reason why a man with even fair ability to write
articles should be declared of professional standing. The union of phy
sical prowess with mental achievement is hardly a just basis for declaring
him a professional athlete. Undoubtedly Tilden and Richards have capi
talized their fame built up through their success at tennis, but this would
count for as much toward success in the insurance business or selling bonds.
In the case of Tilden he has done more for the advancement of tennis
in America than anyone in the conutry, including the august Tennis As
sociation itself. He and Richards have gone on long barnstorming trips
through the United States and in return they arc rewarded for their pains
by an apparently well-meaning but equally unfair ruling. The Lawn Ten
nis Association has leaned over backwards in a laudable attempt to set an
example in purifying American amateur athletics and it would be well for
it to reconsider its action. â€”Daily Princetonian.
