Speaking of the Junior Opera—the
more we see of these co-eds, the better
we like them.
And to think of the thousands that
Coles Philips gets paid for painting
girls like these.
One of the chorus ladies told us that
the boy with the automobile name was
so funny because he was so sober
about it all. (But she doesn't know him
as well as we do.)
The same girl was indignant at one
of the chorus men. She said: "He
made some remark about me, and I
gave him a dirty 100k —under his
breath." Well —of course . English
2A is still open.
There wasn't a foul ball in the
chorus. Some of them weren't home
runs to be sure, and may have reached
first base on an error, but really they
were a sweet bunch of girls.
And the men's line-up. Did you ever
see anything better? So clean-looking
—of course it was Saturday night and
all that.
Wasn't that a good imitation the
Deacon gave of pouring a drink? And
didn't he dance well? But then, prac
tice makes perfect. Let that refer to
his dancing if you want to.
And Blair —in his Bahama dinner
coat. Bear skin, you know, or however
you spell it.
But then, Spring is almost over. For
four weeks these girls have been rush
ing in an effort to get the Opera done.
Now that iCs over you'd think they'd
stop. But they won't; so we will.
