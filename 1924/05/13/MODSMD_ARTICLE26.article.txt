# THE 						FUTURE CITIZEN
## 
### 
The college bureau of the Republi
can National committee is engaged in
the task of establishing Republican
clubs in the colleges and universities
of the United States, where under
graduates may discuss political issues,
enter into mock conventions, and learn
the fundamentals of American govern
ment.
The college student of today is the
man just entering into the privileges
of the voting American citizen. College
is the last opportunity the nation has
of instilling in him the desire to vote,
the interest in politics, that he must
have if he is to take an active part in
the affairs of his country. The demo
cratic government of the United
States, as well as every government
based on republican principles, is a
failure if the people do not vote. And
a large majority of them will not vote
unless their interest in popular ques
tions is aroused.
The college and university Repub
lican clubs will be performing a real
service if they succeed in accomplish
ing this. The move has received the
approval of educators everywhere, in
cluding Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur, presi
dent of Leland Stanford university.
Every effort is being made to co-oper
ate with the Republican National com
mittee. A similar move by the Demo
cratic party is assured. Rivalry of this
sort, fostered by the great parties, will
do much toward making college men
active citizens. â€”The Michigan Daily.

Life at Columbia University is to be

cover every phase of activity on the
campus.
