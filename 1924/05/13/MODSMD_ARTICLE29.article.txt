## Did You Know That- ? 
### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
The Peerless Ty has been replaced by a pinch hitter, and has been known
to go hitless out of 7 times at bat in one game? (But it isn't the usual thing.)
Why, Ty!
Dempsey's eyesight, developed by constantly watching his opponents' blows,
is so keen that he can read the label on a revolving phonograph record? If
you think it's easy, just try it.
George Lott, National junior lawn and clay court tennis champion, is also
a real he-pitcher, and on last April 18th pitched a no-hit, no-run game for
University High of Chicago? He fanned 18 of his opponents, the Blue Island
School, and issued no passes. The game was 7 inning and the score was 8 to 0.
