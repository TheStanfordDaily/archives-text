# HARVARD LAW PROFESSORS ENGAGE IN OUTSIDE PRACTICE

### 
One of the outstanding features of |
the Harvard Law School is the fact j
that each of its teachers is active in
the profession, thus not confining i
themselves too much to the academic
side, but broadening out into the prac- ;
tical. In other words, they are alive I
to what is going on outside the halls
of learning and are aware that active i
employment of their profession is ne-1
cessary to the correct understanding
and teaching of it. It is a fact that no '
other school of prominence takes this
into consideration and perhaps herein
lies the secret of Harvard's pre-emi
nence in this line of education.
The first intercollegiate debate by
radio was held recently when the Uni
versities of Oregon and California dis
cused the question, "Resolved, That the
Bok Pcace Plan be Adopted." An un
usual feature of the debate was the ex
change of briefs between the opposing
teams. This was done in order to in
sure a direct clash of the major issues
under discussion.

One-half of the world's present sup
ply of diamonds is held in the United
States, according to the National City
Bank of New York.
Panhellenic handbooks at the Ohio
State University give the history of all
fraternities and other campus organiza
tion.
