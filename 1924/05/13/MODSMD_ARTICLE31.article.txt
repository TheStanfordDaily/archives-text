# WRITING OF SHAKESPEARE CALLED FORGERY BY SCHOLAR
## 
### 
The name of William Shakespeare,
written under six lines of script and
accepted by scholars generally as the
handwriting of the Bard of Avon, is
pronounced a forgery by Dr. Horace
Howard Purness, Jr., Shakespearian
scholar of Philadelphia.
The fragment of manuscript was
brought to this country in 1921 by
Charles Sessler of Philadelphia, who
discovered it pasted in the flyleaf of
a second folio he purchased in Lon
don.
By a careful comparison of the
handwriting in the Sessler manuscript
with samples of Shakespeare's Doctor
Purness decided the script was not
the work of the dramatist. The scholar
then deciphered certain "key" words
and found it to be an incorrect copy
of part of the "profession" of the
Shakespeare forger, William Henry
Ireland, who was born many years
after Shakespeare's death.
A considerable percentage of the
human race is enrolled under the ban
ner of destruction of wild life, says
Nature Magazine. In the United States
alone there are six million hunters
and tens, if not hundreds, of thousands
of trappers.
