# OLD FOOTBALL FIELD WILL BE REJUVENATED AT RUTGER
## 
### 
The oldest gridiron field in America
is to be put in use after a century of
idleness. Rutger University is going
to make an athletic field on the site
where Princeton and Rutgers played
the first football game in America, on
November 6, 1869. On this lot in
New Brunswick, N. J., an old weather
beaten tablet, hardly legible, is all
that commemorates the advent of foot
ball in America.
