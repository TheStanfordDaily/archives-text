# FISH COLLECTION OF ZOOLOGY DEPARTMENT CONSIDERED FINEST IN THE UNITED STATES
## 
### John Levi 
It is not generally known by Stanford
students and alumni that one of the finest
museum collection of fish in the world is
stored in the basement of the Zoology
building. Although the collection is only
the second largest in the United States it
is regarded as the finest because of the
systematic way in which the specimens
have been accumulated and catalogued.
One thousand four hundred fifty types
are included that have been carefully
preserved in glass jars. There have
been no large single gifts made; so
ample time has been given to observe all
the fish closely at the time they were
collected.
A small collection was brought to the
University at the time it was opened by
Doctors Jordan and Gilbert. These speci
men were chiefly from Alaska, Califor
nia, and the Mississippi River.
Extensive operations were conducted
in Japanese and Hawaiian waters by
Stanford men under the supervision of
the United States government in the
years 1901, 1902, 1900. At this time there
were only 650 known species of Pacific
fish but these trips added 580 new types,
and gave Stanford the best collection of
Pacific Ocean fish in the world. The
European collection is very fine but does
not equal the Pacific coast collection.
Professor J. O. Snyder who is in

charge of the collection has carefully
avoided making it a storehouse for mis
cellaneous gifts of doubtful value. Every
specimen has been tagged and carefully
preserved as soon as it came into his
hands. The specimens have aided the
University in contributing materially to
all the investigations that have been con
ducted by the various fish and game
commissions and to the research work
that has been conducted to determine the
aid that fish will render in preserving
our national food supply.
The money value of the collection can
not be estimated but it is certain that at
least several hundred thousand dollars
would be required to duplicate it; how
ever many of the types could never be
found again due to the fact that they
are cither extinct or the great difficulty
that was encountered in finding them
originally.
If the proposed building campaign is
put through the zoology department will
have more room in which to keep this
valuable collectoin. Curatorian care
would also be a great benefit.
The chief places that are still opened
to investigation are the central part of
Asia and the west coast of South Amer
ica. The other districts of what arc
termed the "pacific waters" have been
already thoroughly covered.

Extensive operations were conducted
in Japanese and Hawaiian waters by
Stanford men under the supervision of
the United States government in the
years 1901, 1902, 1900. At this time there
were only 650 known species of Pacific
fish but these trips added 580 new types,
and gave Stanford the best collection of
Pacific Ocean fish in the world. The
European collection is very fine but does
not equal the Pacific coast collection.
Professor J. O. Snyder who is in

charge of the collection has carefully
avoided making it a storehouse for mis
cellaneous gifts of doubtful value. Every
specimen has been tagged and carefully
preserved as soon as it came into his
hands. The specimens have aided the
University in contributing materially to
all the investigations that have been con
ducted by the various fish and game
commissions and to the research work
that has been conducted to determine the
aid that fish will render in preserving
our national food supply.
The money value of the collection can
not be estimated but it is certain that at
least several hundred thousand dollars
would be required to duplicate it; how
ever many of the types could never be
found again due to the fact that they
are cither extinct or the great difficulty
that was encountered in finding them
originally.
If the proposed building campaign is
put through the zoology department will
have more room in which to keep this
valuable collectoin. Curatorian care
would also be a great benefit.
The chief places that are still opened
to investigation are the central part of
Asia and the west coast of South Amer
ica. The other districts of what arc
termed the "pacific waters" have been
already thoroughly covered.
It is not generally known by Stanford
students and alumni that one of the finest
museum collection of fish in the world is
stored in the basement of the Zoology
building. Although the collection is only
the second largest in the United States it
is regarded as the finest because of the
systematic way in which the specimens
have been accumulated and catalogued.
One thousand four hundred fifty types
are included that have been carefully
preserved in glass jars. There have
been no large single gifts made; so
ample time has been given to observe all
the fish closely at the time they were
collected.
A small collection was brought to the
University at the time it was opened by
Doctors Jordan and Gilbert. These speci
men were chiefly from Alaska, Califor
nia, and the Mississippi River.
