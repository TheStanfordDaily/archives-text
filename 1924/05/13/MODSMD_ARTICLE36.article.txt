# EDISON BELIEVES MEN OF TODAY LACK IMAGINATION

"There is a lack of men capable of
designing automatic machinery," says
Thomas Edison in System. "We are
increasing our knowledge of the pos
sibilities of automatic machinery at
the rate of 100 and we are increasing
the capable of putting the ideas into
effect at two. No educational or tech
nical institution that I know of is even
attempting to develop men for this all
important phase of industry.
"This is an extremely serious prob
lem. 1 had much less trouble getting
men forty years ago than I have
today. The men of today seem to lack
imagination. I have examined 1800
men for positions in the last two
years. I took eighty of them and of
that eighty only thirty-live lasted. I
test out the men with a questionnaire,
in which I put live little mathematical
problems which I took from a child's
I notebook on arithmetic. Not one man
I as yet has correctly answered all live
of the problems."
According to plans formulated by
the W. A. A. at the University of Cali
fornia, women's sports will embrace
a wider field next semester. Canoeing
and hockey have been added to the
list of competitive sports, while in
creasing interest is being shown in
the rifle, crop, and saddle, and swim
ming clubs.
