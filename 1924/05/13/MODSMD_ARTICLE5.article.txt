## 
### 
King, the Sigma Chi bull pup, has a j
notch on his collar today. Yesterday ,
noon, egged on by a rabid mob of!
Greeks, the valiant canine disposed or |
a ferocious six-inch baby gopher snake.'
Executing a brilliant flanking move
ment, the pup surrounded the writh
ing reptile, and succeeded in inflicting j
a mortal wound on the back of its j
neck. Cheered to the echo by the ad-j
miring mob, the warrior finished the j
job up right by toting the remains to i
the front porch of the Delta Gamma
house, whether as a tribute to the fair j
inmates or as a warning to the human j
species, King refused to tell.
