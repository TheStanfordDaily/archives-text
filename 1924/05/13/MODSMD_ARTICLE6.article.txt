# FIRST SPRING OPEN GOLF TOURNAMENT PLANNED MAY 20-22
## 
### 
Any person connected with the Uni
versity is eligible to enter the first
spring open golf championship ever
held at Stanford. May 20, 21, and 22
have been set aside as tentative dates
by Reg Hirschman, golf manager.
Through the courtesy of the direc
tors of the Menlo Park Golf Club the
links of that organization will be avail
able for the use of the contestants
upon payment of the regular week day
green fee.
Play on Handicap Basis
The tournament will be played on
a handicap basis, and there will be as
many flights as are justified by the
number of entrants. Handicaps will
be so arranged as to give novices an
I even chance against the veterans,
j Prizes are offered for the champion
for the winner on each flight.
Judging by the interest already
manifested by campus niblick wielders
the tourney will be the biggest and
most hotly contested links battle ever
held at Stanford. The Encina Golf
i has agreed to turn out en masse and
"Dink" Templeton and his fellow men
! tors will be on hand to uphold the
honor of the faculty.
Competition Keen
Against this formidable array of
' talent the varsity golfers will be hard
pressed to retain their laurels and their
right to represent Stanford against
j outside opposition. "Dink's" 86, which
made him an easy winner in the re
cent match with the California coach
es, marks him as a likely contender.
With such men as Byerly, Klauber,
Leiter, McLean, Lang, and Macabee
I representing them, the freshmen of
the Encina organization are expected
: to put in a strong bid, also.
In the University golf tourney held
last fall, Fritz Ditzler led a field of
forty, entrants, but the great gains
made by the royal and ancient game
in popular favor on the campus since
! that time point to an entry list of al
most twice that number next Tuesday.
Similar Event at Washington
In a similar competition held recent
ly at the University of Washington,
250 links enthusiasts vied for suprem
acy. Jack Westland, Husky representa
tive in the intercollegiate champion-
I ships held at Del Monte in February,
| was runner-up.
A fifty-cent entrance fee will be
! charged in order to provide for prizes.
{ Entries may be made at the gym up
till Monday night, or may be mailed to
Reg Hirschman, Box 734, Campus.
