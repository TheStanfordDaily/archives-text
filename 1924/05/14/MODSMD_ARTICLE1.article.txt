# CANDIDATES FOR QUAD MANAGER EDITOR CHOSEN
## Tryout Board Selects Men Who Will Be Balloted In Quad Election 
### 
Five candidates for Quad editor and
two for Quad manager were nominated
at a meeting of the Quad tryout board
last night.
The editorial nominees and the
points earned by each follow: Leon
B. Brown, Basil L. McGann,
3050; Delmer L. Daves, 2912%; Jack
W. Hardy, 2823%; and Byron I). Wil
liams, 2477.
The managerial candidates and their
respective ratings are: Raymond M.
Kay, 2891, and F. Lowell Matthay,
2381. The names of these candidates
will appear on the ballot at the student
body election next Tuesday. Only
sophomores are eligible to vote.
Nomination Made on Ratings
All nominees were selected on the
basis of the reports made by the Quad
management to the tryout board. The
report on the candidates for manager
was made up on the basis of points
Â«arned for sales of books, advertising
sales, organization collections, and
miscellaneous work. The editorial re
port is based principally on points for
hours of work.
In addition, the following five fac
tors, named in order of importance,
have been taken into consideration in
both reports: dependability, accuracy,
ability, initiative, and speed. Each
man was then rated as to his probable
ability as a Quad editor or manager,
all possible factors being taken into
consideration. The compound ratings
represent, therefore, the manage
ment's estimate of the candidates as
well as the actual work done.
Brown, Kay 'Lead
Brown and Kay have substantial
leads in their respective departments.
Daves, Hardy, and McGann are prac
tically tied for second in the editor
ship ace. The complete report of the
Tryout board in making the nomina
tions follows: "In making the nomina
tion for editor, Brown clearly deserves
first place. The report of the Quad
management indicates that his work
has been of a consistently high cali
bre and that he has unquestionably
been the most valuable of the sopho
more assistants. The rating shows
that he has points, nearly a
third more than his next competitor.
Three Tie for Second Place
Daves, Hardy, and McGann have so
nearly the same number of points that
the board does not feel justified in
making a differentiation. The work of
all three men has been excellent.
Daves has been responsible for the
lettering of the sorority and Roble
pages, and for much other work con
nected with the artistic end of the
book. Hardy has had charge of the
taking of pictures for the athletic sec
tion. He has also done considerable
writing in connection with that sec
tion, as well as much routine work on
other parts of the book.
Of the members of the tryoutee
staff, McGann has done the major por
tion of the writing. He has had com
plete charge of the research work con
nected with the historical sketches
and four-color plates, one of the most
important features of this year's book.
He also wrote the entire faculty sec
tion. To Williams, the Board gives
third place. His assignments have
been concerned principally with the
organizations section, and have been
routine for the most part. His work
has been faithful and consistent.
Matthay Second for Manager
"On the managerial side Raymond
Kay deserves first place in the opinion
of the junior managers. He has shown
more initiative, more persistence, and
has done more work (as is indicated
by the total number of points) than
any other member of the staff. Mat
thay has run Kay a close second in
every department. The accuracy and
organization which Matthay has put
into his work is particularly commend
able, and the amount of work he has
done has been second only l(\ that
done by Kay.
A competitor of Kay and Matthay
during the year was William Fitzhugh
who worked under a handicap in that
he started three months after the
others.
