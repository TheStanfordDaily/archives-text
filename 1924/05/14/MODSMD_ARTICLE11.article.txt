# HAZEL HANSEN, '20, TELLS OF MOBBING IN GREECE
## Stanford Woman Studies at American School of Classics in Athens 
### 
Stories of being mobbed, and of
climbing hundreds of feet up swinging
ladders were told by Hazel Hansen,
Stanford, '20, in a letter recently re
ceived by Dr. A. T. Murray.
Miss Hansen took her master's de
gree at Stanford and has been studying
for the last two years at the American
School of Classical Studies at Athens
where she was for the past year a Fal
low. She expects to return to Stanford
for work on her doctor's degree this
fall. Miss Hansen is much interested in
archeology and because of this took a
trip through the unfrequented parts of
Thessaly, together with a friend.
Visitors, she said, are very rare in
Thessaly and are consequently re
garded with suspicion. In one town

she and her friend were mobbed by a
crowd of 200 children which they were
unable to break up. until the school
master arrived. He severely repri
manded all except the leaders who had
run away at his appearance, and apolo
gized profusely. The women left the
next day, but were asked for their story
by a policeman while they were waiting
for the train.
The policeman published a long ac
count iti the local newspaper, and
called the matter to the attention of
the minister of education at Athens,
who sent back the command that the
children should apologize or the school
master lose his place. In the meantime
Miss Hansen and her friend had gone
on and knew nothing- or the commotion
which their presence had started. On
their return they found a very fright
ened schoolmaster accompanied by
about ten repentent children bearing
flowers and a long document of apology
signed by all the children who had
made part of the mob.
When they went into the northern
part of Thessaly they were accom
panied by a military escort to protect
them from the famous brigands of
Thessaly. They were attacked one
night, but their guard succeeded in
driving off their assailants both at night
and in the morning.
They made a trip to the Meteora
Monastaries of which only four now
remain. Miss Hansen wrote that they
are still very beautiful, perched at the
top of a cliff three or four hundred feet
high. One reaches them by a net or
basket lowered from the top or by a
ladder. Only two of the monastaries
are open to women and they decided to
visit St. Stephen. The only monk who
lives there was away and they were
forced to climb several hundred feet up
a perpendicular ladder. By the time
they had gone about two hundred feet
the ladders swung out from the wall,
making the last hundred feet or so slow
and painful progress. Miss Hansen was
lowered in a net preferring, so she said,
to make the agony but five minutes in
stead of the twenty-five going up.

panied by a military escort to protect
them from the famous brigands of
Thessaly. They were attacked one
night, but their guard succeeded in
driving off their assailants both at night
and in the morning.
They made a trip to the Meteora
Monastaries of which only four now
remain. Miss Hansen wrote that they
are still very beautiful, perched at the
top of a cliff three or four hundred feet
high. One reaches them by a net or
basket lowered from the top or by a
ladder. Only two of the monastaries
are open to women and they decided to
visit St. Stephen. The only monk who
lives there was away and they were
forced to climb several hundred feet up
a perpendicular ladder. By the time
they had gone about two hundred feet
the ladders swung out from the wall,
making the last hundred feet or so slow
and painful progress. Miss Hansen was
lowered in a net preferring, so she said,
to make the agony but five minutes in
stead of the twenty-five going up.
Stories of being mobbed, and of
climbing hundreds of feet up swinging
ladders were told by Hazel Hansen,
Stanford, '20, in a letter recently re
ceived by Dr. A. T. Murray.
Miss Hansen took her master's de
gree at Stanford and has been studying
for the last two years at the American
School of Classical Studies at Athens
where she was for the past year a Fal
low. She expects to return to Stanford
for work on her doctor's degree this
fall. Miss Hansen is much interested in
archeology and because of this took a
trip through the unfrequented parts of
Thessaly, together with a friend.
Visitors, she said, are very rare in
Thessaly and are consequently re
garded with suspicion. In one town

she and her friend were mobbed by a
crowd of 200 children which they were
unable to break up. until the school
master arrived. He severely repri
manded all except the leaders who had
run away at his appearance, and apolo
gized profusely. The women left the
next day, but were asked for their story
by a policeman while they were waiting
for the train.
The policeman published a long ac
count iti the local newspaper, and
called the matter to the attention of
the minister of education at Athens,
who sent back the command that the
children should apologize or the school
master lose his place. In the meantime
Miss Hansen and her friend had gone
on and knew nothing- or the commotion
which their presence had started. On
their return they found a very fright
ened schoolmaster accompanied by
about ten repentent children bearing
flowers and a long document of apology
signed by all the children who had
made part of the mob.
