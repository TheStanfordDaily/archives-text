# MULLER ENTERS SIX P. A. A. MEET EVENTS
## Modesto Junior College and Humboldt Club to Have Contesting Teams 
### 
"Brick" Muller has entered six events
in the P. A. A. track and field meet Sat
urday, and he is expected to be a dan
gerous contender for points in all of
them.
Muller is probably California's great
est and most versatile track and foot
ball athlete. He is entering the meet
this week unattached, and his points
will not count for any club team.
"Brick" has signed up for the high
jump, broad jump, hop, step and jump,
discus, shot and javelin. Of these
events, his best chances are in the high
jump and hop, step and jump.
The Modesto junior college entered
a three-man team yesterday, and the
Humboldt club entered five men. These
men, and the events in which they will
compete are as follows:
Modesto—Johnson, 200 and 400-
meter dashes; Fleming, 400 and 800-
meter runs; Rajati, 400-meter hurdles.
Humboldt —E. Mancure, 100 and 200-
cure, 800, 1500, 5000, 10,000-meter runs;
Williams, 5000 and 10,000-meter runs;
Shcarn, 5000 and 10,000-meter runs;
and Anderes, 5000 and 10,000-meter
runs.
The pole vault will be one of the j
most closely contested events. Bill
Black and "Red" Morris, former Stan
ford and California stars, will be on
hand, and will try and prove to Guy
Dennis and Lauren Upson, present
Card and Bear vaulters, that they are
as good as they ever were. In addition,
R. H. Gartley, one of the best vauletrs
in the Hawaiian Islands, has entered
this event. Gartley is said to be cap
able of 12 feet 10 inches consistently.
It all takes about 6 feet 3 inches to
win the high jump. Work, of the Stan
ford freshmen, has done 6 feet 3 and
Anderson of the varsity squad has
cleared 6 feet 2y 2 this season. "Brick"
Muller is always at his best when the
competition is keenest and he can be
depended upon to give the two Stan
ford men a struggle. Carter is en
tered from Honolulu and he is con
sidered one of the leading high jump
ers from the Islands. Hampton, Cali
fornia freshman, and Troyer, of the
Olympic Club, are two other athletes
who will be in top form.
The present Olympic Games record
in the discus is 146 feet 7V4 inches.
"Tiny" Hartranft will be watched
closely as he has a good chance of
bettering this mark in the tryouts.
The shot put record is 48 feet 7 1-16
inches, which is also very likely to be
broken by "Dink" Templeton's phe
nomenal protege.
The broad jump record is 23 feet
inches. Paul Boren. the California
jumper, has a chance of bettering this
distance, as he has twice exceeded it
in meets during the past season. If
Boren has a good day he is likely to
land out more than 24 feet.
