## Arthur and Allen Tied for First Place With 2532 Counters Each 
### 
Jim Arthur of El Toro and Allen of
Delta Chi forged into the lead in the
race for intramural track honors yes
terday.
Both men are tied for first place
with 2532 points each. Walker Wells,
who led the field the first day, dropped
to third place because of a poor mark
in the shot put. Wells has 2436 points.
He is competing for Sigma Alpha
Epsilon. Cruikshank of Delta Upsilon
is fourth with 2384 tallies.
Allen has been consistent in all of
his events, while Arthur came to the
front because of his work in the shot
put. He took first in this event with
a heave of 40 feet 1% inches, a foot
and a half less than the record for
intramural meets, which he set last
year.
Allen Second Last Year
Allen was runner-up last year, com
ing second to Lou Minsky, who won
the individual high point man medal.
Arthur is expected to win the medal
this year, as he will far surpass the
other contestants in the discus. Allen
and Wells have a slim chance of out
scoring him enough in the half mile
run to place them ahead.
More than 250 track and field as
pirants tested their ability in the 120-
yard low hurdles and the shot put yes
terday. The low sticks were over five
flights of hurdles, and the best time
turned in was :14 flat, by Wells of
S. A. E. A time of :19 2-5 was neces
sary to qualify.
The preliminary heats in the mile
relay are laeing held today. The team
coming first in each heat will qualify
for the finals which will be held Fri
day. The preseht record is held by
Delta Upsilon, and the D. U.'s are
â– expected to be one of the strongest
contenders this year.
Half-Mile Tomorrow
The half-mile run and the discus
throw will be held tomorrow, begin
ning at 2 o'clock. C. W. Davis, who
has charge of the meet, is especially
anxious to have all men who can try
out at 2 o'clock in order to relieve
