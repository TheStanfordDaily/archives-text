# PHI SIGMA KAPPA, EL CUADRO NINES WIN LEAGUES 1, 4
## Robinson, Club Moundsman, Strikes Out Thirteen Opposing Batters 
### 
El Cuadro and Phi Sigma Kappa won
the championships in Leagues 1 and 4
in intramural baseball playoffs yes
terday.
El Cuadro took the measure of the
Beta Theta Pi nine 8 to 3, while Phi
Sigma Kappa downed El Campo 8 to
5.
Robinson's stellar mound work en
abled El Cuadro to win without much
trouble. He allowed the Betas but
five bingles; retiring thirteen by the
strike-out route and issuing no passes.
The eating club got away to a two
run lead in the first when Norberg,
lead-off man, and Robinson crashed
out circuit blows.
Alabaster Fans Ten
Alabaster of Beta Theta Pi twirled
a fair game, allowing eleven hits and
whiffing ten batters, but received very
ragged support. The Betas scored once
in their half of the first but went hit
less in the second while their oppon
ents tallied twice. Two fraternity run
ners crossed the plate in the third
while Alabaster held El Cuadro score
less.
From then on the game clearly be
longed to the club men. Neither team
tallied in the forth or fifth. El Cuadro
put the contest on ice in the sixth
by driving in two markers while Rob
inson struck out three Betas in suc
cession. The club men added another
pair of tallies in the seventh.
Beta Theta Pi tried vainly to rally
in its half of the last frame, but
Tibbe's triple was the only result. He
was left on third when his teammates
were put out in order by fast fielding
on the part of the El Cuadro players.
Phi Sigma Kappa started off in the
first inning when two runners crossed
the pan as the result of four singles.
In the second the Phi Sig nine came
back and chalked up three more tal
lies. The winning run was pushed
across in the third.
El Campo tried hard to overcome
the Phi Sig lead in the third when
four runs were scored. The club men's
only other run came in the sixth.
After the first two innings, Smith,
El Campo chucker, settled down, and
allowed but three more runs. The lead
was too great for the club men, how
ever, and Phi Sigma Kappa was never
headed.
The Phi Sig batters hit Smith's of
ferings to all corners of the lot. They
garnered seventeen hits. Two of these
were triples by Morrison. Johnson,
heaving for Phi Sigma Kappa, also
allowed seventeen hits. However, he
kept them scattered, and tightened up
in the pinches.
Drawings will be made soon for the
playoffs between the various league
champions, and the games will be
played next week.

An all engineers' magazine is being
contemplated at the University of
Idaho this spring.
