# Let's Choose the Right Ones

Next Tuesday is an important day, in fact one of the most important
of the present college year. On that day, the students of the University
will, by means of the annual Spring election, choose various student body
and class offices and vote on three very important amendments to the Con
stitution of the A. S. S. U.
Judging from the rapid rate at which nominations have been coming
in, it is evident that there is more than ordinary interest in the coming
election. This is exactly as it should be. There is no reason why there
should not be at least 2,000 votes cast Tuesday. Every Stanford man and
woman who is interested in the welfare of the University should get out
and vote. Those who fail to perform this most important duty are not
living up to their obligations as citizens of the University community.
The student body offices which are to be filled Tuesday are, President,
Vice-president, and Secretary of the A. S. S. U., five places on the Men's
Council, and four positions on the Executive Committee. In addition to
these, the juniors will vote for Quad Editor and Manager and the various
classes will choose their officers for the first half of next year.
Amendments to the Constitution of the A. S. S. U., relating to the
Men's Council, the conduct of the Quad, and the administration of the
finances of the Students' Organization Fund will be up for the approval
or disapproval of the students. Each of these amendments is of very vital
importance to every student who is interested in the welfare of the Uni
versity. The Daily Palo Alto has investigated the proposed measures
thoroughly and beginning tomorrow, will publish in this column a dis
cussion of each.
The spring election is the most important of the year. The three
student body officers, President, Vice-president, and Secretary act in very
important capacities. It is up to the students, not only to vote, but to cast
their ballots intelligently. It would be an ideal situation if all of them
could forget their little petty prejudices and jealousies and their political
"affiliations" and go to the polls to vote for the candidate who appears to
be the best fitted for the position. It is hard to conceive of such an atti
tude in the outside world of politics, but in a University, where all are sup
posed to be broad minded, it can reasonably be hoped for.
Five members of the Men's Council, one of the most important bodies
in the student organization of things, must be selected. These men, in
their relation to student government, can either accomplish a great deal
of good for the University or do a great deal of harm. They should be
chosen wisely.
A man and woman from both sophomore and junior classes will be
elected to the Executive Committee. This is the representative body of
the students and should be chosen with care.
Quad editor and manager positions, in the past few years, have been
filled strictly through merit and the results have shown up plainly in the
high quality of year book which has been produced. It is to be hoped that
the class of 1925 will use discretion in this year's election. Class offices,
while not as important as student body positions, should receive careful
attention.
With the election less than a week away, students should make it a
point to investigate the situation that they may go to the polls and vote
intelligently.

living up to their obligations as citizens of the University community.
The student body offices which are to be filled Tuesday are, President,
Vice-president, and Secretary of the A. S. S. U., five places on the Men's
Council, and four positions on the Executive Committee. In addition to
these, the juniors will vote for Quad Editor and Manager and the various
classes will choose their officers for the first half of next year.
Amendments to the Constitution of the A. S. S. U., relating to the
Men's Council, the conduct of the Quad, and the administration of the
finances of the Students' Organization Fund will be up for the approval
or disapproval of the students. Each of these amendments is of very vital
importance to every student who is interested in the welfare of the Uni
versity. The Daily Palo Alto has investigated the proposed measures
thoroughly and beginning tomorrow, will publish in this column a dis
cussion of each.
The spring election is the most important of the year. The three
student body officers, President, Vice-president, and Secretary act in very
important capacities. It is up to the students, not only to vote, but to cast
their ballots intelligently. It would be an ideal situation if all of them
could forget their little petty prejudices and jealousies and their political
"affiliations" and go to the polls to vote for the candidate who appears to
be the best fitted for the position. It is hard to conceive of such an atti
tude in the outside world of politics, but in a University, where all are sup
posed to be broad minded, it can reasonably be hoped for.
Five members of the Men's Council, one of the most important bodies
in the student organization of things, must be selected. These men, in
their relation to student government, can either accomplish a great deal
of good for the University or do a great deal of harm. They should be
chosen wisely.
A man and woman from both sophomore and junior classes will be
elected to the Executive Committee. This is the representative body of
the students and should be chosen with care.
Quad editor and manager positions, in the past few years, have been
filled strictly through merit and the results have shown up plainly in the
high quality of year book which has been produced. It is to be hoped that
the class of 1925 will use discretion in this year's election. Class offices,
while not as important as student body positions, should receive careful
attention.
With the election less than a week away, students should make it a
point to investigate the situation that they may go to the polls and vote
intelligently.

Next Tuesday is an important day, in fact one of the most important
of the present college year. On that day, the students of the University
will, by means of the annual Spring election, choose various student body
and class offices and vote on three very important amendments to the Con
stitution of the A. S. S. U.
Judging from the rapid rate at which nominations have been coming
in, it is evident that there is more than ordinary interest in the coming
election. This is exactly as it should be. There is no reason why there
should not be at least 2,000 votes cast Tuesday. Every Stanford man and
woman who is interested in the welfare of the University should get out
and vote. Those who fail to perform this most important duty are not
living up to their obligations as citizens of the University community.
