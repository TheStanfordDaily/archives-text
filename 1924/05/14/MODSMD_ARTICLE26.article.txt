# SPORTS OF 1924
## A 						Famous Battery 
### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
There is always a thrill for good ball fans in the announcement "for New
York —Bush and Schang"—for here is a battery that is one of the greatest of
modern times —one of the few that will rank with the immortal combinations
of Mathewson and Bresnahan, Walsh and Sullivan, and Brown and Kling.
Both Joe Bush and Wally Schange were formerly with Connie Mack's
famous Athletics and in October, 1913, they beat the Giants in one of the
world's series games at the Polo Grounds. Bush beat Mathewson with his
bullet delivery and Schang helped with a home run. Being pals, they decided
to celebrate with a double wedding and both were married on October 14, 1913.
Teo years rolled by and October 14, 1923, came around, with Bush and
Schang the star battery for the Yankees in their third world's series against
the Giants. Again they beat McGraw at the Polo Grounds, by way of cele
brating their wedding anniversary, and Joe pitched an even better game than
he did in 1913. Irish Meusel got a single, a double, and a triple, and made a
run, but no other Giant was able to get a hit or score off Joe's crafty delivery.
