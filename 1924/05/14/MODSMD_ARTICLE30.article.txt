# TALES FROM THE ARCHIVES
## 13. SAN FRANCISQUITO RANCHO 
### Esther Greenacre 
PROM the time when it was nothing save a barren waste covered with live
*â–  oaks and brush until 1890, when it became the Stanford campus, the San
Francisquito Rancho had a varied history.
The Rancho is that part of the old Palo Alto Ranch and present campus
lying in general between Mrs. Stanford's residence and the Quadrangle. It
is the only complete rancho included in the grounds of the University.

Prior to 1842, the Mexican grantj
period, California was entirely free
from American population. In the sin
gle decade between '32 and '42 the
whole valley from Mountain View to
San Mateo was reclaimed from the
Santa Clara Mission and divided into
seven grants ranging in size from 1400'
to 35,200 acres.
Buelna Occupies Rancho
In 1837 Antonino Buelna obtained
permission from the ex-mission Santa
Clara to occupy a place called San
Francisquito. The bounds of the place
as we know them now are about as
follows: the county road, San Fran
cisquito creek, the road back.of Se
quoia, and the railroad spur running
up past Encina. In '39 Buelna built an
adobe house on the bank of the creek
and lived there until his death. The
remains of the hut were washed away
seven or eight years ago. The Rancho
at this time was covered with a dense
growth or underbrush known as chem
isal. The Arrastrado Road, which
crosses the creek near the site of
Buelna's home and runs back of Se
quoia, was simply a pathway through
the chemisal over which redwood logs
were dragged from camps in the moun
tains to the mills in Santa Clara. San
Francisco, twenty-eight miles away,
had a population of only 500 people.
Squatters Enter California
After Buelna's death, his widow,
Dona Concepcion Valencia, ran the
place herself until she married Fran
cisco Rodriguez of Monterey in 1844.
The country was now a part of the
United States and had reached the end
of the peaceful Mexican period. Ameri
can land-grabbing or squatterism be
came prevalent during the next few
years.
Between *51 and '54 a great uncer
tainty as to the title of the future
campus was in the air. By sheer crook
edness, Casa Nueva, an ex-consul from
Chile and a San Francisco lawyer, se
cured a deed to the entire ranch. About
this time, Rodriguez killed a man at
a Spanish celebration held at the no
torious old Woodside saloon, and he
was forced to flee.
Shanties Built on Campus
One by one the American squatters
settled on the ranch. In '51, Julian, a
Frenchman, built a shanty in front of
the present museum site; Thomas
Bevins located where the cactus gar
dens are situated; Jerry East's home
was on the present site of Dr. Jordan's
old home; William Little settled near
Mrs. Stanford's residence, and Sandy
Wilson occupied a house near the
original Buelna adobe. When Rodri
guez left, Wilson moved into his adobe
hut. His successor, John W. Lockers,
was the last occupant of the adobe.
Gordon Buys Estate
In the spring of '62 a great flood
played havoc with most of the squat
ters. Shortly after this George Gor
don, a wealthy San Francisco business
man, bought out the various squatters
and in '65 secured the title to the
whole ranch for $250 from one of
Buelna's heirs. Gordon laid out several
drives and built a fine home which
later, altered and enlarged, served as
Mrs. Stanford's home. Gordon died in
1869 and in the following year Senator
Stanford bought the estate, which
formed the foundations of the famous
Palo Alto Ranch and the present site
of the University.
