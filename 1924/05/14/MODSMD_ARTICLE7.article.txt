## Describes Ancient Treasures At Cambridge; Tells of Governing Body 
### 
According to Dr. George H. F. Nut
tall, Quick Professor of Biology, and
Fellow of Magdalene College, Cam
bridge, who gave an illustrated lec
ture on "The Ancient University of
Cambridge (England)" last evening,

made great by the many notables in
all walks of life who have attended
there.
"In the eleventh century Cambridge
was of considerable importance, be
cause students came there from Ox
ford; in the thirteenth century, they
came even from Paris," said Dr. Nut
tall, "but it was not a university in the
modern sense of the word until the
Renaissance in the sixteenth century."
Among the lists of great men who
attended Cambridge are poets, dra
matists, writers of fiction, classical
scholars, a diarist, historians, states
men, philanthorpists, philosophers,
men of science, and musicians.
Dr. Nuttall summarized the govern
ment of the University. The Senate,
the governing body, over all Univer
sity affairs, elects as its head a vice

with the degree of M.A. or higher.

heads of colleges, in rotation, accord
ing to ability.

boards of study, which correspond to

Study.

"There is nothing corresponding to
the alumni association in England,"
he said. "The affections of the men
are centered in their individual col
leges, and it is not until lately that
any grants of money have been given
to the university instead of the col
leges."
A lack of the pension system was
also an important lack but changes
arc cow being made to better these
conditions gradually.
Telling of the treasures contained

Nuttall showed a picture of a first
century manuscript, which is the very
first in any language, giving the Ten
Commandments.
Dr. Nuttall gave a full description of

touched seventeenth century library
in the world."

as it originally was, in the most care
ful manner, and according to sizes of
the books, are many valuable manu
scripts.

Queen Victoria began to keep a
diary at the age of thirteen.

Dr. Nuttall gave a full description of

the Samuel Pepys collection of books,
which is in the possession of the uni
versity. He said, "This is the only un
touched seventeenth century library
in the world."
In this collection, which is arranged
as it originally was, in the most care
ful manner, and according to sizes of

According to Dr. George H. F. Nut
tall, Quick Professor of Biology, and
Fellow of Magdalene College, Cam
bridge, who gave an illustrated lec
ture on "The Ancient University of
Cambridge (England)" last evening,
the name of the university has been
made great by the many notables in
all walks of life who have attended
there.
"In the eleventh century Cambridge
was of considerable importance, be
cause students came there from Ox
ford; in the thirteenth century, they
came even from Paris," said Dr. Nut
tall, "but it was not a university in the
modern sense of the word until the
Renaissance in the sixteenth century."
Among the lists of great men who
attended Cambridge are poets, dra
matists, writers of fiction, classical
scholars, a diarist, historians, states
men, philanthorpists, philosophers,
men of science, and musicians.
Dr. Nuttall summarized the govern
ment of the University. The Senate,
the governing body, over all Univer
sity affairs, elects as its head a vice
chancellor, composed of all graduates
with the degree of M.A. or higher.
Vice-chancellors are chosen from the
heads of colleges, in rotation, accord
ing to ability.
Representatives from all the special
boards of study, which correspond to
our faculties, according to Dr. Nuttall,
are members of the General Board of
Study.

"There is nothing corresponding to
the alumni association in England,"
he said. "The affections of the men
are centered in their individual col
leges, and it is not until lately that
any grants of money have been given
to the university instead of the col
leges."
A lack of the pension system was
also an important lack but changes
arc cow being made to better these
conditions gradually.
Telling of the treasures contained
in the university library, which is one
of the four largest in England, Dr.
Nuttall showed a picture of a first
century manuscript, which is the very
first in any language, giving the Ten
Commandments.
