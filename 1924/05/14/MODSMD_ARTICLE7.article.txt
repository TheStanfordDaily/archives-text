# NUTTALL TRACES UNIVERSITY STORY BY ITS GRADUATES
## Describes Ancient Treasures At Cambridge; Tells of Governing Body 
### 
According to Dr. George H. F. Nut
tall, Quick Professor of Biology, and
Fellow of Magdalene College, Cam
bridge, who gave an illustrated lec
ture on "The Ancient University of
Cambridge (England)" last evening,
the name of the university has been
made great by the many notables in
all walks of life who have attended
there.
"In the eleventh century Cambridge
was of considerable importance, be
cause students came there from Ox
ford; in the thirteenth century, they
came even from Paris," said Dr. Nut
tall, "but it was not a university in the
modern sense of the word until the
Renaissance in the sixteenth century."
Among the lists of great men who
attended Cambridge are poets, dra
matists, writers of fiction, classical
scholars, a diarist, historians, states
men, philanthorpists, philosophers,
men of science, and musicians.
Dr. Nuttall summarized the govern
ment of the University. The Senate,
the governing body, over all Univer
sity affairs, elects as its head a vice
chancellor, composed of all graduates
with the degree of M.A. or higher.
