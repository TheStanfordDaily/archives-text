# JUNIOR TEAM WINS CHAMPIONSHIP IN INTERCLASS SOCCER
## 
### 
As a result of the junior's 1-0 victory
over the sophomores last week, they
have been awarded the interclass soc
cer championship.
The schedule drawn up was not fin
ished, due to the freshman team de
faulting their games this quarter with
the seniors and juniors. When the
junior team defeated the sophomores
last week it left the '26 class with a
perfect record of three wins and no
defeats. The junior team defeated the
seniors by a score of 3 to 1.
The freshman outfit were considered
to have the best chance of winning
the championship until they were de
feated in their first match with the
sophomores, 2 to 0. This contest was
protested by the freshmen due to the
fact that a number of men from other
classes played on both teams, because
of the inability to obtain full line-ups
on the day the game was played. How
ever, the protest was not allowed and
the freshmen defaulted the remainder
of their contests.
The junior team, on the whole, pre
sented a more experienced line-up,
better teamwork, and better knowl
edge of the game than any of the
other three teams. Much of the credit
for the juniors' success may be laid
to the playing of Rogers, Off, Ta'am,
and Cardosa. These men were the
leaders on both offense and defense.
The complete list of the juniors'
players follows: Rogers, goal; Smith,
lh; Clark, rh; Off, ch; Cannon, rf;
Polland, If; Ta'am, cf; Achison, or;
Quigley, ol; Cardosa, ir; C. Carey, il.
