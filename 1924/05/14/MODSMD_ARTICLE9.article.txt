# WHITE IS FAVORED TO TAKE TITLE IN A.A.U. HIGH DIVING
## National Junior Half-Mile and Mile Swims Are Also Scheduled 
### James Adams 
Among the strongest contenders for
the National A. A. U. high diving
championship, which is to be held at
Searseville lake on Sunday will be
A1 White, national Spring Board cham
pion, who will attempt to bring Stan
ford a third title.
Clarence Pinkston, present world
high diving champion and formerly of
Stanford, is given the edge on other
candidates and will provide White's
chief source of opposition.
Dave Fall, who placed third in the
P. A. A. diving contest, and John
Kenney. promising freshman diver,
are the other Cardinal entries.
Olympics Have Three Entries
The Olympic Club will enter two
strong possibilities besides Pinkston
in Tommy McKee and A1 DeFerre.
McKee and DeFerre took second and
third, respectively, in the invitational
diving contest, last Sunday. The en
tries have not been coming in very
fast but the next few days are ex
pected to bring the names of several
divers from Los Angeles and possibly
some eastern contenders.
On the same afternoon the national
junior half-mile and mile swims will
be held. Contestants for these events
will be made up mostly of swimmers
around the Bay district. Coach Brand
sten plans to enter Allen, Brooks, and
Langley in the 880 and Stevenson and
Williams in the mile. Allen in the half
and Stevenson in the mile look lik'j
Stanford's best bets but it is not
known now what kind of competition
they will run up against as only a few
entries have so far been received.
Mooney of Santa Clara University and
Leo Purcell of the Olympic Club loom
as the strongest prospects of those
already entered.
Hawaiians Fast
It has not been decided whether the
Hawaiians who are here for Olympic
tryouts will be eligible to compete or
not. If they should be allowed to enter
it is a cinch the Americans will have
to paddle fast to stay in the running.
Ernst Brandsten will see three
divers whom he has coached to na
tional championships perform on Sun
day, namely, Pinkston, White, and
Fall. These men will again be com
peting for a national title. Pinkston
will be there to defend his title against
White. No matter which of them wins
Brandsten is almost sure of seeing
one of his proteges win the laurels.
Wally O'Connor. Stanford swimming
star, who is out of school this quarter
training in the south for the Olympic
Games, is ineligible to enter the Na
tional Junior swims because of his
wins in the Intercollegiate meet at
New York last month.

An effort is being made by the Uni-!
versity of Indiana to have General j
Pershing and other high army officials
participate in the memorial services
that will mark the dedication of the
University $250,000 memorial stadium, !

known now what kind of competition
they will run up against as only a few
entries have so far been received.
Mooney of Santa Clara University and
Leo Purcell of the Olympic Club loom
as the strongest prospects of those
already entered.
Hawaiians Fast
It has not been decided whether the
Hawaiians who are here for Olympic
tryouts will be eligible to compete or
not. If they should be allowed to enter
it is a cinch the Americans will have
to paddle fast to stay in the running.
Ernst Brandsten will see three
divers whom he has coached to na
tional championships perform on Sun
day, namely, Pinkston, White, and
Fall. These men will again be com
peting for a national title. Pinkston
will be there to defend his title against
White. No matter which of them wins
Brandsten is almost sure of seeing
one of his proteges win the laurels.
Wally O'Connor. Stanford swimming
star, who is out of school this quarter
training in the south for the Olympic
Games, is ineligible to enter the Na
tional Junior swims because of his
wins in the Intercollegiate meet at
New York last month.

An effort is being made by the Uni-!
versity of Indiana to have General j
Pershing and other high army officials
participate in the memorial services
that will mark the dedication of the
University $250,000 memorial stadium, !
November 8.
Among the strongest contenders for
the National A. A. U. high diving
championship, which is to be held at
Searseville lake on Sunday will be
A1 White, national Spring Board cham
pion, who will attempt to bring Stan
ford a third title.
Clarence Pinkston, present world
high diving champion and formerly of
Stanford, is given the edge on other
candidates and will provide White's
chief source of opposition.
Dave Fall, who placed third in the
P. A. A. diving contest, and John
Kenney. promising freshman diver,
are the other Cardinal entries.
Olympics Have Three Entries
The Olympic Club will enter two
strong possibilities besides Pinkston
in Tommy McKee and A1 DeFerre.
McKee and DeFerre took second and
third, respectively, in the invitational
diving contest, last Sunday. The en
tries have not been coming in very
fast but the next few days are ex
pected to bring the names of several
divers from Los Angeles and possibly
some eastern contenders.
On the same afternoon the national
junior half-mile and mile swims will
be held. Contestants for these events
will be made up mostly of swimmers
around the Bay district. Coach Brand
sten plans to enter Allen, Brooks, and
Langley in the 880 and Stevenson and
Williams in the mile. Allen in the half
and Stevenson in the mile look lik'j
Stanford's best bets but it is not
known now what kind of competition
they will run up against as only a few
entries have so far been received.
