Vanishing Cream and
Powder Base
Few words in the entire dic
tionary of the toilette are as
important as these.
Every woman should use a
good vanishing cream to prevent
blackheads, enlarged pores, and
dry skin, to correct or prevent
roughness, redness or chaps, to
keep the complexion youthful
and fair, and as a base before
applying face powder.
Arbutus
Complexion Cream
fulfills all these important re
quirements, and does it well.
Furthermore, this cream con
tains peroxide of hydrogen. This
tends to preserve the texture of
the skin, do away with any sal
low appearance and eliminate
freckles.
Arbutus Complexion Cream is
delicately scented with the per
fume of May flowers. It is
greaseless, quickly absorbed and
delightful to use.
