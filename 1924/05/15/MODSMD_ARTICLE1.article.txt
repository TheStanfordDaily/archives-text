# TRACK, FIELD MEN TO TRY FOR P. A. A., OLYMPIC HONORS
## Cards, Olympic Club Strong Contenders; Ludeke to Throw Hammer 
### 
A galaxy of high class track and
field athletes will vie with each other
for honors at 2:30 Saturday afternoon
in the P. A. A. track and field meet
which will be held in the stadium.
As the P. A. A, meet is serving as
Olympic Games tryouts for Northern
California, Utah, Nevada, Hawaii, and
the Philippines, considerable attention
has been attracted to it and a large
field of entrants will take part in the
various events, which are being run
in metric distances.
The winners of the events, and such
others who make commendable times
and distances, will be sent to the na
tional tryouts at Boston in June. From
there, those who qualify, will be sent
directly to Paris to train for tlie Olym
pic Games.
Stanford, Olympic Club Strongest
Stanford and the Olympic Club have
the strongest teams entered, but in
addition the University of California,
the University of Nevada, the Hum
boldt Club, the Italian Virtus, the
Uuione Sportiva Italia, and the Mo
desto junior college are sufficiently
well represented to gather many points
from the two stronger and larger
teams.
Besides the clubs, a number of un
attached men are entered, the chief
of whom is "Brick" Muller, former
Bear satellite. Carter and Gartley of
Honolulu in the high jump and pole
vault are also capable athletes.
The first event on the day's program
will be the 10,000 meter walk, which
will take about 50 minutes. This event
is being held first so that the regular
track events can be run off in the
regular manner without idelay. Be
cause of the number of men signed up
in the 100 and 200 meter dashes, and
the 110 yard hurdles, trial heats will
be necessary.
In addition to the regular field
events the P. A. A. meet will also
have a hammer throw and a hop, step,
and jump. As the Cards have not had
much experience in these two events
it is doubtful if they will be able to
make many points. Ludeke will try
his hand at the hammer, and Ludeke,
Richman, Meeks, and Arthur will take
a whirl in the hop, step, and jump.
Ludeke placed at the N. C. A. A. in
the hammer throw, and may be able
to do as well Saturday, as he has
thrown the weight 165 feet.

California, Utah, Nevada, Hawaii, and
the Philippines, considerable attention
has been attracted to it and a large
field of entrants will take part in the
various events, which are being run
in metric distances.
The winners of the events, and such
others who make commendable times
and distances, will be sent to the na
tional tryouts at Boston in June. From
there, those who qualify, will be sent
directly to Paris to train for tlie Olym
pic Games.
Stanford, Olympic Club Strongest
Stanford and the Olympic Club have
the strongest teams entered, but in
addition the University of California,
the University of Nevada, the Hum
boldt Club, the Italian Virtus, the
Uuione Sportiva Italia, and the Mo
desto junior college are sufficiently
well represented to gather many points
from the two stronger and larger
teams.
Besides the clubs, a number of un
attached men are entered, the chief
of whom is "Brick" Muller, former
Bear satellite. Carter and Gartley of
Honolulu in the high jump and pole
vault are also capable athletes.
The first event on the day's program
will be the 10,000 meter walk, which
will take about 50 minutes. This event
is being held first so that the regular
track events can be run off in the
regular manner without idelay. Be
cause of the number of men signed up
in the 100 and 200 meter dashes, and
the 110 yard hurdles, trial heats will
be necessary.
In addition to the regular field
events the P. A. A. meet will also
have a hammer throw and a hop, step,
and jump. As the Cards have not had
much experience in these two events
it is doubtful if they will be able to
make many points. Ludeke will try
his hand at the hammer, and Ludeke,
Richman, Meeks, and Arthur will take
a whirl in the hop, step, and jump.
Ludeke placed at the N. C. A. A. in
the hammer throw, and may be able
to do as well Saturday, as he has
thrown the weight 165 feet.
A galaxy of high class track and
field athletes will vie with each other
for honors at 2:30 Saturday afternoon
in the P. A. A. track and field meet
which will be held in the stadium.
As the P. A. A, meet is serving as
Olympic Games tryouts for Northern
California, Utah, Nevada, Hawaii, and
the Philippines, considerable attention
has been attracted to it and a large
field of entrants will take part in the
various events, which are being run
