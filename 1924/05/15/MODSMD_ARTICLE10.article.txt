# INTRAMURAL RELAY RECORD LOWERED By BREAK
## Club Men Set Mark of 3:15 In First Upset of Year; Finals Tomorrow 
### 
Breakers club relay team won its j
heat of the mile relay in 3:15 yester
day afternoon, establishing a new in-!
tramural relay record.
The former mark was 3:17. The new
record in the relay is the only intra
mural track meet record which has
been shattered so far this year.
Other teams winning their heats yes-;
terday include Theta Xi, Sigma Alpha
Epsilon, Phi Kappa Sigma, and Theta
Chi. Teams winning their heats will
meet tomorrow afternoon in the
finals. The winning team will be j
awarded a placque, but will not be j
given points towards winning the in- j
tramural track and field meet. The
relay is entirely separated from the
other part of the meet.
880 and Discus Today
The events on the intramural card
this afternoon are the 880 yard run
and the discus throw. In order to
qualify in the discus a throw of 45
feet 6 inches is necessary. Perfect is
148 feet. In the half mile 2:42 is lie-;
cessary to qualify and 1:55 is the
time for which 1000 points is given. |
The only close race in the relay
yesterday was between the S. A. E. j
and Delta Upsilon teams. The D. U.'s
won the event last year, but they
could not keep up with the Sigma |
Alpha Epsilon runners, who kept a
slight lead and managed to breast the
tape a scant yard ahead of the last
year's winners.
The times made by the winners yes- !
terday were: First heat —Theta Xi,j
first; Zeta Psi .second. Time 3:22 2-5. j
Second heat —Sigma Alpha Epsilon, |
first; Delta Upsilon, second. Time
3:21 2-5.
Third heat —Breakers, first; Kappa
Sigma, second. Time 3:15.
Fourth heat —Phi Kappa Sigma,
first; Independents, second. Time
3:27 1-5.
Fifth heat—Theta Chi, first; Encina
club, second. Time 3:32.
From these times it appears that
the Breakers team will not have much
trouble taking first honors tomorrow.
The most opposition will probably
come from the S. A. E. runners. How
ever, with Gaspar, Carlsmith, and
Tarleton in their lineup the club men
have a considerable advantage. The
other members of the Breakers team
are Ross, Wool, Bogue, Bailard, and
Meiklejohn.
The two teams in the lead in the
intramural meet are Breakers and
Sigma Alpha Epsilon. As yet, no of
ficial standings have been announced
and so the exact positions of these
teams cannot be determined. El Toro,
Kappa Sigma, and Theta Chi are also
in the running for first honors.
