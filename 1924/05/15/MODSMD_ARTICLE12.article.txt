# PROGRESSIVE POWERS NOT INDICATED AT PRIMARIES
## Professor Green, 1910 State Convention Member, Traces Party History 
### Beatrice Flesher 
The last primary is no indication
of the waning of progressive strength
in this state, according to Professor
R. L. Green, of the Mathematics de
partment.
Professor Green was a member of
the state convention in 1910 which
inaugurated the progressive movement
in California, and for many years
was active in state politics and inter
ested in the progressives.
New Era in 1910
"The new era wlm-h began in 1910,
with the old party lines broken up,
left the conservatives of nil parties on
one side, and the social progressives
under Johnson," he says.
"This couditiou was maintained un

til Johnson took a radical stand
against the League of Nations and
became the leading isolationist in the
United States.
International Issue Complicates
"The International issue split the
party. As Johnson has been a
candidate ever since that time, the 1
straight issue has not been raised." 1
This is the explanation for the dis- i
appearance of Johnson's tremendous!
majority of a few years ago, ac cord- \
ing to Green.
"The isolationist attitude, contrast
ed with the co-operative attitude,
moved many progressives to vote |
against Johnson."
Green believes, however, that the
real progressive-conservative contest
will come in August, over the charac
ter and personnel of the next legisla
ture in the state primary.
He says, "The international issue
■will not be complicated with the state
situation. At least, this will be the
case, if Johnson attends to his sena
torial duties, and does not inject his
personality into the campaign for the
legislature."
Taking Stanford and Palo Alto as
good examples of progressive dis
tricts, Professor Green illustrated how
the international issue lost supporters
for Johnson. "Those who are for the
progressives and still desire a world
court have a hard choice to make," he
said.
Concerning the Democratic party in
California, it is so weak, with only
one out of every three to support it,
according to Green, that there is not
the interest and controversy to bring
out the real sentiment in the party.
McAdoo's victory in the state indi
cates that these Democrats are pro
gressive.

ested in the progressives.
New Era in 1910
"The new era wlm-h began in 1910,
with the old party lines broken up,
left the conservatives of nil parties on
one side, and the social progressives
under Johnson," he says.
"This couditiou was maintained un

til Johnson took a radical stand
against the League of Nations and
became the leading isolationist in the
United States.
International Issue Complicates
"The International issue split the
party. As Johnson has been a
candidate ever since that time, the 1
straight issue has not been raised." 1
This is the explanation for the dis- i
appearance of Johnson's tremendous!
majority of a few years ago, ac cord- \
ing to Green.
"The isolationist attitude, contrast
ed with the co-operative attitude,
moved many progressives to vote |
against Johnson."
Green believes, however, that the
real progressive-conservative contest
will come in August, over the charac
ter and personnel of the next legisla
ture in the state primary.
He says, "The international issue
■will not be complicated with the state
situation. At least, this will be the
case, if Johnson attends to his sena
torial duties, and does not inject his
personality into the campaign for the
legislature."
Taking Stanford and Palo Alto as
good examples of progressive dis
tricts, Professor Green illustrated how
the international issue lost supporters
for Johnson. "Those who are for the
progressives and still desire a world
court have a hard choice to make," he
said.
Concerning the Democratic party in
California, it is so weak, with only
one out of every three to support it,
according to Green, that there is not
the interest and controversy to bring
out the real sentiment in the party.
McAdoo's victory in the state indi
cates that these Democrats are pro
gressive.
