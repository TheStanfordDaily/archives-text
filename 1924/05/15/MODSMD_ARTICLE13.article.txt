# Lack of Funds Prevents Wrestlers and Boxers From Entering Olympics
## 
### 
No wrestlers, and probably not more
than one boxer will represent the
North Coast Section in the final Olym
pic trials to be held in the East this
month. This fact became apparent this
week when a check was made of the
financial condition of the Olympic
Committee for the section.
In spite of admissions charged to
the tryouts, and money received from
private subscriptions, the total is far
from being â€¢sufficient to send the ath
letes East.
It is just possible that some way
may be found to finance the trip, but
demands for money to defray the ex
penses of the American team have
been so great that . this is but a
remote possibility.
