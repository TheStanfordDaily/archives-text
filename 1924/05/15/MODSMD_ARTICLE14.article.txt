Election activities to date have

George Baker are the main and only
contestants for the presidency of the
A. S. S. U.; nobody has been nomi

some irregularity in one nomination.

Election activities to date have
brought the following results: a total
of fifteen nominations have been made
for the total of twenty-eight offices
to be filled; Charles Beardsley and
George Baker are the main and only
contestants for the presidency of the
A. S. S. U.; nobody has been nomi
nated for the office of secretary of
the student body; only one nomina
tion has been received for the Execu
tive Committee; the Men's Council
seems to be attracting much atten
tion, with six nominees; 1927 is the
only class to nominate candidates for
class offices.
Other than that, there appears to be
some irregularity in one nomination.
