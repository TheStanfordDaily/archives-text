# 1927 QUAD MANAGER TRYOUTS START NOW
## 
### 
Quad Managerial Tryoutees from the
Class of 1927 will have their first
meeting in the Quad office next
Wednesday at 7:15, and will begin
work immediately, instead of waiting
until next fall as in former years.
Any man in the freshman class who
is interested is invited to attend the
meeting, where the program of trial
for the position of manager will be
outlined. The tryout period will cover
the remainder of this quarter and all
of next year; thus those beginning
this year will get off to an early lead.
The manager is guaranteed a salary
of five hundred dollars and may iu
addition make certain commissions.
