# The 						Student Manager

That Article 2, Section 6, be changed to read as follows: ''That the
graduate manager be appointed student manager of the A. S. S. U."
This is the wording of the most significant and important amendment
011 which the students will vote at the spring election next Tuesday. If
the measure proj>osed in the above amendment fails to carry, it will be
indeed unfortunate.
The fact that the present Student Manager system has not worked
out is not. in any way, a reflection on the men who have held the
position. As a general rule, they have been efficient and have performed
their duties to the best of their ability.
However, the student who steps into this position at the first of the
year, is taken at an unfair advantage. He knows absolutely nothing of
the working of his office and very little of his duties. Associated with
him is a student body president who is little or no better acquainted
with the situation.
In view of the fact that on the average, about $85,000 passes through
the Student Organization Fund each year, it is evident that the Student
Manager should be well in touch with the way things run from the
outset. At the present time, he goes through the year, learning things
by bitter experience at the expense of the student body funds. A general
idea of just what the amount which passes through the Student Organi
zation Fund means, can be gotten from the fact that it cost thirty dollars
for each student in the University to participate in activities outside.of
athletics.
Under the proposed amendment, it would practically mean that the
students would have the services of the Graduate Manager, without cost
to them. Undoubtedly, the system would work out in such a way that a
student would be working in nearly the same capacity as the Student
Manager now works. However, he would be under the supervision of
the Graduate Manager, a man who is thoroughly in touch with the
situation, and would be acquainted with his duties and their importance
from the start.
Under the present system, by the time the Student Manager has
learned enough to make him valuable in his office, it is time for him
to vacate in favor of his successor.
None of the objections which have been advanced thus far will hold
water. The Graduate Manager is always thoroughly sympathetic with
the student viewpoint and is competent to handle student affairs. A
student will undoubtedly still act in the same capacity as the Student
Manager does now.
In view of these facts, the students would be making a grave mistake
if they failed to pass the proposed amendment.
Tomorrow, the proposed amendment in regard to the Men's Council
will be discussed in this column.
