Instead of his usual trip to South
Carolina to see the old folks at home,
"Pop" Harris has decided to try a
new way of enjoying himself during
the summer months.
Yesterday he requested a shiny five
dollar gold piece from the bank. "Pop"
said that he was "Goin' tuh sport
'round a little bit, and Ah wants tuh
look kindali spiffy, so All's goin' tuh
dress me up in mah good do's, goin'
tuh make me a watch chahm out'en
this yere gold piece, wear it on mah
vest, and walk 'round the campus."
"Pop" claims that he intends having
the time of his life while the studes
and studesses are away this summer.
