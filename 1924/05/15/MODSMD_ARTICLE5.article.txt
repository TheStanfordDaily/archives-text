# SEQUOIA FIRST NINE WINS IN LEAGUE 6; DEFEATS DELTA CHI
## Hall Men Have Clean Slate; Fijis Take Measure of Kappa Alpha 10-4 
### 
Sequoia First won the title in
League 6 yesterday by slugging its
way to an 18-12 victory over Delta Chi.
Sequoia has gone through the season
undefeated.
In the other games Phi Gamma
Delta triumphed over Kappa Alpha,
10-4, and Alpha Sigma Phi downed En
cina Third, 20-13. Los Arcos won by
default from El Toro. This finishes
the intramural series.
Both pitchers in the Sequoia-Delta
Chi battle were pounded to all corners
of the lot. Prior of Sequoia had a
shade the better of it, allowing eleven
hits, while his opponent, Reticker,
was found for eighteen. The former
moundsman struck out five batters
and the latter, one. Loose fielding by
both nines helped to boost the score.
Sequoia Deadly With Willow
Sequoia got in its deadly stick work
in two heavy innings, the first and
fourth. Delta Chi registered in every
frame but the second and third.
Cooper, lead-off man for the hall team,
connected for a four-bagger his first
time up, and his teammates batted
around for a total of eight markers.
Grace, pitching for Phi Gamma
Delta, let the Kappa Alpha batters
down with two hits, blanking them
until the last frame when they pushed
across four runs on a single, three
errors, and a walk. He whiffed eight.
The Fijis fell upon Garthwaite of
Kappa Alpha for fourteen bingles,
tallying in every inning but the first.
In the second, Chalmers, K. A. cen
terfielder, made a circus catch of El
liott's long fly and was so pleased with
himself that he cavorted around the
field with the ball just long enough
to let two runners score, one of them
making the trip home from second
base.
Alpha Sigma Phi and Encina Third
staged a slugging bee in which the
Alpha Sigs came out on top with thirty
bingles to Encina's twenty. Both nines
hit safely in every inning.
Finals Start Monday
Finals to determine intramural
supremacy will start next Monday. El
Cuadro, champion in League 1, will
mix with Kappa Sigma, League 3 title
holder. El Tigre and Sequoia First,
leaders in Leagues 5 and 6 respective
ly, will meet in the second game.
On Wednesday, the winner of the
El Cuadro-Kappa Sigma contest will
play Phi Sigma Kappa, victor in
League 4, and the team which comes
out on top in the El Tigre-Sequoia
tilt will take on Theta Xi, winner in
League 2.
Any ties which result from the two
days' play will be settled Friday and
the two surviving nines will meet in
the finals on the following Monday,
May 26.

Sequoia First won the title in
League 6 yesterday by slugging its
way to an 18-12 victory over Delta Chi.
Sequoia has gone through the season
undefeated.
In the other games Phi Gamma
Delta triumphed over Kappa Alpha,
10-4, and Alpha Sigma Phi downed En
cina Third, 20-13. Los Arcos won by
default from El Toro. This finishes
the intramural series.
Both pitchers in the Sequoia-Delta
Chi battle were pounded to all corners
of the lot. Prior of Sequoia had a
shade the better of it, allowing eleven
hits, while his opponent, Reticker,
was found for eighteen. The former
moundsman struck out five batters
and the latter, one. Loose fielding by
both nines helped to boost the score.
Sequoia Deadly With Willow
Sequoia got in its deadly stick work
in two heavy innings, the first and
fourth. Delta Chi registered in every
frame but the second and third.
Cooper, lead-off man for the hall team,
connected for a four-bagger his first
time up, and his teammates batted
around for a total of eight markers.
Grace, pitching for Phi Gamma
Delta, let the Kappa Alpha batters
down with two hits, blanking them
until the last frame when they pushed
across four runs on a single, three
errors, and a walk. He whiffed eight.
The Fijis fell upon Garthwaite of
Kappa Alpha for fourteen bingles,
tallying in every inning but the first.
In the second, Chalmers, K. A. cen
terfielder, made a circus catch of El
liott's long fly and was so pleased with
himself that he cavorted around the
field with the ball just long enough
to let two runners score, one of them
making the trip home from second
base.
Alpha Sigma Phi and Encina Third
staged a slugging bee in which the
Alpha Sigs came out on top with thirty
bingles to Encina's twenty. Both nines
hit safely in every inning.
