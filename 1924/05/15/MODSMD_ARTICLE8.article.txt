### James Adams 
Another attempt at the 440 yard

exhibition swimming meet tomorrow
afternoon in the Encina pool, accord
ing to the plans announced yesterday
by Ernst Brandsten.
Borg will make his second attempt
at the 440 yard mark, swimming
against a Stanford relay team com
posed of Brooks, Williams, Stevenson,
Belcher, and Stanley. The world rec
ord in the 440 yard free style for a
100 foot tank is held by Johnny Weis
muller with the time of 4:57 3-5. Re
cently in Honolulu Borg hung up a
new mark for this distance in a 100
yard tank of 4:59. In a shorter tank,
such as the 100 foot Encina tank, Borg
may be able to clip enough seconds

was discredited because of the inac
curate course at Searsville.

Williams, Sibbett, and Poulson will
compose the squad of the first year
men. Meyers and McCallister of the
varsity greatly bolster up the junior
team consisting of, besides those two,
Belcher, Ambrose, Draper, Hubbard,
and Gibbons.
The sophomores and seniors will
also mix. The '24 class, with Fletcher,
Hirschman, Kraemer, Flood, Fuller
ton, Wright t and Schmieder, look
capable of, taking the measure of the
sophomores. Their team is composed
of Mack, Langley, McGettigan, Allen,
Shumaker, Harris, and Carlsmith.
A relay race between the varsity
and the frosh is another event slated
for the afternoon. Williams, Steven
son, Brooks, Fletcher, Swartz, and
Stewart should make the varsity ex
tend themselves. Belcher, Allen,
Hirschman, Fletcher, McCallister, and
Carlsmith will swim for the varsity.
Brandsten is endeavoring to have
the Hawaiians enter several exhibi
tion events. White, Fall, and Pinkston

Another attempt at the 440 yard
record by Arne Borg, and interclass
water polo, will be the features in an
exhibition swimming meet tomorrow
afternoon in the Encina pool, accord
ing to the plans announced yesterday
by Ernst Brandsten.
Borg will make his second attempt
at the 440 yard mark, swimming
against a Stanford relay team com
posed of Brooks, Williams, Stevenson,
Belcher, and Stanley. The world rec
ord in the 440 yard free style for a
100 foot tank is held by Johnny Weis
muller with the time of 4:57 3-5. Re
cently in Honolulu Borg hung up a
new mark for this distance in a 100
yard tank of 4:59. In a shorter tank,
such as the 100 foot Encina tank, Borg
may be able to clip enough seconds
off his time to better "vVeismuller's
mark. His fast time, Sunday, of 4:52
was discredited because of the inac
curate course at Searsville.
Interclass water polo will.start when
the frosli tangle with the juniors. The
frosh have the edge with a team which
has been playing together all season.
Fletcher, Stewart, Brooks, Graham,
Williams, Sibbett, and Poulson will
compose the squad of the first year
men. Meyers and McCallister of the
varsity greatly bolster up the junior
team consisting of, besides those two,
Belcher, Ambrose, Draper, Hubbard,
and Gibbons.
The sophomores and seniors will
also mix. The '24 class, with Fletcher,
Hirschman, Kraemer, Flood, Fuller
ton, Wright t and Schmieder, look
capable of, taking the measure of the
sophomores. Their team is composed
of Mack, Langley, McGettigan, Allen,
Shumaker, Harris, and Carlsmith.
A relay race between the varsity
and the frosh is another event slated
for the afternoon. Williams, Steven
son, Brooks, Fletcher, Swartz, and
Stewart should make the varsity ex
tend themselves. Belcher, Allen,
Hirschman, Fletcher, McCallister, and
