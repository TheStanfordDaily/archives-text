## 
### 
"Lefty" May and "Bus" McCandless,
varsity outfielders, ran a close race
for premier batting honors in the ball
season just closed.
May, playing in fifteen games,
crashed the sphere for an average of
.383, while "Bus" came through in
twenty-five contests with a percentage
of .376.
While these two were the only ones
to enter the charmed .300 circle, the
average of the team as a whole was
fairly high. A final summing-up shows
the Stanford club to have hit for a
team average of .254.
Lawson, Woodward, and Johnston
ranked under the first two in the per
centage column.
Cuddeback and McCandless led the
other hitters in number of extra-base
smashes. Cuddeback hit five doubles
and three friples, while McCandless
came through with four two-base hits
and two homers.
During the year, the varsity knocked
out twenty-six bingles for two bases
each; eight blows went for three
sacks. Eight round trips were col
lected.
Roberts Leads in Times at Bat
"Shorty" Roberts, lead-off man, is
credited with the most times at bat of
any man on the team, having faced
the opposing hurlers no fewer than
one hundred and five times.
Roberts is also one of the fouf
Cards to play in every game, the
others being Cuddeback, McCandless,
and Fuller.
