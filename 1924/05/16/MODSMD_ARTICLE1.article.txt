# WHITE MAY WIN NATIONAL DIVING HONORS SUNDAY
## Pinkston, Fall, DeFerre to Enter A. A. U. Events At Searsville 
### 
Searsville lake will hold the interest
of diving circles Sunday afternoon at
o'clock, when the National A. A. U.
high diving championship is at stake.
Al White is favored to win his third
National title, although Clarence
Pinkston, present world's champion,
-who defeated White last year in the
same event is backed by many to re
tain his title.
By hard work, natural ability, and
coaching of Ernst Brandsten, White
has developed until he is now con
sidered by many to be one of the
ablest divers in the world. Pinkston
may come through and keep his lau
rels in spite of the little training that
he has been doing. It is certain that a
very few points will decide the issue.
Dave Fall will be the other Stanford
entry and should pull down a third,
although Al DeFerre of the Olympic
Club is a strong possibility to place.
Tommy McKee of the Olympic Club
is only conceded an outside chance of
getting in the running.
Eastern divers were expected to con
tend for the title, but due to the
proximity of Olympic tryouts, they
could not make the trip out here.
Divers of the Pacific Coast are re
ported to outclass the East's best, so
the winner of the event Sunday may
be considered to represent the cham
pionship of the country.
Stevenson looks capable of taking
the national junior half-mile race,
which is scheduled for the same after
