# ZOOLOGICAL EXPERT TO GIVE STORY OF TRAVELS TOMORROW
## 
### 
"The Travels and Experiences of a
Zoological Collector" is the subject of
a lecture to be given at the Assembly
hall tomorrow afternoon at 2:30, by
Frank H. Buck, who has been engaged
in this work for years.
Buck has collected live specimens of
wild animals and birds for the New
York Zoo, the Philadelphia Zoo, and
other American zoological gardens.
His travels have taken him through
Borneo, Java, the Malay states, and
India, and have given him an ac
quaintance with the habits and cus
toms of the natives in these sections.
The school boards of San Francisco
and Los Angeles recently employed
Buck to give his lecture before all the
high schools in the two cities, and he
has been recommended by the princi
pals of these schools as both interest
ing and educational.
An admission price of fifteen cents
for children is being charged by the
Palo Alto Union Federation of Parent-
Teachers Asociation, under whose
auspices the lecture is to be given.
