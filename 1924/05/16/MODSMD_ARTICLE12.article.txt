"Women in politics should be put
on a par with men," says Mrs. Jose
phine Rogers, wife of F. J. Rogers,
associate professor of physics at Stan
ford, who has just announced her can
didacy for state senator from the east
ern senatorial district of Santa Clara
county. She is running on the Repub
lican ticket.
"I am not a reluctant candidate. I
intend to campaign, and 1 will be
nominated and elected," says Mrs.
Rogers.
Four years ago Mrs. Rogers ran for
the same office as an independent, not
entering the primary race. She was a
"dry" and was afraid if she ran In
the primaries she would split the
"dry" vote and the "wet" candidate
would be successful. After the pri
maries she came out and made the

race for state senator.
Defeated by Osborne
Her opponent, Dr. O. F. Osborne,
the present incumbent, had received
the endorsement of the republican,
democratic, socialist, and prohibition
parties, and was backed by tha medi
cal associations, the bar association,
and the banks. Mrs. Rogers made no
campaign, had no manager, nor secre
tary, nor even a stenographer. Under
the circumstances she was advised to
be well pleased if she polled two thou
sand votes. The final count revealed
that she had received 4500 to Os
borne's 7000.
This year Mrs. Rogers is entering
actively into the primary campaign to
be nominated in the election in Au
gust. and is, in fact, the first candi
date in the field.
Her platform consists of Just two
planks: "The economic development
of the Santa Clara valley and human
welfare."
Hopes to Smooth Out Questions
Questioned as lo her stand on the
Japanese exclusion measure just
passed by Congress, Mrs. Rogers said,
"I do favor the exclusion of the Japa
nese. I surely hope the matter can be
smoothed over."
"I do not want to be called 'Mrs.'
Rogers while I am at Sacramento. I
want to be called 'Senator* Rogers.
The question of sex should not enter
into political matters. I believe that
there should be women in the legis
lature, just as there should be farmers
and bankers. A good man is as good
as a good woman. In fact," she added,
smilingly, "if it were not for the men
we women wouldn't be eligible at all."
Favors Woman President
"Would you be in favor of a woman
for president of the United States?"
she was asked.
"I would, if she had outstanding
ability and seemed to be worthy of
the position."
If Mrs. Rogers is successful she will
be the first woman to take a seat in
the California state senate. There
have been several women in the as
sembly.
