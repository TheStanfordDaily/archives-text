# Sophs Promise Rocky Affair at Maritime Ball Tomorrow Night
## 
### 
"A life on the ocean wave" is the
theme of the decorations and enter
tainment for the Sophomore Maritime
Ball to be given in the Pavilion to
morrow night. The floor may not
rock, but when the orchestra, all
decked out In sea-faring costumes,
begins to play "Roll'em Blues", the
effect will be just as good.
The Pavilion will be decorated in
the flags of the famous old yacht
"Nixie" and the general atmosphere
will be that of a bay shore yacht club.
The gang plank will be lowered at
9 p. m. and the ship will sail promptly
after the passengers have boarded.
Weather prophets predict a fair voy
age and easy sailing, and the trip is
open to all who enjoy the "rolling
deep."
