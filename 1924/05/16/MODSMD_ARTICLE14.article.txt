# MASTERS FOR ALL THREE AMENDMENTS
## A. S. S. U. President Explains Purpose of Student Manager Change 
### John Levi 
A1 Masters, president of the A. S.
S. U., is thoroughly in favor of all the
amendments that will be voted on by
the student body this coming Tues
day. Masters said, "I have not given
the first amendment, which pertains
to the Quad Board of Control, a very
close study, but I most heartily ap
prove, however, of amendments two
and three."
The amendment Masters is most
anxious to see passed is the third one,
which provides for the combining of
the duties of the student manager
with those of the graduate manager.
Masters himself framed this amend
ment and by way of explanation,
states: "The main thing that I wish
to impress is that the plan is not a
radical one. It will merely add a very
important duty to a man that is thor
oughly capable of performing it."
New Changes in Plan
The plan will not necessitate a
great many changes in student man
agement. It will not involve any great
expenditures to install, and once it is
operating it will be no more expensive
than the present system. It is certain
that the student funds will be han
dled on a much more efficient basis.
Last year over $86,000 went through
the hands of the student manager,
which is approximately $30 for every
student registered. Through no fault
of the student manager this money
was handled in a very loose fashion.
1 The difficulty is that as soon as the
manager has become thoroughly famil
iar with his duties another one is in
stalled and the routine of familiariza
tion has to begin once more. It is
incredible that a student who has to
devote a great deal of time to his
studies can handle the affairs in as
c-fficient a manner as can the gradu
ate manager who is familiar with the
work and who has an organization
that can look after the funds properly.
Advocates Council Amendment
Masters also advocates strongly the
amendment that provides for the elec
tion of two of the members of the
Men's Council at the February elec
tion instead of the election of all
the members at one time at the Spring
election. He believes that the three
men who remain on the board will
materially help to familiarize the new
men with the routine of their posi
tions. This plan has been agitated for
several years but this is the first time
that it has been brought to a "show
down."
Both President Wilbur and the Ex
! ecutive Committee have indorsed
I these amendments, which now await
i the sanction of the student body.

tions. This plan has been agitated for
several years but this is the first time
that it has been brought to a "show
down."
Both President Wilbur and the Ex
! ecutive Committee have indorsed
I these amendments, which now await
i the sanction of the student body.
A1 Masters, president of the A. S.
S. U., is thoroughly in favor of all the
amendments that will be voted on by
the student body this coming Tues
day. Masters said, "I have not given
the first amendment, which pertains
to the Quad Board of Control, a very
close study, but I most heartily ap
prove, however, of amendments two
and three."
The amendment Masters is most
anxious to see passed is the third one,
which provides for the combining of
the duties of the student manager
with those of the graduate manager.
Masters himself framed this amend
ment and by way of explanation,
states: "The main thing that I wish
to impress is that the plan is not a
radical one. It will merely add a very
important duty to a man that is thor
oughly capable of performing it."
New Changes in Plan
The plan will not necessitate a
great many changes in student man
agement. It will not involve any great
expenditures to install, and once it is
operating it will be no more expensive
than the present system. It is certain
that the student funds will be han
dled on a much more efficient basis.
Last year over $86,000 went through
the hands of the student manager,
which is approximately $30 for every
student registered. Through no fault
of the student manager this money
was handled in a very loose fashion.
1 The difficulty is that as soon as the
manager has become thoroughly famil
iar with his duties another one is in
stalled and the routine of familiariza
tion has to begin once more. It is
incredible that a student who has to
devote a great deal of time to his
studies can handle the affairs in as
c-fficient a manner as can the gradu
ate manager who is familiar with the
work and who has an organization
that can look after the funds properly.
Advocates Council Amendment
Masters also advocates strongly the
amendment that provides for the elec
tion of two of the members of the
Men's Council at the February elec
tion instead of the election of all
the members at one time at the Spring
election. He believes that the three
men who remain on the board will
materially help to familiarize the new
men with the routine of their posi
tions. This plan has been agitated for
