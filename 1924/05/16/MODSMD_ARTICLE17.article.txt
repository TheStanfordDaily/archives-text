# REDSHIRTS HAVE BEST MATERIAL IN P.A.A. MEET
## Miller After Revenge From Cochran of Olympics In 400 Meter Run 
### 
"Dink" Templeton will send the best
of his tracksters into the P. A. A.
meet tomorrow afternoon with the
hope of having most of them qualify
for the final Olympic games tryouts.
The meet is scheduled to start at
2:30, but the first event on the pro
gram, the 10,000 meter walk, which
takes almost an hour, will start at 2
o'clock.
Team Score to Count
The P. A. A. is primarily a contest
for individual performers. However
most of the athletes are entering under
some university or club colors and
so a team score will also be kept. Due
to the number of men competing in
each event the points should be scat
tered, with Stanford and the Olympic
club garnering the lion's share.
Stanford has the best material
entered, and as the Redshirts are in
better condition, it is probable that
they will repeat their perfomance of
last quarter, when they nosed out the
Olympians in most of the events.
400 Meter Run To Be Close
The event which will be watched
with greatest interest should be the
400 meter run in which Ted Miller
and Commodore "Racehorse" Cochran
are the strongest contenders. Miller
is out for blood because the "race
horse" beat him in the quarter in the
dual meet last quarter. Miller has im
proved greatly since that time and
the race tomorrow should decide
which one is really superior.
The sprints will also be close with
such men as Sudden, Newhoff, Barber,
Hale, and Campbell competing. Rich
ardson in the 880 meters should not
have much trouble in winning, nor
should Kerr in the 1500 meters.
Hartranft should come through with
wins in the shot and discus, but the
Cards will have to extend themselves
to take the other field events.
"Dionysia," an ancient Greek pa
geant, will be given on the lawn of
the University of Southern California
campus as the Spring Festival.
