Mertz Plays for Seniors
The seniors were easily the favo
rites in tennis, having several men
who were on the squad during the last
season, including Mertz and Hinckley.
Ttoey defeated each of the other class
es, the sophomores offering them their
only serious opposition.
The sophomores, having practically
the whole freshman team of a year
ago, took second, their only defeat
being that by the seniors. This was
the closest match of the competition,
with a score of 4-3, and all of the
Â©vents were hard-fought and close.
The juniors. In spite of Captain-elect
Overfelt, came third, and the freshmen
fourth.
