# Men's Council
## 
### 
That the following amendment to Article 5, Section 2, be voted:
"The men's council shall consist of five men, two of whom are to be
chosen at the February election and to hold office for one year. The
remaining three are to be chosen at the May election also to hold office
for one year.
"The requirements for membership are that the men who are to be
elected in May must have completed nine or more quarters of university
work by the time their term of office begins if elected, and those to be
elected in February must have completed seven or more quarters of
work in the University.
"In order to initiate this system the two lowest of the five high men
at the May election are to hold office only until next February."
Such is the wording of one of the amendments which will appear on
the ballot at the Quad election next Tuesday.
The advantages of this plan are so evident from the face of it that a
word of explanation should be sufficient. In the first place, it would be
very advantageous to have two members of the Men's Council hold
over from one year through half of the next. In this way, there will
always be at least two experienced men on the body. Under the present
system, all five members of the Council are chosen at the spring election
and they take office the following October, knowing little or nothing of
their duties. A disciplinary body such as the Men's Council needs
members who are thoroughly acquainted with the proper procedure in
any given case.
Under the proposed plan no man could be elected to the Men's Council,
who had not attained at least junior standing in the University. Of
course, the advantage of this idea is quite evident. In order to hold
a position on the council, a man should have mature judgment and
should be thoroughly in touch with University affairs.
The students will do well to adopt this amendment, if they desire to
keep the Men's Council in the place where it should be.
