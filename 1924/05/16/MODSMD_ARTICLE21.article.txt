# Sorority Bidding
## 
### 
"The glimmer of that glamour will be no more"—next Monday. After
a week of gay parties, of nerve-racking effort, life will settle back to
normal once more, and the rushing season of 1924 will pass into history.
On Monday morning, some seventy-five to one hundred women will
go down to Quad as the pledged members of various sororities. From
that day forth, either as students or alumnae of Stanford, they will be
classified according to the choice they have made.
Joining a sorority is not a decision which affects a few months, or a
few years. It is final, and her group is one of the most determining
factors in the life of a college woman. Her sorority is her college
family, with which she will be ultimately associated for the coming
three years.
It is said that houses run to a "type." There is undeniable truth in this
statement, though it applies to fundamentals rather than to mere ex
ternals. It is logical that a group of girls, who live together, work and
play together, should subscribe to somewhat the same ideas, should have
many of the same interests.
Jhe big question, therefore, is: Am I joining the group of which
I will be proud to be a member all my life? Am I in sympathy with their
ideals? Do I feel as they do toward University life in general, as, for
example, toward school and social activities? In other words, Am I their
type?
The majority of women who will join houses have been on the
campus since October. They have had the opportunity to become
acquainted with the Row women, know the standing and attitude of
the various houses.
But it is hard to judge people coolly under the conditions of rushing.
It is very pleasant to be the center of attraction, to be prettily fussed
over, to be "dated up" far ahead, to be made to feel that one's slightest
preference is of the gravest importance. Rushing is a> happy time for
those being rushed, to be enjoyed to the full.
But play time is nearly over and decision time is close. For the good
of Stanford, that larger group of which every woman is a part before
she is a member of a Greek letter society, every freshman should choose
carefully and sanely.
