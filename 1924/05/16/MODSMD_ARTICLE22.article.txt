# Elections

Did you ever consider how strange it is that some people never are
actively concerned in the life of the community in which they are part?
Selfish things they are! Unconcerned in the affairs of the community
that gives them of itself, from its bread to its hymns; supplies environ
ment for their children and their children's children; too little concerned
to drop a slip of paper in a ballot box to name the candidates they think
are best adapted to fill its offices. And still we wonder why every nation
must pass through a period when its ash barrels arc emptied and sack

cloth doubles in price, while its inhabitants go about the streets in
mourning!
It should alarm the nation when the finest products of its human
endeavors—the college students who should have the very highest sense
of civic responsibility—fail to vote in elections. You say we are looking
at a molehill, here in an obscure corner of the academic world, and are
endeavoring to imagine it into a mountain! No, we are looking at your
ballot box; of your ballot box of tomorrow. You, sir. present democracy
as the giant mountain which groaned and labored in great travail and
brought forth a mouse. We have looked squarely at your election
registers. The voters are not interested and facts declare it! Yesterday
only one-half of the student body voted in their elections and we under
stand that one-third of the voters in Pennsylvania voted in their recent
election. Can you see the analogy ?
This gives us a problem which is well worth thinking about. If
college men and women will not vote, sharply putting it, will not take
an interest in community affairs, neither feeling the compulsion of
religious or patriotic obligations, who in the name of common sense do
you expect to run governmental affairs out in the real he-man world ?
Must democracy always be an oligarchy of a few self-seeking politicians?
And how, pray, will democracy inherit a progressive life? Who will
divide social, political, economic privileges equitably? Who will practice
your so-called universal fraternalism ? What does that liberty, you yell
to the free winds far, really mean to you? Would you know it if you
say it, And who, again, pray, do you expect to practice it ?
]f you believe in democracy, then live it! Forget to talk about it.
Talk's beginning to make all of us sick. What we want is action and not
words; life and not precepts. We want to see faith and works equally
yoked together.
Believe that your insignificant vote and voice does count as a positive
unit in .the forces marching forward in the great cause of civic and
national righteousness. Master your idealism!— University of Washing
