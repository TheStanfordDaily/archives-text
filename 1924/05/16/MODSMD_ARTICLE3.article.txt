# Greeks Keep to Road During Rushing Week For Row's Sororities
## 
### 
Hungry Greeks, proceeding up the
row at noonday, find that they have
to stick to the roadway this week,
forced off the sidewalk by the large
influx of sorority rusheea who are
making their annual raid on the
houses.
The male greeks on the row are now
deriving as much gentle merriment
from watching the flimsy, flamboyant,
and flagrant attempt of the sorority
girls to enmesh victims, as the soror
ity women on the row got from ob
ealuminous efforts of the fraternities
in their recent rushing season.
The day of bidding is Sunday, May
18. The concensus of opinion on the
row is that after several of the
houses are going to be in a position
after Sunday to apply for a local char
ter of the Bag Holders.
