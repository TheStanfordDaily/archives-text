# PINKSTON RETAINS TITLE IN NATIONAL HIGH DIVE CONTEST
## Al White Loses to Champion By Small Margin; Dave Fall Takes Third 
### J. L. Adams 
Clarence Pinkston, representing the
Olympic Club, retained his title in the
A. A. U. high diving championships,
Sunday afternoon, at Searsville lake,
beating out A1 White by the scant
margin of 1% points. Third place went
to Dave Fall. Carl Stevenson of Stan
ford took first place in the national
junior mile swim and Charles Pung of
Hawaiia won the half-mile.
Pinkston Wins Diving Honors
White and Pinkston furnished a
splendid duel for diving honors. Both
executed their dives with machine
like precision. One judge awarded
White a majority of points but the
other two favored Pinkston. Fall came
through with some clever plunging,
taking third from three other much
more experienced performers.
The mile swim furnished a thrill to
the 3500 spectators assembled on the
banks of the lake. At the start it was
clear that Stevenson and Leo Purcell,
of the Olympic Club, would be pad
dling together for the lead throughout
the race. After swimming stroke and
stroke for eight laps, Stevenson, on
the next to the last lap, gradually
pulled a few feet ahead, beating Pur
cell by scarcely two yards. Bob Wil
liams, Brandsten's other entry, pulled
in third. ,
Pung Takes First in Half-Mile
Charles Pung outclassed his oppon
ents in the national half-mile, although
Mooney, Santa Clara University swim
mer, pressed him some of the distance.
Allen of Stanford grabbed third place.
Pung swam in 12 minutes and 18 sec- j
onds.
