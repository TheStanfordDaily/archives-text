# THIRTY-TWO SIGN UP FOR PLAY IN LINKS TOURNEY TOMORROW
## 
### 
Thirty-two players signed up to
compete for the trophy for the win
ner of the University open golf tourna
ment which will start on the Menlo
links tomorrow afternoon. Contestants
may start the qualifying round at any
time which suits their convenience but
should register with Reg Hirschman
before driving off.
Using the scores shot in the quali
fying round as a basis, the players
will be divided into flights of sixteen
for match play. The number of flights
will depend on the size of the entry
list. Match play will start Wednesday
and will continue on Thursday and
Friday. As the Menlo course consists
of but nine holes, two rounds must
be made to qualify.
Second Tourney This Year
This will be the second open tourna
ment of the college year, the first
having been played last October on
the Burlingame links. Fritz Ditiler
emerged the victor at that time, down
ing Lloyd Byerly 4 and 3. Byerly has
improved considerably since that time
and is expected to make Ditzler ex
tend himself to retain his honors.
Among the other golfers likely to be
included in the championship flight
are Lang, Klauber, McLean, Hirsch
man, Chase, Leiter, Dorsey, Clark, Mc-
Innes, Peterson, and Leiter.
