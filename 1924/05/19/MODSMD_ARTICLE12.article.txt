# World's Record Is Broken as Women Are Rushed up Row
## 
### 
Five hundred gallons of gasoline,
two Ltinels of cylinder oil, and $200
worth of rubber was used when 300
automobiles of various makes and
colors escorted freshman women to
their respective future domiciles Sun
day morning.
The best time made was by a big
blue racer, which covered the Lasuen
speedway in 7 seconds. Outside of the
fact that a few fenders were smashed,
no serious injuries were reported, but
plans are being made to use airplanes
for the next rushing season.
