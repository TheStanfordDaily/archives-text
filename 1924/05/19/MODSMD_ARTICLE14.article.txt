# BEACH OF WAIKIKI IS MOVED TO CAMPUS
## 
### 
The mellow moon, a steel guitar,
and a Hawaiian song!
Now all that is lacking is a medley
of Hawaiian voices, and the "islands"
themselves.
But iast Saturday night even the
voices were in evidence on the cam
pus when the visiting swimmers de
cided to show up the native sere
naders, and went around the campus
with instruments and voices in readi
ness.
Campus serenaders had better guard
their fame leÂ§t these visitors make
audiences too critical.
