# 1925 QUAD EDITOR TELLS PURPOSE OF AMENDMENT
## 
### Byron Williams 
At tomorrow's election the student
body will vote on the Quad amend
ment, along with two others. The
Quad amendment, believed by Don
McKay, editor of the 192C> Quad, to
be essential to the publication of bet
ter year books in the future. It pro
poses to do three things: (1) To al
low one solid year in which the edi
tor and manager may formulate their
plans; (2) to eliminate politics in the
matter of choosing the editor and i
manager; and (3) to take the super-!
vision away from the Junior class,
a temporary organization, and put it
into the hands of the Student Body. J
a more permanent and continuous or
ganization.
Managers Frame Amendment
The amendment was drawn up by
the present management of the Quad,
and it is the outgrowth of a plan sug
gested by Carl Shoup and Charles
White, editor and manager, respect
ively, of last year's Quad. It has been

aproved by the Quad Board of Con
trol and by the Executive Committee.
Contrary to many expressed opin
ions, the Class or 1926' will supply the
manager and editor for next year's
Quad, these being elected by the pres
ent Sophomore class, as in the past,
says McKay. If the amendment passes,
a second editor and manager will be
1 chosen by the new Quad Board of
! Control, and these two men will func
tion in their senior year.
Sophomore Tryoutees
Members of the class of 1927 de
! siring to try out for editor and mana
ger will do so in their Sophomore
j year. These tryoutees, instead of be
ing voted on by the class, will put
before the Quad Board of Control the
| one believed by the board to be the
most capable, as shown by his try
outee record, will become the editor.
The same applies in the case of the
manager. If the board fails of unani
mity in making the selection, the
editor and manager will be elected
