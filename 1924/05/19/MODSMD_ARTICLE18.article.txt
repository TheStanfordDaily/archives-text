# An Indictment!
## 
### 
The events which took place on the Row yesterday morning were a
double indictment—first against the pledging system and second against
the men of the University.
These occurrences do not need to be related here. They are common
talk about the campus already. There only needs to I>e a comment or two
in order to give the students an idea as to how the whole affair must have
looked to an outsider.
As to the first indictment—against the system. The setting for such
events was perfect. The front porch of every sorority house was crowded
with women waiting for the pledgees. As the freshmen women stated
their preferences to the lawyer in the Women's Clubhouse, they were com
pelled to go up the Row immediately to their sorority houses. They could
not return to Roble. Naturally, as the women appeared before the lawyer
at different times, most of them were forced to walk up the Row alone.
In other words, the men, who were waiting at the Post Office in ma
chines, were practically dared 1 to "get in on the fun." They did. They
followed the hapless women to the houses where they were to go, subject
ing them to all manner of indignities. Machines tore up and down the
Row with cut outs open and horns and whistles blowing until the place
was a veritable bedlam.
Had the men stopped here, the whole affair would have been bad
enough. However, they chose to carry everything to extremes. By pan
tomime and other means, they hurled insults at some sororities which they
did not consider so lucky as others.
It would indeed be hard to think that such acts arose out of deliberate
vandalism. leh Daily Palo Alto prefers to think that it was thoughtless
ness. Whatever the cause was, however, the results were equally disgust
ing. The Daily does not believe, that, on the whole, Stanford men lack
respect for Stanford women. Why, then, cannot we use some good com
mon "horse sense" in such matters and escape the sort of tilings that took
place yesterday.
One of the most disgraceful individual episodes of the morning was
centered aronud a middle-aged woman who started up the Row, evidently
to visit at some sorority or private home. The minute the visitor stepped
off the sidewalk by the Post Office and started up the Row, the parade
formed. She was treated exactly as the pledgees had been treated or rather
mis-treated. Being a stranger, she knew nothing of the cause of the dem
onstration and hung her head in shame.
• The Daily wonders if that sort of thing is the forerunner of a new
"Stanford Spirit."
In closing this comment, the Daily Palo Alto wishes to ask a few
questions of anyone who can answer them. 1. Why is it necessary to pre
serve a rushing and pledging system which subjects the women of the
University to such indignities? 2. Do the women, as a whole, approve of
such a system? 3. If not, why do they tolerate it? 4. If so, why? 5.
Why must the men of the University do their utmost to prove that they
are not genlemen, when, on the whole, they are a good sort?
