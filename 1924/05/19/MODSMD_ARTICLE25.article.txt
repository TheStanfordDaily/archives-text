# APPOINTMENT OFFICE LOAN LIBRARY ASKS STUDENT ASSISTANCE
## 
### 
The Appointment Office, through the
secretary, Mrs. E. B. Snell, for the
last three years has been conducting
a loan library, from which students
may borrow books.
This fact has been generally over
looked of late, says Mrs. Snell, who
desires that students make fuller use
of the library, as well as co-operate in
supplying the office with used text
books.
She requests that fraternities or
other organizations see to it that all
text books in reasonable condition,
that are lying around useless, be gath
ered up and sent to the appointment
office.
