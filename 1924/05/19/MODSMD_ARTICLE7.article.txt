fTPSETS in the sprints and in the 1500 meter run cost Stanford first place
in the P. A. A. track and field meet Saturday afternoon.
The Olympic Club came first with 55 points and Stanford second with 49%
points. The other teams scoring points were: California varsity, 22; Un
attached ("Brick" Muller), 13; Hawaiian Islands, 5%; Sacramento Athletic
Club, 5; California freshmen, 5; Italia Virtus, 3; Humboldt Club, 1.
Stanford's bad luck came early in the meet. In the 1500 meter run Bill
Kerr was leading at the start of the last lap, but tripped as he took the pole
on the turn, and fell, putting him out of the running. Lockhart, of the
Sacramento Athletic Club, beat out A1 Smith for first, covering the distance
in the fast time of 4:01 8-10, which ties the Olympic Games record, which is
held by A. G. Hill of England.
Sudden Wins Century
In both of the sprints the Cards were only able to take second and third
places. Eddie Sudden of the Olympic Club showed that he has not forgotten
how to run the 100 meters by beating Hale, Campbell, and Barber, who
finished in the order named. His time was 11 flat. Hale got off to a poor
start but came up to within a few inches of Sudden at the finish.
The other upset was in the 200 meter run when Jim Barber nosed out Camp
bell and Gaspar. Neither Hale nor Sudden ran in this event. The time was
22 2-10. "Racehorse" Cochran and Ted Miller staged the feature race of the
day in the meters. Cochran had the pole and took the lead from the start,
but he was closely pressed by the Stanford quarter miler the entire distance.
The "Racehorse," who twice won at the N. C. A. A., was forced to set a new
Olympic Games record to win, his time being 48 7-10. The record for this
distance is 49 3-5. Captain Judah pulled into third place on the home stretch.
Bill Richardson again demonstrated his superiority in the SOO meter run,

•"when he beat Dick Mcintosh and
Elmer Boyden. He was clocked at
1:54 3-10. Boyden showed that he was
in good condition by keeping up with
the Stanford stars throughout the
race. He was only two feet behind Mc
intosh at the finish. Swayne, of Stan
ford, was fourth.
The closest race was between
"Swede" Leistner and Krogness in
the 110 meter hurdle finals. The
"Swede" kept his lead by inches and
was barely ahead at the finish. Krog-
