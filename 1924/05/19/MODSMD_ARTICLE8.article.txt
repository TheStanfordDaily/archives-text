## 
### 
Junior water poloists emerged vic
torious in their lnterci&ss game with
the freshmen Friday at an exhibition
swimming meet in Encina pool, when
they tossed in three goals and turned
the frosh back scoreless. Two tank
records, one in the 100-yard breast
stroke, the other in the back-stroke
for the same distance, were hung up
by the Hawaiians in exhibition races.
With a team which has been play
ing together all season, the freshmen
were expected to defeat the juniors,
but the upperclassmen proved to be
too aggressive for them.
Kirschbaum swam the 100-yeard
breast-stroke in 1:13, which is new
time for this event in the Encina pool.
In the 100-yard back-stroke Harris es
tablished a new Encina record of
1:08 1-5.
Hawaiians Win Relay
The Hawaiians turned in slow times
in the 100-yard and 220-yard free style
but were fast enough to leave a large
gap between themselves and the var
sity and frosh relay teams in an ex
hibition race.
In the second game of the interclass
series the sophomores met defeat at
the hands of the seniors with a score
of 7 to 0. It was a turmoil from start
to finish with many near-drownings.
