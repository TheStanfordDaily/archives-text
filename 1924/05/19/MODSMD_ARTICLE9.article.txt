phasizing especially the importance of
those rules relating to the scholarship
requirements imposed upon entrants
to the universities. It provides that no
person shall be eligible to participate
as a member of any team engaged in
intercollegiate sport unless, prior to

such university where it is the intent
or expectation that such person or

sum greater than fifty ($5O) dollars
as such renumeration.
4. Provides for the constitution of
an Eligibility Board, consisting of the
Presidents of the three institutions
with the Recorders or Registrars as
non-voting advisory members. This
board is empowered to consider any j
alleged violations of the rules of the
P. C. I. A. C., or the present agree- j
i

ment, and to impose punishment by
disqualification.
It has been felt toy the athletic au
thorities of the three institutions that
the natural competition for the high
school athletes of the state makes it
important to be scrupulously careful
to maintain the highest possible stand
ards of sportsmanship, and to make
clear to the public their determination
to preserve proper academic standards
for intercollegiate sport.
