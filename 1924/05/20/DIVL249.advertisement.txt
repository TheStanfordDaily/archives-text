T7AR more strongly than most churches, this great tower of com
merce bespeaks the real spirit of Gothic architecture —aspiring,
rugged, virile—an inspiration for the thinking, creating architect of
today. Contradicting the antiquarian, this great tower declares that
the spirit of Gothic architecture is a living, organic thing, adaptable
to modern problems of accommodation and engineering, and en
dowed with a future as magnificent as its past.
Certainly modern invention —modern engineering skill and organ
ization, will prove more than equal to the demands of the atchitec
ture of the future.
