# Hammer and Coffin Society Was Originated Before Earthquake
## 
### Stephen O'Donnell 
Hammer and Coffin Society, founded
at Menlo Park just seven hours before
the great earthquake in 1906, was con
ceived by a group of Stanford men
who were then the staff of the Chap
arral. The organization was expanded
of recent years until there are now six
chapters, the latest members being
the California Pelican, whose staff was
initiated at a banquet in San Francisco
on May 11.
The original purpose of the society
was to give to the university humor
ists the advantages of a fraternal or
ganization, binding them more closely
together to promote the "espirit de
corps" of the staff. Since that time
there has been another principle for
which the name of Hammer and Cof
fin has stood. This has been the idea
of getting a cleaner brand of humor
into college comics.
The first step toward expansion
taken by the society was the annexa
tion of the Washington Sun Dodger
in 1919. This was followed in 1921 by
the addition of the Oregon Lemon

»Punch and one year later the O. A. C.
Orange Owl. The first eastern publica
tion to be taken over was the Chicago
Phoenix in 1923.
As each of these publications has
joined Hammer and Coffin they have
been required to take the pledge to
attempt to keep objectionable matter
from being published.
Since it has come to embrace a
number of widely scattered comic
publications, the society has held con
ventions annually.
Ely Is National President
At the last of these, Mike Ely, edi
tor of the Chaparral, was elected Na
tional President. In this capacity Ely
has been invited recently to represent
Hammer and Coffin at the convention
of the National College Comic Asso
ciation, in which there are five other
organizations of a similar nature.
Last year the local chapter, editing
Chaparral, won the the Judge's Col
lege Wits Contest, placing "Chappie"
on a par with the first ranking comics
of the country. Mike Ely took the in
dividual prize in the same contest.
