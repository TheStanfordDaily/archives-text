# NEW PRESIDENT OF A.S.S.U. IS UNDETERMINED
## Amendments Passed by Large Margins; McCallister Is Yell-Leader 
### 
At five o'clock this afternoon, the
race for student body president had
not been decided. According to an
early announcement which was sup
posed to be complete, George Baker
was the winner by one vote. Through
an oversight, however, on the part of
the election committee, one group of
counters had not reported and latest
totals indicated that Beardsley led by
nine votes. A recount is in progress
and final results will be available to
morrow.
Other offices which the change
might effect were places on the Men's
Council and 1925 Woman Representa
tive on the Executive Committee.
All three amendments carried by
large majorities, the third one en
countering the most opposition.
Returns at 5 o'clock, which are sub
ject to change, are as follows:
