# STEEPLECHASE WILL BE MOST CONTESTED HORSE SHOW EVENT
## 
### 
Probably the most hotly contested
event of the fourth anual R. O. T. C.
Horse Show which will be held May
31 on the Encina Solo Field will be
the mile and an eighth steeplechase.
A course has been laid around the
field that has thirteen difficult jumps,
and incidentally these thirteen include
every type of jump known. The one
which will offer the contestants the
most difficulty is a 15-foot water jump
that has been placed on one of the
turns.
Two other difficult events that will
attract a great deal of attention are
the Cossack and Roman races. The
riders are practicing daily for these
contests. Entries are expected in these,
as well as many of the other events,
from men not registered in the R. O.
T. C. This is the first time in the four
years of its existence that the show
has allowed outsiders to enter.
