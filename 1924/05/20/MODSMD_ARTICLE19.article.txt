# A 						Chance for Improvement

### 
The Daily Palo Alto is in the hands of the students later today than
it has been at any time this year. The results of the Quad election which
on the front page caused the delay. Under ordinary circum
stances, waiting 1 for election returns results in some delay but never
before have the students had to wait so long for the news in which they
are so vitally interested.
Unfortunately, there is no very valid reason for the trouble. Vote
counting was not started until the polls closed at 2 o'clock. Because of
the large ballot and heavy vote, the time required for counting was
greater than usual. In practically all past elections, vote tallying began
soon after 12 o'clock and the results were kept up to the minute so that
when the polls closed it was a simple matter to get the final outcome.
It seems that, in the last election, some students objected to the votes
being counted before the polls closed 011 the ground that partial results
gave campaign managers their cues to get out and rustle more voters.
This is a bad situation if it is true, but the Daily doubts if there is any
very great danger of such tactics.
Under the present system, however, it must be admitted that such a
thing could happen. Any student in the University is privileged to be
in the room where the votes are being counted. There is 110 reason for
that ruling. In elections for United States legislators, executives, and
judicial officials, no one save those who are paid to do the work are
allowed in the room where the results are tabulated.
The students of the University would do well to adopt an amendment
to the constitution under which no one except those appointed should be
allowed in the room where the ballots are being counted. If such an
amendment were passed, a larger election committee could be appointed.
The people on this committee would be officially responsible for counting
the votes and would not be bothered while working.
With the present ruling in effect, the election committee is not large
enough to take care of the counting and outside help has to be'called in.
In every election in the past four years, members of the Daily Palo Alto
staff have been largely responsible for vote counting.
The Daily then, suggests that an amendment such as the one men
tioned alx)ve, be passed next year, and that the election committee be
enlarged to such an extent that it will be able to take care of the duties
which rightfully belong to it. All this is suggested in order that the
students may know election results sooner and that the system of voting
and counting be removed entirely from any danger of questionable
methods.

This is a bad situation if it is true, but the Daily doubts if there is any
very great danger of such tactics.
Under the present system, however, it must be admitted that such a
thing could happen. Any student in the University is privileged to be
in the room where the votes are being counted. There is 110 reason for
that ruling. In elections for United States legislators, executives, and
judicial officials, no one save those who are paid to do the work are
allowed in the room where the results are tabulated.
The students of the University would do well to adopt an amendment
to the constitution under which no one except those appointed should be
allowed in the room where the ballots are being counted. If such an
amendment were passed, a larger election committee could be appointed.
The people on this committee would be officially responsible for counting
the votes and would not be bothered while working.
With the present ruling in effect, the election committee is not large
enough to take care of the counting and outside help has to be'called in.
In every election in the past four years, members of the Daily Palo Alto
staff have been largely responsible for vote counting.
The Daily then, suggests that an amendment such as the one men
tioned alx)ve, be passed next year, and that the election committee be
enlarged to such an extent that it will be able to take care of the duties
which rightfully belong to it. All this is suggested in order that the
students may know election results sooner and that the system of voting
and counting be removed entirely from any danger of questionable
methods.
The Daily Palo Alto is in the hands of the students later today than
it has been at any time this year. The results of the Quad election which
on the front page caused the delay. Under ordinary circum
stances, waiting 1 for election returns results in some delay but never
before have the students had to wait so long for the news in which they
are so vitally interested.
Unfortunately, there is no very valid reason for the trouble. Vote
counting was not started until the polls closed at 2 o'clock. Because of
the large ballot and heavy vote, the time required for counting was
greater than usual. In practically all past elections, vote tallying began
soon after 12 o'clock and the results were kept up to the minute so that
when the polls closed it was a simple matter to get the final outcome.
It seems that, in the last election, some students objected to the votes
being counted before the polls closed 011 the ground that partial results
gave campaign managers their cues to get out and rustle more voters.
