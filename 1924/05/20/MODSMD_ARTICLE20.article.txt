The athlctic agreement which has just been completed between Stan
ford, the University of California, and the University of Southern
California meets a need long felt in the leading universities of the State
of California.
"KJie purpose of the agreements is to "apply uniform standards to the
eligibility of the athletes in the three institutions, and to safeguard each
institution from any accusations that its standards are lowered for
desirable high school athletes." The rules which will govern the enforce
ment of the pact have already appeared in the Daily Palo Alto and it is
easy to see the benefits which should result.
Three great universities such as those which entered into the agree
ment should have a great deal in common. They should be working in
perfect harmony at all times instead of looking at each other in a
suspicious manner. Unfortunately, in the case of at least one of the
institutions, suspicions have been well-founded in the past. It is to be
hoped that the agreement will be observed to the letter.
The greatest benefit which can accrue to the parties in the agreement
will be the attitude which the public must adopt toward them if the pact
is enforced. People will realize that academic standards are not to be
neglected in the case of athletes any more than in the case of any other
students.
