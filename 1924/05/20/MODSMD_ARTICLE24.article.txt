# SPORTS OF 1924
## Lots of Experience Here 
### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
No one can accuse the Olympic Committee of a. lack of good judgment in
selecting Lawson Robertson as head track coach of the American team.
First of all "Robhy" was a famous athlete himself; secondly, he has been a
most successful coach at the University of Pennsylvania; and thirdly, he has
been to all but two of the modern Olympiads, either as competitor or coach,
so he certainly has had the necessary experience.
As an athlete Robertson was best noted as a sprinter, winning the national
championship in the 100 yards in 1904 and the indoor championship at 300
yards in 1906, '07, and '08. He placed in the standing jumps at the 1904 and
1906 Olympic games, and once won the Canadian 100-yard championships in
the fine time of 9 4-5 seconds.
As a coach, his record speaks for itself, for besides turning out the great
Ted Meredith and the almost equally great Eby, he has developed track and
field stars too numerous to mention, and his teams have won more than their
share of the Intercollegiate association meets.
Besides all of these qualifications, Robby is the possessor of a fine bass
voice which did much in 1920 to entertain the natives of war-torn Belgium.
