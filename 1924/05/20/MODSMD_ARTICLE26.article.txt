How a High Jumper Was Developed
Fourteen years ago, five days, and
six seconds flat, Frederick Leroy An
derson was knee high to a grasshop
per's petticoat. He wore red pants
without golf stockings and generally
conducted himself as would any young
ster of his age, and bore little promise
of becoming an athlete.
Now, it happened that Ma Anderson
was an adept in the pastime of pre
paring preserves, especially jams,
while the youngster was just as expert
in diminishing the supply. As a con
sequence, Mrs. Anderson always kept
the choicest jars on the uppermost
zenth of the highest shelf of the tallest
pantry, hoping against the day when
Freddie should eventually be able to
reach the same.
On April 2, 1910, Freddie conceived
the ambition of reaching those jams
before the natural run of events. Lad
ders and other impedimenta were not
available, so the only method left for
him was his own personal physical
prowess. And thus it was that he prac
ticed leaping, every chance, every
day ,and in every way.
Gradually, his legs extended. Slowly,
yet surely, his ability increased. His
first efforts were pitful. At times his
progress was painful when he fell on
tender parts of his anatomy. But, three
years later, Freddie could reach the
shelf. Six months later, Mrs. Anderson
gave up. Ten years later, Frederick
Leroy Anderson was on the sporting
page.

A collection of insects purchased in
Ceylon, India, and containing four or
five hundred specimens, was presented
to the Zoology department of the Uni
versity of Washington recently. Among
the collection is a millipede six inches
long.
