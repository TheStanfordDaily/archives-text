# LABOR DAY TRADITION ESTABLISHED IN 1920
## 
### Don Hines 
Labor Day as a tradition started in
1920, five years ago. It developed out
of the old plan whereby eight sopho
mores went to the Home each Satur
day to work. As the amount of work
on the grounds increased, the sopho
mores were unable to handle all of it,
and in 1920 it was decided to set aside
one day each year when the students
would turn out en masse to work at
the Home.
Each year more than a thousand
students have assisted in clearing the
grounds of weeds and rubbish. Last
year recorded the largest turnout in
history, almost 1200.
Festivities on Labor Day
Labor Day is made somewhat cf a
gala occasion as well as an oppor
tunity to chum with a hoe for a little
while. The University declares a half
holiday, the band is usually on hand
to enliven the proceedings, and the
best campus talent puts on an enter
tainment.
Sam McDonald has officiated at the
barbecue pits every year, and those
who have once tasted his mutton do
not need to be warned that no meals
will be served at any living groups
that evening.
Women Aid With Work
The activities of Labor Day are not
confined to the men. Armed with
shears and gloves, the women invade
Mrs. Stanford's rose garden to set
things in order. About 5 o'clock they
turn their attention to preparing the
feast for consumption.
And then the dance. After the con
clusion of the entertainment, canvas
is spread over the lawn and the music
is struck up. The rough need not fear
to attend, for every dance is a tag.
