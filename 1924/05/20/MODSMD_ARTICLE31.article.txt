HARRY MALONEY
"From Dublin, Ireland, to Stanford
University, California, with stop-overs
at South Africa, Pasadena, California,
and way points."
That is the way Harry W. Maloney,
director of Stanford's minor sports,
might have bought a ticket many
years ago when he left the Emerald
Isle as ail officer in the cavalry and
headed for the Boer War. As it was,
his tickets were bought sporadically;
and, moreover, not from free-will.
Born in Dublin
Maloney was born in Dublin and
attended public schools in Ireland and
England at various stages in his boy
hood. Leaving grammar school, he en
tered the Army School of Physical
Education at Curragh, Ireland â€”gradu-
ating two years later to become direc
tor of the British Amy Cavalry School,
also at Curragh. Here he obtained his
first experience as an athletic direc
tor, having charge of all sports rang
ing from gymnastic games to rugby.
As a scout in the Boer War from
1899 to 1902, Maloney modestly de
scribes his work as being "tedious,"
merely having to "pierce the enemy
lines and obtain information about
arms, supplies, horses, men, and
plans." It was at this point, however,
that Fate determined that Maloney's
brogue was to become Americanized.
Came to California
He was taken down with fever, and,
having a brother in California, turned
to Pasadena for a chance to recuperate.
Completely recovered, he opened a
private gymnasium in Pasadena for
medical and corrective gymnastics
which he conducted from 1904 to 1908.
In 1908, Maloney came north to
Stanford as Instructor in Physical
Training, a position which he has held
ever since with the exception of sev
eral years spent in the United States
army in this country and Europe. He
has coached nearly every sport in
dulged in by Cardinal athletes and in
the past few years has built up the
department of minor sports to be one
of the strongest in the country.
Continued Athletics in France
Even when he left Stanford in 1918
and was attached to the personal staff
of General Helmick in France, he con
tinued his athletic work. After the
armistice he was made athletic direc
tor and director of entertainment at
Camp Pontonazen near Brest, France,
doing such creditable work that he
was personally congratulated by Gen
eral Pershing.
During the Allied Games following
the armistice, he was ordered by
Headquarters to take charge of the
United States team and served as
coach and trainer of the track, field,
and rugby teams in the summer of
1919.

Co-eds ruled supreme at Northwest
ern for two weeks. During that time
no man was allowed to ask for a date,
while the women of the university did
all the dating and paid the bills. If a
man refused a girl a date, he had to
give her a pound box of chocolates.
