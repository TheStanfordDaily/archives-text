### 
"A History of the British People,"
by Edward Maslln Hulme, associate
I professor of history at Stanford, is the
! title of a new book which has just
I been published by the Century Coin
! pany of New York.
! The book is essentially a history of
; the British people, focusing greater at
; tention upon their economic and terri
j torial development and the growth of
the forces of democracy, than upon
politics and war. It is intended to be
j used as a textbook, although the book
I is expected to have a wide appeal to
all students of historical development.
Book Praised
The Century company says the fol
lowing of Professor Hulme's work:
' " 'A History of the British People' is
; a new history of its subject, not mere
ly another one. It deals with the Eng
| lish, Scottish, Welsh, and Irish peo
| pies in a manner that gives the book
a distinctive position. The central
position is naturally given to the
greatest of these peoples, but the
others are not neglected.
"A considerable background is given
of the history of the Continent. Such
subjects as the Church, Feudalism,
| the Crusades, the Renaissance, the
! Growth of Democracy, and the Great
I War, are treated fully in their Euro
i pean setting. Somewhat more than
usual attention is also paid the over
seas expansion of the British people.
; Military matters have been rather
j severely compressed so as to give
j more space to the development of
thought anil the evolution of economic
and social conditions.
"There are excellent chapters on
the Agricultural Revolution and the
Industrial Revolution, and the con
tinuing effect of these great changes
is traced to the recent accession to
power of the Labor Party.
Literature Discussed
"Far more than the ordinary amount
of space is devoted to literature, to
the unfolding of the life of the peoples
of the islands as revealed in their
writing. The literary style is surpris
ingly fluent and free, with a wide vo
cabulary given to striking phrases. It
is especially successful in descriptive
narrative and in character sketches;
it makes personalities like Canute,
Anselm, William the Conqueror, Mary
Elizabeth, Cromwell, Disraeli,
and Gladstone stand out in color."
