# KAPPA SIGMA AND SEQUOIA FIRST WIN INTRAMURAL ITS
## El Cuadro, El Tigre Teams Forced from Race for Baseball Honors 
### 
Kappa Sigma shut out El Cuadro
6 to 0, and Sequoia First scored a 7
to 1 victory over El Tigre in the first
games of the semi-finals of the intra
mural baseball championship yester
day.
Kappa Sigma outplayed El Cuadro
in every department, and ragged play
ing on the part of the clubmen's in
field was responsible for some of
Kappa Sig's tallies. After the fourth
inning El Cuadro's, nine settled down
and held Kappa Sigma scoreless for
the remainder of the contest.
In the first inning, Robison, pitch
ing for El Cuadro, walked Newkirk.
A triple by Deffebach scored him from
second. Deffebach tallied on an over
throw at first. Another score was made
in the second on an error and a two
base hit. Two more runners crossed
the plate in the third.
Shipkey Knocks Homer
Kappa Sig's final marker came in
the fourth, when Ted Shipkey knocked
out a home run. The ball hit the
ground, but before the El Cuadro
fielder could reach it, it bounced over
the fence.
Kappa Sigma made four hits, three
of which were for extra bases. Moore,
Kappa Sig chucker, allowed El Cuadro
only two hits. El Cuadro made ten
errors, while Kappa Sigma made four.
Chedister's pitching enabled Se
quoia First to walk away with an
easy victory over El Tigre. He allowed
but three scattered hits and fanned
eleven men. Newton, of El Tigre, also
hurled a creditable game, letting his
opponents down with six bingles, but
received no support worthy of the
name.
Prior, of Sequoia, connected for a
homer in the first inning with none
on, but three of his teammates struck
out. The victors added three more in
the second and again in the fifth. New
ton saved El Tigre from a shutout in
the fifth when he singled, stole sec
ond, and came home on McKechnie's
double.
Brazil Knocked Unconscious
Brazil, Sequoia catcher, was knocked
out in the second frame when he col
lided with Stockbridge, El Tigre short
stop, as he was running from second
to third.
Playoffs for the intramural cham
pionship will be continued Wednes
day, when Sequoia First meets Theta
Xi and Kappa Sigma tangles with Phi
Sigma Kappa. The games will be
played on the varsity and freshman
diamonds at 4:15 p.m.
