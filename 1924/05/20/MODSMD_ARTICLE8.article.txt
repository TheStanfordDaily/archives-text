# FRENCH CLUB WILL GIVE ANNUAL PLAY FOR WAR ORPHANS
## 
### 
Following their annual custom of
giving an evening of one-act plays,
the French Club will stage "La Pearle
de la Canebiere," by Labiche, and two
short skits on the evening of June 4.
Since 1916, when the French Club
adopted two French war orphans, it
has given a similar production every
year to raise the necessary funds for
their support. The entire proceeds go
to the orphans, as there is practically
no expense in the production, pro
grams and other necessities being
donated.
Was Success in Paris
This year the production will excel
any previous efforts, both in the
quality of the drama and in the ability
and training of the cast. The principal
play, "La Pearl de la Canebiere," is a
popular and well written one-act piece
which was produced with great suc
cess at the Grand Guignol in Paris.
The two skits, one of them showing
the troubles of visitors at the Museum
de Louvre, and the other showing a
sidewalk cafe, are full of clever dia
logue and true French atmosphere.
While the cast has not yet been an
nounced, Hal Bumbaugh, who is also
taking the lead in the Senior Farce,
will direct the production, and Pro
fessor Smith of the Romanic Lan
guages department will supervise it.
