# TREES, STUMPS, WEEDS AND FUN AWAIT WORKERS
## Labor Day at Convalescent, Home to Begin at One O'Clock Tomorrow 
### 
One tree to be felled, several stumps j
to be grubbed out, 1,000,047 weeds to,
be hoed, and 18 sheep and 50 gallons j
of ice cream to be consumed await |
the mass attack on the Convalescent,
Home in the form of Labor Day to
morrow.
The remainder of the menu includes j
ten pans of baked beans, sixty gallons
of coffee from Encina dining hall, and |
200 sandwiches from each sorority, j
Sequoia Hall is furnishing paper plates |
and implements. Dr. Gardner has;
agreed to provide an ample supply of j
ginger cookies for the occasion.
Living Groups to Pay
Chairman "Chuck" Beardsley has |
sent a circular letter to fraternities j
requesting that, in view of the fact,
that no living goups are serving meals j
tomorrow night, each organization
contribute $6 to the barbecue. Beards- 1
ley asks that checks made payable to j
"Labor Day Committee" be mailed to
P. O. box 1096 as soon as possible, to
assist in the finances.
Work will start at one o'clock. Three
military trucks will be on hand to take
the women to the grounds. It is re-'
guested that those with cars co-oper- ;
ate by bringing women from Roble |
and the Row. Matters will be facili- j
tated if the women assemble in front
of their houses rather than in the
front room.
In addition to the trees and weeds !
to be cleaned out, a space for a play-,
ground is to be leveled. As the Â£h.e of,
the old lawn is now occupied by a j
new building, the dancing will take;
place on canvas spread on the newly
leveled playground. Snakes remember'
that the leveler the smoother.
