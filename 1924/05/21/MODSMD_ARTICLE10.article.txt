# NORM CLEAVELAND TELLS ABOUT EUROPEAN TRIP
## Stanford Athlete On American Rugby Team Writes of Reception in England 
### 
"Give 'Em the Axe," the "Sky
rocket," the "Son of a Gambolier,"
and other Stanford songs and yells
were given an enthusiastic reception
by members of the British peers and
nobility during the recent stay of the
American rugby team in Paris, accord
ing to Norman Cleaveland of Stanford,
in a letter to his mother, Mrs. Newton
D. Cleaveland.
"Norm" Cleaveland. who has been
one of the stars of the American
rugby team during the English and
Olympic Games contests, writes that
during the stay of the team in London
members of the highest British nobil
ity entertained the players, and the
Stanford men on the team had an op-

Dportunity to show some real Stanford
spirit 4000 miles from "the Farm'
with their American college yells and
songs.
Little or no organized cheering
exists among the students of British
universities, and the enthusiastic and
clever cheers of the Stanford men
created much interest in the British
capital.
Cleaveland writes from Paris as fol
lows:
"So many unusually interesting ex
periences have been happening so
continuously that I have had no time
to record them.
"Probably the most important wad
I our last game in England with the
Harlequins. As I have said in previous
letters, the Harlequins are considered
to be the best club in England, and
they all admitted that they put the
best team on the field against us that
they have had since the war.
Rogers Is Hurt
They were exceedingly clever and
we saw early in the game that we
would have to play our hardest. The
game was plenty rough, and many in
juries occurred. A Harlequin broke his
leg and "Lefty" Rogers shattered his
nose badly.
"That evening we were the guests
of the Harlequins and they put on a
most elaborate banquet # and proved
themselves to be the very best of
fellows.
"I have been elected yell leader for
the team and our 'Give 'Em the Axe,'
'Sky Rocket,' 'Osky Wow Wow,' and
Rah Rahs, got by tremendously.
"The next day was Sunday and we
were the guests of the British Empire
Exposition. It is not quite completed
yet, but has all the indications of a
fine display. I don't believe that it
quite equals the P. P. I. E., though.
One of the greatest disillusions that
I have had on my trip so far was the
Wembly Stadium. It is supposed to be
the largest in the world, and to be
capable of holding 125,000 people. It
holds the people all right, but if Stan
ford's stadium was mostly standing
room, it would no doubt hold 150,000.
Entertained by Nobility
"That night I hit the high water
mark of my social career. We had
dinner at the Picadilly hotel, as guests
of the British Olympic Association,
most of whom are Lords and generals.
There was more nobility present than
there was at the Peace Conference.
"Well, at the end of a most lavish
meal it was suggested that I lead some j
yells. We "sky-rocketed," and "osfty
wow wowed" to the extreme delight
of the nobility. All of the lords and
generals were given a skyrocket.
Cleaveland Sings
"We sang some college songs, and
even that did not satisfy the lords.
Finally, I sang at the compulsion of
the team, 'The Son of a Gambolier,' as
a solo, the rest of the gang joining in
on the chorus. This made a big hit,
and I was dragged out again to per
form, so I rendered 'The Cremation
of Sam McGee."
As the party was breaking up one
of the committee said he would like
to take me to his club. So I piled in

with him. I don't know what his title
was, but I know that there was a
General Kentish in the party. The
three of us visited various ultra-elite
clubs, and finally I was taken home.
Not so bad for a Stanford rough.
Team Has Rough Voyage
"Early the next morning we left for
France. The channel was very rough,
and the little boat just managed to
stay right side up. Quite a number of
the gang showed the effects and every
body was glad to reach Bologne. At
Bologne we were supposed to have
been met by the French Olympic Com
mittee, who were to get us into the
country without vises or passports.
However, they failed to show up and
we had a time landing. For a long
while it looked as if we were going to
be sent back to England, and it was
not until we got the American consul
in tow and went through yards and
yards of red tape that we were al
lowed into the country.
View Scars of War
"We caught a train at 6 a.m. for
Paris. In passing through Amiens we
had our first glimpse of some of the
scars of the war. At 6 p.m. we hit
Paris in a rainstorm. There were some
newspaper men at the station and they
informed us where our quarters were.
The American quarters are not ready
for occupancy yet, so we are staying
at this hotel, a pleasant one, on the
banks of the Seine."
Cleaveland further goes on to say
that the Stanford men on the team
who are in Paris for the first time are
making use of their opportunities by
taking in the Eiffel tower and all
other sights of the French metropolis.
Since this letter was written the
American ruggers have made a clean
sweep of their Olympic Games match
es. Sunday they played their last game
against the French team, whom they
defeated by a score of 17 to 3, thereby
winning the Olympic championships.
