## "Tiny" Hartranft Will Be Eligible; Second Team To Go To Oregon For Conference Contest 
### Wallace Knox 
By Wallace Knox

riIFTEEN of Stanford's best trackmen will board the Overland Limited,
Friday, headed for Boston, where they will represent the Cardinal in the
I. C. A. A. A. A. on May 30 and 31.
In addition to this team, a formidable aggregation will also be sent to
Eugene, Ore., to compete in the Pacific Coast Conference meet, which will
be held on May 31.
The final decree deciding the fate of the track team was issued last night
by the Board of Athletic Control. At a meeting earlier in the day, the
Stanford Faculty Athletic Committee was able to certify the unquestioned
eligibility o*l' "Tiny" Hartranlt and Captain Nelson Van Judah. On the
other hand, Bill Storie, who transferred from the San Jose Junior College,

Elmer Elliott, who has already j
j had three years of varsity competi-j
, tion, were declared ineligible.
Eligibility Settled
For some weeks the question of the
eligibility of several members of the
team has been undecided. When the i
j issue first arose the chairman of the 1
committee. Dr. W. H. Barrow sent i
! Paul Davis, the graduate manager, to j
| New York for first-hand information
1 from the I. C. A. A. A. A. authoities.
Davis presented the case in detail
before the executive committee in New
York, and since no official protest had
1 been made against the Stanford men,
no formal action could be taken by
the committee. An unofficial interpre-;
tation of the rules was obtained from j
the various members, and it was in
1 view of this interpretation that the'
! Stanford Faculty Athletic Committee 1
i decided to declare Hartranft, Judah,!
and Arthur eligible.
Must Be in Good Standing
The problem was as to whether or!
not these men were bona fide students ;
!of the University. The concensus of
! opinion was that they were, although ;
I they had not been in regular attend- j
I
| ance for the whole year. In other;
' words, a man who is disqualified is
still a student in good standing as'
! soon as he re-enters Stanford, as is
I also a man who has been absent, work
ing for a quarter, provided that he
meets the other requirements.
A party of seventeen men will jour
ney east. Besides the track men, Coach j
j "Dink" Templeton and Manager Orville
Tucker will go. The tracksters se
lected include Marshall Hale and lan
Campbell in the sprints; "Swede"
j Leistner in the hurdles; Ted Miller
| and Nelson Van Judah in the 440 yard
dash; Bill Richardson, Dick Macln
' tosh, and Bill Swayne in the half mile;
Bill Kerr and A1 Smith in the mile
and two mile runs; "Tiny" Hartranft
and Jim Arthur in the shot and dis
cus; Fred Anderson in the high jump;
Dick Mac√üae in the broad jump; and
Fred Ludeke in the hammer throw
! and hop, step, and jump.
Second Team Not Chosen
I The names of the men who will
make the northern trip have not been
determined. However, the selection
will be made from Louis Gaspar, Hal
Boles, Bill Storie, Charlie Daly, Norm
Dole, A1 Charles, Frank Hayes, Guy
Dennis, Phil Scofield, Lou Kemnitzer,
Bill Wright, Dick Richards, "Scotchy"
Campbell, and Evers.
Should Take Honos
Both of these teams are well round
ed and are sufficiently powerful to
take first honors at the meets in which
they will compete. The team at the
national meet probably has the edge
over the team going to Oregon be
cause of the number of sure point
getters upon it, but the second team
should garner enough seconds and
thirds to make it a dangerous con
tender for first place.
