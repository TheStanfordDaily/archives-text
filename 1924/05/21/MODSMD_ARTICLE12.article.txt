# LECTURER TELLS OF OLD GARDENS

If it had not been for their love of
j flowers and the great labor it entailed,
j the natives of Mexico would not have
been conquered by Cortez.
This was the statement made by
Mrs. Zelia Nuttall, special assistant in
Mexican Archaeology at the Peabody
Museum of Harvard University, in her
illustrated talk last night on "Aztec
and SpaniSli Colonial Gardens."

Natives Helped Cortez

Mrs. Nuttall explained that it was
through the help of the indignant
natives who had been forced to work
on the many pleasure gardens, that
Cortez was able to succeed.
"Two hundred years before the dis
covery of America. Montezuma's an
cestors developed that taste for luxury ,
which resulted in their fine work in!
jewels and planning of fine gardens," j
she said.
Flowers Predominant
"It was reported that. Montezuma
outdid all others in his passion for
rare plants. No vegetables and fruits
were planted by him. He displayed
good taste in placing his gardens on
high hills," she continued. Mrs. Nut
tall showed pictures of these gardens, i
! laying stress on the remarkable steps
| carved out of the stone.
She also showed illustrations of the
wonderful cypress trees planted in
1450, in the form of a double rectangle
covering an area of ten acres. "This
| rectangle," said Mrs. Nuttall, "is the
J oldest planted avenue of trees in cx
j istence."
Pleasure Gardens Shown
With many pictures of the beautiful
pleasure gardens, Mrs. Nuttall made
apparent the luxury of growth, and
magnificence of detail in these places.
"The introduction of European
; plants began a new era of horticulture
j in Mexico, and by 1522, sugar cane,
cotton, and many other useful products
| thrived there. In 1532, Cortez sent
| cargoes of cotton away, and in 1596,
nine Franciscan friars were in favor
of furthering this," said Mrs. Nuttall.
"Naturally the gardens were ne
glected after the conquest, but recent
ly attempts are being made to restore
the ruins.
Elaborate Details in Plans
Among the slides Mrs. Nuttall
showed were those of the formally
laid out gardens, with tiled walks, and
fountains. "These gardens," she said,

"were arranged in such a way that
the flowers were raised from the regu
lar level of the ground, for the women,
who at that time wore tight waists,
could not otherwise pick the flowers."
