# RE-ELECTION OF A. S. S. U. HEAD SET FOR TUESDAY
## Kirkwood Holds Write-In Vote Is Valid; Baker's Lead Insufficient 
### 
Three write-in votes for one candi

student body in yesterday's Quad elec

according to R. M. Kirkwood, Dean
of the Law School, who rendered a
decision this morning at 11 o'clock.

Baker from holding a majority. The
total votes cast for Baker was 544;
for Beardsley, 542.

if he receives a majority of the total
number of votes cast for that office.
Neither the Constitution nor the
By-Laws contain any express provision
as to writing in names upon the ballot.
In view of the general practice per
mitting the writing in of names, it is
my opinion that such a procedure is
proper. It seems to me that your
