# RE-ELECTION OF A. S. S. U. HEAD SET FOR TUESDAY
## Kirkwood Holds Write-In Vote Is Valid; Baker's Lead Insufficient 
### 
Three write-in votes for one candi
date in the race for president of the
student body in yesterday's Quad elec
tions make a new election necessary,
according to R. M. Kirkwood, Dean
of the Law School, who rendered a
decision this morning at 11 o'clock.
George Baker had a two point lead
over "Chuck" Beardsley in the recount
taken last night, hut the three addi
tional votes were sufficient to prevent
Baker from holding a majority. The
total votes cast for Baker was 544;
for Beardsley, 542.
Dean Kirkwood's statement follows:
Mr. A. R. Masters, President,
Associated Students,
Stanford University.
My dear Mr. Masters:
You have asked my opinion upon
several matters in connection with the
student body election held on May 20,
1924. After a consideration of the stu
dent body Constitution and the By-
Laws, adopted by the Executive Com
mittee, I have reached the following
conclusions:
Your Constitution provides in Arti
cle 11, section 5, that "it shall require
a majority of a total number of votes
cast to effect the election of any of
ficer." I am of the opinion that the
proper construction to be placed upon
this section is that an officer is elected
if he receives a majority of the total
number of votes cast for that office.
Neither the Constitution nor the
By-Laws contain any express provision
as to writing in names upon the ballot.
In view of the general practice per
mitting the writing in of names, it is
my opinion that such a procedure is
proper. It seems to me that your
Executive Committee has in effect
placed a practical construction upon
the By-Laws permitting the writing
in of names by providing a ballot with
blanks obviously intended for this
purpose.
As to the election for the Men's Stu
dent Council, I understand, that the
four persons receiving the highest
number of votes are eligible for the
office. These persons, therefore, are
clearly elected. 1 understand that the
person receiving the fifth highest
number is not eligible to hold the of
fice. It seems to me that the proce
dure by which this situation should
be cared for is established by para
graph 14 of your By-Laws, and that
therefore it is the duty of the election
board "to provide for further elections
as soon as possible." In making up
the ballot for this election the same
names should appear on the former
ballot, except that the names of the
four persons elected and the name of
the person receiving the lowest num
ber of votes should be omitted.
In regard to the amendment to the
Constitution relating to the manager
of the Quad, I am of the opinion by
its adoption the Quad ceases to be a
publication of the Junior Class and
becomes a publication of the student
body. The amendment thereby abol
ishes the offices of editor and manager
as they have previously existed. I am
therefore of the opinion that the elec-!
tion held by the Junior Class for these
offices is rendered ineffective by the
adoption of the amendment and that
the editor and manager should be ap
pointed by the board of control as pro
vided in the amendment.
Very truly yours,
M. R. KIRKWOOD, Dean.
The new election will be held next
Tuesday. The following names will ap
pear on the ballot:

Recount Necessary
The recount was made necessary i
yesterday by an unfortunate circum
stance which threatened to cloud the
entire election with doubt. Counting
•started at 2 p.m. in the Romanic Lan

guages building under the supervision
of the Election committee, and kept
open to the entire student body, ac
cording to the provisions of the con
stitution.
After the ballots had been partially
distributed, one group of counters took j
their ballots to another room. These j
ballots were not included in the sup-1
posedly final count which gave the ;
election to Baker by one vote, the |
count being 478 to 477.
These returns were considered valid, j
and sent to the Daily Palo Alto for
publication. At five o'clock, the group
of counters that had been working out
side of the regular counting place ap
peared at the Daily office with totals |
that gave the election to Beardsley by
nine votes. They had not as yet re-1
ported their findings to the election:
committee.
In view of possible irregularities in
these results, the Election committee,
under Beverly Bailard, chairman, in
stituted a recount immediately. This
count gave the following results:

Three write-in votes for one candi
date in the race for president of the
student body in yesterday's Quad elec
tions make a new election necessary,
according to R. M. Kirkwood, Dean
of the Law School, who rendered a
decision this morning at 11 o'clock.
George Baker had a two point lead
over "Chuck" Beardsley in the recount
taken last night, hut the three addi
tional votes were sufficient to prevent
Baker from holding a majority. The
total votes cast for Baker was 544;
for Beardsley, 542.
Dean Kirkwood's statement follows:
Mr. A. R. Masters, President,
Associated Students,
Stanford University.
My dear Mr. Masters:
You have asked my opinion upon
several matters in connection with the
student body election held on May 20,
1924. After a consideration of the stu
dent body Constitution and the By-
Laws, adopted by the Executive Com
mittee, I have reached the following
conclusions:
Your Constitution provides in Arti
cle 11, section 5, that "it shall require
a majority of a total number of votes
cast to effect the election of any of
ficer." I am of the opinion that the
proper construction to be placed upon
this section is that an officer is elected
if he receives a majority of the total
number of votes cast for that office.
Neither the Constitution nor the
By-Laws contain any express provision
as to writing in names upon the ballot.
In view of the general practice per
mitting the writing in of names, it is
my opinion that such a procedure is
proper. It seems to me that your
Executive Committee has in effect
placed a practical construction upon
the By-Laws permitting the writing
in of names by providing a ballot with
blanks obviously intended for this
purpose.
As to the election for the Men's Stu
dent Council, I understand, that the
four persons receiving the highest
number of votes are eligible for the
office. These persons, therefore, are
clearly elected. 1 understand that the
person receiving the fifth highest
number is not eligible to hold the of
fice. It seems to me that the proce
dure by which this situation should
be cared for is established by para
graph 14 of your By-Laws, and that
therefore it is the duty of the election
board "to provide for further elections
as soon as possible." In making up
the ballot for this election the same
names should appear on the former
ballot, except that the names of the
four persons elected and the name of
the person receiving the lowest num
ber of votes should be omitted.
In regard to the amendment to the
Constitution relating to the manager
of the Quad, I am of the opinion by
its adoption the Quad ceases to be a
publication of the Junior Class and
becomes a publication of the student
body. The amendment thereby abol
ishes the offices of editor and manager
as they have previously existed. I am
therefore of the opinion that the elec-!
tion held by the Junior Class for these
offices is rendered ineffective by the
adoption of the amendment and that
the editor and manager should be ap
pointed by the board of control as pro
vided in the amendment.
Very truly yours,
M. R. KIRKWOOD, Dean.
The new election will be held next
Tuesday. The following names will ap
pear on the ballot:

Recount Necessary
The recount was made necessary i
yesterday by an unfortunate circum
stance which threatened to cloud the
entire election with doubt. Counting
•started at 2 p.m. in the Romanic Lan

guages building under the supervision
of the Election committee, and kept
open to the entire student body, ac
cording to the provisions of the con
stitution.
After the ballots had been partially
distributed, one group of counters took j
their ballots to another room. These j
ballots were not included in the sup-1
posedly final count which gave the ;
election to Baker by one vote, the |
count being 478 to 477.
These returns were considered valid, j
and sent to the Daily Palo Alto for
publication. At five o'clock, the group
of counters that had been working out
side of the regular counting place ap
peared at the Daily office with totals |
that gave the election to Beardsley by
nine votes. They had not as yet re-1
ported their findings to the election:
committee.
In view of possible irregularities in
these results, the Election committee,
under Beverly Bailard, chairman, in
stituted a recount immediately. This
count gave the following results:

Three write-in votes for one candi
date in the race for president of the
student body in yesterday's Quad elec
tions make a new election necessary,
according to R. M. Kirkwood, Dean
of the Law School, who rendered a
decision this morning at 11 o'clock.
George Baker had a two point lead
over "Chuck" Beardsley in the recount
taken last night, hut the three addi
tional votes were sufficient to prevent
Baker from holding a majority. The
total votes cast for Baker was 544;
for Beardsley, 542.
Dean Kirkwood's statement follows:
Mr. A. R. Masters, President,
Associated Students,
Stanford University.
My dear Mr. Masters:
You have asked my opinion upon
several matters in connection with the
student body election held on May 20,
1924. After a consideration of the stu
dent body Constitution and the By-
Laws, adopted by the Executive Com
mittee, I have reached the following
conclusions:
Your Constitution provides in Arti
cle 11, section 5, that "it shall require
a majority of a total number of votes
cast to effect the election of any of
ficer." I am of the opinion that the
proper construction to be placed upon
this section is that an officer is elected
if he receives a majority of the total
number of votes cast for that office.
Neither the Constitution nor the
By-Laws contain any express provision
as to writing in names upon the ballot.
In view of the general practice per
mitting the writing in of names, it is
my opinion that such a procedure is
proper. It seems to me that your
Executive Committee has in effect
placed a practical construction upon
the By-Laws permitting the writing
in of names by providing a ballot with
blanks obviously intended for this
purpose.
As to the election for the Men's Stu
dent Council, I understand, that the
four persons receiving the highest
number of votes are eligible for the
office. These persons, therefore, are
clearly elected. 1 understand that the
person receiving the fifth highest
number is not eligible to hold the of
fice. It seems to me that the proce
dure by which this situation should
be cared for is established by para
graph 14 of your By-Laws, and that
therefore it is the duty of the election
board "to provide for further elections
as soon as possible." In making up
the ballot for this election the same
names should appear on the former
ballot, except that the names of the
four persons elected and the name of
the person receiving the lowest num
ber of votes should be omitted.
In regard to the amendment to the
Constitution relating to the manager
of the Quad, I am of the opinion by
its adoption the Quad ceases to be a
publication of the Junior Class and
becomes a publication of the student
body. The amendment thereby abol
ishes the offices of editor and manager
as they have previously existed. I am
therefore of the opinion that the elec-!
tion held by the Junior Class for these
offices is rendered ineffective by the
adoption of the amendment and that
the editor and manager should be ap
pointed by the board of control as pro
vided in the amendment.
Very truly yours,
M. R. KIRKWOOD, Dean.
The new election will be held next
Tuesday. The following names will ap
pear on the ballot:

Recount Necessary
The recount was made necessary i
yesterday by an unfortunate circum
stance which threatened to cloud the
entire election with doubt. Counting
•started at 2 p.m. in the Romanic Lan

guages building under the supervision
of the Election committee, and kept
open to the entire student body, ac
cording to the provisions of the con
stitution.
After the ballots had been partially
distributed, one group of counters took j
their ballots to another room. These j
ballots were not included in the sup-1
posedly final count which gave the ;
election to Baker by one vote, the |
count being 478 to 477.
These returns were considered valid, j
and sent to the Daily Palo Alto for
publication. At five o'clock, the group
of counters that had been working out
side of the regular counting place ap
peared at the Daily office with totals |
that gave the election to Beardsley by
nine votes. They had not as yet re-1
ported their findings to the election:
committee.
In view of possible irregularities in
these results, the Election committee,
under Beverly Bailard, chairman, in
stituted a recount immediately. This
count gave the following results:
