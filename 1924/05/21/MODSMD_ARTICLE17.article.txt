CARL SHOUP
The Daily Palo Alto rises'to state that the above-named gentleman is
one of the most enthusiastic and hard-working undergraduates in the Uni
versity at the present time. And the results of his work have been far
reaching.
As president of Sigma Delta Chi, professional journalistic fraternity
this year, he was the originator of the high school journalists' convention
idea. Shoup conceived the idea while he was attending a presidents' con
vention in the East and he carried his plan out to perfection.
Just how well the conclave succeeded, is a matter of history. Nearly
175 managers and editors of high school publications were on the campus
for two days. A new note in conventions was sounded. The program
was attractive and instructive and the visitors left Stanford, impressed by
the good treatment they received here. Shoup was largely responsible for
the success of the convention.
The fact that he did a great deal of the work himself is not surprising
to those who have been associated with him. Hard and unusual work
means no more to Shoup than routine duties do to others. As editor of
the 1924 Quad, he proved his ability as an organizer. His excellent work
showed up plainly in the high grade of book he and his staff produced.
Mr. Shoup, the Daily Palo Alto wishes to congratulate you on the
great work you have done for Stanford. You are a credit to the Univer
sity. May you have the same success in the outside world that you have
had here.
