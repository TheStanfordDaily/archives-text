# Two Track Teams
## 
### 
On the 31st of this month, two squads of Stanford track men will com
pete in championship meets, according to a decision reached by the Board
of Athletic Control last night.
While a team of fifteen of Stanford's track stars is competing in the
I. C. A. A. A. A, meet at Boston, another squad of ten or twelve men will
enter the Pacific Coast Conference meet at Eugene, Oregon. The Uni
versity is fortunate in having two such capable teams.
It is a logical step for Stanford to enter both of these meets. The Uni
versity of California will go east to defend its title in the 1. C. 4A. meet,
and, as the Cards defeated the Bears in a dual meet this year, they should
be given a chance at the title. Stanford will also be the only university
from the state of California, to enter the Pacific Coast conference meet.
This latter event is one which the coast universities should feel duty bound
to help make successful. Although the Cardinal squad at Eugene will not
l>e composed of the best track men in the university, it should make a very
strong bid for high point honors.
These two meets, coming on the same day, will be a most fitting con
clusion for the athletic vear at Stanford.
