# Dr. Jordan to Discuss Science and Sciosophy
## 
### 
"Science and Sciosophy" will be the
subject of Dr. Jordan's regular Thurs
day evening discussion this week.
"Sciosophy or shadow wisdom," says
Dr. Jordan, "is sham that looks like
science. It is organized ignorance.
Nearly all we hear about Soul, its
organization, politics, and religious
speculation belongs to Sciosophy.
Faith healing also conies in this classi
fication because it takes in people
who like things that can be gotten
without effort."
