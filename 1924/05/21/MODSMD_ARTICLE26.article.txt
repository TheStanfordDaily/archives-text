# Time Wasted and Saved Will Be Shown by Chart Of Student Movements
## 
### 
Stanford students spend a full hour
and three quarters each day in going
to and from classes, according to pre
liminary reports in the Daily Palo
Alto's investigation.
Sixteen men and women are this
week charting their time in an effort
to discover how Bill Brogan occupies
himself for the twenty-four hours of
the Stanford day. Of the sixteen, six
are hall men, five Kow men, two are
hall girls, two are sorority women,
and one woman lives in Palo Alto.
Effort has been made to represent
every phase of Farm life. Among the
sixteen are men and women interested
in athletics, dramatics, debating, jour
nalism, and student body work. Two
have averages that will entitle them
to Phi Beta Kappa elections. Two are
assistants in instruction in the Uni
versity.
The records began Monday morning
at 8 o'clock and will be kept up until
the next Monday. The complete com
pilations will appear in the Daily Palo
Alto next week.
