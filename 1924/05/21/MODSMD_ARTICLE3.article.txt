able to assist in transporting the wo
men to the Convalescent Home.

ment will do part of the work, but
there will not be enough to take all
the women to the scene of activity.

rather chauffeur that vehicle than to
pilot a shovel, pick up all the women
in sight and take them to the Conva
lescent Home. Upon arriving there,
turn back and get another load. If
each car will make two trips it should
take care of the surplus.

prospective chauffeurs are asked to
start immediately after lunch.
The women are asked to assemble
in front of Roble and in front of the
various sorority houses, where they
