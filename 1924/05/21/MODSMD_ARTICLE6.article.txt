# ANNUAL DRIVE FOR CHILDREN'S HOME FUNDS IS OPENED
## Students Will Contribute to Home, Care of Forty Convalescents 
### 
The annual Convalescent Home
drive is being conducted on the cam
pus this week. Every student is being
solicited for contributions. The funds
thus obtained will be used for the
maintenance and upkeep of the Home.
The Stanford Home for Convale
scent Children is supported by endow
ments and by contributions from the
University students. The original idea
of the Home as conceived by Dr.
Charles Gardner, president of the
board of directors, was to foster social
service work among the students.
Summer Camp in 1919
In 1919 a summer camp for conva
lescent children from San Francisco
was established at the present Isola
tion Hospital. During the first three
years 120 children were cared for.
With the beginning of summer school,
the camp had to be discontinued. At
the urgent request of the doctors of
the clinics, a home which should be
open throughout the year was started.
In 1920 the institution took up its per
manent home at the old Stanford resi
dence.
Forty Children Cared For
During the last five years the home
has become an important institution
with a staff of ten people, an endow
ment of $110,000 and an annual in
come of $25,000. The building of the
Crocker unit in which are kept twenty
patients, increased the accommoda
tions of the home to forty children.
Convalescents live in the Stanford unit
where excellent care and both outdoor
and indoor playgrounds are provided
for them.
Solicitors are asked to report on
their work Thursday, although the
drive will continue several days.
