## 
### 
With a discussion as to the choosing
of a new name for the organization
slated to occupy part of the time, a
meeting of the American Journalists
Association will be held tomorrow at
1:30 in the Press building.
The association has been active in
bringing a number of interesting
speakers to the campus during the
past year, including Begbie Fowler,
assistant publisher of the Chronicle,
and Cole, the western head of the
Associated Press.
