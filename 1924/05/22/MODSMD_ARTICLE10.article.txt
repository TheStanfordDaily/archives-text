# D. P. A. EXPERIMENT NEARS CONCLUSION
## 
### 
Is going to San Jose a duly consti
tuted pleasure or is it a duty? Then
where is it to be charted in the blanks
furnished one for the Daily Palo Alto
research to find out just how students
spend their time?
The experiment enters its fourth
day today. The sixteen subjects, repre
senting nearly every type of student,
passed the half-way mark successfully,
furnishing an agglomeration of data
that threatens to reveal astounding
wastes of golden hours.
Each morning those enlisted in the
services of this experiment hand in
charts accounting for every minute of
the day. The complete revelations of
the research will be divulged next
Tuesday when the final tabulations
have been finished.
