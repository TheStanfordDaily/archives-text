# EVERY RUSHING SYSTEM HAS ITS OBSTACLES--YOST
## It Is Only Fair To Judge Sororities After Difficulties Are Eliminated By Co-operation Of Everyone 
### 
"Every rushing system has its
ous difficulties," said Dean Mary Yost,
when questioned concerning her opin
ion of the success of the year rushing
system, which concluded with pledg
ing last Sunday.
"But we must all work together in
order to eliminate these difficulties as
far as possible," she continued. "Only
after we have accomplished this can
we judge fairly whether the gravest
of them are inherent, and whether or
not the sororities can justify their
existence."
Dean Yost believes that the present
system is better than the former three
quarter rushing plan, and also super*

ior to last year's arrangement, which
allowed entertaining throughout the
year. She considers the elimination ol
all-night rushing dates a big factor in
the success of the present system.
• "During the last week, the sorority
women have tried to live up to the
contract and have succeeded admir
ably as far as I know. The entertain
ing has been saner than ever before
and almost astounding in its simpli
city. At Roble, Miss Gardiner reports
the quietest, least hysterical rushing
season she has ever witnessed. In
spite of the weary girls I see this
week, I believe the present plan has
been a saving in time, money, and
energy."
Dean Yost urged that the events of
pledging day itself should not be con
fused with the success of the system.
These should be considered separately,
because rules governing pledging may
be altered without affecting the sys
tem itself.
"I would like to commend the Daily,
Palo Alto for the fearless way in
which the exhibition of last Sunday
morning was condemned," continued
Dean Yost. She considered the whole |
affair not only embarrassing to the
women themselves, but disturbing to [
the whole community. The worst fea-!
ture, in her opinion, was that the trou-j
ble occurred during church time. Such j
a demonstration reflects on the ideals j
of Stanford itself.
"It is only fair to state that the
women had tried to get ahead of trou
ble. Pan-Hellenic requested the Inter
fraternity Conference to do all in its i
power to keep things normal, and par- 1
ticularly to avoid any conspicuous i
demonstration. Also, the Alumnae!
Council of Pan-Hellenic spoke to Men's !
Council, so the men were informed ot' I
the wishes of the women. But the!
thing to do now is not to spend time
placing the blame," she said. "We
must realize that both the men and
the women were responsible. The
women were at fault in their choice
of the time of day, selecting a time
when the men were idle and were apt
to be on the lawns or iding about. The
men, certainly, under any circum
stances, could not justify such rowdi
ness."
Plans are being made for next year
by means of which the women will
try to remedy their mistake of this
season in the matter of time for going
to the lawyer. Dean Yost feels that a
change in the time element is most
essential.

mester rushing for three years the j
Dartmouth University Interfraternity
Council has voted to operate rushing;
next fall for eight weeks.

ing last Sunday.
"But we must all work together in
order to eliminate these difficulties as
far as possible," she continued. "Only
after we have accomplished this can
we judge fairly whether the gravest
of them are inherent, and whether or
not the sororities can justify their
existence."
Dean Yost believes that the present
system is better than the former three
quarter rushing plan, and also super*

ior to last year's arrangement, which
allowed entertaining throughout the
year. She considers the elimination ol
all-night rushing dates a big factor in
the success of the present system.
• "During the last week, the sorority
women have tried to live up to the
contract and have succeeded admir
ably as far as I know. The entertain
ing has been saner than ever before
and almost astounding in its simpli
city. At Roble, Miss Gardiner reports
the quietest, least hysterical rushing
season she has ever witnessed. In
spite of the weary girls I see this
week, I believe the present plan has
been a saving in time, money, and
energy."
Dean Yost urged that the events of
pledging day itself should not be con
fused with the success of the system.
These should be considered separately,
because rules governing pledging may
be altered without affecting the sys
tem itself.
"I would like to commend the Daily,
Palo Alto for the fearless way in
which the exhibition of last Sunday
morning was condemned," continued
Dean Yost. She considered the whole |
affair not only embarrassing to the
women themselves, but disturbing to [
the whole community. The worst fea-!
ture, in her opinion, was that the trou-j
ble occurred during church time. Such j
a demonstration reflects on the ideals j
of Stanford itself.
"It is only fair to state that the
women had tried to get ahead of trou
ble. Pan-Hellenic requested the Inter
fraternity Conference to do all in its i
power to keep things normal, and par- 1
ticularly to avoid any conspicuous i
demonstration. Also, the Alumnae!
Council of Pan-Hellenic spoke to Men's !
Council, so the men were informed ot' I
the wishes of the women. But the!
thing to do now is not to spend time
placing the blame," she said. "We
must realize that both the men and
the women were responsible. The
women were at fault in their choice
of the time of day, selecting a time
when the men were idle and were apt
to be on the lawns or iding about. The
men, certainly, under any circum
stances, could not justify such rowdi
ness."
Plans are being made for next year
by means of which the women will
try to remedy their mistake of this
season in the matter of time for going
to the lawyer. Dean Yost feels that a
change in the time element is most
essential.
After experimenting with second se
mester rushing for three years the j
Dartmouth University Interfraternity
Council has voted to operate rushing;
next fall for eight weeks.
"Every rushing system has its
ous difficulties," said Dean Mary Yost,
when questioned concerning her opin
ion of the success of the year rushing
system, which concluded with pledg
ing last Sunday.
