# Stanford Roads Closed To Preserve Campus as Privately Owned Estate
## 
### 
I Seventeen men are being employed
! tod"iv in keeping all entrances to the
campus ''oped off in order to preserve
the Stanford estate as private grounds.
1 he law requires that the roads be
j closed in this way one day every year
|to prevent the University property
i from reverting to the state. Cars
J leaving the campus are not required
| to stop, but vehicles coming in must
wait until the rope is let down. While
I automobile drivers experience slight
j inconvenience, the employes who sit
j comfortably on the ground and let
down the ropes earn a rather easy
four dollars for their day's work.
