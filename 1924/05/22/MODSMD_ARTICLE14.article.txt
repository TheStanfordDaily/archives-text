# GOODSPEED TO TALK ON NEW TESTAMENT
## 
### 
Edgar J. Goodspeed of the Univer
sity of Chicago is to deliver an ad
dress on "Why Translate the New
Testament?" at the Unitarian Hall on
Cowper street at eight o'clock Satur
day evening.
Goodspeed has recently made a
| translation of the New Testament into
j modern English vernacular, which has
evoked a good deal of comment, both
, favorable and unfavorable. Many con
j slder that it lacks the reverence found
lin the older, particularly the King
j James, versions.
j Those favorable argue that it lacks
! none of the older reverence and that
lit is far more readable and under
standable to the average person of
r today. They maintain that the New
i Testament was originally written for
the people as a whole in the idiom of
the day. and that this translation
I comes nearer to the spirit of the
original than any other. It has also
been suggested that the new version
: makes an admirable supplement for
those who are unwilling to give up
the beautiful phrasing of the old.
