# KERR WILL TAKE 15 TRACKSTERS NORTH FOR COAST CLASSIC
## Washington and O. A. C. Will Furnish Opposition for Stanford Seconds 
### 
Andy Kerr will be seen in a new
role next week when he leaves for
Eugene, Ore., on Wednesday, as coach
of the Stanford track team on its in
vasion of the Northwest.
Kerr will take twelve men with him,
the best of the tracksters who are not
making the trip to the I. C. A. A. A. A.
The party will be under the direction
of Fred Slierrill, 1925 track manager.
The following men have been se
lected to make the trip:
Hal Boles in the hurdles; "Scotchy"
Campbell in the discus throw; Al
Charles in the two-mile run; Guy Den
nis in the pole vault; Norm Dole and
Charlie Daly in the half mile run;
Evers in the javelin throw; Louie
Gaspar in the sprints; Lou Kemnitzer
in the high jump; Dick Richards in
the shot put; Bill Storie in the 440
yard run; and Bill Wright in the broad
jump.
Alternates Named
In the event that some of the above
named men are unable to go three
alternates were named, who will be
selected in the following order: Frank
Hayes, "Pat" Murphy, and Phil Sco
field.
Only California Team
The University of Washington and
the Oregon Agricultural College are
said to have the strongest teams in
the northern half of the Pacific Coast.
Conference, and it is probable that
most of the opposition will come from
these sources. As both California and
U. S. C. are entering teams in the
I. C. A. A. A. A. the Stanford team
will be the only aggregation upholding
the honor of the Golden State in the
Coast contests.
The weight men from the three
California schools are expected to be
the strongest contenders for all places
at the Boston meet. With Hartranft,
Arthur, Hauser, Anderson, Neufeldt,
and Francis competing, the easterners
will have to extend themselves.
Hills Best in East
Hills of Princeton is probably the
outstanding shot putter of the East.
However, his best mark this season is
47 feet 8 inches, which can hardly
compare with Hartranft's put of 50
feet 11 y 2 inches.
Carpenter of Harvard has been do
ing some phenomenal work in the dis
cus. His three best heaves of the
year are 153 feet 6; 152 feet 2; and
149 feet 7. Hartranft made 154 feet in
the U. S. C. meet, after trailing behind
Anderson and Hauser for the first few
throws, and if Carpenter should hap
pen to lead in the qualifying throws,
"Tiny" is very likely to get mad and
toss the platter out for a new world's
mark.

Hills Best in East
Hills of Princeton is probably the
outstanding shot putter of the East.
However, his best mark this season is
47 feet 8 inches, which can hardly
compare with Hartranft's put of 50
feet 11 y 2 inches.
Carpenter of Harvard has been do
ing some phenomenal work in the dis
cus. His three best heaves of the
year are 153 feet 6; 152 feet 2; and
149 feet 7. Hartranft made 154 feet in
the U. S. C. meet, after trailing behind
Anderson and Hauser for the first few
throws, and if Carpenter should hap
pen to lead in the qualifying throws,
"Tiny" is very likely to get mad and
toss the platter out for a new world's
mark.
Andy Kerr will be seen in a new
role next week when he leaves for
Eugene, Ore., on Wednesday, as coach
of the Stanford track team on its in
vasion of the Northwest.
Kerr will take twelve men with him,
the best of the tracksters who are not
making the trip to the I. C. A. A. A. A.
The party will be under the direction
of Fred Slierrill, 1925 track manager.
The following men have been se
lected to make the trip:
Hal Boles in the hurdles; "Scotchy"
Campbell in the discus throw; Al
Charles in the two-mile run; Guy Den
nis in the pole vault; Norm Dole and
Charlie Daly in the half mile run;
Evers in the javelin throw; Louie
Gaspar in the sprints; Lou Kemnitzer
in the high jump; Dick Richards in
the shot put; Bill Storie in the 440
yard run; and Bill Wright in the broad
jump.
Alternates Named
In the event that some of the above
named men are unable to go three
alternates were named, who will be
selected in the following order: Frank
Hayes, "Pat" Murphy, and Phil Sco
field.
Only California Team
The University of Washington and
the Oregon Agricultural College are
said to have the strongest teams in
the northern half of the Pacific Coast.
Conference, and it is probable that
most of the opposition will come from
these sources. As both California and
U. S. C. are entering teams in the
I. C. A. A. A. A. the Stanford team
will be the only aggregation upholding
the honor of the Golden State in the
Coast contests.
The weight men from the three
California schools are expected to be
the strongest contenders for all places
at the Boston meet. With Hartranft,
Arthur, Hauser, Anderson, Neufeldt,
and Francis competing, the easterners
will have to extend themselves.
