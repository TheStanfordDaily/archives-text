# Labor Day
## 
### 
Hundreds of students, armed with hoes, rakes, and other implements
invaded the grounds about the Convalescent Home this afternoon, bent on
destruction. A year's accumulation of weeds and underbrush awaited
them. By the time the Daily Palo Alto is in the hands of the students the
Convalescent Home will look like a new place and another Labor Day will
be over.
One of the most worthy of Stanford traditions,, Labor Day was started
in 1920. Up to that time, eight sophomores had gone to the Home every
Saturday to carry on the clean-up work. The amount of work increased
to such an extent that a new plan was made necessary. It was decided to
set aside one day each year as a half holiday when the students would
turn out to do the work.
Labor Day is one of the most democratic of Stanford institutions. On
that occasion, men and women alike set aside studies and social activities to
join in the good work.
The Convalescent Home, formerly the Stanford Home, is indeed a
fitting setting for such activities. Senator and Mrs. Stanford would be
proud, could they wander about the grounds of their old home and see
hundreds of students beautifying the place for the benefit of forty con
valescent children. *
