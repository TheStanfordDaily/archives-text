# ARTIST DESCRIBES MEMORIAL CHURCH WINDOWS IN TALK
## 
### 
Difficulties of putting into glass the
conceptions of great painters, where
every piece of separate color had to
be leaded, kept him awake many
nights, according to Frederick S.
Lamb, executing artist of the Me
morial Church windows, who gave the
"Story of the Windows" in a talk in
the church yesterday afternoon.
He said that the spaces for the win
dows were not often the same sizes
and shapes as the canvases, and there
were innumerable problems to be
overcome in the work.

"There is a great message in the
Memorial Church windows," he de
clared. "It is the.message which Mrs.
Stanford hoped would live for future
generations when she carried out her
plan for erecting the beautiful build
ing in spite of the criticism of the
materialists who thought the money
should be used for other purposes."
Mr. Lamb told the story of how, as
a young man, he was given the oppor
tunity of designing and executing the
windows. When he arrived on the cam
pus he was disappointed to learn that
he was not to have the chance of
creating a unified design for the
church windows, but that instead he
was to translate into glass, master
pieces of German, French, and Italian
art according to Mrs. Stanford's se
lection.
Great Works Please
He expressed his pleasure that the
work is a translation of world master
pieces, instead of original ideas of an
"immature artist."
His favorite is the window illus
trating "Pilate's Wife's Dream," in
Dore's Illustrated !3ible. To depict the
huge crowd in stained glass, where an
exact replica would be impossible, was
one of the most puzzling problems in
the entire work, according to Mr.
Lamb. It is the window nearest the
front of the Church in the south nave.
University Has Future
"Stanford University has a great
future," said Lamb. "The future of
the world lies in the west of this
country. Already exports to Asia ex
ceed those to Europe, and in another
ten or fifteen years, San Francisco will
be a world metropolis, and this penin
sula the center of world interest."
He spoke on a variety of subjects,
showing a keen interest in religion,
education, and world progress. He
commented upon the youth of today,
the value of art to the layman, and
importance of morality and decency.

He expressed his pleasure that the
work is a translation of world master
pieces, instead of original ideas of an
"immature artist."
His favorite is the window illus
trating "Pilate's Wife's Dream," in
Dore's Illustrated !3ible. To depict the
huge crowd in stained glass, where an
exact replica would be impossible, was
one of the most puzzling problems in
the entire work, according to Mr.
Lamb. It is the window nearest the
front of the Church in the south nave.
University Has Future
"Stanford University has a great
future," said Lamb. "The future of
the world lies in the west of this
country. Already exports to Asia ex
ceed those to Europe, and in another
ten or fifteen years, San Francisco will
be a world metropolis, and this penin
sula the center of world interest."
He spoke on a variety of subjects,
showing a keen interest in religion,
education, and world progress. He
commented upon the youth of today,
the value of art to the layman, and
importance of morality and decency.
Difficulties of putting into glass the
conceptions of great painters, where
every piece of separate color had to
be leaded, kept him awake many
nights, according to Frederick S.
Lamb, executing artist of the Me
morial Church windows, who gave the
"Story of the Windows" in a talk in
the church yesterday afternoon.
He said that the spaces for the win
dows were not often the same sizes
and shapes as the canvases, and there
were innumerable problems to be
overcome in the work.
Contain Message
"There is a great message in the
Memorial Church windows," he de
clared. "It is the.message which Mrs.
Stanford hoped would live for future
generations when she carried out her
plan for erecting the beautiful build
ing in spite of the criticism of the
materialists who thought the money
should be used for other purposes."
Mr. Lamb told the story of how, as
a young man, he was given the oppor
tunity of designing and executing the
windows. When he arrived on the cam
pus he was disappointed to learn that
he was not to have the chance of
creating a unified design for the
church windows, but that instead he
was to translate into glass, master
pieces of German, French, and Italian
art according to Mrs. Stanford's se
lection.
