# A 						Second Election
## 
### 
For the first time in many years, the students of the University were
unable to decide on a student body president at the Quad election last Tues
day. Next Tuesday, the two leading candidates will run for a second
time. Several other offices must be filled at that time.
In past years when second elections have been necessary, interest has
dropped off to such an extent that the final choices did not represent a ma
jority opinion or nearly a majority. This time, the offices to be filled are
too important for that sort of thing to happen.
The closeness of the vote last Tuesday indicates that student opinion is
divided almost equally between the two candidates for student body presi
dent. Next Tuesday, more than any other time, it is necessary that every
student turn out and vote in order that the final selection will be made by a
majority of voters.
