# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT

Editor Daily Palo Alto:
The proposed amendment providing
that the Spectator be published by
the A. S. S. U., with a subsidy pro
vided by an assessment on every stu
dent whether he cares for the publica
tion or not seems a bit raw. The case
of the Daily is far different, since it
serves as an agency for disseminating
campus news and announcements. But
when it comes to the type of publica
tion represented by the Spectator,
with its feature articles, etc., I do not
believe the student body should be
assessed.
That something must be done to
nave the Spectator from failure is ap-

parent, but this Is not the way. At
least a large percentage of students
have so indicated by refusing to pa
tronize either the Spectator or its
predecessors, the Cardinal and the
Pictorial.—Don M. Chase.
