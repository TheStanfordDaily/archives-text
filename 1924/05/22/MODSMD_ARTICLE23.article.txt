# PROFESSORS, D. P. A. TO PREPARE "FACTS ABOUT THE LEAGUE"
## 
### 
Muddled by over six years of in
cessant argument, the League of Na
tions has come to mean little else
than a subject of abysmal boredom.
But after these six years of argument,
and these four years of actual opera
tion, do you know what its organiza
tion is? What its jurisdiction is? What
duties it has? What it has actually
succeeded in doing and wherein it has
failed?
Eleven members of the Stanford fac
ulty have co-operated with a reporter
on the Daily Palo Alto in an effort to
present the "Facts About the League"
in a clear, concise fashion. Their ef
forts will be included in a series of
twelve articles, which will appear
daily, starting tomorrow.

Government.
Muddled by over six years of in
cessant argument, the League of Na
tions has come to mean little else
than a subject of abysmal boredom.
But after these six years of argument,
and these four years of actual opera
tion, do you know what its organiza
tion is? What its jurisdiction is? What
duties it has? What it has actually
succeeded in doing and wherein it has
failed?
Eleven members of the Stanford fac
ulty have co-operated with a reporter
on the Daily Palo Alto in an effort to
present the "Facts About the League"
in a clear, concise fashion. Their ef
forts will be included in a series of
twelve articles, which will appear
daily, starting tomorrow.
