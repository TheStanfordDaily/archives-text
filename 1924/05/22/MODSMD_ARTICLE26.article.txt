### 
The notion that athletes are likely
to be shorter lived than other men,
that their training and participation
In contests "burns them out," is non
sense, according to J. Fred Bohler,
director of physical training for men
at the State College of Washington.
"The so-called 'athletic heart' is
not due to athletic training, but the
heart is a muscle like any other in the
body, and if one accustomed to regu
lar, wholesome activity suddenly quits
and sits around, his muscles gradually
become flabby and accumulate layers
of fat. Then when a sudden strain is
put upon them, they are not equal to
it. Just so with the heart."
