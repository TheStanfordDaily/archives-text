# Soft Drink of Hollywood Introduced in Palo Alto
## 
### 
"Choc Oh Boy" is the name of the
latest in thirst quenchers being intro
duced at the new soda fountain in the
Morey Smoke Shop in Palo Alto.
With a number of other drinks the
recipe for this was imported direct
from Hollywood, where, it is said, the
genius of the great Mary herself
helped in the concoction.
When business becomes especially
rushed at the fountain, students have
gone behind the counter themselves
in order to become adept at the one
indoor sport that is useful in the sum
mertime.
