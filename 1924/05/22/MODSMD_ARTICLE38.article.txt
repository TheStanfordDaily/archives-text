The Making of Glenn Hartranft
A large number of celebrities have
just claim for credit in the making of
Glenn Hartranft, shot and discus per
former extraordinary, sprint man, and
football star. Yet the real blame for all
of this rests not on "Dink" Templeton,
"Pop" Warner, or any of those, but
on the massive shoulders of Glenn
Hartranft himself.
He was born, weaned, reared, and
raised on a farm. He knew how to
milk cows before he could say "da-da."
He learned how to toss hay with a
pitchfork before he could handle a
table-spoon. The only dolls he ever
cared for were the calves, dogs, and
chickens in the barnyard. The nearest
he ever got to a tall building was the
interior of his dad's silo.
All of this happened before the lowa
farmers got civilized and started to
use new-fangled field machines. There
was a time, you know, when a plough
was a plow and the main source of
power was a ramshackle pinto horse
that could pull once in a while. The
main trouble in this work was the
horse's reluctance to pull and the oc
casional clod or stone that blocked
the passage of the furrow. Hartranft
early saw a connection between the
two.
Every time the horse struck one of
those obstacles, Hartranft would stop
to pick it up and throw it at the mule.
He always had to use large clods to
turn the trick. Practice begot effi
ciency. In time he could toss any boul
der at any old hoss. Although in later
years, he left the environment of the
farm, he never forgot his knack of
tossing rocks.
