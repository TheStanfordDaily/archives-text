# TURKISH EXPERIENCE IS SUBJECT OF TALK BY RELIEF WORKER
## 
### 
At a meeting of the Clasical Club
held last night, Mrs. Knox spoke rfn
her experiences as a relief worker in
Turkey immediately after the war.
She went with the first contingent
of relief workers, and made the jour
ney by the devious routes of wartime.
They were the first civilians to cross
the Dardanelles since the war, going
on a British hospital ship. When they
arrived at Constantinople, headquar
ters sent them to a German warehouse
down the coast where they unloaded
supply shps from America.
Cared For Children
From here she went rather indi
rectly to Samsoun, where there was
a great number of Greek children to
be cared for. Mrs. Knox worked here
for a year and a half, bringing order
out of chaos. She was obliged to
mingle in Greek politics, but ended
by getting proper buildings and sani
tation, establishing industrial classes,
and most important, segregating the
diseased.
After a year and a half of this, she
taught mediaeval history for a year
in the American College for Women
at Constantinople. The work there
was especially interesting, she said,
because of the many nationalities
represented. There was no ill feeling
among the girls, however, despite the
fact that the Turks and the Greeks
were then at war.
