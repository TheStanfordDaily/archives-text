consistent favor among the critics.
Miss Fox is one of the best known

Chorus Is Organized
Director Warren D. Allen already
has the organization of the huge
! chorus for "Elijah" well under way.
The body of 500 voices has been finally
made up almost exactly as announced
at the outset, with the best voices of
the College of the Pacific chorus and
i the A Cappella Choir, the San Mateo
! and Mountain View Choral societies,
the Palo Alto-Stanford chorus, and
more than 100 members of the Festi
val Chorus of San Francisco.
Graduate Manager Paul Davis of
Stanford, who returned Tuesday from
Boston, now has direct charge of all
business arrangements for the Sta
dium production. The old stage which
was used for the opera production
two years ago will be put together
again for the oratorio, and additional
bleachers must be built for the chorus.
According to Davis, and Comptroller
A. E. Roth, the Rotary clubs of San

terial assistance in the promotion of
Stanford's first great musical event,
and indications are that one of the
largest audiences in the history of
peninsula music will be present on
June 8.
