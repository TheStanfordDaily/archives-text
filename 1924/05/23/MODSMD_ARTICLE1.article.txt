# OLYMPIC AQUATIC TRYOUTS SET FOR COMING WEEK-END
## Fast limes Expected From Stevenson of Stanford, Hawaiian Entries 
### 
Times faster than those made in the
last Olympic Games are expected to
be recorded in the far western swim
ming and diving tryouts for the 1924
Olympiad at Searsville tomorrow and
Sunday. Survivors of these tests will
go to Indianapolis for the national
tryouts June 5 to 7.
Men's 200-meter free style swim
ming imd springboard diving are sche
duled for 2 o'clock Saturday, while
the remaining events for both men
and women will take place at the
same hour Sunday.
Carl Stevenson of Stanford, Lester
Smith of the Olympic Club, and Sam
Kahanamoku and Warren and Pua
Kealoha of Hawaii are among the men
most likely to shatter existing rec
ords.
Stevenson, who recently won the
national junior championship in the
1500-meter free style, is the lone
Cardinal who will enter the swimming
events.
A1 White, present national senior
diving champion, and Dave Fall, junior
low board titleholder, are the Stan
ford divers who are conceded the best
chance to participate in the world
meet. Brandsten has also entered Ted
Smith.
These three, together with Clarence
Pinkston, and DeFerrari of the Olym
pic Club, will probably be the only
contestants in the springboard events
both Saturday and Sunday. Sam Kah
anamoku and Lester Smith are doped
to swim a close race in the 200-meter
free style.
Sam, brother of the famous "Duke,"
has never had to fully extend himself
while in this country. Smith has cov
ered the distance in very fast time
in the past and has been steadily
improving.
Hawaiians Strong Contenders
Kahanamoku, the two Kealoha
brothers, Warren and Pua, and Rob
ertson of the Olympic Club are among
the foremost contenders in the 100-
meter free style. Warren Kealoha took
first place in the 100-meter back stroke
at the last Olympics, and Pua placed
second to "Duke" Kahanamoku in the
100-meter free style, and swam in the
relay.
In the 400-meter free style Pua,
Kealoha, Lunning of Honolulu, and
Lester Smith loom most favorably.
Besides Stevenson in the 1500-meter,
Goldwater of Stockton, Mooney of
Santa Clara, and Purcell of the Olym
pic Club, are slated to be well up in
the running.
Warren Keoloha, Charlie Pung, and
Gay Harris, of the Hawaiian contin
gent will vie with Smith for supre
macy in the 100-meter back stroke,
with the first-named paddler having
a slight edge in view of his past per
formances. Kirschbaum of the Islands
seems to be the outstanding contest
ant in the 200-meter breast stroke.
Clarita Hunsberger Good
Little definite information is avail
able concerning the entries in the
women's events, which will be the
same as the men's with the exception
of the 200- and 1500-meter free style.
Clarita Hunsberger, Stanford entry, is
conceded a good chance in the diving.
Hilda Curtis, nationally known pad
dler, is entered in the 400-meter free
style. Frances Cowell Schroth, who
represented America in the 1920 Olym
piad, has already left for the East to
participate in the preliminary tryouts
at Indianapolis.
