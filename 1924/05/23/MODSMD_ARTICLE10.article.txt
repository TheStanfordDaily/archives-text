# No. 1. THE ASSEMBLY
## 
### 
j AFFICIAL deposition of the ratifications of the treaty of Versailles at the
French Foreign Office, at Paris, on January 10, 1920, at 4:15 p.m., formally
brought the LEAGUE of NATIONS into being. By tiiat deposit the British
Empire, France, Italy, Japan, Belgium, and nine other small nations became
tlie first fourteen members of the League.
The organization of the League is very complicated. The outline was
created at the Versailles Conference, but if remained for the bodies formed

by that conference to create the vari
ous smaller organs, upon which so
much of the actual hard work depends.
This has been accomplished in the
space of four years.
Membership
The primary organs of tin* League
are the Assembly, Council, Interna
tional Court, and Secretariat-General.
Membership of the Assembly is com
posed of all League members, num
bering at the present time fifty-four
nations of the globe. The only nations
that are not members of the League -

and therefore are not members of the
Assembly are: Afghanistan, Domini
can Republic, Ecuador. Germany, Mex-1
! ico, Russian Union of Soviet Repub
j lies, Turkey, and the United States
of America. New members may be
added by n two-thirds vote of the
Assembly.
Each State Member of the League
is represented by a delegation of not
more than three members, although
the three together are allowed but
one vote. As in all League conferences,
the delegations to the Assembly are
government delegations, appointed by
and responsible to the governments of
the states they represent.
All questions of procedure, in
cluding the formation of committees
and the matterg to be dealt with by
each committee, are settled by
merely majority vote —a point which,
as the experience of the Genoa Con
ference has shown, is of the utmost
importance for the small nations.
Sovereignty Safeguarded
On the other hand, as a further safe
guard of sovereignty, all decisions of
substance, as distinguished from mat
ters of form and procedure, require
unanimity. The reason for this is that
no government will permit itself to be
made to do certain things that a!
majority of foreign nations desires it
to do. A "recommendation" may be
passed by majority vote, and frequent
ly the Assembly uses it to get out of
a deadlock arising from the unanimity
rule.
The main jurisdiction of the Assem-■
bly deals with any matter "within the
sphere of action of the League or af- 1
fecting the peace of the world." In
addition it has certain specified pow
ers, such as passing on the annual re
port of the work of the Council, Secre
tariat, and International Labor Office,
determining the budget, electing
judges of the Permanent Court of In
ternational Justice, electing non-per
manent members of the Council, etc.
The meetings, which are held an
nually on the first Monday in Septem
ber and which are public unless indi
viduals are discussed, consider any
question presented by any member. !
Criticism by Professor Victor West
"The Assembly of the League of Na
tions has been characterized' as 'noth- 1
ing but a debating society,' because
it has no final authority to settle the
questions which come before it. Well,
what the world needs most right now
is just that —an international debating
society. Most occasions for interna
tional discord would pass harmlessly
by if everybody concerned had a
chance to say his say," says Professor
V. J. West of the Political Science
Department.
"Just as explosions are avoided in
steam engines by the use of safety
valves, so in politics opportunity to
"blow off" will oft-times avert disas
ter. The Assembly of the League fur
nishes this opportunity periodically
under circumstances which insure to
every nation a chance to be heard on
every question and which discourage
truculence and swash-buckling. That
is a good deal to have accomplished
in a disorganized world."

"The Assembly of the League of Na

ing but a debating society,' because
it has no final authority to settle the
questions which come before it. Well,
what the world needs most right now
is just that —an international debating
society. Most occasions for interna

by if everybody concerned had a
chance to say his say," says Professor
V. J. West of the Political Science

j AFFICIAL deposition of the ratifications of the treaty of Versailles at the
French Foreign Office, at Paris, on January 10, 1920, at 4:15 p.m., formally
brought the LEAGUE of NATIONS into being. By tiiat deposit the British
Empire, France, Italy, Japan, Belgium, and nine other small nations became
tlie first fourteen members of the League.
The organization of the League is very complicated. The outline was
created at the Versailles Conference, but if remained for the bodies formed

by that conference to create the vari
ous smaller organs, upon which so
much of the actual hard work depends.
This has been accomplished in the
space of four years.
Membership
The primary organs of tin* League
are the Assembly, Council, Interna
tional Court, and Secretariat-General.
Membership of the Assembly is com
posed of all League members, num
bering at the present time fifty-four
nations of the globe. The only nations
that are not members of the League -

and therefore are not members of the
Assembly are: Afghanistan, Domini
can Republic, Ecuador. Germany, Mex-1
! ico, Russian Union of Soviet Repub
j lies, Turkey, and the United States
of America. New members may be
added by n two-thirds vote of the
Assembly.
Each State Member of the League
is represented by a delegation of not
more than three members, although
the three together are allowed but
one vote. As in all League conferences,
the delegations to the Assembly are
government delegations, appointed by
and responsible to the governments of
the states they represent.
All questions of procedure, in
cluding the formation of committees
and the matterg to be dealt with by
each committee, are settled by
merely majority vote —a point which,
as the experience of the Genoa Con
ference has shown, is of the utmost
importance for the small nations.
Sovereignty Safeguarded
On the other hand, as a further safe
guard of sovereignty, all decisions of
substance, as distinguished from mat
ters of form and procedure, require
unanimity. The reason for this is that
no government will permit itself to be
made to do certain things that a!
majority of foreign nations desires it
to do. A "recommendation" may be
passed by majority vote, and frequent
ly the Assembly uses it to get out of
a deadlock arising from the unanimity
rule.
The main jurisdiction of the Assem-■
bly deals with any matter "within the
sphere of action of the League or af- 1
fecting the peace of the world." In
addition it has certain specified pow
ers, such as passing on the annual re
port of the work of the Council, Secre
tariat, and International Labor Office,
determining the budget, electing
judges of the Permanent Court of In
ternational Justice, electing non-per
manent members of the Council, etc.
