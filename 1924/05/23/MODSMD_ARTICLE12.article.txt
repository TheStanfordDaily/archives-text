# BOOTLEG IS MENACE TO GOVERNMENT-HYDE
## "Politics Should Be Separated From Prohibition," Says Faculty Member 
### 
"With every drink of bootleg, a si
lent toast is given, either consciously
! or unconsciously, to the downfall of
! majority government, a matter whifh
no true American can afford to treat
j lightly."
So says Professor James M. Hyde
iof the Engineering department, who
' is a member of the State Central Com*
i mittee of the Republican Party, and
is known as "Uncle Jimmy Hyde," an
j thor of political pamphlets to rouse
i the people to a sense of true Ameri-
I canism.
Should Not Discriminate
"Every American should realize
that he must live by all the laws, not
; only those that meet with his per
; sonal fancy.
"He should also realize that when
: he pays the price of bootleg liquor,
I but a small part pays the actual cost
of bootleg liquor, and the rest goes
for the corruption of the United States
, government and murder of the offi
cials of the law, if necessary.
"More than thirty prohibition en
-1 forcement officials have been mur
dered during the performance of duty
, â€”thugs were hired by those who paid
i for the bootleg liquor which could not
be delivered without getting the of
ficers out of the way," he said,
i Professor Hyde continued: "If oth
jerwise decent citizens did not pay for
; the corruption of the government, the
liquor traffic could soon be brought
under almost complete control." He
j advocated the divorcement of the ad
j ministration of national prohibition,
j from politics.
"It will be the duty of Attorney Gen
; eral Stone to eradicate from the gov
j eminent those who will not enforce
the law," he said. "Recently there has
been protection up to Daugherty him
self, by tolerance, not by premedita
tion."
Regarding the national political situ
ation, Hyde says that Coolidge's
changes in the cabinet have satisfied
the publiP. "His appointments have
impressed the people that he is a good
man."
Reaction Is General
In regard to the situation in Cali
fornia, Hyde said: "I expected this
state to react to the general situation
as the rest of the country did.
"The whole of the primary results
have shown that the people are not
looking for irreconcilables. Of these,
Senator Moses of New Hampshire was
turned down, as was Senator Reed of
Missouri. It was the same with Hiram
Johnson.
"The California primaries showed
that in national policies, the country
is not behind Johnson in his extreme
irreconcilability. People are tired of
the perpetual scold. Johnson has been
against every president since 1912.
The people of California observed that
while Johnson went around talking a
great deal, Coolidge was working and
saying nothing.
California Not Blind
"Californians no longer believe that
they owe a blind allegiance to Johnson
for what he did a dozen years ago."
In Hyde's opinion, support of John
son is not necessarily progressive on
account of his national politics. He
believes that the removal of Johnson's
personality would permit the Repub
licans to give a forward-looking gov
ernment to the state.
He maintained that Coolidge's ad
ministration is not for the purpose of
further legislation, but gives an op
portunity for the administration to
catch up and put in effect the laws
that are already formulated.
