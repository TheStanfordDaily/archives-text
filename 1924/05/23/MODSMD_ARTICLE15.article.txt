# 15 CRACK REDSHIRT TRACKSTERS LEAVE FOR I. C. A. A. A. A.
## Alumni Will Entertain Team In Chicago; to Work Out On Stagg Field 
### 
Coach "Dink" Templeton, Manager
0. 11. Tucker, and fifteen possible
point-getters in the I. C. A. A. A. A.
left Palo Alto at 9:10 this morning on
the first leg of their journey to Bos
ton.
The first stop will be made in Chi
cago on Monday. The Stanford party
will be the guests of the Chicago
Alumni association at a luncheon, and
the trackmen will go through a work
out on Stagg Field.
Eastern dopesters on the whole are
conceding Stanford more than an even
chance to win, and many of them are
giving second place to U. S. C. Prince
ton, Yale, and Penn State are expected
to outscore the Bears.
Five Places Count
Thirty-five points will undoubtedly
win the meet, and the Stanford ag
gregation is capable of that many.
Five places are counted in each event,
with five points being given for first.
Last year California scored 39V6 to 33
for Princeton, the second place win
ner. Other teams leading in the scor
ing were Yale, 23; Pennsylvania,
22Va; Cornell, 15. In all, nineteen dif
ferent universities broke into the
point column.
