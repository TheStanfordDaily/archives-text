# 15 CRACK REDSHIRT TRACKSTERS LEAVE FOR I. C. A. A. A. A.
## Alumni Will Entertain Team In Chicago; to Work Out On Stagg Field 
### 
Coach "Dink" Templeton, Manager
0. 11. Tucker, and fifteen possible
point-getters in the I. C. A. A. A. A.
left Palo Alto at 9:10 this morning on
the first leg of their journey to Bos
ton.
The first stop will be made in Chi
cago on Monday. The Stanford party
will be the guests of the Chicago
Alumni association at a luncheon, and
the trackmen will go through a work
out on Stagg Field.
Eastern dopesters on the whole are
conceding Stanford more than an even
chance to win, and many of them are
giving second place to U. S. C. Prince
ton, Yale, and Penn State are expected
to outscore the Bears.
Five Places Count
Thirty-five points will undoubtedly
win the meet, and the Stanford ag
gregation is capable of that many.
Five places are counted in each event,
with five points being given for first.
Last year California scored 39V6 to 33
for Princeton, the second place win
ner. Other teams leading in the scor
ing were Yale, 23; Pennsylvania,
22Va; Cornell, 15. In all, nineteen dif
ferent universities broke into the
point column.
A complete I. C. A. A. A. A. entry
list lias not been received here, and
so it is not known what teams will
be competing. For the last few years
no team west of Pennsylvania has en
tered other than the two California
aggregations. However, there is a
rumor that lowa is sending a team,
or at least Charlie Brookins, the sen
sational low hurdler. Brookins recent
ly broke the record in this event when
he covered the distance in :23 flat.
Bears Win Three Times
California is the only western team
that has ever won the I. C. A. A. A. A.
in its 48 years of existence. The Bears
took first in 1921, 1922, and 1923. Stan
ford has never come nearer than sec
ond to winning.
The Bears still have a potential
team; although it is by no means as
powerful as in former years. The men
Christie is pinning his hopes on are
Captain Neufeldt, Barber, Becker, Jen
sen, Boren, the Dodson brothers, Fran
cis, Witter, and Upson.
Neufeldt, Becker, Boren, and Witter
all broke into the scoring column last
year. Neufeldt won the discus and
placed in the shot and javelin; Witter
was second in the shot; Boren was
third in the broad; and Becker was
third in the high hurdles.
Weightmen Are Numerous
Against Hills of Princeton, Carpen
ter of Harvard, Hartranft of Stanford,
and Hauser and Anderson of U. S. C.,
the California weight men will be
lucky to get a single point. On the
other hand, the Dodsons and Neufeldt
may be able to get the first three
places in the javelin, Boren may win
the broad jump, and Barber may place
well in the sprints. Becker is likely
to get a place in the hurdles, but Jen
sen will have to do better than 9:45
to place in the two-mile. About the
best that California can hope for is
25 points, with the slim possibility of
scoring five more.
The possibility is Lauren Upson in
the pole vault. He has been improv
ing by leaps and bounds all season,
and barely missed 12 feet 10 in the
P. A. A. meet. If he can get over 12
feet 10< at Cambridge he may win the
event. Owens of Pennsylvania is one
of the best vaulters in the East, con
sistently doing 12 feet 9. Schlopp of
Yale is almost as good, as he has
cleared 12 feet 8. Libby of Dartmouth
and Robuseh of Pittsburgh can clear
12 feet 6, so Upson may be able to
kick through for a win.

Ten of Nevada's most famous and
deserving alumni will be honored this
commencement by having their names
inscribed in the "Book of the Oath"
as the graduates most worthy of dis
tinction.
