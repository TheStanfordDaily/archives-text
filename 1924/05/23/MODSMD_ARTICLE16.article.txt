# 1926 QUAD TO HAVE PHOTO DEPARTMENT AND SALARIED EDITOR
## 
### 
Several changes are to be made in
the editorial department of the 1926
Quad, affecting both the staff and the
j tryoutee system. Chief among these
; will be the eligibility of women for
1 the position of editor, and the installa-
I tion of a new position, that of photo
| graphic editor, who will be chosen
| from a different group of tryoutees
j from either the manager or the editor
! in-chief.
This latter change is expected to
accomplish a dual purpose, lessening
the work of the editorial tryoutees,
; and encoraging men who are inter
ested in photography and have some
experience in that type of work to
tryout.
The tryoutees are to co operate with
the members of the regular staff, in
stead of working separately as in the
j past. In this way, it is expected that
i they will gain a better idea of how
j the work on the Quad is done before
i they are placed on the staff.
There will be four salaried positions
| on the I&2G year-book, instead of two,
|as heretofore. These will be editor,
; manager, women's editor, and photo
graphic editor.
The first meeting of both the edi
torial and managerial tryoutees will
! be held Tuesday, May 27. at 7:15 p.m.,
; in Room 201 in the English building.
; All members of the class of 1927 who
are at all interested iu any branch of
Quad work |\re urged to b« present,
ias the 1 T)2«> editor hopes to have a
I larger ti'youtee staff than ever before.
