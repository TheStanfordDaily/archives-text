# Honor or an "Honor System"
## 
### 
With the advent of spring, come Psychology theses and outside read
ing reports which annually precede a long session of cribbing and rewrit
ing. The tendency to copy predecessors' work is found in most universi
ties, as well as in most grade schools, for that matter, where teachers watch
their pupils during examinations. It is natural for men and women as well
as boys and girls to cheat when cheating is not considered particluarly dis
honorable. By that, we mean that at the present time the man who copies
another's trigonometry problems is not looked down on with marked con
tempt.
Cribbing harms not only the individual but the University as well.
The spirit which prompts a man to show contempt for the ideals of the
University, prompts him also to disregard the traditions and customs of
the student body and let football teams and debating squads go hang.
Other universities have fought for honor systems and found them
satisfactory, while still others, the notable example being the University
of Illinois, have given up the system after a fair trial. The solution to the
present problem does not lie in the adoption of an honor system. The
aim of students and faculty is to instill into all classes of students a love
for honor and a sincere respect for honesty. Such things are personal
and cannot be made effective through a "system." The word "system"
discloses the purpose of the idea —honor by formula instead of by con
viction.
The University of Colorado is as well off without an honor system as
with, provided each student institutes an "honor system" of his own. Per
sonal honor which is, after all, the essence of every "honor system" depends
not on the adoption of a "system" of honor but on campus sentiment.—
