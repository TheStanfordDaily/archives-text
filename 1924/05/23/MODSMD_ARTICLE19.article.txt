# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT

Editor, Daily Palo Alto:
Dear Sir:
In proposing the new amendment to
the A. S. S. U. constitution, we feel
that a word of explanation is needed
as to the reasons therefore, and the
opportunities and disadvantages of
the plan.
In the first place, Stanford Spec
tator took over, when it was formed
two years ago, a deficit of $1440 from
the two magazines of which it was
composed. This deficit, under the pres
ent plan of financing, has never been,
and never can be, paid. During the
past year, Spectator has put out eight
issues under difficulties of financing
which have limited us to an extent
that has been at all times a handicap
to the production of a magazine that
would be truly' representative of the
Stanford student body. At the same j
time, out of the dividends resulting
from this operation under unfavorable j
conditions, Spectator turned over $814 I
to the University in payment of past
debts, contracted by predecessors in i
office, and left unpaid at the expira- i
tion of their terms.
It would seem, prima facie, that if
so much could be accomplished under
such unfavorable conditions, that next;
year Spectator would be able to pay
off much of the $1440 deficit left over
from the Cardinal and Pictorial. Such,
however, is not the case. Sigma Delta
Chi and English Club refuse to handi
cap the magazine to that extent for
the next three years, and in addition
the University is not willing to extend
credit for so long a period on such
contingent chances of getting any
thing from the magazine in the future.
In other words, the final issue is
this: who is goin gto pay that $1440
deficit? If the magazine cannot pay

| it, which is impossible under present
plans of financing, who will? The Uni
versity answers that the A. S. S. U.
treasury will be held responsible.
Which means that, for the next two
or three years, every student activity
on this campus will be handicapped by
this deficit incurred three or four
| years ago by men who have now re
moved from college.
To meet that situation, the new plan
for financing was proposed. That is,
that the Spectator be made a student
body magazine, just as the Daily Palo
Alto is the student body newspaper.
It is to be financed in exactly the
same way: by adding 30 cents a
month, or a total of 90 cents a quar
ter, to the incidental fee. For that
sum every student will receive a copy
of the magazine once a month, which
cuts the cost down from 25 cents, to
ten cents an issue. AND FOR THAT
SUM, SPECTATOR WILL PAY THE
DEFICIT WHICH WOULD OTHER
WISE BE CAST AS A BURDEN ON
THE WHOLE STUDENT BODY.
In other words, to pass the amend
ment will provide for a student body
magazine that cannot be equalled in
any other university on the Pacific
Coast; it will open the door to expan
sion of this field of Stanford activity
under the supervision of the student
body, and will at the same time re
lieve the student body of a millstone
which will drag down all activities for
three years.
For the A. S. S. U. treasury could
not handle that deficit in much less
time than that. Giving of dances,
plays, and nil that sort of thing to
wear down an old debt has been more
or less blown up as a J. Rufus Wal
lingford method of financing.
Those who oppose the plan seem to
do so on the ground that adding to
the incidental fee is a dangerous busi- J

ness, and a bad precedent.
President Wilbur has given his con
sent to adding the charge, if the
amendment passes. In addition, adding
to the incidental fee is not liable to
start a wild rush from every organiza
tion on the campus to add their par
ticular burdens to the already heavy
tuition. If that were so, then there
would have been innumerable at
tempts when the Daily Palo Alto was
added to the incidental fee; but there
was 110 such attempt made until three
years ago, when the students volun
tarily assumed the burden of paying
for the Basketball pavilion.
Because, then, we feel that Stan
ford needs a truly representative
magazine; and because we know that
we can, with this new method of
financing, pay off for the student body
a deficit which could not be paid by
the student body itself within a rea
sonable period, we feel confident in
presenting this amendment for the
consideration of the student body at
the next election.
Sincerely,
PUBLICATION COMMITTEE,
STANFORD SPECTATOR.
Henry Mack, Chairman.
