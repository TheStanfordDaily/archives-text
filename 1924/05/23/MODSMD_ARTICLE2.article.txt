# TWELVE CANDIDATES RUN FOR OFFICE IN ELECTION TUESDAY
## 
### 
Twelve candidates will compete for
office again next Tuesday in the re
election, and another amendment will |
be placed before the students for a
decision.
The race for president, which re-|
suited in a two-point margin in the
vote last Tuesday, has been resumed,
and "Chuck" Beardsley and George l
Uaker will marshall all of their forces
for the second try.
Robert Lewis and H. G. Symonds
will run for the fifth place on the
Men's Council.
None of the three candidates for \
the 1925 woman representative to the
Executive Committee received a ma
jority of the votes in the first elec-1
tion. Elizabeth Simmons and Alice!
Dodds will run again.
The votes cast for vice-president of
the class of 1925 consisted largely of,
write-ins. Of these, the largest num
ber went to two candidates, Sarah!
Meskimmons and Ellen Callender,
whose names will appear on the ballot j
Tuesday.
The class of 1926 will vote for secre
tay, Susan Hyde and Harriot Oliver
being the candidates. Karl Doerr and
Sydney Meeks received the highest
number of votes for president of the |
<lass of 1927, and the fight will be
between them.
Ordinarily, a re-election brings out j
only a light vote, but owing to the
closeness of the race for president,;
the vote may nearly equal that of the
general election.
