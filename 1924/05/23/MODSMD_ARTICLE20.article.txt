Editor Daily Palo Alto:
It is altogether too evident that the
Spectator, in its desire to be under
the A. S. S. U. and forcing a general
assessment on the student body, has
a purely selfish objective.
The Pictorial and the Cardinal failed
because of poor financial management.
The Spectator in combining these two
publications took over the debts that
caused the liquidation. The Spectator
in its effort to be under the wing of
the A. S. S. U. hopes to find in the
funds of the Associated Students an
easy means of wiping this debt from
their records. The Spectator has been
far from a failure this year, but it is
apparently in too great a hurry to
make itself one hundred per cent
popular. It does not want a slow
steady growth, but merely aims at
jumping to fame through force.
No magazine can reach perfection
in one year. The writer wonders at
the reason for its instigating such an
amendment as is to be voted on Tues
day when there is no desire whatever
to place the Spectator in the hands of
every student to educate an apprecia
tion of literature or the arts, but
merely a desire to find a reservoir for
bad debts assumed now and in the
future.
If the Spectator is getting on its feet
it should not ask the student body to
control it, if it is not getting on its
feet it is because it is not wanted.
