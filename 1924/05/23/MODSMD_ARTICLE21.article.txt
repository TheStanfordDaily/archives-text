# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT
## 
### 
Editor of the Daily Palo Alto:
Dear Sir: (
In quoting my letter to Mr. Masters
relating to the election on Tuesday
the article appearing in Wednesday
night's issue of the Daily Palo Alto
omitted a very important paragraph
which is as follows:
1. In my opinion the entire elec
tion is void. Your Constitution ex
plicitly provides in Article 11,
Section 1, that "regular elections
for all association and class of
ficers shall be held on the last
Tuesday in May . . The Execu
tive Committee has no power to
vary the terms of this provision.
Inasmuch as the last Tuesday in
May occurs on the 27th, the elec
tion on the 20th is clearly invalid.
It seems to me that the student
body is entitled to the above informa
tion.
Very truly yours,
M. R. KIRKWOOD.
