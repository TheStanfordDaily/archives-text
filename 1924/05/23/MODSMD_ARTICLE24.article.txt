# Horse Show Eliminations To Be Run Off Tomorrow
## 
### 
Eliminations for the events in the
R. O. T. C.'s fourth annual horse show
that will take place on May 31 will be
held tomorrow morning at the Bncina
Polo Field. These are mjftie necessary
because more than twenty men have
entered in some of the races. The
steeplechase and the half mile run
have received the largest number of
entries to date.
As a special prize the military de
partment is offering a perpetual
trophy, a silver cup, for the best rider.
If the cup is won by the same man
three times it will be awarded to him
permanently. The horsemanship of
each rider will be determined by his
ability to walk, trot, gallop, and hurdle
his horse. The strongest contestants'
for the cup are Egbert Laub, Roland
Reticker, Harold Hjelm, Andrew
Boone, Court Kinnison, and Robert
Chamberlain.
