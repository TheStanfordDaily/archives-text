of a firm advertising as its wares pre

adapted to the demands of students.
"Let us do your thinking for you.
Give us your subject and $10i â€”we'll do
the rest.
"We relieve you of all annoying de
tails," reads the pamphlet. "Just tell
us the subject, the length of the
article required, and the credit is re
ceived for it. Our work is satisfactory.
Many professors have complimented
our clients on the masterly way in
which they write. We intend no in

probably receive better recognition
than your own."
