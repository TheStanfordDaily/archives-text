"Unusual artistic make-up charac
terizes the 1925 Quad," says John T.
Lemos, director of the Stanford Art
Gallery. "The most noticeable differ
ence is in the size of the pages, which
allows for the wide margin necessary
to set off the book.
"Exceptionally fine printing and the
high quality of paper used are assets,
but the biggest thing is the general
unit. This unity has been emphasized
by the Romanesque type of border
panels throughout the book. These
panel designs are especially appro
priate as they are adapted from the
same style of ornament as is seen in
the architectural motifs of the build
ings on Quad. With this a type of
Roman lettering is used in the title'
pages and headings.
History of California
"One of the main features is the
series of five color pages depicting
scenes in early California history.
These are progressive in character
and have been painted in rich colors.
Inasmuch as Stanford University and
its founders were closely related to

California history, this makes an ap
propriate idea on which to base the
theme of the annual. Since the color
pages are well printed they have re
tained all the charm of the original
painting.
"The color pages are produced from
engravings that are made by what is
known as the 'color process.' In this
process, the original painting is
placed before the camera, and photo
graphed through color filters. The
color filters separate the various col
ors in the picture into yellow, red,
blue, and black negatives. The nega
tives are in turn printed on metal and
engraved.
Superimposing Colors
Prom these engravings the picture
is produced by printing the yellow,
red, blue and black engravings over
one another. By superimposing these
four colors all the hues in the rain
bow are obtainable. Looking at any
of the color prints through a micro
scope will disclose the fact that they
are made up of combinations of yel
low, red, blue, or black dofs."
