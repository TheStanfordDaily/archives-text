# YOUNG DOCTOR FINDS CURE FOR JEALOUSY IN "THE BOOMERANG"
## 
### 
Lovers suffering from pangs of jeal
ousy will find the needed heart's ease
in "The Boomerang," the 1924 Senior
Farce. Hal Bumbaugh, flaying the
leading role as the young doctor just
returned from study at Edinborough,
after a hard time struggling with his
profession, discovers a cure that works
and his fortune is made.
Carol Botsford, as the young and
beautiful Virginia Xelva, is the main
reason for the doctor's burst into
prominence since she furnishes him
with most of his patients. In the sud
den success of this treatment upon
others and its later failure to function
properly when the doctor himself falls
victim to Virginia's heart-smashing
tactics, lies most of the humor of the
show.
Miss Botsford is new to dramatics
at Stanford. She transferred from Cali
fornia last year where she had quite
a bit of stage experience under the
direction of Sam Hume and Irving
Pichel.
Bumbaugh is an old figure on the
Assembly hall platform and at the
present time is also cast as the lead
ing heavy in the photoplay of Stanford
life now being filmed. Between the!
two of them many interesting and 1
amusing situations occur as they de
velop the latest discovery in medical
scienceâ€”relief for two-timed sweet
hearts.
