# INTERCLASS ATHLETIC CHAMPIONSHIP WON BY SENIORS
## 
### 
Although the class of '24 won first
places in only track and tennis, it
was able to win the Interclass Ath
letics championship, thereby earning
the honor of having its numerals in
scribed upon the Interclass perpetual
trophy.
The sophomores were second with
twenty-one points while the frosh fin
ished with eighteen and the juniors
fifteen. The class of '27 was a strong
contender for first honors until the
last two activities when it forfeited
soccer and took fourth place in tennis.
Purchased a year ago by the Senior
class of 1923 with the aid of the Board
of Athletic Control, the cup is now to
be awarded for the second time. Last
year the class of '23 won the cup
with ease and had the honor of being
the first class to have its numerals
inscribed. The seniors at the time
were able to take five first places in
interclass athletics out of a possible
seven and were hardly pressed by the
freshmen, their nearest competitors.
