# PRESENT DAY STUDENTS ARE STANDARDIZED--HULME
## Less Eagerness and Originality Are Shown Now Than Twenty-Fine Years Ago 
### Esther Greenacre 
Stanford students of today are less
eager and original, more standardized,
than the student twenty-five years ago,
In the opinion of Edward Hulme, asso
ciate professor in history.
Professor Hulme was one of the
Stanford pioneer students, a member
of the class of '97. Among those at
tending the University when he was
here were Herbert Hoover, Charles
Field, and Will Irwin.
"Students of today are more sated
with pleasure and experience than
they were when I went to college,"
said Hulme. "Owing to the changes

in school and society, they are move J
standardized.
Two Questions
"There are two questions to be con
sidered in pointing out changes in the
character and customs of the Stanford '
man. Changes in the customs of the
students are easier to perceive and
understand; while changes in charac
ter are often slight or subtle, espe
cially when they find no striking out
ward expression."
Hulme stated that he sees many
changes in customs at college due to
the changes in society. The invention
. I
and widespread use of the automobile
with the consequent extension of good
roads, the moving picture, rag time,
and jazz are all developments of the
last quarter century; they have given
new interests and tastes, therefore
new customs, to the students, whose
range of experience and information
has been greatly extended.
Student Taste Less Fine
"I am inclined to think that the stu
dents' tastes have become less fine,"
continuel Hulme. "The concerts and
recitals, of which there are altogether
too few at Stanford, seldom attract
more than a handful of students, and
they would fail of an adequate audi
ence were it not for the families of
the faculty and residents of nearby
towns. I remember the days when a
fine soprano, a notable violinist, or a
good lecturer used to fill our audi
torium with students. Life is not now
confined to the campus as it used to
be. Students seek amusement in the
nearby movies, at frequent dances, and
in San Francisco. They have too many
other activities to attend to now.
"The waltz, the most attractive of
dances, is forgotten, and in its place
students indulge in ugly contortions.
Then, too, where in the student publi
cations of today is to be found such
poetry as that written by Sarah Com
stock, William Neidig, and the two
Irwins?"
Effect of War
Professor Hulme emphasized the
fact that in considering these ques
tions, one should not forget the Great
War. The immense social dislocations
caused by the war and their effect in
beliefs and programs of life are ap
parent in the customs and character
of college students.
Hulme says that he finds little dif
ference between the democratic atti
tude on the campus today and that of
twenty-five years ago. "There are as
many, if not more, students working
their way through college now than
there were then in proportion to the
size of the student body. Increased
wealth among many of those at Stan
ford has created more work for the
poorer individual. The excessive pa
tronage of ice cream parlors has ne
cessitated more waiters. Numerous
orchestras supply work for the musi
cal."
In discussing college spirit, Hulme
commented upon the fact that yelling
in his day was more spontaneous, less
mechanical, and that it was directed
towards the team rather than toward
the bleachers of the opposition. He
characterized the yelling of today as
lackadaisical and wanting in enthusi
asm.

they were when I went to college,"
said Hulme. "Owing to the changes

in school and society, they are move J
standardized.
Two Questions
"There are two questions to be con
sidered in pointing out changes in the
character and customs of the Stanford '
man. Changes in the customs of the
students are easier to perceive and
understand; while changes in charac
ter are often slight or subtle, espe
cially when they find no striking out
ward expression."
Hulme stated that he sees many
changes in customs at college due to
the changes in society. The invention
. I
and widespread use of the automobile
with the consequent extension of good
roads, the moving picture, rag time,
and jazz are all developments of the
last quarter century; they have given
new interests and tastes, therefore
new customs, to the students, whose
range of experience and information
has been greatly extended.
Student Taste Less Fine
"I am inclined to think that the stu
dents' tastes have become less fine,"
continuel Hulme. "The concerts and
recitals, of which there are altogether
too few at Stanford, seldom attract
more than a handful of students, and
they would fail of an adequate audi
ence were it not for the families of
the faculty and residents of nearby
towns. I remember the days when a
fine soprano, a notable violinist, or a
good lecturer used to fill our audi
torium with students. Life is not now
confined to the campus as it used to
be. Students seek amusement in the
nearby movies, at frequent dances, and
in San Francisco. They have too many
other activities to attend to now.
"The waltz, the most attractive of
dances, is forgotten, and in its place
students indulge in ugly contortions.
Then, too, where in the student publi
cations of today is to be found such
poetry as that written by Sarah Com
stock, William Neidig, and the two
Irwins?"
Effect of War
Professor Hulme emphasized the
fact that in considering these ques
tions, one should not forget the Great
War. The immense social dislocations
caused by the war and their effect in
beliefs and programs of life are ap
parent in the customs and character
of college students.
Hulme says that he finds little dif
ference between the democratic atti
tude on the campus today and that of
twenty-five years ago. "There are as
many, if not more, students working
their way through college now than
there were then in proportion to the
size of the student body. Increased
wealth among many of those at Stan
ford has created more work for the
poorer individual. The excessive pa
tronage of ice cream parlors has ne
cessitated more waiters. Numerous
orchestras supply work for the musi
cal."
In discussing college spirit, Hulme
commented upon the fact that yelling
in his day was more spontaneous, less
mechanical, and that it was directed
towards the team rather than toward
the bleachers of the opposition. He
characterized the yelling of today as
lackadaisical and wanting in enthusi
asm.
Stanford students of today are less
eager and original, more standardized,
than the student twenty-five years ago,
In the opinion of Edward Hulme, asso
ciate professor in history.
Professor Hulme was one of the
Stanford pioneer students, a member
of the class of '97. Among those at
tending the University when he was
here were Herbert Hoover, Charles
Field, and Will Irwin.
"Students of today are more sated
with pleasure and experience than
they were when I went to college,"
said Hulme. "Owing to the changes
