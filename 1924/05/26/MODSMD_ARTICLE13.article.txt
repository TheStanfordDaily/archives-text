j Page Sinorlock Holmes, or a geome-
I try shark, or any one else who can
solve mysteries. The case this time
i has nothing to do with a bloody mur-
I tier, or a divorce scandal, but a kid-
I napped floor lamp.
For some time this floor lamp had
i been part of the useful furnishings in
the lobby of Kingscote apartments.
Then one morning, when the sun came
up he found his ONLY RIVAL, which
had been covered by a rose colored
shade, was missing from the lobby.
Finger print experts, the Ouija board,
! and fortune tellers failed to locate the
I vanished piece of furniture.
But Father Time, though he may be
J slow, is at least sure, and recently the
I old man brought back the intriguing
lamp, and placed it in the lobby in its
usual place, leaving it quite as rosy
as ever.
The Daily Palo Alto will not conduct
a guessing contest for the solution of
this mystery.
