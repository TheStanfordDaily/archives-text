# TWO NEW TIMES SEE IN OLYMPIC AQUATIC TRIALS
## Hawaiian Swimmers Hang Up Records in Back and Breast Strokes 
### Alfred Post 
One Olympic Games record and one
national time went by the boards in
the far western swimming and diving
tryouts for the 1924 Olympiad held
yesterday at Searsville lake.
Warren Kealoha of the Hawaiian
Islands bettered his own time in the
100-meter back stroke when he ne
gotiated the distance in 1:12 1-5.
Swimming against time, Kirsclibaum
of Honolulu established a new nation
al record in the 200-meter breast
stroke when he was clocked at 3:00 2-5.
The former record was 3:03 1-5, held
by Charlie Fletcher of Stanford.
Eleanor O'Brien, swimming for the
Idora Athletic Club, fell short by four
seconds of tying the best women's
time in the 200-meter breast stroke.
She was the sole entrant in her event,
and was paced by* two other members
of the Idora Club.
White Takes Three Firsts
A1 White, Clarita Hunsberger, and
Carl Stevenson were the only Stan
ford entries. White romped away with
firsts in all three types of diving—
high and low springboard, high va
riety, and high plain.
Miss Hunsberger was the sole en
trant in the women's high plain div
ing, and showed herself a performer
of the first rank. Owing to the fact
that the 1500-meter swim was not
held, Carl Stevenson was unable to
compete in the event he was doped
to win. He entered the 400-meter free
style, but failed to place in competi
tion with the more experienced
Hawaiian paddlers.
Lester Smith of the Olympic Club
won the only swimming event held
Saturday, the 200-meter free style. In
the high and low springboard diving
held on the same day, A1 White car
ried oft' the honors.
Back Stroke Close
Sam Kahanamoku captured first
place in the 100-meter free style after
a close struggle with Pua Kealoha and
Robertson of the Olympic Club.
The 100-meter back stroke, in which
Warren Kealoha hung up a new mark,
was the most exciting race of the day.
It appeared as though Lunning, an
other Hawaiian, was tied with the
winner at the finish after keeping
even with him all the way, but the
judges gave the decision to Kealoha.
Clarence Pinkston, wearing a
Winged "O" suit, pressed A1 White
closely in the high variety diving,
amassing a total only four points be
low that of the Stanford man. White
had little trouble in capturing his
third first in the high plain diving.
Smith Wins Twice
Lester Smith annexed his second
win of the two days' competition when
he completed the 400-meter free style
nearly thirty yards ahead of Pua
Kealoha and Sam Kahanamoku, who
tied for second.
With the exception of the 200-meter
breast stroke the 100-meter free style
was the only women's event held.
Adrian Gibson took first place.
