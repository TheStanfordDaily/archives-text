Stanford students are to be called upon tomorrow to vote upon a very
important amendment to the constitution. They will decide whether or
not they will assess themselves each thirty cents a quarter to help pay the
debts and defray the expenses of the Spectator. If the amendment should
pass, each student would in return receive a copy of the magazine every
month.
The Daily Palo believes that the students should vote against the pro
posed idea, for two reasons. First, because in adding an item to. the inci
dental fee, they are setting a dangerous precedent, and, second, because 110
students should be compelled to subscribe for a magazine which they do
not want.
As to the first reason. If the Spectator is made a student body publi
cation by the proposed amendment, what is to prevent Chaparral from
asking for and rightfully expecting such a concession? What is to pre
vent the Quad from becoming a student body publication? What right
would the students have to turn down tlie last two named publications if
they passed on the Spectator? Supporters of the proposed amendment
say that the Chaparral and the Quad will not make any attempt to change
their systems. Granted that it is improbable but it is not impossible and
if they should make such a move, they would be entitled to equal consider
ation with the Spectator.
Those who are advocating the amendment compare the Spectator with
the Daily Palo Alto. TheÂ£e two publications can scarcely be compared on
such a basis. The Daily fills a need on the campus. It keeps the students
informed as to what is going 011 from day to day. While a periodical is
highly desirable at any University, it does not have the practical value of
the daily nor does it fill the needs of the student body as does the daily
paper.
As to the second reason the Daily Palo Alto advances for being opposed
to the amendment. Forcing students to subscribe for a magazine strikes a
dangerous note. Such a procedure falls too closely in line with the gen
eral tendency here at Stanford. Every time a student walks up to a win
dow or makes up his mind to go anywhere about the campus, he may rest
assured that it will cost him some money. We are getting too far away
from the "would you like to have this" stage, in many cases, and adopting
the "here it is, it's yours, it costs you so much, pay now" attitude. That
is wrong, and the students should express their opinions 011 the situation
very decidedly tomorrow.
The circulation of the Spectator in the past few months, indicates that
rather less than a third of the students care enough about such a magazine
to buy it. Why should the other two-thirds be forced to subscribe for the
publication at any price? Under the proposed system, the cost of the
paper, to each student, would be ten cents, which, the Daily Palo Alto be
lieves, would be a very fair figure if subscriptions were not compulsory.
In spite of all arguments on both sides, the old Pictorial-Cardinal debt
hangs over Spectator. Should the amendment be defeated, this debt would
undoubtedly revert to the A. S. S. U. treasury. As undesirable as this
seems, the Daily believes that it would be better than to assess the indi
vidual students thirty cents a quarter. In its communication published in
these columns last Friday, the Spectator Publication Committee said that
such a debt would drag down other activities here for the next three years.
The Daily Palo Alto believes that this statement is an exaggeration. With
the Graduate Manager established as Student Manager next year, the
debt would be taken care of in a comparatively short space of time.
The Daily believes that there is a place for a periodical at Stanford but
it also believes that such a periodical should not be published as an A. S.
S. U. project.
