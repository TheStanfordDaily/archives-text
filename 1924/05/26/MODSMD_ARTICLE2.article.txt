### 
"The Theory of Evolution from
Goethe to Einstein" is the subject
chosen for discussion by Dr. John Mez,
writer and lecturer on international
affairs, in his talk in the Little Thea
tre at 7:30 Wednesday night.
Although Germany had no delegates
at the Limitation of Armaments Con
ference, D. Mez, who was there in the
capacity of correspondent of the
"Frankfurter Zeitung," interested
everybody, was received by the Presi
dent, and was asked to speak at vari
ous colleges.
Has Liberal Ideas
He brings with him impressions of
the situation as it is seen by a liberal
and democrat. In making a tour as
secretary with David Starr Jordan
when Dr. Jordan was on a mission of
peace for the International Concilia
tion movement, he was soon asked to
do part of the talking. In London, at
the home of Herbert Hoover, he spoke
on the "International Students Move.-
ment."
In 1913, after having gone as or
ganizer and interpreter with Norman
Angell in his tour of Germany in the
interest of peace between England
and Germany, he came to America.
Had Peace Plans
At the International Congress of
Students held at Ithaca, New York,
under the auspices of Cornell Univer
sity, Dr. Mez was elected president of
the organization.
