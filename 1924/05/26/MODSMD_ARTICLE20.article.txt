# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT

### 
I Editor of the Daily Palo Alto:
Dear Sir:
The argument that the SPECTATOR
uses in its effort to win the confidence
of the Student Body in tomorrow's
election is an absolute fallacy.
The SPECTATOR has a debt of
$1400 and they say that unless the
amendment passes, the A. S. S. U. will
have to pay it much in the same way
as they are now meeting the deficit
on the basketball pavilion. We grant
them so much is true, but here is
where the SPECTATOR is trying to
lift itself by the bootstraps, for they
claim that if every student is assessed
thirty cents a quarter, that the A. S.
S. U. will not have to pay the debt.
Anyone that is not blind can see that
it makes no difference whether a
check is made out by the Student
Manager of the A. S. S. U. covering
the debt, or whether the Registrar
takes it from our pockets in driblets
of thity cents. We all belong to the
Associated Students and no matter
how the money is raised we will all
get stung for the deficit. BUT IT IS
BETTER TO HAVE THE STUDENT
MANAGER HAND OVER ONE CHECK
FOR THE AMOUNT NEEDED THAT
WILL END THE WHOLE QUESTION
FOR GOOD AND ALL, THAN IT IS
TO PASS AN AMENDMENT THAT
WILL MAKE THE STUDENTS AT
STANFORD PAY SUCH A DEBT
MANY TIMES OVER, AND A DRAIN
THAT WILL CONTINUE UNTIL
TIME IMMEMORIAL.
