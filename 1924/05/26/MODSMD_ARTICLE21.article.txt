# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT

### 
It is worthy of note in connection with
the following comment, that no such
system for choosing editors and man
agers of the Spectator has been devised.
Editor Daily Palo Alto.
Dear Sir: I believe that if the Student
Body is going to put up the money to
publish the SPECTATOR, they should
have some control over the appointment
of managers and editors. No matter
whether the Student body as a whole
believes in subsidizing the magazine or
not, it should take into consideration the
fact that the amendment in its present
form places all finances in the hands of
a body that is now carrying a debt of
several thousand dollars from its former
publications. In order to be fair, some
sort of tryoutee system should be initi
ated for selection of editor, and the man
ager should be appointed by the Associ
ated Students through the Executive
Committee. These points should be
taken into consideration before any de
cisive action is taken in regard to the
project.

Editor Daily Palo Alto:
In Friday's Daily, "OBSERVER"
stated that he felt that SPECTATOR
had a selfish motive in its attempt to
have the publication taken over by
the student-body. In this I heartily
Disagree. There is a very vital place
in this student-body for a magazine
of the caliber and type of SPECTA
TOR. Chaparral perfectly covers its
field of college wit and humor, and it
has reflected much credit on its edi
tors and the Stanford student-body.
On the more serious side there is
also need for some representative
magazine. SPECTATOR had covered
this field admirably during the past
year, and now that it asks the support
of the student-body there are some
who raise their hands in horror at the
suggestion. The SPECTATOR was
born with a legacy of a $1440 debt
that was left it by the old Cardinal
and Pictorial. It has done nobly to pay
off as much of this debt as it has. The
magazine has been handicapped by a
lack of funds during the past year,
but has made a creditable showing in
spite of that. If it is given the support
of the student-body it will not only
pay the rebts that it inherited from
its two predecessors, but will make a
showing that will reflect nothing but
credit upon Stanford. If the debt in
curred by Cardinal and Pictorial is
paid out of student organization funds
there will be nothing but receipts to
show for the payment. However, if
Spectator is given a subsidy with
which to work, it will not only pay the
deficit, but will give the student-body
a worth-while magazine of student
opinion. The amount that would be
added to the incidental fees is negli
gible. Thirty cents a quarter would not
be a hardship to any one, and it is
an investment in a Stanford activity,
and gives a material return. It is NOT
a charitable contribution.
Sincerely,
"AN ONLOOKER."

Editor Daily Palo Alto:
In Friday's Daily, "OBSERVER"
stated that he felt that SPECTATOR
had a selfish motive in its attempt to
have the publication taken over by
the student-body. In this I heartily
Disagree. There is a very vital place
in this student-body for a magazine
of the caliber and type of SPECTA
TOR. Chaparral perfectly covers its
field of college wit and humor, and it
has reflected much credit on its edi
tors and the Stanford student-body.
On the more serious side there is
also need for some representative
magazine. SPECTATOR had covered
this field admirably during the past
year, and now that it asks the support
of the student-body there are some
who raise their hands in horror at the
suggestion. The SPECTATOR was
born with a legacy of a $1440 debt
that was left it by the old Cardinal
and Pictorial. It has done nobly to pay
off as much of this debt as it has. The
magazine has been handicapped by a
lack of funds during the past year,
but has made a creditable showing in
spite of that. If it is given the support
of the student-body it will not only
pay the rebts that it inherited from
its two predecessors, but will make a
showing that will reflect nothing but
credit upon Stanford. If the debt in
curred by Cardinal and Pictorial is
paid out of student organization funds
there will be nothing but receipts to
show for the payment. However, if
Spectator is given a subsidy with
which to work, it will not only pay the
deficit, but will give the student-body
a worth-while magazine of student
opinion. The amount that would be
added to the incidental fees is negli
gible. Thirty cents a quarter would not
be a hardship to any one, and it is
an investment in a Stanford activity,
and gives a material return. It is NOT
a charitable contribution.
Sincerely,
"AN ONLOOKER."
It is worthy of note in connection with
the following comment, that no such
system for choosing editors and man
agers of the Spectator has been devised.
Editor Daily Palo Alto.
Dear Sir: I believe that if the Student
Body is going to put up the money to
publish the SPECTATOR, they should
have some control over the appointment
of managers and editors. No matter
whether the Student body as a whole
believes in subsidizing the magazine or
not, it should take into consideration the
fact that the amendment in its present
form places all finances in the hands of
a body that is now carrying a debt of
several thousand dollars from its former
publications. In order to be fair, some
sort of tryoutee system should be initi
ated for selection of editor, and the man
ager should be appointed by the Associ
ated Students through the Executive
Committee. These points should be
taken into consideration before any de
