# "LABOR DAY" AT ARIZONA GIVES REST FROM STUDIES
## 
### 
Recently the University of Arizona
students set aside a day from the
regular cares of academic life, and
designated it "Labor Day." On that
day the track was recindered, the
fences were repainted, a handball
court was built for the faculty, and
an outdoor theatre prepared for the
women.
