### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Dempsey once said, in comparing Carpentier and Gibbons, that they were
both equal in technical skill, but that the Frenchman was the harder hitter.
"Carpentier," to quote Jack, "is all nervous force —Gibbons depends on physi
cal strength."
It is not only in skill that these two fighters are comparable, either, for both
hav had years of experiences. Georges is 30 and has been fighting for 17
years, while Tommy is 35 and has been in the game for 11 years—and both
are clean, courageous fighters. Also, both will be fighting for wife and chil
dren, as well as country, glory, and, oh yes, money.
Gibbons' supporters will not be able to see how their man, who stood off
Dempsey for 15 rounds, and who has never been knocked out, can possibly
lose to a man who Avas knocked out by Jack in 4 rounds and by Siki in G
rounds.
Carpentier's friends will tell you that he is as good as ever, that Gibbons
will not have a chance to treat.Georges' midsection the way Dempsey did, and
that the long range fighting and flashing right hand of the Pride of France
will lay low the popular American.
