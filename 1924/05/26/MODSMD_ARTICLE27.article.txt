# No. 2. THE COUNCIL
## 
### 
"If the Council fails it is the opinion
of the present Prime Minister of Great
Britain that nothing but time stands
between Europe and a war far more
terrible than the last world conflict,"
says Professor Ralph Lutz of the His
tory department.
Of the primary bodies of the League
of Nations, the Council is the smallest,
membership being made up of the
four Great Powers —France, Great
Britain, Italy, and Japan—and six
smaller powers. The great powers are
permanently represented by one dele
gate each, while the Assembly, by ma
joritey vote, elects six additional mem
bers yearly. It meets every two
months, and is to a great extent the
executive and initiatory organ of the
League.
Any member of the League not re
presented on the Council may send a
representative to sit on the Council at
any meeting during consideration of
matters especially affecting its inter
ests.
Officers of the Council are not
elected, but representatives preside in
rotation. If the Council does not meet
at Geneva, the representative of the
state 011 whose territory the session
is held usually presides.
The League Council is empowered
to deal with any matter "within
the sphere of action of the League or
affecting the peace of the world," and
in addition has certain specified pow
ers. In any threat of war brought to
the notice of the League, the Council
is to meet and recommend action. Un
less a member of the League specifi
cally prefers the Assembly, the Coun
cil is the organ designated to inquire
or arbitrate in cases of international
disputes involving a member of the
League. It is also the Council which
supervises the working of the man
dates system, the administrative and
advisory commissions, and the techni
cal organizations.
'•Criticisms of ; the character, or

ganization, membership, powers, poli
cies, and accomplishments of the
Council of the League of Nations indi
cate the difficulties which have con
fronted that primary body of the
league in its almost superhuman task
of maintaining even European peace,"
says Professor Lutz. "Critics of the
Council in the recent enemy states
have regarded it as a trust of the vic
tors, and a league of governments not
peoples, which excluded Germany, a
great power, from its organization.
The Third Internationale voiced the
opposition of Soviet Russia to this
bourgeois super-state organ of capital
istic power.
"Diplomatic actions of the Confer
ences of Allied Prime Ministers and
the Conferences of Ambassadors have
been cited as proof of the inherent
weakness of the Council. It has been
accused of shirking its responsibility
when it failed to check French im
perialism upon the occupation of the
Ruhr and Italian imperialism upon the
bombardment of Carfu. Although the
great war proved the failure of com
binations of powers based on the
theory of the balance ef power to pre
serve peace, the post war political
alignments indicate clearly that cer
tain European states of the Entente
are forming war alliances against Ger
many and Russia.
Imperialism Is State of Mind
"Confronting the Council is an al
most universal European desire for
economic, strategic, and general terri
torial expansion and objection to the
stifling restrictions of national boun
daries. America is too becoming more
and more aware that imperialism is
not an obsession of any one people
but a general state of mind. Hence
the policies of the Council toward the
land armaments of Europe, which of
course have been influenced by the
Anglo-French difficulties, have been
severely criticized."
Tomorrow—"The Secretariat."

The League Council is empowered
to deal with any matter "within

in addition has certain specified pow

the notice of the League, the Council
is to meet and recommend action. Un

Ruhr and Italian imperialism upon the
bombardment of Carfu. Although the

Imperialism Is State of Mind
"Confronting the Council is an al
most universal European desire for
economic, strategic, and general terri
torial expansion and objection to the
stifling restrictions of national boun
daries. America is too becoming more
and more aware that imperialism is
not an obsession of any one people
