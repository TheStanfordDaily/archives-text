## 
### 
Fire Chief Dugan has put out an
appeal to the residents on the campus
for co-operation on the Fire Preven
tion Week which starts today. All the
closets, basements, and attics of the
houses and dormitories should be
cleaned out immediately. University
teams will call for the rubbish and
haul it away free of charge. The cam
pus is very dry and a fire starting
now would spread rapidly.
Another preventive step that the
department is taking this year is the
prohibition of all open fires on this
campus during the summer.
The women of University of Oregon
hold nightly dances between 6:30 and
7:30 o'clock. There are but two re
quirements: each man must pay a
dime every evening he dances ,and
the guests must leave promptly.
