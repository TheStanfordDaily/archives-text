"Lefty" May's Beginning
Earl May's former occupation was
largely a matter of catching diuanal
lepidopterous insects for a botany pro
fessor. In other fords, he had to col
lect butterfly specimens for a bug nut.
This professor was not a bit par
ticular about the rarity of the butter
flies although he had a marked pre
ference for the marked varities. Earl
May got left-handed chasing after so
many specimens with a butterfly net
while using his right for extracting
the creatures.
He developed such a keen eye and
such a fast pair of legs that if the
faintest speck in the sky was seen
he could tell whether it was a hawk,
a bird, a bug, or a butterfly. If the
latter he could chase after it through
any kind of country, and 110 matter
where it eventually parked, even 011
top of the tallest flagpole, he knew
how to get it.
He could swing the handle of that
net from any angle. High chasers
were his specialty, but he could also
dip from angles below his toes.
The botany professor had eight
boys in his family and one day de
cided to add Lefty May to the group
to make up a ball team. Lefty played
outfield for that group, never missed
a fly, and never was fanned out at
bat.
