# TREE SURGEONS MAKE OPERATIONS ON OAKS
## 
### 
Tree surgeons are performing major
operations daily in an effort to save
the life of the California live oak
tree in front of the Library.
The case is of a rather serious
nature, for the tree is suffering from
fungus infection of which there are
fou kinds, known as Brown Root, Sap
Root, Bark Root, and White Heart
Root Fungus.
Under the direction of M. J. Lind, a
graduate of the Norwegian Forestry
School and the Davey Tree Institute
the men are using the following meth
od of procedure.
First, the infected wood is cut away
and the cavity carefully disinfected
and water-proofed with heavy tar.
Then an airtight, flexible filling, made
from a special formula consisting of
ground cork, sand and a waterproof
cement is put in the cavity in section
al formation. Each layer is separated
by a layer of paraffins, to keep the
inside free from moisture and re
infection.
If the work is carefully done the
new bark will, in a vrey short time,
start to roll over the edges of the
cavity and form a complete sealing.
