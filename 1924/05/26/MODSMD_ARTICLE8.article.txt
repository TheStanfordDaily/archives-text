# STANFORD TEAM IS CHICAGO ALUMNI GUEST TODAY
## Redshirts to Go Against Stiff Competition in Eastern Track Meet 
### 
The Stanford tracksters arc in Chi
cago today, where they arc the guests of
the Windy City Alumni .Association.
The team will reach Boston Wednes
day, giving the members two days before
the 1.C.A.A.A.A., which is Friday and
Saturday. The second team will not
leave for Eugene, Oregon until Wednes
day.
One of the fastest races of the meet
should be in the mile run between Kirby
of Cornell, Douglas of Yale, and Kerr
of Stanford. Kirby was the fastest
miler in the East last year, taking first in
the I.C.A.A.A.A. in the remarkable time
of 4:174-5. Douglas placed third in the
same event.
However, Kirby has been ill this year,
and is not in the best of shape at the
present time. He was unable to run in
several of the meets, and on one occasion
was beaten by Douglas in a tri-school
contest. Kerr should be able to get
down to 4:20 Saturday, and this time
should put him right up among the
leaders. Some of the other milers who
are expected to give a good account of
themselves arc Cavanaugh of Boston,
Betts of Princeton, Enck of Penn State,
Smith of Stanford, and Walters of Har
vard.
Kirby should win in about 4:18. Doug
las has done 4:20 this year, while the
best Walters and Cavanaugh have done
is 4:23 and 4:24, respectively. From
these comparative times it will be seen
that Kerr should be able to get into a
third place if he is in shape.
Stanford has no entries in the two
miles, but from reports there should be
some fast times made by > the runners in
that event. Booth of Johns Hopkins is
about the best, with 9:33 in a recent
meet. McLane of Pennsylvania is the
next best, with 9:37 to his credit. Tib
betts, Harvard, and Moore, Cornell, are
two other men who can do less than
9:40. Jensen of California will have to
step to get a place in this crowd.

The Stanford tracksters arc in Chi

the Windy City Alumni .Association.
The team will reach Boston Wednes
day, giving the members two days before
the 1.C.A.A.A.A., which is Friday and
Saturday. The second team will not
leave for Eugene, Oregon until Wednes
day.
One of the fastest races of the meet
should be in the mile run between Kirby
of Cornell, Douglas of Yale, and Kerr
of Stanford. Kirby was the fastest
miler in the East last year, taking first in
the I.C.A.A.A.A. in the remarkable time
of 4:174-5. Douglas placed third in the
same event.
However, Kirby has been ill this year,
and is not in the best of shape at the
present time. He was unable to run in
several of the meets, and on one occasion
was beaten by Douglas in a tri-school
contest. Kerr should be able to get
down to 4:20 Saturday, and this time
should put him right up among the
leaders. Some of the other milers who
are expected to give a good account of
themselves arc Cavanaugh of Boston,
Betts of Princeton, Enck of Penn State,
Smith of Stanford, and Walters of Har
vard.
Kirby should win in about 4:18. Doug
las has done 4:20 this year, while the
best Walters and Cavanaugh have done
is 4:23 and 4:24, respectively. From
these comparative times it will be seen
that Kerr should be able to get into a
third place if he is in shape.
Stanford has no entries in the two
miles, but from reports there should be
some fast times made by > the runners in
that event. Booth of Johns Hopkins is
about the best, with 9:33 in a recent
meet. McLane of Pennsylvania is the
next best, with 9:37 to his credit. Tib
betts, Harvard, and Moore, Cornell, are
two other men who can do less than
9:40. Jensen of California will have to
step to get a place in this crowd.

The Stanford tracksters arc in Chi
cago today, where they arc the guests of
the Windy City Alumni .Association.
The team will reach Boston Wednes
day, giving the members two days before
the 1.C.A.A.A.A., which is Friday and
Saturday. The second team will not
leave for Eugene, Oregon until Wednes
day.
One of the fastest races of the meet
should be in the mile run between Kirby
of Cornell, Douglas of Yale, and Kerr
of Stanford. Kirby was the fastest
miler in the East last year, taking first in
the I.C.A.A.A.A. in the remarkable time
of 4:174-5. Douglas placed third in the
same event.
However, Kirby has been ill this year,
and is not in the best of shape at the
present time. He was unable to run in
several of the meets, and on one occasion
was beaten by Douglas in a tri-school
contest. Kerr should be able to get
down to 4:20 Saturday, and this time
should put him right up among the
leaders. Some of the other milers who
are expected to give a good account of
themselves arc Cavanaugh of Boston,
Betts of Princeton, Enck of Penn State,
Smith of Stanford, and Walters of Har
vard.
Kirby should win in about 4:18. Doug
las has done 4:20 this year, while the
best Walters and Cavanaugh have done
is 4:23 and 4:24, respectively. From
these comparative times it will be seen
that Kerr should be able to get into a
third place if he is in shape.
Stanford has no entries in the two
miles, but from reports there should be
some fast times made by > the runners in
that event. Booth of Johns Hopkins is
about the best, with 9:33 in a recent
meet. McLane of Pennsylvania is the
next best, with 9:37 to his credit. Tib
betts, Harvard, and Moore, Cornell, are
two other men who can do less than
9:40. Jensen of California will have to
step to get a place in this crowd.
1245 Entries for I. C. 4-A
A total of 1245 entries, representing
thirty-three colleges, has been received
for the I. C. 4-A meet Friday and Sat
urday. Harvard tops the list with 166
entries. Cornell has 125; California, 25;
U.S.C., 18; and Stanford, 37.
