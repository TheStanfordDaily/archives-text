# STANFORD TRACKMEN ARRIVE AT CAMBRIDGE
## "Tiny" Hartranft Should Get Two Firsts at I. C. 4A.; Ludeke May Score in Hammer 
### 
FIFTEEN Stanford trackmen arrived in Boston this morning, and will
probably take their initial workout 'at Cambridge this afternoon.
The California team has already gone through its paces on the Harvard
track, and the I*. S. C. aggregation will not arrive at Boston until tmoorrow.
"Tiny" Hartrauft is Stanford's best bet for places in the 1. C. A. A. A. A.
He is in a class by himself in the shot, and should also get first or second in
the discus throw. Last year Hills of Princeton won the shot with a put of
47 feet. 8 3-4 inches, and this year he has done 49 feet 0 inches. Hartranft is
capable of more than 50 feet if forced to it. and so Hills should not worry
him. Last year Witter and Neufeldt of California got second and fourth

but they will be lucky
to <lo as well this year. Besides Hills,
Anderson and Houser of U. S. C. will
probably furnish most of the opposi
tion in the shot.
Neufeldt Competitor in Discus
Neufeldt took first in the discus last
year with a mark of 138 feet liy 2
inches, and Carpenter of Harvard was
| fifth with a mark of 138 feet 5 inches.
| This year Carpenter has improved un
| til he is being considered as a possi
-1 bility to beat Hartranft. He has thrown
the platter more than 150 feet on two
I occasions, Mauser and Anderson look
! like place-getters, and Neufeldt should
I be able to cop the other place. Kan
| rich of Pennsylvania is about the sec-
I ond best in the East and he has only
i done 134 feet 8 inches.
Bears May Take Javelin
The shot and discus are two events
j in each of which the California schools
| should he able to garner four places,
j Should California be lucky, the Bears
will account for three places in the
! javelin throw. Last year ISI feet 5
| inches was sufficient to place, and
j Neufeldt and the Dodson brothers are
I good for more than 190 feet. If the
i Bruins are lucky they may get a first,
jsecond, and third. Greenridge, Har-.
j vard, is good for 182 feet, and Drew,
j of Princeton can land the spear out
j to the 179 foot mark.
j Fred Ludeke may garner a few j
j points for the Redshirts in the hani
i nier throw. Emery of Princeton throws :
it 147 feet, and Taylor, of Pennsyl
vania does 14G feet. Hills may stop
shot putting long enough to throw
the hammer, and he iB capable of 151
feet. Ludeke usually is good for 145
feet, which should place him some
where near the top.
Miller's Time Good
Ted Miller compares very favorably
with the best quarter-milers in the East.
In fact, Gage, Yale, and Martz, U. S. C.,
are about the only runners who are likely
to trouble him. Martz can do around
:40 5-10 when in shape, and Gage is
capable of even faster time. Tierney of
Harvard is another man who can cover
the distance in less than :50 flat. The
time of tlie 440 last year was :48 2-5, and
Gage was in fourth place. These four
men are almost certain of places, while
the fifth place will be contested for by
a large group of runners who run the lap
in about :50 Hat, including Nelson Van
Judah, Stanford captain.
Marsters of Georgetown must be given
a slight edge in the 880. He generally
gets under 1:55. Hillfrich, Penu State,
is a dangerous contender. He was beaten
by Lowe of England this year in a race
which went at 1:55 4-5. Bill Richardson
should be able to get down to 1:55 or
even less under competition. Whatever
Richardson gets at Cambridge it is likely j
that Dick Mcintosh will get the next j
place, as these two men are running neck j
and neck. Swayne must be given a j
chance to place, although he must beat !
Mahoney, Boston; Leteny, Dartmouth;
and Milvihill, Harvard. These men all
do better than 1:58.
Southeners Surprised
Several surprises were thrown into
amateur athletes Saturday when the rec
ords of the Southern California Cali- j
fornia Olympic Games tryouts were an- j
nounced. Charlie Paddock showed that
he has lost none of his running form
when lie manipulated the 200-meter run
in 21 3-10, just one-tenth of a second
Jess than his world's record, Hcrschel
Smith, representing U.S.C., covered the
100-meter dash in 10 4-5, equalling the J
Olympic Games' record held by R. C. I
Craig. Keith Lloyd, former Nebraska
runner, and cousin to Harold Lloyd, was
only inches behind Smith.
Yale Martz, U.S.C., turned in a time j
of 48 9-10 in the 400-meter run, just one- j
fifth of a second slower than the time of !
Cochran, Olympic Club, made in the j
northern California tryouts in the
stadium. The 400-meter hurdles went at 1
54 2-5 with Morton Kaer, U.S.C., win- j
ning in a time within two-fifths of a '
second of the world's mark.

the distance in less than :50 flat. The
time of tlie 440 last year was :48 2-5, and
Gage was in fourth place. These four
men are almost certain of places, while
the fifth place will be contested for by
a large group of runners who run the lap
in about :50 Hat, including Nelson Van
Judah, Stanford captain.
Marsters of Georgetown must be given
a slight edge in the 880. He generally
gets under 1:55. Hillfrich, Penu State,
is a dangerous contender. He was beaten
by Lowe of England this year in a race
which went at 1:55 4-5. Bill Richardson
should be able to get down to 1:55 or
even less under competition. Whatever
Richardson gets at Cambridge it is likely j
that Dick Mcintosh will get the next j
place, as these two men are running neck j
and neck. Swayne must be given a j
chance to place, although he must beat !
Mahoney, Boston; Leteny, Dartmouth;
and Milvihill, Harvard. These men all
do better than 1:58.
Southeners Surprised
Several surprises were thrown into
amateur athletes Saturday when the rec
ords of the Southern California Cali- j
fornia Olympic Games tryouts were an- j
nounced. Charlie Paddock showed that
he has lost none of his running form
when lie manipulated the 200-meter run
in 21 3-10, just one-tenth of a second
Jess than his world's record, Hcrschel
Smith, representing U.S.C., covered the
100-meter dash in 10 4-5, equalling the J
Olympic Games' record held by R. C. I
Craig. Keith Lloyd, former Nebraska
runner, and cousin to Harold Lloyd, was
only inches behind Smith.
Yale Martz, U.S.C., turned in a time j
of 48 9-10 in the 400-meter run, just one- j
fifth of a second slower than the time of !
Cochran, Olympic Club, made in the j
northern California tryouts in the
stadium. The 400-meter hurdles went at 1
54 2-5 with Morton Kaer, U.S.C., win- j
ning in a time within two-fifths of a '
second of the world's mark.
An educational institution bearing j

FIFTEEN Stanford trackmen arrived in Boston this morning, and will
probably take their initial workout 'at Cambridge this afternoon.
The California team has already gone through its paces on the Harvard
track, and the I*. S. C. aggregation will not arrive at Boston until tmoorrow.
"Tiny" Hartrauft is Stanford's best bet for places in the 1. C. A. A. A. A.
He is in a class by himself in the shot, and should also get first or second in
the discus throw. Last year Hills of Princeton won the shot with a put of
47 feet. 8 3-4 inches, and this year he has done 49 feet 0 inches. Hartranft is
capable of more than 50 feet if forced to it. and so Hills should not worry
him. Last year Witter and Neufeldt of California got second and fourth

but they will be lucky
to <lo as well this year. Besides Hills,
Anderson and Houser of U. S. C. will
probably furnish most of the opposi
tion in the shot.
Neufeldt Competitor in Discus
Neufeldt took first in the discus last
year with a mark of 138 feet liy 2
inches, and Carpenter of Harvard was
| fifth with a mark of 138 feet 5 inches.
| This year Carpenter has improved un

the platter more than 150 feet on two
I occasions, Mauser and Anderson look
! like place-getters, and Neufeldt should
I be able to cop the other place. Kan
| rich of Pennsylvania is about the sec-
I ond best in the East and he has only
i done 134 feet 8 inches.

j in each of which the California schools

! javelin throw. Last year ISI feet 5

j Neufeldt and the Dodson brothers are
I good for more than 190 feet. If the
i Bruins are lucky they may get a first,
jsecond, and third. Greenridge, Har-.
j vard, is good for 182 feet, and Drew,
j of Princeton can land the spear out
j to the 179 foot mark.
j Fred Ludeke may garner a few j
j points for the Redshirts in the hani
i nier throw. Emery of Princeton throws :
it 147 feet, and Taylor, of Pennsyl
vania does 14G feet. Hills may stop
shot putting long enough to throw
the hammer, and he iB capable of 151
feet. Ludeke usually is good for 145
feet, which should place him some
where near the top.

Ted Miller compares very favorably
with the best quarter-milers in the East.
In fact, Gage, Yale, and Martz, U. S. C.,

Anderson and Houser of U. S. C. will
probably furnish most of the opposi
tion in the shot.
Neufeldt Competitor in Discus
Neufeldt took first in the discus last
year with a mark of 138 feet liy 2
inches, and Carpenter of Harvard was
| fifth with a mark of 138 feet 5 inches.
| This year Carpenter has improved un
| til he is being considered as a possi
-1 bility to beat Hartranft. He has thrown
the platter more than 150 feet on two
I occasions, Mauser and Anderson look
! like place-getters, and Neufeldt should
I be able to cop the other place. Kan
| rich of Pennsylvania is about the sec-
I ond best in the East and he has only
i done 134 feet 8 inches.
Bears May Take Javelin
The shot and discus are two events
j in each of which the California schools
| should he able to garner four places,
j Should California be lucky, the Bears
will account for three places in the
! javelin throw. Last year ISI feet 5
| inches was sufficient to place, and
j Neufeldt and the Dodson brothers are
I good for more than 190 feet. If the
i Bruins are lucky they may get a first,
jsecond, and third. Greenridge, Har-.
j vard, is good for 182 feet, and Drew,
j of Princeton can land the spear out
j to the 179 foot mark.
j Fred Ludeke may garner a few j
j points for the Redshirts in the hani
i nier throw. Emery of Princeton throws :
it 147 feet, and Taylor, of Pennsyl
vania does 14G feet. Hills may stop
shot putting long enough to throw
the hammer, and he iB capable of 151
feet. Ludeke usually is good for 145
feet, which should place him some
where near the top.
Miller's Time Good
Ted Miller compares very favorably
with the best quarter-milers in the East.
In fact, Gage, Yale, and Martz, U. S. C.,
are about the only runners who are likely
to trouble him. Martz can do around
:40 5-10 when in shape, and Gage is
capable of even faster time. Tierney of
Harvard is another man who can cover
the distance in less than :50 flat. The
time of tlie 440 last year was :48 2-5, and
Gage was in fourth place. These four
men are almost certain of places, while
the fifth place will be contested for by
a large group of runners who run the lap
in about :50 Hat, including Nelson Van
Judah, Stanford captain.
Marsters of Georgetown must be given
a slight edge in the 880. He generally
gets under 1:55. Hillfrich, Penu State,
is a dangerous contender. He was beaten
by Lowe of England this year in a race
which went at 1:55 4-5. Bill Richardson
should be able to get down to 1:55 or
even less under competition. Whatever
Richardson gets at Cambridge it is likely j
that Dick Mcintosh will get the next j
place, as these two men are running neck j
and neck. Swayne must be given a j
chance to place, although he must beat !
Mahoney, Boston; Leteny, Dartmouth;
and Milvihill, Harvard. These men all
do better than 1:58.
Southeners Surprised
Several surprises were thrown into
amateur athletes Saturday when the rec
ords of the Southern California Cali- j
fornia Olympic Games tryouts were an- j
nounced. Charlie Paddock showed that
he has lost none of his running form
when lie manipulated the 200-meter run
in 21 3-10, just one-tenth of a second
Jess than his world's record, Hcrschel
Smith, representing U.S.C., covered the
100-meter dash in 10 4-5, equalling the J
Olympic Games' record held by R. C. I
Craig. Keith Lloyd, former Nebraska
runner, and cousin to Harold Lloyd, was
only inches behind Smith.
Yale Martz, U.S.C., turned in a time j
of 48 9-10 in the 400-meter run, just one- j
fifth of a second slower than the time of !
Cochran, Olympic Club, made in the j
northern California tryouts in the
stadium. The 400-meter hurdles went at 1
54 2-5 with Morton Kaer, U.S.C., win- j
ning in a time within two-fifths of a '
second of the world's mark.

FIFTEEN Stanford trackmen arrived in Boston this morning, and will

track, and the I*. S. C. aggregation will not arrive at Boston until tmoorrow.
"Tiny" Hartrauft is Stanford's best bet for places in the 1. C. A. A. A. A.
He is in a class by himself in the shot, and should also get first or second in
the discus throw. Last year Hills of Princeton won the shot with a put of
47 feet. 8 3-4 inches, and this year he has done 49 feet 0 inches. Hartranft is
capable of more than 50 feet if forced to it. and so Hills should not worry
him. Last year Witter and Neufeldt of California got second and fourth

but they will be lucky
to <lo as well this year. Besides Hills,
