# STANFORD TRACKMEN ARRIVE AT CAMBRIDGE
## "Tiny" Hartranft Should Get Two Firsts at I. C. 4A.; Ludeke May Score in Hammer 
### 
FIFTEEN Stanford trackmen arrived in Boston this morning, and will
probably take their initial workout 'at Cambridge this afternoon.
The California team has already gone through its paces on the Harvard
track, and the I*. S. C. aggregation will not arrive at Boston until tmoorrow.
"Tiny" Hartrauft is Stanford's best bet for places in the 1. C. A. A. A. A.
He is in a class by himself in the shot, and should also get first or second in
the discus throw. Last year Hills of Princeton won the shot with a put of
47 feet. 8 3-4 inches, and this year he has done 49 feet 0 inches. Hartranft is
capable of more than 50 feet if forced to it. and so Hills should not worry
him. Last year Witter and Neufeldt of California got second and fourth

but they will be lucky
to <lo as well this year. Besides Hills,
Anderson and Houser of U. S. C. will
probably furnish most of the opposi
tion in the shot.
Neufeldt Competitor in Discus
Neufeldt took first in the discus last
year with a mark of 138 feet liy 2
inches, and Carpenter of Harvard was
| fifth with a mark of 138 feet 5 inches.
| This year Carpenter has improved un
| til he is being considered as a possi
-1 bility to beat Hartranft. He has thrown
the platter more than 150 feet on two
I occasions, Mauser and Anderson look
! like place-getters, and Neufeldt should
I be able to cop the other place. Kan
| rich of Pennsylvania is about the sec-
I ond best in the East and he has only
i done 134 feet 8 inches.
Bears May Take Javelin
The shot and discus are two events
j in each of which the California schools
| should he able to garner four places,
j Should California be lucky, the Bears
will account for three places in the
! javelin throw. Last year ISI feet 5
| inches was sufficient to place, and
j Neufeldt and the Dodson brothers are
I good for more than 190 feet. If the
i Bruins are lucky they may get a first,
jsecond, and third. Greenridge, Har-.
j vard, is good for 182 feet, and Drew,
j of Princeton can land the spear out
j to the 179 foot mark.
j Fred Ludeke may garner a few j
j points for the Redshirts in the hani
i nier throw. Emery of Princeton throws :
