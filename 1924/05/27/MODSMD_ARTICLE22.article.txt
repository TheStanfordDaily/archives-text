# JIM WILSON WINS FIRST FLIGHT OF GOLF TOURNAMENT
## "Andy" Kerr, McInnes, Klauber, Dryden, Enter Finals At Menlo Club Today 
### 
By defeating Lloyd Byerly in the
final round, Jim Wilson is the winner
of the lirst tlight of the Stanford open
golf tournament, now being played on
the links of the Menlo Country Club.
To win his flight Wilson had to beat
"Reg" Hirsehman, captain of the Stan
ford golf team in the first round, and
in the round before the finals defeated
Tom C'ondit, who has shown unusual
ability on the links recently.
The semi-finals were played in the
second and third flights yesterday af
ternoon, and the finals are being
played this afternoon at the Menlo
Club.
"Andy" Kerr Wins Semi-Final
In the second flight to reach the
finals. Coach "Andy" Kerr disposed of
Arthur Colin, and Chester Mclnnes de
feated George Crocker. Coach Kerr
looms as a likely winner of this flight j
as his golf is at its peak. Due to his j
having to leave for the North with
the track team, Kerr's match was
played off this morning.
The finalists in the third flight are j
Allan Klauber, captain of the fresh-1
man golf team, and Horace Dryden. j
In the semi-finals Klauber beat Charles '
Fleishman, and Dryden disposed of
"Reg" Pegram. The Dryden-Pegram
match was one of the closest of the
entire tournament, the match being
carried to the eighteenth green before

it was decided. At the eleventh hole
Drydn was 5 up on Pegram, but five
holes of par golf by Pegram evened
the count at the sixteenth hole. The
seventeenth was won by Dryden in
par 4, and the best that Pegram could
do on the final hole was to tie Dry
den's par 5, giving Dryden the match
with a one-hole advantage.
A cup is to be awarded the winner
of each flight. A. G. Spalding & Co.
has also donated balls for the low
medal scores in each flight.

It has been estimated that the stu
dents of the University of Wisconsin
consume on the average of three tons
of peanuts a month.
