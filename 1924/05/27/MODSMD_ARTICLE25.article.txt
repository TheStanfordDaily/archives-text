These are times of nervousness—yea. of much agitation. The poor
students are slowly and yet swiftly traveling toward the abyss of final ex
aminations. And the worry is colossal.

townsmen and others.
Leaving unpaid bills is not only bad business but the load has to be

unknown. —University Daily Kansan.
