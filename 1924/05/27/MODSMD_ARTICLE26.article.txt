"To go or not to go," that is the question Stanford sororities are facing.
At first blush, it might appear to some people that such a problem is
not a very serious one and that it concerns but a very small group. On the
contrary, the women's Greek-letter societies are face to face with a very
vital question, one which will affect the entire campus and should be of
interest to every Stanford man and woman.
In spite of the fact that the situation is of interest to the student body
as a whole, the decision must be reached by the women most intimately
connected with the affair, namely, the sorority women. They should be
allowed to reach their decision, undisturbed, and without outside influence.
The men, particularly, should refrain from meddling in the affair.
They can hope to do nothing but confuse those with whom the decision
rests. The Daily Palo Alto believes that, if the sorority women are given
plenty of time to consider the proposition, they will eventually decide upon
the most expedient course.
