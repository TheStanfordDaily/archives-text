### 
Individual students and living groups should cooperate to the fullest
extent with Chief Dugan this week, to help clean-up the campus.
Fire prevention week, which is being observed all over the United
States is the immediate cause of the general campaign to remove rubbish
and other inflammable matter. The scarcity of water here makes it abso
lutely necessary that we take particular pains to prevent fires.
It is very easy to let trash accumulate in basements, attics, and closets.
This sort of rubbish is usually highly inflammable, and, in view the type
of buildings that predominates on the campus, it should be removed.
Chief Dugan cannot do this work alone. With the cooperation of the
student body, as a whole, however, the job should be comparatively easy.
