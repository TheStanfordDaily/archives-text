When we shall have finished bring
ing the Odyssey and Kid Ulysses to
the American masses (in the form
adapted to the mentality of plumbers,
street cleaners, etc., etc., etc.) we
shall start the exploitation of the

Helen's abductor in Troy and exclaim

Dear Sal,
Now that rushing is over, we being
all pledged up, I must tell you all
about the hop. Sunday was the big
day, and honey, it was a dinger. Up
till the time we went in to state our
first preference (and get our third,
maybe) we were all stewing around
and having quiet little worries, that
is, all but me, I'd been signed up for
two weeks. Well, we had to go through
with it, and of course I got my first
preference, it being a foregone cinch.
Had the darndest time walking up to
the house, because all the dumb males
hl«l turned out to feast their eyes,
and a whole column of cars full of
laughing jackasses followed me up to
the house —the last one, it seemed. . .
Such a long way! Kissed more girls
when I got there; saw one or two boys
envying me—but they wouldn't have.
God, what a variety of breaths in
that "loving group." They have the
rep for being about the best league
on the campus, and they looked awful
good during rushing; but on closer ac
quaintance what a bunch of dills they
turned out to be! The consolation is
that they took a couple of other good
frosh besides me, and besides, no one
outside knows as much as I do about
them, and besides the other "flats"
are just as bad. My dear, you ought
to see some of them!
Faithfully, Kate.
