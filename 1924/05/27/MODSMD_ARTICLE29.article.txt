Hal Davis
A mixture of Scotch-Welsh, and the
experience of a world war and two
colleges, have been combined in the
person of Harold McDonald Davis,
Stanford's newest addition to the
Physical Education department.
Graduating from high school in In
diana in 1914, Davis secured a position
as teacher and janitor in a small
country school at a large salary of $50
per month. Out of this he was able to
save enough to put him through his
first year at Indiana after only one
year's work. The world war took him
from Indiana in the summer of 1917,
and he had a varied experience in the
service. His most interesting job was
that of working for the Secret Service.
While in this work he was put on the
job of arresting the I. W. W.'s or
"Wobblies," as they are affectionately
known in the North.
After leaving the service in 1918,
Davis stayed home for a year and dealt
with the neighboring farmers in the
seed and produce business. He was
able to accumulate enough in that one
year to make his way smooth for his
last two years of college, which he
completed at Illinois.
In high school and college, Davis
was active in athletics, specializing in
football, basketball, wrestling, and
tennis. During the summer of 1901, he
was in charge of the swimming course
at the summer school for coaches
held at Illinois.
From 1921 to 19294, Davis was direc
tor of physical education in the
Orange Union high school. He was
asked to come to Stanford this past
winter quarter, and has taken charge
of wrestling and tennis.

A beauty contest has recently been
held at Carnegie Tech. The judges
were Tony Sarg, Charles Dana Gib
son, and Coles Phillips.
