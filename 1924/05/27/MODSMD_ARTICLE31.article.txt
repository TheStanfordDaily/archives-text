"Nip" McHose
About the time that Pancho Villa
was executing some of his playful
pranks around the border, "Nip" Mc-
Hose, our ex-basketball captain, was
conducting similar activities around
the old home quarters.
He had an extensive repertoire of
tricks in which the livestock of the
neighborhood unwillingly contributed
more than its just share. It was after
the time he tied an alarm-clock to the
cow's tail that one of his parents saw
fit to undertake a punitive expedition.
As a result he was locked up in the
attic all afternoon.
But "Nip" was prepared for such an
emergency. He has been keeping one
of the house cats in a box in the same
room in order to test its starvation
resistant qualities. It was now in a
condition to furnish him with needful
diversion.
He had a piece of bacon he had been
saving up for a rainy day. This he
tied to one end of a string while the
other extremity was made fast to an
old tin-can. He slung the string over
a nail in one of the roof rafters. He
placed the tin can on a shelf. Then,
by a series of allied contrivances, he
had the entire apparatus so adjusted
that he could tip over the.tin can on
the shelf by exposing some of the
cherished bacon to the cat.
He used the tin can as a hoop and
one of his marbles as a basketball.
Whenever the marble fell inside the
can, considerable effort was saved him
by the self-adjusting apparatus which
tipped the marble out. Thus he started
training for his college career.
