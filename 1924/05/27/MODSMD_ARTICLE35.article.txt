Editor, Daily Palo Alto:
Dear Sir:
In last night's Daily Palo Alto a
public proposal for the abolishment of
sororities was made for the first time.
The question is to be voted upon by
the sororities next Monday night, ac
cording to the present plans. This
gives them less than a week in which
to consider the question, which means
that an institution which has existed
for thirty-two years is to be brought
to judgment and either again endorsed
or rejected by the sororities in ac
cordance with decisions made iu that
short time.
Such a radical change should not be
undertaken without careful delibera
tion, and within a period of seven
days it is hardly possible to give the
matter sufficient thought to come to a
sane conclusion. The fact is that, as
was also stated in the article, but "few
of the sorority women have as yet
made up their minds on the matter."
All of which seems to indicate that
the proposal is very new to the ma
jority of those immediately concerned.
In view of this, it is only reasonable
that this rather surprised majority
should be given that amount of time
to think which the seriousness of the
proposed step merits —and seven days
is far from adequate. Moreover, it is
impossible for a local chapter of a
national sorority to give up its charter
without first bringing the matter to
the attention of the national organiza
tion. Certainly no sorority can fairly
present the question to its national
body and receive an answer from them
by Monday night, the time set for the
vote.
We are being askefl to vote —and

we don't know who is doing the ask
ing, by the way—to either continue
having sororities or to abolish them,
without knowing the alternatives in
either case. Where will we go if put
out? Where are the dormitories? We
haven't them now. llow soon will
funds be available to build them?
To sum it all up, hte proposal seems
rather radical and hasty. We have
neither sufficient time nor sufficient

information in order to reach a sound
conclusion, with justice to both sides,
upon a really serious question.

body and receive an answer from them
by Monday night, the time set for the
vote.
We are being askefl to vote —and

we don't know who is doing the ask
ing, by the way—to either continue
having sororities or to abolish them,
without knowing the alternatives in
either case. Where will we go if put
out? Where are the dormitories? We
haven't them now. llow soon will
funds be available to build them?
To sum it all up, hte proposal seems
rather radical and hasty. We have
neither sufficient time nor sufficient

information in order to reach a sound
conclusion, with justice to both sides,
upon a really serious question.
Very truly—L. C.
