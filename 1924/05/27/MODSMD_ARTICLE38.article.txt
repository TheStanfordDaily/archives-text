# FACTS ABOUT THE LEAGUE
## No. 4. WORLD COURT 
### BYRON WILLIAMS 
A Series of Articles Telling of the Actual Accomplishments Since Its Inception in 1920.

In fulfillment of Article 14 of the
Covenant, the Council of the League
of Nations 011 February 13, 1920, ap
pointed an Advisory Committee of
Jurists to formulate a scheme of the
organization of the Permanent Court
of International Justice.
The draft statute was submitted to
the First Assembly of the League at
Geneva in November, 1920. The As
sembly by a unanimous vote 011 Decem
ber 13, 1920, approved the resolution
■providing that the Statute be submit
ted to the Members of the League for
ratification. Ratifications were prompt
ly made, and the Second Assembly
and Council 011 September 14 and 15,
1921, elected the eleven Judges and
the four Deputy Judges, who make up
the court.
Selection of Judges
The judges are elected for nine
years by majorities in the Council
and Assembly, from a panel of nomi
nees submitted by the national dele
gations to the Hague Court of Arbi
tration.
The Court has power to deal with
all cases brought before it by the
parties concerned or referred to it for
an opinion by the Council or Assem
bly, or put under its jurisdiction by
clauses in treaties, such as the Minor
ities Treaties, the Upper Silesian Con
vention, the Aalaud Islands Conven
tion, and the Lama Agreement be
tween Czechoslovakia and Austria.
Decisions of the Court are based on
(1) international conventions estab
lishing rules expressly recognized by
the contesting parties; (2) interna
tional custom, as evidence of a gen
eral practice accepted as law; (3) the
general principles of law recognized
by civilized nations; and (4) judicial
decisions and the teachings of the
most highly qualified publicists of the
various nations, as subsidiary means
for the determination of rules of law.

been asked to zvrite on flic subject, " The
Imerican Relation to the Permanent
Court." His contribution follows:
The American Relation to the
Permanent Court
Behind the backs of the Senatorial
watch dogs of our liberties, America
has been able to participate construc
tively, though intermittently, in the
attempts at solution of the interna
tional problems that are liarrassing
the world. Two of many instances are
the recent splendid work of General
Dawes and his associates and the dis
tinguished part played by Elihu Root
four years ago in drafting the statute
of the Permanent Court of Internation
al Justice. In the case of the Court,
we have made a further unofficial con
tribution by virtue of the election of
John Bassett Moore as a member of
the tribunal. Officially, however, this
country has stood with Soviet Russia
in regarding the court with distrust
and suspicion.
On this issue Henry Cabot Lodge
and Gregory Vassilievitch Chicherin,
Hiram Johnson and Leon Trotsky
stand shoulder to shoulder and thanks
to them and a few of their associates,
neither the Russian Communist Party,
nor the American Republican Party
is committed to the support of this in
ternational institution of such doubt
ful antecedents and such devastating
possibilities.
Forty-seven nations have signed the
protocol of the Court and thirty-six
have ratified it. Since its organization
at The Hague in the early months of
1922, the Court has rendered eight ad

j visory opinions and one judgment.
The latter, the "Wimbledon Case,"
was the most significant since it was
the first time in history that a sover
eign state had been arraigned by other
sovereign states before an interna
tional court.
In February, 1923, President Hard
ing advocated the official participa
tion of this country in the activities
of the Court. The proposal was re
ferred to the Committee on Foreign
I Affairs of which Mr. Lodge is chair
man. There it remained without ac
tion, even though our adherence was
1 again urged by Mr. Harding in his
i St. Louis speech in June and by Presi
dent Coolidge in the message last
j December.
I Reservations were drawn up by Mr.
Hughes to quiet the fears of the iso
lationists, who, though they had pro
nounced the League dead and buried,
became violently hysterical over the
j alleged relationship of the Court to
j the deceased. A few weeks ago Mr.
Lodge's Committee, in response to
wide agitation, began hearings on the
proposal. A vast preponderance of
I testimony favored adherence on the
i basis of the Harding-Hughes reserva
tions. Mr. Lodge, therefore, brought
i forth a plan of his own, which was
greeted with derisive comment from
t all quarters, except the isolationists,
I to whom the Lodge plan had the su
preme merit of certain repudiation by
the rest of the world.
| The final act of the comedy was
I performed last week, when the pro
! posal that had been backed by two
Republican Presidents and the Repub
i lican Secretary of State was put for-
I ward in the Committee on Foreign
Affairs by the senior Democratic mem
ber and Avas promptly voted down by
the Republican majority. Mr. Lodge
j then withdrew his plan and a com-
I promise which seems to be equally
I futile was adopted. This compromise
j is, of course, of no importance, since
, it won't be voted on by the Senate. It
j does serve, however, to blur the issue
sufficiently to prevent a clean-cut ex
j pression of opinion in the next elec-
I tion. The isolationists have again
■ turned the 1 trick. The nation is saved
I once more, and we are still denied the
! right to co-operate openly with other
j nations in enterprises of international
j good will.
But the watch dogs of our liberties
\ are changed in the front yard of
' diplomacy; they can't prevent our
! contributing to world understanding
j as long as we carry our contributions
| by devious alleys and offer them fur
tively over the back fence.
