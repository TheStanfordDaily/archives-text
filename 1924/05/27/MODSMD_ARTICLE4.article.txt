# Practical Jokers Try Making Kappa Formal a Jolly-Up
## 
### 
Kappa Kappa Gamma is giving a
formal dance tomorrow night. That i 3
a matter of record in the minutes of
the Executive Committee.
Evidently some humorously-minded
person, feeling that a jolly-up was a
more appropriate affair than a formal,
took it upon himself to extend about
fifty bids to the affair on his own
hook.
If you have received a bid. examine
it carefully, if you find that it is
artistically printed, rather than en
graved. you are the victim of a prac
tical joke.
