# JOURNALISTS WILL HEAR MORRIS TRACY. UNITED PRESS HEAD
## 
### 
Morris l)e H. Tracy, manager of the
Pacific Division of the United Press
Associations, who will speak at an
open meeting of the Stanford Jour
nalists' Club tonight at 7:15 o'clock at
the home of Professor Everett Smith,
12 Alvarado Row, spent, eight years in
the small city newspaper field in Cali
fornia before beginning his work with
the United Press, where he has been
for an equal length of time.
This varied experience will enable
Mr. Tracy to discuss with some de
gree of authority aspects of small city
journalism as well as the activities
of the United Press, which is one of
the two pincipal news-gathering or
ganizations today. An interesting
phase of the United Press organiza
tion work is the promptness with
which it must operate, since it aims
to be primarily a service for evening
newspapers, and must compete with
other services in reaching different
editions of afternoon dailies.
The meeting will be informal and
all who are interested are invited to
attend. Following Mr. Tracy's talk,
there will be questions and discussion.
