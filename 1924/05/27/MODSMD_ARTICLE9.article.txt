### Beatrice Flesher 
Artistry as a soloist combined wwith !
unusual skill us an accompanist char-1
acterized Richard Malaby, pianist, in
his playing last evening in the Assem
bly hall for the joint recital he gave
with Elizabeth Peirce, violinist, and
Winifred Estabrook, soprano.
Miss Peirce and Miss Estabrook
performed with skill and charm, not :
only in their solo selections, but in
the French songs which were pre
sented by the trio.
Plays Grieg With Charm
Malaby, in his interpretation of
five "Miniatures," each repre- 1
sentative of the composer's art, was
at his best. He played "Erotik,"
"Grandmother's Minuet," "Nocturne,''!
"Butterfly," and "By the Cradle." The
cnange in mood was evident, and he j
brought it out with great feeling, con-j
trusting soft dreamy portions with
staccato and crescendo variations. 'His
rendering of the light, familiar runs
betrayed u delicacy of touch, combined
with power and absolute control.
Miss Estabrook showed versatility
in singing equally well the simple Old I
English melody, "The Poor Soul Sat
Sighing by a Sycamore Tree," and
Ronald's dramatic "Prelude, Cycle of
Life." The sweetness of her voice was
delightful in its full, clear rendering
of her songs.
Clear Notes in Violin* Solo
Lovely, in melody were the notes
Miss Peirce brought forth from the
violin in all of her selections. She
could change from the dreamy, senti
mental mood of the "Reverie" to
Rreisler's livelier "Liebesleid," and
"Minuet," and made all equally pleas
ing and appealing.
Malaby, who accompanied both Miss
Peirce find Miss Estabrook, played
also Cyril Scott's "Danse Negre," a
short piece requiring great, versatility.
This, and Schumann's "Whims," which
is a piece of many moods, he inter
preted skillfully.
He played MacDowell's interpreta
tion of Tennyson's "Eagle," and Rach
maninoff's "Prelude, No. 12, G Sharp
Minor" with great feeling.
The trio all belong to the Stanford
Music Club.

Ronald's dramatic "Prelude, Cycle of
Life." The sweetness of her voice was
delightful in its full, clear rendering
of her songs.
Clear Notes in Violin* Solo
Lovely, in melody were the notes
Miss Peirce brought forth from the
violin in all of her selections. She
could change from the dreamy, senti
mental mood of the "Reverie" to
Rreisler's livelier "Liebesleid," and
"Minuet," and made all equally pleas
ing and appealing.
Malaby, who accompanied both Miss
Peirce find Miss Estabrook, played
also Cyril Scott's "Danse Negre," a
short piece requiring great, versatility.
This, and Schumann's "Whims," which
is a piece of many moods, he inter
preted skillfully.
He played MacDowell's interpreta
tion of Tennyson's "Eagle," and Rach
maninoff's "Prelude, No. 12, G Sharp
Minor" with great feeling.
The trio all belong to the Stanford
Music Club.

Artistry as a soloist combined wwith !
unusual skill us an accompanist char-1
acterized Richard Malaby, pianist, in
his playing last evening in the Assem
bly hall for the joint recital he gave
with Elizabeth Peirce, violinist, and
Winifred Estabrook, soprano.
Miss Peirce and Miss Estabrook
performed with skill and charm, not :
only in their solo selections, but in
the French songs which were pre
sented by the trio.
Plays Grieg With Charm
Malaby, in his interpretation of
five "Miniatures," each repre- 1
sentative of the composer's art, was
at his best. He played "Erotik,"
"Grandmother's Minuet," "Nocturne,''!
"Butterfly," and "By the Cradle." The
cnange in mood was evident, and he j
brought it out with great feeling, con-j
trusting soft dreamy portions with
staccato and crescendo variations. 'His
rendering of the light, familiar runs
betrayed u delicacy of touch, combined
with power and absolute control.
Miss Estabrook showed versatility
in singing equally well the simple Old I
English melody, "The Poor Soul Sat
Sighing by a Sycamore Tree," and
Ronald's dramatic "Prelude, Cycle of
Life." The sweetness of her voice was
delightful in its full, clear rendering
of her songs.
