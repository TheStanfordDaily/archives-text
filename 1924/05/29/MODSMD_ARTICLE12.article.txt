# "Chuck" Johnston Accused of Being "Beau Brummel"
## 
### 
Few men will admit that they are
lady-killers. So "Chuck" Johnston
*ouht hardly be expected to admit that
he had once been a Beau Brumuiel.
The case now before public opinion
is whether or not "Chuck" Johnston
once played the part of Beau Brummel
for a campus girl. "Cliuck" not only
says he didn't; he swears he didn't.
However, there is the campus girl, j
who, somewhere in her memory book,
has some pressed flowers that she
treasures.
The explainant says, "Oh, my dear,
you should see the wonderful corsage
"Chuck" Johnston sent me just before i
the Big Game. Oh, don't you know ■
him? Why, he's the best looking man. j
And he has the most wonderful j
EYES."
The Complainant says: "Why, I j
don't even know the girl. Fine time!
for a fellow to be thinking about ,
sending a girl tlowers just before a,
Uig Game, anyway!"
On account of the fact that an im- j
partial jury cannot be obtained the j
case cannot be tried in court. A jury j
composed of men is usually known to |
decide tin l case in favor of the woman, j
while a jury made up of women would
bring in a verdict in favor of Johns- \
ton. Why? Them EYES.
