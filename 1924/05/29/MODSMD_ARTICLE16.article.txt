### Beatrice Flesher 
Redshirt track squads in the East
at the I. C. A. A. A. A. meet and in
the West at the Pacific Coast Confer
ence at Eugene, Oregon, have a good
chance for victory in the field during
the coming week-end.
Both teams are large enough to take
first places—fifteen men were sent to
the Atlantic Coast, and ten went up
north. At Cambridge, tryouts will be
conducted Friday to choose those
qualified to enter the meet on Satur
day.
U. S. C. and U. C. Strong

fered will be that from Yale, Prince
ton, Penn State, U. S. C. ( and Cali
fornia. The western universities may
rob the Cards of points in the shot
put, discus, hurdles, quarter mile,
broad jump, 100 yard and 200 yard
dashes.
Jim Barber of California is danger
ous in spite of his showing in the big
meet, and may pull into first place in
one of the sprints. Bowman of Syra
cuse is the outstanding man in the
100 yard dash. Clarke of Johns Hop
kins, who placed second in that event
last year, has made the same time as
Bowman, :09 8-10. Barber also has
equalled it.
Chances in 100-Yard Dash
Hale and Campbell of Stanford come
next, according to the dopesters. Hale |
should come in at least third, having j
made the century in :09 9-10. Camp- |

had an opportunity to place first in
the low hurdles, and perhaps second
in the high hurdles.
In the low hurdles he has made 24.4
bettered only by Grumbles of U. S. C., I
who cleared the hurdles in 24 seconds
flat. Scattergood of Princeton follows j
with his record at 24.6 Martin of i

first. Following closely are Boren of
1 California, who made 24 feet 1 inch.
He came in third in last year's meet.
Macrae, of Stanford, who has 22 feet
9 inches to his credit, has a chance of
placing. Rose of Pennsylvania has cov

Redshirt track squads in the East
at the I. C. A. A. A. A. meet and in
the West at the Pacific Coast Confer
ence at Eugene, Oregon, have a good
chance for victory in the field during
the coming week-end.
Both teams are large enough to take
first places—fifteen men were sent to
the Atlantic Coast, and ten went up
north. At Cambridge, tryouts will be
conducted Friday to choose those
qualified to enter the meet on Satur
day.
U. S. C. and U. C. Strong
Among the strongest competition of
fered will be that from Yale, Prince
ton, Penn State, U. S. C. ( and Cali
fornia. The western universities may
rob the Cards of points in the shot
put, discus, hurdles, quarter mile,
broad jump, 100 yard and 200 yard
dashes.
Jim Barber of California is danger
ous in spite of his showing in the big
meet, and may pull into first place in
one of the sprints. Bowman of Syra
cuse is the outstanding man in the
100 yard dash. Clarke of Johns Hop
kins, who placed second in that event
last year, has made the same time as
Bowman, :09 8-10. Barber also has
equalled it.
Chances in 100-Yard Dash
Hale and Campbell of Stanford come
next, according to the dopesters. Hale |
should come in at least third, having j
made the century in :09 9-10. Camp- |
bell, McKim of Princeton, and Conway
of Penn State have made :10 flat.
In the 220 yard, Clarke is conceded
the best chances, although Campbell

Kim of Princeton are also thought to
have chances of placing in this event.
Anderson of Stanford, who has
made 6 feet 2% inches, may take any

3 inches; Needs of Pennsylvania and
Robusch of Pittsburgh have cleared
the bar at 6 feet 2 inches. Darling of
Amherst and Ross of U. S. C. have
made 6 feet 1 inch.
Leistner of Stanford looks as If he
had an opportunity to place first in
the low hurdles, and perhaps second
in the high hurdles.
In the low hurdles he has made 24.4
bettered only by Grumbles of U. S. C., I
who cleared the hurdles in 24 seconds
flat. Scattergood of Princeton follows j
with his record at 24.6 Martin of i
Pennsylvania and Anderson of U. S. CJ

Dye, of IT. S. C., holds the best time, I
15 seconds flat, for the high hurdles.
