# Party Politics?

### 
In the past year politics have played too important a part in campus
elections. Instead of the best man being chosen for office, the candidate
who belonged to a living group with the largest number of voters won tlu
election. In short a Hall man voted for a Hall candidate, because he was
a Hall man; and a fraternity man cast his vote for a fraternity man, be
cause he was a fraternity man.
What chance would Lincoln have had to become the president of the
United States if the people who lived in log cabins had been the only ones
who voted for him ?
If Socrates should suddenly appear on the Stanford campus and run
for the head of the Philosophy department, he would undoubtedly be de
feated. Why? Because the wise old fellow would live neither
at a house nor at a hall, and, living alone, he would have no constituents
to vote for him, unless perhaps, the commuters did.
According to present day politics on the campus Noah would have been
elected on a white ballot had he run for office. All those in the Ark would
have voted for him, and every one else would have drowned, anyway.
College students ridicule the woman who says she votes the Demo
cratic ticket because her husband does. They also laugh at the man who
declares he is a Republican l>ecause his father was. Yet in practice the
college student is no better than those at whom he laughs.
It is to the advantage of the campus voter to seek to elect the best man
with the most ability to office, even if he lives in a tree.
Forbidden fruits may be the sweetest, but what about forbidden
holidays ?
