Oh Stauford snake in breeches slick
You have my admiration.
With dirt and cords and common clothes
Avoid contamination.
Your boyish socks and perky tie
Bespeak the stylish lover.
Your charm lies in resemblance
To —my little knickered brother.

To avoid being trampled to death by the chivalrous males who plow their
way down the sidewalks, is a serious problem facing the Stanford woman.
The following hints were suggested by Annie Laurie for avoidance of
untimely death: First—lf you are husky and have a block "S," charge the
approaching phalanx like the proverbial bull. The men, having smoked
cigarettes since twelve years of age, will collapse at your attack, and you
will be able to pass on undisturbed. Second—lf you are thin and long-winded,
jump aside as the line thunders toward you and sprint around the end,
making a touchdown at the next street corner. Third, if you don't think
quickly enough to avoid the onrush by tlie above means, fall prostrate, spread
.•self out as smoothly as possible over the sidewalk and relax while the line
marches across you. Don't be afraid of disturbing the men for they won't
even notice you.

He (to her at dance) —Who's the slick woman?
She (witheringly)—An import.
He (enthusiastically)—l'm all for foreign trade.
