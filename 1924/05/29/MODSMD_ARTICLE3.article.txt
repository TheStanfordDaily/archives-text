## 
###

Press is founded is that there should
be no monopoly of news, and that any
paper desiring news service should
be able to obtain it, according to Mor
ris He H. Tracy, manager of the
Pacific Division of the United Press,
who spoke last night to the Stanford
Journalists Club at the home of Pro
fessor Eyerett W. Smith.

news-gathering organization giving
service to South America, the Orient
and many European countries, besides
the 1000 papers it supplies in the
United States.
"It is the policy of the United Press

in news," declared Mr. Tracy, "and to
portray the humor and pathos in the
life of people."
Developing Oriental Service
The United Press is rapidly develop
ihg its Oriental service. Consequently.
Mr. Tracy is especially familiar with
journalism in the Far East, and he
told of a peculiar custom of Japanese
newspapers. Each paper placeß on its
fourth page all the crime and scandal
ntories which might involve it in libel
suits. The courts take no judicial
recognition of the "fourth page" which
to them is invisible. However, if a
libelous story slips into another part
tjf the paper, the Japanese law pro
vides that a retraction of at least
equal length and in the same position
must he published.
Some smaller papers with tenden
cies lo blackmail often publish short
libelous stories and then publish re
tractions of several columns, sending
a bill to the injured party for excess
space. The courts will enforce the
right of the paper to collect.
