# FRESHMAN SWIMMERS DEFEATED BY 37-31 SCORE AT BELMONT
## 
### 
Lack of training caused Stanford
freshman swimmers to suffer their
first defeat of the year at the hands
of the Belmont Academy by a 37 to 31
score yesterday at Belmont.
The majority of the first-year pad
dlers had practiced very little since
their last regular meet with Alameda
high school early in the quarter and
were far from being at top form. Bel
mont entered the strongest aggrega
tion that the freshmen have yet met.
The meet was close throughout and
all the races were won by small mar
gins. Belmont started out by taking
the 200-yard relay, but Stanford looked
better when Ted Smith and Johnny
Kenney tied for supremacy in the
diving, letting Donlon of Belmont
down with a poor third. Newhouse in
the plunge and Hanley in the breast
stroke were others who garnered
firsts for the Cards.
At the end of the 220-yard free style

the count was tied at 25 up. Then
the academy proceeded to cinch vic
tory by taking firsts and thirds in the
50-yard back stroke and the 100-yard
free style.
In a 440-yard free style exhibition
race held apart from the meet proper,
Stevenson of Stanford was an easy
victor.
Madero of Belmont walked off with
the individual honors by virtue of vic
tories in the 50-yard back stroke and
the free style race for the same dis
tance.
