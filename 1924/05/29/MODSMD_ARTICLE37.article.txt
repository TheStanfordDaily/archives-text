# Dr. Jordan to Talk on "Japanese Relations''
## 
### 
Objectionable parts of the immigra
tion bill recently signed by President
Coolidge will be discussed by Dr. Jor
dan this evening in his talk on "Our
Relations With Japan."
According to Dr. Jordan the Japa
nese have not broken the Gentlemen's
Agreement in the last sixteen years
and constant agitation on the subject
merely keeps an open sore between
the two countries.
