feut.
Last summer the famous Cardinalj
sprinter went back East to a frater
nity convention. On his way back hej
stopped at Kansas University to visit;
the D. U. brothers and incidentally l
met a pretty Kappa. By the time van
Judah was leaving the Jayhawker uni-j
versity, the Kappa was sufficiently j
interested to go to the train with him !
to see him off.
"All aboa'd!" shouted the porter.
But van Judah was ALL on the plat-'
form.
"Hey, Van, your train!" cried some!
of the D. U. brothers.
Van Judah evidently misunderstood
and thought they said, "Hey, your,
chance, Van!" for he grabbed the j
Kappa and kissed her.
The train, pulling out at the rate of :
fifty yards a minute, was about this :
time 100 yards away. Van Judah did j
a century in :5 tiat, amid wild whoops .
of admiration from the brothers and !
a feminine shriek of "Oh, goodbye, j
Van!"
