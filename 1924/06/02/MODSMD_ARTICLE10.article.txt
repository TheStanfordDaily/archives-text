I?AILURE of Bill Kerr in the mile and of Ted Miller to register a point in
the dash spelled defeat for the Stanford track team in the
1. C. A. A. A. A. meet Saturday.
Yale, with a well-rounded team, nosed out Pennsylvania in the final events
and won by a narrow margin. Yale had 28 points, Pennsylvania 27, Stanford
24%, Princeton 23, Penn State 21, Southern California 14, Johns Hopkins 13%,

»and California and Harvard, 13 each.
"Tiny" Hartranft again proved his
superiority in the weight events when
he took first place in both the shot
and discus, against a strong field of
j weight men. Jim Arthur did the un
| expected and led the field on the first
day with a throw of 154 feet BV2
I inches in the discus. Hartranft was
1 second with 148 feet 3 5-S inches.
Hartranft Goes Wild
In the finals "Tiny" came from be
hind and exceeded the world's record
by more than two feet, winning with
a toss of 158 feet 8 inches. "Bud"
Houser, the U. S. C. ace, overtook Ar
thur and got second with 154 feet 11
inches. Arthur's mark of the first day
stood as third.
In the shot, Hartranft won with a
put of 49 teet 5 7-8 inches. Hills of
Princeton was right on his heels with
49 feet 5 3-8 inches. Houser and An
derson both placed, and Eastman of
Harvard got fifth, nosing out the Cali
fornia entrants.
Hartranft was tied with Hill of
Pennsylvania for high point honors,
each man taking two first places. Hill
was largely responsible for Pennsyl
vania's second place, as he upset the
dope and defeated Clarke of Johns
Hopkins, Bowman of Syracuse, and
Norton, of Yale, all of whom were ex
pected to outdo him in the sprints.
Against this field, Campbell and Hale
of Stanford were unable to place, al
though Campbell qualified in both the
hundred and furlong, and Hale reached
the finals in the 220.
Two Place in Half
All three Stanford entrants qualified
in the half mile, Mcintosh winning his
heat and Swayue and Richardson plac
ing second in theirs. In the finals
Richardson placed third and Mcintosh
was fourth. Watters of Harvard took
first, and Helfrich of Penn State was
second. Helffrich also managed to win
the 440-yard dash a few minutes later.
Hugo Leistner was the only other
Stanford track man to place, the rest
