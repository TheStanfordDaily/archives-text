# STEEPLECHASE IS THRILLER OF FIFTH R. 0. T. C. CONTEST
## Four Riders Dismounted in Race Won by Campbell; Laub Best Rider 
### 
Of the ten events of the Fifth An
nul Stanford Military Horse Show on
the Encina Polo Field Saturday after
noon, the steeplechase, won by J.
Frank Campbell riding Hinds, proved
to be the most spectacular. Out of
eight original contestants only four
succeeded in crossing the finishing
line. Hinds led the nearest competitor
by seven lengths.
The first rider to be dismounted
was thrown on the very first jump,
directly in front of the grandstand.
Three others spilled in quick succes
sion on the fourth, fifth, and sixth
%
jumps. None of the men who were
thrown were injured. Injuries to the
men were prevented chiefly by the
heavy cork polo-helmets which the
military department required contest
ants to wear.
Egbert Laub, by virtue of being
judged the best horseman in the local
unit of the R. O. T. C., was awarded
the Military Science and Tactics cup
for one year. Laub was given stiff
competition by Harold Hjelm and
Cecil Abbott who placed second and
third respectively.
The Cossack race in which the con
testants must ride standing in crossed
stirrups was won by Maywood Brock
way riding Guinard. John Hall, riding
Farr, nosed Ralph Mossman, riding
Sturgis, out of second place by a
small margin. Ed Bye won the Roman
race by a comfortable lead. Bye rode
Janette and Scott, the pair of horses
that have won the event for three
consecutive years.
Two periods of polo were played
by picked Stanford teams. The two
teams lined up as follows: Reds —M.
F. Rose, R. Thomas, \V. H. Taylor,
E. W. Laub; Whites —J. F. Campbell,
Captain E. C. Boyle, R. W. Reticker,
F. E. Steinbeck. The only goal was
made by Rose of the Reds from fifty
yards out during the first period.
The Military department gave rib
bons for the first, second, and third
places and in addition prizes, donated
by San Francisco merchants, were
given the winners in the other events.

Polo hitting contest —M. F. Rose,
first; W. H. Taylor, second; E. Adams,
