"That article 11, section 1, be amended that the spring election of the
A. S. S. U. officers be held the last Tuesday in May unless changed at the
discretion of the Executive Committee, notice to be given a month in ad
vance. This amendment will be retroactive and shall approve and ratify
the elections of May 20, 1924, and May 27, 1924."
Above is the amendment which the students of the University will be
called upon to approve or disapprove, tomorrow. A brief summary
the events which have led up to this proposed measure may help to make
the situation clear. Two weeks ago today a Quad election was held to
choose student officers for next year. At that time no majority vote was
cast for either student body president or 1925 woman representative on
the Executive Committee. Races for three class offices were not decided,
and it was found that one man who had been elected to the Men's
Council was not eligible to hold his position.
Consequently, it became necessary to have a second election, which
was held last Tuesday. At that time, all the vacant offices were filled.
Then it became evident that neither of these elections was valid because
the Executive Committee had changed the date of the first one, when it
had no right to do so.
In other words, at the present time, strictly speaking, the student body
is entirely without officers for next year. And yet, every position was
filled, by a majority vote of the students.
The situation looked bad and no one knew just what would come of it.
The Executive Committee, realizing its mistake, wished to clear up the
matter and very wisely advanced the above amendment as a logical solu
tion. Now it is up to the students to grasp this opportunity to end the
whole disagreeable affair.
If the amendment passes, the officers, who have been fairly elected,
will be allowed to take their positions next year. If the proposed measure
does not pass, the student body will be without officers for next year.
With less than two weeks remaining before final examinations, it would
be practically impossible to hold another election this year. That would
mean that the whole thing would slide over into the Autumn Quarter.
Such a situation would be neither desirable nor fair. In the first place,
many of the students who are on the campus now and are acquainted with
the candidates and their qualifications, will not be back. It would not be
fair to abide by a student vote taken in the absence of those who know
best the qualifications of the candidates.
None of the defeated candidates is desirous of running again, and
nominations next Autumn Quarter would undoubtedly bring out a flock
of new candidates who would thoroughly mess up the situation.
Let us look at this proposition in a sane way, forget our petty pre
judices, and retain the officers who have been legitimately chosen.

the situation clear. Two weeks ago today a Quad election was held to
choose student officers for next year. At that time no majority vote was
cast for either student body president or 1925 woman representative on
the Executive Committee. Races for three class offices were not decided,
and it was found that one man who had been elected to the Men's
Council was not eligible to hold his position.
Consequently, it became necessary to have a second election, which
was held last Tuesday. At that time, all the vacant offices were filled.
Then it became evident that neither of these elections was valid because
the Executive Committee had changed the date of the first one, when it
had no right to do so.
In other words, at the present time, strictly speaking, the student body
is entirely without officers for next year. And yet, every position was
filled, by a majority vote of the students.
The situation looked bad and no one knew just what would come of it.
The Executive Committee, realizing its mistake, wished to clear up the
matter and very wisely advanced the above amendment as a logical solu
tion. Now it is up to the students to grasp this opportunity to end the
whole disagreeable affair.
If the amendment passes, the officers, who have been fairly elected,
will be allowed to take their positions next year. If the proposed measure
does not pass, the student body will be without officers for next year.
With less than two weeks remaining before final examinations, it would
be practically impossible to hold another election this year. That would
mean that the whole thing would slide over into the Autumn Quarter.
Such a situation would be neither desirable nor fair. In the first place,
many of the students who are on the campus now and are acquainted with
the candidates and their qualifications, will not be back. It would not be
fair to abide by a student vote taken in the absence of those who know
best the qualifications of the candidates.
None of the defeated candidates is desirous of running again, and
nominations next Autumn Quarter would undoubtedly bring out a flock
of new candidates who would thoroughly mess up the situation.
Let us look at this proposition in a sane way, forget our petty pre
judices, and retain the officers who have been legitimately chosen.
"That article 11, section 1, be amended that the spring election of the
A. S. S. U. officers be held the last Tuesday in May unless changed at the
discretion of the Executive Committee, notice to be given a month in ad
vance. This amendment will be retroactive and shall approve and ratify
the elections of May 20, 1924, and May 27, 1924."
Above is the amendment which the students of the University will be
called upon to approve or disapprove, tomorrow. A brief summary
the events which have led up to this proposed measure may help to make
the situation clear. Two weeks ago today a Quad election was held to
choose student officers for next year. At that time no majority vote was
cast for either student body president or 1925 woman representative on
the Executive Committee. Races for three class offices were not decided,
