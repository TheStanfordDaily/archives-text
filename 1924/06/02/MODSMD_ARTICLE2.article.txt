# STUDENTS PLANNING EUROPEAN TRIP ARE WARNED BY BUREAU
## 
### 
A warning to students who plan tak
ing third-class passage to Europe this
summer has been sent out by the
Institute of International Education at
New York City to colleges and univer
sities, urging that students be sure
or living arrangements in Europe be
fore they leave this country.
Accommodations are difficult to se
cure, and the arrival of the unusually
large number of students who plan to
take advantage of the new third-class
rates may make a critical situation.
"Ten ships, with a total third-class
carrying capacity of about 8000 per
sons, have thus far entered the student
third-class field for the early summer,"
says Stephen P. Duggan, director of
the Institute, in his letter. "I fear that
if 8000 students are landed in Europe
without pre-arrangement, the situa
tion may have unhappy consequences,
especially for women students."
The British Empire Exhibition, the
Olympic Games, the Bar Convention,
and Advertising Men's Convention,
and other international attractions
have made hotel accommodations in
Paris and London so difficult to se
cure, according to the letter, that the
American Express Company has had
to pay the full amount, two months in
advance, without rebate, for its reser
vations in London.
Third-class student accommodations
have had a sudden growth on account
of the changes in the Immigration Law
which have made it necessary for
large ships to sail with their third
class sections almost empty.
