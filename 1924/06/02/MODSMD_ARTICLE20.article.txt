Last Saturday, two teams of Cardinal track athletes, competing on
opposite sides of the continent, brought glory to Stanford through their
achievements. While one squad fought itself into third place in the I. C.
A. A. A. A. meet at Boston, the other earned a tie for third in the Pacific
Coast Conference meet at Eugene, Oregon. •
From some of the talk that has been going about the campus, it is evi

ory. Those who are discontented undoubtedly lose sight of the fact that
both of those teams were up against very stiff competition. The Daily
Palo Alto is offering no alibis. None is needed, for those athletes gave
all they had and the showing they made were highly creditable, to say the
least.
