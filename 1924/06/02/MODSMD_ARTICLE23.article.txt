Editor Daily Palo Alto,
Dear Sir:
Some uncertainty as to the source
of the recent discussion about giving
uj> sororities has been expressed in
numerous campus rumors. In order to
correct any misinformation which
may be current, the Alumnae Council
of Pan Hellenic wishes to announce
that the question did not come from
the Administration but was presented
to the sororities by the Council after
the Council had met to consider what
would be a wise future policy for the
sororities to follow.
The presentation of the question
does not imply that all of the Council
was necessarily in favor of giving up
the sororities, but it does mean that
011 account of discussion among the
active sorority women themselves and
among the Alumnae, there was need
for the question to be faced squarely
in order to see what was the senti
ment of the sorority women. The
Council has taken the matter to the
houses and the resident alumnae
groups to discuss and consider it. The
Alumnae Council makes a strong plea
to the campus and the community to
allow the women to decide the ques
tion without outside pressure. In a
matter of this kind, the Council feels
sure that the community will allow
fair play if its attention is called to
the need for it.
