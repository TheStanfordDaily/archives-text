# No. 5. LABOR OFFICE
## 
### 
Included in the League of Nations
is an organization which stands apart
from other League organizations, the
International Labor Office. The pur
pose of the Office is to secure and
mtaintain fair and humane conditions
of labor for men, women, and chil
dren; and the well-being—physical,
moral, and intellectual —of industrial
wage-earners. Membership includes
all members of the League and any
others that want to join. Germany is
a member of this body.
The International Labor Office has
its own constitution, based on Article
XIII of the Versailles Treaty, its own
secretariat, draws up its own agenda,
and summons its own conferences.
The General Conference meets once a
year, at which there are four repre
sntatives of each member (two gov
ernment representatives, one repre
sentative of employers, and one repre
sentative of employes). Rpresentatives
vote individually on lal matters. The
Conference produces recommendations
for consideration of members and
drafts conventions which are submit
ted to members for ratification or
other action.
The Governing Body
The Office is controlled by a Gov
erning Body of twenty-four members,
consisting of eight government repre
sentatives from the eight chief indus
trial states; four government repre
sentatives elected by the government
delegates of the rn\aining states; six
employers' and six labor representa
tives, elected respectively by the em
ployer and labor delegates to the In
ternational Labor Office Conference.
The function of the Office is the
collection and distribution of all in
formation relative to labor conditions
throughout the world, and especially
information which the conference
may need. It is essentially an office
for compiling labor information. Ex
penses for the delegates themselves
are paid by the individual govern

ments; all other expenses are paid by
the League.
The agenda for the General Confer
ence must be received four months
before the date of meeting, so that
the Governments Members may ob
ject to certain items which they do
not favor. However, if two-thirds of
the delegates favor taking the matter
up, the objecting government is over
ruled.
Professor W. G. Beach of the Soci
ology department has made the follow
big statement regarding the ivork of the
Labor Office:
Because labor and the products of
labor are international in their com
petition, the welfare of labor needs
international action in order to bring
about uniform standards of protection.
For this purpose the League of Na
tions uses two methods: One is edu
cational, and aims to spread knowl
edge of labor conditions and to de
velop an international understanding
of labor needs. This is the function of
the International Labor Office, whose
journal bulletins and research publica
tions are read all over the world.
The other method is legislative. The
International Labor Conference, meet
ing annually, discusses and adopts
definite pieces of legislation known
either as Conventions or Recommen
dations. Among the Conventions thus
far adopted by the Conference and
already ratified by many of the mem
bers while still being considered by
others, are the eight-hour day and
forty-eight-hour week in industry, pro
hibition of child labor, measures to be
taken in regard to unemployment, pro
tection of health of women and young
persons in regard to dangerous trades
and night.work, equal pay of women
and men for equal work, a code to
govern the employment of seamen.
Without question, the success thus al
ready reached in so few years is
strong evidence of the wisdom as well
as the need of the League as an organ
of international life.

from other League organizations, the
International Labor Office. The pur
pose of the Office is to secure and
mtaintain fair and humane conditions
of labor for men, women, and chil
dren; and the well-being—physical,
moral, and intellectual —of industrial
wage-earners. Membership includes
all members of the League and any
others that want to join. Germany is
a member of this body.
The International Labor Office has
its own constitution, based on Article
XIII of the Versailles Treaty, its own
secretariat, draws up its own agenda,
and summons its own conferences.
The General Conference meets once a
year, at which there are four repre
sntatives of each member (two gov
ernment representatives, one repre
sentative of employers, and one repre
sentative of employes). Rpresentatives
vote individually on lal matters. The
Conference produces recommendations
for consideration of members and
drafts conventions which are submit
ted to members for ratification or
other action.
The Governing Body
The Office is controlled by a Gov
erning Body of twenty-four members,
consisting of eight government repre
sentatives from the eight chief indus
trial states; four government repre
sentatives elected by the government
delegates of the rn\aining states; six
employers' and six labor representa
tives, elected respectively by the em
ployer and labor delegates to the In
ternational Labor Office Conference.
The function of the Office is the
collection and distribution of all in
formation relative to labor conditions
throughout the world, and especially
information which the conference
may need. It is essentially an office
for compiling labor information. Ex
penses for the delegates themselves
are paid by the individual govern

ments; all other expenses are paid by
the League.
The agenda for the General Confer
ence must be received four months
before the date of meeting, so that
the Governments Members may ob
ject to certain items which they do
not favor. However, if two-thirds of
the delegates favor taking the matter
up, the objecting government is over
ruled.
Professor W. G. Beach of the Soci
ology department has made the follow
big statement regarding the ivork of the
Labor Office:
Because labor and the products of
labor are international in their com
petition, the welfare of labor needs
international action in order to bring
about uniform standards of protection.
For this purpose the League of Na
tions uses two methods: One is edu
cational, and aims to spread knowl
edge of labor conditions and to de
velop an international understanding
of labor needs. This is the function of
the International Labor Office, whose
journal bulletins and research publica
tions are read all over the world.
The other method is legislative. The
International Labor Conference, meet
ing annually, discusses and adopts
definite pieces of legislation known
either as Conventions or Recommen
dations. Among the Conventions thus
far adopted by the Conference and
already ratified by many of the mem
bers while still being considered by
others, are the eight-hour day and
forty-eight-hour week in industry, pro
hibition of child labor, measures to be
taken in regard to unemployment, pro
tection of health of women and young
persons in regard to dangerous trades
and night.work, equal pay of women
and men for equal work, a code to
govern the employment of seamen.
Without question, the success thus al
ready reached in so few years is
strong evidence of the wisdom as well
as the need of the League as an organ
of international life.
