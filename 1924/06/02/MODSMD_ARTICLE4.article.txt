# OVERFELT WINS GAME IN CENTRAL TOURNEY
## A. P. O'Kane Defaults to Neer When Leading Stanford Man Three Games 
### 
Harold Overfelt was again victor
ious in his match on Saturday in the
Central California Tournament now be
ing played at Sacramento. Phil Neer,
former captain of the Stanford tennis
team, was saved from elimination from
the tournament by his opponent's de
fault when within one point of winning
the match.
Overfelt had no trouble in defeating
Hobby Benjamin of Oakland 6-1, 6-2.
The match was decidedly one-sided,
Benjamin being unable to find Over
felt's serves or to stop his drives.
Arthur P. O'Kane gaveÂ»the surprise
of the day when he played Phil Neer
off his feet and came within one point
of winning the match, when he de
faulted to allow the former Stanford
man to continue in the tournament.
Neer was caught on an off day, and
O'Kane played a better game than he
has ever displayed in the past. With
the score in the deciding set 5-2 and
40-15 in his favor, lie left the court say
ing that he was too tired to enjoy play
ing any longer in the tournament.
The Central California Championship
is always one of the biggest events of
the year in western tennis and is doubly
so this year, owing to the cancellation
of the Ojai tournament due to the
epidemic of the hoof and mouth disease.
Several of the world's best player#
are in the tournament this year, includ
ing the Australian Davis Cup team,
which will play an exhibition match
here next Wednesday. Bill Johnson
and Peck Grifiin are also in the tour
nament as are the Kinsey brothers.
