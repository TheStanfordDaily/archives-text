# 300 SINGERS IN "ELIJAH" CHORUS HOLD REHEARSAL
## 
### 
1 rpHREE HUNDRED members of the "Elijah" chorus of 500 conducted the
j 1 first stadium rehearsal at Jhe bowl yesterday afternoon and convinced
j Director Warren D. Allen that the first Stanford oratorio ever attempted on
! so great a scale will be' fully up to the hopes of those who planned the
venture, and proved to a number of spectators that the stadium is quite as

i appropriate for a musical production
I of this sort as for a great football
j game.
The acoustic properties of the bowl
' are fully equal to those of San Fran-'
cisco's best theatre, according to
Helen Atkinson, violinist of the San
Francisco Symphony Orchestra, who
bases her belief on instrumental tests
as well as on the effect of the chorus
work yesterday. Wednesday, Miss At
kinson took a violin to the center of
the turf, and with disturbing sounds
from a tractor which was working out
side and other distractions, she played
for a group of friends scattered in the
bleachers. The acoustic qualities, if
anything, were improved over those j
of two years ago when the opera was
j presented in the stadium. The most

delicate notes were heard in fullest
terms at all points in the bowl.
The chorus yesterday was made up
mostly of Mountain View, San Mateo,
Palo Alto, and Stanford members. Full
rehearsals, with the San Francisco
and College of the Pacific sections will
be conducted this week.
