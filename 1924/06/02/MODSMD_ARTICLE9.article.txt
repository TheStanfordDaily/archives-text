# 300 SINGERS IN "ELIJAH" CHORUS HOLD REHEARSAL
## 
### 
1 rpHREE HUNDRED members of the "Elijah" chorus of 500 conducted the
j 1 first stadium rehearsal at Jhe bowl yesterday afternoon and convinced
j Director Warren D. Allen that the first Stanford oratorio ever attempted on
! so great a scale will be' fully up to the hopes of those who planned the
venture, and proved to a number of spectators that the stadium is quite as

i appropriate for a musical production
I of this sort as for a great football
j game.
The acoustic properties of the bowl
' are fully equal to those of San Fran-'
cisco's best theatre, according to
Helen Atkinson, violinist of the San
Francisco Symphony Orchestra, who
bases her belief on instrumental tests
as well as on the effect of the chorus
work yesterday. Wednesday, Miss At
kinson took a violin to the center of
the turf, and with disturbing sounds
from a tractor which was working out
side and other distractions, she played
for a group of friends scattered in the
bleachers. The acoustic qualities, if
anything, were improved over those j
of two years ago when the opera was
j presented in the stadium. The most

delicate notes were heard in fullest
terms at all points in the bowl.
The chorus yesterday was made up
mostly of Mountain View, San Mateo,
Palo Alto, and Stanford members. Full
rehearsals, with the San Francisco
and College of the Pacific sections will
be conducted this week.
Graveure Arrives
Louis Graveure, the distinguished
baritone, aurived in. San Francisco
yesterday, direct from the North
Musical Festival of Northwestern Uni
versity where he sang the same
"Elijah" which he will sing next Sun
day. Graveure is one of the most
popular artists. The full, hearty, and
clear tones of his voice and his per
sonality have earned him many
friends who know little or nothing of
music, while the critics, too, have
| been forced to applaud his ability as
an artist of the concert, opera, and
oratorio.
Graveure will give a recital at the
Oakland Auditorium tomorrow night,
and will then devote the remainder of
the week to preparation for the Stan
ford oratorio.
Harold Procter, tenor, of Los An
geles, is another soloist who has
earned a great following among all
I sorts of music-lovers. The demand for
| his presence at the Shriners' conven
tion in Kansas City is a great testi
monial to his popularity. Procter will
leave Kansas City tomorrow for Palo
Alto.
Internationally Known
Constance Balfour, soprano, of Los
Angeles, and Blanche Hamilton Fox,
contralto, of San Francisco, complete
the group of four soloists. Both have
j international reputations, and have
long records of successful concert,
opera, and oratorio engagements in
the United States and abroad.
Though both artists have studied
extensively in Europe, and have en
joyed excellent success there, both re
gard themselves as strictly American
singers. Miss Balfour is a native of
Michigan, though her present home is
in Los Angeles.
Blanche Hamilton Fox is a product
of the Whitney Opera School of Bos
ton. Olive Downs, who saw her as
"Santussa," wrote, "She was emotion
al in a genuinely latin manner â€”her
interpretation was the best we have
seen at the Boston theatre."
All four leading soloists will take
part in the full "Elijah" rehearsal at
the stadium next Saturday afternoon.
The Board of Athletic Control, han
dling business arrangements for the
opera, announces that tickets are on
sale at the Administration building, at
Crandall's Bookstore, and at the Music
Shop in Falo Alto. Prices are $1.00 for
general admission, or $1.50 for re
served center section stadium seats.

A big "bike" carnival is to be held
at the University of Florida. There
will be prizes given to the winners
of the many events.
