# ANZAC DAVIS CUP TEAM WILL PLAY HERE ON FRIDAY
## Australian Net Squad to Meet Johnston, Griffin, and Two Stanford Men 
### 
One of the best, exhibition matches i
of the year will be played at Stanford
Friday afternoon at 2:30 between!
the Australian Davis Cup team and a
team composed of Bill Johnston, Peck l
Griffin and two members of the Stan
ford varsity, Harold Overfelt and Ted
Mertz.
The Australians are considered one
of the strongest contenders for the j
Davis Cup this year, and therefore
among the world's best tennis players.
Bill Johnston and Peck Griffin will
probably be two of the players on the!
American team, Johnston having been |
on it for the last two years.
Overfelt and Mertz to Play
Harold Overfelt and Ted Mertz will !
probably be the two Stanford players I
to take part in the match. All these !
players, with the exception of Mertz, -
are now in Sacramento playing in the j
Cental California Championship tour- 1
nament.
The Australian team is the strong-1
est that country has produced since ,
the Davis Cup event was started. Of
the four men on the team, O'Hara-:
Wood. Patterson, Kalms, and Schles- j
singer, three are veterans of interna- 1
tional tennis and all are highly ex- 1
perienced players.
Patterson is said to have the world's j
hardest serve, and his ground strokes'
are perfect and almost impossible to
return. O'Hara-Wood has been inter-1
ested in international tennis for many
years and has always distinguished j
himself by his consistently brilliant 1
playing.
Schlessinger was a member of the j
Australian team last year, and Kalms
is a new man. At Stanford the match
es will probably be arranged as fol- {
lows:
O'Hara-Wood vs. Johnston.
Patterson vs. Griffin.
Overfelt vs. Schlessinger.
Kalms vs. Mertz.
