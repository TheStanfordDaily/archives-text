# FRENCH CLUB GIVES ONE-ACT PLAYS TO AID WAR ORPHANS
## 
### 
The Stanford French Club will give
its annual performance for the benefit J
of their two adopted French war or
phans tomorrow night at 8:15 in the;
Little Theatre. The club lias done this
every year since 1917 when they took j
charge of the orphans, and the proceeds I
are the chief means of supporting them, i
The program this year will consist of |
a one-act play, "Les' Marquises de la
Fourchette" by Labiche, and two skits,
"Le Yrai Courage" and "Au Louvre."
These pieces have been choscn because j
of tiieir clever dialogue, interesting sit- i
nations, and Parisian atmosphere.
The first one, "Les Marquises de la I
Fourchette" was produced with great '
success in Paris and is typically French '
in plot. It deals with the encounter in i
a not overly respectable restaurant of a j
young man and his prospective father- I
in-law, each accompanied by a unknown \
young woman.
"Au tlouvre" deals with the troubles j
and possibly embarrassing situations I
that await the visitor in that famous art j
gallery. "Le Vrai Courage" is another |
cafe scene and is redolent with the at
mosphere of the lower parts of Paris.
Cecil Morris, who is directing the
production, says that it should be bet
ter than it has been during the past few
years. The lines are all simple and
easily understood even without any
great knowledge of French. The ac
tions and situations alone would give a
spectator who was unfamiliar with the
language a good idea of what was go- ,
ing on.
Practically all expenses of the per
formance, such as programs, posters, j
and other minor details are donated, ,
and the entire proceeds go to the sup
port of the war orphans. Tickets will
be on sale at the Bookstore and Cran
d all's in Palo Alto.
