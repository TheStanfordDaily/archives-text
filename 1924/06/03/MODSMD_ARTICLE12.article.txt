# Appointment Office Urges Registration of Students
## 
### 
"Evey Stanford student should regis
ter at the appointment office whether
they expect to need immediate aid in
securing a position or not," says Mrs.
E. B. Snell, appointment secretay.
"Registration at the appointment of
fice is permanent," says Mrs. Snell,
"and for this reason we are continu
ally placing Stanford graduates long
after they have finished their courses,
and have no immediate contact with
the University. The appointment of
fice endeavors to keep a complete
record of all those registering with
the office in this way an employer is
often able to find a satisfactory man
or woman for a position from among
Stanford graduates, which he would
not be able to do except for the ap
pointment office."
