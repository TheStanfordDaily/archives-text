And now we have another case of our over-intellectualized civilization
running amuck. A thirteen-year-old school boy is dead and two families
are heart-broken over one of the most appalling incidents known to the
criminal history of the New World.
Two college students, in the Middle West, kidnaped young Robert
Franks, according to their own confession, and murdered him in cold
blood, entirely for the sake of a "thrill." The defense, according to news
paper dispatches, is rallying its forces around a new plea, "dementia jazz
mania," in order to free the confessed murderers.
All the while, the people of the world and especially of the United
States wait with intense interest to see what the outcome of the trial will
be. The two young murderers, both of whom are described as "intellect
ually brilliant" come from extremely wealthy families. They await the
findings of the court confident that they will be cleared, or at least let off
with mild sentences. One of them is said to lie "cocky"—sneeringly con
tent that his punishment will be side-stepped. Unfortunately, he has some
foundation in past history for his confidence.
Under the law of the state in which the case is to be tried, capital pun
ishment could be meted out to the slayers in spite of the fact that they are
not of age. Although neither of the young men is 21. both of them are
old enough yet seemingly not mature enough to realize the enormity of
the crime they committed.
And so, in the last analysis, the whole thing goes back, not entirely to
the murderers themselves, not to the parents, but to our civilization and
system of education. Our system of education, whereby a man's mind—
his intellect—is developed at the expense of his physical and moral strength.
If the body and soul are not nurtured and developed apace with the
mind, there can be no balance. Without balance, ideals are -formed on an
uncertain basis and we cannot be sure that atrocities, even worse than the
one in hand, will not be committed more frequently in the future. The
leaders of tomorrow must have trained minds, but these minds should not
be developed at the expense of a moral sense. Intellects which know noth
ing of human experiences cannot help being warped and twisted.
