# High School Journalism
## 
### 
One of the most pronounced improvements ever recorded in the annals
of journalism has come about within the last few years in the betterment
and enlargement of high school newspapers and magazines. For years
these publications have been but loosely organized, varying in their excel
lence according to the relative merits of the various high school English
departments.
But all this has been changed, and a nation-wide high standard set.
The chief agent in bringing about this improvement in the work of the
younger journalists has been the press associations sponsored by the large
universities. Press conventions held annually at the home of each univer
sity have worked wonders in improving the high school papers of that state.
A brief survey of the country shows such an organization at almost
every large university, among them Michigan, Illinois. Wisconsin, Colum
bia. Leland Stanford and countless others. Colorado and Northwestern
are recent additions to the field. Almost every high school publication in
the country is a member of some such organization.
Hut the chief work done by these associations is not the improvement
of the papers, but the improvement of the journalistic ability of the high
school boys. Instead of "playing" with high school journals, they really
get out creditable sheets—metropolitan papers on a smaller scale. They
learn to appreciate good journalism, their interest is aroused, and when
they reach the universities, they offer good material for the various jour
nalism departments to train. Many famous editors began to apprecaite
the value of good journalism in high school.
The value of starting a child's education at an early age is recognized.
The profession that catches his childish fancy often turns out to be his
life work. For this reason, if for no other, the work being done by the
interscholastic press associations in stimulating and improving high school
journalism by competition and constructive criticism, is well worth the
time and attention it demands.—Michigan Daily.
