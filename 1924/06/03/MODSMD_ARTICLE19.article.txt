## An Introduction to Poetry 
### REVIEWED BY MARGARET MILLER 
Raymond McDonald Aldrn
One of the moat valuable books for
those interested in English literature
is Alden's "Introduction to Poetry."
Chief among its attractions is the fact
that its organization permits one to
take up any part at any time, and the
sections may be read in various orders.
The manual is based on the belief
that it mußt be made clear even to
elementary students, that the two ele
ments of rhythm—time and accent,
must receive equal attention.
The material consists of a defini
tion and classification of poetry, a dis
cussion of the internal and external
basis of poetry, and a discussion of
English metres and rhyme and stanza
forms.
The book is used as a textbook in
courses in the English department.
