# CHAPPIE SECOND IN NATIONAL CONTEST OF COLLEGE COMICS
## Individual Prize Awarded to Carl Shoup; Ely Second With Most Copy 
### 
With the close of Judge's College
Wits Contest the Old Boy Chappie
found himself just ninety points shy
of taking first place and with that
honor conceded the University of
Pennsylvania Punch Bowl.
Carl Shoup won the permanent cup
for the best literary contribution with
"Mike" Ely, winner of last year's
trophy, running second. "Mike" was
awarded honorable mention, as more
contributions were accepted from him
than from any other individual, three
of his longer articles being used in
addition to several short jokes.
The trophy awarded the Punch Bowl
has been in the possession of the
Chaparral for the past year and since
its origination in 1920 it has also won
for year periods by Columbia Jester
once and Cornell Widow twice. In
order to become permanent property
it must be won three times by the
same college.
The cup for the best artistic contri
bution went to Will W. Friffen of
Northwestern University for his full
page drawing, a fantastic representa
tion of student life going back to the
days of the Stone Age man.
Of the College Wits issue published
last week Judge says: "The issue has
resulted in the discovery of an abun
dance of new literary and artistic
talent. The work was well above the
quality average of older and more
experienced professional writers in
most cases and in all it was most
successful.
