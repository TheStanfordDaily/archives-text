## 
### 
l.ec Emerson Bassett
In this volume, clear understanding
is made the basis of sane, convincing
speech, in an effort to emphasize the
value of knowing the principles of
natural expressive reading aloud. It
is based on the theory that effective
oral expression is the result of clear
thinking.
This text differs from others In
method of treatment: the exercises
are at the end, on the ground that ex
pression is concerned primarily with
ideas.
The student is given the opportunity
for practice in expressing his own
ideas in his own words. The author
discusses the clearness of meaning,
impressiveness, and the principles of
ease and correctness in connection
with emphasis on reading aloud as an
essential factor in education.
In addition to use as a text in Stan
ford University, the book is used by
the University of California, the Uni
versity of Wisconsin, Columbia, the
University of Pennsylvania, and the
College of the City of New York.
