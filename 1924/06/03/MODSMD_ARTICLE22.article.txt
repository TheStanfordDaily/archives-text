About 500 B. C. the first world's series was held, the contestants being the
husky nine from Greece and the brilliant but erratic team from Mt. Olympus.
It was a battle of mind and matter, and as usual there was something the
matter and the heavy thinkers got the worst of it. The game was played on
the Elysian fields, a huge crowd sitting on the Parthenon shouting, "Adaboy,
Agamemnon," "You know me, Alexander," "or "Oh, Minerva," as the occasion
arose.
Jupiter Pluvius was driven to the showers in the Bth inning of the final
game, but Homer made a classic whiff with the bases full. Then Bob Phidias
brought the winning runs over with a timely single. This hit, catching Apollo
in his temple, completely knocked the percentage columns from under Mt.
Olympus.
Bacchus, dispensing soft drinks, with Tobaccus, who sold smokes, got into
an argument with Socrates, who wanted a drink of hemlock.
The Line-Up
