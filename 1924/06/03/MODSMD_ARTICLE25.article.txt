# No. 6. AALAND ISLANDS
## 
### 
Forming the westernmost group of
the Finnish archipelago, the Aaland
Islands are situated about midway be
tween the Swedish and Finnish main
land. Soon after the Russian Revolu
tion resulted in the separation of Fin
land from Russia, the inhabitants of
these islands manifested an all but
unanimous desire to become Swedish,
and Sweden supported their claim to
settle the matter by a plebiscite, thus
bringing herself into a direct contro
versy with Finland.
The ensuing quarrel was embitter
ing the relations between the two
countries when the British Govern
ment drew the attention of the Coun
cil to the matter. In doing so, Great
Britain was exercising her "friendly
right," under Article XI of the Cove
nant of the League of Nations. Fin
land claimed that the League could
not intervene, as this was a domestic
issue, and therefore a matter for in
ternal jurisdiction.
The question would nowadays pre
sumably be referred to the Permanent
Court of International Justice for an
opinion, but as the Court did not then
exist, the Council, after hearing the
representatives of both Finland and
Sweden, appointed a committee of
jurists. This committee decided that
the matter was of international im
portance and hence within the Coun
cil's competence.
The Council then appointed a com
mittee to make a report on the whole
question. This committee, after ex
haustive study and a visit to the spot,
reported that the Aaland Islands were
indisputably under Finnish sovereign
ty and belonged to Finland on his
torical and geographical grounds. The
Council decided on the merits of the
case and in favor of an unrecognized
state, Finland. The final decision was
that the Islands were to be demili
tarized, and the League was to see

Jthat the guaranteed neutrality of the
Islands was upheld.
Professor J'. A. Colder of the History
department, when interviewed regarding
the Aaland Islands question, made tlfe fol
loiving statement:
"The two 'leading nationalities in
Finland are the Finns and the Swedes,
! the one in the' eastern part of the
state, the other in the western, includ
ing the Aaland Islands in the Gulf of
Bothnia. Though speaking different
languages, these two peoples have the
| same religion, the same culture, and
| pretty much the same institutions.
; For centuries they together
and have intermarried and neither na
tionality has in any offensive way
tried to domineer over the other.
"The Bolshevik Revolution was fol
lowed by civil war in Finland, and
the islanders, to escape the conflict,
voted to break away from Finland and
unite with Sweden. Some of the voters
were undoubtedly influenced by the
fact that Finland was dry and Sweden
wet. Finland protested against* this
separatist movement, and pointed out
that if the question were to be decided
on the basis of self-determination, it
should be done by the Swedes of Fin
land as a whole and not by a mere
handful of them (25,000 out of 400,-
000:).
"Sweden and Finland referred the
question to the League of Nations for
settlement. After listening to the argu-
I nients on both sides the League on
June 24, 1921, decided that the sover
eignty of the islands belonged to Fin
land and recommended that certain
I guarantees be given the islanders.
These conditions were accepted and
i lived up to by Finland. This decision
was both just and tactful and left no
ill-feeling behind it. By taking the
J question into its hands and handling
; it so skilfully and fairly, the League
has rendered a distinct service to
mankind."

"Sweden and Finland referred the
question to the League of Nations for
settlement. After listening to the argu-
I nients on both sides the League on
June 24, 1921, decided that the sover
eignty of the islands belonged to Fin
land and recommended that certain
I guarantees be given the islanders.
These conditions were accepted and
i lived up to by Finland. This decision
was both just and tactful and left no
ill-feeling behind it. By taking the

Tomorrow: "The Silesian Question."
Forming the westernmost group of
the Finnish archipelago, the Aaland
Islands are situated about midway be
tween the Swedish and Finnish main
land. Soon after the Russian Revolu
tion resulted in the separation of Fin
land from Russia, the inhabitants of
these islands manifested an all but
unanimous desire to become Swedish,
and Sweden supported their claim to
settle the matter by a plebiscite, thus
bringing herself into a direct contro
versy with Finland.
The ensuing quarrel was embitter
ing the relations between the two
countries when the British Govern
ment drew the attention of the Coun
cil to the matter. In doing so, Great
Britain was exercising her "friendly
right," under Article XI of the Cove
nant of the League of Nations. Fin
land claimed that the League could
not intervene, as this was a domestic
issue, and therefore a matter for in
ternal jurisdiction.
The question would nowadays pre
sumably be referred to the Permanent
Court of International Justice for an
opinion, but as the Court did not then
exist, the Council, after hearing the
representatives of both Finland and
Sweden, appointed a committee of
jurists. This committee decided that
the matter was of international im
portance and hence within the Coun
cil's competence.
The Council then appointed a com
mittee to make a report on the whole
question. This committee, after ex
haustive study and a visit to the spot,
reported that the Aaland Islands were
indisputably under Finnish sovereign
ty and belonged to Finland on his
torical and geographical grounds. The
Council decided on the merits of the
case and in favor of an unrecognized
state, Finland. The final decision was
that the Islands were to be demili
tarized, and the League was to see

Jthat the guaranteed neutrality of the
Islands was upheld.
Professor J'. A. Colder of the History
department, when interviewed regarding
the Aaland Islands question, made tlfe fol
loiving statement:
"The two 'leading nationalities in
Finland are the Finns and the Swedes,
! the one in the' eastern part of the
state, the other in the western, includ
ing the Aaland Islands in the Gulf of
Bothnia. Though speaking different
languages, these two peoples have the
| same religion, the same culture, and
| pretty much the same institutions.
; For centuries they together
and have intermarried and neither na
tionality has in any offensive way
tried to domineer over the other.
"The Bolshevik Revolution was fol
lowed by civil war in Finland, and
the islanders, to escape the conflict,
voted to break away from Finland and
unite with Sweden. Some of the voters
were undoubtedly influenced by the
fact that Finland was dry and Sweden
wet. Finland protested against* this
separatist movement, and pointed out
that if the question were to be decided
on the basis of self-determination, it
should be done by the Swedes of Fin
land as a whole and not by a mere
handful of them (25,000 out of 400,-
000:).
