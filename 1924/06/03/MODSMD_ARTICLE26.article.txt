## 
### 
Another cup has been added to the
Stanford athletic tophies by the suc
cessful season of the fencing team.
By winning two championships the
team was entitled to two cups, but
Coach Harry Maloney arranged it so
that the amount that would have been
expended fo the two cups was used
for the purchase of one larger cup
inscribed with the both honors.
The team, composed of Bugge, De
Cassotte, Smith, Wallace, and Captain
Gardner, won both the Northern Cali
fornia Team Elimination Champion
ship and the Pacific Coast Division
of the A. P. L. A. In winning these
championships the geatest competition
came from the teams of the Athens
Club of Oakland, the Italia Virtus, the
Olympic Club, and the U. S. I. The
only defeat of the season was suf
fered at the L. A. A. C. during the
spring vacation. The two champion
ships were won in the early part of
April.
