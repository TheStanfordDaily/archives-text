# COMMENCEMENT DAY ANNOUNCEMENTS ARE ON SALE TOMORROW
## 
### 
Candidates for degrees to be award
ed on June 23 may secure commence
ment announcements by calling at the
office of the Alumni Secretary, up
stairs in the Administration building,
on Wednesday, or shortly thereafter.
J. E. McDowell is taking charge of
distributing the announcements, pro
grams, and the signing of the class
roll.
The commencement announcements
this year are a departure from the
"invitations" which have been sent out
by all former senior classes. Inasmuch
as there is no possibility of any stu
dent getting more than two or three
tickets for the exercises to be held in
the Memorial Church, it was felt by
the committee in charge that the word
j ing on the announcements should be
revised so as to exclude all pretense
of invitation, and thus stay close to
i the idea of a simple announcement.
This has been done, and the new
forms read as follows:
"Stanford University annouuc.es its
j thirty-third annual commencement.
! Graduation of the Class of Nineteen
j Twenty-Four. Monday, June twenty
! third, Nineteen hundred and twemy
j four."
| Thus the announcements are as suit
j able for those who are to receive ad
vanced degrees, and are not members
of the '24 class, as they are for the
seniors; furthermore, any number of
i them may be sent out to friends and
relatives, as they do not imply an
! invitation, but merely state the fact
j of commencement.
The announcements are also differ
( ent from preceding ones in having the
| seal of the University stamped on
! them in silver. The engraving is done
! trom Malloy type, a new species of
i engraver's print invented last year
j and awarded first prize at the meeting
of the engravers' national association.
In order that the personal cards,
which are usually enclosed with the
: announcements when mailing them,
may be of the same time, orders for
these cards will be taken by the Class
jof 1924 at McDowell's office at the
! same time the announcements them
' selves are purchased. These orders
will be lilled promptly by Alf Nelson
of San Jose, who engraved the 3600
' announcements. In case any should
desire type other than the Malloy
style, a complete sample list of the
various types available, and the cost
; of each, will be on display at McDow
! ell's office.
The cost of the announcemnts is
the same as in previous yearsâ€”fifteen
! cents apiece or two for twenty-five
cents. This includes both the inside
: and outside envelopes that come with
each announcement form.
