# NEW LINE OF STARS WILL APPEAR IN "BOOMERANG"
## New Talent Chosen for Skill In Mannerisms Which Fit Part in Play 
### 
"Hunches," in the cloosing of a
cast, are the least important items to
be considered, is the opinion of A. U.
Cohan, who is now moulding a group
of actors and actresses into a smooth
running organization for "The Boom
erang."
"However," says Cohan, "this time
proved rather an exception as several
of the tryoutees were chosen for some
little act or mannerism that seemed
to fit them for the play." Bill Ham
mond, for instance, who plays the part
of Bud Woodridge, the lovesick young
man, besides showing a great deal of
talent, presents almost the identical
character that the part was written
for. He should prove one of the "hits"
of the show if ajl present expectations
and hunches run true to form.
"Experience" Counts
Another tryoutee gained his part by
a little subtle humor. By way of ex
perience in past performances, he
stated that once lie had played the
part of a Roman soldier in a mob
scene in a high school play and other
"equally heavy roles." After being re
jected for several years in everything
he had tried out for on the campus
stage, he was rather disappointed and
that this was positively his last per
formance before the leering footlights.
John Wiggin, playing the part of
Emile, the French valet and general
utility man, gained his place, not by
any "hunch," but by real merit. With
his voice and ability for character
portrayal he promises to be one of the
outstanding campus footlight heroes
before he leaves.
Botsford Shows Possibilities
Another "hunch" as to who will
prove a hit in the show tends to lean
towards Carol Botsford, playing the
part of Virginia Xelva, the charming
Swiss-American. Those who have seen
Mary Newcoiube on the professional
stage will see her again when Miss
Botsford comes under the glare of the
arc light after her first cue.
