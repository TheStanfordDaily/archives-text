'THAT the conditions in the Philippines are such that independent govern
ment on the part of those islands would be disastrous, is the opinion held
by Theodore Zschokke, who has been residing in the Philippines during the
last sixteen years,
Zschokke, who was a member of the class of '99, has been in the forestry
service in the Philippines since 1907. He has also taught in the forestry
schools in the islands. Zschokke, who has been visit ng his mother in Palo

Alto for six months, has now left fors
work in Hawaii.
"There are two classes of people in
the Philippines making the racial
unity of the islands impossible," said
Zschokke. First, we have the moun
taineers, pagans, who are surrounded
by Christians in the lowlands and who,
while small in numbers, are very im
portant. The hatred between the
mountaineer and lowland Christian is
intense. In the south are the Moham
medans or Moros who carry their re
ligious prejudices to extremes and de
spise the Filipinos.
"Under Governor Harris' regime the
Moro province was turned over to the
government of the Philippines who

$
had neither the sympathy nor the
ability to understand the Moros. The
friction resulting has been intoler
able. The Moros are protesting against
the unfairness of being governed by
an alien race which at the same time
is demanding independence. The
Moros need training and education
before independence.
"The third factor against unity is
the fact that thirty-eight languages
are spoken in the islands. There are
eight large groups speaking eight dis
tinct languages; these groups are so
large that their members are not
obliged to learn any other language
