# Independence for Philippines Disastrous, Says Zschokke, '99
## 
### Esther Greenacre 
'THAT the conditions in the Philippines are such that independent govern
ment on the part of those islands would be disastrous, is the opinion held
by Theodore Zschokke, who has been residing in the Philippines during the
last sixteen years,
Zschokke, who was a member of the class of '99, has been in the forestry
service in the Philippines since 1907. He has also taught in the forestry
schools in the islands. Zschokke, who has been visit ng his mother in Palo

Alto for six months, has now left fors
work in Hawaii.
"There are two classes of people in
the Philippines making the racial
unity of the islands impossible," said
Zschokke. First, we have the moun
taineers, pagans, who are surrounded
by Christians in the lowlands and who,
while small in numbers, are very im
portant. The hatred between the
mountaineer and lowland Christian is
intense. In the south are the Moham
medans or Moros who carry their re
ligious prejudices to extremes and de
spise the Filipinos.
"Under Governor Harris' regime the
Moro province was turned over to the
government of the Philippines who

$
had neither the sympathy nor the
ability to understand the Moros. The
friction resulting has been intoler
able. The Moros are protesting against
the unfairness of being governed by
an alien race which at the same time
is demanding independence. The
Moros need training and education
before independence.
"The third factor against unity is
the fact that thirty-eight languages
are spoken in the islands. There are
eight large groups speaking eight dis
tinct languages; these groups are so
large that their members are not
obliged to learn any other language
save English or Spanish.
Zschokke stated that independence
is out of the question when one con
siders the graft in land dealing which
is rampant in the islands. The weak
ness of the native In opposition to
profiteers is easily understood when
it is known that fifty-three per cent of
the men old enough to vote can
neither read nor write. Three per cent
of the land is held under titles on
which the banks will loan money.
Seven per cent is held under incom
plete titles, and ninety *per cent is
claimed because of unpaid taxes. The
ninety per cent of the landholders are
at the mercy of money lenders, who
demand five per cent a month for any
loan secured by such land. The gov
enment is trying to break up the
usurers by establishing local rural
credit societies, but the people have
such little knowledge that they loan
money to a few prominent individuals
who reloan it to those whom the so
ciety was intended to benefit.
Thousands of acres in the Cagayan
valley, the heart of the tobacco sec
tion, have been illegally declared for
taxation in the last three years. The
Philippine government in settling land
titles is handicapped by lack of sur
veyors and suitable laws punishing
those who occupy public land illegally.
Zschokke stated that, as long as such
conditions exist, it is impossible for a
stable, independent government to
exist.
"It is obvious that the only firm
independent government which could
succeed now in the Philippines would
be an autocracy," said Zschokke. "In
fact, in every town of any size, unof
ficial autocracy already exists. Each
town is governed by one or more
wealthy persons known to the natives
as 'caciques,' the Mexican word for
chief.
"The American government has
made two mistakes in regard to
Philippines. First, the Philippines have
been promised independence and
stable government without a defini
tion of the underlying principles. The
mere fact that salaries are paid on
time and that no civil war has occur
red are evidences of a stable govern
ment. Secondly, the Philippine ques
tion has been made a political issue
in the United States. As a matter of
fact, when analyzed, the platforms of
the two parties on this subject are but
little different, but to make campaign
material each leader interprets the
platform to suit his own ideas. As a
consequence independence is made
the issue in even local campaigns in
the islands. The average Philippine
voter is convinced that to vote against
the party in power is to vote against
the government. The party in power is
not held responsible for the local de
velopment of the government.
Zchokke stated that the condition
of the schools in the Philippines is, in
contrast to the independence propa
gandists' reports, very poor. Many of
the teachers are but graduates of the
public schools. The schools have been
pushed faster thau the number of
teachers has warranted. In spite of the
forced increase in the number of
schools, there are more pupils without
educational facilities than there are
in the schools.
"Until the majority of the popula
tion of school age has the benefit of
education, it cannot be said that the
people have the educational qualifica
tions for self-government," concluded
Zschokke.

Tuesdays and Thursdays are the
days set aside for the seniors at the
University of Michigan to wear caps
and gowns. This is a tradition which
originated to make them more at home
in their academic dress at commence
ment.
