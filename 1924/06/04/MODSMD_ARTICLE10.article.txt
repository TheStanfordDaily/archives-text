# FOSSIL SEAL, TWO MILLION YEARS OLD, IS GIVEN STANFORD
## 
### 
A fossil seal that is estimated to be
more than two million years old has
recently come into the possession of
the Stanford Zoology department. The
age of the seal can be easily estimated
because of its formation and because
it is a hair seal of a type of the plioca
genii that has long been extinct.
This family of seal owes its descent
to the otter whereas the common seal
or sea lion is a descendant of the bear.
It can be easily identified by its pe
culiar flipper and as this is plainly
visible on the fossil there can be abso
lutely no mistake as to the identity.
It is a Diatom fossil. The Diatom is
the smallest known plant and the indi
vidual plants can only be seen under
the strongest miscroscopes. It is sup
posed that the seal became entangled
in some way and these plants congre
gated around him. The fossil is one of
the most perfect that the department
possesses.
The fossil was unearthed at a depth
of fourteen hundred feet by Edward
P. Starr, manager of the Selite quarry
at Lompoc in Santa Barbara county,
and sent by him to Dr. Jordan. Mr.
Starr has at previous times sent more
than eight very fine specimens of fos
sil fish to the University.
