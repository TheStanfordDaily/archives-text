## 
### 
The shortage of brass knuckles and
rosin is about to cause serious hiatus
in the evaluation of the local bivalves,
due to the demand made for equip
ment made upon the Palo Alto hard
ware merchants on the occasion of
that event which happens but once in
the lifetime of a moth—the Last Dance
of the Year. k
The informality of the brawl is quite
terrific, according to those members
of Hammer and Coffin who have been
in a position to know.
However, this dance will be Differ
ent; everything about it will be differ
ent, with the exception of a reduction
of four dollars on the usual price of
such occasions: this time the admis
sion will be free, with the exception
of one dollar war tax. Other differ
ences will be that the roof of the Wo
men's Clubhouse will be removed pre
vious to the celebration, although the
date, Friday, June G, is to be closed
and padlocked.
The Whitmer Augmented Combina
tion Orchestra will be run out at 12
a.m.
