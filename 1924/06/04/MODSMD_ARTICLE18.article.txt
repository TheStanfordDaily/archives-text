### 
Stanford students will have an opportunity next Sunday to support
something a great deal different from the average performances they
attend. "Elijah," an oratorio of high merit, which will boast of some
of the very best musical talent available, will be presented in the
Stanford stadium.
The performance, coming as it does at the end of the college year
and a week before final examinations, should draw a large crowd of
students. Stanford is the first University in the West to attempt such
a production. Like projects have been successful n the larger Eastern
universities and there is no reason why they should not receive student
support at Stanford.
The prices are popular, and with the stadium as a setting, the produc
tion should be a highly desirable afternoon's entertainment for any
student who appreciates music.
