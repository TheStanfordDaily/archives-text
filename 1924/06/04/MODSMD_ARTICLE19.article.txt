NOW THAT Chappie has seen fit to cast bouquets in the direction
of the Daily Palo Alto office, the Daily gathers up the assortment of
onions, carrots, turnips, and other flowers and retires gracefully within
the "editorial sanctum.''
Unfortunately, the Daily Palo Alto is edited largely by human
beings, and hence, is prone to make mistakes. Chappie doesn't make em.
He couldn't, and make such a hit with Judge two years in a row.
All of which brings us down to the point of this comment. Chappy
is a pretty good scout after all. lie has gotten out a mighty creditable
magazine this year and deserves much applause for his efforts. Con
gratulations to you, Old Boy, and all the luck in the world to you in
your campaign to clean up campus journalism.
