# Political Clubs

### 
With the ever-increasing importance of national politics, the leaders of
the several parties have attempted various methods and modes of attack
by which they may strengthen their following. The latest development
along this line has been the organization of political clubs at the various
colleges and universities of the state. Some colleges have two or more
such organizations among the undergraduates and the discussions, led
by men of national repute in political circles, have been instructive and
interesting.
In this way an opportunity has been presented the college man to learn
more al>out politics, parties, and platforms in general. These clubs
should, first of all, be instituted with the main purpose of developing and
fostering a greater interest among college men toward matters of civic
nature. From this standpoint they are a good thing and are worthy of
institution and support by every American college. Such organizations
should seek to be instructive in their nature and work toward the better
ment of state and national politics. They should also be, in a more or
less degree, non-partisan in their attitude; their function being to present
the issues and policies in question, together with critical comments on
the records and platform of the parties and candidates. Hence the
organization is broad and can be utilized for the mutual advantage of all
students, whatever tie their political convictions.
A report from good sources indicates that Pennsylvania ranks first
among eastern states in the organization of political clubs within the
colleges and universities. The organization of political clubs at Penn
State, such as are existent at other Pennsylvania institutions, would
afford the undergraduates an opportunity to prepare for a more active
citizenship after graduation.—Penn State Collegian.
