## 
### 
Dr. W. M.'Alden of the English de
partment, who has been in the East
teaching at Columbia University all
this winter, is beginning to show some
improvement after a long and serious
illness.
Dr. Alden was taken ill in the latter
part of April and has not been able
to go on with his work since then.
The doctors have not found the exact
cause of the trouble. He seems to be
very slowly recovering.
