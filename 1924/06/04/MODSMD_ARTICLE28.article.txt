# SPORTS OF 1924

### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Here is Loren Murchison, one of America's hopes in the 100 and 200 metre
runs and 400 metre relay for the forthcoming Olympic games. Loren, who
now competes for the Newark A. C., formerly ran for the Illinois and then
the New York Athletic Clubs. He was selected by Fred Rubien for the All-
American athletic team of 1923 in four events —the 60, 100, 220, and 300 yard
dashes, the first time any runner has been so honored. Murchison is best at
indoor racing, where he holds several world's records, but outdoors he has
scored many notable victories, chief among them being a clean-cut win over
Scholz, Paddock, and Kirksey in the 1920 Olympic tryouts in the 100 metre
run. At the Antwerp Olympiad four years ago "Murch" had hard luck, for at
the start of the finals of the 100 metres he had the misfortune to be left at
the post. A Belgian official told him to move his fingers back onto the white
chalk line. Loren started to stand up—and the gun went off!
Murchison is a beautiful runner, with a good high knee action and a perfect
arm motion. He will be hard to beat.
