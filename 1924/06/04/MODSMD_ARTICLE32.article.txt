The Origin of Van Judah's Spurt
Nelson Van Judah was a mediocre
two-mile runner in his prep school
days. He Beldom placed closer than
third in that event and was generally
listed among those who "also ran."
One year his school was well on its
way to the local championship, and
eventually the crucial meet of the i
series was held. The town turned out
en masse to see the affair in spite of
the screaming headlines of the morn- {
ing papers telling about the dense fog
; which was apt to wreak havoc with i
the event. This fog was the making
' of Van Judah.
Van Judah had barely completed his
: seventh lap when three other runners
finished. When he failed to appear
after an interval, the officials started
off a large bunch of runners for the
440. Near the last turn, the humiliated
i Van Judah became aware of the
i others. Already having a good second
: wind, he put on a stiff spurt and
; reached the tape ahead of the regu
lars. The confused timers, blindfolded
by the fog, gave him five units of
credit on the score sheet. Thus en
: couraged, he developed into a consis-
I tent quarter-miler.
