# No. 7. SILESIAN QUESTION
## 
### 
Under the terras of the treaty of
Versailles, the district known as Upper
Silesia was to be partitioned between
Germany and Poland in accordance
with a plebiscite, and with due regard
to the economic and geographical na
ture of the region. •
There is a significant political im
portance attached to the region. In
the first place, the coal mines there
are large and produce the very best
quality coal. Before the war the status
of Silesia was essentially German; In
fact, it produced about one-fourth of
the coal used in Germany. In the set
tlement, the French, of course, wanted
to see Poland get the region in which
the mines were located, so that Ger
many would lose the coal which she
so sorely needed along with her iron
ore. The other point of view was that
German would exploit the mines, thus
helping her to pay her reparations.
(Everyone knew that Poland would
not have the initiative to develop the
mines as Germany would.)
The plebiscite taken was not good,
because the cities voted for control
by Germany, while the country voted
for control by Poland. A little over 60<
per cent of the votes were for Ger
many, and a little less than 40 per
cent for Poland. Thus the Supreme
Council (a body acting under the
treaty and having no connection with
the League) found itself unable to
agree as to how the area was to be
partitioned.
Accordingly, on August 12, 1921, it
asked the Council of the League to
examine the question. After two
months of hard work, involving con
sultation of all elements of the Upper
Silesian population, the Council pro
duced a unanimous recommendation,
which was submitted to the Supreme
Council.
The Supreme Council approved the
scheme and asked the Council to get
Poland and Germany to agree upon it.
The negotiations, lasting over nine
months, were concluded at Geneva.
The Convention, which is probably
the longest diplomatic document on
record, certainly longer than the Ver
sailles Treaty, contains 606 articles
and establishes a very full and elabo
rate system of cultural, economic, so
cial, and technical guarantees. A
mixed Commission watches over the
administration of this system, and an

tribunal adjudicates cases of
dispute between Poland and Germany
as to the interpretation or application
of clauses of the Convention. The Con
vention furthermore provides for the
Permanent Court of International Jus
tice being used as a court of appeal
j in certain cases.
Professor Ralph Lutz of the History
department 'makes the folloiving sum
mary of foreign and local opinion con
cerning the Silesian question :
The recommendation of the Council
,in the Silesian question satisfied at
i first neither Poland nor Germany,
i Both countries took exceptions to the
I plan of the League for the partition
| of Upper Silesia.
The Council's action was received
in Germany with almost universal dis
approbation. It was declared to be a
violation of Germany's natural rights
,as well as of the treaty of Versailles.
The naturalists denounced it as politi
! cal and economic nonsense, while even
the liberals exclaimed that this recom
mendation would end all German re
spect for the Council. •
Many German critics believed that
England had supported this plan be
cause of her desire to control the zinc
output of Upper Silesia. Summing up
the German view Walther Schotte
1 stated, "The decision of Geneva has
buried all hopes which have been
placed for Upper Silesia in the League
of Nations."
A study of the Polish press review
for this period reveals the astonishing
' fact that Poland was disappointed with
1 the decision and had actually hoped
for more territory "in Silesia. Certain
Polish critics asserted that Polish in
' terests had been sacrificed by France
in order to maintain the Anglo-French
entente. In all criticisms the fear is
expressed of ultimate German action
against this partition.
Of significance to Americans is the
fact that this international question
arose largely out of the steady Polish
immigration to German Silesia. The
solution of this problem in the Con
vention is a great diplomatic triumph
for the League of Nations. Of greatest
importance in the settlement of future
international disputes, is the system
of cultural and economic guarantees
established by this Convention.
Tomorrow: "Vilna Dispute."
