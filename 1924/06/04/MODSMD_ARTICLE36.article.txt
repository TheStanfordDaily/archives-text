# O. A. C. MAKES JUNIOR WEEK AN ALL-CAMPUS AFFAIR
## 
### 
The junior week-end of former years
was this year replaced by a campus
week-end, at the Oregon Agricultural
College. Hereafter this will be made
an annual affair. A track meet with
the University of Oregon, a campus?
luncheon, an outdoor dance on the
cement tennis courts, junior vaude
ville, and the distribution of the 1925
Beavers, the college year book, were
features of the week-end.
