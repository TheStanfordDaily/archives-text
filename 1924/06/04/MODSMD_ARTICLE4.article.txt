# DR. THORNDIKE SAYS SUBJECT ENJOYED IS MENTAL DISCIPLINE

"It is not what we do with aversion
j that gives us the best mental disci
! pline, but what we enjoy," said Dr.
j E. L. Thorndike last evening in his
' talk 011 "Mental Discipline."
He performed an experiment on the
| audience and used it as the basis of
j his discussion. A list of English litera
] ture, English composition, history,
algebra, geometry, Latin, or any other
I foreign language, and science, was
| given with three columns against it â€”
general intellectual training, general
j character training, and interest. The
i Audience was asked to fill in the three
j columns from one to seven in the
| order in which each individual felt
the various subjects had filled for him
the stated functions. A standing vote
was taken which showed the majority
put English literature and science
first, gaining least from the abstracts,
I mathematics and Latin. The majority
| also felt they had gained general in
| tellectual training from the subjects
which they had enjoyed the most.

"This is contrary to all educational
tradition," Dr. Thorndike continued.
"Teachers in the past have been con
vinced the more barren of rich detail
a subject, the better mental training
I it was." He maintained that the reason
j the abstracts stood high in the char*
j acter building column was the element
i of force. "Had athletics stood on the
| list, it would have been first on the
| character building list," he said,
"since we agree with the ancient
Greeks and the modern British that
sports and games are the finest char
acter molders we have."
He described a test made on 8500
high school children from May, 1922,
to May, 1923. The children were ex
amined at the beginning and end of
the period with standard intelligence
tests and were marked for gain. It
was found that white children gained
much more than colored, and that the
proportion of gain depended on initial
ability rather than on choice of studies. J
The latter had some influence, but out
as great as is commonly supposed.
