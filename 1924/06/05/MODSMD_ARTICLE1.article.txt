# STANFORD WILL LEAD WEST IN STAGING 'ELIJAH'
## Mendelssohn's Oratorio Has Wide Appeal; Four Artists, Large Chorus Sing 
### 
"Elijah," the oratorio to be pre
sented at 3 o'clock next Sunday after
noon in the Stanford stadium, will be
the greatest production of its kind
ever attempted by a Western univer
sity.
Large musical productions have
been staged by eastern colleges and
universities, among them the North
Musical Festival of Northwestern Uni
versity. Stanford will be the first in
stitution in the West to sponsor such
an undertaking. During the war the
Camp Fremont music festival, staged
on the old Stanford football field, at
tracted 18,000 people. A huge crowd
of people from this part of the state
should throng the stadium Sunday.
Has Dramatic Situations
Mendelssohn's "Elijah" offers an
appeal to everyone. It contains numer
ous dramatic situations and is well
organized. In addition to an excellent
score, the oratorio boasts a chorus of
500 voices, four artists in the leading
roles, and sixty-five members of the
San Francisco Symphony Orchestra.
The rehearsal of the entire chorus
held last night was unusually success
ful; it was the first time that the 200
singers from San Francisco and San
Jose have been present at a big prac
tice. A complete rehearsal at which
the soloists and orchestra will take
part will be held at 2:30 Saturday
afternoon. Warren D. Allen, who is
directing the production, states that
the final preparations are progressing
smoothly.
The body of 500 singers consists of:
The Palo Alto-Stanford community
chorus numbering 160 voices; the Col
lege of the Pacific chorus, including
the A. Cappell Choir, totalling 100
voices; the Mountain View Choral

Society and the Peninsula Choral So
ciety of San Mateo, aggregating over
100 voices; over 100 members of the
Festival Chorus of San Francisco.
Graveure Best-Known Artist
Of the four professional artists in
"Elijah," perhaps the best known is
Louis Graveure, the distinguished
baritone. Graveure is at his best in
the role of "Elijah," which he sang
recently at Northwestern University.
Though not "operatic," he is undoubt
edly the most dramatic of all the con
cert artists, and the part of the pro
phet is an excellent foil for his talents.
Harold Procter, Los Angeles tenor,

is another soloist in wide favor today.
The demand for his presence at the
Shriners convention in Kansas City
is a testimonial to his popularity.
The group of soloists is completed
by Constance Balfour, soprano, and
Blanche Hamilton Fox, contralto. Al
though Americans, both women have
studied extensively abroad and have
made successful tours in Europe.
Blanche Hamilton Fox attended the
Whitney Opera School of Boston.
Stanford people supervising the ora
torio arrangements are: Comptroller
A. E. Roth, Dr. David Charles Gard
ner, and Alice Kimbell. Business de
tails are being handled by the Board
of Athletic Control. Tickets may be
purchased at the Administration build
ing, at Crandall's Bookstore, and at
the Music Shop in Palo Alto. Prices
are $1.00 for general admission, or
$1.50 for reserved center section sta
dium seats.

universities, among them the North
Musical Festival of Northwestern Uni
versity. Stanford will be the first in
stitution in the West to sponsor such
an undertaking. During the war the
Camp Fremont music festival, staged
on the old Stanford football field, at
tracted 18,000 people. A huge crowd
of people from this part of the state
should throng the stadium Sunday.
Has Dramatic Situations
Mendelssohn's "Elijah" offers an
appeal to everyone. It contains numer
ous dramatic situations and is well
organized. In addition to an excellent
score, the oratorio boasts a chorus of
500 voices, four artists in the leading
roles, and sixty-five members of the
San Francisco Symphony Orchestra.
The rehearsal of the entire chorus
held last night was unusually success
ful; it was the first time that the 200
singers from San Francisco and San
Jose have been present at a big prac
tice. A complete rehearsal at which
the soloists and orchestra will take
part will be held at 2:30 Saturday
afternoon. Warren D. Allen, who is
directing the production, states that
the final preparations are progressing
smoothly.
The body of 500 singers consists of:
The Palo Alto-Stanford community
chorus numbering 160 voices; the Col
lege of the Pacific chorus, including
the A. Cappell Choir, totalling 100
voices; the Mountain View Choral

Society and the Peninsula Choral So
ciety of San Mateo, aggregating over
100 voices; over 100 members of the
Festival Chorus of San Francisco.
Graveure Best-Known Artist
Of the four professional artists in
"Elijah," perhaps the best known is
Louis Graveure, the distinguished
baritone. Graveure is at his best in
the role of "Elijah," which he sang
recently at Northwestern University.
Though not "operatic," he is undoubt
edly the most dramatic of all the con
cert artists, and the part of the pro
phet is an excellent foil for his talents.
Harold Procter, Los Angeles tenor,

is another soloist in wide favor today.
The demand for his presence at the
Shriners convention in Kansas City
is a testimonial to his popularity.
The group of soloists is completed
by Constance Balfour, soprano, and
Blanche Hamilton Fox, contralto. Al
though Americans, both women have
studied extensively abroad and have
made successful tours in Europe.
Blanche Hamilton Fox attended the
Whitney Opera School of Boston.
Stanford people supervising the ora
torio arrangements are: Comptroller
A. E. Roth, Dr. David Charles Gard
ner, and Alice Kimbell. Business de
tails are being handled by the Board
of Athletic Control. Tickets may be
purchased at the Administration build
ing, at Crandall's Bookstore, and at
the Music Shop in Palo Alto. Prices
are $1.00 for general admission, or
$1.50 for reserved center section sta
dium seats.
"Elijah," the oratorio to be pre
sented at 3 o'clock next Sunday after
noon in the Stanford stadium, will be
the greatest production of its kind
ever attempted by a Western univer
sity.
Large musical productions have
been staged by eastern colleges and
universities, among them the North
Musical Festival of Northwestern Uni
versity. Stanford will be the first in
