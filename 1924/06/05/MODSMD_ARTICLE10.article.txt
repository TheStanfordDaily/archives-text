# QUADS WILL BE OUT FRIDAY AFTERNOON
## 
### 
1 Distribution of 1925 Quads will take
place Friday afternoon from two to
five o'clock in the lobby of the Ad
ministration building, according to
William Clark, who will be in charge.
For the benefit of those persons who
will not be able to be present at this
time, those books left over on Friday
| afternoon will be given out on Satur
day, from 9 o'clock until noon.
No Quads are to be given out with
out the presentation of the regular
slips. In the case of those who bought
their year-books on the installment
plan, only the final slip will be hon
ored. A charge of twenty-five cents
will be made for all lost slips. Blank
cards may be filled out to replace
these missing tickets.
Only the person in whose name the
original sale was made may call for a
Quad. Holders of tickets are asked to
line up according to classes. Three
booths will be reserved for juniors,
one for seniors, and two for the re
maining classes. A special place will
be left for the settlement of any mis
takes or misunderstandings in order
to eliminate unnecessary delay in the
regular distribution.
In case there are any Quads left
over the sale will be held on Monday.
