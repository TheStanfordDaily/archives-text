# CAP AND GOWN WILL ESTABLISH SECOND HAND BOOK STORE
## 
### 
Cap and Gown is launching a drive
to collect used books from students
and to sell them at a moderate price
for the benefit of the Women's Club
house and the scholarship fund re
cently established by the organiza
tion.
Miss Elisabeth Lee Buckingham will
be in charge of the second hand book
store to be established next quarter
after books have been collected.
All living groups are asked to co
operate by donating books from their
libraries. A representative of Cap and
Gown will be sent to each group to
explain the project.
The organization will co-operate in
every possible way with Mrs. Snell,
who has been collecting and distribu
ting books to self-supporting students.
Members are anxious to see that she
gets the books she needs.
