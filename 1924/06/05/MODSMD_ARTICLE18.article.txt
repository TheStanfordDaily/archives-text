# Emblems
## 
### 
The decision by the Executive Committee, to award gold emblems to
members of varsity teams that win from California is a highly desirable
one. A small gold football, basketball, or baseball, is of more lasting char
acter than a sweater.
Such a trophy can be treasured and enjoyed long after a sweater is worn
out and forgotten. Memories of college days usually remain only in a
man's mind ten years after he has graduated and some small but import
ant emblem will be a priceless treasure.
