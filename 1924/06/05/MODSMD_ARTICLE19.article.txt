# Half-Baked
## 
### 
Cameron Beck, personnel director of the New York stock exchange,
recently declared, "This country has entirely too many half-baked steno
graphers, half-baked plumbers, half-baked carpenters, and half-baked
everything." The term "half-baked" should not l>e applied to our steno
graphers, plumbers, carpenters, in the sense that they do not know their
profession. They may be called half-baked because they know nothing of
the problems of life. Indeed, the greater part of humanity may be called
half-baked for this reason, at least, those who have not thoroughly learned
the problems of life through experience. They are half-baked because,
having learned little through experience, and indeed having been taught
comparatively nothing of life, they know nothing of it.
The director's words hold more truth in them than is capable of realiza
tion. They express, at once, a problem that is arising in our civilization
and a clue to the solution. Beck declares that the knowledge of the facts
of life should be taught to high school students "to enable them to guard
against the pitfalls of vice and crime."
Can this indeed be a clue to the solution of the problem? Today, stu
dents graduate from high school with a more or less superficial knowledge
of Latin and Algebra. They embark upon the tasks of life equipped only
with this more or less artificial knowledge which can give them compara
tively small aid in solving the problems of life. Therefore, it is that their
education is sadly defective.—Michigan Daily.
