## COACH "ANDY" KERR 
### 
When Andrew Kerr came to Stan
ford in the fall of 1922 to rescue the
Cardinal warriors from the morass of
football mediocrity and to inaugurate
the system which was destined to put
Stanford once more in the winning
columns, he advanced another notch
in his rise to fame, which includes a
brilliant and successful career as a
coach of athletic teams.
"Andy" has played on high school
and college teams, and has coached
both. His life-long interests have been
athletics. He is deeply concerned
about giving Stanford winning teams,
and that is probably why one fact
stands out so clearly in connection
with his coaching career —he has
made a big success of everything he
has attempted with athletics.
"Andy" Kerr was born in Cheyenne,
Wyoming. At an early age he reversed
Horace Greeley's famous ma::im and
moved East with his parents, to the
state of Pennsylvania.
Practically all of Kerr's life has
been spent in the state of the Quakers
and Pennsylvania Dutch. Until he
came to Stanford to take charge of
football in 1922, preparatory to the
coming of Glenn Warner, Kerr was a
in the spirit and almost
in the blood.
Kerr's parents located in Carlisle,
Pennsylvania, and when Andy reached
the straight-edge and long-pants age
he was sent to Carlisle high school.
While there "Andy" played basketball
and football.
After graduating from high school
Kerr entered Dickinson College in his
home city of Carlisle. During his four
years there, Kerr further distinguished
himself in an athletic way by partici
pating in all the intercollegiate ath
letic events he was allowed to enter.
His athletic prowess in college at
tracted attention, and when he gradu
ated he was offered the job of coach
ing the Johnstown high school teams.
Kerr held this job for six years, and
his football, basketball, and track
teams during that period went almost
without a defeat. Next he accepted
the larger opportunity of coaching the
Central high school teams of Pitts
burgh. ,
He was at Central high school from
the fall of 1905 until 1914. His record
was but a duplication «f his success
at Johnstown. His teams in fact de
veloped somewhat of a national repu
tation. While he was coaching the
Central high school teams in Pitts
burgh, Kerr had an opportunity to
further study and observe the famous
Warner system of coaching, which he
had been interested in early.
In 1914, Glenn Warner, impressed
with Kerr's record as a high school
coach, got him to take up coaching
work at the University of Pittsburgh.
The first year he was track coach.
When the fall came around he was
put in charge of freshman football,
which job he held until he came to
Stanford. Besides coaching the frosh
football team, Kerr was varsity bas
ketball and track coach.
At Pittsburgh, Kerr developed into
Warner's chief lieutenant.

The first year he was track coach.
When the fall came around he was
put in charge of freshman football,
which job he held until he came to
Stanford. Besides coaching the frosh
football team, Kerr was varsity bas
ketball and track coach.
At Pittsburgh, Kerr developed into
Warner's chief lieutenant.
When Andrew Kerr came to Stan
ford in the fall of 1922 to rescue the
Cardinal warriors from the morass of
football mediocrity and to inaugurate
the system which was destined to put
Stanford once more in the winning
columns, he advanced another notch
in his rise to fame, which includes a
brilliant and successful career as a
coach of athletic teams.
"Andy" has played on high school
and college teams, and has coached
both. His life-long interests have been
athletics. He is deeply concerned
about giving Stanford winning teams,
and that is probably why one fact
stands out so clearly in connection
with his coaching career —he has
made a big success of everything he
has attempted with athletics.
"Andy" Kerr was born in Cheyenne,
Wyoming. At an early age he reversed
Horace Greeley's famous ma::im and
moved East with his parents, to the
state of Pennsylvania.
Practically all of Kerr's life has
been spent in the state of the Quakers
and Pennsylvania Dutch. Until he
came to Stanford to take charge of
football in 1922, preparatory to the
coming of Glenn Warner, Kerr was a
in the spirit and almost
in the blood.
Kerr's parents located in Carlisle,
Pennsylvania, and when Andy reached
the straight-edge and long-pants age
he was sent to Carlisle high school.
While there "Andy" played basketball
and football.
After graduating from high school
Kerr entered Dickinson College in his
home city of Carlisle. During his four
years there, Kerr further distinguished
himself in an athletic way by partici
pating in all the intercollegiate ath
letic events he was allowed to enter.
His athletic prowess in college at
tracted attention, and when he gradu
ated he was offered the job of coach
ing the Johnstown high school teams.
Kerr held this job for six years, and
his football, basketball, and track
teams during that period went almost
without a defeat. Next he accepted
the larger opportunity of coaching the
Central high school teams of Pitts
burgh. ,
He was at Central high school from
the fall of 1905 until 1914. His record
was but a duplication «f his success
at Johnstown. His teams in fact de
veloped somewhat of a national repu
tation. While he was coaching the
Central high school teams in Pitts
burgh, Kerr had an opportunity to
further study and observe the famous
Warner system of coaching, which he
had been interested in early.
In 1914, Glenn Warner, impressed
with Kerr's record as a high school
coach, got him to take up coaching
work at the University of Pittsburgh.
