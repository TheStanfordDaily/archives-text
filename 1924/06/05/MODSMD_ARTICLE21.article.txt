# ELLIS READS DRAMA TO CLASSICAL CLUB
## 
### 
J. L. Ellis of the English depart
ment read a play of his own writing,
"Clytemnestra and Aegisthus," before
the Classical Club last evening.
In this play, Ellis attempts to tell
the old Orestes story from a different
angle. He has made the piece resemble
a Greek play by having but one char
acter speaking upon the stage at
one time, and though he has no chorus,
he has some choral effects coming
from minor characters who might
have been leaders of the chorus in
the ancient plays. Since he has com
bined the three events of the Aeschy
lus triology into on play the unity of
time has necessarily been violated.
Throughout the play, the emphasis
is most un-Greek, since the modern
theatregoer demands realism, in Ellis'
opinion. There is none of the restraint
of expression of emotion that the
Greeks demanded, and one sees a
hard, ambitious woman, thoroughly
out of sympathy with her husband and
all her children save the one whom
has been slain, descending to love
Aegisthus and to plot against the
honor and life of Agamemnon.
