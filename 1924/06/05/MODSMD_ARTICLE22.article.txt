## No. 13. EARLY TRANSPORTATION 
### Esther Greenacre 
Two-seated surreys and lumbering
buses drawn by horses provided the
means of transportation between Palo
Alto and the campus during the early
years of the University.
The majority of students bicycled
or rode horseback to school. Profes
sors likewise depended on bicycles,
using the carriers on their machines
to hold their books en route to the
University and to transport their in
fants on pleasure jaunts. Hiding on
the bus was considered a luxury, but
in rainy weather it became a neces
sity.
"Marguerite"
Of the big wagons, the most noted
was the one named "Marguerite,"
which brought loads of students out
each morning in time for the various
classes.
The crowd was collected at the cir
cle in front of the present station
and dropped at the inner quadrangle.
In rainy weather the extreme inuddi
ness of the roads prevented bicycling
and "Marguerite" often carried as
many as forty passengers. Clinging to
the steps and the sides of the bus
the students were often as thorough
ly soaked as they would have been
had they bicycled, the only advan
tage being avoidance of the mud.
Ten cents was charged for a one-way
trip. At five o'clock the big wagon
returned to town loaded with students.
Spilled Books
Those who braved the weather on
their bicycles equipped with umbrellas
were often embarassed by having
their books spill and their umbrellas
turned wrong side out. On a good day

Before the railroad ran through
Palo Alto, travelers disembarked at
Mayfield and Menlo Park. The first
Palo Alto station consisted of an old
box car. In 1891 an open shed was
erected to be replaced by a tiny
building in 1894. In 1896 the station

bwas enlarged to almost its present
size. The station of '94 is noted as
the one which was painted red by
Ray Lyman Wilbur and a gang of
studentß in celebration of a victory
over California. The posloffice was
decorated at the same time.
Greenhorns Spotted
Carriage drivers lineup up at the
old station and vied with each other
in securing the few, tourists who
alighted aud demanded transporta
tion to the campus. "Greenhorns"
were at once detected by the drivers,
who invariably charged them $1 in
stead of the usual 10 cent fare. Of
the bus drivers, one known as "Uncle
John" was the most famous, due to
his art of prevaricating.
"Uncle John"
"Uncle John" delighted in stuffing
his tourist passengers with impossible
yarns. The prairie dog holes were
pointed out by him as having been
dug by the Southern Pacific Company
as accommodations for the little ani
mals. He described the luxuries of
Encina hall in detail, informing his
passengers that a piano was furnished
for each room in the hall. Few people
knew that the. character's real name
was Asa Andrews and that he had
once been a prosperous merchant in
Chautauqua, N. Y.
The first street car appeared about
the year 1904. The operators did
everything in their power to make the
street cars popular as people had to
be educated to their use. Conductors
were wont to wait for passengers
whom they saw coming two or three
blocks away, and even waited in Palo
Alto while housewives got off the car
and went back to make forgotten pur
chases.
The first automobile in California
appeared in the vicinity in 1892, Dr.
Jordan going on its first trip up Mt.
Hamilton in that year. The climb was
considered a great feat and the horse
less vehicle was heralded throughout
the state.

Carriage drivers lineup up at the
old station and vied with each other
in securing the few, tourists who
alighted aud demanded transporta
tion to the campus. "Greenhorns"
were at once detected by the drivers,
who invariably charged them $1 in
stead of the usual 10 cent fare. Of
the bus drivers, one known as "Uncle
John" was the most famous, due to
his art of prevaricating.
"Uncle John"
"Uncle John" delighted in stuffing
his tourist passengers with impossible
yarns. The prairie dog holes were
pointed out by him as having been
dug by the Southern Pacific Company
as accommodations for the little ani
mals. He described the luxuries of
Encina hall in detail, informing his
passengers that a piano was furnished
for each room in the hall. Few people
knew that the. character's real name
was Asa Andrews and that he had
once been a prosperous merchant in
Chautauqua, N. Y.
The first street car appeared about
the year 1904. The operators did
everything in their power to make the
street cars popular as people had to
be educated to their use. Conductors
were wont to wait for passengers
whom they saw coming two or three
blocks away, and even waited in Palo
Alto while housewives got off the car
and went back to make forgotten pur
chases.
The first automobile in California
appeared in the vicinity in 1892, Dr.
Jordan going on its first trip up Mt.
Hamilton in that year. The climb was
considered a great feat and the horse
less vehicle was heralded throughout
the state.
Two-seated surreys and lumbering
buses drawn by horses provided the
means of transportation between Palo
Alto and the campus during the early
years of the University.
The majority of students bicycled
or rode horseback to school. Profes
sors likewise depended on bicycles,
using the carriers on their machines
to hold their books en route to the
University and to transport their in
fants on pleasure jaunts. Hiding on
the bus was considered a luxury, but
in rainy weather it became a neces
sity.
"Marguerite"
Of the big wagons, the most noted
was the one named "Marguerite,"
which brought loads of students out
each morning in time for the various
classes.
The crowd was collected at the cir
cle in front of the present station
and dropped at the inner quadrangle.
In rainy weather the extreme inuddi
ness of the roads prevented bicycling
and "Marguerite" often carried as
many as forty passengers. Clinging to
the steps and the sides of the bus
the students were often as thorough
ly soaked as they would have been
had they bicycled, the only advan
tage being avoidance of the mud.
Ten cents was charged for a one-way
trip. At five o'clock the big wagon
returned to town loaded with students.
Spilled Books
Those who braved the weather on
their bicycles equipped with umbrellas
were often embarassed by having
their books spill and their umbrellas
turned wrong side out. On a good day

Before the railroad ran through
Palo Alto, travelers disembarked at
Mayfield and Menlo Park. The first
Palo Alto station consisted of an old
box car. In 1891 an open shed was
erected to be replaced by a tiny
building in 1894. In 1896 the station

bwas enlarged to almost its present
size. The station of '94 is noted as
the one which was painted red by
Ray Lyman Wilbur and a gang of
studentß in celebration of a victory
over California. The posloffice was
decorated at the same time.
