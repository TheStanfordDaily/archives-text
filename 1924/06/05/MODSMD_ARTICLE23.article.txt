Al White
The first high dive undertaken by
Al White was either going to be his
last one, or his first; and at the time
of its execution the chances seemed
pretty strong for the former phrase.
He was the original boy who stood
on the burning deck when the S. S.
City of Palo Alto was struck by an
iceberg near the Hawaiian Islands. Al
was working in the stoke-hole and did
not know what the matter was until
he noticed the stoke signal was not
going. He was the last to go on deck
and notice things for himself.
The only one left on the boat, be
sides Al, was the captain, who was
sound asleep at the wheel. Al did not
want to wake him up and therefore
strolled to the stern, surveying the
interesting scenery.
Then the boat began to tilt, stern
high in the air. To jump down the
leeward side was risky, as it looked
like the tub was liable to turn a flip.

So, there was Al, hanging by his toe
nails to the upper deck and, as far
from the water as if he were working
on a drydock. And —well —she was
sinking.
Below —at that crucial moment —the
ocean was chuck full of lifeboats,
rafts, preservers, and sharks. About
50 yards to the left was a pile of
seaweed. Six inches from that sea
weed was a peach of a man-eating
shark. Al's scheme was to hit the.sea
weed and elude the shark.
His dive was poorly aimed. He had
to gyrate in order to carry out fur
ther. He had to twist so as not to fall
offside. He made a combination swan
dive, double-barreled flip, hop-scotch
and Chinese jack-knife. Even then he
landed about an inch from the shark.
His quick recovery to the seaweed
saved him. He floated around for about
six days before being picked up.
The City of Palo Alto weighed 20,000
gross tons.
