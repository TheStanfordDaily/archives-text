# No. 8. VILNA DISPUTE
## 
### 
At the Peace Conference, the Chief
Allied Powers fixed Poland's frontiers
in the west, but Left frontier
undetermined. As a result Poland and
Lithuania found themselves on the
brink of war over the question of
their respective rights to the town
and territory of Vilna. Thereupon,
Poland, in September 1920, appealed
to the Council of the League of
Nations.
A military commission was appoint
ed and succeeded in getting both
parties to accept a provisional line
of demarcation, thereby establishing
an armistice. But General Zeligowski,
of Poland, broke the agreement and
entered Vilna. The Polish Govern
ment disavowed the move, but did
nothing to stop it. The League tried
to settle the question by a plebiscite,
but failed to arrive at an agreement
with General Zeligowski and the
Polish Government that it could re
gard as satisfactory.
The alternative course of direct
negotiation between the Polish and
Lithuanian Governments was then
tried. But no solution could be found
satisfactory to both parties, and the
combined moral authority of the Coun
cil and the Second Assembly failed
to move either from their positions.
When neither party accepts a League
award, the Covenant does not war
rant any further action within the
League system.
In the meantime the Polish Govern
ment has, since the Second Assembly,
organized a plebiscite on its own con
ditions, and declares that the result
confines its claim to Vilna. This
claim is not accepted by the- Lithu
anian Government.
Professor Graham H. Stuurt of the
Political Science department makes the
following statement regarding the dis
pute :
The Vilna dispute is constantly

>cited by opponents of the League as
an instance of its inability to settle
really serious political disputes. Yet
there is little doubt but that these
same critics would lyive found even
greater cause for complaint if the
League had recommended the use
of force to compel a settlement.
The League in its present develop
ment is tending more and more to
wards the employment of mediation
and free discussion as the best means
of settling disputes. In the case of
Vilna the League succeeded in get
ting both sides to agree to an armis
tice but owing to the unstaple politi
i cal conditions in both countries, and
I the tendency of demagogues, (a
j breed not unknown even in the United
; States) to appeal to patriotism as a
; smoke screen to mask their selfish
j personal motives, no settlement was
I possible.
Council of Ambassadors
The question here was further com
plicated by the interference of the
' Council of Ambassadors, whose claim
to jurisdiction rested upon the fact
that the question was one of the un
settled issues directly resulting from
the World War. However, there is lit
tle doubt but that if both Russia and
Germany had been members of the
League — and there is reason to
hope that both will soon be active
members —the high-handed methods
of Poland would not have been so
1 confidently employed.
It was not the League but the Couu-
I cil of Ambassadors which finally es
tablished a line giving Poland the dis
puted area and it is ONLY through
I the League's machinery that Lithu
ania may hope to have its claims re
considered and a more just settlement
obtained.
