# RUSSIAN POSTER FROM HOOVER WAR LIBRARY ON EXHIBIT
## 
### 
Russian posters, the property of the
Hoover War Library, are now on ex
hibition at the Stanford Art Gallery.
"Viewed from either the historical or
the artistic point of view they are
unique," says John T. Lemos, director.
"Dating from the time of the Czarist
regime the collection includes posters
of the time of Bolshevistic control.
They are full of life and color, and all
of them contain interesting captions.
"The Russian wording has been
translated and the English version at
tached to the works. Most of them
have to do with the ascendancy of
the laboring classes and call upon the
"common people" to help build up the
new government.
"In several cases, however, another
angle, one winch condemns the use of
child labor, is shown. Another calls
upon citizens to protect works of art,
and several are based upon the help
given by the American Relief Commis
sions.
"From the artistic standpoint the
posters are unique. A number of them
are decidedly German in technique,
several use the French method, and
others are typically Russian. Among
the latter are some with naive de
signs based upon the humorous idea
and accompanied by Russian rhymes
or jingles. The idea of using the
rhymes was to have something that
the general public would remember
easily, and spread about by singing
or reciting them."

Women's sports are to take in a
wider field at the University of
California next semester. Canoeing
and hockey have been added to the
list of women's competition <and the
Rifle Club, Crop and Saddle, and
Swimming are all increasing their
activities.
