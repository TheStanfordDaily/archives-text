# Chaparral to Sponsor Final Dance of Quarter At Clubhouse Tomorrow
## 
### 
I The Old Boy will reign supreme Fri
day night when Chappie takes the re-1
i sponsibility for a "Prodigious, infor
mal Brawl," (in other words, a dance)
! at the Women's Clubhouse.
Friday's fracas marks the last dance
of the year. The grief which would
naturally reign at such an occasion
will be relieved in every possible way [
by the dance's sponsor, Hammer and
| Coffin. As a step in the right direc
tion, tiiis organization lias agreed to
admit the rabble at the absurdly small
sum of one buck.
The only restriction made by Cliap
! pie is that women carrying hand
grenades should be debarred. We hope j
that few persons will be eliminated I
by this ruling.
Whitmer's Orchestra will make its
j final bow at 12 o'clock.
