# THREE FRENCH PLAYS ARE CLEVERLY ACTED

### Hulda Hoover 
In spite of being attended by but a |
mediocre house, the French Club plays i
were voted a decided success by those \
who attended.
Credit tor the success of the pro
duction is divided between Cecil Mor
ris as director and Hammond Ashley
as manager, who successfully sur
mounted the difficulties of getting up
three plays in a foreign language.
The first play, "Au Louvre," a clever
bit of romance, in which a young |
American artist, while copying in the !
Louvre, finds her "secret sorrow," who ;
has recently saved her from death.
Olivia Boezinger as Julia Noirmont,
the artist, and Hammond Ashley as
Leon Boulmier, the dashing hero, did
some excellent acting. Both parts
were difficult, requiring a great deal |
of emotional expression.
"Les Marquises" Is Amusing
The next play, "Les Marquises de la ;
Fourchette," was decidedly amusing, j
practically all the humor reaching the
audience as the plot of the piece and
the various situations were under
standable in any language.
JOrnest de lteynier made an excel
lent errant husband who, while at
tempting to take a young laundress to
dinner in a "shady" restaurant, en
counters his son-in-law-to-be accom
panied by another suspicious charac
ter. The part of Paul, the wayward
young fiance, was played by Ted
Achilles.
Between acts Martin d'Andrea held
the audience through the rather long
waits with some excellent singing.
The last piece, "Le Vrai Courage,"
was also largely comical. Bscard (J.
F. Gill) and Bricheteau (Pedro de
Boeck) had formerly been friends,
but in some slight quarrel the latter !
had struck his friend who, being a
coward, displayed "vrai courage" by |
not returning the blow. Both parts
were well acted and their clever dia
logue was esily understandable to the
audience.
Pierre Hachez, as the mutual friend,
made an excellent type of a small
part. Bolton White was well received
as the violinist of the cafe.
