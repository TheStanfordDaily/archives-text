# CARD TRACKSTERS AFTER PLACES ON AMERICAN SQUAD
## "Tiny" Hartranft May Have Chance to Toss Weights For United States 
### 
Ten members of the varsity track
squad are training on the Williams
College oval at Williamston, Mass., in
preparation for the final Olympic
Games tryouts which will be held at
Boston.
The men who are still in the run
ning for places are "Tiny" Hartranft,
Ted Miller, Dick Mcintosh, Bill Rich
ardson, "Swede" Leistner, Jim Arthur,
Fred Anderson, lan Campbell, Marshall
Hale, and Bill Kerr.
Dole Sent East
Another Stanford man, Norman
Dole, is being sent East to compete
in the 400 metre hurdles, which event
he won at the local- trials. The P. A. A.
is sending Dole.
The ten men already in the East
will all represent Stanford, notwith
standing the fact that there has been
a rumor that Hartranft was to toss
the weights under the colors of the
Olympic Club of San Francisco.
Hartranft Certain to Place
Hartranft is practically certain of a
place on the United States team, as he
is the premier college weight man of
the country, and also consistently puts
the shot and discus out dangerously
near the marks which are the world's
records. As there was a high wind
blowing last Saturday when he threw
the disccus more than 158 feet he will
not be allowed a new record. But, the
r'act that he succeeded in coming from
behind to win in the I. C. A. A. A. A.
shows that he has the ability to make
phenomenal performances when he is
forced to do so in order to win.
Suould Jim Artnur get lucky again
and throw the discus beyond the 150-,
foot mark he should also get a place,
but it is exceedingly doubtful if he
will be able to repeat his performance
of last week.
Anderson a Possibility
Fred Anderson must be considered
as a possibility for the American
team, because he has jumped 6 feet
2% inches. Six feet three should place
any jumper on the team.
Hale and Campbell did not make
much of a showing in the sprints last
week. Since neither of them placed
Saturday it is hardly possible that
they will do so next week, as a faster
field will run then than was the case
in the college meet. ]
Watters and Helffrich beat Richard
son and Mcintosh last week, and will
probably repeat the performance in
the tryouts. However, should these
men be the four fastest half-milers in
the country they will make tlie trip
to the games.
No Report on Miller and Kerr
Neither Miller nor Kerr placed in
the I. C. A. A. A. A. No report has
been received as yet telling why these
men failed to place and so their
chances for going to games are none
too good.
By virtue of his second place in the
high hurdles, "Swede" Leistner has a
very good chance of getting to France.
Moore is one of the best hurdlers in
the country and "Swede" was right on
his heels in two races.

foot mark he should also get a place,
but it is exceedingly doubtful if he
will be able to repeat his performance
of last week.
Anderson a Possibility
Fred Anderson must be considered
as a possibility for the American
team, because he has jumped 6 feet
2% inches. Six feet three should place
any jumper on the team.
Hale and Campbell did not make
much of a showing in the sprints last
week. Since neither of them placed
Saturday it is hardly possible that
they will do so next week, as a faster
field will run then than was the case
in the college meet. ]
Watters and Helffrich beat Richard
son and Mcintosh last week, and will
probably repeat the performance in
the tryouts. However, should these
men be the four fastest half-milers in
the country they will make tlie trip
to the games.
No Report on Miller and Kerr
Neither Miller nor Kerr placed in
the I. C. A. A. A. A. No report has
been received as yet telling why these
men failed to place and so their
chances for going to games are none
too good.
By virtue of his second place in the
high hurdles, "Swede" Leistner has a
very good chance of getting to France.
Moore is one of the best hurdlers in
the country and "Swede" was right on
his heels in two races.
Ten members of the varsity track
squad are training on the Williams
College oval at Williamston, Mass., in
preparation for the final Olympic
Games tryouts which will be held at
Boston.
The men who are still in the run
ning for places are "Tiny" Hartranft,
Ted Miller, Dick Mcintosh, Bill Rich
ardson, "Swede" Leistner, Jim Arthur,
Fred Anderson, lan Campbell, Marshall
Hale, and Bill Kerr.
Dole Sent East
Another Stanford man, Norman
Dole, is being sent East to compete
in the 400 metre hurdles, which event
he won at the local- trials. The P. A. A.
is sending Dole.
The ten men already in the East
will all represent Stanford, notwith
standing the fact that there has been
a rumor that Hartranft was to toss
the weights under the colors of the
Olympic Club of San Francisco.
Hartranft Certain to Place
Hartranft is practically certain of a
place on the United States team, as he
is the premier college weight man of
the country, and also consistently puts
the shot and discus out dangerously
near the marks which are the world's
records. As there was a high wind
blowing last Saturday when he threw
the disccus more than 158 feet he will
not be allowed a new record. But, the
r'act that he succeeded in coming from
behind to win in the I. C. A. A. A. A.
shows that he has the ability to make
phenomenal performances when he is
forced to do so in order to win.
Suould Jim Artnur get lucky again
and throw the discus beyond the 150-,
foot mark he should also get a place,
but it is exceedingly doubtful if he
will be able to repeat his performance
of last week.
