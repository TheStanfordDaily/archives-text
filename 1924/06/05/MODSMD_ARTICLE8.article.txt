I Safeguarding of future campus dra
' matic productions from objectionable
j elements rather than criticizing past
' mistakes, is the policy which is being
: followed by Associated Women.
"We don't expect the girls to come
out in overalls or rompers, but we do
not want to be ashamed of their imi
tating cheap chorus girls," said one
student when she was interviewed on
! the subject.
Another endorsed the idea that one
J of the junior members of Women's
! Council should be a member of the
Junior Opera Committee. In this way,
1 she believed that corrections could be
! made during the planning of the pro
; duction, and complaints after it was
I over could thus be eliminated.
New Plan
According to this plan, any sugges
tions for improvements could be
! brought to her, from women on the
cast who do not desire to complain,
or from anyone else, and at her discre

tion, these matters could be taken up
with the committee.
These plans for the coming year
are, according to a member of Wo
men's Council, for the purpose of con
structive improvement. It is the opin
ion of the Council that woman's part
in dramatics is very important in
her campus activities, and it is for
this reason that so much stress is
being laid on the way she plays the
part.
Especially in chorus work, where
there is not enough time for the in
tensive training necessary for profes
sional skill, is it dangerous for the
women to imitate musical comedies,
lest they imitate the worst part.
Associated Women have as their
aim, according to its leaders, the rais
ing of the standards of chorus produc
tions. The organization wants to start
public opinion in this direction, so
that everyone will help with the same
attitude, until finally public opinion
will be educated to tolerate only the
best.
