# DR. W. F. DURAND TO BE HONORED BY A. S. M. E.
## Retiring Head of Mechanical Engineering Department Will Be Given Banquet By Friends On June 18 
### Douglas Meservey 
IN part recognition of his services to humanity as scientist and philosopher,
a banquet is to be given June 18 in honor of Dr. William F. Durand, who
is retiring this year as head of the Mechanical Engineering department.
The affair is being tendered Dr. Durand at the Union by the Stanford
chapter of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, the national
presidency of which is assured Dr. Durand since his nomination a few weeks
ago without opposition.
Reservations for the banquet may be made with Alumni Secretary J. E.

McDowell, or the Bookstore, and are open to all friends and admirers of
Dr. Durand.
Many Notable Honors
The election of Dr. Durand to the presidency of the A. S. M. E. will come
as the culminating honor in a lengthy list of notable distinctions, rivaled
by few men.
The life of Dr. Durand may be characterized by the one word. "Achieve
ment." Born and raised on a Connecticut farm, he graduated as honor man

'from Annapolis in 1880 with such men
as Admiral Sims, Hodman, and Simp
son as classmates.
Head of Cornell School
From then until he entered Stanford
in 1904 as head of the mechanical en
gineering department, he held such
positions as professor and head of the
Cornell university graduate school in
naval architecture and marine engi
neering. He was also a member of the


Dr. William Durand, who, as retiring head of the Mechanical Engineering
deprtment, will be honored at a banquet
faculty of the Mechanical Engineering
department of Michigan State Agricul
tural college.
Dr. Durand has been the active head
of the Stanford Mechanical Engineer
ing department since 1904 with the ex
ception of the years between 1917 and
1919 when his valuable technical
knowledge was placed at the disposal
of the government.
In 1915 he became a member of the
national advisory committee on aero
nautics, and in 1917 he was made
[ chairman of the body. In 1918 his
headquarters was transferred to Paris
where he was made scientific attache
of the United States embassy.
It was in this capacity that he was
able to develop new ideas and to
maintain an interchange of valuable
technical information between the
Paris and Washington army headquar
ters. In the same year he was ap
pointed a member of the inter-allied
commission on war inventions and re
turned to Stanford in February, 1919.
Many Inventions
Among the many mechanical inven
tions and scientific works which Dr.
Durand has contributed to the world
are: The three-point calipers for de
termining true circular contours, the
radial planimeter for averaging ordi
nates in polar diagrams, and the Dur
and transmission dynamometer for
measuring power in transmission by
belts, chains, or gears.
Dr. Durand is also the author of
more than 100 scientific treatises and
four books. The latter are: "Resist
ance and Propulsion of Ships," "Prac
tical Marine Engineering," "Hydrau
lics of Pipe Lines," and "Principals
of Mechanics."
Four Lines of Work
His greatest developments have
been in four lines, namely, marine
architecture, marine engineering,
aeronautics, and hydraulic engineer
ing.
Perhaps the best means of realizing
the extent to which Dr. Durand has
become an international figure is by
reviewing the many honors that have
been bestowed upon him by the scien
tific yorld.
Three Honorary Societies
He is a member of three national
honorary societies, membership in
which is obtained only through scien
tific and philosophical achievement.
These are the National Academy of
Sciences, American Philosophical So
ciety, and the American Academy of
Sciences.
He is also a member of the Society
Technique Maritime (French Naval
Architects), American Institute of
EHectrical Engineers, American So
ciety of Naval Architects and Marine
Engineers, and the American Society
of Naval Engineers (gold medal and
life membership in 1899).
Dr. Durand has also received the

honorary degree of doctor of laws, be-,
stowed by the University of California
at the inauguration of Dr. W. W.
Campbell as president, and the de
gree of doctor of philosophy at Lafay
ette college in 1888.
Believing that a man should have an ;
avocation as well as a vocation, Dr.
Durand has shown for many years an;
interest in ornamental gardening, bi-1
ology, archaeology, music, art, and i
the study of foreign languages.
Studies Plant Life
On his two-acre tract on the cam-!
pus he spends many hours in studying:
and cultivating pint life. He has also j
made several trips to the scenes of old !
Egyptian ruins in pursuit of his hobby \
of archaeology, enabling him, at a re-1
cent date, to lecture his fellow facul-1
ty members on Egyptian word-forms. :
During the past few years Dr. Dur- j
and has found time to lend his aid to |
many of the country's greutest hydro
electric projects, acting as consulting
engineer in the Boulder canyon pro- j
ject of the Colorado river, the Colum- j
bia River Dalles power-development
project, Los Angeles aqueduct, and
the Hetch-Hetchy water and power de- 1
velopment.

presidency of which is assured Dr. Durand since his nomination a few weeks
ago without opposition.
Reservations for the banquet may be made with Alumni Secretary J. E.

McDowell, or the Bookstore, and are open to all friends and admirers of
Dr. Durand.
Many Notable Honors
The election of Dr. Durand to the presidency of the A. S. M. E. will come
as the culminating honor in a lengthy list of notable distinctions, rivaled
by few men.
The life of Dr. Durand may be characterized by the one word. "Achieve
ment." Born and raised on a Connecticut farm, he graduated as honor man

'from Annapolis in 1880 with such men
as Admiral Sims, Hodman, and Simp
son as classmates.
Head of Cornell School
From then until he entered Stanford
in 1904 as head of the mechanical en
gineering department, he held such
positions as professor and head of the
Cornell university graduate school in
naval architecture and marine engi
neering. He was also a member of the


Dr. William Durand, who, as retiring head of the Mechanical Engineering
deprtment, will be honored at a banquet
faculty of the Mechanical Engineering
department of Michigan State Agricul
tural college.
Dr. Durand has been the active head
of the Stanford Mechanical Engineer
ing department since 1904 with the ex
ception of the years between 1917 and
1919 when his valuable technical
knowledge was placed at the disposal
of the government.
In 1915 he became a member of the
national advisory committee on aero
nautics, and in 1917 he was made
[ chairman of the body. In 1918 his
headquarters was transferred to Paris
where he was made scientific attache
of the United States embassy.
It was in this capacity that he was
able to develop new ideas and to
maintain an interchange of valuable
technical information between the
Paris and Washington army headquar
ters. In the same year he was ap
pointed a member of the inter-allied
commission on war inventions and re
turned to Stanford in February, 1919.
Many Inventions
Among the many mechanical inven
tions and scientific works which Dr.
Durand has contributed to the world
are: The three-point calipers for de
termining true circular contours, the
radial planimeter for averaging ordi
nates in polar diagrams, and the Dur
and transmission dynamometer for
measuring power in transmission by
belts, chains, or gears.
Dr. Durand is also the author of
more than 100 scientific treatises and
four books. The latter are: "Resist
ance and Propulsion of Ships," "Prac
tical Marine Engineering," "Hydrau
lics of Pipe Lines," and "Principals
of Mechanics."
Four Lines of Work
His greatest developments have
been in four lines, namely, marine
architecture, marine engineering,
aeronautics, and hydraulic engineer
ing.
Perhaps the best means of realizing
the extent to which Dr. Durand has
become an international figure is by
reviewing the many honors that have
been bestowed upon him by the scien
tific yorld.
Three Honorary Societies
He is a member of three national
honorary societies, membership in
which is obtained only through scien
tific and philosophical achievement.
These are the National Academy of
Sciences, American Philosophical So
ciety, and the American Academy of
Sciences.
He is also a member of the Society
Technique Maritime (French Naval
Architects), American Institute of
EHectrical Engineers, American So
ciety of Naval Architects and Marine
Engineers, and the American Society
of Naval Engineers (gold medal and
life membership in 1899).
Dr. Durand has also received the

honorary degree of doctor of laws, be-,
stowed by the University of California
at the inauguration of Dr. W. W.
Campbell as president, and the de
gree of doctor of philosophy at Lafay
ette college in 1888.
Believing that a man should have an ;
avocation as well as a vocation, Dr.
Durand has shown for many years an;
interest in ornamental gardening, bi-1
ology, archaeology, music, art, and i
the study of foreign languages.
Studies Plant Life
On his two-acre tract on the cam-!
pus he spends many hours in studying:
and cultivating pint life. He has also j
made several trips to the scenes of old !
Egyptian ruins in pursuit of his hobby \
of archaeology, enabling him, at a re-1
cent date, to lecture his fellow facul-1
ty members on Egyptian word-forms. :
During the past few years Dr. Dur- j
and has found time to lend his aid to |
many of the country's greutest hydro
electric projects, acting as consulting
engineer in the Boulder canyon pro- j
ject of the Colorado river, the Colum- j
bia River Dalles power-development
project, Los Angeles aqueduct, and
the Hetch-Hetchy water and power de- 1
velopment.
IN part recognition of his services to humanity as scientist and philosopher,
a banquet is to be given June 18 in honor of Dr. William F. Durand, who
is retiring this year as head of the Mechanical Engineering department.
The affair is being tendered Dr. Durand at the Union by the Stanford

The life of Dr. Durand may be characterized by the one word. "Achieve
ment." Born and raised on a Connecticut farm, he graduated as honor man

'from Annapolis in 1880 with such men
as Admiral Sims, Hodman, and Simp
son as classmates.
Head of Cornell School
From then until he entered Stanford
in 1904 as head of the mechanical en
gineering department, he held such
positions as professor and head of the
Cornell university graduate school in
naval architecture and marine engi
neering. He was also a member of the


Dr. William Durand, who, as retiring head of the Mechanical Engineering
deprtment, will be honored at a banquet
faculty of the Mechanical Engineering
department of Michigan State Agricul
tural college.
Dr. Durand has been the active head
of the Stanford Mechanical Engineer
ing department since 1904 with the ex
ception of the years between 1917 and
1919 when his valuable technical
knowledge was placed at the disposal
of the government.
In 1915 he became a member of the
national advisory committee on aero
nautics, and in 1917 he was made
[ chairman of the body. In 1918 his
headquarters was transferred to Paris
where he was made scientific attache
of the United States embassy.
It was in this capacity that he was
able to develop new ideas and to
maintain an interchange of valuable
technical information between the
Paris and Washington army headquar
ters. In the same year he was ap
pointed a member of the inter-allied
commission on war inventions and re
turned to Stanford in February, 1919.
Many Inventions
Among the many mechanical inven
tions and scientific works which Dr.
Durand has contributed to the world
are: The three-point calipers for de
termining true circular contours, the
radial planimeter for averaging ordi
nates in polar diagrams, and the Dur
and transmission dynamometer for
measuring power in transmission by
belts, chains, or gears.
Dr. Durand is also the author of
more than 100 scientific treatises and
four books. The latter are: "Resist
ance and Propulsion of Ships," "Prac
tical Marine Engineering," "Hydrau
lics of Pipe Lines," and "Principals
of Mechanics."
Four Lines of Work
His greatest developments have
been in four lines, namely, marine
architecture, marine engineering,
aeronautics, and hydraulic engineer
ing.
Perhaps the best means of realizing
the extent to which Dr. Durand has
become an international figure is by
reviewing the many honors that have
been bestowed upon him by the scien
tific yorld.
Three Honorary Societies
He is a member of three national
honorary societies, membership in
which is obtained only through scien
tific and philosophical achievement.
These are the National Academy of
Sciences, American Philosophical So
ciety, and the American Academy of
Sciences.
He is also a member of the Society
Technique Maritime (French Naval
Architects), American Institute of
EHectrical Engineers, American So
ciety of Naval Architects and Marine
Engineers, and the American Society
of Naval Engineers (gold medal and
life membership in 1899).
Dr. Durand has also received the

honorary degree of doctor of laws, be-,
stowed by the University of California
at the inauguration of Dr. W. W.
Campbell as president, and the de
gree of doctor of philosophy at Lafay
ette college in 1888.
Believing that a man should have an ;
avocation as well as a vocation, Dr.
Durand has shown for many years an;
interest in ornamental gardening, bi-1
ology, archaeology, music, art, and i
the study of foreign languages.
Studies Plant Life
On his two-acre tract on the cam-!
pus he spends many hours in studying:
and cultivating pint life. He has also j
made several trips to the scenes of old !
Egyptian ruins in pursuit of his hobby \
of archaeology, enabling him, at a re-1
cent date, to lecture his fellow facul-1
ty members on Egyptian word-forms. :
During the past few years Dr. Dur- j
and has found time to lend his aid to |
many of the country's greutest hydro
electric projects, acting as consulting
engineer in the Boulder canyon pro- j
ject of the Colorado river, the Colum- j
bia River Dalles power-development
project, Los Angeles aqueduct, and
the Hetch-Hetchy water and power de- 1
velopment.
IN part recognition of his services to humanity as scientist and philosopher,
a banquet is to be given June 18 in honor of Dr. William F. Durand, who
is retiring this year as head of the Mechanical Engineering department.
The affair is being tendered Dr. Durand at the Union by the Stanford
chapter of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, the national
presidency of which is assured Dr. Durand since his nomination a few weeks
ago without opposition.
Reservations for the banquet may be made with Alumni Secretary J. E.

McDowell, or the Bookstore, and are open to all friends and admirers of
Dr. Durand.
