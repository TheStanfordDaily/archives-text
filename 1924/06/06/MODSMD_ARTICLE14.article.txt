# SENIOR BALL WILL BE FITTING CLIMAX TO EVENTFUL WEEK
## 
### 
—1927—

Plans for the Senior Ball that will
be held in Toyon hall Friday, June 20,
are practically completed. This will
be the last and most elaborate dance
of the year.
A breakfast served after the dance
is to he one of the novel features. At
2:30 the couples will proceed from the
hall to the new Union where break
fast is to be served. During this there
will be entertainments including a
two-piano duet by "Al" Loewenstein
and "Chubby" Tyroler.
The decorative scheme is an origi
nal one and the lighting effect will
be new for the campus. Diferently-col
ored lights will be used for each dance
and will be reflected by a crystal ball
suspended from the ceiling. Flowera
and fountains of colored lights will be
placed in the dancing hall and between
the halls.
The music committee is trying to
get Halstead's 10-piece orchestra from
the St. Francis for the evening. If this
is not possible Height's orchestra from
i California will furnish the music.
