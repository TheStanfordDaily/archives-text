Congratulations are the order of the clay. First to Don Liebendorfer,
who as editor of the Daily made a record to he proud of. Don is not only
an A1 newspaperman, hut one of the best liked and most warm hearted
men who have ever held the position. Working with him was a pleasure,
because he was never too busy to tell you anything you wanted to know,
he never lost his head no matter how tough the going became, and he was
a real personal friend to each and every member of the staff. The best
eulogy we know of can be written in three words—Don Liebendorfer.
Friend.
* And next to the new Editor, Bill Wright. Known to the campus per
haps better as an expert sports writer, his greatest worth to the Daily has
been as an all-around, do-evervthing, handy-man. There isn't a single
solitary thing about the running of such a sheet as this that Bill doesn't
know from A to Z. Like his predecessor, he works best under pressure,
and Stanford can confidently expect the same standards and excellence of
work as have prevailed this year to continue under the new regime.
