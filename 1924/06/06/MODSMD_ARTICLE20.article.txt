To sponsor or not to sponsor. That seems to be quite a question. In
another column is printed a digest of various opinions upon the newest
method for handling the annual crop of incorrigibles. Personally speak
ing, we F"RESHMEN believe the sponsor system has achieved the de
sired results, even if it has been in somewhat of a limited way. Very few
F'RESHMEN found it necessary to consult the sponsors for advice, due
in a large measure to the very excellent On-the-Boat assemblies held the
first part of the year. There is no doubt, however, that the mere know
ledge that we had men near us to whom we might turn in time of need, was
a psychological factor which had no small part in making the past year a
success. As to the matter of discipline and control, we leave that to those
members of the upper classes who are not interesetd in any activity, and
who consequently have a great deal of spare time on their hands for the
discussion and settling of such important problems.
