# "Elijah"
## 
### 
Louis Graveure, the peer of the world's baritones today, will sing the
title role. A chorus of 500 voices are so well trained that they sing as a
quartet. An orchestra of 65 members chosen from the San Francisco
Symphony Orchestra will play, each man an artist. From which you can
gather that in presenting "Elijah" at the stadium next Sunday, the Uni
versity is offering the greatest musical event on the Pacific Coast. The
cultural advantages to be gained from such an event cannot be overesti
mated, and everyone who can possibly do so should feel it a personal duty
to attend. You will like it!
