# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT

### 
Editor, Daily Palo Alto:
Those of us who read the San Fran
cisco Examiner this morning have dis
covered that we have a den of evil on
the campus and those of us who live
in Branner hall, that our domicile is
a hang-out for masked bandits.
In the first place, Branner is not a
headquarters of drunks. As a Branner
inhabitartt for two quarters I have
never personally known or directly
known of any case of drunkenness in
the building. I have been told, how
ever, on good authority, that there
have been some offensive cases, and
Mr. Spencer was making an honest
effort to clear these up.
As to the so-called pitched election
between the "wets" and the "drys," in
which Mr. Spencer was elected, there
was none such. The matter did not
come up until three or four days after
the polling. Furthermore, concerning
the election, there was a sufficient
doubt as to whether Spencer had the
votes of the majority, that an investi
gation committee composed of men
who had not participated in the elec
tion declared it illegal and another
one is to be held Monday night.
However, Mr. Spencer's efforts to
clean up whatever mess there was
will appear to anyone as highly com
mendable. In so cleaning he has been
sevorely accused of overstepping his
authority and making mistakes which

have tended to put Branner in a bad
light before the school. Then, in de
fending himself against these attacks,
Mr. Spencer antagonized not only the
supposed "wets," but a great many
others. Here is the explanation of the
whole mess. The reason that Spencer
was taken out perhaps had its incep
tion in a booze argument, but had not
the severe antagnism been aroused
against Spencer personally there
would have undoubtedly nothing hap
pened.
To cap the climax, the party itself
was so over-played as to be hardly
recognizable. According to the tale,
Spencer was beaten to within an inch
of his life. As a matter of fact I saw
the victim the next morning and, with
the exception of a righteously ruffled
temper, he looked not at all the worse
for wear.
Certainly those who inflicted the
party should be punished severely. No
question there. But any modern uni
versity student knows that paddling
parties are not absolutely foreign. In
most cases they don't hurt the victim
at all, and are taken in good nature
and nobody is any the worse.
It seems nothing but another exam
ple of yellow journulism, giving an
altogether wrong light on what few
facts they did have.
All we ask is that the people apply
the light of reason to the infinite deal
of blackness that has been cast up.
