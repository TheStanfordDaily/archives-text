You know —writing Alfalfa isn't
hard. All you have to have is a mellow
mind and a typewriter. Then you
write three thousand words and, after
cutting out the naughty parts, you
have five hundred words of simple
stuff which appears in the paper if
they can't find enough ads. The other
twenty-five hundred words you send
in to Hot Dog or Captain Billy, who
send it back because it's too tame.
This is an introduction.

Speaking of alfalfa reminds me of a
girl 1 was out with the other night.
I called her up about half an hour
after the beans had been served. In
case that still leaves you in doubt as
to what night ft was, I'll tell you. It
was Sunday.
Her sweet, soft voice answered the
phone, and in response to my query
as to whether she would like to go to
a show, she said, "Oh. I'd love to, but
I haven't eaten yet."
To which I made a fast come-back,
"You go right ahead and eat then. I'll
be over in fifteen minutes."
I thought she seemed rather sore
but I suppose it was because I was
depriving her of my company for that
length of time.
Anyway, we got downtown just in
time to miss getting tickets for the
sood show, and I had seen the other.
So we wandered out by the lake. And
..hat's all you'll know about that.
* * *
But, speaking of girls in general,
and college women in particular, they
ire particular, too much so. In fact,
ioing with a girl around here is ter
•ible. It is just like.trying out for one
jf these manager jobs. You work out
n competition for three years with a
lozen other men. If you're lucky at
ill, you'll survive the first cut and
land among the sophomore candidates.
If you have quite a bit on the ball
you may get to be a junior manager.
But, in the end, after three years'
'competition, you hold the sack. Or
maybe the other guy does. It all de
pends on how you look at it.

Speaking of love—one of the boys
I know fell in it. A trip to Europe
was the cause of his downfall. While
in luxurious, languid Egypt., he fell in
love with a French girl from Pitts
burgh. Anyway, she sent him a bottle
of hair tonic recently, to put on his
hair. Now his friends are singing:
Hell's Bells. How it smells
That stuff just makes us rave.
Heavens above. Oceans of love.
There's a kiss on every wave.
But, to go back —he fell in it, and
I don't mean the hair tonic or maybe.
* * *
She —Do you love me honey?
He —Yes, I love you, dear, but let's
lay off the kissing stuff. I've got to
study for an ex.
Yes, it really happened. Drop around
and see the rehearsals of the Senior
Farce. —Adv.

This space was intended for a re
printing of some of the jokes that A1
Jolson told, but oil second thought we
decided that, while they could be told
on the stage, they couldn't be told
here. You're not on the stage, and be
sides, you didn't pay three dollars for
this paper. After hearing Jolson, we
picked out the only joke that was
clean. Here it is:
She —What business are you in?
He —I am an exporter.
She—An exporter?
He —Yes, the Pullman Company fired
me.

From which you gather that the
other jokes must have been good.
* * *
But, let's get down to eases. Scotch,
Rye, or Quadrangle. Speaking of poli- 1
tics around this here university. No
wonder the Senators go in for oil. A
good guy is an oil can for going into
politics, and you can't blame him for 1
wanting to keep himself well-filled.
* * *
But as yet 3-in-l is strong enough
for the college pork-barrelers. Paddles
would be better and a tubbing or two
would help some.

If you have quite a bit on the ball
you may get to be a junior manager.

Speaking of love—one of the boys
I know fell in it. A trip to Europe
was the cause of his downfall. While
in luxurious, languid Egypt., he fell in
love with a French girl from Pitts
burgh. Anyway, she sent him a bottle
of hair tonic recently, to put on his
hair. Now his friends are singing:
Hell's Bells. How it smells
That stuff just makes us rave.
Heavens above. Oceans of love.
There's a kiss on every wave.
But, to go back —he fell in it, and
I don't mean the hair tonic or maybe.
* * *
She —Do you love me honey?
He —Yes, I love you, dear, but let's
lay off the kissing stuff. I've got to
study for an ex.
Yes, it really happened. Drop around
and see the rehearsals of the Senior
Farce. —Adv.

This space was intended for a re
printing of some of the jokes that A1
Jolson told, but oil second thought we
decided that, while they could be told
on the stage, they couldn't be told
here. You're not on the stage, and be
sides, you didn't pay three dollars for
this paper. After hearing Jolson, we
picked out the only joke that was
clean. Here it is:
She —What business are you in?
He —I am an exporter.
She—An exporter?
He —Yes, the Pullman Company fired
me.

From which you gather that the
other jokes must have been good.
* * *
But, let's get down to eases. Scotch,
Rye, or Quadrangle. Speaking of poli- 1
tics around this here university. No
wonder the Senators go in for oil. A
good guy is an oil can for going into
politics, and you can't blame him for 1
wanting to keep himself well-filled.
* * *
But as yet 3-in-l is strong enough
for the college pork-barrelers. Paddles
would be better and a tubbing or two
would help some.
You know —writing Alfalfa isn't
hard. All you have to have is a mellow
mind and a typewriter. Then you
write three thousand words and, after
cutting out the naughty parts, you
have five hundred words of simple
stuff which appears in the paper if
they can't find enough ads. The other
twenty-five hundred words you send
in to Hot Dog or Captain Billy, who
send it back because it's too tame.
This is an introduction.

Speaking of alfalfa reminds me of a
girl 1 was out with the other night.
I called her up about half an hour
after the beans had been served. In
case that still leaves you in doubt as
to what night ft was, I'll tell you. It
was Sunday.
Her sweet, soft voice answered the
phone, and in response to my query
as to whether she would like to go to
a show, she said, "Oh. I'd love to, but
I haven't eaten yet."
To which I made a fast come-back,
"You go right ahead and eat then. I'll
be over in fifteen minutes."
I thought she seemed rather sore
but I suppose it was because I was
depriving her of my company for that
length of time.
Anyway, we got downtown just in
time to miss getting tickets for the
sood show, and I had seen the other.
So we wandered out by the lake. And
..hat's all you'll know about that.
* * *
But, speaking of girls in general,
and college women in particular, they
ire particular, too much so. In fact,
ioing with a girl around here is ter

jf these manager jobs. You work out
n competition for three years with a
lozen other men. If you're lucky at
ill, you'll survive the first cut and
land among the sophomore candidates.
If you have quite a bit on the ball
