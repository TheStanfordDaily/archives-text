Don't believe more than a tenth of j I
what you hear. Don't do more than
half of what you're told, and argue (
about that, and you'll be a Phi Bete ■
some day. If any house tells you that
they're getting the cream of the class, i
and that you ought to take a button,'
give a look. Maybe they're getting the i
cream, but probably some of the milk i
slipped in, or if it didn't the cream (
is probably sour.

Can swing the paddles, too, my boy.

But here comes my sweet blonde
love, watch the twinkle In her eye. i
she's the girl I'm fondest of, oh she
makes me seye and seye. Every time
I talk to her, my heart quivers like a 1
Ford, wish she was a little burr, just
stuck on me, oh Lord, oh Lord. When
I take her to the lake, Just to walk
around you know, Just to hold her
hand I take, Wish 1 wasn't so darned
slow. Of if she could only feel my
heart thrib and thrab and throb, bet
to her it would reveal that I wasn't
just a slob.
Don't know why I'm writing this,
just- to fill up space I guess, Other
guys get paid for worse, and every
syllable they bless, still I've shown
you all the dope, could write more j
and more and more, but I find I'm out j
or soap, so I'll see you at the store.

And so that's how easy it is to
write alfalfa. I say nothing about
getting anyone to read them, nor one
word of what the readers think about
the product, but after all, the pen is
mightier than the brain.
