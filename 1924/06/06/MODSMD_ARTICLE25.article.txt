D. P. A. Women's Editor To
Make 'Em Weep in New Yawk
Having found the Stanford rough a
poor subject upon which to practice
her subtle art, Miss Mildred Dannen
baum of Parsons, Kansas, and more
lately women's editor of the Daily
Palo Alto, will leave for New York
shortly to apply for a position as sob
sister on a metropolitan daily. Our
heartiest wishes to Mickey, say we.
