# FRESHMEN SET NEW RECORD WITH SEVEN BEAR MEAT FEASTS
## 
### 
—1927 —*

Once upon a time there was a cer
tain FRESHMAN class here at Stan
ford. Furthermore, this class was an
up-and-coming bunch of stalwarts and
decided that past yearling classes had
never received enough credit or ad
vertising. Therefore, showing signs of
"gray matter," they began an advertis
ing campaign, to consist of a series of
victorious battles over their age-old
trans-bay rivals at Berkeley.
The start of the first stage in that
advertising campaign was fine, such
elevens as Modesto Junior College
and San Jose Teachers College falling
before the FRESHMAN offensive. The
U. S. C. encounter was different, the
Stanfordites going down before the
steadier attack of the Trojan babes,
10 to 0.
Babes Undaunted
This setback daunted Coach "Husky"
Hunt's proteges not a bit and the rest
of the preliminary season up to the
California battle was run through with
a clean slate.
Two things weakened the babes'
pre-game prospects for a victory over
the Blue and Gold. One was the U. S.
C. defeat and the other the fact that
never before in history had a Card
babe eleven downed a Bruin yearling
squad. However, anticipated breaks
did not appear, history did not run
true to form, and a superior Stanford
team trounced the invading Bears, 12-
0. So ended the first stage.
Much Reserve Material
One of the most pleasant realiza
tions for Card gridiron fans arising
from the 1927 football season is that
Hunt developed material which will
greatly augment "Pop" Warner's re
serve strength next year.
Which reminds me of that saying—
I believe Cyrus McCormick coined it —
"As 'Husky' sows, so shall 'Pop' reap."
As a second step in their "Glory-for
*27" campaign, the BABES proceeded
to sweep through the basketball sea
son up to the California series with
twelve successive and decisive vic
tories. And then, on the thirteenth of
March and in their thirteenth game
of the season, the Card five downed
the Bears, 29 to 22. The second con
test went to California, 9 to 14; but
the third, and with it the series, was
won by Stanford, 27 to 20 —the first
Card yearling win since 1917.
The season's total of points read:
Stanford, 352; opponents, 195.
As in football, Hunt made Kerr a
present of a nice healthy, fast-stepping
and accurate-shooting squad of year
ling basketballers to be used in 1925.
Tracksters Win
"But why stop here?" reasoned 1927
after taking the Bear court five down
a notch, and for the second time dur
ing the year pulled the "never-before
in-history" stunt by trimming the
Bruin tracksters, 83 1-4 to 47 3-4, and
taking twelve out of fifteen firsts.
This was a brilliant ending of a
brilliant season. A combination of five
teams from Chico high, Modesto high
and junior college, and Sacramento
high and junior college were defeated
84 to 33. The same performance was
repeated against the Oakland and
Berkeley prep teams by a score of
70 1-2 to 50 1-2. The third and last
win of the preliminary season was
scored over eight combined squads of
the Peninsula Athletic League, 97 to
25.
Although the Card diamonders lost
both of their clashes with the Blue
and Gold in the annual series, the pre
liminary season was much brighter.
Fifteen victories and only two defeats
were chalked up by them in the seven
teen pre-series games played.
Major-sport athletes of the yearling
class have, perhaps, received greater
recognition and praise the past year,
but it was their minor-sport class
mates who chalked up four additional
victories over California squads, and,
therefore, additional praise to 1927.
Swimmers Win Easily
After taking easy wins from the
Olympic Club juniors and Alameda
high school, the Card yearling swim
ming team gave the California pad
dlers a bad trouncing, 59 to 9. Three
records were broken.
The babe water polo seven also
handed the Bears a bad beating, scor
ing 13 points to their opponents' one.
Golf Makes Entry
Golf made a hopeful entry onto the
list of freshman sports when the Card
yearlings won over the Bruin team, 10
to 7, on the Burlingame links.
squad, Byerly, Lang, McLean, and
Hinckley show prospects of being var
sity material.
Soccer ended a mediocre season
when the Stanford eleven took the
second of a two-game series from
California by the score of 4 to 1. The
first game was a 1-1 tie. Few of the
soccer varsity leave the University
this year but five FRESHMEN loom
up as contenders for varsity positions.
And now, keeping in mind that
FRESHMEN are not always thus, let
us rise and repeat in unison that old
favorite of Luther Burbank's —or was
it John Davey's?—"Mighty oaks from
little acorns grow."
