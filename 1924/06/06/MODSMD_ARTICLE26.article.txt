# FRESHMEN SET NEW RECORD WITH SEVEN BEAR MEAT FEASTS
## 
### 
—1927 —*

Once upon a time there was a cer
tain FRESHMAN class here at Stan
ford. Furthermore, this class was an
up-and-coming bunch of stalwarts and
decided that past yearling classes had
never received enough credit or ad
vertising. Therefore, showing signs of
"gray matter," they began an advertis
ing campaign, to consist of a series of
victorious battles over their age-old
trans-bay rivals at Berkeley.
The start of the first stage in that
advertising campaign was fine, such
elevens as Modesto Junior College
and San Jose Teachers College falling
before the FRESHMAN offensive. The
U. S. C. encounter was different, the
Stanfordites going down before the
steadier attack of the Trojan babes,
10 to 0.
Babes Undaunted
This setback daunted Coach "Husky"
Hunt's proteges not a bit and the rest
of the preliminary season up to the
California battle was run through with
a clean slate.
Two things weakened the babes'
pre-game prospects for a victory over
the Blue and Gold. One was the U. S.
C. defeat and the other the fact that
never before in history had a Card
babe eleven downed a Bruin yearling
squad. However, anticipated breaks
did not appear, history did not run
true to form, and a superior Stanford
team trounced the invading Bears, 12-
0. So ended the first stage.
Much Reserve Material
One of the most pleasant realiza
tions for Card gridiron fans arising
from the 1927 football season is that
Hunt developed material which will
greatly augment "Pop" Warner's re
serve strength next year.
Which reminds me of that saying—
I believe Cyrus McCormick coined it —
"As 'Husky' sows, so shall 'Pop' reap."
As a second step in their "Glory-for
*27" campaign, the BABES proceeded
to sweep through the basketball sea
son up to the California series with
twelve successive and decisive vic
tories. And then, on the thirteenth of
March and in their thirteenth game
of the season, the Card five downed
the Bears, 29 to 22. The second con
test went to California, 9 to 14; but
the third, and with it the series, was
won by Stanford, 27 to 20 —the first
Card yearling win since 1917.
The season's total of points read:
Stanford, 352; opponents, 195.
As in football, Hunt made Kerr a
present of a nice healthy, fast-stepping
and accurate-shooting squad of year
ling basketballers to be used in 1925.
Tracksters Win
"But why stop here?" reasoned 1927
after taking the Bear court five down
a notch, and for the second time dur
ing the year pulled the "never-before
in-history" stunt by trimming the
Bruin tracksters, 83 1-4 to 47 3-4, and
taking twelve out of fifteen firsts.
This was a brilliant ending of a
brilliant season. A combination of five
teams from Chico high, Modesto high
and junior college, and Sacramento
high and junior college were defeated
84 to 33. The same performance was
repeated against the Oakland and
Berkeley prep teams by a score of
70 1-2 to 50 1-2. The third and last
win of the preliminary season was
scored over eight combined squads of
