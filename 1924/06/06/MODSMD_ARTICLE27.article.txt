# INITIAL STANFORD GOLF CLUB FORMED BY FIRST-YEAR MEN
## Encina Links Organization Downs William Warren Players 8 to 4 
### 
—1927—

—1927—

Organizing the first FRESHMAN
golf organization on the Pacific Coast
and the first golf club of any kind to
be formed on the Stanford campus,
the class of 1927 took the lead in a
movement to raise the links game to
Its rightful position in athletics.
Forty first-year men signed the roll
as charter members when the organi
zation was formed in the early part
of the winter quarter, and ten addi
tional players joined within the next
four weeks. They adopted the name
of the Encina Golf Club and chose
Eli Dorsey of San Diego president.
A six-man team composed of Byer
ly, Lang, McLean, Mclnnes, Klauber,
and Dorsey, was at once organized
for match play. In its first tournament
Encina defeated the William Warren
school, which boasts some of the best
junior golfers in the state, by a score
of 8 to 4. Negotiations were conducted
with several high schools of the bay
region, but through failure to settle
upon satisfactory dates matches were
not arranged.
Club Players Beat Bears
In March the Encina players, repre
senting the Stanford FRESHMEN, ad
ministered a 10 to 7 trimming to the
California FRESHMEN in the first
match ever played between the year
lings of the two institutions. It was
also the first victory ever scored over
the Blue and Gold by a Stanford golf
team.
A handicap medal play tournament
was held on the Lincoln Park munici
pal links at San Francisco on May 2.
Twenty-two made the round, Jack
Leiter winning the low net trophy and
Lloyd Byerly the low gross.
Plan Stanford Links
The organization has three primary
aims—first, to provide a first-class
golf course for Stanford students;
second, to develop a large number of
good golfers who will learn for the
Cardinal the place it deserves in inter
collegiate competition; and third, to
raise the royal and ancient game to
first-class minor sport standing in the
University.
Stanford is the most backward Uni
versity on the Pacific Coast in golf,

mainly for the reason that it has no
links upon which Us players can
practice. Because of having the larg
est campus in the world it possesses
greater natural advantages for golf
than any of its sister colleges. A
course was laid out back of President
Wilbur's home several years ago but,
due to lack of funds, it was never
completed.
President Dorsey of the Encina club

! believes that the athletica-for-all pro
gram being carried on in the Univer
sity at the present time ia inconsis
tent in that it Includes no provisions
for golf—the one game that can be
played by every one throughout life.
He declares that, contrary to popular
belief, golf is a young man's game
and that no golfer has ever really
become great who took up the pastime
after he became thirty. He points to

the great number of municipal links
throughout the country to support his
contention.

Morton Kaer, Trojan FRESHMAN,
looks like a good possibility for the
American Olympic team in the pen
thalon and 440-metre hurdles. In the
southern Olympic tryouts, he won the
400 hurdles, the broad jump, and came
in third in the javelin. Kaer last year
composed a one-man team from Red
Bluff high and tied with the ten-man
Hollywood high team for third in the
national interscholastic meet, Chicago.

mainly for the reason that it has no
links upon which Us players can
practice. Because of having the larg

greater natural advantages for golf

course was laid out back of President
Wilbur's home several years ago but,
due to lack of funds, it was never
completed.

He declares that, contrary to popular

the great number of municipal links

Morton Kaer, Trojan FRESHMAN,
looks like a good possibility for the
American Olympic team in the pen
thalon and 440-metre hurdles. In the
southern Olympic tryouts, he won the
400 hurdles, the broad jump, and came
in third in the javelin. Kaer last year
composed a one-man team from Red
Bluff high and tied with the ten-man
Hollywood high team for third in the
national interscholastic meet, Chicago.

Organizing the first FRESHMAN
golf organization on the Pacific Coast
and the first golf club of any kind to
be formed on the Stanford campus,
the class of 1927 took the lead in a
movement to raise the links game to
Its rightful position in athletics.
Forty first-year men signed the roll
as charter members when the organi
zation was formed in the early part
of the winter quarter, and ten addi
tional players joined within the next
four weeks. They adopted the name
of the Encina Golf Club and chose
Eli Dorsey of San Diego president.
A six-man team composed of Byer
ly, Lang, McLean, Mclnnes, Klauber,
and Dorsey, was at once organized
for match play. In its first tournament
Encina defeated the William Warren
school, which boasts some of the best
junior golfers in the state, by a score
of 8 to 4. Negotiations were conducted
with several high schools of the bay
region, but through failure to settle
upon satisfactory dates matches were
not arranged.
Club Players Beat Bears
In March the Encina players, repre
senting the Stanford FRESHMEN, ad
ministered a 10 to 7 trimming to the
California FRESHMEN in the first
match ever played between the year
lings of the two institutions. It was
also the first victory ever scored over
the Blue and Gold by a Stanford golf
team.
A handicap medal play tournament
was held on the Lincoln Park munici
pal links at San Francisco on May 2.
Twenty-two made the round, Jack
Leiter winning the low net trophy and
Lloyd Byerly the low gross.
Plan Stanford Links
The organization has three primary
aims—first, to provide a first-class
golf course for Stanford students;
second, to develop a large number of
good golfers who will learn for the
Cardinal the place it deserves in inter
collegiate competition; and third, to
raise the royal and ancient game to
first-class minor sport standing in the
University.
