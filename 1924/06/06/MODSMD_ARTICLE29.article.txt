# VICTORY OVER CUBS FEATURES FRESHMAN DEBATING ACTIVITIES
## 
### 
—1927—

For the second consecutive year the
FRESHMAN debating teams under
the coaching of Bert Levit have de
feated the first-year men from Cali
fornia. In the past two simultaneous
debates have been held each year with
the Blue and Gold but this year a
triangular affair was staged, with the
College of the Pacific as the third
party.
Each season intercollegiate FRESH
MAN debating is becoming a stronger
institution, serving to bring out pro
spective varsity material. Raymond
Bruce, of this year's team, has a good
easy delivery and promises to be good
material for next year's varsity.
Bruce gave the closing argument
for the affirmative side. His col
leagues were Ted Baer and Lloyd Sul
livan. The negative team was com
posed of Craven Scott, Harold Peter
son, and Rex Kramer. Kramer gave
the closing argument in a convincing
manner and is also" considered good
varsity material.
Affirmative Wins 3-0
In the debate this year the subject
was the recognition of Russia. The
Stanford affirmative defeated the Cali
fornia negative by a three-to-nothing
decision, while the negative lost to
the College of the Pacific by a two-to
one score. The California affirmative
won from C. O. P. three to nothing.
The negative was in every respect
the hardest side of the question, as
was shown by the defeat of all nega
tive teams. Stanford debaters evi
denced their superiority by getting a
total of four decisions to California's
three and Pacific's two.
It is at present undecided whether
the annual forensic meet will be kept
a triangular affair or whether it will
revert to the former simultaneous
dtyle, with California as the only op
ponent. According to Levit the system
tried this year was found unsatisfac
tory.
