# DR. HENRY SUZZALLO WILL DELIVER MAIN COMMENCEMENT TALK
## 
### 
—1927—

Approximately 500 degrees will be
awarded to seniors and graduates
when the thirty-third annual com
mencement exercises are held in the
Memorial Church Monday, June 23, at
11 o'clock.
Rr. Henry Suzzallo, president of the
University of Washington, will give
the commencement address. Dr. Suz
zallo is a graduate of Stanford Univer
sity, earning his degree in 1899.
Owing to the inability to accommo
date everyone desiring to witness the
exercises, each candidate for degrees
has been given the privilege of ex
tending two invitations and in some
cases an additional one to a relative.
The announcements have been so
worded this year as not to be con
strued as an invitation. An unlimited
number is now on sale at the Book
store and may be sent out to all
friends and relatives.
The academic procession composed
of the seniors, candidates for ad
vanced degrees, faculty members, and
the Board of Trustees will form in the
corridor of the inner quadrangle.
