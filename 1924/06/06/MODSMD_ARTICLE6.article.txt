# SPECTACULAR MUSICAL EVENT IS READY FOR PRESENTATION
## Joint Rehearsals of the Entire Cast, Combined Chorus, and Orchestra Complete Work On "Elijah" 
### 
1927'

With a concluding stadium rehears
al Saturday, which will include for
the first time the entire cast, com
bined chorus, together with the
orchestra, the preparation for the
"Elijah" to be presented in the
stadium Sunday, will be complete.
This presentation of Mendelssohn's
much-loved oratorio will be the great
est musical event ever attempted on
the Stanford campus, and according to
some authorities, in the history of the
West.
The oratorio contains intensely
dramatic music and with a chorus of
young voices combined, with adequate
music, the effect should be over
whelming. Director W. D. Allen says
that at the first stadium rehearsal
last Sunday, when only about two hun
dred members of the chorus were pres
ent, the effect was one of extreme
beauty.
"Elijah" was chosen for the oratorio
because of its popularity and famili
arity. In addition to this, two of the
choruses, The Peninsula Chorus and
the Chorus of the College of the Pa
cific, have recently sung the Elijah

o

and so already know the music. In ad
dition to this, "Elijah" has great dra
matic appeal.
Based on Prophet's Life
The story is based on the life and
difficulties of the Hebrew prophet,
Elijah. He appears before the court of
King Ahab and Queen Jezebel, where
he proclaims the coming of a great
drought as punishment for those who
insistently worship Baal and forsake
the Lord.
The story carries through the inci
dent in which the Lord sent fire to
consume Elijah's sacrifice to prove
His infinite power before non-believ
ers; through the scene in which the
prophet restores to life the widow's
son at whose home he sought shelter
in time of stress; and finally, to Mt.
Horeb, where he went to find the Lord
in storm and thunder and found Him
in none of these, but in the "still
small voice which came after and
whose message none shall know."
Graveure's wonderful voice will
dominate the production. He has a
great part and is well prepared to
make the most of it. He is supposed

—1927

to have the best baritone voice on the
concert stage. Although his work is
uniformly good, he excels in oratorio
work which is a cross between con
cert and opera. He is ably supported


Mme. Constance Balfour
by Harold Procter, one of the finest
tenors ever heard in Southern Cali
fornia, and by Constance Balfour and
Blanche Hamilton Fox, both of whom
have exceptionally beautiful and well
trained voices.

Chorus of 500
The choral work will be of excep
tional beauty. There are something
under five hundred voices after such
weeding out as was necessary had
been completed.
Allen set his dead line at 500, but
said he could have easily gotten a
chorus twice as large. He believes
that the greatest effects can be gained
from the use.of men and women of col
lege age with enough older voices to
give volume and initiative experience.
The different choruses have re
hearsed separately but under the su
pervision of Allen. The first combined
rehearsal on Wednesday evening was
thoroughly satisfactory and he expects
the choruses to be one of the great
features of the performance. The men
and women in the Stanford-Palo Alto
chorus first learned their parts sepa
rately and combined afterwards with
unusual ease and speed.
The performance of the "Elijah" is
the top-notch of choral work at Stan
ford. It has been the custom for a
number of years to give a big ora
torio annually in the Memorial Church.
The most memorable was the presen
taton of Verdi's "Requiem" in 1919,
which was given in memory of Stan
ford men and women who had fallen
in the World War.
Stadium Good Auditorium
In the opera given in 1921 it was
discovered that Stanford has a per
fect outdoor auditorium. The acous
tics are unapproachable, and even the
least sound can be heard all over the
stadium. The stage this year will be
placed, not in the middle of the field
as it was during the operas, but over
the shot-put circle, at the closed end
of the horseshoe.
The production is immense and has
been ably handled throughout. It is a
great thing for Stanford since it fo
cuses attention upon the University
in its cultural side as well as ath
letics. Allen hopes to make this a
forerunner of a series of similar per
formances, and through this medium
to create interest sufficient for the
establishment of a department of
music, which in his opinion, is badly
needed on the campus.
