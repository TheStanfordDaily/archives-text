# SPECTACULAR MUSICAL EVENT IS READY FOR PRESENTATION
## Joint Rehearsals of the Entire Cast, Combined Chorus, and Orchestra Complete Work On "Elijah" 
### 
1927'

With a concluding stadium rehears
al Saturday, which will include for
the first time the entire cast, com
bined chorus, together with the
orchestra, the preparation for the
"Elijah" to be presented in the
stadium Sunday, will be complete.
This presentation of Mendelssohn's
much-loved oratorio will be the great
est musical event ever attempted on
the Stanford campus, and according to
some authorities, in the history of the
West.
The oratorio contains intensely
dramatic music and with a chorus of
young voices combined, with adequate
music, the effect should be over
whelming. Director W. D. Allen says
that at the first stadium rehearsal
last Sunday, when only about two hun
dred members of the chorus were pres
ent, the effect was one of extreme
beauty.
"Elijah" was chosen for the oratorio
because of its popularity and famili
arity. In addition to this, two of the
choruses, The Peninsula Chorus and
the Chorus of the College of the Pa
cific, have recently sung the Elijah

o

and so already know the music. In ad
dition to this, "Elijah" has great dra
matic appeal.
Based on Prophet's Life
The story is based on the life and
difficulties of the Hebrew prophet,
Elijah. He appears before the court of
King Ahab and Queen Jezebel, where
he proclaims the coming of a great
drought as punishment for those who
insistently worship Baal and forsake
the Lord.
The story carries through the inci
dent in which the Lord sent fire to
consume Elijah's sacrifice to prove
His infinite power before non-believ
ers; through the scene in which the
prophet restores to life the widow's
son at whose home he sought shelter
in time of stress; and finally, to Mt.
Horeb, where he went to find the Lord
in storm and thunder and found Him
in none of these, but in the "still
small voice which came after and
whose message none shall know."
Graveure's wonderful voice will
dominate the production. He has a
great part and is well prepared to
make the most of it. He is supposed

—1927

to have the best baritone voice on the
concert stage. Although his work is
uniformly good, he excels in oratorio
work which is a cross between con
cert and opera. He is ably supported
