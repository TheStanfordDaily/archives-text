# SPONSOR SYSTEM HELPS ATHLETICS, SCHOLARSHIP
## Freshman Vigilance Committee Replaces Sophomore Discipline Successfully 
### 
1927'

â€¢1927-

The sponsor system is unanimously
voted a success by faculty, sponsors,
freshmen, and students at large.
A raising of scholarship, a wider
extension of friendship, and a spirit
of enthusiasm which has carried the
class of 1927 to a series of athletic
triumphs, are pointed out as the chief
benefits of the system.
The sponsor system, as carried out
this year, has done away with sopho
more discipline, placing the responsi
bility of keeping up traditions directly
in the hands of the freshmen them
selves. A freshman vigilance commit
tee was organized for this purpose
and meted out punishment several
times to the wayward frosh.
Several times throughout the year
general class meetings were held
under the auspices of the sponsors at
which time "on the boat" talks were
given.
Culver Lauds Sponsors
Dean Culver says the results of the

system were much more favorable
than expected. "The general spirit
which the freshmen have promoted
among themselves and the opportunity
to know each other, I believe, is large
ly responsible for the success of the
class of 1927 in athletics," he stated.
"The University is especially grati
fied at the scholarship showing of the
class which has been raised a con
siderable per cent and which can be
traced directly to the sponsor system.
Living at the hall together the men
have made friendships which they
would otherwise have lost. The action
taken by the interfraternity confer
ence recently indicates that the living
togther for one year is generally re
cognized as being worth while."
Beardsley, Masters Favor System
As an opinion from students at large
Charles Ueardsley, president-elect of
the student body, said, "I believe the
success of the sponsor system this
year is ample proof of its worth and
certainly warrants its retention
The freshmen this year may have
broken traditions to some extent but
it is much better to put them "on the
boat" through the advice of older stu
dents and their own initiative, than
by sophomore discipline."
A1 Masters, president of the student
body, and a sponsor, believes that the
freshmen and University both have
greatly benefited. He said, "What if
the freshmen have broken a few tra
ditions? The benefits that the Univer
sity and the freshmen have derived
certainly offsets the little harm that
has been done by failure to comply
with traditions. The system iB not per
fet but improvements will come year
by year."
The concensus of opinion seems to
be that the sponsors have accom
plished a great deal this year, and the
system should make even greater
strides in the near future towards set
tling the difficult question of FRESH
MAN discipline and control.
