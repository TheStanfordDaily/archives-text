A Summer for Travel
$ 12S takes you to Europe
* A WHOLE summer free! It may never
A happen again—once your college
days are over, Europe! You need at least
two months to get a real glimpse at her
marvelous art treasures —her gay, fasci
nating cities —her stirring events. The
Olympic Games —the races at Epsom
and Deauville —the British Empire Ex
hibition —these are all great numbers
on this summer's program.
Your Expenses
can be kept down. $125 takes you over
second cabin on a great steamer. Com
fort—merry company — plenty of pas
titnes. Second cabin accommodations
♦ are being more and more sought after
by travelers who want comfort at a
moderate cost. Then there are the great
luxury ships—the Majestic—largest in
the world—the Homeric—the Olympic
—fitly called "The Magnificent Trio".
Our services offer sailings to five Euro
pean countries.
