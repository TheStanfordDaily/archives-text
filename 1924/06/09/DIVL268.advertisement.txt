Mothers!
Give the children WRIGLEY'S
after every meal
A prominent physician says:
"It is surprising how free from decay
the teeth can be kept by using gum
after each meal.'\
You know how hard it is -viP
to get the children to clean \bflttJ
their teeth. By giving 'MHj
them WRIGLEY'S you not IUBH
only reward them for clean- jrajH
ing their teeth, but the
reward is actually the
means of performing this $
important service!
WRIGLEY'S aids digestion
too, and acts as an anti
septic wash for the mouth
and throat. Sev-
eral flavors-all of n
WRIG LEY 7.
