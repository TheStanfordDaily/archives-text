# CARDINAL NETMEN WIN FROM DAVIS CUP TEAM
## Australians in Poor Condition After Tennis Tournament At Sacramento 
### 
In spite of all dope to the contrary,
the Anzac Davis Cup team lost three
out of three matches to the Stanford
team and the Kinsey brothers Friday
afternoon. The Australians had just
finished a strenuous week of playing
in the Central California Champion
ship tournament at Sacramento and
were in poor condition.
Overfelt Defeats Kalms
In the only singles event of the
day, Harold Overfelt defeated Kalms
of the Australian team 6-3, 6-3. While
many of the games were close,-there
was never any doubt as to the winner
of the match. Kalms' playing, like all
of the Anzac's, was very erratic, owing
to the long ocean trip.
The Kinsey brothers had no diffi
culty in winning from Patterson and
O'Hara-Wood, the two best men of the
visiting team, by the score of 6-0, 6-3.
The perfect teamwork of the Kinseys
was largely responsible for the victory.
Third Match Most Interesting
Dick Hinckley and Ted Mertz also
won from Kalms and Schlesinger,
6-3, 3-6, 6-4. This was the only match
in which the visitors had a chance of
winning, and was the most interesting
one of the afternoon. Every game was
hard fought.
