# ESCAPE FROM LIFE IS CHIEF OBJECT OF TODAY-DR .ROBERTS
## 
### 
Modern amusements and diversions
are so numerous that one would think
escape from life is the chief object
today, according to Dr. Richard Rob
erts, of the American Church of Mon
treal, who spoke in the Memorial
Church yesterday.
"We each select our own personal
world, suited to our tastes and tem
peraments," said Dr. Roberts. "We ex
clude all that does not please us, but
are nevertheless unhappy, for we are
unable to maintain these ideal worlds."
Dr. Roberts stressed the necessity
for intellectual and moral realism, for
"looking the world in the face." He
believes that this alone is the secret
of happiness.
The speaker enumerated the vari
ous modes of escape from things as
they are: day dreaming, entertain
ments, such as the motion pictures.
Religion in Christianity means the
acceptance of life on the huge scale,!
in the grand manner. It is necessary
to establish a contact with the spiri
tual in order to face life, and interpret
its facts.
