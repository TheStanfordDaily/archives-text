# FIVE DORMITORIES ORGANIZE TO FORM INTER-HALL GROUP
## 
### 
To promote co-operation between
non-fraternity men and to raise the
standard of non-fraternity life on the
campus, the organization of men's
inter-hall federation has been com
pleted. The plan has been adopted by
all the men's halls except Branner,
practically without dissenting vote.
Branner votes on the measure tonight.
Membership in the federation is
open to all non-fraternity men, the
residents of the five halls automati
cally becoming members. The only
requirement is that members be above
freshman standing.
The organization and government of
the federation will be through a coun
cil of ten. Five of these will be the
presidents of the various hall clubs,
and the other five will be elected, one
from each hall by a vote at large of
all the halls.
This council is given power to de
cide all cases of dispute between the
halls and to regulate the policy of the
hall clubs insofar as they affect the
non-fraternity group. It is also given
power to levy an equal per capita tax
upon the club groups. There can be
an appeal from any decision of the
council to a popular vote of all the
members on petition of fifty names.
According to the men who have
been presenting the proposition, the
federation is not intended to destroy
the identity of the various hall clubs, j
but to cement them together in closer (
relationship. It is planned that the i
greater organization will present one
or two formal dances each year and j
one or two non-fraternity smokers.
The federation is not modeled upon
the inter-fraternity council or upon i
any other campus organization. The 1
members of the federation will be)
members of that organization directly,'
and not only through their own hall

clubs. Means are provided in the con
stitution whereby men not living in
any of the halls may become members
of the club, but details of this will be
left to the council of ten.
Considerable effort has been spent
to get the matter accepted early
enough this spring to permit final or
ganization of the council before school
closes. Then activities of the organi
zation could begin immediately with
the opening of the University in the
fall.
If Branner hall accepts the plan to
night, it will bring the total member
ship for this year up to about six
hundred. It is expected that this will
be about the average number during
several years to come.

power to levy an equal per capita tax
upon the club groups. There can be
an appeal from any decision of the
council to a popular vote of all the
members on petition of fifty names.
According to the men who have
been presenting the proposition, the
federation is not intended to destroy
the identity of the various hall clubs, j
but to cement them together in closer (
relationship. It is planned that the i
greater organization will present one
or two formal dances each year and j
one or two non-fraternity smokers.
The federation is not modeled upon
the inter-fraternity council or upon i
any other campus organization. The 1
members of the federation will be)
members of that organization directly,'
and not only through their own hall

clubs. Means are provided in the con
stitution whereby men not living in
any of the halls may become members
of the club, but details of this will be
left to the council of ten.
Considerable effort has been spent
to get the matter accepted early
enough this spring to permit final or
ganization of the council before school
closes. Then activities of the organi
zation could begin immediately with
the opening of the University in the
fall.
If Branner hall accepts the plan to
night, it will bring the total member
ship for this year up to about six
hundred. It is expected that this will
be about the average number during
several years to come.
