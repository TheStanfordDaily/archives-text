# We're to Blame

Students, faculty, and alumni of Stanford University were shocked
last Friday morning by screaming headlines, in San Francisco papers, in
which Branner Hall was made the center of a most disagreeable scandal.
The most unfortunate thing about the whole affair is that the newspapers
over-played their stories.
After thorough investigation, the Daily Palo Alto has arrived at the
conclusion that the mess arose through personal feeling against the unfor
tunate victim of the "spanking" party. The Daily will not discuss, in this
connection, whether or not that feeling is justified.
It must be admitted that there were some elements of truth in the
things which were said. There was a tubbing party and there was an elec
tion fracas. The connection between these two affairs and a "wet" and
"dry" struggle in Branner, however, is very remote if it exists at all, the
Daily Palo Alto believes.
In spite of the fact that the stories which appeared in San Francisco
newspapers showed utter lack of knowledge of conditions at Stanford and
were typical of the "yellow journalism" era. the fault lies largely on the
campus, among the students. The Daily KNOWS positively that the
story was NOT sent to San Francisco by any campus correspondent. It
was handled by a regular staff member who was .sent here to cover the
story. Evidently, the man who wrote that story must have gotten some
first hand information.
Right here is the place where we can only accept the blame for our
selves. The student who gave out the information was evidently preju
dicedâ€”so much so that he did not stop to think of the bad publicity he was
giving the University. The informant, without doubt, gave the re
porter to understand that the "wet" and "dry" trouble was the root of the
whole thing.
Stanford has been particularly fortunate, this year, in having been free
from such scandals. This fact makes the present situation, coming at the
end of the college year, all the more unfortunate. We do not propose to
cover up, here, when unhealthy conditions exist, but we do resent any
unfair insinuations and declarations in newspaper stories. We can easily
avoid such by using our heads. Had the man who gave the story to the
reporter thought of the University before considering his own feelings
and following the dictates of his own-prejudices, the story might never
have appeared, or at least it would have been put out in a much less atroc
ious light.
Going back just a little farther. The paper which published the story
first, got the "tip" from someone "on the inside," that is, someone who
knew at least something about the situation. That person is a member of
the Stanford community, undoubtedly. Had he or she been judicious
enough to ascertain the complete facts before talking, the rumors afoot
would have never developed to the extent which they did.
