# Thank You, Mr. Allen

### 
The Daily Palo Alto, in behalf of the Associated Students of Stanford
University, wishes to thank Warren D. Allen for bringing the oratorio,
"Elijah" here. Mr. Allen was altogether responsible for the idea and he
handled the production entirely.
Through his efforts, Stanford took the lead among western universi
ties, in offering the kind of entertainment which "Elijah" typifies. The
University, in helping to advance the popularity of such productions, is
taking a step forward. The large crowd which witnessed the presentation
yesterday bears testimony to the success of the venture.
Warren D. Allen is to be congratulated on his initiative and foresight.
Men like Allen are a great asset to the University.
