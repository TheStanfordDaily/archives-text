# Y. M. C. A. TO FURNISH CLOTHES TO VETERANS
## 
### 
The campus unit of the Y. M. C. A.
is planing to make a collection of old
clothes at all men's living groups,
which will be distributed among the
men at the Palo Alto Base Hospital.
Receptacles will be placed on each
floor of the dormitories and in each of
the fraternity houses during the com
ing week.
Students are asked to contribute
any form of clothing that is in a ser
vicable condition, for many of the men
who are soon to be released do not
own any personal property.
