# SORORITY QUESTION TO BE SUBJECT OF TEST VOTE TONIGHT
## 
### 
A test vote on the question of
the sororities of Stanford, and the
completion of the vote 011 the estab
lishment of a sponsor system in Roble
hall, women's dormitory, will he taken
at chapter meetings of the women's
houses tonight, according to recent de
cisions of Women's Council and Pan
Hellenic.
The question on which the sororities
will vote is, "Do you thing sororities
are advisable and do you think their
existence at Stanford is justifiable."
Six of the ten houses have already
voted favorably on the proposed plan
to eestablish a sponsor system
for women in Roble similar to that
used by the men in Encina, freshman
dormitory. A favorable vote by one of
the four remaining sororities, Alpha
Phi, Gamma Phi Beta, Delta Gamma,
and Pi Beta Phi, will insure the estab
lishment of the system, as only a
seven to three vote is necessary for
adoption. This matter comes before
the houses on the recommendation of
Women's Council.
The decision to take a vote on the
sorority question follows a previous
decision to let the matter rest for this
year. After the question was first
brought up. Pan Hellenic and the
Alumnae Council, where the resolution
originated, decided that action had
been somewhat premature, inasmuch
as nothing could be accomplished this
year because of shortage of time. The
University trustees will not meet until
later in June, and no answer could be
obtained from them even should the
women vote against the Greek-letter
houses, it was announced.
With this announcement, it was de-
finitely stated that the matter is by
no means to he regarded as a dead
issue, hut will he brought up for set
tlement certainly within the next two
years, when more definite plans for
caring for the girls should they wish
to discontinue in the sororities may
be presented.

While the present' test vote is not
binding, it is probable that it will have
some significance in the preparation
of future plans for action.
