# No. 9. OPIUM QUESTION
## 
### 
Estimated to be the greatest opium
consuming country in the world, the
United States naturally shows much
interest in efforts being made by the
League of Nations to curb the traffic.
Whatever has been the opinion of the
United States in regard to the League
itself, there has been no doubt of its
response and co-operation on matters
concerning this vital question.
Under Article XXIII of the Cove
nant, the League of Nations is charged
with the duty of securing international
co-operation in the fight for the con
trol of the traffic in opium and dan
gerous drugs. This matter was the
subject of international action before
the war, but the need for some con
tinuous central body, watching over
and stimulating action in this matter
in all countries concerned, has been
badly felt.
Primary Moves
When the matter was first taken up
by the League, a measure was passed
making for the progressive suppres
sion of production and limiting the use
of opium to medicinal purposes. This
measure was passed by the Assembly
with but a single change, the word
"medicinal" being changed to "legiti
mate." This was unfortunate, for "le
gitimate" is open to elastic interpreta
tion, while "medicinal" is definite. As
an example we might take the condi
tions in India. There the natives eat
opium and consider it part of their
diet. Under the loose interpretation
of "legitimate," opium could be used
in India to the same extent as at
present.
The United States entered into the
work in May, 1923. At this time two
proposals were made, namely, that the
use of opium be limited to medicinal
and scientific purposes only, and that
production be curtailed. By this time
the committee had realized that "le
gitimate" was too wide a term, and

>that consumption could never be regu
lated without regulating production.
These proposals were accepte with
two exceptions, (1) that suppression
be gradual, and (2) that the use of
raw opium in India was not illegiti
mate. The wording thus did not say
it was legitimate, but it was claimed
that raw opium in the hot Indian cli
mate does not have the devastating
effect of the prepared opium.
Professor Payson J. Treat of Ihe His
tory department made the following state
ment regarding the opium question:
"In 1909 the first international con
ference for the study of the opium
evil assembled at Shanghai. The
United States took the lead in bring
ing about this first step toward meet
ing a growing menace to human wel
fare. Other conferences were held at
The Hague, but the World War check
ed the progress of this international
co-operation. Now the League of Na
tions is trying to find the best way to
prevent the illegitimate use of opium
and other harmful drugs. If it suc
ceeds the achievement alone would
justify its existence.
Difficult Problem
"But the problem is a most difficult
one. Opium is produced principally in
India, China, Turkey, and Persia. In
China the production is carried on
under official protection but in viola
tion of* national law. In Turkey and
Persia governmental regulation of pro
duction and consumption can not be
effectively enforced. Only in India can
effective steps be taken at present.
"The League of Nations can, how
ever, investigate the evil and draw up
a plan for checking it, and it can
gather information as to the way in
which the nations keep such obliga
tions as they may assume in the mat
ter. In this way the League can ren
der far more effective services than
occasional international conferences."

consuming country in the world, the
United States naturally shows much
interest in efforts being made by the
League of Nations to curb the traffic.
Whatever has been the opinion of the
United States in regard to the League
itself, there has been no doubt of its
response and co-operation on matters
concerning this vital question.
Under Article XXIII of the Cove
nant, the League of Nations is charged
with the duty of securing international
co-operation in the fight for the con
trol of the traffic in opium and dan
gerous drugs. This matter was the
subject of international action before
the war, but the need for some con
tinuous central body, watching over
and stimulating action in this matter
in all countries concerned, has been
badly felt.
Primary Moves
When the matter was first taken up
by the League, a measure was passed
making for the progressive suppres
sion of production and limiting the use
of opium to medicinal purposes. This
measure was passed by the Assembly
with but a single change, the word
"medicinal" being changed to "legiti
mate." This was unfortunate, for "le
gitimate" is open to elastic interpreta
tion, while "medicinal" is definite. As
an example we might take the condi
tions in India. There the natives eat
opium and consider it part of their
diet. Under the loose interpretation
of "legitimate," opium could be used
in India to the same extent as at
present.
The United States entered into the
work in May, 1923. At this time two
proposals were made, namely, that the
use of opium be limited to medicinal
and scientific purposes only, and that
production be curtailed. By this time
the committee had realized that "le
gitimate" was too wide a term, and

>that consumption could never be regu
lated without regulating production.
These proposals were accepte with
two exceptions, (1) that suppression
be gradual, and (2) that the use of
raw opium in India was not illegiti
mate. The wording thus did not say
it was legitimate, but it was claimed
that raw opium in the hot Indian cli
mate does not have the devastating
effect of the prepared opium.
Professor Payson J. Treat of Ihe His
tory department made the following state
ment regarding the opium question:
"In 1909 the first international con
ference for the study of the opium
evil assembled at Shanghai. The
United States took the lead in bring
ing about this first step toward meet
ing a growing menace to human wel
fare. Other conferences were held at
The Hague, but the World War check
ed the progress of this international
co-operation. Now the League of Na
tions is trying to find the best way to
prevent the illegitimate use of opium
and other harmful drugs. If it suc
ceeds the achievement alone would
justify its existence.
Difficult Problem
"But the problem is a most difficult
one. Opium is produced principally in
India, China, Turkey, and Persia. In
China the production is carried on
under official protection but in viola
tion of* national law. In Turkey and
Persia governmental regulation of pro
duction and consumption can not be
effectively enforced. Only in India can
effective steps be taken at present.
"The League of Nations can, how
ever, investigate the evil and draw up
a plan for checking it, and it can
gather information as to the way in
which the nations keep such obliga
tions as they may assume in the mat
ter. In this way the League can ren
der far more effective services than
occasional international conferences."
Tomorrow: "Austria."
