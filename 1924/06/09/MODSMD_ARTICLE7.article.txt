# SEAT SALE FOR "BOOMERANG" OPENS TOMORROW AFTERNOON
## Hal Bumbaugh and Carol Botsford Give Excellent Portrayals of Leads In Senior Farce 
### Ross Urquhart 
rpiCKETS for "The Boomerang," which will be presented Wednesday night,
June 18, will go on sale tomorrow afternoon in the Administration building
and at Crandall's at 1 o'clock. Both $1 and $1.25 will purchase tickets.
Although rehearsals for "The Boomerang" are still in the formative stage,
enough has been seen of the show and the actors to foresact that the dramatic

season will end with a Senior Farce success to its credit.
A noteworthy chai'acteristic of the rehearsals is the splendid way in which
the new talent has thrown itself into the spirit and humor of the play.
A. D. Cohan, the director, is more than satisfied. The work of the four
principals is especially'good. Hal Bumbaugh, as Dr. Gerald Sumner, should
prove the hit of the show. He plays the pa"rt of a doctor, trying to cure another
young man of lovesickness, only to find that it has "Boomeranged" back to
him. With Bumbaugh's clever wit and former dramatic experience, his part

$ should be carried off with the ease and
[ subtle humor of a finished actor.
Feminine Lead Well Chosen
Opposite Bumbaugh is Carol Bots
! lord, a newcomer to the campus stage.
| Natural ability combined with a na-
Itural charm make a splendid combina
tion, and it is this combination that
is going to hold sway the minute Miss
| Botsford comes on the stage. She has
that irresistible charm —that some
thing that is going to keep the audi
ence by her side during the whole per
formance.
The lover to be cured, Bud Wood
bridge, otherwise "Bill" Hammond, is
the instigator of a lot of the quiet
humor that flies back and forth across
I the stage as the rivals verbally jockey
j for position.
There always has to be a "dark
j horse" in everything and in "The
Boomerang" this is Harriet Ford, play
ing the part of Grace Tyler, Bud's long
sought love. "Dark horses" frequently
run up past the leaders and take the
i tape for a first place, so Miss Ford
j will have to be watched as one of the
future "hits."


Dr. Gerald Sumner (Hal Bumbaugh) works a new theory on his patient,
"Bud" Woodbridge (Bill Hammond). An interesting climax in the
Senior Farce to be given Wedne«day night, June 18.
