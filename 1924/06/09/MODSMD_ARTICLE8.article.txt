## 
### Esther Greenacre 
Presaging well for the future of big
musical productions at Stanford, the
presentation of the oratorio, "Elijah,"
in the stadium yesterday afternoon
was a marked achievement. The suc
cess of yesterday's attempt will doubt
less encourage the University to spon
sor similar undertakings in the future.
The credit for the successful union
of seven choruses with a sixty-one
piece orchestra and four professional
singers into a perfectly harmonious
and responsive whole, is due largely
to Warren D. Allen, director of the
oratorio. The performance was smooth
and was interpreted clearly and sym
pathetically in its entirety.
Of the soloists, Louis Graveure stood
out pre-eminently. The baritone's
enunciation was perfect, enabling his
words to be heard distinctly from all 1
parts of the stadium. His interpreta
tion of the role of "Elijah" was dra
matic without intruding upon the
bounds of the operatic performance.
Equally responsible with Graveure
for the effectiveness of the oratorio,
was the chorus of 500 people. Sensi-,
tive to every change of emotion in
the story, the chorus spoke as one
huge voice. The sense of conflict that
pulsated through the plot was vividly
reflected by the body of singers. Rapid
changes from denunciation to suppli
cation were accomplished with appar
ent ease, excellent diction being pre
served throughout.
In the passionate cry, "Oh Hear Us,
Baal," the chorus reached the pitch
of dramatic intensity.
Solo Parts Effective
Harold Procter, tenor, possessed the
true oratorio form. Constance Balfour,
soprano, surpassed the contralto,
Blanche Hamilton Fox, in clearness of
tones and in portrayal of character.
The roles of the Youth and Angel were
well-handled by Mrs. Lester Coger and
Winifred Estabrook.
The A Cappella Choir and chorus
from the College of the Pacific as a
body of trained singers formed an
invaluable nucleus for the chorus.
About 5000 people witnessed the per
formance.
