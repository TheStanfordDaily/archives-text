# ROBLE, ENCINA GYM TIE FOR SUPERSTITION HONORS
## 
### Robert Littler 
Some wise one once said, "Supersti
tion is the child of ignorance." And
that would naturally lead to the con
clusion that men and women in the
throes of higher education should be
entirely immune from anything like
that.
It seems that there are supersti
tions on the Stanford Farm and that
there is a strong rivalry between
Roble and the men's gym as to which
is headquarters for the most. A candid
opinion would be that in volume of
mystic rules Roble leads, but the two
are tied in degree of sincerity.
Roble Bridge Superstition
The most important rule spoken of
by the women was that if a girl meets
a man coining across Roble bridge,
they will marry. All this is mitigated,
however, if either is backing up at
the time of meeting. It was worth
noting that all of the girls approached
were perfectly familiar with this su
perstition, while none of the men had
heard of it.
The most complicated of the Roble

>rules regards placing of pie at the
table. Allowing for a clumsy mascu
line interpretation of a delicate femi
nine superstion, the idea seems to be
that the points of the compass are
divided so that the upper left hand,
as you sit at the table, means "this
year," and as you go on around you
have the meanings: "next year,"
"now," and "never." Thus, if a piece
of pie is placed pointing toward the
upper right hand corner, the female
recipient will be married "next year,"
and so forth.
Superstitions Improving
Though college women are prey to
superstition, a higher education is of
some value. For years the taking of
the last piece of bread from a plate!
condemned the taker to be an old maid, i
Yet, with true collegiate-feminirie in-J
genuity Roble skill has amended this ■
so that now to take the last piece of:
bread means a handsome husband.
One thing is strictly followed: never
sit at a table where there are thirteen.
Furthermore, if a knife drops on the
