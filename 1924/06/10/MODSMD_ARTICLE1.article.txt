### 
Old Spain will live again in the
Union Court on Thursday evening,
June 19, the date of the annual Senior
Promenade, when graduates will stroll
in the moonlight, to the strains of
languid Castilian airs, wearing bright
shawls and picturesque sombreros to
give added reality to the scene.
It has been the custom in the past
few years to have the Promenade fol
low the Senior Ball, but those in
charge of this season's festivities have
decided that the Prom would make a
better introduction to the Ball, the
great event of the week.
Friends and Relatives Welcome
All friends and relatives of the
graduates are cordially invited to at
tend the Prom, as well as students of
the University who are not graduat
ing. The evening's entertainment will
be absolutely free.
The Prom will be preceded by the
Senior Men's and Senior Women's din
ners, to be held in the New Union at
7 o'clock. They will be separate af
fairs, but after the meal the doors
between the two rooms will be thrown
open for the after-dinner speeches.
Charles Field, '95, will be toastmaster
and will call upon such speakers as
Newton Cleaveland, president of the
Alumni '(Association, President Wil
bur. '96, and "Scotcliy" Campbell, per
manent 1924 member of the Alumni
Advisory Board.
Spanish Influence Dominant
The Prom will commence at 8:30,
when the seniors circle the Union
Court, in the fashion of the old Span

Spanish, with such campus celebrities

between dances.

Court and unique lighting effects have

the place into a real Spanish court
yard. The keynote of the entire affair
will be friendly informality and all
who care to attend will be welcomed.
