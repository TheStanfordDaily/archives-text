Elmer Collett, Stanford's representa
tive on the 1924 Olympic Games water
polo team, has been asked to report
Sunday afternoon in order to be pre
pared to leave for Europe at any time,
by the Olympic Games committee.
It was thought for quite a while that
the Olympic Games water polo team
would not be sent across owing to
luck of funds, but evidently this has
been fixed up since that date.
O'Connor, who was also chosen for
the water polo team, will not com
pete, because of his entry in the swim
ming events.
The notice which appeared a few
days ago in a San Francisco paper
stating that there would be no water
polo team came as a shock to Collett
who had been expecting to leave for
; Europe at any moment. The determin
ing body had not taken the trouble to
I verify the new story with the result
that Collett was not certain as to its
authenticity.
