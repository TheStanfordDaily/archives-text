Pacific Coast Debate Conference in

Coast, except California. Last year
California withdrew because of a per
sonal squabble. It is probable that
they will be included on the list again
this fall.
The speaking contest is being de
veloped into one of the prominent
forensic activities of the Coast and
should bring the best extemporaneous
orators of the Far West to Palo Alto
next year.
J. (J. Emerson, Stanford faculty de

the conference last year and will pre
side over the gatherings this coining
meeting.
With two important activities al
ready lined up for the fall quarter it
will be necessary to readjust the other
