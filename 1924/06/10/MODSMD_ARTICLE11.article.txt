# DEB A TING PROGRAM TO BE ENLARGED FOR NEXT YEAR
## 
### Robert Littler 
The introduction of a debate with
Oxford, the entertaining of the Coast
Extemporaneous Contest, and a re
adjustment of the dates of the regu
lar Stanford debates are some of the
contemplated changes in the forensic
program for next year.
The Oxford contest will probably
take place either late in October or
early in November. Oxford has long
been regarded as the debating institu
tion par excellence of the world, and
a Stanford-Oxford debate should be
the forensic classic of the West.
Conference Debate at Stanford
Stanford is to be the host for the
Pacific Coast Debate Conference in
the fall, at which meeting the Coast
extemporaneous speaking contest will
be held. This clash took place this
I year for the first time at the Univer

sity of Oregon. It includes all the im
portant educational institutions on the
Coast, except California. Last year
California withdrew because of a per
sonal squabble. It is probable that
they will be included on the list again
this fall.
The speaking contest is being de
veloped into one of the prominent
forensic activities of the Coast and
should bring the best extemporaneous
orators of the Far West to Palo Alto
next year.
J. (J. Emerson, Stanford faculty de
hate advisor, was elected president of
the conference last year and will pre
side over the gatherings this coining

J. (J. Emerson, Stanford faculty de
hate advisor, was elected president of
the conference last year and will pre
side over the gatherings this coining
meeting.
With two important activities al
ready lined up for the fall quarter it
will be necessary to readjust the other
portions of the schedule. The plan is
under consideration to hold the Joftre
contest in the winter and the Tri
debate in the spring and cancel the
Tri-state meet with Oregon and Wash
ington.
One suggestion under careful con
sideration is that one of the important
Stanford debates be held in San Fran
cisco. This plan has been tried in the
pust in the case of California-Stanford
debates and has always met with suc
cess. The Joftre contest will be held
here next year and will not be changed
because of the large crowds. No doubt
the Oxford contest will be kept for
the same reason. But the triangular
debate at Palo Alto, which is between
Stanford and Southern California this
year, may be presented in the Munici
pal Auditorium instead of on the
campus.
The greatest effort will be concen
trated on the Oxford clash, according
to the present plans of Coach Emer
son. Oxford is bringing a team of
graduates and this opens up a larger
field for choice at Stanford.
Probably one of the foremost among
the probable candidates will be Bob
Lewis. Lewis has represented Stan
ford in a number of contests and each
time has presented the almost impos
sible side. In every case except one
he has been pronounced victorious
with a unanimous decision. He has
overcome the handicap of a poor voice \
and has established himself on plat- i
form personality and argumentative;
instinct.
Stanley Weigel should be most valu
able against Oxford since the clash
will probably be decided by the audi
ence. Weigel's improvement between
the Triangular meet last fall and the
Joftre was phenomenal and he should
be infinitely valuable against the Ox- j
ford team.
For platform presentation and good
voice work thpre is hardly any one at
Stanford to match Tom Bailey. Bailey
has a well developed, clear and power
ful voice, but he is moderately weak i
on extempore. As a first speaker
against Oxford he should be invulner
able.

Oxford, the entertaining of the Coast
Extemporaneous Contest, and a re
adjustment of the dates of the regu
lar Stanford debates are some of the
contemplated changes in the forensic
program for next year.
The Oxford contest will probably
take place either late in October or
early in November. Oxford has long
been regarded as the debating institu
tion par excellence of the world, and
a Stanford-Oxford debate should be
the forensic classic of the West.
Conference Debate at Stanford
Stanford is to be the host for the
Pacific Coast Debate Conference in
the fall, at which meeting the Coast
extemporaneous speaking contest will
be held. This clash took place this
I year for the first time at the Univer

sity of Oregon. It includes all the im
portant educational institutions on the
Coast, except California. Last year
California withdrew because of a per
sonal squabble. It is probable that
they will be included on the list again
this fall.
The speaking contest is being de
veloped into one of the prominent
forensic activities of the Coast and
should bring the best extemporaneous
orators of the Far West to Palo Alto
next year.
J. (J. Emerson, Stanford faculty de
hate advisor, was elected president of
the conference last year and will pre
side over the gatherings this coining
meeting.
With two important activities al
ready lined up for the fall quarter it
will be necessary to readjust the other
portions of the schedule. The plan is
under consideration to hold the Joftre
contest in the winter and the Tri
debate in the spring and cancel the
Tri-state meet with Oregon and Wash
ington.
One suggestion under careful con
sideration is that one of the important
Stanford debates be held in San Fran
cisco. This plan has been tried in the
pust in the case of California-Stanford
debates and has always met with suc
cess. The Joftre contest will be held
here next year and will not be changed
because of the large crowds. No doubt
the Oxford contest will be kept for
the same reason. But the triangular
debate at Palo Alto, which is between
Stanford and Southern California this
year, may be presented in the Munici
pal Auditorium instead of on the
campus.
The greatest effort will be concen
trated on the Oxford clash, according
to the present plans of Coach Emer
son. Oxford is bringing a team of
graduates and this opens up a larger
field for choice at Stanford.
Probably one of the foremost among
the probable candidates will be Bob
Lewis. Lewis has represented Stan
ford in a number of contests and each
time has presented the almost impos
sible side. In every case except one
he has been pronounced victorious
with a unanimous decision. He has
overcome the handicap of a poor voice \
and has established himself on plat- i
form personality and argumentative;
instinct.
Stanley Weigel should be most valu
able against Oxford since the clash
will probably be decided by the audi
ence. Weigel's improvement between
the Triangular meet last fall and the
Joftre was phenomenal and he should
be infinitely valuable against the Ox- j
ford team.
For platform presentation and good
voice work thpre is hardly any one at
Stanford to match Tom Bailey. Bailey
has a well developed, clear and power
ful voice, but he is moderately weak i
on extempore. As a first speaker
against Oxford he should be invulner
able.
