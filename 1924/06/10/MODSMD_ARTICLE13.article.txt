# "BOOMERANG" MOST APPEALING COMEDY ACCORDING TO CRITIC
## 
### 
"The most appealing comedy of the
season" is the way a New York critic
moderately described "The Boomer
ang" when it was first produced in
America. In his article in "Current
Opinion" the critic goes on to call this
play, which the seniors are staging
next week, "a delicious bit of non
senseâ€”the lightest comedy ever
mounted by that master of the thea
tre, Belasco."
Those delighting in psycho-analysis
and Freudian principles of psychology
will find their interests keenly por
trayed in this drama for, according to
the criticism, these two elements are
called on more in "The Boomerang"
than in any other play.
Smith, an American Moliere
Winchell Smith, the co-author of the
farce, is called the American Moliere
because of the clever manner in which
he vivifies his piece with catching
comedy. "Every element of fragile
satire becomes strikingly effective in
the wake of his pen. As for the play
itself, the comic effect of high medical
treatment to a small case of puppy
love is a scream."
The play enjoyed a long run in New
York and then met with favorable
success on the road in all parts of
the country. With perhaps one or two
exceptions this is the first time "The
Boomerang" has been produced on the
Pacific Coast.
