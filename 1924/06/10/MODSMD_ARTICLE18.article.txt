Tomorrow afternoon, when Bradley Riter eases the last lead into the
forms and looks over the last page proof. Volume 65 of the Daily Palo Alto
will "go to bed" for the last time. Soon it will he nothing but history
when it is bound and placed in the files with sixty-four other volumes.
\\ hether or not Volume 65 of the Daily Palo Alto has been successful
depends entirely upon the answer to one question. Has the Daily, in the
last four and a half months, served the best interests of the students of the
University? If it has, it may be said to have attained, in some small meas- i
tire at least, success. If it has not, it will immediately pass into oblivion j
where it rightfully belongs.
The Daily has sought to promote a greater interest in student affairs, j
Student body elections have been emphasized and it lias been the policy to j
strive for greater support for all the various activities—athletics, jour
nalism, dramatics, debating. While the student's first interest should be
centered in his studies, outside activities have a very important place in
our life here on the Farm. It has been the attempt of the present regime
to publish accurate and unbiased news. Constructive criticism has been
welcomed at all times.
The Daily itself, has sought to suggest only constructive criticism. It
has been accused of a "Pollyanna" attitude. Intended as a slur, this accu
sation was accepted as a compliment. The Daily believes in suggesting
opportunities for improvement when mistakes are made, rather than in
"panning" the poor unfortunate human who was so unfortunate as to err. |
The Daily Palo Alto is owned and published by the students of Stan- j
ford University and can only progress through co-operation of the entire
student body. That co-operation has been forthcoming during the past I
four and a half months and the Daily has benefited greatly by it.
The outgoing editor, in this connection wishes to pay a tribute to the j
most loyal staff of which the Daily has ever boasted. Every man and
woman from the Managing Editor to the reporter on the bottom of the
staff has had a part in the work. Especially noteworthy has been the work
of Bill Wright as Managing Editor, Bradley Riter as Associate Editor,
and Mildred Dannenbaum as Woman's Editor. These three have been
the backbone of the paper and their work has been worthy of a great deal
of praise.
In this connection, the Daily wishes to acknowledge the excellent work
of Cecil Haley, Business Manager, and his assistants. Haley has proved
to be one of the best business men who ever occupied the position of Busi
ness Manager. He has been thoroughly reliable at all times and it has
been a pleasure to work with him.
In Wright, the editor-elect, the Daily has a man who will conduct the j
paper along sane and desirable lines. As the editorial director of the |
paper, he will be an outstanding figure on the campus next year. The re-!
spect and affection which the staff holds for him bears testimony to the !
fact that he may expect and will receive their hearty co-operation and |
support.

last four and a half months, served the best interests of the students of the
University? If it has, it may be said to have attained, in some small meas- i
tire at least, success. If it has not, it will immediately pass into oblivion j
where it rightfully belongs.
The Daily has sought to promote a greater interest in student affairs, j
Student body elections have been emphasized and it lias been the policy to j
strive for greater support for all the various activities—athletics, jour
nalism, dramatics, debating. While the student's first interest should be
centered in his studies, outside activities have a very important place in
our life here on the Farm. It has been the attempt of the present regime
to publish accurate and unbiased news. Constructive criticism has been
welcomed at all times.
The Daily itself, has sought to suggest only constructive criticism. It
has been accused of a "Pollyanna" attitude. Intended as a slur, this accu
sation was accepted as a compliment. The Daily believes in suggesting
opportunities for improvement when mistakes are made, rather than in
"panning" the poor unfortunate human who was so unfortunate as to err. |
The Daily Palo Alto is owned and published by the students of Stan- j
ford University and can only progress through co-operation of the entire
student body. That co-operation has been forthcoming during the past I
four and a half months and the Daily has benefited greatly by it.
The outgoing editor, in this connection wishes to pay a tribute to the j
most loyal staff of which the Daily has ever boasted. Every man and
woman from the Managing Editor to the reporter on the bottom of the
staff has had a part in the work. Especially noteworthy has been the work
of Bill Wright as Managing Editor, Bradley Riter as Associate Editor,
and Mildred Dannenbaum as Woman's Editor. These three have been
the backbone of the paper and their work has been worthy of a great deal
of praise.
In this connection, the Daily wishes to acknowledge the excellent work
of Cecil Haley, Business Manager, and his assistants. Haley has proved
to be one of the best business men who ever occupied the position of Busi
ness Manager. He has been thoroughly reliable at all times and it has
been a pleasure to work with him.
In Wright, the editor-elect, the Daily has a man who will conduct the j
paper along sane and desirable lines. As the editorial director of the |
paper, he will be an outstanding figure on the campus next year. The re-!
spect and affection which the staff holds for him bears testimony to the !
fact that he may expect and will receive their hearty co-operation and |
support.
Tomorrow afternoon, when Bradley Riter eases the last lead into the
forms and looks over the last page proof. Volume 65 of the Daily Palo Alto
will "go to bed" for the last time. Soon it will he nothing but history
when it is bound and placed in the files with sixty-four other volumes.
\\ hether or not Volume 65 of the Daily Palo Alto has been successful
depends entirely upon the answer to one question. Has the Daily, in the
last four and a half months, served the best interests of the students of the
University? If it has, it may be said to have attained, in some small meas- i
tire at least, success. If it has not, it will immediately pass into oblivion j
