# PALM DRIVE OVALS TO BE PLANTED IN PLOTS OF SHRUBS
## 
### 
Due to the excessive amount of
water required to keep them in good
condition, the two large oval lawns
between the Administration building
and Palm Drive are to be ploughed up
immediately and planted to shrubs,
according to A. E. Roth, comptroller.
A broad strip of grass In the center
of each of the ovals will be left, and
on either side will be solid groups of
low-cut shrubs of uniform color. Next
to the main beds will be smaller plots
with a variety of shrubs with some
color.
It is believed that the new arrange
ment will require less water than is
the case at present and will look
better. Frederick L. Olmstead, the
landscape gardener who was In charge
of the University grounds in 1891,
was not in favor of planting grass in
the ovals because of the difficulty and
expense of keeping it in good shape
in the dry California climate.
Olmstead said in his original report:
"These areas (ovals) would be fields
of turf were it not that satisfactory
turf in California can be maintained
only by profuse irrigation. It is con
sidered that the University should not
have the difficulty and expense im
posed upon it of the constant rolling,
mowing, sweeping and watering of
such large one as would thus be
necessary."
