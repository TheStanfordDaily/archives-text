# No. 10. AUSTRIA
## 
### 
Owing to the fact that the League<
artixle was not included in the Fresh
man edition last Friday, the tenth of the
series, on "Corfu," has been omitted.
Austria, at the end of the war, found
herself worse off than any European
state. The treaty of Versailles stipu
lated that she was not to join with
Germany, which of course would have
been very likely, considering the com
mon interests of the two countries.
The Austrian affair first came before
the League in March, 1921, when the
major Allies agreed to release Austria
from all liens which they held against
her. This move was made so that she
would be given the opportunity to im
prove her financial condition. A whole }
scheme of internal reforms, raising of
liens and credits, was worked out by
the Financial Committee of the (
League, to take effect under the
auspices of the League.
Instability
At that time Austria was not in such :
a state of political instability as to !
warrant the belief that there would be
any difficulty in securing the neces- ;
sary credits, once the liens were j
raised, the financial and administra
tive reforms carried out, and the
League financial control accepted.
The Council of the League then pro- 1
ceeded, during the next few months,
to try to obtain the raising of the liens.
Th' % proved successful in the case of
fifteen out of Austria's seventeen
creditors —the United States causing
considerable delay. In the meantime
Austria's condition became so grave
by February, 1922, as to cause fears
of imminent collapse—that is, failure
of the currency to buy anything, con
sequent starvation, social upheavals,
etc.
Supreme Council
Great Britain, France, Italy, and j
Czecho-Slovakia came to her rescue j
temporarily, by loaning her money. |
But by August, 1922, the situation had !
become so desperate that Austria
made a last appeal to the Supreme
Council, a body acting under the Ver
sailles treaty and having nothing in
common with the League. The Su
preme Council did not think it could
do anything in this matter, and re
ferred it back to the League with the j
statement that no credits would be
forthcoming unless as part of a gen
eral scheme to make certain that
Austria would permanently recover.
A committee of the Council, assisted
by representatives of Austria and
Czecho-Slovakia, with the aid of the
Financial, Economic, and Legal Sec
tions of the League, worked out a
scheme whereby (1) the political in
tegrity of Austria was established, (2)
the open door policy was upheld, and [
(3) a series of loans were guaranteed j

>as needed. This last clause provided
for a loan of $150,000,000, 83 per cent
of which was guaranteed by Great
Britain, France, Italy, and Czecho-Slo
vakia. Other nations of the world
were to guarantee the remainder.
Commissioner-General
A Commissioner-General was ap
pointed, whose duties were to nego
tiate loans and to see that the many
needed reforms were executed. H ! s
job was to get rid of 100,000 excess
office holders in the first year. Al
though he did not quite accomplish
this reform, he managed to reduce the
force by 56,000. This was done with
very little hardship, as pay went on
from six to eighteen months after dis
missal. Some of the older office hold
ers were pensioned.
A foreign loan was floated, $25,000,-
000 of which was the quota for ihe
United States. The United States
quota was sold out in fifteen minutes,
which shows that the financiers con
sidered it a good investment.
Great difficulty was encountered in
reducing the army and the police
force, because of the jealousy between
the two factions. Each had to be re'
duced in exactly the same proportion.
In the past 50 per cent of the passen
gers on the railroads traveled free
or at reduced rates; this number has
been reduced to 2 per cent.
Professor M. S. IVildman of the
Economics department makes the fol
lowing statements regarding the work
of the League in rehabilitating Austria:
The receivership as a tonic for de
crepit business has proven a great
boon. Many a concern which was about
to pass out under a burden of buti
luck and debts has been given a new
life, new credit, and ultimate profit.
It is a new thing to apply the same
I treatment to a moribund government
but the experiment with Austria as
patient in the international clinic
holds out a prospect of recovery and
even now the stage of convalcscence
has been reached.
Perhaps the reason such treatment
has not been tried before was the lack
of a proper court to which the re
ceiver would be responsible. A recei
vership cannot he self-constituted nor
j act without a superior authority. This
sanction is now to be found in the
League of Nations.
