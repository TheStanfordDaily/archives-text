## 
### 
"A Short History and Description of
Stanford University" is the title of a
booklet to be published within several
weeks by the Stanford Journalists
Club.
The size of the booklet will be 7H X
10Vfc and there will be 48 pages of
reading matter illustrated by pictures
of the University. Engravings have
been secured from the 1924 and 1925
Quads, the Illustrated Review, and
also etchings from the endowment
publications. One of the four-color
plates from this year's Quad will prob
ably be used.
Last year Dr. Wilbur called atten
tion to the University's need of some
sort of an authoritative magazine Â»of
information. The administration fre
quently wishes to send out an ade
quate description and historical sum
mary of Stanford, and the Bookstore
has a steady demand from visitors for
such a publication.
The booklet is being edited by Rob
ert Edwards, president of the Stanford
Journalists Club. Assigned articles
have been written by Professor Eve
rett Smith, William E. Leiser, Dauiel
Boone, Carl Shoup, Norris James,
Northcutt Ely, Philip Newill, Archie
Steele, Miriam Hilton, Howard Bissell,
Ray Spangler, Esther Greenacre, Al
lene Thorpe, and Kenneth Hess.
Three main divisions have been ob
served in the magazine. The first deals
with the historical foundation and de
velopment of the University. The sec
ond division contains description of
the buildings and Quads; also, inci
dental points of interest are pointed
out. Housing facilities and plans, the
Union, libraries, museum, art gallery,
and Memorial Church are described
in this section. The third division con
cerns student life, activities, athletics,
customs, government, and self-support.
