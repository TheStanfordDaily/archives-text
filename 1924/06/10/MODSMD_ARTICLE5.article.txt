# SPECTATOR'S LAST ISSUE OF YEAR TO APPEAR FRIDAY, 13
## 
### 
Disregarding any prevailing super
stitions concerning Friday the 13th,
Spectator's last edition of the year will
appear on that date. The chief fea
tures of the issue are articles by Rich
ard Sampson and Anna Fitzhugli.
The former story, entitled "An In
dictment," is a frank discussion of the
treatment received by a prominent
Stanford athlete from the University
officials and the students themselves.
Miss Fitzhugh's article is entitled
"The Row Row," and treats with the
sorority questions. For the first time
since the agitation has started the
true and complete facts will be dis
closed. A prediction as to the outcome
of the matter is also given.
The literary gem of the publication
is a story by Carl Wilhelmson, enti
tled "Sir Galahad of Pisagua." It is
an adventure tale of a Chilean port.
Other features are "Atta Girl!" by
Norris James, which discusses the
woman's place in athletics, and a dis
cussion of the debating situation by
Professor J. G. Emerson.
