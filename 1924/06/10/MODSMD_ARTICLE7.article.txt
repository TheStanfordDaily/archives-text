# THREE CARDINAL RUNNERS RETURN FROM CAMBRIDGE
## Hartranft Has Best Records In Shot, Discus; Should Win in Finals 
### Wallace Knox 
Unfavorable weather at Boston on
the day of the I. C. A. A. A. finals
was largely responsible for the down
fall of the Stanford track team, ac
cording to the members of the track
squad who have returned to the cam
pus.
Bill Swayne arrived at Stanford on
Friday and Dick Mcßae and Fred
Ludeke followed soon after. Nelson
Van Judah is expected back sometime
during the week. The remainder of
the team is training at Williams Col
lege for the Olympic Games tryouts
which will be held at Boston on next
Friday and Saturday.
The eastern climate was consider
ably colder than that to which the
Redshirts had been accustomed, and
the cold, coupled with a strong wind,
proved too much for the distance run
ners, who tied up before the end of
the race. A poor start prevented Hale
from qualifying in his heat of the hun
dred.
Hartranft Should Place
"Tiny" Hartranft should not have
much trouble in taking first in both
the shot and the discus Saturday. As
yet no one has come near his best
marks in the sectional tryouts. Pat
McDonald of the New York Athletic
Club, supposed to be a dangerous
contender, was only able to toss the
shot 45 feet T% inches, at the tryouts.
It is probable that most of his compe
tition will come from the college ath
letes rather than from club men.
Le Roy Brown was the sensation of
the eastern tryouts when he cleared
the bar in the high jump at 6 feet
6% inches. This set a new Olympic
mark, bettering that of 6 feet 4 3-8
inches formerly held by Dick Landon
of Yale. Fred Anderson will have to
do some good jumping to qualify in
this event, with such a strong field of
competitors.
Cochran, O. C., Strong Contender
Commodore "Racehorse" Cochran
of the Olympic Club, is one of the
best of the 400-meter runners who
will participate at Boston. He should
take' first place with ease, and it is
not impossible that Ted Miller will
cop second, should he be able to ac
climate himself to eastern weather by
that time.
Larry Brown of Philadelphia seems
to be making a dangerous bid for first
in the 800 meters, as he won the event
in 1:53 5-10, setting a new American
record. Bill Richardson and Dick Mc
intosh were within a few feet of the
winners in the BSO-yard run at Cam
bridge and as yet they are not out of
the running for places on the Ameri
can Olympic team.
Spearow, of Oregon, who won the
pole vault in the Pacific Coast Confer
ence meet, looms as the probable win
ner of this in the tryouts. He clears
13 feet 2 inches with ease, and has
almost succeeded in attaining 13 feet
6% inches, a new world's record. Dean
Brownell, of Illinois, holder of the
world's indoor record in this event,

was defeated in the Big Ten confer
ence meet when he barely managed to
clear 12 feet 6 inches. Brownell hurt
his ankle before the California meet
and has been unable to vault in his
old form since that time.
The two outstanding men of the
middle western team are Charlie
Brookins of lowa, in the low hurdles,
and De Hart Hubbard, of Michigan,
in the broad jump. Brookins holds
the world's record for the low hur
dles, having run the distance in :23
flat, while Hubbard can broad jump
24 feet 10 V 6 inches. Both of these men
should win their events at the tryouts.
Qpmins of Yale, who broke the I. C.
A. A. A. A. record with a leap of 24
feet 8 inches, will have trouble in
beating the Michigan negro jumper.

ably colder than that to which the
Redshirts had been accustomed, and
the cold, coupled with a strong wind,
proved too much for the distance run
ners, who tied up before the end of
the race. A poor start prevented Hale
from qualifying in his heat of the hun
dred.
Hartranft Should Place
"Tiny" Hartranft should not have
much trouble in taking first in both
the shot and the discus Saturday. As
yet no one has come near his best
marks in the sectional tryouts. Pat
McDonald of the New York Athletic
Club, supposed to be a dangerous
contender, was only able to toss the
shot 45 feet T% inches, at the tryouts.
It is probable that most of his compe
tition will come from the college ath
letes rather than from club men.
Le Roy Brown was the sensation of
the eastern tryouts when he cleared
the bar in the high jump at 6 feet
6% inches. This set a new Olympic
mark, bettering that of 6 feet 4 3-8
inches formerly held by Dick Landon
of Yale. Fred Anderson will have to
do some good jumping to qualify in
this event, with such a strong field of
competitors.
Cochran, O. C., Strong Contender
Commodore "Racehorse" Cochran
of the Olympic Club, is one of the
best of the 400-meter runners who
will participate at Boston. He should
take' first place with ease, and it is
not impossible that Ted Miller will
cop second, should he be able to ac
climate himself to eastern weather by
that time.
Larry Brown of Philadelphia seems
to be making a dangerous bid for first
in the 800 meters, as he won the event
in 1:53 5-10, setting a new American
record. Bill Richardson and Dick Mc
intosh were within a few feet of the
winners in the BSO-yard run at Cam
bridge and as yet they are not out of
the running for places on the Ameri
can Olympic team.
Spearow, of Oregon, who won the
pole vault in the Pacific Coast Confer
ence meet, looms as the probable win
ner of this in the tryouts. He clears
13 feet 2 inches with ease, and has
almost succeeded in attaining 13 feet
6% inches, a new world's record. Dean
Brownell, of Illinois, holder of the
world's indoor record in this event,
was defeated in the Big Ten confer
ence meet when he barely managed to
clear 12 feet 6 inches. Brownell hurt
his ankle before the California meet
and has been unable to vault in his
old form since that time.
The two outstanding men of the
middle western team are Charlie
Brookins of lowa, in the low hurdles,
and De Hart Hubbard, of Michigan,
in the broad jump. Brookins holds
the world's record for the low hur
dles, having run the distance in :23
flat, while Hubbard can broad jump
24 feet 10 V 6 inches. Both of these men
should win their events at the tryouts.
Qpmins of Yale, who broke the I. C.
A. A. A. A. record with a leap of 24
feet 8 inches, will have trouble in
beating the Michigan negro jumper.

the day of the I. C. A. A. A. finals

Bill Swayne arrived at Stanford on
Friday and Dick Mcßae and Fred

the team is training at Williams Col

which will be held at Boston on next
