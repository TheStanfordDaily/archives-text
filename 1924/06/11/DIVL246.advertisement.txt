ON A COLLEGE SHIP

Yale or Harvard —for a thrilling, pleasureful, peppy ocean voyage to

dancing and other fun!

Fishing
Requires something more subtle than old
clothes to make your trip a success. For
there's always the fish to compete against.
A knieker suit of rough .mannish tweed,
an English broadcloth shirt, and a soft
felt hat will be the cause for the streams
remaining well stocked this season.
