Here's a word of thanks, fellows and "500," for the
business you have given the Walk-Over Boot Shop. While
I have been in Palo Alto, I have aimed to procure only
those better and smarter types of footwear I believed you
wanted. I hope to serve you even better next Fall, when
I will offer you the line of Richards and Brenware men's
shoes, including those very popular • campus models,
"Pegasus," "Craftsman," and "Buccaneer."
We have an English shoe, too, that will go big on the
Quad next Fall. See it now.
A right jolly vacation, gang.
