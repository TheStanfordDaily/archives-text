# 'BOOMERANG' SETS TO BE STRICTLY MODERN
## Doctor's Office Shown In Opening Act; Cast Includes Talent New To University Dramatics 
### Ross Urquhart 
AS the final curtain goes down on scholastic work for this year, another
curtain will be raised for the first event of Senior Week, "The Boomerang."
From the success of recent rtdiearsals and from the opinion of A. D. Cohan,
this play should carry the baton to a whirlwind finish in the 1924 dramatic
season.
Harvey Lytell and Chrysella Dunker, who have had charge of designing the
sets and costumes, have been running back and forth between here and
San Francisco, where the sets are being painted, to get every minute detail
straight. Nothing elaborate or fantastic may be expected as "The Boomerang"

'is strictly modern and the sets bear
this out to the last detail. The doctor's
office in the first act should prove
interesting with its medical apparatus
and smelling salts.
New Material in Cast
Hal Bumbaugh and Carol Botsford,
in the leading roles, supported by Bill
Hammond and Harriet Ford, should
prove food for new thought and criti
cism after the long reign of the Allen,
Burks, Nolan trio in dramatics this
year. Bumbaugh, especially, due to his
ready wit and former experience, is
expected to show up well. However,
one of the "dark horses" may come to
light the night of the show, as they
often do, and carry it to unexpected
heigths.
John Wiggin, as Emile, the French
valet and general utility man, is an
other in the predicted "hits." Wiggins'
performances to date tend to bear out
this assumption and, as the old saying
goes, "the play is yet a pup." So he
has plenty of time to develop into
an actor that will endanger even the
leads.
Lamson (s Villain
Dave Lamson is one of the old stand
bys of the campus stage and should
give a good interpretation of De Witt,
the bad man of the pltky. The rest of
the cast is working hard, Cohan is
tearing his hair —which is a good sign
—and everything points toward a suc
cess. Be at the finishing line and see
a :10 flat performance.
