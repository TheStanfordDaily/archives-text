# 'STANFORD DAYS' Will BE SHOWN AT 7:15 TONIGHT
## Margaret Richardson, Hal Bumbaugh, Lloyd Nolan, To Play Leads 
### Ted Achilles 
Stanford's progressive spirit will
show itself in a new form toniglit with
the first i*resentation of "Stanford
Days." The movie is entirely a Univer
sity production, only the actual pho
tography being handled by outsiders,
and it exemplifies the spirit of the
University.
It will be "standing room" only un
less students arrive early, for no seats
are reserved. The performance is
scheduled to begin at 7:15 at the
Assembly hall. Forty-five cents covers
all expenses.
Stanford is the first University in
the West to produce a motion picture
of actual campus life and activities
with the purpose of renewing tradi
tion. The success of the venture from
now on rests entirely with the student
body and the support which they give
to it.
Picture Is Accurate
The dominating note of the picture
is accuracy, and no pains have been
spared to make it as true to life as it
can possibly be made. The cast is
typical of the majority of the Univer
sity, and is composed of experienced
actors as .well. The three leading char
acters, Margaret Richardson, Harold
Bumbaugh, and Lloyd Nolan, are all
familiar to the campus through the
local stage and other typical activities.
The' picture covers every field of
campus activities and shows nearly
every interesting or picturesque part
of the University. Great care has been
taken to make it a thoroughly artistic
production, while making it absolutely
accurate. Not a trace of the usual
movie "hoakum" has been used, and
we will be able to see ourselves exact
ly as others see us.
Is Permanent Record
The true purpose and value of the
work is to make a permanent record
of the University at this time and its
worth will increase as the years go
by. It is hoped that the custom will be
established of taking such a film every
year from now on, making a complete
pictorial history of Stanford.
The College Cinema Guild, which
has been doing all the technical work,
is an organization founded to do just
such work and is not doing it for
profit. They expect to make expenses
by the two showings to be made in
the Assembly hall and a short run at
one of the Palo Alto theatres.
All rights to the film will then be
turned over to the Aljamni Association
and it will be used by them at alumni
reunions throughout the country and
to give next year's freshman class an
idea of the various phases of campus
life.

scheduled to begin at 7:15 at the
Assembly hall. Forty-five cents covers
all expenses.
Stanford is the first University in
the West to produce a motion picture
of actual campus life and activities
with the purpose of renewing tradi
tion. The success of the venture from
now on rests entirely with the student
body and the support which they give
to it.
Picture Is Accurate
The dominating note of the picture
is accuracy, and no pains have been
spared to make it as true to life as it
can possibly be made. The cast is
typical of the majority of the Univer
sity, and is composed of experienced
actors as .well. The three leading char
acters, Margaret Richardson, Harold
Bumbaugh, and Lloyd Nolan, are all
familiar to the campus through the
local stage and other typical activities.
The' picture covers every field of
campus activities and shows nearly
every interesting or picturesque part
of the University. Great care has been
taken to make it a thoroughly artistic
production, while making it absolutely
accurate. Not a trace of the usual
movie "hoakum" has been used, and
we will be able to see ourselves exact
ly as others see us.
Is Permanent Record
The true purpose and value of the
work is to make a permanent record
of the University at this time and its
worth will increase as the years go
by. It is hoped that the custom will be
established of taking such a film every
year from now on, making a complete
pictorial history of Stanford.
The College Cinema Guild, which
has been doing all the technical work,
is an organization founded to do just
such work and is not doing it for
profit. They expect to make expenses
by the two showings to be made in
the Assembly hall and a short run at
one of the Palo Alto theatres.
All rights to the film will then be
turned over to the Aljamni Association
and it will be used by them at alumni
reunions throughout the country and
to give next year's freshman class an
idea of the various phases of campus
life.
