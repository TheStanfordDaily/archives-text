# COLOR ETCHINGS BY PEDRO LEMOS ARE ON DISPLAY AT GALLERY
## 
### 
Color etchings, block prints, and
lithographs by Pedro J. Lemos are
now on display at the Stanford Art
Gallery.
The collection recently returned
from the East where it was placed on
exhibition circuit and shown in the
art centers of the East and South by
the American Federation of Art. Many
of the subjects were purchased by uni
versities and schools.
Examples of almost every known
artistic print method are included and
several groups show the progressive
steps in the making of prints.
One of the groups contains a set of
eight subjects in various types of
work, dry point, hard and soft-ground
etching, aquatint, lithograph, wood
block, and monotype.
