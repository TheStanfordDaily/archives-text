# A 						Crying Need
## 
### 
Stanford, having taken the lead among Pacific Coast universities in
many worthy projects, now has an opportunity to step to the front
again by establishing a school of physical education.
No university or college on the coast has such a school and the field
is a wide and important one. Eastern and middle-western institutions
have long recognized and filled this crying need. Among the universities
which have been most successful in carrying on such projects are
Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota.
A school of physical education at Stanford would be highly desirable
for several reasons. In the first place, it would prepare men and qualify
them for a most important work in high schools and smaller colleges.
In the second place, it would create a most suitable background for
athletics in the University. Another important item would be the placing
of Stanford men in coaching positions all over the coast. It would also
assure preparatory schools and small colleges of competent and well
trained coaches.
A fair estimate indicates that a school of physical education could be
established at Stanford with an outlay of about $15,000 a year, which
is a very reasonable figure in view of the benefits of such a project.
Stanford already has a most competent staff of physical education
directors, who, with the addition of one or two men, could handle the
instruction very nicely. The $15,000 estimate includes $5,000 payment
on new buildings which would be necessary.
At the present time, the state lays down certain requirements for
physical education teachers. Right now, Stanford can prepare men to
fulfill very few of these requirements, although the proposed school of
physical education would include in its requirements, some courses now
given regularly in the University.
Universities and colleges awoke to the importance of training the
mind as well as the body in the recent World War, when it was found
that half of the young men in America were physically unfit for military
service. It is time for Stanford to awake to the realization of the'
absolute necessity of turning out into the world capable physical educa
tion directors who can be true leaders.
