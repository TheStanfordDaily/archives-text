# PEDRO LEMOS LEAVES FOR TOUR OF EUROPE
## 
### 
Pedro J. Lemos, director of the
Museum and Art Gallery, recently left
for a three months' tour of Europe.
During the trip he will select a suit
able tapestry for Toyon hall.
Since he has made a particular
study of textiles in the last few years,
he hopes to obtain a piece of work
that will be particularly fitting to the
Stanford architecture.
He will head a group of artists and
art supervisors in a trip through the
art centers of the continent, and will
conduct a series of classes on the arts
and crafts work of the various coun
tries.
