Lewis Alabaster's Talents
Briefly, the least said about Lewis
Plimpton Alabaster's boyhood chum's
father-in-law, the better. That old man
was the terror of the countryside in
the nearabouts of Smitherville, Ne
braska, until his daughter married.
chum was courting this
old man's daughter. He had a great
deal of competition for the fair one's
hand, but the chief obstacle was the
old governor.
At 10:30 p.m., regularly, this senile
head of the house would get up from
bed and march downstairs, a cue for
any suitor to retreat from the vicinity.
It remained for Alabaster's friend to
solve the situation.
Lew's instructions were to sit up
just under the old man's window until
he heard the latter stirring at his ac
customed hour. Then he was to play
his reed mouthpiece vigorously until
he ran out of breath.
The ruse worked fine. Mabel's papa
got up, and was starting downstairs,
but heard what he thought was a cat
mewing outside. Greatly incensed, he
started throwing articles out of the
window in order to scare away the
animal, none of his weapons hitting
the desired target. And when Alabas
ter quit, the old man was so tired that
he forgot about going downstairs.
In time the scheme worked just the
other way. The pater got so he liked
the serenade and would sit at the win
dow-sill, enraptured at the tunes com
ing from the gloom outside. His down
stairs habit was permanently cured.
The wedding bells rang out and the
identity of the serenader was revealed.
Recognizing talent, the same old gen
tleman hired a group of instructors
all the way from an A1 Jolson to a
Galli-Curci to start Alabaster on the
road to fame.
The benign influence of this assem
blage has finally given this campus
one of its greatest saxaphone lung ex
pellers.
