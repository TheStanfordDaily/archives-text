# PROBLEM IN RUHR DISTRICT CANNOT BE SOLVED-SCOTT

### 
"For centuries France and Germany!
have been rivals for the Rhine pro- j
vinces. Is it humanly possible to end i
this historical rivalry, or must the 1
attacks continue until one or the other!
is destroyed?"
This was one of the problems sug
gested by H. G. Scott, journalist, who i
was in the Ruhr district last October, I
and who spoke last night on "The i
Breaking of Passive Resistance in the
Ruhr."
He asked further, "Is it possible to j
find an agency to induce nations to j
abandon the narrow ideas of national
rivalries?"
Scott questioned whether a "great!
nation like Germany could give up her
dreams of expansion," or go on with i
them without harming her neighbors.
He also mentioned the situation of |
the French, and their necessity of
using black troops to make up for;
their own deficiency in numbers.
Tracing the progress of the situation
on the Ruhr, Scott came to the con- j
elusion that there is no solution as yet'
for the problem.
Scott told of the struggle in the dis-1
trict after it had reached its crisis in ;
September, and the French broke
down German resistance.
However, he told of Cologne, where \
the Germans present the appearance ,
of carelessness as to their safety. In
Bonn, the atmosphere is one of stag
nance, and in Essen, it is sullen and
hostile. The great factor influencing
all this district, according to Scott, is J
the rapid fall of the German mark, j
