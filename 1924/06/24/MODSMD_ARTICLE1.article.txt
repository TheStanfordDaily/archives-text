# DR. W. F. DURAND IS GUEST OF HONOR AT BANQUET WEDNESDAY
## Head of Mechanical Engineering Department to Retire This Year 
### 
Dr. William Fredrick Durand, retir
ing head of the Mechanical Engineer
ing department, was tendered a fare
well banquet last Wednesday evening
in the Stanford Union. The affair was
sponsored by students in the engi
neering schools, and was attended by
over one hundred and fifty students,
graduates, and faculty members.
Congratulatory and reminiscent re
marks were made by David Starr Jor
dan, who secured Dr. Duraiul's ser
vices for Stanford in 1904, President
Ray Lyman Wilbur, Professor Guido
Marx, and J. E. Wight. Dean A. W.
Smith, of the Cornell School of Me
chanical Engineering, and Dr. Dur
and's predecessor at Stanford, was the
toastmaster.
Dr. Jordan told of the early days of
the University and of how he got Dr.
Durand to come to Stanford when it
was still a small place, struggling for
recognition. Dr. Jordan started that
it was men of Dr. Durand's caliber
who made it possible for Stanford to
rise to the position she holds today.
President Wilbur called the atten
tion of the students to the fact that
preeminent among Dr. Durand's many
wonderful characteristics was his ab
solute and never failing loyalty. "Or
ders from Washington always took
precedence with Dr. Durand, and he
always answered this country's calls
with all that was in him," said Dr.
Wilbur.
Professor Guido Marx voiced the re
spect and admiration which Dr. Dur
and's colleagues felt for him, and
pledged himself and his associates to
the work of carrying on the ideals
and standards which Dr. Durand had
set for him during the twenty years
he was head of the Mechanical Engi
neering department.
J. E. Wight, president of the student
body of the engineering school, in ex
pressing the love and esteem which
the students feel for Dr. Durand,
likened it to a definition of personal
ity. "We can't say it in mere words,
we only know that it is there, an in
tangible but a very real feeling, and
we are grateful for having had the
opportunity of knowing such a man,"
said Wight.
Dr. Durand, in responding to the
various speeches, said that his great
est regret in retiring from active class
work, was losing his personal contact
with the students. "This contact with
the men who are to carry on the work
we older ones must leave, has meant
more to me than anything else in my
life," said Dr. Durand.
Immediately after the banquet, Pro
fessor Eckhart of the Mechanical En
gineering department, presented an il
lustrated lecture, revealing the history
of Dr. Durand's life from infancy to
his graduation from the Naval Acad
emy at Annapolis.
With the freedom which will be his
now that he has retired from active

class room work, Dr. Durand expects
to devote more time to the solution of
ihe many problems upon which he has
been working for the United States
Government. Stanford will still be his
home, and he will conduct most of hi 3
experiments here, although much of
his time will be spent at Washington
on Government business. His recent
unanimous nomination for the presi
dency of the American Society of Me
chanical Engineers will mean that
during the next year he will also be
engaged upon administrative work for
that organization.

with the students. "This contact with
the men who are to carry on the work
we older ones must leave, has meant
more to me than anything else in my
life," said Dr. Durand.
Immediately after the banquet, Pro
fessor Eckhart of the Mechanical En
gineering department, presented an il
lustrated lecture, revealing the history
of Dr. Durand's life from infancy to
his graduation from the Naval Acad
emy at Annapolis.
With the freedom which will be his
now that he has retired from active

class room work, Dr. Durand expects
to devote more time to the solution of
ihe many problems upon which he has
been working for the United States
Government. Stanford will still be his
home, and he will conduct most of hi 3
experiments here, although much of
his time will be spent at Washington
on Government business. His recent
unanimous nomination for the presi
dency of the American Society of Me
chanical Engineers will mean that
during the next year he will also be
engaged upon administrative work for
that organization.
Dr. William Fredrick Durand, retir
ing head of the Mechanical Engineer
ing department, was tendered a fare
well banquet last Wednesday evening
in the Stanford Union. The affair was
sponsored by students in the engi
neering schools, and was attended by
over one hundred and fifty students,
graduates, and faculty members.
Congratulatory and reminiscent re
marks were made by David Starr Jor
dan, who secured Dr. Duraiul's ser
vices for Stanford in 1904, President
Ray Lyman Wilbur, Professor Guido
Marx, and J. E. Wight. Dean A. W.
Smith, of the Cornell School of Me
chanical Engineering, and Dr. Dur
and's predecessor at Stanford, was the
toastmaster.
Dr. Jordan told of the early days of
the University and of how he got Dr.
Durand to come to Stanford when it
was still a small place, struggling for
recognition. Dr. Jordan started that
it was men of Dr. Durand's caliber
who made it possible for Stanford to
rise to the position she holds today.
President Wilbur called the atten
tion of the students to the fact that
preeminent among Dr. Durand's many
wonderful characteristics was his ab
solute and never failing loyalty. "Or
ders from Washington always took
precedence with Dr. Durand, and he
always answered this country's calls
with all that was in him," said Dr.
Wilbur.
Professor Guido Marx voiced the re
spect and admiration which Dr. Dur
and's colleagues felt for him, and
pledged himself and his associates to
the work of carrying on the ideals
and standards which Dr. Durand had
set for him during the twenty years
he was head of the Mechanical Engi
neering department.
J. E. Wight, president of the student
body of the engineering school, in ex
pressing the love and esteem which
the students feel for Dr. Durand,
likened it to a definition of personal
ity. "We can't say it in mere words,
we only know that it is there, an in
tangible but a very real feeling, and
we are grateful for having had the
opportunity of knowing such a man,"
said Wight.
Dr. Durand, in responding to the
various speeches, said that his great
est regret in retiring from active class
work, was losing his personal contact
with the students. "This contact with
the men who are to carry on the work
we older ones must leave, has meant
more to me than anything else in my
life," said Dr. Durand.
