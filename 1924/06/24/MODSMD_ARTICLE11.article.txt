# Summer Quarter
## 
### 
Summer Quarter is altogether dif
ferent from any other part of the year
at Stanford. The enrollment is much
smaller and many of the regular stu
dents are absent. A large number of
special students and freshmen enter
ing for the first time will be on the
Farm this summer.
To these people, the Daily Palo Alto,
on behalf of the Associated Students,
extends a hearty welcome. May their
stay here be a pleasant one, and may
they learn to love and respect the
University as we who have been here
longer have learned to do.
