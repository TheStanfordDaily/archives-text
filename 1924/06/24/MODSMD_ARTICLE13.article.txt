# Farewell
## 
### 
To the Class of 1924, farewell. You
have been a very important part of
University life in the four years you
have spent at Stanford. May you meet
with the same success in the outside
world that you have attained here.
Petty jealousies fade and unimportant
grudges die as you leave. You are now
a part of the great body of Stanford
alumni.
