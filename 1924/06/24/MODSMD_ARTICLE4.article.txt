# WORTHWHILE THINGS SHOULD BE SOUGHT SAYS DR. ROBERTS
## Baccalaureate Speaker Puts Emphasis on Goodness, Truth, and Beauty 
### 
Summing up qualifications for true
greatness of manhood, and adjuring
members of the 1924 graduating class
of Stanford University to seek out
those things in life which are in them
selves worthwhile, the Rev. Richard
Roberts, of the American Presbyterian
Church, Montreal, Canada, delivered
the baccalaureate sermon for the
thirty-third annual commencement to
a capacity audience in the Memorial
Church Sunday.
Dr. Roberts declared that funda
mental courage for the right is one of
these things inherently worthwhile,
using as an illustration his text, Mat
thew 20:16-13, the story of the woman
who poured precious ointment on the
head of Christ, and His reply when
the indignant disciples complained of
the waste, "Why trouble ye the wo
man? For she had wrought a good
work upon me. For ye have the poor
always with you; but me ye have not
always."
Greatness of manhood, according to
the speaker, can be had only when
executive aptitude and manipulative
skill are linked with the quality which
is a compound of comeliness, truth
fulness, and goodness.
"We speak of goodness, truth, and
beauty as separate things," said Dr.
Roberts, "but they belong organically
to each other. There can be no abid
ing beauty that does not go hand in
hand with goodness and truth, and
there can be no perfect goodness or
perfect truth until goodness and truth
take beauty by the hand. In God,
goodness is truth and truth' is beauty
—there are not three things but one
thing; and it is when the divine beam
is refracted through the prism of our
mortality that it is split into three
separate things. Now we of the Puri
tan tradition have always been ready
to pay at least life-service to goodness
and truth; but we have never called
beauty to its own place on the triple
throne. Beauty still waits in the outer
courts of life; and this is tragedy
enough, but there is tragedy even
worse, namely, that in these latter
days of the world, not beauty alone
but goodness and truth have been de
throned to make room for another
God. For this is what we have come
to call a commercial age. . .
"The place of the economic process
in relation to the rest of life is pre
cisely the place of the kitchen in the
home. I do not say this to despise
commerce; for ihe kitchen is indis
pensable, fundamental, honorable. But
nowadays, truth and beauty which
should have their own rooms in the
house of life have been dragged down
to help in the kitchen. Goodness is
being recommended to us as a condi
tion of business success. The Sermon
on the Mount, says Mr. Roger Babson,
is good business. Perhaps—but, the
only person that ever LIVED the Ser
mon on the Mount died on a felon's
gibbet. Professor Santayana says that
he heard a President of Yale say to
his students: 'Young men, be Chris
tians and you will be successful' —
which is no doubt true if your idea of
success includes a Cross. The man
who is good because it does not pay
to be bad is, of course, not good at all;
he is merely selfish, and his goodness
is a form of graft on the universe.
"Truth also has been forced into
the kitchen; for Science, the priestess
of truth, is today chiefly engaged as
a maid of all work to commerce; and
we think of it not primarily as a
seeker and finder of truth but as a
subordinate department of wealth pro
duction. I do not say that Science is
not truthfully and legitimately en
gaged in the task of perfecting manu
facturing processes; but that is a side
line to its proper trade. But, alack-a
day, this is not the worst that has
happened to Science; it has become a
minister of death and destruction.
Think of how it is being prostituted
today to the discovery of poisonous
gases, of mysterious death-dealing
rays of energy which have already
made possible forms of war which
make our existing military and naval
establishments nothing more than ob
solete survivals. How much longer, I
wonder, are scientists going to allow
science to be tethered to the sham
bles?
"And as for Beauty—think what we
have done with Art! There is a mon
strous thing among us that goes by
the name of Commercial Art —Com-
mercial Art, God save us! Of course,
there is no such thing. Art is Art only
when it is the disinterested minister
of beauty.
"To few of us is given the faculty
of making beautiful things; but to
none of us is denied the faculty of
doing the beautiful deed, the good
deed, and the true deed, no less. The
real man will be saint, scientist, and
artist in his own person; lover and
practitioner of goodness, truth, and
beauty.
"Whert the Greeks wanted to de
scribe a gentleman, in the real sense
of that ill-used word, they put two
words together and called him both
comely and good; and it was needless
to add that truth dwelt in him no less.
It is such gentlemen and such gentle
women that I pray you may be and
so may carry yourselves in the great
world.
"Your years here are at an end; and
now you go to your various tasks in
the world; but whether you teach or
rule, whether you till the soil or build
bridges, whether you heal and prevent
disease or you buy and sell, the form
of your task is of less consequence
than the human quality you put into
it; and whatever it is, you may make
it good and true and beautiful.
"Perhaps some of you have had a
thought of being great financiers or
great politicians or great surgeons or
great journalists. Well, that is all
right, but. there is something better;
and that is to be a great man in
politics, a great man in business, a
great, man in journalism . . . When
executive aptitude and manipulative
skill are linked with this character of
comeliness, truthfulness, and good
ness, then you have greatness of man
hood."

the speaker, can be had only when
executive aptitude and manipulative
skill are linked with the quality which
is a compound of comeliness, truth
fulness, and goodness.
"We speak of goodness, truth, and
beauty as separate things," said Dr.
Roberts, "but they belong organically
to each other. There can be no abid
ing beauty that does not go hand in
hand with goodness and truth, and
there can be no perfect goodness or
perfect truth until goodness and truth
take beauty by the hand. In God,
goodness is truth and truth' is beauty
—there are not three things but one
thing; and it is when the divine beam
is refracted through the prism of our
mortality that it is split into three
separate things. Now we of the Puri
tan tradition have always been ready
to pay at least life-service to goodness
and truth; but we have never called
beauty to its own place on the triple
throne. Beauty still waits in the outer
courts of life; and this is tragedy
enough, but there is tragedy even
worse, namely, that in these latter
days of the world, not beauty alone
but goodness and truth have been de
throned to make room for another
God. For this is what we have come
to call a commercial age. . .
"The place of the economic process
in relation to the rest of life is pre
cisely the place of the kitchen in the
home. I do not say this to despise
commerce; for ihe kitchen is indis
pensable, fundamental, honorable. But
nowadays, truth and beauty which
should have their own rooms in the
house of life have been dragged down
to help in the kitchen. Goodness is
being recommended to us as a condi
tion of business success. The Sermon
on the Mount, says Mr. Roger Babson,
is good business. Perhaps—but, the
only person that ever LIVED the Ser
mon on the Mount died on a felon's
gibbet. Professor Santayana says that
he heard a President of Yale say to
his students: 'Young men, be Chris
tians and you will be successful' —
which is no doubt true if your idea of
success includes a Cross. The man
who is good because it does not pay
to be bad is, of course, not good at all;
he is merely selfish, and his goodness
is a form of graft on the universe.
"Truth also has been forced into
the kitchen; for Science, the priestess
of truth, is today chiefly engaged as
a maid of all work to commerce; and
we think of it not primarily as a
seeker and finder of truth but as a
subordinate department of wealth pro
duction. I do not say that Science is
not truthfully and legitimately en
gaged in the task of perfecting manu
facturing processes; but that is a side
line to its proper trade. But, alack-a
day, this is not the worst that has
happened to Science; it has become a
minister of death and destruction.
Think of how it is being prostituted
today to the discovery of poisonous
gases, of mysterious death-dealing
rays of energy which have already
made possible forms of war which
make our existing military and naval
establishments nothing more than ob
solete survivals. How much longer, I
wonder, are scientists going to allow
science to be tethered to the sham
bles?
"And as for Beauty—think what we
have done with Art! There is a mon
strous thing among us that goes by
the name of Commercial Art —Com-
mercial Art, God save us! Of course,
there is no such thing. Art is Art only
when it is the disinterested minister
of beauty.
"To few of us is given the faculty
of making beautiful things; but to
none of us is denied the faculty of
doing the beautiful deed, the good
deed, and the true deed, no less. The
real man will be saint, scientist, and
artist in his own person; lover and
practitioner of goodness, truth, and
beauty.
"Whert the Greeks wanted to de
scribe a gentleman, in the real sense
of that ill-used word, they put two
words together and called him both
comely and good; and it was needless
to add that truth dwelt in him no less.
It is such gentlemen and such gentle
women that I pray you may be and
so may carry yourselves in the great
world.
"Your years here are at an end; and
now you go to your various tasks in

bridges, whether you heal and prevent
disease or you buy and sell, the form
of your task is of less consequence
than the human quality you put into
it; and whatever it is, you may make
it good and true and beautiful.
"Perhaps some of you have had a
thought of being great financiers or
great politicians or great surgeons or
great journalists. Well, that is all
right, but. there is something better;
and that is to be a great man in
politics, a great man in business, a
great, man in journalism . . . When

Summing up qualifications for true
greatness of manhood, and adjuring

those things in life which are in them
selves worthwhile, the Rev. Richard
Roberts, of the American Presbyterian

the waste, "Why trouble ye the wo

worse, namely, that in these latter
days of the world, not beauty alone
but goodness and truth have been de
throned to make room for another
God. For this is what we have come
to call a commercial age. . .
"The place of the economic process
in relation to the rest of life is pre
cisely the place of the kitchen in the
home. I do not say this to despise
commerce; for ihe kitchen is indis
pensable, fundamental, honorable. But
nowadays, truth and beauty which
should have their own rooms in the
house of life have been dragged down
to help in the kitchen. Goodness is
being recommended to us as a condi
tion of business success. The Sermon
on the Mount, says Mr. Roger Babson,
is good business. Perhaps—but, the
only person that ever LIVED the Ser
mon on the Mount died on a felon's
gibbet. Professor Santayana says that
he heard a President of Yale say to
his students: 'Young men, be Chris
tians and you will be successful' —
which is no doubt true if your idea of
success includes a Cross. The man
who is good because it does not pay
to be bad is, of course, not good at all;
he is merely selfish, and his goodness
is a form of graft on the universe.
"Truth also has been forced into
the kitchen; for Science, the priestess
of truth, is today chiefly engaged as
a maid of all work to commerce; and
we think of it not primarily as a
seeker and finder of truth but as a
subordinate department of wealth pro
duction. I do not say that Science is
not truthfully and legitimately en
gaged in the task of perfecting manu
facturing processes; but that is a side
line to its proper trade. But, alack-a
day, this is not the worst that has
happened to Science; it has become a
minister of death and destruction.
Think of how it is being prostituted
today to the discovery of poisonous
gases, of mysterious death-dealing
rays of energy which have already
made possible forms of war which
make our existing military and naval
establishments nothing more than ob
solete survivals. How much longer, I
wonder, are scientists going to allow
science to be tethered to the sham
bles?
"And as for Beauty—think what we
have done with Art! There is a mon
strous thing among us that goes by
the name of Commercial Art —Com-
mercial Art, God save us! Of course,
there is no such thing. Art is Art only
when it is the disinterested minister
of beauty.
"To few of us is given the faculty
of making beautiful things; but to
none of us is denied the faculty of
doing the beautiful deed, the good
deed, and the true deed, no less. The
real man will be saint, scientist, and
artist in his own person; lover and
practitioner of goodness, truth, and
beauty.
"Whert the Greeks wanted to de
scribe a gentleman, in the real sense
of that ill-used word, they put two
words together and called him both
comely and good; and it was needless
to add that truth dwelt in him no less.
It is such gentlemen and such gentle
women that I pray you may be and
so may carry yourselves in the great
world.
"Your years here are at an end; and
now you go to your various tasks in
the world; but whether you teach or
rule, whether you till the soil or build
bridges, whether you heal and prevent
disease or you buy and sell, the form
of your task is of less consequence
than the human quality you put into
it; and whatever it is, you may make
it good and true and beautiful.
"Perhaps some of you have had a
thought of being great financiers or
great politicians or great surgeons or
great journalists. Well, that is all
right, but. there is something better;
and that is to be a great man in
politics, a great man in business, a
great, man in journalism . . . When
executive aptitude and manipulative
skill are linked with this character of
comeliness, truthfulness, and good
ness, then you have greatness of man
hood."

Summing up qualifications for true
greatness of manhood, and adjuring
members of the 1924 graduating class
of Stanford University to seek out
those things in life which are in them
selves worthwhile, the Rev. Richard
Roberts, of the American Presbyterian
Church, Montreal, Canada, delivered
the baccalaureate sermon for the
thirty-third annual commencement to
a capacity audience in the Memorial
Church Sunday.
Dr. Roberts declared that funda
mental courage for the right is one of
these things inherently worthwhile,
using as an illustration his text, Mat
thew 20:16-13, the story of the woman
who poured precious ointment on the
head of Christ, and His reply when
the indignant disciples complained of
the waste, "Why trouble ye the wo
man? For she had wrought a good
work upon me. For ye have the poor
always with you; but me ye have not
always."
Greatness of manhood, according to
the speaker, can be had only when
executive aptitude and manipulative
skill are linked with the quality which
is a compound of comeliness, truth
fulness, and goodness.
"We speak of goodness, truth, and
beauty as separate things," said Dr.
Roberts, "but they belong organically
to each other. There can be no abid
ing beauty that does not go hand in
hand with goodness and truth, and
there can be no perfect goodness or
perfect truth until goodness and truth
take beauty by the hand. In God,
goodness is truth and truth' is beauty
—there are not three things but one
thing; and it is when the divine beam
is refracted through the prism of our
mortality that it is split into three
separate things. Now we of the Puri
tan tradition have always been ready
to pay at least life-service to goodness
and truth; but we have never called
beauty to its own place on the triple
throne. Beauty still waits in the outer
courts of life; and this is tragedy
enough, but there is tragedy even
worse, namely, that in these latter
days of the world, not beauty alone
but goodness and truth have been de
throned to make room for another
God. For this is what we have come
