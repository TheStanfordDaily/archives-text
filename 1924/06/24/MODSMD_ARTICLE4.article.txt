# WORTHWHILE THINGS SHOULD BE SOUGHT SAYS DR. ROBERTS
## Baccalaureate Speaker Puts Emphasis on Goodness, Truth, and Beauty 
### 
Summing up qualifications for true
greatness of manhood, and adjuring
members of the 1924 graduating class
of Stanford University to seek out
those things in life which are in them
selves worthwhile, the Rev. Richard
Roberts, of the American Presbyterian
Church, Montreal, Canada, delivered
the baccalaureate sermon for the
thirty-third annual commencement to
a capacity audience in the Memorial
Church Sunday.
Dr. Roberts declared that funda
mental courage for the right is one of
these things inherently worthwhile,
using as an illustration his text, Mat
thew 20:16-13, the story of the woman
who poured precious ointment on the
head of Christ, and His reply when
the indignant disciples complained of
the waste, "Why trouble ye the wo

work upon me. For ye have the poor
always with you; but me ye have not
always."
Greatness of manhood, according to
the speaker, can be had only when
executive aptitude and manipulative
skill are linked with the quality which
is a compound of comeliness, truth

"We speak of goodness, truth, and
beauty as separate things," said Dr.
Roberts, "but they belong organically
to each other. There can be no abid

goodness is truth and truth' is beauty
—there are not three things but one
thing; and it is when the divine beam
is refracted through the prism of our
mortality that it is split into three
separate things. Now we of the Puri
tan tradition have always been ready
to pay at least life-service to goodness
and truth; but we have never called
beauty to its own place on the triple
throne. Beauty still waits in the outer
courts of life; and this is tragedy
enough, but there is tragedy even
worse, namely, that in these latter
days of the world, not beauty alone
but goodness and truth have been de
throned to make room for another
God. For this is what we have come
to call a commercial age. . .
"The place of the economic process
in relation to the rest of life is pre
cisely the place of the kitchen in the
home. I do not say this to despise
commerce; for ihe kitchen is indis
pensable, fundamental, honorable. But
nowadays, truth and beauty which
should have their own rooms in the
house of life have been dragged down
to help in the kitchen. Goodness is
being recommended to us as a condi
