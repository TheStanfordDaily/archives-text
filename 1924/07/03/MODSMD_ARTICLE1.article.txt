# LAW SCHOOL WILL BE PLACED ON NEW BASIS NOVEMBER 1
## A.B. DEGREE REQUIRED Course Lengthened One Year; Change Recommended by Faculty 
### 
The Stanford Law School has been
placed on a graduate basis by recent
action of the Board of Trustees. Under I
the new system, admission to the "pro-j
fessional curriculum in law is to be
granted only to students who have re
ceived the degree of Bachelor of Arts ]
or an equivalent degree from this
University or from some other institu
tion of recognized collegiate standing."
This ruling does not go into effect
until November 1, 1924. Stanford is
the first western institution of its kind
to adopt such a standard. The new
system will lengthen the law course
one year. Heretofore, three years of i
academic and three of law have been |
required. Now, four years of academic |
and three of law will be necessary.
The resolution of the Trustees, j
which approves a recommendation
from the faculty of the Law School, is
as follows:
"Admission to the professional cur
riculum In law is to be granted only |
to students who have received the de
gree of Bachelor of Arts, or an equiv
alent degree, from this University or i
from some other institution of recog
nized collegiate standing: provided,
however, that students who have ma
triculated in Stanford University prior
to November 1, 1924, shall be admitted
to the law school upon fulfilling the
requirements in force on May 1, 1924."
Dean Kirkwood of the Law School
says of the new plan: "The action
has been prompted by the conviction
that the proper handling of legal prob
lems today requires a more thorough
understanding of economic, social, and
political forces than it is possible for
the intending law student to obtain in !
pre-legal curricula as they now exist
in most universities."
The faculty of the Stanford Law
School now consists of eight men who
devote their full time to the teaching;
of law and three active practitioners
of the California Bar, who lecture on
special subjects.
