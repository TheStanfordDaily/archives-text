Stanford is proud to welcome back
one of her most illustrious sons to the
campus. Herbert Hoover, Secretary
of Commerce, has returned to spend
a few weeks with his family.
Herbert C. Hoover is a name which
is known and respected, not only in
the United States, but all over the
world. During the recent World War,
Secretary Hoover proved a godsend to
this country and a benefactor to the
starving Europeans. His work has
not gone un-rewarded for the place
which he earned for himself in the
Cabinet has brought him the honor
and respect which he so richly de
serves.
Hoover is typical of the type of
Stanford graduates that is bringing
glory to the University all over the
world. He is a man of whom we are
all proud.
More power to -you, Secretary
Hoover, may your stay here be a
pleasant one.
