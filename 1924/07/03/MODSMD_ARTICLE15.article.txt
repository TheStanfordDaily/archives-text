Tomorrow is July the 4th. It is a
source of some wonder, at times,
whether or not the people of the
United States realize just what they
are celebrating. Most of them seek
the mountains or seashore for a day
of well-earned recreation. It would
be a fine thing, however, if every man,
woman, and child in the country could
pause for just a moment tomorrow
to think of the sacrifices which that
day commemorates.
