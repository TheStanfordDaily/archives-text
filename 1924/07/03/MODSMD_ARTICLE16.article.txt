### Barbara Miller 
"I started to work for Senator Stan-1
ford September 16, 1892, and have
been here ever since," says Joshua
Davies, caretaker of the various lawns
and gardens belonging to the sorority
and fraternity houses. .
At the time when Davies first came
to Stanford, the entire campus con
sisted of what now are the buildings
of the Inner Quad. The museum was i
the only structure outside of the Quad
rangle.
Clubhouse Site a Work Camp
The present site of the Women's
Clubhouse was a workmen's camp.
Davies lived there during the follow
ing winter, having been chosen to re
main from a group of seventy-five men
who worked in the fall on the Sears- 1
ville Dam and at laying pipes from
San Francisquito Creek to the place
where the Bookstore now stands.
Davies remembers the night in June,
1893, when Senator Stanford died. He
saw the Senator out riding in his car
riage the day before his death. At
three o'clock on that fateful morning
a horseman rode up to the workmen's
camp, demanding the foreman and
bearing the news, "The Senator is
dead."
Inactivity for Two Years
One month after .the death of Sena-1
tor Stanford, all work on the Farm
ceased. This inactivity lasted almost
two years. During this time, however,
Davies remained here, doing odd jobs
for the families in the vicinity. He
later was employed by Dr. Wood, the
first physician on the campus, and by |
Dr. Wilbur. At that time Dr. Wilbur j

lived in the house now occupied by
Dean Mary Yost.
. Zeta Psi First House
Davies was the gardener for the
first fraternity house on the campus,
Zeta Psi. It was the custom then to
have a house mother at a fraternity
house, and Davies distinctly remem
bers the one at the Zete house, Mrs.
Baker. The present Oyster place was
then occupied by the fraternity.
Davies is a native of South Wales,
and after coming to the United States
he worked in the Chicago refineries
and later in Omaha. He came to Cali
fornia in 1880, and was employed in
railroad* work, in the construction of
the Spring Valley Dam, and on the
Big San Mateo Dam project.
