# "OEDIPUS REX" WILL OPEN NEW DRAMATIC ERA AT STANFORD
## 
### Norris James 
For the first time in the history of
campus dramatics, Stanford Univer
sity will launch into the realm of
Greek drama this summer with an
elaborate production of Sophocles'
masterpiece, "Oedipus Rex," to be
given on the facade of the Stanford
Museum, the evening of August 15
with a cast of seventy under the di
rection of Miss Evalyn Thomas of the
University of California, Southern
Branch, and Gordon Davis.
With the highest ambitions to up
hold the traditions of presentations of
"Oedipus" in the United States and on
the continent Miss Thomas, who has
made a life study of Greek drama and
for several years worked with Gilbert
Murray, whose English translation of
the play will be used here, has arrived
on the campus and will take active
steps towards selecting a cast next
week.
"Oedipus Rex" is a thing of real
beauty and real art, amazingly sim
ple in its broad effects which should
be enhanced by the portico of the
Stanford Museum.
Because of the size of the cast and
the demand for a variety of charac
ters, Miss Thomas will interview per
sons intending to try out for the play
who should i - eport to her at the Little
Theater, Monday and Tuesday of next
week. Tryouts will be held in the
afternoons from two to four and from
eight until ten in the evenings. "Oedi
pus Rex" offers an exceptional oppor
tunity for students interested in Greek
drama to receive training under Miss
Thomas which will compare favorably
with that offered by the special
schools of instruction.
