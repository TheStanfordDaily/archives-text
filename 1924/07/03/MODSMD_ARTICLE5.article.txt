# ROWELL SAYS DAWES REPORT FILLS NEED
## PROMOTES COOPERATION Declares America Needs to Recognize Solidarity With Old World 
### Katherine Capell 
"We in America need to recognize
our solidarity with the rest of the
world," declared Chester Rowell, for
mer editor of the Fresno Republican,
who spoke before an assembly of the
student body Tuesday morning. "We
need to realize that the world has
shrunk so small there is no longer
such a thing as isolation in it."
The movement for self-government
that we see in the Philippines is going
on over all Asia which was once under
the domination of white men, accord
ing to observations made by Rowell on
his trip around the world last year.
This he believes to be a result of the
World War, when brown, black, and
yellow men discovered that Europe
had become nationalistic, isolated, and
consequently weakened.
"Domination by the white man be
gan with the discovery of America,"
Rowell stated. "Now after 400 years
the other half of the world —the big
ger half —had risen to deny this domi
nation, and has organized a movement
to govern itself as it likes. It is going
to, whether we like it or not."
That the World War was the sui
cide of European civilization is
Rowell's opinion. However, it es
caped being the suicide of Europe her
self, as now for the first time since
the war all countries are agreed upon
a policy on which Europe can go
ahead. The Dawes Report, headed by
Americans and independent of all gov
ernments, has made this co-operation
possible. Slight majorities in France
and Germany, a Labor government
without a Labor majority in England,
the Mussolini government in Italy, and
the Belgian people have accepted the
plan of the report.
"On this slender tenure the safety
of Europe and with it the safety of
America depends," asserted Rowell.
"For the continued use of the gold
standard, necessary to American pros
perity, depends on Europe's recogni
tion of it, and this can only be a result
of Europe's prosperity."
