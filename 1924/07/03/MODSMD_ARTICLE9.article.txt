# "THE DOVER ROAD" IS FIRST PLAY OF SUMMER OFFERINGS

An absurd comedy!
Thus Allan Alexander Milne charac
terizes "The Dover Road," his three
act play of English manners which
will open a summer season of As
sembly Hall plays under Gordon
Davis' banner, Friday evening, July
11. This is the first attempt on Davis'
part to make complete the yearly cycle
of Stanford theatricals by providing
dramatic instruction and entertain
ment during the summer session.
Whatever else the summer theat
rical season of 1924 may hold in store
for the campus, it will present plays
of different variety than those wit
nessed during the regular school year
and yet keep within the bounds of
student enthusiasm.
"The Dover Road" has to do with
runaway couples, and an eccentric
middle aged bachelor who specializes
in settling domestic differences and
patching up heart afflictions. A gran
ite-faced butler, Dominic, by name, is
thrown in for good measure.
The play is perhaps the first real
comedy (to stick closely to defini
tions) which has been seen on the
campus since Gordon Davis and Les
ter Seib brought their delectable "Be
linda" and "Tea for Three" to the
campus a couple of summers ago. The
sparkling yet unlabored dialogue, the
deft vital characterizations, Milne's
keen satire, and the freshness of the
play should meet with the instant ap
preciation of Stanford theatergoers.
Who else could possibly be better
fitted for the part of Latimer —the de
lightful rather fantastic middle aged
gentleman around whom the entire
piece is built, —than Gordon Davis,
himself? In "Belinda," "Tea for
Three," and the "Yellow Jacket" the
University dramatic coach gave three
distinctly professional characteriza
tions.
Four eminent laugh provokers will
assist in conjuring Milne's satire.
They are:
