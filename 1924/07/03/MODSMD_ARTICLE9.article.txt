# "THE DOVER ROAD" IS FIRST PLAY OF SUMMER OFFERINGS
## 
### Ray Law 
An absurd comedy!
Thus Allan Alexander Milne charac
terizes "The Dover Road," his three
act play of English manners which
will open a summer season of As
sembly Hall plays under Gordon
Davis' banner, Friday evening, July
11. This is the first attempt on Davis'
part to make complete the yearly cycle
of Stanford theatricals by providing
dramatic instruction and entertain
ment during the summer session.
Whatever else the summer theat
rical season of 1924 may hold in store
for the campus, it will present plays
of different variety than those wit
nessed during the regular school year
and yet keep within the bounds of
student enthusiasm.
"The Dover Road" has to do with
runaway couples, and an eccentric
middle aged bachelor who specializes
in settling domestic differences and
patching up heart afflictions. A gran
ite-faced butler, Dominic, by name, is
thrown in for good measure.
The play is perhaps the first real
comedy (to stick closely to defini
tions) which has been seen on the
campus since Gordon Davis and Les
ter Seib brought their delectable "Be
linda" and "Tea for Three" to the
campus a couple of summers ago. The
sparkling yet unlabored dialogue, the
deft vital characterizations, Milne's
keen satire, and the freshness of the
play should meet with the instant ap
preciation of Stanford theatergoers.
Who else could possibly be better
fitted for the part of Latimer —the de
lightful rather fantastic middle aged
gentleman around whom the entire
piece is built, —than Gordon Davis,
himself? In "Belinda," "Tea for
Three," and the "Yellow Jacket" the
University dramatic coach gave three
distinctly professional characteriza
tions.
Four eminent laugh provokers will
assist in conjuring Milne's satire.
They are:
Charles Simons, '27, who established
himself as a burlesquer in "The Mer
chant of Menace," this year's Ram's
Head show, as well as in the 1925
Junior Opera, "So This Is Eden." The
corpulent comedian will make his first
appearance in a 6erio-comic part as
Leonard, an erring husband.
Norris James, '24, a farceur who has
appeared in half a dozen campus suc
cesses including Shaw's "You Never
Can Tell" and "Androcles and the
Lion" as well as "The Hottentot," will
play Nicholas, "the other man."

Miss Carolyn Fromberg, '25, a trans
fer from Mills College, who received
her training in San Francisco and
Oakland theatricals, will be Eustacia,
the erring wife.
A. Grove Day, '26, remembered for
his excellent work in "Captain Apple
jack," will portray Dominic, the but
ler.
