to President and Mrs. Coolidge. Cal

away at a most trying time. The
president, as the end of his term
draws near, has a great deal of re

Also, he must look forward to the po

he must lead his party. Mrs. Coolidge,
too, is constantly under a great strain.

and Mrs. Coolidge go the heartfelt
sympathy of the students of Stanford
