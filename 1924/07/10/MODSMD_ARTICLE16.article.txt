# COLLECTOR OBTAINS STANFORD OFFICIAL SIGNATURES IN BOOK
## 
### 
More than 5000 official autographs
are contained in the autograph album
of James Alby Hill of Berkeley who
was on the campus recently getting
signatures of officials at Stanford.
The last fourteen of Hill's seventy
years have been spent in traveling
through twenty-seven states, two Ca
nadian provinces and two Mexican
states. He has not had the trouble of
catching trains and bothering with
time tables for he has walked all this
distance.
Leaving the Cliff House in San
Francisco on February 22, 1921, Hill
started on his longest journey with
Eastport, Maine, as his objective. But
at Galeon, Ohio, his native home, he
became ill and was forced to return
by train. This was two years, eleven
months and nineteen days after he
had started.
Hill has two hobbies, one of which
is an autograph album. The 5000 au
tographs include those of twenty gov
ernors and twenty-one university
presidents. "All are official 1 signa
tures except a few like that of my
mother, who is in her ninety-second
year," he said.
Hill's other hobby is an art sou
venir album which contains 307 letters
of greeting in duplicate, such as those
from one governor to another. In his
kodak collection he has pictures of 300
objects of national interest. A few of
these are pictures of Lincoln's log
cabin, his home at Springfield, Illinois,
and the Lincoln Memorial.
