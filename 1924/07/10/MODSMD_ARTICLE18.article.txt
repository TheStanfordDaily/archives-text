# Summer Drama Program Sent to Stanford Alumni
## 
### 
Seven hundred announcements of
Stanford's summer season of drama
were mailed this week to Stanford
alumni and friends in the peninsula
and bay district. The announcements,
in the form of a four-page program,
are the first of a series of new pub
licity methods with which Gordon
Davis, university dramatic coach,
hopes to enlarge the appeal of plays
presented by the university.
Wrestling has been made a major
sport at the University of Nebraska.
