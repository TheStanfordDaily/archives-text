# GRADUATE STUDENT AUTHOR OF PLAN FOR CHINESE COLLEGES
## 
### 
J. G. Maytin, graduate student in
the Political Science department, is
the author of a plan, now under con
sideration in the East, for the estab
lishment of a liberal Christian college
in China. Maytin maintains that the
Chinese mind is more open to liberal
thought than the outworn dogmas that
have been pressed upon them by the
missionary colleges. There is also, so
he says, great need for a college in
China where Chinese thought and
philosophy are taught.
Maytin has spent nearly fifteen
years in China, where his father had
commercial relations, and was for
some time in the diplomatic service.
He has been very much interested in
China and has made a special study
of problems relating to the far east.
Part of his undergraduate work was
done in Manchuria and Vladivostock,
although he took his B.A. and M.A. at
the University of California.
The plan is being backed by a num

ber of prominent people, including Dr.
Jordan, Dr. Wendte, who organized
the international Christian congresses,
and Dr. Wilber, president of the Uni
tarian Theological Seminary at Berke
ley.
The basis of future plans is to have
a Chino-American faculty and to es
tablish the college in the province of
Shantung. It has been chosen be
cause it is the "holy province" of
China; because it is central, yet off
the battlefield of China; and because
it has recently been returned to China
through the agency of the United
States.
