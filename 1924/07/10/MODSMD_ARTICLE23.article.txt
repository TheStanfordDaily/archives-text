Aba result of his keen interest in spiritualism, Thomas Welton Stanford,
** brother of Senator Stanford, in 1912 placed at the disposal of Stanford
University a fund of £10,000, the interest of which was to be applied to
investigations in the field of spiritualism and psychical research.
There was some hesitation on the part of the Department of Psychology in
accepting the gift of Stanford. The department felt that hasty acceptance
of the generous offer should not be permitted. It was obvious that the
implications underlying investigation in psychic or spiritualistic phenomena

would give the undertaking a different*?
character from that obtained in ordi
nary cases of endowment for scien- j
tific research.
The problems to be investigated j
were intimately connected with reli-'
gious beliefs and opinions of many |
persons, among them Thomas Welton
Stanford himself, who held many spiri
tualistic stances in his home in Mel
bourne, Australia. Dr. Frank Angell,
who was head of the Department of
Psychology at the time, felt that to
subject religious matters to scientific
reason would be a delicate task. The]
situation was further complicated by j
the existence of many false teachers
among the devout spiritualists.
Mediums Investigated
An investigation of professional j
mediums conducted by the Seybert'
Commission of the University of ;
Pennsylvania resulted in the conclu
sion that most of the mediums were
frauds. Despite the scornful attitude
of many of the scientific world, the
University decided to accept, the en
dowment. The carte blanche given by
Stanford freed the department from
feeling that it would be unduly ham

pered in its experiments by religious
complications; the work was simply
to be a matter of scientific investiga
tion.
The endowment itself defrayed the
expenses of a fellowship, refitted and
equipped laboratory rooms, and sup
plemented the apparatus furnished by
the University. In addition, Stanford
gave £100 a year for the purchase of
books and finally added to the dona
tions the large collection of "apports"
produced in stances in his home.
Coover Accepts Fellowship
The selection of an incumbent of
the fellowship was an important prob
lem, and after diligent inquiry Dr. J.
E. Coover, who is a well trained and
able psychologist and who is still con
ducting the psychical research at
Stanford, was chosen for the position.
Under Dr. Coover investigations in
telepathy, in the perception of subli
minal visual and auditory impressions,
and in other phases of psychical re
search, have been vigorously prose
cuted. In 1917 Dr. Coover published a
volume on "Experiments in Psychical
Research" which was welcomed by
workers in psychical research. The ex
tensive experiments have been for
most part negative as regards any
scientific demonstration of the occult.
Courses in psychical research are con
ducted by Dr. Coover.
