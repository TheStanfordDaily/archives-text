# "DOVER ROAD" READY FOR PRESENTATION TOMORROW
## Comedy of English Life Has Experienced Cast; Davis to Take Leading Part 
### Ray Law 
Dripping with laughs, carefully assorted and burnished by Gordon Davis
and his excellent company of veteran Stanford actors, "The Dover Road," the
first of Stanford's summer season of plays, will be presented tomorrow even
ing in the Assembly hall. The curtain will rise at 8:20.
As actor-director and general chief mogul of A. A. Milne's pleasant three
act comedy, Davis must of necessity be the "iron man" of the play.
As a director, little need be said of Stanford's dramatic coach. During
the four years he has been here, Davis has turned out nearly two dozen suc
cesses —plays which have attracted to the campus play lovers from the San
Francisco bay region who have favorably compared his presentations with
those of the professional stage.

| As an actor, too, Davis has shown ;
distinct artistry. His characteriza
tions in the beautiful production of
;"The Yellow Jacket," two years ago,
in "Belinda," in "Tea for Three," and'
other plays are well remembered.

Has Clever Inuendo.
So much for the chief personality
behind the play and now for the Milne i
comedy itself.
"The Dover Road" might well be an ;
English bedroom farce —if there were
la bedroom and Avery Hopwood slap- 1
j stick. And then there is altogether
too much an atmosphere of English;
smugness about the piece to allow!
'guardians of student morals to really \
become concerned.
Still, there is brilliant satire,
comedy bordering on broad farce —and
Sex spelled with a capital. If you are
a disciple of Freud perhaps you won't
be shocked at this type of play. Those
who fail to understand or agree with
Milne's theories 011 marital relations
will be fully compensated by the rib- j
tickling humor of the Britons. Fol-1
lowing is a sample bit of dialogue to
show you what may be expected:
ANNE (Anne Gardner Wayland) —
And you have allowed this Latimer to
steal your trunks and still you partake
of his hospitality! Oh!!
LEONARD (Charles Simons) —No,
my dear, 1 eat his kidneys now but I
shall keep a careful account of all
this.
Clever Supporting Cast.
Carolyn Fromberg as Eustacia
should come very close to stopping
the show. As the runaway wife, Miss
Fromberg's talents as a comedienne
are varied. Her theory of life which
should especially appeal to male mem- j
bers of the audience tomorrow is
something like this:
"Go strong on the clinging-vine
stuff. Every man adores it from
cradle to grave. Make your callow
youth friend believe he is the strong
est oak that ever grew and you are a
poor weak woman who would perish
but for his protection. Be his slave
and a nurse and you've got him tied
up for life."
Good advice! And supplemented by
that of Nicholas, the "other man," Nor
ris James. "If every man told the
truth, which, of course, he won't, be
cause he often isn't aware of it him
self, he would say: 'I am always at
tracted by the woman who flatters me.
She may or may not be beautiful, but
if she makes me think I am an Adonis
1 admire her exquisite taste. She may
be brilliant or stupid, but if she can
convince me that the world owes
much to my keen mind, I am her slave
forever.'"
Cast Is Experienced.
All the cast is experienced. Grove
Day, Dominic, the butler, appeared in
"Captain Applejack" last fall. Anne
Gardner Wayland was Gordon Davis'
leading lady in "The Yellow Jacket."
Charles Simons played burlesque
parts in the Ram's Head Show and
Junior Opera this year. Norris James
appeared in "You Never Can Tell,"
"The Hottentot" and "Androclea and
