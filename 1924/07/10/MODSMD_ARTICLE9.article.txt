Museum Is Setting.
Oedipus Rex of Sophocles, one of
the three plays planned by Gordon
Davis for the summer season, will bg
given on the steps of the Museum to
ward the end of the summer quarter.
The cast and chorus will be chosen
this week and rehearsals are to start
right away. Miss Evalyn Thomas,
Greek drama director at the Southern
Branch of the University of California
who has studied under Gilbert Murray
of Oxford, will direct the play.
Gilbert Murray, who translated
"Oedipus," tells us in his preface that,
while Thebes was under the rule of
Laius and Jocasta, there appeared a
monstrous creature, "The Riddling
Sphinx," who in some unexplained
way sang riddles of death and slew
people of Thebes. laius went to ask
the aid of the Oracle of Delphi, but on
the road, was slain mysteriously. Soon
afterwards, there came to Thebes a
j*bung Prince of Corinth, Oedipus. He
faced the Sphinx and read her riddle,
whereupon she flung herself upon her
rock and died. The throne, being va
cant, was offered to Oedipus and with
it the hand of the Queen Jocasta.
Some ten or twelve years later a
pestilence fell upon Thebes. At that
point the play begins.
Oedipus Kills His Father.
Oedipus, finding that banishment or
death of Laius' murderer will rid
Thebes of the pestilence, calls a seer,
Tiresias to untangle the mystery.
Tiresias charges Oedipus with the
crime and Oedipus in his wrath ac
cuses Creon, a Prince of Thebes of
inducing the seer to make a false ac
cusation so that he might gain the
throne. At this point, a messenger
from Corinth brings the news that
Oedipus, as a babe, was given to his
oare because it was prophesied that
the roval son would slay his own
parents when he grew to manhood.
The messenger also showed Oedipus
that a man whom he had killed in a
fit of anger shortly before, was his
own father, Laius.
Jocasta, in her anguish, kills herself
while Oedipus, on finding that he has
slain his father and wedded his own
mother, drives his sword through his
eyes. He then leaves Thebes and
goes into voluntary banishment.
