# "DOVER ROAD," FIRST OF SUMMER DRAMATIC OFFERINGS, SCORES HIT
## GORDON DAVIS PLEASES Subtle Humor, Clever Lines, Are Well Presented by Capable Cast. 
### Hulda Hoover 
Subtle humor more than mere com
edy characterized "The Dover Road,"
given last Friday night in the Assem
bly hall. The lines were clever, the
situations amusing, and outside of a
few minor breaks in the action it was
hard to realize that "The Dover Road"
was being presented by amateurs. The
play was unusually good in choice, in
terpretation, and finish.
Any hitches or flaws in the action
can easily be accounted for by the
fact that it was put on in rfecord time,
the cast only having rehearsed for
nine days.
Gbrdon Davis Pleases.
Much credit should go to Gordon
Davis both for his coaching and di
recting of the play and for his subtle
interpretation of the character of Mr.
Latimer. Gordon Davis shows a finish
and ease in his acting that is not
found in the less experienced players.
Judging from the standpoint of
sheer comic effect, Charlie Simons as
Leonard carried away the honors of
the evening. He had the appearance
essential to his role and his facility
of movement and expression hold
great promise for future Stanford dra
matics. Simons was best in the sec
ond act where, as the victim of a
series of "unfortunate accidents," he
gave the audience little respite from
laughing.
Anne, played by Anne Gardner Way
land, delighted the audience with her
pleasing voice and charming person
ality. We had no fault to find in
Leonard's taste when he ran away
with her.
The laughs which greeted the "apt"
appearances of Dominic left no ques
tion as to the success with which
Grove Day took the part of the im

peturbable butler.
Norris James' acting is always ad
mirable and his presentation of
Nicholas, the disillusioned lover, was
no exception.
Carolyn Fromberg as Eustatia, an
unappreciated administering angel,
was very good and her lachrymose ef
forts were especially convincing.
Staff Efficient.
The staff deserves special mention
for the clock-like perfection which
contributed immensely to the enjoy
ment and appreciation of the success
ful whole.
The setting, designed by Chrysella
Dunker and carried out by Lesly Ky
ler and Gordon Davis' class in Theatre
Workshop was quite up to the stand
ard set by those of former plays in
the Stanford Assembly hall.

An attempt to raise silver foxes in
mountain altitudes is now being made
in France.
