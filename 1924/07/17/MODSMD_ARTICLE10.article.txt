# CLARK MARIONETTES TO GIVE PROGRAM ON CAMPUS TOMORROW
## 
### 
G. Fletcher Clark and his wife, Celia
Rantz Clark, will introduce the Clark
Marionettes on the campus at a pro
gram in the Women's Clubhouse to
morrow evening at 8:15.
The ClarKs use tlie type of marion
ettes known as the guignol puppets
which are grotesque figures operated
upon the hands and fingers of the pup
peteers. Mr. Clark carves the heads
of these miniature actors from hard
woods and Mrs. Clark attends to the
painting and costuming.
Mr. and Mrs. Clark manipulate the
puppets and speak the lines together.
Three plays, which they have written,
will compose their program here. "The
Singing Master" is a satirical episode
of the comedy-of-manners type, which
they have translated from the French.
"Doctor Faustus" is a modernized
comedy version of the old legend.
"The Bird Feng" is an Oriental ro
mance, adapted from a fairy tale.
The Clarks have recently returned
from a tour of Southern California and
they will take their marionettes to
Carmel, for performances, later in the
summer. They live also been asked
to exhibit the puppets at the State
Fair this fall.
