Pulitzer Prize.
Chosen as the winner of the Pulitzer
prize for the best American play of
1922, "Icebound" achieved success on
the New York stage, and is still a
reigning favorite with stock com
panies and amateurs throughout the
country. Written by Owen Davis, the
author of "The Detour," another very
successful production, "Icebound" of
fers a study of rural life which had
been the environment of the author in
his youth.
The play describes a group of North
ern Maine small-town folk, whose
faults and virtues are the direct result
of their own heritage and environ
ment, untainted by any foreign ele
ment; its theme shows that a great
love survives everythingâ€”that a dead
woman may reach out of the darkness
of the grave and impose her will upon
the living.
The cast will t>e cnosen tonight by
Gordon Davis and should prove to be
exceptionally strong, as most of the
members have had extensive experi
ence in dramatics. A large number
turned out for the tryouts, enabling
Davis to select his players from
among the best on the campus.
