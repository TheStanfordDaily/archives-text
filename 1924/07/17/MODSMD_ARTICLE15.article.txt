The writer of this comment has
noticed, in the past three weeks, that
a number of Stanford traditions have
been broken. Doubtless this sort of
thing has gone on unintentionally and
probably as much of the fault lies with
the older students as with those who
are new here.
It is the £uty of those who are ac
quainted with the traditions to inform
the newcomers and it is the duty of
the latter to fall in line while they are
here.
The most admirable of all Stanford
traditions —the "hello habit" —is being
utterly neglected, and for no apparent
reason. During the regular college
year, a man student, passing another
man student, or group of students
calls out "hello" or "hello gents."
There is no reason why summer quar
ter students should not feel the same
"tie that binds."
Another very sacred Stanford tra
dition which is being violated regu
larly is the rule which prevents smok
ing on the Quad. The story goes that
a Stanford professor, soon after the
University was founded, started down
the Quad one day smoking a cigar.
Several students approached him and
asked him to refrain from smoking
while on the Quad. He complied and
the tradition was started.
The Quad is a hallowed spot to
every Stanford man and woman and
it is the duty of all those who are
Stanford men and women to see that
its sanctity is not violated.
The Daily Palo Alto believes that
these traditions, as well as the others
of which Stanford people are so proud,
should be observed. Cooperation from
summer quarter students, only, can
make this observation possible now.

The Daily Palo Alto welcomes, at
any time, communications from stu
dents or faculty members. These
communications should deal with
topics of interest to students, should
contain no personal remarks, and
MUST be limited to 200 words. Con
structive criticism is welcome, at all
times, in the Daily office.

Those who were fortunate enough to
see .the "Dover Road" last Friday
night will'want to get their tickets
for "Icebound" early. Gordon Davis
and his cohorts certainly did them
selves proud in the opening event of
the summer drama season.
