# HARRY MALONEY WRITES OF CARD TENNIS TEAM'S EXPERIENCES ON OCEAN VOYAGE
## 
### Harry W. Matoney 
Harry W. Moloney, coach, trainer, and
manager of the Stanford tennis team,
which is touring Australia this summer,
in a letter to the editor of the Daily
Palo Alto describes the trip across the
ocean as follows:

The members of the Stanford team
en route to Australia find themselves
at this writing, June 25, some few
thousand miles from the homeland, or
to be more exact, a few miles beyond
the Equator, and some 1,500 miles
from Tahiti, termed the Paradise of
the Pacific.
A clear sky, magnificent weather,
and about one hundred and fifty con
genial passengers, together with a
most courteous group of ship's officers,
commanded by Captain L. C. H. Wor
rail, tend to make life on board the
R. M. S. Maunganui indeed pleasant.
Some two days out from San Fran
cisco, the purser on the ship called a
meeting of all passengers interested
in deck sports. The meeting was at
tended by some fifty or more enthusi
astic passengers.
Committee Chosen.
It was decided at the meeting to or
ganize an athletic committee, and by
a unanimous vote of all present, the
writer was elected chairman of the
committee on sports and entertain
ment. The Stanford tennis team also
came in for a share of honors by be
ing elected members of the committee.
Over 100 of the passengers, men and
women, signed up as participants in
the different athletic events which in
clude deck quoits, deck tennis, peg
quoits, bull board, etc.
We are at this time down to the
semi-final stage in all the athletic
events, and it is interesting to note
the large percentage of ladies that
have survived the preliminary rounds
proper, and who are now awaiting the
outcome of the finals. The Stanford
group are numbered with those who
were fortunate enough to reach the
semi-final stage, and each member of
the group have their minds set upon
winning at least a few of the prizes
that are to be awarded the winner of
each event.
$200 in Prizes.
Some $200 have been subscribed by
the passengers, which will go towards
the buying of prizes for the winners.
Prizes will also be awarded to the
winners of a bridge tournament to
gether with a mah jong tournament.
Both of these tournaments are at this
moment taking place in the lounge
room. The Stanford men are holding ]
their own in the bridge tournament,
but they seem to know little of the
imported Chinese game.
All prizes will be presented by the
commander of the ship on Friday
evening next during the entertainment

that is to be given by the passengers.
There is considerable talent aboard
the vessel, and a good program is be
ing arranged by the committee on en
tertainment.
The commander of the vessel very
courteously consented to allow a ten
nis net to be strung across deck B, and
by stringing netting for a considerable
distance along the side of the ship
this makes an ideal place for the ten
nis team to practice. This practice
has assisted very materially in keep
ing their hand in, relative to their
strokes and so forth.
May Play at Tahiti.
The writer has sent a wireless to
Newman Blood, Stanford '12, who is
now sojourning at Tahiti awaiting a
vessel so as to be able to continue on
his journey to San Francisco from
which place he intends to run down
to Stanford to renew old acquaint
ances. The wireless to Blood asked
that he try and arrange for the Stan
ford team to get in some stiff prac
tice during the time that the ship is in
port at Tahiti, which we are given to
understand will be some 12 hours.
The Stanford tennis team goes
through a stiff physical drill each
morning at 7:30 on the upper deck,
the instruction being given by the
writer. An invitation was extended
to the passengers to take part in this
morning exercise and some 20 or more
passengers—both men and women —
availed themselves of the opportunity
to keep physically fit during the long
voyage. The exercises are followed
by a class boxing drill, in which of
course only the men take part.
Men in Good Shape.
The result of this systematic phy
sical drill, together with the tennis
practice indulged in by the members
of the team between 11 and 12 o'clock
each morning, is fast putting the
members of the team into good phy
sical condition which will mean much
to the team after they disembark at

Sydney, where they will have but a
few days in which to prepare for the
first test match.
Last evening the passengers were
privileged to listen to a very interest
ing and instructive lecture on Ancient
Egypt. The lecture was given by Dr.
J. J. Van der Liew, the well known
authority on sociology. The lecture
was illustrated by lantern slides, and
took place out of doors on deck B.
This will give your readers some
idea of the smoothness of the trip so
far. Dr. Van der Liew is now finish
ing a lecture tour of the world, and
hie itinerary called for a lecture at
Stanford University, and he informed
the writer that he regretted very much
that he was prevented from visiting
Stanford during his present tour and
that he hoped to be able to do so upon
his return from Australia.
The small Stanford group seems to
fit in with the daily life on the ship.
They have made friends, are cour
teous to all, and conduct themselves
as all true Stanford men should.

J. J. Van der Liew, the well known
authority on sociology. The lecture
was illustrated by lantern slides, and
took place out of doors on deck B.
This will give your readers some
idea of the smoothness of the trip so
far. Dr. Van der Liew is now finish
ing a lecture tour of the world, and
hie itinerary called for a lecture at
Stanford University, and he informed
the writer that he regretted very much
that he was prevented from visiting
Stanford during his present tour and
that he hoped to be able to do so upon
his return from Australia.
The small Stanford group seems to
fit in with the daily life on the ship.
They have made friends, are cour

as all true Stanford men should.
Harry W. Moloney, coach, trainer, and
manager of the Stanford tennis team,
which is touring Australia this summer,
in a letter to the editor of the Daily
Palo Alto describes the trip across the
ocean as follows:

The members of the Stanford team
en route to Australia find themselves
at this writing, June 25, some few
thousand miles from the homeland, or
to be more exact, a few miles beyond
the Equator, and some 1,500 miles
from Tahiti, termed the Paradise of
the Pacific.
A clear sky, magnificent weather,
and about one hundred and fifty con
genial passengers, together with a
most courteous group of ship's officers,
commanded by Captain L. C. H. Wor
rail, tend to make life on board the
R. M. S. Maunganui indeed pleasant.
Some two days out from San Fran
cisco, the purser on the ship called a
meeting of all passengers interested
in deck sports. The meeting was at
tended by some fifty or more enthusi
astic passengers.
Committee Chosen.
It was decided at the meeting to or
ganize an athletic committee, and by
a unanimous vote of all present, the
writer was elected chairman of the
committee on sports and entertain
ment. The Stanford tennis team also
came in for a share of honors by be
ing elected members of the committee.
Over 100 of the passengers, men and
women, signed up as participants in
the different athletic events which in
clude deck quoits, deck tennis, peg
quoits, bull board, etc.
We are at this time down to the
semi-final stage in all the athletic
events, and it is interesting to note
the large percentage of ladies that
have survived the preliminary rounds
proper, and who are now awaiting the
outcome of the finals. The Stanford
group are numbered with those who
were fortunate enough to reach the
semi-final stage, and each member of
the group have their minds set upon
winning at least a few of the prizes
that are to be awarded the winner of
each event.
$200 in Prizes.
Some $200 have been subscribed by
the passengers, which will go towards
the buying of prizes for the winners.
Prizes will also be awarded to the
winners of a bridge tournament to
gether with a mah jong tournament.
Both of these tournaments are at this
moment taking place in the lounge
room. The Stanford men are holding ]
their own in the bridge tournament,
but they seem to know little of the
imported Chinese game.
All prizes will be presented by the
commander of the ship on Friday
evening next during the entertainment

that is to be given by the passengers.
There is considerable talent aboard
the vessel, and a good program is be
ing arranged by the committee on en
tertainment.
The commander of the vessel very
courteously consented to allow a ten
nis net to be strung across deck B, and
by stringing netting for a considerable
distance along the side of the ship
this makes an ideal place for the ten
nis team to practice. This practice
has assisted very materially in keep
ing their hand in, relative to their
strokes and so forth.
May Play at Tahiti.
The writer has sent a wireless to
Newman Blood, Stanford '12, who is
now sojourning at Tahiti awaiting a
vessel so as to be able to continue on
his journey to San Francisco from
which place he intends to run down
to Stanford to renew old acquaint
ances. The wireless to Blood asked
that he try and arrange for the Stan
ford team to get in some stiff prac
tice during the time that the ship is in
port at Tahiti, which we are given to
understand will be some 12 hours.
The Stanford tennis team goes
through a stiff physical drill each
morning at 7:30 on the upper deck,
the instruction being given by the
writer. An invitation was extended
to the passengers to take part in this
morning exercise and some 20 or more
passengers—both men and women —
availed themselves of the opportunity
to keep physically fit during the long
voyage. The exercises are followed
by a class boxing drill, in which of
course only the men take part.
Men in Good Shape.
The result of this systematic phy
sical drill, together with the tennis
practice indulged in by the members
of the team between 11 and 12 o'clock
each morning, is fast putting the
members of the team into good phy
sical condition which will mean much
to the team after they disembark at

Sydney, where they will have but a
few days in which to prepare for the
first test match.

voyage. The exercises are followed
by a class boxing drill, in which of
course only the men take part.
Men in Good Shape.
The result of this systematic phy
sical drill, together with the tennis
practice indulged in by the members
of the team between 11 and 12 o'clock
each morning, is fast putting the
members of the team into good phy
sical condition which will mean much
to the team after they disembark at

Sydney, where they will have but a
few days in which to prepare for the
first test match.
Last evening the passengers were
privileged to listen to a very interest
ing and instructive lecture on Ancient
Egypt. The lecture was given by Dr.
J. J. Van der Liew, the well known
authority on sociology. The lecture
was illustrated by lantern slides, and
took place out of doors on deck B.
This will give your readers some
idea of the smoothness of the trip so
far. Dr. Van der Liew is now finish
ing a lecture tour of the world, and
hie itinerary called for a lecture at
Stanford University, and he informed
the writer that he regretted very much
that he was prevented from visiting
Stanford during his present tour and
that he hoped to be able to do so upon
his return from Australia.
The small Stanford group seems to
fit in with the daily life on the ship.
They have made friends, are cour
teous to all, and conduct themselves
as all true Stanford men should.
Harry W. Moloney, coach, trainer, and
manager of the Stanford tennis team,
which is touring Australia this summer,
in a letter to the editor of the Daily
Palo Alto describes the trip across the
ocean as follows:

The members of the Stanford team
en route to Australia find themselves
at this writing, June 25, some few
thousand miles from the homeland, or
to be more exact, a few miles beyond
the Equator, and some 1,500 miles
from Tahiti, termed the Paradise of
the Pacific.
A clear sky, magnificent weather,
and about one hundred and fifty con
genial passengers, together with a
most courteous group of ship's officers,
commanded by Captain L. C. H. Wor
rail, tend to make life on board the
R. M. S. Maunganui indeed pleasant.
Some two days out from San Fran
cisco, the purser on the ship called a
meeting of all passengers interested
in deck sports. The meeting was at
tended by some fifty or more enthusi
astic passengers.
Committee Chosen.
It was decided at the meeting to or
ganize an athletic committee, and by
a unanimous vote of all present, the
writer was elected chairman of the
committee on sports and entertain
ment. The Stanford tennis team also
came in for a share of honors by be
ing elected members of the committee.
Over 100 of the passengers, men and
women, signed up as participants in
the different athletic events which in
clude deck quoits, deck tennis, peg
quoits, bull board, etc.
We are at this time down to the
semi-final stage in all the athletic
events, and it is interesting to note
the large percentage of ladies that
have survived the preliminary rounds
proper, and who are now awaiting the
outcome of the finals. The Stanford
group are numbered with those who
were fortunate enough to reach the
semi-final stage, and each member of
the group have their minds set upon
winning at least a few of the prizes
that are to be awarded the winner of
each event.
$200 in Prizes.
Some $200 have been subscribed by
the passengers, which will go towards
the buying of prizes for the winners.
Prizes will also be awarded to the
winners of a bridge tournament to
gether with a mah jong tournament.
Both of these tournaments are at this
moment taking place in the lounge
room. The Stanford men are holding ]
their own in the bridge tournament,
but they seem to know little of the
imported Chinese game.
All prizes will be presented by the
commander of the ship on Friday
evening next during the entertainment

that is to be given by the passengers.
There is considerable talent aboard
the vessel, and a good program is be
ing arranged by the committee on en
tertainment.
The commander of the vessel very
courteously consented to allow a ten
nis net to be strung across deck B, and
by stringing netting for a considerable
distance along the side of the ship
this makes an ideal place for the ten
nis team to practice. This practice
has assisted very materially in keep
ing their hand in, relative to their
strokes and so forth.
May Play at Tahiti.
The writer has sent a wireless to
Newman Blood, Stanford '12, who is
now sojourning at Tahiti awaiting a
vessel so as to be able to continue on
his journey to San Francisco from
which place he intends to run down
to Stanford to renew old acquaint
ances. The wireless to Blood asked
that he try and arrange for the Stan
ford team to get in some stiff prac
tice during the time that the ship is in
port at Tahiti, which we are given to
understand will be some 12 hours.
The Stanford tennis team goes
through a stiff physical drill each
morning at 7:30 on the upper deck,
the instruction being given by the
writer. An invitation was extended
to the passengers to take part in this
morning exercise and some 20 or more
passengers—both men and women —
availed themselves of the opportunity
to keep physically fit during the long
voyage. The exercises are followed
by a class boxing drill, in which of
