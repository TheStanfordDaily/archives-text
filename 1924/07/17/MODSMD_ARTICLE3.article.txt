# BARROWS DECLARES U. C. ALUMNUS ONLY AMERICAN IN SUDAN
## TIMBUCTOO MYSTERIOUS Assembly Speaker Praises French Government; Says People Are Docile, Honest, Loyal. 
### 
That an alumnus of the University
of California, Dr. Forbes, is the only
American living in the French Sudan,
was an interesting fact noted by Dr.
David P. Barrows, former president of
U. C., in his talk on "Timbuetoo and
the French Sudan," given in the Stan
ford Assembly hall last Friday morn
ing.
Dr. Barrows recounted his experi
ences during a five months' trip
through the Senegal territory, from
which he recently returned, and told
of the rapid rise, of the cotton indus
try due to Dr. Forbes, who was em
ployed by the French government to
introduce and climatize American
cotton.
"This section is very little visited
by any white men excepting the
French," declared Dr. Barrows. "Tim
buetoo, its most famous city, was for
centuries very mysterious. Until a
few years ago not more than three or
four white men entered it and re
turned to tell the story, fn 1895 the
French succeeded in occupying the
city, which was placed under the con
trol of Marshal Foch, then a major in
the French army. It is in the con
quest, exploration, and government of
this vast region that the French have
found a training field for their best
soldiers."
This great empire, according to Dr.
Barrows, was won in spite of govern
mental opposition of the Third Re
public, by the supreme efforts of a
few men. At present there are only
130 white men in the whole area, with
less than ten in the city of Timbuctoo.
French control is maintained by the
use of black men led and commanded
by white men of extraordinary charac
ter.
"The Negroid population is docile,
honest, kind, and loyal, comparing to
good advantage with the Moors, who
are the worst types of whites, and
who are noted for their cruel treat
ment of animals, to whom the blacks
afford a charming and considerate
treatment," asserted Dr. Barrows, add
ing, "I think that we will eventually
find the negro an asset to mankind."
