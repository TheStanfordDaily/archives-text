# SCIENTISTS CANNOT BE ATHEISTS, DR. JORDAN TELLS STUDENT BODY
## "GREAT MIND PRESENT" Chancellor Emeritus Speaks On Phases of Science In Assembly 
### Katherine Capell 
"Scientific men cannot be atheists,"
declared Dr. David Starr Jordan,
speaking at a University assembly-
Tuesday morning, on the subject,
"Three Phases of Science." In ex
planation he added, "It is impossible
to conceive of a world so highly de
veloped and so orderly without rec
ognizing the presence of a great
mind."
At present, according to Dr. Jor
dan, there are two sets of scientists
trying to arrive at a key to the riddle
of the universe. The first class con

yond our reach, he believes.
No Idea of Infinity
"What is going beyond the outer
most edge of the universe? What hap
pened ten years before time began?"
he asked, declaring it impossible to
get an idea of infinity.
The second class tries to solve the
riddle through the infinitely small.
"When I was a chemist," said Dr.
Jordan, "the atom was the smallest
thing found. Now the atom is consid
ered a little universe with electrons
revolving in orbits, and even smaller
units of measure may be found."
"I think another point of view comes
nearer to the true solution," asserted
Dr. Jordan. "That is the infiinitely
variable. An electron cannot change—
it just stays on. A mass of granite
