# SCIENTISTS CANNOT BE ATHEISTS, DR. JORDAN TELLS STUDENT BODY
## "GREAT MIND PRESENT" Chancellor Emeritus Speaks On Phases of Science In Assembly 
### Katherine Capell 
"Scientific men cannot be atheists,"
declared Dr. David Starr Jordan,
speaking at a University assembly-
Tuesday morning, on the subject,
"Three Phases of Science." In ex
planation he added, "It is impossible
to conceive of a world so highly de
veloped and so orderly without rec
ognizing the presence of a great
mind."
At present, according to Dr. Jor
dan, there are two sets of scientists
trying to arrive at a key to the riddle
of the universe. The first class con
sists of those dealing with the infin
itely great. The whole subject is be
yond our reach, he believes.
No Idea of Infinity
"What is going beyond the outer
most edge of the universe? What hap
pened ten years before time began?"
he asked, declaring it impossible to
get an idea of infinity.
The second class tries to solve the
riddle through the infinitely small.
"When I was a chemist," said Dr.
Jordan, "the atom was the smallest
thing found. Now the atom is consid
ered a little universe with electrons
revolving in orbits, and even smaller
units of measure may be found."
"I think another point of view comes
nearer to the true solution," asserted
Dr. Jordan. "That is the infiinitely
variable. An electron cannot change—
it just stays on. A mass of granite
remains the same except by outward
force. Neither can grow or reproduce
similar things. Only in living things
do we find irritibility, locomotion, nu
trition, and reproduction."
All living things are subject to evo
lution, which is the survival of those
who have run successfully the gaunt
let of life. "Did you ever stop to
think," he demanded, "that not one of
us ever had an ancestor who died in
infancy?"
Science, in the opinion of Dr. Jor
dan, should make for intelligence, re
ligion, or ethics, and love. Science is
to help man out, to tell him what is
right and wrong, and to develop all
into friendly, useful, and helpful re
lations.
