"There has been a widespread im
pression that Europe is chaotic," said
Dr. J. S. Davis, director of the Stan
ford Food Research Institute, speaking
in the Little Theatre Tuesday evening.
"The evidence as a whole does not
support this view.
"On the contrary, European coun
tries have been readjusting them
selves painfully and slowly, but more
or less steadily. The progress has
varies. In some countries, as in Italy,
it has gone far; in others, as in Rus
sia, it is still in an early stage.
"In some industries, such as coal
mining, it is fairly complete, in others
a considerable period of depression
lies ahead. In general, the pre-war
level of production, consumption, and
trade has not yet been regained, but
Europe has made substantial prog
ress."
Dr. Davis declared that this prog
ress has been impeded by several
handicaps, some of which are tempor
ary, and some of which are perma
nent.
