Rehearsals of "Icebound," the next
campus production which will be pre
sented by Gordon Davis's Theatrical
workshop class on August Ist, give
promise of affording one of the most
Interesting plays ever presented at
Stanford.
Owen Davis's drama of North Maine
country folk has for its theme a great
love that survives everything — the
powerful love of a dead woman which
reaches up from the grave and affects
the lives of her loved ones.
Urner Has Lead
The cast is comparatively new to
Stanford theatregoers, Philip Urner,
in the role of Ben Jordan, being the
only member of the cast with whom
the campus is familiar. Hattie Mai
Mixon, in the role of Jane Crosby,
should prove to be a delight in that
part, her former experience on the
amateur stage helping her to attain a
perfection in her role seldom seen on
.the campus.
Dorothy Thomas George brings to
the part of Sadie Fellows a wealth of
experience which has included sev
eral parts on the professional stage,
•the most important having been that
of Margaret, the might-have-been
daughter, in J. M. Barrie's play, "Dear
Brutus." James Kennedy, son of Pro
fessor Kennedy, appears in his first
role on the Assembly Hall stage as
Orin, son of Sadie Fellows. The ease
and sureness with which he reads his
lines augers well for his future career
in Stanford dramatics.
Good Technical Staff

which made such a success of the
