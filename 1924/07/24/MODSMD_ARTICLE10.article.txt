# "OEDIPUS REX" TO HAVE NOVEL STAGE SETTING AND LIGHTING EFFECTS
## REHEARSALS PROGRESS Sophocles Greek Tragedy Is Innovation in Dramatics At Stanford 
### Hulda Hoover 
Oedipus Rex of Sophocles, the
Greek play which is being given un
der the direction of Miss Evalyn
Thomas and Gordon Davis, is an en
tirely new type of undertaking in
Stanford dramatics. Given on the
steps of the museum the evening of
August 15, it will have a novel stage
setting and an elaborate system of
lights.
A colossal double stage will be built
in front of the museum steps and be
hind the statutes on either side are
to be the stairs by which the chorus
will enter. This stage with the back
ground of the museum with its statues
and pillars will make a fitting setting
for the presentation of the tragedy
that is being staged.
Lighting Effects
In the lighting the moon, which will
be full at this time, will be aided by
two towers on each side of the stage
which are to house the baby spots
and other lights. Hume West, who
has done the lighting for most of
the plays on the campus is coming
from Southern (California to take
charge of this work.
Throughout the play an orchestra
led by Dick Malaby will carry out the
mood of the drama.
Chrysella Dunker, who has designed
the sets for "The Dover Road" and
"Icebound," will have charge of the
costumes while the sets will be exe
cuted by Gordon Davis's class in
Theatre Workshop under the leader
ship of Lesly Kyler.
Cast of Sixty
The production itself will consist
of a cast of about sixty people in
cluding the leads, choruses, soldiers,
etc. The soldiers will have no speak
ing part and will not be cast until
shortly before the date of presenta
tion. Rehearsals are being held every
afternoon and evening in room 200 in
the English building under the direc
tion of Miss Thomas. The cast will
go on location Friday evening and
practice at the museum. The charac
ters have been practically selected
but cannot be announced until next
week when all of the cast has been
definitely decided upon.
This undertaking has drawn notice
from all parts of the state. Several
colleges, including the Southern
Branch of the University of Califor
nia, give Greek plays every year but
this is the first year that Stanford
has attempted anything of the sort
and it is being watched with interest.

The University of Chicago recently
spent some time endeavoring to find
out where the students waste their
time. A questionnaire was sent to all
the students of the University asking
some of the following: How many
studies? How much athletics? How
many debates? How much other ac
tivities? The filling out of the blank
was a requirement.

has done the lighting for most of
the plays on the campus is coming
from Southern (California to take
charge of this work.
Throughout the play an orchestra
led by Dick Malaby will carry out the
mood of the drama.
Chrysella Dunker, who has designed
the sets for "The Dover Road" and
"Icebound," will have charge of the
costumes while the sets will be exe
cuted by Gordon Davis's class in
Theatre Workshop under the leader
ship of Lesly Kyler.
Cast of Sixty
The production itself will consist
of a cast of about sixty people in
cluding the leads, choruses, soldiers,
etc. The soldiers will have no speak
ing part and will not be cast until
shortly before the date of presenta
tion. Rehearsals are being held every
afternoon and evening in room 200 in
the English building under the direc
tion of Miss Thomas. The cast will
go on location Friday evening and
practice at the museum. The charac
ters have been practically selected
but cannot be announced until next
week when all of the cast has been
definitely decided upon.
This undertaking has drawn notice
from all parts of the state. Several
colleges, including the Southern
Branch of the University of Califor
nia, give Greek plays every year but
this is the first year that Stanford
has attempted anything of the sort
and it is being watched with interest.

The University of Chicago recently
spent some time endeavoring to find
out where the students waste their
time. A questionnaire was sent to all
the students of the University asking
some of the following: How many
studies? How much athletics? How
many debates? How much other ac
tivities? The filling out of the blank
was a requirement.
Oedipus Rex of Sophocles, the
Greek play which is being given un
der the direction of Miss Evalyn
Thomas and Gordon Davis, is an en
tirely new type of undertaking in
Stanford dramatics. Given on the
steps of the museum the evening of
August 15, it will have a novel stage
setting and an elaborate system of
lights.
A colossal double stage will be built
in front of the museum steps and be
hind the statutes on either side are
to be the stairs by which the chorus
will enter. This stage with the back
ground of the museum with its statues
and pillars will make a fitting setting
for the presentation of the tragedy
that is being staged.
Lighting Effects
In the lighting the moon, which will
be full at this time, will be aided by
two towers on each side of the stage
which are to house the baby spots
and other lights. Hume West, who
has done the lighting for most of
the plays on the campus is coming
from Southern (California to take
charge of this work.
