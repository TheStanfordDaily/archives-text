# Stop Him!
## 
### 
He's back again! One of the most
atrocious and dangerous of all crimi
nals seems to have invaded the Stan
ford campus in large numbers. He is
a menace to every man, woman, and
child in the community where he is
found.
Given too much rein, he often be
comes a murderer. He selfishly
plunges ahead in his law-breaking
rampage, endangering lives on every
side. He should and must be stopped
before he takes his toll of human life
on the Stanford campus.
He is known as the SPEED
MANIAC.
At almost any hour of the day, ma
chines may be seen dashing about the
campus, on Palm Drive, or in Palo
Alto, at break-neck speed. It is un
safe to cross Salvatierra or any of
the other busy streets on the campus
at any time of the day or night with
out first looking about carefully.
Why does this sort of thing go on?
Certainly not because people fail to
realize the dangers of speeding. Pe
destrians are killed and injured every
day by reckless drivers. Certainly
not because people are careless of
their safety. Self-preservation is the
first law of nature.
The only reason that there is so
much speeding lies in the fact that
people are not willing to stand up for
their rights. The Speed Maniac not
only endangers his own life and prop
erty but he endangers the lives and
property of others and in doing so,
violates the rights that the Constitu
tion of the United States bestows on
them. In other words, it is the duty
of any citizen of the United States to
take a speeder's number and report
him for punishment.
The fact that some of the people
who have been exceeding the speed
limit on the campus are new here, is
no excuse. They have no more right
to break the law here than elsewhere.
The Daily Palo Alto observes with
satisfaction that the traffic officers
have again taken up their headquar
ters on Palm Drive. The Daily sin
cerely hopes that they are able to
catch every speeder.
