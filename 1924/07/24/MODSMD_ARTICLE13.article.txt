Frisch, Collins or Hornsby—who is the greatest second baseman? Hornsby
is the star batsman —Frisch the star fielder. Rogers led the National league
for four years—no argument there. Frisch's fielding stunts in the last world's
series would alone entitle him to a crown as one of the greatest defensive
second sackers who ever lived. He can bat, too —he hit for .390 in the last
three world's series. No argument there.
How about Collins, old man Eddie, he of the sloping shoulders and gum on
his cap? At the end of the 1923 season he had played in 2310 games, had a
lifetime batting average of .331 and had stolen 663 bases. Hornsby had
played in 1119 games, batted .351 aud stole 104 bases; Frisch, in 600 games,
hit .319 and stole 158 bases.
