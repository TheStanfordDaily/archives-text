# Oedipus "Wrecks" Wave Arms; Janitor Thinks Rehearsal Is Rally
## 
### 
Riley, the genial old gentleman
who puts the classrooms to bed every
night, thought he heard a rally going
on in the English building the other
night. Puzzled by hearing something
which should properly come only dur
ing quarters when there is intercol
legiate competition, he tiptoed sil
ently down the Quad.
From a vantage point outside the
windows of Room 200, he discerned a
myriad of arms waving at all angles
in the air. What seemed to be a
thousand voices were shouting now
deeply, now shrilly, and intersperced
were small little yips and yaps which
had all the semblance of "Atta Boy,"
and "Come On —Scotehy" and numer
ous other athletic ejaculations.
Not having had instructions re
garding any rally to be held on the
Quad that night, Riley's duty was to
investigate. He did so, and the cast
and chorus of "Oedipus Rex" were as
much surprised to see him as he was
to see them. Rehearsal went on after
explanations were made.
