# Roble Food Runs Out; Women Rebel at Idea Of Walking to Union
## 
### 
"Heck! I don't want to eat at the
Union."
"But you have to. That is what the
University has decided."
Thus goes the conversation of al
most everyone at Ruble hall these
days. All old sayings to the contrary
notwithstanding, the big question with
the girls is that o£ food. The trouble
arises from the closing of the lloble
dining room, at the end of the first
half of the summer quarter, for re
pairs. The University provides that
all the girls shall eat at the Union,
just as they would eat at Roble hall if
the dining room were running. The
girls object.
Many have made plans for the sec
ond half which do not coincide with
this arrangement. The result of a
house meeting Monday evening was
the appointment by Meribeth Cam
eron, house president of Roble, of a
committee to interview Miss Yost.
Miss Yost has taken up the matter
with President Wilbur and a settle
ment of some sort is expected soon.
