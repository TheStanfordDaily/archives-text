# U. S.-TURKEY PACT SHOULD BE RATIFIED SAYS WESTERMANN
## 
### 
The treaty of amity and commerce
signed in August, 1923, by the United
States and the Turkish Empire should
receive the ratification of the Senate
when it is brought before that body.
This is the opinion of Dr. W. L. West
ermann, of Columbia University, who
spoke in the Little Theatre Tuesday
night on "The New Turkey and the
United States."
Dr. Westermann denied that the
Turk today is the ruthless, brutal crea
ture which American newspapers have
described him to be.
"All the news from the Near East
has been rigidly censored by Euro
pean governments and news agen
cies," declared Dr. Westermann.
"Even the Christian Science Monitor,
one of our most faithful reporters of
news, did not carry the report of the
Greek massacres of 1919 at Smyrna
until March of 1920.
"All the guilt of massacres which
have horrified the American public in
recent years cannot be placed on the
Turk. The Greeks and Armenians
have been guilty of equally bloody
crimes. These events could only be
understood in the light of an intimate
study of Near Eastern history."
The treaty, according to Dr. Wester
mann, gives up special privileges, but
retains most favored nation treatment
and is in every way a thoroughly sat
isfactory document. The speaker ad
vanced two reasons for believing that
the pact shbuld be ratified.
"The policy of the United States in
Turkey can no longer be merely a mis
sionary policy, first of all. The growth
of American trade and interest in the
Near East demands that commerce be
taken into account. Second, the Turks
are trying to be a free people and it is
in conformity with the principles of
the United States that people who are
trying to be free should be given the
support of the American people.
