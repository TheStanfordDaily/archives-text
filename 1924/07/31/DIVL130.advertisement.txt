HOSIERY SATISFACTION
OUR NEVER TIRING AIM
We can't tell you about them all—you'll have to come
and see for there are any number of hosiery inspirations
awaiting you at Mendenhall's. We can't tell you about
them because it's difficult to describe them with all the
credit they deserve. You'll have to come and see, for
seeing is believing. All kinds of fancy garter materials
and ready-made-up garters at pricings that appeal.
