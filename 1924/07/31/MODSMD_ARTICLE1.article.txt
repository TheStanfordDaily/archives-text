# RUSSIAN ARISTOCRACY WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR REVOLUTION-SIR PARES
## GOVERNMENT INTRIGUE Lecturer Speaks on Inside War Diplomacy, Bosnia Question 
### 
The author of the Russian revolution
was the Russian aristocracy itself, ac
cording to Sir Bernard Pares, who
spoke on "The Inside Diplomacy of the
World War and the Russian Revolu
tion" in the Little Theatre Tuesday
evening.
Sir Pares, during the first three
years of the war was civilian repre
sentative of the British government
with the Russian armies. Contributing
factors to the downfall of Russia were,
according to Sir Pares, intrigues at
the court of St. Petersburg; treason
among ministers appointed through the
influence of the empress; soldiers who
went into battle unarmed to wait to
snatch weapons from their wounded
and dead comrades; and a thoroughly
corrupt regime which brought as its
heritage the Russian revolution.
Lack of Munitions
The failure of the Russian armies
was due to lack of munitions. Battal

while others were forced to give up
their arms so that they might be
shipped to other parts of the front.
On the eve of the revolution the
armies of the field had recovered

from the allies, but the rottenness of
the St. Petersburg regime made pro
gress impossible.
Czar Nicholas was under the abso

fused to surrender a single point to
the demands of the constitutional
party.

W'orld War from the Russian point of
view was to be found in the events of
1909, when Austria declared that Bos
na was to become permanently a part
of that empire. At the time Russia
protested strongly as a nation, but her
action was moderated greatly by Eng
land and France, who were opposed
to a war over the southern Slav ques
tion. Russia was weak at the time
from the effects of the revolution of
1905-06 and the Russo-Japanese war.
Continuing, Sir Bernard said: "Dur
ing the early years of the Great War,
some members of the Russian minis
try definitely wanted the Germans to
win. The whole Russian cabinet was
divided and this was the chief cause
