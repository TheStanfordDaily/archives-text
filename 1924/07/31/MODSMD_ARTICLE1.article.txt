# RUSSIAN ARISTOCRACY WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR REVOLUTION-SIR PARES
## GOVERNMENT INTRIGUE Lecturer Speaks on Inside War Diplomacy, Bosnia Question 
### 
The author of the Russian revolution
was the Russian aristocracy itself, ac
cording to Sir Bernard Pares, who
spoke on "The Inside Diplomacy of the
World War and the Russian Revolu
tion" in the Little Theatre Tuesday
evening.
Sir Pares, during the first three
years of the war was civilian repre
sentative of the British government
with the Russian armies. Contributing
factors to the downfall of Russia were,
according to Sir Pares, intrigues at
the court of St. Petersburg; treason
among ministers appointed through the
influence of the empress; soldiers who
went into battle unarmed to wait to
snatch weapons from their wounded
and dead comrades; and a thoroughly
corrupt regime which brought as its
heritage the Russian revolution.
Lack of Munitions
The failure of the Russian armies
was due to lack of munitions. Battal
ions were sent into the field unarmed,
while others were forced to give up
their arms so that they might be
shipped to other parts of the front.
On the eve of the revolution the
armies of the field had recovered
through the aid of munition supplies
from the allies, but the rottenness of
the St. Petersburg regime made pro
gress impossible.
Czar Nicholas was under the abso
lute control of the empress, who re
fused to surrender a single point to
the demands of the constitutional
party.
Bosnia Question
Sir Bernard said the origin of the
W'orld War from the Russian point of
view was to be found in the events of
1909, when Austria declared that Bos
na was to become permanently a part
of that empire. At the time Russia
protested strongly as a nation, but her
action was moderated greatly by Eng
land and France, who were opposed
to a war over the southern Slav ques
tion. Russia was weak at the time
from the effects of the revolution of
1905-06 and the Russo-Japanese war.
Continuing, Sir Bernard said: "Dur
ing the early years of the Great War,
some members of the Russian minis
try definitely wanted the Germans to
win. The whole Russian cabinet was
divided and this was the chief cause
for the failure to properly supply the
Russian armies.
In Touch With Germans
"In January of 1915 a member of
the Russian staff was in direct cor
respondence with the German authori
ties. When tried and hanged for his
treason, this official declared that his
action was justified because a victory
lor Germany was the only way to save
the Russian aristocracy.
"Early in 1915 a movement in the
Duma led to a coalition of groups into
a liberal party under the leadership of
a progressive bloc which constituted
all the brains. When the munitions
sca»dals became known, this group
pushed for reform and the adoption of
a constitution and efficient prosecution
of the war, but this movement was
utterly defeated by the efforts of the
empress."
The munitions scandals did for a
time bring more decisive action, ac
cording to Sir Bernard. Between the
period of the smashing defeats in
Galicia and the revolution in 1917, he
said, Russia had only one problem —
to put weapons into the hands of the
millions of Russian soldiers at the
front. For months Lord Kitchener had
been attempting to find out how Eng
land could aid the Muscovite armies,
and he eventually became their muni
tions agent. It* was Sir Bernard Pares
who carried to Kitchener from Russia
the list of munition needs of the czar's
armies.
Explaining the position held by the
Russian empress, Sir Bernard added:
"The letters of the empress have now
been published. She stands as her own
judge. All her thoughts were for her
little son, a very delicate child who
was sepitcaemic. On two occasions
when he was seriously ill, the notori
ous Rasputing had declared he would
recover; he did so. It was from this
time that Rasputin's influence over the
empress became supreme, and for this
reason alone; for her personal charac
ter was above reproach. She seldom
met him, his written messages to her
being transmitted through one of her
iadies in waiting.
"The empress," continued the speak
er, "was not pro-German, but she
could not bear the idea of her soi
coming to the throne with only limited
powers. For this reason she was abso
lutely opposed to all attempts at con
stitutional reform. She did not inter
fere actively in politics until July of
1915, but from that time on she be
came the evil genius of Russia. It was
she who persuaded the emperor to dis
miss the Grand Duke Nicholas and the
minister of the liberal bloc. Her hunt
was now for ministers who would be
favorable to the policies of Rasputin.
Thus the constitutional movement
was checked and the country was gov
erned by the will of the empress under
the complete control of Rasputin.
"It was Rasputin who ordered that
for three days railways should not
transport a single Russian soldier. It
was he who dictated the disposition
of supplies. In all these things he had
the complete support of the empress,
who would not believe the crimes
proved against him. All these facts
made Russia a thoroughly inefficient
fighting machine. Her ministers were
now men of no ability, and it became
impossible for the allies to give ef
fectual co-operation."
