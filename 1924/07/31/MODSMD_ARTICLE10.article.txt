# A
						STANFORD MAN
## 
### 
Sidney Walker Cole, one of the
hardest-working and most popular stu
dents here for the past two years, is
dead. "Sid," as he was popularly
known, gave his life in a successful
attempt to save that of a small boy
in an avalanche on Mt. Rainier.
The heartfelt sympathy of all his
friends at Stanford go out to his be
reaved parents. At the same time, those
who knew "Sid" are not surprised at
the circumstances under which he met
his death. A heroic act such as he did
when he gave his life can never be
forgotten.
Sidney Walker Cole was made of
the stuff that makes real Stanford
men. It is men like him that are carry
ing Stanford's banner to all corners of
the civilized world today. Small won
der, indeed, that Stanford should be
proud of such sons.
