# DR. WILBUR
## 
### 
President Wilbur will speak at a
student assembly next Wednesday
morning on the subject of "Stanford
University."
Those who have come to know Dr.
Wilbur need not be urged to attend
and hear what he has to say. They
will be there en masse. A word of
advice to those who have not been for
tunate enough to hear the President
speak â€”attend the assembly, or you
will miss one of the biggest opportuni
ties which will be offered you this
summer.
Speaking on Stanford University, Dr.
Wilbur will have as his subject some
thing which is very near to his heart.
He is an alumnus of the University
and, as a president, has proved an
outstanding figure in educational cir
cles. He will undoubtedly have a mes
sage which will be of interest to every
Stanford man and woman.

The writer of this comment was told
the other day that a Stanford woman
was seen smoking in a well-known
Palo Alto eating house. That informa
tion is wrong. If she was smoking she
was not a STANFORD WOMAN. The
Daily Palo Alto hopes that the in
formant was mistaken, that it was not
even a woman registered at the Uni
versity.
