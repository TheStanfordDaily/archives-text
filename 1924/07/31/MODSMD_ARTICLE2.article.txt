# Work Progressing On New Wings For Encina Gymnasium
## 
### 
Work is going forward rapidly this
week on the additions to Encina Gym
nasium, all the foundations being
completed. The brick work and plumb
ing are well under way. The contract
calls for the completion of the two
wings by October 1, which will add to
the athletic facilities for the fall quar
ter.
Approximately $6jJ,000 will be spent
on the building and gardening of the
adjacent grounds, according to Paul
H. Davis, graduate manager. The add
ed space will help to relieve the pres
ent congestion due to inadequate
locker and shower space, as well as

visitors' rooms, and training quarters.
One wing will include an entire set
of administration offices, including
rooms for the graduate manager, di
rector of physical education, medical
advisor, secretaries, clerks, publicity
department, and sport managers. The
gymnasium store will be greatly en
larged, and will occupy triple its pres
ent floor space.
Visitors' dressing rooms will occupy
three times their present space, and
team rooms will have twice their pres
ent capacity. A new training room of
greater size and facility than at pres
ent will be provided.
There will be an increase of 75 per
cent in the number of showers avail
able for students, and a 50 per cent
increase in the number of lockers.
