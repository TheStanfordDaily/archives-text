# "ICEBOUND" IS READY FOR CAMPUS PRESENTATION TOMORROW EVENING
## Second Production of Summer Drama Season Will Be Given In Assembly Hall 
### Charles Simmons 
mHE curtain will rise tomorrow night at 8:15 on "Icebound," the second of
*■ Gordon Davis' summer productions. Strenuous work on the part of the
cast during the past two weeks assures a well-rounded performance of the
play, which won the Pulitzer prize in 1922 for being the best American play
of the year.
The theme of "Icebound" concerns itself with a depiction of the characters
of country folk in a small North Maine town, and the way in which their
narrow, selfish natures react to a crisis. Owen Davis has evolved in this

j>play a remarkable series of character
delineations, which require more than
ordinary skill to enact.
Strong Cast
Each member of the cast, as chosen
by Gordon Davis, is admirably fitted
both physically and temperamentally
to take the part assigned to him, and
should evoke from the audience the
laughs and tears which are inter
woven throughout the action of the
play, in a decidedly professional man
ner. Rehearsals during the past week
have afforded Gordon Davis an oppor
tunity to smooth over and perfect the
dramatic and comedy moments with
which "Icebound" is plentifully sup
plied.
The death of the mother of a family
of grown children is the motive for a
family quarrel over her estate which
brings out all the narrowness and
meanness of lives which are absolute
ly self-centered jmd intolerant of
others. The black" sheep of the family
arrives at* the critical moment, and
proves, with the aid of a stranger in
the home, to be more worthy than the
rest.
Character Work
The evolution of a thoughtful, con
siderate, worth-while character from
an erstwhile vagabond, provides Phil
Urner, in the part of Ben Jordan, with
an opportunity for some of the best
character acting seen on the Stanford
stage. Hattie Mai Mixon, as Jane, the
outsider who lives the Jordan
family, gives a convincing portrayal
of a high-minded, generous and sweet
ly feminine girl.
Ella, played by Amy Case Peterson,
and Hannah, the maid of all work,
played by Lottiellen Johnson, are the
two most important comedy reliefs in
the play. Amy Case Peterson, in the
role of Ella, is never out of character,
and should prove to be one of the out
standing hits of the evening, with her
tempestuous declaration of her right
to buy "anything, even if it's a man,"
with the money she expects to get
from her mother's estate.
Comedy Roles
Lottiellen Johnson, as Hannah, the
plodding, sour-visaged old servant, has
one of the most important comedy
roles, and many of her speeches
should literally "bring down" the
house.
"Icebound" Is remarkable in that
subtle comedy and bits of dramatic in
tensity follow one another throughout.
The gamut of human emotions is run
during the three acts with laughs and
tears in almost equal numbers.
Sets and costumes for "Icebound"
are being planned and executed by
Gordon Davis' Theatrical Workshop
class, under the immediate direction
of Miss Chrysella Dunker, who has
been responsible for the successful
settings and costuming of so many
campus productions. Members of the
class are acting as stage hands, prop
erty men, wardrobe mistresses, and
other back stage people of importance.
Immediately following "Icebound,"
Gene Trago's orchestra will officiate
at the Women's Clubhouse at the usual
cast dance. Admission to the dance,
for those who attend the show, will
be fifty cents, the regular price of
seventy-five cents being charged all
others.

Immediately following "Icebound,"
Gene Trago's orchestra will officiate
at the Women's Clubhouse at the usual
cast dance. Admission to the dance,
for those who attend the show, will
be fifty cents, the regular price of
seventy-five cents being charged all
others.
mHE curtain will rise tomorrow night at 8:15 on "Icebound," the second of
*■ Gordon Davis' summer productions. Strenuous work on the part of the
cast during the past two weeks assures a well-rounded performance of the
play, which won the Pulitzer prize in 1922 for being the best American play
of the year.
The theme of "Icebound" concerns itself with a depiction of the characters
of country folk in a small North Maine town, and the way in which their
narrow, selfish natures react to a crisis. Owen Davis has evolved in this

j>play a remarkable series of character
delineations, which require more than
ordinary skill to enact.
Strong Cast
Each member of the cast, as chosen
by Gordon Davis, is admirably fitted
both physically and temperamentally
to take the part assigned to him, and
should evoke from the audience the
laughs and tears which are inter
woven throughout the action of the
play, in a decidedly professional man
ner. Rehearsals during the past week
have afforded Gordon Davis an oppor
tunity to smooth over and perfect the
dramatic and comedy moments with
which "Icebound" is plentifully sup
plied.
The death of the mother of a family
of grown children is the motive for a
family quarrel over her estate which
brings out all the narrowness and
meanness of lives which are absolute
ly self-centered jmd intolerant of
others. The black" sheep of the family
arrives at* the critical moment, and
proves, with the aid of a stranger in
the home, to be more worthy than the
rest.
Character Work
The evolution of a thoughtful, con
siderate, worth-while character from
an erstwhile vagabond, provides Phil
Urner, in the part of Ben Jordan, with
an opportunity for some of the best
character acting seen on the Stanford
stage. Hattie Mai Mixon, as Jane, the
outsider who lives the Jordan
family, gives a convincing portrayal
of a high-minded, generous and sweet
ly feminine girl.
Ella, played by Amy Case Peterson,
and Hannah, the maid of all work,
played by Lottiellen Johnson, are the
two most important comedy reliefs in
the play. Amy Case Peterson, in the
role of Ella, is never out of character,
and should prove to be one of the out
standing hits of the evening, with her
tempestuous declaration of her right
to buy "anything, even if it's a man,"
with the money she expects to get
from her mother's estate.
Comedy Roles
Lottiellen Johnson, as Hannah, the
plodding, sour-visaged old servant, has
one of the most important comedy
roles, and many of her speeches
should literally "bring down" the
house.
"Icebound" Is remarkable in that
subtle comedy and bits of dramatic in
tensity follow one another throughout.
The gamut of human emotions is run
during the three acts with laughs and
tears in almost equal numbers.
Sets and costumes for "Icebound"
are being planned and executed by
Gordon Davis' Theatrical Workshop
class, under the immediate direction
of Miss Chrysella Dunker, who has
been responsible for the successful
settings and costuming of so many
campus productions. Members of the
class are acting as stage hands, prop
erty men, wardrobe mistresses, and
other back stage people of importance.
