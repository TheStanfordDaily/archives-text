# STUDENT GIVES LIFE IN ATTEMPT TO SAVE BOY FROM TERRIBLE DEATH
## FRIENDS SEE TRAGEDY Sidney Walker Cole Fatally Injured in Mt. Rainier Avalanche 
### 
Giving his life to save another, Sid
ney Walker Cole, '25, met death in an
avalanche on the slopes of Mt. Ranier,
Friday, July 25. He had been attend
ing the summer R. O. T. C. camp at
Camp Lewis, Washington, which end
ed Wednesday, July 23. In company
with two Stanford classmates, Bert
Price and John Marble, he started on
a vacation trip to Canada, and they
decided to climb Mt. Rainier en route.
Having made a successful ascent
of the mountain, the party, which
numbered about thirty, started down
shortly after noon. A slight temblor
shook the slope and started an ava
lanche of rocks rolling down the side.
The party took refuge under an over
hanging ledge, and might have es
caped with only minor injuries but
for the heroism of Cole.
Saves Boy's Life
A small boy in the party, unaccus
tomed to mountain climbing, stood
outside the ledge, apparently spell
bound by the sight of the oncoming
rocks. Cole stepped out and pushed
him back into safety, but was hit on
the head by a large rock and carried
about twenty feet. It was several min
utes before the party could haul him
in, owing to the stream of rocks, and
he hung suspended by the life-line
over the cliff.
Marble hurried to the nearest ran
ger station and telephoned for a re
lief party, which got Cole to a hos
pital in Tacoma several hours after
the accident. He never recovered con
sciousness, and died two hours after
being brought to town.
Students Attend Funeral
A private funeral was held Tuesday
in Sacramento at the home of the
parents, and was attended by about a
dozen students from the campus. The
deceased was the son of Mr. and Mrs.
Orsamis Cole, Jr., and is survived by
a brother, William, a sophomore at the
University of California, and two sis
ters, Helen and Susan. His father is
traffic manager for the Sacramento
district of the Pacific Telephone &
Telegraph company.
Cole was active in social and student
body affairs, being junior baseball
manager last spring. He majored in
the economics department and was a
member of Sequoia club.
