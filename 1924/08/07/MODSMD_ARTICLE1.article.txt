# "OEDIPUS REX" CHORUS AND CAST REHEARSING ON STEPS OF MUSEUM
## COSTUMES ARE NOVEL Plans for Special Lighting, Scenic Effects Being Completed 
### 
The cast and chorus of "Oedipus
Rex" have started rehearsing on the
steps of the museum, where Stanford's
first attempt in the field of Greek
drama will be presented on the night
of August 15th.
Miss Thomas and Gordon Davis, the
directors, are rushing plans for the
special lighting effects and scenery, in
order to have ample time in which to j
rehearse under conditions which will
prevail the night of the production.
Hume West has arrived from South

system of lighting which will bring

Costumes Nearly Ready
Most of the costumes have been
finished by the members of the Thea
tre Workshop class, and are being
used in the rehearsals. Designs for
the costumes were brought to Stan
ford by Miss Thomas, who has pre
sented "Oedipus Rex" at the Univer
sity of California, Southern Branch,
in Los Angeles.
Seating arrangements have been
completed, and accommodations are
assured for 1500 people. Extensive ad
vertising seems to augur well for a
capacity audience, as many favorable
comments are being received from the
press of the region around Palo Alto
and San Francisco. The unprecedented
success of the oratorio, "Elijah," has
given the public confidence in the
ability of Stanford to give cultural en
tertainment of the best, and the pro
duction of "Oedipus Rex" seems al
ready assured of a warm reception.
Careful Coaching
Both Miss Thomas and Gordon
Davis are exerting every effort to
make this first attempt at Greek drama
a success. With a cast and chorus en
tirely unfamiliar with the method of
presenting a Greek drama, with the
exception of the two leads, who have
had previous experience, the matter
of coaching has required a great deal
of careful thought and planning. A
cast of seventy-five necessitates a
knowledge on the part of every mem
ber of how to act in unison, and with
attention to mass effects which will
not detract from the flowing move
ment of the play.
Seats for "Oedipus Rex" will be on
sale at Crandall's in Palo Alto, and at
the Administration building on the
campus. Boxes seating «ix may be re
served for $15.00.

The cast and chorus of "Oedipus
Rex" have started rehearsing on the
steps of the museum, where Stanford's
first attempt in the field of Greek
drama will be presented on the night
of August 15th.
Miss Thomas and Gordon Davis, the
directors, are rushing plans for the
special lighting effects and scenery, in
order to have ample time in which to j
rehearse under conditions which will
prevail the night of the production.
Hume West has arrived from South
ern California to take charge of the ]
electricians, and will devote his en
tire time to perfecting the intricate'
system of lighting which will bring
out all the beauty of the natural out-.

door theatre formed by the steps anil
collonades of the museum.
Costumes Nearly Ready
Most of the costumes have been
finished by the members of the Thea
tre Workshop class, and are being
used in the rehearsals. Designs for
the costumes were brought to Stan
ford by Miss Thomas, who has pre
sented "Oedipus Rex" at the Univer
sity of California, Southern Branch,
in Los Angeles.
Seating arrangements have been
completed, and accommodations are
assured for 1500 people. Extensive ad
vertising seems to augur well for a
capacity audience, as many favorable
comments are being received from the
press of the region around Palo Alto
and San Francisco. The unprecedented
success of the oratorio, "Elijah," has
given the public confidence in the
ability of Stanford to give cultural en
tertainment of the best, and the pro
duction of "Oedipus Rex" seems al
ready assured of a warm reception.
Careful Coaching
Both Miss Thomas and Gordon
Davis are exerting every effort to
make this first attempt at Greek drama
a success. With a cast and chorus en
tirely unfamiliar with the method of
presenting a Greek drama, with the
exception of the two leads, who have
had previous experience, the matter
of coaching has required a great deal
of careful thought and planning. A
cast of seventy-five necessitates a
knowledge on the part of every mem
ber of how to act in unison, and with
attention to mass effects which will
not detract from the flowing move
ment of the play.
