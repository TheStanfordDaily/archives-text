# C. H. Van Tyne Will Lecture on India
## 
### 
"Reminiscences of India and Ma
hatma Gandhi" will be the subject of
a lecture by C. H. Van Tyne of the
University of Michigan next Tuesday
evening at 7:30.
Professor Van Tyne, who is known
especially for his work on the Ameri
can Revolution, went to India as the
guest of Sir Frederick Whyte, a noted
British official of that country. It was
through this influence that he was able
to meet and interview Gandhi and
other Indian radicals. His book, "India
in Ferment," is a recital of many of
his experiences on the trip.
