# SECOND PRODUCTION OF DRAMA SEASON DRAWS ENTHUSIASTIC AUDIENCE
## MIXON, URNER, PLEASE "Icebound' Replete With Fine Character Portrayals; Comedy Is Good 
### Charles Simons 
"Icebound," as presented by Gordon
Davis and his Theatre Workshop last
Friday night, proved two things to
the satisfaction of the unusually large
audience which attended.
In the first place, Gordon Davis is
one of the best dramatic coaches that
any university can boast of, and his
ideas about summer productions have
more than proved their merit. A new
departure in Stanford dramatics, the
series of plays which Davis is pre
senting this summer have drawn as
good, if not better, houses than simi
lar types of dramatic effort have been
able to draw during the regular col
lege year.
Not only in choice or productions,

but in the selection of casts as well,|
has Davis shown rare judgment. "The!
Dover Road" started the season, andj
made such an impression that a good
house for "Icebound" was assured,
even before the tickct sale. Not con-!
tent with this first hit, Davis put. forth'
perhaps the most strenuous efforts of
his career to make "Icebound" even
more successful. That he attained his
objective was evidenced by the en-,
thusiastic. applause which made ne
cessary over a dozen curtain calls at
the end of the play.
"Icebound" culled for expert direc
tion, careful attention to detail, and
settings which would prove a good
background for the drab, common
place characters about whom the play
was written. Davis accomplished all
llitise things, and in addition present
ed one of the best-balanced casts ever
seen on the Assembly hall stage.
Cast Excellent
The cast of "Icebound" was the rea
son for the second "proof" of the
evening. A new note has been struck
in Stanford dramatics, and "Icebound"
was the best example so far, of that 1
note. It is that the term, "amateur
theatricals," can no longer be applied
to a Davis-coached Assembly hull pro
duction. A smoothness and finish
which is not often seen even in pro
ductions by an experienced stock com
pany were the outstanding features of
Friday night's play. A group of char
acters was portrayed so realistically,
and with such artistry, that the atten
tion of the audience was never di
verted from the reading of the lines,
by any touch of awkwardness or ama-1
teurishness which so often character
izes a student production.
Leads Well Portrayed
While the cast as a whole was well
nigh perfect, perhaps the most out
standing portrayals were given by
Hattie Mai Mixon, in the role of Jane,
and Philip Urner, as Ben Jordan.
"Miss Mixon was charmingly natural
in the role of the heroine, and her
splendid stage presence and natural
beauty helped her to make the most
out of a very appealing part. Her
ability to run the gamut of emotions,
from happiness to bitter sorrow,
marked her as an exceptionally fine
actress.
Phil Urner typified the handsome, 1
reckless, yet lovable "black sheep" of
the family, who finally comes into his
own through the help and love of
Jane. Both Urner and Miss Mixon dis
played an ease and naturalness in
their acting which made of the char
acters they portrayed, very real and
living beings. Their scene together
where Ben tells Jane of the "family in
France" was a splendid piece of v,;ork,
and held the closest attention of the
audience.
Holliday Pleases
Guy Holliday, as Henry Jordan, gave
a very realistic touch to his part, and
•was never out of character. The role
of Henry Jordan required an ability
to change from a mood of selfishness
and greed, to one of contrition and
remorse, and then back again, which
Holliday did in an admirable way. His
most effective work was done in the
first act, where he all but fights with
his brother, Ben, and then is stricken
with remorse at having made a dis
turbance while his mother is on her
deathbed.
Master James Kennedy, son of Pro

' fessor Kennedy, carried off the honors
of the evening from the standpoint of
comic effect. In spite of the fact that
this was his first experience on the
stage, he appeared to be perfectly at
ease, and read his lines without the
slightest hesitation. His role of Orin,
son of Sadie Jordan, called for quite
a bit of acting calculated to evoke
laughs, none of which missed fire.
Nettie Is Charming
Ruth Ackley, as Nettie, was pretty
| enough to win any man's heart, and
the way in which she called Ben Jor
dan's attention to. the fact that she
was now "grown up" was a very clever
bit of acting. As with the rest of the
cast, naturalness was her chief asset,
and this, coupled with her youth and
good looks, made a decided hit with
the audience.
Dorothy Thomas George and Amy
Case Peterson, as the two daughters
of the family, gave the audience sev
eral delicious moments of sheer com
edy. Mrs. George was at her best in
her tiffs with her son, Orin, displaying
to good advantage the experience she
j has gained on the professional stage.
Miss Peterson's tempestuous declara
tion of her desire to "buy anything,
, even if it's a man," almost stopped the
show, so well was it built up and de
livered.
Virginia Henderson, as Emma, wife

of Henry Jordan, who "married into"
the Jordans, did very well with a dif
ficult part. Although not called on for
many lines, she was on the stage most
of the time, which required keeping in
character by expressions alone.
Paul Fassoth as the judge, and Tom
Kleckner as the doctor, had the dignity
and bearing which their roles de
manded. Fassoth gave a touching por
trayal of the judge's love for Jane, and
his consequent renunciation of her
when he learns she is in love with
Ben. Kleckner's doctor had all the
mannerisms and quaintness of the
regular old country physician. Both
Fassoth and Kleckner had the appear
ance of their parts, and blended well
with the rest of the cast.
Lottiellen Johnson, as Hanna, the
morose, taciturn maid of all work, was
the motif for many laughs. Sarcastic
replies from a sour-visaged character
made one of the best comedy reliefs
of the play. Wayne Clark, in the role
of the deputy sheriff, handled a "mean"
pair of hand-cuffs, in a life-like man
ner.
"Icebound," as presented by Gordon

"Icebound," as presented by Gordon
Davis and his Theatre Workshop last
Friday night, proved two things to
the satisfaction of the unusually large
audience which attended.
In the first place, Gordon Davis is
one of the best dramatic coaches that
any university can boast of, and his
ideas about summer productions have
more than proved their merit. A new
departure in Stanford dramatics, the
series of plays which Davis is pre
senting this summer have drawn as
good, if not better, houses than simi
lar types of dramatic effort have been
able to draw during the regular col
lege year.
Not only in choice or productions,

but in the selection of casts as well,|
has Davis shown rare judgment. "The!
Dover Road" started the season, andj
made such an impression that a good
house for "Icebound" was assured,
even before the tickct sale. Not con-!
tent with this first hit, Davis put. forth'
perhaps the most strenuous efforts of
his career to make "Icebound" even
more successful. That he attained his
objective was evidenced by the en-,
thusiastic. applause which made ne
cessary over a dozen curtain calls at
the end of the play.
"Icebound" culled for expert direc
tion, careful attention to detail, and
settings which would prove a good
background for the drab, common
place characters about whom the play
was written. Davis accomplished all
llitise things, and in addition present
ed one of the best-balanced casts ever
seen on the Assembly hall stage.
Cast Excellent
The cast of "Icebound" was the rea
son for the second "proof" of the
evening. A new note has been struck
in Stanford dramatics, and "Icebound"
was the best example so far, of that 1
note. It is that the term, "amateur
theatricals," can no longer be applied
to a Davis-coached Assembly hull pro
duction. A smoothness and finish
which is not often seen even in pro
ductions by an experienced stock com
pany were the outstanding features of
Friday night's play. A group of char
acters was portrayed so realistically,
and with such artistry, that the atten
tion of the audience was never di
verted from the reading of the lines,
by any touch of awkwardness or ama-1
teurishness which so often character
izes a student production.
Leads Well Portrayed
While the cast as a whole was well
nigh perfect, perhaps the most out
standing portrayals were given by
Hattie Mai Mixon, in the role of Jane,
and Philip Urner, as Ben Jordan.
"Miss Mixon was charmingly natural
in the role of the heroine, and her
splendid stage presence and natural
beauty helped her to make the most
out of a very appealing part. Her
ability to run the gamut of emotions,
from happiness to bitter sorrow,
marked her as an exceptionally fine
actress.
Phil Urner typified the handsome, 1
reckless, yet lovable "black sheep" of
the family, who finally comes into his
own through the help and love of
Jane. Both Urner and Miss Mixon dis
played an ease and naturalness in
their acting which made of the char
acters they portrayed, very real and
living beings. Their scene together
where Ben tells Jane of the "family in
France" was a splendid piece of v,;ork,
and held the closest attention of the
audience.
Holliday Pleases
Guy Holliday, as Henry Jordan, gave
a very realistic touch to his part, and
•was never out of character. The role
of Henry Jordan required an ability
to change from a mood of selfishness
and greed, to one of contrition and
remorse, and then back again, which
Holliday did in an admirable way. His
most effective work was done in the
first act, where he all but fights with
his brother, Ben, and then is stricken
with remorse at having made a dis
turbance while his mother is on her
deathbed.
Master James Kennedy, son of Pro

' fessor Kennedy, carried off the honors
of the evening from the standpoint of
comic effect. In spite of the fact that
this was his first experience on the
stage, he appeared to be perfectly at
ease, and read his lines without the
slightest hesitation. His role of Orin,
son of Sadie Jordan, called for quite
a bit of acting calculated to evoke
laughs, none of which missed fire.
Nettie Is Charming
Ruth Ackley, as Nettie, was pretty
| enough to win any man's heart, and
the way in which she called Ben Jor
dan's attention to. the fact that she
was now "grown up" was a very clever
bit of acting. As with the rest of the
cast, naturalness was her chief asset,
and this, coupled with her youth and
good looks, made a decided hit with
the audience.
Dorothy Thomas George and Amy
Case Peterson, as the two daughters
of the family, gave the audience sev
eral delicious moments of sheer com
edy. Mrs. George was at her best in
her tiffs with her son, Orin, displaying
to good advantage the experience she
j has gained on the professional stage.
Miss Peterson's tempestuous declara
tion of her desire to "buy anything,
, even if it's a man," almost stopped the
show, so well was it built up and de
livered.
Virginia Henderson, as Emma, wife

of Henry Jordan, who "married into"
the Jordans, did very well with a dif
ficult part. Although not called on for
many lines, she was on the stage most
of the time, which required keeping in
character by expressions alone.
Paul Fassoth as the judge, and Tom
Kleckner as the doctor, had the dignity
and bearing which their roles de
manded. Fassoth gave a touching por
trayal of the judge's love for Jane, and
his consequent renunciation of her
when he learns she is in love with
Ben. Kleckner's doctor had all the
mannerisms and quaintness of the
regular old country physician. Both
Fassoth and Kleckner had the appear
ance of their parts, and blended well
with the rest of the cast.
Lottiellen Johnson, as Hanna, the
morose, taciturn maid of all work, was
the motif for many laughs. Sarcastic

manded. Fassoth gave a touching por
trayal of the judge's love for Jane, and
his consequent renunciation of her
when he learns she is in love with
Ben. Kleckner's doctor had all the
mannerisms and quaintness of the
regular old country physician. Both
Fassoth and Kleckner had the appear
ance of their parts, and blended well
with the rest of the cast.
Lottiellen Johnson, as Hanna, the
morose, taciturn maid of all work, was
the motif for many laughs. Sarcastic
replies from a sour-visaged character
made one of the best comedy reliefs
of the play. Wayne Clark, in the role
of the deputy sheriff, handled a "mean"
pair of hand-cuffs, in a life-like man
ner.
"Icebound," as presented by Gordon
Davis and his Theatre Workshop last
Friday night, proved two things to
the satisfaction of the unusually large
audience which attended.
In the first place, Gordon Davis is
one of the best dramatic coaches that
any university can boast of, and his
ideas about summer productions have
more than proved their merit. A new
departure in Stanford dramatics, the
series of plays which Davis is pre
senting this summer have drawn as
good, if not better, houses than simi
lar types of dramatic effort have been
able to draw during the regular col
lege year.
Not only in choice or productions,

but in the selection of casts as well,|
has Davis shown rare judgment. "The!
Dover Road" started the season, andj
made such an impression that a good
house for "Icebound" was assured,
even before the tickct sale. Not con-!
tent with this first hit, Davis put. forth'
perhaps the most strenuous efforts of
his career to make "Icebound" even
more successful. That he attained his
objective was evidenced by the en-,
thusiastic. applause which made ne
cessary over a dozen curtain calls at
the end of the play.
"Icebound" culled for expert direc
tion, careful attention to detail, and
settings which would prove a good
background for the drab, common
place characters about whom the play
was written. Davis accomplished all
llitise things, and in addition present
ed one of the best-balanced casts ever
seen on the Assembly hall stage.
Cast Excellent
The cast of "Icebound" was the rea
son for the second "proof" of the
evening. A new note has been struck
in Stanford dramatics, and "Icebound"
was the best example so far, of that 1
note. It is that the term, "amateur
theatricals," can no longer be applied
to a Davis-coached Assembly hull pro
duction. A smoothness and finish
which is not often seen even in pro
ductions by an experienced stock com
pany were the outstanding features of
Friday night's play. A group of char
acters was portrayed so realistically,
and with such artistry, that the atten
tion of the audience was never di
verted from the reading of the lines,
by any touch of awkwardness or ama-1
teurishness which so often character
izes a student production.
Leads Well Portrayed
While the cast as a whole was well
nigh perfect, perhaps the most out
standing portrayals were given by
Hattie Mai Mixon, in the role of Jane,
and Philip Urner, as Ben Jordan.
"Miss Mixon was charmingly natural
in the role of the heroine, and her
splendid stage presence and natural
beauty helped her to make the most
out of a very appealing part. Her
ability to run the gamut of emotions,
from happiness to bitter sorrow,
marked her as an exceptionally fine
actress.
Phil Urner typified the handsome, 1
reckless, yet lovable "black sheep" of
the family, who finally comes into his
own through the help and love of
Jane. Both Urner and Miss Mixon dis
played an ease and naturalness in
their acting which made of the char
acters they portrayed, very real and
living beings. Their scene together
where Ben tells Jane of the "family in
France" was a splendid piece of v,;ork,
and held the closest attention of the
audience.
Holliday Pleases
Guy Holliday, as Henry Jordan, gave
a very realistic touch to his part, and
•was never out of character. The role
of Henry Jordan required an ability
to change from a mood of selfishness
and greed, to one of contrition and
remorse, and then back again, which
Holliday did in an admirable way. His
most effective work was done in the
first act, where he all but fights with
his brother, Ben, and then is stricken
with remorse at having made a dis
turbance while his mother is on her
deathbed.
Master James Kennedy, son of Pro

' fessor Kennedy, carried off the honors
of the evening from the standpoint of
comic effect. In spite of the fact that
this was his first experience on the
stage, he appeared to be perfectly at
ease, and read his lines without the
slightest hesitation. His role of Orin,
son of Sadie Jordan, called for quite
a bit of acting calculated to evoke
laughs, none of which missed fire.
Nettie Is Charming
Ruth Ackley, as Nettie, was pretty
| enough to win any man's heart, and
the way in which she called Ben Jor
dan's attention to. the fact that she
was now "grown up" was a very clever
bit of acting. As with the rest of the
cast, naturalness was her chief asset,
and this, coupled with her youth and
good looks, made a decided hit with
the audience.
Dorothy Thomas George and Amy
Case Peterson, as the two daughters
of the family, gave the audience sev
eral delicious moments of sheer com
edy. Mrs. George was at her best in
her tiffs with her son, Orin, displaying
to good advantage the experience she
j has gained on the professional stage.
Miss Peterson's tempestuous declara
tion of her desire to "buy anything,
, even if it's a man," almost stopped the
show, so well was it built up and de
livered.
Virginia Henderson, as Emma, wife

of Henry Jordan, who "married into"
the Jordans, did very well with a dif
ficult part. Although not called on for
many lines, she was on the stage most
of the time, which required keeping in
character by expressions alone.
Paul Fassoth as the judge, and Tom
Kleckner as the doctor, had the dignity
and bearing which their roles de
manded. Fassoth gave a touching por
trayal of the judge's love for Jane, and
his consequent renunciation of her
when he learns she is in love with
Ben. Kleckner's doctor had all the
mannerisms and quaintness of the
regular old country physician. Both
