# SECOND PRODUCTION OF DRAMA SEASON DRAWS ENTHUSIASTIC AUDIENCE
## MIXON, URNER, PLEASE "Icebound' Replete With Fine Character Portrayals; Comedy Is Good 
### Charles Simons 
"Icebound," as presented by Gordon
Davis and his Theatre Workshop last
Friday night, proved two things to
the satisfaction of the unusually large
audience which attended.
In the first place, Gordon Davis is
one of the best dramatic coaches that
any university can boast of, and his
ideas about summer productions have
more than proved their merit. A new
departure in Stanford dramatics, the
series of plays which Davis is pre
senting this summer have drawn as
good, if not better, houses than simi
lar types of dramatic effort have been
able to draw during the regular col
lege year.
Not only in choice or productions,

but in the selection of casts as well,|
has Davis shown rare judgment. "The!
Dover Road" started the season, andj
made such an impression that a good
house for "Icebound" was assured,
even before the tickct sale. Not con-!
tent with this first hit, Davis put. forth'
perhaps the most strenuous efforts of
his career to make "Icebound" even
more successful. That he attained his
objective was evidenced by the en-,
thusiastic. applause which made ne
cessary over a dozen curtain calls at
the end of the play.
"Icebound" culled for expert direc
tion, careful attention to detail, and
settings which would prove a good
background for the drab, common
place characters about whom the play
was written. Davis accomplished all
llitise things, and in addition present
ed one of the best-balanced casts ever
seen on the Assembly hall stage.
Cast Excellent
The cast of "Icebound" was the rea
son for the second "proof" of the
evening. A new note has been struck
in Stanford dramatics, and "Icebound"
was the best example so far, of that 1
note. It is that the term, "amateur
theatricals," can no longer be applied
to a Davis-coached Assembly hull pro
duction. A smoothness and finish
which is not often seen even in pro
ductions by an experienced stock com
