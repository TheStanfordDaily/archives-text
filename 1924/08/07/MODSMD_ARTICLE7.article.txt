# 'STANFORD UNIVERSITY' IS PRESIDENT WILBUR'S SUBJECT IN ASSEMBLY
## RELATES EARLY HISTORY Speaker Declares Colony of 60,000 Students Could Be Housed Here 
### 
"Stanford is probably the one insti
tution with as much as 1500' acres of
campus and property amounting to
SO,OOO acres, enough room for a resi
dence University," declared Dr. Ray
Lyman Wilbur, president of the Uni
versity, in speaking before the student
body yesterday morning, on the sub
ject, "Stanford University."
"We could in a century or so have
a colony of 60,000 students and still be
able to house them on the grounds,"
he continued. "Our greatest asset is
the fact that we have practically all
the students and a majority of the
faculty living on the campus. But we
want quality in our accommodations,
not quantity. That is why we have de-

tided to expand at I lie top, not at the
bottom, where we would be rnerelj
competing with numerous institutions
in t lie state."
