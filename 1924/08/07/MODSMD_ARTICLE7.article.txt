# 'STANFORD UNIVERSITY' IS PRESIDENT WILBUR'S SUBJECT IN ASSEMBLY
## RELATES EARLY HISTORY Speaker Declares Colony of 60,000 Students Could Be Housed Here 
### 
"Stanford is probably the one insti
tution with as much as 1500' acres of
campus and property amounting to
SO,OOO acres, enough room for a resi
dence University," declared Dr. Ray
Lyman Wilbur, president of the Uni
versity, in speaking before the student
body yesterday morning, on the sub
ject, "Stanford University."
"We could in a century or so have
a colony of 60,000 students and still be
able to house them on the grounds,"
he continued. "Our greatest asset is
the fact that we have practically all
the students and a majority of the
faculty living on the campus. But we
want quality in our accommodations,
not quantity. That is why we have de-

tided to expand at I lie top, not at the
bottom, where we would be rnerelj
competing with numerous institutions
in t lie state."

tory of the founding of the University

these aims have been carried out in
the present administrative policy. He
mentioned the special research de
partments located at Stanford; the
Carnegie Food Research Institute, the
Hoover War Library, the Hopkins
Marine Station, the hospitals in San
Francisco, and several other depart
ments.

vately endowed makes it possible for
the Board of Trustees to try experi
ments, and to move faster than is pos
sible in state institutions," said Presi
dent Wilbur.
In telling of the early history of the
University, he declared that one of
the best things which ever happened
to Stanford was the hardships en
dured in the first years, asserting that
these built up loyalty and a co-opera
tive spirit, shown by the work of the
alumni in raising the First Million en
dowment fund.
