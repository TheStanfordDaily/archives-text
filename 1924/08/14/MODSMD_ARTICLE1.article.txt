# WARNER FACES SEVERE TEST IN FIRST SEASON AS STANFORD MENTOR
## SCHEDULE TO BE TOUGH Cardinal Eleven Will Meet Five Conference Teams; Big Game Nov. 22 
### Don Liebendorfer 
One glance at the Stanford football
schedule for this fall will serve to
prove that "Pop" Warner is to meet
a severe test in his first year of coach
ing on the Pacific Coast. "Pop's" Pitts
burg Panthers have always been noted,
however, for their willingness to take
on all comers, so the situation here
will probably hold no terrors for the
tamed grid mentor.
Warner is scheduled to arrive on the
Farm about the middle of September
and he will go to work immediately
with the opening of practice on Sep
tember 15. He will be assisted by
"Andy" Kerr, who will spend most of
his time with the backfield, and "Tiny"
Thornhill, whose duty it will be to
bolster up the line. H. W. David, for
the past year coach of wrestling and
tennis here, will also assist Warner,
taking charge of the Grays. H. M.
Sprague has been appointed to assist
"Husky" Hunt with the freshman
team.
Tough Schedule
The Cards will face a most formida
ble list of opponents during the com
ing season. They will play eight games,
on successive Saturdays, five of which
will be against Pacific Coast Confer
ence teams. Three of the five coher
ence games will be played away frr.m
home.
The first game is scheduled for the
Stanford stadium against Occidental
College, October 4. The little southern
institution offered but little opposivion
last year but reports from tha south
land indicate that a stronger team is
forthcoming. On October 11, the Olym
pic Club is slated to appear here. The
clubmen always have a good team a*vi
put up a good fight. They have a new
coach, "Babe" Hollingberry, who is ex
pected to put new life into them this
year. "Scotch" Campbell, captain a::d
star quarterback on last year's Cardi
nal eleven, will be in the lineun for the
Post street team.
Oregon, October 18
The Lemon Yellow gridders of Ore
gon, coming south on October 18, will
provide Warner's crew with its firs!
conference competition. The north
erners always give Stanford a good
battle and this game should be the
first test of the strengtn of the red
shirted squad. The following week,
the Cards hit the road for the first
time when they journey to Portland to
meet the dangerous Idaho eleven. Last
year, Idaho gave Stanford one of the
toughest battles of the season and the
Moscow institution is said to have a
mighty strong aggregation again this
year.
November 1, the Santa Clara Bron
chos will furnish the opposition here.
The Broncs have not been very strong
in the past few years but they are ex
pected to show something better this
season under their new coach. On No
vember 8, the Cardinal eleven goes to
Los Angeles to face "Gloomy Gus"
Henderson's Trojans. This will be
quite an assignment, inasmuch as many
critics say that U. S. C. will be the
"team to beat." The Cards are still
smarting from the last year's defeat at
the hands of the southerners and they
will be out for blood.
Montana "Dark Horse"
The last tussle before the Big Game
will be played here November 15 when
Warner's proteges meet Montana, the
baby member of the conference. Last
year Montana made a better showing
against Washington than did U. S. C.
and her freshmen were champions of
the Northwest Conference, so the
Grizzlies look like anything but a set
up.
Stanford and California will meet in
the California Memorial Stadium at
Berkeley November 22 in the annual
gridiron classic of the West. The Cards
have a long string of defeats, at the
hands of the Bruins, to avenge, and
they will be aiming at "Andy" Smith's
aggregation all year. The Bears will
not be weak, as some have predicted.
They will probably have a team just
as strong as any they have produced
since 1922.
