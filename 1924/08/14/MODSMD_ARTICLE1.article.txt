# WARNER FACES SEVERE TEST IN FIRST SEASON AS STANFORD MENTOR
## SCHEDULE TO BE TOUGH Cardinal Eleven Will Meet Five Conference Teams; Big Game Nov. 22 
### Don Liebendorfer 
One glance at the Stanford football
schedule for this fall will serve to
prove that "Pop" Warner is to meet
a severe test in his first year of coach
ing on the Pacific Coast. "Pop's" Pitts
burg Panthers have always been noted,
however, for their willingness to take
on all comers, so the situation here
will probably hold no terrors for the
tamed grid mentor.
Warner is scheduled to arrive on the
Farm about the middle of September
and he will go to work immediately
with the opening of practice on Sep
tember 15. He will be assisted by
"Andy" Kerr, who will spend most of
his time with the backfield, and "Tiny"
Thornhill, whose duty it will be to
bolster up the line. H. W. David, for
the past year coach of wrestling and
tennis here, will also assist Warner,
taking charge of the Grays. H. M.
Sprague has been appointed to assist
"Husky" Hunt with the freshman
team.
Tough Schedule
The Cards will face a most formida
ble list of opponents during the com
ing season. They will play eight games,
on successive Saturdays, five of which
will be against Pacific Coast Confer
ence teams. Three of the five coher
ence games will be played away frr.m
home.
The first game is scheduled for the
Stanford stadium against Occidental
College, October 4. The little southern
institution offered but little opposivion
last year but reports from tha south
land indicate that a stronger team is
forthcoming. On October 11, the Olym
pic Club is slated to appear here. The
clubmen always have a good team a*vi
put up a good fight. They have a new
coach, "Babe" Hollingberry, who is ex
pected to put new life into them this
year. "Scotch" Campbell, captain a::d
star quarterback on last year's Cardi
nal eleven, will be in the lineun for the
Post street team.
Oregon, October 18
The Lemon Yellow gridders of Ore
gon, coming south on October 18, will
provide Warner's crew with its firs!
conference competition. The north
erners always give Stanford a good
battle and this game should be the
first test of the strengtn of the red
shirted squad. The following week,
