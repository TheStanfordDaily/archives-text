With today's issue, Volume 65A of
the Daily Palo Alto goes to press for
the last time. Getting out a student
paper during the summer quarter is a
rather hard task and it would be im
possible without the help of self-sacri
ficins and enthusiastic student jour
nalists.
In this connection, the Daily Palo
Alto wishes to thank the following
students for invaluable help: Kathe
• rine Capell, Charles Simons, Ray Law,
Astrid Arnoldson, and Hulda Hoover.
These students have contributed to
the Daily Palo Alto, this summer, con
stantly, and have given unselfishly of
their time.
In the past eight weeks, the Daily
Palo Alto has attempted to serve the
best interests of the student body.
If this purpose has been accomplished,
the editor will fold up his portable
and retire with the knowledge that
his regime has not been a failure.
