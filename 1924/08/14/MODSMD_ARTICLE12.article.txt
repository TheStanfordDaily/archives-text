# CONGRATULATIONS

### 
At this time, the Daily Palo Alto
wishes to congratulate some of those
■who have done so much to make an
ordinarily dull quarter an enjoyable
one. To the Committee on Summer
Students, headed by Professor Cooper,
must go a great deal of credit. The
committee was created for an admir
able purpose and it has done its work
well.
Too much praise cannot be given
Gordon Davis who, through his class
in Theatre Workshop, has presented
two excellent plays. "The Dover Road"
and "Icebound" were fully up to the
'standard of play excellence set during
the regular year.
To you, Mr. Davis, the Daily Palo
Alto doffs its hat. May you always
meet with the same success with
which you have met at Stanford this
summer. We congratulate you on your
excellent work.
Also to Miss Evalyn Thomas, and
the multitude of others who have
worked so hard on "Oedipus Rex,"
must go a great deal of credit. The
Greek drama is an innovation at Stan
ford and the Daily Palo Alto hopes
that the production tomorrow night
meets with the success it so richly de
serves.
