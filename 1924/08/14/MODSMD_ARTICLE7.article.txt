# Benefit Dance Will Be Given for Convalescent Home Friday, Aug. 22
## 
### 
The Stanford Convalescent Home
will be the beneficiary of a dance
to be given Friday evening, August
22, at Toyon hail.
Lack of floor space has made it
necessary to limit t :ie number of
tickets sold to 90. This is equal to
the number of couples at the last
dance held at Toyon three weeks
ago. The tickets may be obtained
at the Bookstore on Friday.
Witmer's orchestra will provide
music for the ten dances, listed on
specially printed programs. Danc
ing will start promptly at 9 o'clock,
and will continue until 1, with light
refreshments served between the
dances.
The committee in charge of the
dance consists of McPherson, chair
man; Carlsmith, Lawson, Gordon,
and Watterson.
