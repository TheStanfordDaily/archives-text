# LIVING CONDITIONS IN INDIA DESCRIBED BY C. H. VAN TYNE
## 
### 
Maliatma Gandhi is at first sight
very disappointing, according to Pro
fessor Claude H. Van Tyne of the
University of Michigan, who spoke on
"Reminiscences of India and Mahatma
Gandhi" in the Little Theatre Tuesday
evening. Professor Van Tyne met the
Hindu leader two years ago, while
visiting India as the guest of the
British Government.
He was especially invited by Alex
ander Frederick White, at that time
president of the legislative assembly
at Delhi, to make a study of condi
tions there, and every possible door
was opened for him. He met all the
leading Indians, and talked to them
about the situation.
Met Mahatma Gandhi
His meeting with Mahatma Gandhi
took place at the latter's tent at the
All-Indian National Congress. The
leader's tent, he said, was surrounded
by a mob of enthusiasts, who shouted
all the time for Gandhi. Professor
Van Tyne himself was received in the
tent. His first glimpse of Gandhi, he
said, came as the great leader ap
proached the tent in a Ford car.
He was a little, emaciated man,
clad in a loin-cloth, and not at all
prepossessing. As soon as he began to
talk, however, he was discovered to
be a charming talker, captivatingly
idealistic, but entirely unpractical. His
idea was to disregard the presence of
the British entirely, and to use soul
force rather than coercion. He was
gentle, sweet, charitable. Those who
oppose him politically love him, Pro
fessor Van Tyne says.
Prisons Well-Kept
Speaking of the prisons, which he
visited, Professor Van Tyne says that
they are remarkably well-kept, and
that the awful tales told of them are
exaggerated. Other public institutions
are also well-kept, according to his
observations.
Professor Van Tyne described the
luxury in which the Indian princes
live, surrounded on all sides by pov
erty and dirt. He told especially of
the Maharajah's tent, which follows
him all about his province, and is
gorgeously furnished. He said that the
princes realize that their great wealth
is possible only under the British sys
tem, as wars would arise without the
protection afforded by the English.
The princes talk in the most exalted
way against the British, but really
support them.
Caste All-Important
There are many possibilities for
struggles if India were free. The caste j
is all-importaut. This is a thing that 1
must be done away with. There may '
be trouble in Bengal. The Hindu and |
the Mohammedan come to blows at
every turn. Loosed, all the rival fac
tions in India would fight till death.
The British are gradually straighten
ing out matters. It will take much time
and that is what the Hindu can not
understand. He wants freedom now.
If the British retain their hold on
India they can work out the best
scheme of affairs.
"The British can solve the problem
wiselyâ€”and make India a self-ruling
member of the British Commonwealth
of Nations," said the speaker.

The "Honor System" is employed in
a penitentiary in Vienna, and is said
to work. Charity sisters are in charge.
