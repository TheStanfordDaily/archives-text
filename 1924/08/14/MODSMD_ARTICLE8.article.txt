# LIVING CONDITIONS IN INDIA DESCRIBED BY C. H. VAN TYNE
## 
### 
Maliatma Gandhi is at first sight
very disappointing, according to Pro
fessor Claude H. Van Tyne of the
University of Michigan, who spoke on
"Reminiscences of India and Mahatma
Gandhi" in the Little Theatre Tuesday
evening. Professor Van Tyne met the
Hindu leader two years ago, while
visiting India as the guest of the
British Government.
He was especially invited by Alex
ander Frederick White, at that time
president of the legislative assembly
at Delhi, to make a study of condi
tions there, and every possible door
was opened for him. He met all the
leading Indians, and talked to them
about the situation.
Met Mahatma Gandhi
His meeting with Mahatma Gandhi
took place at the latter's tent at the
All-Indian National Congress. The
leader's tent, he said, was surrounded
by a mob of enthusiasts, who shouted
all the time for Gandhi. Professor
Van Tyne himself was received in the
tent. His first glimpse of Gandhi, he
said, came as the great leader ap

exaggerated. Other public institutions
are also well-kept, according to his
observations.
Professor Van Tyne described the
luxury in which the Indian princes
live, surrounded on all sides by pov
erty and dirt. He told especially of
the Maharajah's tent, which follows
him all about his province, and is
gorgeously furnished. He said that the
princes realize that their great wealth
is possible only under the British sys
tem, as wars would arise without the
protection afforded by the English.
The princes talk in the most exalted
way against the British, but really
support them.
Caste All-Important
There are many possibilities for
struggles if India were free. The caste j
is all-importaut. This is a thing that 1
must be done away with. There may '
be trouble in Bengal. The Hindu and |
