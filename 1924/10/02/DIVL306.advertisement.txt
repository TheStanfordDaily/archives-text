if'or Young Men
There is nothing like a
STETSON
UTMOST y° un & men today
know the importance of
$ looking fit. Good ap
pearance counts much
in the game of life. The young
man who dresses with taste has
a decided advantage.
But—it is surprising how little
thought the average man gives
to his hat. It is his crown, yet he
seems to stop dressing at the neck.
Be careful in your selection of
your headwear. When you buy a
hat, select a Stetson. Its style is
right, its quality means long wear.
