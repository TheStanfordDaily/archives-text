# CARD FRESHMEN HEAVIEST TEAM IN MANY YEARS
## Yearlings Wallop Team of U. S. S. Colorado 45 to 0 In Season Opener 
### 
Material for this year's freshman
football team, while not so promising
as that of last year's eleven, is rapidly
rounding into shape. "Husky" Hunt,
coach of the tirst-year men, states that
the trosh are heavier than last year's
but not as experienced. In scrimmage
with the varsity Tuesday afternoon
they showed up well.
The "babes" began the 11>24 season
with an overwhelming and trouncing
4") to 0, victory over the U. S. S. Colo

game the line averaged IS7 pounds
and the backtield 168. This makes the

almost 60 yards, and he hits hard and

Arizona.
Hoffman, who played for Petaluma
high school, is also out for the full
back position. He needs experience,
hits too high, and is not as consistent
with his punts as Millage.
Hill, halfback from Long Beach. is
fast, shifty, and follows his interfer
ence. He is rather light, however,
weighing less than 160.
Altaffer, from Kiskec, Pennsyl
vania, is also out for half. He is a
southpaw kicker, and, next to Millage,
is getting his punts off the best. An
injury to his shoulder has kept him
out of practice.
Murphy a Good Quarter
Murphy, Berkeley, seems to be the
best bet for quarter. He is lighT. but
is a tighter and has a good head.
Clark, of Pasadena, and Baker are
