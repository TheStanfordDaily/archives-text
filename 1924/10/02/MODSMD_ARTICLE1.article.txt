# CARD FRESHMEN HEAVIEST TEAM IN MANY YEARS
## Yearlings Wallop Team of U. S. S. Colorado 45 to 0 In Season Opener 
### 
Material for this year's freshman
football team, while not so promising
as that of last year's eleven, is rapidly
rounding into shape. "Husky" Hunt,
coach of the tirst-year men, states that
the trosh are heavier than last year's
but not as experienced. In scrimmage
with the varsity Tuesday afternoon
they showed up well.
The "babes" began the 11>24 season
with an overwhelming and trouncing
4") to 0, victory over the U. S. S. Colo
rado eleven in the Stadium last Sat
urday afternoon. At the start of the
game the line averaged IS7 pounds
and the backtield 168. This makes the
toiiui average just a little under 180
pounds.
Millage a Star
Probably the most outstanding back
tield man is Millage. He has recently
been shifted from halfback to fullback,
and no <}ouht will do most of Hie kick
ing for the eleven. His punts average
almost 60 yards, and he hits hard and
low. Millage comes from Phoenix,
Arizona.
Hoffman, who played for Petaluma
high school, is also out for the full
back position. He needs experience,
hits too high, and is not as consistent
with his punts as Millage.
Hill, halfback from Long Beach. is
fast, shifty, and follows his interfer
ence. He is rather light, however,
weighing less than 160.
Altaffer, from Kiskec, Pennsyl
vania, is also out for half. He is a
southpaw kicker, and, next to Millage,
is getting his punts off the best. An
injury to his shoulder has kept him
out of practice.
Murphy a Good Quarter
Murphy, Berkeley, seems to be the
best bet for quarter. He is lighT. but
is a tighter and has a good head.
Clark, of Pasadena, and Baker are
also trying for the quarterback posi
tion. Clark is heavier than Murphy.
For center are Dorcy and Mustain.
Mustain began the game against the
sailors. However, Dorcy is a hard
lighter and, although somewhat green,
is making a bid for center. Mustain is
from El Paso, Texas, and Dorcy is
I'iom Santa Cruz.
Biglow, Pest at Guards
Biglow and Post are holding down
the guard positions. Biglow, from Pot
ter high school in San Francisco, is
the biggest man on the team. His
weight is 207 pounds. Post, from Santa
Cruz, weighs between 180 and 185, and
is fast. Potts is also doing good work,
but has been handicapped by a bum
shoulder and hand.
The tackles are Robesky, from
Bakersfield, and Everett, of Berkeley.
Robesky showed up well in scrimmage
with the varsity. Everett, who was a
good fullback, has been made over
into a linesman.
The frosh have a wealth of excellent
material for end. Dennis, Los Angeles
high star and all-southern end, is
down under punts fast, and tackles
hard and sure. It is almost impossible
to take him out of play. Davidson,
from Analy, is fast and knows football.
Issel, who has been made over from
a tackle, created a sensation in the
second day of practice when he broke
a new tackling dummy in two. Mont
gomery, Lodi, comes with a good
reputation, and is one of the hardest
working men on the team.

with an overwhelming and trouncing
4") to 0, victory over the U. S. S. Colo
rado eleven in the Stadium last Sat
urday afternoon. At the start of the
game the line averaged IS7 pounds
and the backtield 168. This makes the
toiiui average just a little under 180
pounds.
Millage a Star
Probably the most outstanding back
tield man is Millage. He has recently
been shifted from halfback to fullback,
and no <}ouht will do most of Hie kick
ing for the eleven. His punts average
almost 60 yards, and he hits hard and
low. Millage comes from Phoenix,
Arizona.
Hoffman, who played for Petaluma
high school, is also out for the full
back position. He needs experience,
hits too high, and is not as consistent
with his punts as Millage.
Hill, halfback from Long Beach. is
fast, shifty, and follows his interfer
ence. He is rather light, however,
weighing less than 160.
Altaffer, from Kiskec, Pennsyl
vania, is also out for half. He is a
southpaw kicker, and, next to Millage,
is getting his punts off the best. An
injury to his shoulder has kept him
out of practice.
Murphy a Good Quarter
Murphy, Berkeley, seems to be the
best bet for quarter. He is lighT. but
is a tighter and has a good head.
Clark, of Pasadena, and Baker are
also trying for the quarterback posi
tion. Clark is heavier than Murphy.
For center are Dorcy and Mustain.
Mustain began the game against the
sailors. However, Dorcy is a hard
lighter and, although somewhat green,
is making a bid for center. Mustain is
from El Paso, Texas, and Dorcy is
I'iom Santa Cruz.
Biglow, Pest at Guards
Biglow and Post are holding down
the guard positions. Biglow, from Pot
ter high school in San Francisco, is
the biggest man on the team. His
weight is 207 pounds. Post, from Santa
Cruz, weighs between 180 and 185, and
is fast. Potts is also doing good work,
but has been handicapped by a bum
shoulder and hand.
The tackles are Robesky, from
Bakersfield, and Everett, of Berkeley.
Robesky showed up well in scrimmage
with the varsity. Everett, who was a
good fullback, has been made over
into a linesman.
The frosh have a wealth of excellent
material for end. Dennis, Los Angeles
high star and all-southern end, is
down under punts fast, and tackles
hard and sure. It is almost impossible
to take him out of play. Davidson,
from Analy, is fast and knows football.
Issel, who has been made over from
a tackle, created a sensation in the
second day of practice when he broke
a new tackling dummy in two. Mont
gomery, Lodi, comes with a good
reputation, and is one of the hardest
working men on the team.
Material for this year's freshman
football team, while not so promising
as that of last year's eleven, is rapidly
rounding into shape. "Husky" Hunt,
coach of the tirst-year men, states that
the trosh are heavier than last year's
but not as experienced. In scrimmage
with the varsity Tuesday afternoon
they showed up well.
The "babes" began the 11>24 season
with an overwhelming and trouncing
4") to 0, victory over the U. S. S. Colo
