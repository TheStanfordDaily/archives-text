# After Six Months, Score Of Stanford-California Track Meet Is Changed
## 
### 
Nearly six months after the Big
Meet the tinal score of the classic
between California and Stanford has
been, decided at 82 .to 49. instead of
83 to 48.
Elmer Elliott, of Stanford, who ran
under protest, was declared ineligible
and his one point which he made in
the mile run was credited to Jack
Ross of California, who is now the
possessor of a Big "C."
This brings up a complication be
tween the students who won the
"lluessing Contest" conducted by the
Daily Palo Alto, and won by "Pinky"
Bell with a score of 8:! to 48. The
Daily Palo Alto assumes no responsi
bility for feuds.
