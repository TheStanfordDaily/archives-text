# ROBLE ORGANIZES NEW MANAGEMENT
## Student Committee to Assist Dietitian in Direction Of Dining Halls 
### 
A new system of*management, much
like that in vise at Encina, will be
inaugurated at Roble hall this quarter,
since Miss Gertrude Gardiner, who has
been in charge for a number of years,
has retired.
The must radical change in the hall
will be made in the direction of the
dining room. The committee of five
students, which is elected by the mem
bers of Roble Club, and has hud charge
of social affairs, will also act in mat
ters concerning the running of the
dining room. They will work with
Miss Lillian Otto, house director, who
will be on Miss Handy's staff. Miss
Otto is a graduate of Washington
State College, and received her train
ing in dietetics at Cook County Hos
pital, in Chicago. She was assistant
director of Halls and Commons, which
corresponds to the Stanford Union at
the University of Wisconsin, and has
had experience as dietitian in New-
York.
The social management of the hall
will be under the direction of Mrs.
Mary H. Stearns, who is to be on
Dean Yost's staff in working with the
University. Mrs. Stearns has been a
house mother on the University of
Oregon campus for some time and last
year was head resident at Susan
Campbell hall, women's dormitory,
there.
Katherine Beswick, secretary to the
Dean of Women, will live at Roble,
acting as assistant social director, in
addition to her duties in Miss Yost's
office.
First Month's Board Fixed
A fixed board will be charged the
Ruble women for the first month. At
the end of that time, if any changes
are desired, the committee of five will
have power, in conjunction with Miss
Otto, to lower the expenses, or to
raise the board and improve the din
ing room service, according to the
wishes of the students in the hall. In
making changes the only restrictions
imposed will he to keep the diet in
accordance with the best interests of
the health of the women.
The University has enlarged and
renovated the kitchen over the sum
mer. and has refurnished the office of
the social director.
No graduate women will be permit
ted to live in Roble this year on ac
count of congested conditions in the
hall. Although no more than the pre
scribed 500 women will be registered,
a greater number of underclass women
than usual have asked to live in the
hull.
Manzanita hall will be open again
this fall for graduate women, contrary
to plans made last spring to abandon
it for the present. Fifteen women can
be accommodated in this hall, and
MadroOa will hold most of the other
graduate women
