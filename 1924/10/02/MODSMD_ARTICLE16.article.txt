# CARD VARSITY OPENS SEASON AGAINST OCCIDENTAL SATURDAY
## Stanford Slated To Defeat Tiger Eleven With Ease; Solomon To Take Nevers' Place At Full 
### 
WHERE is hurried commotion and heated anticipation on the Stanford
campus; for there are those who claim that a barbecue will be served in
the California stadium this year for the special benefit of the Cardinal rooting
section. Those who are hounds for fanciuess and novelty add breathlessly that
it will consist entirely of bear meat.
However, it might be well to add to these enthusiasts that the first thing is
to catch the Bear. It is true that old Bruin emerged somewhat ruffled from
his winter's nap. but he still seems to have that old habit of winning, no
matter if the scores be somewhat reduced.
"Pop" Warner, in person, has been preparing his barbecue squad for the
better part of two weeks, pointing out the particulars of the different cuts
and how the fur should be ruffled, and he intends to N't the gang loose on

Occidental College in the Stadium
next Saturday to see how they shape
up.
The injury of Ernie Nevers in the
recent game between Stanford and
the combined competition of the U.
S. S. Nevada and Mississippi, which
Stanford won IVA to 0, has left the
"Old Fox" somewhat up in the air as
to fullback material. Solomon has
been shifted to Nevers' position and
Mitchell in turn took Solomon's berth
at quarterback.
Although Occidental promises to
bring a likely looking squad from the
south to clash against the Cards there
is hardly any doubt but that the Stan
ford team can easily swamp the Los
Angeles eleven by a fairly convincing
score.
Wealth of Material
It has been a long time since Stan
ford actually had the material on the
field compared with this season's
showing. Weight is the most outstand
ing asset that can be attributed to the
Cardinal pig-skinnersâ€”weight together
with confidence, and "Pop" Warner.
Warner is not handing out any ad
vance optimism to those who are
looking forward to a Bear barbecue,
but he claims to be willing to assume
the role of chief barbecuer.
Captain Jim Lawsou, playing at.
end, appears to have a strangle hold
on one of the end positions, and Art.
Thomas has a strong foothold at the
other extremity of the line. "Chuck"
Johnston and Harry Shipkey are. at
present, enjoying the exi lusiveness of
the varsity tackle positions, while
Fred Swan and Bill Neill are favorites
at the guard berths. George Baker is
practically a certainty at center. In
the hackfiehl Warner has been playing
Solomon at quarterback and fullback.
Mitchell, quarterback; Cleaveland,
Wheat and Cuddeback, halfbacks; and
Nevers at full.
