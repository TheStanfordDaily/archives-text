It was at Chautauqua, N. Y., in the summer of 18 ( )0 or 1891—before
either of us had gone to college—that I first met Raymond Alden.
There were two things about him then that I still remember: he was so
diffident that he either would not or could not throw himself naturally
into the fun that the rest of us were having; and he was a rewarding
fellow to know when once you got past the barriers and knew him. 1 did
not come to know him at all well at that time; he seemed to want to get
acquainted, but he could not quite let himself go.
There was something of this same diffidence about him and the same
desire for comradeship when 1 became his colleague at Stanford some
fifteen years later. To a large extent lie outgrew his natural reserve, and
more and more the people with whom he was thrown in contact came to
feel the warmth of his friendship, the glow of his affection. Respect
lie always commanded, from everyone who knew him; but love for him
was a thing that grew slowly, though surely, as one came to realize more
and more the fineness of his nature, its soundness, its sweetness.
The tenderness and charm and fancy which went into his stories for
children made these particularly appealing. Alden wrote from time to
time graceful and sometimes beautiful verses, but more often he chose
this medium for his humor. ]J is humor was genial and sunny, bland
and not barbed, rippling not bitter. 1 never knew him to sneer, lie
loved the sunshine. But for all his tolerance he saw clearly, and was
never deceived by bombast and sham.
That is why he made his widest appeal as a critic. His personal
lightness, his keen sense of justice, his unclouded mind, enabled him to
tell the truth about literature; and the fineness of his appreciation gave
his critical work a very high value. And in his books and special articles
we have always the same broad outlook, an unfailing appreciation of
the best, and a friendly understanding of his fellow critics. Ilis judg
ment was never warped, never biased.
1 hese writings have made a substantial addition to the world's fund
of knowledge; but we who were with him, who felt his personality as
we feel the sunshine, we have had a finer and a richer gift than we can
tell of. \\ e have been close to a beautiful and a noble nature, and the
effect of that, deep down in us, can never be lost. —11. D. G.
