The three summer months have passed, for better or worse, and the
academic year yawns before us. There is something about Stanford—
the sophomores know it and the freshmen will soon discover it—some
thing that more or less takes hold of the individual and appeals to his
l etter side, however unwillingly the individual may submit to it. Stanford
influences extend to unusual length; for four years it is "home ' and
after tour years it seems a hard place to leave. Stanford men and women
frequently refuse to depart, and settle down in various capacities to earn
a living without forsaking the rugged beauty of the Quad, and the
sometimes peaceful beauty of campus life. There is something permanent
about Stanford associations.
i hose who have been here before are sufficiently glad to return. The
freshmen who registered yesterday, and the others who will finish up
today, are possibly so befogged by a tine large set of first impressions
that they have little certainty as to whether Stanford is desirable or not.
Jo these, let it be said that no matter what their decisions may be at the
end of a month, long before the close of the year they will be unanimously
behind backing up—in favor of, the University and all things Stanford.
Petty squabbles there may be, but under the system of (to a large extent)
student government. Stanford can practically do no wrong, unless the
student does it himself! Think that over.
Stanford is looking ahead—very definitely for thirty years, and more
broadly into the indefinite future. Part of her aim is to tempt her
students to look ahead, and in that way benefit themselves, and her. It
is. then, to a progressive fellowship that Stanford welccflnes us all. The
I niversity does not conduct an intellectual blacksmith shop, wherein
sound knowledge is beaten into unsound domes, but rather is operated
on the cafeteria system. The learning is here—come and get it, vou that
want to learn.
