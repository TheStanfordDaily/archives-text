# Bayley and Simons Give "Radio Robot" on Orpheum
## 
### 
Arnold Bayley and Charles Simons
played a two-week engagement on the
Orpheum Vaudeville circuit during the
summer, in Bavley's one-act skit called
"The Radio Robot."
Although newcomers in big-time
vaudeville, the two campus actors
made a distinct hit, and received fa
'vorable notices in both Los Angeles
and San Francisco. The Los Angeles
engagement at the regular Orpheum
Theatre was the scene of their second
week's effort.
Bayley is awaiting the arival of a
forty-week contract on the Orpheum
circuit, while Simons has returned to
college.

Every girl must dress In a heavy
coat and shoes, and carry a towel
every time a fire-drill occurs at the
girls' dormitory at Allegheny College,
Meadville, Pennsylvania. Six minutes
is the record time for leaving the hall.
