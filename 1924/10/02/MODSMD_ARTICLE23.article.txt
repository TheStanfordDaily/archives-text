# 1924 FOOTBALL ROLES TO MAKE GAME SAFER
## 
### 
Several changes have been made in
the 1924 football rulings which, ac
cording to the Rules Committee, will
make the game much safer, Injuries
will be relatively fewer, and less seri
ous. The changes are as follows:
In Rule 1, Section 3, the Committee
has added its approval to the so-called
'•offset" goal posts so that either
straight-line posts or offsets are legal.
In Rule 3, Section 3, there is an
answer to the generally increasing
complaint that certain stiff shoulder
guards ahd protectors were dangerous.
The Committee has legislated that
shoulder guards must be padded out
side as well as inside and cleats must
not be dangerously sharp, and has
urged all officials to enforce relent
lessly every phase of the rule relating
to equipment.
Under Rule 6 comes the elimination
of tees. All tees are swept out of
existence, but on place-kick a player
may hold the ball on the ground for
the kicker. The ball is now kicked off
from the middle of the field instead
of the 40-yard line. Section 9 has been
altered so that any part of the player's
person being out of bounds counts just
the same as the foot.
Under Rule 9 the Committee has
practically placed shift plays in the
hands of officials by legislating that
players must come to an absolute stop
and remain stationary in their new
positions sufficiently long to prevent
any doubt in the minds of the officials
as to the legality of the play.
Rule 10 —The five-yard line has been
changed to the three-yard line in try
ing for the extra point after touch
down.
Rule 14 is the evidence of the Com
mittee's desire to speed up the game
and prevent unnecessary and unrea
sonable delays. The official may arbi
trarily call time whenever he thinks
a team is unreasonably delaying put
ting the ball in play, and may warn
or penalize them. In the case of calling
of time for substitutions or for other
reasons, which appear to the official
to be with the intent of lengthening
the game, he may instruct the time
keeper not to stop the watch but to let
time run on. Captains may now ask
that time be called four times in each
half, but the penalty for a greater
number of requests has been increased
to five yards.
In Rule 16 the screening of the for
ward pass has been checked by the
ruling that ineligible players must
keep out of the way of the players
of the side which did not make the
pass else they are liable to a penalty
for interfering with the defensive
side's opportunity to reach the ball.
Rule 17 puts a stop to the receiver
of the forward pass running out of
bounds and then coming back into
the field of play to receive the pass.
Under this same rule the last ten
yard penalty remaining in the book
has been changed to 15 yards, namely:
intentionally throwing a forward pass
to the ground. It has been made legal
to decline the penalty on a forward
pass.
Rule IS finishes up the entire mat
ter relating to on-side kicks. If a
kicked ball crosses the scrimmage line
no one of the kicker's side can touch
or recover the ball until it has touched
an opponent, but any man may re
cover the ball when it has touched an
opponent, but any man may recover
a kicked ball which has not crossed
the line of scrimmage.
Under Rule 23, Section 8, a foul
committed behind the goal line which
does not involve change of possession
of the ball is penalized one-half the
distance to the goal line from the spot
where the ball was put in play. Sec
tion 11 has been expanded by the in
struction to the referee that he shall
explain alternative penalties to the
captain of the offended team.

answer to the generally increasing
complaint that certain stiff shoulder
guards ahd protectors were dangerous.
The Committee has legislated that
shoulder guards must be padded out
side as well as inside and cleats must
not be dangerously sharp, and has
urged all officials to enforce relent
lessly every phase of the rule relating
to equipment.
Under Rule 6 comes the elimination
of tees. All tees are swept out of
existence, but on place-kick a player
may hold the ball on the ground for
the kicker. The ball is now kicked off
from the middle of the field instead
of the 40-yard line. Section 9 has been
altered so that any part of the player's
person being out of bounds counts just
the same as the foot.
Under Rule 9 the Committee has
practically placed shift plays in the
hands of officials by legislating that
players must come to an absolute stop
and remain stationary in their new
positions sufficiently long to prevent
any doubt in the minds of the officials
as to the legality of the play.
Rule 10 —The five-yard line has been
changed to the three-yard line in try
ing for the extra point after touch
down.
Rule 14 is the evidence of the Com
mittee's desire to speed up the game
and prevent unnecessary and unrea
sonable delays. The official may arbi
trarily call time whenever he thinks
a team is unreasonably delaying put
ting the ball in play, and may warn
or penalize them. In the case of calling
of time for substitutions or for other
reasons, which appear to the official
to be with the intent of lengthening
the game, he may instruct the time
keeper not to stop the watch but to let
time run on. Captains may now ask
that time be called four times in each
half, but the penalty for a greater
number of requests has been increased
to five yards.
In Rule 16 the screening of the for
ward pass has been checked by the
ruling that ineligible players must
keep out of the way of the players
of the side which did not make the
pass else they are liable to a penalty
for interfering with the defensive
side's opportunity to reach the ball.
Rule 17 puts a stop to the receiver
of the forward pass running out of
bounds and then coming back into
the field of play to receive the pass.
Under this same rule the last ten
yard penalty remaining in the book
has been changed to 15 yards, namely:
intentionally throwing a forward pass
to the ground. It has been made legal
to decline the penalty on a forward
pass.
Rule IS finishes up the entire mat
ter relating to on-side kicks. If a
kicked ball crosses the scrimmage line
no one of the kicker's side can touch
or recover the ball until it has touched
an opponent, but any man may re
cover the ball when it has touched an
opponent, but any man may recover
a kicked ball which has not crossed
the line of scrimmage.
Under Rule 23, Section 8, a foul
committed behind the goal line which
does not involve change of possession
of the ball is penalized one-half the
distance to the goal line from the spot
where the ball was put in play. Sec
tion 11 has been expanded by the in
struction to the referee that he shall
explain alternative penalties to the
captain of the offended team.

Several changes have been made in
the 1924 football rulings which, ac

In Rule 1, Section 3, the Committee
