# FRESHMAN DEBATING SQUAD TO BE FORMED EARLY THIS QUARTER
## 
### 
I Freshmen interested in debating have
I been asked by Bert Levit, freshman de
-1 bating coach, to begin preparing for the
tryouts that are to be held Thursday,
October 9. Each tryoutee will be re
' quired to give a five-minute main speech
and three minutes rebuttal on the sub
ject: Resolved, That Coolidge should be
elected President of the United States.
Those chosen at the time of the try
outs will be given a place on the fresh
man squad, which is to be organized im
mediately. The squad will be kept in
form by practice debates throughout the
quarter. This is a change over the old
i system of not organizing until the winter
i quarter, and according to l.cvit, is ex
, pected to bring out more talent and to
arouse more interest than before.
In this manner it will be possible to
try to arrange the College of the Pacific
debate this quarter and clear the way for

a dual debate with California freshmen
during the winter quarter. This will dis
place the old annual tri-angular, and
should increase tie importance of the
debate with the California babes.
Freshmen women are especially urged
to tryout. for in the past two years no
women have even tried to make the squad

and this is one of the few activities in
which freshmen women may participate.
The time and place of tryouts have
not yet been decided, but Coach Levit
strongly urges freshmen men and women
to pegin work at once preparing for
them.
