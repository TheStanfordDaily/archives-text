# INTRAMURAL ATHLETICS STRESSED MORE THIS YEAR
## Warner Praises System Bringing All Men Out For Athletic Activities 
### Charles Simons 
Intramural athletics will be stressed
this year more than ever before, ac
cording to reports from the office of
Dr. W. H. Barrow, director of physical
education and athletics. In recogni
tion of the value of intramural sports
to the health of the students, the In
tramural office at Encina gymnasium
has been working out a schedule of
contests, which will afford every man
in the University an opportunity to
participate in some sport in competi
tion with others.
Stanford is in the unique position
of having given more thought and care
to the development of intramural ath
letics than most other colleges in the
country. This has been made possible
by having ample ground space to de
vote to athletic fields, and to the more
important factor of having men at the
head of the University who realize the
value of such athletic competition, not
only to the student body as a whole,
but to the engendering of real college
spirit which comes only through close
association in some common purpose.
Glenn H. (Pop) Warner, Stanford's
new football coach, expresses his
opinion of intramural athletics as con
ducted at Stanford as follows:
"Intramural is a great thing. It's a
big problem to get everybody out for
some kind of athletics, and Stanford
is succeeding better than any other
college I know of. Perhaps the climate
here has something to do with it, but
in Stanford a larger percentage of men
are out for sports than in any univer
sity I have heard about.
"Besides developing the men physi
cally, intramural athletics is an im
portant factor. It gets men together
in friendly competition and so pro
motes real college spirit.
"Varsity and intramural athletics
are supplementary. Intramural over
comes the criticism of specializing on
a few men, and varsity teams, which
set kind of an ideal, are a big factor
in making intramural athletics go.

• "It has been my observation that
having large numbers out for sports
tends strongly to increase support of
varsity teams. When men have had
| experience in playing themselves, they
are much more intelligent and inter
ested spectators. They have to get out
and try to do things themselves before
they realize what skill and science are
necessary. It looks so easy when the
major athletes do it.
! "Many times, too, men come out for
, intramural with very little experience
in a sport, and find, to their own and
their friends' surprise, that they are
good enough to make the varsity in a
year or two. Needless to say, such
finds do not meet with disapproval."
To add zest and incentive to the
competition, cups and plaques have
been donated by different alumni and
business firms to go to the winners in
several of the inter-club and inter
house events. These prizes are usually
permanent if won three times by the
| same organization.
In 1922 the four classes then in the
University each contributed a sum of
money which was substantially in
creased by a sum from the Board of
Athletic Control toward the purchase
of a perpetual trophy. As a result, one
of the largest and finest cups among
the athletic trophies of the University
is competed for annually by the four
classes.
The program of sports as tentatively
outlined by the Intramural Office, em
braces every branch of competitive
sport for which Stanford is equipped.
The most important Fall Quarter dates
are as follows:
Oct. I—lnterclass Football —Men tak
ing required physical training

Football. One hour credit will
be given to upperclassmen.

at Encinar.
Charles W. Davis Is in direct charge
of Intramural sports, and it will be
under his guidance that the various
events will be run off. Interest in bas
ketball and baseball ran high last
year, with Delta Tau Delta and Kappa
Sigma winning the respective cham
pionship?.

In the Intramural basketball series,
the freshmen are divided in groups to
represent the floor on which they live
at Encinar.
Charles W. Davis Is in direct charge
of Intramural sports, and it will be
under his guidance that the various
events will be run off. Interest in bas
ketball and baseball ran high last
year, with Delta Tau Delta and Kappa
Sigma winning the respective cham
pionship?.
Intramural athletics will be stressed
this year more than ever before, ac
cording to reports from the office of
Dr. W. H. Barrow, director of physical
education and athletics. In recogni
tion of the value of intramural sports
to the health of the students, the In
tramural office at Encina gymnasium
has been working out a schedule of
contests, which will afford every man
in the University an opportunity to
participate in some sport in competi
tion with others.
Stanford is in the unique position
of having given more thought and care
to the development of intramural ath
letics than most other colleges in the
country. This has been made possible
by having ample ground space to de
vote to athletic fields, and to the more
important factor of having men at the
head of the University who realize the
value of such athletic competition, not
only to the student body as a whole,
but to the engendering of real college
spirit which comes only through close
association in some common purpose.
Glenn H. (Pop) Warner, Stanford's
new football coach, expresses his
opinion of intramural athletics as con
ducted at Stanford as follows:
"Intramural is a great thing. It's a
big problem to get everybody out for
some kind of athletics, and Stanford
is succeeding better than any other
college I know of. Perhaps the climate
here has something to do with it, but
in Stanford a larger percentage of men
are out for sports than in any univer
sity I have heard about.
"Besides developing the men physi
cally, intramural athletics is an im
portant factor. It gets men together
in friendly competition and so pro
motes real college spirit.
"Varsity and intramural athletics
are supplementary. Intramural over
comes the criticism of specializing on
a few men, and varsity teams, which
set kind of an ideal, are a big factor
in making intramural athletics go.

• "It has been my observation that
having large numbers out for sports
tends strongly to increase support of
varsity teams. When men have had
| experience in playing themselves, they
are much more intelligent and inter
ested spectators. They have to get out
and try to do things themselves before
they realize what skill and science are
necessary. It looks so easy when the
major athletes do it.
! "Many times, too, men come out for
, intramural with very little experience
in a sport, and find, to their own and
their friends' surprise, that they are
good enough to make the varsity in a
year or two. Needless to say, such
finds do not meet with disapproval."
To add zest and incentive to the
competition, cups and plaques have
been donated by different alumni and
business firms to go to the winners in
several of the inter-club and inter
house events. These prizes are usually
permanent if won three times by the
| same organization.
In 1922 the four classes then in the
University each contributed a sum of
money which was substantially in
creased by a sum from the Board of
Athletic Control toward the purchase
of a perpetual trophy. As a result, one
of the largest and finest cups among
the athletic trophies of the University
is competed for annually by the four
classes.
The program of sports as tentatively
outlined by the Intramural Office, em
braces every branch of competitive
sport for which Stanford is equipped.
The most important Fall Quarter dates
are as follows:
Oct. I—lnterclass Football —Men tak

In 1922 the four classes then in the
University each contributed a sum of
money which was substantially in
creased by a sum from the Board of
Athletic Control toward the purchase
of a perpetual trophy. As a result, one
of the largest and finest cups among
the athletic trophies of the University
is competed for annually by the four
classes.
The program of sports as tentatively
outlined by the Intramural Office, em

In the Intramural basketball series,
the freshmen are divided in groups to
represent the floor on which they live
at Encinar.
Charles W. Davis Is in direct charge
of Intramural sports, and it will be
under his guidance that the various
events will be run off. Interest in bas
ketball and baseball ran high last
year, with Delta Tau Delta and Kappa
Sigma winning the respective cham
pionship?.
Intramural athletics will be stressed
this year more than ever before, ac
cording to reports from the office of
Dr. W. H. Barrow, director of physical
education and athletics. In recogni
tion of the value of intramural sports
to the health of the students, the In
tramural office at Encina gymnasium
has been working out a schedule of
contests, which will afford every man
in the University an opportunity to
participate in some sport in competi
tion with others.
Stanford is in the unique position
of having given more thought and care
to the development of intramural ath
letics than most other colleges in the
country. This has been made possible
by having ample ground space to de
vote to athletic fields, and to the more
important factor of having men at the
head of the University who realize the
value of such athletic competition, not
only to the student body as a whole,
but to the engendering of real college
spirit which comes only through close
association in some common purpose.
Glenn H. (Pop) Warner, Stanford's
new football coach, expresses his
opinion of intramural athletics as con
ducted at Stanford as follows:
"Intramural is a great thing. It's a
big problem to get everybody out for
some kind of athletics, and Stanford
is succeeding better than any other
college I know of. Perhaps the climate
here has something to do with it, but
in Stanford a larger percentage of men
are out for sports than in any univer
sity I have heard about.
"Besides developing the men physi
cally, intramural athletics is an im
portant factor. It gets men together
in friendly competition and so pro
motes real college spirit.
"Varsity and intramural athletics
are supplementary. Intramural over
comes the criticism of specializing on
a few men, and varsity teams, which
set kind of an ideal, are a big factor
in making intramural athletics go.

• "It has been my observation that
having large numbers out for sports
tends strongly to increase support of
varsity teams. When men have had
| experience in playing themselves, they
are much more intelligent and inter
ested spectators. They have to get out
and try to do things themselves before
they realize what skill and science are
necessary. It looks so easy when the
major athletes do it.
! "Many times, too, men come out for
, intramural with very little experience
in a sport, and find, to their own and
their friends' surprise, that they are
good enough to make the varsity in a
year or two. Needless to say, such
finds do not meet with disapproval."
To add zest and incentive to the
competition, cups and plaques have
been donated by different alumni and
business firms to go to the winners in
several of the inter-club and inter
house events. These prizes are usually
permanent if won three times by the
| same organization.
