# New Physical Examination System Expedites Tests
## 
### 
A new system is to be put into effect
this fall in conducting the required physi
cal examination of the new men stu
dents at the University. In the past these
examinations have been given by the
Medical Adviser or his assistant in the
course of the year, so that often a man
was not examined until the end of the
quarter. This year, with the help of the
local Palo Alto physicians, the examina
tion of most of the new students wil be
done on the first two Saturdays of the
quarter between the hours of 10 and 12
and 1 and 3. The examining team will
consist of four doctors with the neces
sary assistants and clerks. This will
greatly expedite the physical examina
tions and should he a further advantage
to the student in that the student passes
through the hands of several doctors
who are specialists in their line.
Cards giving appointments for this ex
amination have been handed out with the
registration hooks to new students.
These appointments must be kept
promptly and without fail. Owing to the
expense of conducting the examinations
in this way, it will be necessary to make
a charge of $2 to anyone who is unable
or neglects to keep his appointment.
