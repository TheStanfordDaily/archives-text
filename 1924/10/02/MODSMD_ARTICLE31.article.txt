# CARDINAL MEN PROMINENT ON AMERICAN OLYMPIC TEAM
## 
### 
Playing a small but important part,,
in amassing the huge point total which
decisively won for the United States
the Olympic Crown, seventeen ath
letes from Stanford University ma
terially aided the U. S. athletes in
capturing first place in rugby, swim
ming, and track and field events.
Stanford athletes scored all but
three points of the total scoring done
by the champion rugby team. Included
on the rugby squad from Stanford
were Jack Patrick, Dud DeGroot,
Norm Cleaveland, Lin Farrish, Charles
Doe, Phillip Clarke, Bob Devereaux,
W. L. Rogers, Dick Hyland, and Bob
Austin.
The rugby matches were the first
games run oft and the American team,
composed entirely of northern Cali-,
fornia men, including the ten Stanford
members, had no trouble in winning j
its games. The first was played against j
Rumania and the victory gave the
United States team the right to meet
France for the championship.
In the final game eight Stanford
men were on the field. The contest
was won by a 17-3 score and the
Americans showed their sportsmanlike
spirit by not giving way to their feel
ings when booed and hissed by the
French spectators.
One of the French players was ruled
out. of the game when he squared off
and caught Dick Hyland with a right
hook to the jaw, after a particularly
exciting bit of scrimmage. At the re
quest of the American boys he was
allowed to continue in the game. Dick
was considered by many the outstand
ing star of both games.
Norm Cleaveland, now playing half
back on the varsity, proved himself

exceptionally adaptable to rugby and
played in all of the games.
In the track and field events, which
were viewed by many internationally
famous spectators at the Paris Coli
seum between July stli and 12th, two
Stanford athletes participated. Out of
the two hundred and fifty-five points
piled up by the American track team
Bill Richardson and Glenn "Tiny"
Hartranft were responsible for eight.
Richardson took first place in the
second heat of the 800 metre run and
promised to do the same in the finals
but there hard luck put him back to
fifth place, scoring two points.
In the sixteen-pound shot-put, "Tiny"
Hartranft was able to out-distance Bud
Houser of University of California
twice in this country but Bud's great
est heave in the final games was long
enough to force "Tiny" to take second.
Even though the discus is not Hart- i
ranft's favorite activity, in the inter
national competition he was able to
take sixth place and thereby bring his
total of points earned to six.
In the Olympic swimming events A1
White, Dave Fall, Elmer Collett, and
Clarita Hunsberger were entered from
Stanford while Wallace O'Conner,
another undergraduate, was entered
from Venice, California.
O'Conner was on the winning relay
team and Collett played goal guard on
the water polo team, while White and
Fall placed in the diving. A1 White
took first place in the men's spring
board fancy diving and Fall placed
third in the high diving. Clarita Huns
berger did not place among the women
divers but, according to Coach Ernst
Brandsten, she made a very good
j showing.

White and Fall, together with Clar
ence Pinkston of San Francisco, far
outclassed all other divers in the
Olympics just as America far out
classed all other countries in the en
tire swimming meet.

games run oft and the American team,
composed entirely of northern Cali-,
fornia men, including the ten Stanford
members, had no trouble in winning j
its games. The first was played against j
Rumania and the victory gave the
United States team the right to meet
France for the championship.
In the final game eight Stanford
men were on the field. The contest
was won by a 17-3 score and the
Americans showed their sportsmanlike
spirit by not giving way to their feel
ings when booed and hissed by the
French spectators.
One of the French players was ruled
out. of the game when he squared off
and caught Dick Hyland with a right
hook to the jaw, after a particularly
exciting bit of scrimmage. At the re
quest of the American boys he was
allowed to continue in the game. Dick
was considered by many the outstand
ing star of both games.
Norm Cleaveland, now playing half
back on the varsity, proved himself

exceptionally adaptable to rugby and
played in all of the games.
In the track and field events, which
were viewed by many internationally
famous spectators at the Paris Coli
seum between July stli and 12th, two
Stanford athletes participated. Out of
the two hundred and fifty-five points
piled up by the American track team
Bill Richardson and Glenn "Tiny"
Hartranft were responsible for eight.
Richardson took first place in the
second heat of the 800 metre run and
promised to do the same in the finals
but there hard luck put him back to
fifth place, scoring two points.
In the sixteen-pound shot-put, "Tiny"
Hartranft was able to out-distance Bud
Houser of University of California
twice in this country but Bud's great
est heave in the final games was long
enough to force "Tiny" to take second.
Even though the discus is not Hart- i
ranft's favorite activity, in the inter
national competition he was able to
take sixth place and thereby bring his
total of points earned to six.
In the Olympic swimming events A1
White, Dave Fall, Elmer Collett, and
Clarita Hunsberger were entered from
Stanford while Wallace O'Conner,
another undergraduate, was entered
from Venice, California.
O'Conner was on the winning relay
team and Collett played goal guard on
the water polo team, while White and
Fall placed in the diving. A1 White
took first place in the men's spring
board fancy diving and Fall placed
third in the high diving. Clarita Huns
berger did not place among the women
divers but, according to Coach Ernst
Brandsten, she made a very good
j showing.

White and Fall, together with Clar
ence Pinkston of San Francisco, far
outclassed all other divers in the
Olympics just as America far out
classed all other countries in the en
tire swimming meet.
