# "DOVER ROAD" TO BE GIVEN FRIDAY
## Comedy to Have Same Cast As Summer Production By Gordon Davis 
### 
"The Dover Road," by the famous
English author, A. A. Milne, will be
presented in the Assembly Hall on
Friday evening, October 10.
For the first time in (he history of
the University, the campus will be
able to see a play within two weeks
after the opening of college. This is
made possible by the fact that "The
Dover Road" was one of Gordon Davis'
three productions during the summer
quarter, and every member of the cast
except one is now in college.
"The Dover Road" is called an "ab
surd comedy" by its author, and was
received with a great deal of favor
when presented in the summer. Subtle
humor is the forte of the play, which
depicts two runaway couples who are
disentangled from their marital diffi
culties by an eccentric middle-aged
bachelor.
Gordon Davis will be the leading
man, taking the same part as he had
in the first presentation, and this will
be the first time the general student
body will have had a chance to see
him in a play since his return from
his tour around the world. As "Mr.
Latimer," the man of mystery, Davis
has splendid opportunities to display
his rare talents as ;i character actor.
Others in the cast are Norris James,
Grove Day, Anne Gardner Wayland
and Charles Simons, all of whom have
been in several campus production.
