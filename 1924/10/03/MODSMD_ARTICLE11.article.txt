# GRID-GRAPH TO SHOW WORLD SERIES GAMES
## 
### 
The opening game of the World
Series will he traced play by plav to
morrow at 12:15 in the Assembly hall
: by means of a "Grid-Graph" recently
purchased by the Board of Athletic
; Control and placed under the diree*
: tion of the Rally committee.
The Rally committee has been com
pletely reorganized and its work is
being sponsored by the Board of Ath
! letio Control, as evinced by the turn
ing over to the committee of the Grid-
Graph. In speaking of the operation
of the new score-board, Les Peter,
chairman of the Rally committee,
spoke as follows this morning:
"The Rally committee aims to ac
complish great things this year in the
furtherance of Stanford spirit. The
committee appreciates the action of
the Athletic Board and is going to do
everything within -its power to merit
further support by the student body
! and Board of Athletic Control.
"As the Grid-Graph is an expensive
: apparatus it will be necessary to
| charge students 25 cents and outsiders
50 cents for admission. The Rully com-
I niittee will receive a portion of the
i profits to defray the expenses of the
Big Game stunts and the rally at that
time.
"We feel that this animated score
! board will be as entertaining as the
original game. Arrangements have
i been made with the Western Union
Telegraph Company for wire service,
which will be fast and efficient, and
no delay is expected in the receiving
of the play by play account of the
games."
Away from home football and bas
i ketball games will also be shown.
