# STRICT RUSHING RULES SET
## Inter fraternity Council To Define Details For Fraternities At First Meeting 
### 
"It is the desire of the Interfratern
itv Council that (he freshmen be left
to their own devices during their first
college year in the halls and in order
that this may be carried out strict
fraternity rushing rules have been
adopted," says "Nip" McHose, presi
dent of the Interfraternity Council.
At the first meeting of the Interfra
ternity Council next Monday night the
situation will be talked over and defi
nitely outlined to the fraternities.
The rules, as adopted by the Coun
cil last year, permit no rushing during
the autumn and winter quarter and
the first six weeks of the spring quar
ter. On Monday of the seventh week
rushing will begin. The fraternities are
permitted to have only one date with
a freshman during that week and can
make no advance dates with them at

that time. On Monday ot' the eighth
| week intensive rushing will begin and
i will continue until 12 o'clock Satur-
I day night of the ninth week. The
pledging will be done on Sunday, the
1 next day.
Until rushing begins freshmen are
! not allowed in the fraternity houses
i nor are they allowed to take fraternity
men to their rooms in the hall.
Fraternity men can go to the halls
J only on business and then they must
I have permission from a sponsor to
see any freshmen. Organized parties
at the movies are prohibited as are
meetings of frosh and row men in San
Francisco. Freshmen may not wait
table in a fraternity house.
1 Conversation between freshmen and
row men on the campus is permissible.
According to McHose this will promote
i friendship and better choices.
