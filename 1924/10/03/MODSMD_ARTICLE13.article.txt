# CARDINAL FOOTBALL ELEVEN FAVORITES IN INITIAL GAME WITH OCCIDENTAL TOMORROW
## Tiger Offense Is Built Chiefly About Ridderhof at Fullback; Injuries Weaken Southerners 
### David Meiklejohn 
PERHAPS never before in the history of the Stanford gridiron has such wide
spread interest been displayed in an opening contest such as is being
shown, by students and the public at large, in the Stanford-Occidental game
which will be played at 2:30 in the Stadium tomorrow afternoon.
It is not because Occidental is such a drawing card, nor because a close

game is expected. \'or is it because Stanford has a marvel aggregation. The j
whole reason, and this is random conjecture, probably is that Stanford's silver'
lining has at last broken through the black clouds of former, and rancid
tinged, football seasons. Whether that silver lining will burst out into a

Tigers on Campus
The Occidental team, twenty-nine in
number, accompanied by Coaches
I Nichols and Emith and Trainer An
derson. arrived this morning on the
"Owl" from Los Angeles. Twelve let
ter men grace the ranks of the Tiger
aggregation, and it is now being rated
J as one of the strongest elevens among
the smaller colleges of Southern Cali
fornia.
Practically all of Oxy's offense is
i
built around Captain Ridderhof, who
weighs close to 180 pounds and plays
fullback. Last year, in the game which
Stanford won 42 to 0. Ridderhof wor
ried the Cards with his spectacular
kicking and triple-threat antics. He
will be relied.on to run the ball back
ion punts, to kick, and pass. Quite a
nasty dose to force down one man's
throat.
The Tiger squad is suffering some
what from minor injuries. Clarence
Ebers. halfback, has a strained back,
and should he be unable to get into
the line-up, Purser will take his posi
tion. Conde, a guard; Nash, a halfback,
and Link, a center, are also on the
injured list.
Thurmon McHann, an Occidental
tackle, rates among the best in the
Tiger line. While not heavy, McHann
makes up for this deficiency in his
aggressiveness and defense work.
Warner has not announced to date
who, on the Stanford team, will take
the responsibility of safety man for


Coach Glenn ("Pop") Warner, "Old Fox" of the East
and "Dark Horse" of the West, on whose shoulders rest
the hopes of Stanford students and Alumni for a success
ful season and a victory over the California eleven on
November 22.
