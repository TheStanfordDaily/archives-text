# CARDINAL FOOTBALL ELEVEN FAVORITES IN INITIAL GAME WITH OCCIDENTAL TOMORROW
## Tiger Offense Is Built Chiefly About Ridderhof at Fullback; Injuries Weaken Southerners

PERHAPS never before in the history of the Stanford gridiron has such wide

aggregation, and it is now being rated
J as one of the strongest elevens among
the smaller colleges of Southern Cali

Practically all of Oxy's offense is

built around Captain Ridderhof, who
weighs close to 180 pounds and plays
fullback. Last year, in the game which
Stanford won 42 to 0. Ridderhof wor
ried the Cards with his spectacular
kicking and triple-threat antics. He
will be relied.on to run the ball back

nasty dose to force down one man's
throat.
The Tiger squad is suffering some

Ebers. halfback, has a strained back,

the line-up, Purser will take his posi

and Link, a center, are also on the
injured list.
Thurmon McHann, an Occidental
tackle, rates among the best in the
