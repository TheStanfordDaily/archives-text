# NEW COUNCIL IS CREATED TO RUN STANFORD PLAYS
## Decision of Ex Committee Will Bring Reduction in Admission Rates 
### 
The proposed changing of the three
i member Dramatic Committee into a
j five member Dramatic Council, and
' 1 lie changing of the old rules into a
| new charter were accepted by the
! Executive Committee at a special
j meeting held last night.
The management of campus dra
| matics is placed in the hands of a
1 council, whose initial members will be
j as follows: Gordon Davis, director of
] dramatics; Delmer Daves, dramatics
1 business manager; Paul Davis, general
manager; Dave Oliva, vice-president
|of the executive committee, and a
| representative of the organization or
! class that is sponsoring the produc
i tion.
Lower Prices Plan
i Under the new plan the manage
! ment of the presentations will be
j taken from the organizations sponsor
j ing them. By so doing a lowering of
! admission prices will be effected, be
j cause it will no longer be necessary
j to split profits with the various or
! ganizations. From the receipts of the
play, a guarantee to the director will
|be paid and the officials will be
! granted salaries. By the officials is
meant principally the musical direc
i tor, the stage director, and the writer
I ot' the book. Should there be any sur
plus the net profits will go to the
i Dramatic Council and will be directed
1 toward the end of improving the stage
equipment of the Assembly Hall until
i it is second to none in the country.
