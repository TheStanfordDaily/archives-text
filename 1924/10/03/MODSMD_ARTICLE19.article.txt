What, again? No, this is different. Tomorrow is the last day to reg
ister for the Presidential election in November, and students who are
eligible to vote and have not registered will feel more Americanized if they
do. Certain privileged residents of the Stanford campus may sign up at
the office of the Alumni secretary, today or tomorrow.
The conditions governing registration, however, exclude the major
proportion of the student body. Ijnless a student lives at home on the
campus or in Palo Alto, it is necessary that he be entirely self-supporting
in order to be permitted to vote. Financial aid from home—if home hap
pens to be outside of the precinct—shows pretty clearly that the Stanford
campus is not the "legal" residence of the prospective voter. Moreover,
the "intent" figures largely in eligibility. If a student plans to move back
to the home town after graduation, he is defeating his own object by es
tablishing his legal residence on the campus. That necessitates proving
three months residence in the new county, and one month in the new pre
cinct, in order to transfer the registration. If the student moves outside
of California, generally a year's residence in the other state is required.
Those living not far from the University are fortunate in being able to
go home to vote. Others will save trouble by deciding upon their own
eligibility, and acting upon the decision. Primarily, financial independ
ence and more or less severed home ties are necessary to qualify for the
ballot, together with the required year in the state, three months in Santa
Clara County, and one month at Stanford. Despite political clubs formed
in most universities, which are valuable to the student and to the party,
the unfortunate collegian finds himself severely hampered when it comes
to actual voting.
So get aboard the band-wagon if you can—you're a rare individual!
