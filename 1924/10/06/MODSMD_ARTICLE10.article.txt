# A. B. Degree New Requirement For Law School Work
## Action of Trustees Places Stanford Institution On Higher Basis 
### 
By action of the Board of Trustees
during the summer, the Stanford Law
School will become a purely graduate
school, and an A.B. degree will be re
quired for admission. The new ruling
takes effect Nov. 1, 1924.
The new ruling places Stanford in
the same class with Harvard and
Pennsylvania, which at present are
the only universities in the United
States requiring an A.B. for admission
to the law school. The resolution as
adopted by the trustees upon recom
mendation of the law faculty is as fol
lows:
"Admission to the professional cur
riculum in law is to be granted only
to students who have received the de
gree of Bachelor of Arts or an equiva
lent degree, from this university or
some other institution of recognized
collegiate standing; provided, how
ever, that students who have matricu
lated in Stanford University prior to
November 1, 1924, shall be admitted
to the law school upon fulfilling the
requirements in force on May 1. 1924."
Change Nov. 1
Students who matriculate in Stan
ford prior to Nov. 1, whether fresh
men or seniors, will* be admitted to
the law school upon completing the
old requirements. The new require
ments will apply to those registering
next quarter, or after November 1,
whether they have freshman or ad
vanced standing.
The change has been made because
it has been found that to be really
I successful the present-day Jawyer must
i have a thorough grounding in political,
J economic, and social science before
■he attempts the study of law. The
I present lower division requirements
! have ben found to be inadequate for
j such a foundation.
The law school will have its full
j staff of instructors this year. Profes
j sor Clark B. Whittier will again take
up his work after a year's absence on
sabbatical leave during which time he
traveled in Europe.

By action of the Board of Trustees
during the summer, the Stanford Law
School will become a purely graduate
school, and an A.B. degree will be re
quired for admission. The new ruling
takes effect Nov. 1, 1924.
The new ruling places Stanford in
the same class with Harvard and
Pennsylvania, which at present are
the only universities in the United
States requiring an A.B. for admission
to the law school. The resolution as
adopted by the trustees upon recom
mendation of the law faculty is as fol
lows:
"Admission to the professional cur
riculum in law is to be granted only
to students who have received the de
gree of Bachelor of Arts or an equiva
lent degree, from this university or
some other institution of recognized
collegiate standing; provided, how
ever, that students who have matricu
lated in Stanford University prior to
November 1, 1924, shall be admitted
to the law school upon fulfilling the
requirements in force on May 1. 1924."
Change Nov. 1
Students who matriculate in Stan
ford prior to Nov. 1, whether fresh
men or seniors, will* be admitted to
the law school upon completing the
old requirements. The new require
ments will apply to those registering
next quarter, or after November 1,
whether they have freshman or ad
vanced standing.
The change has been made because
it has been found that to be really
I successful the present-day Jawyer must
i have a thorough grounding in political,
J economic, and social science before
■he attempts the study of law. The
I present lower division requirements
! have ben found to be inadequate for
j such a foundation.
The law school will have its full
j staff of instructors this year. Profes
j sor Clark B. Whittier will again take
up his work after a year's absence on
sabbatical leave during which time he
traveled in Europe.
