# CARDINAL VARSITY STRUGGLES THROUGH 20 TO 6 VICTORY OVER OCCIDENTAL GRID-MEN
## Stanford, Despite Fumbling, Shows Superiority In Carring Ball; Hey, Bogue, Card Stars 
### David Meiklejohn 
Stanford's 1924 varsity, backed by a ground-gaining combination of reserves,
easily won its first intercollegiate football game from Occidental in the
Stadium last Saturday afternoon, by the convincing, but in many ways
imsatisfactory, score of 20 to t>.
Surfacely, there was a great deal wrong with the Cards. Too many fumbles,
too many indecisions, too much ragged teamwork. But those who kept close
account of the game and saw the terrific amount of yardage the Cards rolled
up against the light southern team could easily feel optimistic rather than
pessimistic* over the final result.
Here is a fact that might be of interest: Stanford's total yardage was 453
yards, and Occidental was lucky.to roll up a total of 48 yards during the entire

game. Figures do not lie, as some
wiser man has said, but a final foot
ball score might not always tell the
whole truth.
That first part of the initial quarter
made everybody breathe too optimistic
an air. Cuddeback's sensational 60-yard
run called for bigger and better runs,
and Stanford's evident ability to gain
at will only made the fans look for
ward to its doing so whenever a touch
down was arbitrarily demanded.
It was not a great victory for the
Stanford varsity, but it was an over
whelming vote of confidence for the
Cardinal reserves. It will take a genius
to decide which man will do best at a
given position on the team hereafter.
Warner will have to fall back on that
method of least resistance, namely:
"eeny, meeny, miny, mo, this is the
man that ought to go."
That one blighting moment, when
Ridderhof kicked off to Cleaveland and
the safety man hobbled, allowing
Hazeltine to walk over the goal line
for a touchdown, left a bitter taste.
Fumbles, however, are inevitable, how
ever undesirable.
Cliff Hey, substituted for Solomon
at fullback, won everlasting commen
dation for his ground-gaining line
plunges. Hey was worked unmercifully
for over a dozen plays and on few oc
casions did he fail to penetrate the
Tiger line for less than a three-yard
gain. Another fullback to gain recog
nition for ground-gaining was George
Bogue, who, following the example of
Hey, was shoved through the line time
after time.
The question of a safety man dis
cernable earlier in tlie season and evi
dent in Saturday's game, has become
a vital one for the "Old Fox." Cleave
land was not the only player fumblinsf
the kicks; there were others who han
dled the sphere with indecision and
temerity.
The southern team made a feeble
attempt at a come-back late in the last,
half. Ridderhof completed one or two
passes hut could gain no ground. Stan
ford also attempted passing in the last
period, but to ill effect.

Stanford's 1924 varsity, backed by a ground-gaining combination of reserves,
easily won its first intercollegiate football game from Occidental in the
Stadium last Saturday afternoon, by the convincing, but in many ways
imsatisfactory, score of 20 to t>.
Surfacely, there was a great deal wrong with the Cards. Too many fumbles,
too many indecisions, too much ragged teamwork. But those who kept close
account of the game and saw the terrific amount of yardage the Cards rolled
up against the light southern team could easily feel optimistic rather than
pessimistic* over the final result.
Here is a fact that might be of interest: Stanford's total yardage was 453
yards, and Occidental was lucky.to roll up a total of 48 yards during the entire

game. Figures do not lie, as some
wiser man has said, but a final foot
ball score might not always tell the
whole truth.
That first part of the initial quarter
made everybody breathe too optimistic
an air. Cuddeback's sensational 60-yard
run called for bigger and better runs,
and Stanford's evident ability to gain
at will only made the fans look for
ward to its doing so whenever a touch
down was arbitrarily demanded.
It was not a great victory for the
Stanford varsity, but it was an over
whelming vote of confidence for the
Cardinal reserves. It will take a genius
to decide which man will do best at a
given position on the team hereafter.
Warner will have to fall back on that
method of least resistance, namely:
"eeny, meeny, miny, mo, this is the
man that ought to go."
That one blighting moment, when
Ridderhof kicked off to Cleaveland and
the safety man hobbled, allowing
Hazeltine to walk over the goal line
for a touchdown, left a bitter taste.
Fumbles, however, are inevitable, how
ever undesirable.
Cliff Hey, substituted for Solomon
at fullback, won everlasting commen
dation for his ground-gaining line
plunges. Hey was worked unmercifully
for over a dozen plays and on few oc
casions did he fail to penetrate the
Tiger line for less than a three-yard
gain. Another fullback to gain recog
nition for ground-gaining was George
Bogue, who, following the example of
Hey, was shoved through the line time
after time.
The question of a safety man dis
cernable earlier in tlie season and evi
dent in Saturday's game, has become
a vital one for the "Old Fox." Cleave
land was not the only player fumblinsf
the kicks; there were others who han
dled the sphere with indecision and
temerity.
The southern team made a feeble
attempt at a come-back late in the last,
half. Ridderhof completed one or two
passes hut could gain no ground. Stan
ford also attempted passing in the last
period, but to ill effect.
