Entering upon Volume 66 with a clean slate and a desire to keep it so.
the Daily Palo Alto cherishes the sole ambition to become as good a student
newspaper as is possible for it to be, under the circumstances. All evi
dence. actual and psychological, forecasts a good year for Stanford, and
it is the natural desire of the "Daily" to take its part in the steady ascend
ancy of the University. The paper is owned by the Associated Students,
and run by them and for them. Its columns are the natural battleground
of student opinion, and signed letters of comment will be printed when
ever possible.
The Daily is primarily a journalistic class-room, and perfect work is
not always possible. Comment and criticism will be welcomed, and every
effort will be made to discover the sort of material most acceptable to the
student body. There is no definite "platform," save to sift out whatever
may come up and lend support to the side which seems best fitted to the
advancement of the University and of the student body.
Space limitations frequently make it impossible to present as varied or
as comprehensive picture as is ideal, but new departments and plans will
be tried out throughout the year as often as possible. "Cabbages and
Things" will be revived, perhaps not every day but several times a week.
Various other schemes and "columns" are being devised, with the idea of
throwing light upon the gyrations of the student mind as well as the re
countal of regular news. With the lamented departure of "Spectator," it
is left to the Daily to serve as the organ of student opinion, a service best
rendered by the invited "Viewpoints."
