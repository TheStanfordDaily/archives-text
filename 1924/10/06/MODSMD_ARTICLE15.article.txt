When Gordon Davis began to coach Stanford dramatics a few years
ago, those dramatics were only just about so-so. Now, we find them de
veloped to a point where a Greek tragedy, produced during the summer
quarter with its supposedly limited facilities, drew outside people from all
over the Peninsula and would have taxed the house to capacity if it hadn't
been given out-of-doors. Also, we find practically every play presented
here to be of a high type of excellence. Gordon is coming into his own.
Early in 1923, the old Dramatic Council died of internal complications,
and the Dramatic Manager system, with centralized control, took its
place. Under this system, practically all control of matters Thespian was
vested in Mr. Davis, but the various organizations having as their func
tion the presenting of plays were still entitled to fifty per cent of all profits.
They assumed no risk in case the production failed to break even. In
fact, they assumed very little responsibility of any kind, inasmuch as it
was really more efficient for Mr. Davis to hold all the reins. And Mr.
Davis kept turning out financial successes, the treasuries of the various
dramatic clubs profited, and there was not enough money to turn into stage
properties needful for bigger and better spectacles. Moreover, the old
guarantee to the director was waived by Mr. Davis, and in the absence of
a salary increase it soon developed that he was being wretchedly underpaid.
The new five-member Dramatic Council authorized by the Executive
Committee Thursday evening is doubtless the greatest step forward in
the history of Stanford dramatics. The dramatic societies—most of them
—were deprived of their "cut" 011 the profits, and most of the money will
be turned back into a fund for the proper staging of future successes, with
salaries lor those who do the work and a guarantee to Mr. Davis which
will bring his compensation to a point commensurate, more nearly, with
his ability. And the plays can be advertised off-campus as "Stanford
University Presents v " thus greatly increasing their drawing power.
111 effect, however, they will be just as much the products of the individual
societies as before.
The student probably cares very little about the inner mechanism of
dramatics, if only good plavs are given at fair prices. The new plan will
bring with it a lower admission cost to the undergraduate, the assurance of
better and better plays as time goes on. and will only pinch those organiza
tions whose "percentage" is cut out. And the bulk of those organizations
were at some pains to know what to do with that percentage.
The new plan puts these societies about where they belong—as honor
aries in the field of dramatics. Since 1923, lliey have never been active
producers, and profits, like credit, should be given where due. Mr. Davis
is to be congratulated not only upon his great success with Stanford dra
matics, but upon the plan which will make those dramatics even more
successful.

VIEWPOINTS, as lias been previously stated, will he hilariously
welcomed by the Daily. They should be not over 200 words in length,
deal with some current problem, and present a logical position or solution.
All must lie signed, but the name will not be printed or disclosed if a re
quest to that efi'ect is enclosed with the letter.
