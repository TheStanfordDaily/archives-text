# "DOVER ROAD" OPENS DRAMA SEASON FRIDAY
## 
### Hal Rorke 
Because "The Dover Road" proved
to be such a flrilliunt success when
presented last summer quarter, Dra
i matic Coach Gordon Davis is reviving
■ the play to introduce the new scholas
tic theatrical season, Friday evening,
October 10.
The first show produced by Stanford
University instead of by an organiza
tion, under the new order of things, is
! the work of A. A. Milne, whom the
I critics call whimsical. Be that as it
| may, "Tlve Dover Road" is downright
funny. And it is a play every prospec
tive eloper would do well to see for
! its practical suggestions.
Introduces Novelties
Mr. Milne's comedy will point out
! the necessity of not taking cold dur
' ing an elopement unless one can
squeeze romance through a mustard
plaster.
It will predict the disaster which will
inevitably follow shaving in public.
It win reveal the difficulties con
nected with making love while one's
feet are soaking in hot water,
i it will conclusively prove that one
' should always have an amiable old
| bachelor handy to straighten things
out later.
Gordon Davis will appear as the ec
' centric bachelor, supported by Norris
I James, Charles Simons, Grove Day,
I Anne Gardner Wayland and Carolyn
j Fromberg, all experienced actors.
Rehearsals Tonight
Rehearsals start tonight. Only a
few readings necessary to whip
the performance into shape for its
| second presentation.
Campus theater-goers will be able
j to see a more finished offering than
ever before. A« second showing of any
| Stanford play has rarely been given.
I A more accurate estimate of the true
I possibilities or the campus actors may
jbe had Friday night than perhaps
ever before.
The technical details prepared by
the class in theatrical workshop dur
! ing the summer will be in charge of
| the same crews and everything points
i to a smooth performance.
