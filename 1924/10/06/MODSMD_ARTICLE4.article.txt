# FIRE PROTECTION TO BE SUFFICIENT FOR WINTER NEEDS-ROTH
## Domestic Wells Being Used to Maintain Pressure in Searsville Main 
### 
Fire protection for Stanford will be
| entirely adequate this winter, despite
1 reports to the contrary, according to
! Comptroller A. E. Roth. Although
1 Searsville Lake reservoir, the usual
source of water for fire mains, is dry,
arrangements have been made to use
I the domestic water supply to provide
j pressure mains.
Searsville Lake was depleted of
| water the first of August and from
then until September, (ire pressure
I was maintained through the use of
booster pumps working on three do-
I mestic wells and the Felt Lake re
serve supply. During September, the
i Searsville main was connected with a
I large well on the creek above the
; Convalescent Home, installed by J. E.
1 Sherer, a sub-tenant. With the help
j of a booster pump, the University is
now being supplied with as great an
1 amount of water as ever before from
! the new well.
In ease of fire, however, all the
domestic wells, together with the new
! one and the gymnasium pool-well, can
be turned into the Searsville main and
supply sufficient water. In fact, the
new well alone can supply enough
: water for 2ti hours' steady pumping,
j according to Roth.
To prevent contamination of the
1 domestic supply in case the Searsville
water backs up, a sump has been in
stalled at the connection of each do
mestic supply with the Searsville main.
J This sump, or concrete reservoir,
makes possible the picking up of water
Iby the Searsville main but prevents
the same water from flowing back into
the domestic supply.
The use of the new pump will he
continued until about February when
it is expected that the winter rains
will have raised the Searsville water
leyel to a height possible to use. To
be in readiness for this, a new outlet
pipe is being constructed near the dam
at Searsville '-the old one being too
low in the mud to be of use
