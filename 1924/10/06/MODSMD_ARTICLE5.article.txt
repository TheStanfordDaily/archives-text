# WILBUR STRESSES SCHOLARSHIP AT FIRST ASSEMBLY
## Opportunities at Stanford Are Greatest for Students With Right Purpose 
### 
"Experience has shown us that one
of the greatest values of the scholar
ship record that accumulates quarter
by quarter in the Registrar's office is
that it can be used as an index of
regularity, punctuality, stability, dili
gence, intelligence, and character,"
said President Wilbur this morning at
the assembly of welcome to the new
students. As an introduction to the
advantages of the campus here, he
mentioned the opportunities to be
gained by acquaintanceship with the
library, the art gallery, and the mu
seum, and the general facts connected
with the administration.
Activities Need Not Interfere
Concerning activities of all kinds,
Wilbur said, "Some of you are prob
ably going to get so interested in some
of the side shows of Stanford life that
you will find the gates to the main
tent soon closed for you. There is
really no need of this. Practically all
of you can, with good health, do work
up to our standard and graduate here,
but you alone can make good."
Emphasizes Loyalty
Wilbur emphasized the great im
portance of loyalty. He said: "Stan
ford is now bone of your bone, flesh
of your flesh, and will so remain. Some
of us are positions of trust, others in
teaching, others are students, but
Stanford belongs to all of us, and all
of, us belong to her."
