The first rehearsal of "The Dover
Road" last night gives promise of a
highly finished performance next Fri
day. The cast went through the entire
play with scarcely a mistake, it was
so fresh in their minds from having
-played it last July.
"The Dover Road" was such a hit
during the summer quarter that mail
orders for seats have been increasing
in volume every day, according to re
ports from the office of Delmer Daves,
Dramatic Manager.
The Theatre Workshop class, Eng
lish 121, under whose auspices the
play is being given, have constructed
an exact replica of the set used for
the first performance. Designed by
Chrysella Hunker and Les Kiler, the
set for "The Dover Koad" won praise
trom everyone, it was so harmonious
and well executed. Supposed to repre
sent the reception room of an eccen
tric middl-aged bachelor, it is fur
nished elaborately and fantastically,
as the room of a bachelor naturally
would be.
In order to take care of the tremen
dous demand for seats, there will be
a general seat sale tomorrow, Wednes
day, in the Administration building, at
1 o'clock. The Palo Alto demand will
also be heavy, and students are urged
to secure seats at the regular sale, in
order to get the best.
"The Dover Road" will mark Gordon
Davis' first appearance on the campus
stage during the regular college year
since his return from the Orient. His
portrayal of Mr. Latimer, the rich,
eccentric bachelor, was hailed last
July as being the best work he has
done here at Stanford. The part seems
to have been made for the suave, cool,
unperturbed manner which Davis im
parts to his characterization. "The
Dover Road" is truly a Gordon Davis
production, for in addition to taking
the leading part, he directed the play
and supervised the technical work.
Crew at the University of California
advanced another notch last week
when the purchase of property on the
Oakland estuary was authorized. This
property, located 400 feet east of the
Park Street bridge, is to be used for
the erection of new crew sheds which
will cost approximately 511,500.

play with scarcely a mistake, it was
so fresh in their minds from having

"The Dover Road" was such a hit
during the summer quarter that mail
orders for seats have been increasing
in volume every day, according to re
ports from the office of Delmer Daves,
Dramatic Manager.
The Theatre Workshop class, Eng
lish 121, under whose auspices the
play is being given, have constructed
an exact replica of the set used for
the first performance. Designed by
Chrysella Hunker and Les Kiler, the
set for "The Dover Koad" won praise
trom everyone, it was so harmonious
and well executed. Supposed to repre
sent the reception room of an eccen
tric middl-aged bachelor, it is fur
nished elaborately and fantastically,
as the room of a bachelor naturally
would be.
In order to take care of the tremen
dous demand for seats, there will be
a general seat sale tomorrow, Wednes
day, in the Administration building, at
1 o'clock. The Palo Alto demand will
also be heavy, and students are urged
to secure seats at the regular sale, in
order to get the best.
"The Dover Road" will mark Gordon
Davis' first appearance on the campus
stage during the regular college year
since his return from the Orient. His
portrayal of Mr. Latimer, the rich,
eccentric bachelor, was hailed last
July as being the best work he has
done here at Stanford. The part seems
to have been made for the suave, cool,
unperturbed manner which Davis im
parts to his characterization. "The
Dover Road" is truly a Gordon Davis
production, for in addition to taking
the leading part, he directed the play
and supervised the technical work.
Crew at the University of California
advanced another notch last week
when the purchase of property on the
Oakland estuary was authorized. This
property, located 400 feet east of the
Park Street bridge, is to be used for
the erection of new crew sheds which
will cost approximately 511,500.
