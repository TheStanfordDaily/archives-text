# HANDBALL MEN WILL STAGE TOURNAMENT
## 
### 
Campus handball enthusiasts are
signing up now for the University
singles tournament which will start
next week.
It is expected that the four new
handball courts constructed during
the summer will stimulate the already
active interest in the game and result
in a record field of entrants.
Whiting Welch romped away with
first honors last year and will be out
to duplicate the feat. Since freshmen
as well as upper-classmen are eligible
for the varsity in this sport, they will
probably turn out in large numbers
for the tourney in an effort to earn a
berth on the squad. Sign-up sheets will
be posted in the Encina gym until
October 13.
