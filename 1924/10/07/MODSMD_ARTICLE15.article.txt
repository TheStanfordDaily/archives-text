i interest of baseball fans throughout
| the United States and many foreign
! countries, begin to come in over the
I Western Union leased wire and each
report is immediately flashed on the
electric scoreboard.
This animated scoreboard was origi-
I nally purchased by the Board of Ath
! letic Control to trace all off-campus
j football games play by play and all
i profits go to the Rally Committee to
j be used for bleacher stunts at the Big
| Game. For this reason admission is
i charged for all world series games as
| well as the football games that will
| be shown later.
With the student body card the ad
j mission is 25 cents; otherwise it is 50
j cents. According to Orville Tucker, in
charge of the operation of the ma
chine, "the board is so complete in
tracing the plays that it is us enter
taining as the original game. No delay
has so far been experienced in receiv
ing of the Western Union reports, and
j none is expected."
