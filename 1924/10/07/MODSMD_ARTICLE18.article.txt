# FROSH AND SOPHS ARGUE TOMORROW ON LAKE BOTTOM
## Battle Royal Will Be Waged Between Mud Pits for Highest Honors 
### 
i Mud-slinging, that ancient art of
J colleges and kings, will be the order
of the day tomorrow afternoon, when
the classes' of 1927 and 1928 engage
in royal combat for high honors.
The jousting will begin at :> o'clock
on Lagunita lake-bottom and is the
one remaining underclass fight left of
many Stanford customs. In it, mud will
I assume first place in prominenceâ€”the
battle" being waged on territory be
tween two large pits filled with a mix
j ture of dirt and water commonly
! known as "mud." These pits are to be
dug this afternoon by the freshman
| class.
Rules of the fight are simple,' so as
! to be easily understood by the resi-
I dents of Encina.
Both classes are to assemble in
battle formation at Encina and Se
| quoia halls. Such weapons as pick
axes and crowbars are barred and
| must be. checked at the boathouse.
I Upperclass sponsors will be in charge
of the festivities and it is rumored
that ice cream and cake will be sold
jto onlookers to defray the former's
' expenses.
The amount of clothes to be worn
j is optional. Too many will be cumber
j some, too few unadvantageous. As to
! the method of procedure during the
! struggle, no rules have been issued,
leaving the combatants to formulate
i their own murderous plans.
As a last request, both sides have
! been asked by the sponsors not to
i throw dead bodies into the pits as
I this merely clogs the latter, making
; it difficult for the defeated combatants
to be properly submerged.
