# Rally Committee
## 
### 
The Rally Committee—a rather new organization at Stanford —has
already been appreciated by the Hoard of Athletic Control to the extent
of a $1600 Grid-graph. This device, which moves the Polo Grounds to
Palo Alto, will be operated by the Committee, and the proceeds will be
used to make up the Board's investment and provide the Committee with
the much-needed funds for its proper functioning. Off-campus athletic
contests will be played before the usual student cheering-section, even
though it is impossible for the bulk of the student body to promote a trip
to Portland or Los Angeles.
This is a glaring example of the progress being made by the Board
of Athletic Control, with Paul Davis fanning the flames. Firstly, off
campus games will be reported efficiently—a service which the
"Daily" has attempted, but has never been financially able to perfect.
Under the Rally Committee, it is in mure suitable hands, and it will
no longer be necessary to receive only final reports on scores.
Secondly, the Rally Committee is given the support it needs —and
richly deserves. Bleacher stunts and the organization of rallies,
with proper entertainment, takes money, and heretofore the Com
mittee has been practically dependent upon "hand-outs." Thanks
to the Grid-graph, things will be on a much more satisfactory
basis, and Big Game stunts can be made better than ever, with the
student actually getting value received for the money he devotes
to them. I
Primarily, of course, the Grid-graph is designed for the portrayal of
Stanford contests abroad. Baseball fans, however, may enjoy watch
ing Walter Johnson pitch his next game by wire in the Assembly
Hall.
