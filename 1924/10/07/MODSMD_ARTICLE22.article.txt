"Read the Daily Palo Alto, but don't take the'editorial column
too seriously," said President Wilbur yesterday, in the opening
assembly of the year. The editor wishes to modestly but fervently
add his prayers to the advice of the President.
There is nothing- more horrible than those who take everything
too seriously. A cool, balanced mentality is one thing; a frozen,
static concentration is another. Opinions and advice of others have
as their chief value the opening of possibly neglected mental chan
nels of one's own; swallowed whole they. generally choke the
swallower with an over-dose of very raw material. The artful article
written from an opinionated (or editorial) point of view seeks to
lead —not push—and if successful is generally so because of pure
logic and reasoning. Some are written not to be successful, but
merely to open a line of thought for the consideration, and then the
acceptance or rejection, of the reader.
And so, unless we yearn to become a race of Robots, let us not
take anything TOC) seriously—least of all the "Daily" editorials.
