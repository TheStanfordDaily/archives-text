Beginning with tomorrow's paper, a column written by a repre
sentative Stanford woman will be run from time to time with the
idea of giving Stanford's feminine minority the opportunity of ex
pression which it so richly deserves and so seldom gets.
Many sides of life here on the Farm were constructed by mascu
line minds, and the peculiar quirks of the lady mentality are quick
to observe the equally peculiar quirks of masculine reasoning. It is
scarcely fair to the all-around aspects of Stanford education to allow
the male to revel unchallenged in his eccentricityâ€”man has the right
to learn wherein his psychology differs from that of those who have
so far suffered very nearly in silence.
The column will be capably handled, and will doubtless present
Stanford in a new light to many who have considered their knowl
edge of it to be pretty comprehensive.
