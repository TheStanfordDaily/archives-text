# Varsity Scholarship
## 
### 
Since one woeful day two years ago, when fourteen athletes
flunked out at the close of a single quarter, it has been more and
more realized that the man who would make a team and still perform
his scholastic duties to the University is faced with two distinct and
man-sized jobs. Now, in further recognition and appreciation of
this, the "Illustrated Review" announces a substantial award to the
varsity man who, in 1924-25, combines the best record in scholar
ship and general contribution to the life of the University.
There can be no suggestion here of "paying the athlete to get his
lessons." It is, pure and simple, a tangible appreciation of his three
fold devotion to the University he has chosen. The man who quali
fies for it will be a remarkable man, and in his hands the award of
the "Illustrated" will be wisely utilized.
