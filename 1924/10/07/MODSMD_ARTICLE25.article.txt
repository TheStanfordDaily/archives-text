The Registrar's Terrible Mistake
"The registrar was a bright, hand
some man. He loved to stand before
his little window, and tug his mus
tache, and smile at the lines of radiant
girls approaching him. He felt that
his appearance was faultless, irre
proachble; and he took a great pride
in always seeming to be at liis best.
"Then, one day, something hap
pened. The registrar noticed that in
spite of his faultless appearance, and
pleasant, winning manner, the people
who came up to his window invariably
went away with an expression of dis
taste—of nausea, almost.
"It began to get on his nerves. He
lost sleep, and wouldn't eat his car
rots. He asked every one in the office
what was the matter; but they all
avoided the questtion.
"Finally be sighted a charming, pi
quant freshman at the end of the line.
He resolved that he would make an
impression on her at all costs.
"As she came up to his window he
smiled sweetly, and leaned forward.
'Registration will cost you ninety-five
dollars,' he breathed in her ear.
"Immediately the girl recoiled from
him. An expression of disgust ap
peared 011 her face. She folded up her
check-book and walked away."
