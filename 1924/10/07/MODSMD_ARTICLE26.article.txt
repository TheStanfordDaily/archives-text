By Launcelot Lump
I do not own a radio,
I cannot even make one go,
But I have something better, for
I listen to my room-mate snore.
He gives his concerts in all keys
From treble clef to deep baas wheeze
He does not have to be tuned in;
One never knows when he'll begin.
He is a great long-distance snorer,
He'd break all records, with a scorer;
At times, however, he gives hints
Of being better in the sprints.
My evenings, therefore, are not dull
For if there ever comes a lull
My room-mate, not to be a bore,
Obligingly starts in to snore.
