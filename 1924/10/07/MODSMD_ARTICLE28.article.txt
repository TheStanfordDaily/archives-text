# CALIFORNIA WILL BE STRONG BUT NO WONDER TEAM, DOPE
## 
### 
Despite the sizzling hot criticism
and wails of despair that are the lot
of Andy Smith, California coach, there
seems to he little reason to feel elated
over the apparent weakness of the
California varsity this season.
California did not show up strong
in the Bronco game, but the Bruin
varsity had enough punch left in the
second half to score a victory. True,
Andy Smith drank a barrel of water,
and stretched his championship hands
out of shape wondering if, after all,
the fifth season of silveflined career
would begin with a defeat at the hands
of a second-rate college.
Babe Horrell, captain and center on
the Berkeley team, still looks to be
the best center on the Pacific Coast.
Not only were his passes to the back
field satisfactory, but his line plunging
and defense work were a revelation
this early in the season.
The California backfield is mediocre.
Brown, a halfback, and Dixon, play
ing the other half, were easily the out
standing ground-gainers, but neither
of these two had anything resembling
startling possibilities.
