# Incomplete Edition of Daily Palo Alto Caused By Power Short Circuit
## 
### 
An underground short circuit in the
I Stanford power sub-station seriously
I crippled the University Press yester-
I day afternoon, forcing the "Daily" to
' put out a scant edition of patehed-up
and incomplete news. The power went
off at 1:50 anu was not brought in
again until slightly before closing time
for the pressmen.
The linotypes were turned over by
J hand to set date-lines and other essen
â€¢ tials, and "hand-set" type was used
whenever possible. News items not
| yet in type were abandoned until to
day," and the press was operated by
! emergency storage batteries, which
went dead after 500 copies had been
printed.
