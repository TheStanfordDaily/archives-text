## 
### 
Quad managerial tryoutees will meet
tonight at 7:15 in Room 201 as origi
| nally planned. Photographic editorial
i tryoutees will meet tomorrow night
at 7:15 in connection with the meeting
; of editorial tryoutees. This announce
ment clears up a conflict with the
Women's Conference party.
At tonight's meeting. Quad mana
; gerial work will be explained. Accord
ing to Manager Ray Kay, tryoutees
will work in several fields. The first
will be the selling of books. Another
j will be organization and office work.
A new filing system has been installed
which is expected to save tryoutees
much time.
From among the tryoutees will be
I chosen the manager and three assist
ants, at least one of whom must be
a woman. This is the first time that
the mangership and all of the assist
antships will be open to women, and
it is expected that several will avail
themselves of the opportunity.
The photographic editorship of the
Quad is something entirely new on the
I campus, and the tryoutee system
which will be used this year is a com
plete innovation in college annuals.
Usually a commercial photographer
or some particularly well-qualified stu
dent is chosen at random.
During the last few years a dearth
' of suitable men has arisen, and this
I system has been developed to train
photographers for this kind of work.
Sophomores and juniors can try out.
' The only requirement is a slight
I knowledge of photography. Gale Gris
wold, photographic editor, will give a
j course of lectures and practical in
struction to tryoutees, in which they
will be given opportunity to learn all
branches of commercial photography.
The tryoutees will incur no expense,
and all developing and printing will
be done in town.
Two photographic editors will be
I chosen from this year's group of try
| outees, one from the sophomores and
! one from the juniors. Kach will hold
| office during his senior year.
