Loose models again I
The campus is still very much
for the loose, easy suit this fall.
It's a college style that has every- I
thing in its favor â€”comfort,
looks and an air that belongs
with the university man.
Here is the accepted suit: a
broad shouldered coat, the
back very loose, flat or shaped
just a trifle; low, soft lapel,
straight, wide trousers. This 1
suit, cut by Society Brand,
made up in the light colored I
cheviots, is quite the best look
ing college style we have seen.
