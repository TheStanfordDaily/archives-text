# THE 						LAW STEPS
## 
### 
« v. G. D. <£■
Women aren't allowed on the Law
steps. With the five-to-twenty ratio in
this University situations have arisen
which are typical of Stanford only;
and one of these is the prohibition—
which works considerably better than
the national one—that keeps women
from walking-up the Law steps. There
are other situations and traditions of
the University equally justifiable and
reasonable.
The editor is giving this space three
times a week to b.e used for the pure
purpose of enlightenment, and with
that aim only is it written.
Entering. students have been heard
to ask, among other things, when the
women were "going to be dropped
from the University." After Stanford,
with an enrollment ,of less than five
hundred, had been in existance. for a
few years Mrs. Stanford noticed that
the number of women students was
containually increasing over the num
ber of men. At that time five hundred
seemed a huge crowd, and to limit the
enrollment of women by the number
she did (instead of by percentage)
seemed to Mrs. Stanford more than
liberal.
Stanford has outgrown and far sur
passed the dreams of its founders; but
the clause limiting the. number of
women to five hundred still remains
in the contract. If any undergraduate
thinks that the women, either because
of their small number or for any other
reason, are "going to be dropped from
the University," he is misinformed.
They are far outnumbered, yes; but!
superior quantity does not always sig- j
uify superior quality.
The men of the Freshman and j
Sophomore classes are pulling one an-1
other about through mud this after- i
noon. They don't wear many clothes, J
and they skin their knees. They will
be talking about it for the next month. j
Have you ever seen young colts in a '
wide field on a frosty morning?
Monday morning at a 9 o'clock as- \
sembly President Wilbur spoke to the
student body, and primarily to the
entering students. The entire student
body ws not present. Among other
things the President told what Stan
ford stands for: "playing square," and (
having initiative; and the only way
to get possession of this latter quality j
is to have one air, or ideal, or ambi
tion, whatever you choose to call it. ;
This ideal is what Stanford is offer- j
iug; once secured, the initiative will \
come of itself.
Perhaps the wise ones who weren't
there (that isn't slang; it's sarcasm) j
do not realize that their President j
doesn't speak for the fun he gets out
of Yt, or because he needs the practice, j
It is very possible that he speaks be- !
cause h"e knows something which they ;
do not; it is very possible.
The Duke of Alba, a direct descend- j
ant of Christopher Columbus, and at
present a guest at the Douglas Fair- j
banks home in Los Angeles, declares i
his belief that Queen Isabella did not 1
finance his ancestor's voyage to Amer- ;
ica. We cannot be sure even of our j
kindergarten history, it seems. To re-1
quote President Wilbur, "don't go too ,
heavily on the editorial." Remember j
what you see and hear in your classes; ,
but living is the greatest education ,
there is: be alive!
A recent Daily said that 1653 stu- j
dents have registered in the Univer-1
sity; a few more have registered since j
then, but only a few. The University !
of California has enrolled over 10,000 |
students, yet her football game with
Stanford is the biggest event of the !
year. Nearly 10 to 1; have you ever:
heard of Stanford "spirit/' and won- :
derod just how much it counted in that
10 to 1 ratio?
