# SPECIAL TRAIN WILL CARRY STUDENTS TO CARD-TROJAN GAME
## Rally Committee Stresses Support of Grid-Graph By Living Groups 
### 
That the Rally committee support
the graduate manager in organizing
and sending special trains carrying
Stanford students and alumni to the
football game with U. S. C., was the
decision of the committee at its regu
lar meeting last night.
Harry Noland was chosen as secre
tary of the committee, and- Ed Wells
was named as manager. The commit
tee also discussed the relatively poor
attendance at the Grid-Graph showing
of the World Series games, and formu
lated plans to promote interest in this
branch of its activity.
Railroads Decided On
Paul Davis, graduate manager, and
representatives of the Southern Pacific
and Yale-Harvard Steamships met
with the committee to determine the
best method of transporting students
to the game at Los Angeles. The rail
road was selected as the best mode of
travel because it will enable both stu
dents and alumni to get to the contest
and return without missing classes or
business. A special rate of $21.50 has
been secured. The train will carry
both Tourist and Standard cars, the
former making it possible to secure a
berth for $3.60 round trip. The train
will make the same time as does the
Lark.
It is suggested that living groups
postpone lunch in order that their
members may witness the remaining
games of the World Series. So far the
Grid-Graph has been a losing proposi
tion, and since it has been installed
for the enjoyment of the students, the
committee urges a large attendance.
