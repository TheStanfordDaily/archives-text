# EASE OF TECHNIQUE CHARACTERIZES TRIO IN SACRED CONCERT
## 
### Allene Thorpe 
Suavity of phrasing, clarity of tone,
ami technical ease marked the sacred
concert given Tuesday evening in the
Memorial Church, by Christine How
ells Pfund, flutist; Grace Becker, 'cel
list. and Warren D. Allen, University
organist. -
_ Trios and solos made up the unique
recital, which consisted of selections
from Bach, Gluck, Rimsky-Korsakov,
Ravel, Handel, and others.
Intonation Emphasized
Mrs. Pfund demonstrated her purity
of intonation and silver "tang" in five
flute solos, among which was Gluck's
"Melody" from "Orpheus" transcribed
for flute solo from the music for the
"Dance of the Blessed Spirits." Other
numbers were: La√üarre's "Rondo;"
Cyril Scott's appealing "Vesperale,"
and selections by Schumann.
The 'cello solos selected were Rim
sky-Koraskov's "Hymn to the Sun;"
Popper's "Gavotte," and "Ele
gie." The "Elegie" being solemn in
spirit was especially pleasing with
slow movement of the organ. Miss
Becker recently returned from the
East where she has been appearing in
concert.
Trio Successful
"Deep River," a negro spiritual se
lection, was especially appropriate for
one of the trios, since it brought into
use the best qualities of the three in
struments. Debussy's "Romance" and
Ravel's "Pavanne," two of the few
numbers arranged for flute, 'cello, and
organ, were well suited to sympathetic
interpretation. The finale was taken
from Ceaar Franck's "Grand Piece
Symphonique," which was originally
composed for the organ.
