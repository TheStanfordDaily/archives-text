# DAVIDSON OUT WITH BROKEN ANKLE BONE
## Babes Meet Potter High, San Jose, and Polytechnic High Saturday 
### 
Horace Davidson, end on the fresh
man eleven, broke his ankle in foot
ball practice yesterday afternoon, and
will be out of the game for some time.
Davidson was one of the first string
ends, and started at that position in
the game against the Modesto Junior
College last Saturday.
Three Contests Saturday
Three contests are scheduled for the
first year men next Saturday. The
babes will meet the California Poly
technic high school pigskinners at 1
o'clock in the Stadium. This game will
be preliminary to the Stanford-Olvm
pic Club game.
At 10 o'clock the second and third
teams will tangle with San Jose high
school and Potter high, of San Fran
cisco, respectively.
If Dennis' leg enables him to turn
out for practice again, he stands a
good chance of grabbing the end posi
tion. While in high school he made
all-southern end. However, he will not
get the position without a struggle.
Both Issel and Montgomery have been
showing up well in practice, and in
the preliminary games.
Patchett Good in Backfi»jtd
Patchett, who went in at half in the
game with Modesto, demonstrated that
he is capable as a backfield man. Al
though green, he is fast, and carries
the ball well.
Millage is still favorite over Hoff
man for the fullback position. His
punting in the Modesto game was not
as good, on the whole, as Hoffman's,
but in practice and scrimmage he has
proven the more consistent of the two.
