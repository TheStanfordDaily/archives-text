# 1926 QUADS TO GO ON SALE TOMORROW
## 
### 
Sale of 1926 Quads will start tomor
row with the establishment of booths
at which students can sign up for
their books.
By the action of the amendment
passed last spring, the Quad becomes
a student body publication, hi line
with this, the 15)26 Quad will be even
more of an all-University book than
formerly. As a move in this same
direction, the management is trying to
pull the price down so that it will be
within the reach of everyone. The
regular price is six dollars, but for a
limited time, probably about three
weeks, the books will sell for $5.50,
payable in installmentsâ€”s2.so down
and the rest later.
