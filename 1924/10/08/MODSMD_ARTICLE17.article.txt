# OLYMPIC CLUB IS NEXT ON VARSITY COMPETITION LIST
## Winged "O" Team Thought To Have Weakest Offense In Many Years 
### 
I Cardinal griddei's will open the sec
ond game of the Stanford schedule,
heavy favorites to defeat the once
vanquished Olympic Club eleven next
Saturday afternoon.
Little Resistance Expected
The Winged "O" team for the first
| time in years hold forth no great
threat of resistance. There were times
in the past when a game with the
Olympics meant almost certain defeat,
but this year competition promises to
be too strong even for a team that has
the choice of graduated college ath
letics.
There might be some changes in
the Cardinal squad which meets the
Club men. This is more than likely
considering the strength exhibited by
the Cardinal reserve in the Occidental
game. It is hard to pick a team of
eleven men and call them first string
when there are twenty-two men of
practically equal calibre.
Nevers Will Not Play
Ernie Nevers is not expected to take
part in the Olympic Club game, and
that means choose a fullback from
among three men of equal ability:
Solomon, Hey, and Bogue. Bob Hunt
performed creditably enough at one
of the guard positions to draw con
sideration. Ed Sandys, a transfer from
Oberlin, is a strong tackle possibility.
Stanford Strength in Reserves
Stanford's strength lies not in eleven
men. It is concentrated in a squad of
reserves, any one of whom can be
sent in to fill a gap and stop a leak.
It is with this foundation that Stan
ford has the advantage this year. Not
that Stanford is a wonder team aggre
gation. That has been practically set
tled, much as it would be nice to have
it true. But the Cards have a STRONG
team —one that can gain ground, not
only through the line, but by passing
and kicking—a triple threat eleven.
The whole trouble lies in the fact that
the triple threat strength is in the
hands of one man, who is now slowly
recovering from an injured foot.
