Play-goers will be offered an unusual opportunity Friday evening
when the Stanford dramatic coach forges up-stage with five seasoned
student players, in a production which was given during the summer
quarter and is being repeated by request.
Always the chief criticism of campus plays is their well-nigh un
avoidable amateurishness. The annoyance of classes and other educa
tional impedimenta seems strangely to forbid continuous and intensive
drilling for a month or more, and that may have something to do with
the undeniable difference between the Junior Opera and the Metropolitan
affair which has also adopted the name. This same amateurishness will
be noticeably absent Friday, as tlie players put on the play under fire
during the summer. Gordon Davis as the lead will give the campus one
of its rare chances to watch the coach in action, and his efforts alone
would be enough to swing "Tlie Dover Road" into the success column
even without such an able supporting cast.
It will be the first play of the year produced under the new centralized
control, and "first-nighting" is ever an engaging sport.
