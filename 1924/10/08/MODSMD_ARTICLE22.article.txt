# Pop Warner in Futures
## 
### 
Mr. Average Student, whoever he may be, came away from Saturday's
football game with a rather sour taste in the mouth, which rapidly
disappeared. Perhaps the comparison with other Conference scores
which are more near than dear to us may have had something to do
with this, but it was only natural that light should, after a time, appear.
It has become customary to expect a class A university to pile up a
score somewhat resembling that of a bowling match in its early en
counters. To what end? The varsity would not receive advance credit
for a single touchdown in next Saturday's game if it had rolled 300 last
week, and the leg muscles of its individual members would have been
shredded. To say nothing of the turf in the Stadium.
Stanford has as coach a man who cannot possibly be rated below the
top layer of football professors. His assistants are experts. They play
their games one at a time, but plan their games as much for the future —
immediate and remote—as for the present. The varsity showed Saturday
a definite and satisfactory superiority over its opposition. It is the hope,
and plan, of the coaching staff, that this situation keep repeating itself
throughout the season. Dynamite is spectacular, but an electric drill does
cleaner work. We look for Mr. Warner and the varsity to bore their
way through the season.

CHEMISTS have the opportunity to compete for six prizes of $1000
each, offered for essays on various branches of the subject. A month's
brain-work might go farther toward putting a man through college than
a year's output of perspiration.

PLENTY of underclassmen craved to be "011 the boat" during this
afternoon s carnival of slime. Pity there wasn't a raft in the wallow.

TNTERC'LASS football teams are getting under way. It's more real
tun for them than it is for the varsity.
