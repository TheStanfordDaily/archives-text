# IMPROVEMENTS MADE ON ENCINA GYM; TWO NEW WINGS ADDED
## 
### 
Extensive improvements, the begin
ning of a twenty-year building plan,
were made on Encina gymnasium and
grounds this summer. These improve
ments, together with a reorganization
of departments, were made under the
direction of Paul Davis, graduate
manager, from plans approved last
year by the Board of Athletic Control.
The plans themselves were divided
into suggestion** for buildltags and for
grounds, the general plans having
been accepted while the detailed plans
have yet to be submitted. Upth cover
149 acres devoted to athletic activi
ties.
Two wings on the east and west
ends of Encina gymnasium are the
most apparent additions. When com
pletely finished they will add from
two to four times the space previously
occupied by various departments
under the graduate managers direc
tion. Hie allotment of Bpace is is
follows:
The east wing is to contain two
drying rooms: one room each for tfce
varsity freshman and second-varsity
squads; four rooms for visiting teams;
offices of freshman and varsity train
ers; and a coaches' dressing room.
In the west wing will be the gymna
sium clerical force, student managers,
graduate manager, office for ticket ap
plications, news service director, the
director of athletics, and three rooms
for the medical department.
Space Re-Allotted
This re-allotment of space, accord
ing to Davis, will increase the size of
his departments as follows: The store
is tripled; lockers, one-balf as many
more; team rooms doubled; visiting
team rooms quadrupled; wrestling
room doubled; showers doubled; grad
uate manager's office doubled; fenc
ing rooms doubled; and trainer's
rooms doubled.
In addition to the building improve
ments a landscaping program, drawn
up by Gardiner Dailey, will be put into
effect immediately and completed by
January 1. This provides for lawns
and shrubbery around Encina gymna
sium corresponding to those in front
of the basketball pavilion. The land
surrounding the stadium will also be
improved in a similar manner.
Davis has also put into operation a
departmental reorganization. He is
still graduate manager in relation to
athletic affairs but as head of his
organization his official title will be
"General Manager."
Department Heads
Under him will be: Superintendent
of grounds and buildings, Sam Mc-
Donald; store manager, George Mof
fit; trainer, Wallace Denny; office
manager, Don Clark; accountant, A.
E. Millar; news service director, Don
Liebendorfer; operations manager,
Ford Tussing; and student activities
manager, O. F- Tucker.
Furthermore, a central accounting
system has been installed. All accounts
of student managers will be kept here
and, according to Davis, it will serve
to keep a more efficient check on stu
dent activities expenditures. It will
also prevent, said Davis, a re-occur
rence of the Spectator incident of
last year, in which a debt of $1600
was incurred which must be stood by
the student body as a whole.

As a result of the United States
turning the Boxer indemnity into a
relief fund for Chinese students, thou
sands of Orientals have received col
lege educations in America.

Courses in public utilities, the first
in this country, will be given at Tem
ple University, Philadelphia, this year.
