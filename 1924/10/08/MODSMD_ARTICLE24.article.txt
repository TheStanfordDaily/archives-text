# Water Shortage Causes Lawn to Be Plowed Up And Replaced by Shrubs
## 
### 
Owing to the great water shortage
that has caused untold damage and
| loss throughout the state during the
past summer and keenly felt in the
immediate vicinity the lawn in front
of the Administration building has
been plowed up.
Lake Searsvilie, the former source
iof water supply for lawns and agri
culture in the locality, is completely
dry and relief has been secured
through new wells. The new supply
was not estimated to be sufficient to
keep such an immense lawn green so
;it was decided to replace it with
flowers and shrubs.
; Work on the new landscape will
; begin as soon as the first rains come
and thereafter will need much less
water than was used on the lawn.
