# NO FINAL CLINCH IN FRIDAY NIGHT PLAY
## Dover Road Author Explains Objection to Happy End Of Play 
### 
Happy endings are all right, but —
A. A. Milne, author of "The Dover
| Road," believes that the happiness of
! his audience is of infinite more im-
I portance than that of his characters.
So in his "absurdity" which will re
ceive its second presentation by an
all-Stanford cast Friday evening, Octo
ber 9, in the Assembly hall, Stanford
will have an opportunity to see the
only play of the year without the usual
curtain clinch.
Milne, himself, gives these reasons
for this situation:
"Those who see 'The Dover Road'
will find that Anne does not, after all,
marry Mr. Latimer. They may, per
haps, assume that this is how I origi
nally wrote the play and that 1 was
persuaded against my better judgment
into a so-called happy ending which
left Anne with the sound of wedding
bells in her ears. I owe it all to Mr.
McClintic, who produced the play so
delightfully in London, to explain that
such was not the case. 1 wrote it
originally as he produced it; but, even
as I wrote. I felt that I did not want
Anne married: I was so much in love
with her. To rescue her from Leonard
was easy; to save her from Nicholas
was more difficult; and in an un
guarded moment, while 1 was triumph
ing over Nicholas, Mr. Latimer got
her. Dominic and I were both a little
disappointed, but we said nothing. I
knew that I should have another
Chance later on. 'Wait,' I said to the
smiling Mr. Latimer, "until we get to
rehearsals. Marry you? Why she does
n't even know your Christian name!'
But 1 didn't think then that the first
rehearsals would happen thousands of
miles from Dover and that I should
not be there to save her. Mr. Latimer
always knew in his heart he was too
old for her. In fact I sometimes think
he and Anne only pretended in order
to frighten Dominic."
