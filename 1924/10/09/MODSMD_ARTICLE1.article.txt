# SALVATION ARMY SCORES TRIUMPH IN MUD BATTLE
## 1927 Wins Popular Decision From Backward Babes; Sponsors Cheated 
### Wallace KnoX 
The Salvation Army won!
Staging a glorious comeback, after
going half an hour without a score, the
Army scored a thin dime and a bat
tered penny on the drum in rapid suc
cession. and left the field (he victors
by a slight margin. Had the offense
been doughnuts instead of music the
score would undoubtedly have been
larger.
1927 placed second, winning an easy
decision over 1928. After fifteen min
utes of struggling not a freshman was
to be seen except around the babe's
own mud-wallow, where he was In the
act of hurtling through the ozone to
land with a dull thud upon the slimy
ooze beneath.
The foxy freshman guides had
doped out a scheme for their charges
to win—by having the Babes stand
fast while the barebacks advanced the
length of the field —but when the I
sophomores outfoxed the well-meaning '
seniors by continuing to advance and
then cleansing the yearlings in their !
own lamp-black, the benevolent spon
sors at once gathered together and an
nounced. undw the authority of the
A. S. S. U., that the freshmen had
won, because so few of them went i
into the right mudhole. The freshmen !
accepted this decision with gusto but ;
all of the unbiased spectators, includ- j
ing the Daily Palo Alto, voted the
greasy ones an overwhelming margin
of victory.
About tlie time the sophomores ap- |
peared on the brow of the hill their
highly-waxed backs glistening on the
sun like so many Roman? or was it,
Greek? gods. Each time the freshmen
decided the last one was over the
hill, another hundred would appear, j
After watching this strange phenome
non the yearlings were ready to es
cape, but found a heavy rope stretched i
around the field draped with upper
classmen —so they stuck!
The battlers squared off in their
corners and faced each other; then
the Babes refused to advance. Despite
the shrieks and cries of the men in
cords the Babes stood fast. Wails
arose from the onlookers —to think a
freshman class would be afraid to
fight, ellow! they cried. But, this was
the foxiness devised by the sponsors.
The 1927 outfit took things in their
own hands. andr with much speed and
thoroughness, proceeded to throw the
freshmen into whichever pool was
nearest. The sophs held both ooze cen
ters from the inside, which made it
rather impossible for the Babes to
douse any of their opponents.
It was noticed that a few of the
sophs lost that article of clothing
which is referred to in polite society
as trousers early in the fray. This ne
cessity of dress was quite unneces
sary so long as the wearers are buried
waist deep in the slimy mud, but the
Daily Palo Alto wonders just how they
got home. Did they trust a coat of mud
to protect them on their showerward
journey, or did they stay in the mud
hole until dark and then dash up the

liill under cover of darkness?
Anyway, the sophomores paid the
babes, with interest, for the beating
administered the night before by the
i babes at Encina hall.

That fine coat of tan so much de
sired by beach loungers has been sim
plified at Deauville, France. Tea
baths are the secret. Evening gowns !
or disarranged bathing costumes show !
110 patches of white, and there is no ■
danger of sunburn from over-exposure. ;
The treatment must be taken with 1
however, for some girls got their
tea too strong and appeared In such '
deep tones of bronze that the desired
effect was lost.

It was noticed that a few of the
sophs lost that article of clothing
which is referred to in polite society
as trousers early in the fray. This ne
cessity of dress was quite unneces
sary so long as the wearers are buried
waist deep in the slimy mud, but the
Daily Palo Alto wonders just how they
got home. Did they trust a coat of mud
to protect them on their showerward
journey, or did they stay in the mud
hole until dark and then dash up the

Anyway, the sophomores paid the
babes, with interest, for the beating
administered the night before by the

The Salvation Army won!
Staging a glorious comeback, after
going half an hour without a score, the
Army scored a thin dime and a bat
tered penny on the drum in rapid suc
cession. and left the field (he victors

been doughnuts instead of music the
score would undoubtedly have been
larger.
1927 placed second, winning an easy
decision over 1928. After fifteen min

to be seen except around the babe's
own mud-wallow, where he was In the
act of hurtling through the ozone to
land with a dull thud upon the slimy
ooze beneath.
The foxy freshman guides had
doped out a scheme for their charges
to win—by having the Babes stand
fast while the barebacks advanced the
length of the field —but when the I
sophomores outfoxed the well-meaning '
seniors by continuing to advance and
then cleansing the yearlings in their !
own lamp-black, the benevolent spon
sors at once gathered together and an
nounced. undw the authority of the
A. S. S. U., that the freshmen had
won, because so few of them went i
into the right mudhole. The freshmen !
accepted this decision with gusto but ;
all of the unbiased spectators, includ- j
ing the Daily Palo Alto, voted the
greasy ones an overwhelming margin
of victory.
About tlie time the sophomores ap- |
peared on the brow of the hill their
highly-waxed backs glistening on the
sun like so many Roman? or was it,
Greek? gods. Each time the freshmen
decided the last one was over the
hill, another hundred would appear, j
After watching this strange phenome
non the yearlings were ready to es

around the field draped with upper

The battlers squared off in their
