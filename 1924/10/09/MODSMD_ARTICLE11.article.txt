# WHEAT INJURES NECK IN PRACTICE CONTEST
## 
### 
Gil Wheat, one of the strongest half
backs on this season's Stanford var
sity, will probably be out of the game
the remainder of this year as the re
sult of an injury to his neck in prac
tice yesterday afternoon.
Wheat has had two years' experi
ence on the varsity teams, and this
season promised to grab a steady
berth in the Cardinal backfield. His
injury leaves Warner short a good
halfback and open field runner.
An X-ray, being taken of his neck
today, will determine definitely the
extent of the injury.
Wheat injured his head last year in
the same place and a special helmet
had been designed in case any chance
of his getting hurt arose again. How
ever, just before he was hurt he
tossed the helmet aside and this, it is
thought, tended to make the injury
worse!.
