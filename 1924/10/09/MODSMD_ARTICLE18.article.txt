# WINGED "O" ELEVEN WEAKER THAN IN FORMER SEASONS
## Post-Streeters Show Little Strength in Game With Agnetian Squad 
### Douglas Meservey 
The Cardinal's struggle with the
Olympic Club eleven next Saturday
should prove a good workout for Stan
ford but the result can hardly be said
to be in doubt.
In previous years the Post-streeters
have brought down with them a well
seasoned aggregation, strong in both
offense and defense. This year, how
ever. Coach Hollingsberry's proteges
have not shown the class exhibited
formerly. Their initial battle was on
September 21 with the Agnetians, an
eleven three-fourths of which was
composed of former University of
California stars. The former Bears
evidently had not -lost their old-time
class and trounced the Club team 14
to 0, with the fcelp of such men as
"Brick" Muller, "Stew" Beam, and
"Hoggy" Evans. It was a steam-roller
defense that counted the 14 points for
the Agnetians, but on the other hand,
the Olympic Club showed little
strength in that department. The left
end of the line seemed weak and, with
the exception of "Scotchy" Campbell,
leader of the 1923 Card eleven, at
quarter, and Jimmy Needles, captain
and half, the baekfield also fell short
in offensive power.
Use Short Pass
What gains were made by the
Winged "O" were largely through the
use of short passes—usually Needles
to Campbell. "Scotch," noted for his
open field running, will have to b«
watched Saturday if he snags one of
Needles' passes.
Although the Olympic Club lineup
has not been received here, it is
thought that another Stanford player
will be seen in the Club ranks, Jack
Patrick. His work at defensive figured
well in the Agnetian game and he will
probably be used here Saturday.
Beat Navy Team
A game of lesser importance was
also played September 27 with the
IT. S. S. "Pennsylvania." the Club
eleven winning 12 to 0. It may have
been that the opposition was weaker,
bur reports have it that the Winged
"O" line appeared strengthened and
did very well in stopping the sailors'
attacks. The baekfield was still weak,
however, probably because of the ab
sence of Captain Needles. The "Penn
sylvania" squad was beaten earlier in
the season on September 20, by "Pop"
Warner's then immature eleven, 20
te 3.

evidently had not -lost their old-time
class and trounced the Club team 14
to 0, with the fcelp of such men as
"Brick" Muller, "Stew" Beam, and
"Hoggy" Evans. It was a steam-roller
defense that counted the 14 points for
the Agnetians, but on the other hand,
the Olympic Club showed little
strength in that department. The left
end of the line seemed weak and, with
the exception of "Scotchy" Campbell,
leader of the 1923 Card eleven, at
quarter, and Jimmy Needles, captain
and half, the baekfield also fell short
in offensive power.
Use Short Pass
What gains were made by the
Winged "O" were largely through the
use of short passes—usually Needles
to Campbell. "Scotch," noted for his
open field running, will have to b«
watched Saturday if he snags one of
Needles' passes.
Although the Olympic Club lineup
has not been received here, it is
thought that another Stanford player
will be seen in the Club ranks, Jack
Patrick. His work at defensive figured
well in the Agnetian game and he will
probably be used here Saturday.
Beat Navy Team
A game of lesser importance was
also played September 27 with the
IT. S. S. "Pennsylvania." the Club
eleven winning 12 to 0. It may have
been that the opposition was weaker,
bur reports have it that the Winged
"O" line appeared strengthened and
did very well in stopping the sailors'
attacks. The baekfield was still weak,
however, probably because of the ab
sence of Captain Needles. The "Penn
sylvania" squad was beaten earlier in
the season on September 20, by "Pop"
Warner's then immature eleven, 20
te 3.
The Cardinal's struggle with the
Olympic Club eleven next Saturday
should prove a good workout for Stan
ford but the result can hardly be said
to be in doubt.
In previous years the Post-streeters
have brought down with them a well
seasoned aggregation, strong in both
offense and defense. This year, how
ever. Coach Hollingsberry's proteges
have not shown the class exhibited
formerly. Their initial battle was on
September 21 with the Agnetians, an
eleven three-fourths of which was
composed of former University of
California stars. The former Bears
evidently had not -lost their old-time
class and trounced the Club team 14
