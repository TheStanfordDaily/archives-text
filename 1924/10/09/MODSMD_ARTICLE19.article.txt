## 
### 
Washington again evened the World
Series standing at New York today
when they took a 2-1 game from the
Giants. After having a one-game lead
on the Senators the Giants must meet
them again tomorrow in the game that
will decide the World's Championship
for 1924.
At the beginning of the fifth inning
the Giants led 1-0 when Peckinpaugh
for the Senators singled to left, Ruel
sacrificed Peckinpaugh to second and
Zachery groundd out. McNeely walked
and when the pitcher tried to catch
him off first he stole second.
With three balls and two strikes,
Harris at bat singled to right and
scored both Peckinpaugh and Mc-
Neely. Harris stole second but the
next batter was retired on three
strikes.
In the ninth inning Peckinpaugh
again hurt his leg and was assisted
from the field. New York made a
feeble attempt to rally and with a man
on second two batters fanned.
A large turnout is expected to view
tomorrow's play-by-play by means of
the Grid-Graph.
