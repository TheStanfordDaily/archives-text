I lie scholarship ratings for last year, released in yesterday's paper,
were interesting. Especially when the the extreme left-hand
side were taken into consideration. It'turned out that Phi Beta-Kappa
had the best scholarship of any group on the campus.
Cellar places—two of them—were occupied by freshman athletic
teams. The varsity squads were better off, which may be basis for
the assumption that a year at Stanford makes an athlete consider some
thing other than his sport. Above these, the next nineTeen places, with
live exceptions, we»t to fraternities. The exceptions were two honorary
societies, an eating club, a varsity team, and another freshman team.
()nly nine fraternities were higher than the. lowest hall group, which
incidentally was the freshman dormitory.
The non-sorority women topped the held under the general classifica
tion, but the sorority women were well ahead of either fraternity or non
fraternity men. 1 lie foreign clubs, contrary to the general student idea
of their bookishness, bowed gracefully before their linguistic handicap
and finished well down 011 the list.
I - our sororities stood lower than the highest fraternity, but nineteen
fraternities were worse oft* than the most unfortunate sorority. The
student and professional honorary societies ranged from first to eighty
fourth places out of the field of ninety-two.
es. the ratings were interesting, and also significant. So much so,
in lact. that it would pay anybody to study them while in a philosophical
mood, and arrive at some conclusions of his own.
