# "DOVER ROAD" CAST ENDS REHEARSALS
## Elusive Humor of British Comedy Brought Out More Strongly For Second Performance 
### 
fTHE last dress rehearsal will be held tonight for "The Dover Road," which
Gordon Davis will present tomorrow night in the Assembly hall.
"The Dover Road" is a comedy of such subtle humor that endless time could
be spent on its production and then some fine points would be slighted. A. A.
Milne is a master of the art of humor and sarcasm, and this play is considered
his most successful comedy. Producing it for the second time within a tew
months has enabled Gordon Davis to smooth out the unpolished parts which
were evident at the first showing, and has made it possible for him to inject
more humor and action. r
Anne Gardner Wayland will delight everyone in the role of Anne, just as
she did last summer. Ease and naturalness are the outstanding requirements
of this role, and she fits into her part as though it were made for her.
Leonard, an erring husband who is also a member of the House or Lords,
is played by Charles Simons. Leonard goes through the entire second act
attired in the very cool and comfortable costume of lavender o pajamas, loung
ing robe and slippers. The shaving scene in this act drew many laughs at
the first performance.
Carolyn Fromberg is one of these gooey, gusliy, sympathetic women in the
part of Eustasia. Coddling and comforting is her long suit, and her affections
and attention invariably follow the man who is ill. Miss Fromberg, who is
the only newcomer in the cast, is a transfer law student from Mills, where
she took part in dramatics.
Those who saw "Captain Applejack" last year need not be told what kind
of a butler A. Grove Day can be. A suaye and imperturbable exterior, and a
deep butlerish tfoiceâ€ž help to make his role of Dominic one of the principal
figures of the cast.
But the real interest in the play will center around the star and director,
Gordon Davis. In the role of Mr. Latimer, the man of mystery, Davis gives a
flawless and vital characterization.
