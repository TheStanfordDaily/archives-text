# BABE GRIDDERS SLATED TO PLAY THREE CONTESTS
## Hospital List Bars Three First String Players From Scrimmages 
### Donald Irving 
Three games are on tap for Stan
lord's freshman football squad tomor
row. Coach "Husky" Hunt will send
his first team against California Poly
technic, of San Luis Obispo, at 1
o'clock in a preliminary to the varsity
contest, while the light freshman team
will he divided in two, and will meet
San Jose and Potter (San Francisco)
high schools at 10 a.m. on the practice
fields.
The first team will go into the game
considerably weakened by injuries.
Davidson, who is the heaviest and one
(if the best ends on the squad, broke
his ankle in practice Tuesday, and will
be out of the line up for the rest of
the season. *
Weakened by Injuries
Hunt's two centers, Dorcy and Mus
tain, are both on the sick list, but it
is hoped that one of them will be able
to start. Altaffer, who has been playing
with the first string at halfback, is
also out with a bum shoulder, and will
not be in the line-up.
Other members of the squad that
are suffering from minor injuries are:
Dennis, who has been out most of the
season with an injured leg, Issel, Hoff
man. and Millage.
Millage has been getting more
height and distance in his punts than
Hoffman, and is slated to begin at
full. Pabst and Hill will take' care of
the halfback positions, with Murphy
calling signals. Murphy has shown
good headwork in his choice of plays,
and is good at carrying the ball. He
is rated above Clark, who is also out
for quarterback.
The frosh team is fast coming to
work as a unit, and both the line and
the backfield are playing a good brand
of football. The linesmen are opening
up big holes, and the backfield men
are running good interference.
Following is the line-up for the
afternoon contest: ends, Vincenti, Is
sel!; tackles. Robesky, Everett;
guards. Post, Bigelow; center, Dorcy
or Mustain; ouarterback, Murphy;
halves, Hill. Pabst; fullback. Millage.
