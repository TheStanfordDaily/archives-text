# BEARDSLEY TO OPEN STUDENT ASSEMBLY
## 
### 
"Chuck" Beardsley, president of the
Associated Students, will preside over
the annual Ret-together student body
assembly at 10 o'clock Tuesday morn
ing.
The purpose of the assembly will be
to welcome students, and to put every
one "on the boat." Leaders of all ac
tivities will give talks, explaining the
different fields open to the students.
Since yelling is one of the activities
most often indulged in by students,
the yell leaders will probably give an
exhibition of real enthusiasm, with
songs and cheers.
