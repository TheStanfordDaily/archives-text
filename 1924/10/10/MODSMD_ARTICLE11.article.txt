; Stories missed by regular reporters .
: and scooped by tryoutees will count!
heavily toward election to the staff. +
Work of Tryoutees
This schedule is a bit heavier than \
: the work of a regular reporter on the j
i staff, but only because it is desirable ;
to have a quantity of sample copy on i
I which to pass judgment. It also proves |
pretty conclusively whether or not the j
j prospective reporter can stand the :
gaff. After election the, reporter will j
! be broken in on light beats, and given |
aruopportunity to learn the game thor-j
! oughly.
Election will be made on considera
tion of three things—initiative, as,
judged by the quantity of copy turned j
in and the number of unassigned j
stories; ability, in regard to readable!
style and proper use of English gram-!
mar; and reliability,- shown by com-]
plete covering of beats and attendance i
at tryout meetings.
These meetings will be held every)
day next week, at 12:50 in the Press;
building. They will be short and i
snappy and usually dismissed in time !
for 1 o'clock classes. Any tryoutee un-!
able to report for one of these meet-!
ings must speak to the Editor. Manag
ing Editor, or Women's Editor in ad-!
vance. Excuses will be issued then but!
not later.
The primary function of the Daily j
Palo Alto is to be as good a college
paper as possible, but there is a great !
deal of pleasure connected with staff
jnembership. Life around the office is
\ congenial, and an organization known
: as the "Afternoon Club" officially han
dles the social activities of the staff,!
I which usually culminate in a ban-!
| quet held during the iatter part of the
quarter. ' * i
