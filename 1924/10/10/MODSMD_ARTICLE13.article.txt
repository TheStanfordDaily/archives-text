"Recent Observations of Greece and
Italy" is the subject selected by Pro
fessor Jefl'erson Elmore, of the Classi
cal Literature department, for his lec
ture in the Little Theatre Tuesday
evening at 7:30.
Professor Elmore recently returned
from a six months' visit to these coun
tries. His itinerary also included a
trip to Constantinople, and a three
weeks' stay in Paris.
A part of the tour in Greece was
made in company with a group of
professors and students from the.
American School of Classical Study j
at Rome. The party assembled at i
Naples, and spent some time there
visiting various collections.
The Greek government took notice i
of the party by allowing them half
rates on the railroads, waiving most
of the passport fees and formalities,,
and giving free admission to al! na
tional museums and collections in I
Naples.
Before the departure of the com
pany for Greece, Professor Elmore de
livered a lecture to the members of i
the School in the National Museum on 1
a famous historical inscription which 1

is one of the chief treasures of the |
collection.
"At the present time conditions in 1
Greece are improving," he remarked, 1
"but they are still in an exceedingly
difficult position from a variety of
problems, chiefly those concerning the j
refugees."
"In Italy the situation is much more
stable and prosperous. Permanent im*|
provenient seems to be in progress in
spite of political difficulties. I was in
Rome at the time of tlie murder of
Mateotti, the Fascist! member of the
Italian Parliament. Mateotti is sup
posed to have been murdered on ac-1
count of his actual criticisms of the'
government," he explained, "also in
fear of other criticisms which he was
expected to make,"
Professor Elmore observed tlie ex-j
citement following the murder, includ
ing a strike of the railroad men at a
terminal station. He was surprised
that on the whole there was much less
disturbance than one would expect. |
"There are many misleading reports
in America concerning Italy." he said,
"some of which are apparently citvu- j
lated for the purpose of bringing the
Fascist! regime into discredit."
