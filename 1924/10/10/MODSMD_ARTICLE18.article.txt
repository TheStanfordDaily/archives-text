On the surface it would tend to show
that the Stanford coach was not alto
gether satisfied with the showing of
the Cardinal players last Saturday.
This is not thought to be the case,
however, as players like Johnston,
Baker, and Sliipke are not altogether
out of the running. More than likely
Warner is resting them. Johnston has
a small infection on the arm, and this
is probably the reason he is not in the
starting line-up.
Van Hook, who is taking Baker's job
at center, has come up phenomenally
since last year, when he played sub
stitute. His passing compares favor
ably with that of Baker, but he
probably is not quite as effective as
Baker in hitting the line and opening
up holes.
The Olympic Club, in previous con
tests with Stanford, always held the
aXe over the head of the Cardinal
grid teams. Olympic Club elevens,
composed of stars University of
California. Stanford, and from other
big teams in the United States, were
hardly a match for a university barely
initiated into the pitfalls of football.
