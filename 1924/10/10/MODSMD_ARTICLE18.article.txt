## RESERVES START GAME Regulars Forced From Game By Injuries; Subs in Four Positions 
### David Meiklejohn 
Coach Glenn "Pop" Warner sends
bis Stanford varsity against the Olym
pic Club eleven of San Francisco to
morrow afternoon at 15 o'clock with
the line-up as radical as the worst days
of the Bolshevik regime in Russia.
Here is the complete line-up for the
game:
Stanford Olympic Club
Thomas (0) LER Larsen (8)
Poulson (4(J) LTR C. King (31)
Swan (7) LGR Bartey (21 >
Van Hook (35) C McCreery (12)
Neill (19) RGL McArthur (18)
Flood (43) RTL Locey (84)
Lawson (1) REL Lidderdale (52)
Solomon (13) Q Campbell (55)
Cuddeback (2) LHR J. Needles (1)
Cleaveland (11) RHL H. Smith (13)
Hey (20) F J.Brown (17)
On the surface it would tend to show
that the Stanford coach was not alto
gether satisfied with the showing of
the Cardinal players last Saturday.
This is not thought to be the case,
however, as players like Johnston,
Baker, and Sliipke are not altogether
out of the running. More than likely
Warner is resting them. Johnston has
a small infection on the arm, and this
is probably the reason he is not in the
starting line-up.
Van Hook, who is taking Baker's job
at center, has come up phenomenally
since last year, when he played sub
stitute. His passing compares favor
ably with that of Baker, but he
probably is not quite as effective as
Baker in hitting the line and opening
up holes.
The Olympic Club, in previous con
tests with Stanford, always held the
aXe over the head of the Cardinal
grid teams. Olympic Club elevens,
composed of stars University of
California. Stanford, and from other
big teams in the United States, were
hardly a match for a university barely
initiated into the pitfalls of football.
But times have changed. Although the
Olympic Club teams still attract the
university stars they are not able to
compete with the better trained and
more spiried athletes still in college.
In 1919 the Winged "O" outfit
trounced Stanford 13 to 0; they re
peated the performance the following
year 13 to 7. only to lose to the Cards,
7 to 0. in 1921. Nineteen-twenty-two
saw another strong Olympic Club
team, and Stanford lost 27 to 9. The
Warner system triumphed, however,
in 1923, Stanford winning 40 to 0.
Close Score Possible
To say that Stanford has the edge
over the Olympic Club grid team
might be closer to the truth than
otherwise, but, nevertheless, it is
better to hope for a trouncing victory
and expect a close score.
"Seotchy" Campbell, who used to
run punts back for the Stanford var
sity and captained in between times
last year, is playing quarterback for
the Clubmen, and he still remains a
dangerous man for any team to pit
brains against.
McCreery will be remembered- as
the classic character who believed, at
one time, in advertising all over the
bay region. He has his name plastered
on almost every signboard and sign
around Palo Alto, and is, in fact, a
much better football player than he is
a sign perpetrator. McCreery plays
center on the Club outfit.
If you're good at cross-word puzzles
you might try figuring out the name
of the man who will play safety man
tomorrow. It would probably be as in
correct as the next fellow's guess.
