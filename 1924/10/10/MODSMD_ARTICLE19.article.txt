# JORDAN POINTS OUT GREAT IMPROVEMENT IN EUROPEAN LIFE
## 
### 
The general conditions in Europe
are now growing better, according to
Dr. Jordan in his talk at the Thursday
Evening Conference last night.
Germany promised to pay the ex
penses of the war, and in order to do
this slie sold mark notes, chiefly in the
United States. These decreased in
value after the first installments hart
been made; so Germany made a few
payments with lumber and gold. In
restoring France, more was paid for it
than it was worth. Thus there started
a "race for the abyss" between France
and Germany.
In speaking of the Russian revolu
tion, Dr. Jordan said, "No system of
government is worth killing people to
bring it about." The revolution was to
be bloodless, a perfect revolution, but
the opposition to the leaders made
this impossible.
