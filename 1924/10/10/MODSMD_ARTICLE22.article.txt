Plans formulated last Tuesday evening by the Rally Committee pro- !
ject something rather ambitious in the way of a student migration to
Los Angeles on November 8. Three special trains, two for students and
the other for northern alumni, will follow the "Lark" on its Friday
night trip, and returning will offer the option of leaving immediately :
after the game and spending Sunday 011 the campus, or dallying a day |
with the screen stars and reporting just in time for Monday morning
classes.
The committee is working' every conceivable angl # e for the.reduction
of expenses, and another organization is working out a plan which will
be a marvel of cheapness. However, students who may not wish to take I
advantage of the latter proposition will still find their desire to watch
the game rampant, and the accomplishment of that desire will take a
certain amount of money. Borrowing part of a phrase from the mil
lionaire-making correspondence schools, dig down into the laundry bag,
find that old sock, and drop the first nickel into it NOW.
Southern California is stated, by the experts on Market Street, to be
the toughest opposition the varsity will encounter. Time and observation
will either prove or discredit that statement, but right now it can be
stated for all time that it will be a football spectacle for the trained
observer or the thrill-seeker. Stanford will probablv move south for
two days, unless broke. The boat will run on steel rails, but get on the
boat anyhow. Blue-pencil the budget, stop sending orchids, and we'll
all be there together.
IT'S HARD, after all, to walk a mile for a Camel, and it cheats the
text-books. Seem's as though the new store in Encina would be a good
thing for all interested.
