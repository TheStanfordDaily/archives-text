"There are two ways to slide easily
through life: to believe everything, ur
to doubt everything; both ways save
us from thinking."
Stanford's relation to the University
of California may be 3 to 1 instead of
10 to 1 (as stated in Wednesday's col
umn! but the underlying theory works
just the same. "It is questionable mor
als to dismember a living frame to
seek for its hidden fountains of life."
—Wood row Wilson.
The difference between the Fresh
man and Sophomore classes as ex
hibited by Wednesday's fight was or
ganization and spirit—always the. de
ciding factor in any battle. The fresh
men, permeating question marks, came
streaming down the hill into Lagunita.
The sophomores, with a superb sense
of the dramatic, of course came
later. Their golden oiled shoulders
gleamed in the sun like bayonets.
They LOOKED savage. And ungreased
'28 succumbed.
Genius, plus an ability to work with
little food and less sleep, is a wonder
ful thing. So is champagne. But too
much, and Oh, the morning after!
If any newspaper in the United
States, excepting Stanford's, had an
nounced that David Starr Jordan would
be at home last night to discuss world
politics and finance it would have been
necessary to move the crowd to the
Assembly hall. But the "Daily" an
nounced it.
There is such a thing as being too
near a wonderful thing to appreciate
it. A class brawl will draw half the
student body (these statistics aren't
exact); but what about the things that
MEAN something?
A man and his wife in San Marcos,
Texas, just refused to accept $200,000
willed to them by a woman they did
not know, and newspapers are print
ing the story on the front page. It is
still considered unusual not to take
that which it is ethically wrong to
accept.
