Alto, are dying of Htarvation in Con
stantinople," says Mrs. Burt Estes i
Howard, chairman of a relief commit
tee. A meeting under the auspices or
the committee is to be held in the!
Little Theatre at 7:30 next Wednes
day night.
The refugees are mainly of the!
higher elasses of Russia, trained men.!
artists, singers, etc.. but the Turkish'
edicts prohibit the employment of all
non-Moslems. France is the country!
offering the most opportunities to
these destitute people, and it is for
transportation that funds are being i
raised.
