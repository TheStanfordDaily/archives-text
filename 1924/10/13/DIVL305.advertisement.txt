Every Parent
Loves his children
Tonight, daddy, take a package of WRIGLEY*S to
the kiddies. Mother, too, will appreciate it.
Doctors and dentists »ay that WRIGLEY'S helps
to keep the teeth clean and the mouth wholesome
and sweet.

It is an aid to digestion, too, so convalescents are
given WRIGLEY*S to stimulate stomach action and

WRIGLEY'S after smokes cools and refreshes.
