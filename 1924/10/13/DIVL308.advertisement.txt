There is nothing like a
STETSON
\
y° un g men today
know the importance of
Is3qH looking fit. Good ap
pearance counts much
in the game of life.' The young
man who dcesses with taste has
a decided advantage.

thought the average man gives
to his hat. It is his crown, yet he
seems to stop dressing at the neck.

your headwear. When you buy a
