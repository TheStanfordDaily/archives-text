# DRAMATIC SEASON OPENED By CLEVER ENGLISH COMEDY
## "The Dover Road" Lives Up To Advance Notices; Gordon Davis Stars 
### Beatrice Flesher 
There's a reason for everything, and
as soon as Gordon Davis, Stanford
dramatics coach, stepped upon the As
sembly hall stage Friday night the
audience understood the reason for
the second production of A. A. Milne's
â– "The Dover Road."
Davis had the part of the rich, ec
centric bachelor whose hobby is ar
resting couples running down the
Dover Road toward matrimony. In
this part, Davis serenely surveys the
amazing results of his experiments
and carries the burden of making the
play the charming offering it was Fri
day.
Davis Bright Light
Experienced actons in the support
ing cast made Coach Davis' task more
easy. Although at other times Davis
has played a part in a show which he
also was directing, never before have
bis efforts met with such success.
A. GroVe Day, with his timely as
sistance to his master, buttled so cap
ably that some matrons may try to
persuade him to take up the vocation
for life.
The discouraging fact that at least
four of the people concerned :n the
action of the play having matrimonial
intentions at the beginning have de
cidedly lost them at the conclusion oi
the action, may be accountable to the
breakfast scenes.
Breakfast a Revelation
What sage prescribed a sight of the
lover at breakfast as a cure for the
love-lorn? Whoever he was could have
had no better examples than the two
early-morning meals in the second
act. Leonard, played by Charles Si
mons. may have convulsed the audi
ence with his bearded countenance,
and his noisy cold, but consider the
effect on the bride-to-be.
Eustacia, played by Carolyn From
berg, seemed the picture of sweet so
licitation on first sight, but after the
arithmetical calculations of Norris
James, in the part of Nicholas, one is
shown that attention may have a tinge
of the bitter-sweet.
Anne's Personality Pleasing
Standing out as one of the rational
figures in this most grotesque of situ
ations is the character of Anne played
by Anne Gardner Wayland. As the
companion of the blundering Leonard,
Iter coolness and delightful appearance
made an effective contrast.
Having firmly established himsell
as a man who gives himself to unfor
tunate circumstance, Norris James
gives a sympathetic relief, when he
finds out that Leonard, Eustacia's hus
band, has arrived upon the scene.
The household staff, with their mys
thai air and evidence of perfect train- j
ing, are splendid additions to intensify
the fairy-tale atmosphere created for
guests entering into the "sort of a
hotel" into which the Latimer resi
dence has been converted.
The setting of the play was designed
by Chrysella Thinker, and was one of
the best pieces of work she has ever
done on a campus production.
The success of "The Dover Road",
seems to presage a good year f<y dra
matics, not only from a box-office
standpoint, but from the entertainment
angle as well. An unusually large
helped materially to make the
evening a financial success, which will
aid Gordon Davis in his plan of more
equipment for the Assembly hall stage.
