# FRESHMEN DEFEAT POLY ELEVEN. 97-0 IN LOPSIDED GAME
## Babes Score Fifteen Tallies With Strong Offense Led by Hill 
### Douglas Meservey 
Coach "Husky" Hunt scheduled a
football game last Saturday for his
freshman eleven with the California
Polytechnic College of San Luis
Obispo. The affair began and ended
as per schedule, with both aggrega-[
tiona in the customary uniforms, but
throughout there was a question in l
the minds of the onlookers whether it
was an orthodox football game or a
track meet.
To be sure, there were the usual j
formations, plays, et cetera, but the;
freshmen would insist upon getting
away for long runs with the Poly menj
streaming after them. The score, in;
passing, was said, by those who could I
write fast enough, to be 97 to 0. Just
a matter of fifteen touchdowns, or liu
average of one every four minutes.
Poly Is Inferior
The way the babes literally "ate up",
tlie yardage and made gaping holes in;
the college line was fine but, as a:
matter of fact, it was no true test of
their playing caliber. They were up
against a far inferior team that was
hazy on even fundamentals and the'
game amounted to nothing else but
slaughter or workout, call it either or
both as you will. Too, the Poly men.
had great difficulty in entwining their;
arms effectively around the babe legs
in tackling, and many a spectacular
run was made simply through that
weakness 011 the part of the visitors. 1
As for Hunt's proteges, they seemed
to be displaying both a good offense
and good defense, if one may accurate
ly judge from the way tffey played
the few times they met with any op-;
position. The backfield, without doubt, ;
would have done comparatively as
well if it had met a stronger eleven.;
It takes a clever back to do as well
as Hill, Millage. and Pabst did against
the Poly defense even though the lat
ter was "spongy," for time and again
each of the three men gained from
five to ten yards with two and three
tacklers hanging to them.
Hill Shifty Back
Hill, especially, has a clever and
useful side-step, which, together with
.a natural shiftiness, he used to make
