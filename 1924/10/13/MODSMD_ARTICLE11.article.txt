# ENCINA GOLF CLUB OUTLINES DEFINITE PLANS FOR SEASON
## 
### 
Babe golfers will form definite plans
for the coming season at the second
meeting of the Encina Golf club which
will be held in the Encina card room
at 7:15 tomorrow evening.
More than a score of links enthusi
asts turned out for the reorganization
meeting of the club last Tuesday. A.
R. Boscoe was elected president, Mac
Andrews, vice-president; and E. M
Quinn. secretary-treasurer.
it was decided to organize a six
man team and challenge the prep
schools of the peninsula and also the
California freshmen. A club tourna
ment. will also be staged in the near
future.
Judging from the interest mani
fested by the first-year men during
the last few days the Encina organiza
tion will be an even greater success
this year than in its first season. The
limit of fifty members is expected to
be enrolled at the second meeting.
If the handicaps given by the char
ter members are a true indication of
their playing ability the California
yearlings are doomed to a more crush
ing defeat this year than was handed
them by the 1927 men.
