# Stanford Band Issues Tickets for Dance to Be Given at "9 a.m."
## 
### 
Something distinctively new and
original is promised students by the,
Stanford band Friday. This organiza j
tion has issued tickets announcing a
dance in the pavilion at "9 a.m.,' i
which, if true, is undoubtedly a worth
while innovation, since it will Rive
tired students a golden opportunity to
cut classes for something really worth;
while.
However, the members of the band
balked at such a startling departure!
from conventionalities when they saw
their tickets, and so they have de-;
cided to be very orthodox and stage (
their dance at the usual polite hour o(.
9 p.m.
Tickets are on sale by all of the;
members of the band. Whitmer's or
chestra will furnish the music.
