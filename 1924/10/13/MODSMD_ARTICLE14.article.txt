## Resolution Recalls Musical And Literary Success Of Professor 
### 
The following resolutions were
| passed last Thursday night by the ,
; Academic Council at Stanford IJniver-:
| sity as an expression of its deep sense,
, of loss to the University by the death 1
of Prof. R. M. Alden at Philadelphia
' recently:
! "By the untimely death of Raymond j
Macdonald Alden the University loses j
a man of uncommon character and
1 uncommon breadth of endowments. As j
1 a man of letters and a scholar his out-j
standing trait was versatility. yis,
original research-work and his editing j
were thorough and judicious; his liter-'
1 ary criticism showed sympathy and
;{ finesse, grasp of fact, human insight j
: and a constant sense of values. Be-!
side this he showed talent and won 1
; success in imaginative writing, by his i
j cleverness and feeling in fiction, and i
j his skill, sense of beauty and sincerity!
i' in the writing of verse. He was also '
} well trained and able as a musician j
on both piano and organ. His teaching ;
was highly valued especially by more
• mature and discriminating students, |
i particualrly for its earnestness, pa- j
i tience and discrimination. He was,
! willing in an emergency to teach any j
i part of the field of English literature,
j but he was less inclined toward that
[ historical study which ignores values
i 1 than to the interpretation of the
s greater spiritual masters. In univer
, sity administration he was interested,
•experienced and successful, owing to
his farsight, grasp of essentials, pa-;
i tience, appreciation of other points of
view than his own, and above all
moderation. In all things his view was
fixed onjdeals. These traits he showed
[ both in the University of Illinois,
' where he was for three years head of
a very large department, and at Stan
; ford, where he was for two years the
I more constitutional executive, and for
i many years one of the chief moving
i forces of his department. This combi
nation of powers made him one of the
most capable and harmoniously devel
, oped academic men whom we have
ever known.
! "His powers and his success were,
in a striking way, the result of his
i character, which combined strength
and finesse. His tastes were simple
, and domestic and harmonized with his
, heavy family responsibilities. He
could enter with vigor and spirit into
. occupations to which he was not used
an<i among his friends he was free
and-easy and showed a droll humor.
His self-control and courtesy were
> combined with a strong sense of duty
and responsibility. One of the chief
moving forces oX his nature was strong
, religious convictions and emotions,
and he was a conscientious and ortho
dox, though liberal. Christian. None
- of his qualities were more conspicu
ous than his courage, which was put
to a severe test during the suffering.
I tedium and discouragement of long
and distressing*illness.
"He was born in 1873, received the
degrees of A.B. and Ph.D. at the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania, and thrft of
A.M. at Harvard. After holding minor
> appointments in several institutions,
he came to Stanford in 1899 and ex
j cept for his absence of three years at 1
the University of Illinois he has \
rounded out a quarter of a century of
i varied service to our University, be- j
sides receiving many signs of recogni- \
! tion from other institutions and or-!
i gfuiizations.
"RESOLVED: That the Academic:
i Council of Stanford University hereby '
I expresses its deep sense of the loss to
, the University and its personal loss in •
j the (leyHi of Professor Alden; and that
j copies of this memorial be transmitted
| to his family and to the president of
j the Board of Trustees and be entered
| in the minutes of the Council."
