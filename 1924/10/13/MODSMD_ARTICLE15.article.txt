# NEW SONG CONTEST IS SPONSORED BY RALLY COMMITTEE
## 
### 
Now- comes the announcement of a
new contest, this time sponsored by
none other than the ifcilly committee.
It is thought that because the U. S. C.
games have become of so much im
portance, Stanford should have a song
which can be sung only at these
events.
Something new and snappy is want
ed. The tune does not have to be
original, but the words should be origi
nal and adaptable to any IT. S. C.
game. In other words, the writer
should not make them for the game of
November 8 alone.
The contest is scheduled to close
October 20, which will allow plenty of
time for the student body to learn the
new song before the migration to the
City of the Angels. The names of live
persons who have been selected to
judge the songs will be announced
shortly. Incidentally, aside from the
honor of having his song selected, the
winner of the contest will be awarded
ten dollars to buy peanuts at U. S. C.
games in years to come.
