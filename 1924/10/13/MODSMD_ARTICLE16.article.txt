# CARDS SQUEEZE THROUGH 1-0 VICTORY OVER OLYMPIC CLUB
## Stanford Lacks Necessary Punch to Consistently Penetrate Clubmen's Line: Bogue Stars at Full 
### David Meiklejohn 
DESPITE several desperate attempts to appear as a Rood football machine,
in A1 condition, well overhauled and cared tor, the Stanford varsity eleven
I was hard put to defeat the scrappy pig-skin aggregation from the Olympic
i Club 7 to 0 last Saturday afternoon in the stadium.
The spectacle reminded the spectator a great deal of a dog who chases
his tail around in a circle, without knowing what has bitten him. The Cards
appeared dazed all through the lirst half, woke up a little bit in the third
quarter, and continued the rest of the game in a tantrum. Meanwhile the
onlookers were having tantrums of their own. For every helmet that was

> thrown down in disgust there were a
dozen good dinks, sombreros, and what
you will, badly in need of rejuvenation
before tlw game ended.
Defense Strong
The only redeeming feature was the
work of the Stanford defense. The one
reason, perhaps, that the Olympic
Club didn't take victory home to San
Francisco was because Stanford had
a line that couldjdug any hole opened
for inspection. "Scotchy" Campbell
tried hard to squirm his way through
the line several times, succeeded at
times, only to be thrown for losses
repeatedly.
The work of the Cardinal ends was
good. Both Jim Lawson and Ted
Shipkey, who was substituted for
Thomas early in the game, were be
yond reproach. Lawson was always a
jump ahead of the rest of the line to
tackle a kicker; he snagged two diffi
cult passes and made good gains 011
each. On the whole, I*awson played
the game that was expected of him.
Nevers Needed
There will be a lot of howling in the
next week or two about the stringent
I need for a quarterback; the same old
j bark about the safety man will gather
force and break all bounds. Perhaps
Stanford does need a quarterback and
a safety man, but it looked as if the
Card's real need was for Ernie Nevers.
Stanford needed a kicker and didn't
have one. Instead the varsity was
forced to begin from Olympic territory
and buck the ball down the field and
I the strain told on the men who had to
I carry the heavier part of the burden.
| George Bogue made a name for him
self in Saturday's game. He was power
behind the restorative that gave Stan
ford the opportunity to look like a

burden on repeated criss-cross fakes
