# CARDS SQUEEZE THROUGH 1-0 VICTORY OVER OLYMPIC CLUB
## Stanford Lacks Necessary Punch to Consistently Penetrate Clubmen's Line: Bogue Stars at Full 
### David Meiklejohn 
DESPITE several desperate attempts to appear as a Rood football machine,
in A1 condition, well overhauled and cared tor, the Stanford varsity eleven
I was hard put to defeat the scrappy pig-skin aggregation from the Olympic
i Club 7 to 0 last Saturday afternoon in the stadium.
The spectacle reminded the spectator a great deal of a dog who chases
his tail around in a circle, without knowing what has bitten him. The Cards
appeared dazed all through the lirst half, woke up a little bit in the third
quarter, and continued the rest of the game in a tantrum. Meanwhile the
onlookers were having tantrums of their own. For every helmet that was

> thrown down in disgust there were a
dozen good dinks, sombreros, and what
you will, badly in need of rejuvenation
before tlw game ended.
Defense Strong
The only redeeming feature was the
work of the Stanford defense. The one
reason, perhaps, that the Olympic
Club didn't take victory home to San
Francisco was because Stanford had
a line that couldjdug any hole opened
for inspection. "Scotchy" Campbell
tried hard to squirm his way through
the line several times, succeeded at
times, only to be thrown for losses
repeatedly.
The work of the Cardinal ends was
good. Both Jim Lawson and Ted
Shipkey, who was substituted for
Thomas early in the game, were be
yond reproach. Lawson was always a
jump ahead of the rest of the line to
tackle a kicker; he snagged two diffi
cult passes and made good gains 011
each. On the whole, I*awson played
the game that was expected of him.
Nevers Needed
There will be a lot of howling in the
next week or two about the stringent
I need for a quarterback; the same old
j bark about the safety man will gather
force and break all bounds. Perhaps
Stanford does need a quarterback and
a safety man, but it looked as if the
Card's real need was for Ernie Nevers.
Stanford needed a kicker and didn't
have one. Instead the varsity was
forced to begin from Olympic territory
and buck the ball down the field and
I the strain told on the men who had to
I carry the heavier part of the burden.
| George Bogue made a name for him
self in Saturday's game. He was power
behind the restorative that gave Stan
ford the opportunity to look like a
| real football machine. He carried the
burden on repeated criss-cross fakes
I through the Olympic line; he plunged
j through tackle for long gains, and
after packing the ball to the Olympic,
Club one-yard line he went over for
Stanford's lone touchdown. Bogue's
work was encouraging. It gave the'
football fans an excuse to stay and
see what would happen.
Stanford Threatens
Stanford threatened to score again
early in the fourth period. Again the
Cards put the ball 011 the fourteen
yard line. Cleaveland went around
right tackle, but failed to gain. Bogue
plunged through center for live yards,
then followed with four through right;
guard. Three yards more through the
right of the Olympic line, with Bogue
carry the ball, put Stanford on the
Olympic two-yard line, when the Cards!
were penalized live yards for off-side. 1
Cleaveland brought the ball back two!
yards and a half, Bogue plunged,
through tackle for four yards, and
just missed scoring by six inches 011
the fourth down. Somebody got sassy;
and the referee penalized Stanford I
fifteen yards for talking back. This]
gave Slater, of the Olympic Club, a;
chance to kick out of danger.
The game ended with the ball on
the Olympic Club twelve-yard line.

in A1 condition, well overhauled and cared tor, the Stanford varsity eleven
I was hard put to defeat the scrappy pig-skin aggregation from the Olympic
i Club 7 to 0 last Saturday afternoon in the stadium.
The spectacle reminded the spectator a great deal of a dog who chases
his tail around in a circle, without knowing what has bitten him. The Cards
appeared dazed all through the lirst half, woke up a little bit in the third
quarter, and continued the rest of the game in a tantrum. Meanwhile the
onlookers were having tantrums of their own. For every helmet that was

> thrown down in disgust there were a
dozen good dinks, sombreros, and what
you will, badly in need of rejuvenation
before tlw game ended.
Defense Strong
The only redeeming feature was the
work of the Stanford defense. The one
reason, perhaps, that the Olympic
Club didn't take victory home to San
Francisco was because Stanford had
a line that couldjdug any hole opened
for inspection. "Scotchy" Campbell
tried hard to squirm his way through
the line several times, succeeded at
times, only to be thrown for losses
repeatedly.
The work of the Cardinal ends was
good. Both Jim Lawson and Ted
Shipkey, who was substituted for
Thomas early in the game, were be
yond reproach. Lawson was always a
jump ahead of the rest of the line to
tackle a kicker; he snagged two diffi
cult passes and made good gains 011
each. On the whole, I*awson played
the game that was expected of him.
Nevers Needed
There will be a lot of howling in the
next week or two about the stringent
I need for a quarterback; the same old
j bark about the safety man will gather
force and break all bounds. Perhaps
Stanford does need a quarterback and
a safety man, but it looked as if the
Card's real need was for Ernie Nevers.
Stanford needed a kicker and didn't
have one. Instead the varsity was
forced to begin from Olympic territory
and buck the ball down the field and
I the strain told on the men who had to
I carry the heavier part of the burden.
| George Bogue made a name for him
self in Saturday's game. He was power
behind the restorative that gave Stan
ford the opportunity to look like a
| real football machine. He carried the
burden on repeated criss-cross fakes
I through the Olympic line; he plunged
j through tackle for long gains, and
after packing the ball to the Olympic,
Club one-yard line he went over for
Stanford's lone touchdown. Bogue's
work was encouraging. It gave the'
football fans an excuse to stay and
see what would happen.
Stanford Threatens
Stanford threatened to score again
early in the fourth period. Again the
Cards put the ball 011 the fourteen
yard line. Cleaveland went around
right tackle, but failed to gain. Bogue
plunged through center for live yards,
then followed with four through right;
guard. Three yards more through the
right of the Olympic line, with Bogue
carry the ball, put Stanford on the
Olympic two-yard line, when the Cards!
were penalized live yards for off-side. 1
Cleaveland brought the ball back two!
yards and a half, Bogue plunged,
through tackle for four yards, and
just missed scoring by six inches 011
the fourth down. Somebody got sassy;
and the referee penalized Stanford I
fifteen yards for talking back. This]
gave Slater, of the Olympic Club, a;

The spectacle reminded the spectator a great deal of a dog who chases
his tail around in a circle, without knowing what has bitten him. The Cards
appeared dazed all through the lirst half, woke up a little bit in the third
quarter, and continued the rest of the game in a tantrum. Meanwhile the
onlookers were having tantrums of their own. For every helmet that was

> thrown down in disgust there were a
dozen good dinks, sombreros, and what
you will, badly in need of rejuvenation
before tlw game ended.
Defense Strong
The only redeeming feature was the
work of the Stanford defense. The one
reason, perhaps, that the Olympic
Club didn't take victory home to San
Francisco was because Stanford had
a line that couldjdug any hole opened
for inspection. "Scotchy" Campbell
tried hard to squirm his way through
the line several times, succeeded at
times, only to be thrown for losses
repeatedly.
The work of the Cardinal ends was
good. Both Jim Lawson and Ted
Shipkey, who was substituted for
Thomas early in the game, were be
yond reproach. Lawson was always a
jump ahead of the rest of the line to
tackle a kicker; he snagged two diffi
cult passes and made good gains 011
each. On the whole, I*awson played
the game that was expected of him.
Nevers Needed
There will be a lot of howling in the
next week or two about the stringent
I need for a quarterback; the same old
j bark about the safety man will gather
force and break all bounds. Perhaps
Stanford does need a quarterback and
a safety man, but it looked as if the
Card's real need was for Ernie Nevers.
Stanford needed a kicker and didn't
have one. Instead the varsity was
forced to begin from Olympic territory
and buck the ball down the field and
I the strain told on the men who had to
I carry the heavier part of the burden.
| George Bogue made a name for him
self in Saturday's game. He was power
behind the restorative that gave Stan
ford the opportunity to look like a
| real football machine. He carried the
burden on repeated criss-cross fakes
I through the Olympic line; he plunged
j through tackle for long gains, and
after packing the ball to the Olympic,
Club one-yard line he went over for
Stanford's lone touchdown. Bogue's
work was encouraging. It gave the'
football fans an excuse to stay and
see what would happen.
Stanford Threatens
Stanford threatened to score again
early in the fourth period. Again the
Cards put the ball 011 the fourteen
yard line. Cleaveland went around
right tackle, but failed to gain. Bogue
plunged through center for live yards,
then followed with four through right;
guard. Three yards more through the
right of the Olympic line, with Bogue
carry the ball, put Stanford on the
Olympic two-yard line, when the Cards!
were penalized live yards for off-side. 1
Cleaveland brought the ball back two!
yards and a half, Bogue plunged,
through tackle for four yards, and
just missed scoring by six inches 011
the fourth down. Somebody got sassy;
and the referee penalized Stanford I
fifteen yards for talking back. This]
gave Slater, of the Olympic Club, a;
chance to kick out of danger.
The game ended with the ball on
the Olympic Club twelve-yard line.

DESPITE several desperate attempts to appear as a Rood football machine,
