Dr. Haber is professor of chemistryi
in the University of Berlin, and fori
the past ten years has been one of
the outstanding men in this field, ac-j
cording to Professor Swain, of the
Chemistry department. His most wide-,
ly-known contribution to science is
the synthesis of ammonia through the
union of atmospheric nitrogen, thus l
adding another commercial feasible
process to the few already known for!
meeting the demand for nitrogen in a I
combined form. He was awarded the!
Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1918 in
recognition of his work, and holds a
