# FRATERNITIES RULE TO STAY INITIATION UNTIL NEXT AUTUMN
## 
### 
A few additions to the rushing rules
j adopted by the Interfraternity Confer
ence and which were published in
j these columns recently are contained
I in letters sent todav. to all the fra
ternities on the campus.
One radical change from last year's
| system is that there shall be no initia
tion until the following fall quarter of
j any men pledged at a formal bidding
date or thereafter. This will extend the
• | pledgeship over the summer vacation
■! months.
The rule prohibiting freshmen from
,j "hashing" in fraternity houses has
. been changed so that a first year man
II will be allowed to secure a waiter's
,j job if he obtains the recommendation
j of the General Manager's office or the
Appointment Office and the subse
. quent ratification of such recommenda
i tions by the Board of Control.
,] Those students who have completed
t ; ninety or more units of credit in the
' University, or who are upper division
I students, may be pledged before they
j have completed a year's residence at
. this University, provided: that notices
,j have been sent to all other fraterni
J ties by the secretary of the Board of
lj Control and they have been previously
,j declared eligible by the Chairman of
,( the Board of Control.
