Nearly fifty-three thousand dollars was last year's contribution to the
student body, made by the Appointment Office in the Administration
Building. This amount was earned by 1612 students who are enthusiastic
enough over a college education to go out and buy it themselves.
This is an enviable record, both from the standpoint of the office and
of the self-supporting Stanford man or woman. It would hardly seem,
to the casual observer, that the -community around Stanford University
could furnish enough part-time work to bring in such a respectable sum
of money. Part of this, of course, was not earned but saved by the pro
cess of working for board, or room, or any of eight combinations listed.
The grand total under this classification reaches $21,247. Typing made
something over four thousand dollars for those who registered with the
Employment Office, and a little more than one thousand dollars were
earned by reading aloud. Cooking brought in over three thousand.
The Office works on the principle of placing the students who most
deserve work in the positions for which they are best suited. Operating
with the backing and prestige of the University, it is an ideal agent for
centralized control of the employment situation. Last year, 309 positions
were available for which no students applied, but at the present time there
is a small but important "army of unemployed" which indicates that times
are hard, according to the Office barometer.

Nearly fifty-three thousand dollars was last year's contribution to the
student body, made by the Appointment Office in the Administration
Building. This amount was earned by 1612 students who are enthusiastic
enough over a college education to go out and buy it themselves.
This is an enviable record, both from the standpoint of the office and
of the self-supporting Stanford man or woman. It would hardly seem,
to the casual observer, that the -community around Stanford University
could furnish enough part-time work to bring in such a respectable sum
of money. Part of this, of course, was not earned but saved by the pro
cess of working for board, or room, or any of eight combinations listed.
The grand total under this classification reaches $21,247. Typing made
something over four thousand dollars for those who registered with the
Employment Office, and a little more than one thousand dollars were
earned by reading aloud. Cooking brought in over three thousand.
The Office works on the principle of placing the students who most
deserve work in the positions for which they are best suited. Operating
with the backing and prestige of the University, it is an ideal agent for
centralized control of the employment situation. Last year, 309 positions
were available for which no students applied, but at the present time there
is a small but important "army of unemployed" which indicates that times
are hard, according to the Office barometer.
