Gordon Davis
Merrie Times
Class-room Education
Dr. Gardner
Gordon Davis did not "act" Friday
evening in "The Dover Road;" he
thought his way through the part. He
has that uncommon faculty of expres
sion through repression. Behind his
slightest action one felt a great re
serve power; and above all, he didn't
"emote."
With Premier Zaghoul Pasha of
Egypt threatening, an almost immedi
ate revolt against England; and Mo
handas Gandhi, India Nationalist lead
er and idol of all India, in jail and at
the point of death from fasting; Par
liament dissolved- and a split in the
Labor party imminent, England seems
to be having a right "merrie time."
No morans or mental defectives will
be found here at Stanford; none-the
less you would be surprised what a
wide variety of Man is collected,
should you but take the time to look
about a little.
Someone has said, "Blessed are the
cool, calm friendships that die a na
tural death, leaving neither death nor
rancor." Yesterday, in church, Dr.
Gardner said, "It is a shame to spoil
the fine friendship of youth with
sloppy love-making, and insincere pro
fessions; .... to be unable'to enjoy
moonlight without becoming senti
mental." It isn't Shameful; it is-piti
ful. Few people RISE to love; they
FALL into it.
Henry Ford had barely a grade'
school education; yet how many men I
and women in this University, amid
the finest of opportunities for starting
"trains of thought," can say of them
selves what has been said of Mr.
Foid: "His mind has vast reaches of
virgin soil and he is continually tilling
that soil. His is a twenty-track mind.j
with trains coming in constantly. And
some of the trains were started a
LONG TIME AGO."
