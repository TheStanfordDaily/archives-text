"More than twice the number of
Stanford students are applying for
work this quarter than at the same
time last year, and most of them need
it badly." This statement was made
Mrs. Snell, head of the appointment
office. "There is always a large per
centage of Stanford men and women
who are dependent to a great extent
upon the mouey they earn during the
school year. This year the situation is
more acute due largely to the drought
which has affected the agriculture all
over the state and the political situa
tion which has unsettled business
everywhere."
The tuition notes and loan fund have
been called upon more heavily than
ever before. There are more students
wanting work than can be supplied.
The functions of the appointment of
fice are very well known to students
of the University but there are many
people in Palo Alto and Mayfteld who
have never heard of it and there are
doubtless some of these who would
be glad to avail themselves of the
service it offers.
Both faculty and students are urged
to co-operate with Mrs. Snell and her
assistants by acquainting the public
with this office and its service.
