# GORDON DAVIS WINS WIDE SUCCESS WITH SUMMER DRAMATICS
## Greek Tragedy Is Presented On Steps of Museum; Attracts Many 
### Charles Simons 
Gordon Davis, Stanford's versatile and j
resourceful dramatic coach, scored three j
hits in a row during the summer quarter ,
in his newest innovation along dramatic
lines. Upsetting precedent and fooling
tlie wiseacres, Davis planned and ex
ecuted with remarkable success what he ,
termed a summer season of drama. In- j
stead of having mediocre audiences, the j
Assembly hall was well-nigh full for the ,
two legitimate productions, and * the j
Greek tragedy, Oedipus Rex, which con- '
stituted the third offering, was almost a J
sell-out proposition.
An extensive advertising campaign, j
under the direction of Paul Bissinger, j
who served as business manager for the I
season, drew people from all over the
peninsula. The keynote of the adver
tising was the phrase, "Stanford Uni
versity presents—" and this seemed to
give the public more confidence in the
merit of the productions than they have
had heretofore when a show was adver- ,
tised as being given by some group in |
the University.
Davis Stars
The first production had for its leading J
man Gordon Davis himself, and was ac
claimed as one of the best comedies seen |
in years. This was given again on Octo- ,
her 10, and another article in this issue will
describe it in detail.
Two weeks after the "Dover Road,"
the second, production was ready for the I
curtain. "Icebound." by Owen Davis, j
the winner of the 1922 Pulitzer prize j
for the best American drama played to j
almost a capacity audience, and made
even more of a hit than the "Dover j
Road." Hattie Mae Mixon and Phil |
Urner distinguished themselves in the |
leading roles, and the rest of the cast
was faultlessly chosen by Gordon Davis.
With the •limited number of students to
choose from, Davis worked out a very
strong cast ,and had every character true
to life.
The setting for "Icebound" was de
signed by Les Kiler, who has . helped i
make many a Stanford show a success, J
and it was executed by Kiler and Chry- !
sella Dunkcr.
'■'Oedipus Rex" Given
The third and last offering was the j
Greek tragedy by Sophocles, "Oedipus
Rex." Miss Evalyn Thomas, from the 1
Southern. Branch of the University of j
California, who had already produced |
"Oedipus Rex" in Los Angeles, was in- j
vited to Stanford to work with Gordon j
I )avis. Rehearsals were started almost a
month before the date set for presenta- j
tion, and a cast and chorus of seventy- j
five worked twice daily to make Stan- j
ford's first attempt at Greek tragedy a !
success.
Charles Morris, the famous novelist, in !
a letter written afterwards to Gordon
Davis, expressed the impression made by
"Oedipus Rex" on most every one in the j
audience. "I came," said Norris, "more]
out of respect for you and what you
arc trying to do at Stanford than from
a desire to see Greek tragedy 'executed'

by a bunch of gangly-legged, thin-voiced
college youths, shivering in the night air.
I remained fascinated at the beauty, the
power, the perfection of detail which
was evident throughout the whole pro
duction, and I must admit I have never
enjoyed anything of the kind any better
than I did last night's play."
Tremendous Success
"Oedipus Rex" was a tremendous suc
cess, and received favorable comment
from everyone in attendance. Coming as
it did at the end of the summer quarter,
it was a fitting climax to Gordon Davis'
work of the term.
Francis Hickson played the part of
Oedipus, and Dorothy Wilson took the
role of Jocasta, his wife. Every one of
the cast and chorus was letter perfect in
his part, and the ensemble recitations
were particularly. gOod.:
Hume West came up from Los An
geles to assist the University electricians
in the lighting arrangements. These were
in a great measure responsible for the
success of the play, which was given on
the steps of the Stanford Museum.
The summer season of drama suc
ceeded beyond the wildest dreams of its
originator, and Gordon Davis is to be
congratulated not only for the enter
tainment which lie provided, but more es
pecially for the recognition he has gained
for Stanford in the eyes of the general
public, is being a University where dra
matic efforts are taken seriously and
produced in as nearly perfect a manner
as possible.
