## 
### 
Attempting to create greater inter
est in intercollegiate news and to
speed up the transmission of it, the
Radio Club of the University of Ari
zona sent out a circular to all active
College Radio Clubs recently asking
them to co-operate in the formation of
a League. The plan is to have every
club in the league co-operate with its
college daily paper and nightly broad
cast news items of the day's activities
on the campus.
For some time the University of
California has been broadcasting cam
pus news items through the KLX
broadcasting station in Berkeley. This
has been found so successful that
plans are now under way for the uni
versity to establish their own broad
casting station. The club there is very
much interested in the formation of
the Radio Club League and is work
ing toward its formation.
The club on the Stanford campus
recently brought the matter up for
discussion and found much in its favor
but is at present handicapped by in
competent facilities. A short wave
transmitter and two receivers for short
wave reception down to forty metres
are now under construction.
This equipment would not carry far
but there are possibilities that, if the
service proved successful, the club
could get the use of the high-powered
set belonging to the University. This
would permit the broadcasting to be
done by radio telephone for the Club
set would necessitate broadcasting by
telegraph.
