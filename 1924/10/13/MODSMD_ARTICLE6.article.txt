# PROFESSOR ELMORE WILL LECTURE ON GREECE AND ITALY
## Stanford Professor Will Tell Of Recent Excavations On Isle of Crete 
### 
"Crete is one of the most interesting
places I have visited." remarked Pro
j lessor Jefferson Elmore, of the Classi
! cal Literature department, whose sub
! ject for the lecture in the .Little Thea-
J tre at 7:30 Tuesday evening is "Some
' Recent Observations of Greece and
i Italy."
! "The excavations at the ancient
,j Knossos have resulted in some of the
most remarkable discoveries in his
tory," he continued. "They have dis
j closed a civilization whose existence
was not suspected a quarter of a cen
j tury ago, and " they have greatly
j changed our conception of early Greek
, sculpture. History in this case has
i! been pushed back two thousand
,j years."
Englishman Contributes
The man who is responsible for this
contribution is the English archaeolo
gist. Sir Arthur Evans. As a professor
I at Oxford he was at first interested in
prehistoric writing. At Athens, in
1893, he saw sortie curious seal-stones
; cut with designs which he thought
might be characters for writing.
, "When he found these stones came
from Crete, he made a tour of the
Island," explained Professor Elmore.
"He secured a large collection of
j seals and gems from which he was
i able to show that writing existed in
the Mediterranean world centuries
earlier than had been previously
thought."
It was while on this trip that Sir
Arthur decided to excavate the site
of Knossos, famed in writing for the
great palace of King Minos. The work
of excavating, which has been carried
. on for twenty-three years, is now near
; ing completion, and additional data is
, being sought.
