ED ZWIERLEIN'S STANFORD SHOE NOTES
fK J \) < <X \
Bought for no one else
but you
Among our smart styles of shoes are several that we would
not attempt to sell to business men.
These handsome sport shoes were ordered specifically for
Stanford men. They are different; but not freakish.
Above we picture a crepe soled shoe. It's great for Quad
wear. Ask to see the "Big 3" —Craftsman, College, and Ruff
Boy—hits of the year.
