# RUSSIAN RELIEF 10 BE PLANNED ON WEDNESDAY
## President Wilbur Will Talk at Meeting for Aid in Constantinople 
### 
President Wilbur will preside at a
meeting for the Relief of Russian
Refugees in Constantinople to be held
in the Little Theatre at 7:30 Wednes
day night. The speakers will include
Mrs. Burt Estes Howard, founder of
the relief movement, and a representa
tive of the refugees.
A recent cable from Admiral Bristol
states that 5000 persons, includng
women and children, hitherto support
ing themselves, have been thrown out
of work by the recent Turkish decree
against the employment of foreigners.
As a result they are in desperate
straits.
The situation in Constantinople was
brought about, according to authori
ties, by two factors: the disbanding
of the famous White Army in and
around that city, and the anti-alien
attitude adopted by the Turks, result
ing in the inability of the refugees to
secure any kind of work.
France Gives Opportunities
France is the country offering the
refugees the most opportunities. Ad
miral Bristol says, "$50,000 is imme
diately needed for evacuation. Trans
portation to France can be had at ap
proximately $15 per head, including
food en route. Evacuation will proceed
as fast as funds can be provided. In
the meantime, the people must be fed
and housed."
Everything in the way of trade is
taxed out of existence, many lines of
work being closed to all but Moslem
Turks. Thirty-five hundred Russians,
who had been self-supporting because
they fished on the Black Sea, are now
forbidden fishing permits, or even to
mend nets.
The desire of the people to keep the
country for the Moslem Turk only, is
manifesting itself in various ways. It
is considered a crime for any but a
Moslem to act as a guide, even though
he knows little or no English.
"The refugees are mainly of the
higher classes of Russia," says Mrs.
Howard, "and we feel # that the world
cannot afford to lose the services of
these professional men."
Mrs. Howard is chairman of the re
lief committee, which includes: Dr.
Wilbur, I)r. Gardner, Mrs. John Mitch
ell, Mr. Philip Lansdale, Mrs. Fred
Wickett, Mrs. Stanley Forbes, Mrs.
William Nichols, Mrs. Robert Kirk
wood, Mrs. David Starr Jordan, Cap
lain Beach Thompson, Mrs. Clark
Whittier. Professor Edwin Cottrell.
Miss Emma Breed, Mrs. William Jor
ret, Mrs. Charles Bransten, Mrs. Leroy
Smith, and the Rev. W. B. Thorpe.
