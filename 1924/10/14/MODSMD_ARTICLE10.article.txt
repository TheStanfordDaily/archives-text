# BEARDSLEY GREETS NEW STUDENTS IN ASSEMBLY
## Welcomes 1928 as the Best Freshman Class At First Undergraduate Gathering 
### 
With a challenge to. enter into the
University life here and make the best
of the four years, "Chuck" Beardsley,
president of the Associated Students,
welcomed the class of '28 into the stu
dent body.
"You are the best freshman class I
have ever seen here," he complimented
them. "There have been more 'hellos'
on the campus, more willing wearing
of dinks, and other evidences of keep
ing customs sacred to Stanford. You
have the Stanford spirit without a
doubt."
Freshmen Good Athletes
All this he noted in addition to the
fact that scholastically and athletically

they gave great promise for the fu
ture.
By way of introduction to the gov
ernment and activities on the campus,
Carolan Strouse, president of the As
sociated Women Students; Alan
Charles, chairman of Men's Council,
and William L. Wright, editor of the
Daily Palo Alto, gave talks.
Co-operation for Ideals
The plea which Miss Strouse gave
was for one of co-operation between
men and women students in uphold
ing the ideals and standards of the
University.
In making this point, she used the
examples of the unfair attitude of the
woman who will let a frosh "queen"
her on Quad, and the same attitude
of the man who does not think of the
"lock-out" regulations concerning wo
men, of enough importance to observe.
Of the women and their activities
as a whole, she observed, "Since there
are only 500 women, we must make up
in pep for numbers, in order to be
an active part of the University."
Responsibility Essential
Alan Charles, in describing the
work and procedure of the Men's
Council, which is the judiciary depart
ment of Stanford government, said,
"If the students will meet the respon
sibilities of student control, it will
hold its own, and may go a few steps
forward."
Progress has already been made, ac
cording to Charles. This year, he pre
dicts that the Council will take a
strong attitude against violations of
the honor system, and against drink
ing.
Journalism Offers Benefits
With a description of the publica
tions on the campus, Wright told of
the opportunities and benefits offered
in journalism.
"Each freshman class furnishes four
editors and three business managers
for campus publications.," he said. '
These are the two editors of the Daily J
Palo Alto, each serving a half year, ;
and the editors of Chaparral, and
Quad. Then are the business managers J
for the three publications.
As requisites for journalism, Wright j
prescribed, "Those who are not i
geniuses often get along better than j
those who are. A fair knowledge of j
grammar is the one requirement, and
the rest of the knowledge needed
comes with experience."
He continued that this experience
would be one of the most helpful
things in after life.
Along the line of permanent produc
tions for Stanford, Wright mentioned
the song-writing contest, which is ex
pected to bring forth more music for
future football games.
Winning Spirit Necessary
Since Captain Jim Lawson, of this
years squad, was unable to come,
Beardsley took upon himself the task
of predicting victory fqr this year.
"The essential thing in the battle with
California," he asserted, "is that we
go over there in a winning frame of
mind."
The class of '24 of Stanford attended
four Big Games, without a victory over
the Bear. Now there is a fine freshman
class at California this year, which
we hope will have the same kind of
a record, of four Big Games against
Stanford, with Stanford victory every
time."
Veil Leader "Dutch" McCallistetf.
with his assistants, gave the student
body practice in the yells and songs.
After explaining the running of the
student body, Beardsley read a letter
concerning the Russian Relief Fund,
which is the one charity drive con
ducted on the campus this quarter.
