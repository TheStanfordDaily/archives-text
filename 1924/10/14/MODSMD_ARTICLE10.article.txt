# BEARDSLEY GREETS NEW STUDENTS IN ASSEMBLY
## Welcomes 1928 as the Best Freshman Class At First Undergraduate Gathering 
### 
With a challenge to. enter into the
University life here and make the best
of the four years, "Chuck" Beardsley,
president of the Associated Students,
welcomed the class of '28 into the stu
dent body.
"You are the best freshman class I
have ever seen here," he complimented
them. "There have been more 'hellos'
on the campus, more willing wearing
of dinks, and other evidences of keep
ing customs sacred to Stanford. You
have the Stanford spirit without a
doubt."
Freshmen Good Athletes
All this he noted in addition to the
fact that scholastically and athletically

they gave great promise for the fu
ture.
By way of introduction to the gov
ernment and activities on the campus,
Carolan Strouse, president of the As
sociated Women Students; Alan
Charles, chairman of Men's Council,
and William L. Wright, editor of the
Daily Palo Alto, gave talks.
Co-operation for Ideals
The plea which Miss Strouse gave

men and women students in uphold

University.
In making this point, she used the
examples of the unfair attitude of the

of the man who does not think of the
"lock-out" regulations concerning wo
men, of enough importance to observe.
Of the women and their activities
as a whole, she observed, "Since there
are only 500 women, we must make up
in pep for numbers, in order to be
an active part of the University."
Responsibility Essential
Alan Charles, in describing the
work and procedure of the Men's
Council, which is the judiciary depart

"If the students will meet the respon
sibilities of student control, it will
hold its own, and may go a few steps
forward."
Progress has already been made, ac
cording to Charles. This year, he pre
dicts that the Council will take a
strong attitude against violations of
the honor system, and against drink
ing.
Journalism Offers Benefits
With a description of the publica
tions on the campus, Wright told of
the opportunities and benefits offered
in journalism.
"Each freshman class furnishes four
editors and three business managers
for campus publications.," he said. '
These are the two editors of the Daily J
Palo Alto, each serving a half year, ;
and the editors of Chaparral, and
Quad. Then are the business managers J
for the three publications.
As requisites for journalism, Wright j
prescribed, "Those who are not i
geniuses often get along better than j
those who are. A fair knowledge of j
