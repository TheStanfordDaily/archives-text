# DEBATE MEN FROM OXFORD WILL VISIT STANFORD CAMPUS
## Malcolm MacDonald, Son of English Premier, Will Be Leading Speaker 
### 
Malcolm Mac Donald, son of Premier
J. Ramsey Mac Donald of Great Brit
ain, and leader of the debating team
from the Oxford Union which is to
meet the Stanford speakers in the As-
Sembl Hall on January 15, will be on
the campus with his colleagues iti about
a week, according to word received
from his manager.
Mac Donald is 22 years old, and "just
down" from Oxford. With D. Wood
ruff and M. C. Hollis, he is to tour the
American continent, meeting thirty
Canadian and American college debat
ing teams.
The Oxford men landed in Canada
in August and have now gone to New
York to debate at Columbia University.
In the spring when their debates are
ended, they will go to Honolulu and
home via New Zealand, Australia, and
India.
Interest iti the premier's son has been
keen, not only because he is the son of
England's most important figure today,
but also because he has accomplished
much at Oxford. He is author of sev
eral political pamphlets and has been
the leader of Socialist thought at Ox
ford for several years. His two col
leagues are Liberals.
- Mac Donald is the acknowledged di
rector of campus politics in the English
university. The past year he held the
office of president of the Oxford Debat
ing Union, which has its counterpart
in American universities in the office of
student body president. The Oxford
Debating Union is the main student or
ganization of the Oxford campus. Once
each week the Union meets and there
are political debates, eafli speaker ap
pearing for the side in which he sin
cerely believes. The meetings of the
Union are of such importance that often
members of Parliament accept, with
pride, invitations to appear and speak.
Lord Curzon has frequently been pres
ent to argue his beliefs, and more than
once David Lloyd-George, while he
was still Premier of England, pounded
the Oxford Union rostrum with parlia
mentary vigor.
Malcolm Mac Donald has aspirations
to be a newspaper reporter. Part of
his time in this country will be spent on
the staff of a New York newspaper. In
this he is like his father, who began his
career as a London journalist.
Recently there appeared in the Phila
delphia Public Ledger an editorial com
paring Mac Donald to the Prince of
Wales. It commented, in part, "Mac-
Donald came unheralded and is not be
ing received by the society world, nor is
he .playing polo. Femininity is not go
ing crazy about him, probably because
femininity does not know he is here.
The male factors'are not studying his
apparel for the same.reason. This be
spectacled. erect youth is in manner
about as different from 'Prince Charm
ing' as an Englishman could be. His
present ambition is to sec life and get
on .his own feet."

A boost to minor sports in Kansas
was given by the official adoption of
boxing and golf as conference sports
at a meeting of the Missouri Valley
conference.
