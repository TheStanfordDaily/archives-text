# FACTS ABOUT THE MAILS
## A 						SERIES OF ARTICLES DEALING WITH THE UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE No. I. AIR MAIL SERVICE 
### Byron Williams 
Contrast the stage coach of a hun
dred years ago, lumbering heavily over
the public highways, with the swift air
plane of today, shooting across the
mountains and prairies; such has been
the improvement in the transportation
of the United States mail.
On July 1 of this year transconti
nental air mail service was inaugurated
between Statue of Liberty and the (lol
den Gate. This service now offers
wonderful advantages to those de
manding quick communication between
the East and the West, and is available
to all sections of the country.
The object of the postal department
in creating this much desired service
was not alone egotistic—it was hoped
to help aviation, commerce, and busi
ness, as well as to advance mail service.
The schedule from New York to San
Francisco is 34 hours, 45 minutes; from
San Francisco to New York, 31 hours,
35 minutes.
32 Hours to New York.
"Air mail in this office at 5 p. m. to
day will connect with the airplane which
leaves San Francisco tomorrow morn
ing at 6:30." stated Mrs. Marylyn
Thomas, acting postmaster at the Stan
ford omce. "Letters leaving the city at
6:30 a. m. reach Chicago at 7:50 the fol
lowing morning and New York at 5:05
that evening.
"Any mailable matter except that
liable to damage from freezing will be
carried by airplane. This includes

sealed parcels not exceeding 50 pounds
in weight and not exceeding K4 inches
in length and girth combined. Air mail
leaves every day, including Sundays and
holidays, and practically on time each
day.
"Points en route at which the planes
stop are Reno. Elko, Salt Lake City,
Rock Springs, Cheyenne, North Platte,
Omaha, lowa City, Chicago, Bryan,
Cleveland, Bellefonte, and finally at
New, York."
Continent Divided Into Zones.
For the purpose of equalizing the
great expense of carrying mail by air
the continent has been divided into
three zones: (1) from San Francisco to
Cheyenne, Wyoming; (2) from Chey
enne to Chicago; and (3) from Chicago
to New York. Postage is at the rate of
eight cents an ounce or fraction thereof
for each zone or part of zone in which
mail is carried by airplane. Thus if a
letter weighing less than one otincc
were sent from Boston to Seattle the
postage would amount to 24 cents, and
the route taken would be from Boston
to New York l>y rail, from New York
to San Francisco by plane, and from
San Francisco to StyitHe by rail. The
two cents extra required on a Special
Delivery letter is not required on air
mail.
Special stamps have been issued by
the postal authorities for this branch of
the service; denominations are 8, H> and
24 cents. Eight-cent stamps are green,
the design being a radiator and propel
ler; those for 16 cents are blue and the
design is regular air mail emblem, with
wings protruding on either side; 24-
cent ones are red, with a full view pic
ture of an airplane in actual Hight.
Should Be Designated.
A warning has been issued because
of the amazing similarity between the
regular 2-cent stamps and the 24-cent
air mail stamps, to the effect that all
air mail should bear the words "air
mail" conspicuously placed. If this is
done letters which bear the special
stamp will be certain of going by air,
and there will be no possibility of the
clerk letting it slip by with the regular
mail.
All air mail not-delivered will be for
warded or returned by air at no fur
ther charge, providing the forwarding
address is not in a more distant zone
than paid for. In the exception, postage
for the extra distance will be required.

Continent Divided Into Zones.
For the purpose of equalizing the
great expense of carrying mail by air
the continent has been divided into
three zones: (1) from San Francisco to
Cheyenne, Wyoming; (2) from Chey
enne to Chicago; and (3) from Chicago
to New York. Postage is at the rate of
eight cents an ounce or fraction thereof
for each zone or part of zone in which
mail is carried by airplane. Thus if a
letter weighing less than one otincc
were sent from Boston to Seattle the
postage would amount to 24 cents, and
the route taken would be from Boston
to New York l>y rail, from New York
to San Francisco by plane, and from
San Francisco to StyitHe by rail. The
two cents extra required on a Special
Delivery letter is not required on air
mail.
Special stamps have been issued by
the postal authorities for this branch of
the service; denominations are 8, H> and
24 cents. Eight-cent stamps are green,
the design being a radiator and propel
ler; those for 16 cents are blue and the
design is regular air mail emblem, with
wings protruding on either side; 24-
cent ones are red, with a full view pic
ture of an airplane in actual Hight.
Should Be Designated.
A warning has been issued because
of the amazing similarity between the
regular 2-cent stamps and the 24-cent
air mail stamps, to the effect that all
air mail should bear the words "air
mail" conspicuously placed. If this is
done letters which bear the special
stamp will be certain of going by air,
and there will be no possibility of the
clerk letting it slip by with the regular
mail.
All air mail not-delivered will be for
warded or returned by air at no fur
ther charge, providing the forwarding
address is not in a more distant zone
than paid for. In the exception, postage
for the extra distance will be required.
