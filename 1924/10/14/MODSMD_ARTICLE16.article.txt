# FASCISTI REGIME TO BE TOPIC OF ELMORE'S TALK
## "Some Recent Observations Of Greece and Italy" Will Be Subject 
### 
"The Fascisti movement is much
talked about in Italy." remarked Pro
fessor Jefferson Elmore, who will
speak on "Some Recent Observations
of Greece and Italy" at 7:30 tonight
in the Little Theatre.
] "Benito Mussolini, who founded the
I movement," he continued, was born
in the north of Italy in 1884. He pre
j pared himself for teaching in the ele
: mentarv schools, and actually followed
I this vocation."
In Politics Since Youth
Mussolini became interested in poli
i tics when he was very young. He
stood for parliament in opposition to
a very influential rival, and was de
feated. In a fit of anger Mussolini
smashed the ballot-box, and in an ef
fort to evade arrest he fled to Switzer
land, where he remained for several
years.
Elmore observed, "He perfected
himself in the French language and
literature while there, finally taking
his degree from one of the Swi*>s uni
versities. Mussolini was expelled from
the country only when he became a
radical socialist."
For Side of Allies
It is well known that he had much
to do with Italy's going into the World
War 011 the side of the Allies, when
he renounced his socialism for what
he considered the greater cause.
The Fascisti movement was not or
ganized until after the war, and then
it was formed in opposition to various
destructive forces in Italy that were
seeking to bring about a revolution.
"Through all the trying periods and
in the midst of his responsibilities.
Mussolini has not lost his academic
tastes." Elmore explained, "for he has
recently written a book on Macchia
velli which I understand is to be of
fered to the University of Bologna as
a thesis for the doctorate."
Also Observes Art in Italy
Elmore also observed a renewed in
terest in mosaics as architectural
decoration. The mosaic factory at the
Vatican is one of the places of un
usual interest in Rome. Work from it
is sent to all parts of the world. His
torically the plant is responsible for
the great change in the technique of
the art.
