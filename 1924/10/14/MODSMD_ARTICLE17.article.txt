# SENIORS URGED TO GET APPOINTMENTS FOR QUAD PICTURES
## 
### 
Seniors should get appointments for
Quad pictures as soon as possible, ac
cording to Manager Ray Kay. There
are 450 seniors to be photographed, and
a last-niinute rush would inconvenience
everyone.
To get pictures in the senior section,
seniors must buy the $7 senior Quad,
purchase of which entitles them to both
book and picture. An initial payment of
$3 must be made during the present
sale. Two days more remain of the sale
on the Quad, after which tryoutees will
call individually on any remaining
seniors.
Lafayette Studios of San Francisco
are doing the portrait work for thi.s
year's annual. They are also taking
individual orders for pictures. If the
individual orders are given before the
sitting, six proofs will be submitted in
stead of the usual three.
All women living at Roble or the
sororities should sign up at once for
living group pictures. Senior women's
pictures, however, will not appear in
the senior section unless the first in
stallment on the senior Quad is paid.
l*or the sitting, women are requested
to wear ordinary Quad clothes with
white collars.
