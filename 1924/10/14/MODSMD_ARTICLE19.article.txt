Already everything is beginning to lean toward Los Angeles and the
Southern California game on November 8. As yet the walls of the Quad
rangle have not lapsed out of the perpendicular, but the echoes and vibra

1 he latest evidence of interest is found in the song contest which the
Rally Committee is now promoting.
Here's hoping that somelwdy will step forward with a rousing ditty
and carry away the ten circular tokens of student gratitude. Stanford's
greatest weakness in the cheering-section department lies in the poverty of
musical vents for enthusiasm, and such a university should have no lack
of yodels appropriate for any situation. To write a good song is to make
a permanent contribution to University life, and would justify no small
glow of satisfaction in the interior recesses of the writer.
He as blood-thirsty as you like, and advocate, if you will, total extermi
nation of the tril>e 1 rojan. It s all in the game, and college songs are wont
to exaggerate a little without possibility of damage suits. But it must be
kept within the range of the average trolley-car sort of voice, or the sing
ing of it will be sad indeed.
