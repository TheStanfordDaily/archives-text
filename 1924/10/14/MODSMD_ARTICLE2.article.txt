# SEVENTY MEN OUT FOR INTERCLASS GRIDIRON PRACTICE
## 
### 
Approximately seventy men turned
out yesterday for the~ first practice of
the interclass football teams. All teams
ran through a light practice and re
ceived a short talk on the approaching
schedule and training for the games.
The freshmen under Captain Jenkins,
of the Military department, have been
in practice for nearly a month and for
that reason are conceded a slight edge
over the others. Their first game will
be with the sophomores Saturday, Oc
tober 25.
Sophomore material showed up fairly
well for the first night and, with some
of, last year's numeral men, are ex
pected to furnish some good competi
tion for the championship.
The juniors and seniors seemed low
on material, but delay iti issuing suits
kept many men from the field. It is not
too late for men signed up in other de
partments of Physical Education to
change over to interclass football, and
anyone wishing to do so should see C.
\V. Davis, Director of Intramural Ath
letics, at once.
Interclass football counts toward
lower division requirements, the same
as any other activity in the athletic de
partment. Upper division men are given
one unit of credit for participating.
Class numerals are awarded to all
men having played one-half game or
more on the team winning the cham
pionship. A perpetual silver trophy is
awarded to the class with the winning
team.
