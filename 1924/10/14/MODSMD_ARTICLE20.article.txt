Stanford, everybody will admit, is moving forward. Tn practically
every line the University is advancing so swiftly that the bewildered stu
dent is hard put to keep up with it. But the student does pretty well, neg
lecting only a few sides of his potential improvement.
< )ne of these overlooked areas, however, seems at first blush—and then
some more, for that matter —to be rather startlingly incongruous. Last
year the Spectator struggled along in great adversity and finally, with a
pitiful sigh, gave up its little ghost. Spectator was the nearest approach
to an "intellectual" publication that the campus could boast. And it was a
hybrid, with sports and other so-called "popular" material included for
the sake of circulation.
J erhaps that is why it died. But the old "Cardinal," which made no
such concessions to student tastes, died much earlier and more extrava
gantly. It looks very much as though the Stanford resident, in the bulk,
cares very little for student effort to produce literature. Frequently the
wail is heard that the citizens of the Farm pay no attention to problems
and movements of national significance. Often we are accused of neg
lecting the finer things in life. Are we, or aren't we? We allowed two
' thoughtful ' magazines to telescope into one, and then we allowed that
one to starve to death. Perhaps it is too much trouble to think, or perhaps
there is not enough time.
Several plans for new literary periodicals are under way. If the stu
dent body possesses an inclination for literature, some one of these plans
will undoubtedly mature and bring back this evidence of undergraduate
appreciation. If not it will be proof positive that we are neglecting some
thing.
EIGHTY-THREE men and women, all but ten of whom were under
classmen showed a desire yesterday to take part in the operation of the
Daily. With such interest as that, people who expect to be around here
in a couple of years may safely anticipate some thundering good publica
tions.
