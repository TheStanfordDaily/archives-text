Switzerland
We will first, gentle kind readers,
pick on a country like Switzerland for
our first lesson because it is too small
to hit back.
Switzerland*is a small slice of Alps
entirely bounded by American tour
ists. Its population consists of hotel
keepers, patriots, foreigners, bell ring
ers and hotel keepers.
* * *
There is also a small sprinkling of
native Swiss who, however, spend
most of their time standing outside
the cottage of Johan Peters, shaking
their heads and nodding to one an
other that he can mess about there in
his witclien all he likes, but he can
never get the right blend that has
I made Peteis Chocolate so famous the
| world over.
* * *
The chief products of Switzerland
are yodels, cheese, cuckoo clocks,
chocojate, Alps, and hotel keepers.
It is an interesting sociological, phil
ological, parenthetical, peripatetic, and
epileptic fact that four out of five of
the inhabitants succumb to pyorrhea.
Turkeys, neatly dressed, to be cross
country prizes. This is a new one on
us. Cabbages offers to enter race, how
ever, if he will be given head start
on turkeys.
* * *
Morning dance offered by band is
nothing new. Know a prof who stages
a song and dance every morning at'B
| o'clock about how there is nothing
I new under the sun. Looks as if he's
going to prove it.
* * *
Record number of tryoutees appear
for Daily. Greetings, brother goats.
While you're neophing around, try and
find out why the water was turned
off in the gym yesterday. In some
places it looked more like a morning
in September than October.

Model speech for student body presi

, don't take anything too seriously that
is said from this platform."

FOUND —By acquisitive Stanford
gentleman, fountain pen lying beside

stage entrance. The finder will call at
Daily officefi if owner will fill up pen
