# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT

### 
I Editor Daily Palo Alto:
I- riday's issue carried an announce
ment that only such seniors as paid for
a Quad would jhave their pictures in the
University year hook. Moreover, they
are required to pay out their money six
or seven months in advance of receipt
of the book, for that inestimable priv
ilege.
It must be obvious to any thoughtful
person that when over half of the stu
dents are working to earn their ex
penses in part or in full, a great many
of them cannot afford to spend seven
dollars for a Quad. And because of this
inability on the part of those students,
it seems far from fair to deprive the
rest of the students of a complete year
book.
I he position taken by the Quad man
agement may be financially a sound
one, but does it not appear that the
interest in getting out a year book in
which representation depends on eco
nomic status should not be allowed to
overweigh the interest in a year book
which fairly represents the University?
1 am not a senior and do not expect
to be. My interest in the matter is an
objective one.
