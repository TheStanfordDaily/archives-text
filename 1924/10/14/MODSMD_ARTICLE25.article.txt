# INTEREST SHOWN IN U. S. C. GAME
## 
### 
How many Stanford men realize
what the past issues with U. S. C.
have been and what their outcomes
have been? Do you know that Stan
ford has never beaten U. S. C. in any
big American Football game? How do
you account tor it?
I would say that it has been a lack
of interest in the past and an under
estimation of U. S. C.'s importance in
the Coast Conference. In ast years we
have let the menacing Bear over
shadow the worth of the Trojan.
We can readily account for the
strength of the Bear but have we
begun to formulate a defense for our
past name and prestige? Are we going
to let U. S. C. get the upper hand and
beat us to it? The Trojans are about
to complete their attack upon both the
Bear and the old weather-beaten
Indians. "The best defense is a strong
offense." This holds true in every walk
of life.
More interest has been shown to
ward the coming U. S. C. game this
year than in any of the past years.
Has it been too late or are we yet in
a position to assume the upper hand?
We already know that the only means
by which we can back up the men
behind the ball is by arousing enough
enthusiasm or "school spirit," as it is
sometimes called. Are we satisfied in
laying the burden upon "Pop" War
ner's shoulders as so many of the
Stanfordites are prone to do?
How much good comes from attempt
ing to dope out our chances? How
much good comes from wailing over
small scores? What matters as long as
we win? Is it our intention to run up
big scores? Isn't it rather the idea that
Stanford is out to win?
Do not be a pessimist! Do not be a
knocker! Get behind "Pop" and his
machine! Do not estimate the worthi
ness of any one player who has gained
a position on the team; let "Pop" do
that and back him up; for as you
back up "Pop" you back up his ma
chine. We are in a position to launch
upon both U. S. C. and California this
year one of the severest offenses they
ever experienced.
There is much talk about going to
the U. S. C. game. It is not far away
and it is none too early to plan. Let
us not plan to go to U. S. C. to see
'the game, but rather to make up our
j minds to be there as re-enforcements,
j reserves to back up our great offen
sive machine.
The Associated Students of Stan
ford have planned with the Alumni
Association to charter special means
of transportation to Los Angeles, for
the week-end of the game. The Los
Angeles Steamship Company is like
wise running an excursion trip. Stu
dents are arranging to ride in ma
chines and even bumming their way
down. There are many ways by which
a student may obtain passage to Los
Angeles. It is yet a month away. The
merchants in Palo Alto are showing
a greater interest in the present sea
son that ever before. Wideman & Son,
the "College Man's Store," is offering
to its patrons and those who are inter
ested in obtaining passage to the U.
S. C. game, a chance to obtain it free
of charge. Those who are interested
should drop into their store and in
quire how it is possible. We urge you
to make every effort to be back of the
team in L. A. â€”Adv.
