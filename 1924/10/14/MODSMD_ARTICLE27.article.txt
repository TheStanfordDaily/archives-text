# Honor System to Be Used In Men's Gym Classes
## 
### 
Further extension of the honor sys
tem is embodied in the new method of
taking attendance in the men's psysical
education classes put into practice yes
terday.
Under the new method large sheets
ot cardboard containing the class rolls
of the different sports are posted in the
gym, and each man must check his
name before reporting for work in his
suit and recheck at the end of the
period. Thus proctors are saved the
necessity of calling the roll at each
practice, and the athletes have addi
tional time to devote to their activity.
Swimming is the only sport not in
cluded in the system.
Notices posted in the gym explaining
the innovation urge students to ob
serve the honor system and refrain
from checking off their own or their
friends' names without actually attend
ing classes.
