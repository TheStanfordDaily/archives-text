## 
### 
Three of the famous French 75's
by huge motor trucks rumbled
into the campus yesterday afternoon
to complete the R. O. T. C. unit's
battery of these guns. The unit now
has four of the guns complete with
caissons and other necessary equip
ment.
The old three-inch guns, which are
now practically obsolete, were used

were poor material for training men
going to Camp Lewis, where only the
75's are used. Now that this handicap
has been overcome the Military De
partment of the University is in a
position to train its men better than
ever before.
