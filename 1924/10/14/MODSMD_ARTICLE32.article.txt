# Dance Will Raise Funds For Band's Trip to U. S. C.
## 
### 
Novel and elaborate lighting effects
are being planned for the Band dance
to be held Friday night in the pavilion,
according to promises made by Band
members selling tickets for the affair.
The secret is not being divulged, but
rumors have it that an illusion of day
light verging into dusk will be created.
In addition to offering campus
snakes a chance to work out, the dance
is expected to raise sufficient funds to
â–ºdefray the expense of taking the band
south to the U. S. C. game.
Whitmer's orchestra will preside.
