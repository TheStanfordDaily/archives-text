"The biggest task in modern elieni-1
istry is to iind a way to use nature's j
methods in the manufacture of dyes I
and other substances," stated Dr. Fritz [
Haber, director of the Institute for
Physical and Electro Chemistry, in hi.s ;
lecture on "Practical Applications ol' j
Theoretical Research in Chemistry" in '
the Little Theatre last evening.
Dr. Huber branded man's methods j
of organic chemistry as very artificial
and not in accord with the methods J
of nature, which are cheaper and j
surer. He used the dye-stuffs industry
as an example to illustrate his point.
"The greatest tiling for chemists to
overcome is their prejudice against
certain methods because of repeated
negative results in the pst," he con
cluded.
