"Pop" yVarner, football coach and
golf fan Inclorainatable, goes on record
as being a candidate for the hole-in
one club, albeit his first attempt failed
by twenty-five yards and gave him a
sore back in the bargain.
Warner took in the Olympic Club
golf course Sunday before last and
just before he teed off, one of the
club gossips told him of a hole in one
made by Tad Jones, Yale football
coach. It was too much for the Stan
ford mentor. Despite his resistance,
jealousy triumphed, and "Pop''" looked
out over the 325 yards between the
one hole and the other, and wondered.
He set himself for the supreme test
and drove. The ball went far—3oo
yards, according to "Pop"—but it
failed to drop into the cup. The dis
appointment and the drive, "Pop" says,
"have been the cause of his recent
have been the cause of his recent
recovering.
