# NUMEROUS CHANGES PLANNED THIS YEAR FOR SCHUBERT CLUB
## Membership Tryouts Will Be Held Tomorrow Night After Rehearsal 
### 
Schubert Club will hold its first
meeting of the year at 7:15 tomorrow
night in the Women's Clubhouse. All
last year's members and those who
qualified last week will be expected
to be there promptly. Tryouts will be
held again at the close of the meeting
for the benefit of those who missed
them previously because of confusion
in the announcement.
Those who qualified last week are:
Dorothy Bower, Elizabeth Gleason,
Fay Harrison, Lois McQuistion, Velma
Randall, Mary Rixford, Marjorie Tus
sing, Aileen Tognazzini.
Schubert Club is very anxious that
a large number of women turn out for
the tryouts, because the organization
is to have a bigger scope than for
merly, and more voices are badly
needed. They are particularly desirous
of freshmen who can stay with the
club and help in the constructive
policy which is being introduced.
Mrs. Warren D. Allen is to direct the
Club this year. She has had much
musical experience, both as a profes
sional singer, when she appeared un
der the name of Esther Houck Allen,
and as a director. She directed the
choruses at the College of the Pacific
for some time with much success,
handling from 600 to 1000 voices.
Schubert does not require exception
al voices, but it will demand regular
attendance at rehearsals. They will
be held once a week, probably Wednes
day at 7:15, during the fall and winter
quarters. Mrs. Allen hopes to be able
to offer a number of programs, and
regular work is imperative for proper
development.
