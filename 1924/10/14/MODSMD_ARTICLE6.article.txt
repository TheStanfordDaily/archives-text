# SEQUOIA CLUB MEN HOLD FIRST MEETING OF YEAR AT SMOKER
## 
### 
What old timers term "the best
smoker held in the hall in two years"
was staged in the Sequoia clubrooms
last night.
It was the first smoker of the year,
enabling the new men in the hall to get
acquainted with each other and get "on
the boat" as far as club spirit is con
cerned.
B. F. Haley, president of Sequoia
two years ago and lately a student at
Harvard, related a few anecdotes of
his eastern visit. The Strong brothers
in a harmonica duet and Sheldon Fay
on the banjo brought down the house
with their offerings. Harris and Col
lins mystified the crowd with ati act
featuring Harris' superior powers of
memory.
Sam Martens, Sid Laughlin, Harold
Preston, and Frank Isensee composed
the Sequoia quartet, singing "Sweet
Adeline" and several other numbers.
"Cider and doughnuts," rendered by
the club as a whole, was the climax to
the festivities.
In a special election following the
smoker Clyde Cox was elected secre
tary.
