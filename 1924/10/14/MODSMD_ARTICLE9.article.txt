# DRAMATIC SOCIETY TO GIVE "R.U.R" AS ANNUAL PRODUCTION
## Sword and Sandals Will Show Thrilling Melodrama; Davis to Direct 
### 
For the first time in several years,
campus theatergoers will have the op
portunity of seeing a real melodrama
on the Stanford stage, when Sword
and Sandals Society produces "R. U.
R." on November 14.
"R. U. R." is one of the sensations of
theater history, and ran for over a year
when it was first introduced to New
York. It has for its theme the crea
tion of mechanical beings, who become
so perfect that they finally conquer the
world. Persons without feeling or emo
tion, they face death as unconcernedly
as an ordinary human would face a
blank wall.
Gordon Davis will have charge of the
direction, and has issued a call for try
outees, both men and women, to report
to him in the Assembly Hall tonight
from 7 to 9 and tomorrow in the after
noon from 2 to 4 and in the evening
from 7 to 9.
The cast is large, and therefore a
large turnout is requested. Freshmen
are especially urged to try out, as this
play will be their only chance at dra
matics this quarter. Everyone is elig
ible with the exception of freshmen
women. The Daily Palo Alto will
print the list of successful candidates
in tomorrow's issue.
