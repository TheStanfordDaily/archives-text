## President Wilbur, Mrs. Burt Howard, Baron Boodberg To Be Speakers 
### 
Relief of Russian Refugees in Con
stantinople will be discussed at a
meeting to be held in the Little Thea
tre at 7:30 tonight. President Wilbur
will preside, and speakers will include
Mrs. Burt Estes Howard, chairman of
the committee in charge of the lec
ture, Baron Boodberg, Russian minis
ter of war during the Kolchek govern
ment, aud Admiral Duderoff.
"The meeting tonight is the first to
be held for this cause." remarked Mrs.
Howard, "and it is hoped that Stan
ford will sponsor the 'Russian Relief
Movement' so that it can be carried
on successfully to San Francisco, and
other neighboring cities."
Refugees in Turkey
At one time .'lOO.OOO Russians sought
refuge in Constantinople from Bolshe
vism, and the disbanded armies of
Wrangel and Denikin arrived in a
pitiable condition. There was not work
in Turkey to maintain more than a
small percentage; so the League of
Nations appointed a commission to
secure entrance for these people into
countries of larger opportunity.
The work of bettering their condi
tion has gone on until the number of
utterly helpless and destitute Rus
sians has been reduced to 7000'. Those
who remain are almost wholly edu
cated people of the professional, busi
ness and landed classes.
Relief No Longer Given
"At first," Mrs. Howard explained,
"there were a number of reiief or
ganizations functioning, but with the
partial evacuation of the refugees ar.d
the taking of the city by the Turks,
many of these organizations curtailed
their work or moved out entirely. Tim
left the refugees in a particularly dis
tressing condition, for they were alien:*
in a country that not only did not
want them but was in many cases
openly resentful of their presence.
"Since Turkey has rigidly forbidden
the employment of non-Moslems the
destitute people are no longer permit
ted to work," she continued. "They
are now faced by two alternatives â€”
death by starvation or their removal
to a country where they are permitted
to work."
France is willing to give them work
if they can reach her shores. The
League of Nations sets up the machin
ery for securing labor, and permits
for them to enter France. The League
also arranges for passage at $15 per
head but can not furnish the money
to pay for it.
