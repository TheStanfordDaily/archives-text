"It isn't the cash prize, but the
honor the winner will get that really
counts," says "Dutch" McCallister in
speaking of the song contest which
the Vally committee is directing to
secure a new song to be used by the
Cardinal followers in annual clashes
with the Trojans.
He's right at that. too. for the ten
dollars which is to be given the for
tunate composer will scarcely buy a
new top coat, or even defray a quar
ter's tuition, but the winner will find
himself one of the satellites on the
Quad should he throw a few words
and notes together which will chill the
stout heart of the optimistic followers
of pessimistic Gus Henderson, and
therefore indirectly make Stanford
victories easier.
Songs will be received until October
2t>. They should be given or mailed
to Jean Ward at the Kappa Kappa
Gamma house. The committee which
will judge the new airs will consist of
Warren D. Allen, Professor E. W. Mar
tin. "Nip" McHose, Charles C. Simons,
and McCallister. The winner will be
announced by October 28 which will
give ample time for the students to
learn the song, while the winner can
dust off a seat for himself by the side
of A1 Jolson and perhaps Francis
Scott Key.
