# SHENANDOAH TO PASS HERE
## Pacific Test Flight of Mammoth Dirigible May Be Resumed Tomorrow 
### Byron Williams 
DEPORTS from Southern California that the greatest airship in
the world's history, the "Shenandoah," will pass over us sometime to
morrow on the last leg of her flight to Seattle. *
Various times for departure from San Diego liave heen % set and then post
poned, first because of the damage sustained by the terrific gale which the
ship encountered upon its entrance into California from Arizona, and later
because of unfavorable weather reports from the Northwest Pacific.

Heavy winds prevailing at the Cali-:
fornia-Arizona border caused tli*
"Shenandoah" to be blown far off her
course. The trip from Fort Worth.
Texas, to Yuma was executed accord
ing to schedule, but right there "the
fun began." A gale estimated at fifty
miles an hour tested the firmness of
the great dirigible's structure, and ex
cept for a few mnior damages she
weathered the storm in a very satisfy
ing manner.
Route Abandoned
The flyers found it necessary to
abandon their plans of going direct
from Yuma to San Diego, and took a
route up the eastern side of the San
Jacinto Mountains to Redlands, On
tario, and Pomona, and then followed
the coast highway by way of Santa

Ana. They arrived at the Jxival Air
Station, San Diego, a half day behind
in their schedule.
The "Shenandoah" is t>Bo feet in
length, 78 feet in diameter, and 9ti
feet high. It has six 300-horsepower
engines, and is capable of a speed of
70 miles an hour. With its crew, food,
! weighs 125 tons.
Cruise Is Extended One
The cruise of the "Shenandoah" is
the most extended ever undertaken
by a dirigible. When the ship reaches
its destination, the United States will
have been outlined on three sides, for
it started at Lakehurst, N. J., followed
the CJulf and Mexican boundary to
San Diego, and will continue up the
Pacific Coast as far north as Camp
and supplies, the mammoth airship
l Lewis, at Lakeview, Wash.
Rear Admiral William Moffett, chief
I of the Bureau of Aeronautics and of
ficial observer on the flight, said that
the trip was more in the interest of
j commerce aeronautics than for mili
| tary purposes.
"By crossing from New York to San
Diego in approximately seventy-five
j hours' flying time despite unusually
I strong headwinds and disagreeable
i weather, we have demonstrated that
â–  the rigid type of dirigible is a thor
oughly capable and useful adjunct to
our means of transportation," stated
Admiral Moffett.
"Particularly over the sea such ships
will be useful, and there is no reason
why this particular ship should not
cross and recross the Atlantic carry
ling mail and passengers in unprece
dented time."
