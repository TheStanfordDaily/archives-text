# CHAMPIONSHIP GOLF TOURNAMENT DRAWS LARGE ENTRY LIST
## Eighty Expected to Tee Off In Qualifying Round At Burlingame Club 
### 
Interest in golf on the Stanford cam
pus promises to reach a new high
mark with the annual University
championship tournament scheduled
to begin October 22 at the Burlingame j
Country Club.
Fifty-eight players had enrolled in i
the gym up to last night, and with ;
entries remaining open until October
20 a field of eighty contestants is like- ,
ly. This is by far the largest number
ever entered in a Stanford golf tourna- j
ment and represents a gain of more j
than 250 per cent over the turn-out for
the 1923 championship, when thirty i
players competed.
Qualifying Round Next Week
The qualifying round of eighteen
holes may be played either Wednes
day or Thursday, October 22 or 23. 1
Match play will start the following i
week on a non-handicap basis, the en- j
trants being grouped into flights of
sixteen according to the medal scores
turned in for the qualifying round.
Prizes will be awarded the winner in
each flight.
Varsity Prospcts Good
A varsity squad of twelve or fifteen
members will be picked from the first
flight. These men will engage continu
ously in competitive play throughout
the year to determine their ranking,
the first six composing the team. Since
golf is rated as a second-class minor
sport at Stanford, freshmen as well as
upperclassmen are eligible for the
varsity.
"Nick" Carter and Fritz Ditzler, golf
manager and captain respectively, are
optimistic over the outlook for the \
coming season. With most of last j
year's veterans still on deck and with
a wealth of good material among the
freshmen chances of developing a
powerful aggregation are good. The
Cards have never yet proved their i
superiority over California on the;
links, but are going to make a strong
effort to turn the trick this year.
University Links Needed
According to Carter, the main ob !
stacle to putting golf on a firm founda
tion at Stanford is the lack of a suit-!
able course such as is owned by other j
colleges. With the co-operation of the
University authorities construction of
such a course on the campus would be '
made possible.
Through the courtesy of country
club officials all Stanford golfers are
offered facilities of the Burlingame,
links for practice and play every day |
except Saturday and Sunday upon pay
ment of a fee of five dollars per
month. Heretofore this privilege has
been limited to members of the var
sity.
Sampson to Give Lessons
By special arrangement every man
on the squad will receive two lessons ;
per week from Harold Sampson, of'
Burlingame, free of charge. This is a
wonderful opportunity for the fellows
to improve their games and is con-1
sidered an added incentive to try for
a place on the varsity. Sampson is
known as one of the foremost golfers
and teachers in (lie state.
