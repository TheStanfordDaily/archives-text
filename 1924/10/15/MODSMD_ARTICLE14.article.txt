# CARDS FACE SERIOUS OPPOSITION SATURDAY
## Contest Against Oregon Will Open Coast Conference Season Here; Coach Warner Is Confident 
### 
gTANFORD will face the most critical situation ot' the 1924 season next
Saturday when the University of Oregon journeys south to meet the Card
varsity.
It will be critical because:
It will be the first serious opposition Stanford has encountered this year.
It is the first conference game of the season, and a slip here may mean
elimination from the Pacific Coast Conference race.
It will show more definitely what stand the Cards will take against IT. S. C.
and California.

> "Pop" Warned was not particularly
worried over the outcome of last Sat
urday's game. He claims there was an
improvement in catching the punts,
an improvement in passing, and there
were fewer fumbles than in the Occi
dental game. Warner's teams are not
noted for running up overwhelming
scores. At Pittsburgh the scores
aimed at were winning scores. After
all a winning score is more than satis
factory, and if "Pop" still has confi
dence in his team there is little need
for the latent unenthusiastic criticism.
The Stanford backfield has been
more or less torn to pieces because of
injuries. Gil Wheat is out of the game
for the rest of life, probably. It would
be endangering his life, so physicians
say, for him ever to attempt to carry
another pigskin. Howard Mitchell,
Murray C'uddeback. George Baker,
Cliff Hey, and Ernie Nevers are poor
bets to get into the Oregon-Stanford
starting line-up.
Nevers May Ptay.
It is not at all improbable that Ernie
Nevers will see action Saturday. It.
might be, however that Warner will
deem it best to give the big full-back
another week's rest before rushing;
him into scrimmage once more. With
Nevers back in the game the kicking
problem would be far less complicated.
Stanford, with a good line, will have
to depend a great deal on kicking if
the backfield does not shape up to ad
vance predictions. A good kicker, and
a line to hold what the kicker has
gained will mean less chance for de
feat and strengthen the chances for
victory.

factory, and if "Pop" still has confi
dence in his team there is little need
for the latent unenthusiastic criticism.
The Stanford backfield has been
more or less torn to pieces because of
injuries. Gil Wheat is out of the game
for the rest of life, probably. It would
be endangering his life, so physicians
say, for him ever to attempt to carry
another pigskin. Howard Mitchell,
Murray C'uddeback. George Baker,
Cliff Hey, and Ernie Nevers are poor
bets to get into the Oregon-Stanford
starting line-up.
Nevers May Ptay.
It is not at all improbable that Ernie
Nevers will see action Saturday. It.
might be, however that Warner will
deem it best to give the big full-back
another week's rest before rushing;
him into scrimmage once more. With
Nevers back in the game the kicking
problem would be far less complicated.
Stanford, with a good line, will have
to depend a great deal on kicking if
the backfield does not shape up to ad
vance predictions. A good kicker, and
a line to hold what the kicker has
gained will mean less chance for de
feat and strengthen the chances for
victory.
