# STANFORD TEAMS ENTERED IN TWO SOCCER LEAGUES
## 
### 
Stanford is now entered in both the
University and Club Soccer League
and the Peninsula Soccer League be
cause of the formation of the new
league this fall. The Peninsula organi
zation just came into existence this
year and is the outgrowth of the Uni
versity and Club League, formed be
cause of the number of teams on the
peninsula and in order to eliminate
long journeys for games.
At present Stanford is the only Uni
versity with teams entered in both
leagues and is playing the first var
sity with the Universities and Clubs
and the second varsity with the penin
sula teams.
Now Coaching Varsity
Due to the absence of Harry Ma
loney. Stanford's soccer mentor, Ralph
Howei the varsity captain, is direct
ing the first varsity, and Bill Quigley
is coaching the second-string men.
Maloney is scheduled to sail from
Australia this morning and is expected
on the campus within the next two
weeks.
Next Saturday the first team will
meet the Marin County team on the
Mount Tamalpais High School grounds
in Mill Valley. The first-string men
were defeated by the Olympic Club
on the campus last Saturday but Cap
tain Howe credits this to lack of prac
tice and states that prospects for a
successful season are exceptionally
bright.
There has been a very good turnout
of men for this activity, consequently
the second varsity has not suffered
from lack of good material. This team
will meet the Pal 6 Alto American Le
gion team next Saturday on the var
sity field near the stadium at 1:30.
Most of the Legion team is composed
of former Stanford men who have
been playing together for some time
and are in very good condition.
