# Freshman Tradition
## 
### 
Stanford 1928 should get a quiet thrill out of the compliments passed
upon the class by the president of the A. S. S. U. in yesterday's assembly.
"You are the best freshman class I have ever seen here,' 'he said, and his
statement will he verified by practically every upperclassman.
The credit for this early glorification of '28 must be divided. Neces
sarily a large share goes to '28—these freshmen are the men who are
actually performing the good work. But think back to the frosh days of
the present Junior Class—how 1926 was booted all over the campus by
the mighty sophomores, punished more for the.sake of a sophomore lark
than for freshman correction, and so ground down and (at least partly)
intimidated that any individual initiative or energy was dangerous. When
one was active one was "cocky." And one was- tubbed, or paddled, or
hazed unmercifully.
Two years ago this next February came the reform. Tom Irwin was
the student leader who put it through with very little student support. The
faculty had long observed the evils of the sophomore discipline system,
but Stanford is largely student governed and the students did nothing. So
nothing was done, until Irwin closed his editorship "of the "Daily" with a
skilful murder of the evil that was killing Stanford.
Remember, then, that Irwin was the man who gave freshmen a chance.
At the time, a large number of students were certain that freshman classes
of the future would be unbearable. They have not been. They have only
been unbeatable. Freed of the menace of perverted sophomore discipline
they have blossomed out. won most of their athletic contests, and observed
the traditions of their new University just as fully as they did when every
sophomore was a detective. Certainly there are freshmen <vho do not
wear the "dink," or forget to say "hello," or use the Law Steps, or queen
and smoke too profusely. But there always have been, and the freshman
who fails today is not too smart for the sophomores—he is simply not
smart enough for his own purposes.
Freshman tradition has become a means of proving loyalty to Stanford
and a willingness to comply with student custom. It is no longer an un
willing and inglorious submission to petty, peanut tyranny.

HONOR SYSTEM is now being used to allow men to check them
selves in and out of compulsory physical education classes.
The collegian is being given more and more opportunity to make a man
of himself—or show that it can't l>e done.
This, in time, will make the success or failure of a college education en
tirely dependent upon the individual.
As a matter of fact it has always been so, but the world still holds
people who blame it all on the college.

JUST ONE relief drive this quarter, and that one will he fully ex
plained this evening. The Little Theatre is convenient and comfortable,
and the message is wholly worth-while.

Freshman tradition has become a means of proving loyalty to Stanford

This, in time, will make the success or failure of a college education en

Stanford 1928 should get a quiet thrill out of the compliments passed
upon the class by the president of the A. S. S. U. in yesterday's assembly.
"You are the best freshman class I have ever seen here,' 'he said, and his
statement will he verified by practically every upperclassman.
The credit for this early glorification of '28 must be divided. Neces
sarily a large share goes to '28—these freshmen are the men who are
actually performing the good work. But think back to the frosh days of
the present Junior Class—how 1926 was booted all over the campus by
the mighty sophomores, punished more for the.sake of a sophomore lark
than for freshman correction, and so ground down and (at least partly)
intimidated that any individual initiative or energy was dangerous. When
one was active one was "cocky." And one was- tubbed, or paddled, or
hazed unmercifully.
Two years ago this next February came the reform. Tom Irwin was
the student leader who put it through with very little student support. The
faculty had long observed the evils of the sophomore discipline system,
but Stanford is largely student governed and the students did nothing. So
nothing was done, until Irwin closed his editorship "of the "Daily" with a
skilful murder of the evil that was killing Stanford.
Remember, then, that Irwin was the man who gave freshmen a chance.
At the time, a large number of students were certain that freshman classes
of the future would be unbearable. They have not been. They have only
been unbeatable. Freed of the menace of perverted sophomore discipline
they have blossomed out. won most of their athletic contests, and observed
the traditions of their new University just as fully as they did when every
sophomore was a detective. Certainly there are freshmen <vho do not
