At an assembly yesterday morning
four Stanford students spoke for the
activities they represent. The chair
man gave each an introduction,
but it was unnecessary. The voices of
the speakers told more than all the
introductions in the world possibly
could. First came a cultivated, con
vincing voice, polished, assured, whol
ly that of the orthodox "college man,"
the president of the student body;
then a well-modulated, cultured, femi
nine voice, with a fine ring of sincerity
backed by a cool logic which astounded
a certain portion of the audience; next
0
was heard a voice of reserve, of re
pressed forcefulness, that of the ideal
ist and the judge; one could almost
see the speaker in a wig and long
black robe; lastly came the cooly sar
castic, electrifying voice of the Jour
nalist, now intensely serious with his
audienee, now frankly laughing at it.
All typical of Stanford; all worthy of
being studied —those voices.
Education is. like physical growth:
it changes the size but not the sort. ,
Heard after an 8 o'clock class this
morning near Engineer's Corner: !
"Well, you'll have to hand it to Ein
stein —he sure gave 'em something to
think about!" —something in a schol
arly reaction. . I
"Have you ever marked the eyes of
a man who has seen the world he has 1
lived in—there is something in them
that you do not find in other eyes, and
you have read the life of the man
when you have divined what it is." j
There are a few eyes like that on this I
campus, Dr. Jordan's, for instance.
