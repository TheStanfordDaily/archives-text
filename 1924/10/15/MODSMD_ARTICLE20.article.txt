# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT

Editor, Daily Palo Alto:
Having spent three years in Stan
ford University it has been my pleas- !
ure to think, and make others believe, !
that our spirit was one which stood
the test of the most trying of circum
stances. The quality of self-interest, ,
however, seemed to predominate over
that of loyalty to our team at last
Saturday's game. Never before have
I seen tiie rooting section break up
in the middle of the game. Are we j
sun worshipers? Or are we just too!
cureless to bring overcoats? Whatever
be the ailment, let us remedy it and
strive to be real Stanford men with
the old-fashioned "guts." —L. P. j
Editor, Daily Palo Alto:
In last night's issue of the "Daily"
I called attention to what 1 regarded
as a regrettable feature of the financ- j
ing of the Quad, namely,,that when a
senior is unable, for financial reasons,
to buy a Quad and thereby have his j
picture in it, everybody who does buy j
is prevented from having a complete,
representative year-book.
Since I wrote the former communi- j
cation a member of the Quad staff has ■
gone over the figures with me. 1 think |
that readers of the "Daily" who may
have seen my letter should have the ;
opportunity to know the facts, so I
take -this first opportunity to correct
any false impression created.
The unfortunate state of affairs 1
spoke of, while no less undesirable in
an individual case, is not so wide- |
spread as 1 had surmised. In other j
words, for last year's Quad 480 seniors !
paid for their pictures, out of a class |
of about 520. This percentage, 92%, is i
pleasingly high; so that representa
tion is fairly good, after all.
The management seems to deplore ;
as much as anyone the fact that some j
seniors are unable to be represented, |
but they are at a loss to better the
situation. However, judging by the j
courteous treatment I have enjoyed
at their hands, I am sure that sugges
tions on this point or any other will '
be welcome at the Quad office.

Considerable interest has been
aroused in Stockholm by the large j
orders for war material placed with j
the Bofors company, Scandinavia's!
largest manufacturer of guns, ammu-1
nitions, and military supplies, by sev-1
eral foreign countries.
