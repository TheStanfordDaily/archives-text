# NEW BRUIN LINEUP TO FACE STRONG OLYMPICS
## Carlson Takes Safety Post With Dixon Again Playing Half 
### 
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA,
OCT. 15, —When the University of
California football machine takes the
field against the Olympic Club eleven
next Saturday, October 18, in the Cali
fornial Memorial Stadium, it will meet
the stillest opposition that it has en
countered for some time. The club
team has an array of stars from all
over the United States that eclipses
that of the university.
Olympic Defense Strong.
The Olympics have a wonderful de
fensive team as they proved continu
ally against the Stanford eleven. Andy
Smith's backs will have to have a lot
of drive to break through the club
line. The Olympic's main offensive
play is in line bucks and short end
runs, but they may open up at any
time with plays that may baffle the
Bears.
Andy Smith, realizing that the
Bruins will be pitted against strong
opponents next Saturday, is working
his men hard and expects further im
provement by the end of the week if
no further accidents occur. The line
is getting more experience with each
scrimmage and should go much bet
ter against the Olympics than they
have gone so far this season. The
guard positions have been a problem
to Andy Smith all season. With Rau
out of the game, Niswander, Couper,
Nichelman, and Lewis are the leading
candidates for the position.
Bruin Backfield Found.
Coach Smith seems at last to have
found a first-class backfield combina
tion with Carlson at quarter, Brown
and Dixon at the halfback positions,
and Young at fullback with Imlay in
reserve. With the safety position off
his hands, Dixon is at last showing
his old form. He is getting his punts
off in good style and is playing a fast
all-around game. Brown is a capable
safety man and an exceptionally pow
erful line-plunger. By adding Young
to the backfield Andy Smith has
greatly increased the backfield's buck
ing power.
The probable line-up of the team
will be as follows:
L. Mell, L. E.; Carey, L. T.; Nis
wander, L. G.; Horrel (eapt.), C.; Cou
per, R. G.; Sargent, R. T.; Thatcher,
R. E.; Carlson, Q.; Dixon, L. H.;
Brown. R. H.; Young, F.

UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA,
OCT. 15, —When the University of
California football machine takes the
field against the Olympic Club eleven
next Saturday, October 18, in the Cali
fornial Memorial Stadium, it will meet
the stillest opposition that it has en
countered for some time. The club
team has an array of stars from all
over the United States that eclipses
that of the university.
Olympic Defense Strong.
The Olympics have a wonderful de
fensive team as they proved continu
ally against the Stanford eleven. Andy
Smith's backs will have to have a lot
of drive to break through the club
line. The Olympic's main offensive
play is in line bucks and short end
runs, but they may open up at any
time with plays that may baffle the
Bears.
Andy Smith, realizing that the
Bruins will be pitted against strong
opponents next Saturday, is working
his men hard and expects further im
provement by the end of the week if
no further accidents occur. The line
is getting more experience with each
scrimmage and should go much bet
ter against the Olympics than they
have gone so far this season. The
guard positions have been a problem
to Andy Smith all season. With Rau
out of the game, Niswander, Couper,
Nichelman, and Lewis are the leading
candidates for the position.
Bruin Backfield Found.
Coach Smith seems at last to have
found a first-class backfield combina
tion with Carlson at quarter, Brown
and Dixon at the halfback positions,
and Young at fullback with Imlay in
reserve. With the safety position off
his hands, Dixon is at last showing
his old form. He is getting his punts
off in good style and is playing a fast
all-around game. Brown is a capable
safety man and an exceptionally pow
erful line-plunger. By adding Young
to the backfield Andy Smith has
greatly increased the backfield's buck
ing power.
The probable line-up of the team
will be as follows:
L. Mell, L. E.; Carey, L. T.; Nis
wander, L. G.; Horrel (eapt.), C.; Cou
per, R. G.; Sargent, R. T.; Thatcher,
R. E.; Carlson, Q.; Dixon, L. H.;
Brown. R. H.; Young, F.
