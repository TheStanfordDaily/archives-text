# FIRST MEETING OF WOMEN'S CONFERENCE WAS HELD LAST NIGHT
## 
### 
Women's conference held its first
meeting of the year at Dean Mary
Yost's home last evening. Miss Yost
expressed the wish that with the
presidents of houses automatically be
coming members of conference, the
organization would become even more
active than formerly and its rulings
would be better enforced.
Carolan Strouse, president of As
sociated Women, told the conference
members of a women's assembly to
he held sometime during late October.
All women are urged to come and to
be prepared to give constructive ideas
on women's self-government. This is
the first, assembly of such a type
which has been held for a number of
years, and Miss Strouse, together with
the other members of women's con
ference, hope that it will so greatly
aid in women's self-government that
similar assemblies will be held an
nually. •
The occasionalvlate lock-out of an
hour or later overtime which now and
again comes up has previously always
been handled by the officers of each
living group and has made a difficult
problem to handle. Now it is felt that
a uniform ruling that all late lock
outs, whatever their cause, must be
immediately reported to Women's
Council, will prove to be the most
efficient plan.

The Occidental College eleven will
play the University of Hawaii at
Honolulu Dec. 6. A return game will
be played at Los Angeles in 1925, prob
ably on Thanksgiving Day.

Women's conference held its first
meeting of the year at Dean Mary
Yost's home last evening. Miss Yost
expressed the wish that with the
presidents of houses automatically be
coming members of conference, the
organization would become even more
active than formerly and its rulings
would be better enforced.
Carolan Strouse, president of As
sociated Women, told the conference
members of a women's assembly to
he held sometime during late October.
All women are urged to come and to
be prepared to give constructive ideas
on women's self-government. This is
the first, assembly of such a type
which has been held for a number of
years, and Miss Strouse, together with
the other members of women's con
ference, hope that it will so greatly
aid in women's self-government that
similar assemblies will be held an
nually. •
The occasionalvlate lock-out of an
hour or later overtime which now and
again comes up has previously always
been handled by the officers of each
living group and has made a difficult
problem to handle. Now it is felt that
a uniform ruling that all late lock
outs, whatever their cause, must be
immediately reported to Women's
Council, will prove to be the most
efficient plan.

The Occidental College eleven will
play the University of Hawaii at
Honolulu Dec. 6. A return game will
be played at Los Angeles in 1925, prob
ably on Thanksgiving Day.
