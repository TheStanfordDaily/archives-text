# ECONOMIC CONDITION IN ITALY IS IMPROVED
## Influx of Tourists, Change In Political Situation, Benefit Country 
### 
Mussolini's famous words. "You see.
gentlemen, all Italy is at work," we**e
used by Professor Jefferson Elmore in
his lecture last night to explain the
improvement in the economic condi
tion of the country.
One contribution to the . general
economic improvement is to be found
in the influx of visitors from other
countries, who last year reached the
extraordinary number of 500,000. An
other factor is the change in political
situation.
* Explains Fascisti Movement
"In my opinion," stated Elmore," the
Fascisti movement is the revival of a
Latin tradition. The cause was organ
ized against the anti-national and revo
lutionary elements, and was composed
mostly of ex-soldiers. For almost three
years a civil war raged between the
parties, before the Fascisti won.''
Mussolini does not put the same
value as we do on liberty. He says,
"order, respect for authority and disci
pline have a greater fascination." The
state is considered as a spiritual en
tity.' and it expects the iudividual
citizen to recognize its high mission.
Government Is Practical
"The separation of church and state
is frowned upon by the leader." ex
plained Elmore, "and with such be
liefs his aim is .a government which
is not democratic, but which keeps
in touch with the people. There is
temptation to moralize about this;
movement. It is not perhaps as Ameri
cans would wish, but it has been of |
great practical service to Italy, and
has given expression to fundamental
elements of her political conscious
ness." -
"The Greek like the Italian loves
the shade," continued Elmore. "This
no doubt explains why the peasants
build their houses with few or no win-'
dows. I also noticed a striking mani
festation of interest in public affairs
is characteristic of the people."
Excavations Described
Professor Elmore told of the excava-!
tions at Knossos, where a palace has
been discovered. It covered an area of ;
six acres, and was three or four 1
stories high. One of the rooms re- 1
maining virtually intact was the j
king's audience chamber, in which
avws found the throne. The walls were j
adorned with frescoes, which alter
four thousand years, give no sign of
fading.
