# INJURIES RETARD FROSH PROGRESS IN FOOTBALL FORM
## Dennis, Davidson and Altaffer Are Out of Freshman Present Line-Up 
### 
Injuries still constitute the greater
part of Coaph "Husky" Hunt's worries
for three men of his first-string fresh
man eleven are thus handicapped.
Dennis, one of the most promising
ends entered here in several years
and who has a brilliant prep record
behind him, continues to sit on the
sidelines with a bad ankle. Hunt had
him in the lineup for signal practice
yesterday buti it is doubtful if he will
be able to trot out against the Santa
Clara freshmen Saturday. Davidson,
also a first-team end, was put out tor
the season last week when he broke
his ankle.
Hopes for Recovery of Altaffer
Even with his plentiful supply of
halfback combinations, Hunt is hoping
for the recovery of Altaffer who has
been out of the game with an injured
shoulder for several weeks. The latter
will be unable to return to scrimmage
this week but his presence next week
will greatly strengthen the already
powerful combination in the backfield.
The probable key to the reason of
Hunt's worries being chiefly in regard
to injuries is that he is quite satisfied
with his charges' showings up-to-date.
Modesto Junior College gave them
little trouble and California Polytech
nic far less, in fact, no trouble at all.
In both games it was proven that it
was the backfield which will undoubt
edly give the stands quite a bit to
think about in games to come for they
showed the fight and vigorous offen
sive that football fans delight in see
ing.
One of the backs who should furnish
quite a bit of this action is Hill, tunc
tioning at halfback. He has been given
a great, deal of publicity, both past
and present, but his ability to circle
the opposing ends frequently has
given rise to it. Millage, at full, shares
with Hill in this respect, and, too,
may usually be counted upon for gains.
However, combinations equally as
good are Hoffman at full, and Pabst,
Patchett, or Atlaft'er at half.
As for the line, although it is the
department that gets most of the
blame and no glory, it seems so far to
be tilling the bill adequately. With
Davidson, end, out for the season, and
Dennis injured, Issel and Montgomery
have taken up the end positions well.
Of the rest, Robesky at tackle and
Post at guard are the most outstanding
from their work in the past games
but it is easily possible that, from
the good material present, they may
be displaced in future games by likely
"dark horses."

Prohibition was the subject of a re
cent debate between Columbia and
Oxford universities. The British team,
led by Malcolm Mac Donald, son of the
prime minister, upheld the affirmative
of the question, stating that the audi
ence was opposed to the principle of
prohibition.

Registration at the University of
California this year has surpassed all
records, 17,000 students being enrolled
in departments at Berkeley and the
various branches throughout the state.
