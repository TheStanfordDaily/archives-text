# AID FOR RUSSIANS IN CONSTANTINOPLE ASKED OF CAMPUS
## "We Can Die, But We Will Not Beg" Are Words Typical Of Destitute Refugees 
### 
'"We can die, but we will not beg,'
are words typical of the class of Rus
sian refugees we are trying to save,"
explained Miss Emily Howard at the
meeting held in the Little Theatre last
night to formulate plans for relief.
Other speakers were President Wil
bur, who presided; Mrs. Burt Estes
Howard, chairman of the relief com
mittee; Baron Boodberg, Russian min--
ister of war during the Kolchek gov
ernment; and Admiral Duderoff.
Employment a Problem
"France is able to absorb these refu
gees into her society," said President
Wilbur. "Our problem is to find some
way to make that necessary connec
tion between a man and his job."
A plea was made by Admiral Duder
off for us to give these destitute peo
ple an opportunity to get work, any
kind of work. "Just help them to help
themselves," he said.
"The refugees see only the ruins of
their ideals and the desecration of all
they consider sacred," declared Baron
Boodberg. "The future is dim. except
for your aid, and in the name of the
starving Russian refugees, who find
themselves as aliens, and unwanted in
Constantinople, I say, God bless you
for your generosity."
According to Miss Howard the des
perate situation in Constantinople was
brought about by two factors: the dis
banding of the famous White Army
in and around the city, and the recent
anti-alien attitude adopted by the
Turks, which has resulted in the in
ability of the refugees to secure any
kind' of work.
"The White Army," remarked Miss
Howard, "was made up mainly of the
higher classes of Russia —the back
bone of what was old Russia. At first
there were a number of relief organiza
tions functioning, but most of these
societies have been forced to curtail
their work or move out entirely."
"All but 7000 have been sent out,"
she continued, "but these are practi
cally without food or clothes. It is not
because they are above menial labor,
for they have served in every capacity,
but because there is nothing for them
to do."
Mrs. Howard gave three reasons for
the Russian Relief Movement: the
type of men, the educated class; the
fact that every cent can be spent for
transportation for these people, and
not in salaries and organization; and
the completeness of the task; for the
men when once on the shores of
France are placed on the first round
of the ladder of opportunity.
"You are asked to help in two ways,"
she said in conclusion, "in contribu
tions, and in sending the facts about
the Relief Movement to others, who
may help,"
'"We can die, but we will not beg,'
are words typical of the class of Rus
sian refugees we are trying to save,"

sian refugees we are trying to save,"
explained Miss Emily Howard at the
meeting held in the Little Theatre last
night to formulate plans for relief.
Other speakers were President Wil
bur, who presided; Mrs. Burt Estes
Howard, chairman of the relief com
mittee; Baron Boodberg, Russian min--
ister of war during the Kolchek gov
ernment; and Admiral Duderoff.
Employment a Problem
"France is able to absorb these refu
gees into her society," said President
Wilbur. "Our problem is to find some
way to make that necessary connec
tion between a man and his job."
A plea was made by Admiral Duder
off for us to give these destitute peo
ple an opportunity to get work, any
kind of work. "Just help them to help
themselves," he said.
"The refugees see only the ruins of
their ideals and the desecration of all
they consider sacred," declared Baron
Boodberg. "The future is dim. except
for your aid, and in the name of the
starving Russian refugees, who find
themselves as aliens, and unwanted in
Constantinople, I say, God bless you
for your generosity."
According to Miss Howard the des
perate situation in Constantinople was
brought about by two factors: the dis
banding of the famous White Army
in and around the city, and the recent
anti-alien attitude adopted by the
Turks, which has resulted in the in
ability of the refugees to secure any
kind' of work.
"The White Army," remarked Miss
Howard, "was made up mainly of the
higher classes of Russia —the back
bone of what was old Russia. At first
there were a number of relief organiza
tions functioning, but most of these
societies have been forced to curtail
their work or move out entirely."
"All but 7000 have been sent out,"
she continued, "but these are practi
cally without food or clothes. It is not
because they are above menial labor,
for they have served in every capacity,
but because there is nothing for them
to do."
Mrs. Howard gave three reasons for
the Russian Relief Movement: the
type of men, the educated class; the
fact that every cent can be spent for
transportation for these people, and
not in salaries and organization; and
the completeness of the task; for the
men when once on the shores of
France are placed on the first round
of the ladder of opportunity.
"You are asked to help in two ways,"
she said in conclusion, "in contribu
tions, and in sending the facts about
the Relief Movement to others, who
may help,"
'"We can die, but we will not beg,'
are words typical of the class of Rus
sian refugees we are trying to save,"
explained Miss Emily Howard at the
meeting held in the Little Theatre last
night to formulate plans for relief.
