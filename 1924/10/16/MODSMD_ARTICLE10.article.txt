# BOOKS COMMEMORATE LIFE OF STILLMAN
## Publish Late Professor's Works as Well as Collection of Friends' Appreciation 
### 
Two books commemorating the life
of John Maxson Stillman, late profes
sor emeritus of chemistry at Stanford
—one, "The Early Story of Chemistry"
by his own hand, and the other, "In
Memory of John Maxson Stillman," a
collection of appreciations by some of
Dr. Stillman's friends and colleagues—
came from the presses this week.
"The Early Story of Chemistry," a
volume of 566 pages, was written by
Dr. Stillman during his later years of
retirement from active university
work. He arranged with D. Appleton
& Company for publication but did
not live to see it appear on the shelves
of the library. Dr. Stillman died before
the proofs came back to him for cor
rection.
The book tells the story of the his
tory of chemistry, "the development
of chemical knowledge and science
from the earliest known beginnings to
the close of the eighteenth century
and the downfall of the phlogiston
theory," sas the editor's note. "It is a
record of man's groping for exact
science, important in its revelation of
matters essential for understanding of
chemistry and most readable in Pro
fessor Stillman's pages."
Because of the circumstances of Dr.
Stillman's death and subsequent pub
lication of the book. Professor Stewart
W. Young of the Chemistry depart
ment, for:? 0 years associated with Dr.
Stillman as friend and co-worker, con
tributed a foreword containing a
sketch of Dr. Stillman's life and char
acter.
"Professor Stillman was a man of
broad and diverse interests and activi
ties," writes Professor Young, "and
whenever he undertook a thing it was
with fine enthusiasm and a great
energy ... .

"Stillman's participation in all
things having to do with the day's
work was always very active and ef
fective, and he was frequently called
upon to do more than his share. But
he never stinted himself in the re
sponse. ... He was for several years
vice-president of the University, and
often acting president. Here, within
the limitations of his power he always
stood for sanely progressive policies
and a goodly store "of worldly wisdom
told him when to fight, when to bide
his time, and when, if necessary, to
yield.
"As a department executive, where
his authority was almost autocratic,
his attitude was always forbearing,
kindly, conciliating, and helpful, but
he was nevertheless a jealous guard
ian of his rights and prerogatives. . . .
"It was out of Professor Stillman's
labors as a teacher that "The Story
of Early Chemistry" was born and
grew to what it is. For much of his
life he had given increasing attention
to the history of chemistry, and for
many years taught, the subject to
small classes. Gradually covering new
ground and extending his knowledge
of the field, he finally gained a breadth
of view which he felt might justify
some contributions to the literature of
the subject."
The smaller book contains five
"Words of Appreciation," the first be
ins a reproduction of the memorial
address, delivered by Professor Rob
ert Eckles Swain in the Memorial
Church. Professor Young's foreword
in "The Story of Early Chemistry" is
reproduced as a biographical sketch,
while the other three "words" come
from the pens of Col. George C. Ed
wards, professor of mathematics,
emeritus, University of California and
classmate of Dr. Stillman at Califor
nia ; Alonzo Englebert Taylor, director
of the Food Research Institute, and
Dr. O. L. Elliott, registrar, who dis
cussed Dr. Stillman's membership in
the Chit Chat club, an organization of
twenty-five distinguished people which
has met monthly at San Francisco
since 1874.

collection of appreciations by some of
Dr. Stillman's friends and colleagues—
came from the presses this week.
"The Early Story of Chemistry," a
volume of 566 pages, was written by
Dr. Stillman during his later years of
retirement from active university
work. He arranged with D. Appleton

not live to see it appear on the shelves
of the library. Dr. Stillman died before
the proofs came back to him for cor

The book tells the story of the his
tory of chemistry, "the development
of chemical knowledge and science
from the earliest known beginnings to
the close of the eighteenth century
and the downfall of the phlogiston
theory," sas the editor's note. "It is a
record of man's groping for exact
science, important in its revelation of
matters essential for understanding of
chemistry and most readable in Pro
