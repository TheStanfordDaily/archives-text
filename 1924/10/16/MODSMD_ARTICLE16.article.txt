# SWIMMING TEAM TO OPEN SEASON WITH P.A.A. MEET
## Stanford Given Even Chance To Take Championship; Olympic Club Good 
### 
Accorded an even chance for victory
by their coach, Ernie Brandsten, Stan
ford swimmers will plunge into the
1924-25 season with a splash when
they compete in the Pacific Athletic
Association championship meet in the
Olympic Club pool on October 24 and
25.
The Olympic Club is expected to
furnish the lion's share of conipetitiou
for the Card mermen, although col
leges as far north as Eureka and as
far south as Fresno will have entries.
California will be represented by a
small squad. The Post-streeters nosed
out Brandsten's charges last year in
an exciting dual meet which was not
decided until the relay, and will do
their best to make it two straight.
A1 White will compete for Stanford,
reports to the contrary notwithstand
ing, anfi is counted upon to win all the
diving events in easy fashion. Dave
Fall, who placed second to White in
the high springboard event at the
Olympic games, is in line for second
honors.
O'Connor Not Entered
Stanford's greatest handicap in this
meet will be the absence of Captain
Wally O'Connor, who is not registered
in the University this quarter but will
return in time for competition in the
winter season.
Arden Allen is Brandsten's candi
date to fill the gap. Allen did some
spectacular work in the Central Cali
fornia Swimming League last summer.
He is expected to win the back stroke,
with I)ave Fall second, and to place
in the 220'.
Carl Stevenson, star performer on
the 1927 team, should place high in
the 440. Other men with first-year ex
perience who loom as likely point win
ners are Williams in the 100, "Dutch"
Fletcher and Brooks in the 50, and
Hanley in the breast-stroke. Hanley
should be good for a first.
In the medley relay, a combination
of breast-stroke, back-stroke, and free
style laps, Allen and Fletcher must be
counted as strictly in the running.
