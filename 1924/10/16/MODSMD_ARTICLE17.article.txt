# ANNUAL TRIANGULAR DEBATE SCHEDULED FOR NOVEMBER 3
## 
### 
Stanford will be represented by an
exceptionally strong team in the an
nual triangular debate with California
and U. S. C. on November 3.
Robert Littler, Stanley Weigel, and
Robert Lewis were chosen from a
large field of able speakers at the try
outs-and are now at work on their
speeches.
"Coolidge vs. Davis vs. LaFollette"
is the subject. Each of the three uni
versities will have a man defending
each candidate. This necessitates a
different arrangement of speakers
from that in force in previous years,
whereby each college will have a
representative in three cities.
Stanford Man in San Francisco
Stanford's section of the debate will
be held in the Native Sons auditorium
in San Francisco, where Robert Littler
will apeak iu favor of Coolidge. Stan
ley Weigel will set forth the advan
tages of Davis' candidacy at Berkeley,
and Robert Lewis will defend LaFol
lette at Los Angeles.
California will send its LaFollette
man to San Francisco and its Davis
proponent to Los Angeles. U. S. C.
speakers will support Davis in San
Francisco and LaFollette in Berkeley.
Faculty Debate Advisor J. G. Emer
son is highly pleased over the outlook
for the coming year. He declares that
never before has such widespread in
terest been shown by the students in
the educational value of public discus
sion. He feels that debating is at last
coming into its own at Stanford.
Enough able orators turned out for
the triangular debate trials to compose
three first-class teams. Emerson has
selected the following alternates for
the varsity speakers: Babeock for
Littler, Duniway for Weigel, and Goss
lin for Lewis.
Particular interest iR attached to the
coming forensic contest because of thÂ»>
fact that it will take place on the eve
