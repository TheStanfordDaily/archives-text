# Who Are You?

It has now become a question of motive. Are you attending the Uni
versity of Southern California game as a private citizen, or as a student
supporter of Stanford? Is it merely a week-end in Los Angeles, or is it
an opportunity to help out the Cardinal by forming a part of the Cardinal
representation?
The Board of Athletic Control, the northern alumni, and the Rally
Committee have made a thorough investigation of every means of travel,
with the idea of making the trip as satisfactory as possible to both students
and alumni. The unanimous decision of the three bodies was that three
special trains, run south Friday night following the "Lark," with rather
flexible arrangements regarding the return trip, would form the ideal
means of locomotion.
Primarily, the train saves time. Time is valuable to the alumnus who
has the office to consider; time is valuable to the student whether he elects
to while away the extra hours in the north or in the south. Also, the train
would be much more convenient for the plans now under way in Los
Angeles.
It seems, then, that the judgment of the organizers should be univer
sally confirmed. And having confirmed it, the next thing to do is to sup
port it. This is Stanford's show, and Stanford spirit will make it an ex
clusive performance. Outside suggestions, however sound they may be
from a business-getting standpoint, are in direct opposition to the unity
and welfare of the Universitv.
