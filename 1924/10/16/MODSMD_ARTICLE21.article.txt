# FACTS ABOUT THE MAILS
## A 						SERIES OF ARTICLES DEALING WITH THE UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE No. 2. HAS AIR MAIL MADE GOOD? 
### Byron Williams 
"Air mail service is prepared to
carry all the mail committed to it;
and the financial justification and suc
cess of the air mail depends upon the
extent of the use which the public
makes of it," stated Harry S. New,
Postmaster General, upon the inaugu
ration of transcontinental air service.
Has the new air service made good?
Is the public patronizing it as was ex
pected by Uncle Sam? Or has it been
a failure? These are some of the
questions which might naturally be
asked by those of us who are inter
ested in the outcome of the greatest,
venture in the history of the Air Mail
Service.
In Operation for Six Years.
More than a year was spent in care
ful preparation for the through service
between San Francisco and New York.
It was planned by those who have had
experience in other air mail routes;
for air mail has been in operation in
the United States for over six years—•
since May 15. 1918, to be exact. The
Washington-New York route was first
established, and then the New York-
Chicago route. So those who planned
this new venture had plenty of experi
ence to back them.
Men of ability and courage were ob
tained—men who were pioneers in
practical aviation. And the feat has
actually been accomplished! Flights
across the continent are started every
day of the year—through snow, rain,

hail, and fog. And they are FINISHED
So the flights are being made daily
—the Air Mail Service successfully
completed the task they set out so con
fidently to accomplish. But what
about the public—has it lived up to its
side of the bargain? Is the through
service being taken advantage of?
"IT IS NOT," said Mrs. Marylyn
Main Thomas, Acting Postmaster of
the Stanford University office, ener
getically. "The public has so far
failed to respond. Business all over
the country has not seen its way clear
to make use of this exceptional, and
up to a few months ago, seemingly im
possible service. Financially, it is a
failure. ' - -
"But, in time, business may come to
appreciate its importance. Even now
there is a great deal of publicity in
Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Seat
tle to increase the air mail business of
that particular city. The object of it,
on the part of Los Angeles and Seat
tle, is to get a direct route to the East
of its own, or else to take the present
one away from San Francisco; on the
part of San Francisco the object isi to
keep what it already possesses.
"Although I am not aware of any
intention of the postal authorities to
change its present western terminal,
there is probably no better way to
bring such a change about thun to
have Los Angeles or Seattle do :<
greater business than San Francisco."
