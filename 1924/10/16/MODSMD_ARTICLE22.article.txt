Now we have the sponsor.
The dictionary says: "One who
makes himself responsible, as lor the
duty or debt of another; specifically a
god-mother or god-father."
This is an opportunity, freshmen!
Make the sponsor responsible for your
debts. They are chosen for their kind- i
heartedness to animals. Send them
your cleaning bills, your laundry bills,
and poker debts.
They monopolize all the cleaning
and laundry agencies, and win all your
money at poker. According to Webster
you can't go wrong. They have no
comeback against Webster; he died
long ago.
What every sponsor should have:
(1) A four-year nursing course at
the Stanford nurse school.
(2) A booklet explaining the jun
qualified excellence of one's fraternity
or organization, with directions for us
ing.
(3) An intuitive knowledge of where
stolen tables may be found, why tacks
are put on chairs, and who chained
bicycles to the bed. This ought to be
easy.
(4) A grim determination to sup
press the outbreaks on the fifth floor. 1
(5) Daily chanting of the sponsor
ritual: "Yes, yes, I was a boy myself
once."
