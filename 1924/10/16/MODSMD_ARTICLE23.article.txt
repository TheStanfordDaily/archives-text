# RENUNCIATION
## 
### 
How can I put you from me,
Oh one so small and true.
There are others in the world, dear,
But there's no one quite like you.
In dreams I taste your sweetness
As to my lips you lie close pressed,
While your dainty, clinging person
Makes my heart pound in my breast.
Oh Lord. How can I put you from me —
Cut the ties that bind you fast,
For you are my one and only—
My tiny tirst mustache.
—E. G.
