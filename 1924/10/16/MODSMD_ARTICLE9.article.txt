# BILT MORE OFFICIAL CARD HOME WHILE IN LOS ANGELES
## Entire Accommodations for 1400 People Taken by Athletic Board 
### 
Los Angeles' most exclusive and
most spacious downtown hotel will be
turned into a buzzing nest of Stanford
football enthusiasts the week of the
clash with the Trojans, for the Board
of Athletic Control has chartered the
entire plant of the Hotel Biltmore for
the use of the Cardinal.
From the top of the highest flagpole
to the floor of the boiler room the
Biltmore will be 100% Stanford. Two
huge red flags bearing the Stanford
insignia will Ue floated from the flag
poles, while a banner, 20 by 40 feet
in size, will guard the front of the
hotel.
The Biltmore has accommodations
for 1400 people, and the hotel com
pany is at present sending circulars
to all Stanford alumni, with the end in
view of having every room occupied
by a former resident of the Farm.
The varsity gridders will be housed
in one section on the upper wing of
the hotel, and Stanford students will
be given preference in making reser
vations for the week ending Novem
ber 8.
Fourteen hundred Stanford men un
der one roof insure plenty of excite
ment in themselves, but plans have
been made for other forms of enter
tainment, so that every Stanfordite
will have an opportunity to fitly cele
brate on Saturday night.
Three orchestras will hand out the
best of dance music in three ball
rooms, providing ample space for all
of the 1400 Stanford rooters to dance
to their hearts' content. Lastly, a Stan
ford dinner dance is promised for Sat
urday evening.
The Hotel Biltmore has not made
rates for students. However, as
planned, enough alumn will be on hand
for the game to practically fill the
immense hostelry-to overflowing.
