# FRESHMAN GRIDDERS MEET SANTA CLARA IN FIRST REAL TEST
## 
### Douglas Meservey 
For the first time this season, the
Card freshman eleven will be given
a real chance to prove its power when
it meets the Santa Clara babes as a
preliminary to the varsity-Oregon
game.
Modesto Junior College proved easy
for Hunt's charges and California
Polytechnic far more so, but Hunt is
sure that there will be no kick coming
regarding a "set-up" tomorrow.
How the babes will act when up
ugainst stiff opposition remains to be
seen. However, Hunt is worrying lit
tle; for he has had good material to
work with and has imbued in them a
confidence of result. If one doubts,
watch the way the offensive works —
smoothly and confidently. This means
that at the head of it is a clever field
general, Murphy, who is not only a
good leader but a good defensive man.
Behind him are two fullbacks, Mil
lage and Hoffman, both good kickers,
but the former a bit more experienced.
Kicking practice with a few signals
was about all that was held yesterday
and, with the wind, the two men men
tioned were sending the oval an easy
fifty-five yards time and again.
As for halves, Murphy can call on
Pabst, Hill. Patchett, or Altal'fer (when
the latter comes out of a period of
! convalescence) and feel confident in
the ability of either.
Now Hunt can depend upon his
backfield tomorrow with some surety,
but the real test will come when
Santa Clara begins its offense against
the Card line. Will they hold or not?
j Coach Sprague. seems to think so,
I and if weight, plus intensive coaching,
| means anything, he shoulu be right.
I On offensive, too, the same line should
perform adequately because the
weight in it is backed up by charging
speed and power capable of opening
good holes.
At 10 o'clock, the freshman light-
I weights meet Chico High School on
the practice field.
The first-string freshman lineup is
as follows: Montgomery, left end; Ho
besky, left tackle; Maguire, left
i guard; Mustain, center; Jardine, right
{guard; Post, right tackle; Vincenti,
! right end; Murphy, quarterback; Hill,
I left half; Pabst, right half; and Mil
j lage, fullback.

Fraternity rushing at Dartmouth Col- ■
lege has been postponed until Novem- j
ber 17. Organized rushing will begin j
then, and bidding will be on Dec. 4. i
For the first time this season, the
Card freshman eleven will be given
a real chance to prove its power when
it meets the Santa Clara babes as a
preliminary to the varsity-Oregon
game.
Modesto Junior College proved easy
for Hunt's charges and California
Polytechnic far more so, but Hunt is
sure that there will be no kick coming
regarding a "set-up" tomorrow.
How the babes will act when up
ugainst stiff opposition remains to be
seen. However, Hunt is worrying lit
tle; for he has had good material to
work with and has imbued in them a
confidence of result. If one doubts,
watch the way the offensive works —
smoothly and confidently. This means
that at the head of it is a clever field
general, Murphy, who is not only a
good leader but a good defensive man.
Behind him are two fullbacks, Mil
lage and Hoffman, both good kickers,
but the former a bit more experienced.
Kicking practice with a few signals
was about all that was held yesterday
and, with the wind, the two men men
tioned were sending the oval an easy
fifty-five yards time and again.
As for halves, Murphy can call on
Pabst, Hill. Patchett, or Altal'fer (when
the latter comes out of a period of
! convalescence) and feel confident in
the ability of either.
Now Hunt can depend upon his
backfield tomorrow with some surety,
but the real test will come when
Santa Clara begins its offense against
the Card line. Will they hold or not?
j Coach Sprague. seems to think so,
I and if weight, plus intensive coaching,
| means anything, he shoulu be right.
I On offensive, too, the same line should
perform adequately because the
weight in it is backed up by charging
speed and power capable of opening
good holes.
At 10 o'clock, the freshman light-
I weights meet Chico High School on
the practice field.
The first-string freshman lineup is
as follows: Montgomery, left end; Ho
besky, left tackle; Maguire, left
i guard; Mustain, center; Jardine, right
{guard; Post, right tackle; Vincenti,
