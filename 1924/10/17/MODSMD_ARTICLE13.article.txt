# STANFORD BATTLES OREGON IN FIRST CONFERENCE CONTEST
## CARDS SHOULD DEFEA T LIGHT WEB-FOOT VARSITY TOMORROW Maddock Planning Torrid Reception For Red Shirts Despite Poor Early Season Performance 
### David Meiklejohn 
AREGON, light, inexperienced, and without reserve power, will pit its rootball
v resources against the somewhat crippled and doubtless strength of the
Cardinal in the first conference football game tomorrow afternoon at 3 o'clock.
This game may mean the rejuvenation of the Stanford hopes, and it might
mean a plunge into deeper pools of despair.
At any event Coach Joe Maddock of the Oregon varsity is planning a hot
time for Stanford varsity, despite the fact that his team is considered one
of the weakest in the Conference this year. He claims an improvement in
his squad since the feeble tie with Willamette in the first game his team

. played. Willamette lost to the ITniver
| slty ot' Washington 57 to 0 the week
following the game with Oregon.
While Washington can hardly be
said to be 57 points better than Ore
gon, it shows, in a general way, which
direction the wind blows. Oregon is
weak and Stanford is at least twenty
points better.
Oregon Fears Kicking
Oregon is afraid of the Stanford
kicking game, but it has evidently
been misled in thinking the Cards
have a kicker. It is one of the things
the Cardinals have not, and won't
have for perhaps another week.
What Oregon will have to worry
most over will be Stanford defense.
Maddock somewhat belittles the Stan
ford backfield —the favorite season
sport—and claims to have a line which
will stop it. Maddock probably didn't
hear about the Olympic Club game.
Stanford's strongest showing was
made through the center of the Olym
pic line. If Maddock can produce a
good pair of ends —and he has one
good one in Reed—his statement
might be taken at least half seriously.
Johnson a Star
Ward Johnson, veteran Oregon half
back, will not take part in the game
Saturday because of a sprained ankle.
Johnson made a good showing against
Stanford last year and was expected
to be a strong part of the offense this
season.
"The one thing," Maddock says,
"which Oregon will have to watch, is
keeping the first string intact." Two
injuries would do more to weaken thd
Oregon team than an earthquake could
do to Wall Street.
Jones, a fullback, who did his best
to kill every man on the Stanford
team last year, will be back at the
same position tomorrow. Maddock is
depending more on Jones' showing
than on the showing of his team as a
whole. Tough on Jones.
