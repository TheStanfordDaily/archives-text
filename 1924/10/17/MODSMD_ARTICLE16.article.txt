# We're Off!

### 
Two things are essential in order to throw the football season into full
blast. We must have the first rally and the first conference game. After
that the campus wears a pigskin crown, and the only fly in the ointment is
the prodigious length of the week intervening between football games.
That first rally was last night, and was a rousing festivity. Oregon
will oblige with the conference curtain-raiser tomorrow. A patched-up
and experimental line-up means nothing in the face of the statement "Pop"
Warner made at the Union last evening, when the impromptu rally
sneaked up on him.
"None of you have seen any real football yet —and neither have 1, but
wait until the Oregon game. . . ." remarked Mr. Warner, further strain
ing the student throats. Quite a statement for a coach to make. It won't
be hard to wait another day. Every man on the team is confident that
"Pop" will turn the trick, and these same men are intending to be "Pop's"
best friends when it comes to the show-down. The freshmen piled up 97
points last Saturday. The varsity didn't, but it won just the same. "Pop's"
real business is winning, and it adds nothing to his satisfaction to make
the opposition look ridiculous.
It may be a trifling point, but isn't it a bit reassuring that every coach
on the Stanford list wants somebody else to do the talking? When we
want vocal efforts we can turn to a phonograph or to the forthcoming
number of "Chaparral." feeling certain that the energy saved on the stu
dent Chautauqua platform will be poured into the varsity attack and de
fense. Football and oratory, like lions and lambs, seem ill-assorted com
panions. %
The rally, sprung without warning, brought out a splendid student
spirit. It is devoutly to be hoped that, no matter how much of a graduate
institution Stanford may become, it will still retain enough "collegiate"
enthusiasm to originate a terrific noise on the proper occasions.
THAT BAND of ours paraded for a while yesterday afternoon, and
showed clearly that it is several times more harmonious than ever before.
It is inspiring to imagine it creating honest-to-goodness and really profes
sional music in the Los Angeles Coliseum, and the "Daily" wishes its
members all success in raising the necessary funds.
STANFORD HAS rented a railroad and a big hotel for the U. S. C.
week-end. The question is, who will stay home to watch the Grid-graph ?

institution Stanford may become, it will still retain enough "collegiate"
enthusiasm to originate a terrific noise on the proper occasions.
THAT BAND of ours paraded for a while yesterday afternoon, and
showed clearly that it is several times more harmonious than ever before.
It is inspiring to imagine it creating honest-to-goodness and really profes
sional music in the Los Angeles Coliseum, and the "Daily" wishes its
members all success in raising the necessary funds.
STANFORD HAS rented a railroad and a big hotel for the U. S. C.
week-end. The question is, who will stay home to watch the Grid-graph ?
Two things are essential in order to throw the football season into full
blast. We must have the first rally and the first conference game. After
that the campus wears a pigskin crown, and the only fly in the ointment is
the prodigious length of the week intervening between football games.
That first rally was last night, and was a rousing festivity. Oregon
will oblige with the conference curtain-raiser tomorrow. A patched-up
and experimental line-up means nothing in the face of the statement "Pop"
Warner made at the Union last evening, when the impromptu rally
sneaked up on him.
"None of you have seen any real football yet —and neither have 1, but
wait until the Oregon game. . . ." remarked Mr. Warner, further strain
ing the student throats. Quite a statement for a coach to make. It won't
be hard to wait another day. Every man on the team is confident that
"Pop" will turn the trick, and these same men are intending to be "Pop's"
best friends when it comes to the show-down. The freshmen piled up 97
points last Saturday. The varsity didn't, but it won just the same. "Pop's"
real business is winning, and it adds nothing to his satisfaction to make
the opposition look ridiculous.
It may be a trifling point, but isn't it a bit reassuring that every coach
on the Stanford list wants somebody else to do the talking? When we
want vocal efforts we can turn to a phonograph or to the forthcoming
number of "Chaparral." feeling certain that the energy saved on the stu
dent Chautauqua platform will be poured into the varsity attack and de
fense. Football and oratory, like lions and lambs, seem ill-assorted com
panions. %
The rally, sprung without warning, brought out a splendid student
spirit. It is devoutly to be hoped that, no matter how much of a graduate
institution Stanford may become, it will still retain enough "collegiate"
enthusiasm to originate a terrific noise on the proper occasions.
