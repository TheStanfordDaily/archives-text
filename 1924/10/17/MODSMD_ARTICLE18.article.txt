"The one-ness of the human world,
independent investigation of truth,
universal peace, education, religion,
agreement of science and religionâ€”
these are some of the Bahai prnici
ples," said Mrs. Ella G. Cooper at a
meeting for world unity held at Miss
Yost's home last night.
Thirty people were present, and in
the future will meet weekly in the
Women's Clubhouse to discuss the
Bahai movements.
