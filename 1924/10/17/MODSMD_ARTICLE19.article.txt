better off with one complete eleven on
the field, but no subs present.
All three mentors have issued a call
for about twenty more men to come

first games will be played October 25.
Upperclassmen signing up for inter
class football or transferring to that
sport from some other activity will be
granted one unit of credit.
Meanwhile, the freshmen and sopho

group of thirty-five likely frosh. "Tiny"
Raffeto and Seraphim Post are coach
ing twenty sophomores, but say they
could use a few more.
