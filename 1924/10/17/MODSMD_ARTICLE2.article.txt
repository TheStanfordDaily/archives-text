# STANFORD SOCCER VARSITY TO MEET TAMALPAIS TEAM
## Better Teamwork Is Shown; Backfield to Be Filled By Veteran Players 
### Harry Bennett 
Crippled by the absence of Franklin
and Clark, the Stanford varsity soc
cer team will journey to Tamalpais
tomorrow to meet the Marin County
eleven on the Mount Tamlapais high
school grounds in what is expected to
be one of the hardest games of the
season.
At practice yesterday the team
looked to be in good condition with a
greater amount of teamwork shown.
Veterans in Field
The backfield is exceptionally strong
and is built around Don Clark and
Dave Clark, both veterans of last
year's varsity. Ta'am and Miron in the
line are also experienced men and,
with four of last year's freshmen in
the line-up, a strong combination is
formed.
Ralph Howe, varsity captain and
acting coach, was rated as one of the
best halfbacks on the coast last year
and now seems to be in his best form.
The second varsity is also ready for
a game tomorrow with the Palo Alto j
American Legion team in the Penin
sula League. This game is scheduled
to start at 1:30 on the field next to I
i
the stadium.
.
The second string men have been
working hard and have furnished the
varsity some strong opposition in the j
practice scrimmages held during the 1
past week. Three former freshman i
stars are in the line-up and Rogers
and Hoover are considered on a par
with the varsity men.
Thirty Babes Practicing
The freshman team is beginning to
take form with thirty men practicing
three times a week. Many of these '
freshmen are former high school stars |
and some have played on foreign j
teams, there being representatives of
France, Switzerland, and England.
