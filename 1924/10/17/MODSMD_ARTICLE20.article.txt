The capacity for sincerity is almost
entirely lacking in some individuals.
It seems to have been compensated
by a highly cultivated ability for dra
matizing ideas to bring about imme
diate (if fleeting) desires. "All the
world's a stage . . appears to be
the foundation of their philosophy; at

for a dying friendship on the other
person. It is an art.
James Reavis, 23 years old, received
his degree of Juris Doctor here this
year. A few days ago he acted as-judge
in the Superior Court of Bakersfield.
This summer a young lawyer, re
cently graduated from the Stanford
law school, was deploring the lack of
openings for young men of his profes
sion. He was looking about for an
assistantship, or "something."
Reavis was on the spot when a
judge was needed; the other was tell
ing someone his tale of woe. And some

Millions of people are provided with

teachers, booksellers, and newsmen
are to them mentally what Hart
Schaffner and Marx are physically.
The originator of poison gas is vis
iting America. He is Professor Fritz
Haber of Berlin. During the war he
was Germany's head chemist. He says,
"Every other country now knows more
about poison gas than Germany."

ing list. Will she respond to that state
ment with anything more than a suave
smile?
