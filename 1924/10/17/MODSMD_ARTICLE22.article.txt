# "EVOLUTION MAY BE MASTER KEY"-JORDAN
## 
### 
"There is no master key of the uni
verse, as we shall go right on learn
ing," said Dr. Jordan in his talk last
night at the Thursday Evening Con
ference. "A master key might be
found in the infinitely varied, or in
evolution, but there is none in the
way in which it has been used."
The master key of the universe is
the means of interpretation of that
which is constantly changing.
Many scientists have sought for this
key in the infinitely large things. The
astronomers have studied the heavens
in an effort to know how order comes
about. On the other hand the physi
cists who considered, formerly the
atom, now the electron, as the small
est possible mass of matter, find the
master key in the infinitely small
things.
According to Dr. Jordan, in the mys
tery of organization, where the master
key may be found in evolution, there
is something more striking than the
point of view of the astronomers and
the physicists.
