# W. T. LAYTON, LONDON EDITOR, WILL SPEAK ON EUROPEAN LEAGUE
## 
### 
Walter Thomas Layton, editor of
the London Economist, will give a talk
on "Reconstruction in Central Europe
Under the League of Nations," at 4:15
Wednesday afternoon in the Little
Theatre.
Layton, who arrived in Canada this
month, is speaking on the Pacific Coast
this month, and will attend a meeting
of the Academy of Political Science
from November 14 to 21.
He has been editor of the Economist
since 1922. And in addition to this ex
perience is especially well fitted to ap
proach his topic, due to his former
position of Director or the Economic
and Financial Section of the League of
Nations.

Freshman women at the Southern
Branch of the University of California
are made to toe the mark by the
sophomore co-eds. Green buttons, with
the word "Freshie" must be worn at
all times, and the sophomore benches
are strictly "off limits."
