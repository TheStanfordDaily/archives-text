# VARSITY AND 1927 TRACK MEN REPORT AT FIRST PRACTICE
## 
### 
Coach "Dink" Templeton's track and
field athletes have held their initial
workout of the year when a number
of last year's varsity and freshman
oinderpathers reported for practice.
As a means of keeping tab on his
men, and of developing new stars,
Templeton has devised a liling system
for use in his track class. Every
man out for track will be required to
compete in every field and track event
at least once during the quarter. His
best performances will be recorded on
a large card, and filed away for refer
ence.
This will not only give Templeton a
line on the material he has, but will
show the men the events for which
they are best fitted to train. This new
system will supplant the informal Fri
day meets of former seasons. â– 
Stanford, according to prospects,
stands in a good way to repeat last
year's victory over California. Very
few men have left the squad, and it
will be strengthened by the addition
of material from the 1927 freshman
team which was the first Stanford
freshman team to gain a victory over
California on the track.
Among those who worked out the
first day are: Work, high jumper, and
Meeks, broad jumper, both of whom
won their events in the freshman meet
last- year, and Hale, captain of the
varsity for the coming season.
