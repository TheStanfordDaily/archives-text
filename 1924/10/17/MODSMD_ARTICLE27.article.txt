The Law Association has adopted a
new constitution and made plans for
a smoker. The important feature of
the new constitution is the executive

the advisor of the president.

It is planned to hold a smoker this

dents to the Law School according to
Arthur Kent, president of the asso
ciation. Professor Clark Whittler was
announced to be the speaker at the
coming smoker. He will tell of his
trip to Europe last year and his ex
periences there.
