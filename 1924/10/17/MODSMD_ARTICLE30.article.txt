In Oxford University the athletic
letter man does not receive as high
ratiug as the scholar. Oxford men are
supposed to know one thing well.
Their course in the University is not
to give them a broadening effect, al
though the broadening effect may come
from college associations. The man
who takes a general course is looked
upon as being on a lower plane than
the "honor" man.
