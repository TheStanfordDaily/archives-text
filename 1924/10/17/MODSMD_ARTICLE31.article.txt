Irene Hardy was for some years a
member of the Stanford English de
partment in the early days of the Uni

valuable, because it gives the develop

part of the nineteenth century through \
the eyes of a college faculty member
of that time.
At Miss Hardy's death, the money
from her estate was deposited, and
the interest used for the Irene Hardy
Poetry Prize for undergraduate stu
dents, which is offered bi-annually. It
is being offered this year, manuscripts
to be submitted in the spring quarter.
There is no limitation as to form, I
length, or subject of the poem sub
mitted.
