# INITIAL FOOTBALL RALLY OF SEASON HELD LAST NIGHT
## Demonstration Spontaneous As Coach Warner and Jim Lawson Speak 
### 
I Football enthusiasm, which for
some time has been seething and
bubbling slowly over a small fire, blew
off the lid and flared forth in the form
of a spontaneous rally last night,
which quickly gained force as its
marchers neared the Union where
"Pop" Warner, his assistants, and
quarterbacks were scheming out new
ways of twisting the tail of the Golden
Bear.
Skyrockets echoing and re-echoing
from the foothills drowned the confer
ence and the schemers made their ap
pearance on the steps of the Union,
loosing the strings of even louder
cheers, which certaintlv would have
put the fear of Zeus in the Trojans had
they but heard.
The rally was featured by the play
ful little game of "Passing the Buck."
Warner started it but before he knew
what had happened found the buck
back in his own hands, which made
him appear in the role of a yell leader
—and enriched the rooting section
with a brand new yell which bids fair
to be one of the most popular in the
Stanford collection.
Real Football Saturday
Here's how it all happened: Warner
was called upon for a speech, and
after remarking that "None of you
have seen any football yet—and nei
ther have I, but wait until the Oregon
game and you will begin seeing it
quite regularly" went on to say that
Andy Kerr was the official speaker
of the team.
Jim Lawson was pushed forward
before Andy and he made the usual
football captain's speech, which no
one was able to hear, but which never
theless was deeply appreciated and
mightily applauded. When quiet
reigned once more, Kerr stepped out
and declined the offer to talk, adding
that "The silver-tongued orator from
Kentucky" was the logical candidate.
However, Kerr impressed upon his
listeners that the team was winning
and would continue to win, even
thougn the students were not getting
what they expected in the way of
scores.
Thornhill "Silver-Tongued"
The little giant, the silver-tongued
orator from Kentucky, "Tiny" Thorn
hill, or whatever you will call him, re
fused his title and then passed the
buck to "Dutch" McCallister, who
casually mentioned that "Pop" had a
new yell. Of course, that meant "Pop"
had to spring it, and he finally yielded
to the demands.
The new yell runs like this.
Stanford Varsity,
Rah, rah.
Stanford Varsity,
Hah, rah.
Hoo-rah, hoo-rah,
Stanford, Stanford,
Rah, rah, rah.
After learning it, five hundred men
sadly about faced and began the
search for history, citizenship, arid
what not.
Before the rally the members of the
Rally Committee met at the Sigma Chi
house for dinner, and followed the
food with a "6 to 8" at the Kappa
house.
