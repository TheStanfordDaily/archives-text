# THREE MARIONETTE PLAYS SCHEDULED TOMORROW NIGHT
## Guignol Type of Puppets Not Mechanical; Operated on Hands and Fingers 
### 
Guignol Marionettes will be operated
by G. Fletcher Clark and Celia Rantz
Clark in three plays in the Little
Theater at 7:30 o'clock tomorrow
night. Three plays will be included in
the program.
The humorously-grotesque, carved
wooden figures, are operated upon the
hands and fingers of the puppeteers,
and being in such intimate contact with
the performer, the "guignol" is not me
chanical, thus making it unusually pop
ular in the field of marionette art.
The purpose of the guignol marion
ette is primarily to amuse, but teach
ers and others interested in education
are becoming familiar with the pup
pets, since their applications to educa
tion are numerous. Experiments in
this direction have met with great suc
cess.
Originated in Ancient Egypt.
Originating in ancient Egypt, the
marionette was passed on by Greece
and Rome to modern Italy; from Italy
the marionettes are spread to every Eu
ropean country, taking on a charac
teristic form of development in each —
in England appeared the Punch-and-
Judy type —in France, the guignol mar
ionette.
It is noticed that almost every coun
try has had some form of puppet, but
as yet is still in the experimental stage.
Unique costuming and carving has had
much to do with making the art popu
lar.
The plays are: "The Singing Mas
ter," an amusing translation from the
French; "Doctor Faustus," a modern
ized comedy version of the medieval
legend; and "The Bird Feng," a ro
mance adapted from an Oriental fairy
tale.
