# CARDS DEFEAT OREGON 28-13 IN FIRST CONFERENCE GAME
## STANFORD MAKES BEST SHOWING OF YEAR AGAINST WEB-FOOTERS Sensational Open Field Runs By Bogue, Cleaveland, Anderson Bring Rooters' Cheers 
### David Meiklejohn 
OTRAIGHT, smashing football triumphed and a light but plucky Oregon
varsity went down under a 28 to 13 defeat before a new Stanford eleven
in the stadium last Saturday.
Oregon tried hard to keep its head out of the caldron of defeat. That open
field by Anderson in the first few minutes of play was no accident. It was a
perfect exhibition of interfrence and good team-work combined with Ander
son's plucky dodging.
Stanford won its first conference game. Stanford showed that, given a
situation which required playing, it could pull through with a victory. But
more than this —Norman Cleaveland came back into his own.

Cleaveland Sensational
It was sensational —Cleaveland's
performance. He carried the ball ten
times for a total of 129 yards. An
average of almost thirteen yeards to
each attempt. He kicked high and far
into Oregon His first few
punts brought surprised comment
from the spectators. Nobody really
thought Stanford had a kicker.
For the first time this season Stan
ford converted yjfrdage into touch
downs. Out of a total of 375 yards
from scrimmage the Cards succeded
in piling up four touchdowns and a
place kick. In the recent Olympic Club
game Stanford made even more yard
age and was lucky to get one touch
down.
George Bogue proved beyond further
doubt that he is a line-smasher, and
that his previous performances were
not accidents. He took the ball
eighteen times for a total of 129 yards,
one a 63-yard open field run. Bogue
surprised everyone on this run with
his speed. It had been known before
that Bogue could hit a line, but it was
a surprise to find that he could carry
the ball in an open field, around sev
eral tacklers and over the line for a
touchdown. That run of Bogue's might
mean the solution of the problem:
where to put Bogue when Ernie
Nevers is better!
Many Long Runs
There was a succession of sensa
tional end runs, beginning with An
derson's 79-yard gallop in the first
quarter, and continuing to the time
when Garthwaite broke loose toward
the end of the contest. Cleaveland got
away on two runs, one for 54 yards
and another for 47.
Oregon made the first score of the
game on Anderson's long run through
the line. Reed converted for Oregon
and the Cards were behind 7 to 0.
Cleaveland, not to be outdone, broke
away for a run of 54 yards and placed
the bitll on the Oregou 31-yard line.
But the Lemon-Yellow varsity held.
Lawson was forced to attempt a place
kick and succeeded, making the score
7 to 3.
Bucks Make First Score
Stanford carried the ball to the Ore
gon one-yard line before the first.
q\iarter ended, and bucked Bogue over
center for the first Stanford touch
down. Bogue scored again on a 63-
yard open field run, the result of a
fake criss-cross through the line.
It was Oregon's turn. A pass from
Jones to Mautz gave the Webfooters
their second and last touchdown be
fore the first half ended.
The third quarter was a rather weird
exhibition of fumbled ballH, poor buck
ing, and good defense. In the third
quarter, however, Stanford managed
to get within reaching distance of the
visitor's goal, and Cliff Hey, substi
tuted for Bogue, went over for the
Cards' final tally.
Stanford Line Steady
To the Stanford line goes the great
er credit. Especially to the spectacu
lar tackling of Fred Swan and "Tex"
Middleton, the good passing from
Baker to the backfteld, and Lawson's
work at end.
Lawson had some tough luck in con
verting after a touchdown. Cuddeback
was missed. In a game like the U. S.
C. game those three misses will mean
a great deal.
