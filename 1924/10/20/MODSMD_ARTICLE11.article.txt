# BABES GIVEN EDGE IN INTERIMS FOOTBALL
## Long Practice Period, Great Reserve Strength, Will Aid Yearlings 
### 
Athree weeks' head start in practice
and superior reserve strength give the
freshman eleven a decided edge in the
interclass grid series which starts Sat
urday.
The first-year men, under the coach
ing of Captain Jenkins, had anncred a
brace of victories over high school
teams before the other interclass squads
had started practice, and last Saturday
ran their string up to three with an
easy win over Chico high school while
the uppcrclass aggregations were strug
gling to learn signals.
Jenkins has H squad of fifty experi
enced men whom he can call on at any
time, and of this number there are two
complete teams of sufficient power to
make easy meat of any of the other
three classes. Both elevens are light,
hut are fast and work well together.
The hack field combination which
packs the stiffest punch is Riesncr at
quarter, Cowan and Wilson at half, and
Button at full. Riesncr is light, but
a heady field general; both Cowan and
Wilson can usually be counted upon
for substantial gains, the former spec
ializing in end runs; while Burton is
adept at running back punts.
Truman Good Quarter.
When tlx- need arises, Truman can
be shoved iti at quarter and also makes
a good safety man. Cass can relieve
Burton at full, and Miller and Cum
mins can assume the burden at half,
filler has an awkward style of run
ning. but when he once gets under way
he is a hard man to stop.
What the linesmen lack in weight
1 they make up for in aggressiveness.
Harter and Newcomc are a standoff at
center. As guards Stephens and Subi
eski rate highest, with Youd a close
third. Guthrie and Biaggini are two
tackles with plenty of fight, the former
especially distinguishing himself in the
( hieo game. Morris and Speer are not
far behind this pair.
At the wing positions Wheeler and
1 hompson have shown speed in getting
down under punts. Bryant and Stuart
are the second choices. The one weak
ness of the yearlings is in the kicking
department. Wolf has displayed the
most ability along this line, but he is
mediocre in other respects.
