# Why College?

### 
Last week, this column made bold to remark that the value of a college
education was a matter left largely to the individual aims and processes
of the collegian himself. Since then, a number of observations on that
same subject have come down from higher places, and a catalog of them
here perhaps would not be amiss.
Arthur Brisbane, in his column "Today," produces the following:
"E. W. Lord, dean of th<* Boston University College of Business Ad
ministration, says a college education is worth $72,000, and the college
man is at his best at 60, whereas the laborer is done for at 50.
"The average untrained man can earn $1,200, the high school graduate
$2,200, the college graduate $6,600.
"Interesting figures. Some college men are at their best at 60, but
many are worthless when they come out of college. And while some col
lege graduates earn $6,(?00 a year, other men with no college education
earn $6,000,000 a year. And there are many college men who do not earn
anything.
"A college education may be valuable, but it depends on the person
educated. You cari't inject education as you do morphine, and have it
work."
That is phrased in dollar-a-word skill, and is exactly what the "Daily"
was aiming at. And Dr. Jordan expressed himself recently along more
or less the same lines.
"One of the principle advantages of being college educated," said Dr.
Jordan, in essence, "is to teach a man that he belongs to himself, and to get
along by himself. In college a man goes through various stages; as a
freshman he is in the "rail rah" period; as a sophomore he goes through
the Rotarian stage —being a jolly good fellow; and then as a senior he
.should begin to leel his own individuality and be himself with no mark or
brand of outside ownership."
The predominating sentiment seems to be that college is chiefly of
•value as -concerned, one way and another, with personality and individ
uality. Why is it, then, that so many college men and women go about
constantly striving to conform to a pattern?
