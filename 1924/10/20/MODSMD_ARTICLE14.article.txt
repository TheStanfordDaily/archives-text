A news article with a Kansas City date-line states that Westminster
College of Fulton, Missouri, scored an overwhelming victory by audience
vote over the Oxford University debating team, led by Malcolm Mac-
Donald. The Englishmen were upholding the wet side of the question:
"Resolved, That this house is opposed to the principle of prohibition," as
they will continue to do throughout their tour of the country.
It will be interesting to follow the'newspaper records of this tour.
The members of the audience in Kansas City refused to allow these young
men to talk them out of their allegiance to Congress and its thoroughly
discussed legislation. Whether or not the decision was a triumph for un
biased judgment, it was certainly one for national loyalty. It would be
difficult for an audience to be unbiased on this question. To vote the wet
side would be to brand ones self as a scofflaw, however potent the argu
ments of the Britishers. , ♦
Also it clearly indicates that Stanford's motto of tolerance is applicable
to a large number of universities. Time was when such a "questionable"
topic would not have been allowed to soil the goody-good ethics of an insti
tution of learning. Now it is probable that the eloquence of scattered
American university debaters will, at the expense of Oxford, bring many
unwilling converts to the cause of prohibition.
