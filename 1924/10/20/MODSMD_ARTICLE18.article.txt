# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT

Editor Daily Palo Alto:
For the past few years, we have
been asking ourselves why the Stan
ford men and women fail to get ac
quainted. It is in the hope of throwing
some light upon this much-discussed
question that this article is contri
buted.
The annual reception of Roble club,
which is the official introduction of
the new women to the social life of
the campus, was given Saturday night.
The dance, in so far as" its purpose
was concerned, was a complete failure.
In the first place, the hostesses
seemed to feel no sense of responsi
bility in finding partners for the girls.
In fact, some girls were not intro
duced to even one man during the
entire evening, though it was quite
noticeable that the hostesses never
lacked partners.
However, not all the blame lay with
the hostesses. Most of the men seemed
to be unaware of the reason for which
they were invited, judging by the
purely ornamental capacity in which
they served. It seems incredible that
a Stanford man, after being introduced
to a girl would nonchalantly walk
away without asking her to dance.
Yet, this occurred repeatedly during
the evening. These men didn't even
have the excuse that the girls were
too homely or dumb to be tolerated, for
some of the most attractive girls sat
out a miserable evening. Why not in
vite some of the new men who are
eager to get acquainted, instead of
men who are already satiated with so
cial functions?
This situation has existed in the
two previous receptions, but it seemed
even worse this year. The writer is
not a new student and therefore
speaks from an impersonal standpoint.
A SENIOR.
To the Editor:
As a member of the Associated Stu
dents of Stanford University, am
vitally interested in student affairs. It
has come to me that the Rally com
mittee has decided for the student
body which way we would like to
travel to the U. S. C. game and they
have decided that the Southern Pacific
specials are the best. The Los Angeles
Steamship Company offered their ser
vices, but it seems they were not given
a fair chance.
It seems to me that there is a great
inefficiency somewhere; for any com
mittee for the welfare of students
which deliberately turns down the best
means of transportation for some in
ferior means without consulting the
student body as a whole nor the alum
nu as a whole is in deep water.
There are two means of transporta
tion: the boat, leaving San Francisco
for Los Angeles at 4 p.m. on Friday,
the 7th, and the train which leaves the
same day from Palo Alto for Los An
geles. The steamship company pro
vides each student who travels upon
this excursion with a berth and all
meals to Lps Angeles and return for
$2.50. The Southern Pacific company
offers each student one-half of a bunk,
without meals, to Los Angeles and re
turn, for $21.50. It is surely a mistake
that any seriously, logiqally-minded
student committee should vote in fa
vor for the train and then come back
with the statement that the students
and alumni are in favor of it. It is in
deed Very peculiar. I do not believe
the students have even been con
sidered.
