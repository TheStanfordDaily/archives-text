# Graduate Women Hockey Players Organize Team
## 
### 
More graduate women are urged to
report for hockey by Miss Helen Mas
ters Bunting, director of women's phy
sical education. A number of graduates
are at present playing hockey and a few
more are needed for the formation of a
graduate women's team. A squad of at
least fifteen is necessary.
Practices will come on Tuesday's
and Thursdays at 4:20. The graduates
will play against the seniors until the
interclass games, when it will compete
in the series as a regulation squad. All
graduate women who wish to sign up
may do so by seeing iss Bunting in
her office in Roble gymnasium.

I was asked last night by an alum
nus why was that the student body
voted in favor of the train when for a
dollar more they could ride comfort
ably and eat well, with a party down
and a party back. I had been informed
that the alumni were in favor of the
train but it seems that instead of con
sulting the alumni the committee
rather notified them that the trains
were the means adopted.
Probably if you would start discus
sion in your paper about this we may
come to the truth in tlie matter. I am
anxious to get to the bottom of it.
ONE WHO IS INTERESTED.
