# Allen to Play Composition By Harvey Grace Tuesday
## 
### 
"Meditation in Ancient Tonality," by
Harvey Grace will be the first number
played by Warren D. Allen, L T niversity
organist, at the recital in the Memorial
Church at 4:15 Tuesday afternoon.
Grace is an English composer and
scholar whose music and critical writ
ings show the results of profound re
search. i In this piece he shows a sym
pathetic feeling for the Gregorian style
and effectively introduces the old hymn,
"Ave Maris stella."
"In Dulci Jubilo," by Bach, and the
"Toccata on a rcgorian Theme," by Ed
ward Barnes, will be included in the
program. The last selection will be
variations on "Lasst uns gehen," and
the Festal Prelude on "Ein Feste
Burg" by Fritz Reuter.

A committee, headed by Grace Judd,
was appointed by Carolan Strouse,
president of Associated Women, to
draft an amendment to the Constitu
tion which would cover a future similar
situation.
