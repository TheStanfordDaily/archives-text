# SOCCER TEAM TIES MARIN COUNTY, 0-0
## 
### 
Showing much better teamwork than
;it previous times this year the varsity
soccer team held the Marin county
team to a 0-0 score on the Tamalpais
liigh school grounds last Saturday,
while on the campus the l'alo Alto
American Legion team defeated the
second string men 2-0.
Don Clark, left full hack, was the in
dividual star of the game and with
Dave Clark and the halves kept the
Marin county eleven on the defense
throughout the entire second half.
Marin county had a strong line-up and
its goal guard played an exceptionally
good game, robbing Stanford of scores
several times.
"The varsity forwards are getting
down to good working and <c great im
provement was shown over the Olympic
club game," Bill Quigly, one of the
players, said in speaking of the game.
"The team is gradually rounding into
shape for the California game on No
vember 11."
. The second string men had never
played together before as a unit and
lack of teamwork is attributed to be
the cause of their defeat.
Australia, if placed in the Pacific
ocean would occupy all the space be
tween England and North America.
