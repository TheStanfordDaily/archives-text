# COACH BRANDSTEN OUTLINES WORK OF CARDINAL MERMEN
## Stanford Swimming Facilities Compare Favorably With Olympic Equipment 
### 
"Come in often and get acquainted
with the rest of the fellows so that
they will know that you are out." said
Swimming Coach Ernie Brandsten, in
his welcome to the new swimmers who
have turned out for the team. "If you
see some likely prospect, bring him
around to the pool. Many will not
come of their own accord, but if given
a little encouragement, will make
good swimmers. And haul in all of the
fat boys. They do not have to know
how to swim. They can float, and with
a little coaching, can plunge."
Ernie then told of the opportunities
that Stanford offers for athletes. "I
was at the Olympic games in Paris
this past summer, and while our fa
cilities are less elaborate, they are
larger and better equipped.
"There are plans under way for the
future construction of a 300-foot tank
between the pavilion and the gymna
sium. When that is completed, Stan
ford will have no rival as far as equip
ment is concerned. At present, besides
the Eneina pool, we have two lakes,
Lagunita and Searsville. While they
are both dry this season for the first
time in thirty-five years, every facility
for competitive swimming meets is
provided in each.
Big Swimming Program
"We have a big program ahead of
us for this year," Ernie continued.
"Stanford's prowess in aquatic events
j is recognized all over the country. In
the recent Olympic games, Stanford
had seven men on America's team,
more than any other single organiza
tion in the country."
The Pacific Athletic Assoociation
championship meet at the Olympic
Club on October 24 and 25 will furnish
our team with some real competition,"
says Brandsten. He hopes to retaliate
for the defeat that the wearers of the
Winged "O" administered a year ago.
There are also negotiations under way
for a dual meet with the Hollywood
Athletic Club team on the day before
the U. S. C. game, but as yet no defi
nite arangements have been made.
Winter quarter Is always the biggest
quarter for the mermen. Besides the
Big Meet with the team from Cali
fornia, numerous other dual meets are
being arranged. The yearlings, also,
have hail offers to compete with both
the Lowell and Berkeley high schools
in swimming meets and water polo
games. Polo is an innovation for the
freshmen, but with Edward Luster, a
veteran placer, for a nucleus, Ernie
hopes to build a fine team.
In the spring quarter, the junior
championship meets will be held. Any
one is eligible to these who has never
won a first place in a senior meet.
Ernie has put in bids for four na
tional championships to be held here
this coming year, the junior and senior
low and high diving titles. He has also
put in bids for the Pacific Athletic As
sociation water polo meets. If he is
successful in bringing these events to
the University, talent from all over
the country will come here to partici
pate, and it is from the outside talent
that we must pick our fufure teams.
"So work for the new men to turn
out, concluded Ernie, "and get the
good prospects to come to Stanford."
