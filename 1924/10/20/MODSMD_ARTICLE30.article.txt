# KEATING, FOUNDER OF D. P. A.. VISITS STANFORD CAMPUS
## 
### 
John A. Keating. Stanford '04, and
: one of the founders of the Daily Palo I
| Alto, was on the campus last Friday.
| Keating transferred to the then newly ,
j established Stanford, from the Univer-'
i sity of Michigan at the end of his fresh-1
j man year. There was quite an active
| daily paper at Ann Arbor and he felt:
|it was a pity not to have one here. So |
i at the beginning of the following year, j
he and a friend of his, Carl Clemens, j
the great football hero of those days,
came back to college about two weeks:
i early in order to organize a paper,
i They had no capital and very few i
j workers. However, they went to San
j Francisco and all the near-by towns
and sold advertising in order to get the 1
| money to start the paper. Keating said j
j that when lie went to one dealer and
i said he was a Stanford student, the;
man reached for the student's directory
| to see if he were telling the truth.
Staff Organized.
Finally, they got the staff organized.
| and had the first issue published in Red
i wood City. It was a terrible task, and :
; the paper was not off the press until
j late at night. Then, with the Daily j
once in existence, Keating and Clemens !
i had a very difficult time in getting
j enough subscriptions to keep it alive, j
There were, at that time, very few stu-!
j dents at Stanford with any money, and :
j a college paper seemed to most of them
i a very unnecessary expense.
| Keating was not greatly interested in
the editorial side of the news game, and
| so when the Daily was once firmly on
its feet, he resigned. He was much in- :
tcrested in going over the plant, the
other day. and in seeing the size and |
j scope of the organization. Of passing i
interest is the fact that most of his work
| since his college days has been some ;
j sort of organizing.
Both Keating and Clemens have
i daughters among the new women who !
! entered Stanford this fall.

John A. Keating. Stanford '04, and
: one of the founders of the Daily Palo I
| Alto, was on the campus last Friday.
| Keating transferred to the then newly ,
j established Stanford, from the Univer-'
i sity of Michigan at the end of his fresh-1
j man year. There was quite an active
| daily paper at Ann Arbor and he felt:
|it was a pity not to have one here. So |
i at the beginning of the following year, j
he and a friend of his, Carl Clemens, j
the great football hero of those days,
came back to college about two weeks:
i early in order to organize a paper,
i They had no capital and very few i
j workers. However, they went to San
j Francisco and all the near-by towns
and sold advertising in order to get the 1
| money to start the paper. Keating said j
j that when lie went to one dealer and
i said he was a Stanford student, the;
man reached for the student's directory
| to see if he were telling the truth.
Staff Organized.
Finally, they got the staff organized.
| and had the first issue published in Red
i wood City. It was a terrible task, and :
; the paper was not off the press until
j late at night. Then, with the Daily j
once in existence, Keating and Clemens !
i had a very difficult time in getting
j enough subscriptions to keep it alive, j
There were, at that time, very few stu-!
j dents at Stanford with any money, and :
j a college paper seemed to most of them
i a very unnecessary expense.
| Keating was not greatly interested in
the editorial side of the news game, and
| so when the Daily was once firmly on
its feet, he resigned. He was much in- :
tcrested in going over the plant, the
other day. and in seeing the size and |
j scope of the organization. Of passing i
interest is the fact that most of his work
| since his college days has been some ;
j sort of organizing.
Both Keating and Clemens have
i daughters among the new women who !
! entered Stanford this fall.
