# ENGINEERS TO HEAR TALK FROM GENERAL ELECTRIC OFFICIAL
## 
### 
F. W. Peek, Jr., '05. consulting engi
neer of the General Elictric Company
will give an illustrated talk on "Light
ning in the Laboratory and in Nature,"
to engineers and physicists at 11 o'clock !
tomorrow morning in the Little
Theatre.
Peek, who lias been attending the ;
Pacific Coast national convention of the
American Institute of Electrical Engi- j
neers in Pasadena, is known interna-!
tionally for bis researches in high volt-,
age phenomena. At the convention he :
presented a paper on "Lightning and;
Other Transients on Transmission i
Lines," the report of which appeared in
the* September issue of "Time."
He is further known for his determi- j
nation of the fundamentals that control ;
the engineering design of the insulations
required for the generation, transmis
sion and reception of power at 220,000
volts.
Designed Generator.
Peek designed the present 2,000,000
volt lightning generator and directs the
researches on its use in the great high I

voltage laboratory of the General Elec
trif company at Pittsfield, Mass.
He was awarded a gold medal by the
American Civil Engineers in October,
1922, at the meeting in San Francisco,
for contributions to the water .supply
and power industry through high volt
age researches.
One of the texts used in the engi
neering department here is Peek's
"Dialectric Phenomena in High Volt
age Engineering," published in 1915.
