# REMAINS MAY SHOW NEVADA AS CRADLE OF CIVILIZATION
## Archaeological Circles Now Stirred by Discovery Made Last Summer 
### 
A recent expedition in Nevada held
during the spring and summer months!
has stirred up a great deal of interest
in archaeological circles as to the possi
bility of Nevada's being the cradle of
the human race instead of Asia or
Africa as has always been thought hith
erto.
Cascadia, the region in which these
discoveries have been made, was in
prehistoric times an island, and has es
caped the glacial sheets and was never
submerged in topographical changes.
It is therefore aboriginal land and the
remains on it have never been disturbed.
Crude Writings Found.
A great many stones were found
bearing a crude picture writing. On
closer examination, these hieroglyphics
seemed to be like or identical with a
number of Egyptian, Chaldean and
Babylonian hieroglyphics. This has
been stated bj' Dr. G. Elliott Smith,
professor of anatomy at the University
of London, who was then giving a lec
ture course at the summer session at
Berkeley. Dr. Smith has a decided
standing as an Egyptologist, an anthro
nologist, and an archaeologist. He said
that undoubtedly the remains were of
great age.
After this expression of opinion, Dr.
H. Rushton Fairclough, head of the
Classical department of Stanford and
vice-president of the Archaeological In
stitute of America, was called north to
see the remains, Dr. Fairclough refused
to commit himself definitely as to the
age of these hieroglyphics as compared
with those of Egypt. He said that
without any human remains, it would
be impossible to tell, though he believed
these hieroglyphics to be as old as those
in Egypt, nad that he should not be
surprised if it were ultimately found
that life had started in America.
Human Remains Not Found.
No human bones have yet been
found. A hill of tombs has been dis
covered and many of the tombs opened,
but a little yellowish dust is all that
has been discovered. If human bones
can only be found, most of the theories
will be definitely proved or disproved.
In addition to animal remains, many
petrified trees have been discovered
which prove the great age of Cascadia.
Some of these trees, petrified for thou
sands of years, are almost identical to
the giant sequoias, and may be millions
of years old.
