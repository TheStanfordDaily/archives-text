# Student Collects Books Abandoned In Window Sills
## 
### 
The world's dumbest person has
been found, according to a story that
leaked out today from the Lost and
Found window in the accouutant's of
fice. This person, whose name is with-
Ueld tor fear of a riot, did not know
that it was a custom for students to
leave books and other belongings in
the window sills on the Quad.
Thinking the many valuables he
found in the window sills to be lost
or discarded property he collected
everything in sight and turned it in
to the Lost and Found window. When
this feat was accomplished it took the
Lost and Found secretary just six
hours to try to identify the articles
and send a note of their whereabouts
to the many owners.
This window is the only official Lost
and Found department on the campus.
Every article turned in is numbered
and if there is a name on it a postcard
is sent to its owner. If it is not claimed
within two weeks the article is re
turned to the finder, while if it is
books that are not called for they are
turned over to the appointment office
library for the use of self-supporting
students.
There are now a great many articles
that were found at the end of spring
quarter but these will soon be turned
over to the ppointment office if they
are not claimed.
The janitors around the buildings
are instructed to turn in anything that
appears to be lost but they adhere
strictly to the custom of leaving any
thing in the window sills untouched.
Feeling that it is useless to keep
track of the articles without the co
operation of the students the Lost and
Found secretary urges that the stu
dents turn in any found articles imme
diately.
