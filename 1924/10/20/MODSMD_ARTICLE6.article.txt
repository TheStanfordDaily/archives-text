# FRESHMEN DOWN BRONCOS IN STRONG FINISH, 27-3
## Santa Clara Starts With Spectacular Offense; Makes First Score 
### Douglas Meservey 
With a poor starL which made vic
tory look quite uncertain, but a smash
ing finish, the Card freshman eleven
defeated Santa Clara's babes 27 to 3
last Saturday.
Expecting to see the Broncos smoth
ered under a highly-touted offensive
attack, Stanford fans were sadly dis
appointed when Cummings of Santa
Clara run back the kick-off 40 yards
as the beginning of a spectacular of
fense on the part of the Broncos. This
wjus followed by effective line-bucks
and a well-executed pass which netted
them 26 yards more, giving both the
fans and the Card eleven something
serious to think about. Even then, the
Bronc offense could not be stayed and
before many minutes Santa Clara had
the ball on Stanford's 15-yrd liaue —
certainly within scoring distance. But
fumbles prove costly to most teams
and one by Chisholm at this point cost
his team a probable six points, giving
the ball to the Cards.
Connelly Scores
A drop-kick by Connelly near the
epd of the first quarter was the first
and last tally bx the Saints and the
end of the period gave Coach "Husky"
Hunt's charges a "breathing" point
which marked the turn of the tide.
From then on, the Card freshmen's
backers breathed easier for, as a re
sult ol' wide sweeps by Hill and Pabst,
the ball was advanced into Bronco
territory and carried over by Hill near
the end of the period. Millage con
i verted.
But one should not lay blame upon
the Stanford babes for any probable
j weaknesses in that first quarter. The
j fact is, that facing them was a well
balanced team, strengthened by the
i presence of four varsity regulars and
two substitutes of the eleven which
held California to 12 to 6 September
27. It seemed merely the opposition
of one strong team by another and
| Santa Clara's effective offensive the
first quarter was probably the result
'of surprise on the part of the Cards.
Hunt Satisfied
But Hunt believes that) "all's well
, that ends well" and the way his back
i field wore down the Broncs in the
second quarter gives evidence of the
belief. Millage scored near the end of
the half after off-tackle bucks and
! sweeps by Hill and Pabst, and Clark,
substituting, converted.
Perhaps the most apparent weak
, ness of Santa Clara that first half was
its ability to be offside and to illegally
