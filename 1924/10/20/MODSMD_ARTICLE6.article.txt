# FRESHMEN DOWN BRONCOS IN STRONG FINISH, 27-3
## Santa Clara Starts With Spectacular Offense; Makes First Score 
### Douglas Meservey 
With a poor starL which made vic
tory look quite uncertain, but a smash
ing finish, the Card freshman eleven
defeated Santa Clara's babes 27 to 3
last Saturday.
Expecting to see the Broncos smoth
ered under a highly-touted offensive
attack, Stanford fans were sadly dis
appointed when Cummings of Santa
Clara run back the kick-off 40 yards
as the beginning of a spectacular of
fense on the part of the Broncos. This
wjus followed by effective line-bucks
and a well-executed pass which netted
them 26 yards more, giving both the
fans and the Card eleven something
serious to think about. Even then, the
Bronc offense could not be stayed and
before many minutes Santa Clara had
the ball on Stanford's 15-yrd liaue —
certainly within scoring distance. But
fumbles prove costly to most teams
and one by Chisholm at this point cost
his team a probable six points, giving
the ball to the Cards.
Connelly Scores
A drop-kick by Connelly near the
epd of the first quarter was the first
and last tally bx the Saints and the
end of the period gave Coach "Husky"
Hunt's charges a "breathing" point
which marked the turn of the tide.
From then on, the Card freshmen's
backers breathed easier for, as a re
sult ol' wide sweeps by Hill and Pabst,
the ball was advanced into Bronco
territory and carried over by Hill near
the end of the period. Millage con
i verted.
But one should not lay blame upon
the Stanford babes for any probable
j weaknesses in that first quarter. The
j fact is, that facing them was a well
balanced team, strengthened by the
i presence of four varsity regulars and
two substitutes of the eleven which
held California to 12 to 6 September
27. It seemed merely the opposition
of one strong team by another and
| Santa Clara's effective offensive the
first quarter was probably the result
'of surprise on the part of the Cards.
Hunt Satisfied
But Hunt believes that) "all's well
, that ends well" and the way his back
i field wore down the Broncs in the
second quarter gives evidence of the
belief. Millage scored near the end of
the half after off-tackle bucks and
! sweeps by Hill and Pabst, and Clark,
substituting, converted.
Perhaps the most apparent weak
, ness of Santa Clara that first half was
its ability to be offside and to illegally
hold, causing it to lose some fifty-five
yards with the resultant gain for Stan
ford. The busiest official on the field
during the two periods was the head
linesman.
Millage, who was unable to gain
through the line to any great degree
the start of the game, found going
easit-r in the third quarter and time
and again made yardage through holes
opened by his first line of offense. It
may have been the substitution of
Bigelow and Everett, regular first
string men who did not start, that
helped to open the holes which were
not made the first quarter, but never
theless, the line did improve its at
tack. It was also here that Santa Clara
not only failed to gain at the start of
the second quarter but found hard
going the remaining quarters.
Bigelow Snares Pass
After a brilliant but useless run of
Hill's in the third quarter —-brilliant
because he outwitted at least four
tackles who had "clear titles' 'to him,
and useless because Stanford had been
offside on the play—and an exchange
of punts, Bigelow, 207-pound guard,
attempted to show Hunt that he was
really cut for a speedy half. Santa
Clara had just intercepted a Card pass
when Bigelow returned the favor on
the Broncs' 35-yard line, shook off
three surprised Santa Clarans, and
across the zero line with
two more hanging on him for another
touchdown. Millage converted.
A pass for nineteen yards, Clark to
I)orcy, a few minutes after the next
kick-off, followed by an end run by
Dorcy of five yards, enabled the latter
to touch the ball across the line for
the fourth and last six points. The
final gun prevented the already inef
fective passing attack of Santa Clara
from giving them yardage.
Chico Defeated
Previous to this game, the light
freshmen easily overcame Chico high

by a score of 30 to 0. The babes were
particularly strong on defensive work.
Touchdowns were scored by Miller,
Cowan, Burton 2, and Cass.

two substitutes of the eleven which
held California to 12 to 6 September
27. It seemed merely the opposition
of one strong team by another and
| Santa Clara's effective offensive the
first quarter was probably the result
'of surprise on the part of the Cards.
Hunt Satisfied
But Hunt believes that) "all's well
, that ends well" and the way his back
i field wore down the Broncs in the
second quarter gives evidence of the
belief. Millage scored near the end of
the half after off-tackle bucks and
! sweeps by Hill and Pabst, and Clark,
substituting, converted.
Perhaps the most apparent weak
, ness of Santa Clara that first half was
its ability to be offside and to illegally
hold, causing it to lose some fifty-five
yards with the resultant gain for Stan
ford. The busiest official on the field
during the two periods was the head
linesman.
Millage, who was unable to gain
through the line to any great degree
the start of the game, found going
easit-r in the third quarter and time
and again made yardage through holes
opened by his first line of offense. It
may have been the substitution of
Bigelow and Everett, regular first
string men who did not start, that
helped to open the holes which were
not made the first quarter, but never
theless, the line did improve its at
tack. It was also here that Santa Clara
not only failed to gain at the start of
the second quarter but found hard
going the remaining quarters.
Bigelow Snares Pass
After a brilliant but useless run of
Hill's in the third quarter —-brilliant
because he outwitted at least four
tackles who had "clear titles' 'to him,
and useless because Stanford had been
offside on the play—and an exchange
of punts, Bigelow, 207-pound guard,
attempted to show Hunt that he was
really cut for a speedy half. Santa
Clara had just intercepted a Card pass
when Bigelow returned the favor on
the Broncs' 35-yard line, shook off
three surprised Santa Clarans, and
across the zero line with
two more hanging on him for another
touchdown. Millage converted.
A pass for nineteen yards, Clark to
I)orcy, a few minutes after the next
kick-off, followed by an end run by
Dorcy of five yards, enabled the latter
to touch the ball across the line for
the fourth and last six points. The
final gun prevented the already inef
fective passing attack of Santa Clara
from giving them yardage.
Chico Defeated
Previous to this game, the light
freshmen easily overcame Chico high

by a score of 30 to 0. The babes were
particularly strong on defensive work.
Touchdowns were scored by Miller,
Cowan, Burton 2, and Cass.

With a poor starL which made vic
tory look quite uncertain, but a smash
ing finish, the Card freshman eleven
defeated Santa Clara's babes 27 to 3
last Saturday.
Expecting to see the Broncos smoth
ered under a highly-touted offensive
attack, Stanford fans were sadly dis
appointed when Cummings of Santa
Clara run back the kick-off 40 yards
as the beginning of a spectacular of
fense on the part of the Broncos. This
wjus followed by effective line-bucks
and a well-executed pass which netted
them 26 yards more, giving both the
fans and the Card eleven something
serious to think about. Even then, the
Bronc offense could not be stayed and
before many minutes Santa Clara had
the ball on Stanford's 15-yrd liaue —
certainly within scoring distance. But
fumbles prove costly to most teams
and one by Chisholm at this point cost
his team a probable six points, giving
the ball to the Cards.
Connelly Scores
A drop-kick by Connelly near the
epd of the first quarter was the first
and last tally bx the Saints and the
end of the period gave Coach "Husky"
Hunt's charges a "breathing" point
which marked the turn of the tide.
From then on, the Card freshmen's
backers breathed easier for, as a re
sult ol' wide sweeps by Hill and Pabst,
the ball was advanced into Bronco
territory and carried over by Hill near
the end of the period. Millage con
i verted.
But one should not lay blame upon
the Stanford babes for any probable
j weaknesses in that first quarter. The
j fact is, that facing them was a well
balanced team, strengthened by the
i presence of four varsity regulars and

attempted to show Hunt that he was
really cut for a speedy half. Santa
Clara had just intercepted a Card pass
when Bigelow returned the favor on
the Broncs' 35-yard line, shook off
three surprised Santa Clarans, and
across the zero line with
two more hanging on him for another
touchdown. Millage converted.
A pass for nineteen yards, Clark to
I)orcy, a few minutes after the next
kick-off, followed by an end run by
Dorcy of five yards, enabled the latter
to touch the ball across the line for
the fourth and last six points. The
final gun prevented the already inef
fective passing attack of Santa Clara
from giving them yardage.
Chico Defeated
Previous to this game, the light
freshmen easily overcame Chico high

by a score of 30 to 0. The babes were
particularly strong on defensive work.
Touchdowns were scored by Miller,
Cowan, Burton 2, and Cass.

With a poor starL which made vic
tory look quite uncertain, but a smash
ing finish, the Card freshman eleven
defeated Santa Clara's babes 27 to 3
last Saturday.
Expecting to see the Broncos smoth
ered under a highly-touted offensive
attack, Stanford fans were sadly dis
appointed when Cummings of Santa
Clara run back the kick-off 40 yards
as the beginning of a spectacular of
fense on the part of the Broncos. This
wjus followed by effective line-bucks
and a well-executed pass which netted
them 26 yards more, giving both the
fans and the Card eleven something
serious to think about. Even then, the
Bronc offense could not be stayed and
before many minutes Santa Clara had
the ball on Stanford's 15-yrd liaue —
certainly within scoring distance. But
fumbles prove costly to most teams
and one by Chisholm at this point cost
his team a probable six points, giving
the ball to the Cards.
Connelly Scores
A drop-kick by Connelly near the
epd of the first quarter was the first
and last tally bx the Saints and the
end of the period gave Coach "Husky"
Hunt's charges a "breathing" point
which marked the turn of the tide.
From then on, the Card freshmen's
backers breathed easier for, as a re
sult ol' wide sweeps by Hill and Pabst,
the ball was advanced into Bronco
territory and carried over by Hill near
the end of the period. Millage con
i verted.
But one should not lay blame upon
the Stanford babes for any probable
j weaknesses in that first quarter. The
j fact is, that facing them was a well
balanced team, strengthened by the
i presence of four varsity regulars and
two substitutes of the eleven which
held California to 12 to 6 September
27. It seemed merely the opposition
of one strong team by another and
| Santa Clara's effective offensive the
first quarter was probably the result
'of surprise on the part of the Cards.
Hunt Satisfied
But Hunt believes that) "all's well
, that ends well" and the way his back
i field wore down the Broncs in the
second quarter gives evidence of the
belief. Millage scored near the end of
the half after off-tackle bucks and
! sweeps by Hill and Pabst, and Clark,
substituting, converted.
Perhaps the most apparent weak
, ness of Santa Clara that first half was
its ability to be offside and to illegally
hold, causing it to lose some fifty-five
yards with the resultant gain for Stan
ford. The busiest official on the field
during the two periods was the head
linesman.
Millage, who was unable to gain
through the line to any great degree
the start of the game, found going
easit-r in the third quarter and time
and again made yardage through holes
opened by his first line of offense. It
may have been the substitution of
Bigelow and Everett, regular first
string men who did not start, that
helped to open the holes which were
not made the first quarter, but never
theless, the line did improve its at
tack. It was also here that Santa Clara
not only failed to gain at the start of
the second quarter but found hard
going the remaining quarters.
Bigelow Snares Pass
After a brilliant but useless run of
Hill's in the third quarter —-brilliant
because he outwitted at least four
tackles who had "clear titles' 'to him,
and useless because Stanford had been
offside on the play—and an exchange
of punts, Bigelow, 207-pound guard,
attempted to show Hunt that he was
really cut for a speedy half. Santa
Clara had just intercepted a Card pass
when Bigelow returned the favor on
