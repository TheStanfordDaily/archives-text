### Paul H. Wayte 
Charles E. Worster, 7»> years of age,
jand nightwatchman at Encina hall for
the last nine years, will give up his
position at the end of this month to
retire from active duties. The Univer
sity has granted him a pension for
long and faithful service not only in
'his present, position but also for Sen
;ator Stanford and his family.
Worster has been a father to Encina
men ever since he took the position
I and there are hundreds of men both
■ in school and out who know him by
no other name than "Dad."
Since the transferring of all the
! upperclassmen to Toyon and Branner
"Dad" has had a bigger responsibility
than ever in taking care of the fresh
men. With a new influx of men into
the hall every year he has felt a loss
j because the boys whom he knew dur
ing their first year moved out, and he
has to start about the business of
becoming acquainted all over again.
Came From New York
Worster came to Palo Alto from Al
bany, New York, in 1809, bringing a
pair of coach horses from New York
which Senator Stanford had bought
from E. Lothrop, Stanford's brother
in-law. As "Dad" tells the story, he
hesitated very much to take the job
because he dreaded coming across
jthe isthmus which was at that time

very unhealthy because of the yellow
fever and poor sanitation. When being
told by Lothrop -that the transcointi
nental railroad had been completed he
finally consented to the transfer from
one master to another.
"Dad" took care of the Senator's
horses and drove his carriage for him
np to his death in 1893. lie continued
in the services of Mrs. Stanford, work
ing around the old Stanford home.
After the death of Mrs. Stanford he
worked around the Stanford tomb, tak
ing care of the flowers and lawn, and
finally in 1915 he took over the posi
tion of nightwatchman of Encina hall
which he has held up to this time.
Knows Traditions
Worster, having been here ever
since the University has been in oper
ation, probably knows more Stanford
traditions than any man living. He
was here when Senator Stanford first
made plans for a university and Palm
Drive was laid out. The lamps which
are at the entrance of Palm Drive were
taken from the. old Stanford home,
"Dad" states.
"D.-id" says that he is coming back
to Encina hall every time there is a
dance because he "enjoys watching
the hoys and girls trip the light fan
tastic and having watched them for so
many years doesn't want to lose out
on any of the latest steps and music.

Knows Traditions
Worster, having been here ever
since the University has been in oper
ation, probably knows more Stanford
traditions than any man living. He
was here when Senator Stanford first
made plans for a university and Palm
Drive was laid out. The lamps which
are at the entrance of Palm Drive were
taken from the. old Stanford home,
"Dad" states.
"D.-id" says that he is coming back
to Encina hall every time there is a
dance because he "enjoys watching
the hoys and girls trip the light fan
tastic and having watched them for so
many years doesn't want to lose out
on any of the latest steps and music.
Charles E. Worster, 7»> years of age,
jand nightwatchman at Encina hall for
the last nine years, will give up his
position at the end of this month to
retire from active duties. The Univer
sity has granted him a pension for
long and faithful service not only in
'his present, position but also for Sen
;ator Stanford and his family.
Worster has been a father to Encina
men ever since he took the position
I and there are hundreds of men both
■ in school and out who know him by
no other name than "Dad."
Since the transferring of all the
! upperclassmen to Toyon and Branner
"Dad" has had a bigger responsibility
than ever in taking care of the fresh
men. With a new influx of men into
the hall every year he has felt a loss
j because the boys whom he knew dur
ing their first year moved out, and he
has to start about the business of
becoming acquainted all over again.
Came From New York
Worster came to Palo Alto from Al
bany, New York, in 1809, bringing a
pair of coach horses from New York
which Senator Stanford had bought
from E. Lothrop, Stanford's brother
in-law. As "Dad" tells the story, he
hesitated very much to take the job
because he dreaded coming across
jthe isthmus which was at that time

very unhealthy because of the yellow
fever and poor sanitation. When being
told by Lothrop -that the transcointi
nental railroad had been completed he
finally consented to the transfer from
one master to another.
"Dad" took care of the Senator's
horses and drove his carriage for him
np to his death in 1893. lie continued
in the services of Mrs. Stanford, work
ing around the old Stanford home.
After the death of Mrs. Stanford he
worked around the Stanford tomb, tak
ing care of the flowers and lawn, and
finally in 1915 he took over the posi
tion of nightwatchman of Encina hall
which he has held up to this time.
