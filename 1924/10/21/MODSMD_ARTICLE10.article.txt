# FACTS ABOUT THE MAILS
## A 						SERIES OF ARTICLES DEALING WITH THE UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE No. 2. AIR MAIL IN 1822 
### Byron Williams 
True, there is a glaring contrast
between the stagecoach of 1822 as a i
means of carrying mail and the light- |
njng-like speed which is maintained
by the air mail planes of 1923, BUT — j
the thought and suggestion of trans- i
l»orting mail by air was actually made
as early as 1822. Nor was it a wild
flight of imagination by our ancestors. j
Public interest in the speedy dis- j
patch of mails was very intense in
those days, and the postal authorities
were often in receipt of some sugges- ■
tion or plan whereby the mail service !
could be improved. (Mrs. Thomas, act- {
ing postmaster at the Stanford post
oflice, says that even a hundred years J
later suggestions for improvement art!
welcomed.)
Advise "Flying Ships" for Mail
The wise bird this time happened to
be the editor of the Freeman's Jour
nal, published in 1822 at Norristown.
I*B., who advised the Postmaster Gen- j
era) that it might be a good idea to
send mail by means of "flying ships." I
This is what he wrote:
"We would advise the Postmaster

General to avail himself of the novel
and very ingenious flying machine in
vented by James Bennett, of Phila
delphia, by which we conceive the
mails would be transported with more
celerity and their arrival at the places
of destination be much more certain
than is the case at the present."
Advice Not Followed
It is evident that McLean, the Post
master General at that time, decided
that he would not do as the editor in
dicated, but the editor was neverthe
less astonishingly prophetic of the fu
ture. If he could only come back today,
he would actually see mail being
transported by airplanes "with more
celerity" and with "arrival at their
places of destination much more cer
tain."
"There is an interesting illustration
in this connection." said Mrs. Thomas.
"In the haste of the first day's opera
tion of the stagecoach loaded with
mail one man was killed, while the
mails last year were carried 2,000,000
miles without a single fatality."
