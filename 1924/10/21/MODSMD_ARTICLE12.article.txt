# FALL DRIVE STARTS MONDAY-STUDENTS ARE ASKED TO GIVE
## Campus Has Responsibility Toward Others, Opinion Of Fairclough 
### 
"Educate the campus public in its
responsibility for doing something for
others," said Professor Henry Fair
clough, chairman of the committee in
charge of the autumn charity drive,
which will start Monday.
The committee headed by Fair
clough, who haa charge of the Greek
Relief, is composed of Mrs. Burt
Estes Howard, of the Russian Relief,
and Secretary F. E. Morgan, of the
Stanford Y. M. C. A. and the Stanford
in China Movement.
"As a result of the Smyrna disas
ter," explained Fairclough, "one mil
lion and a half Christians have been
driven from their homes in Asia Minor
by the Turks. They have fled to Greece
—hungry, naked, destitute —a terrific
burden upon a nation of less than five
million people.
"Hundreds of thousands have al
ready died," he continued. "Of the
survivors, at least half a million, most
ly women and children, need our aid,
especially at the approach of winter."
Money Needed
Money is urgently needed for emer
gency relief, which consists of food,
clothing, medicine. Funds are needed
also for constructive relief: the estab
lishing of workshops in Greece, for the
encouragement of native handicrafts,
the products of which will be sold in
the United States.
"The building up of good will be
tween China and America appeals to
every student on the Stanford cam
pus," remarked Morgan, in explaining
the drive for Stanford in China. "China
is struggling to her feet. She is sure
to have a great future although this
future greatness may not be attained
for many decades.
"Practically all American colleges
have some foreign project they sup
port." he continued. "Four years ago I
E. H. Lockwood, student secretary of
the Y. M. C. A., '13, '14, resigned, and
went to China. We made our contri
butions to him through the Lockwood
campaign, which was held annually
for five years.
"The death of his wile made it ne
cessary for him to leave China, and
Tracey K. Jones took his place," he
remarked, "What we give now goes
to him, and the drive is called the
Stanford in China instead of the Lock
wood campaign."
"Seven thousand Russian refugees
are dying in Constantinople," stated
Ml*. Howard. "These people are al
most wholly of the educated classes
of old Russia, and are unable to find
work, only because Turkey has rigidly
forbidden the employment of non-Mos- !
lems.
"France is willing to give them work i
if they can reach her shores," she ex- j
plained. "The League of Nations sets ,
up the machinery for securing labor, i
and permits for them to enter France, I
but it cannot furnish the money to |
pay for the actual transportation."
