# Y. W. C. A. WILL AWARD TRIP TO ASILOMAR AT BANQUET
## 
### 
Plans for the Stanford Asilomar
house-party, November 1 and 2. will
be discussed at the all-University wo
men's banquet in the Union at 6
o'clock tonight.
The holder of the lucky number at
the banquet will win a free trip to the
house-party. Transportation to Asilo
mar is to be in automobiles, if pos
sible, and the cost of the entire trip,
aside from transportation, will be but
$2, according to Miriam Ebright,
chairman of the committee in charge
of the house-party.
For fourteen years Asilomar has
been the student conference ground
for Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada.
Utah, and California. Miss Alice Hoyt,
who is the main speaker at the ban
quet, is Western division secretary of
the National Y. W. C. A., and has
had much experience with the Asilo
mar conferences.
"The house-party," stated Anna
Fitzhugh, president of the Y. W. C.
A., "is mainly to further the women's
sponsor system, as a means of creat
ing friendships of Stanford women."
The freshman class is in charge of
the banquet decorations, which will
carry out the idea of Asilomar.
