A drive was launched yesterday by
the Rally committee to organize spe
cial trains to carry a large percentage
of the Stanford student body to the
game with U. S. C. on November 8.
The Rally committee is introducing
Southern Pacific ticket agents to all
the living groups on the campus, and
the agents are selling accommodations
on the special Redshirt trains which
will leave here Friday, November 7,
for Los Angeles.
The drive for ticket-buyers will be
over by Friday. Les Peter, chairman
of the committee, wishes to impress
upon all who intend making the trip,
that reservations should be made be
fore the end of the week. It is ne
cessary to know by that date how
many cars will be needed, both on the
train and in Los Angeles, where
alumni are providing automobiles to
transport the wearers of the Red
through the streets in an immense
parade.
Pools Formed
Pools will be started tomorrow on
the Quad by the committee to send
several persons to Los Angeles for
25 cents each. For every 140 chances
that are purchased at a quarter each,
a pool will be formed, and drawings
made. The winner of the draw will get
the entire sum in the pot which will
be sufficient for railroad fare and
berth. Last year two men were sent
to Oregon by virtue of winning two
10-cent pools, and with 25-cent pools
being conducted tomorrow, and with
less money needed for each trip, it is
expected that about six or eight per
sons will win trips.
