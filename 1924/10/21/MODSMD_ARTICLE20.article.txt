# Points! Points! Points!

(Editors Aote: From time to tunc it so happens that a college jour
nalist reaches his typewriter across the continent and hits a campus nail on
the head with more accuracy than could haz'c been commanded by persons
right on the spot. When that happens, it is advisable to run that happy;
editorial, thereby proving that collegiate problems are much the same
wherever. It is to the Columbia "Spectator" that the "Daily" makes its
first acknowledgment of this sort.)
Personally we are quite certain that we should have gone mad long ago
and should now be assisting the Mad Hatter to stuff the Doormouse into
the tea pot, if we had retained anything of one or two courses to which we
have been exposed. But as it is, a poor memory has come to our rescue
and has left only a stark record of points and marks in the registrar's
office.
It was upon looking over his record at graduation, Thoreau tells us,
that he first realized that he had taken a course in navigation. That is
precisely our case as to these one or two courses (though surely not with
respect to navigation). -No one however is so silly as to deny that in some
cases it is well that all we receive from a course is the recorded credit.
].»ut this deliberate cultivation of forgetfulness, while in rare instances a
merciful anodyne, if consistently carried out. will result in a very queer
state of affairs. One would then receive a diploma but not an education.
Now in our unquiet quest for something to deprecate in this column, it
has come to our attention that many of our fellows are animated almost
exclusively by a passion for points and marks. Courses are endured with
one end in view—to get a passing mark, and once the exam is over, to let
the subject trickle out at the other ear. Snap courses are the favored tipple
of the point-collector. A passing mark is as incense to his nostrils. A
diploma is regarded merely as a commercial asset and not as a record of
cultural progress. Scented tapers burn to Mammon and the benighted
muses are made to execute a lock step in his train. If a residue of culture
remains it is quite by accident.
I he scramble after points obscures the greatest good which college af
fords—the formation of a capacity to enrich one's leisure. Culture is not
to be hired ; one must coax it lovingly.
That the worship of points is pretty prevalent in Columbia is certain.

"DAD" WORSTER has been here since 1869. An editorial written!
by him on the progress and development of Stanford University would be
an inspiring saga of evolution.
