# THE
						LAW STEPS

### 
V. G. D.

"It is a large world and a round
world; men grow human by seeing all
its play of force and folly." And the
closer one comes in contact with
"force and folly," whether it be an
interview with President Wilbur or
the discovery that one you thought a
fine man is in reality a cad with
water-front ideals, the more you will
learn about Man: ludicrous, egomani
acal, lovable Man.
Yesterday a woman, obviously not
belonging to the University, walked
down the Law steps. The group of
men draped about neither clapped
their hands nor proclaimed the fact
vocally.
That same evening at Roble Hall
women sat out a miserable "recep
tion" because "most of the men
seemed unaware of the reason for
which they were invited."
It is a queer chivalry which works
mornings and afternoons only.
Last night's "Daily" editorial asks
"Why is it so many college men and
women go about constantly striving
to conform to a pattern?" Why? . . .
because most college men and women
are still in the stage which doesn't
know what it wants, or even what it
can do; and rather than be called
"dumb" they frantically busy them
selves aping something or other, until
they feel the "urge from within" which
catapaults them into Journalism, or
Law, or Love, or all three. It is then
that that elusive "personality" begins
to creep forth . . . and the real fun
begins.
