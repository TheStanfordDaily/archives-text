### 
Irmagarde Richards, Stanford '02,
enjoys the distinction of being the
only official goat-buyer for any govern
ment in the world. Miss Richards has
been interested in goats for a long
time, even while she was the head of
I the Greek and Latin department at
-Mills College, and owns a ranch in San
Mateo county where she breeds pedi
greed Swiss goats.
In the fall of 1922 the Argentine
government appropriated $10,000 to
purchase herds of goats from Cali
fornia. Miss Richards received her ap
pointment through the Argentine con
sul in San Francisco and the Depart
ment of Animal Husbandry of the Uni
versity of California, who said she
knew more about goats than anyone
else in California.
She secured the finest stock in the
country, supervised every step of the
plans for shipping, and went down on
the same steamer to superintend the
milking and feeding of the goats, and
to watch over their general condition,
so that none would be lost on the way
down.
Miss Richards has only recently re
turned from South America. She has
â€¢making a great success. She is also
now definitely given up academic hon
ors to settle down on her ranch and
breed fancy cattle at which she is
the author of a textbook on* the rais
ing of goats.
