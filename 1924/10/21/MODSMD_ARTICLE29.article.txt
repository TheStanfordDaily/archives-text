# SOPHOMORES BOAST STRONG GRID TEAM
## 
### 
With eight veterans of the 1923 in
terclass championship team in their
line-up, the sophomore eleven is ex
pected to put in a strong bid for the
class football championship in the
series starting Saturday.
Seraphim Post, star linesman on
last year's freshman aggregation, is
coaching the 1927 squad of twenty-five
men. He boasts a fairly heavy line
and a fast and experienced backtield.
Since his charges have had but one
week's practice, Post has not yet set
tled on a definite first-string selection.
Two squads have been formed for
daily scrimmages, and a few plays
which promise to gain considerable
yardage have been mastered. Post is
working on one or two trick forma
tions at present and expects to de
velop smoothness by Saturday.
Rehm at full is a veteran who has
shown power as an open field runner,
but Bering is giving him a fight.
Schwartz is a third candidate. Mac-
Oougall is a last year's quarter who
has been calling signals with the "A"
squad during the last few days, and
doing most of the punting. Miller is
also making himself heard from.
Rhine, Weber, and Crimmins is a trio
of halves about on a par, with the
shade going to the first-named man
because of his experience.
Williams is a veteran center, with
Mack in reserve. Johnson and Greene
are a beefy pair of guards, but Cor
nelison and Chaffee are pressing them
hard. At tackle Walker and Davis
stand out, with Moser and Bennett
ready to fill the gap.
The wing positions are well taken
care of by Arnstein and Sproul, a cou
ple of seasoned players, and are per
haps the strongest spots on the team.
