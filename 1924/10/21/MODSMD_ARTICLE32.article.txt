# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT
## 
### 
To the Editor:
Criticism of the action taken in de
ciding upon rail transportation to the
U. S. C.-Stanford game has not been
accorded the Rally Committee except
by persons who are closely connected
with those economically interested in
water transportation. However, I am
glad to have the opportunity to set
forth a lew facts regarding the trip.
At the outset it is well to know that
no member of the Rally committee,
Graduate Manager's office, or alumni
is receiving any consideration from
railroad companies or company be
cause he has thrown his opinion in
this direction. Furthermore this deci
sion was reached in a fair-minded way
—a fact apparently not clearly under
stood.
For the express purpose of decid
ing upon plans for the U. S. C. game,
a meeting of the Rally committee was
called on October 7. After determin
ing that Stanford students would un
doubtedly prefer to travel as a body,
that simultaneous arrival was essen
tial, and that alumni members were
reluctant to spare more time from
their business than was absolutely es
sential, it remained to choose a single
method of transportation which would
fit the purse, convenience, and aim of
these students involved.
In anticipation of this question re
presentatives of both the Los Angeles
Steamship Company and the Southern
Pacific Railway Company were in
vited and were in attendance at this
meeting. These representatives were
called upon, as are salesmen before a
directors' meeting, to present their
views and selling points. A discussion
was followed by advice from the
Graduate Manager. In the ensuing
vote, the rail transportation was fa
vored by a two-thirds vote. Why? Be
cause:
1. No guarantee as to the number
that intended to make the trip was re
quired by the S. P.
2. The additional expense of rail
over water depended on the individual.
The train fare being $21.50 as against
$22.50 for water plus transportation to
San Francisco, could be supplemented
by either chair car, tourist, or stand
ard sleeping accommodations. In other
words the trip is only slightly more ex
! pensive for those who desire to save
money.
3. Students leaving Palo Alto by
train Friday night at 9 o'clock arrive
at the same time as the boat passen
gers that leave San Francisco about
4 o'clock in the afternoon.
4. The alumni can not spare Friday
afternoon in addition to Saturday.
5. The return trip to Palo Alto can
be made either Saturday or Sunday
night. Boat sailings are on Saturday
night or Tuesday night.
6. Owing to the limited number of
Stanford women, the proposed party
on the water would not have as much
attraction as might be supposed at
first thought.
7. Neither Friday nor Monday being
school holidays, it is obvious that
train service would interfere the least
with class work.
Does the thorough consideration,
and subsequent decision on fair basis,
of the Rally committee deserve such
criticism as was voiced in yesterday's
Daily? The casual observer might be
led to believe that there were dishon
est motives involved in the Rally com
mittee's decision.
You may "get on tli eboat" by travel
ing by rail. —L. H. P., Rally Committee.
Editor, Sir:
1 have just finished reading "A Sen
ior's" remarks in tonight's "Daily"
about the Itoble reception, and I am
quite infuriated. I think that his scath
ing remarks about the hostesses are
impudent., untrue, uncalled for, and
show lack of observation of what really
happened.
I think that the hostesses did not
shirk their responsibility but on the
contrary did their best to see that
each girl was introduced to some one.
If it is true that a very few of the
girls were introduced to no one, this
is not the fault of the hostesses but
of the men. The men absolutely re
fused to be introduced to many of the
girls but told the hostesses that they
"had this dance," or "preferred to cut
in." One went so far as to state in
pathetic tones that he was a. cripple,
when it was perfectly obvious that he
was at least a cross country runner,
and probably a varsity track man.
Many of the men were disgustingly
rude. How can you blame the host
esses for not introducing people when
the men refused to be introduced?
As for the suggestion offered by "A
Senior" that we invite some of the
new men, may I inform him—that at
least three-fourths of the men invited
were new men. The old men who
came were either invited at the re
quest of some particular girl or else
they "crashed the gates."
The dance Saturday night might
conceivably have been more auspicious,
I admit. But I think that the remedy
is to be bought in the improvement
in the manners of the Stanford man.

Editor, Sir:
1 have just finished reading "A Sen
ior's" remarks in tonight's "Daily"
about the Itoble reception, and I am
quite infuriated. I think that his scath
ing remarks about the hostesses are
impudent., untrue, uncalled for, and
show lack of observation of what really
happened.
I think that the hostesses did not
shirk their responsibility but on the
contrary did their best to see that
each girl was introduced to some one.
If it is true that a very few of the
girls were introduced to no one, this
is not the fault of the hostesses but
of the men. The men absolutely re
fused to be introduced to many of the
girls but told the hostesses that they
"had this dance," or "preferred to cut
in." One went so far as to state in
pathetic tones that he was a. cripple,
when it was perfectly obvious that he
was at least a cross country runner,
and probably a varsity track man.
Many of the men were disgustingly
rude. How can you blame the host
esses for not introducing people when
the men refused to be introduced?
As for the suggestion offered by "A
Senior" that we invite some of the
new men, may I inform him—that at
least three-fourths of the men invited
were new men. The old men who
came were either invited at the re
quest of some particular girl or else
they "crashed the gates."
The dance Saturday night might
conceivably have been more auspicious,
I admit. But I think that the remedy
is to be bought in the improvement
in the manners of the Stanford man.
Chairman of the Roble Reception.
To the Editor:
Criticism of the action taken in de
ciding upon rail transportation to the
U. S. C.-Stanford game has not been
accorded the Rally Committee except
by persons who are closely connected
with those economically interested in
water transportation. However, I am
glad to have the opportunity to set
forth a lew facts regarding the trip.
At the outset it is well to know that
no member of the Rally committee,
Graduate Manager's office, or alumni
is receiving any consideration from
railroad companies or company be
cause he has thrown his opinion in
this direction. Furthermore this deci
sion was reached in a fair-minded way
—a fact apparently not clearly under
stood.
For the express purpose of decid
ing upon plans for the U. S. C. game,
a meeting of the Rally committee was
called on October 7. After determin
ing that Stanford students would un
doubtedly prefer to travel as a body,
that simultaneous arrival was essen
tial, and that alumni members were
reluctant to spare more time from
their business than was absolutely es
sential, it remained to choose a single
method of transportation which would
fit the purse, convenience, and aim of
these students involved.
In anticipation of this question re
presentatives of both the Los Angeles
Steamship Company and the Southern
Pacific Railway Company were in
vited and were in attendance at this
meeting. These representatives were
called upon, as are salesmen before a
directors' meeting, to present their
views and selling points. A discussion
was followed by advice from the
Graduate Manager. In the ensuing
vote, the rail transportation was fa
vored by a two-thirds vote. Why? Be
cause:
1. No guarantee as to the number
that intended to make the trip was re
quired by the S. P.
2. The additional expense of rail
over water depended on the individual.
The train fare being $21.50 as against
$22.50 for water plus transportation to
San Francisco, could be supplemented
by either chair car, tourist, or stand
ard sleeping accommodations. In other
words the trip is only slightly more ex
! pensive for those who desire to save
money.
3. Students leaving Palo Alto by
train Friday night at 9 o'clock arrive
at the same time as the boat passen
gers that leave San Francisco about
4 o'clock in the afternoon.
4. The alumni can not spare Friday
afternoon in addition to Saturday.
5. The return trip to Palo Alto can
be made either Saturday or Sunday
night. Boat sailings are on Saturday

by persons who are closely connected
with those economically interested in
water transportation. However, I am
glad to have the opportunity to set
forth a lew facts regarding the trip.
At the outset it is well to know that
no member of the Rally committee,
Graduate Manager's office, or alumni
is receiving any consideration from
railroad companies or company be
cause he has thrown his opinion in
this direction. Furthermore this deci
sion was reached in a fair-minded way
—a fact apparently not clearly under
stood.
For the express purpose of decid
ing upon plans for the U. S. C. game,
a meeting of the Rally committee was
called on October 7. After determin
ing that Stanford students would un
doubtedly prefer to travel as a body,
that simultaneous arrival was essen
tial, and that alumni members were
reluctant to spare more time from
their business than was absolutely es
sential, it remained to choose a single
method of transportation which would
fit the purse, convenience, and aim of
these students involved.
In anticipation of this question re
presentatives of both the Los Angeles
Steamship Company and the Southern
Pacific Railway Company were in
vited and were in attendance at this
meeting. These representatives were
called upon, as are salesmen before a
directors' meeting, to present their
views and selling points. A discussion
was followed by advice from the
Graduate Manager. In the ensuing
vote, the rail transportation was fa
vored by a two-thirds vote. Why? Be
cause:
1. No guarantee as to the number
that intended to make the trip was re
quired by the S. P.
2. The additional expense of rail
over water depended on the individual.
The train fare being $21.50 as against
$22.50 for water plus transportation to
San Francisco, could be supplemented
by either chair car, tourist, or stand
ard sleeping accommodations. In other
words the trip is only slightly more ex
! pensive for those who desire to save
money.
3. Students leaving Palo Alto by
train Friday night at 9 o'clock arrive
at the same time as the boat passen
gers that leave San Francisco about
4 o'clock in the afternoon.
4. The alumni can not spare Friday
afternoon in addition to Saturday.
5. The return trip to Palo Alto can
be made either Saturday or Sunday
night. Boat sailings are on Saturday
night or Tuesday night.
6. Owing to the limited number of
Stanford women, the proposed party
on the water would not have as much
attraction as might be supposed at
first thought.
7. Neither Friday nor Monday being
school holidays, it is obvious that
train service would interfere the least
with class work.
Does the thorough consideration,
and subsequent decision on fair basis,
of the Rally committee deserve such
criticism as was voiced in yesterday's
Daily? The casual observer might be
led to believe that there were dishon
est motives involved in the Rally com
mittee's decision.
You may "get on tli eboat" by travel
ing by rail. —L. H. P., Rally Committee.
Editor, Sir:
1 have just finished reading "A Sen
ior's" remarks in tonight's "Daily"
about the Itoble reception, and I am
quite infuriated. I think that his scath
ing remarks about the hostesses are
impudent., untrue, uncalled for, and
show lack of observation of what really
happened.
I think that the hostesses did not
shirk their responsibility but on the
contrary did their best to see that
each girl was introduced to some one.
If it is true that a very few of the
girls were introduced to no one, this
is not the fault of the hostesses but
of the men. The men absolutely re
fused to be introduced to many of the
girls but told the hostesses that they
"had this dance," or "preferred to cut
in." One went so far as to state in
pathetic tones that he was a. cripple,
when it was perfectly obvious that he
was at least a cross country runner,
and probably a varsity track man.
Many of the men were disgustingly
rude. How can you blame the host
esses for not introducing people when
the men refused to be introduced?
As for the suggestion offered by "A
Senior" that we invite some of the
new men, may I inform him—that at
least three-fourths of the men invited
were new men. The old men who
came were either invited at the re
quest of some particular girl or else
they "crashed the gates."
The dance Saturday night might
conceivably have been more auspicious,
I admit. But I think that the remedy
is to be bought in the improvement
in the manners of the Stanford man.
Chairman of the Roble Reception.
