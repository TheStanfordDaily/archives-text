# Students Due For Studies Armistice Day; No Vacation
## 
### 
"Classes for November It, as usual,"
is the edict pronounced by Professor
Jtobinson, who is in charge ot' holidays
and assemblies.
Coming as it does, the U. S. C.
game on November 8 was certain to be
the cause of much "cutting" on Mon
day, November 10, PROVIDING Tues
day, which happens to be Armistice
Day, was declared a holiday. However,
this is not given as the cause for the
"no vacation" rule.
"There are so many holidays in
California, that if the universities
started to observe all of them, they
might just as well close up entirely,"
stated Professor Robinson. "The Uni
versity of California, if it lives up to
its agreement with us, will not recog
nize Armistice Day as a holiday.
"We place on our vacation calendar
just four or five days which are ob
served all over t"he country, besides
our own 'Founder's Day.' No doubt
we will hold some kind of exercises
on the eleventh, but as yet have no
plans to announce.
