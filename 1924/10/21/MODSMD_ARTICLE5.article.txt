# MARIONETTE PLAYS ON PROGRAM TONIGHT IN LITTLE THEATRE
## 'Doctor Faustus,' 'Bird Feng,' 'Singing Master,' Chosen For Presentation 
### 
"Doctor Faustus," "The Singing
Master," and "The Bird Feng" will be
included in the performance of Clarks'
Marionettes at 7:30 tonight in the
Little Theatre.
The guignol puppets, operated upon
the hands and fingers of the "puppet
eer." are one of the features of the en
tertainment. Being in such intimate
contact with the performers, G. Fletch
er Clark and Celia Rantz Clark, the
"guignol" is not mechanical.
By virtue of its grotesqueness it is
also eminently fitted to satirize the
fads and foibles of human action, as
is seen in the "The Singing Master,"
an episode of the comedy of manners
type.
The play is translated from the
French, and is still used by the show
men of Paris. The other plays are the
modernized comedy version of "Doc
tor Faustus," which introduces many
novel elements into the old story, and
"The Bird Feng," a romance adapted
from an Oriental fairy-tale.
Clarks' puppets tend to be non
representative, and to emphasize the
element of design both in carving and
coloring. Clark carves the heads of his
miniature actors from mahogany and
other hard woods, after which they are
painted and costumed by Mrs. Clark.
Originating in ancient Egypt, the
marionette art was passed on by
Greece and Rome to modern Italy.
From Italy the art spread to every
European country, taking on a char
acteristic form of development in each.
It ws in France that the "guignol"
puppet became popular.
In America the art developed but
recently. It has, however, now defi
nitely passed the experimental stage.
