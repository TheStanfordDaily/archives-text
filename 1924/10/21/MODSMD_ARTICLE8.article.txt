# VARSITY LEAVES TOMORROW FOR CONTEST WITH VANDALS
## Cardinal Freshmen Battle Trojan Yearlings In First Real Test Of Season Here Saturday 
### Douglas Meservey Donald Irving 
Lesa confidence. This is the essen
tial Coach "Husky" Hunt is attempt
ing to impress upon his freshman
eleven this week. Leas confidence and
more knowledge of what to do in
crises.
When taking the edge off their
"cock-sureness," "Husky" points to the
first quarter of the Santa Clara game,
when the Broncs seriously threatened
the Card territory and goal. It wasn't
so much a better offensive, according
to Hunt, that did the work, but sur
prise on the part of the Cards that
they could meet such opposition.
It is for another probable surprise
that he is priming his proteges for the
U. S. C. battle Saturday. Coach Chet
Dolley of the Trojan babes is coming
north with an aggregation replete with
former high school stars and hoping
to repeat the Trojan victory of last
year.
To offset Dolley's hope and send it
skyward, on the other hand, Hunt be
gan work the first of the season with
a wealth of reserve material. Out of
this he haa developed several com
binations for a backfield and a heavy,
but fast line.
This reserve material he will need
in a hard battle. It is on his backfield's
ability to run, pass, and kick, however,
that at least fifty per cent of the out
come will depend. To the line goes the
rest of the brunt of the struggle.
In his backfield, "Husky" saw a few
weaknesses Saturday against Santa
Clara. While they are not large, he is
attempting to iron them out this week
—especially in the kicking department.
The line underwent several changes
beginning the Bronco game, but it will
enter the U. S. C. scrap essentially the
same as in previous contests. As a unit
it performed quite adequately Satur
day. It was strengthened by the addi
tion of Dennis at end, who has been
handicapped most of the season with
an injured ankle.
Millage at full had a hard time start
ing his effective line plunges but once
he did, he looked as good as ever.
His kicking, however, helps to make
him the favorite for that position, and
with practice this week he should send
the ball for a forty- to fifty-yard aver
age by Saturday.

Stanford University's fast-improving
football team will leave tomorrow af
ternoon for Portland, Oregon, where
they will encounter the Idaho varsity
in their first contest of the season
away from home.
The team will leave Palo Alto at
5:10 p.m., and after dinner at the
"States" in San Francisco, will board
the Shasta Limited which leaves Oak
land Pier at 8 p.m. The squad is
scheduled to arrive in Portland at
10:30 p.m., Thursday, and will be quar
tered at the Multnomah Hotel. The
team will return on the Oregonian,
which leaves Portland at 1 a.m., Sun
day, and rrives in San Francisco at
9:10 a.m., Monday.
Cardinal supporters are in higher
spirits after the showing of the varsity
against Oregon last Saturday. The
team demonstrated that it had the of
fensive strength that it was claimed
to have at the first of the season. In
the two previous games it gained
a large number of yards from scrim
mage, but were unable to pile up large
scores against their opponents.
Cleaveland was getting his punts off
consistently last Saturday, and came
out ahead on almost all exchanges
with Oregon's hooters, Anderson and
Jones.
Both Bogue and Hey went great at
fullback, and will probably get plenty
of opportunities to play this year.
Bogue's run of 85 yards for a touch
down showed that he has plenty ot
speed. Garthwaite broke loose for a
neat gain when he was allowed to
carry the ball. He makes up in speed
and footwork what he lacks in weight.
Stanford will have no easy time in
downing Idaho. Last year, when the
Vandals held the Cards to a 17-0 score,
their passing game kept the Stanford
goal line in.danger a large part of the
time, and they will probably employ
the same tactics this year. Last Friday
they demonstrated their fight when,
with the score 3 to 0 against them,
they ran up three touchdowns and beat
Washington State 19 to 3.

beginning the Bronco game, but it will
enter the U. S. C. scrap essentially the
same as in previous contests. As a unit
it performed quite adequately Satur
day. It was strengthened by the addi
tion of Dennis at end, who has been
handicapped most of the season with
an injured ankle.
Millage at full had a hard time start
ing his effective line plunges but once
he did, he looked as good as ever.
His kicking, however, helps to make
him the favorite for that position, and
with practice this week he should send
the ball for a forty- to fifty-yard aver
age by Saturday.

Stanford University's fast-improving
football team will leave tomorrow af
ternoon for Portland, Oregon, where
they will encounter the Idaho varsity
in their first contest of the season
away from home.
The team will leave Palo Alto at
5:10 p.m., and after dinner at the
"States" in San Francisco, will board
the Shasta Limited which leaves Oak
land Pier at 8 p.m. The squad is
scheduled to arrive in Portland at
10:30 p.m., Thursday, and will be quar
tered at the Multnomah Hotel. The
team will return on the Oregonian,
which leaves Portland at 1 a.m., Sun
day, and rrives in San Francisco at
9:10 a.m., Monday.
Cardinal supporters are in higher
spirits after the showing of the varsity
against Oregon last Saturday. The
team demonstrated that it had the of
fensive strength that it was claimed
to have at the first of the season. In
the two previous games it gained
a large number of yards from scrim
mage, but were unable to pile up large
scores against their opponents.
Cleaveland was getting his punts off
consistently last Saturday, and came
out ahead on almost all exchanges
with Oregon's hooters, Anderson and
Jones.
Both Bogue and Hey went great at
fullback, and will probably get plenty
of opportunities to play this year.
Bogue's run of 85 yards for a touch
down showed that he has plenty ot
speed. Garthwaite broke loose for a
neat gain when he was allowed to
carry the ball. He makes up in speed
and footwork what he lacks in weight.
Stanford will have no easy time in
downing Idaho. Last year, when the
Vandals held the Cards to a 17-0 score,
their passing game kept the Stanford
goal line in.danger a large part of the
time, and they will probably employ
the same tactics this year. Last Friday
they demonstrated their fight when,
with the score 3 to 0 against them,
they ran up three touchdowns and beat
Washington State 19 to 3.
Lesa confidence. This is the essen
tial Coach "Husky" Hunt is attempt
ing to impress upon his freshman
eleven this week. Leas confidence and
more knowledge of what to do in
crises.
When taking the edge off their
"cock-sureness," "Husky" points to the
first quarter of the Santa Clara game,
when the Broncs seriously threatened
the Card territory and goal. It wasn't
so much a better offensive, according
to Hunt, that did the work, but sur
prise on the part of the Cards that
they could meet such opposition.
It is for another probable surprise
that he is priming his proteges for the
U. S. C. battle Saturday. Coach Chet
Dolley of the Trojan babes is coming
north with an aggregation replete with
former high school stars and hoping
to repeat the Trojan victory of last
year.
To offset Dolley's hope and send it
skyward, on the other hand, Hunt be
gan work the first of the season with
a wealth of reserve material. Out of
this he haa developed several com
binations for a backfield and a heavy,
but fast line.
This reserve material he will need
in a hard battle. It is on his backfield's
ability to run, pass, and kick, however,
that at least fifty per cent of the out
come will depend. To the line goes the
rest of the brunt of the struggle.
In his backfield, "Husky" saw a few
weaknesses Saturday against Santa
Clara. While they are not large, he is
attempting to iron them out this week
—especially in the kicking department.

Cleaveland was getting his punts off
consistently last Saturday, and came
out ahead on almost all exchanges
with Oregon's hooters, Anderson and
Jones.
Both Bogue and Hey went great at
fullback, and will probably get plenty
of opportunities to play this year.
Bogue's run of 85 yards for a touch
down showed that he has plenty ot
speed. Garthwaite broke loose for a
neat gain when he was allowed to
carry the ball. He makes up in speed
and footwork what he lacks in weight.
Stanford will have no easy time in
downing Idaho. Last year, when the
Vandals held the Cards to a 17-0 score,
their passing game kept the Stanford
goal line in.danger a large part of the
time, and they will probably employ
the same tactics this year. Last Friday
they demonstrated their fight when,
with the score 3 to 0 against them,
they ran up three touchdowns and beat
Washington State 19 to 3.
Lesa confidence. This is the essen
tial Coach "Husky" Hunt is attempt
ing to impress upon his freshman
eleven this week. Leas confidence and
more knowledge of what to do in
crises.
When taking the edge off their
"cock-sureness," "Husky" points to the
first quarter of the Santa Clara game,
when the Broncs seriously threatened
the Card territory and goal. It wasn't
so much a better offensive, according
to Hunt, that did the work, but sur
prise on the part of the Cards that
they could meet such opposition.
It is for another probable surprise
that he is priming his proteges for the
U. S. C. battle Saturday. Coach Chet
Dolley of the Trojan babes is coming
north with an aggregation replete with
former high school stars and hoping
to repeat the Trojan victory of last
year.
To offset Dolley's hope and send it
skyward, on the other hand, Hunt be
gan work the first of the season with
a wealth of reserve material. Out of
this he haa developed several com
binations for a backfield and a heavy,
but fast line.
This reserve material he will need
in a hard battle. It is on his backfield's
ability to run, pass, and kick, however,
that at least fifty per cent of the out
come will depend. To the line goes the
rest of the brunt of the struggle.
In his backfield, "Husky" saw a few
weaknesses Saturday against Santa
Clara. While they are not large, he is
attempting to iron them out this week
—especially in the kicking department.
The line underwent several changes
beginning the Bronco game, but it will
enter the U. S. C. scrap essentially the
same as in previous contests. As a unit
it performed quite adequately Satur
day. It was strengthened by the addi
tion of Dennis at end, who has been
handicapped most of the season with
an injured ankle.
Millage at full had a hard time start
ing his effective line plunges but once
he did, he looked as good as ever.
His kicking, however, helps to make
him the favorite for that position, and
with practice this week he should send
the ball for a forty- to fifty-yard aver
age by Saturday.

Cardinal supporters are in higher
spirits after the showing of the varsity
against Oregon last Saturday. The
team demonstrated that it had the of
fensive strength that it was claimed
to have at the first of the season. In
the two previous games it gained
a large number of yards from scrim
mage, but were unable to pile up large
scores against their opponents.
