# Weekly "Unusual" Dance Will Be Held on Friday
## 
### 
Seniors are going to "do their stuff*
next Friday night, at which time they
invite the campus as a whole to frolic
with them at the Basketball pavilion.
The means of identification will be
$1.10, which is to be presented at the
door. As is usual with all-university
dances, the sponsors of the affair
promise something elaborate and dif
ferent in the decorations and lighting
effects â€”look for it, is all they ask.
"Lock-outs" for the occasion are
scheduled for 1:31, and after.
