# EVA GAUTHIER IS FIRST ATTRACTION OF P. M. A. SEASON
## 
### 
Eva Gauthler, known as the "high !
j priestess of modern song," will ap
pear in a recital in the Assembly hall |
| on December 11, as the first attraction
offered by the Peninsula Musical Asso
: elation.
Miss Gauthier was the first to in
troduce modern "jazz" into the atmos
phere of the concert hall. However,
her programs do not consist entirely
of this type of music. She presents
groups of ancient and modern songs
from various countries in national
idioms, one of which is American rag-
I time.
The singer, who is a French-Cana
dian mezzo-soprano, has, according
to critics, a rich voice, suited to a wide
range of emotional demands, from
i Beethoven, through the field of mod
; ern French, Italian, and Russian vocal
! music, to the mysterious folk music
j of the Orient, of which she has made
a special study.
i Miss Gauthier is the first singer to
i • •
be chosen to interpret American songs
| at the famous Salzburg Festival. "Au
j Claire de la Lune," "Chanson Triste,"
, and "La Chere Maison" are three of
I the many well-known French songs
I which she has sung for Victor records.
