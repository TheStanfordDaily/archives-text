# DEAN YOST URGES REORGANIZATION OF STUDENT ACTIVITY
## Dean Culver, Comptroller Roth Explain Functions In Assembly 
### 
With an appeal for the organization
of student activities, Dean Yost, in the
University assembly this morning, sug
gested that the Executive Committee
appoint a committee for the purpose
of surveying clear-mindedly the field
of student activities.
Dean George Culver enumerated sev
eral functions in his official capacity,
and Comptroller A. K. Roth told of the
enormous businss organization neces
sary to run the University.
Miss Yost made her suggestion this
morning after having fully questioned
whether activities as they are now
conducted, really offer as much pleas
ure and training to the student, as
they possibly could.
Do Activities Meet Need?
In admitting their recreational and
training values, she asked whether
they meet a real need of the Univer
sity, and whether they cultivate valu
able habits of thinking and acting.
Miss Yost asked, "Are these activi
ties kept alive year alter year, be
cause no one has the initiative to stop
them? Are several doing the same
thing? Are they interfering with
others? Are we diminishing our intiti
ative by carrying a load from the
past? Are the same people in all of
them, or do we find representation
shared by many?"
The plan Miss Yost brought forth
was for the co-ordination of activities
so that student life might be freed.
Culver Tells of Work
There were two activities which
Dean Culver condemned. The first was
gambling, and the other, writing
worthless checks. In telling of his five
personalities in his official capacity,
he commented on the part of hotel
clerk, in arranging the housing ques
tions for the men; his part as preacher
in telling men his vision of life; the
part of banker in jwssing on tuition
notes; of physician in approving leave
of absence candidates; and of police
man, in taking up conduct not in the
realm of action by the Men's Council.
He commended the fine attitude of
men earning their way through col
lege.
"The tuition a student pays at Stan
lord is only 30 per cent of the cost of
his education here," was the fact
stated by Comptroller A. E. Roth as he
explained the various departments
connected with the business organiza
tion of the University. He said, "Uni
versities have grown so during the
last few years, that they are now
looked upon as business organiza
tions."
Stanford is run according to the
budget system. Of this budget, large
items are heating, which is not as
great as in eastern universities, and
upkeep of the grounds.
Roth told of the addition of an as
sistant to take charge of grounds and
buildings so that the comptroller's of
i fice does not have to handle the mat
i ters of this kind directly.
