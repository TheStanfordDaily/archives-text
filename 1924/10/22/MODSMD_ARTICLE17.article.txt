"Viewpoints" appearing in the "Daily"' on the first two days of this
week have dealt adequately with a student problem which appears not
so serious as was at first feared. The tempest which was almost stirred
up over Stanford's movement south by special train seems to be well
confined in a very small and rather contemptible tea-pot.
Cold logic ami irrefutable facts showed plainly that the railroad was
best fitted, from every angle, to carry students and alumni to the U. S. C.
game, and deliver them simultaneously and in good condition. Gestures
to the contrary were expected—naturally every one could not be pleased
—and though the gestures have been made, they have been feeble. It is
difficult to summon language sufficiently scorching to apply to anybody
who would, for purely acquisitive reasons, throw a monkey-wrench in
the wheels of an all-Stanford affair. Also it is most gratifying that no
•campaign is being made along lines apart from the accepted program.
