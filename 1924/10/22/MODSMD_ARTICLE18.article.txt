After the most encouraging tryout period in the history of the present
journalistic generation, eighteen new names are today added to the mast
head of the "Daily. These people were picked from a field of eighty
seven and slugged their way into our midst on the strength of what they
already could do, as the impressive number of tryoutees precluded any
possibility of the customary class-room in journalism.
One junior was considered worthy to survive the handicap of a late
start, nine sophomores will have ample time to make good on the sheet,
and eight freshmen showed enough merit to be taken as the journalistic
nucleus of their class.
Reasons for the disqualification of the other sixty-nine were various.
Some fulfilled almost every requirement, but were too many years ad
vanced in standing to have any opportunity for advancement
on the paper. Others failed to show the necessary vigor and accuracy,
while still others turned in plenty of work but simply failed to reach a
sufficiently high standard.
Underclassmen, especially freshmen, who were unsuccessful in this
first test, will find their chances much improved in a subsequent editorial
tryout. '1 he "Daily" takes on new members at the first of every quarter,
and one trip through the mill will greatly increase the probability of
enjoying better luck next time. All records of the past tryout will be
preserved, and "repeaters" will be considered with especial care.
I he "Daily" congratulates the following men and women upon their
tryoutee copy and its result:
I\ W. Mosher, Jr., F. W. Speers, L. B. Lundborg, A. M. Espinosa, Jr.,
If. A. Klein, Rhoda Lewis, D. T. Ross, Frances Dearborn, Barbara
Probasco, G. Hall, E. A. White, S. H. Smith, Jr., Fay Harrison, W. F.
Adams, K. A. Dow, C. H. Moore, Hallie Keating, and Astrid Arnoldson.
EDITORIAL STAFF, both old and new members, will meet tomor
row at one o'clock sharp. We are trying to think of some way to make
the absentees suffer.
