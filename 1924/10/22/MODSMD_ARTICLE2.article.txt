# STANFORD SPEAKER IN COAST CONTEST WILL BE SELECTED
## 
### 
Try-outs for Stanford representative
in the Pacific Coast Extemporaneous
Speaking Contest will be held tomor
row at 4 p.m. in the Little Theatre.
The subject for the trial contest
will be the same as for the final meet:
The right of the Supreme Court to
declare acts of Congress unconstitu
tional. One hour before the tryouts a
sub-topic will be given the tryoutees
on which to talk. No speaker will be
allowed to listen to those who precede
him on the program. In the final con
test, which will be at Stanford, differ
ent subjects bearing on the main ques
tion will be allotted to the speakers.
The contest is under the auspices
of the Pacific Coast Public Speaking
League of which J. G. Emerson, Stan
ford faculty debate advisor, is presi
dent. This is not in the nature of a
debate. Speakers may take sides if
they wish, but emphasis is laid on
exposition, capacity to interest the
audience, and general appearance.
An innovation in judging contests is
to be tried in the preliminary contest
Thursday in that there will be a stu
dent judge who is not directly con
nected with the debate to alleviate
the objection that the academic style
is too much fostered. In tomorrow's
tryout the student will be W. L.
Wright, editor of the Daily Palo Alto.
Tryoutees are instructed to report
at the Little Theatre at 3 o'clock to
draw for place in the program and to
receive the specific topic on which
they will speak.
The Stanford representative for the
final contest and one alternate will be
picked. Tryoutees will be allowed five
minutes to speak.
