# Nothing
## 
### 
Nothing is an absorbing subject.
Many prominent people are intimate
ly acquainted with it, and so may be
said to know Nothing. When closely
questioned, they are extremely indefi
nite, and say that Nothing eludes
them. But the most extraordinary
thing about Nothing is that while some
people know Something, and others
know Nothing, no one can know Some
thing and Nothing at the same time.
â€”H. K.
