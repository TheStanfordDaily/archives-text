# The 						Philosophy of Football
## 
### (By Andy Schmidt 
The fundamental principle of foot
ball is to scare your opponent into
defeat. The moat effective way to do
this is to send an anonymous letter
to each player the night before the
game. The wordihg of the note may be
something like this: "If you show up
at the game tomorrow, I will kill you.
Beware." A letter like this should
bring results, and the contest the next
day will undoubtedly be a overwhelm
ing victory for your team.
* * *
Another very effective way to make
the opponents down-hearted is to ac
tually slip some poison into the cocoa
nut-cream pie that the team will be
eating for breakfast, the morning of
the match. Everything in winning a
football game is to have the other
eleven discouraged before the starting
whistle blows.
* * *
After starting to play it is a good
idea to challenge the man opposite
you to a fight as soon as the game is
over. But, in doing this, be sure that
you are knocked out, and carried off
the field before the final gun, because
the other man might go so far as to
take you seriously.
Remember, also, that it is an un
pardonable sin of the gridiron, to com
mit a foul when the referee is look
ing. This is a dangerous practice and
will often cause the loss of yards if
the official is not a graduate of your
university.
* * *
In the forward-passing game, the
man who is supposed to receive the
ball must always fall down after miss
ing the throw. He should rise slowly
and look meaningly at the nearest
opponent. He may also mutter that
dirty playing does not get by. He is
now forgiven by the crowd for missing
the pass, and the yell leader may even
give him three rousing cheers.
♦ * *
One final topic that should be
spoken of is, how to warm up before
being sent into the game. This sounds
quite trivial, but nevertheless, there
is an art in warming up. In running up
and down the field, be sure to run IN
FRONT of the coach's bench. Other
wise the coach may forget all about
you, and consequently you wear your
self out by running all afternoon.
Everyone has heard about one par
ticular mentor who left a substitute
warming up after the contest was
over. Sometime during the early hours
of the next morning he dropped, com
pletely exhausted. —W. F. A.

Many political arguments are to be
seen and heard on the campus as
election time draws nigher. But the
most poignant questions yet unan
swered are: Who is Mr. Davis going
to vote for? Who is Mr. LaFollette
going to vote for? Who is Mr. Coolidge
going to vote for? Until then, Cab
bages refuses to talk. —G. S.

take you seriously.
Remember, also, that it is an un
pardonable sin of the gridiron, to com
mit a foul when the referee is look
ing. This is a dangerous practice and
will often cause the loss of yards if
the official is not a graduate of your
university.

In the forward-passing game, the
man who is supposed to receive the
ball must always fall down after miss
ing the throw. He should rise slowly
and look meaningly at the nearest
opponent. He may also mutter that
dirty playing does not get by. He is
now forgiven by the crowd for missing
the pass, and the yell leader may even
give him three rousing cheers.

One final topic that should be
spoken of is, how to warm up before
being sent into the game. This sounds
quite trivial, but nevertheless, there
is an art in warming up. In running up
and down the field, be sure to run IN
FRONT of the coach's bench. Other
wise the coach may forget all about
you, and consequently you wear your
self out by running all afternoon.
Everyone has heard about one par
ticular mentor who left a substitute
warming up after the contest was
over. Sometime during the early hours
of the next morning he dropped, com
pletely exhausted. —W. F. A.

Many political arguments are to be
seen and heard on the campus as
election time draws nigher. But the
most poignant questions yet unan
swered are: Who is Mr. Davis going
to vote for? Who is Mr. LaFollette
going to vote for? Who is Mr. Coolidge
going to vote for? Until then, Cab
bages refuses to talk. —G. S.
The fundamental principle of foot
ball is to scare your opponent into
defeat. The moat effective way to do
this is to send an anonymous letter
to each player the night before the
game. The wordihg of the note may be
something like this: "If you show up
at the game tomorrow, I will kill you.
Beware." A letter like this should
bring results, and the contest the next
day will undoubtedly be a overwhelm
ing victory for your team.

Another very effective way to make
the opponents down-hearted is to ac
tually slip some poison into the cocoa
nut-cream pie that the team will be
eating for breakfast, the morning of
the match. Everything in winning a
football game is to have the other
eleven discouraged before the starting
whistle blows.

After starting to play it is a good
idea to challenge the man opposite
you to a fight as soon as the game is
over. But, in doing this, be sure that
you are knocked out, and carried off
the field before the final gun, because
the other man might go so far as to
take you seriously.
