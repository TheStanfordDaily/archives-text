An almost exact replica of fa
mous Washington elm of Cambridge is
growing on the University of Wash
ington campus. The Seattle elm was
slipped from the Cambridge elm by a
Washington student while he was do

Efforts will be made to force the Seat
tle elm to grow as much like the origi
nal as possible.
