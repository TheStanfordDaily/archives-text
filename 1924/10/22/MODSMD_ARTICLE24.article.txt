# ECONOMICS CLASS VISITS U. S. MINT TO STUDY PROCESS
## Students Spend 30 Minutes In Learning How to Make Real Money 
### Byron Williams 
Special permission was obtained by
Professor Wildman for his class in
Money, Economics 26, to visit the
United States mint at San Francisco
last Saturday morning. The mint is
closcd to visitors for an indefinite
period, so the 40 or 50 who made the
trip considered themselves amply re
paid.
There are three mints in operation
in the country, at Philadelphia, Denver
and San Francisco. The one at Phila
delphia is twice the size of the one at
San Francisco, while the one at Denver
is three-quarters as large.
Approximately $670,000,000 is in re
serve at the mint at the present time.
This amount is in the form of gold bul
lion and actual money. One-third of
the reserve must be in already-coined
gold; two-thirds can be in bars. It is
reserves such as this that the Federal
Reserve Notes depend upon for actual
value. Paper money, however, is not
printed here—Washington takes care
of that all by itself.
Coining Is Rapid.
When dollars are being made, 150,000
arc turned out every day. One can get
an adequate conception of this when he
considers the fact that each dollar is
I'A inches in diameter, and that if 150,-.
000 were placed side by side, they would
create a silver line 18,750 feet or
miles ki length. And that is but one
day's production.
The first place visited was the re
ceiving room. Here gold and silver
can be brought by anyone wishing to
part with it, and he will be. given
$20.07 an ounce for gold, or the market
price (71 cents an ounce Saturday)
lor silver. Almost all countries have
the gold standard, and for that reason
♦he price does not fluctuate; it is the
monetary unit of the world. Silver,
however, is merely an auxiliary metal,
the price of which varies daily.
Use Own Process
Gold and silver are refined by the
United States' o-.vn process, and 10
per cent copper is added to make the
coins harder. A bar of gold about the
size of an ordinary loaf of bread was
said to be worth $32,000. The same
size in silver is about $800.
Quarter dollars were being made
Saturday, at the rate of 250,000 a day.
The right proportions of silver and
copper are melted and poured into
molds about 12 inches long, 2 inches
wide, and Vz inch thick. These bars
are fed through large machines which
roll the silver into long strips until
they become the right thickness for
the particular coin being made. For
quarters they had to be run 32 times
through these rollers.
Hardness Reduced
These long strips are then run
through a machine which cuts the
quarters at the rate of 400 a minute.
The waste fs laid aside to be melted
aeain, and the cut coins are sent to a
solution which cleans the metal and
reduces the hardness from 65 to about
32 per cent. The pieces are softened
so that they can be stamped without
breaking or cracking. The residue left
after squeezing grapes forms part of
this solution, for it has been found to
be the best metal cleaner available.
T'he milling machine next claims the
attention of the pieces. This machine
raises the edges, which act as a pro
tection to the impression on the face
of the coin. They are next stamped by
30-ton pressure at the rate of 110 a
minute, counted, and then laid aside
to await the order from Washington
for their release. This usually does not
come until at least a year after the
clay they at*e made.
