# MARIONETTES PLAY IN UNIQUE VERSIONS OF ANCIENT DRAMAS
## 
### 
"Guignol" puppets, operated by
Celia Rantz Clark and G. Fletcher
Clark, were the actors in three plays
last night at the Little Theatre.
Clark explained the history of
marionettes since their origin in an
cient Egypt, and their part in modern
drama for educational purposes. The
performance was the first appearance
on the campus of the humorously gro
tesque "guignol" puppets, which are
operated upon the hands and fingers
of the "puppeteer."
"Singing Master" Satirical
The first play presented was "The
Singing Master," a satirical episode of
the comedy of manners type. Humor
similar to that seen in a Punch and
Judy show, with slaps, knocks, and
witty sayings, made up the plot of
the comedy.
"Doctor Faustus," a modernized
comedy version of the medieval
legend, introduced many original in
cidents and ideas. In this play the
features of Mephistophelean and other
evil spirits were distorted, and the
sudden appearances and disappear
ances of the genii surprised the audi
ence. In its happy ending this version
differed from the original, for Doctor
Faustus downed the combined forces
of evil and triumphed in the end.
"The Bird Feng" was an Oriental
romance of the Cinderella type, in
which the prince sets out to find his
dream princess before the clock
strikes twelve. He accomplishes this
only with the aid of the Bird Feng.
