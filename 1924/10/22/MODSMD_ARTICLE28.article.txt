# FOREIGN COLLECTIONS TO BE SHOWN IN ART GALLERY THIS YEAR
## 
### 
"The schedule of art exhibitions for
the coming year will be an exceptional
one," states Pedro Lemos, director of
the Art Gallery, "for during my trip
to Europe it was possible to arrange
for several collections from England,
France, and Italy."
At present the large gallery re
served for changing exhibits is occu
pied by a series of paintings selected
from the Thomas Welton collection
and the Loeser Print Collection. In
one of the smaller galleries are Eng
lish water color landscapes by J. E.
Curtis, and in the other is a display
of etchings and wood-blocks by Pedro
Lemos.
Samples of All Etchings
The prints by Lemos are of unusual
interest in that they show a sample
of every kind of etching made. It is
possible to obtain a knowledge of the
difference in the varied types of etch
ings and also something of the process.
This is particularly true of the wood
blocks, where a complete set of the
blocks made to produce the print
"Stanford ltoofs" is shown.
Number of Prints Limited.
The number of prints made from a
plate is to small series, from
twenty-five to one hundred. In this way
the quality of the prints is better and
there is no danger of too many dupli
cates. Many prints are marked with a
serial number showing how many are
being made in the set, and the number
of the particular print.
The work has much decorative tech
nique and is rich in color. It also
shows the possibilities of prints as a
medium of art expression. Most of
the scenes are of California, many of
them boing sketched in the Carmel
and Monterey region.
