The Agnetians played the Ignatians
last Saturday. It doesn't rpatter who
won; think of the poor guy taking dic
tation in the office from a correspon
dent in the press box!
One of the mistakes Grange made
during his life was not living in Cali
fornia and coming to Stanford.
Jimmy ,o'Connell is in San Fran
cisco, following the little bribe case in
the East. He claims he didn't know
it was the wrong thing to do, but that
now he does. Not everybody casts buns
on the water and gets hot dogs in
return.
"I'm getting a big kick out of col
lege," said the athlete, and he did.
It costs a club $250 to join the
American Kennel Club. Some people
let money go to the dogs.

Joe Beckett, English
wants to re-enter the ring and make
a comeback. Beckett is afraid that he
will not hold the respect of his son
when he is born. Joe is far-sighted. He
probably is thinking about feeding him
also.
Fishing is said to be the favorite
sport among successful men. Fishing
for suckers.
Liebendorfer and Leiser, two (emi
nent) newspaper men on the campus,
have created a new interest on the
campus playing marbles. All aspiring
students are welcome providing they
bring their own marble.
