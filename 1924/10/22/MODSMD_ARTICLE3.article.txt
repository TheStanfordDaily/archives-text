# Gordon Davis Will Announce Cast Of R. U. R. Tomorrow
## 
### 
On account of the difficult character
of the play and the number of parts
to lie awarded, Gordon Davis declared
it impossible to announce the cast for
the Sword and Sandal play, "R. IT. R."
until tomorrow. He originally planned
to announce the final cast at the try
outs last night but decided that fur
ther rehearsal of the parts would be
necessary.
"The play is expected to be a tre
mendous hit and for that reason great
care must be taken in choosing each
character," said Davis at the tryouts
last night. "Some parts have already
been casted but nothing will be con
sidered absolutely definite until after
further tryouts."
