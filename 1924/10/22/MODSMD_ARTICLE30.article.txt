# TRYOUTS START FOR DRAMATIC MANAGER POSITION TONIGHT
## 
### 
Tryouts for the position of dramatic
manager will start with the Sword
and Sandals play, "R. U. R.," and will
last through the present school year.
The tryoutee work, however, does
not run continuously. Activities of the
men will be concentrated on the week
of each show, which come no oftener
than once each month. There are
seven weeks' work then, for the seven
shows of the school year.
The salary for dramatic manager is
forty dollars a month; the manager is
chosen on the basis of work done, on
capability in management, and on
initiative. The position gives unlimited
opportunities for business and adver
tising experience.
The new manager is appointed by
the outgoing manager, the director of
dramatics, and the graduate manager.
Only members of the sophomore and
junior classes are eligible, and said
members should have an unlimited
supply of fire in their system. All men
interested appear in the office of the
dramatic manager upstairs in the Ad
ministration building in the A. S. S. U.
office tonight at 7 o'clock sharp or call
Delmer Daves for appointment, P. A.
JÂ»4O. The list of trvoutees must, for the
sake of fairness, be limited to eight
best men qualifying.
