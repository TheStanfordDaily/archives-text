# EARLY BASKETBALL PRACTICE INDICATES PLENTY OF MATERIAL
## 
### 
Second week of varsity basketball
j practice shows a squad rapidly round
ing into form. Some promising players
are beginning to appear and there
seems to be little doubt but that the
gaps left in last season's five by
j graduation will be adequately filled.
Practice to date has consisted large
ly in passing, dribbling, and shooting
baskets, but even with this meager
practice and a short scrimmage once
a week it is apparent that there is a
I lot of material for this year's varsity,
according to Captain Dave Oliva, in
charge of the squad.
L. M. Ring, a transfer from New
York State, lias been showing up well
| in passing and shooting baskets and
j is considered as a likely candidate for
' ono of the forward positions. Price,
Alexander, Grace, and Timmins are
also doing well as forwards. David,
who starred on last year's freshman
team, has been kept out of practice to
date because of a bad knee, but is ex
j pected to be on the floor this week.
Clarence Fraser, who has been out
i of school, has returned and is eligible
: for this year's five. He has shown him
! self likely material for either a run
ning guard berth or as one of the for
| wards.
There is plenty of material for cen
| ter with Steele, Carter, and Morrison
! as principals at present and with two
;or three more to appear when the
football season closes.
The squad has been cut to thirty-one
; men and will probably be held to this
number until Coach Andy Kerr takes it
j over. The men who were dropped from
the squad were for the most part too
light for the varsity, but good material
| for the weight teams. Those who sur
j vived the cut are: E. W. Anderson,
T. C. Alexander. E. C. Brady, R. R.
Bruce, H. E. Blazier, F. A. Compton,
J. W. Carter, R. D. Coen, G. 11. Clark,
