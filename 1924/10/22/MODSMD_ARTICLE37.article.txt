# "LIGHTNING" TOPIC OF STANFORD ALUMNUS
## 
### 
"Lightning in the Laboratory and
in Nature" was the subject of an il
lustrated talk by F. W. Peek, Jr., '05,
consulting engineer of the General
Electric Company, to students in en
gineering and physics yesterday.
A short lecture by Peek was supple
mented by slides and motion pictures
which proved of much interest to the
engineers. It was through his efforts
that generation, transmission, and re
ception of power at 220,000 volts has
; been attained.
Tremendous Strides Made
The first generator used for light
ning experimental purposes, in 1915,
gave 200,0*00 volts. The modern gener
ator, designed by Peek, gives 2,000.000
volts, which shows the tremendous
I strides made in the last ten years.
I Experiments are made in the high
j voltage laboratory of the General Elec
tric Company at Pittsfield, Mass.
| "The energy in a bolt of artificial
| lighting is four kilowatt hours, enough
! to run an electric toaster for one day
j or an electric car four or five miles,"
! said Peek.
"If a man six feet tall were stand-
I ing under a cloud 1000 feet above him,
he would be struck fifteen times as
1 often as a man who is lying flat on
; the ground.
"If a lightning rod is 1 per cent
of the cloud height, it will be struck
50 per cent of the time. However, an
■ area around the rod with a radius four
times its height is absolutely safe and
will not be struck.
"There is enough power in one of
: our experimental lightning bolts to
| blow a piece of wood to pieces, or to
i make a steel wire entirely disappear."
| The Uni#rsity of Michigan is offer
j ing a course in horsemanship.
