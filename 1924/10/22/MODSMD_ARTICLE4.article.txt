# JUNIORS WILL HAVE HEAVY ELEVEN FOR INTERCLASS SERIES
## Dave Mannoccir's Team to Take on Seniors in Opening Contest 
### 
With weight as its strong point, the
junior eleven take the field
against the seniors Saturday in an at
tempt to start their race for inter
class grid championship with a vic
tory.
Dave Mannoccir is doing the "Pop"
Warner act with a squad of twenty
aspirants. Man for mail, his charges
stack up about five pounds heavier
than the other three class aggrega
tions, hut'are handicapped by lack of
practice. It is only during the last few
days that the third-year men have
turned out in sufficient numbers to
make scrimmages possible.
Stockbridge at full is the heart of
the offense. He is a good punter and
has sufficient bulk to buck the line
a la Bogue. At quarter Pope, of last
year's goofs, has shown to best ad
vantage, but Kunsel may develop suf
ficient power to boat him out at the
last minute.
Morgan, Frazer, and Wells are put
ting up a thvee-cornered fight for the
halfback berths, and no two men look
good enough to have a cinch at this
stage of the game. Morgan distin
guished himself in an interclass con
test last fall by running through the
entire senior team for a touchdown.
Wing Positions Strong
As center Hood has an edge at pres
ent. but several other contenders may
improvl sufficiently to displace him.
Wilson and Balsley are Mannoccir's
choices for the guard positions, with
Nehf in reserve. At tackle Cameron
and Parker loom as the most likely
candidates, but Hastings is making
them hustle to hold the advantage.
The juniors boast four good ends
in Brown, Briggs, Goldwater, and Kis-
