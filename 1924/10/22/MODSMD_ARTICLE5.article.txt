# RALLY COMMITTEE POOLS EARN THREE FARES TO U. S. C.
## 
### 
Three Stanford students will go to
Los Angeles and return cents
eaeh as the results of the first day's
sales of chances on the pool being
conducted by the Rally committee, as
100 chances in the pool have already
been sold.
The Rally committee will sell
chances on pools every day from 10
to 12 o'clock at the Law steps until
the day before the train leaves, ac
cording to an announcement at noon.
The first drawings to determine the
lucky rooters will take place at the
Santa Clara game, a week from Fri
day. The next drawings will be at the
U. S. C. rally.
If sales today can be considered pro
phetic enough chances will be sold by
the time of the.Trojan game to send
twenty or thirty persons to the game
via the lucky quarter route.
Reservations on the Stanford spe
cial are already being made by the
Southern Pacific company. It is the re
quest of the committee that everyone
intending going to Los Angeles on the
train make reservations at once, or at
least give an indication of his inten
tion to use the special rate offered by
the railroad company. In this way the
trains can be met by the right number
of automobiles in Los Angeles to Carry
all rooters through the southern city's
business district in a gigantic exhibi
tion of Stanford spirit the morninn of
the game.
