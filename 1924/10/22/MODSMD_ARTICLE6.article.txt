## Campaign for Funds to Open Monday ; Aid Needed for Three Charities 
### 
Representatives of the varloys liv
ing groups will meet in the vestry of
the Memorial Church at 5:16 p.m. to
day to discuss the plans for the
autumn charity drive, which will start
Monday. The funds are to be used for
Russian Relief, Greek Relief, and the
Stanford in China movement.
"In the drive we hope to place the
facts before the student in such a way
as to be of educational value," stated
P. E. Morgan, secretary of the Y. M.
C. A. "Yale supports a college and
hospital in Shanghai, Princeton stu
dents and graduates spend $11,000 an
nually for a Canton hospital. The Uni
versity of Pennsylvania spends thou
sands of dollars annually for Canton
medical assistance, and Harvard main
tains a special medical college in
Hunan province. In one year the com
bined contributions of colleges was
$220,000. Stanford gave but $512.
"The provincialism of the western
college places it in unfavorable con
trast with the eastern universities,"
he continued. "We should support the
Stanford in China movement because
the Chinese need an interpretation of
the best in western civilization."
To Establish Workshops in Greece
"It is planned to raise a fund for
the establishment of workshops in
Greece," explained Professor H. C.
Fairclougli, of the Greek Relief com
mittee. "Women and girls unable to
earn a living otherwise may be em
ployed in the production of native em
broidery and handicraft."
Three Stanford men are on the Na
tional Committee, of the American
Friends of Greece: President Ray Ly
man Wilbur; Professor H. R. Fair
dough, who was formerly an Ameri
can Red Cross Commissionpr to the
Balkans; and Professor A. T. Murray,
Annual Professor in the American
School in Athens (1922).
Other Stanford men on the local
committee are: Professor Jefferson
Elmore, who recently visited Greece
and Constantinople; Professor Ernest
Martin, formerly a member of the
Greek Commission of the American
Red Cross at Athens; Professor Eliot
Mears, formerly American trade com
missioner in the Near East, and com
mercial attache in Turkey.
7,000 Russians Destitute
The 7,000 Russians left in Turkey
are described by the representative of
the League of Nations as being the
best of the refugees, as, up to now,
they have been able to maintain them
selves. It is only because Turkey has
rigidly forbidden the employment of
foreigners, that they are no longer
able to work.
"There remain to them but two al
ternatives," observed Mrs. Burt Estes
Howard, chairman of the Russian Re
lief Committee. "There is death by
starvation or their removal to a coun
try where they are permitted to
work."
