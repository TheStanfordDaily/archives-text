# CARDINAL VARSITY LEAVES TONIGHT FOR IDAHO BATTLE
## Twenty Seven Men Go To Portland With Warner For Saturday's Encounter With Vandals

IMMEDIATELY following their last workout on California turf "Pop" Warner
*â–  and twenty-seven varsity gridders board the 5:10 train this afternoon on the
first leg of their trip to Portland, where they meet the University of Idaho
eleven Saturday afternoon in the Card's second conference game of the season.
In the Vandals Stanford encounters its toughest competition of the year to
date. Coach Matthews' men, fresh from victories over Montana and Wash
ington State, are generally rated as one of the strongest teams of the confer
ence and with the knowledge that the lower will be virtually eliminated from
the coast championship race urging on both teams, one of the hardest games
of the year may be expected.
Last Friday, Idaho fought its way to a sensational victory over the Wash
ington State Cougars, scoring three touchdowns in the last quarter to over
come their opponents' lead and win 19 to 3. A week before the Moscow eleven
had shown its offensive strength by crushing the Montana Grizzlies 40 to 13.
$Only one blot stands on the Vandals'

; record, an early season 0 to 0 tie with
Gonzaga, but subsequent showings
have proved that this setback was
largely a case of overconfidence.
The team that the northerners will
put on the field Saturdav is practi
cally the same that was defeated by
the Cards in the stadium last year
| 17 to 7 in what turned out to be the
i most sensational game of the year for
local fans. Only four letter men are
missing from this year's line-up, among
them Bob Kitzke, the giant back whose
long kicks and sweeping runs kept his
i team in the running a year ago. To
take his place Matthews has devel
oped a fast and heavy backfield equally
proficient in straight football and the
open game. Cameron, Nelson, and
Reget have all been playing spectacu
lar ball and if Stivers gets into the
game with his passing Multnomah
P'ield should witness one of the class
iest aerjfd attacks seen on the coast.
Still a Few Injuries
Against this formidable opposition
i Coach Warner will be using a team
depleted by injuries and suffering a
marked disadvantage because of the
foreign field. Ernie Nevers scrim
maged with the first string at yester
i day's practice, but the big fullback
took things easy and there is little
chance that the local coaches will
take a chance on his receiving further
injury by sending him on the field
Saturday. Blake Thomas, regular end,
who is limping about with the ligaments
of his leg badly torn, will not make
the trip north, which means that "Tex"
Middleton will probably start at Port
land. Excepting several minor casual
ties the rest of the squad is in good
condition, but they are likely to find
the going tough in the ankle-deep saw
dust of the Oregon gridiron. U. S. C.
was noticeably slowed up by the soggy
field in their game last week against
the Oregon Aggies and the change
from solid turf can scarcely fail to
make itself apparent in Stanford's
playing.
Offsetting these disadvantages is
the fact that Warner has seemingly
found a satisfactory backfield com
bination. If Bogue, Cleaveland, Kelly,
and Solomon go against Idaho as they
did against Oregon the absence of
Nevers will not be so keenly felt.
Cleaveland's punting Saturday left lit
tle to be desired in the majority of
cases while his sensational work at
carrying the ball, together with

Bogue's great plunging, makes the
team look strong on the offense.

Secondary Defense Shaky

Defensively the backfield left a lot
to be desired. If they play the same
game Saturday that they did against
the Lemon Yellow they will be easy
victims for the open attack the Idaho
team uses. Both of Oregon's touch
downs resulted from a momentary col
lapse of the Stanford secondary de
fense and sfmilar slips might well con
stitute the winning margin against a
team of high caliber. In the line Card
stock rises for the way the "local for
wards have been stopping everything
coming in their direction leaves little
to be desired. The Idaho backs should
find the going rough when they smash
Warner's forward wall.
Taken as a whole the teams seem to
be a good match. Both have shown
promise of offensive strength but both
have been scored upon by opponents.
Warner, Kerr, and Thornhill have been
pounding a lot of football into their
charges during the last few days and
if the situation demands the Cards
may show a lot they have kept covered
to date. A victory by one point will
satisfy the coaching staff and it will
be with the intention of winning and
still uncovering as little as possible
that Stanford will take the field.
