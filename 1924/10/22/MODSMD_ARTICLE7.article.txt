*■ and twenty-seven varsity gridders board the 5:10 train this afternoon on the
first leg of their trip to Portland, where they meet the University of Idaho
eleven Saturday afternoon in the Card's second conference game of the season.
In the Vandals Stanford encounters its toughest competition of the year to
date. Coach Matthews' men, fresh from victories over Montana and Wash
ington State, are generally rated as one of the strongest teams of the confer

the coast championship race urging on both teams, one of the hardest games
of the year may be expected.
Last Friday, Idaho fought its way to a sensational victory over the Wash
ington State Cougars, scoring three touchdowns in the last quarter to over

them Bob Kitzke, the giant back whose
long kicks and sweeping runs kept his

lar ball and if Stivers gets into the
game with his passing Multnomah
P'ield should witness one of the class
iest aerjfd attacks seen on the coast.
Still a Few Injuries
Against this formidable opposition
i Coach Warner will be using a team
depleted by injuries and suffering a
marked disadvantage because of the
foreign field. Ernie Nevers scrim
maged with the first string at yester
i day's practice, but the big fullback
took things easy and there is little
chance that the local coaches will
