# MALONEY'S RETURN STRENGTHENS HOPES OF SOCCER VARSITY
## Stanford Will Clash With Barbarians on Stadium Field Saturday 
### 
With Harry Malouey back in liia
coaching position and with its full
strength on the iield for the first time
this season the Stanford soccer var
sity will meet the Barbarians on the
stadium field Saturday afternoon at 3
o'clock. At the same time the second
varsity will mix with the San Jose
team on the practice field.
In both of the previous games one
or two of the varsity men have been
out with injuries and this game will
test the Cardinal's strength tor the
first time.
"This is really a crucial game," says
Scott Quigley, acting manager of the
team. "The Barbarians are rated as
the strongest team in the league and
a victory over them will bring up
Stanford's rating in the league."
California was recently defeated by
the Barbarians by a 4-1 score, so the
score Saturday will aid the dopesters
to figure the respective strength of
Stanford and the Blue and Gold aggre
gation.
The Barbarians won the league
championship last year and so far this
year they have won every game they
have played.
The second varsity has been work
ing together with better teamwork re
cently and has shown much improve
ment when mixing with first string
men in practice. The team they play
has been comparatively unheard of
this season and, according to Quig
ley, a victory is expected.
