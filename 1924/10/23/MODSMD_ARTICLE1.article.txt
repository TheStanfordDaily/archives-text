Gordon Davis' final selection of the
cast for "Ft. U. R.," the Sword and
Sandals play which is to.be giyen 011
November 14, includes many names
already known to campus theatre
goers.
Helen Lewis, who is to play the
feminine lead, will be remembered for
her excellent work in "Androcles and
the Lion," which was the Sword and
Sandals play of last year. Experience
in several campus productions, cou
pled with her natural ability as an
actress, should enable her to mdke
the most of her appealing role as
Helena Glory, an emissary of the
Humanitarian league, who investi
gates the living conditions of the
"Robots."
The leading male role has been
given to Alan Robertson, who will
make his first appearance on the Stan
ford stage as Domin, the hero of the
play. The selection of Robertson for
the leading male role is evidence of
Gordon Davis' intentions to choose
the best possible cast from the try
outees regardless of previous partici
pation in campus dramatics.
Delmer Daves, in the part of Al
quist, the last human to survive the
onslaugths of the Robot horde, should
have an opportunity to add to his al
ready long list of character successes.
From a fiery Spanish lover in last
year's Junior Opera to a whimpering
broken-down scientist in "R. U. R." is
some jump for any actor to make, but
Daves will probably do it, and do it
well.
Other campus actors who have
prominent parts are A. Grove Day,
who was the butler in both "Captain
Applejack" and "The Dover Road;"
Dorothy Dahler, who gave such a fin
ished performance in "Milestones" last
year; Charles Parks, also of "Mile
stones" fame, and incidentally the
only member of Sword and Sandals
Society in "R. U. R„" and William
Thornton, who was the dramatic
"find" from the freshman class last
year.
Several important minor parts, in
cluding the Robot horde, which is one
of the outstanding features of the
play, have not yet been selected, but
will be announced within a few days.
Rehearsals have started, and with
over three weeks in which to prepare,
Gordon Davis and the Sword and San
dals Society should present to the
campus on November 14 a play de
cidedly well worth seeing.
More tryoutees are needed at once
for the office of Dramatic Manager.
This is one of the few salaried posi
tions open to students, and it gives
a business training which is invalu
able.
Delmer Daves, present Dramatic
Manager, will see tryoutees any eve
ning from 7 to 10 in the Assembly
hall. No previous experience is neces
sary, the only qualification being a
desire to work and an interest in the
managerial end of dramatics.

only member of Sword and Sandals
Society in "R. U. R„" and William
Thornton, who was the dramatic
"find" from the freshman class last
year.
Several important minor parts, in
cluding the Robot horde, which is one
of the outstanding features of the
play, have not yet been selected, but
will be announced within a few days.
Rehearsals have started, and with
over three weeks in which to prepare,
Gordon Davis and the Sword and San
dals Society should present to the
campus on November 14 a play de
cidedly well worth seeing.
More tryoutees are needed at once
for the office of Dramatic Manager.
This is one of the few salaried posi
tions open to students, and it gives
a business training which is invalu
able.
Delmer Daves, present Dramatic
Manager, will see tryoutees any eve
ning from 7 to 10 in the Assembly
hall. No previous experience is neces
sary, the only qualification being a
desire to work and an interest in the
managerial end of dramatics.

Gordon Davis' final selection of the
cast for "Ft. U. R.," the Sword and
Sandals play which is to.be giyen 011
November 14, includes many names
already known to campus theatre
goers.
Helen Lewis, who is to play the
feminine lead, will be remembered for
her excellent work in "Androcles and
the Lion," which was the Sword and
Sandals play of last year. Experience
in several campus productions, cou
pled with her natural ability as an
actress, should enable her to mdke
the most of her appealing role as
Helena Glory, an emissary of the
Humanitarian league, who investi
gates the living conditions of the
"Robots."
The leading male role has been
given to Alan Robertson, who will
make his first appearance on the Stan
ford stage as Domin, the hero of the
play. The selection of Robertson for
the leading male role is evidence of
Gordon Davis' intentions to choose
the best possible cast from the try
outees regardless of previous partici
pation in campus dramatics.
Delmer Daves, in the part of Al
quist, the last human to survive the
onslaugths of the Robot horde, should
have an opportunity to add to his al
ready long list of character successes.
From a fiery Spanish lover in last
year's Junior Opera to a whimpering
broken-down scientist in "R. U. R." is
some jump for any actor to make, but
Daves will probably do it, and do it
well.
Other campus actors who have
prominent parts are A. Grove Day,
who was the butler in both "Captain
Applejack" and "The Dover Road;"
Dorothy Dahler, who gave such a fin
ished performance in "Milestones" last
year; Charles Parks, also of "Mile
stones" fame, and incidentally the
only member of Sword and Sandals
Society in "R. U. R„" and William
Thornton, who was the dramatic
