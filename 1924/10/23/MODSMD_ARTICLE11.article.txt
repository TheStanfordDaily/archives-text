# SEVEN DE HAVILAND PLANES WILL VISIT STANFORD CAMPUS
## Aircraft Squadrons to Arrive Tomorrow Afternoon From San Diego 
### 
Seven De Haviland airplanes from
the Aircraft Squadrons, battlefield San
Diego, under the command of Com
mander Moses, will arrive on the cam
pus tomorrow to visit the aero-dynam
ics laboratory in recognition of the
services to the Navy and to aviation
of Professor William Frederick
Durand, emeritus.
The visit of the naval planes to the
University was arranged following a
suggestion by Commander Moses to
Captain Edward L. Beach, assistant
professor of Naval History at Stan
ford, that the planes call on Professor
Durand. In the absence of Professor
Durand, who is at present attending a
conference on naval aeronautics at
Washington, President R. L. Wilbur
invited the naval representatives to
stop en route to San Francisco where
they will take part in the Navy Day
celebrations.
Due to the uncertainty of the hour
when the planes will leave San Diego
no special program has been arranged
by the University authorities. A can
vas tee is being laid on the polo field
near Encina gymnasium to guide the
flyers to a landing place. A commit
tee consisting of John A. Sellards, en
dowment secretary, chairman, formal
navy officer; President Wilbur, Cap
tain Beach, Major William D. Geary,
Comptroller A. E. Roth, Professor
Everett P. Leslie, and Thayer Todd,
will receive the visitors.
The flyers will be taken on a tour
of the University buildings and
grounds and will be introduced to the
secrets of the aero-dynamics labora
tory by Professor Leslie and Todd
who is a laboratory assistant and an
ex-army pilot.
President Wilbur had hoped to en
tertain the flyers but on receipt of the
following telegram from Commander
Moses, dismissed any such plan:
"Expect stop for short visit Stahford
jon Friday twenty-four en route San
[Francisco. Please have landing tee
| placed in field planes may use. Regret
; uncertain hour of arrival prevents ac
ceptance Mrs. Wilbur's kind invita
: tion."
Professor Durand, who is honored
:by the Navy in this signal manner,
was chairman of the National Advis
ory Committee on Aeronautics at
Washington during the war and scien
tific attache at Paris in 1918-19. The
aero-dynamic laboratory under his
supervision has for several years con
ducted researches on the performance
of air propellers. During the present
year Professor Leslie at Langley Field
conducted flying researches principally
for the Navy and during the same
period Professor Durand conducted a
similar research with a model air
plane made to scale at the laboratory.
Todd assisted Professor Durand.
Professor Durand, who was head of
the mechanical engineering depart
ment until last June, retired at that
time. Soon afterward he wont East to
attend several conferences and has re
cently represented the University at
several educational functions.

Freshmen and sophomores at the Uni
versity of Oklahoma must in the future
have a B average to gain admission to
the School of Medicine.
