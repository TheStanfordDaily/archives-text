# SEVEN DE HAVILAND PLANES WILL VISIT STANFORD CAMPUS
## Aircraft Squadrons to Arrive Tomorrow Afternoon From San Diego 
### 
Seven De Haviland airplanes from
the Aircraft Squadrons, battlefield San
Diego, under the command of Com
mander Moses, will arrive on the cam
pus tomorrow to visit the aero-dynam

services to the Navy and to aviation
of Professor William Frederick
Durand, emeritus.
The visit of the naval planes to the
University was arranged following a
suggestion by Commander Moses to
Captain Edward L. Beach, assistant
professor of Naval History at Stan
ford, that the planes call on Professor
Durand. In the absence of Professor
Durand, who is at present attending a
conference on naval aeronautics at
Washington, President R. L. Wilbur
invited the naval representatives to
stop en route to San Francisco where
they will take part in the Navy Day
celebrations.
Due to the uncertainty of the hour
when the planes will leave San Diego
no special program has been arranged
by the University authorities. A can
vas tee is being laid on the polo field
near Encina gymnasium to guide the
flyers to a landing place. A commit

dowment secretary, chairman, formal
navy officer; President Wilbur, Cap
tain Beach, Major William D. Geary,
Comptroller A. E. Roth, Professor
Everett P. Leslie, and Thayer Todd,
will receive the visitors.
The flyers will be taken on a tour
of the University buildings and
grounds and will be introduced to the
secrets of the aero-dynamics labora
tory by Professor Leslie and Todd
who is a laboratory assistant and an
ex-army pilot.
President Wilbur had hoped to en
