## 
### 
President Coolidge, in speaking to
the Mid-winter Conference of the
Chamber of Commerce of the United
States, will speak to the entire na
tion. At 6:30 this evening his voice
will be clearly audible from Roble hall
to the Geology corner by means of a
300-volt power amplifier and horn on
the receiving set at the University
Radio station.
This high-powered loud speaker will
make it possible for the entire campus
to listen-in on the first address of the
President to the nation at large.
Twenty broadcasting sations are to
be tied together to make this feat pos
sible. Broadcasting stations KPO in
San Francisco and KLX in Oakland
will be used.
