# U. S. C. TICKETS
## LACK BUYERS AT FIRST DAY SALE Rally Committee Donates Money to Send Band To Trojan Game 
### 
Long faces, even to the extent that
chins dusted the floor, were in order
in the Graduate Manager's office yes
terday afternoon when it was found
that but 168 tickets had been sold for
the rooting section at the U. S. C.
game.
Plans of a three-section special
train, of an entire hotel filled with
Stanford students and alumni, of an
immense parade of Cardinal support
ers, and of a well-filled rooting section
in the Los Angeles coliseum seemed
to have taken wing and flown to the
place where the Trojans will be when
"Pop" Warner's varsity finishes them
on November 8, because scarcely a
handful of students had taken advan
tage of the opening sale of rooters'
pasteboards.
Probably upwards of 30 per cent of
the student body intends making the
pilgrimage of conquest to the south
ern city, and unless everyone who is
going to be on hand to see the Trojan
game invests in his-ticket today many
good seats will be lost to Stanford
rooters, and what would have been a
rooting section will be partially filled
with outsiders.
No announcement has been made
that the sale yesterday and today is
the last for rooters, but it is improb
able that any more will be put on sale.
Rooters' tickets purchased now and
not used can be turned in without loss
to the purchaser.
The Rally committee made an ap
propriation of $600 last night to par
tially defray the expenses of trans
porting the Stanford band to Los An-
geles. The budget of the committee
was also announced, as follows:
Income
Sale of rooters' hats $ 600.00
Proceeds of dance 100.00
Profits from Grid-Graph 300.00
Total $1000.00
Expenditures
Donation to band GOO.OO
Big Game stunts and rally 400.00
Total $1000.00 i
With the exception of the disap
pointing sale of rooters' tickets plans
are booming right along for the Tro
jan game. The Los Angeles alumni as
sociation has asked for 200 rooters'
tickets to be used by its members.
This will substantially increase the
size of the rooting section.
Reservations are still being made by
the Southern Pacific for places on the
special train and early indications
point to a goodly number of students
and San Francisco and Bay Region
alumni planning to make the trip that
way.

Reservations are still being made by
the Southern Pacific for places on the
special train and early indications
point to a goodly number of students
and San Francisco and Bay Region
alumni planning to make the trip that
way.
Long faces, even to the extent that
chins dusted the floor, were in order
in the Graduate Manager's office yes
terday afternoon when it was found
that but 168 tickets had been sold for
the rooting section at the U. S. C.
game.
Plans of a three-section special
train, of an entire hotel filled with
Stanford students and alumni, of an
immense parade of Cardinal support
ers, and of a well-filled rooting section
in the Los Angeles coliseum seemed
to have taken wing and flown to the
place where the Trojans will be when
"Pop" Warner's varsity finishes them
on November 8, because scarcely a
handful of students had taken advan
tage of the opening sale of rooters'
pasteboards.
Probably upwards of 30 per cent of
the student body intends making the
pilgrimage of conquest to the south
ern city, and unless everyone who is
going to be on hand to see the Trojan
game invests in his-ticket today many
good seats will be lost to Stanford
rooters, and what would have been a
rooting section will be partially filled
with outsiders.
No announcement has been made
that the sale yesterday and today is
the last for rooters, but it is improb
able that any more will be put on sale.
Rooters' tickets purchased now and
not used can be turned in without loss
to the purchaser.
The Rally committee made an ap
propriation of $600 last night to par
tially defray the expenses of trans
porting the Stanford band to Los An-
geles. The budget of the committee
was also announced, as follows:
Income
Sale of rooters' hats $ 600.00
Proceeds of dance 100.00
Profits from Grid-Graph 300.00
Total $1000.00
Expenditures
Donation to band GOO.OO
Big Game stunts and rally 400.00
Total $1000.00 i
With the exception of the disap
pointing sale of rooters' tickets plans
are booming right along for the Tro
jan game. The Los Angeles alumni as
sociation has asked for 200 rooters'
tickets to be used by its members.
This will substantially increase the
size of the rooting section.
