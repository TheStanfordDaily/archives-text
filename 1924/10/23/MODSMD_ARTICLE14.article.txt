# U. S. C. TICKETS
## LACK BUYERS AT FIRST DAY SALE Rally Committee Donates Money to Send Band To Trojan Game

Long faces, even to the extent that
chins dusted the floor, were in order
in the Graduate Manager's office yes
terday afternoon when it was found
that but 168 tickets had been sold for
the rooting section at the U. S. C.

Stanford students and alumni, of an
immense parade of Cardinal support

place where the Trojans will be when
"Pop" Warner's varsity finishes them
on November 8, because scarcely a
handful of students had taken advan

pasteboards.
Probably upwards of 30 per cent of
the student body intends making the
pilgrimage of conquest to the south
ern city, and unless everyone who is
going to be on hand to see the Trojan
game invests in his-ticket today many
good seats will be lost to Stanford
rooters, and what would have been a
rooting section will be partially filled
with outsiders.
No announcement has been made
that the sale yesterday and today is
the last for rooters, but it is improb
able that any more will be put on sale.
Rooters' tickets purchased now and
not used can be turned in without loss
to the purchaser.
The Rally committee made an ap
propriation of $600 last night to par
tially defray the expenses of trans
porting the Stanford band to Los An-
