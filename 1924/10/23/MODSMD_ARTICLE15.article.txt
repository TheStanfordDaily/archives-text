# JORDAN TO ADDRESS LECTURE GROUP ON U. S. IMMIGRATION
## 
### 
"Immigration to America" will be the
subject of Dr. Jordan's discussion at his
home at 7 :30 tonight. He will consider
the origin of the country and the different
grades of immigrants that have come
over here in the past.
Dissenters from England made up the
basis of the population in the North and
the younger sons of aristocratic families
took up large holdings in the South.
The South also received a heavy burden
of the prisoners for debt who were the
foundation for the poor white popula
tion there today. Dutch and Swedes set
tled the midde country and fitted in well
with the settlers already there.
The character of the immigrants has
been largely changed. The effort has
been to stop the current until they could
decide what to do, but now it is abso
lutely necessary to stop it. "There have
been many difficulties connected with the
problem, and the situation has been dealt
with in a raw and stupid way. In regard
to Asia it has been grossly insulting,"
declared Dr. Jordan.
