The ultimate solution of the train versus boat controversy was not
1 attained without one concluding skirmish, which brought out a number
of mistakes and misunderstandings and convinced the "Daily" that it
had taken too extreme a stand on the matter.
I - undamentally, the stand of the "Daily" was for a united Stanford
movement, and as such was correct. A series of conferences with the
■ maligned parties, however, brought out the conviction that the campaign
! was merely against the rather acrimonious and so-called "high-handed"
method of handling the affair through the "Daily." In no sense was
: it an effort to derail the special train project, nor were there any mer
cenary motives involved. These facts put the matter on an entirely
different footing. »
Although relieved at the erasure of a supposed ugly situation, the
•"Daily regrets the fact that a peculiar chain of circumstances induccd a
vVrong conclusion and hastens to withdraw the charge of "acquisitive
reasons made in last night s editorial column. As was also stated last
night, no campaign is being made along lines apart from the accepted
program.
