# Once and For All Quarter
## 
### 
• A meeting of representatives from the living groups was held yesterday
afternoon to organize the quarterly appeal for charitable purposes, which
will be put up to the students next week.
Stanford in the past has been fairly riddled with charity drives. Almost
every week the impecunious student sallied forth to be confronted with a
new tag, to be purchased and worn proudly wrapped around a prominent
button. 1 hat custom wore itself out, and now the drives are organized,
lumped, and presented at the rate of one concerted appeal each quarter, to
the.; great convenience of the student body.
That step was made in behalf of the student, and in behalf of the
appeals the student should reciprocate by whole-heartedly doing his best
for the concentrated charity. This particular affair comes just at the time
when the Stanford man and woman are figuring earnestly on just how to
reach the U. S. C. game, without having quite enough money. For this
reason, the signing of pledges payable later in the quarter should enjoy
greater popularity than usual. Through this loop-hole, Stanford will be
able to accord proper Stanford support to football and her own charity
drive with equal adequacy.
1 he three causes which will be presented this fall—Russian Relief,
Greek Relief, and Stanford in China—have been thoroughly presented
and must be well understood. It should be unnecessary to impress upon
the Stanford public that contributions to such worthy causes as these
form an important part of any well-balanced, comprehensive budget.
Yet Stanford is well below par in the matter of intelligent charity support.
We jare fortunate in having our appeals so organized that we can deal
with them in a single campaign each quarter. However, this saving in
time and trouble should not result in diminished effectiveness. We should
all lie £ble to pledge now and pay later, even though it may be nearly
impossible to pay now.

CORNELL'S cross-country coach has ruled that his squad promote
training* by swearing* off the use of trolleys or flivvers. We wonder how
many theatrical luminaries perfect their technique by mixing business
with pleasure.
