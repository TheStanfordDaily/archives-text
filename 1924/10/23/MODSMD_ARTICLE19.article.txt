A general "house cleaning" of campus
activities was suggested by President
Wilbur and Dean Yost at the assembly
yesterday morning. Every community,
it was said, needs a thorough cleaning
ever so often, and Stanford is no excep
tion. It is only too easy for a well-mean
ing organization to deteriorate into
something which only clogs the wheels
of progress. There is at least one such
society on the campus; last year it elect
ed to membership, among others, a man
who had taken the smallest part possible
in its activities; it wholly ignored a man
who had given much enthusiastic, tal
ented worjc to it. One man had a pre
ponderance of fraternity brothers in the
organization; the other did not.
Isn't it about time Stanford had an
activity house cleaning?
Stanford is rapidly getting the repu
tation for having a campus which is
kept in the finest condition of any in the
United States. Clothes may not "make
the man," or the campus the University,
but it reveals a great deal.
Yesterday Dean Culver said, "There
is a boy on this campus whom I call into
my office every once in a while . . . just
to look at him ; his smile, his personality,
are an inspiration to me." Everyone
can't be an inspiration; but to be a drag
is unnecessary and unforgivable.
Speaking of inspirations, the sopho
mores certainly possessed one at the
head of their band a few moments be
fore the initial attack of the freshman
sophomore fight.
This column was initiated with the
idea of presenting criticism rather than
praise of the University. Rut you agree
that entire consistency IS a bore?
Now that "Chaparral" ranks first
among college comics, thanks to Mike
| Ely; and ordon Davis has brought dra
matics to the point where it astounds
(flatteringly) a critic like Charles Nor
ris; and our campus is declared the best
j groomed in America ... no football
I games lost so far this season, and the
; biggest victory yet to come—is it any
wonder entrance requirements are being
j raised?

in its activities; it wholly ignored a man
who had given much enthusiastic, tal
ented worjc to it. One man had a pre
ponderance of fraternity brothers in the
organization; the other did not.
Isn't it about time Stanford had an
activity house cleaning?
Stanford is rapidly getting the repu
tation for having a campus which is
kept in the finest condition of any in the
United States. Clothes may not "make
the man," or the campus the University,
but it reveals a great deal.
Yesterday Dean Culver said, "There
is a boy on this campus whom I call into
my office every once in a while . . . just
to look at him ; his smile, his personality,
are an inspiration to me." Everyone
can't be an inspiration; but to be a drag
is unnecessary and unforgivable.
Speaking of inspirations, the sopho
mores certainly possessed one at the
head of their band a few moments be
fore the initial attack of the freshman
sophomore fight.
This column was initiated with the
idea of presenting criticism rather than
praise of the University. Rut you agree
that entire consistency IS a bore?
Now that "Chaparral" ranks first
among college comics, thanks to Mike
| Ely; and ordon Davis has brought dra
matics to the point where it astounds
(flatteringly) a critic like Charles Nor
ris; and our campus is declared the best
j groomed in America ... no football
I games lost so far this season, and the
; biggest victory yet to come—is it any
wonder entrance requirements are being
j raised?
