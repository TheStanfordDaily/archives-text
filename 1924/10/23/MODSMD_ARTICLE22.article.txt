# No. 4. FLYING AT NIGHT
## 
### 
Continuous air mail service from San
Francisco to New York—3,ooo miles in
31 hours and 35 minutes—naturally re
quires night flying. Air mail pilots fly
nearly 1,000 miles, one-third of the way
across the continent, in the dead of night.
These flights are among the longest sus
tained journeys ever undertaken in the
dark.
But the way in which this could be
done with safety was a problem which
puzzled the authorities for a long time.
No Night Flying
In the first five years of its existence,
air mail traveled 5,281,823 miles in the
air; traveled 4,623,115 of those miles
with mail; carried 160,473,600 letters;
cost $4,299,967.69; made 8,373 trips in
fog, rain, hail, or snow; made 14,704
trips in clear weather; maintained an
average schedule performance of 90.39
per cent; BUT DID PRACTICALLY
NO FLYING AT NIGHT.
There were no experiences of the past
to guide them in their new venture. Many
experiments were made, the result is
night flying has been made almost as
safe as day flying.
Blinding Beacons Used
Emergency fields have been located
and lighted twenty-five miles on
the route, besides the regular larger
landing fields. At the landing fields

600,000,000 candle-power beacons are
mounted on high towers. These are vis
ible for a distance of about fifty miles.
They are quite different from the shore
lighthouse beacons; because to suit the
needs of the air they swing around on
the top of their towers, throwing a beam
thre*» degrees above the horizon, three
complete revolutions being made every
minute.
"Every effort has been made to safe
guard the mail planes," says Mrs. M. M.
Thomas, acting postmaster at the Stan
ford University office. "As I understand
it, the flyers have a straight line of elec
tric lights to follow at night. Besides
the regular terminal fields at which the
600,000,000 candle-power lights are lo
cated, and the emergency fields where less
powerful beacons are maintained, there
are small lights every three miles direct
ing the ray toward the sky.
Follow Lighted Path
"Thus the air pilot can see a narrow
line of light stretching for miles and
miles, which he can easily follow. On
a cloudy night the aviator depends upon
the three-mile lights for guidance, while
on a clear night he can sec the 25-mile
beacons with ease.
"Even though every precaution is be
ing taken to safeguard the flyers, whose
duty it is to fly at night, the hazards of
this work should not be minimized."

NO FLYING AT NIGHT.
There were no experiences of the past
to guide them in their new venture. Many
experiments were made, the result is
night flying has been made almost as
safe as day flying.
Blinding Beacons Used
Emergency fields have been located
and lighted twenty-five miles on
the route, besides the regular larger
landing fields. At the landing fields

600,000,000 candle-power beacons are
mounted on high towers. These are vis
ible for a distance of about fifty miles.
They are quite different from the shore
lighthouse beacons; because to suit the
needs of the air they swing around on
the top of their towers, throwing a beam
thre*» degrees above the horizon, three
complete revolutions being made every
minute.
"Every effort has been made to safe
guard the mail planes," says Mrs. M. M.
Thomas, acting postmaster at the Stan
ford University office. "As I understand
it, the flyers have a straight line of elec
tric lights to follow at night. Besides
the regular terminal fields at which the
600,000,000 candle-power lights are lo
cated, and the emergency fields where less
powerful beacons are maintained, there
are small lights every three miles direct
ing the ray toward the sky.
Follow Lighted Path
"Thus the air pilot can see a narrow
line of light stretching for miles and
miles, which he can easily follow. On
a cloudy night the aviator depends upon
the three-mile lights for guidance, while
on a clear night he can sec the 25-mile
beacons with ease.
"Even though every precaution is be
ing taken to safeguard the flyers, whose
duty it is to fly at night, the hazards of
this work should not be minimized."
Continuous air mail service from San
Francisco to New York—3,ooo miles in
31 hours and 35 minutes—naturally re
quires night flying. Air mail pilots fly
nearly 1,000 miles, one-third of the way
across the continent, in the dead of night.
These flights are among the longest sus
tained journeys ever undertaken in the
dark.
But the way in which this could be
done with safety was a problem which
puzzled the authorities for a long time.

air mail traveled 5,281,823 miles in the
