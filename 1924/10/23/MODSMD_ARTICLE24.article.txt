# MISS MIRRIELEES HAS STORY IN "ATLANTIC"
## 
### 
Miss Edith Mirriclees of the Eng
| lish department has had a story pub
lished in the August number of the At
lantic Monthly.
In this story, "Professor Boynten
Rereads History," she brought out the
point that while theoretically a man is
| tried by his equals in a jury trial, in
practice this not" true; all the men
Jof acknowledged mental ability, edu
cation, and background, such as pro
; fessors, doctors, and teachers, are cx
| cused because of their profession from
jury duty. Professor Boynten, who has
| always taken these matters for granted,
and has believed in their justice, is ac
; cused of murden on perjured evidence,
and discovers that his mental equals will
not form his jury, but more probably his
butcher, his grocer, and perhaps his ash
man.
