Plans for the Asilomar house party
were discussed at the Y. W. C. A.
banquet held last night in the Union.
Approximately 300 women were pres
ent at the dinner which was spon
sored by the Y. W. C. A. for the pur
pose of fostering University spirit
among the women.
Miss Alice Hoyt, Western Division
secretary of the national Y. W. C. A.,
spoke concerning Asilomar. Miss
Isabel Capps sang some Asilomar
songs accompanied by Maria Ander
son at the piano. Other speakers of
the evening were: Miss Mary Yost,
Anna Fitzhugh, and Gladys McLeod.
Miss Louise Irwin held the lucky
ticket which entitles her to a free ride
to the house party at Asilomar Nov. 1.

The faculty of Ohio State Univer
sity maintains that European students
go to college in order to study under
some great instructor, but that Ameri
can students go because of the new
million-dollar stadium.
