# PRESIDENT WILBUR RECEIVES LETTER FROM W.F. DURAND
## University Representative Makes Detailed Report On Conventions 
### 
President Wilbur received today the
following letter from Professor Emeritus
William F. Durand, now president of the
American Association of Mechanical
Engineers, who has been representing
the University at various ceremonies
recently:
"My Dear President Wilbur:
"I wish to give you a brief report of
my ambassadorship in connection with
the various academic ceremonies which
1 have recently attended at your request
as a representative of Stanford Uni
versity.
"The centennial anniversary at Troy
was a very impressive and inspiring oc
casion. It was attended by delegates
representing some 228 institutions and
organizations. In some cases, especially
foreign, the delegates doubled up in their
representation, so that the actual number
of accredited delegates was somewhat
les than the institutions represented. The
exercises were spread over two days in
accordance with the program, which per
haps you may have seen, but of which
I send a copy under separate cover. Per
sonally, I found a special interest in re
newing acquaintance with the two French
delegates, with both of whom 1 had been
thrown into intimate personal relations
during my year in Paris, 1918-19.
0 "In Montreal the occasion was the
opening of a new 'Pathological Institute'
as a part of the medical school equip
ment of McGill University. I had feared,
here, that 1 should find myself out of
the picture among eminent pathologists
and medical luminaries. I found, how
ever, plenty of company among the dele
gates who were as innocent of a knowl
edge of pathology as was I. The dedi
catory address was made by a Dr. Boy
cott of the University of London. The
number ot delegates from the States was
not large, though a considerable number
among the leading Eastern institutions
were represented.
"The building was fine and seemed to
be splendidly built and equipped—the
way the English do things when they
really undertake. This function took
place in the afternoon. In the evening
they had a combined "Founder's Day'
and graduation exercises (for last year's
left overs) followed by reception, etc.
"Here a-gain I was fortunate in find
. ing a professor of mathematics with
j whom I was intimate at Cornell in the
long ago, and it was pleasant to talk
over old times—also a professor of
physics with whom I had had some con
tact during the war.
"At Cleveland the inauguration ot
President Vinson was very largely at
tended, though the representation was
not as cosmopolitan as in the case ot
Troy.
"The exercises went off according to
program, a copy of which I send undei
separate cover. In the afternoon, as yoi
will note, the event was the dedication
of the new medical building. You very
likely know of this building, said to hav
been erected and equipped for We
Reserve University by a Mr. Samuel
Mather at a cost of $2,500,000.
"Dr. Roger Perkins, Professor of Sani
tary Science on the medical faculty, wa
the medical memi>er of my staff in P:>*
in 1918-1919. and it was very pleasant
indeed to see him again. He showed me
about the building and. while 1 could not
of course, judge as an expert, it seem
to be the result of a great deal of study
and care in design and to realize the las
word in equipment for the purposes i
tended.
"I had, also, in former vears, com
into contact with both President E
tus Thwing and President Vinson,
it was pleasant to revive this associa'
on the occasion of the inauguration <
the latter.
"At each of the three institutions I
took the lil>erty of conveying to the
President your personal and ofikr
greetings and felicitations in connection
with the event celebrated—the same be
ing in each case received with due ex
pressions of thanks and appreciation.
"I find on totalling up my adventures
of the past ten days that I have been ex
posed to twenty-seven addresses and

thirteen post-praudial speeches. It re-,
mains to be seen in just v\hat manner I !
_
shall break out, but so far no ill effects
arc observable.
"Sincerely and with all good wishes |
for yourself and for the University.
(Signed) "W. F. DURAND."
