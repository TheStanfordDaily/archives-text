Fred Swan, fresh from last year's
1927 team anil a recent marriage, lias
been performing better than any Card
inal linesman this season. Swan is
hard to hurt, and it takes ingenuity
on the part of his opponent from get
ting himself hurt. Swan is invariably
one of the first under a punt. Do you
know what that means? It means that
he must first block his man in the line
and then break away down the field to
head off the receiver. Swan has missed
few tackles this year. That takes skill.

Some people get their heads on a
coin, but most of us are satisfied to
get our hands 011 them.

Famous last words: '"Honey, hand
me the castor-oil; It's right next to the
strychnine bottle."

Stanford has had three sets of
brothers 011 the same football team
in the last few years, but never before
has there been brothers playing shout- j
der to shoulder, as the Shipkey broth- j
ers are doing this season. One season 1
after Stanford resumed playing Ameri- j
can football there were the two i
Selilaudeman brothers, Flab and Bob, i
in the backiield. Last year Jim and
Dick Lawson played 011 the same var
sity until Dick received injuries which
compelled him to quit the game.
