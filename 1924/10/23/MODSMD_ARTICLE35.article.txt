# Petition Is Necessary For Study-Card Changes
## 
### 
Today is the last day that study- j
lists can be changed except under
| special conditions.
The first three weeks of the quarter
are allotted for re-arrangement of ;
j courses. Permission to drop subjects ;
must then be obtained by submitting, j
through petition to the committee on
I scholarship, valid reasons, such as ill- :
1 ness and other exceptional excuses, j
New courses cannot be taken up with- j
out petition and payment of the late- }
registration fine.
During the last three weeks of any
quarter no changes in courses can be '
made. A student finding it impossible |
to complete his work must either take 1
h failure or an incomplete and arrange
to make up his work as early as pos
sible.
