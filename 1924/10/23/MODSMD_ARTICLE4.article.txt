# DAWES PLAN HELPED BY EXPERIENCES OF LEAGUE IN AUSTRIA
## 
### 
"Our present Dawes' plan is the nat
ural evolution of two schemes promul
gated by the League of Nations for the
rehabilitation of Austria and Hungary,
and it profits by their experiences."
This statement was made by Walter
Thomas Layton, director of the Eco
nomic and Financial section of the League
and editor of the London Economist, at
his lecture on "Reconstruction in Central
Europe under the League," in the Little
Theatre yesterday afternoon.
Brussels Conference
Layton began his talk with an account
of the Brussels conference in 1920, which
was the first summoned by the League.
A series of resolutions were produced
at this meeting, among which was "It is
essential that nations should balance
their budget."
Because of. the terrible conditions in
Europe at this time, this balancing was
difficult. All countries had unbalanced
budgets; some countries were new politi
cal units; production had been stopped
by the war; the people were mentally
: depressed.
League Helps Austria
"Austria was perhaps worse off than
! any European country, with the excep-
I tion of Germany," Layton stated. "By
| 1921 it was going from bad to worse and
, appealed to the Supreme Council for aid.
! The latter turned the question over to
| the financial committee of the League
j for settlement.
| "After careful study a plan was finally
i devised. It was a year later before the
; United States was won over to abide by
it. A loan guaranteed by European pow
ers was floated, and went a long way
toward putting Austria on its feet,
j "Now the Austrian crown is worth
1 much more than the League had wanted.
It was accomplished because Austria
agreed to give up all her financial rights,
and let the League control them.
"Austria would not have consented to
this if but one country had taken charge.
It could never have hee'n succcssftil it
it had been undertaken by one country;
that is where the League enters."
