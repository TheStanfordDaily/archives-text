# TENNIS TEAM RETURNS FROM TOUR OF AUSTRALIA WITH GOOD RECORD
## Mertz And Hinckley Defeat Anderson And Peach, Davis Cup Men, In Doubles 
### Harry Bennett 
After spending the summer in Au
stralia playins seventeen scheduled
matches the Stanford tennis team, in
cluding 1 ed Mertz, Harold Overt'elt,
Dick Hinckley, and Norman De√üack,
and Harry Maloney, team manager,
arrived in San Francisco Tuesday on
board the S. S. Matsonia.
Of the seventeen matches played
only five were lost. These losses were
credited to the fact that constant
travel was necessary to keep up to the
schedule and with this travel both
grass and asphalt courts were en
countered, much to UK; team's disad
vantage.
New South Wales Wins
The only important game lost was
the one to the New South Wales team
in Sydney. This team included such
players as Norman Peach and J. O.
Anderson, both of whom are Davis
Cup men. Anderson is the leading
player of Australia.
During the first test match with the
team representing New South Wales,

Ted Mertz and Dick Hinckley beat
Anderson and Peach in doubles. Of
this match the tennis expert on a
Sydney newspaper says: "The defeat
of Anderson and Peach by these two
young university students from Stan
ford was not only a noteworthy feat
but one that should forever go down
in the athletic history of the Univer
sity. Even if this young Stanford team
did not win any more matches during
their Australian tour, their win over
such brilliant players as Anderson and
Peach alone justify the tour."
Peach Off Form
The day that Mertz and Hinckley
beat Anderson and Peach the former
played brilliant tennis while the latter
was undoubtedly off form. After the
game Anderson told Harry Maloney
that he and his partner were beaten
by a better team that day.
The tour was not only successful
from the standpoint of games won but
also from the standpoint of the healthy
publicity gained for Stanford Univer
sity.
"From the moment the team arrived
in Sydney until the day they sailed for
home, the people with whom we had
come in contact had done everything
possible," says Harry Malonev. "They
not only made our stay in Australia
very pleasant but the tour itself from
the standpoint of experience and
knowledge gained of a people and a
country much larger than the United
States, situated some 6000 miles from
the Stanford "Farm" is truly equiva
lent to two years of college work.
Tennis Popular Sport
"Tennis is the most popular sport
in Australia and more people partici
pate in this game than in any other
branch of athletics, according to Harry
Malonev, who further says, "Tennis
in California, or, one might say, tennis
in America, is something akin to golf.
That is, where finances are concerned;
for it is considered to be a rich man's
game. Not so in Australia."
In that country tennis is a major
sport in universities, colleges, private,
and public schools. The game is
played by the lawyer, doctor, profes
sional men in general, business men,
and mechanics.
Tennis courts and tennis clubs stare
one in the face from all sides when
motoring the suburbs or through or
around a city of any consequence. To
the tourist it is astonishing the num
ber of tennis courts that are seen.
10,000 Courts in Sydney
It is estimated that there are 10,000
tennis courts in the city of Sydney
and the suburbs; 8,000 in Melbourne,
and 6,000 in Brisbane. In comparison
there are said to be 250 courts in the
whole of San Francisco, notwithstand
ing the climate.
"When one stops to consider the
vast importance of tennis as a sport
in Australia, one can readily under
stand the vast amount of interest
shown in the visit of the Stanford
team," says Maloney. "Furthermore,
the results obtained find the number
of matches won, especially when there
were so many to choose from, is re
markable.
"During the sixteen years that I
have been connected with athletics at
Stanford I have traveled from coast

to coast with Stanford teams, I have
been to Olympic games with the
teams, and on several occasions 1 have
been to Canada with Stanford men,
but I feel safe in saying that this trip
surpasses all other trips. This is from
the standpoint of the results accom
plished, both as to the games won
together with the healthy publicity
that the tour earned for Stanford.
"Members of the team represented
Stanford, and the people with whom
they came in contact with in Australia,
realize that there is a University
known as Stanford University, situ
ated some thirty miles south of Svn
Francisco. They also know that this
University not only turns out men
skilled in athletic achievements but
also turns out men ingrained with the
idea that to "play the game" is the
only thing worth while in life. Such
are the impression these men left be
hind them."
