# F. E. MORGAN HEADS CHARITY DRIVE FOR STUDENTS IN CHINA
## Campaign Enables Stanford To Help Leaders in Building Republic 
### 
"Stanford in China brings the aid
of student to student," said F. E. Mor
gan, Secretary of the Y. M. C. A. "In
the drive, which is a part of the three
autumn Charities campaign, starting
Monday, we hope to raise money !
enough to complete some of the work
these student secretaries have
started."
"We help support Tracy K. Jones,
the Y. M. C. A. Secretary for all, stu
dents in China," he continued. "His
big task is to interpret the best in
America to the young nation-builders
of the Orient, that they may build a
workable republic of 400,000,000 peo
ple on the pattern of America.
"The detail of the work in the city
of Canton is unending. A large part
of the city's income was from licensed
vice, and crime. The student secretary
started a campaign in the Red Light
district, and visited fifteen colleges to
describe the situation. He roused the
interest of 5,000 students, had protest
parades, and effectively cleaned up the
entire district.
"There is the danger that many
think the Y. M. C. A. secretaries are
just missionaries," explained Morgan.
"The aim of these workers is to pro
vide a practical ideal of living that
will be applicable to government as is
told by the former Chinese President,
Li Yuan Hung."
"Young men that the country needs
most at the present time are those
who-are sound morally, intellectually,
physically and socially," stated Presi
dent Hung. "The Y. M. C. A. is train
ing them exactly in that direction. It
is radiating its good influence in near
ly every city of importance in China."
