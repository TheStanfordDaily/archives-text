# SENIORS TO BATTLE JUNIOR GRID TEAM IN INITIAL CONTEST
## 'Nip' McHose Looms as Triple Threat Man on Fourth Year Aggregation 
### 
Relying on a fast and shifty attack,
built around "Nip" McHose at quarter,
to carry them to victory, the senior
football men will clash with the jun
iors in their first game of the inter
class series Saturday.
The senior coaching staff consists of
"Oz" Osborne as head mentor and
Dick Fullerton as line coach. Until
this week they have had a struggle to
get enough men out to form two
squads for scrimmage. Most of the
aspirants have had previous experi
ence on interclass teams or on the
Gray squad, but are out of condition.
The crying need is for a pair of good
ends, as the candidates have shown
very little speed. If no promising ma
terial is unearthed soon Osborne may
have to shift two of the halves to
wing positions. No definite line-up has
been selected as yet.
McHose Triple Threat Man
McHose is the driving power of a
light but tricky backfield. He is a
triple threat man, passing, punting,
and plunging in addition to calling
signals. He will probably be used as
safety. "Hap" Kennedy has also shown
punch on the offense. Other likely
backs are Clark, Pillette, and Ruddy.
Possibilities for a strong defense are
not quite so rosy. There are two heavy
men in the line, but the others are
relatively light and lacking in knowl
edge off the game. Blaine looks like
the best bet for center, being an ac
curate passer and a good line smasher.
For guard and tackle berths Hayes,
Plater, and Willis loom best at pres
ent.
