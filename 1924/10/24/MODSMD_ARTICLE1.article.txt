# GRID-GRAPH TO REPORT COURSE OF IDAHO GAME
## U. S. C. Rooters Tickets to Be Placed on Sale Next Week; 200 Remain Unsold 
### 
Having successfully weathered the
world's series struggle, the Grid-graph
has cast aside its diamond garb, and
will appear in the stadium tomorrow
in the form of a gridiron, where it
will give a play-by-play account of the
Stanford-Idaho game at Portland.
The first plays received will be
saved until the half of the freshman-
U. S. C. game, when they will be run
oft' without delay.
The telegraph and operating service
for the Grid-graph is very expensive,
and in order to make the Grid-graph
self-sustaining the Rally committee
has deemed it necessary to levy a 15-
cent charge on each ticket to the
freshman contest. This amount will be
collected at the gate.
Rooters' Tickets on Sale
The initial sale of rooters' tickets
for the U. S. C. game ended yesterday
with a total of more than 500 sold. At
present, there "are approximately 200
tickets unsold and the Graduate Mana
ger's office has decided to place them
on sale sometime next week. When
they are disposed of no more tickets
will be given out for $1 but the regu
lar price of $2 will be charged.
An order was issued from the Presi
dent's office yesterday restraining the
raffling of railroad tickets by the Rally
committee. It has not yet been de
cided if the sales will be allowed to
continue at some later date, nor
whether some other form of pool can
be substituted for the raffle. Should
the sale be stopped permanently,
measures will be taken by the Rally
committee to protect those who have
already purchased chances. In the
meantime students will continue
spending their money on 400-1 chances
in slot machines, rather than on the
140-1 chances of the Rally committee.
So that the freshmen will be able
to join in the singing at the U. S. C.
game a freshman rally will be held at 1
the hall Wednesday night. At this
time members of the Rally committee
will teach the yearlings all of the
Stanford songs and yells.
A few bleacher stunts will be staged
at the U. S. C. game. They will con
sist of nothing more than a big "S,"
or perhaps the word "Stanford."
Only forty-five tickets had been sold
on the Rooters' special by noon today.
As about 250 will be necessary to
make up a special train, it can be 1
seen by simple deduction just how
likely it is that there will be more
than one section to the special. Space
on the Rooters' train is also being sold
to alumni in the city, and railroad of-1
ficials are still optimistic that enough
persons will decide to go by way of
the train to make up two sections.
Students intending going on the train
should make reservations at once.
