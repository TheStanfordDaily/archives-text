# BABE STRENGTH TO BE TESTED BY U.S.C.
## Outcome of Battle Tomorrow Will Give Line on Cardinal Chances Against California Cubs 
### Douglas Meservey 
U. S. C. Freshman football men leave Los Angeles on the Lark tonight and
will arrive in Palo Alto at 9:10 tomorrow morning.

117 HEN the Stanford freshpian gridders trot out on the field tomorrow against
the invading Trojan babes, they will have reached the roughest and most
trying spot on the road to the "Little Big Game."
Two weeks from tomorrow the Cubs of Berkeley will be the invaders. To
some extent, the showing made tomorrow by "Husky" Hunt's proteges will
determine in what manner the Cubs return to their haunts on November 8 —
triumphant or skulking. The Cardinal strength is on trial.
Too little importance is attached each year to the annual Trojan-Card
freshman battle but it is a fact that the U. S. C. babes, season after season,
give the Cards as much to think about as do the California Cubs. And
tomorrow's struggle will prove no exception to the rule. Chet Dolley, former

-Trojan varsity skipper, is coming
north with a strong and heavy aggre
gation of former high school stars who
hope to give the Card yearlings the
same drubbing as last year.
Dolley reported recently that his
team averaged 178 pounds, which is
seven less than Hunt's gridders. The
Trojan coach, however, is making up
for it with a strong line and a fast
backfield.
Among his backs who are supposed
to play havoc with the Stanford line,
was to have been Martin Drury, for
mer fullback of the Long Beach high
school "Jackrabbits" and a clever
open-field runner. Against him. Hunt
had hoped to pit the ability, in the
same department, of Don Hill, former
team-mate of Drury and now a con
sistent ground-gainer at left half for
the Card freshmen.
But Drury tangled his jaw with
terra firma last week and came out
the worse for wear, keeping him out
of the game tomorrow. Too bad! An
otherwise spectacular game could
have been made more so by the efforts
of theße two to cop yardage-honors.
"Husky" himself is, as usual, hope
ful but noncommittal as to the out
come of the game. In a statement is
sued yesterday he said:
"As a whole, the Stanford freshmen
are not as experienced this year as
they were last, although they have
made very rapid progress. I think that
a good many of them have more na
tural football sense, however, than
some of the experienced men who
played on the 1927 team. I don't
know just how powerful my team is,
as it has not been tested to any great
extent thus far. The freshmen have
weight and strength individually but
as a team, their strength is still un
certain.
"I have been working particularly,
in the past two weeks, to build up
teamwork. I am certain that my team
