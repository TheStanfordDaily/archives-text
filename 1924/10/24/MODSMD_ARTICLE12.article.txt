# VARSITY READY FOR GAME WITH VANDAL ELEVEN
## Cards Face Stiff Opposition at Portland in Second Conference Clash 
### David Meikle john 
Stanford's varsity football team
faces a hard problem tomorrow after
noon when it clashes with the Idaho
eleven on the sawdust Multnomah
field at Portland.
It is the second conference game of
the season for Stanford and a great
deal depends on whether the Cardinals,
meeting what is reported to be stiff
competition, can emerge once more
on the victory side of the ledger.
Team in Shape
A doctor in diagnosing a case could
not have gone more thoroughly over
his patient than did "Pop" Warner in
ironing out weak spots in the Stanford
defense last week. Warner is prepared,
not only for a driving, smashing at
tack, but also for complicated open
field tactics.
Stanford supporters spent an anxious
sixty minutes last year while the Card
inals defeated Idaho, 17 to 7. There
were times when passes came so dan
gerously close to being completed by
Idaho, that the respectable margin
amassed by Stanford failed to tell half
the story.
Card Defense Questionable
Coach Matthews of the Idaho squad
probably realizes the weakness of the
Redshirts in open field work. Certain
ly it is doubtful if the Vandals will
even threaten to score through the
Cardinal line.
The game tomorrow, above all
things, will give Warner a chance to
unleash his bag of tricks without the
possibility of a visiting scout from
U. S. C. taking home a carbon copy.
Stanford has played straight football
all season. None of the plays differ
materially from those seen on other
college elevens. Warner has played to
win. He will play tomorrow to win.
In this respect Stanford has re
mained more or less of a mystery. It
has power, both defensively and of
fensively. It has a strong ground-gain
ing back field, which until recently was
content to pile up yardage but not
scores.
Stanford alumni will be watching
with interest the performance of
"Pop" Warner's proteges. Undoubtedly
the alumni will expect a victory. Press
reports are far-reaching, especially
when concerning a prospective cham
pionship Stanford eleven.
At Berkeley the University of Cali
fornia is battling Washington State.
California has not been really tested
this year, and the Cougars are expec
tantly waiting to be the first ones to
chalk up a victory against the huffy
Bear.
Idaho is pointing to the Stanford
game with a similar end in view:
"Beat Stanford and the world is ours."
Evidently someone in Moscow has
spilled the beans.
