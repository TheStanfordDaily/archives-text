# VARSITY READY FOR GAME WITH VANDAL ELEVEN
## Cards Face Stiff Opposition at Portland in Second Conference Clash

Stanford's varsity football team
faces a hard problem tomorrow after
noon when it clashes with the Idaho
eleven on the sawdust Multnomah

Idaho, that the respectable margin
amassed by Stanford failed to tell half
the story.
Card Defense Questionable
Coach Matthews of the Idaho squad
probably realizes the weakness of the
Redshirts in open field work. Certain

even threaten to score through the
Cardinal line.

things, will give Warner a chance to
unleash his bag of tricks without the
possibility of a visiting scout from
U. S. C. taking home a carbon copy.
Stanford has played straight football
all season. None of the plays differ
materially from those seen on other
college elevens. Warner has played to
win. He will play tomorrow to win.
In this respect Stanford has re
mained more or less of a mystery. It
has power, both defensively and of
