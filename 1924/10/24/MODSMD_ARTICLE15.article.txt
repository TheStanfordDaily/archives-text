After a summer spent dallying with the volleys and wonders of Aus
tralia, Harry Maloney and the varsity tennis team are back on the campus,
leaving the Australians with the firmly rooted conviction that California
real estate is to some extent occupied by a University that produces ten
nis players.
To square things up, Stanford residents no longer have a hazy idea
of Australia as a place largely inhabited by crawl strokes and kangaroos.
They think of it now as a progressive nation thickly mottled with tennis
courts. California and Australia have increased respect for one another.
And thus all things are lovely.
An athletic team sent to a foreign country will do as much to promote
harmony and regard as a steamboat full of high-hat diplomats—provided
it is the right sort of a team. The diplomats might smother the upper
crust with such an output of oil that vigorous measures would be a physical
impossibility, but the team will penetrate to the sporting pages and thence
to public opinion. Stanford's tennis team was a vital and forcible proof of
-American l ightness, and doubtless many an Australian carried away that
impression the most lasting feature of his afternoon as a spectator of
high-class tennis.
To meet on common ground, and then to convince, is the essence of
international agreement and concord as well as any other harmony that
does, or should, exist. The Stanford men surpassed the Australians in
tennis and equaled them in sportsmanship. And Australia thought more
about, and of. the United States.
The "Daily" modestly ventures to put forth the suggestion that Ma
loney, Mertz, Overfelt, Hinckley, and Deßack be multiplied by the num
ber of universities in the United States and substituted for the League
of Nations.
