# Tribute from the Sky

This morning, three airplanes from the San Diego air base dropped
down ui)on the campus to pay a brief tribute to the services to aviation of
Professor Durand, emeritus. Four more were to follow.
Stanford truly realizes very little the contributions of her faculty to al
most every branch of advanced science and practical research. It was the
dream of her founders that such might be the case, and that Stanford
might be a power in the advancement as well as the imparting of knowledge.
Realization of the dream was postponed by the earthquake of 1906, with
subsequent financial problems, but at the present time it seems nearly here.
The "Daily" hopes, during the year, to be able to report rather fully on the
activities of these creative faculty members.
THE VARSITY is going to have its hands full tomorrow with its
first away-from-home game, and likewise its shoes full of sawdust. Last
year the northern alumni made so much noise that it seemed just like the
Stadium, and what man has done man can do.
THE FRESHMEN are likewise tackling tough stringy meat in the
persons of the Trojan babes. Go after 'em, '28, '29, '30, and so on.
MOB PSYCHOLOGYâ€”what a fool people are!
