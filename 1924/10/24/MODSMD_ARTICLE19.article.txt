j Cabbages, Sir:
I am eng#lfed m fury. My honor has
: been attacked. They say I have no
manners. Here 1 take the trouble to
; go to that dauce in my football cleats,
| just because last time I was there 1
fell down and the interference piled
up around me so bad that I blocked
. the whole play. When I got introduced
i to a dame named Miss Dobbin, all I
i
j said was: "My, she HAS a face like
a horse, hasn't she?" Real polite, see,
no swearing nor nothing. And just for
that they tell me that the dance was
a bust. Well, I'll show 'em; I won't
Igo to no more dances no more. I pre
i fer to walk on my own feet anyway.
JOE HOOF.

Cabbage Head, Person:
I am just a poor little girl, and never
meant nobody any harm. I am afraid
my gentleman friend is mad at me,
and I wish to explain myself through
| these columns. You see, I invited a
handsome big senior to the dance, a
man with the most vibrant personality.
He always wears his whiskers to a
dance, and I just love to scratch the
back of my neck on them while we're
dancing. It is the only time it ever
gets scratched. Well, when he came
I put my gum on the chair, and sat
down beside him. And now he's mad
because 1 stuck there all evening. Oh,
dear! MARY McCARTY.

I
j Mr. Cabbages:
Just a word. I danced with 27 girls.
: Every girl I danced with said: "Won't
; you have some punch?" I said: "I've
; had some punch." She said: "Oh, do
have some more punch." So I said:
j "All right." B. LEE ACHE.
