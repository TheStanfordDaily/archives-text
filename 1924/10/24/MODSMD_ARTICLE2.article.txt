# PRESIDENT LEADER IN STRAW BALLOTS DURING FIRST DAY
## 
### 
Coolidge 108, LaFollette 51, Davis
26, and Foster 1, are the results of the
first day's polling of the Daily Palo
Alto's straw ballot for President of the
United States. One hundred eighty-six
votes were cast in all.
Whether this is the true standing of
the candidates on the campus is a
matter for discussion. The known hos
tility of some of the LaFollette adher
ents to a straw ballot has been given
by some prophets as their reason for
predicting that LaFollette's strength
will be under-represented in the straw
ballot.
On the other hand it should be noted
that the results follow quite closely
the results of the Literary Digest poll
of the entire nation. Also it has been
pointed out that none of the political
organizations have made any con
certed effort to get out the votes and
perhaps the first day's poll would be
more illustrative than those following
when certain rivalry may develop.
Followers of the ballot have pre
dicted that Davis would run third, and
it has been commented that the one
reasonably sure conclusion that can
be drawn from the first day's results
is that the Democratic candidate is
not a first-place contender.
William Z. Foster is the communist
candidate, and his one vote indicates
some support on the Stanford campus.
Gilbert O. Nations, who is running on
the anti-Jewish, anti-Catholic ticket
found no adherents so far.
The balloting will continue for four
days.
The Daily reminds voters again that
the polling is conducted under the
honor system and that a person vot
ing once during the polls is morally
disqualified from further participation.
The effort is made to allow a true
guess at Stanford opinion, and the
whole plan depends upon the honor of
those voting.
