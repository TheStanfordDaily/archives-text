TO THE CLASS OK 28 and all
others to whom it may concern:
The posting on various parts of
the campus last night of warning
posters, and any other actions
which took place at that time on
the part of any members of the
sophomore class were entirely un
official and did not represent the
sentiment of the sophomore class.
We, the undersigned, wish it to
be known that no change has taken
place in the relations of the two
classes us expressed at the recent
smoker at which time the two
classes officially joined hands to
preserve Stanford traditions and
support Stanford ideals at all times.
