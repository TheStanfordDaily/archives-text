# CLASS GRID TEAMS CLASH TOMORROW
## 
### 
Interclass football will make its de
but as a 1924 sport at 10 o'clock to
morrow morning when the seniors mix
with the juniors on the freshman field
in what is expected to be a fiercely
contested if somewhat unscientific
game.
The freshman-sophomore contest
billed for the same time has been
postponed until Tuesday at 4 p.m. in
order to allow the first-year men to
keep a previously scheduled date with
the Alameda high school eleven.
There is not much to choose be
tween the seniors and the juniors, both
teams being out of condition and lack
ing in the smoothness of operation
which only long practic can give, but
both fired with the ambition to tear
one another to shreds. The shade, if
any, should go to the third-year men
on account of a slight advantage in
weight.
Seniors Play Punting Game
Dave Mannoccir, who is coaching
the juniors, will probably take advan
tage of the punting ability of Stock
bridge, his fullback, and rely largely
on a kicking game to carry his charges
through to a win. The seniors have no
man who can be depended on to boot
the pigskin for any distance consist
ently, and so will be at a disadvantage
in an exchange of punts.
They count, on the triple-threat pow
ers of "Nip" McHose and the speed
and shiftiness of the rest of the back
field to bring them out on top. "Oz"
