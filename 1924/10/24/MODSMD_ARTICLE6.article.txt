### 
"As a result of the Smyrna disaster,
one million and a half Greeks have
been driven from their homes in Asia
Minor," stated Professor H. R. Fair
clough, who is chairman of the United
Charity Drive.
"The Turks drove these people out
of their homes. Hungry, destitute, they
Hod to Greece —a terrific burden upon
a nation of less than five million.
Hundreds of thousands have already
died. Of the survivors, at least half a
million," he observed, "need our aid,
especially at the approach of winter.
Salonica Is Refugee Center
"Salonica, Greece (the The3salonika
of St. Paul's time), is today the great
est refugee centers in the history of
the world," said Fairclough. "Over
480,000> homeless people are now in
that area, according to figures gath
ered by the Near East Relief.
"Due to the exchange of populations,
this number will be swelled to 660,000
during the next two months by arrivals
from Turkey. Those in the most des
perate situation," he continud, "are
agricultural refugees who are still
confined in camps awaiting settlement
on the land.
"Many of these have passed two
winters under horrible conditions, and
with nothing but starving rations," he
explained. "About 37,000 are not cov
ered by relief organizations and ur
gently require food, clothing, and
medicine.
"The American Friends of Greece
■was organized in 1923 in response to
a definite and urgent need, when It
became known that the consequences
of the Smyrna disaster surpassed any
horror of the great war.
"Over one million people were sud
denly driven out of their homes in
Asia Minor by the Turks, and rushing
from the goading bayonets, and fires
of the burning cities —they fled to the
sea. Many of the fathers were killed
in the flight by the maddened Turks.
"The million women and children—
i mostly children — who were spared,
I huddled along the miles of beach,
hungry, freezing, until the Greek ships
transported them to Greece. About
300,000 children perished on the way
from cold, starvation, disease, and
fright.
"Money is urgently needed for emer
gency relief: food, clothing, and medi

j also a lack of funds for constructive
