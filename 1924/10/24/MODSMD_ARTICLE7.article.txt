# Song Contestants Must Turn in Yodels Sunday; Later Ones May Whistle
## 
### 
Sunday morning at 10 o'clock, in
stead of Monday evening, will be the
dead line on songs for the Rally com
mittee contest, in order that the
judges may weed out the winner and
turn his contribution over to the band
in time for adaptation. Songs must be
in the mail Saturday evening, or sub
mitted to Jean Ward at the Kappa
Kappa Gamma house by 10 o'clock
Sunday in order to be considered.
So far, eight promising yodels are
011 file and a number of dark horses
are expected to close in at the finish.
The judges are fully aware that the
bestowing of a ten-dollar prize is a
serious matter, and will take every
angle of the situation in making their
decision.
