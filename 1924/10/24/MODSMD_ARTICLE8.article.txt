# CARDINAL PADDLERS WILL SWIM TONIGHT FOR P. A. A. HONORS
## Swimmers Weakened in First Meet of Season with O'Conner Out 
### Al Post 
Weakened by the absence of Cap
tain Wally O'Connor, Stanford pad
dlers will compete for the Pacific Ath
letic Association championship tonight
and tomorrow in their first meet of
the season.
The Olympic Club pool will be the
scene of the contest.
The Cards will face the pick of coast
swimming talent, and will be forced
to extend themselves in every event
in order to beat out the Winged "O"
mermen, their closest rivals. The Uni
versity of California will enter a five
man team made up entirely of fresh
men, and the Idora and Neptune clubs
of Alameda will be represented. A
number of unattached swimmers have
also sent in entries.
Coach Ernie Brandsten is sending
up a twelve-man team composed large
ly of stars from last year's freshman
aggregation. In their meet with the
California yearlings last winter the
babes made a clean sweep of all first
places, trouncing their opponents 59
to 9. If they can come through in the
same style against stiffer competition
victory will be practically assured for
Stanford.
The Olympics are reputed to be
strong in the free style races while
the Cards are expected to score heav
ily in the breast and back stroke
events and in the diving; so the team
that annexes the greatest number of
seconds and thirds will in all proba
bility win the meet. If the Cards hold
their own in the races in which they
are best fortified, and dark horses
take a few unexpected points away
from the Post-streetere, Stanford has a
chance to pile up the largest total.
Lester Smith, Jack Robertson, "Gin
ger" Austin, and Frank Mooney are
the quartet upon whom Coach Frank
Rivas of the Olympics is pinning his
hopes in the free style swims. All
four are seasoned veterans of proved
ability.
Brandsten is counting on Arden
Allen, Phil Brooks, Carl Stevenson,
"Dutch" Fletcher, and Bob Williams
to surprise them. Allen swam on last
year's varsity, and has been the main
stay of the team sine O'Connor left.
The other four were 1927 freshman
performers.
Hanley, Schmeider in Breast Stroke
Either Schmeider or Hanley should
lead the field in the breast stroke.
Lederman, a transfer from California
who placed third in the yearling meet
last February, is a prospect for an
other point.
A1 White and Dave Fall look like
safe bets to place one-two in all three
diving events, with DeFei'ra.ri and
Carrol of the Winged "O" fighting it
out ofr third. Allen is doped to give
Lester Smith a battle in the back
stroke.
The Card entry list for both nights
follows:
Friday
100-yard free style—Williams.
220-yard free style—Allen.
220-yard breast stroke —Schmeider,
Hanley, Lederman, Kenney, Mack.

Letter men of the University of Ore
gon are to be given a distinctive em
blem which will guarantee them free
admission to all athletic contests par
ticipated in by Oregon. The emblem
will probably be a small bronze plate,
about the size of a calling card, with
the name of the bearer engraved on it.

Professor P. Sorokine, a new mem
ber of the sociology department of the
University of Minnesota, was formerly
at the University of Petrograd. He
was an active member in the first Rus
sian revolution.

British life was expressed in decora
tion and entertainment at a regular
Friday tea at the University of Cali
fornia. The Prince of Waleß, imper
sonated by a student, received the
guests.
Weakened by the absence of Cap
tain Wally O'Connor, Stanford pad
dlers will compete for the Pacific Ath
letic Association championship tonight
and tomorrow in their first meet of
the season.
The Olympic Club pool will be the
scene of the contest.
The Cards will face the pick of coast
swimming talent, and will be forced
to extend themselves in every event
in order to beat out the Winged "O"
mermen, their closest rivals. The Uni
versity of California will enter a five
man team made up entirely of fresh
men, and the Idora and Neptune clubs
of Alameda will be represented. A
number of unattached swimmers have
also sent in entries.
Coach Ernie Brandsten is sending
up a twelve-man team composed large
ly of stars from last year's freshman
aggregation. In their meet with the
California yearlings last winter the
babes made a clean sweep of all first
places, trouncing their opponents 59
to 9. If they can come through in the
same style against stiffer competition
victory will be practically assured for
Stanford.
The Olympics are reputed to be
strong in the free style races while
the Cards are expected to score heav
ily in the breast and back stroke
events and in the diving; so the team
that annexes the greatest number of
seconds and thirds will in all proba
bility win the meet. If the Cards hold
their own in the races in which they
are best fortified, and dark horses
take a few unexpected points away
from the Post-streetere, Stanford has a
chance to pile up the largest total.
Lester Smith, Jack Robertson, "Gin
ger" Austin, and Frank Mooney are
the quartet upon whom Coach Frank
Rivas of the Olympics is pinning his
hopes in the free style swims. All
four are seasoned veterans of proved
ability.
Brandsten is counting on Arden
Allen, Phil Brooks, Carl Stevenson,
"Dutch" Fletcher, and Bob Williams
to surprise them. Allen swam on last
year's varsity, and has been the main
stay of the team sine O'Connor left.
The other four were 1927 freshman
performers.
Hanley, Schmeider in Breast Stroke
Either Schmeider or Hanley should
lead the field in the breast stroke.
Lederman, a transfer from California
who placed third in the yearling meet
last February, is a prospect for an
other point.
A1 White and Dave Fall look like
safe bets to place one-two in all three

up a twelve-man team composed large
ly of stars from last year's freshman
aggregation. In their meet with the
California yearlings last winter the
babes made a clean sweep of all first
places, trouncing their opponents 59
to 9. If they can come through in the
same style against stiffer competition
victory will be practically assured for
Stanford.
The Olympics are reputed to be
strong in the free style races while
the Cards are expected to score heav
ily in the breast and back stroke
events and in the diving; so the team
that annexes the greatest number of
seconds and thirds will in all proba
bility win the meet. If the Cards hold
their own in the races in which they
are best fortified, and dark horses
take a few unexpected points away
from the Post-streetere, Stanford has a
chance to pile up the largest total.
Lester Smith, Jack Robertson, "Gin
ger" Austin, and Frank Mooney are
the quartet upon whom Coach Frank
Rivas of the Olympics is pinning his
hopes in the free style swims. All
four are seasoned veterans of proved
ability.
Brandsten is counting on Arden
Allen, Phil Brooks, Carl Stevenson,
"Dutch" Fletcher, and Bob Williams
to surprise them. Allen swam on last
year's varsity, and has been the main
stay of the team sine O'Connor left.
The other four were 1927 freshman
performers.
Hanley, Schmeider in Breast Stroke
Either Schmeider or Hanley should
lead the field in the breast stroke.
Lederman, a transfer from California
who placed third in the yearling meet
last February, is a prospect for an
other point.
A1 White and Dave Fall look like
safe bets to place one-two in all three
diving events, with DeFei'ra.ri and
Carrol of the Winged "O" fighting it
out ofr third. Allen is doped to give
Lester Smith a battle in the back
stroke.

Letter men of the University of Ore

will probably be a small bronze plate,
about the size of a calling card, with
the name of the bearer engraved on it.
