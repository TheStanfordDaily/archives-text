A DISTINCTLY new tendeifcy is apparent in architectural
thought and design today. Architects are designing in
masses — the great silhouette, the profile of the building has
become of far greater importance than its detail.
There is a new vigor and ruggedness even in buildings which are conven
tionally classic in their detail. Masses mount upward, supporting the tower,
accentuating its height. The new architecture is tending toward great struc
tures raiher than multiplicity of detail.
Certainly modern invention—modern engineering skill and organization,
will prove more than equal to the demands of the architecture of the future.
