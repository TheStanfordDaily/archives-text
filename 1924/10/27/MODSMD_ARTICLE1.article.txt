# CARDINAL BABES LOSE 10 U. S. C. BY 10-0 SCORE
## Elliot, Drury, Score Points for Trojans; Stanford Never Threatens 
### Douglas Meservey 
Cardinal freshmen bravely attempted
to get over the first "hump" in the road
to the "Little Big Game" Saturday, -bul
failed—lo to 0. The Trojan yearlings
constituted the "hump" and proved to lx
as stiff an opposition as any eleven
could wish.
"Husky's" men were undoubtedly out
played, with the exception of the punting
department, but certainly not more than
the score indicates. It wasn't often that
the southern backfield could gain through
the Card line and when they did, the
gain was a matter of only a few yards.
Coach Dolley's principal advantage lay
in the ability of Elliot, fullback, to cir
cle the Card end for several long gains
that added to the Trojan yardage.
Elliot Scores
It was one of these runs, following
immeditaely upon an effective pass, that
scored the only touchdown. Williams
had just passed to Jones, left tackle, near
the end of the first quarter, for a 28-
yard advance, putting the southerners
on Stanford's 25-yard line. Small gains
had been made up to that time by the
Trojan backs and the quarter had seen
an exchange of punts, with Hoffman of
Stanford leading Elliot by ten yards in
the dual battle. Elliot was chosen to
go off-tackle on a play that should have
stopped with a few yards gain. He
slipped through the arms of two Cards
and scooted diagonally across the field
to the goal line with Stanford's sec
ondary defense streaming after him. He
alsq„converted.
The Trojan's final points, a place-kick
by Drury, came in the fourth period after
Orsatti, safety-man and quarter for
TJ. S. C., had advanced the ball 20 yards
