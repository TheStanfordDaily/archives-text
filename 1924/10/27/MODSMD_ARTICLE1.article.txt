# CARDINAL BABES LOSE 10 U. S. C. BY 10-0 SCORE
## Elliot, Drury, Score Points for Trojans; Stanford Never Threatens 
### Douglas Meservey 
Cardinal freshmen bravely attempted
to get over the first "hump" in the road
to the "Little Big Game" Saturday, -bul
failed—lo to 0. The Trojan yearlings
constituted the "hump" and proved to lx
as stiff an opposition as any eleven
could wish.
"Husky's" men were undoubtedly out
played, with the exception of the punting
department, but certainly not more than
the score indicates. It wasn't often that
the southern backfield could gain through
the Card line and when they did, the
gain was a matter of only a few yards.
Coach Dolley's principal advantage lay
in the ability of Elliot, fullback, to cir
cle the Card end for several long gains
that added to the Trojan yardage.
Elliot Scores
It was one of these runs, following
immeditaely upon an effective pass, that
scored the only touchdown. Williams
had just passed to Jones, left tackle, near
the end of the first quarter, for a 28-
yard advance, putting the southerners
on Stanford's 25-yard line. Small gains
had been made up to that time by the
Trojan backs and the quarter had seen
an exchange of punts, with Hoffman of
Stanford leading Elliot by ten yards in
the dual battle. Elliot was chosen to
go off-tackle on a play that should have
stopped with a few yards gain. He
slipped through the arms of two Cards
and scooted diagonally across the field
to the goal line with Stanford's sec
ondary defense streaming after him. He
alsq„converted.
The Trojan's final points, a place-kick
by Drury, came in the fourth period after
Orsatti, safety-man and quarter for
TJ. S. C., had advanced the ball 20 yards
to Stanford's 17-yard line. It was fourth
down and Drury took his position behind
the line for the kick. It was found,
however, that both lines had been offside
and tiie ball was brought again into play.
But Drury's toe was just as effective fhe
second time, and the score read 10 to 0.
Passes Used
Hoping to gain with an aerial attack,
Murphy, Card quarterback, broke loose
with a number of passes in the fourth
quarter, but only three were good for
small gains. A lateral pass to Dorcy,
attempted three times during the game,
failed because he was not fast enough
to circle the opposing ends.
Yardage figures give 190 yards gained
by U. S. C. and 141 for Stanford, al
though it looked to the" average spectator
as though the two offensives were about
equal. Dorcy, left half, ligured often
and prominently in the Stanford gains.
Hoffman, substituting for Millage,
played a good game. "Biff" surprised
everyone by putting his kicks out for 45
and 50 yards consistently.
Alameda Wins
Saturday morning Alameda High
School defeated the freshman light
weights, 13 to 8, in a loosely-played but
none-the-less exciting game. The score
at the end of the half stood 8 to 6, the
babes leading until near the end of the
fourth quarter, when Von Tagen of Ala
meda intercepted a yearling pass and ran
90 yards for a touchdown and victory.

Cardinal freshmen bravely attempted
to get over the first "hump" in the road
to the "Little Big Game" Saturday, -bul
failed—lo to 0. The Trojan yearlings
constituted the "hump" and proved to lx
as stiff an opposition as any eleven
could wish.
"Husky's" men were undoubtedly out
played, with the exception of the punting
department, but certainly not more than
the score indicates. It wasn't often that
the southern backfield could gain through
the Card line and when they did, the
gain was a matter of only a few yards.
Coach Dolley's principal advantage lay
in the ability of Elliot, fullback, to cir
cle the Card end for several long gains
that added to the Trojan yardage.
Elliot Scores
It was one of these runs, following
immeditaely upon an effective pass, that
scored the only touchdown. Williams
had just passed to Jones, left tackle, near
the end of the first quarter, for a 28-
yard advance, putting the southerners
on Stanford's 25-yard line. Small gains
had been made up to that time by the
Trojan backs and the quarter had seen
an exchange of punts, with Hoffman of
Stanford leading Elliot by ten yards in
the dual battle. Elliot was chosen to
go off-tackle on a play that should have
stopped with a few yards gain. He
slipped through the arms of two Cards
and scooted diagonally across the field
to the goal line with Stanford's sec
ondary defense streaming after him. He
alsq„converted.
The Trojan's final points, a place-kick
by Drury, came in the fourth period after
Orsatti, safety-man and quarter for
TJ. S. C., had advanced the ball 20 yards
to Stanford's 17-yard line. It was fourth
down and Drury took his position behind
the line for the kick. It was found,
however, that both lines had been offside
and tiie ball was brought again into play.
But Drury's toe was just as effective fhe
second time, and the score read 10 to 0.
Passes Used
Hoping to gain with an aerial attack,
Murphy, Card quarterback, broke loose
with a number of passes in the fourth
quarter, but only three were good for
small gains. A lateral pass to Dorcy,
attempted three times during the game,
failed because he was not fast enough
to circle the opposing ends.
Yardage figures give 190 yards gained
by U. S. C. and 141 for Stanford, al
though it looked to the" average spectator
as though the two offensives were about
equal. Dorcy, left half, ligured often
and prominently in the Stanford gains.
Hoffman, substituting for Millage,
