"Aid for Greek refugees is necessary
as a result of the Smyrna disaster,
when the Turks drove one million and
a half Christians from their homes in
Asia Minor," Professor H. It. Fair
clough, who is in charge of the drive
to secure this aid, said yesterday.
"Half a million survivors are desti
tute. The story of the Asia Minor refu
gees has been told too often to need J
much repetition. The horror of the
situation brought it immediately be
fore the public eye. Greece was the ,
only country that would take them in;
so it was into Greece these homeless
people fled. They are a terrible burden
upon a nation of less than five million.
"Competent American observers de
clare that the plight of these survivors
chiefly women and children, will be! •
worse during the coming winter than
ever before. Their vitality has be'en ,
lowered greatly by the hardships al
ready endured, and by the ravages of ;
malaria and other diseases.
"They must have help. These people i
must be cared for until they can care ,
for themselves. They must have food,
clothing, medicine. They must have; i
constructive aid to enable them to sup-
port themselves. With generous aid ]
from America a people can bo saved; j]
without American help further thou i
sands must die." j (
