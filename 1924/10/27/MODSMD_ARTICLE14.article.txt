The varsity squad arrived in Palo Alto at 11 o'clock this morning.

A FUMBLE 011 the Stanford one-foot line bv Bucklin, Idaho fullback, coat
the \ andal eleven a victory and gave Cuddeback an opportunity, two
periods later, to score a place kick for the only three Stanford points
of the game on the rain-soaked Multnomah field at Portland last Saturday.
Both teams fougnt desperately on the slippery field, and tried unheard-of
tactics in order to get the upper hand. Idaho time and again threatened the
Stanford goal" line only to lose the advantage gained- 011 a fumble or through
the stiffened resistance of the Cardinal defense.

22 yard line.
Stanford lost a yard in three scrim
