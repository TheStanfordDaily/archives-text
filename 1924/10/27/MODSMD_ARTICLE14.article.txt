## Bucklin, Vandal Full-Back, Fumbles On Card One Foot Line, Losing Best Chance To Score 
### David Meiklejohn 
The varsity squad arrived in Palo Alto at 11 o'clock this morning.

A FUMBLE 011 the Stanford one-foot line bv Bucklin, Idaho fullback, coat
the \ andal eleven a victory and gave Cuddeback an opportunity, two
periods later, to score a place kick for the only three Stanford points
of the game on the rain-soaked Multnomah field at Portland last Saturday.
Both teams fougnt desperately on the slippery field, and tried unheard-of
tactics in order to get the upper hand. Idaho time and again threatened the
Stanford goal" line only to lose the advantage gained- 011 a fumble or through
the stiffened resistance of the Cardinal defense.
Stanford took advantage of a break early in the fourth Quarter, when
Johnston block Stivers* punt, and Hey recovered on the Idaho 26-yard line.

• It was Stanford's first down. Cudde
j back made tour yards. Hey went .two
yards. Cleavelaud carried the ball live
yards for first down.
Vandals Hold
With the ball on the Idaho 16-yard
line the Vandal defense stiffened,
i Three downs failed to net the Cardi
-1 nals yardage, and Cuddeback dropped
back on the 17-yard line for a place
kick. It was perfect, and put the Cards
in the lead when everything indicated
a scoreless contest.
Stanford tried a similar play from
the 35-yard line, but failed. Stivers
kicked from the Idaho three-yard line
and Cuddeback returned to the Idaho
22 yard line.
Stanford lost a yard in three scrim
| mages and again Cuddeback tried a
place kick. Stivers intercepted the ball
and ran to his own 12-yard line. An in
complete Idaho pass ended the game.
The Cardinals played the Idaho open
game from the start after failing to
gain by straight football. In this de
partment the Vandals had the advan
! tage, and long passes and kicks by
Stivers kept the ball in Idaho terri
tory for the better part of the contest.
Intercepted passes and fumbles were
! costly to both teams. Stivers repeated
ly kicked the ball to Cuddeback who
played at safety for Stanford.
Idaho threatened to score in the
' first quarter when a 47-yard forward
pass from Stivers to Cameron put the
ball on Stanford's 18-yard line. The
Card defense tightened, however, and
Stivers attempted a place kick. Cudde
back taught the short kick and
brought the ball back to the center of
the field.
The rain-soaked field made going
hard for the Cardinal line buekers.
13ogue found it impossible to gain on
the usually successful reverse play,
but he got off several limes for long
i gains through tackles. Bogue was in
jured in the third quarter and was sub
j stituted by Hey.
It was a narrow squeak, and it was
not the superior playing of Stanford
which earned the victory. Idaho's
j lighter team had an obvious advan
tage using the open field tactics and
the Stanford eleven spent most of the
j game attempting to keep the Vandals
I from getting too close to scoring dis
tance.

Princeton rooters were treated to a
thrill at the Princeton-Leliigh gamp
recently. William Millard, the yell
leader, became so vigorous in direct-!
ing the singing that he threw his right
; arm out of joint.

The Cardinals played the Idaho open
game from the start after failing to
gain by straight football. In this de

Stivers kept the ball in Idaho terri

Intercepted passes and fumbles were

ly kicked the ball to Cuddeback who
played at safety for Stanford.
Idaho threatened to score in the
' first quarter when a 47-yard forward
pass from Stivers to Cameron put the
ball on Stanford's 18-yard line. The
Card defense tightened, however, and
Stivers attempted a place kick. Cudde

brought the ball back to the center of

It was a narrow squeak, and it was
not the superior playing of Stanford
which earned the victory. Idaho's

the Stanford eleven spent most of the
j game attempting to keep the Vandals
I from getting too close to scoring dis

periods later, to score a place kick for the only three Stanford points
of the game on the rain-soaked Multnomah field at Portland last Saturday.
Both teams fougnt desperately on the slippery field, and tried unheard-of
tactics in order to get the upper hand. Idaho time and again threatened the
Stanford goal" line only to lose the advantage gained- 011 a fumble or through
the stiffened resistance of the Cardinal defense.
Stanford took advantage of a break early in the fourth Quarter, when
Johnston block Stivers* punt, and Hey recovered on the Idaho 26-yard line.

back on the 17-yard line for a place
kick. It was perfect, and put the Cards
in the lead when everything indicated
a scoreless contest.

kicked from the Idaho three-yard line
and Cuddeback returned to the Idaho
