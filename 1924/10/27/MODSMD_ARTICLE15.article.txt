## Professor C. B. Whittier Will Discuss Experiences of Egyptian Visit 
### 
"High Lights in a Year of Travel"
is the title chosen by Professor Clarke
13. Whittier, of the Law School, for
i his lecture at 7:30 tomorrow night in
the Little Theatre.
During the past college year Profes
; *or and Mrs. Whittier were absent on
sabbatical leave. They used the op
portunity to make an extended trip
| through Europe and the Eastern Medi
terranean countries, and it is concern
ing their personal experiences that he
; will speak.
"We spent about a month in Egypt,"
j he said. "It was the finest time of the
! year, January, when.the weather along
j the Nile is much like our October
weather at Stanford. We traveled
j about 1200 miles on the river in one
of the tourist steamers.
Steamers Similar to River Boats
"These steamers are much like the
passenger boats on the Sacramento
| river," he explained, "except the ser
vants are all dark-skinned Arabs in
(lowing white robes, who remind you
of the shieks in our movies.
"The little steamer carries about
sixty persons, and pulls in to the bank
whenever a temple, a pyramid, or a
I tomb is to be visited. The whole party
disembarks and descends to the backs
of the ever-patient donkeys, the beasts
of burden in the Egyptian desert.
Wealthy Ride in Sand Cars
"The wealthy may ride in sand cars,
small two-wheeled carts with broad
tires, drawn by horses or mules. When
the cars were not available, chairs,
each mounted on two poles and car
ried by four men, were provided for
the rich and ailing. Sometimes it is
five miles to the points of interest,
and these are the best means of trans
portation.
"The tombs of the Egyptian kings
were at the end of a long trip. They
are cut in the solid rock, and have
been there for 3500 years. A belief in
immortality is shown," he observed,
"and also the fact that the Egyptians
had laste and ingenuity."

"and also the fact that the Egyptians
had laste and ingenuity."
