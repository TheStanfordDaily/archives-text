# The
						Straw Vote
## 
### 
Three hundred and thirty-three students-and faculty members have
signified that they have opinions, through the agency of the Daily's i
straw vote.
This figures down to a turn-out of approximately eleven per cent of j
the eligible populace—any member of the populace being eligible.
Although voting restrictions prohibit the vast majority of students!
from actually casting a Presidential ballot, it seems highly probable that
more than eleven per cent must have a preference one way or another
so far as the next executive is concerned. The Daily is conducting thisj
vote with the idea of bringing out those student opinions, and also the'
hope of discovering, to some extent, just how much interest is lavished
upon national affairs. •
Three straw voters are zealous adherents "of Andy Gump. Well—i
anyhow, these three voted, and probably for the candidate best known
to them. Which is, according to the terms of the enterprise, preciselv
that!
