The washing out of the illicit "To Hell with '27" sign at the Law Steps |
this morning was a pretty good display of spirit by all concerned. The!
only justifiable kick would be from the Comptroller's office, on the grounds !
of unusual wear and tear on the pavement. The nameless gents who per- j
petrated the high-schoolish triumph arc by no means endowed with flawless !
judgment, but at they gave freshmen and older residents an opportu- 1
nity to get together in a friendly, though rigorous, movement for the im
provement of the campus.

THIS QUARTER'S charity drive opens today. For once the "al
mighty dollar" may become almighty indeed, if applied to such causes
as these.
