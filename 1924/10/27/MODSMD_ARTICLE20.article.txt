# GRAYS OVERWHELM FORT SCOTT TEAM IN LOPSIDED GAME
## 
### 
Stanford's reserves took a light
work-out against the Fort Scott eleven
Saturday when they turned in a de-;
cisive 40 to 0 victory over the soldiers
in the preliminary to the Stanford-
U. S. C. freshman -contest.
Hal Davis' Grays scored their first
touchdown a few plays after the kick
oft', and before the first quarter was
over had piled up a 27 to 0 lead. Fum-1
hies by Fort Scott under her own goal I
posts accounted for two of the four
scores in the initial quarter. Stanford
failed to score in the second quarter,
but crossed the final line twice more
in the final half.
The Grays worked well together, but
were not pressed to defeat the weaker
team from Fort Scott.
The visitors showed little team work

and seemed unable to hang onto the;
ball. They had possession of the oval
in Stanford's territory but once-during|
the entire game. This was in the j
fourth quarter after a Cardinal back
fumbled on the Stanford 20-yard line, I
and recovered on the 5-yard line. Stan
ford punted, tlie ball went straight up
in the air, and went out of bounds on !
the 5-yard line. II was Fort Scott's
ball with four downs to make five i
yards and a touchdown. On the next
play the Fort Scott eleven lost its
chance to score when a pass over the
goal line failed.

Footballs are not made of pigskin. |
as many people and some sport writers |
believe, says Julian W. Curtis of New
York, veteran sports authority. They ;
are made of cowhide. When he was j
playing the game, they got pig blad
ders from the butcher, put quills in
them, inflated them, and tied them up
with strings.
