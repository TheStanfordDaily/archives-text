# CALVIN COOLIDGE RETAINS LEAD IN DAILY BALLOTING
## 
### 
Of the three hundred thirty-three
votes cast in the Daily Palo Alto straw
vote up to last night, Coolidge and
Dawes had received 204, LaFollette f
and Wheeler 81, Davis and Bryan 47,
with William Z. Foster, the commun
ist candidate, rating but one vote.
Of the winning votes cast yesterday,
Encina furnished a large number, ac
cording to the addresses as written on
the ballots. Roble was second, and the
row and the Palo Alto commuters
were about tied for third. Several fac- 1
ulty votes were in the list, and sev-;
eral votes were scattered among the
remaining dormitories.
The Davis scores came largely from
the row and Encina, in the order men
tioned. There were a few from Toyon
and some from faculty ballots. The
LaFollette strength was in Encina,
Sequoia, and the Union.
