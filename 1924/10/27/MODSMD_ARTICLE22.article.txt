### 
"Sonata in D minor" by Felix Men
delssohn-Bartholdy will be the first
number at the recital by Warren D.
Allen, University organist, in the Me
morial Church at 4:15 tomorrow after
noon.
The last of Mendelssohn's great or
gan sonatas Is based, in the first two
movements, on the old German Chor-,
ale, "Vater unser" —"Our Father, Thou
Who Art in Heaven." The slow finale
is an unusual contrast to the more
brilliant music usually written for!
sonata endings, and gives the impres
sion of a spiritual benediction.
"In the Steppes of Central Asia"
was written by Alexander Borodin. He
achieved fame in both science and
music, holding the chair of chemistry
in the Academy of Medicine at Petro
grad. He was a great traveler, and
his erudition in matters concerning
the Far East is evidenced in this or
chestral work, which was arranged by
Allen. "Litany" ("Rest in Peace All
Souls Departed") written by Franz!
Schubert, was also arranged by the
University organist.
The last number will be "Song of
Gratitude" by Rossetter G. Cole, one!
of America's most gifted composers j
for the organ.

Cornell University has only 19 more
students this year than last, and the
freshman class is 99 less than last
year's enrollment. A total of 4932 had
registered last week. The small num
ber registering in the freshman class
is somewhat due to the changed en
trance requirements, which have been
made stricter in order to keep the
classes small enough to be handled
conveniently.
