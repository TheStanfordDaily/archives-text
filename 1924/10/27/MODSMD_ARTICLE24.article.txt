# JUNIOR GRID TEAM HOLDS 1925 SQUAD TO SCORELESS TIE
## 
### 
With neither team able to advance
the ball effectively when within scor
ing distance, the juniors and seniors
battled to a scoreless tie Saturday
morning in the first of the interclass
football series.
The nearest approach to a score
made by either team came late in the
fourth quarter when a senior pass was
intercepted in midfield and run back
to the ten-yard line. Three line smash
es put the ball within three yards of
the final chalk mark and Randolph
.dropped back to kick. Here a wild
pass from center, which went clear
over the kicker's head, robbed the
juniors of their only chance to take
the game.
Luck, which smiled on the seniors
at this time, had already cheated them
of a field goal earlier in the game. In
the second period after they had twice
failed to put the ball across from short
distances a blocked punt gave the ball
to the '25 team on their rivals' fifteen
yard line. Attempts to advance from
the ball hit the crossbar and fell back
on the field.
Seniors Heavier Â»
Aside from these occasions neither
team had much success on the offense.
Aided by their beefy line the seniors
were able to make a number of first
downs in the middle of the field but
their forward passing game which was
constantly used when the ball was in
scoring position was a dismal failure.
It was the exact reverse with the
juniors. Their aerial game gained con
sistently but attempts at rushing the
ball were smothered by the seniors
with montonous regularity. Both
elevens showed lack of practice, fum
bles and other misplays being scat
tered throughout the contest.
Morgan in the backfield and Briggs
on tlie line were the bright stars for
the junio?s. McHose and Kennedy did
most- of thp heavy work in the senior
offense while Fullerton and Blaine
were continually breaking up plays.
The second game of the interclass
series will be played Tuesday when
the freshmen and sophomores clash.
The game was originally scheduled j
for Saturday but was postponed be
cause of the first year men's game'
with Alameda.
