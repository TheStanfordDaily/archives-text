# BABE HOCKEY SQUAD EXHIBITS GOOD FORM
## 
### 
The freshman hockey squad this
year shows unusual promise for a
first year team, according to Miss
Helen Masters Bunting, freshman
hockey coach.
Although the squad has had only a
few practices its members have shown
good, speedy playing. A number of
good individual players have come to
light. No positions have definitely been
assigned for practices yet, since but
ten freshmen have played before, and
Miss Bunting is trying them out at
various positions.
Miss Bunting expects to work up a
fast team and promises to give the
sophomores good competition. Second
teams will be put on the field by both
the freshmen and sophomores, be
cause of the large squads practicing.
