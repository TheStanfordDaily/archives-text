yearly expenses this year as in pre
vious years. However, the percentage
of students registered at the Appoint

decreased, according to incomplete re
ports; for five hundred students have
yet to be heard from.
Nine hundred and eighty-three stu
dents have asked the appointment of
fice for work and two hundred and
three books have been loaned to self
supporting students this year.
At the beginning of the quarter
there were sixty-two students regis

keep them for the rest of the year.
Some of the unusual jobs obtained
for students are: pallbearers, short

agents, printers, morning milk route,
carpenters, second-hand automobile
salesmen, and selling potatoes.
