# Mrs. Greta Brandsten to Give Courses in Swimming
## 
### 
Mrs. Greta J. Brandsten is offering j
courses in diving and advanced, swim- 1
ming again this fall at Roble gymna
sium.
Mrs. Brandsten, who had been in
charge of the swimming at Roble gym-j
nasium for eight years, resigned at
the end of last spring quarter in order ;
to devote all of her time to the Sears- j
ville camp.
An unexpectedly large enrollment
in the gymnastic courses necessitated
a larger staff in the department, and ;
Mrs. Brandsten was prevailed upon to
return to take charge of some of the ;
swimming courses.
