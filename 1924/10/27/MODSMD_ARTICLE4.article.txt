# Frosh Do Monday Wash; Red Letter Day On Law Steps
## 
### 
Rebellion, confusion and disaster
reigned on the Law Steps today with the
discovery of "To Hell With '27" painted
in red letti i. n the sacred meeting place
of Stanford's barristers. Twenty-odd
fresl unen were pressed into service and
forced to scrub the letters with their
dinks, and furnish impromptu amusement
of the pre-Irwin type to a howling
throng of slave-drivers.
The president of Encina hall, L. E.
McGonigle, states that he knew nothing
of the flagrant breach of discipline until
he saw the crowd congregated.
j "There are several cliques in the hall,
one of which may be responsible. The
act is entirely unofficial, and done with
; out my knowledge," he said.
Dean Culver, when interviewed shortly
j after the discovery of the sacreligious j
act, speaking from the point of view of
Stanford traditions, refused to make a 1
statement regarding his opinion of the
affair.
