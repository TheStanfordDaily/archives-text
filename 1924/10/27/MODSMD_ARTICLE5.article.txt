# Song Contest Judges In Deadlock; Winner May Be Selected Today
## 
### 
After long hours of warbling over the
fourteen songs entered in the U. S. C.
game song contest, the foreman an
nounced a hung jury at the meeting to
decide a winner which was held last
night.
Another siege of deliberation is
planned for today and the judges will
stay locked up until a decision is reached.
Nine of the songs have original music,
and of these the choice has been nar
rowed to four. The ones still hold
ing up the judges are of better than the
average merit and any one of them prom
ises to be worth singing at future Trojan
games.
