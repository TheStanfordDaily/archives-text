Putting up a hard fight against more
| experienced competition, Stanford swim
mers placed second in the Pacific Ath
: letic Association aquatic championships
held Friday and Saturday nights in the
I Olympic Club pool.
The Winged "O" copped the meet by
a comfortable margin, due to its large
number of veteran performers. The
Olympics had nearly twice as many en
tries as the Cards. The California pad
i dlers were unable to break into the point
: column.
Club totals were as follows: Olympic
Club, 46; Stanford, 23; Alameda Nep
tune club, 2; Stockton Neptune club, 5;
I Idora club, 0; University of California, 0.
Arden Allen came through in splendid
t style for Stanford, winning the 200-yard
medley race, placing second in the back
stroke, third in the 220-vard free-style,
and swimming on the relay team which
I pressed the Post-streeters for first
| honors.
Mooney Breaks Record
Mooney of the Olympic Club estab
lished an association record in the 220-
yard free-style when he nosed out Smith
in one of the most exciting races of the
meet, negotiating the distance in 2:25,
one second under the old time.
Stauford scored heaviest in the breast
stroke, the medley swim, and the dive.
Sclmti'jder uncorked a sprint in the last
lap of the breast-stroke which nearly
gave him a win over Littlefield of the
; Stockton Neptunes. Hanley of last year's
freshman team finished third.
In the medley event, consisting of two
laps fach of breast-stroke, back-stroke,
! and crawl, Allen proved his versatility
by walking away with the victory,
i "Dutch" Fletcher, who is swimming in
his iirht year on the vars'ty, annexed
, second place.
White Wins Dive Easily
A1 White had an easy time running
up in the diving, but Dave Fall was
caught on off night and had to content
himself with a fourth. Two Winged "O"
j athletes, Patterson and Carroll, placed
second and third.
