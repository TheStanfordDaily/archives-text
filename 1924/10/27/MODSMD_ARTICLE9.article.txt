# CHARITY DRIVES START ON CAMPUS TODAY AID ASKED FOR DISTRESSED OF 3 NATIONS
## Russians in Constantinople Starving Because Turks Will Not Give Them Work 
### 
Seven thousand refugees from Rus- \
sian Bolshevism, forming a eity the
size of Palo Alto, are still in Con
stantinople. They are unable to pro
tect themselves from starvation be
cause Turkey forbids the employment (
of foreigners.
"This desperate situation was
brought about by two factors," Mrs.
Burt Est.es Howard, chairman of the
Russian Relief, said yesterday, "one.
the disbanding of the famous White
Army in and around that, city, and the
other the recent anti-alien attitude
adopted by the Turks, which has re
sulted in the inability of the refugees
to secure any kind of work.
"Under the influence of his 'victory'
the Turk has become very conscious
of his nationality and is forming him
self into what amounts to a closed
corporation.
"The aim of the relief workers is to
get these refugees evacuated to some
place where their talents may be used.!
The League of Nations sets up thej
machinery for securing permits to
enter France. The League also ar
ranges for passage at a very low rate, j
but it cannot furnish the money to
pay for it. It costs but $15 to send a
man who faces death to a place that'
offers life and work and hope."
