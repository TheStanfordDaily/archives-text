## Professor Clarke Whittier to Speak of Personal Observations 
### 
Professor Clarke B. Whittier, of the
Law School, will give a lecture on
"High Lights in a Year of Travel," at

"When Mrs. Whittier and I were in
Palestine we had the good fortune to
have for a chauffeur the very Indian,
from India, not America, that served
in the same capacity for General Al
lenby, who captured Jerusalem," he
explained.
"We spent a night in Smyrna. It
was burned when the Turks captured
the city during the recent Greco-Turk
ish war, and the remains were of un
usual interest.
"The characteristics of the people
in the different countries were worthy
of comparison. In my lecture I will try
to give my impressions of the various
nations, whether the English are cold,
the French immoral, the Italians klep
tomaniacs, and the Turks hideously
cruel.
"We also observed conditions in the
war zone. We got the intimate view
of the French country that only a car,
a bicycle, or a walking trip can give."
