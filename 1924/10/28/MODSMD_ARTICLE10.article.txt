"Contributions to the United Cam
paign may be given to the representa
tives of the various living groups, or
left at the Stanford Bookstore," said
Professor H. R. Fairclough, who is
chairman of the drive committee.
"The Stanford in China movement
is sponsored by the Y. M. C. A., and
while it does not make its appeal to
the women of the University, who
have their Y. W. drive next quarter,
it is worthy of the consideration of j
every Stanford man. It is an oppor
tunity for American students, who j
have every chance, to help the stu
dents of China in building a stable i
republic.
Refugees Number Seven Thousand
"Refugees from Russian Bolshevism,
still in Constantinople number seven;
thousand. They are unable to protect
themselves from starvation because
Turkey forbids employment of for
eigners. France is willing to give them
work, and the League of Nations has
set up the machinery for securing
labor and permits for them to enter
France, but it does not furnish the
money to pay for transportation. It
costs but $15 to send a refugee and
save him from certain death.
"The million and a half Christians
who have been driven from their
homes in Asia Minor by the Turks, as
a result of the Smyrna disaster, have
fled to Greece. These destitute people
are a terrific burden upon a small
nation of less than five million. Hun
dreds of thousands have already died, i
Of the survivors, at least half a mil
lion, mostly women and children, need
aid, especially during the winter.
"Money is urgently needed for emer-j
gency relief, which consists of food, j
clothing, and medicine. Provision is j
also desired for constructive relief for
the establishment of workshops in;
Greece, for the encouragement of the;
native handicrafts, the products or
which will be sold in the United;
States."
