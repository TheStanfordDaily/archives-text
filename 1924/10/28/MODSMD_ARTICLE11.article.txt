# CUBBERLEY PREDICTS REVOLUTION OF HIGH SCHOOL CURRICULUM
## 
### 
"The change in the present high
school from that of thirty or thirty-;
five years ago is greater than that 1
which the application of science has
made in the life of the country, but :
the change in the next twenty-five;
years will be as great."
-
This was the statement made by Dr. j
E. P. Cubberley, dean of the School
of Education, last night in a talk
given before the Education Club.
"The high school of today has taken
over many of the functions of the col
lege of yesterday," he went on to
state. "History, mathematics, and
literature courses used to be confined
almost solely to the college, while
today courses are given in all of them
in the high school."
Professor Cubberley gave his ideas j
of the trend which education in-the I
future would take. He believes that
the divisions into schools will be much
different, enabling the student at j
about 20 years of age to complete the
work now covered by an average col-1
lege education.
The curriculum, lie thinks, will be
as much changed as the rest of the!
system. All students will have to take
in their high school training six basic
subjects: English, its use in speaking,
reading and writing; social sciences,
knowledge of conditions and ability to
think that will insure intelligent vot-,
ing; courses in applied sciences and
hygiene; practical arts, teaching the;
ability to do small things without the
aid of the specialist; arts of the home, j
teaching all about the scientific up-;
keep of a house; and courses in ap-i
preciation of music and art.
