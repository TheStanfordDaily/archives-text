# Talmadge Sisters Will Witness Stanford Game At U. S. C. November 8
## 
### 
Additional reports from Southern
California of the work of Stanford
alumni in preparing for the U. S. C.
game brought the news to the campus
today that Norma and Constance Tal- J
madge, Hollywood movie queens,
would sit on the Stanford side of the
Coliseum. Reservations for seats for
the two satellites were made by John
Considine, former Stanford student.
Whether it is Norma and Constance
who are true Cardinal supporters, or
merely their press-agent, had not been
determined up to a late hour today.
