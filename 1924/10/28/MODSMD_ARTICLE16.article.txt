one of the oldest institutions in his-;
tory, according to R. E. McDonnell, '97,'

Reynolds' water-supply class in the
Little Theatre yesterday afternoon.
"There is evidence of the construc
tion of reservoirs as early as the sec- j
ond and third centuries before the
Christian era," Mr. McDonnell de
clared. "From that time until the pres
ent, they have been one of tho most
important factors of health protection,
besides constituting one of the most
valuable insurance assets for the mod
ern city."
Mr. McDonnell, who is senior mem
ber of the firm of Burns and McDon
nell, consulting engineers of Kansas

his graduation here, in the construc
tion of water and sewer systems. In
