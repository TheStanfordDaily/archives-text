# STANFORD VARSITY MAKES READY FOR BRONCO GRIDDERS
## Cards Show Mid-Season Form Against Vandals; Should Beat Friars Easily 
### Hugh Hollembeak 
After safely clearing Its second hur
dle in the Pacific Coast Conference
race the Stanford varsity returned
from Portland yesterday and immedi
ately went to work for its encounter
with Eddie Kienholz's Santa Clara
Broncos in the stadium next Friday.
The Vandals proved to be by far the
toughest competition the Cards have
run up against this season. Th'i splen
did defensive play put up by the local
team together with the fact that none
of the squad suffered serious injury
was a source of great satisfaction to
"Pop" Warner and his assistants.
According to Andy Kerr, the Idaho
eleven showed itself one of the best
teams on the Coast, both on offense
and defense. When work 011 the part
of the Stanford backs broke up the
northerners' passing game, Coach
Matthews' boys showed their stuff by
advancing the ball on straight foot
ball.
Lawson Stars
"Jim Lawson played the greatest
game of his life," said Kerr, in com
menting on the work of the boys from
the farm. "Harry Shipkey and Nofm
Cleaveland were in every play and it
was the work of these two men in the
pinches that was directly responsible
for their team's victory.
"Contrary to reports, it was Shipkey
who, late in the fourth- quarter, broke
through and smeared Stiver's punt,
putting the ball in position for Cudde
back's winning field goal. Twice when
Idaho completed long passes Cleave- j
land was the man who stopped the i
Vandal runner."
After the affair with Idaho Stanford
should have little difficulty in defeat
ing Santa Clara. The Broncos have j
played a number of good games this
year, but with the Cards in mid-season (
form the Mission boys do not look like j
dangerous opponents.
Last Saturday Kienholz chose to let
his boys take it easy in beating Davis
Farm 6 to 0. The score of the game j
fails to do Santa Clara justice. After
opening the season by holding Cali
fornia to 13 to 7, the Broncs have
played winning football, their best j
showing being a 12 to 0 win over Occi
dental at Los Angeles two weeks ago.
In that contest flashy work in the last
quarter put over two touchdowns and
broke what threatened to be a score-.
less tie.
Broncs Have Good Material
On the offense Kienholz has a wealth
of high-class material. "Moose" Fawke,
for three years mainstay of the Mis
sion backfield, is sharing the line
plunging honors with "Red" Chisholnx,
former Lick-Wilmerding star. At quar

ter is "Bud" McKee, the boy whose
goal from field won last year's little
big game with Saint Mary's, while the
running of Bundy and Babcock in the
open Held has been a feature of the
early-season games.
To help out this galaxy of stars |
Kienholz has built up a fairly strong
line and a fast passing game. Santa
Clara scouts have watched the Cards
and have built up a defense against
Warner's plays, making all things
point to the visitors putting up a
light from start to finish.
Nevers Not to Play
Chances that Ernie Nevers will re
turn to the game Friday are exceed
ingly slim. The big blonde is running
around the turf again and looks to be
in good shape, but Warner will prob- j
ably save him for the U. S. C. struggle I
a week away. Blake Thomas will also
watch the game from the bench. His
injured leg is yielding slowly to treat
ment, but it will be some time before
he will be fit to take the field.
Aside from these two, the squad
is in good shape, and Warner will
probably use a large number of men,
Friday, saving his strength for the
j game in Los Angeles with the Trojans.
Saturday the varsity will watch the
U. S. C.-California game in the Me
morial Stadium at Berkeley.
