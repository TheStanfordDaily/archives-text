# PHYSICAL EDUCATION CHECK-OFF SYSTEM FOUND SUCCESSFUL
## 
### 
"Checking up the classes in men's i
physical education by the honor sys
tem is working out fairly well, al
though the newness of the systeip
combined with the newness of half of
the students involved, is raising some
difficulties," declares Dr. Barrow, di
rector of physical education.
"A large number of men were re
ported the first week for cuts which,
when the students were interviewed
at the Director's office, were found to
be due to carelessness or ignorance.
Men should remember these three
points:
"First, that the responsibility of
checking in and out rests absolutely
with the student and failure to do so
properly will be recorded as a cut.
"Second, when excuses are issued to
a student on account of temporary
physical disability, these excuses must
be turned in to the proctor on or be
fore the day on which the cut is in
curred.
"Finally, men should remember that
the requirement in physical education
cannot be flunked at the discretion of
the student. Failure of the student to
report regularly for class work will j
result eventually in his name being
reported to the registrar's office for
action which may end in cancellation
of registration.
"Jacob Irwin and his assistant, the
proctors in charge of the rolls, report
that this application of the honor sys
tem to gymnasium classes has been
working out well. There is a saving of
time and trouble to the student in
having the rolls kept this way instead
of as formerly, and it is hoped thsft the
men will co-operate to make this sys
tem entirely successful."
