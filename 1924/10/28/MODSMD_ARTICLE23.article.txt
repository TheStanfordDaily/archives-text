This has been a week-end of carnage. Saturday evening, a carload of
Stanford men were the innocent victims of a rousing crack-up on the
State highway, whicli finally ended when a motor stage delivered itself
broadside into a mass of cars filled with eager spectators, piling eleven
automobiles into a tangle of wrecked tin-plate.
•Yesterday there were two, slight accidents on the campus, neither of
which was as serious as might easily have been. Three jams in the same
number of days are significant of several things.
The autumn rains are beginning to grease up the highways, and at
high speed one's ability to avoid disaster by sprightly and dexterous
work on the steering wheel is eradicated. Moreover, it seems that tliere
is a general contagion of carelessness. *
Student-driven motor cars probably get out of more tight places than
any other class, with the exception of those driven by professionals.
The student thinks fast; he knows his car, and he can put it through a
surprising number of stunts when spectacular action is necessary to
avoid a mess. Only this hypothesis can account for the surprising fact
that pedestrians and rival gear-jammers at Stanford have an extremely
low death-rate. Close shaves are as plentiful as roughs' whiskers, but
the student-driver usually manages to wriggle out of calamity at the last
moment. **■
The law .of averages, combined with the rain, are very apt to terminate
this precariously happy situation almost any time now. The departure
of Lady Luck would, in a single day, eliminate a small but lamented
segment of our student body. Unless we take steps to prevent it.
This is a problem for the individual driver. The taking of human
life is an unpleasant thing to contemplate, and Dinah Shadd's '"foot of
shod air" on the seductive throttle will go far toward making slippery
highways safe for the auto-cracy.
