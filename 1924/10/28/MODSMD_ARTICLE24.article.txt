Yesterday's Daily carried concise accounts of the three charities now
being put up to the students, and the united drive for the quarter is well
under way.
Stanford is an all-around institution, and as a matter of course does
things in a complete way. Every one of these three appeals is closely
and intimately bound up with the University. Russian Relief is being
inaugurated here, Stanford in China needs no amplification, and three
Stanford faculty members are included in the national committee for
Greek refugees.
In past years, charity appeals have received inadequate response here
on the campus. The University is well down the list in respect to benevo
lent activities, and Stanford has no right to be very far from the top.
The large proportion of self-supporting students enrolled here has no
particular bearing, as those are generally the ones who realize the needs
of others and set aside a bit of their own hard-won income.
The campus will be pretty thoroughly covered, and anybody who is
missed can vindicate himself by calling at the Bookstore.

CONSTANCE AND NORMA are going to take a half day off!
Right side by each they will be with the Stanford rooting section, and a
renewed rush for rooters' tickets is confidently expected.

A. VIEWPOINT signed only with initials, was received this morn
ing. If the writer will inform the editor as to his name, the letter will be
printed.
