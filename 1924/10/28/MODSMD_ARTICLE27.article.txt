We aren't advocating unhappiness,
though perhaps it isn't such a bad
thing after all. . . . "There is an elas
ticity in the human mind capable of
bearing much, which will not show
itself until a certain weight of afflic
tion be put upon it; its powers may be
compared to those vehicles whose
springs are so contrived that they get
on smoothly enough when loaded, but
jolt confoundedly when they have
nothing to bear." But what of those
revellers in misery who, despite their
load, continue so noticeably to "jolt"?
Yuan Kwo-Chang, Manchuria, China,
is 163 years old; and yet he hasn't
actually "lived" as much as most of
the freshmen on the campus. It isn't
the number of birthdays that counts;
but how much happens between birth
days.
The Scotland Yard inspector (a
most astute observer) who is trailing
the Prince of Wales in his journeyings
about the world, has noted that "An
American crowd will break down any
barrier, but an English crowd respects
the cordon and does not even try to
break through it. Your American
crowd will also sneak under a rope
. . . the moment the policeman's back
is turned."
Restraint seems to be a negligible
quality to a certain class of men. To
them it is the unattainable which is
attractive, not especially the rare or
the excellent; for when they have se
cured these they willingly throw them
away—merely because they have "con
quered." They do not realize that they
are continually seeking something
which is lacking in themselves. All of
which would not be too lamentable if
only they might be isolated from the
rest of humanity.
I wonder how much longer women
1 will struggle to come down to the level
| of beings grosser in every way . . .
j "kicking out the pedestal from be
| neath themselves" . . . imitating Man.
"Where the vivacity of intellect and
J the strength of the passions exceed
j the development of the faculties
the character is quite likely to be em
bittered by extremes, either of pros
| perity or adversity."
Bitter faces ... is it strange that
they are not lacking where the "winds
of freedom blow," and where one of
; the first aims is for "vivacity of intel
j lect"?

We aren't advocating unhappiness,
though perhaps it isn't such a bad
thing after all. . . . "There is an elas
ticity in the human mind capable of
bearing much, which will not show
itself until a certain weight of afflic
tion be put upon it; its powers may be
compared to those vehicles whose
springs are so contrived that they get
on smoothly enough when loaded, but
jolt confoundedly when they have
nothing to bear." But what of those
revellers in misery who, despite their
load, continue so noticeably to "jolt"?
Yuan Kwo-Chang, Manchuria, China,
is 163 years old; and yet he hasn't
actually "lived" as much as most of
the freshmen on the campus. It isn't
the number of birthdays that counts;
but how much happens between birth
days.
The Scotland Yard inspector (a
most astute observer) who is trailing
the Prince of Wales in his journeyings
about the world, has noted that "An
American crowd will break down any
barrier, but an English crowd respects
the cordon and does not even try to
break through it. Your American
crowd will also sneak under a rope
. . . the moment the policeman's back
is turned."
Restraint seems to be a negligible
quality to a certain class of men. To
them it is the unattainable which is
attractive, not especially the rare or
the excellent; for when they have se
cured these they willingly throw them
away—merely because they have "con
quered." They do not realize that they
are continually seeking something
which is lacking in themselves. All of
which would not be too lamentable if
only they might be isolated from the
rest of humanity.
