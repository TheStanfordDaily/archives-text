# QUAD ASKS MEN TO WEAR DARK CLOTHES FOR GROUP PICTURES
## 
### 
Men's organizations are asked by
the 1926 Quad to *wear dark clothes
for group pictures, which are now
being taken in the pavilion.
This request has been made because
the wearing of cords would destroy
the uniformity essential to the best
appearance of the organization. For
individual pictures men may wear
cords, since these will not show in the
photograph. Men must, however, wear
dark coats and white shirts. Women
should wear white collars, as these
bring out the head and features.
Proofs will be on display at the desk
in the pavilion three days after the
sitting. Students must call for their
proofs and must return them within
four days after receiving them. The
Lafayette Studio of San Francisco,
which is taking the pictures, will have
a representative in the pavilion han
dling individual orders.
