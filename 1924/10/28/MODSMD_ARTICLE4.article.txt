# Freshmen Delight Campus With Original Humor; Twenty-Seven Is Warned
## 
### 
Initiative in the nth degree would
appear to- be the chief characteristic
of the freshman class this year.
Early risers on the campus were
greeted by a sign-plastered sidewalk
which declared in no uncertain terms
that the class of '28 had the world by
the hip, and that *27 had better hop
aboard if it did not want to be left
in a cloud of dust.
All Palo Alto sidewalks as well as
those on the campus had been plas
tered with the posters this morning.
