# DRAMATIC SOCIETY HAS DIFFICULTY IN CASTING "ROBOTS"
## 
### 
The problem of finding a sufficient
number of men of the same height and
proportions has been one of the diffi
culties that Sword and Sandals So
ciety has been experiencing while
casting players for "R. U. R.," the
sensational melodrama to be pre
sented on November 14.
"R. U. R." deals with a manufac-,
turing concern which is in the busi
ness of creating mechanical beings
who are able to work and think, but
who have no feelings and are utterly
indifferent about what happens to
them. One of the thrilling moments of
the play comes when these mechanical
men assault the factory where they
are made, and kill all but one of the;
human beings who are there.
Tryouts for these "Robots," as they
are called, have been held for two
weeks now, and the field of available
men has been narrowed down to about 1
sixteen men. The following men are
requested to report in the Assembly
hall tonight at 7 o'clock, for final try
outs:
L. W. Merryman, Thomas- E. Con
noly, Kenneth Hess, W. R. Hunkins,
C. W. Timmons, M. H. Gerry, R. T. j
Baker, Russell Stroup, Horace Dry
den, C. V. King, Vance Weaver, John j
Irwin, Earl Brady, Reginald Pegram,
Wesley Wright, Curtis Wright, G. P.
Purnell.
