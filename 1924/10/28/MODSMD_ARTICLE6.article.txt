# FORTY PLAYERS NOW WORKING ON WINTER BASEBALL PRACTICE
## 
### 
Baseball practice is now getting well
under way under the direction of
Coach Harry Wolters. Twenty-five
upperclassmen and fifteen of
year's freshman team report three j
times a week for light workouts and
a six-inning game..
No games are to be scheduled with
outside teams this quarter. Practice
now is merely to get a line on the
material for this year-and to keep the
men in training.
Draper, Teague, King, May, Oviatt.
and McCandless, all of last year's var
sity, are now in uniform doing the
preliminaries. The varsity only lost
two men by graduation—"Bud" Wood
ward, first base, and Fuller, left field.
There is an abundance of material
to fill these two positions coming from
the 1927 freshman team. Jerry Stew
art, Clair Smith, Franz Osthaus, and
Steve Collins were all stars on the'
babe outfit and promise good competi
tion for a regular berth on the varsity
squad this year.
About fifteen freshmen are working
into shape for the season, but accord
ing to Harry Wolters it is impossible
to get a line on their prospects this
early.
