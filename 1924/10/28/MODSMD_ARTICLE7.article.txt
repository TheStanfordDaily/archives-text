# Cardinal Water Polo Men Meet for Initial Practice
## 
### 
With every veteran back except
Charlie Fletcher, the Cardinal varsity
water poloists held their first practice;
of the year today in Encina pool.
No matches have been scheduled for
in light workouts until the start of the
this quarter, but the team will engage
winter season.
Coach Ernie Brandsten is entering]
a strong bid to bring the national
water polo championships to Califor
nia next spring. If he is successful, thp
matches will be played in the new j
IflOO foot Fleishacker memorial pool in
San Francisco.
Other contests will be arranged
should the officials of the A. A. U. not
favor Brandsten's proposal. The Card;
mentor is anxious for revenge against '
the Olympic Club because of its vie- i
tory over the Stanford seven last year
and its more recent swimming tri
umph in the P. A. A. meet.
