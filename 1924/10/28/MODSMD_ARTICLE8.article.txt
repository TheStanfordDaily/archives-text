# FRATERNITY COUNCIL NOMINATES TWO FOR EASTERN CONCLAVE
## Gil Wheat or Les Dills to Be Sent to National New York Confab 
### 
Gil Wheat and Leslie Dills were
nominated for Stanford's representa
tive to the National Interfraternity
Conference at the Interfraternity
Council meeting last night. The na
tional conference will be held in New
York on November 28 and 29.
These nominations will be referred
to the various houses for considera- J
tion, and the representative will be
chosen at a special meeting of the
council next Monday night. The dele- |
gate will leave here the night of the
Big Game and will be gone two weeks.
It was decided by the Council that I
no freshman be allowed to go to the
U. S. C. game in the same automobile
with a fraternity man. This will
eliminate any possibility of rushing the
freshmen at that time.
In taking an automobile load of
rooters to the game several of the
drivers have consented to take any
one, irrespective of his class or living
groups. These parties will have to be
rearranged because of this new ruling
of the Council, which feared this
would leave an opening for rushing
parties to be formed.
Plans were formulated for the All- '
University dance to be given by the â–  :
Interfraternity Council on November
15, the night of the Montana game.
