# ATTENDANCE SHOWS 100 INCREASE OVER 1923 REGISTRATION
## 
### 
With a total registration of 2916, '
an increase of about one hundred over
1923, student attendance at Stanford
reaches its high water mark. While
this figure will vary slightly during the
year it represents closely the number
of graduate and undergraduate stu
dents who will be in attendance.
Eight hundred twenty-sue new stu
dents are roaming about the campus
this fall. The one hundred increase
came among upper classmen and
graduates. Seven hundred forty-five
men applied for the 450 places open
to underclassmen with less than 80
units of credit.
More Than 600 Women Applicants
There were more than 600- appli
cants for 140 places opeu to new wo
men. Of these 105 entered as fresh-i
men or advanced undergraduates and
35 as graduate students.
Stanford has a grave problem in the
question of admission of new students,
especially because of the limitation
placed upon the admission of women
since the University was founded.
Since competition among high school
students desirous of entering Stan
ford has become so keen much inter
est is manifested throughout the West
in the method adopted by the Univer
sity in the selection of its students.
To enter as a freshman without
examination a boy must have gradu
ated from an approved preparatory
school with recommending grades in
subjects aggregating fifteen units. He
must also be recommended on char
acter and seriousness of purpose.
In schools which do not designate
between a passing and recommending
grade, no subject will be credited un
less the grade be at least 5 per cent
higher than the lowest passing grade.
May Take Examinations
A freshman may also enter on ex
amination whether he be a graduate
of an approved preparatory school or
not, provided he has been duly recom
mended and that he passes either the j
ordinary examination of the College
Entrance Examination Board in sub
jects, including English, aggregating
fifteen units or the comprehensive
examination in fd\ir subjects.
Supplementary examinations some
times called intelligence tests are
taken by all candidates for under
graduate standing. This examination
was given for the first time last June
to 939 candidates; it was conducted at
thirty-three different centers in Cali
fornia and in ten towns and cities out
side this state.
Number of Men Not Restricted
There is no restriction upon the
number of men who may enter in
graduate standing nor in advanced
standing where the applicants have
eighty or more units of college work.
