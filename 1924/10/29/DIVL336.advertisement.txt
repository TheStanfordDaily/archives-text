"Gang, meet Kole Black Delmar"
Come in and be introduced to this handsome winter
oxford. Black as coal, with the lines of a sturdy
charger.
J~r Its double sole and good Walk-Over construction
make it great for the Quad, and, with a shine, it's
plenty good enough to step the light fantastic.
The tax, $10.
