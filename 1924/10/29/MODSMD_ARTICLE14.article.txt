# SOPHOMORES TAKE INTERCLASS GAME FROM BABES 28-0
## Freshmen Helpless Before Smashing Offense of Second-Year Men 
### 
Playing snappy football in spite of
the rain which fell all afternoon, the
sophomores provided the first upset
of the interclass season when they
defeated the freshmen 28 to 0 yester
day on the freshman practice field.
Conceded to be the strongest con
tender for the championship the babes
were helpless before the vicious at
tack of the second-year men staged in
the last half.
First Half, 3 to 0
Neither team threatened during the
first two periods except on one occa
sion when the '27 gridders pushed the
ball down to the ten-yard line and Mr.
Dougall sent over a drop kick. At all
other times the ball seesawed in mid
field and the half ended with the score
3 to 0 against the frosli.
The third quarter had hardly started
when Rafetto, who played a whale
of a game at tackle for the winners,
blocked a kick, and Williams, scoop
ing up the ball, ran twenty yards to a
touchdown. The first year men came
back fighting mad but when Rehm in
tercepted one of their passes a mo
ment later and ran fifty yards to an
other score their morale slumped vis
ibly.
Two more touchdowns were scored
by the winners in the closing period,
most of which was played after it was
so dark that it was difficult to follow
the play. The first score came when
Schwartz passed fifteen yards to
Smythe, the latter taking it over the
line after a ten-yard run, and the sec
ond was the work of this same Smythe
who carried the ball thirty yards
around end from pass formation. Con
version of goals after touchdowns
failed on all occasions but one.
Rafetto Stars.
Rafetto, star lineman of the 1927
freshman team, was the outstanding
player on the field, his great work
being largely responsible for the fail
ure of the babes' attack. The soph
backfield, composed of McDougal at
quarter, Smythe and Weber at halves
and Rehm at full looked strong when
it came to advancing the ball. Thomp
son at end played a good game for the
freshmen while Cass, red-haired full
back, was their best ground-gainer.
The freshmen were outweighed eight
pounds to the man and on the wet
turf this more than offset their super
ior organization and longer period of
practice.
Saturday Game Postponed
The interclass games scheduled for
Saturday have been postponed until
next week in order to permit the
players to attend the California-U. S.
C. contest at Berkeley.
C. W. Davis, director of intramural
athletics, has named Tuesday as the
day ofr the senior-sophmore struggle
and Wednesday for the freshman
junior engagement. The remaining
games of the series will bo played
on the dates scheduled.

Smythe, the latter taking it over the
line after a ten-yard run, and the sec
ond was the work of this same Smythe
who carried the ball thirty yards
around end from pass formation. Con
version of goals after touchdowns
failed on all occasions but one.
Rafetto Stars.
Rafetto, star lineman of the 1927
freshman team, was the outstanding
player on the field, his great work
being largely responsible for the fail
ure of the babes' attack. The soph
backfield, composed of McDougal at
quarter, Smythe and Weber at halves
and Rehm at full looked strong when
it came to advancing the ball. Thomp
son at end played a good game for the
freshmen while Cass, red-haired full
back, was their best ground-gainer.
The freshmen were outweighed eight
pounds to the man and on the wet
turf this more than offset their super
ior organization and longer period of
practice.
Saturday Game Postponed
The interclass games scheduled for
Saturday have been postponed until
next week in order to permit the
players to attend the California-U. S.
C. contest at Berkeley.
C. W. Davis, director of intramural
athletics, has named Tuesday as the
day ofr the senior-sophmore struggle
and Wednesday for the freshman
junior engagement. The remaining
games of the series will bo played
on the dates scheduled.
Playing snappy football in spite of
the rain which fell all afternoon, the
sophomores provided the first upset
of the interclass season when they
defeated the freshmen 28 to 0 yester
day on the freshman practice field.
Conceded to be the strongest con
tender for the championship the babes
were helpless before the vicious at
tack of the second-year men staged in
the last half.
First Half, 3 to 0
Neither team threatened during the
first two periods except on one occa
sion when the '27 gridders pushed the
ball down to the ten-yard line and Mr.
Dougall sent over a drop kick. At all
other times the ball seesawed in mid
field and the half ended with the score
3 to 0 against the frosli.
The third quarter had hardly started
when Rafetto, who played a whale
of a game at tackle for the winners,
blocked a kick, and Williams, scoop
ing up the ball, ran twenty yards to a
touchdown. The first year men came
back fighting mad but when Rehm in
tercepted one of their passes a mo
ment later and ran fifty yards to an
other score their morale slumped vis
ibly.
Two more touchdowns were scored
by the winners in the closing period,
most of which was played after it was
so dark that it was difficult to follow
the play. The first score came when
Schwartz passed fifteen yards to
Smythe, the latter taking it over the
line after a ten-yard run, and the sec
ond was the work of this same Smythe
who carried the ball thirty yards
around end from pass formation. Con
