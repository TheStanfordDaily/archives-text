# WINNER OF RALLY COMMITTEE SONG CONTEST DECIDED
## Alice Dodds and Margaret Cosgrave Submit Best Words and Music 
### 
The U. S. C. game song, entered in
the Rally committee contest by Alice
Dodds and Margaret Cosgrave, was
considered the most suitable to be
adopted for use at future games with
the Trojans, and declared the winner
of the contest by the judges this morn
ing. The Rally committee will mail a
$10 check to the winners today.
The song, which was entered with
out a name, might easily be called
"The Fall of the Trojan." Its words
were composed by Miss Cosgrave, and
the music is the work of Miss Dodds.
It received the judges' first choice be
cause the combination of words and
music was considered most suitable
for use at games with Southern Cali
fornia. The music has been given to
the Stanford band for adaptation.
Fourteen Songs Submitted
Fourteen songs in all were submit
ted. Second choice was "The Horse
Collar Hymn" by Harold R. Harvey,
who was assisted in composiug the
music by Norm Larson. The words
were the best of the entrants, but the
music was deemed unsuitable for a
bleacher song by the judges.
Honorable mention was given
Maurice Ross for his contribution. The
words were spirited, but he lost out
because he did not have original music
but use of "The Stars and
Stripes Forever" for music.
The judges who decided upon the
song submitted by Miss Dodds and
Miss Cosgrave were Warren D. Allen,
University organist, Professor Martin,
Charles Simons, Les Peter, and "Nip"
McHose.
The words of the winning song fol
low:
When Card meets Trojan
Out on the field —
The Trojans will weaken;
Their fate is sealed;
The bleachers cheering
Spur on the team.
The air is ringing with —
FIGHT FOR STANFORD!
Our men are struggling;
Holding the ball,
They forge ahead —
The Trojans fall.
The Cardinals are the victors
And the foe has fled
And the field's ablaze with red!
