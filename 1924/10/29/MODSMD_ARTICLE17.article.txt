# LARGE TURNOUT FOR ASILOMAR IS URGED
## 
### 
"The reason I'm so anxious to get
you all down (here is not that I get
anything out of it," said Miss Isabel
Capps, Y. M. C. A. secretary, speaking
of the prospective women's house
party at Asilomar, Monday night at
RobJe. "I've been there so often that
I know you want to go. It's awfully
hard to take 'no' for an answer when
you know the person who says 'no'
doesn't know what she's talking
about.
"We have a unique way of projecting
ourselves along the highway," she con
tinued, "twenty-two in one bus, andâ€”
well, you know what we'll do." These
buses will furnish transportation at $3.
They will leave at 8 a.m. on Saturday,
j November 1, probably from the Union.
Miss Capps went on to refute the
i rumors of setting-up exercises, lec
! tures, and a rigorous week-end. She
, advocated Asilomar as a refuge from
| typewriters and other obnoxious re-
I minders.
