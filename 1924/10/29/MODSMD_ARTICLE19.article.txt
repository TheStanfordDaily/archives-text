# Too Much Is Plenty
## 
### 
Just exactly four weeks ago today the class of 1928 was registering
for its first quarter of Stanford. Three weeks ago it tangled with '27
in the time-honored gesture which is the official beginning and end of
freshman-sophomore hostilities. By this, time, members of both classes
should feel themselves, and each other, to be citizens of Stanford—not
members of 27 or '28. They should be pretty well settled down.
Too bad! A group of sophomore enthusiasts embarked on a wild-cat
project which involved the laying of posters. They were not at all timely,
and the eftect was merely a sad smile and a pitying glance at the
sophomore class, which, as a body, did not in the least deserve it.
The babes come back with another wild-cat movement —the master
piece of sub-freshman mentality which resulted in the sign at the Law
Steps. Still, boys will be boys, von know, and the freshman is now,
happily, an emancipated being. Poor taste, perhaps, but the idea of
freshman "cockiness" is latent now and very few begrudged the unknown
artists their fun.
And now we have freshman posters! Heavens to Betsy, will blunders
never ceased Js this unauthorized guerrilla warfare between anonymous
groups representing two classes to continue until '28 pegs dead cats and
tomatoes at the 1927 Commencement ceremonies? Or are we going to
get on the boat ?
Freshmen are now being treated as mature human beings. A con
tinuation of this tomfoolery will eventually show that either they don't
know it, or that they don't deserve it.
Gentlemen of 1927 and 1928, remember that there is a gentlemen's
agreement between your classes. If you haven't enough to do, go out
for some activity and let's have a better Stanford. Quit pulling each
other's whiskers, and let your undeniable vim, vigor, and vitality do
something worth while.
