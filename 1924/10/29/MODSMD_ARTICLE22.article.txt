# Engineers Hear Lecture On High Voltage Cable
## 
### 
-At a meeting last night of the
American Institute of Electrical Engi
neers, Chairman M. L. Wiedmann of
the Stanford branch delivered a paper
on the evolution of the high voltage
cable.
Mr. Wiedmann described first fhe
development of power systems within
city limits, which gave rise to the need
for high voltage lines into cities, be
cause of questions of right of way,
and public safety.
Early forms of cables were de
scribed, and their development was
traced up to the present-day high-vol
tage cable. Wiedmann outlined the
conditions met by the finished cable
in service, discussing operation under
those conditions.
