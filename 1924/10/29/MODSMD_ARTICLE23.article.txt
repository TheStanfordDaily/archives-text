The Editor —Sir:
The campus was sort of knocked off
its feet, Monday, by what upperelass
: men termed "a pretty bit of Frosh
I cockinesfe," "a fine show of Stanford
| Spirit" (this sarcastically), and "a
■ great example of the Sponsor System."
Painted in glaring red letters at the
Coot of the Law Steps appeared the
; amusing little anecdote "To Hell with
| '27." Nobody knew exactly who was
: responsible for this prank; but indica
i tions seemed to point to members of
| the Frosh class.
About the time the excitement be
gan to wax hot, an unsuspecting for
eign student wearing a dink, walked
past. He was immediately seized upon
as a welcome outlet for pent-up emo
tions. He was forced to get down on
"all fours" and scrub diligently with
his dink, at the aforesaid paint. In
i the meantime, the crowd of upperclass
| men were getting a "hellofakick" out
J of the performance and patting them
i selves on the back for their part in
j upholding the old Stanford Spirit and
| traditions, Also the cheeks of the un
i fortunate Frosh were getting more
! and more like the color of the paint
he was working so hard to scrub off
the steps. Finally, the upperclassmen
(doutless noting the embarrassment
of our friend Freshman), decided that
the play had gone far enough, and it
was someone else's turn, whereupon
j the Frosh was permitted to leave the
fray, amid the jeers and shouts of his
compatriots.
Now, obviously, the big thing in the
minds of the assembled multitude was
the ugly smear upon Stanford Spirit
| made by the red paint crank. But, to
j the casual onlooker, there was an even
j bigger aspect of the thing; namely,
j the unlawful punishment of an Ameri
j can citizen, for an act of which he was
: not guilty. To any man acquainted
with campus affairs (who gives the
thing a moment's real thought), the
gross injustice of the thing immedi
ately stands out. He realizes that a
newcomer, and particularly a foreign
er, who is unacquainted with our
rough hospitality, will take the assault
as a PERSONAL insult, and as an in
dication that the University has found
him lacking in those qualities on whicK
his entrance examination was ac
cepted.
Taking for granted that the class of
'28 was responsible for the paint :
prank, was there a blanket liability
(for the act) covering all Freshmen,,
regardless of guilt? or were the guilty;
ones alone to be held liable? Isn't it
funny that in such a large and boister
ous crowd of brave Stanford men,
there is not one brave enough to stand
up for an innocent and helpless feliow
student?
AN INNOCENT BYSTANDER.

"all fours" and scrub diligently with
his dink, at the aforesaid paint. In
i the meantime, the crowd of upperclass
| men were getting a "hellofakick" out
J of the performance and patting them
i selves on the back for their part in
j upholding the old Stanford Spirit and
| traditions, Also the cheeks of the un
i fortunate Frosh were getting more
! and more like the color of the paint
he was working so hard to scrub off
the steps. Finally, the upperclassmen
(doutless noting the embarrassment
of our friend Freshman), decided that
the play had gone far enough, and it
was someone else's turn, whereupon
j the Frosh was permitted to leave the
fray, amid the jeers and shouts of his
compatriots.
Now, obviously, the big thing in the
minds of the assembled multitude was
the ugly smear upon Stanford Spirit
| made by the red paint crank. But, to
j the casual onlooker, there was an even
j bigger aspect of the thing; namely,
j the unlawful punishment of an Ameri
j can citizen, for an act of which he was
: not guilty. To any man acquainted
with campus affairs (who gives the
thing a moment's real thought), the
gross injustice of the thing immedi
ately stands out. He realizes that a
newcomer, and particularly a foreign
er, who is unacquainted with our
rough hospitality, will take the assault
as a PERSONAL insult, and as an in
dication that the University has found
him lacking in those qualities on whicK
his entrance examination was ac
cepted.
Taking for granted that the class of
'28 was responsible for the paint :
prank, was there a blanket liability
(for the act) covering all Freshmen,,
regardless of guilt? or were the guilty;
ones alone to be held liable? Isn't it
funny that in such a large and boister
ous crowd of brave Stanford men,
there is not one brave enough to stand
up for an innocent and helpless feliow
student?
AN INNOCENT BYSTANDER.

The campus was sort of knocked off
its feet, Monday, by what upperelass
: men termed "a pretty bit of Frosh
I cockinesfe," "a fine show of Stanford
| Spirit" (this sarcastically), and "a
■ great example of the Sponsor System."
Painted in glaring red letters at the
Coot of the Law Steps appeared the
; amusing little anecdote "To Hell with
| '27." Nobody knew exactly who was
: responsible for this prank; but indica
i tions seemed to point to members of
| the Frosh class.
About the time the excitement be
gan to wax hot, an unsuspecting for
eign student wearing a dink, walked
past. He was immediately seized upon
as a welcome outlet for pent-up emo
tions. He was forced to get down on
