night in exultation
I absorbed inebriation,
Just the same intoxication
I had wooed the night before.
And by hell and heaven,
Gods of Mount Olympus seven,
I will revel in eleven
Yet tonight if never more.
For when in the arms of Bacchus,
Free from all the cares that hack us, |
All the slurs that sear and sack us,
Joy pervades this fleshy house.
And by the blaze of great Orion
I am bofn of loin of lion;
I am bold and bending scion
Of the regal line of Souse —D. T. R.
