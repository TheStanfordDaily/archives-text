# Sophs, Frosh Growl at Each Other; Then to Bed
## 
### 
A mere skirmish of forces, the ac
tion of which was nil, was the main
excitement at Encina last night in the
wee sma' hours. Sponsors % were on
heavy duty restraining their charges
from dousing the small group of
sophomores who contented themselves
with beating about the bushes in front
of the freshmen's dormitory.
Only one casualty went down on the
lists and that was the incident of one
freshman who sallied forth to do bat
tle alone. He came back literally with
out a stitch on his back.
