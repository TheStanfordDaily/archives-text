# PROFESSOR STUART WRITES LETTER ON CONDITIONS IN PERU
## 
### 
Professor Graham Stuart of the
Political Science department, who is
at present in Peru making a survey of
the government for the Carnegie In
stitute of Washington, writes that he
has encountered a number of difficul
ties in his work, because of the un
settled condition of the government.
There are no official government
records after 1847, and Stuart has had
to get all his material by word of
mouth from judges or look it up in the
day-to-day record of the legislature. He
says that all their methods are most
unbusinesslike. For example, he heard
that the salaries of the legislators had
been raised several years ago, and
hunted in files and copies of laws to
find the official statute. He was unable
to place it and finally asked a man he
knew who said that no official statute
had ever been made; the legislators
had all gotten together and decided to
have higher salaries and how much
the increase should be.
' Although the government is nomi
nally a constitutional republic with
set times for elections, the presidents
are generally changed by revolutions
rather than elections. Just at present
the country is in a fairly peaceful
state, because the present president
has a strong hand upon the reins.
However, he and the president of the
great university in Lima, Universidad
Margos de San Marcos, are in opposi
tion. The Lima papers have sided
against the university man, so that his
life is in constant danger and he lives
barricaded up in his home. Stuart had
a difficult time to get to see him at
all, but now can enter by sending in a
card and passing a few flunkies.
According to Stuart, the number of
people who speak English and French
is quite amazing. He has had to move
three times to get where he could per--
feet his Spanish.
