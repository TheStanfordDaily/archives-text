# Audition Authority Will Demonstrate Loud Speaker
## 
### 
Dr. Harvey Fletcher, of the Bell
System laboratories in New York, will
talk before a meeting of the American
Institute of Electrical Engineers, at
Native Sons hall in San Francisco, on
November 5. He will speak on his re
cent work in audition.
Dr. Fletcher is a national authority
on the functioning of the human ear,
and on scientific aids to hearing. He
has made all of the recent investiga
tions into the hearing of the human
being with a view to the perfection of
transmission of sounds by telephone,
for normal hearing, and by special
apparatus, for those who are deficient
in hearing.
He intends to demonstrate with the
loud speaker several of the principles
involved, such as the effect of the sup
pression of various frequency bands.
This lecture will be of particular
interest to engineers in communica
tion, and to physicists, psychologists,
and physicians who deal with phe
nomena of hearing.
