# Encina Lobby Converted Into Garage When Rain Endangers "Cut-Down"
## 
### 
Encina hall was treated to another
diversion last night when a group of
mischievous freshmen rolled a Ford
cut-tlown into the lobby of the hall,
and then up the stairs to the second
floor. The triumphant procession was
halted upon the arrival of the owner,
who enlisted a sympathetic by
standers to get the machine into the
driveway.
The real perpetrator of the deed is
unknown, as an enthusiastic crowd
helped shove the Ford into the hall.
The act is explained as a rare hit of
philanthropy because of the rain and
the danger that the car would get wet.
This was not appreciated by the
owner, however.
