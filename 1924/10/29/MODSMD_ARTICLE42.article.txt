# STUDENTS DISCUSS NOMINEES TONIGHT
## 
### 
The three most prominent presiden
tial candidates will be the subject of
a discussion held in the Assembly hall
tonight under the sponsorship of the
two Stanford debating societies, Eu
phronia and Nestoria. Professor Edgar
E. Robinson will be the chairman.
After a drawing for places on the
program, the Coolidge representatives
will speak first, Davis second, and
LaFollette third. The Coolidge forces
will have an opportunity to close the
debate with a three-minute rebuttal.
Thirty minutes are to be allotted
each side. In the case of Davis and
LaFollette, the division is twenty min
utes opening argument and ten min
utes rebuttal, with a tliree-minute
closer at the end.
All the speakers are presenting the
side of their choice; there has been
no assignment of positions. Robert E.
Lewis and Victor Hunt Harding, who
are representing LaFollette, have been
out campaigning for their candidate
over the state. Stanley A. Weigel and
John C. Dunniway are leaders of the
Davis camp at Stanford; and Bertram
W. Levit and Robert Littler, who pre
sent the side of Calvin Coolidge, have
been connected with Republican head
quarters for some time.
definite rule has been made by
those in charge that there is to be no
applause or heckling during the
speeches because of the time limits
under which the speakers operate. The
meeting convenes at 7:30.
