# YEAR OF VISITS TO FOREIGN COUNTRIES TOLD BY LECTURER
## Professor Whittier Speaks in Terms of Personal Experiences 
### 
"There are many thrills and a great
deal of education in visiting other
nations," said Professor Clarke B.
Wliittier, of the Law School, who gave
a lecture on "High Lights in a Year
of Travel," last night.
"We spent the last sixteen months
abroad, but we started without any
definite plans. Our itinerary included
Canada, as well as the European coun
tries. At Liverpool we bought a sec
ond-hand Ford sedan, and toured Eng
land, south Scotland, and Wales. Then
we went to Switzerland, Belgium, Hol
land, and France.
"After leaving France we visited
Egypt, where we sailed down the Nile.
Later we went through Palestine to
Constantinople, from there to Italy,
France, and home.
"Everyone knew we were Ameri
cans. In Egypt the donkeys were either
named Teddy Roosevelt, or Woodrow
Wilson. Great respect was shown for
the United States' military strength.
Prices Reasonable
"Persons can now go to Western
Europe for $5 a day and be comfort
able," he stated. "In France and Italy
prices are even more reasonable.
"The art and architecture were some
of the greatest pleasures of my trip,
although some of the modern French
paintings are outrageously Cuhistic
and 'blockhead art.' English modern
painting is more like the great mas
ters.
"We saw about forty cathedrals, and
if it was the aim of the architects to
create a feeling of reverence, they suc
ceeded. The Rouen cathedral has a
tower built from money paid for the
privilege of eating butter during Lent,
and is called the Butter Tower. This
is very beautiful."
The Hall of Justice in Brussels is
supposed to be the largest building in
the world, according to Professor
Whittier. The Germans ate, slept and
stabled horses in it during the war,
and all the damage they did has not
yet been repaired.
English Most Efficient
"The English are the most efficient
and reasonable people we saw," he
declared. "They have high cost of
living, high taxes, and many people
out of work, but there are no com
plaints.
"Women don't vote in France, but
they boss almost as much as in Amer
ica. The French know less of govern
ment than Americans, and Americans
know less than English. The French
are sentimental in their attitude on
sucli subjects. There are no traffic
| problems in Paris, however, and there
are proportionately no more accidents
as a result of the no-speed limit."

know less than English. The French
are sentimental in their attitude on
sucli subjects. There are no traffic

are proportionately no more accidents
as a result of the no-speed limit."
"There are many thrills and a great
deal of education in visiting other
nations," said Professor Clarke B.
Wliittier, of the Law School, who gave
a lecture on "High Lights in a Year
of Travel," last night.
"We spent the last sixteen months
abroad, but we started without any
definite plans. Our itinerary included
Canada, as well as the European coun
tries. At Liverpool we bought a sec
ond-hand Ford sedan, and toured Eng
land, south Scotland, and Wales. Then
we went to Switzerland, Belgium, Hol
land, and France.
"After leaving France we visited
Egypt, where we sailed down the Nile.
Later we went through Palestine to
Constantinople, from there to Italy,
France, and home.
"Everyone knew we were Ameri
cans. In Egypt the donkeys were either
named Teddy Roosevelt, or Woodrow
Wilson. Great respect was shown for
the United States' military strength.
Prices Reasonable
"Persons can now go to Western
Europe for $5 a day and be comfort
able," he stated. "In France and Italy
prices are even more reasonable.
"The art and architecture were some
of the greatest pleasures of my trip,
although some of the modern French
paintings are outrageously Cuhistic
and 'blockhead art.' English modern
painting is more like the great mas
ters.
"We saw about forty cathedrals, and
if it was the aim of the architects to
create a feeling of reverence, they suc
ceeded. The Rouen cathedral has a
tower built from money paid for the
privilege of eating butter during Lent,
and is called the Butter Tower. This
is very beautiful."
The Hall of Justice in Brussels is
supposed to be the largest building in
the world, according to Professor
Whittier. The Germans ate, slept and
stabled horses in it during the war,
and all the damage they did has not
yet been repaired.
English Most Efficient
"The English are the most efficient
and reasonable people we saw," he
declared. "They have high cost of
living, high taxes, and many people
out of work, but there are no com
plaints.
"Women don't vote in France, but
they boss almost as much as in Amer
ica. The French know less of govern
ment than Americans, and Americans
know less than English. The French
