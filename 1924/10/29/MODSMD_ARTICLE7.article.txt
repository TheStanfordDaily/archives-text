# BABES PREPARING FOR CUB GRIDDERS
## Hunt Smooths Out Mistakes of Trojan Battle by Light Scrimmage 
### 
With but one game left before they
tackle the California Cubs, the Cardi
nal freshman eleven is smoothing out
mistakes this week and preparing for
the San Mateo Junior College battle
Friday. The U. S. C. defeat was dis
heartening to the babes and somewhat
of a surprise but "Husky" Hunt hopes
to profit from it for the "Little Big
Game."
In preparation for it, he is putting
his charges through stiff signal prac
tice with a little light scrimmage on
the muddy field. The San Mateo game,
while relatively unimportant, will,
however, give him a chance to see "the
effect of any changes in lineup or
formations besides giving the reserves
a chance to limber up. Luckily, no
serious injuries resulted from the Tro
jan encounter aside from a slight twist
to Hill's ankle so that "Husky" can
work on the eleven that started the
U. S. C. same.
There were few serious blunders
julled against the Trojans. It is true
that Pabst bungled a number of punts
which undoubtedly lost him yardage
but practice this week with a trial at.
safety against San Mateo should help
him if he again plays that position.
Passing Is Weak
The passing department was per
haps the weakest last Saturday. Out of
twelve attempts to gain by that meth
od, only four were successful and only
one for any considerable yardage. Of
the others, three actually lost yardage,
two were intercepted, and four incom
plete.
Millage, whose absence was prob
ably felt against U. S. C. when gains
through the line were needed, is still
on the incapacitated list. He should
not be needed against San Mateo and
will probably be given a chance to
again view the game from the sidelines
in order to properly heal the ankle.
Hoffman, from his showing Saturday,
can easily handle the punting.
Interest in Cub Strength
Aside from the interest which the
entire University will show in the
U. S. C. game at Berkeley, the babes
here will lend attentive ears to the
results of the U. S. C.-California year
ling game at Los Angeles. From it
should be deduced to some extent, the
strength of the Cubs, although they
are to enter the game short-handed.
Four men, it is reported, have been
declared ineligible by the faculty;
among them being a regular fullback
and end. Their absence, however,
should not greatly worry "Pesky"
Sprott, who usually has a wealth of re
serve material.
