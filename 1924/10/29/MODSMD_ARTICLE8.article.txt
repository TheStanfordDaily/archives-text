### 
Approximately 125 rooters' tickets
for the Stanford-U. S. C. game on
. November 8 remain to be sold. These
' tickets are expected to be disposed
| of by noon tomorrow, and after that it
will be impossible for anyone wishing
! to attend the game to get better than
a corner seat through the usual
1 sources.
The rooters' tickets may be ob
| tained, as long as they last, at the
■ A. S. S. U. office in the Administration
1 building. Additional Coliseum tickets
j are available at $2 each.
The demand for Trojan game paste
boards has far exceeded anticipations
of the graduate manager, and it was
necessary to wire for 1100 additional
seats, which brings the total of north
ern fans supplied to 9000.
Reports from Los Angeles state that
50,000 tickets have been bought al
ready. A conservative guess is that
68,000 seats will be sold before the
! day of the game, which indicates a full
bowl to watch the Stanford-U. S. C.
| classic.
Every drawing room on the special
train has been reserved, and Southern
Pacific officials are considering adding
a compartment car to the Rooters'
! Special.
Very few alumni reservations for
this train have been received ns yet, J
, but Paul Davis, graduate manager, ex
| pects an influx of these beginning next
week, since the alumni have not been
urged to make reservations as soon
| as have tho students.
