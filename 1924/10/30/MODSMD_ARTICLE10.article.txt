# SOCCER VARSITY TO REST WEEK BEFORE NEXT LEAGUE GAME
## Maloney Is Experimenting With Forward Line to Build Up Speed 
### 
With no game scheduled for this j
Saturday, the soccer varsity will rest
a week and give Coach Harry Maloney
time to further experiment with the
line-up before the next league game.
Maloney is endeavoring to get a
forward line that will combine without
diminishing the speed of the wing
men, which is so essential. Mirou is;
being tried at outside right, and Bing
at outside left.
Schoen Shifted
Art Schoen has been changed from
left half to inside left and, according
to Maloney, he has strengthened the
forward line. He is heavy, fast, and
fits well. Ta'am is still at center for
ward.
Bailard, Cardoza, and Hoover are
trying for a forward position and have
been working with the first string men
during the past week.
Backfield Steady
The backfield is steady with Ralph
Howe at center half, Franklin at left j
half, and Bushnell right half. Don and;
Dave Clark are holding down the full- i
back positions and Forrest is shaping!
up well at goal guard but needs plenty
of practice.
The graduate manager's office is
trying to shift the Stanford-California
game to this campus. It was originally
scheduled to be played at Berkeley
on November 11 but that day will be a
holiday at California, and it is feared
this would hurt the attendance. Stan
ford will be in session and the game
should draw a larger crowd.
Stanford Third in League
Stanford now stands third in the
league, with the Olympic Club first
and the Barbarians second.
"The win over the Barbarians last
Saturday was exceptionally good." j
says Maloney. "The team has only
been practicing a short time while the
Barbs have been going several weeks.
California was defeated recently by
this same Barbarian team so there is
a very encouraging outlook for the
Stanford-California game."
