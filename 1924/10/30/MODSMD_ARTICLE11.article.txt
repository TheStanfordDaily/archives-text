# University Affairs Discussed By Men, Women in Assemblies
## Women Endorse Actions of Men's Council Which Prohibit Liquor 
### 
Stanford women in assembly this
morning went on record as endorsing
three principles: the stand which
Men's Council has taken In prohibiting
the drinking of intoxicating liquors
among students; the unwritten law
forbidding University women to
smoke; and interest in campus elec
tions whether they concern women
alone or the entire student body.
Violet Knowles, president of Cap
and Gown, read a resolution commend
ing the attitude of Men's Council
against drinking, made public by Allan
Charles in the first student body as
sembly of the quarter. Anna Fitzhugh
seconded the resolution in behalf of
the Senior Y. W. C. A. Cabinet. Discus
sion followed and the resolution was
approved unanimously by Organized
women as a wnoie.
In explaining how the honor system
spirit should dominate students' con
duct on and off the campus, Carolan
Strouse, president of Organized Wo
men, cited the following example: "In
the eight cases of women which were
brought up before the Women's Coun
cil this quarter, each was reported by
the woman herself, who broke the
rule."
Dean Yost, in addressing the women,
commended the plan recently insti
tuted which gives Women's Council
the co-operation of Men's Council in
investigating places of public amuse
ment concerning which the women are
doubtful.
She urged that not only women go
ing out for athletics observe training,
but that all women of the University

i adopt those rules as ideal for healthful
; living.
Margaret Watson outlined the na
tional point system used to determine
women's athletic awards.
The decision concerning campus
I elections included a resolution that the
secretary of Organized Women write
to the Executive Committee inquiring
if it is possible for men and women
' to nominate each other.
Provision was made in an amend-
I
rnent to the constitution of Organized
Women, for late election of a member
to Women's Council, in case of the
permanent absence from the campus
of one already elected. It was decided
that elections should be conducted by
j conference members in each living
i group, with those who had run on the
last ballot as nominees, and the elec
i toral body excluding women in their
, first quarter at the University,
i Gladys McLeod, women's cheer lead
er, conducted the singing which closed
! the meeting.
