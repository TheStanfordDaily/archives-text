# Rules Regarding Conduct of Women Are Explained
## 
### Beardsley 
"Men of the University must help!
the women live up to their conduct
rules," declared Charles Beardsley,
president of the Associated Students,
at the men's assembly this morning.
"What I have in mind are breaches of
small rules, such as the rule requiring
women to be in before "lock-out" time.
Men should not persuade women to
stay out after hours and then help
them gain entrance by means of a
lower window."
Beardsley then read the women's
conduct rules, saying that in the fu
ture ignorance of the law would be no
excuse.
Charles Goddard, assistant registrar,
spoke on "How Can I Stay in Col
lege?" The first of each quarter, he
said, the question was "How do 1 get
into college?" but that by a month
later it had changed radically. He
then explained the grade-point system,
and concluded with a warning not to
be discouraged by mid-quarter exam
inations.
Physical education and the tenuis j
team's Australian trip formed the nu
cleus of a talk by Harry Moloney, di
rector of minor sports. "Every student
should learn at least one sport well
before leaving Stanford," Maloney
stated.
"Our Australian tour was a great
success, both athletically and in a
'get-acquainted' way," he continued.
"We tried to arouse their interest in
America and iu Stanford. In the uni- ■
versities there, the captain does all
the coaching—professional coaches
are unheard of.
"We think that our freshmen have
to do a lot, but they haven't one-tenth
as much to do as the freshmen at the 1
University of Madrid. They are thi> I
slaves of the upperclassmen."
Maloney said that the tennis team
did remarkably well in its matches,
over there. Out of a total of seventeen,'
scheduled matches, they lost only five.
The impression left behind by the
men was very good.
In conclusion, the club sang j
the new U. S. C. song submitted byi
Margaret Cosgrove and Alice Dodds in
the recent contest.
