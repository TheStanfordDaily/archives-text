# SANTA CLARA ELEVEN DOPED TO GIVE CARDS STIFF FIGHT
## Kienholz Boasts Strongest Team In Several Seasons; Missionites Have Good Record 
### 
A PARTIAL vacation for the varsity will be declared tomorrow afternoon
when "Pop" Warner's Card eleven bumps up against Father Kienholz's
Santa Clara charges in the stadium at 3 o'clock. Santa Clara has waited
expectantly a great many seasons to toll the worn-out mission bells in token
of a victory over Stanford, but the bells have continued to only wake students
for chapel and arouse the drowsy nine-o'clocker.
Last season the Broncos came to the campus with an idea of making a
round-up, but only succeeded in getting bucked off to the tune of 55 to 0.
Some say tliat Santa Clara has a better team this season. And critics, who
have watched the Missionites play, seriously corroborate the statement. Those
who watched the plucky Broncs battle California to a 13 to 7 defeat, saw a
desperate effort on the part of a smaller college to be the first to smear the

Mong list of Bruin victories. California
' pulled out, however, but that doesn't
bring down the Santa Clara stock.
"Red" Chisholm, 198-pound halfback
on the Bronco eleven, is picked for
that position tomorrow. Chisholm has
been out of the line-up in recent games
because of an agreement with the
I smaller colleges relative to the eligi
; bility of freshmen.
Ernie Nevers will suspend his ser
vices for another week. Warner still
believes Nevers' condition too critical
to take any chances 011 having him
injured previous to the University of
Southern California game on Novem
ber 8.
Kienholz has developed a strong
line this season which should make it
about nip and tuck with the Cardinal
defense. However, the defense is Stan
ford's strong point, and unless the
Broncs show a great deal of class
there won't be much gaining through
the Stanford line.
Captain "Moose" Fawke should
make things interesting for the Stan
ford safety man in the kicking game.
Fawke is also considerable of a line
bucker, and every year he has im
proved in this department.
There should be little lack of gen
eralship on the Mission squad with
McKee at quarterback. McKee is thor
oughly familiar with Kienholz's meth-
ods, having come from Long Beach
High School the same year that Kien
holz gave up his position there to
coach the Broncs. McKee is credited
with some heady work in the recent
game Santa Clara played with Occi
dental college.
Warner is well satisfied with the
showing Stanford made against the
University of Idaho eleven last Satur
day. It was (he case of two strong
teams battling each other to save
probable elimination from the Con
ference race, and Stanford, by taking
advantage of the breaks, won out.
Speaking of interference, however,
Santa Clara has developed a system
which compares creditably with that
of stronger universities. In fact Kien
holz's entire offensive method is based
fundamentally on a smooth-running in
terference. It was interference which
made Kienholz's teams famous among

high school competition.
