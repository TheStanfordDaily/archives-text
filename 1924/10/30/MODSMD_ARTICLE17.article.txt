# JIU-JITSU DEFENSE METHOD SHOWN BY POLICE INSPECTOR
## 
### 
Methods of self defense by jiu-jitsu
j were demonstrated by D. H. Hamilton,
traveling instructor for the Chicago
police department, in an exhibition
given in Eneina gymnasium last night.
Hamilton showed the comparative
ease with which an armed assailant
, can be relieved of his weapons and
completely subdued by an unarmed
man skilled in the Japanese art. He
will give personal instruction in police
jiu-jitsu as soon as twenty-five have
enrolled. Twenty-four men, including
Harry Maloney, signed up last night.
The classes will be small, and will
be arranged to suit the convenience of
the students. A charge of ten dollars
| will be made for a course extending
over a two-montli period.
A second exhibition will be held in
the gym next Monday at 4:15 p.m. All
4 and 5 o'clock physical education
classes on that day will be suspended
in order to give the men a chance to
I attend.
