# All Is Lost Save Honor
## 
### 
Yesterday there hung in the Classical department building a discon
solate-looking hat, with the following notice stuck beneath it:
"Whoever took the coat from this hook yesterday would oblige me
by returning it PLEASE. If you cannot do so, take my hat too."
The plaintive note struck by this unfortunate and philosophical gentle
man is reminiscent of a nonsense jingle written by one George Canning.
The verse details the tribulations of an old party who was seated one day
on the bank of a river, when suddenly his hat blew into the stream. Fuming,
he fished for it and his wig dropped off. The concluding stanzas run—
"His breast it grew cold with despair, and full in his eye madness sat;
"So he flung in the river his cane to swim with his wig and his hat.
"His head, being thicker than common, o'erbalanced the rest of his fat
"And in plumped this son of a woman to follow his wig, cane and hat."
This is a dismally symbolic picture of the almost universal collegiate
situation. Nowhere are property rights more submerged in an in
formally communistic attitude, and not infrequently it happens that wig,
cane, and hat will fall before the predatory onslaughts of the unthinking,
leaving the bereft owner of his erstwhile property to go skirmishing
after loose articles to replace those which he has inadvertantly contributed
to others. As a musical comedy expressed it: "All is lost save honor, and
we can't eat that." So honor may be sacrificed also.
Not all college men take so sporting an attitude as this mournful bill
poster who invites either honesty or further spoils. Perhaps eventually
even he may become disgusted, and re-build his wardrobe in the same
illicit way. It seems probable that much of this petty thievery must
spring from such a source. College men cannot be dishonest. They do
not carry habits of "permanent borrowing" off campus. It is merely a
"collegiate" habit, though this instance of stealing from a public rack is
even less excusable (also less common) than the rather usual stunt of
levying on the members of one's own group.
Such matters turn up too frequently to be ignored. When offenders
are caught, they are subjected to discipline and nobody denies that they
should be. Naturally there*are many, many more criminals who escape
scot-free—which would seem to be an argument in favor of a Chair for
the Development of Conscience to combat this "Danny the Dip" angle
of advanced education.
