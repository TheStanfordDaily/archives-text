# NO-DECISION DEBATE HELD ON CANDIDATES OF COMING ELECTION
## 
### 
The decision on the Coolidge-Davis-
LaFollette debate, held last night in
the Assembly hall, will be rendered
November 4, by some hundred million
judges, announced Professor Edgar E.
Robinson, at the close of the discus
sion.
The debate, sponsored by the Eu
phronia and Nestoria clubs, opened at
7:,T0. Robert Littler of the Coolidge
teafri spoke first, followed by Stanley
Weigel for Davis and Robert Lewis for
LaFollette. Bert Levit, Coolidge; John
Dunniway, Davis; and Victor Hunt
Harding, LaFollette. A three-minute
rebuttal by Robert Littler closed Mie
debate.
The candidates were not assigned to
the debaters but were chosen by per
sonal preference. The members of the
LaFollette team have campaigned
throughout the state for their candi
date; the Coolidge representatives are
members of the Republican organiza
tion here, and the Davis supporters
are leaders of Democratic party senti
ment.
In the opinions of many, Stanley
Weigel made the most effective speech
of the evening, although he was close
ly pressed for honors by Littler and
Lewis. Victor Harding, who has been
touring Northern California campaign
ing for LaFollette, gave an old-time
stump speech which aroused tremen
dous enthusiasm, but as his time was
limited to eight minutes, he was un
able to present his case to the best
advantage.
Both the Davis and LaFollette speak
ers assailed Coolidge and the Repub
lican administration, and thus Littler
and Levit were placed on the defen
sive, but they met the challenge and
compared the actual accomplishments
of the Republican administration to
the platforms and promises of the two
other candidates, to the disadvantage
of the latter. Littler, in his rebuttal,
successfully met Weigel's and Lewis'
charge of Republican corruption, by
pointing out that Coolidge himself was
in no way responsible for any of the
scandals in Washington, and that the
men who were have been driven out
of office and brought before the courts.
