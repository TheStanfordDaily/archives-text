# Telephone It

### 
1 lie Daily Palo Alto has a staff of thirty-eight reporters to cover all
campus activities and render each organization the service necessary for
it to function properly so far as publicity goes. When news-gathering is
hampered by studying (or vice versa, if you will) it is inevitable that
some news will be missed, and possibly a meeting or informal lecture will
be lost to many who would be interested. Cooperation on the part of
persons connected would be helpful, and the telephone number of the
DAiLy office is Palo Alto 1074. News "breaking" in the morning would
be especially appreciated, any time before 12 o'clock.
If it is anything of interest, and no reporter has taken the story â€”
phone it in.

ATTENTION IS called to the fact that "Viewpoints" should be
limited to 200 words, on account of space difficulties.
