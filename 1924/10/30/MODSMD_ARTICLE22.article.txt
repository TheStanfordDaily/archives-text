# THE 						LAW STEPS

<t> V. G. D.
Nothing is quite as pleasing as the
feeling of being indispensable—or at
least of being needed. It is almost
pathetic to see a man trying to con
vince himself and others that he is of
extreme importance in the great
scheme of things.
Some men are so busy; they have
so many interests . . . from writing
letters they "can't help writing for the
benefit of the girls in the South," to
representing completely in themselves
an entire campus activity . . . that if
the majority weren't busy trying to do
the same thing they would see it;
and stop to smile.
Men like Edison, Lincoln, Bell,
Schwab, and Ford learned that to work
with their hands developed character.
I wonder how long it will be before a
man's social rating on the campus is
determined —not by his fraternity or
the number of times he is seen at the
St. Francis hotel—but by the things he
does.
Spring quarter love does not always
lead to the expected. But Stanford
seems not unique in this. In Paris
barred doors are installed between the
rooms where husbands and wives wait
until their divorce cases are called by
the judge. The steel bars are found
necessary to prevent the ex-lovers
from getting at each other "tooth and
nail."
Japan is about to send 20,000 of her
natives to establish a great colony in
Lower California—a direct response
to the recent immigration law passed
by Congress excluding Japanese from
entering the United States.
It is being argued that Japanese are
needed in California to do work no
white man will do. This same argu
ment was used in favor of slavery
before the Civil War. Japan seems de
termined to get into the United
States; and the United States is de-;
termined that they shall not. The near
future loooks not uninteresting . . .
after all.

We grant that it may not be the best
thing in the world to allow the pure
white sheet of paper, which is our life
when we begin things, to change
merely into a pretty, though pale, pink
color. But we cannot agree that it is
good to allow it to be pounded into a
purple pulp . . . which some people
are doing in their endeavors to put
some splashes of REAL color into,
their lives.
Eugene R. Sawyer, author of the
famous Nick Carter detective novels j
and other Indian stories, died Tuesday
afternoon in "utter poverty." He was
so poor that he could not buy books

to read; and they were the only things
he cared for.
We began this column with an ex
ample of egotism; we may as well fin-1
ish it with another. When will the
State begin to spend its money, not
on itself and its degenerates, but on
people who have earned the right to
a little of the attention now given to
mental defectives?

I wonder how long it will be before a
man's social rating on the campus is
determined —not by his fraternity or

Spring quarter love does not always
lead to the expected. But Stanford
seems not unique in this. In Paris
barred doors are installed between the
rooms where husbands and wives wait
until their divorce cases are called by
the judge. The steel bars are found
necessary to prevent the ex-lovers

Japan is about to send 20,000 of her
natives to establish a great colony in
Lower California—a direct response
to the recent immigration law passed
by Congress excluding Japanese from
entering the United States.
It is being argued that Japanese are
needed in California to do work no
white man will do. This same argu
ment was used in favor of slavery
before the Civil War. Japan seems de
termined to get into the United
States; and the United States is de-;
termined that they shall not. The near
future loooks not uninteresting . . .

We grant that it may not be the best
thing in the world to allow the pure
white sheet of paper, which is our life
when we begin things, to change
merely into a pretty, though pale, pink
color. But we cannot agree that it is
good to allow it to be pounded into a
purple pulp . . . which some people
are doing in their endeavors to put
some splashes of REAL color into,
their lives.
Eugene R. Sawyer, author of the

so poor that he could not buy books

to read; and they were the only things
he cared for.
We began this column with an ex
ample of egotism; we may as well fin-1

mental defectives?

Nothing is quite as pleasing as the
