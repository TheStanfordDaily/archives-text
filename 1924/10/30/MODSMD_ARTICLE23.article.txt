# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT

### 
The Editor —Sir:
In last night's "Viewpoint" the "in
nocent bystander" overlooks a couple
of important points.
He will undoubtedly grant that paint
on the University premises must be
removed. Who should do it? Whether
or not the particular person involved
in removing the sign referred to was
guilty, is of little importance. By tra
dition the freshmen perform minor
labor tasks and, since the rest of us
have served our term, we feel under
no obligation to contrtbute further
services.
Another phase is that there are so
many innocent bystanders that the
apprehension of guilty members is
made extremely difficult. Until spon
sors are furnished with badges and
paid detectives' salaries we can hardly
expect them to run down every prac
tical joker.
On the whole, I think those that
supervised the immediate removal of -
the paint will be respected by the;
actual artists and meanwhile the |
"scrubbers" will register their com-!
plaint in the region of Encina hall.
where it will probably have the de-:
sired effect. SKID.
The University of Oklahoma is fos
tering a movement to publish a rccord
of the teams and athletics of all the high
schools and colleges throughout the state.

The men's Panhellenic council at the
University of Ohio is offering a gold
medal to the freshmen with the best
scholarship average for the year.

"Red" Grange, Illinois' All-Americau
halfback, gained an average of five
yardn for every minute he was in the
line-up last season.
