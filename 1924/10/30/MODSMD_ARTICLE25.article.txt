Everyone knows Uncle Sam in the
role of sailor, soldier, mail-man, diplo
mat, and even as surveyor, geologist,
and miner; but bow many have ever
thought of him as laundryman?
True, he doesn't actually bend his
back over a wash-board. His launder
ing activities consist entirely in carry
ing soiled and dirty clothes to the |
laundry, which is more often than not
"home and mother," and bringing them
back fresh and clean.
A cardboard box 4\k by 12 by 20
inches, covered with canvas, is the
usual laundry bag. It has two over
lapping flaps; the individual's address J
is on one and the "laundry" address
on the other. Sometimes the "laundry" |
address is a commercial laundry; usu
ally it is some home where mother or
the laundress who "comes once a
week" does the washing.
201 Boxes a Week
A close check on the number of
laundry boxes which were mailed from
the Stanford University office totaled.
201 in one week. This figure }s for i
boxes alone; bundles which contained
laundry were not counted, because of j
the difficulty in telling which held:
laundry and which did not.
Students send laundry to states bor-'

dering on three sides of the United j
I States, and as far east as Des Moines, j
j lowa. If a close inspection were made, I
, Stanford dirt could be found in Wash- i
ington, Oregon, Nevada, Arizona, all j
parts of California, and in smaller
quantities as far east as lowa. Geolo
gists say this has not as yet been
; done.
Monday would probably be guessed
by half the campus to be the heaviest
j day in the "laundry box" business, but
they would be far from right. Stanford
seems to take its weekly bath on
Friday instead of the traditional Sat
urday; at least this is indicated by
the fact that more laundry cases are
mailed on that day than on any other
during the entire week. After Friday
comes Saturday, and then Monday.
Tuesday is the lightest day of all.
It is a debated point whether the
object in sending laundry home is to
save money or in hope there would be
something "extra" when it got back.
For sometimes there is more than
I laundry in the weekly box. Surely
1 there is a stray piece of cake in the
I kitchen that would fit that corner, and
! in it goes. Candy, jelly, or some for
i gotten article is almost always found
| hidden among the clean clothes.
