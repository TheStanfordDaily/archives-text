# FACTS FROM FILMDOM
## COLLEGE STORY IS HAROLD LLOYD'S NEW COMEDY 
### 
With the Los Angeles Coliseum,
where the TJ. S. C.-Stanford struggle
slated for November 8 is to be played,
as the scene of a football battle which
is to be one of the big points of the
picture, Harold Lloyd started last
week on his final production under the
Pathe contract. Practically the entire
story will be laid around a college
campus.
Unlike "Hot Water," which is said
to be made purely for laughs with al
most no story, the newest Lloyd com
edy will have an interesting plot,
which will be developed along similar
lines to "Grandma's Boy" and "Girl
Shy."
At the completion of this picture,
which is expected to be in five or six
months, Lloyd will begin his first pro
duction under the recent arrangement
made with the Famous Players-Lasky
Corporation.
