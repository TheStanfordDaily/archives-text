# CLERGY ASKS FOR EXTENDED RUN OF "ABRAHAM LINCOLN"
## 
### 
Instead of asking that the film be j
taken off, as is usually the case when |
a group of ministers call upon the j
manager of a theatre, the clergy of a;
certain California city requested that;
the picture "Abraham Lincoln" be held |
for a longer period. The request was
granted.
"We will justify you in making this
move," declared one of the delegates.
"We shall organize large parties from
our congregations, and shall pack your
house to its very doors.
"We want to prove to you that the;

ministers of this city are stronger in
their practical support of a good pic
ture than they are in their condemna
tion of a bad one."
This is believed to be an entirely
new precedent in the picture world.
