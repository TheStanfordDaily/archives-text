# INTERCLASS HOCKEY ONLY FALL SPORT PASSED BY W. A. A.
## 
### 
A definite decision was made ruling
lhat there will be 110 intercollegiate
liockey this year and the time for
training rules to* begin, at a Women's
Athletic Board meeting last night.
The decision in regard to hockey
vas made because it was felt that it
is late in the quarter to try to get in
trim to meet Mills and California, who
have been playing since August; that
the necessity for extra practices makes
it inadvisable; that Mills and Cali
fornia have not shown much interest
in it; and that the National Board of
Women's Athletics does not favor in
tercollegiate games.
Training for hockey will start Mon
day. Margaret Watson, president of
W. A. A., urges every woman playing
liockey to look up her rules and to
be very careful about keeping them.
W. A. A. is, this year, taking a decided
stand against laxity of keeping train
ing rules of former years. If it is pos
sible, a training table will be started
at Roble.
