# COOLIDGE GETS 313 OF 490 VOTES CAST IN D.P.A. BALLOTING
## LaFollette Is Choice of 106; Pole Thought to Voice Campus Opinion 
### 
A total of 490 votes were cast by
the time of the final count of the Daily
Palo Alto straw ballots on the presi
dential candidates. Of these 313 were
for Calvin Coolidge, 106 for LaFollette,
G7 for Davis, 2 for Nations, and one
each for Foster and Ferris.
Of the 490 votes cast, 153 came from
the halls, which was the largest num
ber of votes cast by any single class
on the campus. In the halls Coolidge
piled up a majority of about 100.
The Palo Alto students furnished
the next highest, with 53. Among the
Palo Alto residents was the only two
places where LaFollette threatened j
Coolidge supremacy where the total
! was 27 to 20 for Coolidge.
Sixteen faculty votes were counted.
Coolidge led by but 7 to 6 over
LaFollette, while Davis polled three.
Fraternity and sorority opinion was
almost unanimous for Coolidge. La- j
Follette received but two votes among
the sorority sisters and one among
, the fraternities.
Faculty Republican
In one group on the whole campus
' did the Republicans fail to achieve a
majority. That was the faculty. They
' rated a bare majority among the Palo
1 Alto residents, but piled up unbeatable
amounts in the halls, fraternities, and
sororities.
That the poll has represented rough
ly the opinion of the campus is gen-;
erally admitted. The Davis aggrega
tion has never made claim to victory
and the LaFollette adherents have
come to admit that probably they
could not win on the campus.
Reports have come in from three
schools in Oregon in regard to straw j
ballots: University of Oregon, Oregon
Agricultural College, and Willamette
i University; and in all three Coolidge:
was distinctly in the lead. At Clark
University and Dartmouth majorities
I are also recorded for Coolidge.
