# BABE LINE-UP TO BE SHIFTED FOR SAN MATEO
## Hunt Gives Freshman Eleven Only Signal Practice During Week 
### Douglas Meservey 
San Mateo Junior College comes to
Stanford tomorrow to meet the fresh
man eleven in its last test game before
the Card babes enter the "Little Big
Game" November 8.
Aside from light scrimmage and a
heavy signal practice this week,
"Husky" Hunt's principal worry has
been in making shifts in the babe
lineup. Although the absence of Mil
lage in the U. S. C. game was a great
loss, several combinations in botli the
backfield and line proved unsatisfac
tory to Hunt and he has been correct
ing them the past few days. Whether
or not the shifts will work effectively
depends a great deal upon the result
of the game tomorrow.
It was the backfield that seemed the
greatest disappointment against the
Trojans. It is true that Hoffman's
kicks were down the field for good
distance, but at making substantial
gains either through the line or around
end he, together with Hill and Pabst,
did not at all measure up to expecta
tions. Hoffman's trouble is mainly ex
perience and this is increased in his
competition with Millage, for the lat
ter is undoubtedly the best of the two
as a ground-gainer. In his place will be
' Patchett, who is to start tomorrow at
| fullback.
Hill, who has shown streaks of bril
liancy throughout the season, has suf
; fered a bad let-down lately, due chiefly,
it is thought, to indifference. With a
j little fight he should do better against
j San Mateo, but without some kind of
a mental stimulus he will again suffer
! a fall.
On the other hand, Dorcy and Nich
| ols have shown the kind of improve
! ment that all coaches like and are
favorites for the two half positions
j tomorrow.
It was Dorcy that accounted for
most of the Card gains last Saturday
and if he has developed proportionate
| ly this week he should again be a
great help on offense. Nichols had not
been heard from up to the Trojan
1 game but the few times he carried the
ball he proved that he will be a valu
, able man with more training.
The team as a whole is suffering
from a bad case of under-confidence,
reports Hunt. Two weeks ago it was
"cock-sureness" but since the Trojans
took the wind out of its sails, it has
had little spirit left. Only against the
varsity have the babes shown any kind
!of fight, gaining through them con
sistently, but if their morale can only
! be raised to a "scrappy level" tomor
: row, Hunt is hopeful that it will con
tinue until the Cub battle.
As for the San Mateo college eleven,
reports have it that they are bringing
a bit of stiff opposition to the Farm.
: A G4 to 0 victory last week over San
Benito Teachers College brought iis
season's total to 202 points as against
, none for its opponents.
Two factors in the scoring ability
are said to be Bill Lawrence, former
I Lick-Wilmerding Starßand Bill Jarvis
; at -halfback—both picked last year as
all-state prep men. It was Lawrence
! who achieved such fame last year in
the finals of the state championship
; game with Bakersfield and he will
again have an opportunity to meet a
r Bakersfield man when he bucks Cap
j tain Don Robesky of the Card fresh
man line.
With Jarvis and Lawrence as a nu
cleus, Coach C. E. MacFadden, a for
mer Oregon star, has built up a strong
aggregation, and Hunt's men should
have their hands full throughout the
four periods. If they do run agaipst
stiff opposition, however, "Husky" avill
have ample opportunity to see whether
or not the eleven has improved since
the Trojan battle and how it should
stack up on November 8.

It was Dorcy that accounted for
most of the Card gains last Saturday
and if he has developed proportionate
| ly this week he should again be a
great help on offense. Nichols had not
been heard from up to the Trojan
1 game but the few times he carried the
ball he proved that he will be a valu
, able man with more training.
The team as a whole is suffering
from a bad case of under-confidence,
reports Hunt. Two weeks ago it was
"cock-sureness" but since the Trojans
took the wind out of its sails, it has
had little spirit left. Only against the
varsity have the babes shown any kind
!of fight, gaining through them con
sistently, but if their morale can only
! be raised to a "scrappy level" tomor
: row, Hunt is hopeful that it will con
tinue until the Cub battle.
As for the San Mateo college eleven,
reports have it that they are bringing
a bit of stiff opposition to the Farm.
: A G4 to 0 victory last week over San
Benito Teachers College brought iis
season's total to 202 points as against
, none for its opponents.
Two factors in the scoring ability
are said to be Bill Lawrence, former
I Lick-Wilmerding Starßand Bill Jarvis
; at -halfback—both picked last year as
all-state prep men. It was Lawrence
! who achieved such fame last year in
the finals of the state championship
; game with Bakersfield and he will
again have an opportunity to meet a
r Bakersfield man when he bucks Cap
j tain Don Robesky of the Card fresh
man line.
With Jarvis and Lawrence as a nu
cleus, Coach C. E. MacFadden, a for
mer Oregon star, has built up a strong
aggregation, and Hunt's men should
have their hands full throughout the
four periods. If they do run agaipst
stiff opposition, however, "Husky" avill
have ample opportunity to see whether
or not the eleven has improved since
the Trojan battle and how it should
stack up on November 8.
San Mateo Junior College comes to
Stanford tomorrow to meet the fresh
man eleven in its last test game before
the Card babes enter the "Little Big
Game" November 8.
Aside from light scrimmage and a
heavy signal practice this week,
"Husky" Hunt's principal worry has
been in making shifts in the babe
lineup. Although the absence of Mil
lage in the U. S. C. game was a great
loss, several combinations in botli the
backfield and line proved unsatisfac
tory to Hunt and he has been correct
ing them the past few days. Whether
or not the shifts will work effectively
depends a great deal upon the result
of the game tomorrow.
It was the backfield that seemed the
greatest disappointment against the
Trojans. It is true that Hoffman's
kicks were down the field for good
distance, but at making substantial
gains either through the line or around
end he, together with Hill and Pabst,
did not at all measure up to expecta
tions. Hoffman's trouble is mainly ex
perience and this is increased in his
competition with Millage, for the lat
ter is undoubtedly the best of the two
as a ground-gainer. In his place will be
' Patchett, who is to start tomorrow at
| fullback.
Hill, who has shown streaks of bril
liancy throughout the season, has suf
; fered a bad let-down lately, due chiefly,
it is thought, to indifference. With a
j little fight he should do better against
j San Mateo, but without some kind of
a mental stimulus he will again suffer
