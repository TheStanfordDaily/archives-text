# CARD ALUMNI IN SOUTH ENTHUSE OVER GRID GAME
## Graduates Planning Rousing Stanford Celebration In Los Angeles 
### 
Stanford alumni in Los Angeles are
nearing the fever pitch in anticipa
tion of the Card-Trojan clash 011 No
vember 8, and are confidently await
ing the arrival of the varsity and most
of the student body, according to Phil
Wilson and Bob Cravens, who are two
of the most well-known southern
alumni,
"I.os Angeles alumni are even for
saking real estate to boost the Big
Game of the South, hoping to run the
undergraduates a close second in en
thusiasm," Wilson said. "We may be
old men and our bones may he brittle,
but if you're as full of fire as we are,
those special trains may get lost in
the woods. We'll all be there to pro
mote a good time for you, and we hope
you'll all be there to let us."
Cravens, in speaking of the feeling
in Los Angeles, said: "The South has
been waiting for years for just this
chance to see "her team" come down
and meet the rival U. S. C. outfit. It
is to be remembered that the alumni
in Los Angeles and thereabouts are
backing the Stanford varsity to the
last inch. There is a graduate section
already signed up which can give the
flrf isent undergraduates a good sup
port in noi'semaking at the game."
Alumni Raring-to-Go
From the remarks of these two men
it can be seen that every former resi
dent of the Farm in Los Angeles is
literally raring-to-go and if half of
Stanford isn't there to help put the
team through the grid classic 011 top
of the heap these enthusiasts will be
sorely disappointed. It behooves ths
undergraduates to come up to ihe
expectations of the graduates.
And speaking of the good time that
Wilson promises, men are reminded
that a stag dinner at the Alexandria
beginning at 6:30 Friday evening will
open the festivities. "Pop" Warner
and his staff will be on hand to give
out a few words of encouragement,
and the team will be the guests of
honor.
The dinner dance at the Biltmore
will conclude the activities. The price
is $4 per plate. Reservations should
be made at once through the Biltmore
hotel management.
Rooters' Section Filled
The last of the rooters' tickets will
be sold by this afternoon, according
to word from the graduate manager'.?
office. This means that the rooters'
section will be filled, as originally
planned by the Rally committee. About
800 Stanford men will be in this group,
and they should be able to make them
selves heard.
Only three cars have been sold out
on the Southern Pacific Rooters' Spe
cial. It has now definitely been de
cided to run only one section to this
train, instead of the three, as origi
nally planned. The rather scant sale
of railroad tickets has put the railroad
