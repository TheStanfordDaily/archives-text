# "R. U. R." IS MELODRAMATIC Tense Moments Will Hold Campus Audience "In Sword and Sandals" Production
## 
### 
Tense moments of hair-raising melo
drama, aud courtship carried on under
the most adverse conditions imagin
able are the high lights in "R. IT. R.,"
which will be presented by the Sword
and Sandals society on November 14.
The initials "R. U. R." means Ros-|
sum's Universal Robots. The word ro
bot means "worker" in the Czech lan
guage. The play has for its central
theme the manufacture of these robots
which are nothing more or less than
mechanical men. Old man Rossum had
evolved a chemical formula which was
able to create a man who, although
he had no emotions or feeling, could
work at full speed over a great length
of time.

Rossum formed a company to manu-1
facture these workers and, after his
death, the family kept on with the
work until Rossum's Universal Robots
were being turned out in thousands,
and were being sent all over the world, j
The Humanitarian Society sends a
woman investigator to the Rossum
factory to investigate the living con-!
ditions of the Robots. How she per-j
suades the head chemist to changc
the formula in order to make the
robots more human, and how this
change causes the robots to revolt
and virtually conquer the whole world,
furnish one of the most thrilling plots
that the theatre has ever seen.
