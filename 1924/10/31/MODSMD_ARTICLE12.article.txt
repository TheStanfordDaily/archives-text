# BABES HELD BY SAN MATEO TO 0 TO 0 IN SLOW GAME
## Yearling Gridmen Short On Punch; Both Defenses Break Through To Smother Opposition 
### 
*
STANFORD freshman gridders failed to show the proper punch today and
were held to a scoreless tie, 0-0, by San Mateo Junior College. At no
time did the Cards threaten the junior college goal, gaining only
occasionally. In the oaier hand the San Mateo eleven had a chance to
score near the end of the second half but lost the opportunity when an
j incomplete pass rolled over the Cardinal freshman goal line.

> The first two quarters were score
less with few gains made by either
eleven. Hunt bad begun the game with
a number of shifts in the line-up to
experiment for better combinations,
but the team lacked punch and were
easily held by San Mateo.
The junior college squad's gains
were made mostly by Lawrence, for
mer Lick-Wilmerding star. A few end
runs by him gave San Mateo several
long gains but these were offset by
yardage made by Nichols of the Cards.
The Huntington Beach hurdler was
having his first try at safety aiid half
and proved the best find that Hunt
has made this season at the former
position.
Near the close of the second quar
ter, "Husky" substituted a number of
regulars who added a little punch to
the Card attack and at the whistle of
the half, the ball was in „gan Mateo
I territory.
! At the beginning of the second half
Pabst accomplished a long end run
and gained thirty yards.
Hoffman, put in at full, showed con
siderable improvement over last week.
Stanford made two first downs on
i straight bucking through the line,
Hoffman carrying the ball.
The ball was lost to San Mateo on
their fifteen-yard line. The junior col
lege was unable to .gain even through
the efforts of Law and was forced to
kick.
After an exchange of punts, San
Mateo was given the ball on their
twenty-five yard line and Law equalled
Pabst's run by making a twenty-yard
left end sweep. San Mateo here tried
a second pass but it was incomplete. ;
The quarter ended at this point.
Hunt's charges in this quarter Still
exhibited the same lack of punch tha?'
was shown in the U. S. C. game, and
although four first downs were made,!
they lost their opportunity to score
when they lost the ball on downs at :
the San Mateo fifteen-yard line. Stan-!
ford retained the ball, however, on
its thirty-yard line when San Mateo
failed to complete a pass.
The infliction of penalties for hold-l
ing and offside characterized the quar-l
ter.
At the start of the fourth quarter,;
Jarvis and Lawrence of the junior
college squad advanced the ball twen
ty-five yards through three end runs.
Stanford regained on the thirty-five 1
yard line when San Mateo failed to
complete a pass on a fourth down. A
fumble here by Murphy gave San.
Mateo possession of the ball.
Following this, San Mateo lost the
ball on downs at the Stanford thirty
yard line, but Stanford: tost this ad
vantage again when another fumble,
save San Mateo the ball.
San Mateo appeared, dangerous when
larvis, on a fake reverse,, made nine
yards off guard. This was followed by i
i pass, Smith to Lawrence, for a'
if teen-yard gain around the right euiL
leaving it San Mateo's ball ou the
t'our-yard line. The chance to score
was lost when Lawrence attempted; a
)ass which was incomplete and rolled
across the goal line, giving San M.*teo
the ball on the twenty-yard line.
The game ended with both teams
still playing each other to a stand-still.
