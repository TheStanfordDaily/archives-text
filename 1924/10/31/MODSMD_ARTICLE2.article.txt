# JORDAN DISCUSSES SCIENTIFIC THOUGHT FROM EARLY TIMES
## 
### 
"A Review of A. D. White's 'War
fare of Science'" was the subject of
I)r. Jordan's lecture last night. In dis
cussion of the work, he traced succes
sive attitudes toward scientific thought
from earliest times and showed how
science had its first beginnings in re
ligion.
According to Dr. Jordan, primitive
people thought of natural forces in
terms of human beings or gods be
cause they could not understand them.
The Jews were the first to think of
things in the terms of one god. Aris
totle wrote down all that there was
known about science in his time and
for many hundred years it was thought
that there was nothing more to be
known.
Dr. Jordan concluded by saying,
"There are many things that we do
not understand; the data is still in
complete. I see no trace of a begin
ning and no prospect of an end. The
finest record of all changes of opinion
is found in A. D. White's book, the
"Warfare of Science'."
