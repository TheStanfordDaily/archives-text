# Associated Students

In yesterday's assemblies, while the women of the University were
passing resolutions to encourage the men in carrying out their recently
expressed standards of conduct, the men were hearing, probably most of
them for the first time, the code of rules which the women have set
for themselves.
The similarity of objects was not a coincidence, but an expression of
the growing desire of associated men and women to work with one
another in daily life as well as for one another in the accomplishment of
the special purposes of each.
When the women last met in separate assembly three years ago, they
emphasized their willingness to aid the men in anything that they might
undertake, but at that time social regulations seemed matters that each
group must settle for itself.
Since then, however, the thoughtful have become more and more
cognizant of the common concern that men and women have in the
conduct of their social activities. Standards must coincide in essentials
if one is not to suffer from contact with the other.
Thus' it ensued that the women, realizing a mutual responsibility with
the men, chose, as a group, to endorse the stand which Men's Council
has taken, and they asked in return that the men cooperate in making it
possible to keep women's rules. Associated men responded at once by
first acquainting themselves with those rules. Further cooperation is a
question left for the future to decide.
The situation is significant of the time when the Five Hundred may
cease to be an entity in a university of 2900-odd students. M. B.
