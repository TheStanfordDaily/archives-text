# Charity?
## 
### 
Today is officially the final day of the united drive for the autumn
quarter. The goal set by the organizers was $6000, and yesterday's
figures on the proceeds for the week showed a total of $206.
There is something pitifully wrong somewhere.- Perhaps the quota
of about $2 per student was too high. On the other hand, the average
of about 7 cents per capita is not far from disgraceful. It is to be hoped
that a good many have delayed their contributions until today, as
Stanford is hardly accustomed to black eyes. And, so far, this is a
black eye.
However, if this is to be taken as the standard, let us individually
abide by it. If somebody else has given your seven cents for you, give
a like sum on your own responsibility. And if you feel inspired to
contribute fourteen, you will cover the responsibility of somebody else
who has been careless, forgetful, or financially paralyzed.
CIRCULATION PROBLEMS prevent the Daily from holding
over for the result of the Stanford-Santa Clara game this afternoon.
