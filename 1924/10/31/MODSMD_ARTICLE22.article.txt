The Editor —Sir:
The remarks of "An Innocent By
stander" in Wednesday's Daily anent
the regrettable incident of last Mon
day morning are very well called for,
but it appears to me that he has failed
to mention one or two aspects of that
affair.
Did anyone pay any particular at
tention to the action of tho bystanders,
particularly those of upperclassmen
and of certain persons wearing sombs
without the '25 band? The latter peo-!
pie are generally considered to be
fairly mature, but, to judge from the
actions of two or three individuals
conspicuous for their boisterousness,
some of them are even more imma
ture than the freshmen.
Since I arrived on the scene some
time after the fracas had fts incep
tion, I can't tell whether upperclass
men were the moving spirits in pre
cipitating it, but to judge from "By
stander's" remarks, they must be
guilty. At least, they tried to keep it
up as long as possible. Does this indi
cate maturity, or that wearers of the
Somb have not passed out of the prep
school stage?
To come to the point: In my frosh
days, dinks were without inside lin
ings. The present-day more stylish
lids have linings, often of'vivid hue.
More than once I saw men in Sombs
deliberately pull a frosli's dink away j
from him and rip out the lining, either
scrubbing the law steps. I don't care
a hoot about tho supposed sanctity of
those steps, since I am not a law
major, but I do wonder if law majors
