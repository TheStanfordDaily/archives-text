and tuneful, not a third-class burial
| song.
It has been admitted that a second
choice had much better words but

ours is a sample of it!

deemed best? This could easily be
done at an impromptu rally.

for souvenir-collecting have reached
an unusual degree, because I saw one*

Roughs' Day, else we have forgotten
that it is supposed to be confined to a
single day.
