### 
Comes now the Abolition Commit
tee, seeking to wipe out useless or
ganizations. Said to be open to sug
gestions. Finds out that Hall wants
Skull and Snakes wiped out, Row
wants Quadrangle club wiped out, Nes
toria wants Euphronia wiped out, en
gineers want shirts wiped out, T f N.
E. wants Men's council wiped out,
sophomores want freshmen wiped out,
freshmen want sophomores wiped
out, everybody wants Committee
wiped out. Hope Committee will act
on all suggestions.
