# The 						BLAH STEPS

<§> B. V. D.

We want the reader to know before
we go any further that the writer is a
confirmed cynic, and has prejudices i
against everything and anything, in
cluding roughs, blind dates, Sunday
night suppers, queening on, the Quad,
queening anywhere else, roughs, j
snakes, exes, the Prince of Wales,'
bitter faces, Manchurian double-octo
genarians, and roughs. It is just as!
well to know where we are, say we.
* * *
Oh, hum! What's new in the papers
today? The freshmen are still touchy,
after all these days. It is enough to
make one indignant. They should
know by this time that Stanford does
n't want men who insist on being
unladylike.
♦ * *
Astigmatism is making rapid strides
among the women of the Congo Free
State. Why can't someone put a stop
to this atrocious menace? It is just
this sort of thing which is making pes
simists of so many of us.
* * *
Now that all is over, we wish to cast
a slur of suspicion upon the contest
for a U. S. C. battle song. We sub
mitted one, and we will just quote it
to show that unfairness has been going
on under cover —sub rose, as it were: j
WHEN THE CARDINAL MEN ARE j
FIGHTING FOR THE BALL
When bold Ulysses ended the siege of
Troy
He his army in a wooden horse.
And at the Sack of Troy, 'twas the;
Trojans held the sack,
For the Greeks were victorious, of
course.
The Cards can take the hint and horse;
the Trojans.
They're bound to fall,
And we'll have a little Cardinal horse
play
Beneath the Trojan's wall. -
Chorus
Horsing the Trojans, all over the field,
Our men are perspiring, they're honor
bound to yield.
Rah! Rah! Rah!
The Sons of Alma Mater are triumph
ant,
The grand-stand shouts "Rah! Rah!"
So fight, fight, fight for the Cardinal
and the White,
And blah and blah and blah!
There! Can't one see that it is this
sort of injustice which makes pessi
mists of so many of us?
* * *
And, by the way, speaking of Spark
Plugs, have you ever seen young colts
in a field on a frosty morning?
* * *
Lost notebooks . . . how sad it is.
Is it any wonder that one sees bitter
young faces on the Quad, disappointed
Lovers pining in the Reserve Book-
Room, and even beautiful Woman go
ing to class with her eyes red frpm
the tears of disillusionment? Oh,
wicked Man! How could you?
♦ * *
Now I think that Mr. Beardsley, that
cultivated, assured, thoroughly ortho
dox "college man," is quite right. He
said in the assembly yesterday morn
ing that "Men of the University must
help the women to live up to their
conduct rules—especially tho small
ones." What a nice sentiment! In this
day of disillusion, when Man is prov

ing himself to be not the noble animal
he once was thought, but a Mere Cad,
I would advise Glorious Woman to
ponder carefully these words of our
student body leader.

A man and his wife in Abilene, Kan., |

Oh, the Tragedy of life! Must the
pure white litmus paper which is our i
life when we REALLY begin to Live
turn into a purple pulp, or a mere
pale pink? Ah, yes, it must be. In
conclusion, I merely ask that pro
found question which is seen so often
tligse days: Are you one of the four
out of five? Oh, dear! That's too bad.

WHEN THE CARDINAL MEN ARE j

For the Greeks were victorious, of
