# Fifty Men Enroll in L. D. Basketball Class
## 
### 
Fifty men-are enrolled in the class
in basketball being given by C. \V.
Davis for students fulfilling the lower
division requirement.
This is the first year that such a
class has been held during the fall
quarter entirely independent of var
sity and freshman squad practices.
Such a large turnout so far in ad
vance of the regular cage season Is
taken as an indication of the growing
interest in the sport at Stanford, says
Davis.
Davis expects his class, which is
composed largely of first-year stu
dents, will provide for the ffeshman
teams trained material for the intra
mural games which has been lacking
in the past.
