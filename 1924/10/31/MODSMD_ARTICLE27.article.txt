### 
Just what the Old Boy thinks of
songs iu general will be told in the
next number of Chaparral which will
be sold on Quad Monday.
After a long wait to burst forth
concerning the methods of troubadorK,
the Chappies have come out with
comments on everything vocal from
grand opera to a baby's crying.
Art work is present in the number
in great quantity, and Bickerton has
even given his conception of the fam

voice," accompanying a banjo solo.
