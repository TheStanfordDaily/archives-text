# PALO ALTO THEATRES EXPLAIN FAILURE TO REDUCE ADMISSIONS
## 
### 
Asked why the Stanford and Varsity
theatres had not reduced their admis
j sion price when the 10 per cent "nui
i sance" tax was lifted, as provided by
j the Revenue Act of 1924 approved by
j President Coolidge, Manager Lowery
of the Stanford Theatre made the fol
i lowing statement:
"Our admission price before the tax
j reduction was 27 cents, plus the usual
10 per cent tax. When the levy was
j taken off by Congress, our price would
have been 27 cents, a very odd figure.
"We had one of two courses to
choose from. Either we had to reduce
| our price 2 cents to 25 cents, or raise
it 3 cents to 30 cents. Obviously, after
such a fight lo have the amusement
tax lifted, it would not be right to
have the theatres of the country con
tinue with the same admission price
and pocket what had been formerly
paifl out in taxes.
"After carefully weighing the ques
tion we decided to raise our oj-ice to
30 cents, and give our patrons a little
longer show. We had been running
eight and nine reels to a program,
and now we are showing ten and
eleven reels. The actual time for the
performance has not been changed;
the projection machine simply runs
the film through at a little- faster
speed.
"Another reason is that the cost of
films has gone up a trifle. Also, the
fact that our new theatre is now being
built has made it advisable not to
lower the admission price at this time, j
We contemplate little or no advance!
in the cost of tickets to the New
Stanford Theatre, which our new play- 1
house will be called."
The 1924 act expelled -the tax on i
admissions of 50 cents or less, thereby |
relieving the citizen of average means, j
who attends a medium-priced theatre,
of all amusement taxes and compelling j
the man of means, who can afford to I
attend theatres charging admission I
prices greater than 50 cents, to bear I
the burden of the tax.

The money saved by the amusement
seeking public of the United States
for the entire country are not avail
will certainly be staggering. Figures
but a report from Southern Cali
fornia discloses the following facts:
Collector of Internal Revenue Rex
B. Goodcell shows that while for the
year 1918 the amusement attendance
was 55,944,000, for the fiscal year 1924
it had increased to 225,000,000. In 1918

the amount expended for admission
tickets to theatres and other places of
amusement was $9,537,000', while for
1924 the enormous sum of 142,750,000
was spent.
It is estimated that two-thirds of the
annual amusement tax of $3,687,000
has been lifted from the shoulders of
Southern California citizens of mod
erate means. These persons purchase
approximately 150,000,000 amusement

tickets yearly.
However, $1,200,000 must still be
paid annually by men of means who
patronize the amusement houses
charging more than 50-cent admis
sions.
When it is considered that over i
three millions of dollars are saved
annually by the peopfe living south
of the Tehachapi, the amount for the
entire country will be very great.

Collector of Internal Revenue Rex
B. Goodcell shows that while for the
year 1918 the amusement attendance
was 55,944,000, for the fiscal year 1924
it had increased to 225,000,000. In 1918

the amount expended for admission
tickets to theatres and other places of
amusement was $9,537,000', while for
1924 the enormous sum of 142,750,000
was spent.
It is estimated that two-thirds of the
annual amusement tax of $3,687,000
has been lifted from the shoulders of
Southern California citizens of mod
erate means. These persons purchase
approximately 150,000,000 amusement

tickets yearly.
However, $1,200,000 must still be
paid annually by men of means who
patronize the amusement houses
charging more than 50-cent admis
sions.

three millions of dollars are saved
