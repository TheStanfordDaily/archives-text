# CARDS NOT TO SWIM AGAINST HOLLYWOOD
## 
### 
All hope for a swimming meet be
tween Stanford mermen and the Holly
wood Athletic Club in the latter's pool
on November 8 was definitely aban
doned yesterday with the receipt of a
letter from the southern club by Mana
ger Claude Paris refusing to accept ths
terms of Coach Ernie Brandsten.
The Hollywood organization had
previously offered the Cards trans
portation expenses, but Brandsten held
out for the price of meals for his men.
The southerners could not see it that
way, and hence refused to do business.
They are reputed to have a number
of first-class swimmers who would be
able to give a Stanford team a hard
fight.
