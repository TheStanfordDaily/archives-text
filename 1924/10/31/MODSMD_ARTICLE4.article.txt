Several of last year's freshman team
are on the line-up. Coleman is holding
down the left halfback position in
good shape, and with Smith, Cannon,
and Noonan, form a good defensive
line. Rogers, of last year's varsity, has
been unajfie to get going at the goal
guard position but is now working up
better with the second string team.
Herb Hoover is also with this team
at present but is pressing hard for a
regular berth on the first string.
