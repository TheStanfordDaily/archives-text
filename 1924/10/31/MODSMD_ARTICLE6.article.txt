# "Meditation" to Be First Number of Organ Recital
## 
### 
"Meditation," by Theodor Bubeck,
will be the first number of the recital
by Warren D. Allen, University or
ganist, in the Memorial Church at 4
o'clock Sunday afternoon.
Scriabine's "Prelude in E minor" is
colorful and Chopinesque in its tex
ture. His works for piano and orches
tra are among the most notable con
tributions to modern music.
The last number will be the "Grand
Piece Symjihonique," by C6sar Franck,
who spent most of his life in France.
He is regarded as the founder of the
modern French school, and his majes
tic finale is one of the most imposing
structures in organ music.
