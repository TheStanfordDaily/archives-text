# STANFORD GRAYS, BRONCO RESERVES CLASH TOMORROW
## Hal Davis Will Send Strong Aggregation on Stadium Turf at 10 a.m.

Stanford Grays will play their sec
ond game of the season tomorrow
when they encounter the Santa Clara
Reserves in the stadium at 10 o'clock.
Coach Hal Davis has been working
his men at top speed during the week,
and should send a formidable aggrega
tion on the field. In their first contest
of the season the Grays walloped Fort
Scott 40 to 0. This game, however, was
not a good test of their strength be
cause the Fort Scott eleven played
raggedly, and seemed to have little
knowledge of football.
The Grays' line is powerful; the
linesmen hold when they should, and
open up holes for the backfield. The
ends, Rice and Wolf, are strong de
fensive players, and cover punts well.
For tackle there is a wealth of good
material. Evans and Simmons began
the Fort Scott game, but Potts, who
has recently returned to practice, may
beat out one of these.
Stevenson, Shoals, and Mathay are
fighting it out for the guard positions,
while Graham has the edge 011 Wents
tor center.
Hal Davis will probably start the
same backfield against the Broncs that
began against the Fort Scott eleven.
McCormick and Baxter at halves, Sil
ver at full, and Mann calling signals,
is an outfit that promises to be a
great ground-gaining combination. Sil
ver ambled over the final chalkmark
for three touchdowns in the Fort Scott
game, and played havoc with the op
ponents' line. McCormick and Baxter, j
halfbacks, can also be counted on for'
substantial gains. Rispin, Hamilton,
and Stewart are reserve backfield men !
who may" get a chance to play.
