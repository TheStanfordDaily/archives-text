# VARSITY DEBATERS ENTER TRIANGLAR TILT THIS EVENING
## Littler, Weigel, and Lewis Will Uphold Cardinal Against U. C., U. S. C. 
### 
Stanford's varsity debaters will spcak
from three platforms at 8 o'clock to
night in their first contest of the year
and in what promises to be, from the
standpoint of popular interest, the big
gest debate in which they have ever
engaged.
"Coolidge vs. Davis vs. La Follette"
is the subject. Robert Littler, Stanley
Weigel, and Robert Lewis are the speak
ers. San Francisco, Berkeley, and Los
Angeles are the places. California and
the University of Southern California
are the opponents.
Campus interest naturally centers on
the forensic tilt in the Native Sons
Auditorium, 414 Mason street, San Fran
cisco, in which Littler will defend
Coolidge against Bernard Brennan of
U. S. C. and Bernard Witkin of Cali
fornia.
U. S. C. Man Experienced
Brennan \yjll call to his aid in support
ing Davis all the experience and fire
which he has gained in twenty-three in
tercollegiate contests. In his long career
lie has gained the reputation of being the
best debater in his university.
In Witkin, La Follette will have a
supporter who is a veteran of two inter
collegitae meets with British Columbia,
of the radio debate last year against
Oregon, and of the criminal syndicalism
law argument against U. S. C. Witkin
and Brennan will meet for the second
time tomorrow.
Robert Littler has been termed by sev
eral college forensic coaches the best
debater on the Facific coast. He first be
came prominent at Stanford when he
won the Joffre medal contest last year.
Previously he was the outstanding orator
of Willamette University, where he
studied in 1921 and 1922.
Since coming here in the fall of 1923,
Littler has spoken in the annual tri-
angular debate against California and
the University of Southern California
and in the Pacific Coast Extemporaneous
Speaking Contest in addition to his work
in the Joffre meet. More recently he has
been campaigning for the Republican
party. He will take the platform to
night for the eighteenth time in the in
terests of President Coolidge.
Dr. Jordan will preside at the San
Francisco meeting. There, as in the
other cities, no regular judges will ren
der decisions. The audience will take
a straw vote on the presidential candi
date before the debate starts, and will
ballot for a second time at the conclusion
of the speeches. The change in the totals
will indicate roughly the ability of the
speakers to alter the opinions of their
hearers.
Aim to Interest Audience
This plan is looked upon as a step
toward the Oxford idea of insuring as
interesting a debate as possible from the
standpoint of the audience, and of elimi
nating the necessity for formal choice ol
the winner.
The contest in the Native Sons' Audi
torium has been widely advertised by
posters and radio announcements
throughout San Francisco and the bay
region, and a large crowd is cxpcctcd.
An admission charge of 35 cents will be
made for the general public, but students

of the competing universities will be ad
mitted on student body cards.
Stanley Weigel of Stanford will speak
in favor of Davis' candidacy in Berke
ley. He is a veteran of the triangular
debate last year, and has been chosen to
represent the Cardinal in the extempo
raneous speaking contest this winter. He
has a marked appeal for any audience
before whom he appears.
Robert Lewis L. A. Speaker
Opposing Weigel will be Richard Petty
of California, a Coolidge adherent, and
William Barbour of U. S. C., a La
Follettc supporter, who has engaged in
twenty intercollegiate debates.
In Los Angeles the Cardinal will be
represented by Robert Lewis, who will
argue for the Wisconsin senator. Lewis
is an experienced speaker. He made a
hit when he spoke in the southern city
two years ago in a public speaking con
test. Against him will be pitted Ray
mond Stanbury of California and Ned
Lewis, president of the associated stu
dents of U. S. C., who favor Davis and
Coolidge. Both are seasoned orators.
Stanford students who contemplate
making the tirp to San Francisco tonight
are urged to communicate immediately
with Ray Bruce at the Phi Sigma Kappa
house or in room 211 of the Engljsh
building. Bruce has arranged for busses
which will run from the campus direct
to the Native Son's Auditorium.
Not a single coach at Oxford is paid
for his services. Captains and alumni
who have played on the teams coach
the teams without compensation finan
cially.
