# U. S. C. Football Rally Slated For Wednesday Night
## 
### 
The Cardinal rooters will whet their
knives for battle Wednesday evening
j when the Rally committee stages its j
I first big rally of the year.
The noise will be broadcasted from
the pavilion, and it is expected the
rumble will be heard without difficulty
in the camp of the Trojans, to add to ,
their already overflowing cup of sor-,
| row, disappointment, premonitions, j
i and unkind kismet.
Besides generating the usual din and
roar, Stanford rooters will be taught
the new U. S. C. song under the tute
lage of Yell Leader "Dutch" McCallis
ter. The song is by Alice Dodds and
Margaret Cosgrave and won the re
cent Rally committee song contest.
