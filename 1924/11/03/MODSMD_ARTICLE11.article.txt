# BABES BEGIN FINAL WORKOUTS BEFORE "LITTLE BIG GAME"
## Hunt Depends on Backfield To Complete Versatile 1928 Combination 
### Douglas Meservey 
"Husky" Hunt begins today on the!
last week of practice before the "Little
Big Game." Last year, with the pre
game dope against him, he succeeded
in overcoming the California Cubs, 12
to 0. This year, with a successful
schedule behind him. marred only by
the U. S. C. defeat, Hunt is again hope- â– 
ful of a Cardinal victory.
One of Hunt's hopes is founded on a
backfield which has more prospects ;
than any backfield of many years pre
vious. Last Friday, this fact was not
so apparent because of "Husky's" de
sire to try his reserves, but there is
110 doubt but that his backs are capa
ble of us much punch as were those
of the 1927 eleven-
Nichols Shows Up Well
And still another possible star was
found in the game against San Mateo
Junior College when Nichols, playing
half and safety, showed up so well.
He had a capable rival in Bill
Lawrence, former all-state prep half
back, of the junior college squad, butj
the way Nichols used his hips and
legs in running back punts brought
back memories of Dick Hyland.
Hoffman also showed improvement
in his most apparent deficiency, line-;
bucking. Against him was a heavy, fast
forward wall but its resistance did
not seem to bother him as formerly, i
Gifford May Make End
The ends have given Hunt a little
worry this season but the substitution
of Gifford on one wing did not seem
at all bad and he may be a possible;
solution to that problem. Vincent! and
Dennis, however, are crowding him,!
l'or Lawrence's end sweeps in the
game Friday were responsible for
most of San Mateo's gains.
Two bright spots in scrimmage or
signal practice this week should be:
the possible re-entry into the line-up of
Altaffer and Millage. The former, in
jured at the first of the year and out
since that time, will give Hill and j
Pabst a good run for a half position.
Millage, whose absence has affected
the backfield's punch to some extent,
is nearly fit for action with the healing
of the broken blood vessel in his foot.
His return should be all that is needed!
to send a versatile backfield against
the Cubs this Saturdav.
