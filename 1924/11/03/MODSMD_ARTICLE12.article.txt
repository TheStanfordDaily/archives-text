Stanford University, Octtobcr 31.
To the Students of Stanford
University:
■In the early part of last week a
certain Stanford tradition was disre
garded by some unknown person,
supposedly a freshman. The frosh
class as a whole was as much sur
prised as the rest of the student body
at this act.
At a recent meeting of the class of
'28, expressions of opinion on this
matter showed that the freshmen
were as indignant as the rest of the
students of the University. This act,
if done by a frosh, was without the
sanction or knowledge of the class.
We, the class of '28, arc striving to
uphold Stanford traditions -and fulfil
our obligations as Stanford men and
women.
