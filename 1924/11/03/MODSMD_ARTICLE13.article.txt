# VARSITY GRIDDERS SHOW NEW PUNCH AGAINST BRONCOS
## 
### David Meiklejohn 
Stanford, showing more power, more
efficient teamwork, and displaying a pow
erful defense was easily the victor over
Santa Clara last Friday.
It can hardly be said of the Cards that j
they were weak in the pinches, consid
ering the fact that Captain Jim Lawson
and Ernie Nevers were on the bench.
It was a well-oiled offense that carried 1
the ball from within twenty yards of the
Stanford goal to a touchdown, using j
straight football plays.
There was power behind the smashing j
drives of the backfield and power in each
attack made by the line.
Stanford made more touchdowns in
the Missionite game in proportion to i
yardage gained than in any game this :
season. That might be a proof that the ,
Cards have learned where the opposite I
goal line was and how to get to it with
the least effort.
The Missionites were not a weak team.
Several times the Broncs made con
sistent gains through the Cardinal line
for First downs. The loss of "Red" Chis
holm in the first quarter slowed up the
Santa Clara offense, and it failed to
display any punch thereafter.
Passing is becoming more of a strong
forte with Stanford in every game. Not
j only were the greater percentage of trials
j completed, but there was also some yard
! age attached.
Ihe baekfield is still working a little
raggedly and listlessly. Stanford lost
1 two good opportunities to score because
|of fumbles within scoring distance. There
j was a bit of ragged tackling intermingled
with the surprising showing of the
Cardinal offense, but on the whole the
game was a good indication that the
| Cards are not going backward, but are
improving with every report of the
timekeeper's gun.
j Johnny Garthwaite, playing at half
j back, showed up well on the open field.
He is a little hesitant as yet, and is prone
to keep ahead of his interference. He
j made a pretty catch of Cleaveland's long
pas and nearly broke away for a touch
down. It toook speed to get as far down
as Garthwaite did and still give the
; pascr an opportunity to keep rid of the
; opposing tacklers.
The Red-shirts need have little to fear
Trom the Trojans next Saturday. U. S. C.
j has a strong team, undoubtedly, but it
is a brawny aggregation rather than
brainy. California won from the Tro
jans because the Bears were smart and
the southerners were a long time real
izing that the Bruins meant business.
Probably the strongest part of the
U. S. C. team is concentrated in the line,
but with.as strong a line as the Cards
boast it should be a fifty-fifty proposi
tion. In addition, Stanford has two full
backs which can penetrate practically
any defense, using coast teams as a com
parison.

Stanford, showing more power, more
efficient teamwork, and displaying a pow
erful defense was easily the victor over
Santa Clara last Friday.
It can hardly be said of the Cards that j
they were weak in the pinches, consid
ering the fact that Captain Jim Lawson
and Ernie Nevers were on the bench.
It was a well-oiled offense that carried 1
the ball from within twenty yards of the
Stanford goal to a touchdown, using j
straight football plays.
There was power behind the smashing j
drives of the backfield and power in each
attack made by the line.
Stanford made more touchdowns in
the Missionite game in proportion to i
yardage gained than in any game this :
season. That might be a proof that the ,
Cards have learned where the opposite I
goal line was and how to get to it with
the least effort.
The Missionites were not a weak team.
Several times the Broncs made con
sistent gains through the Cardinal line
for First downs. The loss of "Red" Chis
holm in the first quarter slowed up the
Santa Clara offense, and it failed to
display any punch thereafter.
Passing is becoming more of a strong
forte with Stanford in every game. Not
j only were the greater percentage of trials
j completed, but there was also some yard
! age attached.
Ihe baekfield is still working a little
raggedly and listlessly. Stanford lost
1 two good opportunities to score because
|of fumbles within scoring distance. There
j was a bit of ragged tackling intermingled
with the surprising showing of the
Cardinal offense, but on the whole the
game was a good indication that the
| Cards are not going backward, but are
improving with every report of the
timekeeper's gun.
