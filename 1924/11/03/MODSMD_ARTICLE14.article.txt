# SOPHOMORES MEET SENIORS IN GRIDIRON CONTEST TOMORROW
## 
### 
With the odds slightly in their favor
because of their victory over the fresh
men, sophomore football men will
clash with the senior interclass eleven
on the freshman field at 4 p.m. tomor
row.
The '27 team upset the dope by
trouncing the highly touted first-year
gridders, 28 to 0, in their first start
of the year last Tuesday, and are at
present the favorites to cop the cham
pionship. The seniors battled to a
scoreless tie with the juniors a week
ago Saturday, but have made big gains
in reserve strength and in teamwork
since that time and are confident of
annexing the sophomores' scalps.
Coach Seraphim Tost of the "last
year's" has developed a fast, powerful
backfield and a moderately heavy line.
A muddy field compelled the sophs to
rely almost entirely upon straight
football* to advance the oval against
the babes, and their heavier line gave
them an advantage over the light year- [
ling defense.
Senior Line Heavy
The beefy senior outer wall will
force Post's men to reverse their tac
tics and to fall back upon trick for
mations, end runs, and passes for most
of their yardage. Smytlie and Weber
at half and Rehm at full went well
against the frosh and should have a
hand in the scoring against the sen
% I
iors tomorrow. McDougall will call sig-[
nals and do the punting. Crimmins and
Harvey are other capable backs.
"Oz" Osborne and Dick Fullerton
have collected on the '25 eleven the
heaviest line of the four classes, with
Maine at center as the outstanding
performer. Raffettto is the only man
on the sophomore team who tips the 1
scales at anything like the average
senior figure.
At the same time the junior squad
will meet the freshman team. Last
week the babes lost a game to the
sophomores 27-0, while the juniors
held the seniors to a scoreless tie. This
should give the juniors an easier game
than the seniors for tomorrow after
noon's program..
