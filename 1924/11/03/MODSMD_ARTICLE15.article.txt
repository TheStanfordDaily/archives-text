# NEAR-OFFICIAL REPORTS INDICATE TROJAN GAME OFF
## Press Dispatches From Los Angeles State That Contest Is Called Off By U.S.C. Authorities 
### 
I ATE this afternoon press dispatches from Southern California stated thai
the Stanford-U. S. C. game had been called off. Paul Davis, Graduat«
Manager, said that he had heard the rumor, but had received no official word
Dr. W. H. Barrow issued the following statement regarding the affair:
"We have through a press dispatch received unofficial
information that the U. S. C.-Stanford game has been called
off by U. S. C. authorities. Neither the Graduate Manager nor
I have received any official communication verifying or deny

can appreciate the feeling of U. S. C. authorities in this
matter, but we hoped and expected when our announcement
of severance of relations was made that it would in no way
affect the game next Saturday.
It is regrettable also that the burden of this disagreement
between colleges should be borne in part by the public who
had made plans to attend the game. I am very sorry and
hope the report is incorrect." W. H. BARROW.

* The authority who issued the
news of the cancellation was Ned
Lewis, President of the Associated

as follows:
"Congratulations splendid action
taken to clean up athletic situa

Branch pulling for you to win next
Saturday. Have no game that day
and will be there strong rooting
for you. Hope new conditions will
release some basketball dates for
us to get together on when you
down here for game."
Contrary to general supposition, the
action came not entirely as a result of
the fight over the eligibility of Cole
and other U. S. C. players, but because
of a series of unpleasant disagree
