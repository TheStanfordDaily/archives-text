# NEAR-OFFICIAL REPORTS INDICATE TROJAN GAME OFF
## Press Dispatches From Los Angeles State That Contest Is Called Off By U.S.C. Authorities 
### 
I ATE this afternoon press dispatches from Southern California stated thai
the Stanford-U. S. C. game had been called off. Paul Davis, GraduatÂ«
Manager, said that he had heard the rumor, but had received no official word
Dr. W. H. Barrow issued the following statement regarding the affair:
"We have through a press dispatch received unofficial
information that the U. S. C.-Stanford game has been called
off by U. S. C. authorities. Neither the Graduate Manager nor
I have received any official communication verifying or deny
ing this. I can only say that if it is true I am very sorry. I
can appreciate the feeling of U. S. C. authorities in this
matter, but we hoped and expected when our announcement
of severance of relations was made that it would in no way
affect the game next Saturday.
It is regrettable also that the burden of this disagreement
between colleges should be borne in part by the public who
had made plans to attend the game. I am very sorry and
hope the report is incorrect." W. H. BARROW.

* The authority who issued the
news of the cancellation was Ned
Lewis, President of the Associated
Students of U. S. C.
Any fear of a sectional battle be
tween northern and southern univer
sities was set at rest today on the re
ceipt of a telegram from H. W. Cun
ningham, Graduate Manager of the
University of California, Southern
Branch. The contents of the wire were
as follows:
"Congratulations splendid action
taken to clean up athletic situa
tion this end of state. Southern
Branch pulling for you to win next
Saturday. Have no game that day
and will be there strong rooting
for you. Hope new conditions will
release some basketball dates for
us to get together on when you
down here for game."
Contrary to general supposition, the
action came not entirely as a result of
the fight over the eligibility of Cole
and other U. S. C. players, but because
of a series of unpleasant disagree
ments which have come up in the last
few years.
Statement Sent U. S. C.
The statement sent to the President
of the Associated Students of U. S. C.
was as follows:
Mr. N. E. Lewis, President,
Associated Students,
University of Southern California,
Dear Sir:
The bodies charged with the
maintenance of intercollegiate ath
letic competition at the University
of California and Stanford Univer
sity have regretfully come to the
conclusion that the continuance of
athletic relations with the Univer
sity of Southern California is not
conducive to the best interests of
intercollegiate sport. They have
therefore determined that no fur
ther athletic contests with the
University of Southern California
will be scheduled by either the
University of California or Stan
ford University after the close of
the present football season.
Yours very truly,
Board of Athletic Control,
Stanford University,
T. M. WILLIAMS, Chairman.
Associated Students, University
of California,
A. C. BOYER, President.
Trojan Society Holds Meeting
Saturday night, after the California
game, the Trojan Society, the alumni
organization of the State, held an in
formal meeting in San Francisco to
protest the playing of the Stanford
game next Saturday.
H. J. Stonier, comptroller of the
University of Southern California, and
acting alumni secretary, declared that
the Trojan Society would have but
recommendatory weight in the final
consideration of the situation. The
final say rests with the faculty com
mittee of the University of Southern
California.
