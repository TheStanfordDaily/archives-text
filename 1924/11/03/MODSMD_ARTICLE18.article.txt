# Tomorrow
## 
### 
Only a few of us here on the campus are entitled to smear crosses
over a ballot tomorrow, and the probabilities are that those few will turn
out. The percentage of voters who actually vote is declining with suc
cessive elections, but it seems that broad-gauged, intelligent men and
women would be found in a university community more surely than any
where else. And that is the voting type.
This election has developed very definite lines of cleavage, and it seems
that, this year, anybody with any preference at all would feel that his vote
would be a factor in the old-fashioned "saving the country." It is up to
you to decide which name would look best on White House stationery
and then, if you can, help to put it there.
