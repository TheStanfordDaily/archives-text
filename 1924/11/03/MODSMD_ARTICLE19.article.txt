A certain engagement with the University of Southern California is
situated just a few leaves ahead in the calendar, and not too many miles
down the road. The large number of Stanford people who witnessed the
California-U, S. C. bout at Berkeley Saturday saw clearly two things—
first, that Stanford compares favorably with either of the two teams, and
second, that Stanford nevertheless will need a rubber-band quality of ex
tending herself. Moreover, it was obvious on the face of it that next Sat
urday's game will be a whale.
There are a few things as enjoyable as a long trip on the heels of the
team, but not many. Portland was too far away; Berkeley is just a few
steps —unless, of course, you happen to be walking. The plans are laid
for a rare time on the way to Los Angeles, there, and coming back. Almost
everybody has his progress pretty well mapped out and underwritten, and
most of those who haven't wish they had.
This is not merely a chance to watch a good football game, or to put
your shoulder to the Stanford wheeel, or to see a bit of the world between
classes. It is all of them, and a right good party to boot. Some will stay
away because of insuperable financial obstacles. With them we sympa
thize. Others will not go because they have work which must be done, and
sufficient strength of character to stay here and do it. Those we admire.
A few will sit around here because they are too listless or indifferent to
make the effort. They amaze us.
For more reasons than one, this will be a game for all Stanford citizens
to see, and to draw conclusions therefrom. So if you must queen Saturday
evening, queen in Los Angeles and avoid the lock-out rules.
FOUR MEN have been selected as Stanford's candidates for a Rhodes
Scholarship. The Daily feels called upon to create a more or less in
volved situation by wishing all four of them the best luck in the world.
