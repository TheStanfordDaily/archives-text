Engineers. In speaking of the lecture
tomorrow, Dr. Ryan remarked:
"It will be based upon intelligently
interpreted experience in the power
industry which, with the communica
tion industry, is rapidly remaking the,
foundations of our civilization.
"An address by a president of one
of the national engineering societies,
to the students of a Pacific Coast uni
versity, can, in the nature of things,
hardly occur more than two or three
times in a generation. Every prospec
tive Stanford engineer must surely
hear Dr. Osgood if he possibly can."
