Julius, the Freshman (everybody
knows Julius), says that the sponsor
system is a failure. The situation has
become so bad that the senior guard- i
ians are now demanding matches
without even so much as offering to
exchange a cigarette for the light.
* * *
One sponsor even failed to have
the smoke when asked.

Julius says that his classmates are
very much dissatisfied with their in-'
structors. How are the new men to
present a decorous appearance when
their earthly guides can not tie a good
bow tie. Shoes have been known to
set outside freshmen's doors for days
without being shined. Recently one of
the very, very nicest fellows in the 1
1928 class caught a dreadful cold be- ■
cause he had been carelessly tucked
in.
* * *
Evidences of the sponsorial ineffi
ciency have been apparent to the stu
dent body as well. Whoever the let
tering instructor is, he should be
jacked up. The legend on the Law
Steps was painted in a deplorably un
skilled fashion. At any rate, that is
what some of the bearded gents on ■
the Engineering Corner say.

"What is worth doing is worth do
ing well," says Snubber Struggle
buggy, '24. "In years past there have 1
been paddlings which were well ad
ministered. Don't 1 know? Write your
own moral!"

A recommendation has been made
to the leaders of the Fall Charity
Drive that a portion of the funds col
lected be set aside to relieve suffering
of broken-down sponsors. The sugges
tion urges the establishment of a fund
with which to rent rooms in some
other hall for the use of those who
can't stand it any longer. In order to
be eligible for one of these substitute
free rooms, the sponsor has only to
follow his own impulses in respect to
one of the representative members of
the 1928 class. With restraint, of
course, with some restraint. The little
dears must not be hurt too badly—
unless the charity candidate doesn't
care if it is only a cell so long as it's
free.

Every resource, no matter how
feeble, should be used by 1927 to check
the tendency of 192& to become fat
lieaded. At present 1928 conceit has
reached the size that 1927 had at
tained only by winter quarter. At this
rate the freshman conceit record of
the present sophomores, which is no
mean mark, will have been passed
before the end of the football season.
* * *
Every resource, no matter how
feeble —Ha! One more sophomore
poster migh be laid down without un
dermining the class treasury too much. |
Even one of the "unofficial" promulga
tions would do. Anything! R. U. R.
