The Editor—Sir:
After reading Paul Ashe, Jr.,'s scath
ing report of the new U. S. C. song,
we feel like declining with thanks the
ten bucks we have not yet received,
and slinking into the darkness. At
least, we are glad our modest compo
sition pleased the judges, two of whom
we know to be honest-to-goodness mu
sicians, and the otber three reputed
to be able to judge "what's what." Did
Mr. Ashe ever stop and think that per
haps his rendition of the song might
have something to do with the effect?
Our student body singing is a great
deal like a slow motion camera. Eight
times as fast and eight times as much
pep would make pieces sound much
more as they were originally intended |
by—The Composers.
