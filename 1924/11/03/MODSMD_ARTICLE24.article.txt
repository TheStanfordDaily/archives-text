# Exclusion Act Prevents Student's Earning Money
## 
### 
The University of California is faced
by the problem of a Russian woman
student, who, % a recent interpretation
of the Exclusion act, is prevented from
matriculating in the university if she at
tempts to earn her college expenses.
It is provided in the act that students
may be admitted outside of their na
tional quota. The recent interpretation
put upon the act, however, "is that such
students must not engage in any labor
whatsoever while in the United States.
Those that intend to support themselves
while attending college must wait with
other immigrants to be admitted within
the quota.
A student not waiting to be admitted
in the quota has to have an affidavit from
his guardians pledging that he will be
supported and an affidavit from the
president of the university before he
arrives in the country that he will be
admitted to the university. He must
return to his country immediately after
graduation.
