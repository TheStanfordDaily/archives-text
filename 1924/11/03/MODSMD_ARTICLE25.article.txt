# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT

### 
The Editor—Sir :
Since viewpoints are welcomed in your
columns and the game with U. S. C.is
but a few days away with the "Big
Game" looming up with more and more
threat to Stanford, it might be well to
express an opinion regarding "Stanford
Spirit." To those who witnessed the
Santa Clara game on Friday and the
U. S. C.-California game Saturday the
lack of spirit on the part of the student
body at Stanford must have been appar
ent. Of course, not nearly the amount
of importance was attached to the Stan
ford game as the clash at Berkeley, but
at no time during the season has the
Stanford rooting section shown its spirit
as the followers of the Cardinal should,
and the attempt made so far this season
certainly lacks pep and originality, both
in the new song chosen for the U. S. C.
game and the crying need for new yells,
in addition to the rooting itself.
Possibly the song for the annual U. S.
C. encounter wil not be so important now
that relations are to be severed with
the Methodist school, but it seems that
in this, Stanford's last game at Los An
geles, our rooting section should make a
lasting impression.
Much discussion regarding the song is
heard over the campus and many of the
students who have not heard the second
choice song, which is conceded to be the
more original, are anxious to hear it and
pass judgment. Is it not possible to have
two songs for the U. S. C. game or is
the capacity of the rooter's skull limited
to one? I am enclosing a copy of the
"Horse Collar Hymn" with the sugges
tion that it be printed for the benefit of
the student body and given a "trial" be
fore the rally this week. It can do no
harm.

THE HORSE COLLAR HY.MN
By H. R. Harvey
In the days of ancient Trov,
So at least 'tis said,
The Greeks made the Trojans
See Red ! Red ! Red !
They built a great big wooden horse;
And tilled it up with men;
And when the Trojans took it,
'Twas a horse on them.
Chorus
Oh—we'll put a collar on the Trojan
horse,
A great big zero for their football force.
Count the score for Stanford, and the
rest will be—
HORSE COLLAR for U— S —C—.
Fight 'em up for Stanford;
Tear 'em shred from shred;
Show 'em that you're sons
Of the Red! Red! Red!
And when the game is over;
Then without remorse,
We'll place a wreath of lilies
On the Trojan horse.
More than 1500 people attended the
international debate held between Ox
ford and Cornell.

THE HORSE COLLAR HY.MN
By H. R. Harvey
In the days of ancient Trov,
So at least 'tis said,
The Greeks made the Trojans
See Red ! Red ! Red !
They built a great big wooden horse;
And tilled it up with men;
And when the Trojans took it,
'Twas a horse on them.
Chorus
Oh—we'll put a collar on the Trojan
horse,
A great big zero for their football force.
Count the score for Stanford, and the
rest will be—
HORSE COLLAR for U— S —C—.
Fight 'em up for Stanford;
Tear 'em shred from shred;
Show 'em that you're sons
Of the Red! Red! Red!
And when the game is over;
Then without remorse,
We'll place a wreath of lilies
On the Trojan horse.
More than 1500 people attended the
international debate held between Ox
ford and Cornell.
The Editor—Sir :
Since viewpoints are welcomed in your
columns and the game with U. S. C.is
but a few days away with the "Big
Game" looming up with more and more
threat to Stanford, it might be well to
express an opinion regarding "Stanford
Spirit." To those who witnessed the
Santa Clara game on Friday and the
U. S. C.-California game Saturday the
lack of spirit on the part of the student
body at Stanford must have been appar
ent. Of course, not nearly the amount
of importance was attached to the Stan
ford game as the clash at Berkeley, but
at no time during the season has the
Stanford rooting section shown its spirit
as the followers of the Cardinal should,
and the attempt made so far this season
certainly lacks pep and originality, both
in the new song chosen for the U. S. C.
game and the crying need for new yells,
in addition to the rooting itself.
Possibly the song for the annual U. S.
C. encounter wil not be so important now
that relations are to be severed with
the Methodist school, but it seems that
in this, Stanford's last game at Los An
geles, our rooting section should make a
lasting impression.
Much discussion regarding the song is
heard over the campus and many of the
students who have not heard the second
choice song, which is conceded to be the
more original, are anxious to hear it and
pass judgment. Is it not possible to have
two songs for the U. S. C. game or is
the capacity of the rooter's skull limited
to one? I am enclosing a copy of the
"Horse Collar Hymn" with the sugges
tion that it be printed for the benefit of
the student body and given a "trial" be
fore the rally this week. It can do no
harm.
