# Movie Stars Get Advance Dope on Game with U. S. C.

Constance and Norma Talmadge
should not lack for additions to their
movie colony rooting section for Stan
ford at the U. S. C. game, if matters at
the Santa Clara game have any portent.
Shortly after Friday's game had begun,
Stanford men on the hither side of the
rooting section had their attention di
verted from the scoring of the first
touchdown by the entrance of several
movie people, headed by Viola Dana and
"Lefty" Flynn, a former Yale football
star.
From then on the only thing that was
able to stop their interest in the inquest
being held on the field was the half-time
intermission. Even then, Miss Dana
stood on tiptoe to catch a glimpse of
the unlucky freshmen who attempted a
departure from the stadium.
