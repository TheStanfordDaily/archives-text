# BRUINS OUTSMART SOUTHERN ELEVEN IN CLOSE CONTEST
## Trojans Lose Spirit After California Team Makes First Touchdown 
### Stanford Angle 
California's 7 to 0 victory over U. S.
C. last Saturday came as more or less
of a surprise to those who had reports
from the south as to the smashing
Trojan aggregation.
Not only did California outplay U. S.
C., but they outsmarted the Trojans to
the extent of making the southerners
look weaker than was the case.
In the first place the Trojans were
sluggish and listless after California
had made the first score. They prac
tically handed the game to the Bears
by giving California all the breaks and
letting the Bruins take an upper hand.
U. C. Shows Headwork
It might be called hedging to say
that it was a case of brain against
brawn. But that was what it amounted
(o in the long run. IT. S. C. had a line
that should have stopped any Cali
fornia offensive play. Still Jimmy
Dixon had a hole three yards wide
when he drove ten yards for Cali
fornia's first touchdown. That was not
a case of the U. S. C. line being pushed
back, it was more of an example of
the unexpected, and the Bears used it
to a victorious advantage.
California kept the hall in U. S. C.
territory two-thirds of the game. Not
only that, but kept it within scoring
distance. It might be said to the credit
of Thomas, U. S. C. right tackle, that
because of his consistent game the
Trojans held the Bears to that one
lone touchdown.
Bruin Backfield Shines
The Bruin backfield played over its
head. Dixon was having the best day
of the season, especially on the kicks
and passes. Jabbs was able to gain
on every drive through the line. Imlay
was the shining star, however. Playing
at safety, Imlay showed all the qualifi
cations of being just the man for the
position. It was Imlay who allowed
one of Hawkins' punts to bounce on
the ground, scooping it up and running
it back practically to the point from
where it was kicked.
Carlson exhibited some brainy field
work at quarterback and kept the
California team working with a
smoothness far superior to that of the
Trojans.
Undoubtedly the strongest man in
the California line is Captain Babe
Horrell. Horrell played roving center
on the defense and made a great ma
jority of the spectacular tackles.
Mell and Huber, California ends,
were the stars of the game on the
defense. They stopped Trojan plays
behind the line time after time, and
kept U. S. C. from making yardage on
the greater percentage of passes by
nabbing the receiver in his tracks.

letting the Bruins take an upper hand.
U. C. Shows Headwork
It might be called hedging to say
that it was a case of brain against
brawn. But that was what it amounted
(o in the long run. IT. S. C. had a line
that should have stopped any Cali
fornia offensive play. Still Jimmy
Dixon had a hole three yards wide
when he drove ten yards for Cali
fornia's first touchdown. That was not
a case of the U. S. C. line being pushed
back, it was more of an example of
the unexpected, and the Bears used it
to a victorious advantage.
California kept the hall in U. S. C.
territory two-thirds of the game. Not
only that, but kept it within scoring
distance. It might be said to the credit
of Thomas, U. S. C. right tackle, that
because of his consistent game the
Trojans held the Bears to that one
lone touchdown.
Bruin Backfield Shines
The Bruin backfield played over its
head. Dixon was having the best day
of the season, especially on the kicks
and passes. Jabbs was able to gain
on every drive through the line. Imlay
was the shining star, however. Playing
at safety, Imlay showed all the qualifi
cations of being just the man for the
position. It was Imlay who allowed
one of Hawkins' punts to bounce on
the ground, scooping it up and running
it back practically to the point from
where it was kicked.
Carlson exhibited some brainy field
work at quarterback and kept the
California team working with a
smoothness far superior to that of the
Trojans.
Undoubtedly the strongest man in
the California line is Captain Babe
Horrell. Horrell played roving center
on the defense and made a great ma
jority of the spectacular tackles.
Mell and Huber, California ends,
were the stars of the game on the
defense. They stopped Trojan plays
behind the line time after time, and
kept U. S. C. from making yardage on
the greater percentage of passes by
nabbing the receiver in his tracks.
California's 7 to 0 victory over U. S.
C. last Saturday came as more or less
of a surprise to those who had reports
from the south as to the smashing
Trojan aggregation.
Not only did California outplay U. S.
C., but they outsmarted the Trojans to
the extent of making the southerners
look weaker than was the case.
In the first place the Trojans were
sluggish and listless after California
had made the first score. They prac
tically handed the game to the Bears
by giving California all the breaks and
letting the Bruins take an upper hand.
