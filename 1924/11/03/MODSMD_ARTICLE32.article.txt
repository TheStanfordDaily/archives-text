## 
### 
The game between the Stanford Grays
and the Santa Clara Reserves, which was
scheduled for last Saturday morning,
was postponed at the last moment, and
will be played tomorrow afternoon at
4 o'clock.
1 he line-up for the Grays, as given out
by Coach Hal Davis this morning fol

mons; left guard, Stevenson; center,
Graham; right guard, Macabee or
Shoales; right tackle, Evans; right end,
Wolf; quarter, Mann; left half, McCor

Silver.
There may be some changes in this
line-up. Potts may be sent in at one
of the tackle positions; Rispin may play
in McCormick's position if the latter is
not able to play. McCormick has been
out of the game because of a cracked
rib. If Baldwin, who reported for prac
tice for the first time Friday, can learn
the signals in time he may start at quar
ter. In that event, Dungan, who is ndto
substitute quarterback, will be changed
to half.
The Santa Clara line-up has not been
announced, but, according to Hal Davis,
will be made up of members of the Santa
Clara varsity, freshmen, and reserve
squads.
