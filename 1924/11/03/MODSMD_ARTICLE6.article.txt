"Contributions to the United Cam
paign Fund total $G22.44," said Profes- ■
sor H. R. Fairclough, chairman of the:
committee, this morning. "Many of;
the organizations have not turned in
their amounts; so the drive will not
officially close before Wednesday.
"The campaign, which is officially!
authorized for the fall quarter by the ■
Social Service Board, is the chance
for 'World Service.' Intelligent inter-;
est in the needs and values of the j
cause —and a one hundred per cent
canvass —is all that is needed to make j
it a success.
"All the great American colleges;
maintain projects similar to the Stan-|
ford-in-Cliina movement. Our fundsJ
will help support Tracy K. Jones, the'
Y. M. C. A. secretary for all students j
in China. The deliberate purpose of
the Y. M. C. A. is to help produce'
leaders of high ideals,
"The Russian Relief offers one of !
the few opportunities to actually put :
the needy on their own responsibili-:
ties to aid themselves. The destitute 1
refugees are of such a high intellec-j
tual type that if money can be secured j
to pay their transportation to France, j
where there is work, tl#> situation will
take care of itself.
"There has been much said of the
Greek Refugees, who, as a result of j
the Smyran disaster, were driven from'
their homes. One million and a half (
have fled to Greece —hungry, naked,
destitute. Money must be secured for,
emergency relief, and also for con !
structive measures, or thousands will,
die within the next few months."
