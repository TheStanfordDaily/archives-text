# SIGMA DELTA CHI FOSTERS BUMMING CONTEST TO U.S.C.
## Card Economy Sweepstakes Will Be Held on State Highway Course 
### 
Southward ho —bo!
If Bill Brogan, ancient patron of
Stanford traditions, can get to Los
Angeles for nothing next week-end, he
will find himself on the receiving end
of a very considerable award —pro-
vided, of course, that he fulfill a few
other simple conditions. But that
comes later.
Under the auspices of Sigma Delta
Chi, professional journalistic frater
nity, there will be conducted, next Fri
day and Saturday, a contest that is
the uniquest of the unique. It liae been
christened the Stanford Economy
Sweepstakes, and it will be just that
—for nothing but economy will win the
purse. Now for a few details.
The course selected for the sweep
stakes is the State Highway. The start
will be made from the Law Steps on
the Quad at 12:10 noon Friday, and
the finish, at a point in Los Angeles,
to be specified later.
This distance may be covered afoot,
on horseback, or by motor vehicle, but
—it shall not, and MUST not, cost the
contestant one little red penny, wheth
er for transportation, food, or inci
dentals of any kind. Said contestant
shall not accept rides from Stanford
men (or women), nor shall he make
any previous arrangements for trans
portation.
Just one exception to the above con
ditions is permissible. When the con
testant arrives within the radius of
the Los Angeles electric railway lin«?s,
he may, if he wishes, board a cu\
(This does not mean the Los Angeles
city limits, but a point some hundred
and fifty miles farther south.) This
provision is made in order that con
testants need not miss the game Sat
urday afternoon, just because their
; last "lift" does not take them all the
| way to their destination.
The entire contest will be conducted
on the honor system. No watch will
I be kept over the participants during
any part of the trip; it is required only
I that each man sign an honor statement
that he has violated none of the rules
! of the competition.
The prizes to be given will consist
; of merchandise, donated by Palo Alto
merchants, and will have an aggregate'
; value of about $50.

be made before twelve midnight,
Thulisday, November 6, and must be

I These blanks, when properly filled out,
- may be turned in at the Daily Palo
j Alto office, in person or by mail, or
