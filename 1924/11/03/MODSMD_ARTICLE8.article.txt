# SOUTHERN BRANCH OF U. C. INCLUDED IN SPORT SCHEDULE
## 
### 
Stanford and the University of Cali
fornia, Southern Branch, have entered
into negotiations which will probably
result in the establishment of per
manent athletic relations between the
two institutions, according to an an
nouncement from the graduate mana
ger's office.
Boxing, basketball, and baseball
teams representing the two universi
ties will meet this year, and local
authorities are hoping to add the
southerners to the Stanford football
schedule for 1925. No definite dates
have yet been set.
The inauguration of athletic contests
between Stanford and the University
of California, Southern Branch, comes
as the result of an invitation extended
by the authorities of the former in
stitution. Southern Branch is the sec
ond Southern California institution to
be taken on the Stanford schedule in
the past two years. Last season the
Cardinal football team met Occidental
in Los Angeles for the first time.
The eligibility and scholastic regu
lations of Southern Branch are identi
cal with those of Stanford, and, as the
southern university has taken a prom
inent place on the athletic map, con
tests between the Cards and the
Grizzlies will probably excite a great
deal of interest.
In line with the same policy, the
University of California met Pomona
on the gridiron for the first time this
year. The tendency toward intersec
tional games within the state of Cali
fornia is growing every year, and
seems to assure the sporting public of
even better athletic contests in the
future.
