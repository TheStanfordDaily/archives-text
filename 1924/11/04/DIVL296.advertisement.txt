You can cook on every inch of
the new Wedgewood's cast iron
closed top. All space around and
■ between burners gets hot. Uten
sils don't tip on smooth, flat top.
Front burners alone heat whole
top as hot as you ordinarily want
it. Heat that otherwise would be
wasted is held in cast iron top and
keeps back kettles boiling without
using back burners.
