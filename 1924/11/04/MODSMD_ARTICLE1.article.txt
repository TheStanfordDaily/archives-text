# WINNING ORATOR IN TRI-DEBATE NOT DESIGNATED
## Stanford Men Win Applause Of Hearers in Berkeley, San Francisco 
### Al Post 
No decision was rendered in the
triangular debate last night for the
speakers from Stanford, C!a\ifornia,
and U. S. C. cast aside all appeal to
the committee of judges and argued
with an audience of 400 for votes for
the major presidential candidates.
The debate was held in the Native,
Sons Auditorium in San Francisco,
with Dr. Jordan of Stanford presiding.
Although indecisive as far as estab-;
lishing the superiority of any one uni
versity is concerned, the contest sue- j
ceeded in bringing out what Stanford's |
debating coach, J. G. Emerson, termed I
the finest exhibition of university for-1
eusic talent that he had ever listened!
to.
"I have heard all three speakers on
previous occasions." Emerson stated,'
"and I consider that each man made
the best showing of his career last
night. 1 cannot give any debater too
much praise. The reason for their suc
cess lies in the fact that they had a
real question to discuss instead of the
usual theoretic subject."
Straw Vote Taken
In straw votes taken in the audience
before and after the speeches it was
seen that Coolidge gained 21 votes,
LaFollette 10, and Davis 10 in the sec
ond balloting.
Through an error in tabulating the
ballots the total number of votes cast j
-was not obtained. From the number
of persons who changed their vote in
the second poll it will be seen that
Robert Littler of Stanford, the Cool
idge speaker, made the greatest num
ber of converts, while Bernard Bren- j
j nan of U. S. C., speaking for Davis, I
made the biggest percentage gain
since Davis had fewer votes to begin
I with.
Brennan displayed masterful skill in
handling his audience, first appealing
' to them with humor and good nature
j and then introducing arguments for
I his candidate after he had captivated
them with his own personality. He was
the suave, polished gentleman through
out, and elicited continuous applause
from his hearers.
Sportsmanship Praised
Brennan complimented the Stanford
and California representatives on the
, high type of sportsmanship which they
had always showed towards his insti
tution, and expressed his pleasure in
| seeing debating relations between the
I three schools continue unimpaired
even though athletics relations are
broken off.
Robert Littler showed himself with
out a peer in advancing class argu
ments for Coolidge. His logic was ab
solutely faultless. He rarely employed
humor in his speech, but he did not
need it to convince his audience.
Bernard Witkin of California upheld
LaFollette in a speech pleading for
liberal ideals in the finest sense and i
entirely lacking in the bombast and
demagoguery usually associated with
oratory for a radical cause.
At a debate held simultaneously at
Wheeler hall in Berkeley Stanley
Weigel argued the Davis cause for
Stanford against William Barber of,
U. S. C. and Richard Petry of Cali
fornia, LaFollette and Coolidge sup-j
porters respectively.
Attendance Large
One thousand persons heard the
speakers, but no poll was taken. Ac
cording to unbiased reports, Weigel
received the most applause. Debating
coaches from both California and IT.
S. C. gave him the victory, 'the Stan
ford man, like Brennan of the southern
institution, is a past master in pre-1
senting his case in a manner which
secures the good will and support of
his audience.
No accounts have yet been received
of the debate held in Los Angeles, I
which was similar to the Berkeley and j
San Francisco meetings in that no
formal decision was rendered. Robert
Lewis was Stanford's representative
in the southern city, speaking for La-
Follette. He is expected to return to
the campus sometime tomorrow with j
a full report of the proceedings.

debating coach, J. G. Emerson, termed I
the finest exhibition of university for-1

Straw Vote Taken
In straw votes taken in the audience
before and after the speeches it was
seen that Coolidge gained 21 votes,
LaFollette 10, and Davis 10 in the sec
ond balloting.
Through an error in tabulating the
ballots the total number of votes cast j
-was not obtained. From the number
of persons who changed their vote in
the second poll it will be seen that
Robert Littler of Stanford, the Cool
idge speaker, made the greatest num
ber of converts, while Bernard Bren- j
j nan of U. S. C., speaking for Davis, I
made the biggest percentage gain
since Davis had fewer votes to begin
I with.
Brennan displayed masterful skill in
handling his audience, first appealing
' to them with humor and good nature
j and then introducing arguments for
I his candidate after he had captivated
them with his own personality. He was
the suave, polished gentleman through
out, and elicited continuous applause
from his hearers.
Sportsmanship Praised
Brennan complimented the Stanford
and California representatives on the
, high type of sportsmanship which they
had always showed towards his insti
tution, and expressed his pleasure in
| seeing debating relations between the
I three schools continue unimpaired
even though athletics relations are
broken off.
Robert Littler showed himself with
out a peer in advancing class argu
ments for Coolidge. His logic was ab
solutely faultless. He rarely employed
humor in his speech, but he did not
need it to convince his audience.
Bernard Witkin of California upheld
LaFollette in a speech pleading for
liberal ideals in the finest sense and i
entirely lacking in the bombast and
demagoguery usually associated with
oratory for a radical cause.
At a debate held simultaneously at
Wheeler hall in Berkeley Stanley
Weigel argued the Davis cause for
Stanford against William Barber of,
