# ELECTION RETURNS TO BE GIVEN OVER RADIO THIS EVENING
## 
### 
Radio and special wires will be used
in getting the election returns in the
Assembly hall tonight. It is expected
that reports will start coming between
7 and 7:30 o'clock, and will continue
until definite results are known.
The election news will take the
place of the regular Tuesday evening
lecture, under the auspices "of the com
mittee on public exercises.
A radio, equipped with loud speaker,
will be used to announce results, and
also for purposes of entertainment. A
direct wire from the San Francisco
Examiner will give the votes from all
over the United States, and the totals
will be flashed on the screen.
Election returns four years ago
when Warren G. Harding was elected
were handled in a similar manner.
"Women may sign up to go to the
Assembly hall, but they must check in
by 12 o'clock," said Carolan Strouse,
president of Associated Women, today.
