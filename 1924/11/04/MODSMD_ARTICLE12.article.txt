### 
A Stanford rooting section three thou
sand miles away will add its lusty cheers j
to those of the undergraduates and i
alumni in the California Memorial j
stadium the day of the Big Game.
All former Redshirts will gather at the
Stanford club meeting in New York City
'at the time the game is in progress and
there they will hear play by play the re- |
suits of the game. The affair will be in
the nature of a dinner.
Plans are also in the air to make the
Stanford club dinner a joint function
with the eastern University of Cali
fornia club. If this is done the guests
can pass cyanide sandwiches back and j
forth with much gusto between halves.
