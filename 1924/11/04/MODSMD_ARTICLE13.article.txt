# MONEY REFUNDING ALL THAT REMAINS OF SOUTHERN GAME
## Return of Rooters' Tickets to Be Next Week; Rally Is Called Off 
### 
With all hopes and anticipations for
a Stanford-Trojan football game shat
tered, sellers of a score of different 1
kinds of tickets must begin the tre
mendous task of cancelling reserva-1
tions and returning money, and the
Board of Athletic Control must find
some substitute for the scheduled
game.
It is probable a game can be ar
ranged for "Pop" Warner's big red
eleven so that it won't have to re
main idle this week. As yet no plans
have been completed for such a game,
although offers have been received
from several high-calibered teams, all
of whom would like to tangle with
the Redshirts.
Mony paid for rooters' tickets and
general admission tickets to the game
will be refunded by the Graduate
Manager's office. It will be impossible
to start this work until the middle of
next week, and students are requested
to hold their tickets until the an- !
nouncement of the time and place of
refund is made.
The Southern Pacific has announced
that all railroad tickets will be taken
back at once. Reservations for the
dinners at the Alexandria and Bilt
more have been automatically can
celled by the management of both
hotels.
As soon as possible the Rally com-1
mittee will set about refunding the
money taken in on the pools to send
students to the U. S. C. game. Led
Peter, chairman of the committee, had
not determined how or when this
could be done at noon today.
The "rally which was to have been
held tomorrow night has been called
off. Likewise, the bumming contest
announced by Sigma Delta Chi has
fallen by the roadside.
The question concerning the stand
ing in the Pacific Coast conference of
Stanford and U. S. C. must remain un
settled until the next meeting of the
conference. Since U. S. C. called off
the game it is probable that it will
forfeit. This may have an important
bearing upon the final conference
standing, should both Stanford and
California be defeated in the remain-
I ing conference clashes.
