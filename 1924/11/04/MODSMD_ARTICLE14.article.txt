# C. R. Hall Investigating Feeding Habits of Birds
## 
### 
Professor C. R. Hall, agent of the
U. S. Department of Agriculture, is
investigating the food habits of the
birds of Pyramid lake, Nevada, in
order to find out if they are destroying
the supply of edible fish.
The sportsmen of the district are
clamoring for the destruction of the
birds, claiming that they ruin fishing.
On the other hand, the white pelicans,
cormorants, gulls and tern are an asset
to the desert landscape. The birds' de
fenders say that they eat only the lit
tle fish such as minnows and suckers
and do not harm game fish.
Professor Hall has collected bones,
scales, and other remains of the fish
in the rookeries of the birds, and is
now comparing them with the fleh in
the Stanford collection.
