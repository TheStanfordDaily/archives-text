# CARD INTEREST CENTERS UPON BABE GRIDDERS
## Odds Favor California Cubs Over Stanford Babes In Annual Tilt 
### Douglas Meservey 
With nothing but blue smoke left
of the intended U. S. C.-Stanford var
sity game this Saturday, all eyes are
now on the approaching "Little Big
Game." It was to have shared honors
on the gridiron stage with the varsity
entanglement but since the latter's
cancellation, it looks as though the
Card and California freshmen will
liold the upper hand in interest.
Previous to the freshman game in
Los Angeles last Saturday between
the Cubs and Trojans in which the
latter lost, 7 to 0, betting on the "Lit
ile Big Game" was even. With the van
quishers of Stanford themselves de
feated by the Cubs, Cardinal fans are
asking odds on the basis of dope but
iepending on "Husky" Hunt to upset
t as he did last year.
Powerful Backs
Comparing the 1927 and 1928
ilevens, one finds little difference ex
cept, perhaps, in the backfield and on
ilie ends. In the former department,
his year's babes must be conceded
lie edge. There is no doubt that the
potential strength of such men as
Nichols, Patchett, Clark. Hill, Pabst,
\lillage, Altaffer. Murphy, and Dorcy
ooks more favorable than the back
field combinations of last year.
Whether or not these potentialities
will blossom out into ground-gaining
backs depends on practice this week,
jut Hunt believes tliey will. For one
hing, a more serious attitude is being
diown by the formerly listless back
field. The return of Altaffer and Mil
lage has probably helped the situation.
Clark Going Good
The so-called "possibilities" are the
ones who got the attention in the San
Mateo game and are being tested these
days. Clark, at quarter, is one of
them. He is a made-over linesman but
the way he handled the team for part
of the Friday game was quite favor
able to his chances as a regular at that
position.
Nichols is another man with a
chance of filling a regular's shoes at
either right or left half. With the ex
ception of Dorcy, the Huntington
Beach hurdler has shown as much, if
not more, development the past three
weeks than any other freshman grid
der.
Altaffer, to tlie bleachers, is a "dark
horse," but to , "Husky" he is a valu
able cog in the backfield machine. A
long-distance, left-footed kicker, dan
gerous on offense and accurate on de
fense, his absence with an injured
foot has been a disappointment to all
concerned and with his return this
week Hunt should have to do little
worrying over either regulars or re
serves back of the line.
