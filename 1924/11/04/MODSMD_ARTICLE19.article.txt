Undoubtedly it is for the best interests of Pacific Coast football ftnd
football in general that the Stanford-U. S. C. game next Saturday be
called off. Southern California has been stricken off the athletic lists of
Stanford and California for the best reasons in the world, and the only
unfortunate part of it is that the new situation cannot be made retroactive
for the past few years.
Football is constantly withstanding attacks from people who claim that
the sport is submerged in the finance. It is true that football supports the
other sports in the average university, but so long as that fact does not
interfere with the quality or ethics of football, that fact has no bearing on
the situation. When, however, the football is questionable, it is better for
the university to drop it entirely, and it is unquestionably proper for self
respecting institutions to hold off and keep their own hands clean.
1 he trouble with Southern California is by no means of recent origin.
1 his action taken bv Stanford and the University of California is only
the logical and desirable culmination of a long series of incidents. It has
been no secret anywhere that the unofficial stand taken on athletics by the
Trjoans is unique in Coast football circles. There have been similar cases
in the East, and as a rule they have been similarly dealt with. An ex
tremely holy attitude, taken after all is lost, may be convincing and it may
not. It is certain, however, that it will not convince those who have good
reason to know that a grandstand play is a matter of individual benefit only.
