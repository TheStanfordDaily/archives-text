The announcement that Stanford will play the University of Utah next
Saturday comes as good news. The "Little Big Game" would have pro
vided the campus with its regular week-end ration of football, but it
would ha\ e provided Coach Warner s varsity with very little nutriment in
the way of acid tests toward the California game.
Ckegon and Idaho were hard games, but not so hard as California will
be. And they were too early in the season to function properly in "point
ing at the Golden Bear. Montana seems to have slumped from last year,
and the Grizzly game does not promise the gruelling struggle needed alone
about this time.
Utah seems to have a fairly strong team. Stanford is fortunate in be
ing able to arrange the game with them on such short notice, and a con
tinuance of the relation would l>e desirable. The Pacific Coast is more or
less a closed corporation, on account of geographical limitations, and
the more teams that cross the Sierras the better.
California has offered her stadium, since the Stanford horseshoe will
l>e tilled with freshmen on that afternoon. That means another trip for
denizens of the Farm who prefer varsity to babe football, but judging
from the number who saw California win Saturday the Bay will not be
much of an obstacle. Every Stanford and California student will have an
opportunity to watch the game of his choice, and despite the fact that the
Bruins will be in Seattle it will be a pigskin week-end around San Fran
cisco.
