The Editor —Sir:
Stanford's rooting scction is going the
way that an army without organization
and without a leader goes. General Mc-
Allister is dead and his loyal army is
lost and alone. We have only to look
hack one year to rccall what Stanford
rooters will do if they have a leader Who
is willing to do as much, there to lead
them. There was 110 letting a player like
Hay go off the field after three quarters
o fgreat football without a yell, then.
There was 110 taking cheers from an op
posing rooting section without returning
them, then. Bert Lapp was willing to
give his last breath for Stanford as dem
onstrated by his condition after the Big
Game last year. McAllister is all too
unwilling to get out of a comfortable
seat at all, and when he docs a little list
less arm waving with a listless response
is the only result. Perhaps if he saw
the capable leadership, hearty response,
and well-practiced "stunts" of the Uni
versity of California section last Satur
day, he would help us get together to
show the world that our spirit isn't quite
dead yet either.
