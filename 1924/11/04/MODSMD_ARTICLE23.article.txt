i "Let criticp chew my work and find
Fit matter for their trade of whack
ing;
Let pundits analyze my mind,
And say that this and that is lack
ing.
"For critics' talk —alack —alas —
I do not care a week-old cruller:
I only know that when they pass
This wold will be a damsite duller!"
There has been some discussion in
certain quarters as to just what con
stitutes a "highbrow;" we are falter
ing over the following:
"a person who knows what he ought
to like, but hasn't yet succeeded in
liking it."
"a vegetable—all gone to top."
"often he thinks he knows; always
he knows he thinks."
"a lowbrow's way of designating a
taste for higher things."
But we rather incline toward the
inspired individual who has decided
that the term under discussion refers
to a person with a bald head.
Robert L. Stevenson said, "It is bet
ter to be a fool than to be dead. . . .
Some people swallow the universe like
a pill . . . they travel on through the
world like images pushed from behind.
For God's sake give me a man with
brains enough to make a fool of him
self!"
Warren B. Blake said, "A corpse is
the only absolutely blameless thing in
the world . . . and the least effective.
Dante dedicated a special circle of his
Inferno to such as these. The one un
forgivable sin is—not to sin—but to
lead a posthumous life." (Heads of
student activities please take note.)
Margie says, "It's a great life, if you
don't weaken; but it's a lot more fun
if you do!"
One of the greatest modern writers
unearthed an interesting bit of psy
chology in the following: "Why do we
write for the world what we would not
say to the individual? Why do we
send on every wandering wind secrets
we would not whisper to our chosen
friend?"
Therefore take not these writings
too seriously; and apply them not to
any one person . . . for Heaven knows
to whom they really are addressed.
Ah, that bitter face! Perhaps she
has been watching Spark Plugs with
astigmatism trying to find lost note
books in Abilene, Kan.; and then dis
covered that she was only one of the
four out of five. Now if she had the
aid of a butler . . .
Another viewpoint: Perhaps those
seniors who walked off with the purple
linings of freshmen's dinks are saving
them to make garments for the suffer
ing Russians. "Forgive them, for they
know not what they do."
