# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT
## 
### 
The Editor —Sir:
It has been called to ray attention by
the Lafayette Studio, now taking pho
tographs for the Quad in the pavilion,
that sample photographs of consider
able value have at several times been
taken from the display desk during
the attendant's absence.
Evidently some members of the
Stanford student body cannot be
trusted to respect the property of
others when such property is decou»-
tive to their rooms. Usually material
appropriated for such purposes is of
very little value, and these same stu
dents would regard taking anything
valuable as stealing—dishonorable.
Perhaps the reason this was not
classed as stealing was that the stu
dents who helped themselves to the
photographs did not realize that this
cheap method of decorating their
rooms was costing the Lafayette
Studio a great deal of money and caus
ing their student publication much in
convenience.
It is hoped that the guilty parties
will be honorable enough to return the
photographs and to lind other ways of |
decorating their rooms in the futlre.
L. B. BROWN.
