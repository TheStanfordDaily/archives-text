# BOOKS RECEIVED BY LIBRARY TELL WAR STORY OFFICIALLY

### 
The Hoover War Library has recent
ly placed on exhibition in the main
library a number of works dealing with
the question of war responsibility.
These books are arranged in the ex
hibition according to the order of their
appearance; first in line are the Col
ored books, extracts from the official
correspondence of each government,
published soon after the war broke out.
They are known as the "French Yel
low Book," the "Austrian Red Book,"
and the "Russian Orange Book."
According to Miss Nina Almond, the
librarian of the Hoover War Library,
"for four years all the vast literature
in regard to the outbreak of the war
was based on these books."
"Then, the revolutionary govern
ments came into power in Germany
and Austria in 1918, and wishing to
discredit their predecessors, they
'opened the archives' and published
their documents without reserve." Of
these documents, the Kautusky and
Goos Documents are contained in the
exhibition.
Next is a personal account of what
had happened, "Memorie della Mia
Vita," by Giolitti. "This is tyut one of;
a flood of such works that poured
from the press at the close of the war.
Statesmen in all countries placed be
fore the public their personal accounts 1
of what had happened."
The Soviet revelations follow. "The J
book on exhibition is one of a number
of secret documents published by the
Soviet Government of Russia from its j
archives. They have helped to throw 1
light on pre-war and wartime diplo- j
macy, though they tend to inculpate
the Entente allies."
The "Peace Conference Committee j
Report on the Responsibility for the
War" is also included in the exhibit. It!
places the blame on Germany, and Ger
many was forced to admit her respon- j
sibility when she signed the treaty of
Versailles.
Miss Almond concluded: "The ques
tion of war responsibility is being re-1
opened by critics and scholars as well'
as by politicians, and the last article!
in the exhibit is a recent Serbian book
written to prove that the assassination
of Archduke Ferdinand was planned in j
Vienna. This and the other revelations !
make it necessary to rewrite the his- i
tory of the outbreak of the war."
