# EXTRA STAGE HANDS WILL SHORTEN WAITS IN R.U.R. PRODUCTION
## 
### 
A new system of scene shifting, and >
an extra crew of stage hands will help 1
to speed up the production of "R.U.R.", !
which Sword and Sandals Society will \
present on November 14.
The only real criticism of Stanford |
theatrical productions in the past has |
been the long waits between acts. This !
new system will obviate this fault, and
from now on every show will be speed- !
Ed up about thirty minutes. Interest in
"R.U.R." will be so keen, and the dra- i
matic sequences will be so tense, that |
some means had to found to cut down
the waits between acts.
"Rehearsals have been more than sat- j
isfactory," said Gordon Davis, the direc- j
tor, "and I am looking forward to one
of the best plays I have ever been con- !
nected with here at Stanford."'
Careful preparation has been ncces- 1
sary for several of the stage effects, the
most important being the scene where I
the Robot ohrdc blows up the factory
where the Robots are made. It is this
scene which made such an impression on
blase New York audiences, and Davis
expects to make of it the biggest dra
matic moment in the play.
