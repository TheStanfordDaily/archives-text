# College Graduates Only 1 Per Cent of Population

Speakers to eollege audiences are
not always using a mere figure of
speech when they call them "Thej
chosen few of the youth today." Thirf i
is strikingly shown by statistics, re
cently given out by the U. S. Bureau
of Education, which graphically showi
the extremely small portion of the
population which receives college edu-j
cation.
A group of 100 boys and girls in the
fifth grade dwindles to sixty-three be
fore leaving grammar school. Only
thirty-four start high school, and of
these, thirteen graduate. Seven enter
college, but five stick through the
sophomore year, only three the juuior
year, and one graduates.
In other words, for every one college
graduate there are ninety-nine persons
who have not completed college.
