# Daily Palo Alto Will Carry Stories On Foreign Colleges
## 
### 
Beginning with an article on Oxford
to be published sometime this week,
The Daily Palo Alto will print a series
of stories on the various universities
of foreign countries, to be published
semi-weekly for the rest of the quarter.
These articles are being sponsored
by the Yale News, and have been writ
ten by men who know the country and
the university of which they write.
Oxford, since it is the most closely
allied to America, through the Rhodes
scholarship, will be considered both
from the American and English view
point. "It is believed that American
undergraduates know little of the life
and customs of their fellow students
in foreign countries," says the Yale
News, "and it is our hope that by pre
senting a true picture of existing con
ditions, interest may be stimulated and
a foundation laid for future under
standing."

President Emeritus Arthur Twininy
Hadley of Yale writes: "The getting
together of the learned world which
has been taking place during the last |
two hundred years has been on the
purely Intellectual side. But the purely
intellectual side is not the whole of j
life, nor does it represent the whole of j
university influence and character. To
get the intellectual forces of the world
together, and to get its thought really
internationalized we need mutual un- j
understanding between the students
of different parts of the world as well
as the teachers.
"This is not the kind of thing which
can be achieved in a day or through
any one agency. Rhodes scholarships,
international exchanges of students,
international participation in athletics
or in ceremoniesâ€”all these show a
recognition of the need of a student
contact as the means for getting the
world together."
