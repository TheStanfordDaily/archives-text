# FRESHMEN BATTLE UNDEFEATED JUNIOR ELEVEN TOMORROW
## First Year Eleven Doped to Fight Hard in Spite Of Recent Defeat 
### 
Freshman and junior grid teams will
| tangle' in the fourth game of the inter
-1 class series on the freshman field at
4 p.m. tomorrow. It was erroneously
reported in last night's Daily that the
contest would be played this after
noon.
On the face of comparative scores
the freshmen might be given the edge,;
but how valuable such an edge would
be in actual play is another question.;
The light, fast attack of the freshmen
could not be brought into effective use'
against the sophs because of the;
muddy playing field, but it should
work to good advantage tomorrow. !
The juniors did not show much of
anything against the mediocre fourth-:
year aggregation when they struggled j
to a scoreless tie. On the other hand,:
the frosh succeeded in holding the
relatively strong sophomore eleven to
one field goal in the first half, al- !
though they weakened in the second
period and allowed their opponents to
score four times.
Freshmen Know Football
A long practice period has enabled
j Captain Jenkins to instill into a large
; squad of first-year men considerable
knowledge of football. Earlier in the
year he was handicapped by .Husky
Hunt's shifting of men from first to
second string positions, and the re
verse* but now he has a smooth-work
ing machine.
Cass is the star of a light, fast back
field, often breaking away for runs
from his fullback position or gaining
through the line. Truman and Itiesner
have both shown well at quarter, while
Wolf and Miller are the likeliest pair
of halves. The latter is a cinch for big
yardage when he gets started, which
is only occasionally.
The line is just fair, being light
throughout. Guthrie at tackle is the
outstanding performer. He broke up
several sophomore plays behind the
line of scrimmage, and is a constant
threat on the defense. Fumbles and
erratic play in the pinches cost the
yearlings the victory in their first
| game, and these faults may result as
disastrously tomorrow if they are not
remedied.
Shifts in Junior Line-up
Although handicapped by lack of ma
terial, Dave Mannoccir has built up
it fairly strong eleven to represent the
juniors. He has plugged up the worst
holes which showed during the senior
contest. Randolph, a good punter, has
taken Stockbridge's place at fullback,
and Stockbridge lias been sent in at
guard to strengthen the line.
Morgan and Marsh will start at the
halves tomorrow. Pope at quarter
rounds out a light backfield. Cameron
is a 190-lb. tackle who should make
things interesting for the frosli. Brown
and Briggs are fast, experienced ends.
According to Mannoccir, the juniors
will open up and use everything they
have in an attempt to rush the year
lings off their feet and annex the vic
tory.
College students' souls are safe from
hell, says Dr. Samuel Joshi of the Uni
versity of Colorado. He argues that
the college stimulates liealthy-minded
ness, which leads to the attributes he
considers the mark of safety from the
lower world.

knowledge of football. Earlier in the
year he was handicapped by .Husky
Hunt's shifting of men from first to
second string positions, and the re
verse* but now he has a smooth-work
ing machine.
Cass is the star of a light, fast back
field, often breaking away for runs
from his fullback position or gaining
through the line. Truman and Itiesner
have both shown well at quarter, while
Wolf and Miller are the likeliest pair
of halves. The latter is a cinch for big
yardage when he gets started, which
is only occasionally.
The line is just fair, being light
throughout. Guthrie at tackle is the
outstanding performer. He broke up
several sophomore plays behind the
line of scrimmage, and is a constant
threat on the defense. Fumbles and
erratic play in the pinches cost the
yearlings the victory in their first
| game, and these faults may result as
disastrously tomorrow if they are not
remedied.
Shifts in Junior Line-up
Although handicapped by lack of ma
terial, Dave Mannoccir has built up
it fairly strong eleven to represent the
juniors. He has plugged up the worst
holes which showed during the senior
contest. Randolph, a good punter, has
taken Stockbridge's place at fullback,
and Stockbridge lias been sent in at
guard to strengthen the line.
Morgan and Marsh will start at the
halves tomorrow. Pope at quarter
rounds out a light backfield. Cameron
is a 190-lb. tackle who should make
things interesting for the frosli. Brown
and Briggs are fast, experienced ends.
According to Mannoccir, the juniors
will open up and use everything they
have in an attempt to rush the year
lings off their feet and annex the vic
tory.
College students' souls are safe from
hell, says Dr. Samuel Joshi of the Uni
versity of Colorado. He argues that
the college stimulates liealthy-minded
ness, which leads to the attributes he
considers the mark of safety from the
lower world.
Freshman and junior grid teams will
| tangle' in the fourth game of the inter
-1 class series on the freshman field at
4 p.m. tomorrow. It was erroneously
reported in last night's Daily that the
contest would be played this after
noon.
On the face of comparative scores
the freshmen might be given the edge,;
but how valuable such an edge would
be in actual play is another question.;
The light, fast attack of the freshmen
could not be brought into effective use'
against the sophs because of the;
muddy playing field, but it should
work to good advantage tomorrow. !
The juniors did not show much of
anything against the mediocre fourth-:
year aggregation when they struggled j
to a scoreless tie. On the other hand,:
the frosh succeeded in holding the
relatively strong sophomore eleven to
one field goal in the first half, al- !
though they weakened in the second
period and allowed their opponents to
score four times.
