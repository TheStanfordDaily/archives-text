# CARDINALS WILL PLAY UTAH AT BERKELEY SATURDAY
## UNIVERSITY OF UTAH SQUAD IS NEXT STANFORD OPPONENT Utes Rated As One Of Strongest Machines In Rockies; Backs Depend On Speed 
### 
UNIVERSITY OF UTAH football team will clash with the Stanford
varsity at 2:30 Saturday in the California Memorial Stadium, according
to an announcement from the graduate manager's office at 1 o'clock
this afternoon. Coach Tommy Fitzpatrick will leave Salt Lake with a squad
of seasoned players tomorrow and will arrive in San Francisco in time to put
his players through a light workout before the game.
Utah is rated as one of the most powerful outfits in the Rocky Mountain
conference. Two years ago the Crimson won the conference title, and its
team this year has better material than that which won out in 1922, although

bit has not been as fortunate in piling
|up scores. Fitzpatrick bears a close
analogy to "Gloomy Gus" Henderson.
He has remarkable material, but fails
to work it into the powerful machine
that it should be.
Fitzpatrick has been assisted this
year by "Fighting Bob" Reagon, a for
mer Notre Dame star, and the Utah
eleven uses very similar tactics to
Knut Rockne, the Notre Dame mentor.
Utah has not invaded the Pacific
Coast since it tangled with Andy
Smith's first wonder team, was
trounced, and sent home with a 69 to 0
defeat. Idaho usually has a game with
Utah, the last one being last year. In
this game the Utahns met defeat at
the hands of the Vandals, although
the game was by no means one-sided.
Lose to Drake
The Mormons took on Drake univer
sity in an intersectional game October
4. Drake did not have much trouble in
walloping the Westerners by a 33 to 7
count. The University of Colorado,
probably the best team in the Rockies,
had a hard time beating Utah 3 to 0.
Colorado rates among the better teams
of the country.
The only victories the Utes have
I chalked up were against Brigham
Young University and Arizona, both
weak teams. The scores were impres
sive, being 35 to 6 against B. Y. U.
and 32 to 7 against Arizona.
However, Utah is great on long end
runs, and against a weak team it is
easy for an eleven with a few flashy
backs to run up a big score, when
those same backs would be helpless
against a team with strong enough
linesmen to break up the end runs
before they get started. This probably
explains the one-sided scores in Utah's
two victories.
Jewkes Is Star
Captain Reid Jewkes is the most out
standing player on the Crimson eleven.
| He is one of the hardest hitting backs
in the Rocky Mountain conference, and
| won honorable mention by Walter
Camp last season. Jewkes plays full
j back, although he is a comparatively
! light man. The Utah captain consist
j ently runs the 100-yard dash in :10
| flat with a football suit on. When he
I gets through the secondary defense
there is no stopping him.
The rest of the Utah backfield is
j even lighter than Jewkes, but weight
doesn't mean much with them, each
back being a good double for "Tut"
Inilay. The Crimson line is also light,
averaging about 185.
A telegram received last night by
Graduate Manager Paul Davis from j
Ned Lewis, president of the Associ-'
ated Students of U. S. C., capped the
climax of the Stanford-U. S. C. contro
versy and definitely cancelled the foot
ball game between the two institu
tions.
The action was taken by the U. S. C.
student body after the faculty had
passed the question of cancellation to
that organization for decision. Pro
tests from alumni in all sections of the
country were thought to be the main
influence in the final step.
Dr. Barrow, director of athletics, is
sued a final statement today which is!
as follows:
"Confirming the press reports of
yesterday, we have received a tele-!
gram from the President of the Asso
ciated Students of the University of
Southern California stating that that
body had decided to cancel the sche
duled game between the University of
Southern California and Stanford.

"As is customary in Intercollegiate
contests the University of Southern

fill the obligation of the contract. How
ever, in view of the feeling or resent
ment that has arisen over the whole
affair it is probably best that the game
has been cancelled.

"As is customary in Intercollegiate
contests the University of Southern
California and Stanford had entered
into a contract to play this game. It
was Stanford's intention, in spite of
the situation that had arisen, to ful
fill the obligation of the contract. How
ever, in view of the feeling or resent
ment that has arisen over the whole
affair it is probably best that the game
has been cancelled.
"One of the most regrettable phases i
of the whole situation is that the pur !
chasers of tickets for the game Satur-|
day will be greatly inconvenienced by
this last minute cancellation."
UNIVERSITY OF UTAH football team will clash with the Stanford
varsity at 2:30 Saturday in the California Memorial Stadium, according
to an announcement from the graduate manager's office at 1 o'clock
this afternoon. Coach Tommy Fitzpatrick will leave Salt Lake with a squad
of seasoned players tomorrow and will arrive in San Francisco in time to put
his players through a light workout before the game.
Utah is rated as one of the most powerful outfits in the Rocky Mountain
conference. Two years ago the Crimson won the conference title, and its
team this year has better material than that which won out in 1922, although

bit has not been as fortunate in piling
|up scores. Fitzpatrick bears a close
analogy to "Gloomy Gus" Henderson.
He has remarkable material, but fails
to work it into the powerful machine
that it should be.
Fitzpatrick has been assisted this
year by "Fighting Bob" Reagon, a for
mer Notre Dame star, and the Utah
eleven uses very similar tactics to
Knut Rockne, the Notre Dame mentor.
Utah has not invaded the Pacific
Coast since it tangled with Andy
Smith's first wonder team, was
trounced, and sent home with a 69 to 0
defeat. Idaho usually has a game with
Utah, the last one being last year. In
this game the Utahns met defeat at
the hands of the Vandals, although
the game was by no means one-sided.
Lose to Drake
The Mormons took on Drake univer
sity in an intersectional game October
4. Drake did not have much trouble in
walloping the Westerners by a 33 to 7
count. The University of Colorado,
probably the best team in the Rockies,
had a hard time beating Utah 3 to 0.
Colorado rates among the better teams
of the country.
The only victories the Utes have
I chalked up were against Brigham
Young University and Arizona, both
weak teams. The scores were impres
sive, being 35 to 6 against B. Y. U.
and 32 to 7 against Arizona.
However, Utah is great on long end
runs, and against a weak team it is
easy for an eleven with a few flashy
backs to run up a big score, when
those same backs would be helpless
against a team with strong enough
linesmen to break up the end runs
before they get started. This probably
explains the one-sided scores in Utah's
two victories.
Jewkes Is Star
Captain Reid Jewkes is the most out
standing player on the Crimson eleven.
| He is one of the hardest hitting backs
in the Rocky Mountain conference, and
| won honorable mention by Walter
Camp last season. Jewkes plays full
j back, although he is a comparatively
! light man. The Utah captain consist
j ently runs the 100-yard dash in :10
| flat with a football suit on. When he
I gets through the secondary defense
there is no stopping him.
The rest of the Utah backfield is
j even lighter than Jewkes, but weight
doesn't mean much with them, each
back being a good double for "Tut"
Inilay. The Crimson line is also light,
averaging about 185.
A telegram received last night by
Graduate Manager Paul Davis from j
Ned Lewis, president of the Associ-'
ated Students of U. S. C., capped the
climax of the Stanford-U. S. C. contro
versy and definitely cancelled the foot
ball game between the two institu
tions.
The action was taken by the U. S. C.
student body after the faculty had
passed the question of cancellation to
that organization for decision. Pro
tests from alumni in all sections of the
country were thought to be the main
influence in the final step.
Dr. Barrow, director of athletics, is
sued a final statement today which is!
as follows:
"Confirming the press reports of

country were thought to be the main
influence in the final step.
Dr. Barrow, director of athletics, is
sued a final statement today which is!
as follows:
"Confirming the press reports of
yesterday, we have received a tele-!
gram from the President of the Asso
ciated Students of the University of
Southern California stating that that
body had decided to cancel the sche
duled game between the University of
Southern California and Stanford.
Contract Cancelled
"As is customary in Intercollegiate
contests the University of Southern
California and Stanford had entered
into a contract to play this game. It
was Stanford's intention, in spite of
the situation that had arisen, to ful
fill the obligation of the contract. How
ever, in view of the feeling or resent
ment that has arisen over the whole
affair it is probably best that the game
has been cancelled.
"One of the most regrettable phases i
of the whole situation is that the pur !
chasers of tickets for the game Satur-|
day will be greatly inconvenienced by
this last minute cancellation."
UNIVERSITY OF UTAH football team will clash with the Stanford
varsity at 2:30 Saturday in the California Memorial Stadium, according
to an announcement from the graduate manager's office at 1 o'clock
this afternoon. Coach Tommy Fitzpatrick will leave Salt Lake with a squad
of seasoned players tomorrow and will arrive in San Francisco in time to put
his players through a light workout before the game.
Utah is rated as one of the most powerful outfits in the Rocky Mountain
conference. Two years ago the Crimson won the conference title, and its
team this year has better material than that which won out in 1922, although

bit has not been as fortunate in piling
|up scores. Fitzpatrick bears a close
analogy to "Gloomy Gus" Henderson.
He has remarkable material, but fails
to work it into the powerful machine
that it should be.
Fitzpatrick has been assisted this
year by "Fighting Bob" Reagon, a for
mer Notre Dame star, and the Utah
eleven uses very similar tactics to
Knut Rockne, the Notre Dame mentor.
Utah has not invaded the Pacific
Coast since it tangled with Andy
Smith's first wonder team, was
trounced, and sent home with a 69 to 0
defeat. Idaho usually has a game with
Utah, the last one being last year. In
this game the Utahns met defeat at
the hands of the Vandals, although
the game was by no means one-sided.
Lose to Drake
The Mormons took on Drake univer
sity in an intersectional game October
4. Drake did not have much trouble in
walloping the Westerners by a 33 to 7
count. The University of Colorado,
probably the best team in the Rockies,
had a hard time beating Utah 3 to 0.
Colorado rates among the better teams
of the country.
The only victories the Utes have
I chalked up were against Brigham
Young University and Arizona, both
weak teams. The scores were impres
sive, being 35 to 6 against B. Y. U.
and 32 to 7 against Arizona.
However, Utah is great on long end
runs, and against a weak team it is
easy for an eleven with a few flashy
backs to run up a big score, when
those same backs would be helpless
against a team with strong enough
linesmen to break up the end runs
before they get started. This probably
explains the one-sided scores in Utah's
two victories.
Jewkes Is Star
Captain Reid Jewkes is the most out
standing player on the Crimson eleven.
| He is one of the hardest hitting backs
in the Rocky Mountain conference, and
| won honorable mention by Walter
Camp last season. Jewkes plays full
j back, although he is a comparatively
! light man. The Utah captain consist
j ently runs the 100-yard dash in :10
| flat with a football suit on. When he
I gets through the secondary defense
there is no stopping him.
The rest of the Utah backfield is
j even lighter than Jewkes, but weight
doesn't mean much with them, each
back being a good double for "Tut"
Inilay. The Crimson line is also light,
averaging about 185.
A telegram received last night by
Graduate Manager Paul Davis from j
Ned Lewis, president of the Associ-'
ated Students of U. S. C., capped the
climax of the Stanford-U. S. C. contro
versy and definitely cancelled the foot
ball game between the two institu
tions.
The action was taken by the U. S. C.
student body after the faculty had
passed the question of cancellation to
that organization for decision. Pro
tests from alumni in all sections of the
country were thought to be the main
influence in the final step.
