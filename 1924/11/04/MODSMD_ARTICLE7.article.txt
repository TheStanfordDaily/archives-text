# CARDINALS WILL PLAY UTAH AT BERKELEY SATURDAY
## UNIVERSITY OF UTAH SQUAD IS NEXT STANFORD OPPONENT Utes Rated As One Of Strongest Machines In Rockies; Backs Depend On Speed 
### 
UNIVERSITY OF UTAH football team will clash with the Stanford
varsity at 2:30 Saturday in the California Memorial Stadium, according
to an announcement from the graduate manager's office at 1 o'clock
this afternoon. Coach Tommy Fitzpatrick will leave Salt Lake with a squad
of seasoned players tomorrow and will arrive in San Francisco in time to put
his players through a light workout before the game.
Utah is rated as one of the most powerful outfits in the Rocky Mountain
conference. Two years ago the Crimson won the conference title, and its
team this year has better material than that which won out in 1922, although

bit has not been as fortunate in piling
|up scores. Fitzpatrick bears a close
analogy to "Gloomy Gus" Henderson.
He has remarkable material, but fails
to work it into the powerful machine
that it should be.
Fitzpatrick has been assisted this
year by "Fighting Bob" Reagon, a for
mer Notre Dame star, and the Utah
eleven uses very similar tactics to
Knut Rockne, the Notre Dame mentor.
Utah has not invaded the Pacific
Coast since it tangled with Andy
Smith's first wonder team, was
trounced, and sent home with a 69 to 0
defeat. Idaho usually has a game with
Utah, the last one being last year. In
this game the Utahns met defeat at
the hands of the Vandals, although
the game was by no means one-sided.
