## 
### Allene Thorpe 
Posters and prints from Europe now
occupy the walls of the Stanford Art
Gallery. This exhibition is the first of
the present season. It will remain in
the gallery for a month.
The display from France includes a
series of color prints by the famous
French artist, Henry Riviere. One of
his most popular is "Beautiful Land of
Brittany."
Riviere, who is one of the greatest
of living illustrators, is well known for
his delicate, yet colorful, landscape ef
fects. This versatile artist has adapted
the medium known as chromo-xylo
graphy as a means of expressing him
self. This demands patient, delicate
work, usually characterizing only the
work of the professional print-maker.
Make Tracings
The work begins with a set of trac
ings taken from the original drawing,
one tracing to each block, and one for
each color employed. The chief diffi
culty lies in the joining of these blocks
whose colors must meet exactly with
out being divided by a line.
Each plate requires no less than
fifteen or twenty blocks. For the print
ing of the plates the artist prepares
and prints all of one color and then
all of the next color until every color
has been printed in the series.
Brittany is one of Riviere's favorite
places of work. Every year during fa
vorable weather, he lives in solitude,
out-of-doors, in this province. Among
the most notable in the exhibition are
two sea scenes, one a large print show
ing the beach on a clear spring day;
the other, a night scene, full of depth
and atmosphere.
Unusual Posters
The posters are from the state rail
ways of France and are examples of
poster work from some of the most
interesting painters in France.
The series is rich and at times dar
ing in color schemes. There is a charm
about the pictures, however, that
leaves a definite impression upon the
observer.
France was the first nation to use
the so-called poster type of oil work
for publicity purposes, and as a nation
has kept in the front of the field oi
poster work.
The French government has pur
posely given the art commissions foi
these posters to recognized art leaders
in order to obtain a high grade oi
advertising material.
The Stanford Art Gallery is open tc
i the public every day from 10 to E

ing in color schemes. There is a charm
about the pictures, however, that
leaves a definite impression upon the
observer.

i the public every day from 10 to E
j o'clock.
Posters and prints from Europe now
occupy the walls of the Stanford Art
Gallery. This exhibition is the first of
the present season. It will remain in
the gallery for a month.
The display from France includes a
series of color prints by the famous
French artist, Henry Riviere. One of
his most popular is "Beautiful Land of
Brittany."
Riviere, who is one of the greatest
of living illustrators, is well known for
his delicate, yet colorful, landscape ef
fects. This versatile artist has adapted
the medium known as chromo-xylo
graphy as a means of expressing him
self. This demands patient, delicate
work, usually characterizing only the
work of the professional print-maker.
Make Tracings
The work begins with a set of trac
ings taken from the original drawing,
one tracing to each block, and one for
each color employed. The chief diffi
culty lies in the joining of these blocks
whose colors must meet exactly with
out being divided by a line.
Each plate requires no less than
fifteen or twenty blocks. For the print
ing of the plates the artist prepares
and prints all of one color and then
all of the next color until every color
has been printed in the series.
Brittany is one of Riviere's favorite
places of work. Every year during fa
vorable weather, he lives in solitude,
out-of-doors, in this province. Among
the most notable in the exhibition are
two sea scenes, one a large print show
ing the beach on a clear spring day;
the other, a night scene, full of depth
and atmosphere.
Unusual Posters
The posters are from the state rail
ways of France and are examples of
poster work from some of the most
interesting painters in France.
