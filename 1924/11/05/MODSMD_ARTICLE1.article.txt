# STANFORD VOTERS GIVE COOLIDGE BIG LEAD OVER RIVALS
## President Heavy Favorite in Santa Clara County, Palo Alto 
### 
Stanford more than kept pace with:
the country as a whole in returning'
Calvin Coolidge to the presidency T>y
a landslide, giving him and his running j
mate, Charles G. Dawes, a two to one,
majority over LaFollette and a five to
one lead over Davis.
Complete returns for the four elec
toral delegations in Stanford Precinct
No. 2 are as follows:
Republicans 256
Democrats 50
Socialists 114
Prohibitionists 5... 2
LaFollette electors were placed on
the ballot under the name of the So-;
cialist party, due to the failure of the
so-called "third party" to organize un
der the California laws.
Thirteen of fifteen gave Coolidge a i
total vote of almost three to one. He
carried every precinct.

With forty-six of eighty-six pre
cincts still to be heard from, LaFol
lette and Coolidge were running neck
and neck in the city of San Jose, the
president having a bare lead of thirty
| two votes over his rival.
California gave its thirteen electoral
votes to Coolidge by an overwhelm
! ing majority. According to Associated
I Press reports issued at 1:30 a.m. on
j returns from 51 of the 58 counties and
j 3173 precincts out of 7465 Coolidge
[ had 332,036 votes, LaFollette 159,218,
, Davis 44,167, and Faris 5390.
Partial returns from Los Angeles in
dicated that the G. O. P. nominees
would carry that city by nearly 200,000
votes. San Francisco was regarded as
doubtful, early reports gi\4ng LaFol
lette a plurality of more than 7000.
In the nation as a whole Coolidge
had established a lead which, if yiain
tained, would give him 300 votes in
the electoral college, a figure only
slightly under that registered by Hard
ing in 1920. Davis' manager was still
confident that returns from the far
western states would throw the elec
tion into the House of Representatives,
although the Democratic nominee, on
the face of incomplete returns, lead in
only three states not carried by Cox —
Oklahoma, Missouri, and Tennessee.
He was running a nip-and-tuck race
with the president for New Mexico's
three electoral tallies. LaFollette was
assured of success only in his home
state, Wisconsin, and had given up all
hope of election. He stated, however,
that he would begin immediately to
work for cause of the third party in
1928.
The fate of most of the nineteen
state amendments still hung in the
balance at noon today, owing to the
difficulty in tabulating the votes on
such a large number of propositions.

No. 7, legalizing ten-round boxing con-1
tests, seemed likely to carry, and No.
19, the water and power act, appeared
doomed to a second overwhelming de
feat.

Stanford more than kept pace with:
the country as a whole in returning'
Calvin Coolidge to the presidency T>y
a landslide, giving him and his running j
mate, Charles G. Dawes, a two to one,
majority over LaFollette and a five to
one lead over Davis.

No. 2 are as follows:

LaFollette electors were placed on
the ballot under the name of the So-;

With forty-six of eighty-six pre
cincts still to be heard from, LaFol
lette and Coolidge were running neck
and neck in the city of San Jose, the
president having a bare lead of thirty
| two votes over his rival.
California gave its thirteen electoral
votes to Coolidge by an overwhelm
! ing majority. According to Associated
I Press reports issued at 1:30 a.m. on
j returns from 51 of the 58 counties and
j 3173 precincts out of 7465 Coolidge
[ had 332,036 votes, LaFollette 159,218,
, Davis 44,167, and Faris 5390.
Partial returns from Los Angeles in
dicated that the G. O. P. nominees
would carry that city by nearly 200,000
votes. San Francisco was regarded as
doubtful, early reports gi\4ng LaFol
lette a plurality of more than 7000.
In the nation as a whole Coolidge
had established a lead which, if yiain
tained, would give him 300 votes in
the electoral college, a figure only
slightly under that registered by Hard
ing in 1920. Davis' manager was still
confident that returns from the far
western states would throw the elec
tion into the House of Representatives,
although the Democratic nominee, on
the face of incomplete returns, lead in
only three states not carried by Cox —
Oklahoma, Missouri, and Tennessee.
He was running a nip-and-tuck race
with the president for New Mexico's
three electoral tallies. LaFollette was
assured of success only in his home
state, Wisconsin, and had given up all
hope of election. He stated, however,
that he would begin immediately to
work for cause of the third party in
1928.
The fate of most of the nineteen
state amendments still hung in the
balance at noon today, owing to the
difficulty in tabulating the votes on
such a large number of propositions.

No. 7, legalizing ten-round boxing con-1
tests, seemed likely to carry, and No.

Stanford more than kept pace with:
the country as a whole in returning'
Calvin Coolidge to the presidency T>y
a landslide, giving him and his running j
mate, Charles G. Dawes, a two to one,
majority over LaFollette and a five to
one lead over Davis.
Complete returns for the four elec
toral delegations in Stanford Precinct
No. 2 are as follows:
Republicans 256
Democrats 50
Socialists 114
Prohibitionists 5... 2
LaFollette electors were placed on
the ballot under the name of the So-;
cialist party, due to the failure of the
so-called "third party" to organize un
der the California laws.
Thirteen of fifteen gave Coolidge a i
total vote of almost three to one. He
carried every precinct.
The totals: J

With forty-six of eighty-six pre
cincts still to be heard from, LaFol
lette and Coolidge were running neck
and neck in the city of San Jose, the
president having a bare lead of thirty
| two votes over his rival.
California gave its thirteen electoral
votes to Coolidge by an overwhelm
! ing majority. According to Associated
I Press reports issued at 1:30 a.m. on
j returns from 51 of the 58 counties and
j 3173 precincts out of 7465 Coolidge
[ had 332,036 votes, LaFollette 159,218,
, Davis 44,167, and Faris 5390.
Partial returns from Los Angeles in
dicated that the G. O. P. nominees
would carry that city by nearly 200,000
votes. San Francisco was regarded as
doubtful, early reports gi\4ng LaFol
lette a plurality of more than 7000.
In the nation as a whole Coolidge
had established a lead which, if yiain
tained, would give him 300 votes in
the electoral college, a figure only
slightly under that registered by Hard
ing in 1920. Davis' manager was still
confident that returns from the far
western states would throw the elec
tion into the House of Representatives,
although the Democratic nominee, on
the face of incomplete returns, lead in
only three states not carried by Cox —
Oklahoma, Missouri, and Tennessee.
He was running a nip-and-tuck race
with the president for New Mexico's
three electoral tallies. LaFollette was
assured of success only in his home
state, Wisconsin, and had given up all
hope of election. He stated, however,
that he would begin immediately to
work for cause of the third party in
1928.
The fate of most of the nineteen
state amendments still hung in the
balance at noon today, owing to the
difficulty in tabulating the votes on
such a large number of propositions.
