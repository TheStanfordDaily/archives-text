# Students Banding Birds Throughout United States
## 
### 
Under the auspices of the U. S. De
partment of Agriculture, students of
zoology have established bird banding
stations in various parts of the coun
try, in order to study more effectually
the Hocking habits, ages, and charac
teristics of different birds. The central
organization for the western states is
located at Altadena, California, and
there is a branch at Stanford.
The work goes on throughout the
year except during the breeding sea
son. The birds are caught in wir? 1
screen traps and an aluminum band
bearing a number is fastened around
one leg. The number, place, and date
of banding are entered in a book so
that any bird that is found with a
band on it can be referred to tha files
and its history ascertained. Some
birds banded in Utah have been picked
up in the southern states. On the cam
pus a bird was banned and picked up
again a year later in the same place
where it was first banded.
