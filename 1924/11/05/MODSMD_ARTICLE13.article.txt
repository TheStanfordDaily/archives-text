# SENIORS HELD TO SCORELESS TIE BY 1927 CLASS TEAM
## Predictions for Sophomore Victory Upset in Hard-Fought Game 
### 
With, neither team able to score
when within striking distance of their
opponents' goal line, the strong sopho
more and senior interclass teams bat
tled to a scoreless tie yesterday after
noon on the frosh practice field in the
second round of tlie interclass football
championships. It was the second
straight 0 to 0 game played by "Oz"
Osborne's '25 team.
Doped to win-because of their im
pressive showing against the fresh
men the week before, the sophomores
ran up against a tartar in the upper
class eleven. Most of the game was
played in the second year men's terri
tory and only a lucky break saved
them from defeat in the last quarter.
At that time the seniors carried the
ball to the five-yard line and when
their rivals held for three downs
"Nip" McHose dropped back to at
tempt a goal from field. Rafetto broke
through and blocked the kick but the
ball bounded over the goal line where
it was recovered by a sophomore. A
pow-wow ensued, the seniors claiming
a safety while the underclass men in
sisted on a touchback but. the referee
finally decided for the sophs. The
game ended a moment later.
On two other occasions the seniors
marched down to the five-yard line
without being able to take it the rest
of the distance. After receiving the
opening kickoff they advanced on
stroight football until they reached
the shadow of the goal posts, to meet
the emergency Coach Post sPht An
derson and Price, both of whom won
their numerals on the '26 frosh team,
into his crumbling line and the added
strength enabled the sophomores a
moment later to kick out of danger.
The last year men threatened once
again in the third quarter when Ful
lerton's line-smashing and flashy work
by McHose took the ball down to the
five-yard marker again, but as before
tAe sophs held when backed up against
their own goal line.
The sophomores had their only real
chance to score in the second quarter
when a series of brilliant dashes by
Smythe took the ball deep into senior
territory. Here a passing game was at
tempted, and when one of the '26 ends
tried for a throw from Smythe with
a clear field ahead of him, it looked
like a touchdown. However, the re
ceiver fumbled the pass and the sen
iors took the ball.
Fullerton and McHose starred for
the upjerclassmen with their snappy
work at advancing the ball while
Blaine at center played his usual con
sistent game on the defense. Smythe
was the whole show for the second
year team. Time and again he got
away around the ends or passed to his
mates for long gains. In the line
Rafetto repeated his stellar work of
the previous week. The big two-hun
dred-pound tackle was in every play
and it was his effective work at smear
ing up the opposition's offense that
stalled the senior steam roller in scor
ing territory.
This afternoon freshmen meet jun
iors on the practice field opposite En
cina gym. Both teams are light and
fast and the game should develop a
lot of sensational open work. The
freshmen will be out to avenge the
28 to 0 beating they received ift their
first start against the sophs, but the
juniors, with, another week's practice,
should prove worthy rivals. Play will
start at 4 o'clock.

again in the third quarter when Ful
lerton's line-smashing and flashy work
by McHose took the ball down to the
five-yard marker again, but as before
tAe sophs held when backed up against
their own goal line.
The sophomores had their only real
chance to score in the second quarter
when a series of brilliant dashes by
Smythe took the ball deep into senior
territory. Here a passing game was at
tempted, and when one of the '26 ends
tried for a throw from Smythe with
a clear field ahead of him, it looked
like a touchdown. However, the re
ceiver fumbled the pass and the sen
iors took the ball.
Fullerton and McHose starred for
the upjerclassmen with their snappy
work at advancing the ball while
Blaine at center played his usual con
sistent game on the defense. Smythe
was the whole show for the second
year team. Time and again he got
away around the ends or passed to his
mates for long gains. In the line
Rafetto repeated his stellar work of
the previous week. The big two-hun
dred-pound tackle was in every play
and it was his effective work at smear
ing up the opposition's offense that
stalled the senior steam roller in scor
ing territory.
This afternoon freshmen meet jun
iors on the practice field opposite En
cina gym. Both teams are light and
fast and the game should develop a
lot of sensational open work. The
freshmen will be out to avenge the
28 to 0 beating they received ift their
first start against the sophs, but the
juniors, with, another week's practice,
should prove worthy rivals. Play will
start at 4 o'clock.

With, neither team able to score
when within striking distance of their
opponents' goal line, the strong sopho
more and senior interclass teams bat
tled to a scoreless tie yesterday after
noon on the frosh practice field in the
second round of tlie interclass football
championships. It was the second
straight 0 to 0 game played by "Oz"
Osborne's '25 team.
Doped to win-because of their im
pressive showing against the fresh
men the week before, the sophomores
ran up against a tartar in the upper
class eleven. Most of the game was
played in the second year men's terri
tory and only a lucky break saved
them from defeat in the last quarter.
At that time the seniors carried the
ball to the five-yard line and when
their rivals held for three downs
"Nip" McHose dropped back to at
tempt a goal from field. Rafetto broke
through and blocked the kick but the
ball bounded over the goal line where
it was recovered by a sophomore. A
pow-wow ensued, the seniors claiming
a safety while the underclass men in
sisted on a touchback but. the referee
finally decided for the sophs. The
game ended a moment later.
On two other occasions the seniors
marched down to the five-yard line
without being able to take it the rest
of the distance. After receiving the
opening kickoff they advanced on
stroight football until they reached
the shadow of the goal posts, to meet
the emergency Coach Post sPht An
derson and Price, both of whom won
their numerals on the '26 frosh team,
into his crumbling line and the added
strength enabled the sophomores a
moment later to kick out of danger.
The last year men threatened once
again in the third quarter when Ful
