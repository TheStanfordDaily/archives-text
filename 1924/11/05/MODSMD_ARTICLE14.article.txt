"Technical knowledge alone will
never bring success in the engineer
ing world," said Dr. Farley Osgood, in
his address at the Little Theatre yes
terday morning to the Stanford engi-;
neering students. I)r. Osgood is presi
dent of the American Institute of Elec
trical Engineers, and spoke on "What
the Young Engineer Goes Up Against,:
and How to Meet It."
"It is the human factor," he con-j
tinued, "the knowledge of how to he
have among men, together with know
ing how to find out what you do not
know, that will enable you to rise in
your profession."
A thorough understanding of the
English language and the ability to
use it intelligently Dr. Osgood de- ;
flared to be indispensable. He* also
expressed himself as heartily in favor
of athletics as a factor in mental train
ing, and in developing traits of obedi
ence and the will to co-operate. These
traits, he said, are all-important, if the
young engineer is to advance in any
industrial firm.
Dr. Osgood recommended the read
ing of carefully-selected books 011 a
wide range of subjects as an interest
ing and effective means of broadening
the intellect. In thus widening his
mental scope, he said, the engineer
ran enable himself to converse more
intelligently, and, in consequence, to
sell his ideas more easily.
