# "LITTLE BIG GAME" WILL HOLD LIMELIGHT SATURDAY; VARSITY FAVORITES TO BEAT MORMONS
## Babes' Lack of Confidence Chief Stumbling Block; Presence Of Millage Should Help 
### David Meiklejohn 
fTHE storm having broken and disappeared and the mud-throwing assuming
a more playful attitude, interest is being centered on the coming Stanford
freshman-California yearling "Little-Big Game" 011 the campus and 011 the
Cardinal varsity-Utah game in the California stadium.
For the first time in many years the freshman team has assumed the role
of the more important. Much as the varsity will be upheld in its game with a
new opponent, the yearling contest will naturally and befittingly be the
main event, while its more experienced brothers struggle through the curtain
raiser.
Much fias been said and too little determined on the attitude of the freshman
team. The general concensus of opinion seems to be that the yearlings are
suffering from a severe case of over-confidence. It might have been true

> before the contest with the U. S. C.
youngsters, but it certainly fails to
register at the present time.
The San Mateo game was undoubt
edly a hope-douser. There are always
such games in any schedule, and the
showing was only a natural reaction to
the beating of the week before.
What the freshmen need at present
is confidence and more confidence.
"Husky" Hunt realizes this and is
making every effort to instill some of
the magic dose.
What happened to the freshman
team that played at the beginning of
the season? There was some real toot
ball in that bunch and it could not
have been swallowed up all in one
defeat. The defeat was unfortunate
livest, and best in all the world. If you
don't believe it put in an appearance
at the pavilion with a box of Mr.
Smith and Bros, cough drops and hear
for yourself. In fact, the committee
has a squad of throat specialists on
hand to keep all of the soldiers in
shape. By so doing it is hoped the
roof of the pavilion will be lifted,
which will enable the University to en
large that edifice.
The rally is of an impromptu na
ture. When the U. S. C. rally was
called off the speakers who had been
engaged were notified there was to be
no rally. The joint demonstration for
the "Little Big Game" and varsity-
Utah game was planned instead, but
no new speakers have been secured
for it.
All of the Stanford songs and yells
will be practiced until the rooters can
really put them over as they should
be. This practice, it is hoped, will con
siderably improve the quality of the
yelling. The yell leaders can be de
pended upon in the future to invoke
sufficient quantity.
Songs are still being received in the
Big Game stunt contest. Cal Conron
reports that five have been sent in to
date. The committee will determine a
winner after November 10.

fTHE storm having broken and disappeared and the mud-throwing assuming
a more playful attitude, interest is being centered on the coming Stanford
freshman-California yearling "Little-Big Game" 011 the campus and 011 the
Cardinal varsity-Utah game in the California stadium.
For the first time in many years the freshman team has assumed the role
of the more important. Much as the varsity will be upheld in its game with a
new opponent, the yearling contest will naturally and befittingly be the
main event, while its more experienced brothers struggle through the curtain
raiser.
Much fias been said and too little determined on the attitude of the freshman
team. The general concensus of opinion seems to be that the yearlings are
suffering from a severe case of over-confidence. It might have been true

> before the contest with the U. S. C.
youngsters, but it certainly fails to
register at the present time.
The San Mateo game was undoubt
edly a hope-douser. There are always
such games in any schedule, and the
showing was only a natural reaction to
the beating of the week before.
What the freshmen need at present
is confidence and more confidence.
"Husky" Hunt realizes this and is
making every effort to instill some of
the magic dose.
What happened to the freshman
team that played at the beginning of
the season? There was some real toot
ball in that bunch and it could not
have been swallowed up all in one
defeat. The defeat was unfortunate
livest, and best in all the world. If you
don't believe it put in an appearance
at the pavilion with a box of Mr.
Smith and Bros, cough drops and hear
for yourself. In fact, the committee
has a squad of throat specialists on
hand to keep all of the soldiers in
shape. By so doing it is hoped the
roof of the pavilion will be lifted,
which will enable the University to en
large that edifice.
The rally is of an impromptu na
ture. When the U. S. C. rally was
called off the speakers who had been
engaged were notified there was to be
no rally. The joint demonstration for
the "Little Big Game" and varsity-
Utah game was planned instead, but
no new speakers have been secured
for it.
All of the Stanford songs and yells
will be practiced until the rooters can
really put them over as they should
be. This practice, it is hoped, will con
siderably improve the quality of the
yelling. The yell leaders can be de
pended upon in the future to invoke
sufficient quantity.
