fTHE storm having broken and disappeared and the mud-throwing assuming
a more playful attitude, interest is being centered on the coming Stanford
freshman-California yearling "Little-Big Game" 011 the campus and 011 the
Cardinal varsity-Utah game in the California stadium.
For the first time in many years the freshman team has assumed the role
of the more important. Much as the varsity will be upheld in its game with a
new opponent, the yearling contest will naturally and befittingly be the
main event, while its more experienced brothers struggle through the curtain
raiser.
Much fias been said and too little determined on the attitude of the freshman
team. The general concensus of opinion seems to be that the yearlings are
suffering from a severe case of over-confidence. It might have been true

> before the contest with the U. S. C.
youngsters, but it certainly fails to
register at the present time.
The San Mateo game was undoubt
edly a hope-douser. There are always
such games in any schedule, and the
showing was only a natural reaction to
the beating of the week before.
What the freshmen need at present
is confidence and more confidence.
"Husky" Hunt realizes this and is
making every effort to instill some of
the magic dose.
What happened to the freshman
team that played at the beginning of
the season? There was some real toot
ball in that bunch and it could not
have been swallowed up all in one
defeat. The defeat was unfortunate
