Every quarter, generally about a month after registration day, there
comes a general let-down in practically every department of University
life. Studies are well past the preliminary and indefinite stage, the first
examinations have come and gone with their usually unsatisfactory results,
the current sport has begun to shape up with a more or less rosy promise,
and the glamor of college life seems to have departed, for the time being
at least. It is the "dangerous age" of the scholastic term, and there is a
feeling generally floating about that things are not so worth-while as they
once seemed, and that life, liberty, and the pursuit of extremely problem
atical happiness are going to the fabled bow-wows.
The slump is upon us. Bickering and surface irritation are showing
up almost everywhere. Now, early in November, we have our founda
tions laid, individually and collectively, and it only remains to keep ham
mering away until whatever we aim for is accomplished. This is a crit
ical time, and actions within the next week or so will point out accurately
the net results of the quarter. Things may not be what they seem, and life
may be horribly cold and cruel—but it always seems so when the food be
gins to become too familiar. It's only a matter to be snapped out of.
