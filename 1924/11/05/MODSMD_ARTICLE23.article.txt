# Can You Imagine?

This world must be a funny place. That observation isn't original, but
it's sincere. It seems that a small college in Missouri observes the first
blush of Freshmanhood in a novel and most original manner. Here's how —
First-year women at this coeducational brain foundry wear green
"tams" with long green tassels about the campus. When an upp'erclass
man is met with, these young women give a tug at the tassel in the ap
proved sailor-man fashion and moreover they give voice to a prescribed
greeting "Toot, toot!" Which, according to our way of thinking, is most
uproariously to laugh. •
Try and imagine a Stanford freshman, feminine gender, saluting the
slick snake of last evening's date, or the old, beloved be-whiskered engi
neer with a dulcet "Toot, toot!" It just doesn't seem part of the picture.
Stanford has lost a good many of the dear old traditions of picturesque
value, but it has never had one like this to lose. Too bad it hasn't. It
would be such a splendid one to legislate against. Whatever may have
been the shaving, haircutting, and laundry deficiencies of the rough, he lias
always known most of the fundamentals of chivalry. He wouldn't stand
for it even if the women would. Just try and imagine it.

EDITORIAL STAFF of the Daily will meet tomorrow at the usual
time and place.
