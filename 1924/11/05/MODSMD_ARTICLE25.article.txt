# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT
## 
### 
The Editor —Sir:
With your permission I would like
to say a few words on the Stanford-
U. S. C. football scandal from the
viewpoint of a student. I wonder if
Stanford and the University of Cali
fornia breaking off relations with U. S.
C.is not a case of the "kettle calling
the pot black." From all the inferences
in the "Daily" and in the San Fran
cisco papers the relatfons were sev
ered because U. S. C. players had re
ceived money or were gotten in ways
which were not up to the standard
Stanford and the University of Cali
fornia hoped to maintain. Personally
I would hate to see a thorough exam
ination and publicity of the amount
of money and time spent by Stanford
alumni in getting athletes to come to
Stanford for the last three years. I
also would be disheartened to see the
number of varsity players in the last
three years who had taken money for
■" 4 ''"op iri one sport or another
during the summer vacation or while
l that this is anything
r,or t ' p jy, n W(J arQ yyoj.^.
•• r tten system in our inter
collcpi te athletic world.
"g in thinking this is the
r" • o n ir e with xj. S. C. then
why am I not corrected. Jf the true
reason was that there were several
men who entered U. S. C. and are now
o, n thoj,. freshman football
team who were formerly refused >n
'nTH' *"> Stanford and California why

do not the papers say so, instead of
leaving the impression that U. S. C.
hires their players while our hands
are perfectly clean. This is not one
opinion alone hut represents the sen
timent of several other men on The
campus, both graduates and under
graduates. Lets get at the bottom of
the affair. Yours for clean athletics,
