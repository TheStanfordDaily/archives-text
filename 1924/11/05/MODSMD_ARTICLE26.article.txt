# CABBAGES and THINGS

Extract from Editor'fal Columns
of SCRAPLIKEHELL, affectionately
known as "SCRAPPY."
NOW INASMUCH as this year has
commenced, as years have such a
foolish and ridiculous habit of doing,
it behooves the Jolly One to outline
for his readers the policy which will
be pursued by His Jestful Majesty.
Scrappy has always stood for ctean
humor; he still stands for it, and, just
to show you how tolerant he really can
be, he may even print some of it.
Smut, of course, is taboo —that Is!
No story must do more than suggest
naughtiness, and it is preferred that
no one story have more than three
such meanings.
And, as you all know by now, Scrap
py cherishes a deep and bitter hatred
for jokes about Co-eds. Most of our
Co-eds have three or four jokes about
them all the time anyway—and Scrap
py thinks that's enough. (That was a
weak one, but we writers must live
some of you may question that, but
we think it's the truth.)
In consequence, the Frivolous One
has decreed that no quips about the
Dear Young Things will be accepted,
unless they are neatly typewritten,
and told in English, or Puritan.
—LUNDY.

Although your contribution was up
roariously provoking, Lupez de Lupe,
it could not find a place in the poet's
corner today because after all we have
only a couple of quarters more before
we graduate and we can't afford to
take the chance. However, the usual
private showings are being held, if
your friends want to know.
