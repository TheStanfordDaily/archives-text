A wicked line
Has Adeline —
She throws it.
Her lovely face
Makes pulses race—
She shows it.
Her wish is done;
Pray, how could one
Oppose it?
On thin ice? No;
How far to go?
She goes it.
She is, in short,
A darn good sport—•
She knows it.
—PRISCILLA.
• * *
Forgive us, Priscilla, but if you'd
count the feet yourself, you know, it
would save our pencil.
