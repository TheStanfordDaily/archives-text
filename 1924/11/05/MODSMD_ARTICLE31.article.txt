## 
### 
Warren D. Allen will play the "Chor
ale from the Second Symphony" by
Louis Vierne, the blind organist of
Notre Dame Cathedral, at the recital
at 4:15 tomorrow afternoon. The same
program will be repeated at 4 o'clock
Sunday afternoon.
"Canzona" (from the "Seven Sketch
es") was written by Edward Shippen
Barnes, of New York. Barnes is in the
front rank of American composers,
and has written two "symphonies" and
many smaller works for the organ.
Bach's "Adorn Thyself,
Soul," and "In Thee Is Joy" will be'
included in the program. In these two
Choral-Preludes are found first an ex
ample of the mystic, spiritual beauty
of the music in which Bach expressed
his religious affections. In the second
a brilliant and happy expression of ra
ligious ecstasy.
The Symphonic Poem, "My Coun
try," by Smetana, has been called the
"noblest musical monument of the J
great Bohemian Reformation," by
Clarence Dickinson, in his Excursions
in Musical History. The principal
theme is that of the Hussite battle
hymn, "the flail song," warriors who
for God are fighting. The first move
ment is called "Tabor," after Ziska's
armed camp on the top of Mt. Tabor,
which gave its name to a whole sec
tion of Hussite believers, the Tabor
ites.
