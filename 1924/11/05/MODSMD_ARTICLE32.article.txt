A poster published in Germany as
war propaganda and questioning the
sincerity of the allies' protective pol
icy toward smaller countries, is one
of the war publications on exhibit in
the Hoover War Library. Among the
unwilling countries represented as
subjugated by the United States are
listed Texas and Florida.
Three water color posters done in
a crude but forceful manner by a Rus
sian artist show the suffering and con
ditions during the famine in the win
ter of 1921.
Examples of the censorship of
papers which was practiced in France
during the war are shown in another
case. Pamphlets published privately
by the editors of "Le Sonnet Rouge,"
a German publication which cam
paigned for peace without victory, con
taining the articles censored by the
state and a newspaper as it appeared
after it had been censored are on ex
hibit.
During and after the war the ques
tion of blame was much discussed and
there was a great deal of material
published pertaining to it. Foreign
officers of many countries published
correspondence proving other nations
guilty, parties tried to prove the op
posite parties guilty, and individual
statesmen published memoirs compro
mising other statesmen. Some of these
publications which are source material
for historians are now in the cases.
