# Professor A. G. Kennedy Nearing End of Work On Chaucer Concordat
## 
### 
Professor A. G. Kennedy of the Eng
lish department is now reading proof
for the Chaucer Concordance, a work
which, begun years ago, will be pub
lished within the next year.
The Concordance was started by the
Chaucer Society about 1872. Nothing
definite was done about it until 1892
when Professor Ewalt Fliigel came to
the University to be head of the De
partment of English Philology. He ac
cepted the general editorship of the
book and worked on it until the time
of his death in 1914. Since 1915 Pro
fessor Kennedy and Professor John
S. P. Tatlock have been engaged in
finishing the work.
The Concordance is being brought
out by the Carnegie Institution of
Washington, which has financed most
of the work. It will consist of one large
volume about the size of the Spenser
Concordance. "It is one of the most
important concordances to English
literature and possibly the most diffi
cult to compile because there are so
many differing forms of words in the
period represented," explained Profes
sor Kennedy. Because of the urgent
need for the Concordance, it will pre
cede the Chaucer Dictionary, which
may be published sometime in the near
future.
