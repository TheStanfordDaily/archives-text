# BRUIN FRESHMEN HAVE EDGE ON CARDINAL YEARLINGS, ACCORDING TO BEAR PREDICTER

UNIVERSITY OF CAILFORNIA,
Nov. s.—California's freshman eleven
will meet the Stanford freshman team
in the annual "Little liig Game" in the
Cardinal stadium at Palo Alto next Sat
urday at 3 o'clock.
By comparative scores the Bruins
should he classed as the favorites over
Coach Hunt's Cardinals, hut comparative
scores mean very little in a series of
this sort. The U. S. C. babes managed
to defeat the Stanford freshmen by the
score of 7 to 0 two weeks ago, and last
week the Hear yearlings gave the Trojan
eleven a 7 to 0 beating at Los Angeles.
Many Stars on Squad
Coach "Pesky" Sprott has developed a
good "freshman squad at California this
seascft and has brought forward many
stars. In the backfield Marcus, Perrin,
Evans are gridders of the highest caliber,
and tlicy should feature in the Cardinal
game with their strong offensive ability.
Marcus has had a bad leg up to date
which prevented him from playing
against the Trojans, but he should be in
condition to show his wonderful ability
against the Stanford team.
The line with stars such as Captain
Coltrin, Giddings, Williams, Bancroft,
Towne, and Stanley also combine in a
strong outfit. Fred Coltrin, left tackle,
who is a product of Austen High School,
Chicago, has just been elected captain i
by members of the team, and with his j
ability and guiding power should lead
his team to victory against the Cardinals. I
Last year for the first time in about \

I ten years a freshman football team of
■ the University of California was de
feated by a Stanford team. With this
thought in their minds the California
team of '28 will enter the fray to score
j
■ a decisive victory over the Cardinals.
California's varsity football team will
attempt to hurdle its third large obstacle
: in the race for the Pacific Coast Confer
ence title, when it meets the Washington
Huskies at Seattle Saturday.
Ready for Stiff Game
Washington suffered an unexpected de
feat at the hands of Oregon last Satur
day, but Andy Smith is inclined to think
| that it was due to overconlidence and not
\ their lack of potential ability. There
fore Apdy and his men have been pre
paring for a stiff game in Seattle.
In the way of preparation Andy has
ben increasing the defensive power of
his line and the offensive power of his
backfield by new plays that the Bears
may open up with against the Huskies,
but arc most likely to save for the Stan
ford contest, if possible. The line
smashing power of Earl Jabs, a sopho
more, in the U. S. C. game indicated
that Andy Smith has a very capable sub
stitute for Young in the fullback berth.
Jabs gained more yardage in the game
Saturday than any other man on the
field. He is a consistent player and a
demon for work. The playing of Huber,
another graduate from last year's fresh
man team, at end, and Cock, who played
tackle throughout the game, was a reve
lation to Smith. Cock, who was for
merly an end, was converted into a tackle
last week by the Bruin coach. He surely
proved his ability in that position Sat
urday. The work of these players and
others indicates that Andy is building
up a strong array of reserve material.
. The work o{ the other backfield men,
Diyon, Imlay, and Carlson, in the Trojan
game was beyond reproach also. The
only essential improvement necessary is
in Carlson's drop-kicking. He has been
working on this constantly and should
chalk up several points by the use of his
toe in the Husky game. Young, Cali
fornia's plunging fullback, should be
ready to start in the Washington game,
as he is rounding into good shape now.
Thatcher, also, is in much better con
dition than he was last Saturday.
