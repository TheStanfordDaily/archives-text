kick after the Grays failed to score a
touchdown from the three-yard line.
This put the Card Reserves in the lead
for the first time during the game.
Shortly afterwards Santa Clara scored,
and the game ended with the ball in
midfield.
The Grays' line did not show its ex
pected strength, and the Santa Clara
backfield was able to make large gains
both through the line and around the
ends. Baldwin, at quarter, and Rispin
starred for the Grays. Rispin made a
number of long gains when skirting
the ends, and showed lots of speed.
The line-up of the teams at the start
of the game follows:

Simmons LTR Sumner
