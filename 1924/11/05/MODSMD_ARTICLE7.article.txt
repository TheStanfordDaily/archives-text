Characterizing Coolidge as a typlca
Yankee of 100 years ago with some
modern ideas, H. C. Hoover, Secretarj
of Commerce, prophesied a placid bui
constructive administration during the
next four years. Having received the
election returns through the radio last
night Hoover gave an informal speech
at his home last night to a group of
Stanford and Palo Alto people upon
the political situation.
"The Republican party is now the
only consolidated faction in the coun
try and will have a good opportunity
to carry out its constructive platform,"
said Secretary Hoover, pointing out
that LaFollette's radical third party
almost entirely displaced the Demo
cratic party whose stronghold in the
west and north has almost entirely
displaced the Democratic party. Demo
cratic support is now entirely in the
south and in New York.
Although a conservative body as
compared to the radical element of
the country, Hoover said that the Re
publican party was in no wise anal
goÂ»s to the English Conservative party
and far morq S resembled the Liberal
party.
Hoover said that the division of the
country into the party which now has
LaFollette as a leader and the Repub
lican party was an unfortunate con
dition, as it makes politics a class war.
