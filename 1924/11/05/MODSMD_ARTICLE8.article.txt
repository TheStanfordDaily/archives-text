# CALIFORNIA ROOTERS GRAB TROJAN EMBLEMS
## 
### 
Unknown rooters, believed to be
students at the University of Cali
fornia, smuggled the Trojan helmet
and banner from the Trojan guardians,
and are now holding them as souvenirs
of Saturday's game. As the guardians
of the emblems left the rooting sec
tion, California men swarmed them,
and before the 10,000 southern rooters
knew what all the excitement was
about, had escaped through the cam
put. to safety.
The stealing of the trophies is an
other example of California's "brains
over brawn" theory, and was an added
injury to the Bear's 7-0 viotory over
the Trojans.
