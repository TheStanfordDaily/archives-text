# PAVILION TONIGHT TO BE SCENE OF FOOTBALL RALLY
## Lines Will Form at Encina, Toyon, Sequoia, and Phi Gamma Delta House 
### 
The rally committee will be hosts
at a massive "pep" demonstration in
the pavilion at 7:15 tonight. Everyone
on the campus is invited to attend;
not Inly is it a cordial invitation, but
the committee asks, urges, begs, and
entreats that 2200 men and 500 'women
put in an appearance. Should tTiis num
ber be present, refreshments consist
ing of a thirteen-course dinner will be
served to all guests upon consideration
of a pair of exhausted lungs and a
wrecked set of vocal organs.
Lines, pavilion bound, will begin
forming at the Phi Gamma Delta
house, at Sequoia, Toyon, and Encina
at 7:15 and as soon as possible after
ward will take possession of the pa
vilion.
General McCallister, his left and
right lieutenants, and his cohorts are
going to start a reform tonight. From
now on the Stanford rooting section
is going to be the biggest, noisiest,
and it might be that the Trojans ac
tually had the better team.
The writer has watched the fresh
man team scrimmage with the varsity
and there still remains that power so
evident in the first of the season.
Last season "Husky" Hunt was con
fronted with somewhat the same situ
ation. He had a team which had been
defeated by the Trojans and still had
enough fight left to outplay and de
feat the California yearlings 12 to 0.
The return of Millage, Altaffer, and
Davidson is going to make some dif
ference in the way the team performs
aganst California Saturday.
Hunt believes that the absence of
Millage from the line-up in the U. S. C.
game had something to do with the
defeat, and is depending, therefore, on
his bearing the brunt of the backfield
burden in the Bruin contest.
With Don Robesky and Bigelow on
the line, defense should not lack
strength. Robesky clearly shows the
makings of a real football player.
University of Utah's light eleven
has offered its services against the
Stanford varsity in order to keep the
Redshirts in trim before the California
Big Game.
Utah comes with a reputation of
being one of the strongest teams in
the Rock Mountain Conference. It is a
far cry from the Pacific and not a
great deal of data is available to check
up on the potential strength of the
Mormon eleven as compared with
Stanford.
While the Card varsity has not rated
a triumphal arch after each of its re
cent games, it can at least point with
some show of pride to the string of
victories and no defeats.
Ernie Nevers has been going
through some stiff scrimmage in prac
tice lately and it seems unlikely that
he will not be used Saturday. He
may not' start the game, but it is a
good opportunity for him to shape up
before the next conference contest.
Nevers has lost little of that drive and
speed characteristic of his playing last
year, and there is reason to believe
that he still has as much on the ball
as in other seasons.
The Santa Clara victory was im
pressive despite some rough spots in
the backfield. There were a few fum
bles, a few bobbles and a bit of list
less teamwork, but these are definite
ly offset by the fact that Stanford
had the power to convert yardage into
touchdowns.
It takes a good line to batter its way
down from one end of the field to the
other antk hold that strength to the
final quarter.
-.The Cards do not lack reserve
power. Gil Wheat is injured and some
body ably fills the hole; Art Thomas
is hurt and Middleton replaces; Jim
Lawson is rested and Ted Shipkey
fills the gap. Hardly any noticeable
change. This is encouraging consider
ing the kind of a game that Stanford
is playing. A driving offense must be
ready at any time to be replaced and
unless the material is on the same
level there is sure to be a hitch.

University of Utah's light eleven

Big Game.
Utah comes with a reputation of
being one of the strongest teams in

far cry from the Pacific and not a
great deal of data is available to check
up on the potential strength of the
Mormon eleven as compared with
Stanford.
While the Card varsity has not rated
a triumphal arch after each of its re

some show of pride to the string of
victories and no defeats.
Ernie Nevers has been going
through some stiff scrimmage in prac
tice lately and it seems unlikely that
he will not be used Saturday. He
may not' start the game, but it is a
good opportunity for him to shape up
before the next conference contest.
Nevers has lost little of that drive and
speed characteristic of his playing last
year, and there is reason to believe
that he still has as much on the ball
as in other seasons.
The Santa Clara victory was im
pressive despite some rough spots in
the backfield. There were a few fum

touchdowns.
It takes a good line to batter its way

-.The Cards do not lack reserve
power. Gil Wheat is injured and some

Lawson is rested and Ted Shipkey

is playing. A driving offense must be
