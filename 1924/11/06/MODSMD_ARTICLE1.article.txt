# ODDS CONTINUE TO FAVOR BRUIN CUBS OVER CARD BABES
## Recovery of Regulars Adds Needed Strength to Stanford Squad 
### Douglas Meservey 
By virtue of their 7-0 victory over
U. S. C. last week, the California
freshman eleven still has an edge over
its Card rivals in prospects for the
"'Little Big Game" Saturday.
At least the thirty-odd men on the
squad are looking toward the coming
battle with more hope, if not more
.confidence, than previously.
Squad Back in Force
One cause of the cheerful attitude!
might be attributed to the fact that |
''Husky" Hunt once more has a full, j
uninjured squad. He started the season
with one and hopes to end with one. j
But the clashes with prep and U. S. C. j
teams in between times left holes in j
the line-up that were hard to fill, and j
which even threatened to scuttle the j
ship.
It seems, however, that the god of j
football has been kind to "Husky" j
all at once and Monday saw Davidson, j
Millage, and Altaffer once more in!
uniforms. All three will undoubtedly |
enter the Cub battle.
Davidson Will Help
Davidson's presence will materially
strengthen the wing positions. Without
him, Hunt has had little reserve to
back up Dennis or Vincenti, but now
there are three to answer a possible
call —Issell, Montgomery, and David
son.
Speaking of the yearling line, in j
watching for possible eruptions in the ;
Cub game keep a weather eye open '
for results from that line. Good or bad
plays are often credited to the back-'
field while it has been the forward
wall that has done the work.
Line Strong
This year, because of a slump by
several backfield men, the entire fresh-
man eleven has been the subject of
criticism. Few have failed to notice,
however, that it has been the line
which has stopped by far the most
plays of opposing elevens and opened
holes for their own backs. And no
wonder. Better varsity material for
"Tiny" Thornhill to mould could not
be found anywhere.
Take Captain Don Robesky for ex-»
ample. A member of the 1923 Bakers
field eleven, state champions, his
weight and experience have kept him
a steady job at tackle. It was he who
spilled so many of the U. S. C. plays I
behind their own line of scrimmage,
and his ability of leadership has been
shown more than once.
Eli Post of Berkeley holds down the
other tackle position and takes care
of his side of the line as capably as
does Robesky. Betwen them are Eve
rett and Bigelow at guard and Mustain
or Haight at center. For weight, the
first two average more than 20 pounds
heavier than Swan and Neill. As to
ability in scrimmage with the varsity,
the two freshman guards have given
their opponents no end of trouble in,
holding them back.
The race for center is about even
between Haight and Mustain. Both are
good material but the former was held I
back previous to the San Mateo game
in which he proved to be good com
petition for Mustain.

"The Romantic Age" was presented
the night of November 3 by the stu
dents of the University of Kansas.
