# SYDNEY UNIVERSITY LACKS GOOD ATHLETIC FACILITIES
## Harry Moloney Compares Studies, Sports Of Australia To Those Of Stanford 
### Harry Bennett 
"Sydney University is something
akin to Oxford and Cambridge, both
from the standpoint of administration
and architecture," says Harry Ma
loney, who has recently returned from
a summer tour of Australia with the
tennis team.
"Sydney consists of four colleges
within the university proper. These
are St. Andrew's, St. Paul's, St. John's,
and Wesley college. Each is adminis
tered by its own set of officers and
lives within itself as far as studies
are concerned.
"The system of instruction differs
materially from that of Stanford, in
so far as examinations are concerned.
Finals are given but once a year and
these are at the end of the academic
year proper. In this way much is left
to the student himself and his disposi
tion toward studies.
"The average student at Sydney is
a few years older than the Stanford

| man." They study hard and seriously,
: but they play hard and not seriously. |
Sports Take Minor Place
"They seem to feel that sports are ,
a means to an end but not necessarily j
the end. They feel that it merelyj
rounds out. their college education
and forms a balance so that the men
tal and physical well-being of the stu
-1 dent will dovetail one to the other.
. j "There is a great lack of athletic
: facilites at the Australian institution.
The oval is comprised of a football
field with an improficient running
' track around it.
I
I "This one football field also serves j
i for cricket matches during that season.
and also hockey and soccer football.
I The ground-keeper is put to his wits'
' end to try to keep this one field prop
erly lined and in shape for each sea
- sonal sport."
The university is also handicapped
< financially, according to Maloney. "It j
| is supported in the main by the gov
ernment," he said, "and the officials
have been unable to convince certain
members of parliament just how valu
able the institution is to the youth of
! the Australian Commonwealth.
University Trains Leaders
"Statistics show that all the great
leaders of that country have come
through such educational channels as
1 the private preparatory schools, col
leges, and up through the universities.
! Still those responsible for the main
tenance of the universities seem to
lose sight of this fact when looking
! toward the leaders of the future.
"The enrollment totals about 3250.
i and only 250 of these are women. The
academic subject offered these stu
j dents cover a broad field. The Univer
, sity specializes in Law and Medicine.
! On the whole it is astonishing how
the administration manages to turn
out such well-balanced scholars when
working under such adverse condi
tions.
"Both the administration and the
students showed such keen interest
in the method of conducting athletics
at Stanford that I was asked to give a
[ talk to them on this subject," said
| Maloney. He continued, "There is a
1 movement on foot at the university
to have physical education compulsory
for lower division students.
"All persons taking it will be re
! quired to pay a $5 gymnasium fee for
the improvement of athletic facilities.
"The university officials feel that
this will get all lower division students
interested in some form of athletics,
such as rugby, soccer football, hockey,
| cricket, rowing, tennis, swimming,
boxing, wrestling, and fencing. This
i will leave little time for gymnastics
1 proper.
"This, of course, is a big undertak
j ing with the present playing facilities,
but it is hoped that with the money
derived from the gym fees it will be
! possible to make enlargements.
Want Board of Control
"There is also a movement to in
augurate a Board of Athletic Control
I similar to the one at Stanford. This
: will be composed of three alumni
members, and three students, and will
| supplement the present Sport Asso
; ciation.
"There is much athletic material of
i all kins at Sydney University, but
| they have not money enough to hire "a
coaching staff for the different
branches of sports. As it is now, the
captain of each team renders what aid
he can in instructing the members of
his team.
"It seemed unusual," continued Ma
loney, "that there was a large num
ber of athletes who had made their
'full blue,' which corresponds to the
Stanford block S, in four branches of
sports. This tends to show that there
is material for developing all-round
athletes if some system of instruction
can be inaugurated.
"I purposely say instruction and not
coaching," insisted Maloney, "because
the athletic authorities at Sydney and
the students are very much opposed
to specialized coaching in university
athletics.
"They want someone who can teach

the ground-work in each sport and
leave the athlete sufficient leeway to
work out his own salvation. The ama
teur Australian sportsman sees a vast
difference between the coach and di
rector of athletics.
"One is looked on as a specialist
and a professional while the other is
considered merely a supervisor. For,
as one man so aptly said, 'The former
makes a business of athletics and the
latter considers sport a game'."
