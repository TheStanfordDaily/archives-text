# A.S.S.U. Reduces Rates For Friday Nights' Work-Out
## 
### 
Throwing traditions to the wind, and
disregarding all mercenary motives,
the A. S. S. U. is giving a dance to
morrow night in the Women's Club
house and is charging only 75 cents
per couple.
The dance will be a nine-to-twelve
affair, and the justly-famous Whitmer
orchestra will officiate. This will be
the only campus dance until the next
night, so local queeners will probably
rush to enjoy their last chance for
worship at Terpsichore's shrine for
twenty-four long hours. Decorations
will be provided by the roughs' sweat
ers seen through the windows and re
freshments will be served at the Cellar
at so much per.
