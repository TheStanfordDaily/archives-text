# AMERICAN RUGBY TEAM PLAYS CANADIAN ASSOCIATION
## Nine Stanford Players Will Take Part in Contest At Vancouver 
### 
The same American rugby team that
won the championship at the Olympic
games last summer will play the Brit- j
ish Columbia Rugby Association team i
in Vancouver during the Christmas
holidays.
Ten members of this team were
Stanford men and, with the exception
of Dick Hyland, who is now in Paris, j
all are readily available and expect i
to play in these games.
Sam Goodman, manager of the!
team, announced yesterday that R. C.
Cooper, secretary of the Canadian or- 1
ganlzation, has guaranteed the ex- i
penses of the American team and final
acceptance of the invitation to" play i
has -been made.
After playing host to Californian
rugby teams at Christmas time for a;
number of years the Canadians are j
anxious to have the Olympic cham
pions on their schedule this year.
Games have been arranged in Van
couver for Christmas Day, December
27, and New Year's Day. As yet the
Canadian teams have not been se
lected but the likely candidates are
Vancouver College, a club team from
the Vancouver Rugby Union, and a
third team from another part of Brit
ish Columbia.
First Practice This Month
The first practice date for the San
Francisco men has been set for No-j
vember 23 on Ewing Field. Thereafter
regular Sunday practice will be held.
Nearly all of the team lives in or
near San Francisco so that Captain j
Colby Slater expects to get the team
together again almost intact.
John Patrick, Norm Cleaveland, Dud
DeGroot, Phillip Clarke, W. L. Rogers, i
Bob Austin, Lin Farish, Charles Doe, j
and Bob Devereaux, all Stanford men,
are near at hand and have been keep
ing in good condition. Several have
been playing American football this
fall.
"Dink" Templeton, "Scotchy" Camp
bell, "Red" Meehan, and John Muldoon
are veteran players that are expected
to make a strong bid for a regular
! berth on the team.
About twenty men will make the
trip north and because some of the
regulars will be unable to make the
trip during the Christmas Holidays,
I some thirty additional candidates are
i expected to report for practice.
