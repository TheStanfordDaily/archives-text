# MORMONS ON WAY WEST TO TACKLE CARDS SATURDAY
## Coach Fitzpatrick Brings Twenty-Five-Man Squad For Berkeley Game 
### Hugh Hollembeak 
Firmly resolved to make their un
heralded appearance on the Pacific
Coast the opportunity of putting them
selves on the Far West football map,
j Coach T. M. Fitzpatrick and twenty
five of his University of Utah players
left Salt Lake City today for Berkeley
where they will meet the Stanford
; varsity Saturday afternoon in the Me
. morial Stadium.
| It will be the Mormons' first appear
-1 ance in California since 1919 when
! they suffered a beating at the hands
of Andy Smith's Bears and the boys
from the City of the Saints figure that
i this is their best chance to avenge
| that blot on their record. At any rate
j such is the conclusion most readily
drawn from the avidity with which
they took the date proferred them by
Paul Davis following the cancellation
of the U. S. C. game.
Cards Are Favorites
Just what chances the visiting
eleven has of putting over a win is
hard to say because of the dearth of
material for comparison, but the fact
that Utah has already dropped three
games this year and has eight men
playing their first year on the varsity
indicates that "Pop" Warner's Cards
should come through with a victory.
Drake, Cplorado, and Colorado Col
lege are the institutions that have
scored wins over the Mormons this
year, but with the exception of the
game with Drake the scores have been
close.
The Des Moines outfit ran off with a
34 to 14 victory over Fitzpatrick's
charges, but the fact that Drake is
now leading the Missouri Valley Con
ference casts some light on the game.
