# MORMONS ON WAY WEST TO TACKLE CARDS SATURDAY
## Coach Fitzpatrick Brings Twenty-Five-Man Squad For Berkeley Game 
### Hugh Hollembeak 
Firmly resolved to make their un
heralded appearance on the Pacific
Coast the opportunity of putting them
selves on the Far West football map,
j Coach T. M. Fitzpatrick and twenty
five of his University of Utah players
left Salt Lake City today for Berkeley
where they will meet the Stanford
; varsity Saturday afternoon in the Me
. morial Stadium.
| It will be the Mormons' first appear
-1 ance in California since 1919 when
! they suffered a beating at the hands
of Andy Smith's Bears and the boys
from the City of the Saints figure that
i this is their best chance to avenge
| that blot on their record. At any rate
j such is the conclusion most readily
drawn from the avidity with which
they took the date proferred them by
Paul Davis following the cancellation
of the U. S. C. game.
Cards Are Favorites
Just what chances the visiting
eleven has of putting over a win is
hard to say because of the dearth of
material for comparison, but the fact
that Utah has already dropped three
games this year and has eight men
playing their first year on the varsity
indicates that "Pop" Warner's Cards
should come through with a victory.
Drake, Cplorado, and Colorado Col
lege are the institutions that have
scored wins over the Mormons this
year, but with the exception of the
game with Drake the scores have been
close.
The Des Moines outfit ran off with a
34 to 14 victory over Fitzpatrick's
charges, but the fact that Drake is
now leading the Missouri Valley Con
ference casts some light on the game.
Utah won from Arizona 32 to 6, prac
tically the same score the Trojans
made against the same team, and this
performance speaks well for the vic
tor's ability.
Mormons Flashy
In spite of the fact that most of
the players are rather green there are !
a number of flashy performers on the i
invading squad. Two of the greatest
speed-burners in the Rocky Mountains j
are seen at the halfback positions in
the persons of Captain Reid Jewkes I
and Gene Livingston. Both are bear-!
cats at circling the ends and once in i
the open they are hard to stop.
The line is fairly heavy, averaging J
above 185 pounds to the man. Fitzpat-:
rick is bringing two entire lines and 1
three backfields, preferring to take no I
chances on the conditions his men will
encounter playing on a foreign field
and in lower altitude.
Against this array Warner will send |
his first string in an effort to give them 1
a good work-out in preparation for the j
Big Game. A tough contest such as
the U. S. C. game promised to be is 1
the thing most needed by the Cards at 1
their present stage of development and
it is hoped that the team will have to
extend itself against Utah, thus giving
the local coaching staff a chance to
see the outfit handle itself when real!
opposition is encountered.
Nevers May Play
What Warner will do about Nevers j
is still somewhat in the air. Rumor,
has it that Pop may keep him out of:
the game the rest of the year, saving 1
him for another season's varsity com
petition, but there is no confirmation
of the report. Ernie has been scrim
maging regularly with the team in
practice and he looks ready to take
his place in the line-up. Rumors not
withstanding. a great many followers
of the sport will go to Berkeley Satur-:
day with full expectation of seeing:
the Ail-American back in action.
The rest of the squad is in good
shape with the exception of Thomas,
who is still out of uniform. Warner
has not announced his starting line-up
yet but in view of his snappy playing
while he was in the Santa Clara game
it would not be surprising to see
Johnny Garthwaite at half when the
opening whistle blows.
The pass of Cleaveland's that Garth
waite grabbed last Friday was the
most encouraging work in the over
head game that has happened on the
Farm this year, while the way Johnny
scoots around end means the addition
of speed to the Cards' somewhat pon
derous backfleld.
Backfield the Same
Cleaveland and Solomon are safe
bets to start while Middleton and Ted
Shipkey are running neck and neck
for the rail at left end. Captain Law
son and Bill Neill will be back at their
regular berths while the rest of the
forwards will be the same as last
Friday.
Utah will line up as follows: Taufer,
left end; Dykeman, left tackle; Ryan,
left guard; Ha gen, center; Whiting,
right guard; Williams, right tackle;
Morris, right end; Champion, quarter;
Livingston, left half; .Jewkes, right
half; and Whitney, full.
