# REHEARSALS BEGIN FOR MOB SCENE IN R.U.R. PRODUCTION
## 
### 
The first rehearsal of the mu.,
scenes in "R. U. R.," the Sword and
Sandals play which will be given a
week from tomorrow night, were held
last evening in the Assmbly hall. Fif
teen men are being used in this scene,
which is expected to be the most
dramatic episode in a play full of
tense melodrama and hair-raising
scenic effects.
Les Kiler is in charge of the stage
settings, and the sets which he has
already constructed are said to be the
exact replicas of the settings in the
original play as produced in New York
by the Theatre Guild. Wrought-iron
windows are a feature of the first act,
an effect which Kiler has managed to
obtain in a very clever manner.
The seat sale for "R. U. R." will be
gin next Tuesday in the Administra
tion building. The new scale of popu
lar prices, seventy-five cents and one
dollar, is expected to increase the
usual sale of tickets. Immediately fol
lowing the play, there will be a dance
j in one of the halls, under the auspices
i of Sword and Sandals society.
