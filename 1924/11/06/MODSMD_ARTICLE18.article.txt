# Sanity in Viewpoints
## 
### 
The "Viewpoint" institution was created by the Daily as a medium
for student opinion—be it right or wrong. It is within the power of the
editor to draw a line, but that line is drawn reluctantly and generally to
prevent a subject from being worked beyond all limits. Every Stanford
student is an owner of the paper, and as such he has the right to open
any question he may see fit.
Viewpoints, however, which are erroneous, misleading, vicious, or
totally unaccompanied by proof or by any possibility of proof—or all of
them put together—will immediately call forth a storm of student and
official rebuttal which will reform any persons who may have held such
opinions without putting them into print. Viewpoints have that as their
one object. They bring up questions relating to the students, and settle
them if they are worth settling. If they include nothing to be settled,
they are properly squashed by the proper squashers—those who know the
facts, and the truth, of the disputed question and are willing to set the
uninformed on the real track.
A viewpoint containing 110 germ of the truth is printed for just one
reason. Possibly there may be others who are equally benighted, and still
others who are not quite certain one way or the other. Those others are
benefited by an airing of the question, and it is settled definitely and ade
quately with no possibility for pernicious and inaccurate sub rosa dis
cussion. >

My Dear Mr. Collins:
I have read with considerable interestryour letter in regard to the ath
letic situation which appeared in last night's Daily Palo Alto. I think
it is regrettable that you should have seen fit to publish this since it only
gives another idea for the public, which is already rather muddled over the
whole affair, to worry about.
The idea presented by you in your letter is really beside the point.
The real reason for the break with U. S. C. was, as stated in the official
communication, that a continuance of further athletic relations was not in
the best interests of intercollegiate sport. No particular case of profes
sionalism or scholastic standing or proselyting of athletes gave rise to this
situation, the fact being that U. S. C. differed radically from Stanford
and California in its point of view toward intercollegiate athletics. This
difference in the point of view had led to a great deal of bitter feeling be
tween the alumni, the students and the members of the teams of the sev
eral institutions and thereby created an intolerable situation which it
seemed best to end. •
Referring to your remarks in regard to the activities of the alumni in
procuring athletics, I can only say that this is a problem which confronts
every university. At each institution the pernicious activities are so
mixed withe influences for good that a great harm would be done in at
tempting to» check these activities, even if such an attempt were possible.
If you have any constructive criticism to make in the handling of this
problem I feel sure that not only the authorities at Stanford but also the
authorities tit every other university in the country will be glad to listen
to you.
If you have any information that any of our varsity or freshman play
ers have professionalized themselves in outside competition either before
or after entering Stanford we would greatly appreciate receiving this in
formation, and in view of yoty published instinuations it is your duty to
give us this information. You may rest assured that we will not only
investigate these cases but if your statements are proved correct the men
involved will be immediately disqualified for further competition at Stan
ford and their names made public. If you are only speaking on hearsay
evidence, I think your published remarks are reprehensible since it is such
remarks as these that start suspicion and distrust and .unless they are
backed up by real evidence are only a source of trouble.
I would have much preferred taking this matter up with you personally
instead of answering through the columns of the press because I feel that
since our relations with U. S. C. are now at an end further public discus
sion is very inadvisable.
Sincerely yours,
W. H. BARROW, M.D.

The "Viewpoint" institution was created by the Daily as a medium
for student opinion—be it right or wrong. It is within the power of the
editor to draw a line, but that line is drawn reluctantly and generally to
prevent a subject from being worked beyond all limits. Every Stanford
student is an owner of the paper, and as such he has the right to open
any question he may see fit.
Viewpoints, however, which are erroneous, misleading, vicious, or
totally unaccompanied by proof or by any possibility of proof—or all of
them put together—will immediately call forth a storm of student and
official rebuttal which will reform any persons who may have held such
opinions without putting them into print. Viewpoints have that as their
one object. They bring up questions relating to the students, and settle
them if they are worth settling. If they include nothing to be settled,
they are properly squashed by the proper squashers—those who know the
facts, and the truth, of the disputed question and are willing to set the
uninformed on the real track.
A viewpoint containing 110 germ of the truth is printed for just one
reason. Possibly there may be others who are equally benighted, and still
others who are not quite certain one way or the other. Those others are
benefited by an airing of the question, and it is settled definitely and ade

My Dear Mr. Collins:
I have read with considerable interestryour letter in regard to the ath
letic situation which appeared in last night's Daily Palo Alto. I think
it is regrettable that you should have seen fit to publish this since it only
gives another idea for the public, which is already rather muddled over the
whole affair, to worry about.
The idea presented by you in your letter is really beside the point.
The real reason for the break with U. S. C. was, as stated in the official
communication, that a continuance of further athletic relations was not in
the best interests of intercollegiate sport. No particular case of profes
sionalism or scholastic standing or proselyting of athletes gave rise to this
situation, the fact being that U. S. C. differed radically from Stanford
and California in its point of view toward intercollegiate athletics. This
difference in the point of view had led to a great deal of bitter feeling be
tween the alumni, the students and the members of the teams of the sev
eral institutions and thereby created an intolerable situation which it
seemed best to end. •
Referring to your remarks in regard to the activities of the alumni in
procuring athletics, I can only say that this is a problem which confronts
every university. At each institution the pernicious activities are so
mixed withe influences for good that a great harm would be done in at
tempting to» check these activities, even if such an attempt were possible.
If you have any constructive criticism to make in the handling of this
problem I feel sure that not only the authorities at Stanford but also the
authorities tit every other university in the country will be glad to listen
to you.
If you have any information that any of our varsity or freshman play
ers have professionalized themselves in outside competition either before
or after entering Stanford we would greatly appreciate receiving this in
formation, and in view of yoty published instinuations it is your duty to
give us this information. You may rest assured that we will not only
investigate these cases but if your statements are proved correct the men
involved will be immediately disqualified for further competition at Stan
ford and their names made public. If you are only speaking on hearsay
evidence, I think your published remarks are reprehensible since it is such
remarks as these that start suspicion and distrust and .unless they are
backed up by real evidence are only a source of trouble.
I would have much preferred taking this matter up with you personally

formation, and in view of yoty published instinuations it is your duty to
give us this information. You may rest assured that we will not only
investigate these cases but if your statements are proved correct the men
involved will be immediately disqualified for further competition at Stan
ford and their names made public. If you are only speaking on hearsay
evidence, I think your published remarks are reprehensible since it is such
remarks as these that start suspicion and distrust and .unless they are
backed up by real evidence are only a source of trouble.
I would have much preferred taking this matter up with you personally
instead of answering through the columns of the press because I feel that
since our relations with U. S. C. are now at an end further public discus
sion is very inadvisable.
Sincerely yours,
W. H. BARROW, M.D.
