# JORDAN WILL SPEAK ON "SCIOSOPHY AND SCIENCE" TOMORROW
## 
### 
"Science and Sciosophy" will be the
subject of Dr. Jordan's lecture at 7:30
tonight in his home.
"The word sciosophy," said Dr. Jor
dan, "was coined by me in 1899 to
meet a long-felt want and means sys
tematized ignorance. It differs from
ordinary science in its basis, as it is
not derived from tested and verified
human experience. Instruments of pre
cision, logic, mathematics, the micro
scope and telescope are not needed in
-the study of sciosophy."
According to Dr. Jordan sciosophy
in action is called magic, and latent
magic is mystery. "Ignorance is the
most delightful science in the world
because it is acquired without labor or
pains and keeps the mind from melan
choly."
