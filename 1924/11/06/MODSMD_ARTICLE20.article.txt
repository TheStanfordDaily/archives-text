# THE 						LAW STEPS

<$> V. G. D. <s>
This prolific deluge of "Viewpoints"
is most encouraging. Between a fright
ful song, born for naught, a worse
cheer-leader, and seniors who deliber
ately run away with purple dink-lin
ings one would think we were as deli
cate in choosing our entering students
as U. S. C. If the critics would only
refrain from signing their protests
with "yours respectively . . ."!
It is when a man comes to his senior
year that the "mood for education"
begins to pervade his soul. When he
is about to leave he feels ready to
begin study in earnest. Then comes
that questioning look, mis-translated
by the classes below as "dignity," and
which is in reality the dawning realiza
tion of utter incapability. That is the
cause of.the senior sombrero. It covers
the windows of the soul, and permits
of deep thought. The freshman head
covering is necessarily, and propor
tionately, more minute. You see him
coming, shining face absorbing all;
while the man in whose tracks he is
\%alking, acknowledges the world only
by a thoughtful chin beneath the brim
of a wide, grey hat.
"... delicately devised forms of
snobbery . . ."
near sightedness;
"Cabbages;"
house bills;
"Oh, hello there!"
brief cases;
the Law steps.
A certain portion of our country has
been described as "a spectacle of mil
lions of insects all swarming upwards
towards the light" . . . seeking a col
lege diploma. In nine cases out of ten
the goal of all their striving is medi
ocrity: to queen a little, "to get fair
grades, and, after graduation, to "go
into busines," marry, and have a
"semi-colonial house with porcelain
tubs and hardwood floors."
Among them, of course, there are a
few of the brilliant, ambitious ones
who will use more than can be given
to them. But public opinion is always
mediocre .. . the exceptional man,
the thinker is something to be
shunned. To secure public opinion—
whether in a presidential campaign in
Abilene, Kan., or for social prestige
here on the campus—a man has to be,
or pretend to be, mediocre. If he is
more than ordinarily studious, or lazy,
or brilliant, he becomes an oddity.
And mediocrity is impelled from "the
different" like opposite poles of a mag
net.
Those who have been stealing
Lafayette photographs from the bas
ketball pavilion deserve no better pun
ishment than to have to look at their
spoils every time they enter their
rooms.
We think the prize for perfect sclf
control should be given with honors
to the freshman who, when the back
oif the roadster to which he was airily
adhering swung around Engineer's
corner, seating him violently on the
ground, shouted with his next breath:
"Hey, wait a minute! You lost some
thing!"
