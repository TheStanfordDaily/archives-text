# BRANDSTEN PREDICTS GOOD YEAR FOR BABE WATER POLO SEVEN
## 
### 
Stanford's 1928 water polo team
will be the best yearling aggregation
which has represented the Cardinal
in three years.
Such was the prediction of Coach
Ernie Brandsten after watching the
babes trounce a mixed team which in
cluded one or two varsity men in a
practice game in Encina pool yester
day. Although they have only been
working out for two weeks, the fresh
men already show promise of develop
ing into a light, fast scoring combina
tion.
Luster and Andrews loom as a de
pendable pair of forwards. Both men
have had experience at the sport in
the south, and with a little more prac
tice should be dangerous goal-shooters.
Kinkead and Mentz are other likely
candidates for forward berths.
Ernie will not lack a strong back
fleld with Vanden Akker, Klein, and
Maltby bidding for positions. The lat
ter has played in the southern part
of the state.
Berkeley Game Likely
From present indications the weak
est spot on the freshman seven will
be goal-keeper. A number of green
men are out for the job, but none of
them have shown sufficient stuff to
satisfy the blue-eyed Card mentor.
After the close of the football season
the squad will be strengthened by the
addition of seasoned material, includ
ing Lawrence and Birnie* Dorcy.
A game will in all likelihood be
scheduled with Berkeley high school
before the end of the quarter in order
to give the freshmen some competi
tion before the active season opens.
Although recently defeated by the
California freshmen, the prep-school
ers are credited with a first-class
squad.
