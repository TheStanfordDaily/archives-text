# Chappie Cries for Copy; Old Boy Has a Craving For Many Short Jokes
## 
### 
The Old Boy is destitute! He must
have a bracing batch of copy before
Saturday, or the Big Game Issue will
dwindle to a shadow of the magnifi
cent magazine it was intended to be. '
Art work galore has been tnrned in,
but there is a positive dearth of liter
ary material. Especially are all Chap- 1
pies and prospective Chappies asked
to write short stuff, two-line jokes and
the like. Remember, Saturday is the j
deadline.
University of Idaho is this year giv- j
ing standard mental tests to all new
students.
