# Step In Sidewalk Potential Danger; Removal Started
## 
### 
After causing many serious acci
dents, a small step from the arcade
down to the sidewalk in front of the
Memorial Church is now being re
moved.
Several people have stepped back
from under the arcade to look at the
mosaic on the front of the church, and
have been many accidents, from dislo
the two-inch step. As a result there
have been many accidents from dislo
cated fingers to broken hips, accord- j
ing to Comptroller Roth. Work began,
on the changing of the present grade j
of sidewalk where the step is, and also j
some distance back.
