# "TURKEY RACE" WILL BE STAGED ON EASY COURSE NOVEMBER 15
## 
### 
Runners in the intramural cross
country "turkey race" on November
15 will have the advantage of compet
ing over the easiest and shortest
course ever laid out for a similar con
test, according to C. W. Davis, direc
tor of intramural athletics.
The race will start with three-quar
ters of a lap around the stadium track,
after which it will follow out the open
end of the horseshoe, along the old
varsity oval, make a left turn, and go
past the Military department and
straight across the highway polo field
to the fence.
From that point the runners will
canter up Frenchman's Gulch and over
to the Sigma Nu house. This is the
steepest lap of the course and the only
one which will severely test the wind
of the contestants.
From the Sigma Nu house the chase
will lead back across the fields past
Branner, and along the old oval, finish
ing in front of the Stanford rooting
section at the Montana game. The
length of the run is approximately
three miles.
Course Marked With Flags
The course has been marked with
flags to give entrants an opportunity
to familiarize themselves with the
route before the race. Few entries
have yet been sent in by living groups.
DAvis urges each fraternity and club
to enroll as many men as possible be
fore November 11. All men in the Uni
versity are eligible, with the exception
of those who have won letters in track
or cross-country at Stanford or any
college granting the A. B. degree.
The first three men of each organiza
tion to finish are the only ones who
count in the final standing, but the
greater the number of entrants from
each group the brighter will be the
group's chances for victory and two
ten-pound turkeys, the substitutes for
the placque formerly given the win
ning team.
