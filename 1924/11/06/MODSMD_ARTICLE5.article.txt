# Randolph Stars
## 
### 
This same Randolph played a pretty
game at full for Dave Manoccir's
charges, his punts invariably carrying'
high and far, while his work at ad- j
vancing the ball was noteworthy. He j
was assisted in the latter department j
by Morgan, who made some nice gains
and put up a pretty defensive game;
as well. In the line, Stockbridge, who
had been shifted from full to guard,
proved to be a-find. He stopped up
the hole which caused' the juniors so
much trouble in their opening game
and made himself generally useful by
breaking through and smearing up
plays before they were fairly started.
Briggs looked good at end.
The frosh put up another loose game
and with the exception of Thompson,
who played at one of the wings, they
seemed entirely at sea. Their only
good work was on the defensive where
they were fairly effective at holding
the juniors. On the offensive they had
nothing, all of their gains being made
in midfield where they availed but
little.
