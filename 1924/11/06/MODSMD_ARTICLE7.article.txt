# McCALLISTER HAS PARTY BUT GUESTS FAIL TO SHOW UP
## Voices of Faithful Ones Are Echoed by Empty Seats At Pavilion Rally 
### 
When Yell Leader McCallister took
1 charge of the rally in the pavilion last
! night, he found before him an audi
! ence that could have formed a single-
I file serpentine from the pavilion to
; Encina —almost. And if they had done
j so, and the other 450 freshmen had
| joined them there, they might have
| marched back and had a good rally.
The general (for such he seems to
have become) was there, with all his
staff; but the infant —ry failed to ap
pear, and it was only the heavy artil
lery, in the form of feature musical
numbers, that saved the whole cam
paign from disaster. Tyroler's orches
tra played several popular selections,
and Allen Campbell presented a piano- j
logue skit.
The only speaker on the program
was Coach "Husky" Hunt of the fresh
man eleven, who asked for the sup
port of the rooting section at the Little
Big Game next Saturday.
"If you're going to get the Mother \
Bear, you've got to catch the Cub j
first," said Hunt. "And if you want
the babes to win, just let them know
about it —they will do the rest."
The few yells which were rehearsed,
under the direction of McCallister and!
his assistants, sounded unduly like the i
old family organ with a leaky bellows
—which is no reflection upon the or
ganists.
