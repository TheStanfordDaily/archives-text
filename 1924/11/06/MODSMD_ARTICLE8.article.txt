# FIRST COMPETITIVE PRACTICE HELD BY CARD POLO SQUAD
## 
### 
First competitive practice for the
1924 horse polo squad was held yes
terday on the Highway field.
Some twenty men participated in
short periods giving the first display
of teamwork during the present sea
son. Different combinations were tried
and a general workout was held by
Captain John M. Jenkins, Jr., polo
coach, in an attempt to ascertain the
progress in playing ability of the
team.
Captain Jenkins, who came to Stan
ford at the opening of the present
year, is installing a new polo coaching
system which he believes will in a
short time give Stanford the strongest
squad in the history of this activity.
Heretofore, Cardinal polo teams have
been made up of a limited number of
men who played an entirely individu
alistic game with a lack of teamwork.
Scores depended largely on the indi
vidual work of a f?w stars and when
there was a vacancy for a certain
position there was no man to fill it
with-the result that the team suffered
a handicap.
Fundamentals Learned
Under the new method, Captain
Jenkins is starting with the fundamen
tals of the game. The past four weeks
all players, old and new, have been
drilled only in the basic elements of
the game. No competition has been
given. In this manner it is hoped to
train a reserve that will be for the
most part equally as well-trained as
the regular line-up.
While the playing yesterday was
ragged, there was a general display of
teamwork that has heretofore been
lacking in Stanford*teams. Raggedness
was due to a lack of practice in com
petition and Jenkins expects to iron
this out within a short time. Individu
alism was lacking and the various
teams that went into the field were
well-balanced in playing power.
Because of the time taken in follow
ing out his plans Cifptain Jenkins has
as yet not scheduled any outside
games for the future. However, within
a month he expects to match his men
against one of the army teams either
from San Francisco or Monterey. By
that time he figures that the training
will have progressed far enough to
justify real competition.

squad in the history of this activity.
Heretofore, Cardinal polo teams have
been made up of a limited number of
men who played an entirely individu
alistic game with a lack of teamwork.
Scores depended largely on the indi
vidual work of a f?w stars and when
there was a vacancy for a certain
position there was no man to fill it
with-the result that the team suffered
a handicap.
Fundamentals Learned
Under the new method, Captain
Jenkins is starting with the fundamen
tals of the game. The past four weeks
all players, old and new, have been
drilled only in the basic elements of
the game. No competition has been
given. In this manner it is hoped to
train a reserve that will be for the
most part equally as well-trained as
the regular line-up.
While the playing yesterday was
ragged, there was a general display of
teamwork that has heretofore been
lacking in Stanford*teams. Raggedness
was due to a lack of practice in com
petition and Jenkins expects to iron
this out within a short time. Individu
alism was lacking and the various
teams that went into the field were
well-balanced in playing power.
Because of the time taken in follow
ing out his plans Cifptain Jenkins has
as yet not scheduled any outside
games for the future. However, within
a month he expects to match his men
against one of the army teams either
from San Francisco or Monterey. By
that time he figures that the training
will have progressed far enough to
justify real competition.
