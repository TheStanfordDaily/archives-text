# STANFORD FRESHMAN ELEVEN FACES BRUIN CUBS TOMORROW
## Hunt to Start Game With Changed Team After Experimenting For Favorable Combinations 
### Douglas Meservey 
JUST a bit of polish this afternoon, and tomorrow the Stanford freshman
eleven will be properly "set" for the annual "Little Big Game." As usual,
"Pesky" Sprott comes down from Berkeley with everything supposedly in his
favor. That is, as far as comparative scores go.
The Card mentor has had an uphill fight this season. Some freshman
coaches "fall into" borh material and experience at the start of a year but
"Hußky" had only the former. A great deal of his time has been spent in
shifting and effecting combinations until now he is about as satisfied as it is
jiossible for a coach to be.
Furthermore, Hunt has had to wrestle continually with the problem of
team morale. First it was over-confidence, then the other extreme —under-
confidence. The Trojan defeat took the former out of his charges besides
proving disastrous to the reputations of several backfield men who had
cockiness but no fight.
The starting line-up tomorrow will be, in effect, the culmination of a season
of numerous experiments. And the cheerful fact is that for each man staiting,

has a good substitute, and for j
j eacli combination —a similar one on ■
| the bench.
Backfield Powerful
His backfield, on paper, is as power
! ful and versatile as could be wished
I for. The only trouble is that injuries
have kept the backs from working to
gether until tomorrow's game; but in
dividually they have proved promising.
Millage, at full, .will undoubtedly
bear the brunt of the offense. He
kicks well, bucks the line better, is ab
solutely reliable on defense, and his
absence from the U. S. C. game meant
a loss of one of the guiding spirits of
the eleven.
Speedy Halves
Hill and Altaffer as halves will fur
nish most of the speed and interfer
ence. Hill has his chance to show that
he really is a football player and to
rectify some of his mid-season mis
takes; while Altaffer, a convalescent,
is the "dark horse." Backing them up
as reserves are Pabst, Dorcy, and
Nichols.
Murphy is the field general. Of all
the backfield, he has shown the least
number of weaknesses —being a capa
ble leader and sure on defense.
Robesky Outstanding Linesman
"Husky" is worrying little about his
line. All he wants is average improve-
ment and it should be enough. Captain
Robesky at tackle is probably the most
outstanding man of the forward -wall.
He has played almost continuously
since the first of the season and is
usually busy either piling up offense
or opening holes on offense. Post han
dles the other tackle just as well.
The ends were hard to choose. Den
nis and Vincenti start, but will be
hard-pressed to remain in the game
with Davidson, Montgomery, and Issell
on the waiting list.
In the center of the line, Mustain
has first choice at center with Bigelow
and Everett flanking him. No varsity
fullback could wish to buck heavier
opposition than this trio who have
worked well together for a majority
of the games. Haight, at center, and
Jardine, Morley, Helmke, and Maguire
compose the substitutes.
The California and Card line-ups are
as follows:
Stanford— California —
32 Dennis LER Bancroft 15
22 Robesky (c) LTR Greene 14
3 Bigelow - LGR Giddings 28
14 Mustain C Miller 27

39 Altaffer RHL Perrin 30
33 Millage F Zweiner 13
