# BABES MAKE PLANS FOR ERECTING BIG GAME BONFIRE PILE
## 
### 
Enthusiasm for the Big Bonfire pro
ject started off with a bang at the
meeting last night of the freshman
class in Encina hall. Cheers greeted
Jim Sapero, freshman president, when
he outlined the plans for making the
big bonfire pile which, according to
specifications, will be seventy feet
high and thirty by thirty at the base.
The committee in charge of the bon
fire is composed of Lee Bering, Lynn
Hosun, and Jim Sapero. The head of
the timekeeping committee is "Buck"
Mynard. Work on the structure will
begin Saturday morning when twenty
freshmen armed with picks and shov
els will break the ground for the holes
within which to place the posts. Mon
day afternoon will commence the real
work of raising the posts and making
some of the cross pieces.
Music furnished by the Cardinal
orchestra and two boxing matches, one
between "Mickey" Martin and "Kal"
Sapero and another between Sclioll
and Farnham made up the program
of the evening.
