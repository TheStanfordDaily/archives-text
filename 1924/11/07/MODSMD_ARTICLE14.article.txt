# APPLICATIONS FOR BIG GAME ROOTER TICKETS DUE NOW
## 
### 
There will be no open sale of
rooters' tickets for the Big Came.
All rooter tickets must be ob
tained by making application on
the blanks sent to every student
by the Board of Athletic Control.
These applications must all be in
the graduate manager's office no
later than six o'clock tomorrow.
Up to the present time only 1500
applications for rooters' tickets
have been made. This includes both
men and women, while last year
2200 tickets were sold to men
alone.
At California, the sale of rooters'
tickets is rapidly approaching the
seven thousand mark, according to
Tussing, who fears that there has
some misunderstanding auoui
the ticket sale.
Each student will be allowed to
get four general admission tickets.
Application for these tickets must
be sent in at the same time as the
rooter's ticket is requested.
