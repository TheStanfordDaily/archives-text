# TRAVELER BLAMES CHINESE WARS TO PASSIVE RESISTANCE
## H. A. Franck Tells of Safety To Foreigners in Spite Of Civil Strife 
### 
"The striking thing about the Chi-:
nese is their supine resistance. It is
the reason for their endurance of vi
cissitudes for so many years. They
give no retaliation to force, except j
under great provocation."
Such was the theory in regard to
the present state of the Chinese which
Harry A. Franck, recently back from
two and a half years in the Orient,
gave this morning in his talk, "The
Struggle for Power in China," before
a University assembly.
"Their only weapon of attack is
passive resistance," said Franck. He
claimed that it was the reason for so
much unhappiness now because the
people will not do anything when the
soldiers invade their homes.
Generals Rule China
"There are at least one hundred in
dependent generals in China ruling
the country," he said. "The only dif
ference between these and the bandits
so common there, is that the central
government does not recognize the
bandits.
In regard to-the treatment of for
eigners, Franck said, "Foreigners are
in no great danger in China. A woman
is absolutely safe on the streets there
alone in the middle of the night
whether she is bedecked with jewels
or not.
"The Chinese will even stop fighting
a battle in order to let foreigners pass
by, if a signal is given beforehand.
When there was so much agitation
concerning the bandits in China, my
wife and I laughed at the worried
tone of letters we received from the
United States, because there was no
danger."
Franck proclaimed that he could
not prophecy concerning the future of
the country. "There is a struggle for
power both inside the v country and out
side. You know of the recent recogni
tion of Bolshevists by the country.
The Bolshevists now have an ambassa
dor at Peking. Before this, they had
only ministers from foreign countries,
and so this new step means that it is
certain that ideas of the Bolshevists
must filter through China in a slight
degree."
Japan's attitude, according to the
traveler, has been strictly according
to the code drawn up at the Washing
ton Conference. They have not over
stepped the bounds of their authority.
Americans Influence
Americans, through their business
men and missionaries, have an influ
ence there. Through the sale of opium
to England, Italy, France, and the
United States, the Chinese are enabled
to buy arms for their civil war. This
condition, then, Franck concludes,
could be remedied if these countries
would not contribute to the coffers
of those engaged in this useless war.
He also told of his personal obser
vations of the civil strife in China, and
discussed the personalities of the dif
ferent generals.
"If I were Chinese and had to live
in China, I would rather live in the
North under Fung Shang or the other
generals ruling there, than under Sun
Yat Sun," he asserted. "Although he
himself may be honest he has a host
of rascally subordinates, and in the
vicinity of Canton, which he controls,
opium dens and gambling houses are
wide open."
It will be a great problem to try to
unite the country, in Franck's opinion.
"They speak the Mandarin language
all over China, except in the South,
from Shanghai to the far West. The
difference of climate and food between
the North and South causes soldiers
transported from one place to another
to die in great numbers," he declared.
"The striking thing about the Chi-:
nese is their supine resistance. It is

cissitudes for so many years. They

Franck proclaimed that he could
not prophecy concerning the future of
the country. "There is a struggle for
power both inside the v country and out
side. You know of the recent recogni
tion of Bolshevists by the country.
The Bolshevists now have an ambassa
dor at Peking. Before this, they had
only ministers from foreign countries,
and so this new step means that it is
certain that ideas of the Bolshevists
must filter through China in a slight
degree."
Japan's attitude, according to the
traveler, has been strictly according
to the code drawn up at the Washing
ton Conference. They have not over
stepped the bounds of their authority.
Americans Influence
Americans, through their business
men and missionaries, have an influ
ence there. Through the sale of opium
to England, Italy, France, and the
United States, the Chinese are enabled
to buy arms for their civil war. This
condition, then, Franck concludes,
could be remedied if these countries
would not contribute to the coffers
of those engaged in this useless war.
He also told of his personal obser
vations of the civil strife in China, and
discussed the personalities of the dif
ferent generals.
"If I were Chinese and had to live
in China, I would rather live in the
North under Fung Shang or the other
generals ruling there, than under Sun
Yat Sun," he asserted. "Although he
himself may be honest he has a host
of rascally subordinates, and in the
vicinity of Canton, which he controls,
opium dens and gambling houses are
wide open."
It will be a great problem to try to
unite the country, in Franck's opinion.
"They speak the Mandarin language
all over China, except in the South,
from Shanghai to the far West. The
difference of climate and food between
the North and South causes soldiers
transported from one place to another
to die in great numbers," he declared.
"The striking thing about the Chi-:
nese is their supine resistance. It is
the reason for their endurance of vi
cissitudes for so many years. They
give no retaliation to force, except j
under great provocation."
Such was the theory in regard to
the present state of the Chinese which
Harry A. Franck, recently back from
two and a half years in the Orient,
gave this morning in his talk, "The
Struggle for Power in China," before
a University assembly.
"Their only weapon of attack is
passive resistance," said Franck. He
claimed that it was the reason for so
much unhappiness now because the
people will not do anything when the
soldiers invade their homes.
Generals Rule China
"There are at least one hundred in
dependent generals in China ruling
the country," he said. "The only dif
ference between these and the bandits
so common there, is that the central
government does not recognize the
bandits.
In regard to-the treatment of for
eigners, Franck said, "Foreigners are
in no great danger in China. A woman
is absolutely safe on the streets there
alone in the middle of the night
whether she is bedecked with jewels
or not.
"The Chinese will even stop fighting
a battle in order to let foreigners pass
by, if a signal is given beforehand.
When there was so much agitation
concerning the bandits in China, my
wife and I laughed at the worried
tone of letters we received from the
United States, because there was no
danger."

the country. "There is a struggle for
