# TRAVELER BLAMES CHINESE WARS TO PASSIVE RESISTANCE
## H. A. Franck Tells of Safety To Foreigners in Spite Of Civil Strife 
### 
"The striking thing about the Chi-:
nese is their supine resistance. It is
the reason for their endurance of vi
cissitudes for so many years. They
give no retaliation to force, except j
under great provocation."
Such was the theory in regard to
the present state of the Chinese which
Harry A. Franck, recently back from
two and a half years in the Orient,
gave this morning in his talk, "The
Struggle for Power in China," before
a University assembly.
"Their only weapon of attack is
passive resistance," said Franck. He
claimed that it was the reason for so
much unhappiness now because the
people will not do anything when the
soldiers invade their homes.
Generals Rule China
"There are at least one hundred in
dependent generals in China ruling
the country," he said. "The only dif
ference between these and the bandits
so common there, is that the central
government does not recognize the
bandits.
In regard to-the treatment of for
eigners, Franck said, "Foreigners are
in no great danger in China. A woman
is absolutely safe on the streets there
alone in the middle of the night
whether she is bedecked with jewels
or not.
"The Chinese will even stop fighting
a battle in order to let foreigners pass
by, if a signal is given beforehand.
When there was so much agitation
concerning the bandits in China, my
wife and I laughed at the worried
tone of letters we received from the
United States, because there was no
danger."
