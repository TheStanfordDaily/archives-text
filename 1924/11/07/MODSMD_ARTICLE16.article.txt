# ONRUSH OF MAN-HUNTERS STOPS R.U.R. REHEARSALS
## Admiring Females Crash Gate In Efforts To Catch Glimpse Of Leading Man 
### 
The only thing that is worrying the j
producers of "R. U. R." is how to
keep admiring females from interrupt- j
ing the rehearsals in order to have a!
look at and, if they are lucky, to talk ,
with Alan Robertson, the leading man i
in the play.
Ever since Robertson was chosen,
for the hero in "R. U. R.," Gordon j
Davis has been besieged with re
quests from members of the Five
Hundred for any sort of work around
the dramatic department, even the
most menial tasks becoming desirable
in the eyes of these hero-worshiping,
stage-struck damosels.
Robertson, however, remains as
calm as a John throughout j
the trying ordeal, and succeeds very j
well in trying to conceal his distaste
for such bold admiration. "I realize
that I am, perhaps, in a very peculiar
position, being, as I am, the only
; leading man on the campus, so I am
endeavoring to bear this undue inter
| est in myself as part of niy art, and
\ as something to be borne with a

smile," said Robertson, when inter
viewed today between answering the
telephone and doorbell, and getting
ont of about a dozen dates which were,
almost forced upon him.
"R. U. R." will not only prove to be
a melodramatic thriller but will offer
to the campus one of the most popular
and good-looking leading men that has
ever graced the Stanford stage. The
justly-famous Honorable Hockus Chal
mers has said that Robertson reminds
him of the days when he himself was
in his prime, which is praise indeed.
