# ERNIE NEVERS TO PLAY FuLL AGAINST UTAH
## Light Utah Backfield Doped As Strongest Unit of Visiting Team 
### David Meiklejohn 
Ernie Nevers, 205-pound Cardinal
fullback, is officially on the Stanford
starting line-up for the Stanford-Uni
versity of Utah game, to be played in
the California Memorial Stadium to
morrow at 2:30.
| This will be the first time Nevers
has been on the line-up of a scheduled
game, and will be his first appearance
since the injury sustained in a prac
tice game with the U. S. S. Nevada.
A great deal will depend on the
showing of Nevers tomorrow. Not from
the standpoint that he need be any
factor in attempting to defeat the
Mormons, but simply from the selfish
comparative angle. In considering the
coming all-important California game
Nevers will assume the chief role, and
it will mean a great deal to see Nevers
playing as he did last year.
Mormons on Offensive
The Mormon aggregation from all
reports is ready to furnish a little of
fensive competition. Captain Jewkes,
an ail-American candidate last year,
i is one of the Utah threats in the back
field. Livingston, at left half, is an
other fast man. Evidently the Mor
mons are planning a little open field
offensive. The backfield is decidedly
light, the fullback weighing but 178
pounds. This fact makes it improbable
that Utah will attempt many off-tackle
bucks.
In the first place they probably have
taken into consideration that the Stan
ford line is the strongest unit of the
Card team. In the second place the
Mormon line is somewhat lighter than
the Cardinal defense. Ryan, left guard,
and Williams, left tackle, are the most
formidable linesmen.
Mitchell at Quarter
Howard Mitchell is slated to start
at quarterback for Stanford. Mitchell
has been out of the game with a bum
shoulder for a few weeks. He is espe
cially good on a defensive game
against a team using open field plays.
Ted Shipkey, due probably to his
creditable work in the Santa Clara
game, will play next to his brother
Harry at left end. Shipkey has crashed
through well this year and has the
makings of a good wing man.

Ernie Nevers, 205-pound Cardinal
fullback, is officially on the Stanford
starting line-up for the Stanford-Uni
versity of Utah game, to be played in
the California Memorial Stadium to
morrow at 2:30.
| This will be the first time Nevers
has been on the line-up of a scheduled
game, and will be his first appearance
since the injury sustained in a prac
tice game with the U. S. S. Nevada.
A great deal will depend on the
showing of Nevers tomorrow. Not from
the standpoint that he need be any
factor in attempting to defeat the
Mormons, but simply from the selfish
comparative angle. In considering the
coming all-important California game
Nevers will assume the chief role, and
it will mean a great deal to see Nevers
playing as he did last year.
Mormons on Offensive
The Mormon aggregation from all
reports is ready to furnish a little of
fensive competition. Captain Jewkes,
an ail-American candidate last year,
i is one of the Utah threats in the back
field. Livingston, at left half, is an
other fast man. Evidently the Mor
mons are planning a little open field
offensive. The backfield is decidedly
light, the fullback weighing but 178
pounds. This fact makes it improbable
that Utah will attempt many off-tackle
bucks.
In the first place they probably have
taken into consideration that the Stan
ford line is the strongest unit of the
Card team. In the second place the
Mormon line is somewhat lighter than
the Cardinal defense. Ryan, left guard,
and Williams, left tackle, are the most
formidable linesmen.
Mitchell at Quarter
Howard Mitchell is slated to start
at quarterback for Stanford. Mitchell
has been out of the game with a bum
shoulder for a few weeks. He is espe
cially good on a defensive game
against a team using open field plays.
Ted Shipkey, due probably to his
creditable work in the Santa Clara
game, will play next to his brother
Harry at left end. Shipkey has crashed
through well this year and has the
makings of a good wing man.
