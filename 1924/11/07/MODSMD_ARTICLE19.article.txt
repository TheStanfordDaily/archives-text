"The great needs of uueducated men
may be summed up in two things, a
pillar to lean against and a bosom to
cry into. Sciosophy furnishes those
things," said Dr. Jordan in his lecture
on "Science and Sciosophy" last night
at his home.
According to Dr. Jordan, sciosophy,
or systematized ignorance, does not
undertake any verification of facts. It
is dependent on fancy, imagination, or
intuition. It desires to figure things up
quickly. The faith of sciosophy is put
into the reality of external things.
Sciosophists see things as they are
and do not bother to probe beneath
the surface.
Most of the people in the world are
sciosophists. We see evidences of
sciosophy in the papers. Anyone who
believes in horoscopes and the occult
meanings of the stars is a devotee of
sciosophy. The people who sold rab
bits' feet to credulous miners in the
Klondike gold rush employed scioso
j phy and made more money than the
men who worked claims.
Sciosophy was the basis for the wis
dom of the Middle Ages. Dr. Jordan
; told stories of phantoms and wraiths,
i that have been believed by some peo
ple. Communication with Satan was
a popular theme for these stories but
Dr. Jordan says that sciosophy works
just as well without the devil as with
him.
Belief in sciosophy survives today
in the faith in patent medicines, elec
tron cures, and the witch hazel divin
i ing rod. "The fool-killers are reaping
i a large harvest from the sciosophists,"
concluded Dr. Jordan.
