# STANFORD SOCCER TEAM PLAYS BANK ELEVEN TOMORROW
## Cardinal Forward Line and Halfbacks Improve in San Anselmo Game 
### 
San Anselmo's soccer team dropped
a 5-0 game to the Stanford varsity
yesterday afternoon in a practice
game. The scrimmage came as a good
workout just before the regular league
game with the Bank of Italy team in
the Golden Gate Park stadium at 3
o'clock tomorrow.
Almost two full teams were tried
out in the practice varsity soccer game
with San Anselmo yesterday. During
the first half, the first string men j
scored four goals and the second|
string men tallied another in the lat
ter half.
This game shows results obtained j
by Harry Maloney from the standpoint j
of a better combination among the
forwards and a better understanding j
between the halfbacks.
Line Strengthened
The placing of Miron at outside right
and Bing Moy at outside left has
greatly assisted in holding the forward
line together. These two are more
capable of centering the ball than any
others tried in these positions before,
although Hoover, Cardoza, and Quigley
are pressing hard for a place.
Lew Forrest, at goal guard, showed
much improvement over previous
games. He gets rid of the ball quicker
and is learning to place his kicks.
Don and Dave Clark are playing a
steady game as fullbacks and are
showing up better while Captain Ralph
Howe continues to hold the halfbacks
together. Ta'am is the pivot of the
forward line.
The varsity will leave Palo Alto to
morrow at 11:30. This game with the
Bank of Italy will be the last real trial
before the game with California, sche
duled on this campus next Tuesday,
Armistice Day.
The freshmen have a game sche
duled for tomorrow with Half Moon
Bay. They have had very few games
and this one will be their last oppor
tunity before the game with Cali
fornia next Tuesday, the same time as
the varsity game.
The line-ups for tomorrow will be:

line together. These two are more
capable of centering the ball than any
others tried in these positions before,
although Hoover, Cardoza, and Quigley
are pressing hard for a place.
Lew Forrest, at goal guard, showed
much improvement over previous
games. He gets rid of the ball quicker
and is learning to place his kicks.
Don and Dave Clark are playing a
steady game as fullbacks and are
showing up better while Captain Ralph
Howe continues to hold the halfbacks
together. Ta'am is the pivot of the
forward line.
The varsity will leave Palo Alto to
morrow at 11:30. This game with the
Bank of Italy will be the last real trial
before the game with California, sche
duled on this campus next Tuesday,
Armistice Day.
The freshmen have a game sche
duled for tomorrow with Half Moon
Bay. They have had very few games
and this one will be their last oppor
tunity before the game with Cali
fornia next Tuesday, the same time as
the varsity game.
The line-ups for tomorrow will be:
Varsity— Freshmen —
Forrest G Miles
Don Clark RFB McGuire
Dave Clark LFB Glade
Bushnell RHB Hartmann
Howe (c) CFB Stollery
Franklin LHB Dawson
Miron OR McCarty
Bailard IR Strowgei

San Anselmo's soccer team dropped
a 5-0 game to the Stanford varsity
yesterday afternoon in a practice
game. The scrimmage came as a good
workout just before the regular league
game with the Bank of Italy team in
the Golden Gate Park stadium at 3
o'clock tomorrow.
Almost two full teams were tried
out in the practice varsity soccer game
with San Anselmo yesterday. During
the first half, the first string men j
scored four goals and the second|
string men tallied another in the lat
ter half.
This game shows results obtained j
by Harry Maloney from the standpoint j
of a better combination among the
forwards and a better understanding j
between the halfbacks.
Line Strengthened
The placing of Miron at outside right
and Bing Moy at outside left has
greatly assisted in holding the forward
line together. These two are more
capable of centering the ball than any
others tried in these positions before,
although Hoover, Cardoza, and Quigley
are pressing hard for a place.
Lew Forrest, at goal guard, showed
much improvement over previous
