Tomorrow afternoon, the class of 1928 gets its chanec athletically. Pre
liminary games are nice as amusement for the student body, as training
for the team, and as physical and moral development, but the real crisis is,
of course, the "Little Big Game" with California.
The problems of a freshman team, and incidentally of the freshman
coach, are much more difficult than those of varsity connections. The
yearlings have no nucleus of veterans already familiar with methods and
fundamentals, nor have they two or three years in which to absorb them.
A freshman coach sees most of his material for the first time when the
men appear for the first day's practice, and the crux of the season is little
more than a month in the future.
In that short time, then, the coach must teach his men his own man
nerisms of football, and drill out of them their high-school habits. If he
does not succeed in doing that, his team will be ragged and more or less
in the nature of a poorly-directed movie mob.
Stanford is particularly unfortunate in that the late registration fails to
bring ou a large proportion of the season's babe team until other Confer
ence universities are pretty well grounded. And nevertheless Stanford
turns out creditable freshman teams. Credit for this goes largely to the
freshmen who make up the teams, and largely also to "Husky" Hunt, who
makes the teams make themselves up.
However, as we were about to say when interrupted—California is
your proper dish, Babes—we hope you have dinner and dessert.
