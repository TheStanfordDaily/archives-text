# Stanford Spirit
## 
### 
In years past, Stanford has been famous for her fighting spirit—
teams, faculty, students, alumni, and anybody else connected with the
University in any capacity. Today the teams still have that same old fight,
but it is becoming more and more apparent that the student body turns
languidly out to watch the games, and then goes eagerly back to the bridge
table.
Cardinal football teams inspire just as much between-game discussion
and speculation as do the Giants or the Yanks during the big series, but
when it comes down to an actual, physical demonstration of encourage
ment and support, it draws about as much of a crowd as an extemporaneous
dog-fight. Everybody, of course, is anxious for the Cards to win their
games, and most of us even go so far as to attend them. But a rally, to
bolster up the determination of the team and prove that "somebody cares"
is attended by a measly handful, while the rest of Stanford sits around
at home and discusses the shortcomings of the yell-leader.
Yell-leaders are meant to direct the enthusiasm—not to create it.
There is, of course, the factor of success or failure in bringing out the best
assortment of noise, but if the enthusiasm of the mob was as it should be
the yell-leader would not have to do most of the yelling himself. Passing
the buck to him on this proposition of failing spirit merely indicates a de
sire to pass it to somebody—anybody—with the thought "That lets me
out" and the immediate slump into blissful laziness and a critical attitude.
The team is a Stanford team made up of Stanford men, on the field
or off. And when the old uproarious exhuberant type of rooter is so glar
ingly absent as he is this year, the student body as a whole can only blame
ite individual members.

CALIFORNIA is showing splendid spirit in welcoming Stanford and
Utah to her stadium tomorrow. Students and team will become familiar
with the scene of the anticipated event of November 22.
