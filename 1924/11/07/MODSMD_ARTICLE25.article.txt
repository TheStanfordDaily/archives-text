It has been brought to my attention
that there is a great deal of conversa
j tional waste in the friviious chit-chat
which is carried on between Stanford
j men and women. Being one of the big
men on the campus, I shall explain
the method by which I attained my
success.
I always make my conversation in
structive, and formulate my talk be
fore I visit the young lady. I pick an
interesting subject to talk upon such
as: Why the formation of white pre
cipiate with N H 4 OH is no conclu
sive proof of the presence of Bi in the
conformation test. I have found it ad
visable to have a few notes handy.
The girl I call on likewise talks on
sensible topics.
Ever and again I take a jotting of
a merry quip.
I have found the following chat to
be very successful:
"Isabella, I have something to ask
you. Do you know that the Tower of
Alberia is 775 feet high; is made of
solid granite; and sways nine feet at
the top? It was built in 1433 by the
Araogonlans."
"Oh, Elmer," she coos, "the Hell you
say."
She probably comes back with:
Elmer, I have been keeping some
thing from you. I wonder if you realize
that King James I of England in 1616
believed that he was ordained for the
people and not they for him, for it
was his soul which was answerable to
the Almighty for the common weal."
"Well, well, well, Isabella," I reply
as I scribble the information down in
my notebook. "I'll be damned."
By this method all manner of useful
information may be acquired. It would
astound you to hear some of the
things I have discovered in practical
astronomy discussion. Oh, it would
astound you!
