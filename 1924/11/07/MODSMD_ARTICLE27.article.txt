I wish I were a big giraffe and lived
In branches of a Eucalyptus Tree;
But hang it all, I've got to stay an ant
And live on chunks of nasty dry hard
wood.
I wish I were a hippopotamus
To swim the broad Euphrates and eat
grass;
But oh, I can't, 'cause I'm a katydid,
And have to fiddle with my left hind
leg.
Yes, cruel fate, I'm just a grasshopper,
And play the 'cello with my left rear
limb!
—MME. D'ARMENTIERS.
