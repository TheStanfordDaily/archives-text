# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT

The Editor—Sir:
The battle must be fought. Our
coaches have given Stanford the b°st
team in the West, but without the or
ganized support of a large rooting
section, we cannot hope to win the Big
Game. The infantry has plainly shown
rebellion and an unwillingness to fol
low the leadership of General Mc-
Allister.
Under these circumstances, there
are but two things left to do:
1. Lose the game, and with it, the
respect of Stanford people for our
rooting section, and a so-called "Stan
ford Spirit," or, 2. Request the resig
nation of McAllister in favor of any
one of several other able candidates
who can organize and lead the rooting
section and get that expression of
Stanford Spirit that is absolutely ne
cessary for victory. A SENIOR.
