The man who thought of the motto:
"TROUBLE AHEAD TROJANS" had

Stanford is planning to be heavily
represented in the rugby team which
will be sent to Vancouver this winrer.
It seems a pity that rugby Bhould be
crowded from the list of University
sports, completely forgotten on the
schedules, when once it held the lime
light.
Whether anyone believes it or not,
Minor Sports at Stanford hold a high
regard in the eyes of the sporting pub
lic. They are too likely to be slipped
haphazardly in the minds of Stanford
students between one major sport and
another.
But nevertheless the swimming team
continues to beat the spots off the
"Bear; the soccer team keeps consist
ently in the running; the fencing team
wins the Pacific Coast championship,
and even the handball team puts Stan
ford on the map.
First knickers struck the campus
and now golf threatens to become a
very much recognized sport.
The Stanford campus consists of
some thousand acres. Enough, surely,
to slip in a well-constructed golf
course.
California will have to fight to beat
Washington. The Huskies have suf
fered with all the rest <jf the Coast
from defeats at the hands of California
wonder teams. Somehow the money
seems best placed on the side of Cali
fornia luck.

A perfect man is wanted to pose
for a statue which is to be erected on
the University of Southern California
campus within the next three weeks.
The statue will stand as the symbol
ism of Trojan spirit.
