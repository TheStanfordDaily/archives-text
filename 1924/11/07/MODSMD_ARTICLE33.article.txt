# CALIFORNIA BABES READY FOR CARD ELEVEN TOMORROW
## 
### Jerry Levin 
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA,
Nov. 7. â€”Fit and ready for the fray,
the California freshman football team
will meet the Stanford yearlings in
the "Little Big Game" of the season,
Saturday afternoon in the Cardinal
stadium at Palo Alto.
Both institutions have developed ex
ceptional freshman teams this year
and the contest is sure to be a bitter
one from the start to the finish. Al
though defeated by U. S. C. babes by
a score of 10 to 0, the Cardinals have
been drilling hard for the past few
weeks and are confident that they will
give Coach Sprott's team a battle.
The 7 to 0 victory over the Trojan
babes last Saturday has instilled the
necessary confidence in the Bear Cubs
and they will enter the field Saturday
with the will to defeat Coach Hunt's
Cardinals. Not only have they the ne
cessary confidence, but also the ma
terial to turn the trick. With Brick
Marcus and Perrin at halves, Evans
at quarter, and Bradley playing full
back, it is doubtful whether the Cardi
nal backfield composed or I,Ullage at
fullback, Altaffer and Dorcy at halves,
and Murphy at quarter, can compare to
it. Although "Brick" Marcus has had
hard luck so far this season on ac
count of his injured leg, he is expected
to get into the fray. He is probably
one of the best freshman backfield
men on the coast, excelling in running
back punts and in open field work.
With Perrin doing the line-plunging,
the Cardinals' line will find the Bruins
hard to stop.
The lines of the two teams are
about equal, Stanford having the pos
sible edge in the center of the line
but not in the end positions. Stanley,
Towne, and Bancroft, Coach Sprotts'
ends, outclass the Stanford ends, Den
nis and Vincenti, in their defense work.
From tackle to tackle the Stanford
gridders look good. Robesky, of
Bakersfield, a strong man in the tackle
position, has been elected captain of
Coach Hunt's team. It is noticeable
that the California team has also
elected a tackle as their leader in the
person of Fred Cottrin of Chicago.
It will be a case of captain against
captain when the traditional rivals
meet in the Palo Alto stadium.
