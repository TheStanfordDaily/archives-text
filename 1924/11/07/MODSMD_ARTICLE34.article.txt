# WEYMOUTH DELIVERS LECTURE ON ALASKA TO ZOOLOGY CLUB
## 
### 
Professor F. W. Weymouth of the
Physiology department discussed the
razor clam supply in Alaska at a meet
ing of the Zoology club held at Profes
sor J. O. Snyder's home.

"I was disappointed in the country,"
said Professor Weymouth, "as I ex
pected the sort of Alaska that we
read about in books. The Indians have
been in contact with white people for
a longer period than those of Cali
fornia, and there isn't a town in
the country larger than Palo Alto." He
gave a short sketch of Alaska's history
and described the physical character

of the country.
According to Professor Weymouth,
the razor clam is found along the coast
from Alaska to San Diego only in pure
sand beaches. The oldest clam that the
party found in Alaska was seventeen
years old. In California the growth is
more rapid, but in the northern re
gion the length of life is longer,
i As there is less known about the

I clam in Alaska than in Washington
' investigations as to its habits and rate
of increase are being carried on by
: the U. S. Bureau of Fisheries.

The University of Ohio has a new
football rooting section called the
"Frosh 1,000." This section, made up
of Frosh only, gives all the welcome
j yells, and all the new yells.
