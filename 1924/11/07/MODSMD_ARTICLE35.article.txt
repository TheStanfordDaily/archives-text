# FIRST BAWL-OUTS MAKE APPEARANCE ON CAMPUS, 1899
## 
### 
The Bawl-out, official students' di
rectory, dates back to 1899, when it
first appeared in an abbreviated form
Imt was nevertheless the unmistakable
parent of the Bawl-out today. Not till
the first semester of 1901-1902 were
hours and grade points included. The
scholarship records seem to have been
about. the same as they are today.
Bound volumes are kept in the Regis
trar's office, by means of which one
may ascertain whether father really
lias something to talk about when he
says you don't appreciate a college
education as he did.
Since then the Bawl-out has grown,
l>oth in the number of students' names
and the material included. Today it
gives the heads of all students' or
ganizations, the faculty and University
officers and trustees, the students with
their home addresses and campus ad
dresses, postboxes, hours and points,
names of scholarship holders, and
sundry information from fire alarms
to holidays. It takes the Registrar's
office four weeks to get it out.
Probably owing to the number of
new students unacquainted with the
Bawl-out, only eight hundred copies
liave been sold to date. It is obtainable
sit the Accountants' office upstairs in
the Administration building for 15
cents.
