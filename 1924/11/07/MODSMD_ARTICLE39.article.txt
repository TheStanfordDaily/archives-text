# Batchelder Orchestra Will Provide Harmony At Sophomore Cotillion
## 
### 
Jimmy Batclielder and his eleven
follow musicians have been engaged
to play at the Sophomore Cotillion on
December 5.
These twelve dispensers of melodi
ous strains, all students at the Uni
versity of California, rate as one of
the best orchestras on that campus.
; Such fellows as Roland Oldis, banjo;
Jud Chase and Milt Heuter, saxa
phone; and Ken Dogan on the drums
are playing in the combination.
In order that the music may have a
better tone and will carry better, a
special platform will be built in front
t>f the present bandstand in the pa
vilion. They will be arranged so that
i they will be above the dancers.
