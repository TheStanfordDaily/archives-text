# Two Choral Preludes On Recital Program
## 
### 
Bach's "Adorn Thyself, Beloved
Soul," and "In Thee Is Joy" will be in
cluded in the organ recital, by Warren
D. Allen, University organist, at 4
o'clock Sunday afternoon.
In these two choral-preludes we find
first an example of the mystic, spiritu
al beauty of the music in which Bach
expressed his religious affections, and
in the second a brilliant and happy
expression of religious ecstacy.
The symphonic poem, "My Country,"
by Smetana, has been called the "no
blest monument of the great Bohe
mian Reformation" by Clarence Dick
inson, in his "Excursions in Musical
History."
The principal theme is that of the
Hussite battle hymn, the "flail song,
warriors who for God are fighting."
The first movement is called "Tabor,"
after Ziska's armed camp on the top
of Mt. Tabor, which gave its name to
a whole section of Hussite believers,
the Taborites.
"Chorale from the Second Sym
phony" was written by Louis Vierne,
the blind organist of Notre Dame
Cathedral, Paris. He reminds one of
Cesar Franck in the lofty spirit of his
musical conceptions.
Edward Shippen Barnes, of New
York, wrote "Canzona" (from the
"Seven Sketches"). He is in the front
rank of American composers, and has
written two "symphonies" and many
smaller works for the organ.

High school basketball coaches and
players are now studying the game
by mail through the University of
Wisconsin extension courses.
