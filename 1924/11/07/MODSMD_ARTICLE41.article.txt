# TRAINER DENNY CONCEDES EVEN BREAK WITH BEARS
## 
### Wallace Denny 
(Varsity Trainer)
Some D. P. A. reporter has been
pestering me about my opinion re
garding the Stanford-California game
and this is the way I have doped it
out.
For several reasons, I think Stan
ford has a fifty-fifty chance to win the
Big Game this fall. The team has a
better knowledge of their plays than
heretofore. The men are in fine physi
cal condition. The substitutes are
good. The whole squad has confidence
in their coaches. Ernie Nevers will be

going just about right in two weeks.
In the two years I have been with
the team as trainer, I have noticed
that the men before the California
game were nervous and over-anxious.
I predict it will not be that way this
year.
In the several years I have worked
with Mr. Warner, I have seen him
turn out winning teams from very
poor material. My big reason there
fore for believing Stanford will beat
California this fall, is "Pop" Warner.
He has splendid material here from
which to make a winning team.
