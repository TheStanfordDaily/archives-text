# BROWN LECTURES TO PALO ALTO CLUB ON VALUE OF ADVERTISING
## 
### 
"Vision, sincerity, and common
sense are the three principal qualities
necessary to advertising," said Profes
sor Buford O. Brown last night at a
meeting of the Stanford-Palo Alto Ad
vertising Club.
Saying that it is the article adver
tised and not the advertisement to
ward which the attention of the public
is directed, Brown pointed out that
self-abasement was the ideal of the
copy-writer.
"Advertising is not only salesman
ship but it is also literature in that it
must be of sufficient worth and inter
est to get itself read in competition
with other forms of literature. An ad
vertisement must give correct infor
mation to the public and is therefore
of educational value."
This lecture was the first of a series
of ten to be given by Professor Brown
before the Stanford-Palo Alto Adver
tising Club.
