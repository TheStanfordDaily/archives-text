# STANFORD ELEVEN CRUSHES CRIMSON TO TUNE OF 30-0
## Nevers Makes Repeated Gains Against Utah in First 1924 Appearance

With Ernie Nevers crashing through
the Utah line time after time for five

Mormons by a 30 to 0 count in the
California Memorial stadium last Sat

Cleaveland had to punt only four
times.
Cuddeback had lots of practice
place-kicking. He tried them from
under the bar, from difficult angles,
and even from the 40-yard line. He

a chance hitting the line on the fourth
down instead of kicking it is very
