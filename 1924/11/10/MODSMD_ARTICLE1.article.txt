# STANFORD ELEVEN CRUSHES CRIMSON TO TUNE OF 30-0
## Nevers Makes Repeated Gains Against Utah in First 1924 Appearance 
### Wallace Knox 
With Ernie Nevers crashing through
the Utah line time after time for five
and six yard gains, the Stanford var
sity had little trouble in downing the
Mormons by a 30 to 0 count in the
California Memorial stadium last Sat
urday* «
Nevers proved to the skeptical that
he is still in the running for Ail-
American honors this year. He was
playing his first game of the season,
but after he got warmed up he carried
the ball on an average of three out of
■five downs and was never stopped
until he had penetrated the Crimson
line for a gain of several yards. Ernie
tumbled five times —but that can be
excused since he has not been playing
for a month, Nevers was used for
three quarters, when "Pop" Warner
decided to give him a rest and sent
Cliff Hey into the fray.
Goal Never in Danger
Utah managed to hold the Cards to
one touchdown until the fourth quar
ter, but the Stanford team was never
in any danger of being scored upon.
Utah was never nearer to the goal
than the 45-yard line.
Throughout the contest it seemed as
if Stanford was just having a good
workout, rather than playing an inter
sectional contest. After every Ute punt
the varsity marched down the field
with the ball until it was either within
place-kicking distance or else a fum
ble stopped progress. Warner's eleven
registered t\£enty-one first downs, and
allowed the Utahans to make their
yardage on but three occasions.
Cleaveland had to punt only four
times.
Cuddeback had lots of practice
place-kicking. He tried them from
under the bar, from difficult angles,
and even from the 40-yard line. He
was lucky on but one of them, how
ever. Had the varsity chosen to take
a chance hitting the line on the fourth
down instead of kicking it is very
probable that two more touchdowns
would have been chalked up.
Eleven Works Well
The Stanford team looked like a
well-oiled machine Saturday. True, it
wasn't playing spectacular | football,
but there was nothing to make the
varsity open up. The interference run
ning was beautiful, and Cleaveland
and Cuddeback were invariably en
abled to get away for gains of from
five to fifteen yards.
Captain Jim Lawson and Ted Ship
key looked like all-conference ends
Saturday. Utah's end runners couldn't
get by either of them and so Coach
Fitzpatrick took out his fast backs
after ten minutes and put in his
heavier backfields. These men fared
even worse than the men they re
placed, for the Stanford line was prac
tically impregnable.
Shipkey was on the receiving end
of two passes, going over the line
for a score on one of them. Lawson
snagged one, and would have scored,
but he slipped on the wet turf and
was stopped five yards from the goal.
First Period Scoreless
The first quarter ended with Stan
ford's first down on Utah's 14-yard
line. Three plays took the pigskin to
the 8-yard line and Cuddeback
tried a kick. It went wide and Utah
punted after failing to gain. Mitchell
received the kick on the 45-yard line
and Nevers made first down on a de
layed buck and a plunge over right
guard. It was at this stage of the
game when Ted Shipkey received a
pass from Nevers and raced 28 yards
to the goal line. Cuddeback failed to
convert.
The half ended with Stanford lead
ing 6 to 0.
Stanford was driving toward the
goal steadily in the third period, and
the gun found the ball on the 11-yard
line. Hey had taken Nevers' place and
gained eight yards in three plays. Cud
deback kicked from the nine-yard line.
This was the signal for the Utah
breakdown and during the rest of the
game Utah was too dazed to know
what was happening. Three touch
downs came in rapid succession be
fore the time limit.
Lawson Gets Pass
After an exchange of punts Hey and
Cleaveland worked the ball to the 24-
yard line. Cleaveland tossed a pass to
Lawson, who made 16 yards before
he slipped and was downed. Hey made
the remaining yardage in two line
plunges. Cuddeback converted.
With the score 16 to 0, Warner sent
in a string of substitutes. Hey inter
cepted a Utah pass and, with the aid
of Walker, worked the ball to the Utah
14-yard line. Mitchell found himself
on the receiving end of a Stanford
pass and madfe the next score. Cudde
back converted.
Utah opened up a passing game, but
couldn't complete anything, and punt
ed. Stanford returned the punt and
Ted Shipkey got down the field ahead
of the Utah safety man and succeeded
in grounding the ball on the three
yard line. Howells fumbled behind the
Koal line and Flood broke through and
fell on the hall for the final score.

Dwight made the try for point.

place-kicking distance or else a fum
ble stopped progress. Warner's eleven
registered t\£enty-one first downs, and
allowed the Utahans to make their
yardage on but three occasions.
Cleaveland had to punt only four
times.
Cuddeback had lots of practice
place-kicking. He tried them from
under the bar, from difficult angles,
and even from the 40-yard line. He
was lucky on but one of them, how
ever. Had the varsity chosen to take
a chance hitting the line on the fourth
down instead of kicking it is very
probable that two more touchdowns
would have been chalked up.
Eleven Works Well
The Stanford team looked like a
well-oiled machine Saturday. True, it
wasn't playing spectacular | football,
but there was nothing to make the
varsity open up. The interference run
ning was beautiful, and Cleaveland
and Cuddeback were invariably en
abled to get away for gains of from
five to fifteen yards.
Captain Jim Lawson and Ted Ship
key looked like all-conference ends
Saturday. Utah's end runners couldn't
get by either of them and so Coach
Fitzpatrick took out his fast backs
after ten minutes and put in his
heavier backfields. These men fared
even worse than the men they re
placed, for the Stanford line was prac
tically impregnable.
Shipkey was on the receiving end
of two passes, going over the line
for a score on one of them. Lawson
snagged one, and would have scored,
but he slipped on the wet turf and
was stopped five yards from the goal.
First Period Scoreless
The first quarter ended with Stan
ford's first down on Utah's 14-yard
line. Three plays took the pigskin to
the 8-yard line and Cuddeback
tried a kick. It went wide and Utah
punted after failing to gain. Mitchell
received the kick on the 45-yard line
and Nevers made first down on a de
layed buck and a plunge over right
guard. It was at this stage of the
game when Ted Shipkey received a
pass from Nevers and raced 28 yards
to the goal line. Cuddeback failed to
convert.
The half ended with Stanford lead
ing 6 to 0.
Stanford was driving toward the
goal steadily in the third period, and
the gun found the ball on the 11-yard
line. Hey had taken Nevers' place and
gained eight yards in three plays. Cud
deback kicked from the nine-yard line.
This was the signal for the Utah
breakdown and during the rest of the
game Utah was too dazed to know
what was happening. Three touch
downs came in rapid succession be
fore the time limit.
Lawson Gets Pass
After an exchange of punts Hey and
Cleaveland worked the ball to the 24-
yard line. Cleaveland tossed a pass to
Lawson, who made 16 yards before
he slipped and was downed. Hey made
the remaining yardage in two line
plunges. Cuddeback converted.
With the score 16 to 0, Warner sent
in a string of substitutes. Hey inter
cepted a Utah pass and, with the aid
of Walker, worked the ball to the Utah
14-yard line. Mitchell found himself
on the receiving end of a Stanford
pass and madfe the next score. Cudde
back converted.
Utah opened up a passing game, but
couldn't complete anything, and punt
ed. Stanford returned the punt and
Ted Shipkey got down the field ahead
of the Utah safety man and succeeded
in grounding the ball on the three
yard line. Howells fumbled behind the
Koal line and Flood broke through and
fell on the hall for the final score.

Dwight made the try for point.

Nevers proved to the skeptical that
he is still in the running for Ail-

playing his first game of the season,
but after he got warmed up he carried
the ball on an average of three out of
■five downs and was never stopped
until he had penetrated the Crimson
line for a gain of several yards. Ernie
tumbled five times —but that can be

of two passes, going over the line
for a score on one of them. Lawson
snagged one, and would have scored,
but he slipped on the wet turf and
was stopped five yards from the goal.
First Period Scoreless
The first quarter ended with Stan
ford's first down on Utah's 14-yard
line. Three plays took the pigskin to
the 8-yard line and Cuddeback
tried a kick. It went wide and Utah
punted after failing to gain. Mitchell
received the kick on the 45-yard line
and Nevers made first down on a de
layed buck and a plunge over right
guard. It was at this stage of the
game when Ted Shipkey received a
pass from Nevers and raced 28 yards
to the goal line. Cuddeback failed to
convert.
The half ended with Stanford lead
ing 6 to 0.
Stanford was driving toward the
goal steadily in the third period, and
the gun found the ball on the 11-yard
line. Hey had taken Nevers' place and
gained eight yards in three plays. Cud
deback kicked from the nine-yard line.
This was the signal for the Utah
breakdown and during the rest of the
game Utah was too dazed to know
what was happening. Three touch
downs came in rapid succession be
fore the time limit.
Lawson Gets Pass
After an exchange of punts Hey and
Cleaveland worked the ball to the 24-
yard line. Cleaveland tossed a pass to
Lawson, who made 16 yards before
he slipped and was downed. Hey made
the remaining yardage in two line
plunges. Cuddeback converted.
With the score 16 to 0, Warner sent
in a string of substitutes. Hey inter
cepted a Utah pass and, with the aid
of Walker, worked the ball to the Utah
14-yard line. Mitchell found himself
on the receiving end of a Stanford
pass and madfe the next score. Cudde
back converted.
Utah opened up a passing game, but
couldn't complete anything, and punt
ed. Stanford returned the punt and
Ted Shipkey got down the field ahead
of the Utah safety man and succeeded
in grounding the ball on the three
yard line. Howells fumbled behind the
Koal line and Flood broke through and
fell on the hall for the final score.

Dwight made the try for point.

With Ernie Nevers crashing through
the Utah line time after time for five
and six yard gains, the Stanford var
sity had little trouble in downing the
Mormons by a 30 to 0 count in the
California Memorial stadium last Sat
urday* «
Nevers proved to the skeptical that
he is still in the running for Ail-
American honors this year. He was
playing his first game of the season,
but after he got warmed up he carried
the ball on an average of three out of
■five downs and was never stopped
until he had penetrated the Crimson
line for a gain of several yards. Ernie
tumbled five times —but that can be
excused since he has not been playing
for a month, Nevers was used for
three quarters, when "Pop" Warner
decided to give him a rest and sent
Cliff Hey into the fray.
Goal Never in Danger
Utah managed to hold the Cards to
one touchdown until the fourth quar
ter, but the Stanford team was never
in any danger of being scored upon.
Utah was never nearer to the goal
than the 45-yard line.
Throughout the contest it seemed as
if Stanford was just having a good
workout, rather than playing an inter
sectional contest. After every Ute punt
the varsity marched down the field
with the ball until it was either within
place-kicking distance or else a fum
ble stopped progress. Warner's eleven
registered t\£enty-one first downs, and
allowed the Utahans to make their
yardage on but three occasions.
Cleaveland had to punt only four
times.
Cuddeback had lots of practice
place-kicking. He tried them from
under the bar, from difficult angles,
and even from the 40-yard line. He
was lucky on but one of them, how
ever. Had the varsity chosen to take
a chance hitting the line on the fourth
down instead of kicking it is very
probable that two more touchdowns
would have been chalked up.
Eleven Works Well
The Stanford team looked like a
well-oiled machine Saturday. True, it
wasn't playing spectacular | football,
but there was nothing to make the
varsity open up. The interference run
ning was beautiful, and Cleaveland
and Cuddeback were invariably en
abled to get away for gains of from
five to fifteen yards.
Captain Jim Lawson and Ted Ship
key looked like all-conference ends
Saturday. Utah's end runners couldn't
get by either of them and so Coach
Fitzpatrick took out his fast backs
after ten minutes and put in his
heavier backfields. These men fared
even worse than the men they re
placed, for the Stanford line was prac
tically impregnable.
