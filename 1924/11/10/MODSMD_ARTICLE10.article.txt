# STANFORD AND ILLINOIS GAME RUMOR UNFOUNDED
## 
### 
Rumors prevalent 011 the campus
today that Stanford and the University
of Illinois have entered into negotia
tions for a post-season football game
are entirely unfounded, Dr. W. H.
1 Barrow, director of athletics, declared
this morning.
A press dispatch appeared in several
California papers yesterday giving
ground to the rumor, hut Dr. Barrow
explained that the author of this dis
patch acted without authority of either
University, since no official communi
i cation has been exchanged. It is prob
; able some third person is attempting
j to put the possibility of such a game
j before the public.
"It is possible that the Stanford
Hoard of Athletic Control might look
' with favor upon such a game," I)r.
Barrow said this morning.
However, he went on to add that
} the Board had not yet considered such

a contest, and until it meets no one
can even guess as to what the opinion
will be. Stanford does not want to dis
courage any organization which is
working toward such a game, but the
Board will not give approval to such
plans at this time.
Should Illinois and Stanford clash
011 the gridiron it will give northern
i California fans a chance to see the
most prominent individual star in the
country in action. "Red" Grange,
whose phenomenal backfield work has
! made him dreaded by every team in
the Big Ten, is a member of the Illi
nois team, and he would make the trip
to California in the event that a game
is arranged.
Neither Stanford nor Illinois has
considered entering into negotiations
for a game, bnt this does not mean
that an attempt to get a game will not
1 be made. '
