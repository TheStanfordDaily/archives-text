# OXFORD TRY-OUTS NOW ON SCHEDULE FOR DECEMBER 1
## Prohibition to Be Subject of Speaking Contest With Englishmen 
### 
Oxford debate tryouts will take place
on Monday, December 1, according to
the Stanford faculty debating adviser,
J. G. Emerson. Three men are to be 1
chosen in open competition before judges
. who, as far as possible, shall not be per
sonally familiar with any of the try-;
outees. An effort is to be made to cause
the selection on the basis of tryout ap
pearance, rather than on past reputation.
The type of speaking necessary for the
Oxford debate, according to Professor,
Emerson, will be materially different
from that in ordinary intercollegiate con
tests. The English debaters have been !
trained in the school which has as its !
basis the popular appeal. English de- j
bates are never decided by judges. Con- 1
sequently their speaking is more inter-:
esting and less heavy than that of the
average American debater.
Witty Talkers
A letter has been received from Bryan
A. Gilkinson, the coach of debate at the i
University of Kansas, where the Oxford .
men appeared a short time ago. Com
menting on their appearance, he says:
"The Oxonians are easy, informal, fre
quently witty, sometimes ironic, inclined
to philosophical rather than severely logi- j
cal attack. They abhor statistics and
quotations from authority. They are i
masters of epigrammatic statement, and
have a happy way of turning aside a
whole argument which the average Amer
ican debater would regard as impreg
nable, merely by a humorous remark.
"To attempt to meet them in what I
regard as the too formal and heavily log
ical American style is to fall short of ,
| winning the approval of the audience
and to call forth unfavorable comment."
The question for the tryout will be the
same as that for the actual debate in
January: "Resolved, That this house is
opposed to the principles of prohibition."
Stanford is to uphold the negative side
of the question and defend prohibition.
Plans now arc that the tryoutees shall
be allowed seven minutes to constructive
argument and three minutes for formal t
rebuttal.
Professor Emerson has announced that j
all who contemplate appearing in the try
out must communicate with him immedi
ately.

"To attempt to meet them in what I
regard as the too formal and heavily log
ical American style is to fall short of ,
| winning the approval of the audience
and to call forth unfavorable comment."
The question for the tryout will be the
same as that for the actual debate in
January: "Resolved, That this house is
opposed to the principles of prohibition."
Stanford is to uphold the negative side
of the question and defend prohibition.
Plans now arc that the tryoutees shall
be allowed seven minutes to constructive
argument and three minutes for formal t
rebuttal.
Professor Emerson has announced that j
all who contemplate appearing in the try
out must communicate with him immedi
ately.
Oxford debate tryouts will take place
on Monday, December 1, according to
the Stanford faculty debating adviser,
J. G. Emerson. Three men are to be 1
chosen in open competition before judges
. who, as far as possible, shall not be per
sonally familiar with any of the try-;
outees. An effort is to be made to cause
the selection on the basis of tryout ap
pearance, rather than on past reputation.
The type of speaking necessary for the
Oxford debate, according to Professor,
Emerson, will be materially different
from that in ordinary intercollegiate con
tests. The English debaters have been !
trained in the school which has as its !
basis the popular appeal. English de- j
bates are never decided by judges. Con- 1
sequently their speaking is more inter-:
esting and less heavy than that of the
average American debater.
Witty Talkers
A letter has been received from Bryan
A. Gilkinson, the coach of debate at the i
University of Kansas, where the Oxford .
men appeared a short time ago. Com
menting on their appearance, he says:
"The Oxonians are easy, informal, fre
quently witty, sometimes ironic, inclined
to philosophical rather than severely logi- j
cal attack. They abhor statistics and
quotations from authority. They are i
masters of epigrammatic statement, and
have a happy way of turning aside a
whole argument which the average Amer
ican debater would regard as impreg
nable, merely by a humorous remark.
