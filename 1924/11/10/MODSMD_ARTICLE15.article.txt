# TICKET SALE FOR R.U.R. BEGINS AT 1 P.M. TOMORROW
## New System Is Expected to Facilitate Selling and Eliminate Delay 
### 
The ticket sale for "R. U. R." will
be held in the administration building
tomorrow at 1 o'clock. A new system
will be put in effect which will not
only facilitate the sale, but will be as
fair as the old system of drawing.
Stanford's production of "R. U. R."
has created a great deal of comment
on the peninsula, and a record crowd
of out-of-town people is expected. "R.
U. R." is the first real melodrama that
has been presented at Stanford for
several years, and it is a play which
has earned the praises of almost every
competent dramatic critic iu the Uni
ted States who has seen it. Such critics
as George Jean Nathan are outspoken
in thejr commendations of the play,
Nathan's comment being to the effect
that "It will tickle your spine from
your head to your toes. Don't miss it."
Touch of Satire
"R. U. R." differs from most melo
dramas in that it has a touch of satire
throughout which is extremely well
done. The modern world is prone to
glorify the efficient mechanical per
fection of soulless beings who mas
querade as humans, and Karel Capek,
the author, has enlarged on this theme.
His portrayal of mechanical men who
are manufactured by the thousand to
fight the wars and do the manual la
bor of the humans on earth, and how
these workers, or "robots" as they are
called finally overcome and destroy
all the humans on earth except the
scant half-dozen who are living in the
factory where the robots are made, is
one of the most thrilling pieces of
dramatic effort ever staged. The scene
where these robots silently surround
the factory, and slowly close in on the
last remaining humans is a gripping
moment that will send shivers of dread
and apprehension up and down the
spines of the audience.
The startling denoument of the play
is as unexpected as it is melodramatic,
and is the final touch of satire with
which the whole production is per
meated.
