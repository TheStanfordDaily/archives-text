# A 						Fair Offer

### 
The Board of Athletic Control is a representative organization of the
three Stanford groups—students, faculty, and alumni. It is so consti
tuted in order that decisions regarding, and administration of, Stanford
athletic affairs may he untinged with partisanship or narrowness of affilia
tions. In the case of the student representation, especially, great care is
taken to make sure that it is adequate and thorough. The president of the
Associated Students is an ex-officio member, and the other two student
representatives are elected by and from the student body.
Cancellation of the U. S. C. athletic relationships has brought forth a
large amount of comment, both inside and out of the University. This
comment was crystallized by Mr. Collins in his "Viewpoint" last Wednes
day evening, and perhaps a wrong impression was taken by many. Clearly
the attitude of the students is curiosity—emphatically not censure, but a
desire to know why their chosen representatives acted as they did. and why
their actions have not been more fully outlined. A number of "View
points" on the subject have come to the Daily, and all have settled on
this one point—have, or have not, the students a right to know what it is
all about?
Realizing and admitting the justice of this point, the student repre
sentatives on the Board of Athletic Control have made a fair offer, which
should be accepted by any student who feels himself to be insufficiently
informed on the subject. The Daily feels that the cancellation was the
only course open, that the Board of Athletic Control has acted wisely and
loyally throughout, and that it is needful only to enlighten those students
who still withhold their entire support. The following invitation should
be taken at its face value, and any student who still retains any doubt
should regard it as an opportunity to set himself right on the matter.
This is the offer :
The Editor:
Since a member of the Student Body has questioned the action of the
Board of Athletic Control in regard to U. S. C., we, the student members
of that Board, elected by the Student Body, make the following reply:
We feel that the athletic policy of U. S. C., which has been evidenced
by her conduct, is not in keeping with the standards which Stanford en
deavors to maintain. In taking such a drastic and much criticized stand to
keep intercollegiate athletics clean and sportsmanlike, we desire the under
standing support of our Student Body. To arrive at that understanding,
we invite the students, our electors, to approach us personally for informa
tion rather than through the press—and they will find us only too glad to
give them detailed reasons for this action we have taken in their behalf.
