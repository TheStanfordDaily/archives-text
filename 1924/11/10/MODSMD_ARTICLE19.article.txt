# "Husky" and Huskies
## 
### 
For the second consecutive year it has been done. Last Saturday
Coach "Husky" Hunt sent a new and strange babe football eleven on
the field, after fiddling around with it in an experimental way throughout
the season, and clearly earned a game over the young Bruin to which
he had previously been conceded no shadow of a title. And last year, it
may be recalled, he did the same thing.
Though early and mid-season games make very nice scalps for the
Cardinal, it is the chief glory of a freshman eleven, even more than the
varsity, to beat California. And for a Stanford team to rise out of the
muck of short-end odds and take the cake with such definite superiority
is just another repetition of thta old, old Stanford characteristic. It has
always been an outsatnding trai of he Red, and with the efforts of Coach
Jlun and others of his type it will be for time indefinite.
The babes have concluded an entirely successful season. They lost
one game which didn't count for anything, and they tied another which
is nothing in view of the end attained. So long as Hunt and his teams
keep pointing at the Little Big Game—and then winning it, hands down
—there will be no quibbling over the actions of first-year athletes.
Congratulations and best wishes are hereby bestowed upon Coach
Hunt, Captain Robesky, and every member of the squad. There are
still four more major sports to be won—and the first of the minors goes
to bat tomorrow, when the soccerites tackle California.
THERE WERE some magnificent upsets of the dope Saturday. Let's
have Stanford doped to lose on the 22nd, and then let history repeat itself.
HARRY MALONEY sends his varsity and freshman soccer teams
against the Bruin tomorrow. Harry has had to do most of his coaching;
by cable from Australia and way points, so for the time being his teams j
will especially benefit by a large rooting-section.
HATFIELD, the Rain-Maker, was a year early. He could have made
real money this year on same terms.
