SQUIRREL FODDER
Good morning. Come in and make
yourself at home. Act natural.
For those standing in the rear or
sitting behind a post, we will outline
the life and character of one of the
bigger men on our campus. This is
football season. So let me tell you
about Wilmer J. Lorson.
Wilmer was born at night and hails
from Long Beach. Long Beach is in
California. In Long Beach there are
more horseshoes than there are horses.
He is not left-handed and eats with I
either hand. He passes the football
with one of them, the oth<sr being left.
Lorson speaks the English language
fluently, to say nothing of Bantu and
Siberian.
When interviewed last night by the
reporter, Lorson was in the Timothy
Hopkins room looking for a few hot
tips. She didn't show, so he said, "I
credit my success to but thirty things;
to wit and mainly, Nuxated Iron and
Grape Nuts. Contrary to the report of
the New York Times, I, Wilmer Lor
son, was not a Mellin's Food baby. My
strength?
"I once to swim from San
Pedro or San Mateo, I forget which —
some harbor —to Catalina Island, car
rying an anvil, but I gave up six miles
out on account of the cold. I was going
so fast at the time, however, that the
anvil coasted on over to Avalon and
may even now be seen on exhibition
in the Tuna Club of that place.
"I like to play football as I like to
eat," asserted Wilmer " —fast. But I
wish it were again the good old days
when the ends wore chin-whiskers,
centers wore high hats and quarter
backs had handles on their pants.
Those were the days when a light
j quarterback could be thrown over the
line to bury his dome in the mud for a
good gain.
"Hot pepper, pepper, and still more
pepper. P-p-p-pepper!"
—HACK SICKLER.

No, Dulcinda, the "Struggle for
Power in China" has nothing to do
with the laundry situation.

IF WILL HAYS HAD A SON
WOULD IT BE RIGHT FOR HIM TO
CALL HAYS "FODDER."
