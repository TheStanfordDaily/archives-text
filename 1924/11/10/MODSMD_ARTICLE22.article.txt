The Editor —Sir:
H. A. Franck's talk this morning on
China was the most unsympathetic /
and most misleading that I ever heard
from the mouth of one of a people who
have been best known in China for
their good will and their love of truth
and justice. It is unnecessary to point
out the misleading nature of such
general statements as "there are over
a hundred independent generals gov
erning China" and "double-crossing is
very common in China," the worth of
which I any intelligent man
or woman to judge. But in so far as
the able speaker's primary motive
see'med to have been after laughter
rather than after truth, I wish only
here to solicit some more smiles. The j
Chinese were blamed, at one minute,
for cutting off the heads of bandits
and. at another, were ridiculed for not
cutting off the head of the deposed ,
innocent boy-emperor. At the begin
ning, Americans in China were said to
be liable to capture by bandits at any
moment, and towards the end, they
were assured that China was the
safest place for them. I imagine Mr.
Franck did not see any Chinese
among his audience, for otherwise he |
would have referred, by way of illus-!
trating the cowardly nature of the i
Chinese people, to their strange toler- ;
ation of such an oration without stand
ing up and slapping the orator in the j
face. —A CHINESE.
The Editor —Sir:
After all the slurring, unpleasant
criticism "Dutch" McAllister rated
last week, I, for one, wish to con
gratulate him on the splendid way he
conducted the yelling at the frosh
game Saturday. "Dutch" was in a dif
ficult position—he was on trial by the
most critical of judging bodies, a gang
iof excited rooters —and he came
through with the goods in great shape!
The yells were unified, snappy, and
| frequent. The instructions for practic
ing with rooters' hats were given in a
I clear, calm, good-natured manner so
that all could understand and willingly
follow "Dutch's" lead. With that sort
of teamwork between yell leader and
rooters we'll have a section at the Big
Game that'll make the old grads sit up
and take notice! And what's more im
portant, it will give the varsity the
; support necessary to a decisive vic
| tory like that of the frosh Saturday.
Keep up the good work, "Dutch,"
you're doing fine and we'll all be back
: ing you!
Sincerely,
"CHUCK" BEARDSLEY, '25.

for cutting off the heads of bandits
and. at another, were ridiculed for not
cutting off the head of the deposed ,
innocent boy-emperor. At the begin
ning, Americans in China were said to
be liable to capture by bandits at any
moment, and towards the end, they
were assured that China was the
safest place for them. I imagine Mr.
Franck did not see any Chinese
among his audience, for otherwise he |
would have referred, by way of illus-!
trating the cowardly nature of the i
Chinese people, to their strange toler- ;
ation of such an oration without stand
ing up and slapping the orator in the j
face. —A CHINESE.

After all the slurring, unpleasant
criticism "Dutch" McAllister rated
last week, I, for one, wish to con
gratulate him on the splendid way he
conducted the yelling at the frosh
game Saturday. "Dutch" was in a dif
ficult position—he was on trial by the
most critical of judging bodies, a gang
iof excited rooters —and he came
through with the goods in great shape!
The yells were unified, snappy, and
| frequent. The instructions for practic
ing with rooters' hats were given in a
I clear, calm, good-natured manner so
that all could understand and willingly
follow "Dutch's" lead. With that sort
of teamwork between yell leader and
rooters we'll have a section at the Big
Game that'll make the old grads sit up
and take notice! And what's more im
portant, it will give the varsity the
; support necessary to a decisive vic
| tory like that of the frosh Saturday.
Keep up the good work, "Dutch,"
you're doing fine and we'll all be back
: ing you!
Sincerely,
"CHUCK" BEARDSLEY, '25.

H. A. Franck's talk this morning on
China was the most unsympathetic /
and most misleading that I ever heard
from the mouth of one of a people who
have been best known in China for
their good will and their love of truth
and justice. It is unnecessary to point
out the misleading nature of such
general statements as "there are over
a hundred independent generals gov
erning China" and "double-crossing is
very common in China," the worth of
which I any intelligent man
or woman to judge. But in so far as
the able speaker's primary motive
see'med to have been after laughter
rather than after truth, I wish only
here to solicit some more smiles. The j
Chinese were blamed, at one minute,
for cutting off the heads of bandits
and. at another, were ridiculed for not
cutting off the head of the deposed ,
innocent boy-emperor. At the begin
ning, Americans in China were said to
