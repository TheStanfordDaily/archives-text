# VARSITY, YEARLING SOCCERITES TACKLE BRUINS TOMORROW
## 
### 
Accorded an even chance for vic
tory by Coach Harry Maloney, Stan
ford's varsity and freshman soccer
elevens will clash with invading Cali
fornia teams at 3:30 p.m., tomorrow.
The rival varsities will tangle on the
Stanford baseball diamond, while the
freshman encounter will be staged on
the soccer field back of the stadium.
Although the Card regulars were
held to a 2 to 2 tie by an inferior
team from the Bank of Italy Saturday,
they showed themselves the stronger
aggregation at all times. Maloney feels
that his men gained immeasurably by
the tilt. Not only did they receive the
workout which they needed in prder
to put them on edge for the meeting
with the Bears, but they became accus
tomed to working on a muddy field
such as they will have to play on
tomorrow.
No Over-Confidence
Any over-confidence which the Stan
ford players might have felt prior to
their meeting with .the Bankers was
successfully dispelled during that
game. On the previous Saturday they
downed the league-leading Barbarian
eleven which had previously trimmed
the Bears by a substantial score.
Zamloch's men go oil the field to
morrow with a big edge over the Cards
in the matter of practice. They have
been engaged in daily workouts since
the middle of August, while Maloney
has only been at the helm since Octo
ber 25. But they lack the teamwork
which is characteristic of the Stan
ford eleven, even though a number of
individual stars of foreign nationali
ties 'are included in their line-up. Cali
fornia has not made an extra good
showing in the league tilts they have
played to date.
Defense Strong
The Redshirts have built a strong i
defense around Don and Dave Clark, |
and Captain Ralph Howe in the back
field and Forest at goal, and have
developed an increasingly powerful of
fensive with every game. Seven veter
ans of the team which trounced the
Bruins in two out of three contests
last year will be back- in their old j
positions tomorrow.
While the Stanford yearlings have
not shown themselves world-beaters
in any sense of the word thus far, they
have made a steady improvement with
each week. Absolutely green men at
the start of the season, they have de
veloped a degree of teamwork which
will enable them to tackle the Blue
and Gold babes with a good chance of
victory.
