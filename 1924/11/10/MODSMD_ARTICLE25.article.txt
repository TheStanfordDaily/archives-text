# AZTEC POTTERY AND BUDDHIST RELICS IN NEW MUSEUM EXHIBIT
## 
### 
A new exhibition, consisting of Aztcc
pottery, arrowheads, prayer boards, and
old needlework, has been placed on dis
play in the front lobby of the Stanford
Museum.
This exhibit and all other new ac
quisitions will be placed in a glass case
in the center of the lobby. This is a new
feature at the Museum.
Aztec gods and images modeled from
terra cotta and collected from the Oaxaea
region of Mexico, old Mexican coins, and
Oaxaea ware have been loaned the
Museum by Mrs. Benjamin Hake.
Bits of pottery and arrowheads picked
up from the Enchanted Mesa near
Acoma,- New Mexico, by Dr. and Mrs.
Jordan disprove the contention of some
authorities who have denied that it was
ever inhabited. With these are some
prayer sticks found in a niche of the
cliffs at Acoma.
Three prayer boards from the interior
of Asia are among the recent acquisi
tions. These were obtained from Bud
dhist priests in Manchu, Mongolia, and
Thibet, who were in need of money.
These boards are hand-carved and very
old.
Also on exhibition in this case are
three beautiful pieces of old needlework:
a samples done in Ireland in 1815, a
hand-made Japanese handkerchief, and
one with a German bead design.
