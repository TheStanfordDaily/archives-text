# Grid Game Celebrates Fifty-Fifth Birthday
## 
### 
Intercollegiate football yesterday
celebrated the fifty-fifth anniversary
of its birth. The first gridiron game in
America was a contest between teams
representing Rutgers and Princeton
on November 6, 1869.
The game at that time resembled
rugby more than the present style of
play. Princeton, Rutgers, and Yale
drafted a set of rules in 1873 modeled
upon the "association" code, and In
1876 Yale, Harvard and
Columbia formulated a modified rugby
code which formed the real basis of
the modern game.
Soccer is making its debut at the
University of Washington today with
the first workout of the teams of the
Engineering school. The games will
all be between teams of engineers.
Women of the University of Minne
sota recently held a hockey mass
meeting to discuss training rules.
