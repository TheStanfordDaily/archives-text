# BANK SOCCER MEN HOLD CARDS TO 2-2 DRAW ON WET FIELD
## 
### 
Handicapped by a wet playing field
and an unlucky break, Stanford's soc
cer varsity was held to a 2 to 2 tie
by the supposedly weak Bank of Italy
eleven Saturday in the Golden Gate
Btadiurn in San Francisco.
The rain which fell throughout the
contest seemed to dampen the ardor
of the Cards, and they failed to dis
play their customary punch. A slip
pery ball and an abundance of mud
did not faze the bankers, who showed
unusual strength.
When Forrest, Stanford goal-keeper,
took more than two steps with the
ball in the final period, the referee
awarded the bank players a free kick,
which they made good, evening the
count.
Freshmen Lose
Although they displayed better team
work than they have displayed so far
this season, the freshmen were unable
to stem the attack of the strong Half
Moon Bay aggregation on the Stanford
field and dropped the game by a 5 to 0
ucore.
The Half Moon Bay eleven leads
the league in which the first-year men
are entered. The Bay team is com
posed of men who have played to
gether for five or six years. The rough
spots which showed in the babes' play
Saturday will be smoothed over before
their meeting with the California
freshmen tomorrow.
