# BRUIN BASKETBALL SQUADS START HOOP PRACTICE TOMORROW
## 
### 
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA,
November 10.â€”With the football season
Hearing completion, the California var
sity basketball team will start practice
tomorrow at Harmon Gymnasium with
the coast conference title as their goal
again.
"Nibs" Price, erstwhile freshman bas
ketball coach and assistant football men
tor at present, has been named to succeed
Earl Wight as varsity basketball coach.
His appointment is a popular one, and
he is looking forward to forming a team
capable of retaining the conference
championship for the Bears.
Although Johnny Talt, Hap Houvenin,
and Kincaid, three of California's most
reliable backsters last year, are lost to
the squad by graduation, plenty of vet
eran material is at hand to form the
nucleus of the 1925 squad. Captain
Sammy Ladar and Benny Holmes, the
two fast forwards; Bill Higgins, center;
Herold Belasco and Vernon Carver,
guards, are all veterans of the team last
year. Other promising candidates for
the team who will give the veterans a
run for their positions are: Clement,
former 145-pound star; Healy, Lifshiz,
and Mills of last year's freshman quintet.
Freshman basketball practice will also
begin with the varsity turnout. Many
former prep stars are anxious to get on
the court again to show their stuff.
Although no freshman coach to succeed
"Nibs" Price has been selected yet, it is
expected that lie soon will be appointed.
The men's interfraternity council
at Ohio State College is offering a
gold medal to the freshman making
the best scholarship average during
the year.
