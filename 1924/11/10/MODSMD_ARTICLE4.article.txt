# ILLUSTRATIONS BY NEW YORK ARTISTS IN CAMPUS EXHIBIT
## Water Color Works Placed in Stanford Art Gallery Until December 1 
### Allene Thorpe 
Illustrations and water colors by
twenty-eight New York artists were
placed on exhibition at the Stanford Art
Gallery yesterday. The work will be on j
display until December 1.
The growth of the printing industry
and the establishment of hundreds of
magazines in this country has brought
about the development of a group of
artists who specialize in illustrations for <
these periodicals.
The natural step between such illus- '
trators and the so-called "high artists"
mural painters, portrait artists, etchers,
and similar men, is very slight as is
evidenced by the fact that most illus
trators also produce the "high-art" type
of paintings either as a hobby or an
additional accomplishment.
In the list of exhibitors are seen the
names of such men as Andre Castaigne,
Charles Livingston Bull, Coles Phillips,
W. Benda, and Ralph Lester. The work
of these men is as well known to the pro- ;
fessional artist as well as to magazine i
readers.
Andre Castaigne in "The Arrival" j
works both in crayons and water color, j
He has long been prominent as a genius j
in obtaining fine effects in high light and :
shadow. With this ability is combined j
a delicate line technique which is t>pical (
ot his work.
Charles Livingston Bull is a master in |
drawing bird and animal life. Many of \
the well-known magazines call upon him
to illustrate stories dealing with such !
subjects. His work is marked by a dec- i
orative flat style of drawing and reminds I
one of the character of Japanese prints. ;
His picture, "Near the Line of Everlast- J
mg Snow," is a combination of char
coal, ink, and water color.
"A Study in Green" shows the char- '
acteristic style of Coles Phillips. He j
makes use of the background as part of
his foreground figure. Phillips has been |
especially popular with magazine readers j
in recent years.
Charcoal is the medium W. Benda em- j
ploys in the "Indian Princess," although 1
he works in various others. He is in de- j
mand as a cover designer, for which it
is said his wife and daughters generally
pose as his models.
Other artists represented are: Cole,
Heller, Hubbard, Wright, Harding, Tif
fany, and Brush.
Hubbard's drawing, "Black and
White," shows an interesting pen and ink
technique done in a strong vigorous style.
In contrast is noticed the oil painting,
"The Dispatch Bearer," by Gilbert Gaul.
This has been done in a flat finish oil
effect to avoid glossy reflections which
often cause trouble in the photo-engrav
ing process.
"The Peasant Woman," by E. Barnard,
is an example of transparent water-color
technique, which has long been reco.e
nized as one of the most difficult medi
ums. A close inspection of this painting
will reveal surprising lack of detail.

The natural step between such illus- '
trators and the so-called "high artists"
mural painters, portrait artists, etchers,
and similar men, is very slight as is
evidenced by the fact that most illus
trators also produce the "high-art" type
of paintings either as a hobby or an
additional accomplishment.
In the list of exhibitors are seen the
names of such men as Andre Castaigne,
Charles Livingston Bull, Coles Phillips,
W. Benda, and Ralph Lester. The work
of these men is as well known to the pro- ;
fessional artist as well as to magazine i
readers.
Andre Castaigne in "The Arrival" j
works both in crayons and water color, j
He has long been prominent as a genius j
in obtaining fine effects in high light and :
shadow. With this ability is combined j
a delicate line technique which is t>pical (
ot his work.
Charles Livingston Bull is a master in |
drawing bird and animal life. Many of \
the well-known magazines call upon him
to illustrate stories dealing with such !
subjects. His work is marked by a dec- i
orative flat style of drawing and reminds I
one of the character of Japanese prints. ;
His picture, "Near the Line of Everlast- J
mg Snow," is a combination of char
coal, ink, and water color.
"A Study in Green" shows the char- '
acteristic style of Coles Phillips. He j
makes use of the background as part of
his foreground figure. Phillips has been |
especially popular with magazine readers j
in recent years.
Charcoal is the medium W. Benda em- j
ploys in the "Indian Princess," although 1
he works in various others. He is in de- j
mand as a cover designer, for which it
is said his wife and daughters generally
pose as his models.
Other artists represented are: Cole,
Heller, Hubbard, Wright, Harding, Tif
fany, and Brush.
Hubbard's drawing, "Black and
White," shows an interesting pen and ink
technique done in a strong vigorous style.
In contrast is noticed the oil painting,
"The Dispatch Bearer," by Gilbert Gaul.
This has been done in a flat finish oil
effect to avoid glossy reflections which
often cause trouble in the photo-engrav
ing process.
"The Peasant Woman," by E. Barnard,
is an example of transparent water-color
technique, which has long been reco.e
nized as one of the most difficult medi
ums. A close inspection of this painting
will reveal surprising lack of detail.
Illustrations and water colors by
twenty-eight New York artists were
placed on exhibition at the Stanford Art
Gallery yesterday. The work will be on j
display until December 1.

and the establishment of hundreds of
magazines in this country has brought
