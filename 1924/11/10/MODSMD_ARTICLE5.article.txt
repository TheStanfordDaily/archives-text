# CARDINAL BABES DOWN BEARS IN SPECTACULAR BATE, 16-0
## California Freshmen Held Twice in Shadow of Goal Posts by Stone- Wall Defense 
### Douglas Meservey 
BADLY lacerated by Bear claws during the first half Saturday, a stubborn
Cardinal defense twice staved off a touchdown and defeat, thereby
paving the way to a smashing and spectacular finish over California's
| freshman eleven, 16 to 0.
Following the usual Blue and Gold procedure, the Cubs had probably
intended to wait for the breaks and take advantage of them. But the Card
i yearlings beat them at their own game and when the first fumble occurred in
the first quarter, it was "Mike" Murphy, Stanford quarter, who scooped it up
I and galloped fifty-seven yards to the first touchdown.
This happened on the thirteenth play of the game. From the kick-off to
the twelfth play, a powerful California backfield had been busy ripping off
J gains through the Stanford line. Perrin and Maurice alternated in tlie

S>damaging business except for an ex
change of kicks between Zweiner and
Altaffer.
Fumble Costly
Then came a line-buck by Perrin
which began well but ended in his
fumble on the Card forty-three yard
line, followed by Murphy's run, with
perfect interference, for the first score.
Altaffer failed to convert.
The situation as presented now was:
Stanford had pressed into a six-point
lead through a break. Would the Cubs
continue to exhibit their power? As if
answering the question, Maurice and
Perrin took the ball after the kickoff
to the Card nine-yard line in twelve
plays. Repeating last year's perform
ance, the Redshirts stiffened at this
point and forced the Cubs to give up
the ball on downs.
Receiving the ball on Altaffer's k
rushed kick, California again began
its march down the field —this time to
be held on Stanford's two-yard line.
But they had shot their bolt and from
then on everything was "Stanford."
Hill Runs Wild
It was now time for the Cards to'
show their punch—and they did. Hill j
began the fireworks with a gain of
twenty-four yards on a pass from
Altaffer. This was followed by effec
tive bucks by Millage and Hill for
good gains with the line opening bet
ter holes than previously.
Near the end of the half, California,
on the Card forty-yard line, attempted
a pass. Millage intercepted it and be
gan a sixty-three yard run through
broken field to the Cubs' eight-yard
line. It was a Wonderful piece of work
and deserved a touchdown as a climax
but the gun stopped the next play.
The last half, which ended in almost
complete darkness, was without doubt
"all Stanford." "Husky" Hunt's offense
had hit its stride and, led by Altaffer,
it made gain after gain through the
Cub line. Scrimmage figures show that
194 yards were gained the last two
periods by the Stanford backs as com
pared with 31 for California.
Thrilling Gains
It was a half filled with thrills for
Hill, Dorcy, Millage, and Altaffer con
tinually made long and spectacular
runs.
A place kick by Altaffer in the third
quarter was followed two minutes
later by a splendid run by Dorcy for
the second touchdown, a distance of
forty-eight yards with no interference
and through a broken field.
The babes' showing was a complete
surprise to the majority of onlookers.
In the backfleld, no one man stood out
high above the rest, unless it was
Altaffer.
Very close behind, however, were
Hill, Dorcy, Nichols, and Millage. The
latter reminded one of Nevers by the
manner in wnich he backed up the
line on defense.
Line Shows Class
The line, which had trouble in be
ginning its effective work, ended by
proving itself superior to the heavier
Bruin line. Captain Robesky, Bigelow,
and Post were perhaps the most out
standing players. Dennis and Vincenti,
at ends, also played a good game.

BADLY lacerated by Bear claws during the first half Saturday, a stubborn
Cardinal defense twice staved off a touchdown and defeat, thereby
paving the way to a smashing and spectacular finish over California's
| freshman eleven, 16 to 0.
Following the usual Blue and Gold procedure, the Cubs had probably
intended to wait for the breaks and take advantage of them. But the Card
i yearlings beat them at their own game and when the first fumble occurred in
the first quarter, it was "Mike" Murphy, Stanford quarter, who scooped it up
I and galloped fifty-seven yards to the first touchdown.
This happened on the thirteenth play of the game. From the kick-off to
the twelfth play, a powerful California backfield had been busy ripping off
J gains through the Stanford line. Perrin and Maurice alternated in tlie

S>damaging business except for an ex
change of kicks between Zweiner and
Altaffer.
Fumble Costly
Then came a line-buck by Perrin
which began well but ended in his
fumble on the Card forty-three yard
line, followed by Murphy's run, with
perfect interference, for the first score.
Altaffer failed to convert.
The situation as presented now was:
Stanford had pressed into a six-point
lead through a break. Would the Cubs
continue to exhibit their power? As if
answering the question, Maurice and
Perrin took the ball after the kickoff
to the Card nine-yard line in twelve
plays. Repeating last year's perform
ance, the Redshirts stiffened at this
point and forced the Cubs to give up
the ball on downs.
Receiving the ball on Altaffer's k
rushed kick, California again began
its march down the field —this time to
be held on Stanford's two-yard line.
But they had shot their bolt and from
then on everything was "Stanford."
Hill Runs Wild
It was now time for the Cards to'
show their punch—and they did. Hill j
began the fireworks with a gain of
twenty-four yards on a pass from
Altaffer. This was followed by effec
tive bucks by Millage and Hill for
good gains with the line opening bet
ter holes than previously.
Near the end of the half, California,
on the Card forty-yard line, attempted
a pass. Millage intercepted it and be
gan a sixty-three yard run through
broken field to the Cubs' eight-yard
line. It was a Wonderful piece of work
and deserved a touchdown as a climax
but the gun stopped the next play.
The last half, which ended in almost
complete darkness, was without doubt
"all Stanford." "Husky" Hunt's offense
had hit its stride and, led by Altaffer,
it made gain after gain through the
Cub line. Scrimmage figures show that
194 yards were gained the last two
periods by the Stanford backs as com
pared with 31 for California.
Thrilling Gains
It was a half filled with thrills for
Hill, Dorcy, Millage, and Altaffer con
tinually made long and spectacular
runs.
A place kick by Altaffer in the third
quarter was followed two minutes
later by a splendid run by Dorcy for
the second touchdown, a distance of
forty-eight yards with no interference
and through a broken field.
The babes' showing was a complete
surprise to the majority of onlookers.
In the backfleld, no one man stood out
high above the rest, unless it was
Altaffer.
Very close behind, however, were
Hill, Dorcy, Nichols, and Millage. The
latter reminded one of Nevers by the
manner in wnich he backed up the
line on defense.
Line Shows Class
The line, which had trouble in be
ginning its effective work, ended by
proving itself superior to the heavier
Bruin line. Captain Robesky, Bigelow,
and Post were perhaps the most out
standing players. Dennis and Vincenti,
at ends, also played a good game.

BADLY lacerated by Bear claws during the first half Saturday, a stubborn
Cardinal defense twice staved off a touchdown and defeat, thereby
paving the way to a smashing and spectacular finish over California's
| freshman eleven, 16 to 0.
Following the usual Blue and Gold procedure, the Cubs had probably
intended to wait for the breaks and take advantage of them. But the Card
i yearlings beat them at their own game and when the first fumble occurred in
the first quarter, it was "Mike" Murphy, Stanford quarter, who scooped it up
I and galloped fifty-seven yards to the first touchdown.
This happened on the thirteenth play of the game. From the kick-off to
the twelfth play, a powerful California backfield had been busy ripping off
J gains through the Stanford line. Perrin and Maurice alternated in tlie

S>damaging business except for an ex
change of kicks between Zweiner and
Altaffer.
Fumble Costly
Then came a line-buck by Perrin
which began well but ended in his
fumble on the Card forty-three yard
line, followed by Murphy's run, with
perfect interference, for the first score.
Altaffer failed to convert.
The situation as presented now was:
Stanford had pressed into a six-point
lead through a break. Would the Cubs
continue to exhibit their power? As if
answering the question, Maurice and
Perrin took the ball after the kickoff
to the Card nine-yard line in twelve
plays. Repeating last year's perform
ance, the Redshirts stiffened at this
point and forced the Cubs to give up
the ball on downs.
Receiving the ball on Altaffer's k
rushed kick, California again began
its march down the field —this time to
be held on Stanford's two-yard line.
But they had shot their bolt and from
then on everything was "Stanford."
Hill Runs Wild
It was now time for the Cards to'
show their punch—and they did. Hill j
began the fireworks with a gain of
twenty-four yards on a pass from
Altaffer. This was followed by effec
tive bucks by Millage and Hill for
good gains with the line opening bet
ter holes than previously.
Near the end of the half, California,
on the Card forty-yard line, attempted
a pass. Millage intercepted it and be
gan a sixty-three yard run through
broken field to the Cubs' eight-yard
line. It was a Wonderful piece of work
and deserved a touchdown as a climax
but the gun stopped the next play.
The last half, which ended in almost
complete darkness, was without doubt
"all Stanford." "Husky" Hunt's offense
had hit its stride and, led by Altaffer,
it made gain after gain through the
Cub line. Scrimmage figures show that
194 yards were gained the last two
periods by the Stanford backs as com
pared with 31 for California.
Thrilling Gains
It was a half filled with thrills for
Hill, Dorcy, Millage, and Altaffer con
tinually made long and spectacular
runs.
A place kick by Altaffer in the third
quarter was followed two minutes
later by a splendid run by Dorcy for
the second touchdown, a distance of
forty-eight yards with no interference
and through a broken field.
The babes' showing was a complete
surprise to the majority of onlookers.
In the backfleld, no one man stood out
high above the rest, unless it was
Altaffer.
Very close behind, however, were
Hill, Dorcy, Nichols, and Millage. The
latter reminded one of Nevers by the
manner in wnich he backed up the
line on defense.
Line Shows Class
The line, which had trouble in be
ginning its effective work, ended by
proving itself superior to the heavier
Bruin line. Captain Robesky, Bigelow,
and Post were perhaps the most out
standing players. Dennis and Vincenti,
at ends, also played a good game.
The startling line-up was as follows:
Stanford— California—
