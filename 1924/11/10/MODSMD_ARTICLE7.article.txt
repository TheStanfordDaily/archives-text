# Giant Bonfire Is Aim Of Freshman Laboring Outfits
## 
### 
Continuing the work started last Sat
urday morning, the freshmen took a few
more steps today to make the bonfire for
tin's year the "biggest and best ever."
The plans call for a square at the bot
tom of the structure 30x30 feet and a
total height of 70 feet.
Pits for the four telephone posts which
will form the backbone of the structure
were dug last Saturday. The posts will
be here soon and they will be set in the
place as quickly as possible, after which
the cross-tree will be nailed in place.
The head contractors arc "Jim'
Sapero, Lee Bering, and Lynn Hogun.
The chairman of the time-keeping com
mittee is "Buck" Maynard. According
to Maynard, every freshman who does
not put in his fifteen hours of work and
eight hours of guarding will be sent
through a paddling machine composed of
every member of the freshman class.
Search for Wood
Every means possible is being used by
the freshmen to obtain wood for their
structure. The people of Palo Alto have
been requested to place all wood which
they may care to offer in their backyards
so that it may be hauled to the scene of
the fire.
Any fraternity or sorority houses hav
ing wood that they may wish to con
tribute are asked to leave it in readily
accessible places. The campus within
the next few days will be scoured of all
spare wood by freshmen patrols.
The fire this year will be built at the
same place as the other freshman bon
fires, near the power house. Two nights
before the Big Game all the work of the
freshman class will literally "go up in
smoke" as the sequel of the Big Game
rally.
