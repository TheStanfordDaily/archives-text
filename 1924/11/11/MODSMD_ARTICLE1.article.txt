"I was a member of the American
Expeditionary Forces from the sum
mer of 1918 until the Armistice," he
remarked, "and was at the headquar
ters or the first army when the war
ended.
"Being there then as a soldier, I
saw things through a soldier's eyes.
In my trip to Europe last summer I
saw conditions in a different light.
"In the last months of the war I
noted the effect of Wilson's idealism
upon Europe, and looked forward to
the rebuilding of the nations upon the
Wilsonian principles.
"After the struggle, however, there
was a gigantic conflict between the
forces of idealism and victory. The
heritage of was included problems of
security, reparations, armaments, and
the League.
"I was in Paris on July 4, and heard
Premier Herriot speak before a group
of French and Americans, on Franco-
American solidarity. A few days later
1 saw the Prince of Wales dedicate a
tablet in Notre Dame commemorating
British efforts in the War.
"At the opening of the Olympic
games the Prince of Wales, General
Pershing, and the President of France
were given an ovation which showed
the popularity of the Allies among the
forty-five nations present.
"This year France dispensed with
the usual military parade on the na
tional holiday, July 14. for the first
time since the Armistice. Fireworks
were used instead. Being in Switzer
land when that country celebrated its
national holiday, I was impressed with
the military parade.
"The most impressive sight in the
battlefields is the Trench of Bayonets.
A monument is erected over the war
trench, in which the entire line of
soldiers, ready to attack, was buried
alive by the explosion of a shell."
