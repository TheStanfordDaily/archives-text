# TICKETS FOR R.U.R. STAY ON SALE ENTIRE WEEK
## Startling Mechanical Effects Constructed for Play By Electrician 
### 
Tickets for "R. U. R." will be on sale
the rest of the week at the Dramatic
Manager's office in the Administration
building. Prices have undergone a re-;
j vision under the new system of dra- J
matics, the best seats selling for one
| dollar, with the balcony going at 75
| cents.
The mechanical effects of "R. U. R.,"
which promise to be the most startling
ever seen on the campus, have been
constructed by Hume West, electri
cian for the play. A howling wind, an
explosion, and a factory whistle which
blows all through the last part of the
third act, are some of the more im- 1
portant effects which are calculated
to thrill the audience. The explosion,
which is the most ambitious single
mechanical effect ever attempted at
Stanford, will be heard all over the
Quad. When it was first tried at re
hearsal last Saturday, people from the
Administration office came running to
view the remains of the Assembly hall,
! so loud was the report.
The mob scenes of the play have
| been perfected, and the robot horde
is expected to furnish many thrills of
the evening. Gordon Davis has worked
on the fifteen men who will portray
the robots, until their actions are as
mechanical as machinery.
