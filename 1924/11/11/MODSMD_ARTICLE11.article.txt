Sigma Alpha Epsilon's entry of a
four-man team brings the total enroll
ment in Saturday's intramural "Tur
key Race" to fourteen men, with most
of the campus living groups yet to be
heard from. In addition to the S. A. E. j
quartet, four members of Breakers and
six independent runners have signed
up.
Tomorrow night has been set as the
deadline for entries.
Besides the two ten-pound turkeys i
which constitute the team prize, gold,
silver, and bronze medals will be
awarded to the individual runners who
finish first, second, and third.
