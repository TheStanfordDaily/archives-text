# STUDENT TASTE FAVORS MOVIE, HUMOR MAGAZINES
## Bookstore Statistics Show Decided Lack Of Literary Interest On Campus 
### Steve O'Donnell 
! By their choice of magazines, resi
j dents in this center of culture betray j
' a decided preference for popular fic-1
tion, humor, and "movie" news with a
comparatively slight interest in liter
ary publications of so-called "high- ;
j brow" nature.
This statement is made on the basis
of figures obtained at the Stanford
Bookstore. These figures were so defi
nite in their inference as to leave no
shadow of doubt in the mind of the
reporter as to the taste of students
i, in their periodical reading.

e | The largest circulation of all be
• longg to the popular fiction magazines,
>• led by the Saturday Evening Post with
>• 80 copies per week. Interest in the
| doings of filmdom accounts for the

sale of some 25 copies of various
"movie" magazines, while College
Humor sells at the rate of fifty copies
for each edition. Judge and Life go at
the rate of 2 and 6 copies respectively.
Opposed to this we find a grand total
of 7 copies made up by pooling the
sale of Atlantic Monthly, Harper's,
Century, and Scribner's. Most of these,
the bookstore authorities assure us, go
to professors. If students read these
magazines, they do so in the Library.
In the field of Science, four times
as many Popular Mechanics are sold
as Scientific Americans, while more
Radio magazines are bought than both
of these combined.
Here are the actual figures. Allow
ance must be made in reading them
for the fact that a number of maga
zines are taken directly by regular sub-
scription. However, following the law !
of averages, it is fair to assume that
these figures do give a basis for com
parison since there are probably in

sale of some 25 copies of various

Humor sells at the rate of fifty copies
for each edition. Judge and Life go at
the rate of 2 and 6 copies respectively.
Opposed to this we find a grand total
of 7 copies made up by pooling the
sale of Atlantic Monthly, Harper's,
Century, and Scribner's. Most of these,
the bookstore authorities assure us, go
to professors. If students read these
magazines, they do so in the Library.
In the field of Science, four times
as many Popular Mechanics are sold
as Scientific Americans, while more
Radio magazines are bought than both
of these combined.
Here are the actual figures. Allow
ance must be made in reading them
for the fact that a number of maga
zines are taken directly by regular sub-
scription. However, following the law !
