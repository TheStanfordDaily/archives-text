"movie" magazines, while College
Humor sells at the rate of fifty copies
for each edition. Judge and Life go at
the rate of 2 and 6 copies respectively.

magazines, they do so in the Library.

as many Popular Mechanics are sold
as Scientific Americans, while more
Radio magazines are bought than both
of these combined.
Here are the actual figures. Allow

for the fact that a number of maga
zines are taken directly by regular sub-
