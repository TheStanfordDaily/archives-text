# Rally Committee Allots Band Two Hundred Dollars
## 
### 
Two hundred dollars will be donated j
to the band by the rally committee for!
! i;. in purchasing new uniforms and
in ri fraying operating expenses, on
ico'Mition that the musicians make an j
unusually good showing this quarter.
Which means that the band will be j
decidedly among those present at all j
| rallies and -games, doing its durndest'
to clinch the 200 iron men by injecting >
| the maximum of pep into its work, j
The rally committee was forced to '
strain its treasury to the limit to make \
the appropriation, as the expenses for
the Big Game alone will amount to
more than $400. It is hoped that the
students will show their appreciation
by turning out 100 per cent strong for
all future noise-generating ceremonies, â€¢
I starting with the rally for the Mon-
I tana game Thursday night.
