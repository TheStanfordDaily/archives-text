# QUAD SECURES AID OF FAMOUS BLACK AND WHITE ARTIST
## W. F. Rauschnabel Consents To Do Art Work for Stanford Annual 
### 
W. F. Rausclinabel, acknowledged
one of the four greatest black-and
white artists in the United States, has
been engaged to do art work on the
1926 Quad.
This is the first time that Rauscli
nabel has consented to assist in the
production of a college annual. Pro
fessionally, he designs special editions
for private libraries, and his work is
much -in demand.
Rausclinabel's designing and art
I work is expected to form one of the
features of the 1926 year book. He has
: a style of his own —original and dis- ;
tinctive —which has made him famous
' all through the West. He has been in
i Europe for nearly a year, and has but
recently returned to active work.
This year's annual is being planned
in six divisions or books, each dealing
with a different aspect of the Univer
sity, and each introduced by a decora
tive page. Many entirely new lay-outs
will be included in the book, among
! them those of seniors and of living!
groups. The latter will have drawings
in tint of houses and halls instead of
! the usual photographs.
Six full-page color pieces in oil will
illustrate the volume's theme, the sub
ject of wliic his not being disclosed by
the editors. Pictures for the view sec
tion will be taken by Gabriel Moulin,
who is considered by many the great
est artistic photographed in the West.
Something entirely new will be a
section on traditions. This will be a
! continuous history of Stanford's
growth, emphasizing student life, j
Many old pictures will be used which
' have hitherto never been published. |
! Scenes from early class-fights and the
like will be included.
Another new feature is the pictorial
section, devoted to illustrating every
day student life as it really is. The
Roble eight-o'clock rush, the reference
room queeners, and such usual phases
: of campus life will be found here.
The athletics division will include
j an illustrated Olympic Games section
showing Stanford participants in ac
j tion. And at the end of the book will
i be found a bigger and better razz sec
i tion, liberally sprinkled with cartoons.
