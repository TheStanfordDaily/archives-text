# MONTANA. TRAILING P. C. CONFERENCE, IS NEXT CARD FOE
## Warner Now Pointing Team Toward Big Game With Bruins 
### Hugh Hollembeak 
' With less than two weeks remain
-1 ing before the Big Game, the Stanford
varsity entered its last stage of train
ing yesterday afternoon when "Pop"
Warner sent the boys through their
paces in an effort to whip them into
! tip-top shape for the California con
test and incidentally to prepare them
for their game with the University of
Montana in the stadium Saturday af
j ternoon.
Montana, playing its first year of
; football as a member of the Pacific
Coast Conference, has met with little
success so far this season in its efforts
to break into the win column and,
1 judging by the form the Cards showed
] last Saturday, when they defeated the
' University of Utah 30 to 0. Stanford
' should romp off with a rather easy
i win.
The Grizzlies have dropped both of
j the conference games in which they
have participated to date, Washington
bowling them over by a 52 to 7 score,
while the same Idaho eleven that lost
to Stanford 3 to 0 had little trouble in
winning from the Missoula team 40
to 13. Even little Gonzaga defeated
Montana by the margin of one touch
down, but this does not seem such a
disgrace when the superb brand of
football put up by the Spokane Catho
lics is taken into consideration.
These scores would indicate that
Stanford had a wide margin over the
invaders. Montana has proved to be a
i weak defensive team and Warner's
| galaxy of "star backs should have little
difficulty in piling up a comfortable
lead. On the offense the Grizzlies have
i several good ground-gainers, a fact
that is best proved by*the fact that
Montana has scored against every one
of its opponents. However, the great
i work of the Stanford defense against
j Utah makes it extremely doubtful
, whether a team of the visitors' cali-
I bre can advance the ball consistently.
Stanford came out of the Utah game
! unscathed after proving conclusively
in the last quarter of play that the
