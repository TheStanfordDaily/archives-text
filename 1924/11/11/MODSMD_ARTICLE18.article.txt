# MONTANA. TRAILING P. C. CONFERENCE, IS NEXT CARD FOE
## Warner Now Pointing Team Toward Big Game With Bruins 
### Hugh Hollembeak 
' With less than two weeks remain
-1 ing before the Big Game, the Stanford
varsity entered its last stage of train
ing yesterday afternoon when "Pop"
Warner sent the boys through their
paces in an effort to whip them into
! tip-top shape for the California con
test and incidentally to prepare them
for their game with the University of
Montana in the stadium Saturday af
j ternoon.
Montana, playing its first year of
; football as a member of the Pacific
Coast Conference, has met with little
success so far this season in its efforts
to break into the win column and,
1 judging by the form the Cards showed
] last Saturday, when they defeated the
' University of Utah 30 to 0. Stanford
' should romp off with a rather easy
i win.
The Grizzlies have dropped both of
j the conference games in which they
have participated to date, Washington
bowling them over by a 52 to 7 score,
while the same Idaho eleven that lost
to Stanford 3 to 0 had little trouble in
winning from the Missoula team 40
to 13. Even little Gonzaga defeated
Montana by the margin of one touch
down, but this does not seem such a
disgrace when the superb brand of
football put up by the Spokane Catho
lics is taken into consideration.
These scores would indicate that
Stanford had a wide margin over the
invaders. Montana has proved to be a
i weak defensive team and Warner's
| galaxy of "star backs should have little
difficulty in piling up a comfortable
lead. On the offense the Grizzlies have
i several good ground-gainers, a fact
that is best proved by*the fact that
Montana has scored against every one
of its opponents. However, the great
i work of the Stanford defense against
j Utah makes it extremely doubtful
, whether a team of the visitors' cali-
I bre can advance the ball consistently.
Stanford came out of the Utah game
! unscathed after proving conclusively
in the last quarter of play that the
team had lots of power and plenty of
reserve strength. The work of Hey,
Nevers, and Cleaveland at advancing
the ball was great, and except for the
times in the first half when Cuddeback
was forced to kick, there seemed to
be plenty of punch to make required
yardage.
Nevers should put up a much better
game Saturday than he did last week.
This is no reflection on his work j
against the Mormons but nevertheless
another week of practice should see
him in shape to play a better game.
After his long lay-off it was only na
tural that he should have some diffi
culty in hitting his regular pace in
his first start, but from now on it wi'l
be another story.
The stellar work of the Cardinal :
ends against Utah was one of the
salient features of the day's play. Cap
tain Lawson was simply too good for
the Salt Lake backs and from the
showing Ted Shipkey made on thei
other end it looks like Blake Thomas
will have a hard time reclaiming his :
old place even if he does get back into ,
playing condition. Shipkey looked :
mighty good when he grabbed Nevers' j
pass and scampered over the goal line i
for Stanford's first touchdown. That 1
one play gives a pretty good hint of
what "Pop" is working up for the j
Bears.
From now on Warner's work will
consist mainly in polishing off the
rough spots and rehearsing his plays i
until they are letter-perfect. The |
foundations are all laid and the prob
lem now is largely one of getting the ;
team to run smoothly and certainly.
Mitchell played a good game at quar
ter Saturday and it is possible that
he may be used to call signals against
Montana, although Solomon rtill has
the edge on him for the regular job.
While there are still momenta when
the play looks ragged the work of the
team showed a great deal of improve
ment and the situation in general took
on a rosier tinge. Now that Nevers is
back on the field "Pop" can add the
finishing touches to his work of the
early season and, according to all in
dications, the Stanford varsity should
be the best team representing the Uni
versity in recent years when it enters
the California Stadium November 22.
International intercollegiate radio
chess will make its first appearance
late in November, when Haverford and !
Oxford hold a match. Intercollegiatc,
matches of this kind have been played
between American universities, >but ;
this will be the first time that an'
American and an English college will
contest.
