# 1927 DOPED TO WIN INTERCLASS SERIES IN GAME TOMORROW
## 
### 
Favored on the basis of compara
tive scores as the probable victors,
sophomore football men take the field
tomorrow against the juniors in the
championship game of the interclass
grid series. The contest will start at
4 p.m., sharp, on the freshman practice
field.
Each eleven has battled to a score
less tie with the seniors, and each is
! credited with a victory over the fresh
men. The sophs downed the yearlings
; by a 28 to 0 count, while the third
l year team came through with a 9 to 0
j win. Which would indicate that '27 is
! three touchdowns stronger than its
rivals, but the fallacy of doping a
game on comparative scores has been
proved time and again.
The seniors have no chance for
i championship honors unless tomor-
I row's game should end in a tie which
was not played off, and unless they
i should in addition trim the freshmen
on Thursday. In that case, a triple tie
for first place would exist. The babes
haven't a look-in, owing to their dou
ble defeat.
Seraphim Post's sophomores have a
larger and better-trained squad than
the '26 men. They boast a good field
general and punter in MacDougall and
a flashy open-field runner in Smythe.
A fairly heavy line and fast ends ren
der them dangerous on the offense.
Randolph, fullback, is the shining
light of Dave Mannoccir's team. He,
together with Morgan at half, was re
sponsible for a majority of the junior
yardage against the freshmen. Stock
bridge, who has been made over into
a guard from a fullback, and Cam
eron, at tackle, are the mainstays of
an otherwise light forward wall.
Members of all four interclass
squads are asked to be out in uniform
Wednesday, as photographers will bo
on hand to take pictures for the 1926
Quad.
