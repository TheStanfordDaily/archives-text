The request was made last week that all students attending the fresh
man game last Saturday wear to facilitate and improve the
bleacher stunts, which were to he inaugurated in a modest way as prac
tice for the usual elaborate program at the Big Game. Only a compara
tively small number complied, and the stunts suffered in consequence.
That same request has been repeated for the Montana game this week,
with the added condition that no student will be admitted to the rooting
section without this all-important red-and-whitte roof. Which is entirely
as it should be. The section must be uniform to be impressive, and it must
also be drilled at least once or twice before the real test of team-work and
decorative cooperation.
The first and easiest step toward perfection in rooting is simply to ac
quire the cap and wear it when requested. After that, the relatively com
plex matters of synchronized vocalizing and manipulation of designs upon
a human background may be undertaken with perfect confidence. So
gather up your rooter's cap, meet the yell-leader half way, and forget
about preserving your singing voice, and the Stanford noise section will
be as it should be.
