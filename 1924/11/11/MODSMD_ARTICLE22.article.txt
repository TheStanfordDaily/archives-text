Intercollegiate football was fifty-five years old last week. More than
half a century is enough for any man to attain his majority, but it takes
much longer than that for an institution to reach its full limit of growth.
Ideally, in fact, such is never possible, but always there is opportunity for
adjustment, revision, and improvement.
There are two ways of looking at football in the light of its recent
birthday. One is backward—the sweeping and innumerable changes in
rules, equipment, importance, and public notice. The other is forward,
and as such will necessarily be less definite. The game will probably un
dergo as many changes during the next fifty-five years as it has during
the last—but what will they do? The present college generation—
especially the athletes—will have a large share in the future remodelling of
the game.
