# Fire Up!
## 
### 
Work is under way on a seemingly temporary contribution made by
the class of 1928 to the University—the Big Game bonfire. The fresh
men, for a week or ten days, will do a good deal of work and devote
many hours of time to a huge pile of timbers of doubtful architectural
merit, which will be removed in a couple of hours when the hold-overs
apply the torch a couple of days before the California game.
Every year there are a few who grumble over the time and labor
involved—calling it a sinful waste of effort and combustibles. Those
are generally people who have never been engaged in that pleasant and
productive labor of love. There is a thrill about it, and a permanent
reward.
The thrill is spread over the entire undertaking—the joy of discover
ing an abandoned barn door or flock of condemned and decrepit two-by
fours, the spectacular climbing of the heap to place the topmost articles
of the pyre, and the primitive roar of confidence and defiance when the
crowd serpentines around the flaming stack. It is hard, muscular work
for the University—something rarely offered to the man of unathletic
endowments, and something of value to him.
The reward is spread over all the rest of the individual's term of life
at Stanford, and sometimes beyond. Many an ancient and almost
bearded medic or lawyer will tell of the friendships formed during the
evolution of his class bonfire. They seem to have an enduring nature
the test by fire, so to speak. The "dog watch" of the guardians, with
the small camp-fires and false alarms and conversational groups, will
inspire friendships that endure. So the bonfire pays for itself, on the
installment plan.
