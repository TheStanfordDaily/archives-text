# TRYOUTS FOR "DULCY" CONTINUE TOMORROW
## 
### 
Further tryouts will be held for
"Duley," the sophomore play, in the
Little Theatre tomorrow afternoon
from 3 to 5, and in the evening from
7 to 8.
New tryoutees are urged to come
out at these times, as they will have
just as good a chance to make a part
as the ones who out today. Those
who passed the preliminary tryouts
will find their names posted on the
bulletin board outside of Gordon Davis*
office in the English building.
