"Ho, hum; what's new in the
papers" . . . our freshman team evi
dently played pretty well Saturday;
and if the freshman team of today is
the varsity of tomorrow the pleased
murmuring we hear among ourselves
is not a delusion. . . "Palms of vic
tory, palms of glory," h'm.
If you live in a small and petty
world, you will be subject to its stand
ards; but if you live in a large world,
you will see that standards are innu
merable."
It is a very, very small world, here
on the "Farm," where a saucy poster
pasted on the Law steps creates a fair
sized ripple over our placid surface;
while brooding over an athletic situa
tion produces quite a storm. By our
standards we are full of the most im
portant business; but the standards of
the world outside we rate —at the most
—an indulgent smile.
"The art of being human begins with
the practice of being genuine, and fol
lowing the standards of conduct which
the world has tested." There is such
a thing as being true to one's self and,
at the same time, loyal to one's college.
Reformers are necessary; but why
not have a little tact . . . and self
respect?
What we do not understand:
1. people who seem perfectly con
tent with their sleek, respectable
personalities . . who never "pull
up stakes" and go adventuring
through detours and rocky places,
hot suns, and sudden storms;
2. how anyone could be bored hav
ing read this far;
3. "Journalism, Law, and Love;"
4. A tiny baby black as coal.
Weighed on a scales last night
Which tipped at just a pound or
two— *
So dark . . . and yet so light!
"The Death Ray" is electricity trans
mitted by a beam of light which can
either illuminate or burn, varying with
the power applied. The "Death Ray"
isn't the only thing with that quality. (
"Be of good cheer —the sullen montfi i
will die,
And a young moon will requite us
by and by."
"When I come to die I know my
keenest regret will be that I suffered
myself to be annoyed by a lot of small
people and picayune worries, wasting
God's good time with both."
Herein layeth the lesson.
