# BRUINS CONTENTED BY THEIR SHOWING OF LAST SATURDAY

### Jerry Levin 
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA,
Nov. 11. —California's Bears have re
turnfd home from Seattle, not disap
pointed, but well satisfied, with a great
deal more experience gained !from
their 7 to 7 tilt with Washington last
Saturday. The Bruins are confident
that they will take Charlie Erb'a
Nevada" eleven into camp this Satur
day at the Memorial Stadium.
In the Nevada team Andy Smith
will be pitted against some of his own
strategy, for Charlie Erb, their coach,
is one of the foremost backfield men
turned out by Andy Smith. Erb was
quarterback of California's wonder
teams, serving his last year in 1922 as
captain. While he was quarterback
at California, Erb was proclaimed as
one of the smartest field generals on
the coast. He has been trained in
tensively by Andy Smith and knows
all the angles of the Smith system of
football. The game should offer a very
interesting spectacle in seeing what
Andy Smith's pupil will do to combat
the Bruin offensive and what sort of
offensive game the Nevadans will play.
As this game is the forerunner of
the Big Game with Stanford, which
will be played in the Memorial Stadium
on the following Saturday, Andy Smith
is not likely to open up with much
"trick stuff," but will no doubt give
most »i his reliable men a chance to
show their ability. The Bruins will
continue their practice for the remain
der of the week, looking forward to
the Stanford contest as well as the
one with the wolf pack.
However, Andy Smith is not making
light of the Nevada game. Last year
Andy took part of his men down to
the Stanford Farm to watch the Cardi
nals in action, but while they were
down at Palo Alto, the Nevadans were
pulling a surprise upon the Berkeley
campus against the Bears. The sur
prise was in the form of a scoreless
tie handed the Bruins. Although
Charlie Erb is anxious to hit his Alma
Mater hard, and no doubt he will make
a good impression in it, Andy will be
prepared this Saturday and California
should emerge victorious.
Both the Californians and the Ne
vadans are in fine shape after their tie
games last Saturday. While California
was in Seattle playing the Huskies a
7-7 tie, Nevada and the strong Santa
Clara team were fighting a hard battle
on a mud-soaked field in San Fran
cisco, the result being a 6-6 tie. Bar
ring injuries in the Nevada contest.
Coach Andy Smith hopes to have his
team in the peak of condition for their
biggest effort of the season against
their traditional rivals, Stanford, and
the Pacific Coast Conference cham
pionship for the fifth successive time.
Charlie Erb has been pointing his
team toward the California game all
season, and hopes to open up and show
Andy Smith and his gridders a little
of their own sort of play. His great
football brain, however, will be up
against one of equal if not much great
er knowledge and surely a great deal
more experience. It will be another
case of pupil against teacher. We look
for a hard-fought game with the
teacher still master at the end of the
fray.

Modern language tables of advanced
and beginning French, Spanish, and
German have been organized in the
campus dining halls at the University
of. Kansas. Diners at these tables talk

season, and hopes to open up and show
Andy Smith and his gridders a little

UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA,
Nov. 11. —California's Bears have re
turnfd home from Seattle, not disap
pointed, but well satisfied, with a great
deal more experience gained !from
their 7 to 7 tilt with Washington last
Saturday. The Bruins are confident
that they will take Charlie Erb'a
Nevada" eleven into camp this Satur
day at the Memorial Stadium.
In the Nevada team Andy Smith
will be pitted against some of his own
strategy, for Charlie Erb, their coach,
is one of the foremost backfield men
turned out by Andy Smith. Erb was
quarterback of California's wonder
teams, serving his last year in 1922 as
captain. While he was quarterback
at California, Erb was proclaimed as
one of the smartest field generals on
the coast. He has been trained in
tensively by Andy Smith and knows
all the angles of the Smith system of
football. The game should offer a very
interesting spectacle in seeing what
Andy Smith's pupil will do to combat
the Bruin offensive and what sort of
offensive game the Nevadans will play.
As this game is the forerunner of
the Big Game with Stanford, which
will be played in the Memorial Stadium
on the following Saturday, Andy Smith
is not likely to open up with much
"trick stuff," but will no doubt give
most »i his reliable men a chance to
show their ability. The Bruins will
continue their practice for the remain
der of the week, looking forward to
the Stanford contest as well as the
one with the wolf pack.
However, Andy Smith is not making
light of the Nevada game. Last year
Andy took part of his men down to
the Stanford Farm to watch the Cardi
nals in action, but while they were
down at Palo Alto, the Nevadans were
pulling a surprise upon the Berkeley
campus against the Bears. The sur
prise was in the form of a scoreless
tie handed the Bruins. Although
Charlie Erb is anxious to hit his Alma
Mater hard, and no doubt he will make
a good impression in it, Andy will be
prepared this Saturday and California
should emerge victorious.
