Worry over frequent examinations
i hinders the modern student from get
| ting the most possible good out of his
! study, is the opinion of Andrew C.
Lawson, professor of Geology and
: Mineralogy of the University of Cali
: fornia. He believes that the English
! system of comprehensive examina
j tlons is far superior to our system of

causes us to spend more time in the
open than do the eastern students.
While eastern students spend much
time reading books, California stu
dents gain a great amount of initiative,
originality, and experience by their
lives in the open.

a pity and a loss to society that so
many students devote the best years of
their lives to college, and then get so
little out of it.
