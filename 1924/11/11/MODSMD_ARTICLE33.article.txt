"The Russian people are discon
tented with the inefficient, autocratic
:control of the Soviet government, but
'dread revolution more than they de-
Hire reform," stated Edward Vail, as
sistant secretary of the Stanford Y.
-M. C. A., in a talk before the Cosmo
politan Club last night.
Vail was in Russia 18 months doing
•relief work in the district southeast
•of Moscow. "Under the new economic
'policy,", he said, "the Moscow people
busy, but poor. The hard times are
jdue* to the drought in 1922, which
'killed all crops. Conditions were only
faggravated by the great ood of the
j Volga river the following winter.
- "A great part of the reconstruction
work consists in restocking the coun
try, as the drought killed almost all
!the animals. There was always pres
ent the necessity for starving one sec
tion in order to feed another. Sanita
tion in the box-like homes of the peas
ants was enforced by threatening to
■cut off the food relief. At the present
the Soviet is supporting the uni
versities, and laborers often go to
college, but their work is entirely prac
tical."
S At the close of the talk the members
were entertained by selections of
Chinese music by some of the Chinese
rstudents. (
