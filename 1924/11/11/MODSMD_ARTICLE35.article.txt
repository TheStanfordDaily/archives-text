# U. C. GRID TRADITION IS SUBJECT OF BOOK
## 
### 
To preserve California tradition and
to present an accurate picture of Cali
fornia's football history, were the mo
tives that prompted "Brick" Morse,
'98, to write "California Football His
tory." "California has the richest store
of traditions of any university in the
West. These traditions are what make |
the University worth while, and should
be preserved for future Californians,"
said "Brick."
"Brick" Morse has made a collection
of the pictures of all of the football
teams and has kept a record of every
game that they have played. He has
compiled this collection of facts and
pictures into a book containing a full
page picture of each team, a complete!
account of every game, and personal
stories about the players.
