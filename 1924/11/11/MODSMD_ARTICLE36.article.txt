# RAM'S HEAD PLOTS DUE IN NINE DAYS
## 
### 
Ram's Head Society has announced
that only nine days remain in which
manuscripts will be received for their
annual show which will be presented
next quarter. The dead line has been
set at November 20. All manuscripts
should be given to Horace Allison, at
the Theta Delta Chi house.
Several plots have already been re
ceived, with subjects ranging from
Timbuctoo's divorce problem, to the
tender love story of an Eskimo pie.
Originality-plus is the requisite in a
Ram's Head show, and everyone has
an equal chance to have his or her
manuscript selected for production.
