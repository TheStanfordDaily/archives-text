# DRIVE FOR JUNIOR CLASS DUES WILL START TOMORROW
## Small White Button With Red "26" Will Be Given To Those Who Pay 
### 
"It is absolutely imperative to the
welfare of the Junior Class that every
member pay his 'or her dues promptly,"
says "Chuck" Stratton, president of
the class of '26, regarding a drive for
dues that will start tomorrow.
"Although Junior Week comes next
sping, the proposed drive will be the
only one of the year, and so the money
must be collected at this time to in
sure the success of Junior Week. The
class finances are at a very low ebb at
the present time, and it will be neces
sary to assess*"®ach member $2."
In order to prevent the certain few
that always neglect to pay their dues
from forgetting or attempting to shirk
their obligation, the committee in
charge of the drive has decided to
give buttons to the students at the
time they pay. The button will be
about three-quarters of an inch in
diameter, white with a red "26" on it.
This is hoped to be a more satisfactory
plan than the refusal of admission to
the Prom.

-1 quested to help the committee by col
lecting in their respective living

"It is absolutely imperative to the
welfare of the Junior Class that every
member pay his 'or her dues promptly,"
says "Chuck" Stratton, president of
the class of '26, regarding a drive for
dues that will start tomorrow.
"Although Junior Week comes next
sping, the proposed drive will be the
only one of the year, and so the money
must be collected at this time to in
sure the success of Junior Week. The
class finances are at a very low ebb at
the present time, and it will be neces
sary to assess*"®ach member $2."
In order to prevent the certain few
that always neglect to pay their dues
from forgetting or attempting to shirk
their obligation, the committee in
charge of the drive has decided to
give buttons to the students at the
time they pay. The button will be
about three-quarters of an inch in
diameter, white with a red "26" on it.
This is hoped to be a more satisfactory
plan than the refusal of admission to
the Prom.

-1 quested to help the committee by col
lecting in their respective living
