# MAXWELL ANDERSON AROUSES CRITICISM BY POST-WAR PLAY
## 
### 
Maxwell Anderson, who received his
master's degree at Stanford in 1914, is
in the center of a storm of literary
j criticism directed at the play, "What
: Price Glory," of which he is co-author
; with Laurence Stallings,
Anderson came here following his
graduation from the University of
I North Dakota in 1911. While at Stan
ford he was assistant in the English
department and a member of the
Round Table Discussion Group con
ducted by Dr. H. D. Gray.
j The play, which is presented as a
cross section of a soldier's life over
seas, has aroused the opposition of
Navy and Army officials on the
grounds that it throws a bad light on
the life of enlisted men. It is feared
j that it will have the effect of prevent
ing enlistments.
Another group of opponents of the
play, who believe that literature has
no right to produce anything vile, base
their arguments on the constant use
of profanity in the dialogue.
A large number of disinterested
1 critics, however, praise the play highly
! and believe that it tells the truth about
the war. They recommend it especially
! for the reality of its situations and
for its "persistent wit."
Anderson collaborated with Avery
Hopwood in writing an earlir play, but
it proved a failure. Adverse criticism
on one hand and extravagant praise on
the other seem to have insured the
financial success of "What Price
Glory." The play is being produced by
Arthur Hopkins in New York.
