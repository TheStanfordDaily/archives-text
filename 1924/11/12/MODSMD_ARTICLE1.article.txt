# "IF LEAGUE FAILS, NOTHING TO STOP FUTURE WAR, "LUTZ
## "Europe—Six Years After Armistice," Subject Of Lecture 
### 
"If the League fails, nothing but
time stands in the way of another war
far more devastating than the last
one," said Professor Ralph H. Lutz, of
the History department, in his lecture
last night on "Europe—Six Years
After the Armistice."
"The signing of the Armistice is
sued in a new epoch. Six years ago the
front was illuminated in celebration
of that signing, when even the Ger
man army sent off star shells."
Many Americans who went across
believed they were going to make the
world safe for democracy, according
to Lutz. Others went with the inten
tion of fighting against the Kaiser,
and still others went to war to end
war.
World Turns to Wilson
"As the struggle drew to a close,
the world turned to the great philos
ophy of President Wilson, in an effort
to find a solution to the problems,
which grew out of the conflict," he
continued. "The heritage of the war
included problems of security, repara
tions, armaments, and the League."
Europe is pictured as a continent
still suffering from the war. There are
bankruptcy and debts, trade has been
destroyed in a measure, and economic
conditions are different. A change of
political ideas has also come about
since 1919. Many constitutions have
failed to work, and there is still a
tendency to tinker with governments.
Poincare Attacked
"People last summer were again
talking about the causes of the World
War," Professor Lutz observed. "At
tacks have been made on Poincare,
blaming him for his policies during
the struggle. In England, also, there is
discussion of policies, and in Germany
there is talk of reconsideration."
Great Britain was described by the
speaker as a splendid example of a
great European government efficiently
maintained. The Labor government
last summer is credited with solving
several problems which helped ma
terially in the reconstruction work.
London is now the scene of tremen
dous business activity and England is
acknowledged to hold the balance of
power.
"France is an agricultural nation of
small farms," explained Professor
Lutz. "She has largely recovered even
in the devastated areas. Crops have
been harvested to pay debts. The most
startling thing is the revival of Paris,
and repairs have been so efficient that
only a few churches show the effects
of the war.
Germans Have Recovered
"The Germans also have seemed to
recover rapidly. Currency has been
stabilized, unemployment has been cut
down, and there is now unusual com
mercial and industrial activity.
"The program of reparations at the
London conference, which is one of the
greatest since Versailles, and the put
ting into effect of the Dawes plan has
been of tremendous importance to
Europe," stated Professor Lutz.
