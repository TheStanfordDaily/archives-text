# BABE-SENIOR GRID GAME TOMORROW IS FINAL CLASS MATCH
## 
### 
Freshman and senior gridders tangle
in the final game of the interclass
! series at 4 p.m. tomorrow on the
I freshman practice field.
While the game has no bearing on
the ehampionship it will'afford an op
s portunity for one of the two teams to
| break into the win column. The babes,
hailed at the first of the season as
probable champs, have failed to live
; up to expectations and have fallen be
fore the juniors and the sophomores.
The fourth-year eleven has a brace of
j scoreless ties to its credit, gained from
! '26 and '27 aggregations.
If any edge exists, it should go to
! "Oz" Osborne's seniors because of
their great advantage in weight. Al
! though a trifle slow and awkward, the
| '2-5 team is beefy enough to stop the
light freshman backfield as easily as
it did the powerful sophomore offen
sive last Tuesday. Blaine at center is
the outstanding figure of the fourtli
; year line.
Captain Jenkins has developed a
light, fast team of '28 men which
i should score against the seniors pro-
I viding it can get around or through
I the forward wall.
