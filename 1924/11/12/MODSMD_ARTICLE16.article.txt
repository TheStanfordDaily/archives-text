# Chaparral Cover Design For Big Game issue Is Work of Famous Artist
## 
### 
Followers of the Old Boy are prom- j
ised a violent but pleasant shock when 1
they see the cover design of Chap
paral's Big Game issue. A new con
cept of the Stanford-California game
has been portrayed in the design by ;
an artist of national repute whose '
name is shrouded in deepest secrecy, j
The cover design will have to do a j
lot of covering, because the best talent j
on the campus has turned in enough j
copy to make an issue of huge propor-1
tions. Six months have been spent in !
gathering the copy for the mammoth !
edition.
The issue has been rushed to be on
sale at the annual tussle, November;
22, as its regular date of publication
is December 1. The Old Boy has re-;
doubled his merry efforts and, accord- j
ing to critics who have seen the |
proofs, it should sell out the first day i
on sale.
