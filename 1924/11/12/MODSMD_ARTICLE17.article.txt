# CARDINAL SOCCER VARSITY DEFEATS CALIFORNIA. 3 TO 1
## Maloney's Squad Upsets Dope With Strong Offensive In Second Half 
### 
Unleashing a powerful attack in the
last half, the Cardinal varsity soccer
eleven came through with a decisive
3 to 1 victory over California yester
day in the first game of the annual
series, played on the Stanford base
ball diamond.
Harry Maloney's charges played
somewhat listlessly during the first
half, holding their opponents to a 1
to 1 tie. In the second period they
stepped out and showed more stuff
than they have at any time this year, I
with the result that the Bears lost,
every bit of ambition they formerly
possessed and contented themselves (
with holding down the score.
The Cards showed a 100 per cent'
improvement over their work in the I
Bank of Italy game last Saturday,!
playing more as a unit and exhibiting :
greater confidence in their own abil-,
ity. Every man put all he had into the;
game, but Don Clark and Captain;
Ralph Howe in the backfield and
Miron, Ta'am, and Schoen in the for
ward line stood out particularly.
Schoen Scores First Goal
More or less of a see-saw struggle
was carried on in the first part of the;
contest, with perhaps a trifle more
than half of the play taking place in
Stanford territory. During this period
Forrest, Card goalkeeper, prevented j
several Blue and Gold scores by* his;
quick action. Then the battle shifted,;
and Art Schoen, inside left, booted j
the ball squarely into the netting for
the first Stanford tally.
Near the end of the half Coach Zam
loch's men rallied and knotted the
count on a kick of Hornstein, center
forward, after blocking and placing a ;
throw-in of Franklin, Redshirt left
half. They had several other good
chances to add to their total, but were
foiled by the strong defense of the
Card back fie Id.
Second Half Stanford's
With the start of the second period
Maloney's men threw their machine
into high gear and proceeded to keep
the battle mainly in California terri
tory. Ta'am, center forward, lost little
time in sending his team into the lead
with a cleanly-shot goal. The Chinese
starred throughout the game with his
heady rushes and carefully-calculated
placements.
Cardoza, who went in at inside left
when Art Schoen developed an acute
attack of "charley horse," scored the
final point near the end of the game.
Don Clark repelled the few feeble at
tacks of the Blue and Gold in easy
style.
