# There's a Rally
## 
### 
Tomorrow evening there will be another opportunity to perfect our
knowledge of songs and yells, and to prove to the football varsity that we
remember it throughout the week, and not just on Saturday afternoons.
Rallies so far have been semi-exclusive affairs, with attendance con
fined to those admirable individuals who regard the team and its success
as the one shining star in the firmament. Tomorrow's affair should bring
out all -Stanford men and women who are interested in Stanford. And
also their friends, even if towed along on the rear end of a rope. For
there are still those who so love the "Song Without Words that they
attempt to adapt the title to every tune on the Stanford list.
It may be distinctive and individual to "moo" the words of a song or
a yell, but it is more individual to think so. Vocal accomplishments of a
rooting section should be sharp, snappy, and clean-cut. It is expected,
and also effective. Searching the memory for the words involves a dis
tinct slowing-up of the action, and before long the band is away out in
front and a cinch to win, hands down.
Practice these songs whenever the chance comes to you—come out to
rallies and get synchronized with the other 2900-odd, and get yourself
and your influence into the good fight the football team is making.
