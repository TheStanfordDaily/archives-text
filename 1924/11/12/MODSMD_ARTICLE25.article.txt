# In the Whirl

### 
The time for leisure, interesting books, and the pleasant companion
ship of friends; the time to stroll off the hill in the early dusk and a few
moments to notice the changing moods of the Valley, are yours, if you
have not followed the leader and jumped into the whirl of college activi
ties, sacrificing the greatest part of time youth to councils, meetings, com
mittees, play castes, movements and drives.
The student who rushes from one activity to another, his mind com
pletely occupied with his load of responsibility and duty will certainly miss
worthwhile lectures and plays. He can't have time to really enjoy a
library, rich in knowledge one never obtains simply from required read
ings.
The plea of "never have time" accounts for the student's deplorable
lack of knowledge of what is going on in the world outside. Of course
students don't have time to read magazines or periodicals. They are doing
well if they have the opportunity to skim over the lesson for the morrow.
It is a wonder that more students don't break down with the nervous
strain of too much to do, too many things to occupy a mind already filled
with details of curricular worries and the business of living.
When a student is graduated from a university he should leave it feel
ing the challenge to use in the best way possible, learning acquired while
in college, but the senior in most institutions is so wearied from the strain
of four years of over-work, that he looks forward with joy to the possi
bilities of a rest cure.â€”University Daily Kansan.
Here we have the ever-increasing problem, as seen at the University of
Kansas. It seems a rather notable omission that the vastly probable good
issuing from these student-body activities is entirely ignored, but the main
point of the argument remains intact. There is, perhaps, too much go
ing on.
Life, in all respects, is increasing in complexity, and university life is
no exception to the general rule! The argument has been advanced, along
political lines particularly, that student life is a sufficiently large order
for the student, and that he should not confuse and over-burden himself
by taking too thorough an interest in national and international life. In
view of the fact that a college educaion is of no value except as a lever to
pry the most out of life, this plea for insulation is fallacious. Unless the
undergraduate can accumulate a sound foundation of fact together with
his "book learning," he will be as completely at sea in late life as he
would have been if he had never gone to college.
Perhaps these undergraduate activities provide this foundation of
fact. Certainly they yield large dividends in the matter of brushing up
against other people, and hammering into the individual a code of rules
and a certain amount of "savoir faire." If, however, they leave no time
for gentlemanly and genial with its resultant companionships and
associations, they are l>eing carried too far. One cannot attain polish and
culture under full steam.
