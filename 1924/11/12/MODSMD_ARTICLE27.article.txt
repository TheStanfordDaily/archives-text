I've searched through movie maga
zines—
Each month I buy them by the score,
.Because I want to know the queens,
About their lives, their loveß and more.
But 1 can't find —my search goeß far —
Where movie beauties' fathers are.
They're photographed with mamma
dear,
They write in reams about their homes.
They have their fads, they'll have you
hear,
Collecting things from coins to combs.
One thing publicity men bar —
Where movie beauties' fathers are!

Albert Trauss, the star reporter,
sprained his 1 ankle reporting the new
record made by Mr. West, of the Water
Tower, yesterday, when Mr. West suc
ceeded in getting a volume from the
library in 15:29.7. In rushing to the
Daily office with the story, Albert
piled up on a banana peel.
"It is just another case of the re
sults of an unbeautiful thought," says
Rah Singh, the Bahai seer. "Although
many physicians would say that un
regulated diet was the cause of the ail
ment, since there would have been no
symptom if a stomach had not been
put out of order by the injurious
banana, it is obvious to all true be
lievers that if our esthetic principles
were universal, the unlovely fruit
would be adlebahr vasgo bahai and so
irrelevant. Is that clear? Therefore,
ergo."
All of which has affected neither
Mr. West's record nor Albert's ankle,
i but it is no doubt very, very important
I to science.
