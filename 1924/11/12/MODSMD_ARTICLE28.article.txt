Remember once we ran away, dear
Sue,
From classes, books, and everything—
we two —
And for a day we had our wilderness,
The bread, the wine—and Romance
had its due?
You led our truant frolics with a laugh
Of gusty, trembling cadence that was
half
Like swift-blown shadows on the mea
dow grass—
To coax, and not in duty's dull behalf.
Remember, Sue, the other days we
spent
Exploring our Domains of Accident?
I wonder, do you go there any more
To wish beneath our tree so oddly
bent? —H. R.

While your observations to the ef
fect that our gals are Amazons may
be quite true, D. T. R., it would never
do to print your epic and run the risk
of having them amazoning around the
office. However true your metric re
marks may be, let it be repeated, they
are by no means exhaustive for you
never mentioned the heinous habit of
one co-ed who mixes trochees with
iambics. And that is why yours didn't
get printed, Dusty Dodo. Count the
beats, friends; count the beats.
