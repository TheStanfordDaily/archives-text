# Wallace Denny Shows Futility In Making Bets
## 
### 
Wallace Denny, veteran trainer of
several generations of Stanford ath
letes, swears that betting is all wrong,
especially on the part of a college
student. To prove his point Denny
makes what he terms "educational
bets" with those who don't agree with
him on the outcome of an athletic
combat, and to date he has showed an
uncanny ability to pick the winners.
Unusual Payment
The bets very seldom carry any
monetary consideration but usually
the loser is forced to do something
unusual. For example: one Stanford
baseball player had implicit faith in
the fact that U. S. C. would beat Cali
fornia. Along with his disillusionment
and enlightenment, it is now necessary
for him to stop three paces in front
of Denny, whenever he should chance
to meet him, and mark time for a
brief period. The unfortunate one then
marches three paces behind him and
repeats the performance; but by far
the worst part of his payment is that
if said unfortunate is accompanied by
a young lady she too rnugt go through
the ritual.
Probably the worst part of any
wager made with Denny is the speech
that the loser receives on the pay
ment. It usually runs in this manner:
"My boy, take the advice of an older
man and quit betting. It hurts me
worse than it does you to see you bet
and lose, but you must learn that it
is all wrong. I have been watching
sports a long time and have never seen
anybody come out ahead of the bet
ting game."
s yet this year Denny has made only
one mistake and that was betting on
the Giants to win the world series, j
When questioned regarding this the j
chief gives out the following state-'
ment: "Ugh!"
