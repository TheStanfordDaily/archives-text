# Casket-Like Stone Tells Story of Ancient Ruins
## 
### 
A large piece of stone resembling a
casket has reclined for eighteen years
on the big field between Encina and
Palm Drive.
Since this is the field where the
Golden Bear is annually burned and
buried, it might be thought that the
casket-like stone, heavy enough to in
sure eternal sleep to anyone, has
something to do with the rites. Not so.
It was the cornerstone of the first
library, destroyed by the earthquake
in 1906, when it was nearly completed
but had never been used. There are
other stones from that library littered
about the field, where they provide a
happy playground for the chipmunks
until some use is found for them and
they are carried away.
When the present library was built,
the need for proximity to the Quad
was recognized, and the old site aban
doned.
