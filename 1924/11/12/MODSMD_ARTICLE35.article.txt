# New System at Roble Results in Board Reduction
## 
### 
Under the new student administra
tion of the dining room at Roble man
aged by Miss Lilian Otto, $10 has
been deducted from board.
The new system is similar to that of
Encina and other halls. Student ad
ministration is vested in the Commit
tee of Five, while all the women are
enabled to take part by means of a
request box for the reception of criti
cisms and suggestions. Miss Otto re
presents Miss Etta Handy, supervisor
of the halls.
The $10 deduction resulted from
countings the actual days of college in
board payment, instead of the days
from one registration day to the next,
as before.
