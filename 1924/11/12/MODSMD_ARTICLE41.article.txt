# RADIO STATION 6XBM HAS ROLE IN COAST AIR COMMUNICATION
## 
### 
The Stanford radio station, 6XBM,
situated in the high-voltage laboratory,
is playing an important role in Pacific
coast wireless communication circles.
Through the Bureau of Standards of
the Department of Commerce at Wash
ington, transmitting equipment and
standards have been installed here for
broadcasting special signals of stand
ard frequencies.
These signals, transmitted several
times a month at definite times, are of
use in testing laboratories, transmit
ting station operators and others in
adjusting transmitting and receiving
apparatus and standardizing wave
meters.
Only Western Station
As the Stanford station is the only
one in existence besides station MWV
of the Bureau of Standards it has the
responsibility of duplicating in the
West the service rendered by the
Washington station in the East.
The frequencies included in past
transmissions have been from 125 to
2000 kilocycles (150 to 2400 meters).
In order to make the transmissions of
still greater service, they will be ex
tended to include frequencies up to
6000 kilocycles. The accuracy of the
values of these signals is better than
three-tenths of one per cent.
All transmissions are by unmodu
lated, continuous-wave telegraphy. A
complete frequency transmission in
cludes a "general call." a "standard
frequency signal," and "announce
ments." Then there is a four-minute
interval while the transmitting set is
adjusted for the next frequency.
Broadcasting November 20
The next broadcasting of these sig
nals is scheduled for November 20
from 10 to 11:30 p.m.
The Stanford station is also en
gaged in fostering a movement for
inter-campus wireless communication.
According to a form-letter that has
been sent to a number of American
universities by the radio department
under the supervision of Professor H.
H. Henline.*of the Department of Elec
trical Engineering, telegraphic inter
communication would establish closer
relations among universities, would
advance instruction and research and
provide opportunities for the practical
development of radio transmission.
The 230-235 kilocycle band has been
assigned by the Department of Com
merce to educational institutions for
purposes of communication. If the uni
versities use this band to any consider
able extent it will be reserved entirely
for them. That is, no other class of
stations will be allowed to operate in
these wave lengths retained for educa
tional institutions. Therefore, interfer
ence would be reduced to a minimum.
If other universities co-operate with
the Stanford station in this plan and
serve as relay stations it will be pos
sible to establish telegraphic com
munication among institutions from
coast to coast.
The Magnavox which was used to
announce election returns ,will be put
to use whenever anything Interesting
is "on Me ether." Students may come'
to the high-voltage laboratory at these
times, which will be announced be
forehand, and listen to whatever enter
tainment is being offered.

these wave lengths retained for educa
tional institutions. Therefore, interfer
ence would be reduced to a minimum.
If other universities co-operate with
the Stanford station in this plan and
serve as relay stations it will be pos
sible to establish telegraphic com
munication among institutions from
coast to coast.
The Magnavox which was used to
announce election returns ,will be put
to use whenever anything Interesting
is "on Me ether." Students may come'
to the high-voltage laboratory at these
times, which will be announced be

The Stanford radio station, 6XBM,
situated in the high-voltage laboratory,
is playing an important role in Pacific
coast wireless communication circles.
Through the Bureau of Standards of
the Department of Commerce at Wash
ington, transmitting equipment and
standards have been installed here for
broadcasting special signals of stand
ard frequencies.
These signals, transmitted several
times a month at definite times, are of
use in testing laboratories, transmit
ting station operators and others in
adjusting transmitting and receiving
apparatus and standardizing wave
meters.
Only Western Station
As the Stanford station is the only
one in existence besides station MWV
of the Bureau of Standards it has the
responsibility of duplicating in the
West the service rendered by the
Washington station in the East.
The frequencies included in past
transmissions have been from 125 to
2000 kilocycles (150 to 2400 meters).
In order to make the transmissions of
still greater service, they will be ex
tended to include frequencies up to
6000 kilocycles. The accuracy of the
values of these signals is better than
three-tenths of one per cent.
All transmissions are by unmodu
lated, continuous-wave telegraphy. A
complete frequency transmission in
cludes a "general call." a "standard
frequency signal," and "announce
ments." Then there is a four-minute
interval while the transmitting set is
adjusted for the next frequency.
Broadcasting November 20
The next broadcasting of these sig
nals is scheduled for November 20
from 10 to 11:30 p.m.
The Stanford station is also en
gaged in fostering a movement for
inter-campus wireless communication.
According to a form-letter that has
been sent to a number of American
universities by the radio department
under the supervision of Professor H.
H. Henline.*of the Department of Elec
trical Engineering, telegraphic inter
communication would establish closer
relations among universities, would
advance instruction and research and
provide opportunities for the practical
development of radio transmission.
The 230-235 kilocycle band has been
assigned by the Department of Com
merce to educational institutions for
purposes of communication. If the uni
versities use this band to any consider
able extent it will be reserved entirely
for them. That is, no other class of
stations will be allowed to operate in
these wave lengths retained for educa
tional institutions. Therefore, interfer
ence would be reduced to a minimum.
