# BONFIRE BEGINS TO ASSUME SHAPE AT HANDS OF WORKERS
## Height of Almost 25 Feet Attained by Freshman Builders 
### 
111 two days' labor the freshmen
have raised the great pile of wood
for the Big Bonfire to a point twenty
five feet above terra firma, Gangs of
fifty or sixty members of '28 have
been at work on the structure for the
past two afternoons while patrols of
freshmen have been scouring the
country-side for wood and other com
bustibles.
Telephone posts have been planted
in the ground at the four corners of
a square 30 by 30 feet and cross-trees
of five-inch timber have been nailed
to these, forming an enormous basket
in which has been piled barrels, boxes,
brush, paper, anything that wilt burn,
and some things that won't.
Wood Is Collected
Fraternity and sorority houses have
been visited for their contributions of
wood and a round is being made of
homes in Palo Alto. Any contributions
for the bonfire will be welcomed by
the committee in charge-of gathering
the faggots, whicU is headed by Lynn
"Hosom at 244 Encina hall.
If work on the structure progresses
at the present rate, guard duty will be
begun soon to, protect the Big Bonfire
from premature cremation at the
hands of Interested Blue and Gold
fans. However, it is almost certain
that the speed of the construction job
will slow down as wood becomes more
and more scarce. ,
Twenty-Three Hours Required
An elaborate system of time-keeping
for the laboring freshmen has been
installed so that accurate check may
be kept to see that every freshman
puts in the fifteen hours of work and
eight hours of guard duty which is re
quired. Failure on the part of a fresh
man to put in the twenty-three hours
of time will result, according to ru
mor, in a grand paddling fest in which
the delinquent will be the center of
attraction.
The head contractors and schemers
for the bonfire are Jams Sapero, presi
dent of the freshman class, and Lee
Bering. Various "bosses" have been
appointed to direct the efforts of the
gangs of ambitious freshmen.

be kept to see that every freshman
puts in the fifteen hours of work and
eight hours of guard duty which is re
quired. Failure on the part of a fresh
man to put in the twenty-three hours
of time will result, according to ru
mor, in a grand paddling fest in which
the delinquent will be the center of
attraction.
The head contractors and schemers
for the bonfire are Jams Sapero, presi
dent of the freshman class, and Lee
Bering. Various "bosses" have been
appointed to direct the efforts of the
gangs of ambitious freshmen.
