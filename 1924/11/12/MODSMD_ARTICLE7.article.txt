# Injurious Beetle Attacks Evergreen in Arboretum
## 
### 
Owing to the severe drought, many
Monterey pine and cypress trees on
the campus have become weakened
and are an easy prey of a destructive
bark beetle. A recent survey of the
campus made by Professor Doane's
class in forest entomology has shown
that a number of the pines have be
come infested beyond hope of their
recovering. As these trees only serve
as a breeding place for thousands of
beetles that might attack stronger
trees, it has been recommended that
these trees be cut out and destroyed.
The less seriously infected trees will
be treated in an endeavor to save them
if possible.
The Toyon trees, many of which
are seriously injured by an inconspicu
ous scale insect that is abundant in
the trunk and branches, will be thor
oughly pruned and sprayed with an
oil emulsion that will kill the scale
insects. It is hoped that in this way
most of these berry trees and bushes
may be saved.
