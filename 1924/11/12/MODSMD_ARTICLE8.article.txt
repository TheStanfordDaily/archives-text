# WARNER BUSY PUTTING FINAL TOUCHES ON VARSITY ELEVEN
## Cardinals Developing Fast Passing Game During Secret Practice; Bill Neill Slightly Injured 
### 
DRIVING his team through three hours of strenuous practice nightly,
"Pop" Warner is hard at work putting the Stanford varsity into shape
for its clash with the University of Montana, the final hurdle to be
taken by the Cards before they meet the Golden Bears November 22 in the
California Mmorial Stadium at Berkeley.
Secret practice will be the order of the day for the rest of the season.
Behind the closed gates "Pop" is putting finishing touches on the new system
of play he came west to install, and from the way the first squad has been
showing up in those secret sessions his journey has not been in vain. Already
his powerful backfield has proved its offensive strength and now the Redshirts
are displaying a whirlwind forward-passing attack which will take all Andy
Smith's ingenuity to stop.
Warner has shown himself to be a master of the aerial game and when the
Big Game rolla around the Cards can be relied upon to show a lot of stuff
along this line never before seen on this coast. Last year the screen pass
proved to be a big ground-gainer and this season the basketball toss has given
the fans something tt> talk about, but it is more than likely that against
California these previous efforts will be entirely eclipsed.
In Lawson and Shipkey the Stanford mentor has two of the best receivers
in the Conference. During his high school career the former made a great

for himself by the way he used
i to pick the ball out of the air for long
gains. Until the last two weeks Law
son hardly had a chance to show his
wares along this line on a college
gridiron, but from now on his work
in this department should equal his
wonderful work on the defense and
in running interference. Shipkey dis
played his ability in the passing game
against Utah and the way Ted pulls
down the leather and runs through the
secondary defense makes him a fit
running mate for the Cardinal captain.
With these two bearcats on the
wings and a bunch of classy passers
and receivers in the backfield Stanford
should develop during the next tpn
days a passing attack unequaled on the
coast. The varsity pulled some mighty
clever stunts of this variety against
the Mormons last week but in doing
so they uncovered none of the tricks
they are saving up for the Bruins, and
it is a cinch that unless the many
weary hours "Pop" has spent teaching
the boys their stuff goes for naught a
number of skeptical parties are going
to get the surprise of their lives when
they see the Cards open up.
Meanwhile Tiny Thornhill has the
victorious freshman team off in an
other corner of the lot drilling them in
the plays used by the Bears. It has
often been said that Warner-coached j
teams are weak defensively, but if
that bunch of first-year whirlwinds are j
once turned loose on the first-string
men the latter can scarcely help learn
ing a lot about the art of stopping ;
their opponents. If the varsity can
smear up this year's freshmen, using \
Smith plays, it can go a long way!
toward stopping any varsity in this |
section of the land.
Bill Neill Bumped
Only one black spot came yesterday !
to darken the otherwise sunny sky and j
that was the injury of Bill Neill, regu
lar guard. Neill was carried off the
field with a wrenched knee and, al
though he appeared to be in bad
shape, he reemed to recover when
brought into the gymnasium. Coach
Kerr said today that nothing serious
[ could be found, and that Neill seemed
unlikely even to miss a practice.
Counteracting the accident to Neill
was the work of Ernie Nevers, who
set off a lot of fireworks. The big full
back evidently took to heart some of
the mean things that were said about
j him following the Utah game and he
j ran, bucked, kicked, passed, and
I tackled in a way most pleasing to the
i eye. In spite of the plaintive bleating
of certain critics Nevers is the best
| backfield man on the coast today and,
judging by his actions on the practice
| field yesterday, he will prove the fact
j to the satisfaction of all those Inter
i ested within the next two weeks.
It is still a question as to whether |
Solomon or Mitchell will start at quar
> Ler against Montana. The former is a j
i better all-around man but Mitchell
j showed himself to be a first-class sig
i nal caller against Utah and his ability
as a field general may give him the
i call. By his great work Saturday Pea
body Cleaveland • installed himself as
a fixture at halfback and from now on
he can always be looked for when the
opening whistle blows. The other half
back berth is still open to some ques
j tion and, while Cuddeback seems to be
the leading candidate, it is possible
| that either Kelly or Garthwaite may
beat him out.

judging by his actions on the practice

j to the satisfaction of all those Inter
i ested within the next two weeks.
It is still a question as to whether |
Solomon or Mitchell will start at quar
> Ler against Montana. The former is a j
i better all-around man but Mitchell
j showed himself to be a first-class sig
i nal caller against Utah and his ability
as a field general may give him the
i call. By his great work Saturday Pea
body Cleaveland • installed himself as
a fixture at halfback and from now on
he can always be looked for when the
opening whistle blows. The other half
back berth is still open to some ques

the leading candidate, it is possible

DRIVING his team through three hours of strenuous practice nightly,
"Pop" Warner is hard at work putting the Stanford varsity into shape
for its clash with the University of Montana, the final hurdle to be
taken by the Cards before they meet the Golden Bears November 22 in the
California Mmorial Stadium at Berkeley.
Secret practice will be the order of the day for the rest of the season.
Behind the closed gates "Pop" is putting finishing touches on the new system
of play he came west to install, and from the way the first squad has been
showing up in those secret sessions his journey has not been in vain. Already
his powerful backfield has proved its offensive strength and now the Redshirts
are displaying a whirlwind forward-passing attack which will take all Andy
Smith's ingenuity to stop.
Warner has shown himself to be a master of the aerial game and when the
Big Game rolla around the Cards can be relied upon to show a lot of stuff
along this line never before seen on this coast. Last year the screen pass
proved to be a big ground-gainer and this season the basketball toss has given
the fans something tt> talk about, but it is more than likely that against
California these previous efforts will be entirely eclipsed.
In Lawson and Shipkey the Stanford mentor has two of the best receivers
in the Conference. During his high school career the former made a great

for himself by the way he used
i to pick the ball out of the air for long
gains. Until the last two weeks Law
son hardly had a chance to show his
wares along this line on a college
gridiron, but from now on his work
in this department should equal his
wonderful work on the defense and
in running interference. Shipkey dis
played his ability in the passing game
against Utah and the way Ted pulls
down the leather and runs through the
secondary defense makes him a fit
running mate for the Cardinal captain.
With these two bearcats on the
wings and a bunch of classy passers
and receivers in the backfield Stanford
should develop during the next tpn
days a passing attack unequaled on the
coast. The varsity pulled some mighty
clever stunts of this variety against
the Mormons last week but in doing
so they uncovered none of the tricks
they are saving up for the Bruins, and
it is a cinch that unless the many
weary hours "Pop" has spent teaching
the boys their stuff goes for naught a
number of skeptical parties are going
to get the surprise of their lives when
they see the Cards open up.
Meanwhile Tiny Thornhill has the
victorious freshman team off in an
other corner of the lot drilling them in
the plays used by the Bears. It has
often been said that Warner-coached j
teams are weak defensively, but if
that bunch of first-year whirlwinds are j
once turned loose on the first-string
men the latter can scarcely help learn
ing a lot about the art of stopping ;
their opponents. If the varsity can
smear up this year's freshmen, using \
Smith plays, it can go a long way!

Bill Neill Bumped
Only one black spot came yesterday !
to darken the otherwise sunny sky and j
that was the injury of Bill Neill, regu
lar guard. Neill was carried off the
field with a wrenched knee and, al
though he appeared to be in bad
shape, he reemed to recover when
brought into the gymnasium. Coach
Kerr said today that nothing serious
[ could be found, and that Neill seemed
unlikely even to miss a practice.
Counteracting the accident to Neill
was the work of Ernie Nevers, who
set off a lot of fireworks. The big full
back evidently took to heart some of
the mean things that were said about
j him following the Utah game and he
j ran, bucked, kicked, passed, and
I tackled in a way most pleasing to the
i eye. In spite of the plaintive bleating

lar guard. Neill was carried off the
field with a wrenched knee and, al
though he appeared to be in bad
shape, he reemed to recover when
brought into the gymnasium. Coach
Kerr said today that nothing serious
[ could be found, and that Neill seemed
unlikely even to miss a practice.
Counteracting the accident to Neill
was the work of Ernie Nevers, who
set off a lot of fireworks. The big full
back evidently took to heart some of
the mean things that were said about
j him following the Utah game and he
j ran, bucked, kicked, passed, and
I tackled in a way most pleasing to the
i eye. In spite of the plaintive bleating
of certain critics Nevers is the best
| backfield man on the coast today and,
judging by his actions on the practice
| field yesterday, he will prove the fact
j to the satisfaction of all those Inter
i ested within the next two weeks.
It is still a question as to whether |
Solomon or Mitchell will start at quar
> Ler against Montana. The former is a j
i better all-around man but Mitchell
j showed himself to be a first-class sig
i nal caller against Utah and his ability
as a field general may give him the
i call. By his great work Saturday Pea
body Cleaveland • installed himself as
a fixture at halfback and from now on
he can always be looked for when the
opening whistle blows. The other half
back berth is still open to some ques
j tion and, while Cuddeback seems to be
the leading candidate, it is possible
| that either Kelly or Garthwaite may
beat him out.
DRIVING his team through three hours of strenuous practice nightly,
"Pop" Warner is hard at work putting the Stanford varsity into shape
for its clash with the University of Montana, the final hurdle to be
taken by the Cards before they meet the Golden Bears November 22 in the
California Mmorial Stadium at Berkeley.
Secret practice will be the order of the day for the rest of the season.
Behind the closed gates "Pop" is putting finishing touches on the new system
of play he came west to install, and from the way the first squad has been
showing up in those secret sessions his journey has not been in vain. Already
his powerful backfield has proved its offensive strength and now the Redshirts
are displaying a whirlwind forward-passing attack which will take all Andy
Smith's ingenuity to stop.
Warner has shown himself to be a master of the aerial game and when the
Big Game rolla around the Cards can be relied upon to show a lot of stuff
along this line never before seen on this coast. Last year the screen pass
proved to be a big ground-gainer and this season the basketball toss has given
the fans something tt> talk about, but it is more than likely that against
California these previous efforts will be entirely eclipsed.
In Lawson and Shipkey the Stanford mentor has two of the best receivers
in the Conference. During his high school career the former made a great

for himself by the way he used
i to pick the ball out of the air for long
gains. Until the last two weeks Law
son hardly had a chance to show his
wares along this line on a college
gridiron, but from now on his work
in this department should equal his
wonderful work on the defense and
in running interference. Shipkey dis
played his ability in the passing game
against Utah and the way Ted pulls
down the leather and runs through the
secondary defense makes him a fit
running mate for the Cardinal captain.
With these two bearcats on the
wings and a bunch of classy passers
and receivers in the backfield Stanford
should develop during the next tpn
days a passing attack unequaled on the
coast. The varsity pulled some mighty
clever stunts of this variety against
the Mormons last week but in doing
so they uncovered none of the tricks
they are saving up for the Bruins, and
it is a cinch that unless the many
weary hours "Pop" has spent teaching
the boys their stuff goes for naught a
number of skeptical parties are going
to get the surprise of their lives when
they see the Cards open up.
Meanwhile Tiny Thornhill has the
victorious freshman team off in an
other corner of the lot drilling them in
the plays used by the Bears. It has
often been said that Warner-coached j
teams are weak defensively, but if
that bunch of first-year whirlwinds are j
once turned loose on the first-string
men the latter can scarcely help learn
ing a lot about the art of stopping ;
their opponents. If the varsity can
smear up this year's freshmen, using \
Smith plays, it can go a long way!
toward stopping any varsity in this |
section of the land.
