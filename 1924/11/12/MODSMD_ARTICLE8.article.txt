# WARNER BUSY PUTTING FINAL TOUCHES ON VARSITY ELEVEN
## Cardinals Developing Fast Passing Game During Secret Practice; Bill Neill Slightly Injured 
### 
DRIVING his team through three hours of strenuous practice nightly,
"Pop" Warner is hard at work putting the Stanford varsity into shape
for its clash with the University of Montana, the final hurdle to be
taken by the Cards before they meet the Golden Bears November 22 in the
California Mmorial Stadium at Berkeley.
Secret practice will be the order of the day for the rest of the season.
Behind the closed gates "Pop" is putting finishing touches on the new system
of play he came west to install, and from the way the first squad has been
showing up in those secret sessions his journey has not been in vain. Already
his powerful backfield has proved its offensive strength and now the Redshirts
are displaying a whirlwind forward-passing attack which will take all Andy
Smith's ingenuity to stop.
Warner has shown himself to be a master of the aerial game and when the
Big Game rolla around the Cards can be relied upon to show a lot of stuff
along this line never before seen on this coast. Last year the screen pass
proved to be a big ground-gainer and this season the basketball toss has given
the fans something tt> talk about, but it is more than likely that against
California these previous efforts will be entirely eclipsed.
In Lawson and Shipkey the Stanford mentor has two of the best receivers
in the Conference. During his high school career the former made a great

for himself by the way he used
i to pick the ball out of the air for long
gains. Until the last two weeks Law
son hardly had a chance to show his
wares along this line on a college
gridiron, but from now on his work
in this department should equal his
wonderful work on the defense and
in running interference. Shipkey dis
played his ability in the passing game
against Utah and the way Ted pulls
down the leather and runs through the
secondary defense makes him a fit
running mate for the Cardinal captain.
With these two bearcats on the
wings and a bunch of classy passers
