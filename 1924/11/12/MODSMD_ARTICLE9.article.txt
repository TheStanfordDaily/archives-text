# TICKET SALE FOR "R. U. R." FRIDAY IS LARGEST RECORDED
## 
### 
The ticket sale for "R. U. R.," which
was held yesterday in the Administra
tion building, exceeded all previous
sales in the-number of tickets sold.
The reduced prices brought the total
amount down somewhat, but the sale
was the largest ever held.
The program for "R. U. R." will be
an innovation for the campus. Delmer
Daves, the dramatic manager, has- an
nounced that the program will contain
eight full pages, printed on ravel edge
white paper with a cover of French
gray. A picture of one of the "robots,"
in vermillion and black will be the
art creation of the program. "What
the Queener Will Wear" promises to
be the most interesting feature, as it
has been compiled by a prominent
Stanford student who has "ruffed" all
the campus dances this year.
While the waits between acts will
be cut down to almost nothing under
the new system of handling the stage
crews, the restless theatregoer can
while away idle moments glancing
over the interesting articles in the
new style program.
Branner hall has been chosen as the
scene of the cast dance because Gor
don Davis and Sword and Sandals So
ciety feel that the stirring melodra
matic ending to the play will leave
the audience in a fever of excitement,
and a short walk will be necessary
before dancing.
A few good seats still remain for
"R. U. R.," and they will be on sale
at the Alumni Secretary's office in
the Administration building the rest of
(he week.
