# MONTANA GRIZZLY FACES BURIAL BY ROOTERS TONIGHT
## Band Will Lead Procession Down Row to Pavilion At 7 O'Clock 
### 
Headed by "Dutch" McCallister,
Stanford rooters will take the pavilion
by storm at 7:15 tonight and bury
the Montana grizzly under an ava
lanche of Cardinal songs and yells.
The effectiveness of the burial will
dupend largely on the support which
the tow-headed grave-digger receives
from the army of pallbearers. Each
empty seat will count heavily toward
the grizzly's chances of escape.
Starting at 7 o'clock, the band will
march down from the top of the row,
gathering supporters from the frater
nity houses as it goes. Delegations
from all the halls are expected to exe
cute a flank movement and fall in at
the rear of the procession as it ap
proaches the Beta house. The united
army will then proceed to the pavilion.
Aside from a statement that a first
class orchestra will be on hand and
that men well known on the campus
will make short talks, the rally com
mittee has kept the nature of the
program shrouded in secrecy. It is
hinted, however, that several entirely
original and entertaining features will
be sandwiched in between yells. The
noise-making ceremonies will not last
more than an hour.
"Les" Peter is desirous that the
freshmen especially trurn out 100 per
cent strong in order that they may
become thoroughly familiar with the
songs and rah-rah formulas before the
Big Game. He will also give detailed
instructions f&r the work to be done
by the rooting section Saturday.
