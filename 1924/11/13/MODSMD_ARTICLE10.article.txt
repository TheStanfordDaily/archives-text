# CAMPUS GUIDES MUST BE READY TO ANSWER QUERIES OF ALL KINDS
## Odd Impressions Of University Held By Visitors Corrected By Students 
### Herbert Klein 
ttVOUNG fellow, can you tell me tfliere the campus is?" a rustic-looking
* visitor asked one of the student-guides stationed at the front entrance to
the Quad. Fortunately the stranger could be assured that he was even then in
the midst of it. Such as this is part of the day's work for the students whose

duty it is to explain the features of tlu<
University to visitors.
Tho queries most frequent are:
"How many students do you have?"
"Is this a denominational college?" "Is
it true that there are two or three
million dollars' worth of gold in the
chapel?" "Where is the place where
Leland Stanford Junior's toys are
k<jpt?"
During the busiest time of the year
two or three hundred sightseers visit
the campus each day. At this time
there are eighty or ninety each week
day and many more on Saturday
ular times.
Natural Beauty Noted
The feature that makes the greatest
impression on most is the beauty of
the campus. Cornell is the only other
college that many consider to compare
with this in natural beauty and practi

tally everyone gives the palm to Stan
ford. "Berkeley wag never like this!"
and similar ejaculations are constantly
heard along with enthusiastic com
ments on the way the grounds are
kept.
Something else, however, struck a
college president, a visitor from the
Middle West, most forcibly. Seeing
a corduroy-clad upperclassman walking
along the campus he decided it was
the janitor, but as another and still
another appeared, all wearing cords,
the surprised visitor was forced to the
conclusion that Stanford was holding
a janitors' convention.
Guides Stationed at Church
The Memorial Church has the great
est attraction for the visitor and it is
there that the men, acting as guides,
do most of. their explaining. For a
â€¢email foe tliey take a party through
the church and give them its history;
telling about the stained-glass windows
and mosaics. The inscriptions on the
walls interest a great many.
Some startling statements are made
by well-meaning persons seeking to
show their friends about. One said,
"See, there's the altar. Just under it is
where the whole Stanford family is
buried." Another came forth with the
extraordinary fact that the two bronze
tablets by the Memorial Arch, in mem
ory of Robert Pelissier and James
Ferguson, marked the places in the
walls where the two were buried.
Most of the visitors will confide
some hard-luck story to their guide,
about "the young fellow they knew
who went here, but he flunked out,"
or a nephew of theirs that "would like
to get in here, Bnd what you would
suggest confidentially."
Pride Taken in University
One and all seem to be proud of
any connection, however distant, with
the early history of the University and
impressively state, "My cousin knew
one of the carpenters who helped
build The church," aunt saw
the ground before the University was
here." The best, however, was the wo
man who, on her first visit here, when
asked if she wished a guide to explain
the church to her, indignantly replied,
"A guide? I should say not! Why, I
saw Leland Stanford when he was
governor!"
