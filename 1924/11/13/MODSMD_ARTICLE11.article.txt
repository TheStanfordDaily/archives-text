## 
### 
The management of "R. U. R."
wishes to stop the rumors that have
i been going around the campus in re
; gartl to the "robots" who tppear in
I the play. Evwy one of these young
men is a bona tide college student, en
| rolled for regular university work, and
| none of them are ex-members of the
! Palo Alto police force.
The robots are an integral part of
I the play, and their selection was a
| matter of great concern to the casting
director and Sword and Sandals So
| eiety, and any statements derogatory
| of ttyem are exceedingly unwarranted.
Charles Parks, a member of Sword
i and Sandals and one of the
! leading actors in "R. U. R.," has made
j the following statement in regard to
; the robots: "1 was indeed surprised,
nay, almost astounded, when these
base reports came to my ears. It is
[ certainly an injustice to these hard
working, well-meahing boys, who have
given their all that the show may be a
j success.
"I will admit that the robots are sup"-
posed to be mechanical men, who have
no feeling or sense, but it is base
! slander to claim that we made our
final selection of these important char
acters with regard to their 'bawl-out'
records. I, myself, would be willing to
be a robot, if I could get no other part
in this wonderful production."
Sword and Sandals Society has of
fered a reward of two and one-half
kopeks for information leading to the
apprehension of' anyone still circulat
ing these reports.
