# FROSH DEFEATED BY SENIORS 7-0; SOPHS HOLD JUNIORS 0-0
## 27 Backs Fumble Near Goal; 1925 Plays Good Game In Beating Babes 
### 
While the 1025 interclass football I
team, led by "Nip" McHose, was de
feating its freshman opponents 7 to 0,
the junior and sophomore elevents bat
tled to a scoreless tie yesterday after
noon on the Encina Gym practice field.
The result of these games put the
sophomore, junior, and senior elevens
in a three-cornered tie for the inter
class championship and made neces
sary a play-off to determine this year's I
pennant winner.
Fumbles at critical moments robbed
the sophomores of what should have
been a victory in their contest with
the third-year men. On three separate
occasions, the '27 backs carried the'
ball down within striking distance of
their rival's goal line and on as many I
occasions they muffed the ball, letting;
it fall into the hands of an over-watcli-!
ful junior. From the way the play was i
going only a miracle could have pre-1
vented a score at any of these times 1
had the soph backfield been able to;
keep their clutches on tlie*leather.
Sophomores Have Edge
For practically all of the game the
second-year men showed plainly their !
superiority over their rivals both on |
offense and defense. Smythe, McDou- j
gall, and the rest of the backfield i
showed well at advancing the ball
while the line had little difficulty in
holding the juniors.
The freshman-senior game was an
impromptu affair, having originally
been scheduled for this afternoon.
Seven-minute quarters were played
and, after "Nip" McHose, senior quar
terback, had received a forward pass
from Kennedy and scampered over the
| goal the last-year men contented them
; selves with holding the babes in check,
j Both teams played loose football but
| the seniors showed enough superiority
|to win easily. They had the ball in
frosh territory most of the game and
were never in danger of being scored
on.
The triple tie resulting from yester
day's games makes necessary the
playing of two extra contests. The
seniors will meet the sophomores in
the first of these at 9 o'clock Saturday
morning. The two teams played a tie
in their first encounter so it looks like
1 an even break this time. The winner
of this contest will meet the juniors
j in the final game Tuesday afternoon at
j 4 o'clock.

While the 1025 interclass football I
team, led by "Nip" McHose, was de
feating its freshman opponents 7 to 0,
the junior and sophomore elevents bat
tled to a scoreless tie yesterday after
noon on the Encina Gym practice field.
The result of these games put the
sophomore, junior, and senior elevens
in a three-cornered tie for the inter
class championship and made neces
sary a play-off to determine this year's I
pennant winner.
Fumbles at critical moments robbed
the sophomores of what should have
been a victory in their contest with
the third-year men. On three separate
occasions, the '27 backs carried the'
ball down within striking distance of
their rival's goal line and on as many I
occasions they muffed the ball, letting;
it fall into the hands of an over-watcli-!
ful junior. From the way the play was i
going only a miracle could have pre-1
vented a score at any of these times 1
had the soph backfield been able to;
keep their clutches on tlie*leather.
Sophomores Have Edge
For practically all of the game the
second-year men showed plainly their !
superiority over their rivals both on |
offense and defense. Smythe, McDou- j
gall, and the rest of the backfield i
showed well at advancing the ball
while the line had little difficulty in
holding the juniors.
The freshman-senior game was an
impromptu affair, having originally
been scheduled for this afternoon.
Seven-minute quarters were played
and, after "Nip" McHose, senior quar
terback, had received a forward pass
from Kennedy and scampered over the
| goal the last-year men contented them
; selves with holding the babes in check,
j Both teams played loose football but
| the seniors showed enough superiority
|to win easily. They had the ball in
frosh territory most of the game and
were never in danger of being scored
on.
The triple tie resulting from yester
day's games makes necessary the
playing of two extra contests. The
seniors will meet the sophomores in
the first of these at 9 o'clock Saturday
morning. The two teams played a tie
in their first encounter so it looks like
1 an even break this time. The winner
of this contest will meet the juniors
j in the final game Tuesday afternoon at
j 4 o'clock.
