# MONTANA ON WAY SOUTH TO TACKLE CARDS SATURDAY
## Grizzlies Arrive Tomorrow For Locals' Last Game Before November 22 
### Hugh Hollembeak 
All primed to hold the Stanford var
sity to as low a score as possible, the
University of Montana football eleven
will arrive in San Francisco tomorrow
morning where they will take up quar
ters awaiting their clash with "Pop"
Warner's charges in the stadium Sat
urday afternoon.
No one gives the Grizzlies a chance
to win, but nevertheless their entire
squad is making the trip South with
the purpose of holding the Cards in
check and at the same time pushing
over a score. Whether they will suc
ceed is rather doubtful, for the stuff
the Redshirts showed last week
against Utah proved beyond a doubt
that with the return of Ernie Nevers
to the game Stanford will quickly de
velop one of the most powerful of
fenses on the coast.
As far as scoring goes, the boys
from Missoula have an excellent
chance of carrying out their determin
ation. In every game on their sched
ule, including those with the strong
Washington and Idaho teams, Montana
has succeeded in shoving over a touch
down. They will be out to maintain
this record Saturday and unless the
Cardinal team keeps on its toes every
minute chances are they will accom
plish their purpose.
Defense Not Developed
Defensively the Grizzlies have failed
to show a thing this year. Every team
they have met which boasted even a
fair attack has scored and scored
often, and unless the Stanford backs
develop paralysis there seems to be
no reason why they should not do
likewise.
On the other hand, Montana has
demonstrated itself to be a fairly capa
ble scoring machine on several occa
sions. Only last week they ran up
sixty points against Pacific University,
a score larger than the Washington
Huskies made against the same team.
Wilson, a classy halfback, has proved
to be a consistent ground-gainer and
the rest of the Montana backs have
shown ability at carrying the ball.
Together, they should give the Cards
just such a light as the locals need,
one in which the Stanford defense will
be put to a real test.
Fortunately for this defense, which
Warner has been working on, the in
jury suffered by Bill Neill Tuesday
afternoon has proved less serious than
was originally supposed. The left
guard's knee was badly wrenched in
scrimmage but it has yielded to treat
ment and he is able to get around on
it in fairly good shape. "Pop" may
keep him out of the game Saturday in
order to give the leg a chance to get
stronger, but Neill should be able to
put up his best game by November 22,
a thing which seemed unlikely when
he was carried off the field.
Varsity in Good Condition
Aside from Neill, the varsity is in
the best condition it has achieved this
year. Thomas seems to be out of it,
but the way Ted Shipkey has come
through leaves little to worry about
concerning the vacancy at left end.
The rest of the regulars are in great
shape and should be ready to put up
their best game against the visitors
day after tomorrow.
Last year, Andy Smith and most of
his first-string players cut their Ne
vada game and came down to see Stan
for play. During their absence the
scrappy Wolf Pack upset all the dope
by holding their supposedly invincible
opponents to a scoreless tie. After that
bitter experience it is hardly likely
that the Bruin varsity will sit in at
the game here Saturday, but even so it
is not probable that Warner will un
cover any of his stuff for the benefit
of the California scouts who will be
out in force.
Ernie Nevers still needs a lot of
work to get him into the best possible
shape for the Big Game. As a result,
it is likely that Stanford will play
much the same type of football as it
did against the Mormons, with Ernie
bucking the line most of the time.
Then one week later the Cards will be
read to take the field in the California
stadium and put on display the rapid
fire offense which the man who made
Carlisle and Pittsburgh famous has
been drilling into them behind the
closed gates of the varsity practice
field.
