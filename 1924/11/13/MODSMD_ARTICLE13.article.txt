# MONTANA ON WAY SOUTH TO TACKLE CARDS SATURDAY
## Grizzlies Arrive Tomorrow For Locals' Last Game Before November 22

All primed to hold the Stanford var

University of Montana football eleven
will arrive in San Francisco tomorrow
morning where they will take up quar

Washington and Idaho teams, Montana
has succeeded in shoving over a touch
down. They will be out to maintain
this record Saturday and unless the
Cardinal team keeps on its toes every
minute chances are they will accom

no reason why they should not do
likewise.
On the other hand, Montana has
demonstrated itself to be a fairly capa
ble scoring machine on several occa
sions. Only last week they ran up
sixty points against Pacific University,
a score larger than the Washington
Huskies made against the same team.
