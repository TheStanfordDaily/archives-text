# Significant Dramatics
## 
### 
Tomorrow evening, Dramatic Coach Gordon Davis will take time out on
the preparations for the sophomore play long enough to hiss a few
remarks from the wings to the cast of 'R. U. R." In short, the campus
will watch another play.
Capeks production has cast its shadow before it in a peculiar way.
The hit o;f the campus last year was the "Radio Robot," and "R. U. R.,"
with its masses of real Robots, will follow along either as a climax or as
an anit-climax—time will tell. Reaction to thoughtful plays here on the
campus cannot., be plotted in advance with total certainty, and perhaps
the real Robots will not be so well received as the fake one. In which
case the Daily would be greatly surprised.
Sword and Sandals Society has done well in selecting this play. Its
scheme And action are significant—the hopeless, lifeless, yet animate
man-machines doing their appointed tasks without question or ambition,
the few who are anxious for the Robot to become a reasoning creature,
and the .ultimate awakening. It will provide further brain-action for
those who claim that the student is merely a high-grade Robot, as well as
for the students upon whom is bestowed this doubtful honor.
There is no longer any doubt that a project under the classification of
dramatics will be worthy of Stanford, and of attendance. And when the
vehicle is as appropriate as "R. U. R." the old reliable good time ought
to be had by all blessed with the reduced admission-charge.
