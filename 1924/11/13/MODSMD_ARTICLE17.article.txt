According to custom, an outline of the Stanford-U. C. agreement on
campus invasion is being published in the Daily at intervals. Time was
when such action was necessary, and must further be enforced to prevent
parties of students, usually led by John Barleycorn and infested with
swarms pf over-grown Hallowe'en bacteria, from penetrating deep into
rival fastnesses and working hasty decorations with paint-pot and brush.
Often tile color-work was the masterpiece of local cigar-store cowboys
not connected with the university which was always blamed, but collegians
probably! did their share.
The student mind is reaching out. It is universally perceived that a
coat of red paint where it ought not to be does not serve to sharpen the
judgment' of the Stanford quarterback, or increase the drive of the
plungers; Nobody comes out especially to observe the prank, and if
people drd they couldn't get into the stadium to watch the game anyhow.
We have come to the point of realizing that such injudicious playfulness
is of no .benefit to anybody, and moreover it usually inspires a vile cold
in the head as a result of exposure ot the chill midnight blast.
It is a' timely warning, and a bit of reminiscence. But we venture to
opinionate that violation of the agreement is in a class with wooden
sidewalks.
