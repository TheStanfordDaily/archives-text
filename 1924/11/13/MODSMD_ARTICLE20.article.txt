# THE

V. G. D.

Perhaps the reason why some people
bow and scrape and have a "hello" for
every person They meet on Quad, and
others scarcely recognize the mem
bers of their own living groups, is the
same one which governs the four
winds, and gives us, God wot, the sal
vation of variety.

Entrance requirements for "the 500"
are high at Stanford, but wouldn't it
be nice if the women could forget it
occasionally? To feel superior to the
men is perfectly legitimate but it is
overdone astonishingly often; and a
little superiority goes a long, long
way.

A senior walking bare-headed down
Quad in one of the recent showers
was heard murmuring to himself,
"Rain makes the flowers and the
trees so pretty; why don't it rain on
me, mamma."
Some things are too deeply philo
sophical for comment.

Perhaps it would be just as well if
men wearing "cords" would not try to
inculcate into said apparel, so early
in the quarter, the latest quality ad
vertised by the Camel Cigarette Com
pany. Some seem to be trying awfully
hard.

Perversenes# is a mob quality every
body has: the perpetual inclination to
do the wrong thing merely because
there is some sort of a law against it;
to want that which is withheld. It is an
interesting quality, a foolish one, and
the sure sign of a mind with little, if
any, objective.

But let us, with a graceful bow and
a pleased murmur, say unto these,
"Such thou must be to me, who must
Like the other foot obliquely run;
Thy firmness makes my circle just,
And me to end where I begun."

"Genius is the ability to take infinite
pains;" why, then, need an actor mur
mur when he is burned?

Ethics are queer; and institutions
are more queer. A man walks calmly
down Quad soothing his mind with a
cigarette. If a woman did it she would
be a member of the University about
an hour longer. Justice reigns; and
the winds of freedom blow.

And still they rush for .. . "tin
pins." Nine-tenths of the people vio
lently "aetiviting" aren't out for the
interest they have in the activity iself.
They are out for the honor, and some
frankly admit they want all the "honor
pins" they can collect.
Calm thought, and perspective
gained, weighed against a greek-letter
pin found wanting! Four years of
spasmodic cramming of text books
does not mean education —this only
comes with leisure, the rarest thing
in America. Perhaps an Oxford is only
produced of experi
ence . . . and has seen bare
ly thirty winters. At any rate leisure
is an unknown quantity to the major
ity of its students.

"As bad times as these . . . have
been reformed, but not by protests.
They have been made glorious . . .
by the men who have kept their heads
and struck with sure self-possession in
the fight. No age (or community) will
take hysterical reform." — Woodrow
Wilson.
