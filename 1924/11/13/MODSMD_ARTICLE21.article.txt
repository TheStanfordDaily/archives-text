# JORDAN TO DISCUSS KINGS HE HAS MET
## 
### 
In his home at 7:30 this evening
Dr. Jordan will tell about the kings he
has met in the course of his travels
around the world.
"I will discuss them as they looked
to me and not as they look to them
selves," said Dr. Jordan. "I am going
to talk about the Kaiser, the king of
Samoa, Mikado of Japan, king of
Greece, Sultan of Turkey, and other i
gentlemen more or less known and
unknown."
When asked how he had met these
personages, he said, "There are lots
of ways of meeting kings; you can
stand on the sidewalk and meet them,
or throw a stone at them and knock
their hats off."
