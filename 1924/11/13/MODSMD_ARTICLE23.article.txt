"Students all over the world are
meeting in order to mass together and
modify the viewpoint of the other, at
the seame time modifying their own,"
said Anna Fitzhugh, Y. W. C. A. presi
dent, at the world fellowship meeting
held in the Roble library last night, in
observance of the World Student
Friendship Week.
Lucile Barker, who was president
of the student movement at the Uni
versity of Alberta, Canada, told of the
conditions of distinct nationality
among the students of Alberta, and
Eleanor Davidson told of English uni
versities.
"At Alberta there were problems of
religious differences which meant that
unless thejjtudent movement was very
broad it would include only a limited
class," explained Miss Barker. "There
fore about four years ago the Student
Christian Movement was organized
apart from the general Y. W. C. A."
Among the differences in Canadian
universities mentioned by Miss Barker
is the attitude taken toward students
who earn their way; such students
earn their money during the summer
and do not do work about the college
and in the living groups, as is con
sidered perfectly natural here.
Speaking of English universities,
Eleanor Davidson pointed out that at
Oxford and Cambridge the women
have separate colleges but meet with
the men in discussion groups, while
in America just the opposite is true.
Class differentiation is important and
workers are looked down on. The stu
dents work hardest during the sum
mer, taking their exes when they re
turn to college.
In Persia, women students are few,
and there is no student movement, ac
cording to Louise Shedd. In Turkey,
however, there is a movement toward
higher education which will undoubt
edly affect Persia. There is also an
agitation for improved marriage and
and divorce laws.
