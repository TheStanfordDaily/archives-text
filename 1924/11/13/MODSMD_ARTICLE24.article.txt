# Former Chaparral Editor Will Be Campus Visitor
## 
### 
Geoffrey Morgan, '20, visited the
campus over the week-end, returning
for the first time since his graduation.
Morgan, who was the editor of Chapar
ral in his senior year, is now a lecturer
on the Redpath Chautauqua circuit.
Since his graduation he has written a
number of books and plays. He will
stay at the Sigma Nu house during his
visit here.

The faculty of the University of
Indiana has just established an edict
compelling all co-eds to abandon the
use of automobiles on the campus and
surrounding territory.
