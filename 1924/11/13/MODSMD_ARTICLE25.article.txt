In the agreement between Stan
ford and the University of Cali
fornia on athletic relations, it is
expressly stated and understood
that there shall be no student inva
sion of the campuses of the rival
universities. Any infraction will be
sufficient cause for cancellation of
the aforementioned agreement.
This means that parties of Stan
ford men will refrain from entering
the University of California campus
prior to the Big Game with the
intent to paint, mar, or destroy any
property on that campus.
Any violation of this agreement
will bring nothing but harm to Stan
ford. A break in athletic relations
with California at this time will
cripple the athletic policy of our
University. It is especially import
ant that, in view of the occurrences
of last week, nothing happen that
will in any way cause the powers
that be to consider calling off the
Big Game.
Any violation of this joint agree
ment will be dealt with in a very
drastic manner by the Men's Coun
cil of the Executive Committee of
the Associated Students.
