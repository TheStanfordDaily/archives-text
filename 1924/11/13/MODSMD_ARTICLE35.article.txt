# University of Pittsburgh To Construct Skyscraper
## 
### 
The University of Pittsburgh is plan
ning to build a fifty-two story sky
scraper to house most of the university
activities next year.
Only the Woolworth building and
the Metropolitan Life tower in New
York City will be taller than the struc
ture, which will be GBO feet high. An
oullay ot' $10,000,000 will be necessary
to bring it to completion. The present
plans call for a building in Gothic ar
chitecture 3GO feet long and 260 feet
wide. Sixteen high-speed elevators will
furnish transportation between the dif
ferent floors.
According to Chancellor Bowman of
Pittsburgh, the present plans were
used because of the limited space of
the -university quadrangle. A saving
in land alone of $2,000,000 will be ef
fected. It is expected that about 12,000
students will be accommodated.
