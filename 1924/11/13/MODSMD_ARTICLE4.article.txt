# FINAL DRESS REHEARSAL OF R.U.R. HELD TONIGHT
## Gordon Davis Puts Finishing Touches On Production; Record Sale Promised 
### 
rehearsal tonight will put the finishing touches on "R. U. R.,"
which Sword and Sandals Society is offering as its annual play in the
Assembly hall Friday night. As announced hi yesterday's Daily Palo
Alto, the rehearsal will be open to members of the faculty, and the admission
will be 50 cents apiece. The curtain will rise at S o'clock sharp.
"R. U. R." promises to break all records for legitimate productions, as the
seat sale so far has greatly exceeded any previous marks. Some good seats
are still left, and will be on sale at the Alumni Secretary's office in the

Administration building all day tomorrow. In the evening the box office
will be open in front of the Assembly hall, to dispose of any seals left over.
Dance at Branner Hall After Production
The dance after the show is being held in Branner hall, due to the courtesy
of the officers of that organization. The Women's Clubhouse is in use Friday
night, so the regular cast dance had to find some other place. Branner hall

'men have donated their lobby in order
that the cast of "R. U. R." would not
have to give up the ufeual festivities
after a show.
The curtain will rise promptly at 8
o'clock, and there will be no long
waits between acts, as has been the
case in most productions. The stage
crew, under the direction of Les Kiler,
has been practicing all week in order
to be able to move the scenery and
properties in record time, and they
have succeeded in cutting down the
intermission period by several min
utes, since they first started.


The last few humans left on earth are waiting for the robots to attack
their hiding-place. A tense moment in "R. U. R." From left to rinht: Ch= ,r
Parks, Guy Holliday, Delmer Daves, William Thornton, Paul Fassoth, Alan
Robertson, Helen Lewis, Dorothy Dahler. *
