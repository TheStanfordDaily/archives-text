Establishing a new record for intra
mural cross-country competition, up to
last night forty-six men had sent in
entries for the "Turkey Race" which
will be staged as a preliminary to the
Montana game on Saturday.
Last year's race drew a field of
twenty-seven runners. Enrollment
blanks from clubs which have delayed
in reporting are expected to bring the
1924 total to well above the fifty mark.
Although entries closed officially last
night, C. W. Davis announced that the
lists are still open in the Encina gym
for athletes who for any reason have
neglected to sign up.
Four independent runners and repre
sentatives from eleven living groups
have signified their intention of com
peting. Alpha Delta Phi leads with
twelve aspirants and EI Campo is sec
ond with nine. The following organiza
tions have entered men to date: Sigma
Alpha Epsilon, Breakers. El Campo,
Kappa Sigma, Theta Xi, Alpha Delta
Phi, Beta Theta Pi, Theta Chi, Encina,
