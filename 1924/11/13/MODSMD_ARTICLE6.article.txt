# SECOND TRIALS FOR "DULCY" SATURDAY
## 
### 
Second tryouts for "Dulcy," the
sophomore play to be given on Decem
ber 6, will be held Saturday morning
from 9 to 12, in the Little Theatre.
At this time, all those whose names
are posted outside of Gordon Davis'
office will be expected to appear.
New tryoutees will still have an
equal chance with those who have al
ready tried out, and will have an op
portunity to do so at 9 o'clock in the
morning in the Little Theatre. The
cast of "Dulcy" is an extremely large
one, with many different types needed,
and as yet not sufficient material has
been selected from which a choice can
be made to the cast.
