# ROUGHS WILL HOLD CENTER OF STAGE NEXT WEDNESDAY
## Regulations of Men's Council To Be in Force During Annual Festivity 
### 
Roughs' Day in its present moder
ated form will be celebrated Wednes
day, November 21, which is the day
before the Big Game Rally.
Last year this one remaining tradi
tion of a boisterous past was placed
on probation by the Men's Council. A
set of rules was drawn up and en
forced so rigidly, that no offensive ac
tions took place.
Two years ago at this time Roughs'
Day was in full sway. Boarded and
queerly-garbed figures ran amuck on
the campus, doing much damage and
making studying practically impossi
ble. Professors were openly ridiculed
if they attempted to hold class; visi
tors were forced to run the gauntlet
along with indiscreet students who
had been so foolish as to wear white
"ollars and ties; women were jeered
and pestered.
Statement of Men's Council
A member of Â»the Men's Council
gives out the following statement: "If
it is possible to conduct Roughs' Day
this year under the responsible con
trol of the senior class and in some
such manner as it was conducted last
year, it will be held again next year.
However, there is considerable agita
tion among the faculty to do away
with it altogether, and an indiscreet
act on the part of any member of the
student body will be sufficient cause
for the Men's Council to abolish it
forever."
The same rules that were enforced
last year will be used again this year.
They are as follows:
1. The activities of the day are to
be confined to the undergraduate men
of the student body. The utmost re
spect must be shown all visitors and
persons not connected with the stu
dent body, since these are in no way
to be considered as participants.
2. Members of the faculty must also
be shown due respect. Any attempt to
force faculty members through abuse
or coercion to enter into the spirit of
the day will not be tolerated.
3. Women students must not be an
noyed in any way and dressing in
women's clothes will not be permitted.
The greatest courtesy and respect
must be shown them and any ridicul
ing or or any un
gentlemanly cinnt will be severely
dealt with.
4. Class attendance must be kept
inviolate. Absences are not excused
any more on this day than on any
other.
5. The activities of the day must not
take place within the Quad or in any
of the University buildings. Noise out
side classrooms which interferes with
class-work will not be tolerated.
G. Property of individuals or of the
University must in no way be molested
or destroyed.
7. As set forth in the constitution of
the Men's Council (Article 5, Section
1) it becomes the duty of the Senior
Class to see that Roughs' Day is car
ried out in the proper and gentlemanly
manner.
8. Any infraction of the above regu
lations will subject violators to dis
missal from the University upon the
recommendation of the Men's Council.
