Winter Fashions
!
Winter in California isn't very awe-inspiring but there
are frosty mornings and rainy days; times when
you d love to wrap a luxuriously fur-trimmed coat
up snug around you. Or an ensemble costume that
has a smart little coat and soft, clinging dress under
neath. The Livingston Shop can show you the very
cleverest in town, all reasonably priced.
