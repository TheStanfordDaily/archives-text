# GRAYS TO MEET BEAR RESERVES TOMORROW AT 1
## Only One Change Made in Card's Lineup Since California Game 
### Donald Irving 
Stanford's Grays will have their last
and most important game of the sea
son tomorrow when they take the field
against the California Reserves at 1
o'clock in the stadium, as a prelimin
ary to the Stanford-Montana clash.
The Grays will enter the contest
with only one regular player on the
injured list. Dick Silver, who has been
holding down the fullback berth, is
out with a broken nose. McCormick
will go in at full, and will do the punt
ing. He has been booting around the
fifty-yard mark all season and gets
good height into his kicks.
Baldwin, who has recently reported
for practice, has greatly strengthened
the team. He knows football and han
dles his men with judgment.
Thirty-Four on String
Thirty-four men have been trying
out for the Gray eleven all year. They
have been putting in a lot of hard
work, and no position has been cinched
during the season. According to Hal
Davis, "The men out for the Gray
eleven have been showing the kind of
spirit and work that helps make the
varsity what it is."
Tlie Grays will probably line up as
follows for tomorrow's game: Rice,
1.e.; Evans, 1.t.; Stevenson, 1.g.; Gra
ham, c.; Sholes, r.g.; Simmons, r.t.;
Mann, r.e.; Baldwin, q.; Rispin, 1.h.;
Baxter, r.h.; McCormick, f.
Davis might make some changes in
this line-up before the teams goes on
the field. Macabee may go in at one
of the guard positions. He has been
playing good football, especially on
the defense. Potts may get the call for
tackle, while Hampton or Dungan may
be sent in at half.
It is possible that Stewart may start
at full. He has the necessary fight and
weight, is speedy, and has plenty of
drive. However, he lacks experience as
this is his first year at football.
