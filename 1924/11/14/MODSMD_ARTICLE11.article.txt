# Second "Dulcy" Tryouts Are Called Tomorrow
## 
### 
Second tryouts for "Dulcy," the j
sophomore play, will be held in the !
Little Theatre tomorrow morning from
9 to 12 o'clock. At this time any sopho- j
: mores who have not yet tried out will j
I have an opportunity to do so.
"Dulcy" is a modern high-speed ,
; comedy, concerned with the adven
-1 tures of a "dumb-bell" wife who tries
to help her husband's business in a
social way. The character of the lead- i
ing part will be the hardest to fill, and
every sophomore woman is* requested
i to try out, in order that no possibilities
i may be overlooked.
