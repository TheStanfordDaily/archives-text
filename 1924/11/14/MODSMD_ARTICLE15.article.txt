# BIG GAME TURNING POINT IN OUR GRID HISTORY—--COTTRELL
## 
### Harry Bennett 
Led by the Stanford band, nearly a
thousand enthusiastic Cardinal sup
porters paraded down the Row, past
the library, and took the pavilion by
storm amidst the cheering and shout
ing of the freshman who had hurried
over from Encina and who were al
ready occupying the ringside seats.
The spirit shown in the talks, yell
ing, and music was all to the same
effect, and the entire program pointed
toward the Big Game. It was conceded,
however, that the game with Montana
tomorrow will «be an important one,
even though the Grizzly eleven has
been beaten in all the games so far
this season.
"The probable outcome of the Big
Game will depend largely upon wheth
er or not Stanford's rooters can show
more enthusiasm and their ability to
out-yell the Blue and Gold section,"
said Professor Cottrell, of the Political
Science department, who is also a five
letter man in athletics and a former
football coach.
"The Big Game this year should be
the turning point in the football his
tory of Stanford University. In the
past the Blue and Gold rooting section
has been one of the biggest influences
on California's athletic successes.
