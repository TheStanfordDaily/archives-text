# BIG GAME TURNING POINT IN OUR GRID HISTORY—--COTTRELL
## 
### Harry Bennett 
Led by the Stanford band, nearly a
thousand enthusiastic Cardinal sup
porters paraded down the Row, past
the library, and took the pavilion by
storm amidst the cheering and shout
ing of the freshman who had hurried
over from Encina and who were al
ready occupying the ringside seats.
The spirit shown in the talks, yell
ing, and music was all to the same
effect, and the entire program pointed
toward the Big Game. It was conceded,
however, that the game with Montana
tomorrow will «be an important one,
even though the Grizzly eleven has
been beaten in all the games so far
this season.
"The probable outcome of the Big
Game will depend largely upon wheth
er or not Stanford's rooters can show
more enthusiasm and their ability to
out-yell the Blue and Gold section,"
said Professor Cottrell, of the Political
Science department, who is also a five
letter man in athletics and a former
football coach.
"The Big Game this year should be
the turning point in the football his
tory of Stanford University. In the
past the Blue and Gold rooting section
has been one of the biggest influences
on California's athletic successes.
Walker and Kelly, halves; and Nevers,
full. It seems hardly fair to refer to
some of these men as second-string
players for a number of them have
been performing in a manner which
would have won them a regular berth
on any other varsity team at Stanford
during the last six years.
Mitrhell at quarter has been doing
one of the best jobs of signal calling
that has been seen around the Farm
for many moons and it would not be a
surprise if he beat out Solomon for the
regular call at this station. Ted Ship
key, filling in for Thomas at end, has
exceeded the fondest hopes of his
backers, while "Tex" Middleton at the
other flank is a veteran whose ability
is unquestioned. Ward Poulson has al
ready shown real ability at tackle and
he should fill one of these positions
regularly on next year's team.
On the face of things, Stanford
looks to be at least three touchdowns
stronger than their opponents. Idaho,
whom the Cards defeated 3 to 0,

downed Montana 40 to 13 and from
these scores it would seem that a
large score might be expected tomor
row.
