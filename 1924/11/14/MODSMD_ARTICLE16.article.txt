# SOCCER VARSITY TO MEET OLYMPIC CLUB ELEVEN TOMORROW
## 
### 
With the exception of one change,
the line-up for the soccer varsity will
be the same in tomorrow's game with
the Olympic Club as it was when they
so thoroughly defeated California last
Tuesday. Due to a severe charley-horse
Art Schoen has been replaced by Car
doza at inside left when the game
starts on the stadium soccer field at
3:30 o'clock.
The Olympic Club is now leading
the University and Club League while
Stanford is tied for second with the
Barbarians. Consequently, a win over
this fast San Francisco team will
mean much for the Cardinals' rating.
The Redshirts have already dropped
one game to the Olympic Club this
year but that was before the return of
Harry Maloney. Since then, the im
provement in the teamwork of the
squad has been so great that there is
hardly any comparison.
Line Satisfactory
After considerable experimenting
Maloney seems to have found a satis
factory forward line. That is, one that
will combine well and will not lessen
the speed of the wing men.
With Bing Moy and Miron playing
the outside positions, the ball has been
countered oftener and with greater ac
curacy. Don Clark and Captain Ralph
Howe, in the backfield, are playing
strong and are holding the backs to
gether in fine shape.
In the game with California last
Tuesday six of the Card players were
Palo Alto men. Dave Clark, Don Clark,
Ralph Howe, Jack Franklin, Herbert
Hoover, Cardoza, and Bing Moy were
all pupils of Harry Maloney in the
Saturday morning gym classes for
boys even before they reached the
high school age.
Maloney has conducted theso classes
for some years. Because of his late
arrival on the campus this year no
classes have been organized but they
i are expected to start next quarter.
