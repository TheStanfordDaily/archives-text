# STANFORD STRONG FAVORITE IN MONTANA GAME TOMORROW
## "Pop" Warner Will Start Reserves Against Grizzlies In Order To Rest First Squad 
### Hugh Hollembeak 
COACH "POP" WARNER'S Stanford varsity will take the field tomorrow
afternoon at 3 o'clock in the stadium against the University of Montana
in the last contest the Cards will play before the Big Game, Nov. 212.
No one seems to doubt that the Redshirts will win. The Grizzlies, playing
their first year in the Pacific Coast Conference, have thus far proved to be a
weak sister and only a complete reversal of form would permit them to
<3take Stanford into camp. The Mon-

tana squad arrived in San Francisco
this morning and it will remain there
tonight, arriving on the Farm just long
enough before the opening whistle to
let the boys get into their togs. Early
this afternoon the visitors had a light
workout and then knocked off for the
day in order to rest up from the long
train ride.
Evidently Warner shares the optim
ism which seems to prevail every
where in regard to tomorrow's game,
for yesterday he let it be known that
with the exception of Ernie Nevers he
will start an entire team of second
string men against the Northerners.
After his long layoff Nevers needs all
the work he can get and from the
looks of things will be in there getting
it, but the rest of the team has been
traveling along at a fast clip for many
weeks and a rest will do them good.
It is more than likely that a number
of the regulars will get into the game
before the last report sounds from
the timekeeper's pistol. But the brunt
of the Montana attack will be borne
by the men who have been on the
bench at the opening of other games.
Second String Line-up
The line-up which will start tomor
row will probably be: Shipkey and
Middleton, ends; Poulson and Flood,
tackles; Armour and Hunt, guards;
Van Hook, center; Mitchell, quarter;
