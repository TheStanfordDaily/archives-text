# STANFORD STRONG FAVORITE IN MONTANA GAME TOMORROW
## "Pop" Warner Will Start Reserves Against Grizzlies In Order To Rest First Squad 
### Hugh Hollembeak 
COACH "POP" WARNER'S Stanford varsity will take the field tomorrow
afternoon at 3 o'clock in the stadium against the University of Montana
in the last contest the Cards will play before the Big Game, Nov. 212.
No one seems to doubt that the Redshirts will win. The Grizzlies, playing
their first year in the Pacific Coast Conference, have thus far proved to be a
weak sister and only a complete reversal of form would permit them to
<3take Stanford into camp. The Mon-

tana squad arrived in San Francisco
this morning and it will remain there
tonight, arriving on the Farm just long
enough before the opening whistle to
let the boys get into their togs. Early
this afternoon the visitors had a light
workout and then knocked off for the
day in order to rest up from the long
train ride.
Evidently Warner shares the optim
ism which seems to prevail every
where in regard to tomorrow's game,
for yesterday he let it be known that
with the exception of Ernie Nevers he
will start an entire team of second
string men against the Northerners.
After his long layoff Nevers needs all
the work he can get and from the
looks of things will be in there getting
it, but the rest of the team has been
traveling along at a fast clip for many
weeks and a rest will do them good.
It is more than likely that a number
of the regulars will get into the game
before the last report sounds from
the timekeeper's pistol. But the brunt
of the Montana attack will be borne
by the men who have been on the
bench at the opening of other games.
Second String Line-up
The line-up which will start tomor
row will probably be: Shipkey and
Middleton, ends; Poulson and Flood,
tackles; Armour and Hunt, guards;
Van Hook, center; Mitchell, quarter;
They have the largest and best organ
ized section of any university and this
seven thousand or more will be Stan
ford's biggest opponent.
Organization Needed
"Lack of organization has been tlfe
biggest fault of the Cardinal rooters
so far this season. A good play or -a
long run has brought spontaneous
yells from the rooters but it is the
organized cheering that counts.
"A good cheering section is very
necessary to the train's success. It
must practice and attain perfection
under McCallister the same as the
varsity must do under Warner."
Suggesting what all good rooters
should do, Professor Cottrell urged
that all sit together, quit queening to
rhe games, do not yell while the oppo
sition is yelling, do not yell at the
decisions of the refree, wear rooters'
hats, and wait after the game for the
yells and hymn.
During the entertainment the Strong
brothers introduced something new in
the way of entertainment when they
scored a big hit with a harmonica
duet.
The Cardinal orchestra started the
program and offered various melodious
strains throughout the evening.
Lindley Hall, the largest building on
the Earlham campus, was destroyed
by fire recently with a total loss of
about $250,000.

the timekeeper's pistol. But the brunt
of the Montana attack will be borne
by the men who have been on the
bench at the opening of other games.
Second String Line-up
The line-up which will start tomor
row will probably be: Shipkey and
Middleton, ends; Poulson and Flood,
tackles; Armour and Hunt, guards;
Van Hook, center; Mitchell, quarter;
They have the largest and best organ
ized section of any university and this
seven thousand or more will be Stan
ford's biggest opponent.
Organization Needed
"Lack of organization has been tlfe
biggest fault of the Cardinal rooters
so far this season. A good play or -a
long run has brought spontaneous
yells from the rooters but it is the
organized cheering that counts.
"A good cheering section is very
necessary to the train's success. It
must practice and attain perfection
under McCallister the same as the
varsity must do under Warner."
Suggesting what all good rooters
should do, Professor Cottrell urged
that all sit together, quit queening to
rhe games, do not yell while the oppo
sition is yelling, do not yell at the
decisions of the refree, wear rooters'
hats, and wait after the game for the
yells and hymn.
During the entertainment the Strong
brothers introduced something new in
the way of entertainment when they
scored a big hit with a harmonica
duet.
The Cardinal orchestra started the
program and offered various melodious
strains throughout the evening.
Lindley Hall, the largest building on
the Earlham campus, was destroyed
by fire recently with a total loss of
about $250,000.
COACH "POP" WARNER'S Stanford varsity will take the field tomorrow
afternoon at 3 o'clock in the stadium against the University of Montana
in the last contest the Cards will play before the Big Game, Nov. 212.
No one seems to doubt that the Redshirts will win. The Grizzlies, playing
their first year in the Pacific Coast Conference, have thus far proved to be a
weak sister and only a complete reversal of form would permit them to
<3take Stanford into camp. The Mon-

tana squad arrived in San Francisco
this morning and it will remain there
tonight, arriving on the Farm just long
enough before the opening whistle to
let the boys get into their togs. Early
this afternoon the visitors had a light
workout and then knocked off for the
day in order to rest up from the long
train ride.
Evidently Warner shares the optim
ism which seems to prevail every
where in regard to tomorrow's game,
for yesterday he let it be known that
with the exception of Ernie Nevers he
will start an entire team of second
string men against the Northerners.
After his long layoff Nevers needs all
the work he can get and from the
looks of things will be in there getting
it, but the rest of the team has been
traveling along at a fast clip for many
weeks and a rest will do them good.
It is more than likely that a number
of the regulars will get into the game
before the last report sounds from
the timekeeper's pistol. But the brunt
of the Montana attack will be borne
by the men who have been on the
bench at the opening of other games.
