Cometh the information that the University of Pittsburgh, "Pop"
Warner's old stand-by, is planning to erect a fifty-two story skyscraper for
the housing of most of the university activities.
Decidedly a novel and ambitious project for an institution of learning,
and one with perhaps more angles than floors. Gone will be the moon
light strolls under the wise old oaks dotting the campus, with the possible
substitution of high-speed courting in an express elevator. Gone will be
almost every sentimental device of the college fictionist. Gone will be the
standard pre-conceived ideas of college life.
Consider the other side. Education is the chief objective and "raison
d'etre" of any university, if we are to believe any number of people who
have every right to be believed. Most of us think so ourselves. And let
us hand it to Pittsburgh for being the first university to treat itself coldly
and logically and systematically as an educational agent.
And let us envy Pittsburgh. Building a new university with nothing
to start with but a bit of real estate means that every one of those fifty
two buildings piled one on top of the other will be modern, and calculated
for efficiency. Every function—save probably the stadium—will be under
one roof and designed for perfect convenience without interference. 1 rue,
it will not always be modern, but it will always be compact. And the
arrow of progress seems to point along the line of compression.
Pittsburgh is looking through the present and into the future. Very
clearly college life is losing its old characteristic of a "four year loaf," and
is becoming a business-like campaign for individual cultural or profes
sional betterment. The skyscraper will sweepingly eliminate most of the
opportunities for a leisurely and sylvan pastiming, and put educational
life on a basis of educational concentration and perfection. Which, to
many, is a bitter pill, but it is the trend of the times.
So here's to Pittsburgh, in making the first definite break. May your
plan become a certainty and your certainty become a skyscraper. It will
leave fewer associations, but more educations.
