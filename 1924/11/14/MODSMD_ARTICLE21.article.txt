# Montana Tomorrow
## 
### 
Jim Lawson's varsity will take its last dress rehearsal tomorrow, and
the Stanford stadium will lapse again into silence for a time.
Montana is on the wayâ€”the underdog, but a dog far from dead.
Princeton, climbing out from under the odds and pushing Harvard's aris
tocratic note deep into the swamp, has furnished an inspiration to every
defeated and down-for-the-count-of-nine team in the country, and it is
quite within the possibilities for Montana to pull a Princeton. Or a Saint
Mary's.
Nobody expects it. Nobody here on the Farm wants it. But for the
good of the Stanford varsity itself, and the joy of the Montana student
body, it is to be hoped that Montana comes bloody close to it. A bitter
contest and a close victory would teach the Cards a lot that they want to
know and haven't had much opportunity to learn.
A "VIEWPOINT" containing over six hundred words and signed
"Robot No. 10" has been reecived at the Daily office. It contains an
original slant, and if the writer will confidentially disclose his bawl-out
monniker his letter will be forthwith printed in toto.
THE GRAYS will pile into California tomorrow. These men play a
real part in the Stanford football program, so be out at 1 o'clock and help
push them.
WEAR YOUR ROOTER'S HAT.
