"A king," said Dr. Jordan last night,
"is an idea they used to have of a
man chosen by divine right; it so hap
pened that God always put in the
oldest eon of the last failure he had
made."
The first king Dr. Jordan Paw was
the former kaiser. "I was not favor
ably impressed. He looked as if he had
an idea that the whole world was de
pendent on him alone."
"The predecessor of tho present
Mikado of Japan," said Dr. Jordan,
"was a serious-minded, wise old man."
When he was presented to him, Dr.
Jordan was Instructed not to wear

I gloves and not to turn his back on the
emperor. lie was advised, also, that it
might bo a good thing if he didn't
wear glasses as in that country any
one wearing glasses could see through
anyone else. "A Cambridge graduate
was acting as his advisor," said Dr. j
Jordan, "and he was a good deal wiser
than some of the advisors of our sen
ate."
The king of Greece and his wife,
were having a heated armament over'
some money that the king had bor
rowed from Prance, so Dr. Jordan was i
unable to see him. The queen had em-;!
n«p point with a paper kuife
and the king wd.B conveyed to the hos- :
pi till for pneumonia. "He had four ribs :
taken out." said Dr. Jordan, "and we j
all know that taking out ribs is a sure i
•lire for pneumonia."
