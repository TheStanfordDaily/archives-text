Day after day he waited there,
The old, near-sighted man.
He paced before Memorial Church
And its facade he'd scan.
He cared not for the passing throngs,
The noisy student bunch,
From dawn 'till dark he held his post—
(One hour off for lunch).
His lonely vigil bore no fruit;
He waited patiently.
His head was bowed in a despair
It tore my heart to see.
His eyes were lit with yearning as
He turned them on the church—
I called down curses on the ones
Who'd left him in the lurch.
"You've found a friend," I cried to him
And grabbed his withered hand.
"Come, I will help you—'tell me how!"
(I wept to beat the band.)
The uncouth ruffian threw me off!
"You idiot," he said,
I only came to see the freaks—
I'm meeting them instead.
"That poster building over there
Is where I want to go!
When is the barker coming out
To ballyhoo the show?"

Even with free Camels being passed
out, it ain't right. One rough walked
a mile to get a free Camel and got
four packages. By higher mathematics
it was proven that he walked only 22
yards for each of the 80 fags. And any
body who could get away with proving
a thing like that could easily get the
other 79 smokes.

One co-ed who was asked what
brand she used became highly indig
nant. "We don't use tobacco here, we
burn Bull," she asserted. "Read the
Chronicle."

As she walked off she muttered
something about where was the good
old tradition of Stanford Democracy
going and the like if they didn't watch
out pretty soon there would be a
movement to get the co-eds to demand
Scotch in place of synthetic. —J. N.
AND THERE YOU R, U R!
