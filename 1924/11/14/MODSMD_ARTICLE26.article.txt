' at 4 o'clock, Tuesday, November 18,
will be the first game of the season for

This game, according to Miss Georg
iana Burk, coach of both teams,
(should be interesting, since both teams
! are strong and fast.
I

' brilliant individual players on both
elevens. The '26 team has an excep
| tionally strong baokfield, with Ruth
Vredenburgh, captain and center half
back; Jean Ward, right fullback; and
Lois Wilbur, right halfback, as stars.

star player since her freshman year,

i entirely from last year's line-up with
the exception of Cecile Feusier, cen
! ter forward, and Millison Hardy, left
inside, an all-star player last year.
The sophomore team's greatest
strength lies in its forward line. Marie
Manchee, captain and center forward,
; was an all-star player last year. She
jis efficient at a quick bully-off,
I and carries the ball down the field for
| long distances. Charlotte Lovekin at
left wing and Bernice Chase at right
! wing are playing up to standard. The
: halfback line is steady, but not as
strong as that of the junior team.
Elizabeth Williams in the goal is a
! reliable and able player.
