# PLAYOFF OF THREE-CORNERED TIE WILL BE HELD TOMORROW
## 
### 
Play-off of the three-cornered tie for |
interclass football honors between the
sophomores, seniors, and juniors will
start at !â™¦ tomorrow morning when the
second-year men will meet the seniors
on the freshman field. The winner of j
this contest will play the juniors at
4 p.m. Tuesday afternoon.
The sophomores probably have the
;greatest number of individual stars;
but numerous fumbles, especially in j
I their game with the juniors, have con
siderably weakened what might be a
very powerful machine. The stars of
the '27 eleven are Smytlie, right half,
and Rafetto, left tackle.
The seniors' offense has been built
1 up around McHose and Fullerton, who
! have both been very effective in ad
; vancing the ball. Blaine at center has
played a very consistent game both
on the defense and offense.
i Beloit College fraternities have
i barred all parties on Sunday.
