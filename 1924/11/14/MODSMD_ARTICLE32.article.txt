# FRESHMEN BEGIN TO GUARD BIG BONFIRE FROM "PYROMANIACS"
## 
### 
Organized guarding of the bonfire
pile was installed last night when ten
freshmen braved the night air and
cool winds to protect their structure
from possible damage by interested
U. C. students. Wednesday night a
few ambitious ones stayed out almost
all through the night watches.
Tomorrow night twenty members of
the class will stand guard duty and
Sunday right thirty or forty will take
their posts, and the remaining nights
of the week will see sixty or seventy
freshmen guarding. Each man is re
quired to be awake and alert for two
of his allotted eight hours, and he
must spend the remaining six hours
■at the bonfire sleeping if he wishes —
mid can.
The great bonfire pile is now tower
ing almost forty feet above the ground
and work is yet far from done. During
the afternoons, wagons bearing loads
of wood, brush, and other combusti
bles, may be seen coming to the bon
•flre every few minutes. Every avail
able scrap of spare wood nearby has
iieen brought by freshman patrols to
the bonfire and the woodless area
around the pile is daily increasing.
Great enthusiasm is being shown
this year in the women's rifle team at
the University of Oregon. Seventeen
iiouses have entered the contest, while
last year there were only eleven. The
team will be run as a regular part of
women's athletics.
