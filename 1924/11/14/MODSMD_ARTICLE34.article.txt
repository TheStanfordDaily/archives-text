# CLEMSON A. C. STUDENTS STRIKE FOR BETTER FOOD
## 
### 
Half the students of Clemson Agri
cultural College, South Carolina,
"walked out" several weeks ago and
refused to return unless better food
be supplied and Cadet Hallahan be re
instated. Hallahan was expelled on
what the students consider a "frame
up" charge of intoxication.
