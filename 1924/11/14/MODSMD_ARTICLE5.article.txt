# R. U. R. REHEARSAL PROMISES THRILLS
## Faculty Pleased With Pre-View Of Sword and Sandals Show; Robot Acting Polished 
### Charles Simons 
//"|-^ u - R." will be the best dramatic effort that Gordon Davis has ever
IV P roduced on the Stanford campus. This was the outstanding feature
A\- of last night's dress rehearsal, which for the first time in the history
of dress rehearsals, was opened to the public. Faculty members who attended
were as one in pronouncing "R. U. R." the most thrilling and the most enter
taining play they had seen in years.
An audience composed of faculty members and their families would natur
ally be a critical one, and only the best kind of effort would be liable to bring

widespread commendation. Frequently after each act, they would clap until
the curtains were parted again and they could see again the actors or actresses
who had just appeared.
Watch out for that third act! In the ordinary paralance, it is a WOW.
The tense, almost desperate moment of silence before the advancing robots

<S>attack, and then the burst of thunder
ous noise, from a howling wind, a
shrill factory whistle to a fusillade of
revolver shots and a terrific bomb ex
plosion, the action is so rapid-fire and
' thrilling that it will bring you out of
, your seat with a bound.
Not albne for its gripping melo
drama, but for the wealth of splendid
character acting is "R. IT. R." a re
markable production. There is a snap
and verve to the action which be
speaks an exceedingly well-developed
, unity between the efforts of the direc
tor, the technical staff and the cast.
Not counting the time it took to secure
. pictures after each act, the scenes
were changed in exactly 12 minutes, a
record never before equaled on the
Stanford stage, and in every other way
the production of "R. U. R." tonight
should prove to be one of the most
interesting experiences along theatri
cal lines that any one in the audience
has ever had.
