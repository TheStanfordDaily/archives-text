# CLUB RUNNERS VIE IN CROSS COUNTRY BEFORE GRID GAME
## 
### 
Forty-seven runners will face the
starter in the fourth annual intramural
cross-country race in the stadium at
2:30 tomorrow afternoon, preliminary
to the Montana game.
The contest has been dubbed the
"Turkey Race" because of the dona
tion by Liddicoat's Market of Palo
Alto of two ten-pound turkeys as the
award for the winning team. The fowls
replace the placque presented in pre
i vious years. In addition, gold, silver,
j and bronze meadls will be given the
first three individuals to cross the
i finish line.
Three men constitute* a team, and
the living group whose trio places
i highest will walk off with the birds.
El Campo won the placque last year,
and will have nine men out in suits
| tomorrow in an effort to repeat.
The course of the run covers the
| easiest route in the history of intra
mural competition, and is three miles
in length. It has been marked with red
and blue flags for the convenience of
the runners. The following description
i has been issued by C. W. Davis:
Start in the stadium on the straight
! away and run around track to the rear
gate; then to the back stretch of the
! old track and down the street past the
Military department to the last of four
trees marked by a red flag; turn right
and cross polo field to red flag on
mound; continue along fence to
Frenchmen's Cut; cross road and turn
right to red flag up hill to road; turn

and through fields to rear of Branner
hall; back of tennis courts to old track
and thence to stadium; run one lap of
