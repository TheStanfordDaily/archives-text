# R.U.R. PRODUCTION THRILLS AUDIENCE BY WEIRD EFFECTS
## Delmer Daves Proves Star of Play; Dorothy Dahler Pleases with Comedy 
### Charles Simons 
One could not help wondering last
Friday night, as "R. U. R." was being
presented to an enthusiastic audience,
just how many persons who composed
that audience caught the significance j
of its satire, and the terrific implica
tion of its theme.
One thing stands out predominately ;
in connection with the performance,
which incidentally was one of the best
of Gordon Davis' efforts, and that is
this: either Stanford students are not
well enough educated to understand
anything but broad comedy or bur- i
lesque, or the dramatic bill-of-fare in j
the past has not included enough of,
the serious element. Or, if that is too j
harsh, it may have been simply care-1
lessness, and a superabundance of
spirit which prompted laughs from
the audience in the most tensely dra
matic situations.
Best in Years
Sword and Sandals Society in gen-'
eral, and Gordon Davis in particular,
are to be congratulated on their pro
duction. It not only lived up to ex
pectations but it was the concensus ofj
opinion that it was one of the very
best shows seen in recent years. The j
epilogue seemed a bit superfluous and
was in the nature of an anti-climax,
but it appears that the United States
representatives of the author insisted
on a happy ending, to satisfy the Amer
ican taste in drama.
Besides managing the production,
which is quite a bit of a job in itself.
Delmer Daves literally "ran away" i
with the show. His acting was a reve
lation, and the way he handled the
difficult epilogue was marvelous.
Never too dramatic, his interpretation
of the lovable old builder was force
ful and convincing throughout. It is a
happy thing for Stanford dramatics
that Daves will be here two more
years.
Dorothy Dahler Amuses
Dorothy Dahler was great in the
role of Nana. The audience found
amusement in her every word, and her
appearance on the stage was a signal
for a hearty laugh. We are willing to
wager than a comedy with this young
lady as the lead would play to the
S. R. O. sign.
The leads were somewhat subordi
nate to other characters in the play.
Helen Lewis, in the role of Helena
Glory, had a difficult part which was
not suited to her type of acting. She
was at her best in the second act,
where the audience first began to
really like her.
Alan Robertson was ill at ease in
the first act, and appeared somewhat
self-conscious, but his pleasing per
sonality and remarkably good voice
made up for this in later bits of action.
Thornton Shines
The officials of the robot factory,
played by William Thornton, Paul Fas
soth, Charles Parks, and Guy Holli
day, were good in spots, but seemed
to lack the fire and aggressiveness
which one would naturally associate
with the heads of such an ultra-modern
concern. Thornton was the best of the
quartet, with Parks and Fassoth not
far behind him. Parks was vital in his
last bit of action, where he went out
to the robots with a bundle of money,

and Fassoth was excellent in the sec
ond act where he examined the de-1
mented robot for signs of human char
acteristics.
Among the robots, Virginia Graves
and Kenneth McDougal were most
impressive. Their work in the epi
logue was very well done, and con- !
tributed in no small measure to the
effectiveness of the play.
Forget Lines
Dave Mannoccir was physically per
fect in the part of Radius; but ruined
what would have been a terrifying
scene by forgetting his lines. Another
robot, name unknown, caused a let-,
down in interest and effectiveness i
when he waited for what seemed an
age before replying "yes" to Mannoc
cir's query of "Finished him?" Except
for these two noticeable defects, the
robots as a whole were ominous in
the extreme, and helped materially to
make the show a success.
As usual, Chrysella Dunker and Les j
Kiler scored a triumph. It seems al
most axiomatic than whenever the cur-!
tains in the Assembly hall part on a j
stage setting executed by this pair,
applause is the result. Their efforts for j
"R. U. R." were rewarded last Friday !
night at the opening of each act, and
they are to be congratulated on keep
ing up their precedent of success.
Hume West and Bill Clark were re
sponsible for the electrical and me
chanical effects, which were put over
without a flaw.

A special chapel service was held in
honor of the four Northwestern Uni
versity athletes who carried off honors
in the Olympic games. A bronze tablet
bearing the names of the four will
soon be erected as a permanent form
of recognition.
