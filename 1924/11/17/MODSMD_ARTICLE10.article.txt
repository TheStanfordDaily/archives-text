# JEROME STANFORD TELLS OF PARIS EVENTS IN 1871
## Communists Hold City During Period Of Unrest After Franco-Prussian War 
### Dudley Ross 
In 1871 after the Franco-Pru√üsian
War when the first great modern up
rising of the proletariat formed the
temporary Paris Commune, Jerome
Stanford, nephew and only living rela
tive of the founder of the University,
was in Paris for three months, while
on his way to take charge of a mine
in Spain. At the present time he is em
ployed in the Comptroller's depart
ment.
"During their hold on Paris in the
spring of 1871," says Stanford in his
iccount of the siege, "the Communists
kept an efficient watch over the
' streets, so that it was rather danger
| oub lor us to go far from the hotel

where we were staying and we had
to keep care to avoid any bands which
might be approaching.
"The uprising," he says, "was caused j
mainly by the dislike of the people
for the inefficiency of the French gov
ernment, which had just come through
the war with Germany so thoroughly
beaten. They believed that they had
an opportunity in the ensuing confu
sion to seize control of the city, and
they were successful for three months ;
while the Germans were encamped
outside the city and French troops
were at Versailles.
"After the revolt had been put
down, and a reaction might have been
expected, I was surprised to see the
people, even in the poorer quarters,
outside their homes eating and drink
ing as thought it were a holiday, when
but the day before the communists
had made their last stand against the
army. I was practically the only
American in the city at the time, for
most of them left before the Germans
had reached the outskirts of Paris."
According to Stanford, the French
themselves did more damage to Paris
than the Germans during the siege.
Besides erecting barrlcads, the mob
burned the famous Tuilleries and also
the Hotel do Ville. All relics of the
Bonapartes were also mutilated or de
stroyed.
Despite the defenses which had been
erected, the communists were easily
suppressed when the troops finally
entered the city from Versailles.
