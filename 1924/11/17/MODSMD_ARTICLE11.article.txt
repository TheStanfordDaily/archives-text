# Section on Hill Opened To Alumni for Big Game
## 
### 
Field glass venders and straw cushion
merchants should have a large trade in
the section established on the hill back
of the California stadium for the Big
Game Saturday.
About 5,000 alumni have been allotted
passes to an enclosed section on a por
tion of the hill, since so many of their
applications for tickets had to be turned
down.
With the addition of this rooting sec
tion outside the stadium proper, prob
ably the largest crowd that has ever seen
a football game in the West will be on
hand for the Card-Bear tussle. No open
sale is being held for standing room in
this choice location, but hawkers will
probably collect as much from these out
of-luck gentlemen as stadium seats would
have cost.
