# RED CROSS STARTS ANNUAL DRIVE FOR MEMBERS TOMORROW
## 
### 
The local Red Cross roll call will
commence tomorrow, with a canvass of
living groups. The drive is a part of the
Red Cross membership campaign, which
is conducted every year from Armistice
day to Thanksgiving, and is now in
progress all over the country.
The American Red Cross is "the one
national organization which is equipped
and ready in an instance to answer the
call of distressed humanity in every
emergency." It performs such services
as disaster jelief, an instance of which
is the recent Japanese earthquake; public
health nursing, the maintenanc of a
corps of reserve nurses, Junior Red
Cross, first aid, and life saving. Its op
erations are both domestic and foreign.
It is, in fact, the national agent in per
forming relief work.
President Coolidge says of it: "It is
the instrument of the people in giving
expression to the lofty, unselfish, human
ism, the practical idealism, characteristic
of this nation from its humble begin
nings.
Membership subscriptions vary, from
$1 up; 50 cents out of each subscription
goes to the national and international
Red Cross service for activities of gen
eral application, and the rest of the sub
scription to the local chapter for com
munity use.
The campus roll call is only a phase
of the national campaign for subscrip
tions, most of which are merely a re
newal of former membership. It is
therefore not assigned by the Social Ser
vice Board to the Stanford quarterly
drive, but comes concurrently with the
national drive.
