# STAMFORD TAKES CONFERENCE LEAD BY CRUSH MONTANA
## Reserve Team Easily Scores 41 to 3 Victory Over Grizzlies; Nevers Probably Out of Big Game 
### David Meiklejohn 
STANFORD took the lead in the Pacific Coast Conference last Saturday by
defeating Montana 41 to 3, thereby clearing the last obstacle before the
Big Game against California.
"Pop" Warner sent his team to its greatest triumph of the season with a
reserve line and a reserve backfield, using nothing but straight football, and
convincing even the most doubtful that Stanford is still capable of throwing
in a strong team against California next Saturday.
Probably the most disappointing result of the game was the fact that Ernie
Nevers, so confidently banked on to perform for the Cardinals next Saturday,
will no doubt be kept from the classic affair of the year because of his injury,
which has bothered him all season. It was hoped, yes, expected, that Nevers
would prove the Cardinal mainstay against the clever California team next
week, but that dream was more or less blasted when the big blond fullback

off the field in the Montaua
game too lame for further use.
Nevers' chief use this year would,
of course, have been in the kicking
department, and Stanford at least has
Norm Cleaveland, a good puuter and
; end-runner to step in Never a' place.
! Nevers was a ground-gainer, and Hey
and Bogue will have to go harder than
ever to make up for this deficiency in
the offensive. And both Bogue and Hey
: are capable of this, in the writer's
| opinion.
Judging from the type-of team War
ner used last Saturday it would be
slightly unfair to criticize the Stanford
team for fumbling often, playing rag
ged football, and being weak, ex
tremely weak, on the wing positions.
Of course one must take into consider
ation the Kelly of Montana is a won
derful open-field runner, clever field
general, and passer par-excellent.
It was the Stanford offensive, not
the Cardinal defensive, that piled up
I such an overwhelming score against
the northern grizzlies. Still to the line
; goes the credit of being able to hold
, where holding was necessary, and of
opening up holes when gains were
most needed.
The work of the Stanford line and
backfield only goes to prove more con
clusively that the Cards have a re
serve strength equal to that of any
team in the Coast Conference.
Montana had a backfield and no line.
Stanford had a team, slow at times to
grasp the drift of the Grizzlie's offense,
but an aggregation strong enough,
nevertheless, to adjust itself to the
circumstances and take advantage of
the breaks.
Power —it sounds ever so much bet
ter than "spirit"—was the chief Cardi
nal virtue last Saturday. Despite fum
bles, despite ragged playing, Stanford's
punch was evident throughout, and
that power is not likely to disappear
after the first showing of the Cards
against California next Saturday.
Montana was but a stepping-stone to
a clear schedule of victories before
the California game, and the Grizzlies
obligingingly accommodated the Cards
by not proving exceedingly stxong.
