# STAMFORD TAKES CONFERENCE LEAD BY CRUSH MONTANA
## Reserve Team Easily Scores 41 to 3 Victory Over Grizzlies; Nevers Probably Out of Big Game 
### David Meiklejohn 
STANFORD took the lead in the Pacific Coast Conference last Saturday by
defeating Montana 41 to 3, thereby clearing the last obstacle before the
Big Game against California.
"Pop" Warner sent his team to its greatest triumph of the season with a
reserve line and a reserve backfield, using nothing but straight football, and
convincing even the most doubtful that Stanford is still capable of throwing
in a strong team against California next Saturday.
Probably the most disappointing result of the game was the fact that Ernie
Nevers, so confidently banked on to perform for the Cardinals next Saturday,
will no doubt be kept from the classic affair of the year because of his injury,
which has bothered him all season. It was hoped, yes, expected, that Nevers
would prove the Cardinal mainstay against the clever California team next
week, but that dream was more or less blasted when the big blond fullback

Nevers' chief use this year would,
of course, have been in the kicking
department, and Stanford at least has
Norm Cleaveland, a good puuter and

! Nevers was a ground-gainer, and Hey
and Bogue will have to go harder than
ever to make up for this deficiency in
the offensive. And both Bogue and Hey

| opinion.
Judging from the type-of team War
ner used last Saturday it would be
slightly unfair to criticize the Stanford
team for fumbling often, playing rag
ged football, and being weak, ex
tremely weak, on the wing positions.
Of course one must take into consider
ation the Kelly of Montana is a won
derful open-field runner, clever field
general, and passer par-excellent.
It was the Stanford offensive, not
the Cardinal defensive, that piled up
I such an overwhelming score against
the northern grizzlies. Still to the line
; goes the credit of being able to hold
, where holding was necessary, and of
opening up holes when gains were
