## 
### 
By John Levi
For the safe and sane Roughs' Day!
that will be held Wednesday the only'
restriction in regar dto dress is that l
male members of the student body do
not bedeck their carcasses in female I
attire. Aside from this and a little dis-:
cretion the sky is the limit.
Along - with the moderation of,
Roughs' Day last year there came a
tendency for the men to refrain from
dressing in such startling and gro
tesque costumes as in previous years.;
Most of the roughs were satisfied with
a generous crop of whiskers and a
flannel shirt. As it was the first "Un
rough Roughs' Day" it was not realized
that an occasion of this kind could
be successfully staged under regula
tions. This wact was probably respon
sible for the air of indifference.
The Senior control committee that
was appointed by Albert Smith, presi
dent of the senior class, will be as
signed the duty of enforcing the rules
that have been laid down by the Men's j
council. There has been considerable I
agitation among the faculty members !
to do away with the celebration for
good, and so any infraction of the rules j
will probably be cause enough to carry
out their wish.
