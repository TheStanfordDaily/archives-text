# TWO PLACE KICKS GIVE SECONDS WIN OVER BEAR GOOFS
## 
### 
Place kicks by Hamilton and Rice
enabled the Stanford Grays to score a
6 to 0 victory over the California re
serves in an uninteresting and ragged 1
contest in the stadium last Saturday.
Stanford's scores came in the third
! and fourth quarters after the Cardinals
had been unable to push the ball over
the final chalk mark. Penalties when
they were within scoring distance forced
the Grays to resort to the kicking route !
for the points on both occasions.
The first half of the game was score- â€¢
less, although Stanford managed to keep
most of the play in California territory. 1
Two place kicks were attempted by the !
Gray eleven during this half, but both
went wide.
Stanford was easily superior in gain- [
ing yards, making most of its gains 011
! end runs.
Hamilton made the first score of the
game soon after the start of the second
half. Stanford kicked off to California,
but the Bear reserves fumbled, and Stan
ford recovered on California's 25-yard
line. They Grays made it first down 011
the 14-yard line in four plays. They
were then penalized five yards for off-side,
and Hamilton made a place kick from
I the 10-yard line. Three more points
were added by Rice in the fourth quarter.
The game was slowed up by the large
number of fumbles and penalties. Ris
pin, Hamilton, Baldwin, and Baxter
showed up well for the Grays.
