# SOPHOMORES DOWN SENIOR ELEVEN IN CLOSE GRID GAME
## 
### 
The sophomore eleven earned the
right to play the juniors in the first
play-off for the interclass football
championship by a 13 to 6 win over
the seniors Saturday morning on the
Freshman field. The game was close
all the way through and it was not
until the last few minutes of play
that the sophomores were able to put
over the winning touchdown.
Two thirty-yard drop kicks by Mc-
Hose of the seniors netted the upper
classmen their six points. An attempt
ed punt by the seniors from their five
yard line, which was blocked by one
of their own backs and recovered be
hind the goal line by Borley, was re
sponsible for the second-year men's
first score.
Score Comes Fast
With four minutes to play the count
stood 6 to 6 and the sophs had the
hall on the fifty-yard line. A pass from
Smythe to Sproule advanced the ball
twenty yards. Harvey then gained 10
yards on a short end run. A down was
wasted after which Quarterback Price
called for a shoe-string pass. He re
ceived the ball but, seeing that all his
receivers were covered, he ran instead
and carried the ball through tackle
20 yards for a touchdown. The sophs
converted and a minute later the game
ended.
The oustanding stars of Seraphim
Post's team were Smythe at left half,
Price at quarter, and Raffetto at left
tackle. Mcllose was the individual star
of the senior squad, but McCallister
showed his speed on several well-exe
cuted end runs. Blaine at center played
a consistent game.
Offense Improved
Since meeting the seniors two weeks
ago in a 0 to 0 tie the sophomores had
smoothed off several rough places in
their playing. Numerous fumbles had
marred their offense at that time, but
the fact that not a fumble occurred
during the second game showed that
Post had drummed into his men's head
the importance of holding the pigskin
firmly.
The sophs will meet the juniors to
morrow afternoon at 4 o'clock on the
Freshman field in the deciding game
of the series.

for O'Hara.
The sophomore eleven earned the
right to play the juniors in the first
play-off for the interclass football
championship by a 13 to 6 win over
the seniors Saturday morning on the
Freshman field. The game was close
all the way through and it was not
until the last few minutes of play
that the sophomores were able to put
over the winning touchdown.
Two thirty-yard drop kicks by Mc-
Hose of the seniors netted the upper
classmen their six points. An attempt
ed punt by the seniors from their five
yard line, which was blocked by one
of their own backs and recovered be
hind the goal line by Borley, was re
sponsible for the second-year men's
first score.
Score Comes Fast
With four minutes to play the count
stood 6 to 6 and the sophs had the
hall on the fifty-yard line. A pass from
Smythe to Sproule advanced the ball
twenty yards. Harvey then gained 10
yards on a short end run. A down was
wasted after which Quarterback Price
called for a shoe-string pass. He re
ceived the ball but, seeing that all his
receivers were covered, he ran instead
and carried the ball through tackle
20 yards for a touchdown. The sophs
converted and a minute later the game
ended.
The oustanding stars of Seraphim
Post's team were Smythe at left half,
Price at quarter, and Raffetto at left
tackle. Mcllose was the individual star
of the senior squad, but McCallister
showed his speed on several well-exe
cuted end runs. Blaine at center played
a consistent game.
Offense Improved
Since meeting the seniors two weeks
ago in a 0 to 0 tie the sophomores had
smoothed off several rough places in
their playing. Numerous fumbles had
marred their offense at that time, but
the fact that not a fumble occurred
during the second game showed that
Post had drummed into his men's head
the importance of holding the pigskin
firmly.
The sophs will meet the juniors to
morrow afternoon at 4 o'clock on the
Freshman field in the deciding game
of the series.
