# Six—Stanford Grays
## 
### 
It is a pleasure to think that Stanford is leading up to a victory next
Saturday. The class of 1928 took a leg on the trophy, Hal Davis' Gray
team chewed off another during the week-end, and it remains for the
varsity to quash the only remaining report of Bruin supremacy—Andy
Smith's pupils.
Of course, it is memorable that the same conditions were in effect last
year. The frosh smashed through, the Grays walked over, but the big
Red boys found themselves out-gamed just nine points. But we like to
think that it will be different this season. Another year of the Warner
system; "Pop" himself at the helm, supported by the old reliable Kerr-
Thornhill combination that came so close to putting it over once before;
and the effect on the team of another year's determination to break the
spell and come out on top. We want the crescendo of Stanford come
throughs to continue.
But at present, congratulations are extended to the reserves—the Gray
team that fought losing fights against the Stanford varsity all season, and
then won out over the men in faded blue jersies. It's a tough life, this
business of being one of the "Omelettes," and the two months of un
heralded and none too glorious bruises at the hands of the varsity are
partly healed through this climax of a California victory. It takes stamina
to be an "Omelette" and be tumbled about and mashed up for the good of
the sport, with very little recognition of your efforts. These men did it,
and they earned their own reward and recognition against California Sat
urday.
The babes and the Grays have taken a straw vote —and Stanford has
thereby been unofficially elected. The polls open Saturday.
