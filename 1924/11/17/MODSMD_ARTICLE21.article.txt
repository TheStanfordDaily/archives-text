# Get Them Cold

Suggestions keep pouring in for the betterment of the rooting section,
and each one seems to have as its salient point the fact that not everybody
knows the words which accompany the music. Constructive criticism is
offered for the improvement of this weakness, and some of it is practical
and some isn't.
This is a matter best taken up by the individual living group or eating
club. The words are easily available, and a few tuneful moments after
each polishing of the platter would boost the knowledge of these essential
syllables immensely, and in plenty of time for them to be of use. Stan
ford songs seems to be one of the few noises that don't keep Encina spon
sors awake all night, and Stanford songs would be useful vocalization for
freshmen. Possibly the sponsors would not object to losing a bit of sleep
in a good cause.
The point of the matter is that the songs can be made letter-perfect in a
small group more practically than in an assemblage of the entire student
body. Brush up on them at home, and then stay with the tempo set by
the yell-leaders.

VIEWPOINTS in quantity are on tap, and will be dished up as rap
idly as space permits. Kindly hold them to 200 words.
