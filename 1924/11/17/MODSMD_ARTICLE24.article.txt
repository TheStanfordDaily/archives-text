Unless the Food Kings come down
in their prices so that a loaf of bread
is within the buying power of a
month's wages, the bird who forgets
to bait the mouse trap will have no
dinner on Nov. 27, which, according to
this year's calendar, is Thanksgiving.
* * *
Sugar is scarcer than sun dials in
coal mines, and $5.00 worth of it can
be scattered with ample ease on a
Lincoln penny and still be able to
see the Pres. Cranberries are $3.00 a
pair and there are an even two stalks
of celery in a bunch.
• * *
We don't see why the Puritans
picked on the Turkey for Thanksgiv
ing. The price of one of these babies
sounds like the number of the last
page in Webster's dictionary. Why not
take sea gulls, the Great Auk, or some
other bird easier to get.
* • *
There is a lot of money waiting for
the bimbo who can invent a substitute
for Turkey. Some dummy will prob
ably come out with a book pretty
quick entitled "Wasps' Ankles as a
Substitute for Salmon Eggs," or the
like. For all we know we might be
able to live on this stuff and get so fat
we would have to have our clothes
made by the same company that
makes Sells-Floto tents.

Well, what of it? Hold 'em Rover
Boys. —HACK SICKLER.
In presidential years you know,
There's nothing in the world but—
WOE!
The politicians roar ana scowl
The other gang has won
In horrid accents loud they howl,
"Prosperity is done!"
The statistician stands aghast.
The curve of lead has dropped!
His family feels the sharp contrast —
All happiness has flopped!
In several million more of years,
Geologists declaim,
The oil supply will fail, and tears
Start to their eyes what shame!
The blackest gloom depresses all.
There's not a word of cheer.
To cap it all, the brewery
Has JUST RUN OUT OF BEER!
—THIRD PARTY.

Geologists declaim,
The oil supply will fail, and tears
Start to their eyes what shame!
The blackest gloom depresses all.
There's not a word of cheer.
To cap it all, the brewery
Has JUST RUN OUT OF BEER!
—THIRD PARTY.
The gent who eats a real old fash
i ioned Thanksgiving dinner this year
i will make John D. look like a well-to
i do bookkeeper.

Unless the Food Kings come down
in their prices so that a loaf of bread
is within the buying power of a
month's wages, the bird who forgets
to bait the mouse trap will have no
dinner on Nov. 27, which, according to
this year's calendar, is Thanksgiving.

Sugar is scarcer than sun dials in
coal mines, and $5.00 worth of it can
be scattered with ample ease on a
Lincoln penny and still be able to
see the Pres. Cranberries are $3.00 a
pair and there are an even two stalks
of celery in a bunch.

We don't see why the Puritans
picked on the Turkey for Thanksgiv
ing. The price of one of these babies
sounds like the number of the last
page in Webster's dictionary. Why not
take sea gulls, the Great Auk, or some
other bird easier to get.

There is a lot of money waiting for
the bimbo who can invent a substitute
for Turkey. Some dummy will prob
ably come out with a book pretty
quick entitled "Wasps' Ankles as a
Substitute for Salmon Eggs," or the
like. For all we know we might be
able to live on this stuff and get so fat
we would have to have our clothes
made by the same company that
makes Sells-Floto tents.

Well, what of it? Hold 'em Rover
Boys. —HACK SICKLER.
In presidential years you know,
There's nothing in the world but—
WOE!
The politicians roar ana scowl
The other gang has won
In horrid accents loud they howl,
"Prosperity is done!"
The statistician stands aghast.
The curve of lead has dropped!
His family feels the sharp contrast —
All happiness has flopped!
In several million more of years,
Geologists declaim,
The oil supply will fail, and tears
Start to their eyes what shame!
The blackest gloom depresses all.
There's not a word of cheer.
To cap it all, the brewery
Has JUST RUN OUT OF BEER!
