# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT
## 
### 
iiie Editor —Sir:
Let's not kid ourselves. The - rally
Thursday night was not a success ex
cept from one point of view: The num
ber of fellows and women who turned
out to show that the "Stanford Spirit"
was not dead. And most of them, after
they got there, found a great deal of
evidence to prove that it was dead
after all.
The rally had for its main purpose,
as announced by the chairman of the
committee, the practicing of songs and
yells for the Big Game. We practiced
—four yells and two songs, said songs
and yells being the only ones we have
heard all quarter. What's wrong with
the old "Tombstone Song," "Hail Stan
ford Hail," "The Cardinal Is Waving,"
"We're Sailing Up the Bay," "Sons of
the Stanford Red," "The Bum Bum
Song," and all the other old-timers? Is
the old "Varsity on the Kick-Off" rele
gated to the scrap heap with the rest
of our gone-but-not-forgotten rooting
features?
Professor Cottrell hit a point and
hit it hard in his talk, but we can't
get behind the team unless we have
something to get behind it with. And
four yells and two songs are hardly
enough to keep the rooters busy.
And to those who are claiming that
'28 is on the boat, it might be of
interest to know that in at least two
places on the pavilion floor there was
considerable consternation and mum
bled exclamations of "What's that?"
when "Dutch" announced "A Loco
motive," and when the "Burial Song"
was started any number of bedinked
persons fumbled in their pockets for
the words of the songs. One week be
fore the Big Game, and they don't
even know the few yells and songs we
have had!
Let's go, Rally committee, the fault
isn't all "Dutch's" by a long shot. Prac
tice and more practice on yells and
songs and more yells and songs is
what we need if we are to compete
with California. The fellows are will
ing, give them a chance. Start with
Montana, continue on Roughs' Day, the
interclass football match, and at im
promptu rallies. Ten minutes between
classes at the Law Steps or Engineer
ing Corner will help out. And at the
j rally Thursday night let's go through
| the list from beginning to end.
Then, up and at 'em on the 22nd,
i
Sincerely, A. Sombrero, '25.

'28 is on the boat, it might be of
interest to know that in at least two
places on the pavilion floor there was
considerable consternation and mum
bled exclamations of "What's that?"
when "Dutch" announced "A Loco
motive," and when the "Burial Song"
was started any number of bedinked
persons fumbled in their pockets for
the words of the songs. One week be
fore the Big Game, and they don't
even know the few yells and songs we
have had!
Let's go, Rally committee, the fault
isn't all "Dutch's" by a long shot. Prac
tice and more practice on yells and
songs and more yells and songs is
what we need if we are to compete
with California. The fellows are will
ing, give them a chance. Start with
Montana, continue on Roughs' Day, the
interclass football match, and at im
promptu rallies. Ten minutes between
classes at the Law Steps or Engineer
ing Corner will help out. And at the
j rally Thursday night let's go through
| the list from beginning to end.
Then, up and at 'em on the 22nd,

iiie Editor —Sir:
Let's not kid ourselves. The - rally
Thursday night was not a success ex
cept from one point of view: The num
ber of fellows and women who turned
out to show that the "Stanford Spirit"
was not dead. And most of them, after
they got there, found a great deal of
evidence to prove that it was dead
after all.
The rally had for its main purpose,
as announced by the chairman of the
committee, the practicing of songs and
yells for the Big Game. We practiced
—four yells and two songs, said songs
and yells being the only ones we have
heard all quarter. What's wrong with
the old "Tombstone Song," "Hail Stan
ford Hail," "The Cardinal Is Waving,"
"We're Sailing Up the Bay," "Sons of
the Stanford Red," "The Bum Bum
Song," and all the other old-timers? Is
the old "Varsity on the Kick-Off" rele
gated to the scrap heap with the rest
of our gone-but-not-forgotten rooting
features?
Professor Cottrell hit a point and
hit it hard in his talk, but we can't
get behind the team unless we have
something to get behind it with. And
four yells and two songs are hardly
enough to keep the rooters busy.
And to those who are claiming that
'28 is on the boat, it might be of
interest to know that in at least two
places on the pavilion floor there was
considerable consternation and mum
bled exclamations of "What's that?"
