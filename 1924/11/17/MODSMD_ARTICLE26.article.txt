The Editor —Sir:
May I reply to the letter signed by
J "A Chinese" in your Monday issue and
i criticizing the talk by Harry A.
I Franck. I, too, heard that lecture, but
| gained a very different impression.
Our Chinese friend says, "At the
j beginning Americans in China were
> said to be liable to capture by bandits
; at any moment, and towards the end
! they were assured that China was the
safest place for them." What Mr.
Franck really said was that he had
been warned-that China was no place
for his wife and babieß, but in actual
fact he found it safer than similar con
ditions in America. He made it quite
! clear that China's hear-say critics were
Wrong.
Our Chinese friend says, "The Chi
nese are blamed one minute for cut
ting off the heads of bandits and, at
another, were ridiculed for not cutting
j off the head of the innocent, deposed,
boy emperor." I gathered that Mr.
Franck rather regretted having the
bandits decapitated, merely since he
found those he met to be quite friend
ly and likeable. But he seemed to feel
that the treatment of the boy emperor
redounded to China's credit, and to the
discredit of those of us who did not
realize the Chinese were setting a fine
example of sane and kindly political
courtesy.
As to the "hundred independent gen
erals," he may be translating the vari
ous dialectical military terms rather
loosely. Some of them may be only
Majors or Colonels. But China under
military rule is doubUess different
from what it was when his Chinese
critic left it. As for "double-crossing,"
he missed Mr. Frank's sly inuendo
that "politics is politics" anywhere
you find 'em. It was the speaker's air
of being shocked at such a trifle com
parison with our own recent political
scandals which raised the laugh.
Mr. Franck did not call the Chinese
cowardly; he said they "wouldn't
fight," which is quite different. He ex
plained that, since "soldiering" was
not in high repute, only men of the
lower classes adopted the profession.
He then brought out the fact that this
steadfast refusal to become embroiled
is the source of China's essential sta
bility and endurance. It was a power
ful lesson in applied Christianity, as \
preached, not practiced—a "blessed j
are the meek" who mind their own j
business and keep things going while J
the brawlers kill each other off. It j
made one wonder through just what j
processes oriental public opinion set j
its face against war, even as occidental :
public opinion is turning now. War is
not the popular pastime it was a few
generations ago, but a regrettable in
terruption of more valued forms of j
human effort, and one doesn't have to
be a pacifist to say so.
I have warm friends among the
Chinese. Mr. Franck's lecture did not
lessen my regard for them, nor for
their country. It only convinced me
that a people who could keep their
sanity, their courtesy, and their sense
of humor through such vicissitudes
had a philosophy well worth studying.
It is too bad that "A Chinese" took
it too literally, but it is doubtless dif
ficult to have a flexible sense of humor
in the other fellow's language. And
certainly, right or wrong, his loyalty
is both justified and commendable.

; at any moment, and towards the end
! they were assured that China was the
safest place for them." What Mr.
Franck really said was that he had
been warned-that China was no place
for his wife and babieß, but in actual
fact he found it safer than similar con
ditions in America. He made it quite
! clear that China's hear-say critics were
Wrong.
Our Chinese friend says, "The Chi
nese are blamed one minute for cut
ting off the heads of bandits and, at
another, were ridiculed for not cutting
j off the head of the innocent, deposed,
boy emperor." I gathered that Mr.
Franck rather regretted having the
bandits decapitated, merely since he
found those he met to be quite friend
ly and likeable. But he seemed to feel
that the treatment of the boy emperor
redounded to China's credit, and to the
discredit of those of us who did not
realize the Chinese were setting a fine
example of sane and kindly political
courtesy.
As to the "hundred independent gen
erals," he may be translating the vari
ous dialectical military terms rather
loosely. Some of them may be only
Majors or Colonels. But China under
military rule is doubUess different
from what it was when his Chinese
critic left it. As for "double-crossing,"
he missed Mr. Frank's sly inuendo
that "politics is politics" anywhere
you find 'em. It was the speaker's air
of being shocked at such a trifle com
parison with our own recent political
scandals which raised the laugh.
Mr. Franck did not call the Chinese
cowardly; he said they "wouldn't
fight," which is quite different. He ex
plained that, since "soldiering" was
not in high repute, only men of the
lower classes adopted the profession.
He then brought out the fact that this
steadfast refusal to become embroiled
is the source of China's essential sta
bility and endurance. It was a power
ful lesson in applied Christianity, as \
preached, not practiced—a "blessed j
are the meek" who mind their own j
business and keep things going while J
the brawlers kill each other off. It j
made one wonder through just what j
processes oriental public opinion set j
its face against war, even as occidental :
public opinion is turning now. War is
not the popular pastime it was a few
generations ago, but a regrettable in
terruption of more valued forms of j
human effort, and one doesn't have to
be a pacifist to say so.
I have warm friends among the
Chinese. Mr. Franck's lecture did not
lessen my regard for them, nor for
their country. It only convinced me
that a people who could keep their
sanity, their courtesy, and their sense
of humor through such vicissitudes
had a philosophy well worth studying.
It is too bad that "A Chinese" took
it too literally, but it is doubtless dif
ficult to have a flexible sense of humor
in the other fellow's language. And
certainly, right or wrong, his loyalty
is both justified and commendable.
