# PEDRO LEMOS BUYS PRINTS FOR HALLS
## 
### 
Three Persian block prints, recently
brought from Europe by Pedro J.
Lemos, director of the Stanford Art
Gallery, have been hung in Roble,
Branner, and Toyon halls. Lemos
bought the prints from a Persian
dealer in the island of Malta.
Persian block prints, finer in work
manship than the East Indian prints,
are growing scarce since the handi
craft is dying out in modern Persia.
Hand blocking is believed to be the
oldest form oft printing, owing to the
fact that block prints antedating
printed books have been discovered
in India. The principle of the craft is
the basis of all modern printed tex
tiles, such as printed ginghams, voiles,
aud cretonnes.
The process is complicated, and re
quires considerable skill. The designs
are sketched in outline and cut in re
lief on blocks of wood, which are then
inked and printed on the textile by
hand. The separate colors are put on
separate blocks and the designs are
made in units by placing the block in
different positions.
Machine-made textiles are printed
by brass blocks fastened to a cylinder,
which is used over and over, being
turned and inked by machinery.
