"Keep freedom in the schools and in
tolerance out," Dr. Jordan told an audi
ence of 200 freshmen at Encina last
night. Dr. Jordan spoke on the subject
of "Science and Religion."
"Wisdom is knowing what to do next,
virtue is doing it, and religion furnishes
a reason for doing it," he said early in
his talk. Dr. Jordan then traced the
development of the present scientific sys
tem of inquiry, mentioning the preju
dices and obstacles which beset early
scholars.
Religion does not hinge on appearances,
such as the wearing of a clerical garb
and the act of attending church each Sun
day, but in the profession of faith in that
Supreme Being toward which science
seems to point. Dr. Jordan said in sum
ming up his talk.
Next Sunday evening at Encina hall
Dr. Jordan will attempt to answer all
questions which the freshmen may ask
Kim.
