# BABE SOCCER TEAM LOSES TO SAN JOSE
## 
### 
Playing a very ragged game, the fresh
man soccer team was defeated by the San
Jose Sons of St. George Saturday by a
score of 3 to 0.
The freshmen played in their own ter
ritory nearly all of the first period. The
Sons had five chances to score during
this period on corner kicks, but they
could not find the goal. After excellent
teamwork, Norman booted the ball into
the netting for the Sons' only tally dur
ing the first half. Gray, the freshman
goalkeeper, prevented several San Jose
scores by his heady work.
Wilkinson, outside right, kicked two
goals for the Sons in the last half. The
rest of the game was a back and forth
struggle between the teams. AJtliough
the freshmen backs played a good de
fensive game, the forwards did not work
together.
