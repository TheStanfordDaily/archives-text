# Special Train Will Run To Berkeley on Saturday
## 
### 
For a monetary consideration of $2
Stanford supporters will be permitted
to root and toot all the way to the Big
Game on a special train that will leave
the Southern Pacific station in Palo
7\tto at Saturday morning. The
train will proceed directly tu Berkeley
by way of the 1 Hmbarton cut-off, but
the return ticket will permit the holder
to return by the same route or by way
of San Francisco. Box lunches will be
sold on the train for 50 cents.
One thousand can be accommodated,
but if more than this number of tickets
are sold another train, which will leave
at 11:30, will be placed in service. Tickets
can be purchased any time this week at
the depot.
