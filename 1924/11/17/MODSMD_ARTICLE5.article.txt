# BREAKERS DISTANCE MEN WIN TURKEYS IN INTRAMURAL RUN
## Ranney, Encina, Is Individual Victor; L. T. Ashley of Theta Xi Second 
### 
Breakers' club will feast on tree turkey
on Thanksgiving as a result of winning
the team prize in the intramural cross
country run Saturday. C. W. Carlsmith,
G. T. Wright, and C. E. Ross made the
feed possible by finishing third, ninth,
and tenth, respectively, for the low club
total of twenty-two points.
R. P. Ranney, an Encina freshman,
led the race for individual honors, and
made it possible for his dormitory to
place second in the team standing. Dick
Warner and Marshall Sell, his mates,
placed fourteenth and fifteenth, bringing
the Encina aggregate to thirty points.
The official timekeeper credited Ran
ney with a mark of 24:44, which is
thought to be incorrect. C. W. Davis,
the starter, clocked the winner at 19:33,
and this record was verified by by
standers. Second place went to L. H.
Ashley of Theta Xi. Ranney, Ashley,
and Carlsmith were awarded gold, silver,
and bronze medals.
El Campo, last year's winner, was
forced to content itself with third posi
tion in the group totals, its best three
runners, Claude Paris, Ted Hazeltine,
and Norman Jones, aggregating thirty
eight markers. Beta Theta Pi looked
to be a cinch to win the birds when Ack
Briggs and Edson Waterhouse romped
in fourth and fifth, but it lost out on
account of lacking a third man to com
plete the team.
The majority of the contestants fin
ished in good shape, the leaders having
enough wind left to sprint the last fifty
yards.
