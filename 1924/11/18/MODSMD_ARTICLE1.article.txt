# ROOTERS SET FOR BIG GAME RALLY TOMORROW NIGHT
## Warner Will Take Football Squad Into Seclusion After Bonfire 
### 
The annual Big Game rally with
talks, entertainment, and cheering of
the howling Cardinal rooters takes
place at 7:15 tomorrow night In the
pavilion and will be immediately fol
lowed by the huge bonfire.
After this the varsity football squad
will leave the campus and go into se
clusion until the morning of the Big
Game. "Pop" Warner and his charges
will be present at the rally and mem
bers of the squad will give the team's
outlook on the game that will decide
the championship of the Pacific Coast
Conference.
Alonzo Taylor, of the Food Research
department, and Charles Cutten, '99,
will be the speakers of the evening.
These men will come representing the
faculty and alumni respectively and
will tell how those whom they repre
sent feel toward the Big Game.
The serpentine starts at 7 o'clock
from the Phi Gamma Delta house. All
men students must come down the
line of march and into the pavilion
with the serpentine or they will be re
fused admission. J. E. McDowell,
alumni secretary, has twenty-five tick
ets on hand for anyone physically in
capacitated.
These tickets will be given out on
application to him along with four j
hundred others. There will be two
hundred for the faculty and their fami
lies and two hundred for the alumni.
The Graduate Manager's office is
also handling tickets for the rally.
Four hundred of these are for the
graduate block men, twenty-five for
the Board of Trustees, and twenty-five
for members of the Board of Athletic
Control.
Doors Open at 7:15
The members of the rally committee
have a few tickets that they will dis
tribute among those they feel have a
sufficiently justifiable cause. All of
these tickets are good until 7:15 only,
for at that time the doors will be
thrown open to the public.
Women will be admitted to the
pavilion by the east entrance only.
They will not require tickets as stu
dent cards admit them.
Immediately following the rally talks
and the songs and yells, the entire
party will serpentine over to the bon
fire. There have been no limitations
placed on the amount of yelling and
cheering and no doubt the old familiar
"To hell with the Gold and Blue" will
reign supreme on the circling tour of
the blazing pyre.
The huge bonfire being constructed
by the freshmen is rapidly approach
ing sixty-five feet in height and the
construction committee promises the j
largest and highest blaze for many |
years.
The Rally committee has completed
its plans for the Big Game bleacher i
stunts. The members will leave the
campus early Friday morning for the I
stadium across the bay where they j
will spend Friday and Saturday morn-1
ing in preparing the bleachers for the j
rooting section.
