# ROUGHS TO STAGE FALL CELEBRATION
## Beards, Old Clothes Will Predominate on Campus Tomorrow Morning 
### 
Queer costumes, old clothes, beards,
and chief of all hilarity will reign
; supreme tomorrow when the rougher
sex of the University will stage its
annual Roughs* Day. The celebration
will be a fitting forerunner to the Big
| Game Rally tomorrow night, and in
directly it will serve as a pep gener
ator for the West's greatest football
I game.
Last year regulations were placed
i on the activities by Men's Council, and
there were many who are skeptical as
I to the success of a Roughs' Day with
| out a maximum amount of rowdiness.
| However, any pessimistic ideas that
: were held were no doubt obliterated by
the actual outcome of the affair. Al
though no water wagons were stolen,
110 men masqueraded in women's
clothes, no professors were ridiculed,
! and no women were molested, the day
i served its purpose which is primarily
j to build up copious quantities of "pep."
Under Senior Control
This year the occasion will be under
the same regulations as last year. The
Senior Board of Control has been as
signed the duty of enforcing the rules
laid down by Men's Council. Last year
when the faculty threatened to abolish
Roughs' Day permanently from the
fall social calendar, this board was
formed. The members guaranteed that
if they were given full control they
could preserve the institution.
On behalf of the Senior Board of
Control of which he is chairman, W.
James Dickey makes the following ap
peal: "The Men's Council has drawn
up a set of rules to guide the board in
its actions, but these are insufficient.
They will provide grounds for the pun
ishment of offenders, but in order to
preserve the day and make it really
worth while the committee must have
the hearty co-operation of every mem
ber of the student body. Remember
that the fate of Roughs' Day hangs in
balance this year."
