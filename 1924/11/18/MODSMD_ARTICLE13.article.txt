# FRESHMEN MAY TAKE BLUE DUNGAREES AS TRADITIONAL ATTIRE
## 
### 
Will the freshman class adopt blue
dungarees as the dress peculiar to
their class? This is the question now
being discussed among the inhabitants
of Encina hall and some are so far in
favor of it that they are making a
petition to this effect which will be
circulated among the members of the
class.
"Jim" Sapero, president of the fresh
man class, has expressed himself as
favoring the proposition but says that
the matter is one to be discussed by
the class as a whole at its next meet
ing which may be held sometime this
week. Adliernts of the proposition say
that, a more democratic spirit and a
larger degree of class spirit would be
fostered by the innovation.
However there is a considerable
number who oppose the idea —and
some quite vehemently—but how large
this number is can only be determined
at the next class meeting.
Dean Culver, when asked for his
opinion on the matter, suggested that
those who favored the blue dungarees
go ahead and wear thom and the other
members of the class might in time
fall into the spirit of the matter.
