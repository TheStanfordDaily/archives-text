# Convalescent Home Is Special Charity Of Stanford Students
## 
### 
Situated at the old Leland Stanford
place, endowed by the University, an
activity of University women, and of
all students on the annual Labor Day,
the Convalescent Home for Children is
Stanford's special charity.
Forty children can be accommodated
and the place is usually full to capa
city. The patients are generally heart,
pneumonia, bronchitis, malnutrition, or
after-operation cases sent down from
Lane and other city hospitals to re
cuperate here where they can get
country air and good food. Their stay
usually lasts three months, when they
are returned to their homes better
able to cope with city conditions.
Twenty are bed patients, housed in the
new Kate McLaughlin Unit which was
completed last year, the gift of Mrs.
! Henry Crocker. Twenty more are ac-
I commodated in the original building.
! On account of the new facilities, which
doubled the capacity of the home, and
provided means for the care of bed
patients, some cases are now accepted
from the start. Dental work is now also
done at the home.

The Convalescent Home is run on
the University endowment, and on an
allotment from the Community Chest
of San Francisco. Four nurses from
the Stanford Lane Hospital are on the
staff. All the children bring with them
when they come is shoes, toothbrush,
and toys.
Some toys have been donated from
time to time for general use, while a
playground with a tree-house and all
the apparatus found in city play
grounds was the recent gift of Mrs.
R. F. Moore of Menlo Park. Clothes
are collected and made over by a
group of Palo Alto women, who have
an important task but 110 funds. Here
after some of the money from the Com
munity Chest will be used for buying
coveralls and shoes, when patients ar
rive without them. But it is not the
active children who need the most at
tention in the matter of clothes. Bed
paients are apt to spend their idle
moments in hacking and cutting.
Bodily improvement is not tho only
j achievement of the Convalescent
