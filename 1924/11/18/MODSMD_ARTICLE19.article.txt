# OPTIMISM CARD BY-WORD; ALIBIS NOT NECESSARY
## California Assumes Under-Dog Complex; Tut Imlay Injured 
### David Meiklejohn 
Giving Stanford credit for niofe than
the Cardinal teams were worth has
been the favorite sport in past sea
sons. Pick up any file of the Daily
Palo Alto since American football was
re-introduced in 1919 and you will col
lapse reading the innumerable list of
alibis and apple sauce.
Alibi-ing began to take on more of
a moderate form last year, and this
year it will have to cease or it will
become a bad habit; for Stanford no
longer has any need for the parasitical
creatures —alibis —and the sooner the
"fighting spirit," the "we'll win next
years," and "we'd have won if he
hadn't fumbled" -complexes are elimi
nated, the freer some will breathe.
Optimism Prevails
Optimism is the spirit in general
that prevails, and while to say right
out and out that Stanford will beat
California might cause a little horse
laughing, this is probably Sanford's
first opportunity to hang the Golden
Bear's hide in the Memorial Court,
where it will be memorable indeed.
At California at the present time
