# OPTIMISM CARD BY-WORD; ALIBIS NOT NECESSARY
## California Assumes Under-Dog Complex; Tut Imlay Injured 
### David Meiklejohn 
Giving Stanford credit for niofe than
the Cardinal teams were worth has
been the favorite sport in past sea
sons. Pick up any file of the Daily
Palo Alto since American football was
re-introduced in 1919 and you will col
lapse reading the innumerable list of
alibis and apple sauce.
Alibi-ing began to take on more of
a moderate form last year, and this
year it will have to cease or it will
become a bad habit; for Stanford no
longer has any need for the parasitical
creatures —alibis —and the sooner the
"fighting spirit," the "we'll win next
years," and "we'd have won if he
hadn't fumbled" -complexes are elimi
nated, the freer some will breathe.
Optimism Prevails
Optimism is the spirit in general
that prevails, and while to say right
out and out that Stanford will beat
California might cause a little horse
laughing, this is probably Sanford's
first opportunity to hang the Golden
Bear's hide in the Memorial Court,
where it will be memorable indeed.
At California at the present time
there is a great deal of the under-dog
spirit—California enjoys being the
under-dog—and there is good cause.
"Tut" Imlay, star California backfield
man, probably never felt worse in his
life than he does right now. Imlay re
turned from the Washington game
with one whole side of his body pretty
badly smashed up. Just what the loss
of Imlay will mean to the Bears, if it
will mean that at all, is hard to say.
Imlay is by far the most consistent
man in the backfield, the most clever,
the most versatile, and the most de
pendable. He outranks even Jimmy
Dixon in importance at present.
Walter Camp is looking for a few
all-American possibilities on either
Stanford's or California's team, and
that means "Babe" Horrell, California
captain and best center on the coast,
is going to light the fireworks early
and keep up a sixty-minute celebra
tion which might call for a little
heated resistance.

become a bad habit; for Stanford no
longer has any need for the parasitical
creatures —alibis —and the sooner the
"fighting spirit," the "we'll win next
years," and "we'd have won if he
hadn't fumbled" -complexes are elimi
nated, the freer some will breathe.
Optimism Prevails
Optimism is the spirit in general
that prevails, and while to say right
out and out that Stanford will beat
California might cause a little horse
laughing, this is probably Sanford's
first opportunity to hang the Golden
Bear's hide in the Memorial Court,
where it will be memorable indeed.
At California at the present time
there is a great deal of the under-dog
spirit—California enjoys being the
under-dog—and there is good cause.
"Tut" Imlay, star California backfield
man, probably never felt worse in his
life than he does right now. Imlay re
turned from the Washington game
with one whole side of his body pretty
badly smashed up. Just what the loss
of Imlay will mean to the Bears, if it
will mean that at all, is hard to say.
Imlay is by far the most consistent
man in the backfield, the most clever,
the most versatile, and the most de
pendable. He outranks even Jimmy
Dixon in importance at present.
Walter Camp is looking for a few
all-American possibilities on either
Stanford's or California's team, and
that means "Babe" Horrell, California
captain and best center on the coast,
is going to light the fireworks early
and keep up a sixty-minute celebra
tion which might call for a little
heated resistance.
