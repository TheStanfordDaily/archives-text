# ANNUAL RED CROSS MEMBERSHIP DRIVE NOW IN PROGRESS
## 
### 
Today started the annual Red Cross
Roll Call on the campus, to be con
tinued the rest of this week. The
membership campaign is conducted
every year from Armistice Day to
Thanksgiving; enrollment means that
the donor desires to show his interest
in furthering the work of the American
Red Cross, our national agent for the
performance of relief service.
Since half of each enrollment dol
lar goes to the Palo Alto chapter, it
is of interest to know what has been
its activity. A report was read on
Monday, November 10, by Mrs. J. W.
Mitchell, chairman of the home service
section. The particular work of the
Palo Alto unit has been aid to families
of ex-service men at the Veterans'
hospital No. 24. The Red Cross takes
into consideration whether the case is
result of the war and whether a man
has received a compensation or not
and how he has used it before amelior
ating the condition of the family. The
comfort of these men whose broken
health has brought them to the Vet
erans' hospital is also the concern of
the Red Cross.
All Red Cross chapters administer
relief in cases of emergency in the
community. Loans and grants are
made after investigation and meal
orders sometimes issued. Other char
ity organizations have co-operated
with the chapter in the provision of
Thanksgiving dinners. Red Cross
rooms aj*e the center for the distribu
tion of toys, clothes, and other dona
tions.
Fifty cents of each membership fee
jgoes to the national Red Cross organi
zation for maintenance of regular ac
tivities like hygiene work and for re
lief in disaster both here and abroad.
