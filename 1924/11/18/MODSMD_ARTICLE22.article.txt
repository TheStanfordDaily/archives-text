# Roughs vs. Toughs
## 
### 
Roughs' Day will be held tomorrow —not precisely as in the past, let us
hope, but at least observing the skeleton of former proceedings. It is not
seemly for the observance to go much further than the skeleton, and such
exaggeration is not held probable.
In former times, Roughs' Day might better have been styled Toughs'
Day. The bearded gent of yesterday and the day before was prone to
remember only the fact that a Big Game was coming up and that he was
staking his shirt on the outcome. Often he removed the shirt permaturely
to increase the illusion, which was not very terrible, but some of the
roughs were heavier bettors than that. And commonly our predecessors
thought nothing but football and burlesque, forgetting that professors
have customs which should be respected, that our Five Hundred are
entitled to consideration, and that there are things which simply are not
done. The result was the ultimate all-including bunk.
It was deemed best, and rightly, that the student memory be jogged
a little on these points. The result is that we now have our Roughs' Day
under the standards of common courtesy and decency, enforced from
without by necessity rather than from within, as would be ideal. As a
whole, the student body is not being "regulated," but only those few who
invariably crop up to go the limit and a little bit more.
