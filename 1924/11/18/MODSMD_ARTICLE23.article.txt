Beginning soon, the Daily will print a series of articles, dealing with
the hobbies, enthusiasms, and next-to-the-heart interests of a number of
our Stanford faculty members. The length and quality of the-series will
depend upon the co-operation and confessions of these professors, as will
its success.
Perhaps we often lose sight of the fact that old Umph does something
besides lecture and correct papers; we forget that he is really a human
being. Perhaps if we discover that he nourishes a secret passion for
cross-word puzzles, or Mexican jumping beans, or cigar-store coupons,
we may be able to drink in his words with more appreciation of the fact
that he is one of us, only older and with more sense.
It is with this hope that the Daily is conducting a fairly apibitious
project for a college newspaper—an "investigation" of Jhe Stanford
faculty.

DO YOUR Thursday studying early—there's a rally tomorrow evening
