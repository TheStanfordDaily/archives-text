# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT
## 
### 
The Editor —Sir:
To anyone who was at the game
Saturday, I believe the fact became
apparent that if there is. anything
wrong with our cheering, the fault
lies with a few in the rooting section
and not with the yell-leaders.
I say a few because I hope that in a
Stanford rooting section there can't
be any great number of crabbers and
"wise-crackers." That there are a few
was proved to all who sat in the
stands Saturday.
There are always those who pipe
off on any occasion afforded. That
can bo expected anywhere. The one
thing that isn't expected or welcomed
is the presence of a group of crabbers,
especially in a Stanford rooting sec
tion. There were scattered throughout
the section some "would-be yell-lead
ers" who persisted in informing
"Dutch" the moments they thought
opportune to yell. They seemed to be
lieve themselves delegated to shower
down their suggestions of what to yell
and when to yell. What was conspicu
ously lacking on their part was any
demonstration of how to yell. If they
devoted ha# the energy they displayed
in telling "Dutch" how to lead yells,
in really rooting, the volume of our
cheers would be considerably in
creased.
It is my opinion that a big majority
of the rooters are strongly behind
"Dutch" and have confidence in his
ability and in his discretion of when
and what to yell. There is nothing
worse in an organized rooting section
than a bunch of "would-be" yell-lead

ers continually piping off worthless
suggestions. "Dutch" is a fellow who
would welcome suggestions that would
improve the rooting, but it is a mighty
poor place to offer them at a game.
The changes he has made in the
yells, I believe, are good, and make
them much more effective. He has cer
tainly proved that he is working hard
for a better rooting section. If these
few would wise up and "get-on-the
boat," I am confident that "Dutch" can
put across some of the best rooting
heard around here for some time. All
he needs is co-operation from the
rooters.
In an organized rooting section the
yell-leaders' instruction should be
obeyed. When they hold up their hands
for silence their signal should have
some effect. Unorganized singing and
yelling in the rooting section certainly
sounds poor and small-townish. Next
Saturday, we have to compete against
three times our number and we have
to show more organization and co
operation if we expect to succeed.
"Dutch" McCallister and his assist
ants are as good as yell-leaders could
be wished for. All they need is the co
operation of the rooters and the Stan
ford rooting section, Saturday, can
share a triumph with the varsity.
If these few "wise-crackers" and
fault-finders can't change their disposi
tions by Saturday, I would like to sug
gest that they sit elsewhere than the
rooting section and allow us to be
[ 100 per cent behind "Dutch" and to
j show some genuine Stanford spirit.
