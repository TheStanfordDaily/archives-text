# THE 						LAW STEPS

4- V. G. D. ;
Jay O'Brian, the ex-jockey who is
to marry Mrs. Fleischman in Paris,
wonders why he is of enough import
ance to have the newspapers talking
about him. He forgets that yeast raises i
things above their natural level.
"A fool cannot be an actor, though j
an actor may act a fool's part," once
said Sophocles; and Sophocles was
wise.
"Activity is the presence of function,
—character is the record of function."
What mountains of character some i
of us must be!
Sunday night supper->-that one woe
ful time when queeners rule, and the
unqueened dwell in anguish! Our fer
vent prayer is that there will be no
Sunday supper in heaven; it won't
hurt the queeners to go without it, and
will save us infinite pain.
There is no such thing as Fate, and
no such thing as Luck; but most de
cidedly there Is a law of action and
reaction. A certain set of thoughts and
their expression will bring about reac
tions as definite as the rising of the
sun in the East and its setting in the
West.
The fact that most of us are too
lazy to stir up our wills into governing
thought is the most pitiful thing in the
world. Just drifting, letting the profes
sors knock us first into one thing and
then into* another, while the world
"eats up" the scandalous news the
press gives it about us.
Are the colleges and universities
wholly spineless—except in football?
Trying to understand people is in
teresting for awhile but it proves a
weary sport when they try to explain
themselves thus:
"If I myself upon a looser Creed
Have loosely strung the Jewel of
Good deed,
Let this one thing for my Atonement
plead:
That One for Two I never did mis
read."
Well, we are glad to hear that Paris
is wearing its hats on the back of its
heads. Perhaps, before long, you will
be able to watch the face of the girl
I who sits next to you in Professor
I Hulme's history class.
