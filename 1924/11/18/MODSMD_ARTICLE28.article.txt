The Editor—Sir:
"Clean-up of Student Life!" "College
Traditions Bared": a few samples of
what stares more and more frequently
from the front pages
No wonder we become increasingly
hesitant about proclaiming ourselves
"college students" in the world out
side. Not only does a University di
ploma seem to be something to over
come in business circles, a thing which
symbolizes egotism to the nth degree,
the ultimate of "what the well-dressed
man is wearing," and a brain full of
superfluity with room for nothing
more —but now it seems to signify
having lived four years in a commun
ity existing amidst unmentionable con
ditions —which, strange to say, are fre
quently mentioned in the most vivid
term as "head-liners" in newspapers.
And still colleges everywhere are
being forced to build additions to ac
commodate the increasing deluge of
freshmen which pour down, with all
the qualit+es of a spring rain upon
them, each year. When will the public

begin to react to the caricatures and
flaming scandal of "college life" in
1 any other form than increasing univer
sity registration? If we are so com
pletely a product of frivolity and im
morality why does the public continue
to risk its infants in such a manner?
