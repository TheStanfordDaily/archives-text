# Resident Alumnae to Have Tea in Clubhouse Tomorrow
## 
### 
Resident alumnae will hold their
weekly tea tomorrow afternoon at 4:15
in the Women's Clubhouse. A charge
of 25 cents a person will be made,
which will go toward paying off the
Clubhouse, debt.
More University women are urged
by the committee in charge to come
to the teas. At the last meeting of the
Clubhouse Board it was decided to
have a separate room for the under
graduate women if they desired it, in
order that they might not feel con
spicuous by coming in Quad clothes.
Refreshments consisting of sand
wiches, cake, and tea are to be served.
