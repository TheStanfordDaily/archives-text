# FRESHMAN HOCKEY SQUAD WILL MEET SENIORS TOMORROW
## First-Year Squad Has Wealth Of Good Material for Initial Game 
### 
Freshman and senior hockey teams
I will make their first fight for the inter
; class championship, when they meet
at 4:15 tomorrow afternoon on the
field by Roble gym.
The freshmen have unusually good
| material for a first-year team, which
is always greatly hampered by inex
perience. According to their coach,
Miss Helen Masters Bunting, they have
a greater number of good individual
players this year than any other fresh
man team she has coached at Stanford.
Dorothy Cone, left inside, Frances
Clancy, center forward, and Aileen
Brown, right wing, show unusual abil
ity in the forward line. Dorothea Haw
kins, Elizabeth Blakewell, and Edith
Mattson are the outstanding players
on the half-back line. Frances Clancy
was elected freshman captain at the
last practice of the squad.
The '25 team has a fairly strong for
ward line, but its backfield is not as
strong as it was last year. They have
a number of new players, and the
team-work is not always as speedy as
is usual in a fourth-year team. Mar
garet Watson, captain and center for
ward, Davis, right inside,
are both outstanding players on the
forward line, and were all-star players
last year.
The line-ups will probably be as
follows:
Freshmen: Aileen Brown, right wing;
Emmabelle Hagen, right inside; Fran
ces Clancy (captain), center forward;
Dorothy Cone, left inside; Elizabeth
Blakewell, right half; Winifred Hunt
ingdon, left fullback; Dorothea Haw

Freshman and senior hockey teams
I will make their first fight for the inter
; class championship, when they meet
at 4:15 tomorrow afternoon on the
field by Roble gym.
The freshmen have unusually good
| material for a first-year team, which
is always greatly hampered by inex
perience. According to their coach,
Miss Helen Masters Bunting, they have
a greater number of good individual
players this year than any other fresh
man team she has coached at Stanford.
Dorothy Cone, left inside, Frances
Clancy, center forward, and Aileen
Brown, right wing, show unusual abil
ity in the forward line. Dorothea Haw
kins, Elizabeth Blakewell, and Edith
Mattson are the outstanding players
on the half-back line. Frances Clancy
was elected freshman captain at the
last practice of the squad.
The '25 team has a fairly strong for
ward line, but its backfield is not as
strong as it was last year. They have
a number of new players, and the
team-work is not always as speedy as
is usual in a fourth-year team. Mar
garet Watson, captain and center for
ward, Davis, right inside,
are both outstanding players on the
forward line, and were all-star players
last year.
The line-ups will probably be as
follows:
Freshmen: Aileen Brown, right wing;
Emmabelle Hagen, right inside; Fran
ces Clancy (captain), center forward;
Dorothy Cone, left inside; Elizabeth
Blakewell, right half; Winifred Hunt
ingdon, left fullback; Dorothea Haw
kins, center half; Edith Mattson, left
fullback; Frances Watson, left half
back; Carolyn Grossman and Eliza
beth Stall, alternating at goal. Sub
