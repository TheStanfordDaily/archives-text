The first day of the Rummage Sale
for the benefit of the Stanford Con
valescent Home was a decided suc
cess, according to Mrs. Robert S.
Moore, who is in charge of the affair.
The sale opened at 10 a.m., Monday,
at the Menlo Park Hotel. It will con
tinue through Friday, the hours being
10 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily.
Men's clothing, women's gowns and
coats, hats, shoes, glassware, pictures,
books â€”everything goes in the annual
rummage sale. All profits go to the
Convalescent Home.
Last year approximately $1300 was
cleared by the sale. This year more
rummage has been secured and all in
dications are that the committee in
charge will be able to reach the quota
which it has set, $2000.
In addition to Mrs. Moore the com
mittee consists of Mrs. A. E. Roth,
Mrs. A. G. C. Hahn, Mrs. Ira S. Lillick,
and Mrs. Timothy Hopkins.
