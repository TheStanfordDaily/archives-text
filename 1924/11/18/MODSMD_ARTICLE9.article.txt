# CHAPARRAL COVER IS BY SWINNERTON
## Extra Copies of Big Game Issue Obtainable by Application 
### A. B. Post 
For the first time in his long and
hilarious career the Old Boy confesses
himself completely up against it. He
will be befuddled, beskootched, and
bedamned if he can find tfords to do
justice to his latest and most magnifi
cent brain child, the Big Game issue
j of Chappie, which will make its bow
I Friday morning.
| First of all, there is the cover by
Jimmie Swinnerton, honorary member
! of Hammer and Coffin and nationally
1 famous artist and cartoonist. Swinner
j ton is best known as the creator of
! "Little Jimmie" and the "Canyon Kid
dies," but he is equally skilled with
the brush. His paintings of western
landscapes have drawn universal com
i mendation from critics.
Swinnerton's masterpiece in red,
blue, and black is only a tantalizer
which whets the imagination for the
good things to come. Mrs. Walter
Camp has penned for the exclusive
delectation of Chappie's readers an
article naming a women's ail-American
eleven which she claims would shape
up well against the Bears. An anony
mous genius has written an expose of
the terrible insidiousness of halitosis.
With these meager hints the Ancient
One shut up like a clam.
