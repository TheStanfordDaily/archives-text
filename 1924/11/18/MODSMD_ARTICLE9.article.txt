# CHAPARRAL COVER IS BY SWINNERTON
## Extra Copies of Big Game Issue Obtainable by Application 
### A. B. Post 
For the first time in his long and
hilarious career the Old Boy confesses
himself completely up against it. He
will be befuddled, beskootched, and
bedamned if he can find tfords to do
justice to his latest and most magnifi
cent brain child, the Big Game issue
j of Chappie, which will make its bow
I Friday morning.
| First of all, there is the cover by
Jimmie Swinnerton, honorary member
! of Hammer and Coffin and nationally
1 famous artist and cartoonist. Swinner
j ton is best known as the creator of
! "Little Jimmie" and the "Canyon Kid
dies," but he is equally skilled with
the brush. His paintings of western
landscapes have drawn universal com
i mendation from critics.
Swinnerton's masterpiece in red,
blue, and black is only a tantalizer
which whets the imagination for the
good things to come. Mrs. Walter
Camp has penned for the exclusive
delectation of Chappie's readers an
article naming a women's ail-American
eleven which she claims would shape
up well against the Bears. An anony
mous genius has written an expose of
the terrible insidiousness of halitosis.
With these meager hints the Ancient
One shut up like a clam.
He jumped out the window a mo
ment later, however, to give out the
dope on his latest act of beneficence.
In view of the fact that all previous
Big Game issues have been sold out
completely before the faculty and
students could obtain sufficient copies,
the Old Boy has caused double the
usual number of books to be printed
this year in order to prevent a repeti
tion of this misfortune.
Any man, woman, or child, whether
subscriber or non-subscriber, who
wishes extra copies, may reserve them
by dropping a note to the Chaparral
office. Box 15, Campus, giving his oi
lier name and address and the number
of copies wanted. A check for the pro
per amount should be included. No
orders will be received after 1 o'clock
Thursday. Books so reserved will be
distributed at the postoffice Friday
morning.
Chappie announced that there would
be no raise in price for the Big Game
issue but that the regular price of
thirty cents would be exacted.
Music Scnool freshmen at North
western have been granted sophomore
privileges for this semester.

by dropping a note to the Chaparral
office. Box 15, Campus, giving his oi
lier name and address and the number
of copies wanted. A check for the pro
per amount should be included. No
orders will be received after 1 o'clock
Thursday. Books so reserved will be
distributed at the postoffice Friday
morning.
Chappie announced that there would
be no raise in price for the Big Game
issue but that the regular price of
thirty cents would be exacted.
Music Scnool freshmen at North
western have been granted sophomore
privileges for this semester.
For the first time in his long and
hilarious career the Old Boy confesses
himself completely up against it. He
will be befuddled, beskootched, and
bedamned if he can find tfords to do
justice to his latest and most magnifi
cent brain child, the Big Game issue
j of Chappie, which will make its bow
I Friday morning.
| First of all, there is the cover by
Jimmie Swinnerton, honorary member
! of Hammer and Coffin and nationally
1 famous artist and cartoonist. Swinner
j ton is best known as the creator of
! "Little Jimmie" and the "Canyon Kid
dies," but he is equally skilled with
the brush. His paintings of western
landscapes have drawn universal com
i mendation from critics.
Swinnerton's masterpiece in red,
blue, and black is only a tantalizer
which whets the imagination for the
good things to come. Mrs. Walter
Camp has penned for the exclusive
delectation of Chappie's readers an
article naming a women's ail-American
eleven which she claims would shape
up well against the Bears. An anony
mous genius has written an expose of
the terrible insidiousness of halitosis.
With these meager hints the Ancient
One shut up like a clam.
He jumped out the window a mo
ment later, however, to give out the
dope on his latest act of beneficence.
In view of the fact that all previous
Big Game issues have been sold out
completely before the faculty and
students could obtain sufficient copies,
the Old Boy has caused double the
usual number of books to be printed
this year in order to prevent a repeti
tion of this misfortune.
Any man, woman, or child, whether
subscriber or non-subscriber, who
wishes extra copies, may reserve them
