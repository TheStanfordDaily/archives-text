IT'S THE CUT OF YOUR CLOTHES THAT COUNTsj
*
Campus Logic What more log
ical than the loose, full, easy-to-wear
clothes you see on the campus? They
express the freedom, the informality
of college life. They belong. It is there
fore a matter of infinite pains with us
to select the cut that our college cus
tomers recognize instantly as the thing.
No compromise; college clothes for
college men.
