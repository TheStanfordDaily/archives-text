# VARSITY ELEVEN HONORED GUESTS AT GAME RALLY
## Cards in Good Condition with Exception of Ernie Nevers, Thomas 
### David Meiklejohn 
It was announced this noon by
Dr. T. M. Williams that Ernie
Nevers fractured his right ankle
in the Montana game* last Satur
day. The broken bone was put in
a cast at the Palo Alto hospital
this morning, and it is a certainty
that the big fullback will witness
the Big Game on crutches.
The previously-fractured left
ankle is in good shape, and had it
not been for the Montana injury
Nevers would have been physically
fit on November 22.

"Pop" Warner, his coaching staff,
and the varsity football eleven will be
the honored guests of the most stu
pendous and colorful rally of the col
lege year tonight, after which trucks
will pack the men away to some quiet
recess in the mountains to rest* for the
Big Game Saturday.
Several years of Big Games and de
feats —some overwhelming, some close
—have left the students somewhat
hungry for victory, and this season it
looks as if Stanford had the sights
well adjusted on the Golden Bear,
which no longer stands on the high
peak "Wonder Team," but on level
ground with the Redshirt, where battle
can be justly done.
In Good Condition
The Stanford team, with two excep
tions, is in good condition. Nevers is
definitely out of the game, and the
presence of Thomas in the line-up
is something that conjecture and
"Pop" Warner probably cannot authen
ticate.
At California the Golden ones are
seniors and holdovers are to be on
guard.
No definite time to light the pyre 4s
being planned. As soon as the serpen
tine leaves the pavilion the torches
will be applied and another cremation
of the Bruin spirit will have begun.
Yesterday noon the men from Se
quoia hall bore the Bear's coffin, heav
ily laden with floral decorations,
across the campus to the library,
where short services were conducted.
The coffin was hoisted to the top of
the pyre this morning in preparation
for tonight's cremation.
Last year the night of the bonfire
and rally was changed from Thursday
to Wednesday because the team plan
ned to go into seclusion a day earlier.
Feeling the presence of the team to
be an important factor in the rally, the
committee moved the date a day for
ward and the succeeding committee
followed the same idea. •
No doubt this custom will be fol
lowed as long as the team decides to
leave the campus at this early date.

Northwestern University is estab
lishing a new literary magazine which
will be the size of the standard month
ly publications. It will be "literary"
but not "highbrow" in tone.

recess in the mountains to rest* for the
Big Game Saturday.
Several years of Big Games and de
feats —some overwhelming, some close
—have left the students somewhat
hungry for victory, and this season it
looks as if Stanford had the sights
well adjusted on the Golden Bear,
which no longer stands on the high
peak "Wonder Team," but on level
ground with the Redshirt, where battle
can be justly done.
In Good Condition
The Stanford team, with two excep
tions, is in good condition. Nevers is
definitely out of the game, and the
presence of Thomas in the line-up
is something that conjecture and
"Pop" Warner probably cannot authen
ticate.
At California the Golden ones are
seniors and holdovers are to be on
guard.
No definite time to light the pyre 4s
being planned. As soon as the serpen
tine leaves the pavilion the torches
will be applied and another cremation
of the Bruin spirit will have begun.
Yesterday noon the men from Se
quoia hall bore the Bear's coffin, heav
ily laden with floral decorations,
across the campus to the library,
where short services were conducted.
The coffin was hoisted to the top of
the pyre this morning in preparation
for tonight's cremation.
Last year the night of the bonfire
and rally was changed from Thursday
to Wednesday because the team plan
ned to go into seclusion a day earlier.
Feeling the presence of the team to
be an important factor in the rally, the
committee moved the date a day for
ward and the succeeding committee
followed the same idea. •
No doubt this custom will be fol
lowed as long as the team decides to
leave the campus at this early date.

Northwestern University is estab
lishing a new literary magazine which
will be the size of the standard month
ly publications. It will be "literary"
but not "highbrow" in tone.
It was announced this noon by
Dr. T. M. Williams that Ernie
Nevers fractured his right ankle
in the Montana game* last Satur
day. The broken bone was put in
a cast at the Palo Alto hospital
this morning, and it is a certainty
that the big fullback will witness
the Big Game on crutches.
The previously-fractured left
ankle is in good shape, and had it
not been for the Montana injury
Nevers would have been physically
fit on November 22.

"Pop" Warner, his coaching staff,
and the varsity football eleven will be
the honored guests of the most stu
pendous and colorful rally of the col
lege year tonight, after which trucks
will pack the men away to some quiet
recess in the mountains to rest* for the
Big Game Saturday.
