Hotch-Hetchy reservoir, at the up
per end of San Francisco's new water
supply system, could supply the entire
city for ten years without ever being
refilled, according to C. R. Rankin,
chief engineer/for the project. Mr.
Rankin addressed the Civil Engineer
ing Society last night at the home of
Professor L. B. Reynolds, describing
the work that has been done on the
project up to the present time.
The pipe line which will carry the
water down to the city will cross the
Bay at Dumbarton, near Dumbarton
bridge. It will pass through Redwood
! tunnel to Spring Valley lakes, the pres
| ont source of supply, which has be
j come inadequate.
