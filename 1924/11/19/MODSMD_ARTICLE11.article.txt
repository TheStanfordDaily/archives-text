# HOBBIES OF THE FACULTY
## NO. 1. COMPTROLLER A. E. ROTH 
### Hulda Hoover 
"My advice to all entering freshmen
is to take up hunting and get caught
in a forest fire if possible," said Comp
troller A. E. Roth, who claims that the
| only reason he passed the English 1
j "ex" was because the â€¢ composition
' about how lie was trapped and nar
rowly escaped death by a forest fire
was so thrilling that the corrector did
not bother about the spelling or gram
mar.
Hunting is an avocation at which
Roth is markedly proficient. He shot
his first buck when he was twelve
1 years old but his experiences along
! this line date back further than this
to a time when he was very young in
deed. Having been left to guard the

' svoineii at camp while the men went
hunting he heard fearsome noises is
suing from the surrounding darkness,
so, heavily armed and very excited he
kept vigil until the men returned. In
vestigation proved that trees in the
wind and not wolves were responsible.
For the last five years Roth has gone
on a short hunting trip and has in
every case come back with a bnck.
"They just seem to get in my way"
was his modest explanation of the fact.
Roth has quite a collection of tro
i phies and is building a log cabin five
miles back of Capitola into which he
will move some of them when they get
! too numerous for strictly decorative
1 purposes at home.

All students who have not se
cured their tickets for the Big
Game at the Administration build
ing before tomorrow afternoon at 5
o'clock will forfeit all rights to the
precious slips, according to an an
nouncement from the Ticket de

But few students have applied
for their tickets up to date. They
have been at the Administration
building since Monday.
The hours for securing the tickets

morning, and 1 to 5 o'clock in the
afternoon.
