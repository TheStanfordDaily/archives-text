"TO HELL WITH THE GOLD AND BLUE"
AGAIN the Stanford supporters are rallying 011 the eve of the Big Game
to demonstrate that they are behind the team to a man and that they
are not overconfident.
Tonight is the night that all individual differences are blended into a well
organized mass of vociferous rooters and the entire assemblage will work
under McCallister as a single unit.
When the serpentine has wound its way down the row, past the halls, and
into the pavilion, preceded by the Stanford band, one of the largest and most
enthusiastic rallies in years will have begun, according to all advance indica

parents, and those physically incapaci

is distributing tickets to former block
S men and to University officials.
All rooters in the serpentine will be
admitted in a body without any spe
cial arrangements. Women will be ad
mitted on their student cards but only
at the east gate of the pavilion.
The entire team will be at the rally
and will be introduced individually.
This will give the rooters their last
chance to see the varsity before they
don the moleskins and trot onto the
field to meet the Bruins.
The perpetual trophy for the winner
of the Big Game bleacher stunt con
test will be awarded tonight. The win
ners of the contest have already been
chosen but their names will not be
divulged until the trophy is awarded.
At the close of the pavilion rally,
the serpentine will form again and will
wend its way to the bonfire where the
