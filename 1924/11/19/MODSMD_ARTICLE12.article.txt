"TO HELL WITH THE GOLD AND BLUE"
AGAIN the Stanford supporters are rallying 011 the eve of the Big Game
to demonstrate that they are behind the team to a man and that they
are not overconfident.
Tonight is the night that all individual differences are blended into a well
organized mass of vociferous rooters and the entire assemblage will work
under McCallister as a single unit.
When the serpentine has wound its way down the row, past the halls, and
into the pavilion, preceded by the Stanford band, one of the largest and most
enthusiastic rallies in years will have begun, according to all advance indica
tions.
Last night, soon after everyone had started to work 011 the books, someone
felt the need of offering the student body an opportunity to give vent to the
pent-up enthusiasm and therewith called a hurried mass meeting by means
of the power house fire whistle. Several hundred men rushed to the

'scene, expecting to see the bonfire
blazing. When the affair was found
to be a false alarm, the crowd called
for McCallister to lead in yells and
songs and turned the meeting into a
spontaneous short rally.
According to J. E. McDowell, olumni
secretary in charge of the distribution
of rally tickets, innumerable requests
have come to him for tickets for to
night's affair. These tickets are being
given out only to the faculty, students'
parents, and those physically incapaci
tated. The Board of Athletic Control
is distributing tickets to former block
S men and to University officials.
All rooters in the serpentine will be
admitted in a body without any spe
cial arrangements. Women will be ad
mitted on their student cards but only
at the east gate of the pavilion.
The entire team will be at the rally
and will be introduced individually.
This will give the rooters their last
chance to see the varsity before they
don the moleskins and trot onto the
field to meet the Bruins.
The perpetual trophy for the winner
of the Big Game bleacher stunt con
test will be awarded tonight. The win
ners of the contest have already been
chosen but their names will not be
divulged until the trophy is awarded.
At the close of the pavilion rally,
the serpentine will form again and will
wend its way to the bonfire where the
having a limping good time. White
and Cock, regular tackles, are watch
ing the practice from behind the lines,
and "Tut" Imlay, halfback and safety
man, with one side of his body well
smashed up, thinks Brown is a poor
substitute at his position. Sargent is
replacing White, and Greene is going
through the paces for Cock.
That makes it three to two.
"Pop" Warner is confident that the
varsity can play fifty per cent better
against stronger competition. Stan
ford has had no really strong opposi
tion this year, with the possible ex
ception of Idaho, and that leaves the
big test for the California clash.
The showing of Jim Kelly Saturday
was gratifying. It was a bit ragged in
spots, but it gives Warner a halfback
who is a hard line-plunger. Working
in conjunction with either Bogue or
Hey it gives Stanford the added punch
of a driving offense.
Stanford has a clean record as far
as blocked punts are concerned. That
most-talked-of-subject last year has
been practically forgotten this season,
but it raises a serious question, never
theless, in the California game.
"Babe" Horrell is the best center on
the Pacific Coast. Not only that, but
he is the best linesman and all-around
interferer that the Bears can boast of.
There is going to be some heavy
smashing done in the center of the
line, and it will take the combined ef
forts of Baker, Neill, and Johnston to
block the "Babe" from making himself
a nuisance in the Card secondary de
fense. Walter Camp will be sitting in
the stands, and Horrell stands out
more, at present, than any man on
either team with a possibility for an
Ail-American berth. That means Hor
rell will be playing his head off. He's
a good man to watch.
The first Kansas University rally
this year was marked by the taking of
a pledge of loyalty by the student
body. Over 3000 students were present.
Oklahoma University students spent
86 years reading books last year, ac
cording to recent computations by
their librarian.
