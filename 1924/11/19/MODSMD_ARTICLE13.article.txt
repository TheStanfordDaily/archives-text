# SOPHOMORES DOWN JUNIOR ELEVEN IN FINAL GRID GAME
## Second-Year'" Men Winners Of Interclass Football Championship 
### 
By virtue of a 20 to 7 victory over
the juniors, the sophomore eleven won
the interclass football championship
yesterday afternoon on the freshman
field. The two teams met November 12
and fought a 0 to 0 tie but in the
intermission the sophomores polished
up their plays considerably and the
third-year men suffered the loss of
two of their most reliable players,
Morgan and McAllister.
Aside from some sensational punts,
runs, and catches by Smythe of the
sophs, the game was rather ragged
and uninteresting. The first quarter
ended with neither team scoring or
showing any particular class. Both
were stalling around feeling the other
out and waiting for the breaks which
failed to come.
However, the second quarter was
the one bright spot of the game. Early
in the period the third-year men at-|
tempted a pass from the 50-yard line
which was intercepted by Raffetto of
the sophs who ran it to his opponents' !
twenty-yard line. Before the juniors
had realized quite what luid happened
the soph center snapped the ball to
Price, who passed to Smythe. Smythe
carried the ball over for a touchdown
and a few seconds later he converted
from placement.
A few plays later the second-year
men intercepted a pass which had
just barely left the passer's hand and
ran it for a touchdown. Smythe again
converted.
After the kickoff the sophomores
were forced to punt from their ten-yard
line. The kick was blocked and Stock
bridge fell on the ball over the goal
line for the juniors' first and only
touchdown. Randolph converted, and
two minutes later the half ended. '
Sophs Repeat in Third Quarter
The first part of the third quarter
Price worked another quick pass that
is commonly termed, the "shoestring
pass." Smythe was 011 the receiving
end and the play netted 18 yards. An
other pass from Price to Smythe
gained 24 yards. Berring carried the
mil over for a touchdown, but Smythe
ailed to convert.
