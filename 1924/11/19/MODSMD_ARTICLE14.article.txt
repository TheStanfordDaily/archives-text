# RESPONSIVE STYLE MARKS RECITAL BY FAMOUS VIOLINIST
## 
### 
Sensitive, responsive style, and ad
mirable technique characterized the
recital at the Assembly ball last night
by Edoitard Deru, one of the foremost
exponents of the Belgian School of
Violinists. Miss Beatrice Anthony ac
companied him at the piano.
He made an excellent impression as
; a sincere artist of ample accomplish
ments. His musical intelligence,
breadth and beauty of tone, were
I shown in "Suite in D major," by J. M.
Leclair, 1697-1764; movements "An
; dante —Allegro," and "Sarabande-Tam
bourin."
"Aria" by Bach allowed him to re
■ veal a violinist who combines in his
playing the qualities of intellect and
feeling of taste and finesse, qualities
developed to a high degree and evi
dent in all hjs work.
Mozart's "Menuet" had delicacy, and
smoothness of action. In this the
1 phrasing was that of an artist, and the
tone was pure.
In the "Hebrew Melody" by Achron
there was much musical feeling, and
the bowing was clean-cut and virile.
> "Tempo di Minuetto" by Pugnani-
Kreisler commanded a richness of
tone, and a wide range of color. "Bal
lade and Polonaise" by Vieuxtemps
was expressive, full of ease and chariri'.
Five encores were given, "Melody
from Orphfee" by Gluck, "Rondino" by
Beethoven, "Evening Song" by Schu
mann, "Walthers Preislied" by Wag
ner, and "Berceuse" by Faure. In these
lie played with the finesse and firm
ness of tone characteristic of the Bel
gian school.
