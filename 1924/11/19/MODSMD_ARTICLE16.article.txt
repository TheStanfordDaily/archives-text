Announcement conies, not unexpectedly, that the hills surrounding
Strawberry Canyon will be used Saturday to cover the shorts in the sale
of Big Game tickets. This will perhaps silence the last of the protests
on the use of the canyon as the site of the California Memorial Stadium.
It appears, after all, that the California authorities were crazy like a fox.
It creates, however, a good many qualms as to the future of Big
Games. Stanford has a stadium which was considered adequate when
built, and was not even filled the first time it was vised for the California
game, but the prodigious boom in the popularity of football and the
finality of the varsity has made a capacity of sixty-five thousand woefully
insufficient. And Stanford has no Strawberry Hill. TKe're will be a good
many disappointments next year.
With these disappointments, it is possible that the popularity may
suffer. The public is entitled to no consideration in comparison with
student bodies and alumni, but it will not take too strongly to the idea of
being barred from Big Games. Which must finally be the result. So,
unless a half-dozen balconies are added to the average stadium, perhaps
the stadium as it is will be sufficient in ten or twelve years. It makes
another tough problem for athletic administrators.
