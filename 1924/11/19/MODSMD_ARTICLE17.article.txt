# Oh Yes—Football

### 
This week the Stanford student body is talking, living, eating, sleeping,
dreaming, and praying football, because on Saturday the varsity will
devote the afternoon to playing football. The crystallization of this
sentiment comes in this evening's rally, whither our footsteps will lead
all of us.
Last evening's "fire alarm'' was seized upon as the inspiration for a
neat impromptu celebration, and enthusiasm is pointing with the varsity.
It will boil tonight, seeth over Thursday and Friday, and blow the lid
off on Saturday afternoon. We have real prospects to be wrought up
over —so don't be ashamed to get wrought up.

TICKETS FOR the game are scarce. Call for yours and avoid dis
appointment.

EDITORIAL AND BUSINESS staffs of the Daily will meet to
morrow as usual.
