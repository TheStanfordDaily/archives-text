# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT

### 
The Editor—Sir:
The Montana game proved to the
Stanford student body two things:
first, that, the Stanford team will be
the victors when the final gun is fired
on November 22, and second, that only
real hard work and teal co-operation
can prevent the rooting section from
suffering a HUMILIATING defeat. The
enthusiasm of the rooting section, if
we may call the feeble bleats in the
stadium last Saturday by that ener
getic term, was the weakest that Stan*
ford has witnessed since her return to
American football in 1918.
At the Montana game there were
rooters who sat with their hands in
their pockets apparently unmoved by
the fact that a Stanford team had just
made a touchdown, and the yell lead
ers, on at least one such occasion, pre
ferred to chew gum or smoke instead
of trying to promote pep. When the
Stanford team went on the field at the
second half no cheer was given; when
the band performed no appreciation
was shown; when the game was over
no cheer was given for the Montana
varsity; on several occasions the
rooters objected to the yell selected
by the yell leaders. Such things are
inexcusable. If the rooters would give
one-tenth the enthusiasm and work
that the band and team are giving,
Stanford would carry off ALL the hon
ors at the Big Game.
In view of this, Mr. Editor, let me
suggest:
(1) That, even if the yell leaders
do not feek enthusiastic, they simu
late a wee-bit of pep while leading the
yells; (2) that the yell leaders hold

( secret practices so as not to get mixed
up in their motions as they did last
Saturday; (3) that songs be led
by the assistant who is musically in
clined; (4) that the rooters really co
j operate with the leaders from now
Ion; and (5) that we imitate the band
| and team and really prepare for the
Big Game.
All this is a hell of a big job for one
rally, but it CAN be done and it MUST
be done or the rooting section will go
on the rocks while "We're Sailing Up
i the Bay" and the Burial Song will be
our own funeral dirge.
Yours for Bear Meat,
G. G. R., '22.

The Editor—Sir:
"R. U. R." was proclaimed to be a
first class production. However, be
: that, as it may, why not have a little
music or entertainment between acts?
It would help to enliven the evening
and take away the ten or fifteen dull
minutes of intermission that occur a
j couple of times in almost every play.
; Dime picture shows, high schools, and
! even two theatre houses in Palo Alto
[ boast music in some form or other.
The dime show has its player-piano,
the high school its student orchestra,
and the Palo Alto theatre its pipe
organ. But what has the Stanford pro
duction to accompany it? Merely the
i montonous bang! bans! of the carpen
i ter's hammer as he changes the scene.
Stanford can show more class than
j this. Why not charge a dime more for
| admittance, or anything, but have
some form of entertainment between
acts and perhaps a short while before
the show starts? —A. R. Johnson
