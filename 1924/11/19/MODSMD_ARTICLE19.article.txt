Oh the light of her eyes is an' iceberg
blue.
(She's affecting a boreal greenish
hue.)
Her complexion, as white as a bliz
zard's drift,
Seems to frost her lips in a frigid lift
As she smiles, like the beautiful crys
tal queen
Who congeals crushed hearts with the
north light's sheen.
She's as sweet as she's cold, like a
flavored snow,
Not much for a girl—What a sherbet,
though!

With Our Simple Rural Friends
"One of Stanford's dearest tradi
tions—one which, more than almost
any other reflects the

spirit of this Man's
University — will be
observed tomorrow
when the hardy stu
dents dress in comical
regalia to hilariously
celebrate Roughs' Day.
Clever stunts empha
sizing the spirit of the
undergraduate are exe
cuted in perfect taste,
for, besides being a
Man's University,

Stanford is a Gentleman's University."
—Pawhuska Clarion.
