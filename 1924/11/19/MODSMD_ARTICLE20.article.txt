# A 						DRAB BALLAD

(in spasms)
Ethelbert McTavish was a sentimental
grenadier.
In his uniform or civies all the girls
gave him a cheer,
Most particularly little Arabella Carrie
Hanks ;
Love for him was in her heart more
thick than coin in papa's banks.
Underneath her bedroom window Eth
elbert would nightly park.
There he would elaborate on his emo
tions in the daFk.
Gentle Arabella heard his protesta
tions with a thrill—
He suggested wedlock and Miss Hanks
responded with a will.
So McTavish briskly buffed his buttons
and his Sunday shoes
And' he called upon her father ner
vously to hear the news.
Sad indeed was the returning from his
talk with Bella's dad.
Character availed him nothing for his
pocketbook was bad.
"It's impossible," said Hanks. "You
might come back when you have
wealth.
Tush! The measly pay you draw would
not keep Bella Hanks in health!"
Ethelbert and Arabella so continued in
their loves
With the casement still between them,
cooing through the bars—the
doves.
Back in London was another girl who
danced in John's Cafe.
Chloe was her first name-ronce her
last had been FitzHugh-Mcßae.
But the romancing McTavish long ago
had won her heart
('Tho when he was transferred she
was not so sad that they must
part.
First her grenadier was loving. Soon
the villain acted bored.
She unreasonably objected when he
beat her with his sword.)
Furlough came at last and Bella sent
him back to London towrf
Coin to gather for to marry. (How he
dreaded father's frown.)
Not in John's Cafe was wifie, but up
in her Soho flat;
With her was the rich Sir Golder,
sitting down without his hat!
"Hussy! Dastard! Base deceiver!
Scoundrel and home-breakjng
churl!
You shall pay me for this insult to
my honor! Take the girl!"
So he shouted but in fury Ethelbert
tore up no checks;
Likewise Golder's wedding Chloe sub
sequently, did not vex.
So he took the fifty thousand and, re
turning to the ranks,
He was made a senior captain when
he married Bella Hanks.
