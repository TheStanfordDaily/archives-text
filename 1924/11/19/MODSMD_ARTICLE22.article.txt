# ANDY SMITH'S MEN ON INVALIDS' BENCH WORKOUT BY PROXY
## 
### De Witt K. Burnham, '26 
(Associate Sport Editor "Daily
Californian")
As the first step in the final week
of training, Coach "Andy" Smith sent
his varsity gridiron men through a
stiff workout Monday night. The first
team took the offensive against the
second varsity, and until long after
dark, carried on a very successful at
tack. Time after time the varsity
broke through for a score against the
second squad.
Yet there seemed to be something
wrong with the punch of the Bruin
varsity. Something was missing. One
glance at the lineup showed where the
trouble lay. White and Cock were not
in at their tackle berths, Thatcher was
looking on from the sidelines, and
little "Tut" Imlay had to watch Brown
fill his halfback position.
There is nothing seriously wrong
with either "Tut" or "Thatch" but they
are both suffering from minor injuries
and "Andy" did not want to run the
risk of laying them up.
Big Gordon White limped onto the
field with a slipper on his bad foot,
and had to content himself with watch
ing the team go through its tricks. His
ankle is much better, but it is by no
means certain that he will be able to
start against the Cardinals Saturday.
He will be missed.
Johnny Sargent replaced White in
the game Saturday and gave a very
good account of himself. He got into
the plays in good style and ran some
fine interference for the backs. He
showed up equally well in scrimmage
last night.
"Andy" Smith's troubles do not stop
| with the loss of one tackle. Bart Cock
| received an injury Saturday that will
slow him up for awhile. Bob Greene
is filling his shoes for the time being,
but Bart should be back in the traces
by Saturday. If both White and Cock
should be out of the line-up Saturday
it might be a death blow to California.
Word comes from the south that the
Cardinal team did not fare too lightly
in their final preliminary game with
Montana. "Ernie" Nevers, who has
been touted as Stanford's star back
field man, injured his knee in the
| game, and from all indications will not
jbe able to start against the Bruin
i eleven. While "Pop" Warner has sev
eral good men to fill his place,
"Ernie's" loss may effect the morale
of the team.
The California varsity has been
through a hard training season, and
they have paid the bill with injured
men. But it has been worth the pVice
to receive the training and experience
that the Bruin team has received from
those stiff games.
The Golden Bear came out of its
lair on September 15, and for some
while lumbered along without making
a remarkable showing. But as the sea
son has rolled by he has slowly been
gaining momentum and has overcome
every obstacle in his way. He has been
through some hard fights and has lost
some fur, but he has still fot his
scalp. Saturday he will have his mas
sive frame at full speed. Bring on
Stanford!

trouble lay. White and Cock were not
in at their tackle berths, Thatcher was
looking on from the sidelines, and
little "Tut" Imlay had to watch Brown
fill his halfback position.
There is nothing seriously wrong
with either "Tut" or "Thatch" but they
are both suffering from minor injuries
and "Andy" did not want to run the
risk of laying them up.
Big Gordon White limped onto the
field with a slipper on his bad foot,
and had to content himself with watch
ing the team go through its tricks. His
ankle is much better, but it is by no
means certain that he will be able to
start against the Cardinals Saturday.
He will be missed.
Johnny Sargent replaced White in
the game Saturday and gave a very
good account of himself. He got into
the plays in good style and ran some
fine interference for the backs. He
showed up equally well in scrimmage
last night.
"Andy" Smith's troubles do not stop
| with the loss of one tackle. Bart Cock
| received an injury Saturday that will
slow him up for awhile. Bob Greene
is filling his shoes for the time being,
but Bart should be back in the traces
by Saturday. If both White and Cock
should be out of the line-up Saturday
it might be a death blow to California.
Word comes from the south that the
Cardinal team did not fare too lightly
in their final preliminary game with
Montana. "Ernie" Nevers, who has
been touted as Stanford's star back
field man, injured his knee in the
| game, and from all indications will not
jbe able to start against the Bruin
i eleven. While "Pop" Warner has sev
eral good men to fill his place,
"Ernie's" loss may effect the morale
of the team.
The California varsity has been
through a hard training season, and
they have paid the bill with injured
men. But it has been worth the pVice
to receive the training and experience
that the Bruin team has received from
those stiff games.
The Golden Bear came out of its
lair on September 15, and for some
while lumbered along without making
a remarkable showing. But as the sea
son has rolled by he has slowly been
gaining momentum and has overcome
every obstacle in his way. He has been
through some hard fights and has lost
some fur, but he has still fot his
scalp. Saturday he will have his mas
sive frame at full speed. Bring on
Stanford!

As the first step in the final week
of training, Coach "Andy" Smith sent
his varsity gridiron men through a
stiff workout Monday night. The first
team took the offensive against the
second varsity, and until long after
dark, carried on a very successful at
tack. Time after time the varsity
broke through for a score against the
second squad.
Yet there seemed to be something
wrong with the punch of the Bruin
varsity. Something was missing. One
glance at the lineup showed where the
trouble lay. White and Cock were not
in at their tackle berths, Thatcher was
looking on from the sidelines, and
little "Tut" Imlay had to watch Brown
fill his halfback position.
