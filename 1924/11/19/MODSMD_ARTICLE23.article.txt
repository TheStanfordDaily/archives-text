# SITE EXAMINED FOR MINING EXPERIMENT
## 
### 
Professors Hoover and Dietrich, of
the Department of Mining and Metal
lurgy, recently returned from a trip
to the Mother Lode country, in north
ern California, where they had gone
to find a mine suitable for a course in
mine surveying and sampling. This
course is to be given during spring
vacation, and one of the mine sites
examined on this trip will probably be
used.
Accompanied by Albert E. Forster
and Frederic Hanson, graduates in
mining engineering, Professors Hoover
and Dietrich investigated that part
of the Mother Lode vein which is lo
cated near Jackson, in Ainador county.
The vein extends over several coun
ties, but the are around Jackson,
which is only about fifty miles from
Stockton, was considered more practi
cal for the purposes of this course.
On their return from Jackson, the
party took a trip down into the Argo
naut mine in company with W. W.
Tamplin, who received his degree in
mining engineering last year. Tamplin
is now in the employ of the Argonaut
company as a general engineer.
