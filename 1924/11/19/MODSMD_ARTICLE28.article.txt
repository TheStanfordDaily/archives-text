# CARDINAL HOTEL TO OPEN DECEMBER 5
## 
### 
Palo Alto's new hotel, at Hamilton and
Ramona streets, is expected to lie opened
for occupancy on December 5, according
to A. B. Peterson, president of the cor
poration.
The estimated cost of erecting the
building is $250,000, and efforts have
been made by the hotel company to make
it the best possible. At the present time
it will have three stories, but provision
I has been made for building another floor
! when such accommodations become nec
essary.
The exterior work has already been
; completed, and much of the interior equip
ment has been installed. Completion was
j delayed for several weeks due to changes
from the original plans. Special atten-
J tion has been given to the electrical fix
; tures for the hotel.
