The cast of "Dulcy," the sophomore ,
play f,o be presented on December 6, j
was announced last night by Gordon j
, Davis, who will direct the production. I
"Dulcy" is a high-speed modern!
j comedy, with a flighty wife's attempts I
! to aid her husband in business as its
theme. Velma Randall will play the.
title role of Dulcy, with Les Herth in ;
the part of Gordon Smith, her husband, j
whose business affairs she tries to 1
! help by being nice to a Mr. Forbes, i
played by Charles Simons. The com-;
! plications arising from her bungling
attempts to ingratiate herself with i
Mr. Forbes, and her ridiculous metli
ods of match-making constitute the j
funniest parts of the play.
As usual, members of the sophomore j
i play cast will have to give up their
Thanksgiving vacation in order to put
the shown on in time. Coming as it
does during preparations for and after
11 he Big Game, the sophomore play is j
one of the hardest productions of the j
j year to pyt on.
