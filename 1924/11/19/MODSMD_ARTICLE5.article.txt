# STANFORD ROUGHS OBSERVE ANNUAL HARD-BOILED FEST
## Original Garbs Are Scarce; Freshmen Contribute to Day's Success 
### 
Original costumes were few and far
between on the Quad this morning
when the Stanford roughs staged their
annual workout. of the men were
contented with a slight growth of whis
kers, a pair of old trousers, and a
greasy shirt.
However, what was lacking in wear
ing apparel was made up by the hearty
reception that was afforded numerous
members of the class of '28. The
Union fountain was a sufficient threat
to obtain some very good songs,
dances, yells, and antics from the un
fortunates. Only one freshman found
his way into the aqua pura during the
first part of the morning, because of
his unwillingness to enter into the
spirit of the affair.
If the Men's Council does not abol
ish Roughs' Day next year the nearby
laundries will no doubt petition them
to do so. Judging from the number of
laundry sacks that were used as ma
terial for garments, every laundry on
the peninsula will show a deficit on
its books' at the end of the year.
There was the usual number of
tramps and no-accounts, an African ex
plorer, a toreador without, a bull, and
several costumes that were utterly in
describable. One canine inhabitant of
the campus was bedecked with the
headgear of the freshmen and a red
flannel jacket, but he took it as a
matter of course and did not at all
enter into the spirit of the day.
One junior disguised as the Prince
o? Wales was the only upperclassman
who found his way to the briny deep
of the Union fountain. A tin monocle
about six inches in diameter proved
to be too much for some of the rough
est and toughest males.
