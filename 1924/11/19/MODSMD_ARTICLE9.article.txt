## 
### 
FOUND—a dog.
WANTED —the owner.
A Llewellyn setter pup, evidently a
thoroughbred, and hence of great
value, was found in frout of the library
this morning, suffering badly from dis
temper.
The dog, which was about six
months old, aroused the sympathy of
a young lady and a male student, who
called a taxi and took the dog to the
Palo Alto Vterinary Hospital. The dog
may not recover, according to the hos
pital attendants.
The two students who rescued the
dpg, and are now paying its hospital
bills, are very anxious to locate the
owner. He (or she) may get in touch
with them by calling the Daily Palo
Alto off&e.
