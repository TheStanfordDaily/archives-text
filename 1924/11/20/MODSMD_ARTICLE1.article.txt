### Harry Bennett 
\ TANFORD VARSITY will play fifty per cent better football next Satur
day than they have done so far this season." This was "Pop' Warner s
promise for a winning fight at the Big Game rally in the pavilion
last night. Accompanying "Pop's" prediction, the yelling indicated that
Stanford students are behind the team to a man, and not too overconfident to
yell their heads off until the final shot announces the end of the Big Game.
Every inch of floor space was occupied. People from all over the Peninsula
-were on hand to witness the demonstrations of the rooters, and several
hundreds were forced to wait on the site of the bonfire until after the icillj.
The rooters went wild, giving vent€>

to a long yell when the varsity, pre
ceded by (he Scalpers Society carry
ing the Stanford Axe and headed by
Captain Jim Lawson, entered the pa
vilion. With them were "Pop" Warner,
Andy Kerr, "Tiny" Thornhill and Man
ager Jim Dickey.
The yells and songs, under the di
rection of "Dutch" McCallister and his
assistants, "Ev" Young and Raitt
Boren, occupied a large part of the
program.
George Copeland, '2S, was an
nounced winner of the Big Game
bleacher stunt contest and was award
ed the perpetual trophy, donated by
Wideman's of Palo Alto.
Charles Cutten Speaks
Charles Cutten, '99, represented the
alumni in a short talk to the rooters.
"'We are sure that this team is going
to do its best to uphold Stanford spirit
and make us feel proud of it," he said.
"Until ten years ago, Stanford held
the balance of games won and since
then has drawn on that balance. In
1922 we went one game behind and
in 1923 we were put two games be
hind. I feel sure that this year we
will make the turn that will again give
us the balance."
Representing the faculty, Alonzo
Taylor read two cablegrams, one from
Charles K. Field, '95, and the other
from the alumni in London. Both were
expressing hopes for victory.
"Foptball is the greatest American
amateur sport; a man playing the
gam? does not only represent his alma
mater or his state, but he represents
his entire country," said Taylor. "In
the East, during the month before
elections, more space in the news
papers was given to football than to
politics, thus showing the great inter
est in the sport."
"Pop" Presented Gift
Phil Wilson, president of the Los
Angeles alumni, presented "Pop" War
ner with a set of golf clubs and a golf
bag. This gift signified the apprecia
tion of Warner's work with the varsity
this season.
"Pop's" game cock was introduced
to the students by Delmer Daves in a
clever skit and will be a mascot for
the game Saturday. This bird signifies
gameness and fight and was consid
ered a fitting mascot for the team.
"The varsity is one of two big teams
in the country that has not been
beaten or tied this year," said Warner
in his talk.
Ram's Head Gives Skit
Ram's Head presented a humorous
skit with the Grid-Graph and "Hock"
Chalmers as principals. "Hock" pulled
some exceptionally comical stuff when
announcing the telegraphic reports on
the Big Game.
The last act was an original stunt
prepared by Allen Campbell, who was
accompanied on the piano by "Chubby"
Tyroler. Campbell came out disguised
as a university woman and sang a
song that he has recently prepared
called "The Modern Co-Ed's Prayer"
This song is a parody on an old-timer
that is known as "The Maiden's
Prayer."
Freshman Bonfire
Directly after Campbell's act and
the singing of the hymn, the rally ad
journed to the bonfire, the gift of the
class of '28 to the cause of football.
The fire was the tallest one that has
ever been built on the campus, meas
uring exactly 79 feet. The holdovers
that lit the fire this year showed more
consideration than the former igniters
and waited until the crowd arrived
At the bonfire, more songs and yells
before performing their duty.

Taylor read two cablegrams, one from
Charles K. Field, '95, and the other
from the alumni in London. Both were
expressing hopes for victory.
"Foptball is the greatest American
amateur sport; a man playing the
gam? does not only represent his alma
mater or his state, but he represents
his entire country," said Taylor. "In
the East, during the month before
elections, more space in the news
papers was given to football than to
politics, thus showing the great inter

"Pop" Presented Gift
Phil Wilson, president of the Los
Angeles alumni, presented "Pop" War
ner with a set of golf clubs and a golf
bag. This gift signified the apprecia
tion of Warner's work with the varsity
this season.
"Pop's" game cock was introduced
to the students by Delmer Daves in a
clever skit and will be a mascot for
the game Saturday. This bird signifies
gameness and fight and was consid
ered a fitting mascot for the team.
"The varsity is one of two big teams
in the country that has not been
beaten or tied this year," said Warner
in his talk.
Ram's Head Gives Skit
Ram's Head presented a humorous
skit with the Grid-Graph and "Hock"
Chalmers as principals. "Hock" pulled
some exceptionally comical stuff when
announcing the telegraphic reports on
the Big Game.
The last act was an original stunt
prepared by Allen Campbell, who was
accompanied on the piano by "Chubby"
Tyroler. Campbell came out disguised
as a university woman and sang a
song that he has recently prepared
called "The Modern Co-Ed's Prayer"
This song is a parody on an old-timer
that is known as "The Maiden's
Prayer."
Freshman Bonfire
Directly after Campbell's act and
the singing of the hymn, the rally ad
journed to the bonfire, the gift of the
class of '28 to the cause of football.
The fire was the tallest one that has
ever been built on the campus, meas
uring exactly 79 feet. The holdovers
that lit the fire this year showed more
consideration than the former igniters
and waited until the crowd arrived
At the bonfire, more songs and yells
before performing their duty.

henchmen.
\ TANFORD VARSITY will play fifty per cent better football next Satur
day than they have done so far this season." This was "Pop' Warner s
promise for a winning fight at the Big Game rally in the pavilion
last night. Accompanying "Pop's" prediction, the yelling indicated that
Stanford students are behind the team to a man, and not too overconfident to
yell their heads off until the final shot announces the end of the Big Game.
Every inch of floor space was occupied. People from all over the Peninsula
-were on hand to witness the demonstrations of the rooters, and several
hundreds were forced to wait on the site of the bonfire until after the icillj.
The rooters went wild, giving vent€>

to a long yell when the varsity, pre
ceded by (he Scalpers Society carry
ing the Stanford Axe and headed by
Captain Jim Lawson, entered the pa
vilion. With them were "Pop" Warner,
Andy Kerr, "Tiny" Thornhill and Man
ager Jim Dickey.
The yells and songs, under the di
rection of "Dutch" McCallister and his
assistants, "Ev" Young and Raitt
Boren, occupied a large part of the
program.
George Copeland, '2S, was an
nounced winner of the Big Game
bleacher stunt contest and was award
ed the perpetual trophy, donated by
Wideman's of Palo Alto.
Charles Cutten Speaks
Charles Cutten, '99, represented the
alumni in a short talk to the rooters.
"'We are sure that this team is going

"Until ten years ago, Stanford held
the balance of games won and since

henchmen.
\ TANFORD VARSITY will play fifty per cent better football next Satur
day than they have done so far this season." This was "Pop' Warner s
promise for a winning fight at the Big Game rally in the pavilion
last night. Accompanying "Pop's" prediction, the yelling indicated that
Stanford students are behind the team to a man, and not too overconfident to
yell their heads off until the final shot announces the end of the Big Game.
Every inch of floor space was occupied. People from all over the Peninsula
-were on hand to witness the demonstrations of the rooters, and several
hundreds were forced to wait on the site of the bonfire until after the icillj.
The rooters went wild, giving vent€>

to a long yell when the varsity, pre
ceded by (he Scalpers Society carry
ing the Stanford Axe and headed by
Captain Jim Lawson, entered the pa
vilion. With them were "Pop" Warner,
Andy Kerr, "Tiny" Thornhill and Man
ager Jim Dickey.
The yells and songs, under the di
rection of "Dutch" McCallister and his
assistants, "Ev" Young and Raitt
Boren, occupied a large part of the
program.
George Copeland, '2S, was an
nounced winner of the Big Game
bleacher stunt contest and was award
ed the perpetual trophy, donated by
Wideman's of Palo Alto.
Charles Cutten Speaks
Charles Cutten, '99, represented the
alumni in a short talk to the rooters.
"'We are sure that this team is going
to do its best to uphold Stanford spirit
and make us feel proud of it," he said.
"Until ten years ago, Stanford held
the balance of games won and since
then has drawn on that balance. In
1922 we went one game behind and
in 1923 we were put two games be
hind. I feel sure that this year we
will make the turn that will again give
us the balance."
Representing the faculty, Alonzo
Taylor read two cablegrams, one from
Charles K. Field, '95, and the other
from the alumni in London. Both were
expressing hopes for victory.
"Foptball is the greatest American
amateur sport; a man playing the
gam? does not only represent his alma
mater or his state, but he represents
his entire country," said Taylor. "In
the East, during the month before
elections, more space in the news
papers was given to football than to
politics, thus showing the great inter
est in the sport."
"Pop" Presented Gift
Phil Wilson, president of the Los
Angeles alumni, presented "Pop" War
ner with a set of golf clubs and a golf
bag. This gift signified the apprecia
tion of Warner's work with the varsity
this season.
"Pop's" game cock was introduced
to the students by Delmer Daves in a
clever skit and will be a mascot for
the game Saturday. This bird signifies
gameness and fight and was consid
ered a fitting mascot for the team.
"The varsity is one of two big teams
in the country that has not been
beaten or tied this year," said Warner
in his talk.
Ram's Head Gives Skit
Ram's Head presented a humorous
skit with the Grid-Graph and "Hock"
Chalmers as principals. "Hock" pulled
some exceptionally comical stuff when
announcing the telegraphic reports on
the Big Game.
The last act was an original stunt
prepared by Allen Campbell, who was
accompanied on the piano by "Chubby"
Tyroler. Campbell came out disguised
as a university woman and sang a
song that he has recently prepared
called "The Modern Co-Ed's Prayer"
This song is a parody on an old-timer
that is known as "The Maiden's
Prayer."
Freshman Bonfire
Directly after Campbell's act and
the singing of the hymn, the rally ad
journed to the bonfire, the gift of the
class of '28 to the cause of football.
The fire was the tallest one that has
ever been built on the campus, meas
uring exactly 79 feet. The holdovers
that lit the fire this year showed more
consideration than the former igniters
and waited until the crowd arrived
At the bonfire, more songs and yells

henchmen.
