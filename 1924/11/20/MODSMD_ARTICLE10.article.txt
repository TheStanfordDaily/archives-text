Practical jokers last night took an j
automobile from in front of Enema;
and returned it some two hours later
after half the police on the Peninsula
had been called out.
The car was a new Buick Coupe be
longing to S. P. Fay. It had been
parked in front of the freshman dormi- ;
tory during the rally. Fay missed his
machine at about 8:30 and immedi
ately notified the police. Circulars
were sent to San Francisco describing
the car.
When Fay returned to Encina he
found the car parked where he had
left it. The motor was still warm and
a number of peanut shells were
strewn on the seats. It had evidently
been used for a joyride.
The owner of the car suggests that
the parties who stole his machine
kindly return the keys to him. His
address is Box 723, Campus.
