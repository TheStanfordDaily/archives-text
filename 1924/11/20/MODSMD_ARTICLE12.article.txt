## 
### 
The Rig Game number of Chaparral
which will appear Saturday is the
twentieth of its kind to he dedicated
to the annual Stanford-California foot
ball classic. In 1904 the editor of Chap
pie, Del Reynolds, now vice-president
of the First National Rank of Los
Angeles, conceived the idea of pub
lishing one large issue a year as a
fitting wind-up to the football season.
Refore this time the Hammer and i
1 Coffin publication had devoted edi-;
torial space galore to comments on
the Rig Game. In fact the policy ofj
the editors had been to write stuff
intended to "egg on" the sons of Stan
ford to greater efforts.
This first Rig Game Number was

twenty pages in length, the largest
magazine published up to that time.
The issue marked another innovation,
in the use of a full-page cover. For
merly it had consisted of a sort of
three-quarter page drawing with an
ink-line sketch in one corner to fill out
the page.
The new cover was drawn by Ran
dal William Rorough, '04, and pic
tured the Old Roy sitting on a stone
bench pointing the finger of scorn at
the world in general. Each year this
| same drawing is used on some issue
of the magazine.
At this time, 1904, a heated fight
was raging between the editors of the
Daily Palo Alto and Chaparral.
