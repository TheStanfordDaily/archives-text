## 
### 
The special train for Berkeley Sat
urday will be run in two sections, one
leaving Palo Alto at 9:50 in the morn
! ing, and the other at 10:50. Both trains
will take the Dumbarton route across
the bay, arriving at the Berkeley sta
tion at 12 noon and 1 p.m., respec
tively.
A return train will leave the Oak-
I land pier at 6:15 p.m., but all who
! wish to stop over may cross the bay
by ferry and take a later train down
the Peninsula. The excursion tickets
wil lbe honored over either route.
Those who make the trip are asked
to buy tickets in advance, in order
i that the railroad company may arrange
to have enough cars on hand to ac
commodate the crowd. Tickets may be
! purchased at the Southern Pacific de
pot in Palo Alto for $2. By getting
tickets early, rooters may avoid the
last-minute rush.
Last year the train proved to be
the most successful mode of trans
portation. Besides saving time and
money, it was the safest, and most
dependable. Many who drove over in
| cars, by way of San Francisco, were
caught in the jams at the ferry, and
failed to get to the stadium in time
for the game. In addition, many cars
! were damaged in the jams, while tire
and engine trouble delayed still other
j travelers. To insure the arrival of the
entire rooting section, therefore, all
who can possibly take the train are
{ urged to do so.
