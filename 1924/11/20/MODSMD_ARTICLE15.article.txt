# TO THOSE INTERESTED

### 
Early this week, Mr. Junior Col
lins submitted a letter to me for
publication in the Daily. It was
scarcely more conclusive than his
first one, and could do nothing to
ward clearing up the situation. I
pointed out to him the inadvisabil
ity of taking the matter up through
the Daily, and advised him to see
Dr. Wilbur. I tried to convince him
that Dr. Wilbur would be very
happy to help him, either by acting
upon his project or by pointing out
facts that Mr. Collins might have
overlooked. I urged him to do this
before submitting his letter to out
side newspapers, as he said he in
tended to do. Mr. Collins told me
that he considered it a good sugges
tion, and left me with the impres
sion that he would see Dr. Wilbur
before taking further steps.
Mr. Collins did not do this. He
preferred the launching of propa
ganda to the treating of the matter
through the proper channels. I feel
that the student body is entitled to
this information.
