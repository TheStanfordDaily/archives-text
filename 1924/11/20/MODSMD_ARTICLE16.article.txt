# ERNIE NEVERS OUT AS CARD GRIDDERS WIND UP TRAINING
## BROKEN ANKLE PUTS STAR BACK ON BENCH Big Game Expected To Be Open Contest; Both Teams Concentrate On Building Up Formidable Passing Attack 
### Hugh Hollembeak 
ERNIE NEVERS, Stanford's great backfleld ace, will not play against
California Saturday. That fact became definitely known yesterday, and
with it much of the air of uncertainty which hovered over his presence
ia the game has disappeared. All season the question has been, "What will
Nevers do in the Big Game?" Now with Ernie on the bench, 1 the varsity has
its work cut out for it and it must win or lose on what it has already shown
this season.
r Nevers' loss, while undeniably a blow to Stanford, is not as serious as if
it had happened to the team before last year's game. The blonde fullback

is the best all-around man on the
Cardinal squad, but fortunately "Pop"
Warner has succeeded in developing a
number of men who size up favorably
with Nevers in various departments
of play.
Filling the vacantl berth at full are
Hey and Bogue, who hit the line in a
manner reminiscent of Ernie at his
best. Cleaveland has been kicking fur
ther than the All-American back and
his punts are inferior only in the mat
ter of height. (sleaveland and Mitchell
are even better at passing and it is
only at backing up the line on defense
that there are no understudies to take
Nevers' place.
Passing Game Probable
The change in the outlook resulting
from the elimination of Nevers as a
possible starter lends still further
color to the probability that Warner
will employ a wide-open passing game
against California instead of his cus
tomary line-smashing offensive. The
aerial game has constituted the prin
cipal item in the practice sessions
