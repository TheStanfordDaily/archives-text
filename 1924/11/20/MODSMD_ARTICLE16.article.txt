# ERNIE NEVERS OUT AS CARD GRIDDERS WIND UP TRAINING
## BROKEN ANKLE PUTS STAR BACK ON BENCH Big Game Expected To Be Open Contest; Both Teams Concentrate On Building Up Formidable Passing Attack 
### Hugh Hollembeak 
ERNIE NEVERS, Stanford's great backfleld ace, will not play against
California Saturday. That fact became definitely known yesterday, and
with it much of the air of uncertainty which hovered over his presence
ia the game has disappeared. All season the question has been, "What will
Nevers do in the Big Game?" Now with Ernie on the bench, 1 the varsity has
its work cut out for it and it must win or lose on what it has already shown
this season.
r Nevers' loss, while undeniably a blow to Stanford, is not as serious as if
it had happened to the team before last year's game. The blonde fullback

is the best all-around man on the
Cardinal squad, but fortunately "Pop"
Warner has succeeded in developing a
number of men who size up favorably
with Nevers in various departments
of play.
Filling the vacantl berth at full are
Hey and Bogue, who hit the line in a
manner reminiscent of Ernie at his
best. Cleaveland has been kicking fur
ther than the All-American back and
his punts are inferior only in the mat
ter of height. (sleaveland and Mitchell
are even better at passing and it is
only at backing up the line on defense
that there are no understudies to take
Nevers' place.
Passing Game Probable
The change in the outlook resulting
from the elimination of Nevers as a
possible starter lends still further
color to the probability that Warner
will employ a wide-open passing game
against California instead of his cus
tomary line-smashing offensive. The
aerial game has constituted the prin
cipal item in the practice sessions
which came to a close yesterday after
noon, and speed and deception are
very likely to take the place of brawn
and power as the Stanford hope of
victory Saturday.
Such a change in the plan of the
Stanford attack could not fail to prove
disconcerting to an opponent. Warner
teams are usually bone-crushers and
to date the showing of the varsity
bears out this view.
A complete switch in general style
of play would nullify all the carefully
made preparations for meeting the ex
pected line attack. If Warner does
employ this plan of battle, and there
are good reasons to believe that he
will, a great many wiseacres who have
been accusing the old master of lack
of football acumen will have another
guess coming to them.
Bears Strong on Runs
To date California's most consistent
gains have been made on fast dashes
off tackle by Dixon and Imlay coupled
with fierce line smashes by A1 Young
at full. In Shipkey and Johnston the
Blue and Gold backs will encounter
two veterans in the tackle positions,
and if "Tut" and Jimmy can get by
these two with Captain Lawson and
Ted Shipkey helping out the defense,
they will be even better than
most ardent admirers have claimed.
Young's chances through the center
of the line are a bit better for there
he has Captain "Babe" Horrell to help
him. A fake reverse with Young carry
ing the ball over center has been a
consistent ground-gainer all year, and
the mid-section of Stanford's line will
have to be on its toes to stop it.
Smith Will Have Tricks
However, it is a cinch that Andy
Smith will send the boys on the field
with a flock of clever tricks and it
would not be at all surprising if a
great many of these were part of an
other carefully-planned passing game.
When Dixon is right he is the best
passer in the state and little Imlay
has proved a demon at pulling down

tosses.
After Stanford's weak showing
against Montana's aerial game it is i
only natural that Smith should turn
his pair of stars loose to take advan- j
tage of this defect.
There is going be a lot of straight
football. That must be expected when
men like Hey and Bogue oppose
Young and Brown, but nevertheless, I
the deciding factor may well turn out
to be the open game each team em
ploys. From the speotators' point of
view, nothing could be finer, for when
two teams coached by such men as
Smith and Warner match their over
head attacks plenty is bound to hap
pen.
Bruins' Kicker Not Formidable
All of this does not fail to take into
account the Bears' kicking game but
they have no Archie Nisbet on this
year's team and, as a result, the kick-j
ing game must be somewhat modified. I
Undoubtedly California will adopt the
same policy they did last year of punt
ing short and giving their ends plenty I
of time to cover the receiver. The plan i
when tried worked to perfection and
Stanford might do well to learn some- i
thing from it. It has been noticed that
there is a tendency for Cleaveland's
punts to carry a trifle low, and when
these same punts axe sailing fifty j
yards into the hands of a streak of
greased lightning such as Imlay is, j
trouble is likely to result. The Cardi
nal ends will do well if they keep this
boy from making any of his sensa
tional long returns. If they do, the
public will miss some spectacular play,
but said public need not worry, as it
looks as if the California stadium is
going to see the most spectacular
game put on in these parts since rugby
made its last appearance.

r Nevers' loss, while undeniably a blow to Stanford, is not as serious as if
it had happened to the team before last year's game. The blonde fullback

is the best all-around man on the
Cardinal squad, but fortunately "Pop"
Warner has succeeded in developing a
number of men who size up favorably
with Nevers in various departments
of play.
Filling the vacantl berth at full are
Hey and Bogue, who hit the line in a
manner reminiscent of Ernie at his
best. Cleaveland has been kicking fur
ther than the All-American back and
his punts are inferior only in the mat
ter of height. (sleaveland and Mitchell
are even better at passing and it is
only at backing up the line on defense
that there are no understudies to take
Nevers' place.
Passing Game Probable
The change in the outlook resulting
from the elimination of Nevers as a
possible starter lends still further
color to the probability that Warner
will employ a wide-open passing game
against California instead of his cus
tomary line-smashing offensive. The
aerial game has constituted the prin
cipal item in the practice sessions
which came to a close yesterday after
noon, and speed and deception are
very likely to take the place of brawn
and power as the Stanford hope of
victory Saturday.
Such a change in the plan of the
Stanford attack could not fail to prove
disconcerting to an opponent. Warner
teams are usually bone-crushers and
to date the showing of the varsity
bears out this view.
A complete switch in general style
of play would nullify all the carefully
made preparations for meeting the ex
pected line attack. If Warner does
employ this plan of battle, and there
are good reasons to believe that he
will, a great many wiseacres who have
been accusing the old master of lack
of football acumen will have another
guess coming to them.
Bears Strong on Runs
To date California's most consistent
gains have been made on fast dashes
off tackle by Dixon and Imlay coupled
with fierce line smashes by A1 Young
at full. In Shipkey and Johnston the
Blue and Gold backs will encounter
two veterans in the tackle positions,
and if "Tut" and Jimmy can get by
these two with Captain Lawson and
Ted Shipkey helping out the defense,
they will be even better than
most ardent admirers have claimed.
Young's chances through the center
of the line are a bit better for there
he has Captain "Babe" Horrell to help
him. A fake reverse with Young carry
ing the ball over center has been a
consistent ground-gainer all year, and
the mid-section of Stanford's line will
have to be on its toes to stop it.
Smith Will Have Tricks
However, it is a cinch that Andy
Smith will send the boys on the field
with a flock of clever tricks and it
would not be at all surprising if a
great many of these were part of an
other carefully-planned passing game.
When Dixon is right he is the best
passer in the state and little Imlay
has proved a demon at pulling down

tosses.
After Stanford's weak showing
against Montana's aerial game it is i
only natural that Smith should turn
his pair of stars loose to take advan- j
tage of this defect.
There is going be a lot of straight
football. That must be expected when
men like Hey and Bogue oppose
Young and Brown, but nevertheless, I
the deciding factor may well turn out
to be the open game each team em
ploys. From the speotators' point of
view, nothing could be finer, for when
two teams coached by such men as
Smith and Warner match their over
head attacks plenty is bound to hap
pen.
Bruins' Kicker Not Formidable
All of this does not fail to take into
account the Bears' kicking game but
they have no Archie Nisbet on this
year's team and, as a result, the kick-j
ing game must be somewhat modified. I
Undoubtedly California will adopt the
same policy they did last year of punt
ing short and giving their ends plenty I
of time to cover the receiver. The plan i
when tried worked to perfection and
Stanford might do well to learn some- i
thing from it. It has been noticed that
there is a tendency for Cleaveland's
punts to carry a trifle low, and when
these same punts axe sailing fifty j
yards into the hands of a streak of
greased lightning such as Imlay is, j
trouble is likely to result. The Cardi
nal ends will do well if they keep this
boy from making any of his sensa
tional long returns. If they do, the
public will miss some spectacular play,
but said public need not worry, as it
looks as if the California stadium is
going to see the most spectacular
game put on in these parts since rugby
made its last appearance.
ERNIE NEVERS, Stanford's great backfleld ace, will not play against
California Saturday. That fact became definitely known yesterday, and
with it much of the air of uncertainty which hovered over his presence
ia the game has disappeared. All season the question has been, "What will
Nevers do in the Big Game?" Now with Ernie on the bench, 1 the varsity has

ter of height. (sleaveland and Mitchell
are even better at passing and it is
only at backing up the line on defense
that there are no understudies to take
Nevers' place.
Passing Game Probable
The change in the outlook resulting
from the elimination of Nevers as a
possible starter lends still further
color to the probability that Warner
will employ a wide-open passing game
against California instead of his cus
tomary line-smashing offensive. The
aerial game has constituted the prin
cipal item in the practice sessions
which came to a close yesterday after
noon, and speed and deception are
very likely to take the place of brawn
and power as the Stanford hope of
victory Saturday.
Such a change in the plan of the
Stanford attack could not fail to prove
disconcerting to an opponent. Warner
teams are usually bone-crushers and
to date the showing of the varsity
bears out this view.
A complete switch in general style
of play would nullify all the carefully
made preparations for meeting the ex
pected line attack. If Warner does
employ this plan of battle, and there
are good reasons to believe that he
will, a great many wiseacres who have
been accusing the old master of lack
of football acumen will have another
guess coming to them.
Bears Strong on Runs
To date California's most consistent
gains have been made on fast dashes
off tackle by Dixon and Imlay coupled
with fierce line smashes by A1 Young
at full. In Shipkey and Johnston the
Blue and Gold backs will encounter
two veterans in the tackle positions,
and if "Tut" and Jimmy can get by
these two with Captain Lawson and
Ted Shipkey helping out the defense,
they will be even better than
most ardent admirers have claimed.
Young's chances through the center
of the line are a bit better for there
he has Captain "Babe" Horrell to help
him. A fake reverse with Young carry
ing the ball over center has been a
consistent ground-gainer all year, and
the mid-section of Stanford's line will
have to be on its toes to stop it.
Smith Will Have Tricks
However, it is a cinch that Andy
Smith will send the boys on the field
with a flock of clever tricks and it
would not be at all surprising if a
great many of these were part of an
other carefully-planned passing game.
When Dixon is right he is the best
passer in the state and little Imlay
has proved a demon at pulling down

tosses.
After Stanford's weak showing
against Montana's aerial game it is i
only natural that Smith should turn
his pair of stars loose to take advan- j
tage of this defect.
There is going be a lot of straight
football. That must be expected when
men like Hey and Bogue oppose
Young and Brown, but nevertheless, I
the deciding factor may well turn out
to be the open game each team em
ploys. From the speotators' point of
view, nothing could be finer, for when
two teams coached by such men as
Smith and Warner match their over
head attacks plenty is bound to hap
pen.
Bruins' Kicker Not Formidable
All of this does not fail to take into
account the Bears' kicking game but
they have no Archie Nisbet on this
year's team and, as a result, the kick-j
ing game must be somewhat modified. I
Undoubtedly California will adopt the
same policy they did last year of punt
ing short and giving their ends plenty I
of time to cover the receiver. The plan i
when tried worked to perfection and
Stanford might do well to learn some- i
thing from it. It has been noticed that
there is a tendency for Cleaveland's
punts to carry a trifle low, and when
these same punts axe sailing fifty j
yards into the hands of a streak of
greased lightning such as Imlay is, j
trouble is likely to result. The Cardi
nal ends will do well if they keep this
boy from making any of his sensa
tional long returns. If they do, the
public will miss some spectacular play,
but said public need not worry, as it
looks as if the California stadium is
going to see the most spectacular
game put on in these parts since rugby
made its last appearance.
ERNIE NEVERS, Stanford's great backfleld ace, will not play against
California Saturday. That fact became definitely known yesterday, and
with it much of the air of uncertainty which hovered over his presence
ia the game has disappeared. All season the question has been, "What will
Nevers do in the Big Game?" Now with Ernie on the bench, 1 the varsity has
its work cut out for it and it must win or lose on what it has already shown
this season.
r Nevers' loss, while undeniably a blow to Stanford, is not as serious as if
it had happened to the team before last year's game. The blonde fullback

is the best all-around man on the
Cardinal squad, but fortunately "Pop"
Warner has succeeded in developing a
number of men who size up favorably
with Nevers in various departments
of play.
Filling the vacantl berth at full are
Hey and Bogue, who hit the line in a
manner reminiscent of Ernie at his
best. Cleaveland has been kicking fur
ther than the All-American back and
his punts are inferior only in the mat
ter of height. (sleaveland and Mitchell
are even better at passing and it is
only at backing up the line on defense
that there are no understudies to take
