### Rhoda Lewis 
A canvass of the Quad tomorrow,

call drive. The final canvassing of the
living groups will close today.
The Red Cross carries on construc-;
tive measures which are an example.
of dealing with charity in the right
way. Hygiene classes, especially in the |
prevention of tuberculosis, service to'
disabled veterans, lessons in nutrition,'
public health nursing, and first aid
are only a few of the benefits the Red
Cross will create from the money it
collects from members.
'Only Agency Frequently
In 500 communities the Red Cross is
the only family welfare agency. Other 1
charity organizations slip up here and;
there, - but the Red Cross is every-'
where, and it always provides "as ef
ficient, capable service as exists in
any business of the United States.";
This has been the purpose of Chair
man John Barton Payne.
President Coolidge describes the or
ganization as follows: "The Red Cross i
is devoted to no special program. It j
indulges no propaganda. It knows no
creed, no party, no politics, no classes j
or groups. It sees humanity as a!
whole, into all of which may come |
suffering, pestilence, misfortune in any
of its myriad forms. Its sole purpose
is to relieve these." A statement like
that from the president of the United
States is worth a dollar's considera-j
tion.
