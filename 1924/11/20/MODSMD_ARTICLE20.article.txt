# Two Wrongs DO NOT MAKE A RIGHT
## 
### 
The day has brought forth more than plenty. In the first place, an
unrepresentative group of students took the law into their own hands,
with the effect of strengthening, more than anything else could have
done, the point they sought to punish. It is unquestionable that the right
of free speech is attended with the necessity of meeting the public
reaction, and Collins took this into consideration.
The Daily does not by any means support Collins in his stand. His
cause was not without merit, but his methods were most unwise. The
Daily refused his second letter, on the grounds that it was little more
than a re-hash of his first one, and contained but one statement which
even approached a definite charge. It was not the sort of letter which
would do any good. Collins' proper channel was consultation, not public
airing of general charges, and it is the opinion of the Daily that he
would have accomplished something through this method.
Collins' weakness in strategy does not, however, excuse the actions of
his self-appointed humiliators. Their actions were ethically as bad, if not
worse. This is clearly a case for strict discipline, ;md neither side of
the controversy should be overlooked. Collins has hurt Stanford by
relying too strongly upon his own judgment and convictions. His
persecutors haven't a leg to stand on. "The winds of freedom blow,"
but freedom is a relative matter.
