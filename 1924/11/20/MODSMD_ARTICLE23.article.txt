# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT

Editor Daily Palo Alto —Sir:
The cast of "R. U. R." in general
and two of the leads in particular, it
would seem, deserve a bit more credit
| and encouragement than was given
;in Monday's Daily by the Dramatic
Editor. I refer to Miss Lewis and Alan
Robertson.
Miss Lewis 'had a very difficult part
! and gave a splendid portrayal of the
character of Helena Glory. Her voice
! quality left little to be desired, she
did not overact, and she stayed in her
part at all times. To dismiss her per
formance with one paragraph rs near
l ly an insult.
As to Robertson —no one could have
been more sure of himself than he
was throughout the entire play, and
there is no doubt but that he ranks
j with the best who have been seen on
! the Stanford stage.
One more point—Ye Dramatic Edi
; tor pans the audience in no uncertain
terms for laughing at inopportune
, moments. This seems somewhat of a
paradox when it is remembered that
I this same personage handled the pub-
I licity for the show and gave every
! one —who had not previously read or
i seen the play—the idea that it was in
i the nature of a comedy. In no one
article did this gentleman refer to the
: serious import of the play or the les
son to be derived therefrom. Yea, ver
ily, the life of a critic is no bed of
; roses. —"George Jean Nathan."
Cornell Athletic Association lias re
quested that no Cornell student or
alumnus purchase seats in the Cornell
rooting section for Pennsylvania stu
dents or others vitally interested in
the athletic success of that university
for the game with Pennsylvania to be
played on Thanksgiving Day.
