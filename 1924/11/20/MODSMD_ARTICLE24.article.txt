# THE 						LAW STEPS
## 
### 
<& V. G. D. <$>
The closest thing to a man's honor
is the honor of his college. The most
insidious kind of a lie is a printed lie,
and when the one is almost irrepar
ably hurt by the other, and lawful retri
bution is impossible, an attempt at
some sort of justice is certainly not
blameworthy.
"Pleasant it is for the little Tin Gods
When the great Jove nods;
But little Tin G,ods make their little
mistakes
In the missing hour when great Jove
wakes."
And Jove has been asleep a long,
long time in the town across the Bay.
Two days before the big game is
no time to moralize; but apropos of
Professor Cottrell's advice at a recent
rally we submit the following to be
taken or left, applied to the Game, or
to anything you wish:
"If a youth would be distinguished for
his art, art, art,
He must keep the girls away from his
heart, heart, heart!"
Now you might go to Tolstoy and
look up "What Is Art?"
Having received a personal lecture
on "getting by" just before a medieval
literature examination last spring
quarter by one who has proved a flam
ing success, and having profited be
yond measure thereby, we cannot sup
press this: "The world is tougher than
college. There is no success there for
the man who only 'gets by.'
"By right of superior training and
education the college man should be
one of the few to reach the top of the
ladder, But the "getting by" habit,
once imbedded, is hard to uproot. The
snap course in college prepares one
for the snap course in life. The fact
that life is not a snap course makes
the consequences unpleasant."
The appropriate reply to this will
be hunted down and presented Tues
day. That there is an appropriate re
ply, be assured; thought it has taken
. ... personal experience to discover
it.
It seems that variety is not only the
spice of life to many students; it is a
dire necessity.
Ah, me! this quest of love! It evi
dently sickened even the most sweetly
docile Stevenson, and he graphically
expresses what you have seen a thou
sand times when he writes that we
are all "incompris"—all trying wrong
ly to do right; all fawning at each
other's feet like dumb neglected lap
dogs. Sometimes we catch an eye—
this is our opportunity in the ages—
and we wag our tail with a poor
smile. Why is Man such a fool; and
why do we continue to love him be
cause he is?
"Palms of victory, palms of glory."
Palm Drive is lined with 'em!

other's feet like dumb neglected lap
dogs. Sometimes we catch an eye—
this is our opportunity in the ages—

"Palms of victory, palms of glory."
Palm Drive is lined with 'em!
<& V. G. D. <$>
The closest thing to a man's honor
is the honor of his college. The most
insidious kind of a lie is a printed lie,
and when the one is almost irrepar
ably hurt by the other, and lawful retri
bution is impossible, an attempt at
some sort of justice is certainly not
blameworthy.
"Pleasant it is for the little Tin Gods
When the great Jove nods;
But little Tin G,ods make their little
mistakes
In the missing hour when great Jove
wakes."
And Jove has been asleep a long,
long time in the town across the Bay.
Two days before the big game is
no time to moralize; but apropos of
Professor Cottrell's advice at a recent
rally we submit the following to be
taken or left, applied to the Game, or
to anything you wish:
"If a youth would be distinguished for
his art, art, art,
He must keep the girls away from his
heart, heart, heart!"
Now you might go to Tolstoy and
look up "What Is Art?"
Having received a personal lecture
on "getting by" just before a medieval
literature examination last spring
quarter by one who has proved a flam
ing success, and having profited be
yond measure thereby, we cannot sup
press this: "The world is tougher than
college. There is no success there for
the man who only 'gets by.'
"By right of superior training and
education the college man should be
one of the few to reach the top of the
ladder, But the "getting by" habit,
once imbedded, is hard to uproot. The
snap course in college prepares one
for the snap course in life. The fact
that life is not a snap course makes
the consequences unpleasant."
The appropriate reply to this will
be hunted down and presented Tues
day. That there is an appropriate re
ply, be assured; thought it has taken
. ... personal experience to discover
it.
It seems that variety is not only the
spice of life to many students; it is a
dire necessity.
Ah, me! this quest of love! It evi
dently sickened even the most sweetly
docile Stevenson, and he graphically
expresses what you have seen a thou
sand times when he writes that we
are all "incompris"—all trying wrong
ly to do right; all fawning at each
other's feet like dumb neglected lap
dogs. Sometimes we catch an eye—
this is our opportunity in the ages—
and we wag our tail with a poor
smile. Why is Man such a fool; and
