## 
### Anne Waldron 
The senior women's hockey team
wrested a 4 to 2 victory yesterday
over an unusually good freshman team.
In the iirst two minutes of play the
freshmen made the first goal and the
*25 squad scored immediately after
ward. The score remained a tie for the
remainder of the half.
In the first quarter of the second
half, the freshmen played a brilliant
game and if they had been able to
keep it up would have won the game.
However, beginning with a long drib
ble by Doris Harter, who passed to
Carol Davis with a consequent score,
the seniors rallied and walked off with
the game. Aileen Brown scored once
more for the freshmen.
The freshman team was surprisingly
good. Emmabelle Ilagen starred on
the forward line while Frances Clancy
and Dorothy Cone worked some excel
lent passes. Elizabeth Bakewell, left
halfback, and Dorothea Hawkins, cen
ter half, were the main support in the
back field.
