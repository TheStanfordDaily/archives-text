# JORDAN TO DISCUSS TYPES OF SCIENCE
## 
### 
Dr. Jordan will draw the distinction
between exact and inexact sciences,
in his talk at 7:30 tonight in his home.
According to Dr. Jordan, mathe-j
matics can be used in exact science I
because we assume that each unit is
of the same value. In inexact science
no two units are of the same value so
mathematics is of little use.
In animal and plant life we cannot
say that two times two is four, we
cannot add two elephants and two
blades of grass and get a result. In
inexact science we have to approxi-1
mate a result by assuming that the
difference is unimportant.
