# STANFORD SOCCER SQUAD WILL MEET BRUINS SATURDAY
## 
### 
Stanford's soccer varsity will meet
the California eleven in the last of a
two-game series on the Berkeley field
at 11 o'clock Saturday morning. This
will give everyone ample time to see
the contest and get to the Big Game.
The last game played with the
! Bruins on the Stanford field Novem
: ber 11, gave the Cards their seven
-1 teenth victory over the Blue and Gold I
I out of twenty-eight games played since j
! 1912. Six games were tied.
Maloney has done a little experi
menting with the forward line during ;
the past week of practice, but no
| changes in the line-up have been an
;nounced.
Schoen Out
Art Schoen, one of the strongholds
of the forward line, is out of the game
; with a severe charley-horse. Cardoza
j will replace him.
j Cardoza, while very vast, does not
have the* weight of Schoen, but will
| ably fill the gap. Forrest at goal guard j
has been nearing top form and will no I
i doubt be at his best in the game Sat- j
i urday.
The backfield as a whole is doing
j
very good work on the defense and
the forward line is combining well, j
They are.using the long passing game
that helped them so much against the j
heavier California team on Armistice
Day and are getting the best out of
the outside men with their accurate
kicking.
