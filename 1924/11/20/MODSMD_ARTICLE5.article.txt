## 
### 
Five hundred freshmen and sopho
mores in the citizenship lecture this
morning started the hour with Cardi
nal songs and cheers. Professor L. M.
Terman appreciated the joke and lec
tured on "Fundamental Human
Traits."
The impromptu rally started with
"Come Join the Band" and went
through a gamut of the songs and
proved that the freshmen are "on the
boat."
