# J. COLLINS DERIDED BY INDIGNANT STUDENTS
## "Man Without a College" Title Bestowed by Mob Upon "Traitor" 
### 
Junior J. Collins, '24, who attained
considerable notoriety two weeks ago
because of his statements upon the
alleged ineligibility of certain Stanford
athletes, was the victim of a spoil-1
taneous demonstration by a group of
indignant Stanford men at noon today.
Feeling that some sort of a public
rebuke was needed to punish Collins
for his unproved accusations, some
ten iffrperclassmen seized him as he
left his 11 o'clock class, took him to
the postoffice, handcuffed him, and
tied him to a convenient tree.
A sign, "THIS IS JUNIOR COLLINS,
WHO HAS BETRAYED STANFORD
WiTH UNTRUE STATEMENTS RE
GARDING MATTERS OF WHICH HE
KNEW NOTHING. THE MAN WITH
OUT A COLLEGE," was placed around
his neck.
The men who placed him in this po- ;
sition are said to have intended leav
ing him there until a large per cent
of the students could witness his
humiliation. A group of men, including
several wearers of the block "S," re
moved the handcuffs, and his friends
at once untied him. However, the first
man attempting to remove the ropes
was struck by one of the instigators i
of the tie-up. before that group fell
back. The entire affair was started and J
completed within ten minutes.
Speaking of the action against Col
lins, President Wilbur expressed him
self as follows: "I consider the action
of those involved in this affair as dis
graceful and unworthy of either Stan
ford men or good citizenship."
The Men's Council, which has charge
of such breaches of student discipline,
had not, at time of going to press, is-
sued a statement of its stand upon the
situation. HoWever, O. H. Tucker, stu
dent manager and a member of the
committee, speaking from his own per
sonal views, said:
"The principals on both sides of the
Collins case should be punished by the
Men's Council, Collins for damaging
the good name of the University by
making statements that he did not
have the proof of and could not sub
stantiate, and the other men for tak
ing disciplinary action in a matter in
which they did not have any right and
subjecting Collins to a public humilia
ton."

UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA —
The Women's Athletic Association has j
invited nine high schools in Alameda j
and Berkeley to compete at an annual
women's field day to be held on the
campus. A tea and dance will be given
in honor of the visitors.
Junior J. Collins, '24, who attained
considerable notoriety two weeks ago
because of his statements upon the
alleged ineligibility of certain Stanford
athletes, was the victim of a spoil-1
taneous demonstration by a group of
indignant Stanford men at noon today.
Feeling that some sort of a public
rebuke was needed to punish Collins
for his unproved accusations, some
ten iffrperclassmen seized him as he
left his 11 o'clock class, took him to
the postoffice, handcuffed him, and
tied him to a convenient tree.
A sign, "THIS IS JUNIOR COLLINS,
WHO HAS BETRAYED STANFORD
WiTH UNTRUE STATEMENTS RE
GARDING MATTERS OF WHICH HE
KNEW NOTHING. THE MAN WITH
OUT A COLLEGE," was placed around
his neck.
The men who placed him in this po- ;
sition are said to have intended leav
ing him there until a large per cent
of the students could witness his
humiliation. A group of men, including
several wearers of the block "S," re
moved the handcuffs, and his friends
at once untied him. However, the first
man attempting to remove the ropes
was struck by one of the instigators i
of the tie-up. before that group fell
back. The entire affair was started and J
completed within ten minutes.
Speaking of the action against Col
lins, President Wilbur expressed him
self as follows: "I consider the action
of those involved in this affair as dis
graceful and unworthy of either Stan
ford men or good citizenship."
The Men's Council, which has charge
of such breaches of student discipline,
had not, at time of going to press, is-
sued a statement of its stand upon the
situation. HoWever, O. H. Tucker, stu
dent manager and a member of the
committee, speaking from his own per
sonal views, said:
"The principals on both sides of the
Collins case should be punished by the
Men's Council, Collins for damaging
the good name of the University by
making statements that he did not
have the proof of and could not sub
stantiate, and the other men for tak
ing disciplinary action in a matter in
which they did not have any right and
subjecting Collins to a public humilia
ton."
