# OPTIMISM EVIDENCED BY COACHES, CAPTAIN
## "POP" WARNER IS SATISFIED WITH HIS TEAM Andy Kerr, "Tiny" Thornhill, Jim Lawson All Agree That Cards Have Excellent Chance 
### Jim Lawson Glenn "Pop" Warner (Varsity Football Coach Coach Andrew Kerr 
I believe that for the first time in
five years, we have an even break with
the California team. We have been
aiming at the Big Game since "Pop"
arrived on the Farm in September.
It is my opinion that the team has
been gradually improving, until now
it is at its height.
We can win tomorrow if we get our
share of the breaks, but we are not
going to wait for them to come to us.
We are going to make our own breaks.
The team is in perfect physical con
dition and I believe it is also in per
fect mental condition.
Our reserves are a strong point in
favor of Stanford. The second team
can scarcely be distinguished from the

first and if substitutes are used, the
team will be strengthened instead of
weakened.
Too much can not be said of our
coaches. We have the best coaching
system in the country. Warner, Kerr,
and Thornhill have put everything
they have into winning this decisive
contest.
I expect the Cardinals to come away
from Berkeley tomorrow with a vic
tory and I am confident that every
man on the squad feels as I do.

The team will be ready and fit for
the big game with the exception of
Nevers and Thomas, who are suffering
from injuries sustained early in the
season. With Thomas out of the line
up, as he is very likely to be, Stan
ford has only four veterans in the line
%nd there are only two of last year's
varsity in the backfield, and of these
two Nevers will be hardly able to
play up to his last year's standard.
Ted Shipkey has been filling Thom
as' place as left end very satisfactorily
and Hey and Bogue have been doing
good work as fullbacks. Our two
guards have not shown up quite as
strongly as Faville and Cravens did

last year and our quarterbacks have
not as yet shown the ability that for
mer Captain Campbell did so that in
dividually the team cannot be said to
be any better than last year's team
i and it is doubtful if they will average
' up as strong.
The Stanford team has had no other
big game to test its strength and I
I have felt right along that when the
real big test did come the team would
play about fifty per cent better than
it has yet played. I have every confi
dence that this will prove to be the

case.
The team has proved itself good de
fensively but has not as well on the
offensive as I believe it is capable of
doing. Our kicking game has been
fairly good and our passing has greatly
improved and we have a number of
plays which we have been able to
save especially for the California
game.
California, starting out with a num
ber of untried men, has steadily im
proved and, having played a harder
schedule than Stanford, is a veteran
team now.
It should be a great game with the
chances of victory about even.

The Stanford-California Big Game
this year is a much more important
contest than it has been for many
years. The result of this game will not
only decide the Stanford-California
supremacy but to the winner will go
the title of Champion of the Pacific
Coast. This should make the game a
real classic.
The-* California team has gone
through a slow process of evolution
and np to the present time has met
the games on its schedule satisfactor
ly. In the early-season games the
Bears were weak on defense and their
attack lacked consistency. The early
season form also showed evidence of a
rather mediocre line. This line weak


"Pop" Warner, center, is pointing out the possibilities of Stafford in the
Big Game tomorrow to "Tiny" Thornhill, left, and Andy Kerr, right.
