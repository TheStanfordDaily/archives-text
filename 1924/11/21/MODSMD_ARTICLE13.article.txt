# CABBAGES and THINGS
## PERFECT BEHAVIOR FOR ROOTERS 
### Hal 
When your team runs on the field
jump up and throw the hat of the man
in front of you in the air. If he doesn't
get up at that you will know he is a
cripple. Call him a nasty name and he
will get up anyway.

Before entering the stadium buy
three programs. Two of these are for
your neighbors and the other one is
for yourself unless the man in front
of you also forgot to buy one.

Off-side will be called if you are
wearing a red hat and are sitting on
the California side.

It is a good plan before the game
to practice jumping up quickly. If
you become good at the jump you may
be able to beat the fellow in front, j
and see some of the contest.
* * *
Don't yell "hold that line" because j
they are probably doing it anyway and!
it just puts ideas into the referee's
head.
* * *
Before the celebration starts, learn
to distinguish friend from foe. The
Stanford m»n v are wearing red vests
and the California supporters. Neither
will have on a policeman's Uniform.
