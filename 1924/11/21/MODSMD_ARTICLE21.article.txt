# HISTORY OF AXE DATES BACK TO 1898 GAME RALLY
## 
### Alfred Post 
Give 'em the axe!
Nineteen hundred rooters bellowed
their approval as the traditional wea
pon for securing fresh Bear meat was
brought out at the Big Game rally
Wednesday night.
Twenty-six years ago, in 1898, a simi
lar scene was enacted at a slightly
smaller but equally vociferous Big
Gamo rally, when the original Stan
ford axe first experienced its first
Cardinal thrill. Today that same tool,
much tarnished from lack of use, lies
mouldering in a government-protected
vault in a Berkeley bank.
Here's how the transformation took
place, according to Theodore J.
Hoover, head of the Mining and Metal
lurgy department, who was a student
eye-witness of the incident he relates.
The opening game of the California-
Stanford baseball series of 1899 was
played on the old Haight street
grounds located near Market in what
is now the heart of the San Francisco
business district.
Original Axe Stolen by Bears
On that occasion the axe occupied a
position of honor in the Stanford root
ing section, where it excited the envy
and jealousy of the Blue and Gold
cohorts. For some reason beyond all
comprehension no guard was provided
by the Cards for the gleaming weapon.
Instead, it was entrusted to one man,
E. A. Strout, who is now manager of

the San Francisco Mines of Mexico,
Ltd. As Strout was going down a side
street after the game he was over
powered by a group of about twenty
California supporters and the axe was !
taken from him.
The Berkeleyites celebrated the cap- |
ture of the trophy in gala style, hold
ing a banquet and rally at a leading
San Francisco hotel the same night.
Fearful that this prize would be re
gained by its rightful owners, the |
thieves caused it to be locked in a
vault, and they did not dare even to 1

bring it outside the bank building for
many years. Finally they became suf
ficiently brave to remove it, under a
guard composed of the entire freshman
class, for the axe rally held a few
days before the annual Big Meet. After
being paraded for half an hour, the
rusty tool is hurriedly returned to its
dungeon.
$10,000 Offered for Recovery
Stanford alumni offered a reward
of $10,000 for any undergraduates who
should regain the weapon, but the
I

! years slipped by without anyone devis
ing a feasible mode of attack. As far
I as is known the reward is still stand
ing, but the identity of the persons
who offered it is forgotten.
New Axe in 1922
In 1922 the old symbol was reborn.
At the Big Game rally in that year
the gleaming, red broad-axe that was
shown Wednesday night was brought
out. It has more rfeal history behind it
than the original tool, as it was found
in the Bret Harte country by J. E.

Peterson, a resident of Palo Alto who
has been connected with the Univer
sity for many years. In all probability
it was wielded by some old pioneer.
It is now under the guardianship of
the Scalpers society.
While the old axe remains under
lock and key in alien hands it means
nothing. If it should come back into
the possession of Stanford it would
be surrounded by a wealth of tradition
which would make it a more treasured
relic than it had ever been of old.

San Francisco hotel the same night.
Fearful that this prize would be re
gained by its rightful owners, the |
thieves caused it to be locked in a
vault, and they did not dare even to 1

bring it outside the bank building for
many years. Finally they became suf
ficiently brave to remove it, under a
guard composed of the entire freshman
class, for the axe rally held a few
days before the annual Big Meet. After
being paraded for half an hour, the
rusty tool is hurriedly returned to its
dungeon.
$10,000 Offered for Recovery
Stanford alumni offered a reward
of $10,000 for any undergraduates who
should regain the weapon, but the
I

! years slipped by without anyone devis
ing a feasible mode of attack. As far
I as is known the reward is still stand
ing, but the identity of the persons
who offered it is forgotten.
New Axe in 1922
In 1922 the old symbol was reborn.
At the Big Game rally in that year
the gleaming, red broad-axe that was
shown Wednesday night was brought
out. It has more rfeal history behind it
than the original tool, as it was found
in the Bret Harte country by J. E.

Peterson, a resident of Palo Alto who
has been connected with the Univer
sity for many years. In all probability
it was wielded by some old pioneer.
It is now under the guardianship of
the Scalpers society.
While the old axe remains under
lock and key in alien hands it means
nothing. If it should come back into
the possession of Stanford it would
be surrounded by a wealth of tradition
which would make it a more treasured
relic than it had ever been of old.
Give 'em the axe!
Nineteen hundred rooters bellowed
their approval as the traditional wea
pon for securing fresh Bear meat was
brought out at the Big Game rally
Wednesday night.
Twenty-six years ago, in 1898, a simi
lar scene was enacted at a slightly
smaller but equally vociferous Big
Gamo rally, when the original Stan
ford axe first experienced its first
Cardinal thrill. Today that same tool,
much tarnished from lack of use, lies
mouldering in a government-protected
vault in a Berkeley bank.
Here's how the transformation took
place, according to Theodore J.
Hoover, head of the Mining and Metal
lurgy department, who was a student
eye-witness of the incident he relates.
The opening game of the California-
Stanford baseball series of 1899 was
played on the old Haight street
grounds located near Market in what
is now the heart of the San Francisco
business district.
Original Axe Stolen by Bears
On that occasion the axe occupied a
position of honor in the Stanford root
ing section, where it excited the envy
and jealousy of the Blue and Gold
cohorts. For some reason beyond all
comprehension no guard was provided
by the Cards for the gleaming weapon.
Instead, it was entrusted to one man,
E. A. Strout, who is now manager of

the San Francisco Mines of Mexico,
Ltd. As Strout was going down a side
street after the game he was over
powered by a group of about twenty
California supporters and the axe was !
taken from him.
The Berkeleyites celebrated the cap- |
ture of the trophy in gala style, hold
ing a banquet and rally at a leading
San Francisco hotel the same night.
