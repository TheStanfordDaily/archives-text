# HAROLD LLOYD WILL FIGHT PRELIMINARY CARD-BEAR SCRAP
## 
### 
Through arrangements made yester
day by Raymond W. Cortelyou, gradu
ate athletic manager at the University
of California, with John L. Murphy,
production manager of the Harold
Lloyd Corporation, several scenes for
the picture which Lloyd is now film
ing will he photographed in California
Memorial Stadium just prior to the
U.-C.-Stanford game Saturday.
At 1:15, Lloyd and the members of
his company, who will arrive in San
Francisco tomorrow, will take posses
sion of the field and, for probably half

an hour will perform for the benefit
of the camera and the thousands of
early birds at the stadium.
Lloyd is now engaged in the pro
duction of a college life story, part
of which is laid on the football field,
and it was in order to obtain the cor
rect atmosphere that Lloyd and his
troupe are journeying from Los An
geles. The noted comedian has abso
lutely demanded true atmosphere for
this production and will show college
life in its real plane.
In appreciation of the kindness
shown him by the authorities of the
University of California, and by some
of San Francisco's leading citizens,
Lloyd will produce one of his pictures
in San Francisco, or at least part of
one, when the opportunity presents
itself
