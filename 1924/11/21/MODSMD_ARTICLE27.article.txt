# STANFORD SHOULD DEVELOP STRONG BASKETBALL TEAM
## 
### Wilbur Adams 
With three veterans back and a
victorious freshman team to fill in tho
gaps, Stanford is predicted to give
California a fight for basketball supre
macy of the Pacific Coast this year.
Last year Stanford won the first

game from the Blue and Gold live,
but was nosed out in the other con
tests with the Bears. The Cardi
nals broke even in the U. S. C.
series and won every practice contest.
The breaks of the game were
against Stanford in the California
series. After winning the first
match, Cardinal hopes were hurt by
the injury of Oliva, standing guard,
who was kept out for the rest of
the reason, and Stanford failed to win
again.
McHose and Mcßurney will be
missed this season. Both have gradu
ated.
To fill McHose's position at forward
there are three promising men. Alex
ander, a substitute last year, handles
himself well on the court and will
make a strong bid for the position.
David and Southworth of the 1927
quintet show varsity prospects. Both
are clever passers but lack shooting
ability.
The most popular position seems to
be the running guard job left vacant
by Mcßurney. Grace, Mitchell, and
Harry Shipkey were substitutes last
season, and are eligible again. Ted
Shipkey, Price, and Anderson will be
trying for varsity for the first time.
Price played forward 011 the frosli five
last season, but was switched to run
ning guard a week ago. Both Anderson
and Ted Shipkey are heavy men and
fast 011 the floor.

Oliva at Standing Guard

Dave Oliva will captain the team
from standing guard. His defensive
work keeps the opposing forwards
away from the Stanford basket. New
house and King will substitute for the
captain if necessary.
Steele will again hold down center.
His clever jumping gave Stanford the
advantage of the ball many times last
year. Jayred, a sophomore, is a good
relief center.
The other veteran is Nevers, the
speedy, accurate-shooting forward. His
sensational playing was largely respon
sible for California's one defeat last
year.
Actual practice starts Monday night
in the pavilion with Coach Andy Kerr
out to take charge of the varsity
squad. The first games will be held
near the end of the present quarter.

sensational playing was largely respon
sible for California's one defeat last
year.
Actual practice starts Monday night
in the pavilion with Coach Andy Kerr
out to take charge of the varsity
squad. The first games will be held
near the end of the present quarter.
With three veterans back and a
victorious freshman team to fill in tho
gaps, Stanford is predicted to give
California a fight for basketball supre
macy of the Pacific Coast this year.
Last year Stanford won the first

game from the Blue and Gold live,
but was nosed out in the other con
tests with the Bears. The Cardi
nals broke even in the U. S. C.
series and won every practice contest.
The breaks of the game were
against Stanford in the California
series. After winning the first
match, Cardinal hopes were hurt by
the injury of Oliva, standing guard,
who was kept out for the rest of
the reason, and Stanford failed to win
again.
McHose and Mcßurney will be
missed this season. Both have gradu
ated.
To fill McHose's position at forward
there are three promising men. Alex
ander, a substitute last year, handles
himself well on the court and will
make a strong bid for the position.
David and Southworth of the 1927
quintet show varsity prospects. Both
are clever passers but lack shooting
ability.
The most popular position seems to
be the running guard job left vacant
by Mcßurney. Grace, Mitchell, and
Harry Shipkey were substitutes last
season, and are eligible again. Ted
Shipkey, Price, and Anderson will be
trying for varsity for the first time.
Price played forward 011 the frosli five
last season, but was switched to run
ning guard a week ago. Both Anderson
and Ted Shipkey are heavy men and
fast 011 the floor.

Oliva at Standing Guard

Dave Oliva will captain the team
from standing guard. His defensive
work keeps the opposing forwards
away from the Stanford basket. New
house and King will substitute for the
captain if necessary.
Steele will again hold down center.
His clever jumping gave Stanford the
advantage of the ball many times last
year. Jayred, a sophomore, is a good
relief center.
The other veteran is Nevers, the
speedy, accurate-shooting forward. His
sensational playing was largely respon
sible for California's one defeat last
year.
