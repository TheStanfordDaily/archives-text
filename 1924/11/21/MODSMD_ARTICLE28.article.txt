# "Tiny" Thornhill Has Confidence in Cardinal Varsity Defense Men

### 
I have seen the Univer
sity of California play
four games this season
and I have noticed their
continual progress. .In
thd early-season games
the Bear line and back
field were just showing
ordinary form. However,
they have shown marked impiuvouiciiv
from game to game until they have
reached the equal of their 1923 season.
The Stanford team has been brought
along slowly, taking each game in its"',
stride and never pointed for any team
other than California. They have
shown they are strong defensively
both against running attack and pass
ing, and in my belief no opponent
could gain consistently by either at-!
tack.
It's my opinion that Stanford has the
stuff to win and I believe they will
come through tomorrow. I
