# CALIFORNIA TEAM IS READY FOR CONTEST WITH CARD VARSITY
## Bear Squad Is Bruised and Battered in Two Hard Gridiron Contests

Californian)
A squad of bruised and battered but
determined Bears are impatiently
waiting the opening kick-off of tomor
row's game.
Although badly shaken up by the
two gruelling contests with Washing
ton and U. S. C., the California varsity
has the will to win, and is intent in
its purpose to put up the best it has
to offer in what promises to be the!
greatest game of the season.
After a week of intensive practice,
in which defensive tactics predomi
nated, the Blue and Gold squad has re
tired to Byron Hot Springs for its pre
game rest. They will come back to
the California campus tomorrow, ready
to trot out 011 the stadium field before
a crowd of ninety thousand eager foot
ball fans.
Coach, Captain, Confident
Both Coach Andy Smith and Captain
"Babe" Horrell place the utmost faith
in the spirit of the team, and are
dubious only as to its ability to stand
up under the hard knocks of the Big
Game. The Nevada game did not prove
as easy as was expected, and as a re
suit of it, Gordon White and Bart
Cock, both first-string tackles, are laid
up with injuries. A week's rest would
put both these men in good shape, but
it is doubtful whether either will be in
top form tomorrow.
Cock, in all likelihood, will start,
but he has a torn cartillage which may
easily cause him trouble. White, on
the other hand, may be benched with
his sprained ankle. In case he is un
able to start, Johnny Sargent, a capa
ble player, will take his place.
Line the Same
The rest of the line will probably
be the same as that which started the
Washington game: Captain Horrell at
center, Walter Rau and Dana Carey,
at guards, and "Snooky" Mell and Gor
don Huber, at ends. It has been a
fight all year between Frank Thatcher
and Iluber for the Hank position, but it
now appears as though Huber will get
the call.
The backfield is in somewhat the
same bunged-up condition as the line.
"Scoop" Carlson, quarterback, seems j
to be in best shape of any of the
quartet. A1 Young, fullback, sports a
trick knee that has caused him trouble j
all season, but with the attentions of
Trainer Charlie Volz directed to it this
week, it seems to have been causing
him less trouble than was expected.
Dixon Still Injured
Jimmy Dixon has never fully re
covered from his early-season injuries,
while "Tut" Imlay is still stiff from the
punishment he received in the Wash
ington game. This little gamecock has
earned the respect and approbation of i
grid fans the length of the coast for
the way he takes punishment, and he I.
is not expected to change his style of
play tomorrow.
Just what style of play Andy will
use against the Cards is in doubt. His
motto is "Always do the unexpected," !
and as a result, his teams never play j
the game they are slated to play. Strict j
secret practice has been the order for (
the past two weeks, and few, other j
than a mere handful of newspaper
men, know what Andy has been teach
ing his men to do.
Andy Will Have Tricks
He is certain, however, to have
plenty of tricks on hand, and hie posi- (
tion is additionally strengthened by ,
the type of man he is working with, j ,
Smith is satisfied with the attitude of
the men and has said, "The California ! ,
team is composed of the most willing i
bunch of men that I have ever had j :
the pleasure to coach. Their morale is j 1
excellent, and as fighters, I have never i
seen their peer." ;
The team itself has few * qualms ; i
about the game. The players do not

seem overconfident, yet they lay great
faith in Smith's ability to outfox "the
old fox" himself, and in their own
ability to fight. They are firm in their
intention to shuffle the Cards for a
win.
