It seems to be a tradition of long
standing that pre-game footbaM arti
cles should be exceedingly neutral in
tone and absolutely colorless as to the
writer's real opinion concerning the
outcome of the game under considera
tion. However, 1 shall come right out
into the open and state that 1 believe
Stanford will win tomorrow.
The team this year is stronger as a
team than last year. It has acquired
more football knowledge and knows
, better how to apply that knowledge.
I believe that Stanford's team of last
year was better than the U. C. team
! and California is not as strong this
| year as she was last year; this is
especially true as to her line.
There has been considerable pub
lished about the contest being a
battle of brains against brawn. My
own opinion' is that the Stanford
attack will be in all respects as
brilliant as California's. The Stan
ford team is well-developed com-
I oftiation of brains plus power.
W6 on the "Farm" know and appre
ciate the worth of "Andy" Kerr and
"Tiny" Thornhill as men and coaches.
The whole country is familiar with the
abilities of "Pop" Warner. All three
of these men are very much on the
i job and they are out to win.
