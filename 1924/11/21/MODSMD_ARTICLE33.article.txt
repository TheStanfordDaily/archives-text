# CROSS-COUNTRY MEN TO TEST COURSE AT BERKELEY SATURDAY
## 
### 
Stanford's cross country men will
go to Berkeley Saturday morning and
walk through the California course so
as to acquaint themselves with the
country before the race.
Although the cross country run is
not until Wednesday afternoon, Des
cember 3, Saturday will be the one
opportunity for the Stanford runners
to look the ground over. The race
will start and finish at the Big "C." It

is a six-mile*run.
The team is greatly handicapped by
the loss of the captain, A1 Charles.
Charles strained his heart a week ago
and will be out until February.
