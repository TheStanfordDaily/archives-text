# STANFORD ROOTERS HAVE FOUR ROUTES TO BERKELEY BOWL
## Special Train Fastest, Most Convenient Method of Transportation 
### 
Cardinal rooters are offered a choice
of four ways of reaching the California
memorial stadium tomorrow: first, the
rooters' special going direct to Berke
ley via the Dumbarton cut-off; second,
the regular San Francisco S. P. trains,
and ferries across the bay; third, the
Peninsula auto stages to the city, and
boats across; and fourth, priyate ma
chines going to the city or going down
through Santa Clara and up the other
side of the bay.
The rooters' special, in two sections,
leaving Palo Alto at 9:50 and 10:50
tomorrow morning, will probably prove
the quickest and most direct means
of transportation. A third train will be
run at 11:30 if the crowd warrants it.
The f>:so section is due at the Oakland
pier at 11:35 and the 10:50 one hour
later. Direct service can be obtained
by transferring to the Ellsworth street
car, which reaches the Berkeley sta
tion, four blocks from the stadium, in
thirty-five minutes.
Key Route Faster
Key Route cars are faster, and stop
at College and Bancroft, within two
blocks of the bowl. However, a trans
fer is necessary at Alcatraz avenue,
which makes the total running time
several minutes longer than that of
the Ellsworth electrics.
Tickets Good Until Monday
Ten-ride commuters' books will be
accepted on all of the special trains,
plus an additional charge of twenty
five cents each way. Return tickets are
good until Monday at midnight. Round
trip pasteboards are on sale now at
the S. P. depot in Palo Alto for $2.
Trains for San Francisco will be run
on the regular schedule, and the usual
fare will be in effect —$1.14 each way.
Third street cars will be found most
convenient in reaching the Ferry build-
