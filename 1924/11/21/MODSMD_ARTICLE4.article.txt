# STANFORD ROOTERS HAVE FOUR ROUTES TO BERKELEY BOWL
## Special Train Fastest, Most Convenient Method of Transportation 
### 
Cardinal rooters are offered a choice
of four ways of reaching the California
memorial stadium tomorrow: first, the
rooters' special going direct to Berke
ley via the Dumbarton cut-off; second,
the regular San Francisco S. P. trains,
and ferries across the bay; third, the
Peninsula auto stages to the city, and
boats across; and fourth, priyate ma
chines going to the city or going down
through Santa Clara and up the other
side of the bay.
The rooters' special, in two sections,
leaving Palo Alto at 9:50 and 10:50
tomorrow morning, will probably prove
the quickest and most direct means
of transportation. A third train will be
run at 11:30 if the crowd warrants it.
The f>:so section is due at the Oakland
pier at 11:35 and the 10:50 one hour
later. Direct service can be obtained
by transferring to the Ellsworth street
car, which reaches the Berkeley sta
tion, four blocks from the stadium, in
thirty-five minutes.
Key Route Faster
Key Route cars are faster, and stop
at College and Bancroft, within two
blocks of the bowl. However, a trans
fer is necessary at Alcatraz avenue,
which makes the total running time
several minutes longer than that of
the Ellsworth electrics.
Tickets Good Until Monday
Ten-ride commuters' books will be
accepted on all of the special trains,
plus an additional charge of twenty
five cents each way. Return tickets are
good until Monday at midnight. Round
trip pasteboards are on sale now at
the S. P. depot in Palo Alto for $2.
Trains for San Francisco will be run
on the regular schedule, and the usual
fare will be in effect —$1.14 each way.
Third street cars will be found most
convenient in reaching the Ferry build-
ing. The S.. P. boats leaving at twenty
minute intervals are recommended as
being the best for the rooters. These
make direct connections with the Ells
worth and Key Route cars at the Oak
land pier.
Auto Stages Cheapest
Peninsula auto stages for the city'
leave Palo Alto every twenty minutes, j
They are a trifle slower than the trains
but offer a more economical means of,
making the trip. The bus charge is,
sixty cents, car fare to the ferry five-!
cents, and the boat ride eighteen cents, i
making an aggregate of eighty-three
cents.
Students traveling up the peninsula
by auto are advised to park their cars
on the San Francisco side and to cross
the bay on the ferry, as the task of
transporting a large number of ma
chines to the Berkeley side Avouhl be
practically impossible. The best motor
route to the stadium is from Palo Alto
to Santa" Clara, Santa Clara to Alviso,
Milpitas, Niles, into Oakland over the
Foothill boulevard and East Four
teenth street, and out Broadway on!
Telegraph avenue to Berkeley. This
routing is advised because tht? dirt
road from Mountain View to Alviso
is closed. It will avoid the congestion
in San Jose.
Colored Arrows Mark Route
* On arriving in Berkeley automobile
drivers will be guided to the parking
zones by red, yellow, and green arrows
corresponding to the colors of their
tickets. All Stanford supporters irre
spective of the color of their paste
boards, have been asked by the Cali
fornia graduate manager to park their
cars in the area north of Hearst ave- i
nue and to walk to the stadium.

Two fraternities on the campus at
the University of Colorado decided a
dispute by an egg fight recently.
Eleven men from each house lined u*p
on opposite sides of a vacant lot and
at a given signal threw a case of badly
spoiled eggs at each other. Nearly all
the eggs found their marks, so the
contest was judged a draw.

Trains for San Francisco will be run
on the regular schedule, and the usual
fare will be in effect —$1.14 each way.
Third street cars will be found most
convenient in reaching the Ferry build-
ing. The S.. P. boats leaving at twenty
minute intervals are recommended as
being the best for the rooters. These
make direct connections with the Ells
worth and Key Route cars at the Oak
land pier.
Auto Stages Cheapest
Peninsula auto stages for the city'
leave Palo Alto every twenty minutes, j
They are a trifle slower than the trains
but offer a more economical means of,
making the trip. The bus charge is,
sixty cents, car fare to the ferry five-!
cents, and the boat ride eighteen cents, i
making an aggregate of eighty-three
cents.
Students traveling up the peninsula
by auto are advised to park their cars
on the San Francisco side and to cross
the bay on the ferry, as the task of
transporting a large number of ma
chines to the Berkeley side Avouhl be
practically impossible. The best motor
route to the stadium is from Palo Alto
to Santa" Clara, Santa Clara to Alviso,
Milpitas, Niles, into Oakland over the
Foothill boulevard and East Four
teenth street, and out Broadway on!
Telegraph avenue to Berkeley. This
routing is advised because tht? dirt
road from Mountain View to Alviso
is closed. It will avoid the congestion
in San Jose.
Colored Arrows Mark Route
* On arriving in Berkeley automobile
drivers will be guided to the parking
zones by red, yellow, and green arrows
corresponding to the colors of their
tickets. All Stanford supporters irre
spective of the color of their paste
boards, have been asked by the Cali
fornia graduate manager to park their
cars in the area north of Hearst ave- i
nue and to walk to the stadium.

Two fraternities on the campus at
the University of Colorado decided a
dispute by an egg fight recently.
Eleven men from each house lined u*p
on opposite sides of a vacant lot and
at a given signal threw a case of badly
spoiled eggs at each other. Nearly all
the eggs found their marks, so the
contest was judged a draw.
Cardinal rooters are offered a choice
of four ways of reaching the California
memorial stadium tomorrow: first, the
rooters' special going direct to Berke
ley via the Dumbarton cut-off; second,
the regular San Francisco S. P. trains,
and ferries across the bay; third, the
Peninsula auto stages to the city, and
boats across; and fourth, priyate ma
chines going to the city or going down
through Santa Clara and up the other
side of the bay.
The rooters' special, in two sections,
leaving Palo Alto at 9:50 and 10:50
tomorrow morning, will probably prove
the quickest and most direct means
of transportation. A third train will be
run at 11:30 if the crowd warrants it.
The f>:so section is due at the Oakland
pier at 11:35 and the 10:50 one hour
later. Direct service can be obtained
by transferring to the Ellsworth street
car, which reaches the Berkeley sta
tion, four blocks from the stadium, in
thirty-five minutes.
Key Route Faster
Key Route cars are faster, and stop
at College and Bancroft, within two
blocks of the bowl. However, a trans
fer is necessary at Alcatraz avenue,
which makes the total running time
several minutes longer than that of
the Ellsworth electrics.
Tickets Good Until Monday
Ten-ride commuters' books will be
accepted on all of the special trains,
plus an additional charge of twenty
five cents each way. Return tickets are
good until Monday at midnight. Round
