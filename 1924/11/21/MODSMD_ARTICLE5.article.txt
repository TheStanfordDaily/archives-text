# SECOND CALIFORNIA SOCCER GAME WILL BE HELD TOMORROW
## 
### Harry Bennett 
Stanford's soccer varsity will in
vade the Berkeley campus tomorrow
morning for the second of the an
nual two-game series.
The Cardinal victory over the Bruins
on Armistice Day gives them a slight
edge when looking toward the outcome
of the game.

Passing Useful

The long passing game used by Ma
loney's charges has been a big factor
in their success. They keep the ball
out in the open and on the move, trust
ing to speed and accurate kicking
rather than the rushing tactics used
by heavier teams.
The forward line is very light, aver
aging about 135 pounds, and when they
were outweighed by the heavy Cali
fornia team they found speed, combi
nation and accurate kicking very valu
able assets.
Miron, Ta'am, and Sclioen stood out
particularly in the game last week.
Their fast agressive game and heady
rushes counted for goals when the
California defense seemed almost im
pregnable.
In the back field Ralph Howe and
Don Clark seem to be the nucleus
about which the defense is woven.
Their playing is always consistent and
reliable. Lew Forrest has made rapid
improvement at goal guard, and is
now a strong factor on the defense.
The team has suffered severe handi
caps this year, especially the loss of
eleven of last year's letter men
