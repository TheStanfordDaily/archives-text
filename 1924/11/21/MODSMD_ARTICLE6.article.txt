# CONFERENCE TITLE IS AT STAKE IN BIG GAME TOMORROW
## BOTH SQUADS WEAKENED CLASSIC SHOULD BE GREATEST IN HISTORY OF CARDINAL-BRUIN FOOTBALL CONTESTS LOSS OF NORM CLEAVELAND MAY CHANGE WARNER'S STYLE OF PLAY 
### BY DAVID MEIKLEJOHN 
mo those who have watched Big Games in the past and experienced the thrill
of each play, the disappointment or elation of each fumble, the suspense
of each pass, and the thud of each tackle, tomorrow's game should hold
even a greater attraction.
This is Stanford's big year. It seems strange to these words and really
mean them—they have been said before in the past, but when the odds were
against the Cardinal, and only hope there was to bolster the expectations of
the Stanford supporter.
The Cardinal team enters the field tomorrow unexpectedly crippled. Norm
Cleaveland has been declared ineligible. Around Cleaveland were based most
of Warner's plays. On Cleaveland Stanford depended for most of the kicking,
end-running, passing, and veteran experience.
Cuddeback will have to bear the brunt of most of the open-field running
and "kicking, and 110 doubt pasing. This is a large order for Cuddeback to fill,
but the unexpected is almost bound to happen in the Big Game.
Practically the only thing that remains intact is the varsity line, weakened
somewhat by the absence of Thomas, perhaps, but still the strong defense
which hastneant so much when Stanford had to hold on the goal line.
What the Cardinals will have to watch above all things is hobbling the ball.
Stanford has not been especially well versed this season in playing football
which was without fumbles or ragged teamwork. Tomorrow the problem
will be even greater with Cleaveland on the side-lines. It means a new man
in his place, not so experienced, not so sure of himself.
Tomorrow there should be, not hope, but assurance. Assurance that Stan
ford has a football team as good, yes better, than that of the Golden Bear.
But the Bruin should not be underated. It is in the contests that require
every iota of strategy, every saving of power, that the Golden one is noted
for winning And tomorrow's game will be a strategic fight. A fight between
two great systems, known the world over—the Glenn Warner and Andy Smith
systems.
The Big Game will be a fair exhibition of these well-developed styles of
football. The Warner system, based on fundamentals, primarily, against a
style which calls, for catching and taking advantage of the breaks, letting
the other team win the game for you.
Both teams have been undefeated this season. California has played tougher
competition and beat or tied it. Stanford has not gone against any real tough
opposition, but, nevertheless, the Cardonal, for the first time in years, has
worked up to a letading position in the Pacific Coast Conference race.
California winning tomorrow will be the conference victor by half a game.
Stanford winning the issue will in no ways be doubtful.
The game will be a case of Stanford power pitted against California
strategy. Stanford has the POWER, and California, beyond a doubt, will have
the strategy. This does not mean that the Warner system is not as strategic
as that of Andy Smith's, but simply that more emphasis is placed on drive
by Stanford than Andy Smith cares to use.
Hey and Bogue, fullbacks, will be the main pillars vast storage of
power. Hey and Bogue, together with a line which, undoubtedly, will open
the holes. Each of these players should have their big day tomorrow. Both
are more or less inexperienced, and it might be that, for a while, the excite
ment and tension of acting before 80,000 people will have its effect, but the
power is there and ultimately will show itself.
California, according to reports, is as badly crippled as is the Cardinal
varsity. White, Cock, and Imlay, all regular first-string players, will not be
in tip-top condition. But the Bruins enjoy underating the team before a
big contest. Andy Smith and "Babe" Horrell, captain, feel confident that the
Bruins will come out with a victory. "Pop" Warner and Captain Lawson look
for a Stanford triumph. It's the same old pre-game stuff, which is ultimately
decided, under a vastly differen atmosphere, in the game itself.
"Babe" Horell will be the man to watch. If there is any man on the Bruin
squad who is capable of winning a game by himself it is the California center.
He has a good reputation and has upheld it, will uphold it tomorrow, the
writer believes, unless the combined efforts of the Stanford center and guards
definitely check his line-charging.
California probably has the strongest offensive combination and Stanford
the best-developed defensive aggregation. It is about even-Stephen. What
Stanford will have to do is to hold the ball, through thick and thin, and drive
it by main strength and awkwardness within scoring distance of the Bruin
goal line.
"Tut" Imlay, safety man for California, has proved to be more or less of a
sensation in the past few games. He was practically responsible for the
California victory over U. S. C. But Imlay is not in as good shape as he was
three weeks ago. He can hardly be at his best.
A place has been made on the Stanford backfield for "Mugs" Mitchell, who
seemed finally to win.out in the race for quarterback. Mitchell showed up well
in the Montana game. His plays were called right, his management of the
team was good, and his work in the secondary defense, while a little weak
on passing formations, showed that he had improved somewhat over early
season form.
