# The 						Play's the Thing

In the light of developments, Stanford is bewildered. Currents, cross
currents, and anti-currents contrive to furnish a multiplicity of current
events, and the average studeiH is at a loss to get his feet 011 the ground,
or his brain out of turmoil.
After all, tomorrow is the day for the Big Game. Stanford's team
will enter that game in almost as much uncertainty as is the lot of the
student body, but it will enter with the same confident determination to
win. The varsity had, until yesterday, the best chance of victory since
the return of American football. It still has a chance, and it will turn
that chance into actual fact if it is humanly possible. It will leave other
questions and formative conclusions 011 the side-lines, and will go in there
with a single purpose —beat California.
We—Stanford men and women—have backed the team throughout the
season. We intend to back it through this game, and forever afterward.
Let this game, then, be the means of pulling our varying opinions and
projects back into the single track of Stanford promotion. There will
be plenty of time to settle everything, and settle it right. We can lay our
minor troubles on the shelf over the week-end and return to them fresh
ened, more alert, and more qualified to properly cope with them than we
are now, in the first heat of reaction.
The Big Game is superior to the Stanford campus. It is national —
international—and in it should be lost everything else. There can be
110 side issues. The varsity will not tolerate them—we must not entertain
them. A victory over California is the thing desired above all else. Per
sonal complications can come later.
Coaches, captain, and squad, we're all with you!
