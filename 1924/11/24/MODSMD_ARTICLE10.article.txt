# STUDENTS ASKED TO PUT REBATE SLIPS IN CLUBHOUSE BOX
## 
### 
Students who do not save rebate
coupons from the campus bookstore
are requested by Mrs. Edwin Thomas,
president of the Women's Clubhouse
board, to deposit their slips in the
clubhouse box, which is placed just
inside the door of the bookstore.
For several years the class of 1924
had a box to receive deposits, placed
rear the clubhouse box, and as a re
sult the proceeds were divided. With
the graduation of the class last year,
the Women's Clubhouse is left without
competition for the rebate slips.
Money collected in this manner is
used to pay off the mortgage on the
clubhouse building. Last year, by
means of the rebate slips, and other
more profitable devices, $1500 was paid
on the debt, and the total sum left to
pay is now $2500. The board hopes to
clear this in the next two years and is
accordingly asking the co-operation of
the students in securing rebate money.
