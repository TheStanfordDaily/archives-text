# "SCHOOL PROGRAM" WILL BE SUBJECT OF LECTURE
## Marietta Johnson, Creator of New Teaching Method, Speaks on Theory 
### 
"The School Program" will be the
subject of a lecture by Mrs. Marietta
Johnson at 7:30 in the Little Theatre
tonight. Mrs. Johnson, who is the
: creator of a new teaching method
based upon the principles of Rousseau
1 and Froebel, has been giving a series
of lectures in Palo Alto to explain her
theory, and in her talk this evening
j will show how this theory can be ap
plied.
In 1907 Mrs. Johnson opened the
School of Organic Education at Fair
hope, Alabama, and began to develop
her idea of not so much teaching chil
dren as letting them grow. Her school
has been so popular and successful
that Mrs. Johnson has founded two
more schoools, one at Greenwich, Con
necticut, and one at Montclair,' New
Jersey.
Professor John Dewey of Columbia
University says of Mrs. Johnson's sys
tem, "In my opinion her school has
demonstrated that it is possible for
children to lead the same natural lives
in school that they lead in homes of
the right sort out of school; to pro
gress bodily, mentally, and morally in
school without factitious pressure, re
wards, examinations, grades, or promo
tions, while they acquire sufficient
control of the conventional tools of
learning and of the study of books —
reading, writing, and figuring—to be
able to use them independently."
At present the School of Organic
Education has a campus of ten acres,
nine buildings, and 240 pupils. The
school, which is coeducational, offers
courses ranging from kindergarten
through a complete high school course,
and in addition a two years' course
for teachers.
Mrs. Johnson came to California at
the request of La Vero Foundation, a
San Francisco non-political, non-sec
tarian educational center. C. E. Rugh,
professor of Education at the Univer
sity of California, says, "The coming
of Mrs. Marietta Johnson should be
treated as a great public event. In
this mechanistic, materialistic age
parents and teachers need to see and
hear such an educational seer as Mrs.
Johnson in order to revive their faith
in the dignity and worth of childhood
and help in the development and con
servation of our human resources."
