## 
### 
Contrary to the insistent reports of
the death of Warren G. Moody, varsity
basketball player, rumor has it that
he is still alive. In fact, Moody made
the following statement late last night
to lilt the responsibility from the Daily
Palo Alto:
"The rumor of my death is grossly
exaggerated. I am not dead and at
present have no intentions to become
so."
When the report first came to the
Daily office an immediate investiga
tion was started. Through the late
hours of the night investigators were
unable to find any one to either con
firm or deny the report so it was
finally thought best to await the re
turn of Moody. His statement should
clear all doubt from the minds of*the
interested campus.
