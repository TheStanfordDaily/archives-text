# FORTY BASKETBALL MEN OUT AT FIRST VARSITY PRACTICE
## 
### 
Basketball practice started yester
day afternoon with a large turn out
in the pavilion. Over forty men signed
up for the varsity.
Andy Kerr took charge of the sport.
He divided the squad, so he could give
special attention to the most promis
ing material. Steele, Oliva, Anderson,
Price, David, Smith, Alexander, Si
mons, Jayred and Carter were chosen
for the first squad on the first night.
"Nip" McHose, last year's captain,
was on the court helping the coach.
Kerr has the problem of finding two
new forwards for the 1925 team, since
McHose has graduated and Nevers is
injured from football.
The first practice consisted mainly
in shooting baskets and in rapid pass
ing. None of the basketball men who
have been playing football this season
were out yesterday. Most of them will
be. out next week.
The freshmen answered the first call
fifty strong. Coach "Husky" Hunt has
all sizes and varieties of men to pick
from. Very little is known of the 1928
players and Hunt expects to take his
time in picking a squad.
Hal Davis was in charge of the
lightweight teams. Only twenty-five
players showed up for the 7 o'clock
practice. More men are expected to
sign up for these lighter quintets this
evening. Davis will conduct practice
from 7 until 9 on Tuesday, Wednesday,
and Thursday evenings this quarter.
