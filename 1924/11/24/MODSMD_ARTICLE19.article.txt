# RESERVES FORM BASIS OF 1925 GRIDIRON TEAM
## Freshmen Will Play Large Part in Choosing of Backfield Men 
### 
"Pop" Warner will have quite a bit
of developing to do for his 1925 varsity
football team, but he has a wealth of
material from which to choose.
The loss of nine veterans makes
quite a hole in the possibilities for a
successful next season, but the
strength of the Cardinal reserve teams
makes \t improbable that these men
will be greatly missed.
Warner loses Jim Lawson and Art
Thomas, veteran ends; Harry Shipkey
and "Chuck" Johnston at tackles, Bill
Neill at guard, George Baker at center,
Cuddeback, Hey, and Kelly in the
backfield.
From the first-string squad he re
tains: Ted Shipkey and Middleton,
ends; Fred Solomon and Howard Mit
chell, quarterbacks; and Nevers and
Bogue at fullback.
There are a great many men left on
the squad, who have shown up well
this season in pre-conference games
who have the experience and ability
to take the place of those lost to next
year's team. Of these are: Hunt, either
a guard or center; Sandys, a tackle;
Natcher, a possible center or tackle;
Van Hook, at center; Armour, a
tackle; Simons, a guard; and Trom
betta, a halfback.
Hunt and Armour loom as the most
probable prospects to fill the hole left
by Harry Shipkey and "Chuck" Johns
ton. Both of these men played on the
1926 freshman team, and have been
working on the varsity squad for two
years. Only the experience and super
ior weight of Shipkey and Johnston
kept these men on the bench during
the greater number of games.
There are many freshmen who might
be just the men to fill up in the back
field, which is left the weakest depart
ment of all. Don Hill looms up as the
ideal safety man, and Altaffer, who
starred in the Little-Big Game, with
a little experience should make a
cracker-jack all-around player, espe
cially in the passing game. Pabst is
another possible but not probable pos
sibility. The fight for center will take
on mean proportions with Mustain
fighting it out with Hunt and Van
Hook. Millage, fullback, will be more
or less crowded out of the running
because of Nevers and Bogue, but he
might be shifted to a line position.
Don Robesky might make a good
tackle, good enough to crowd either
Armour or Hunt out of the berth.
There is such a wide extreme, how
ever, in choosing men from a fresh
man team to fit on the varsity. The
dope can easily be turned topsy-turvy,
and it is better to figure from the more
experienced list of reserve material at
Pop's command.

or less crowded out of the running
because of Nevers and Bogue, but he
might be shifted to a line position.
Don Robesky might make a good
tackle, good enough to crowd either
Armour or Hunt out of the berth.
There is such a wide extreme, how
ever, in choosing men from a fresh
man team to fit on the varsity. The
dope can easily be turned topsy-turvy,
and it is better to figure from the more
experienced list of reserve material at
Pop's command.
"Pop" Warner will have quite a bit
of developing to do for his 1925 varsity
football team, but he has a wealth of
material from which to choose.
The loss of nine veterans makes
quite a hole in the possibilities for a
successful next season, but the
strength of the Cardinal reserve teams
makes \t improbable that these men
will be greatly missed.
Warner loses Jim Lawson and Art
Thomas, veteran ends; Harry Shipkey
and "Chuck" Johnston at tackles, Bill
Neill at guard, George Baker at center,
Cuddeback, Hey, and Kelly in the
backfield.
From the first-string squad he re
tains: Ted Shipkey and Middleton,
ends; Fred Solomon and Howard Mit
chell, quarterbacks; and Nevers and
Bogue at fullback.
There are a great many men left on
the squad, who have shown up well
this season in pre-conference games
who have the experience and ability
to take the place of those lost to next
year's team. Of these are: Hunt, either
a guard or center; Sandys, a tackle;
Natcher, a possible center or tackle;
Van Hook, at center; Armour, a
tackle; Simons, a guard; and Trom
betta, a halfback.
Hunt and Armour loom as the most
probable prospects to fill the hole left
by Harry Shipkey and "Chuck" Johns
ton. Both of these men played on the
1926 freshman team, and have been
working on the varsity squad for two
years. Only the experience and super
ior weight of Shipkey and Johnston
kept these men on the bench during
the greater number of games.
There are many freshmen who might
be just the men to fill up in the back
field, which is left the weakest depart
ment of all. Don Hill looms up as the
ideal safety man, and Altaffer, who
starred in the Little-Big Game, with
a little experience should make a
cracker-jack all-around player, espe
cially in the passing game. Pabst is
another possible but not probable pos
sibility. The fight for center will take
on mean proportions with Mustain
fighting it out with Hunt and Van
Hook. Millage, fullback, will be more
or less crowded out of the running
because of Nevers and Bogue, but he
might be shifted to a line position.
