## 
### 
Stanford freshman water poloists
-will play their only game of the quar
ter against the Olympic Club juniors!
on December 13 in the Encina pool.
Ernie Brandsten has been angling
for the competition for some time, and
concluded final arrangements yester
day. He had previously made an un
successful effort to arrange a game (
with Berkeley high school. The year
lings have some likely prospects work
ing out daily, and the Card coach was
desirous of trying them out against
outside opposition.
Luster and Andrews, men who have
had experience on club teams in the
south, appear to have forward berths
cinched, but Kincaid and Lawrence j
Dorcy may also be given a chance to
show their wares against the Olym
pics. In the backfield Maltby, Klein,
and Vandernaeker loook good. Hol
lingsworth and Miller are putting up
a hot fight for the goal-keeper's posi-j
tion.
Little is known of the strength of
the young Winged "O" players, but
Brandsten is confident that his charges
will make a good showing against
them.
