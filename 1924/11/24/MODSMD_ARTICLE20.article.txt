# OFFICER WOUNDED, BANDIT RILLED IN PALO ALTO FIGHT
## 
### 
One unidentified bandit was killed
and Officer Lawrence of the Palo Alto
police force was shot in the leg during
a gun fight which took place on Haw
thorne avenue between Cowper and
Kipling streets at 12:45 last night.
Officers Gorman and Lawrence, driv
ing by in an auto, saw two suspicious
looking characters. They stopped their
cat* and One of the bandits
covered Lawrence with a revolver and
took away the policeman's armament.
While he was doing this Gorman
sneaked behind him and gave the ban
dit a rap on the head with the revol
ver, and as he staggered a shot was
placed directly through his chest.
The robbers topk flight, firing as
they ran. One of their shots grazed
Lawrence's leg but did little more
than scratch him. The body of the
crook who had been shot was found
lifeless about 25 yards from the scene
of action. He was a man of about 45
years of age and was elaborately
tattoed. As yet no trace has been
found of the other bandit. Tools found
on the dead man's person indicated
that a robbery had been planned.
