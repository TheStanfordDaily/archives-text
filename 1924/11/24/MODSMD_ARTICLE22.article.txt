# Where Away?

Cometh the annual slump. Football has been king^—football is no
more, for another year. There remains only the selection of mythical
elevens and the application of the past to the future, with the exception of
possible post-season games. And post-season games are not so vita} as the
others.
With this periodical let-down comes the realization that, after all, we
are attending a university. Athletics, between now and Christmas at
least, are forced by their very absence into the distant background, and we
have nothing to do except that which we came here to do. And that fact
involves a mental re-adjustment.
The books will be delved into with more real interest and more con
cern. The end of the quarter is astonishingly near—it has been imper
ceptibly drawing closer, and three short weeks will bring it under our noses.
Three weeks to regain what we have been losing—those of us who have
been losing anything. Three weeks in which to make the past three months
count for something in our lives.
Fortunately enough, most of the student activities begin to fade away
along about this time, and scholarship i 9 left nearly with a clear field. And
it needs a clear field—more of the time than it has one. The student who
begins to "be active" unless he is gifted with phenomenal mental capacity
or an unusual power of knowing when to stop, must shortly decide to sub
ordinate either his books or his committees, and it is often difficult to make
the decision. For there is much of value on both sides.
University life is constantly expanding, and university activities are
correspondingly increasing in volume. And the large number of students
who either cannot or will not get into these activities put a much heavier
burden on those who do. There are many men and women of superior
ability on every campus who take no part in affairs, and likewise there are
many who try to do too much. The fault is divided.* If more would avail
themselves of the value of this training, less would find the training more
of a burden than a privilege.
Three weeks is none too long a time to allow both groups to get back
on a common footing.

THOSE OF US who were.associated with Miriam Hilton on the
Daily Palo Alto staff join in sorrow with her parents and her friends.
