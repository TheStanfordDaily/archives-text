# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT

The Editor —Sir:
In behalf of the most loyal and ef
ficient tooting section that Stanford
has ever known, I wish to reply to "A
member of the Squad," who in yester
day's issue of the Daily made such
unwarranted and unfounded indict
ments.
The members of that rooting sec
tion took matters into their own hands
and fought for Stanford; they organ
ized, they entreated, they coerced en
thusiasm. The yells were well-timed
and in sufficient volume to be heard
all over the stadium. The California
section was hard-pressed in their at
tempt to overcome such stiff competi
tion. The opinion of 98,000 persons
among the alumni, fans, and strangers
who witnessed the Big Game was
unanimous in pronouncing the Stan
ford rooting section nothing less than
perfect. The stunts were admirably
executed and there were few who
failed to connect with the proper card
at the proper time. Every man saw to
it that hfe and his neighbor were on
the job.
"Dutch" McCallister and his assist
ants were at their best. They did all
that could have been expected of them
and the "whipped, beaten, cowed, yel
low-dog bunch of excuses for college
men" put over something superhuman
in their efforts. At the end of the
game every man in that section was
hoarse and exhausted.
When the score jumped 20 to 6 in
California's favor the Stanford rooters
were wild-eyed and stark mad. The lull
was but a sudden shock and then the
fire bbized up and brushed all aside.
For five years the Cardinals had lost
and those rooters prayed, pleaded, and

cursed that there should be no such
repetition. The yell leaders had their
own reasons for not giving any yells
for a short time during that lull
though the rooters repeatedly cried,
"Give 'em a yell." If suggestion count
ed for anything in the making of a
20 to 20 score the Stanford rooters
were a mighty contributing force.
How a Stanford man, and above all
a member of the team, could hurl such
abominable words at an undeserving
audience is incomprehensible. Mem
bers of a winning freshman team and
block letter men in various sports
were fighting for Stanford in that
rooting section. —A Senior '25.
