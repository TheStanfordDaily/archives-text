The Big Game being yet unsettled
we turn to less weightier matters, such
as the price of pigskin, the deprecia
tion of post-season games, the utili- (
tarianism of a moral victory, and pro
hibition.
By leaving the last four topics out
of the discussion we are free to dis
cuss the first.
If the Tuesday lectures could be
postponed until the day of the Big
Game and held in the stadium we
could at least show the speaker a
LARGE unappreciative audience.
While Andy Smith was busy con
gratulating himself by shaking hands
with Walter Camp last Saturday,
"Pop" Warner figured out a way to
make Andy empty the water bucket.
We are going to find out what brand
of cigarettes "Pop" smokes and try
them during the final exams. With
only three weeks more to go it looks
as if we'll either have to open up or
break off athletic relations, and stay
out one or three quarters.
People with loose tongues shouldn't
tie others to trees.
"A member of the squad" is sore
because the Stanford rooting section
reached for their overcoats and forgot
to watch those last two Stanford
touchdowns. The writer is not intend
ing to pat the Golden Bear's hide, but
a yell like the California G-r-r-r one
wouldn't go bad in the periods -when
your bank roll is stuck to the wings'
of Mercury.
Everyone is worried because Stan
ford is not likely to win the Confer
ence title. It is rather an empty honor
and one which is better left unclaimed
this season.
The next step toward making the
Big Game a better success is to make
water boys of all the prqfessors who
are determined to give final examina
tions on the Friday before, and assign
heavy work for the following Monday.
"Brick" Morse is now completing
his latest revised edition of the Alibi
series. He has waited five years to
use it, and he figures that at least
98,000 people will either read or burn
it.
Some of the chapter titles will be:
"Mell outplayed Jim Lawson," "Carey
and White were the best linesmen on
the field," "There was a man by the
name of Cuddeback on the field," "I
knew all along ets," up to 500, then
counting backwards to infinity.

Students of Syracuse University
have pledged themselves to aid in the
campaign for the elimination of the
institution's debt.
Chlorine gas is used to cure colds
at the University of Minnesota. It is
the only university that owns the
proper outfit for this proceeding.
