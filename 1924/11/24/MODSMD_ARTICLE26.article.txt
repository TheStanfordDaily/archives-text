# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT

### 
The Editor —Sir:
"If there ever was a whipped, beat
on, cowed, yellow-dog bunch of excuses
for college men, the majority of the
Stanford" football team last Saturday
was IT.
Well, boys and girls, how does that
look to you? It's only a little state
ment that was applied, not to the
team, but to the Stanford rooting sec
tion by one of our noted athletes, tlies
pians, journalists, and what-not, who,
though a "member of the squad,"
warmed the bench during the entire
game. How close this gentleman came
to being a member of the rooting sec
tion, he himself only knows. The back
of his jersey is graced with an exceed
ingly large number, which it is said,
is the largest number on the squad.
But, to get back to the main issue,
it may be said that the papers around
the bay were unanimous in stating
that the Stanford rooting section car
ried away the honors of the day.
There is no denying that there was
a momentary pause when California
started going over, under, and around
our team to score three touchdowns.
The rooting section was awe-stricken,
if not grief-stricken, but it managed
to rally and let out a little noise again,
and the team rallied and let loose a
couple of scoring passes, and the final
result was so happy for Stanford, that
I don't see why Mr. C. S. (member of
the squad) and I should be squawking
so loudly about trivialities. Mr. C. S.
is a good friend of mine, and I hope
the friendship is mutual, but he cer
taintly did slip off the handle yester
day.
The much-martyred rooting section
came through and out-yelled and out
stunted California (thanks to the rally
committee), our frosh cleaned up on
the Cal frosh, and our own fighting
varsity made a vicious comeback, tied
the score, and saved the day for the
Cardinal! So be it.
