# PROFESSOR WING TO DISCUSS IMPORT OF HETCH HETCHY DAM
## Speech Will Be Made Before Palo Alto Business Men Tomorrow Noon 
### 
"The Hetch Hetchy question on
which Professor C. B. Wing of the
Civil Engineering department will
speak in Palo Alto tomorrow is one
of vital interest to Stanford," claims
A. E. Roth, comptroller of the Univer
sity. The address will be given before
the weekly luncheon of the Palo Alto;
Chamber of Commerce at 12:10 p.m.
in the Russell Cafeteria. Members of
the Stanford community are invited
to attend.
"In order to carry on any extensive
improvement of the stock farm, or for
that matter any property of Stanford,
it is absolutely imperative that we
have an insured supply of water. At
the present time the water for this
locality is obtained by pumping it
from underground wells and storing
it in nineteen large reservoirs that
have been constructed on the lower
part of the bay.
"This method has proved unsatisfac
tory for two reasons. The first is that
the underground supply is consantly
decreasing. Eight successive dry sea
sons have lowered the water level
very noticeably. Although there is
sufficient to last until the completion
of the Hetch Hetchy problem provid
ing that there are no extremely dry
seasons, the lowering of the water is
a grave problem.
"The second consideration is that
at times salt water from the bay has
seeped into the storage reservoirs and
made the water unfit for any use.
There is always the danger that at
any time this is liable to happen
again."
The site of the Hetch Hetchy pro
ject is Yosemite Valley and the con
struction is being carried on by the
city of San Francisco. When the gov
ernment granted the land it was pro-*
vided that the water power must be
developed and that all municipalities
in the bay region should share the
benefits without being incorporated
into San Francisco.
