# OVERHEAD EXPENSES AT DINING HALLS ARE LARGE
## Food Represents Sixty Per Cent of Increase; Rent Is Biggest Single Debit Item 
### Byron Williams 
lIOW MANY students realize the tremendous overhead expense under which
the dining halls on the campus labor? Do they know that only 60 per cent
of their good money returns to them in the form of food? That the remainder
is eaten up by such items as steam, electricity, insurance, lost and stolen
equipment, depreciation, and RENT?
Yes, RENT! Students eating at Encina pay over $900 every month for just
that â€”$8540' for the B*4 months that it is open during the year. University
authorities figure it on the basis of 2% per cent on the investment. They say
that the buildings are not a part of3>

the regular University system and that
they, in time, must be made to pay
for themselves.
Besides that very great overhead ex
pense to take care of, there are nu
merous other ones that likewise re
quire much consideration, so that the
student will get the biggest possible
value for his money. The Encina din
ing halls pay the University $171.33
monthly for steam which is used for
heating and cooking, a yearly total of
$1456.32.
Electricity is metered out and last
year amounted to $446.86. Other totals
for the year were: water, $225; insur
ance on the building, $512.52; depre
ciation on the equipment, $4000; and
fuel oil $1217.19.
The most amazing figures were
those classed under "breakage and
loss." This heading, as it indicates, in
cludes all things that were broken,
lost, and. stolen during the year:
china, $2168.09; glassware, $721.44;
linen, $523.64; and silver, $456.68.
Four thousand eight hundred (400
dozen) glasses were broken or stolen,
enough to supply every student with
two if they were given out equally.
Administration and purchasing is
centralized, thus allowing for very
good discounts due to the enormous
purchasing power.

Even though the student only gets
60 cents' worth of food for every dol
lar invested, that is considered an ex
tremely high proportion, for most din
ing places plan on a 40 to 45 per cent
basis. So Stanford students have noth
ing at all to kick about. When one
hears of low board in other universi
ties, it is because they do not have
to pay rent and are supplied with other
necessities, or else it is taken out of
the food.
