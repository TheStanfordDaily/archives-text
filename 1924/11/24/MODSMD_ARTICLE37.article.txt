# VARSITY HOOP MEN DECLARED ELIGIBLE FOR CLASS GAMES
## 
### 
With the declaration by Andy Kerr
that any man who lias not made a
block letter in basketball is eligible
for interclass play, interest in the
class series which starts Monday be
came intense.
The new ruling permits nearly all
the members of the varsity squad to
play on the class teams, and is ex
pected to result in exceedingly close
competition for the trophy. As yet,
turnouts for the four squads are not
as large as in past years, and C. W.
Davis urges that more candidates
come out for practice.
There will be full schedules for first
and second teams in all of the classes.
The opening game is set for Mon
day, when the juniors meet the seniors.
Forty men are trying out for places
on the freshman basketball squad in
daily workouts in the pavilion. Gurdon
Steele and Dave Oliva, varsity letter
men, are coaching the squad in the
elements of the game. Most of the
candidates have had experience on
high school fives.
The squad has been divided into
eight teams in order that the aspir
ants may obtain the maximum amount
of practice before their first game on
December 2, when they tackle the
sophomores. Men making the best
showing in interclass play will be se
lected for the regular freshman squad
by "Husky" Hunt.
Fenton Barrett has been appointed
yearling interclass basketball manager
by James Sapero, president of the
freshman class.

College of the Pacific players are
again furthering the interests of reli
gious drama by producing the play,
"The Rock," by Mary Hamlin. The
story deals with the character of Si
mon Peter. The beauty of settings,
wealth of costumes, and the dignity
of hues makes it of unusual popular
interest
