## "Decorations Should Create Atmosphere of Moorish Life," Says Holman 
### 
Several scenes from the "Sea Hawk"
portraying all the true realisms of
old. Moorish life will be brought to
the campus December 5 for the Sopho
more Cotillion.
In decorating, the same properties
used in that great Sabitini production
will be employed. The Goldstein
House of Properties in San Francisco
has consented to loan these valuable j
decorations to the sophomore class, j
In producing the picture the com-j
pany had Goldstein make up these
properties at great expense. As a re
sult they should create the real atmos
phere of Moorish life in the pavilion
on the night of the Cotillion.
The plans for the decorations,
throughout, are intended to create the
atmosphere of the Moors. The slave
stores, costumes, and architecture will
be brought in.
Decorating started this afternoon
when members of the Cotillion general
committee put up the cables and cross
wires for the false ceiling.
Starting next Monday night, it will
be necessary for every member of the
sophomore class, who can spare the
time from his studies, to put in some
time working on decorations and ar
rangements in the pavilion every
night.
In order to provide entertainment
for those who do work the committee j
has planned to have an orchestra pres- j
ent on several evenings. At the end |
of the period of working entertain-1
ment in the form of dancing will be
in order.
"We have a week and a half to
complete the arrangements for the
Cotillion," said Leonard Schwartz, at (
a meeting of the general committee 1
yesterday. "We have a lot of work to
do and in doing it we will have many
obstacles.
"Basketball practice is now being
held in the pavilion and Thanksgiving
vacation will start Wednesday. With
these two hindrances out of the way
we will have just four days left and
it will mean co-operation from every
member of the class."
