# REHEARSALS OF "DULCY" BRING FORTH TALENT
## This Year's Sophomore Play Should Add New Stars To Stanford Stage 
### John Levi 
Besides'providing a maximum of
entertainment last year's sophomore
play brought into light two exception
-ally valuable dramatic finds in the
persons of Marjorie Allen and Aileene
Burks. This year has proven no less
successful than last in either of these
respects.
The play, "Dulcy," which will be
given Saturday, December 6, will pro
vide equally as much amusement as
"'Captain Applejack" and it has also
brought to Gordon Davis' eye some
very capable actors and actresses that
have not previously appeared on the i
Stanford stage.
Probably the best of these is Velma
Handall, who will be entrusted with
the most difficult title role, Dulcinea.
If rehearsals are any indication at all
she will run away with the show. Her
part allows her a great deal of leeway
in its interpretation and she is mak
ing the best of it. She plays the part
•of the beautiful but dumb young ma
tron who is forever trying to fix things
up for other people much to the aggra
vation of still other people—but that j
is another story.
Two other feminine finds are Ruth
Jordan and Kathreen Clock. Neither'
have appeared previously on the Stan
ford stage, but no doubt the opening
•curtain will find them feeling very
much at home on the Aflsembly hall
platform.
Leslie Herth, Leonard Schwartz,
Lewis Andrews, and Marvin Park have
been exceptionally well cast and if
their acting in Dulcy is any indication
at all their stage career will not be
ended when the present production is
completed.
Charles Simons is not making his
debut in "Dulcy," as he was in last
year's Rain's Head Show and Junior
Opera, and the play "Dover Road" that
was given during the summer and re
peated the first of this quarter. He
is cast as the father of a very attrac
tive daughter and the husband of an
equally attractive wife that do not
escape the handiwork of Dulcinea, and
this double complex gives him a good
chance for some of his comedy work.
Judging from preliminary workouts
Gordon Davis ha# surrounded himself
with a group that will be able to put
on a play up to his usual high stand
ard even though the time allotted for
rehearsal is very short.
Prince Olaf of Norway is a student
at Oxford now.

ard even though the time allotted for
rehearsal is very short.
Prince Olaf of Norway is a student
at Oxford now.
Besides'providing a maximum of
entertainment last year's sophomore
play brought into light two exception
-ally valuable dramatic finds in the
persons of Marjorie Allen and Aileene
Burks. This year has proven no less
successful than last in either of these
respects.
The play, "Dulcy," which will be
given Saturday, December 6, will pro
vide equally as much amusement as
"'Captain Applejack" and it has also
brought to Gordon Davis' eye some
very capable actors and actresses that
have not previously appeared on the i
Stanford stage.
Probably the best of these is Velma
Handall, who will be entrusted with
the most difficult title role, Dulcinea.
If rehearsals are any indication at all
she will run away with the show. Her
part allows her a great deal of leeway
in its interpretation and she is mak
ing the best of it. She plays the part
•of the beautiful but dumb young ma
tron who is forever trying to fix things
up for other people much to the aggra
vation of still other people—but that j
is another story.
Two other feminine finds are Ruth
Jordan and Kathreen Clock. Neither'
have appeared previously on the Stan
ford stage, but no doubt the opening
•curtain will find them feeling very
much at home on the Aflsembly hall
platform.
Leslie Herth, Leonard Schwartz,
Lewis Andrews, and Marvin Park have
been exceptionally well cast and if
their acting in Dulcy is any indication
at all their stage career will not be
ended when the present production is
completed.
Charles Simons is not making his
debut in "Dulcy," as he was in last
year's Rain's Head Show and Junior
Opera, and the play "Dover Road" that
was given during the summer and re
peated the first of this quarter. He
is cast as the father of a very attrac
tive daughter and the husband of an
equally attractive wife that do not
escape the handiwork of Dulcinea, and
this double complex gives him a good
chance for some of his comedy work.
Judging from preliminary workouts
Gordon Davis ha# surrounded himself
with a group that will be able to put
on a play up to his usual high stand
ard even though the time allotted for
rehearsal is very short.
