## Candidates for Places on Freshman Five Must Have Experience 
### 
With one Bear's scalp on their belts,
the 1928 class has started out after
another Bruin. The freshmen have
handed in their football outfits and
are now working out on the basketball
court. ,
There are many promising-looking
basket shooters on the squad, but very
little is known of their past records.
The basketball season is so short thaj
time can not be spared to teach new
men the game. Only experienced
players are wanted on the court and
the men that have been practicing
this week have all had previous train
ing in the sport.
Bigelow, Altaffer, Hill, and Davidson
from the football squad, are the only
freshmen that anything is known of.
These four* men played basketball at
prep school. They are all forwards
with the exception of Hill who plays
at running guard. Practically the
whole freshman football team turned
out for the first basketball practice
last Monday afternoon.
Coacli "Husky" Hunt is in charge
of the first-year men. Organized coach
ing will not start for several weeks
as Hunt wants to give everyone a
thorough test before he thins the
squad down.
Games are being arranged with
junior colleges and high schools in
the state. More contests will be se
cured this year than before so as to
give a greater number of players op
portunity of showing their ability.
Last season the freshmen won the
basketball series from California for
the first time in several years. This
year's frosh appear equal to the task
of duplicating the record made by the
1927 men.
