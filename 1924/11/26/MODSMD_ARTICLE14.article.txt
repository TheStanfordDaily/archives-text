# WILBUR CLAIMS COLLEGE DEGREES SHOULD SUFFICE
## State Examinations at Present Time Do Much to Handicap Professions 
### 
"Degrees in engineering, medicine,
and law, once granted by a reputable
university, should serve as a basis for
admission to practice before the public
in the domain in which the university
lias given certification," declared Pres
ident R. L. Wilbur in an interview
today, during ihe course of which he
commented upon the universal ten
dency lo "maintain standards" in edu
cation without using the actual knowl
edge of the student as the test.
"Those who wish to practice these
professions and are not graduates of
a recognized university should be re
quired to take examinations under the
auspices of the state university," said
President Wilbur. "The setting up of

examining boards, while advantageous
in many ways, has reached a point
whore it handicaps the development
of the professions more than it helps.
"Either the boards must change
their type of examinations, making
them of a practical character, or some
other device must be found to free
the university and the professional
school from the narrowing influence of
rigid legal standards in the field of
education."
President Wilbur did not confine his
criticism to state examiners. Changes
within the university curriculum, look
ing to greater freedom of the indi
vidual student in selecting his studies
