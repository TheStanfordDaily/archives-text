# WILBUR CLAIMS COLLEGE DEGREES SHOULD SUFFICE
## State Examinations at Present Time Do Much to Handicap Professions 
### 
"Degrees in engineering, medicine,
and law, once granted by a reputable
university, should serve as a basis for
admission to practice before the public
in the domain in which the university
lias given certification," declared Pres
ident R. L. Wilbur in an interview
today, during ihe course of which he
commented upon the universal ten
dency lo "maintain standards" in edu
cation without using the actual knowl
edge of the student as the test.
"Those who wish to practice these
professions and are not graduates of
a recognized university should be re
quired to take examinations under the
auspices of the state university," said
President Wilbur. "The setting up of

examining boards, while advantageous
in many ways, has reached a point
whore it handicaps the development
of the professions more than it helps.
"Either the boards must change
their type of examinations, making
them of a practical character, or some
other device must be found to free
the university and the professional
school from the narrowing influence of
rigid legal standards in the field of
education."
President Wilbur did not confine his
criticism to state examiners. Changes
within the university curriculum, look
ing to greater freedom of the indi
vidual student in selecting his studies
and to stimulation of individual work,
were recommended.
"In some institutions," he declared,
"the M.A. and even the Ph.D. degrees
are obtained by docile students, or
others made docile by sad experience,
taking the set hurdles placed regu
larly for them by an over-conscien
tious and devoted faculty. Certainly at
least the Ph.D. degree standards
should be so elastic as to permit this
one degree to stand for original work
and individual achievement without
too much attention to units, courses,
and other evidences of meshwork ap
parently needed to give stability to
the ordinary reinforced concrete of
our academic structure.
"The defree of doctor of philosophy
should be conferred upon one who has
done original research. Standardiza
tion of this degree so that its recipi
ent reads certain languages and has
covered certain minor and major sub
jects is a mistake. The department
recommending candidates for this de
gree should take full responsibility for
them."
President Wilbur stated that it is
quite clear that the basis of univer
sity and professional training should
be one of maintaining standards, "but
the great difficulty is to define these
standards and not to consider stand
ards, quality, and progress as syno
nymous terms."
Radical reduction of rigid require
ments, insistence that every college
student shall take at least one sub
ject where he can obtain the facts
first-hand and an increase in the num
ber of set papers looking toward stim
ulation of individual work were recom
mended by President Wilbur, while he
urged that calendar consumption
6hould be secondary to actual achieve
ment.

an enormous elephant tooth which was

"Degrees in engineering, medicine,
and law, once granted by a reputable
university, should serve as a basis for
admission to practice before the public
in the domain in which the university
lias given certification," declared Pres

today, during ihe course of which he
commented upon the universal ten

cation without using the actual knowl
edge of the student as the test.
"Those who wish to practice these
professions and are not graduates of
a recognized university should be re
quired to take examinations under the
auspices of the state university," said
President Wilbur. "The setting up of

examining boards, while advantageous
in many ways, has reached a point
whore it handicaps the development
of the professions more than it helps.
"Either the boards must change
their type of examinations, making
them of a practical character, or some
other device must be found to free
the university and the professional
school from the narrowing influence of
rigid legal standards in the field of
education."
President Wilbur did not confine his
criticism to state examiners. Changes
within the university curriculum, look
ing to greater freedom of the indi
vidual student in selecting his studies
and to stimulation of individual work,
were recommended.
"In some institutions," he declared,
"the M.A. and even the Ph.D. degrees
are obtained by docile students, or
others made docile by sad experience,
taking the set hurdles placed regu
larly for them by an over-conscien
tious and devoted faculty. Certainly at
least the Ph.D. degree standards
should be so elastic as to permit this
one degree to stand for original work
and individual achievement without
too much attention to units, courses,
and other evidences of meshwork ap
parently needed to give stability to
the ordinary reinforced concrete of
our academic structure.
"The defree of doctor of philosophy
should be conferred upon one who has
done original research. Standardiza
tion of this degree so that its recipi

covered certain minor and major sub

recommending candidates for this de
gree should take full responsibility for
them."
