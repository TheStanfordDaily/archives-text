# Wallace Denny Picks Up Overcoat, Vest, in Berkeley Gymnasium
## 
### 
Members of the varsity squad were
so excited and tired after the Cali
fornia game that they evidently did
not have energy enough to put on all
their wearing apparel. Wallace Denny
came to the front, as usual, and res
cued an overcoat and a vest that were
left in the Berkeley training quarters.
The man who forgot these can have
same if he drops in and sees Denny
at the Encina Gymnasium.. Denny
hopes that the man who is missing
these articles has not been searching
in vain all over San Francisco for the
missing raiment.
