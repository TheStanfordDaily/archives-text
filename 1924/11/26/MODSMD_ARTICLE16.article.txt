# FORCED EDUCATION IMPOSSIBLE, SAYS MARIETTA JOHNSON
## Thorough Study of Child's Development Necessary For Success 
### 
"Compulsory education is impossi- '
ble," said Mrs. Marietta Johnson, in
her lecture oil "The School Program"
last night in the Little Theatre.
"We think of education in terms of
the future, instead of the present,"
she continued. "Even from the point
of view of preparation we should con- j
centrate on today, although education ,
isn't a preparation for life; it is Life
itself."
According to Mrs. Johnson, the
schools are engaged in "raising chil
dren" and it is to the best interest of
society to produce the finest type of j
child â€”strong of body, intelligent of
mind, sweet and sincere of spirit.
"To do this," she stated, "requires
a study of the development of the
child and of the nature and needs of i
childhood. The integrity of the nerv
ous system must be preserved,, the
order of development must be fol-1
lowed."
It has been acknowledged that the
mind develops through interest. Mere
informational studies do not tend to
develop the highest intelligence. All
conceptions are gained from experi
enc, not through instruction.
Self-consciousness is recognized by
Mrs. Johnson as a kind of fear, and
discipline as necessary for strong char
acter.
