# COURT CHANCES HIT BY LOSS OF TWO VETERANS
## Sophomores Loom as Strong Contenders for Empty Positions Left 
### 
Practically a new basketball team
will have to be built around veterans
from last season's five if Stanford
hopes to have the strong teams of
the past.
With the loss of "Nip" McHose and
Ray Mcl3urney from the squad, and
the possible chance of having Ernie
Nevers out of the early games because
of his football injuries, it looks as if
Andy Kerr will have his work all
! mapped out.
There is-some confidence being felt,
' however, that Andy Kerr can take
the championship material from last
year's freshman aggregation and build
up a formidable squad.
The veterans remaining are: Nev
ers, Captain Dave Oliva, and Gurdon
Steele. Harry Shipkey, who played
standing guard a bit last season, inter
changeably with running guard, might
fit into the latter berth with ease.
"Mugs" Mitchell promises to show
some ability to grab the running guard
job, and will be closely pressed by
the sophomore candidates.
Most promising of the last season's
â–  yearling five is Nelson David, a for
ward, who was the nucleus of the
Stanford Babe offense in the freshman
series with California, which the
Cards won. David is an accurate shoot
er, has the speed so requisite of a
good forward, and works well in pass
ing plays. David might well take the
place of "Nip" McHose at the forward
job on the varsity.
Fred Price is the other outstanding
man for a varsity berth. Price played
forward last year on the freshman
squad. He has the makings more of a
running guard; he is a consistent shot,
has speed and some ability as a guard.
Fred . Newhouse, the big-as-a-house
standing guard from the freshman
team last season, has the ability but
is likely to be crowded out of a per
manent position by Dave Olive and
Harry Shipkey.
