# STANFORD GOLFERS TACKLE CALIFORNIA TEAM DECEMBER 6
## 
### 
Stanford's golf varsity will stage its
annual tournament with the Blue and
Gold links team on December 6, ac
cording to word received from Berke
ley yesterday by Manager "Nick" Car
ter. The course has not yet been se
lected, but in all probability the Bur
lingame links will be used.
Each university will be represented
by a six-man team. Carter will choose
the Card team on the day of the tour
ney from a squad of eight or nine
men. As in past years, six twosomes
will play "in the morning and four four
somes in the afternoon. California
scored a sweeping victory over tbe
Redsliirts last year, winning all but a
couple of the two-ball matches. Cap
tain Fritz Ditzler will lead the Stan
ford brassie-wielders in an attempt to
turn the tables.
Carter asks that all play in the Uni
versity championship tournament now
in progress at Burlingame be con
cluded before December 6 in order
that the varsity men may have a clear
field. Contestants who have not played
their matches by that date will bo
forced to forfeit.
