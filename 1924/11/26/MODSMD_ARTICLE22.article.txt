# A 						Dancing University
## 
### 
Evidently not satisfied with meeting the student only in the classroom,
there to fill him with academic gleanings from time worn volumes, the Uni
versity of Kansas, conscientiously we trust, has opened a class in dancing.
The hand of the university is thus to mould~the social as well as the aca
demic side of the undergraduate's life. Perhaps this university course in
fox-trotting will teach its followers grace of manner; will imbue them with
a certain poise, not to be disturbed by screeches of wild clarinets, moans of
wandering trombones. If it teaches them the intricacies of latest steps in a
proper manner perhaps casual Kansan witnesses will not be offended by
the usual assemblage of wriggling couples endeavoring to accompany every
variation of orchestral tone by appropriate motions of feet and body.
The mechanics of dancing should be the subject matter of this course.
The one-step should be taught in its essential form—six steps forward,
half turn, six steps backward. The original fox-trot, with its four steps
forward, two slides to the right and back again to the original line of travel
followed by a repetition to the left, can well be explained as a modern dance
form. It is doubtful whether the undergraduates of this midwestern uni
versity can cope with the ramifications of the tango. That could be studied
in connection with the theory of dancing; held out as a form impossible of
personal accomplishment, but beautiful for its very complexity.
But the University of Kansas, if it is to interest itself so whole
heartedly in this side of the undergraduate's social life, should design sup
plementary courses, whose subject matter will benefit the student when he
is involved in the more complicated entertainments of society. A course
in taking tea would not be out of place. Undergraduates must all take tea
at some time, no matter what may be their feelings in the matter. Proper
wearing apparel presents another problem to the student which might be
solved by a University of Kansas course. If too much emphasis is laid
upon the question of dancing Kansas students are apt to find themselves
in a pitiable dilemma if their social life carries them off the dance floor.
But even though some will be inclined to laugh at this attempt of Kan
sas to improve the social caliber of its students there is some justification
for instruction in dancing. The custom of inaugural balls at the White
House is not to be brought back by President Coolidge because he cannot
dance. He does not wish to attend such a function when he cannot join
his guests in their gyrations around the center of the ballroom. The Uni
versity of Kansas must realize the embarrassment to a man in public office
who cannot dance.—Cornell Daily Sun.
THE WRITER of Monday's viewpoint seems to have brought down
the house. Several other communications on the same subject have been
received, but are withheld on the grounds that too much is plenty. A
"viewpoint" sufficiently significant to be worthy of refutation stands as
being not without some merit, for that reaction alone if for nothing else.
BECAUSE OF the Thanksgiving vacation, today's Daily will be the
last until Monday.

followed by a repetition to the left, can well be explained as a modern dance
form. It is doubtful whether the undergraduates of this midwestern uni
versity can cope with the ramifications of the tango. That could be studied
in connection with the theory of dancing; held out as a form impossible of
personal accomplishment, but beautiful for its very complexity.
But the University of Kansas, if it is to interest itself so whole
heartedly in this side of the undergraduate's social life, should design sup
plementary courses, whose subject matter will benefit the student when he
is involved in the more complicated entertainments of society. A course
in taking tea would not be out of place. Undergraduates must all take tea
at some time, no matter what may be their feelings in the matter. Proper
wearing apparel presents another problem to the student which might be
solved by a University of Kansas course. If too much emphasis is laid
upon the question of dancing Kansas students are apt to find themselves
in a pitiable dilemma if their social life carries them off the dance floor.
But even though some will be inclined to laugh at this attempt of Kan
sas to improve the social caliber of its students there is some justification
for instruction in dancing. The custom of inaugural balls at the White
House is not to be brought back by President Coolidge because he cannot
dance. He does not wish to attend such a function when he cannot join
his guests in their gyrations around the center of the ballroom. The Uni
versity of Kansas must realize the embarrassment to a man in public office
who cannot dance.—Cornell Daily Sun.
THE WRITER of Monday's viewpoint seems to have brought down
the house. Several other communications on the same subject have been
received, but are withheld on the grounds that too much is plenty. A
"viewpoint" sufficiently significant to be worthy of refutation stands as
being not without some merit, for that reaction alone if for nothing else.
BECAUSE OF the Thanksgiving vacation, today's Daily will be the
last until Monday.
Evidently not satisfied with meeting the student only in the classroom,
there to fill him with academic gleanings from time worn volumes, the Uni
versity of Kansas, conscientiously we trust, has opened a class in dancing.
The hand of the university is thus to mould~the social as well as the aca
demic side of the undergraduate's life. Perhaps this university course in
fox-trotting will teach its followers grace of manner; will imbue them with
a certain poise, not to be disturbed by screeches of wild clarinets, moans of
wandering trombones. If it teaches them the intricacies of latest steps in a
proper manner perhaps casual Kansan witnesses will not be offended by
the usual assemblage of wriggling couples endeavoring to accompany every
variation of orchestral tone by appropriate motions of feet and body.
The mechanics of dancing should be the subject matter of this course.
The one-step should be taught in its essential form—six steps forward,
half turn, six steps backward. The original fox-trot, with its four steps
forward, two slides to the right and back again to the original line of travel
followed by a repetition to the left, can well be explained as a modern dance
form. It is doubtful whether the undergraduates of this midwestern uni
