The Editor —Sir:
After having observed your column,
"The Viewpoint," with continually
growing interest for the past three or
four weeks, it has occurred to me that
from the nature of the articles you
might be tempted to give voice to a
problem which has been troubling me
for some time and which I also believe
to be one of vital importance to the
campus as a whole, both the faculty
and the students. In fact, it seems of
much greater importance than some
of the recent problems that have been
presented to the readers of the Daily
Palo Alto by means of the student
viewpoints.
This question which in mind
is not one which has arisen in a casual
manner. In fact it has only been ar
rived at through the deepest thought
and study on my part. Whenever I
pass down the arched galleries of the
Quad it constantly presents itself to
my mind for solution. In the dining
hall it faces me with no less a cer
tainty than in the classroom. Wherever
a group of students is collected in one
place the problem arises and still it
seems to be unanswered as well as
unsolved. Inasmuch as I consider it
of as great importance as the use of
personal invective in criticizing other
contributors to this column, and also
of as much value and sense as the
criticism of a very splendid rooting
section, I am taking thiS means of
presenting for the consideration of the
student-body this question: "Will, in
the opinion of the students—Jeff ever
grow as tall as Mutt?"

GIRLS I HAVE TAKEN TO GAMES
Prances was the first —poor little
Fran —I think she now knows a foot
ball when she sees one. . . .
Then there was Doris, the debutante,
who "really didn't care for football,
but mama says" . . .
And there was Lucille who linked
arms with the man next her . .
And there was Inez who was under
the impression that the stadium was
the place where one waited for the
dance to begin . , .
And there was Claire who consist
ently cheered for the other team . . .
And there was Eva who "understood
the game," and explained it to me and
everyone else within fifty yards . . .
And there was Sheila who smoked
steadily through both halves—smoked
MY cigarettes . . .
But she wasn't as bad as Sally who
swore every time our side lost an inch
—mother and father were with us that
year . . .
And there was . . . and there was
. . . and there was . . .
ITh huh! —I'm taking YOU tomor
row . . . —SHEER WIT.

The Editor —Sir:
After having observed your column,
"The Viewpoint," with continually
growing interest for the past three or
four weeks, it has occurred to me that
from the nature of the articles you
might be tempted to give voice to a
problem which has been troubling me
for some time and which I also believe
to be one of vital importance to the
campus as a whole, both the faculty
and the students. In fact, it seems of
much greater importance than some
of the recent problems that have been
presented to the readers of the Daily
Palo Alto by means of the student
viewpoints.
This question which in mind
is not one which has arisen in a casual
manner. In fact it has only been ar
rived at through the deepest thought
and study on my part. Whenever I
pass down the arched galleries of the
Quad it constantly presents itself to
my mind for solution. In the dining
hall it faces me with no less a cer
tainty than in the classroom. Wherever
a group of students is collected in one
place the problem arises and still it
seems to be unanswered as well as
unsolved. Inasmuch as I consider it
of as great importance as the use of
personal invective in criticizing other
contributors to this column, and also
of as much value and sense as the
criticism of a very splendid rooting
section, I am taking thiS means of
presenting for the consideration of the
student-body this question: "Will, in
the opinion of the students—Jeff ever
grow as tall as Mutt?"

GIRLS I HAVE TAKEN TO GAMES
Prances was the first —poor little
Fran —I think she now knows a foot
ball when she sees one. . . .
Then there was Doris, the debutante,
who "really didn't care for football,
but mama says" . . .
And there was Lucille who linked
arms with the man next her . .
And there was Inez who was under
the impression that the stadium was
the place where one waited for the
dance to begin . , .
And there was Claire who consist
ently cheered for the other team . . .
And there was Eva who "understood
the game," and explained it to me and
everyone else within fifty yards . . .
And there was Sheila who smoked
steadily through both halves—smoked
MY cigarettes . . .
But she wasn't as bad as Sally who
swore every time our side lost an inch
—mother and father were with us that
year . . .
And there was . . . and there was
. . . and there was . . .
ITh huh! —I'm taking YOU tomor
row . . . —SHEER WIT.
