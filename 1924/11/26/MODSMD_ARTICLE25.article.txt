# Freshman Golf Tourney Will Commence Monday
## 
### 
A freshman golf tournament will be
started on Monday by the Encina Golf
Club in order to get a rating of all
those freshmen who expect to make
the freshman golf team. Any freshman
in the University will be eligible to
play in the tournament.
All those candidates that wish to
play must sign up with Norman G.
Larson, 301 Encina, before Tuesday
night. There will be no entrance fee
for the 36 hole medal play tournd
inent, which will probably be played
on the Burlingame course. The fresh
man golf team will play the six-man
team of the California freshmen early
next quarter and expect to repeat the
performance of the 1927 squad last
year, which won from the Cubs.
