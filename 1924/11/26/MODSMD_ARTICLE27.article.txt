# HETCH HETCHY DAM PROJECT DISCUSSED BY PROFESSOR WING
## Details of Construction Are Explained to Palo Alto Business Men 
### 
Professor C. B. Wing, executive
head of the Stanford Civil Engineering
department, gave a talk entitled "How
Can Palo Alto and Its Neighbors Be
Assured of a Permanent Water Sup
ply" before a group of Palo Alto busi
ness men at noon today in the Russell
cafeteria. The occasion of the speech
was the weekly luncheon of the Palo
Alto Chamber of Commerce.
"The only positive assurance of a
constant water supply for this locality
will be the completion of the Hetch
Hetchy project," Professor Wing
pointed out. "The present method of
pumping water from underground, be
sides being very expensive, is not at
all safe. Eight successive dry seasons
have brought the underground supply
of water down to a very low level, in
fact it is three feet lower now than
at any previous time."
The grant that was given the city
of San Francisco enabling them to de
velop trie water resources of Yosemite
National Park provided that all muni
cipalities bordering on the bay were
to receive the benefits of the project
and that the water power must be
developed. Construction has been tak
ing place for over ten years and yet
there is still a great deal of work to
be done.
On April 1, 1925, the Moccasin
Creek power house will be producing
80,000 horsepower hourly, but water
will not be received in San Francisco
from the storage dam for at least
six years. The sections of the project
that are now nearing completion are
the Moccasin Creek power plant, Lake
Eleanor Dam, an eighteen-mile pipe
line over ten feet in diameter running
from Early Intake to Priest's Reser
voir, and the main darti which is being
built only two-thirds the size of the
original specifications.
The pipe lino from Yosemite to San
Francisco, which is well over 80
miles, will be a great engineering feat,
and besides requiring six years to
complete, it will necessitate a very
large expenditure. A $10,000,000 bond
issue has been recently issued by San
Francisco to meet this need.
A Woman's Rifle Club has recently
been organized at the College of Agri
culture at Davis, California.

built only two-thirds the size of the
original specifications.
The pipe lino from Yosemite to San
Francisco, which is well over 80
miles, will be a great engineering feat,
and besides requiring six years to
complete, it will necessitate a very
large expenditure. A $10,000,000 bond
issue has been recently issued by San
Francisco to meet this need.
A Woman's Rifle Club has recently
been organized at the College of Agri
culture at Davis, California.
Professor C. B. Wing, executive
head of the Stanford Civil Engineering
department, gave a talk entitled "How
Can Palo Alto and Its Neighbors Be
Assured of a Permanent Water Sup
ply" before a group of Palo Alto busi
ness men at noon today in the Russell
cafeteria. The occasion of the speech
was the weekly luncheon of the Palo
Alto Chamber of Commerce.
"The only positive assurance of a
constant water supply for this locality
will be the completion of the Hetch
Hetchy project," Professor Wing
pointed out. "The present method of
pumping water from underground, be
sides being very expensive, is not at
all safe. Eight successive dry seasons
have brought the underground supply
of water down to a very low level, in
fact it is three feet lower now than
at any previous time."
The grant that was given the city
of San Francisco enabling them to de
velop trie water resources of Yosemite
National Park provided that all muni
cipalities bordering on the bay were
to receive the benefits of the project
and that the water power must be
developed. Construction has been tak
ing place for over ten years and yet
there is still a great deal of work to
be done.
On April 1, 1925, the Moccasin
Creek power house will be producing
80,000 horsepower hourly, but water
will not be received in San Francisco
from the storage dam for at least
six years. The sections of the project
that are now nearing completion are
the Moccasin Creek power plant, Lake
Eleanor Dam, an eighteen-mile pipe
line over ten feet in diameter running
from Early Intake to Priest's Reser
voir, and the main darti which is being
built only two-thirds the size of the
original specifications.
