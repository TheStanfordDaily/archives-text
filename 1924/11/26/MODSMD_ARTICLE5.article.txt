Yesterday afternoon a member of
the Santa Clara County motor police
force showed the utmost consideration
for tired-out news searchers of the
Daily Palo Alto force. Although the
whole campus was available, he picked
a spot within 50' yards of the moth
eaten press building to stage a most
thrilling arrest.
The officer dashed up the road on
his steel steed and, with one blow of
his siren, he succeeded in picking two
birds. It is true he had to invade the
inner sanctum of the Roble Gymna
sium to nab one of them; but, like the
Canadian Mounted Police, the Santa
Clara policemen always get their
woman.
