# SINGLE TAX WILL BE TOPIC OF DR. JORDAN
## 
### 
Dr. Jordan will talk about Henry
George and the single tax theory,
at 7:30 Thursday night at his home.
Henry George first became a friend
of Dr. Jordan's about forty years ago
when he was a newspaper writer in
San Francisco, and before he became
a noted writer on economics. Dr. Jor
dan will discuss George's attitude to
the single tax.
According to Dr. Jordan, the single
tax is theoretically desirable to pre
vent unearned increment. It is a ques
tion whether it is better to seize the
property of wealthy landowners at one
swoop, or by degrees, or whether it is
better for the community to buy out
the owners. The first two he considers
impracticable, and the last unjust.
