### 
A survey of race relations on the
Pacific: Coast,.made possible largely
; through co-operation of coast univer
sities, is well under way. The survey,
jointly by five Pacific
Coast regional committees and the In
i stitute of Social and Religious Re-
I search of New York City, is in the
hands of an executive committee of
which President Wilbur is chairman.
Dr. Robert E. Park of the University
of Chicago and his staff conduct the
research.
The survey is described as being a
unique project since it is "Funding the
viewpoint on the Oriental of all the
major group of citizens, through the
service of such people upon the direct
ing committee of the survey."
The field agents seek the viewpoint
of the ordinary man who has had deal
ings with the Oriental. The survey
also deals with the reaction of the
Asiatic to his American environment.
It seeks answers to such questions as
these:
Are these alien races a liability or
an asset to the Pacific Coast?
Is Asiatic or Mexican labor cheap or
expensive?
Does the prosperity of the Pacific |
Coast depend upon Asiatics, or upon j
any other group?
Is the second generation of Asiatics;
adjusting itself to American standards
and ideals?
What are the permanent causes of
irritation and conflict that arise from
race contests on the Pacific Coast?
Remarkable co-operation from every j
part of the coast is reported for this j
survey project, voluntary assistance
of farm bureaus and local chambers I
