# COMMITTEE MAKES EXTENSIVE SURVEY OF RACE RELATIONS
## Research Seeks Viewpoints And Problems Among Asiatics in West 
### 
A survey of race relations on the
Pacific: Coast,.made possible largely
; through co-operation of coast univer
sities, is well under way. The survey,
jointly by five Pacific
Coast regional committees and the In
i stitute of Social and Religious Re-
I search of New York City, is in the
hands of an executive committee of
which President Wilbur is chairman.
Dr. Robert E. Park of the University
of Chicago and his staff conduct the
research.
The survey is described as being a
unique project since it is "Funding the
viewpoint on the Oriental of all the
major group of citizens, through the
service of such people upon the direct
ing committee of the survey."
The field agents seek the viewpoint
of the ordinary man who has had deal
ings with the Oriental. The survey
also deals with the reaction of the
Asiatic to his American environment.
It seeks answers to such questions as
these:
Are these alien races a liability or
an asset to the Pacific Coast?
Is Asiatic or Mexican labor cheap or
expensive?
Does the prosperity of the Pacific |
Coast depend upon Asiatics, or upon j
any other group?
Is the second generation of Asiatics;
adjusting itself to American standards
and ideals?
What are the permanent causes of
irritation and conflict that arise from
race contests on the Pacific Coast?
Remarkable co-operation from every j
part of the coast is reported for this j
survey project, voluntary assistance
of farm bureaus and local chambers I
of commerce being supplemented by
professional field investigation.
Definite findings of the survey will
be issued during 1925 in a series of
volumes edited by Dr. Park and his
associates, which staff includes Pro
fessor Eliot G. Mears of the Stanford
Department of Economics. These find
ings will deal with the principal so
ciological, economic, and cultural as
pects of the race problem.
In order to present the picture of
conditions the survey is getting hun
dreds of life stories from Chinese,
Filipinos, Hindus, Japanese, and Mexi
cans who have come to America. It is
reported that the Oriental student
coming to America finds "bitter dis
illusionment. From his detention at
the immigration station to his discov
ery that Orientals are not welcomed
in rsepectable rooming districts, in
barbershops, nor in Y. M. C. A. dormi
tories or swimming pools, the land of
his dreams rapidly fades, before the
America of his experience."
The younger generation of Orientals
the survey reports is not following the
footsteps of its fathers. It is leaving
the farm for the city, seeking the best
education, and struggling for economic
and professional status.
It is expected that some forecast for
the problems of race relations and as
similation will be made by the final
report of the survey.
"Captain Applejack" will be pre
sented at the University of Minnesota.

viewpoint on the Oriental of all the
major group of citizens, through the
service of such people upon the direct
ing committee of the survey."
The field agents seek the viewpoint
of the ordinary man who has had deal
ings with the Oriental. The survey
also deals with the reaction of the
Asiatic to his American environment.
It seeks answers to such questions as
these:
Are these alien races a liability or
an asset to the Pacific Coast?
Is Asiatic or Mexican labor cheap or
expensive?
Does the prosperity of the Pacific |
Coast depend upon Asiatics, or upon j
any other group?
Is the second generation of Asiatics;
adjusting itself to American standards
and ideals?
What are the permanent causes of
irritation and conflict that arise from
race contests on the Pacific Coast?
Remarkable co-operation from every j
part of the coast is reported for this j
survey project, voluntary assistance
of farm bureaus and local chambers I
of commerce being supplemented by
professional field investigation.
Definite findings of the survey will
be issued during 1925 in a series of
volumes edited by Dr. Park and his
associates, which staff includes Pro
fessor Eliot G. Mears of the Stanford
Department of Economics. These find
ings will deal with the principal so
ciological, economic, and cultural as
pects of the race problem.
In order to present the picture of
conditions the survey is getting hun
dreds of life stories from Chinese,
Filipinos, Hindus, Japanese, and Mexi
cans who have come to America. It is
reported that the Oriental student
coming to America finds "bitter dis
illusionment. From his detention at
the immigration station to his discov
ery that Orientals are not welcomed
in rsepectable rooming districts, in
barbershops, nor in Y. M. C. A. dormi
tories or swimming pools, the land of
his dreams rapidly fades, before the
America of his experience."
The younger generation of Orientals
the survey reports is not following the
footsteps of its fathers. It is leaving
the farm for the city, seeking the best
education, and struggling for economic
and professional status.
It is expected that some forecast for
the problems of race relations and as
similation will be made by the final
report of the survey.
"Captain Applejack" will be pre
sented at the University of Minnesota.
A survey of race relations on the
Pacific: Coast,.made possible largely
; through co-operation of coast univer
sities, is well under way. The survey,
jointly by five Pacific
Coast regional committees and the In
i stitute of Social and Religious Re-
I search of New York City, is in the
hands of an executive committee of
which President Wilbur is chairman.
Dr. Robert E. Park of the University
of Chicago and his staff conduct the
research.
The survey is described as being a
unique project since it is "Funding the
