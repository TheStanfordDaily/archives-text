# VARSITY PRACTICE BEGINS FOR GAME WITH NOTRE DAME
## Arrangements Complete for New Year's Contest in Pasadena Stadium 
### 
Stanford's varsity football team will
start practicing at once in preparation
for the Notre Dame game to be played
at Pasadena New Year's Day.
Agreements between the two insti
tutions and a signed contract with the
Tournament of Roses committee rela
tive to the renting of the Rose Bowl
in Pasadena are complete. All that re
mains to be done officially is to gain
the sanction of the Pacific Coast Con
ference when that body meets this
month.
Notre Dame is being hailed far and
wide as an unbeatable aggregation;
has already doused strong eastern and
middle-western teams under over
whelming scores and promises to be
Â«very bit as strong against Stanford
January 1.
Strongest Team in East
This is the first year that the Cardi
nal has been picked to defend, as it
were, the title of the West against
the aggressor from the East. It is
true that other Coast universities are
staging post-season games, which
might well be termed East-West con
tests. California is meeting Pennsyl
vania on New Year's, and the Univer
sity of Southern California meets the
University of Syracuse on December 6.
But on the face of it Stanford is meet
ing the strongest team the East has
boasted for many years. And Notre
Dame is meeting the strongest Stan
ford team ever groomed on the Farm.
Since the Big Game confidence in
the Warner system at Stanford has
increased by leaps and bounds. The
way that Stanford met the California
attacks and supplied new and novel
methods of offense few doubt but
that it is a come-through system.
Not only that, it meant that the
Cardinal pla/ers showed up strongly
against stronger opposition than they
have been credited with playing.
Nevers May Play
It is possible that Ernie Nevers will
be in shape to play against Notre
Dame. His presence is bound to
strengthen the team against the line
plunging Notre Dame backfield.
Rockne has developed a backfield on
the Notre Dame squad which has mys
tified every opponent with its varied
types of open field running and pass
ing offensive. Layden, Crowley, Miller,
and Stublidreher are perhaps the
strongest backfield combination in the
United States.
