# HOBBIES OF THE FACULTY
## DR. DAVID STARR JORDAN

MONKEYS, parrots, cats, dogs, and goldfish, have been among the pets
whose care is one of Dr. Jordan's hobbies. Several years ago Dr. Jordan
I had a parrot which could speak Spanish, sing opera selections—one or two
! bars from Pinafore—and give Stanford yells with more or less arithmetical

precision. Anoiner parrot, uuuiu
coloratura accompaniments to Victrola
records but could not be taught to talk.
Dr. Jordan found that the monkeys
made very good friends with their con-1
i temporary pets. Kittens especially
seem to have had a warm though
scarcely .appreciated place in their af
fections. One monkey carried a kitten
lip to the top of the barn where he >
was dislodged with great difficulty j
several hours later.
Among the less domesticated pets

have been a flock of quail, gray squir
rels, and other birds and beasta which
are frequent visitors of the garden.
Just now the household menagerie
consists of an Airedale dog, Jill, a
small cat, Ben, and some goldfish. A
pool in the garden contains fish of
many varieties, while there are some
tiny tropical flsli in a small bowl in
j the house. These Dr. Jordan does not
dare to expose to the cold outside air
or to the appetites of the larger fish.
