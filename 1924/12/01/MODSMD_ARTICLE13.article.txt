# ALUMNI VETERANS PLAN FOR BUILDING OF MEMORIAL HALL
## 
### 
In response to suggestions from sev
eral Stanford alumni, John A. Sellards,
endowment secretary, has put forward
a plan to the 2000 alumni who are
veterans of the World War and en
titled to bonus policies, that they pool
their policies for construction of a
Memorial Hall.
Since 1919 It has been planned to
erect such a building on the Stanford
campus. The committee has intended
to provide a monumental structure
large enough to use as an assembly
hall and suitable to house the rare
war treasures acquired during the last
five years by the University. In cash
and pledges, there is available at pres
ent $100,000, not quite one-third of the
total sum necessary.
Sellards reports that in many uni
versities alumni who were mmebers
of the armed forces during the war
are planning to pool their bonus poli
cies for construction of memorials. At
Princeton two memorial buildings,
both dormitories, are to be dedicated
in the spring, and a third, to be con
structed with bonus funds, is pro
jected.
In his appeal to Stanford men, Sel
lards suggests that, "you, like many
others, while not desiring the bonus
for personal use, would gladly accept
your share if it could be devoted to a
memorial to the Stanford men." If half
the 2000 turn back to the University
their bonus policies, it will be possible
to build a fine structure, says Sellards.
