# INDIVIDUAL STARS LACKING AT FIRST HOOP SCRIMMAGES
## "Andy" Kerr Shifting Men to Determine Best Group For 1925 Varsity 
### 
With the personnel of the Card bas
ketball varsity still very much an un
known quantity. Coach "Andy" Kerr
is experimenting with his men at dif
ferent positions in an effort to dis
cover a successful playing combina
tion.
j Captain Dave Oliva and Gurdon
Steele are the only letter men who
have been working out the past week.
Ernie Nevers may not be able to play
this season, and Kerr has his hands
full trying to find a cpable man to
fill the shoes of the big forward.
Individual stars are lacking among
the thirty-odd candidates for the var
sity squad. Kerr has about a dozen
good, consistent players but none of
them are the flashy type, nor are any
of them dependable shots.
Steele Used at Guard
Oliva is the only man who is sure
of his regular position. Steele, regular
center last year, has been used at run
ning guard in some of the scrimmages.
Should Steele fit in at thi√ü position,
Jayred, 1927 freshman pivot man,
looks like the best bet for center.
Carter, who made his 1926 numerals,
and Anderson, a sophomore, are also
possibilities.
Harry Shipkey, Ted Shipkey, and
Howard Mitchell are still occupied
with football, but in their absence
competition goes merrily on for run
ning guard. Tom Grace and Dick Coen,
who were on the squad last year, have
been going well, but Fred Price,
"Clink" Frazier, and Ned Anderson
have displayed considerable ability as
floor guards.
Price and Frazier may be used as
forwards. Nelson David, 1927, regular,
is a hard-working player and this, cou
pled with his shooting ability, may
earn him a place as a regular forward.
Riese, Southworth, Rice, Alexander,
and Smith are a few others upon whom
Kerr has his eye.
