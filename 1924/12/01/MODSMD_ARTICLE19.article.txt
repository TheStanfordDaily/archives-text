# Welcome, Notre Dame
## 
### 
Notre Dame is signed up, and it will be a Tournament of Roses not
without thorns for somebody. The varsity men seem little perturbed
about it; they give the impression that the "Four Horsemen" fall down
when tackled just like anybody else, and that a Notre Dame pass is not a
pass unless it is completed. Which is a healthy attitude. The Irishmen
have a super-reputation here on the Coast, but they are not super-men
and it remains to be seen whether or not they will play super-football.
Just the same, Stanford has picket a Tartar, and the Los Angeles
folks will get a belated eye-full—sixty days late and sixty per cent better.
"Pop" Warner will send his team into that game as he has sent them into
every other—to show enough stuff to win, or to show all they have, as the
case may be. The Cards have a pretty neat passing attack, when all is
said, and with the cripples back in uniform the defense will be right de
fensive. And Notre Dame will have to show what has made her the great
football name that she is.
Stanford, with the backing accorded some universities, could lay claim
to some kind of "international championship" if Notre Dame were de
feated. With any or no kind of backing, the Cards will come into a strong
spotlight—if they beat Notre Dame. If Notre Dame wins, it will be ho
more than they're used to.
It will be an ideal day of football. Two teams sharing etjually the
Pacific Coast honors will defend them against two undefeated Eastern
elevens. Probably Pennsylvania and Notre Dame would not play to a tie
-—the superiority of one over the other will perhaps be decided by a com
parison of the New Year's Day scores. But it will be Stanford's job to
buck up against the most imposing record and reputation.
Fortunately over sixty per cent of Stanford is registered from Los
Angeles and the immediate vicinity. They will be perfectly located to
back the team —aided vocally by younger brothers, sisters, and potential
relations by marriage. It would be a shame to crowd the mere morbid
spectators out of the Bowl, but if the Bowl can be filled with Stanford
lungs it would be much better. So get on the trail of those tickets and
don't be disappointed.
