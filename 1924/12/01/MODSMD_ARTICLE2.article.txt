# ADDITIONAL DEBATES BILLED FOR NOVICE STANFORD ORATORS
## 
### 
At least three debates in addition
to those originally planned have been
scheduled, to be open only to men who
have not previously represented Stan
ford in debate, according to an an
nouncement from the office of Debate
Advisor J. G. Emerson, today.
Throughout the season the debate
committee has been hindered in the
arranging of debates by lack of funds.
Three colleges, however, who are
sending debate teams on trips this
year, have agreed to appear at Stan
ford without guarantee, and arrange
ments are being completed for the
contests.
No Stanford man who has previously
represented this institution in foren
sics will be eligible to appear in these
contests. Professor Emerson plans to
have at the first of the year a squad
of ten new men. These men will work
•on the question for the final debates
and hold practice contests among
themselves. Just before each debate,
Professor Emerson will pick his te^m.
Willamette Good
Of the three institutions now onl
schedule, Willamette University of
Salem, Ore., is probably the most
formidable. One of its debaters is
Ward Southworth who will represent
them at the Coast Speaking Coytest
here December 3. The other is Ralph
W. Emmons, who is a transfer to Wil
lamette from Northwestern University.
Year before last Emmons won first
place in the freshman tryouts over
sixty-one opponents.
The second school on the schedule is
Utah State College. Not long ago the
debate coach at U. S. C. made the
statement that, next to Stanford, Utah
produced the best teams that Southern
California had met. The third insti
tution is Kansas Agricultural College.
Most of these debates will take
place sometime in March. The question
for all will be the general proposition
as to whether or not the Supreme
Court should have the power to de
clare acts of Congress unconstitu
tional.
The reason for allowing only new
men to participate, according to Mr.
Emerson, is that in recent tryouts
there have been so many new men
who have been unable to compete with (
some of the more experienced vetrans,
that this series of varsity contests has
been arranged for them alone.

there have been so many new men
who have been unable to compete with (
some of the more experienced vetrans,
that this series of varsity contests has
been arranged for them alone.
At least three debates in addition
to those originally planned have been
scheduled, to be open only to men who
have not previously represented Stan
ford in debate, according to an an
nouncement from the office of Debate
Advisor J. G. Emerson, today.
Throughout the season the debate
committee has been hindered in the
arranging of debates by lack of funds.
Three colleges, however, who are
sending debate teams on trips this
year, have agreed to appear at Stan
ford without guarantee, and arrange
ments are being completed for the
contests.
No Stanford man who has previously
represented this institution in foren
sics will be eligible to appear in these
contests. Professor Emerson plans to
have at the first of the year a squad
of ten new men. These men will work
•on the question for the final debates
and hold practice contests among
themselves. Just before each debate,
Professor Emerson will pick his te^m.
Willamette Good
Of the three institutions now onl
schedule, Willamette University of
Salem, Ore., is probably the most
formidable. One of its debaters is
Ward Southworth who will represent
them at the Coast Speaking Coytest
here December 3. The other is Ralph
W. Emmons, who is a transfer to Wil
lamette from Northwestern University.
Year before last Emmons won first
place in the freshman tryouts over
sixty-one opponents.
The second school on the schedule is
Utah State College. Not long ago the
debate coach at U. S. C. made the
statement that, next to Stanford, Utah
produced the best teams that Southern
California had met. The third insti
tution is Kansas Agricultural College.
Most of these debates will take
place sometime in March. The question
for all will be the general proposition
as to whether or not the Supreme
Court should have the power to de
clare acts of Congress unconstitu
tional.
The reason for allowing only new
men to participate, according to Mr.
Emerson, is that in recent tryouts
there have been so many new men
who have been unable to compete with (
some of the more experienced vetrans,
that this series of varsity contests has
been arranged for them alone.
