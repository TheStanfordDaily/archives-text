# Phi Beta Kappa
## 
### 
Nineteen names were added to the Phi Beta Kappa roster last week,
and the usual "How did he do it?" was 110 harder to hear than ever.
Some of these names are practically heard for the first time, in con
nection with this list. Others have been before the campus so much and
so often that it is a crowning surprise to find them here.
It is not astonishing for a man or woman to make Phi Beta Kappa
and nothing else. But it is astonishing when a person takes a hand in the
active administration of student activities, and still has time to crawl away
and study his or her way into that lordly company.
The Daily congratulates those brainy and versatile ones, meanwhile
joining in the cry "How did he do it?"
ONLY FOURTEEN more studying days before exes.
