# BIG GAME PROFITS BRING MAJOR PART OF ATHLETIC FUND
## Athletic Board Must Spend $472,000 for Branner, Gift to Stanford 
### 
Each year the Big Game nets a large
part of the total sum taken in by the
Board of Athletic Control. The total
for all football games last year was
$143,000, while other sources brought
in $51,000, bringing the grand total
netted by the Board to $194,000.
Of this amount $:'»7,000 was expended
for carrying on all intercollegiate out
side competition. This included send
ing the team away for games, the ex
penses incurred by them, and business
expenses for managers and other ath
letic directors.
Nine thousand dollars was paid out
for new equipment for the team, $.'l,OOO
for the hand, and $20,000 for grounds
maintenance.
A payment on the stadium of $40,000
and one on the basketball pavilion of

| $7500 were some of the big debts paid,
! while the remainder went for intra-
I mural and interclass athletics, gymna
| sium maintenance, swimming pool
I maintenance, staff, accountants, and
! insurance.
At present the Board of Athletic
Control is $685,000 in debt. These are
made up of amounts due on the sta-
I dium, pavilion, gymnasium, and dormi
! torv.
| The Board presented Branner Hall
jto the University recently and the
\ total valuation of $472,000 is still due.
$06,000 is still due on the stadium,
$42,000 on the pavilion, and $75,000 on
[ the gymnasium.
The Board does not support any
activity except Band and Glee Club
but it maintains and operates a Phys
ical Education department.
"Last year there was a record of
! «
90.7 of physically fit men in the Univer
sity that were participating in some
sport," says Paul Davis, graduate man
ager. "I think this very exceptional
and fine as this shows money is spent
on the mass of students and not on
any favored few so as to develop the
entire student body physically as well
j as mentally.
