# CABBAGES and THINGS
## A 						SATISFACTORY FAMILY 
### Hal 
Once there were three growing boys
whose mother was a singer,
Father was a gentleman whue face
was long and sad.
Always in her home they had a maid —
and bells to bring her,
And a gentle nurse to reprimand them
were they bad.
Youngest of the three was William
Algernon Charles Walter.
William was exemplary, he almost
never fussed
When he had to eat his musli, nor did
he ever falter
In his sums, and if you please, his hair
was never mussed.
Second in the family was prankish
little Andy.
He was far too old for nurses, so they
sent him off—
Down to Doctor Smithson's school,
which everyone found handy,
But he grew no better and his elders
he would scoff.

Oldest of the trio was the (lashing
rascal Keating.
Football was his game, sir. and of
naught was he afraid —
That is what the younger boys de
lighted in repeatfcg.
"Ladies' man" he also was, according
to the maid.
Jolly little family, the mother and the
father,
William, Andy, Keating, and the maid,
and then the nurse—
Ah, the point! I can't recall. It's such
a needless bother.
Twenty lines are finished, so the mat
ter might be worse.
