The wonders of the world I've searched
in vain. •
Their day is done; they live in the
domain
Of History and their story's on the
tongue
Of every yokel—There's the port's
bane.
O Sorcerer invoke the Astral Light;
Employ your mystic chants to woo
the sprite.
Give me a glimpse of only one good
scheme—
But one hunch give your anxious neo
phyte.
It's something dift'rent, something new,
I seek.
Day after day I wonder 'till I'm weak,
"What shall I write, alas, what shall
I write
Original and fresh for Tuesday week?"
