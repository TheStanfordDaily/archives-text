# INDIANA BANS AUTOS; STUDENTS USE BUGGIES
## 
### 
The no-automobile ruling of the Uni
versity of Indiana will lose its sting if
the students take to the horse and
buggy as a means of transportation.
On a recent Sunday a group of stu
dents took an old buggy hitched to an
equally ancient horse, and paraded the
streets displaying the sign, "If we
can't have cars we'll ride in buggies."
The vehicle was named "Flaming
Youth" by bystanding pedestrians.
