# "DULCY" TO END DRAMATIC OFFERINGS FOR THIS YEAR
## Hilarious Comedy by "Movie" Scenarist Creates Laughs In Sophomore Play 
### John Snomis 
If rehearsals are any criteria of
what a play will be like, a new ail
ment will strike the campus along
about 8:15 next Saturday night, when
the class of 1927 will present "Dulcy"
in the Assembly hall.
The theatrical terminology for this
new disease is "laughing jag" and so
potent are the situations and the lines
of "Dulcy" that even the cast and the
director are not immune. Practically
half an hour is wasted at every re
hearsal, during which everyone who
is working on the play is almost con
vulsed with laughter.
The most entertaining scene, and the
one which provokes the most mirth,
comes in the second act, where a
scenario writer tells the story of his
latest masterpiece with the help of a
piano accompaniment. Marvin Park, as
Mr. Leach, the "Scenarist," and John
Wiggin as Mr. Van Dyke, the accom
panist, provide some of the most deli
cious humor of the play, and will prob
ably "stop" the show on Saturday
night.
Bride Bungles
"Dulcy" is the story of a modern
young bride who tries to help her
husband in business, and in so doing
almost manages to wreck three mar
riages and destroy her own happy
home. Peggy Randall is "Dulcy," and
her work shows promise of future
fame on the Stanford stage, a future
which will be an actuality after Satur
day night's performance.
Kathreen Clock, in the role of Mrs.
Forbes, the second wife of the wealthy
business man, is another dramatic
"find," and her interpretation of the
fun-loving misunderstood wife is well
nigh perfect. Ruth Jordon, as Angela,
the daughter of the magnate, has a
typical ingenue part for which she is
admirably fitted, her love scene with
the scenarist being particularly good.
As "Dulcy" will be the last play of
the year, a record crowd is expected.
The seat sale will be held in the Ad
ministration building at 1 o'clock
Wednesday.
