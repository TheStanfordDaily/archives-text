For the Cotillion
EVENING CLOTHES PORTRAY YOUR
INDIVIDUALITY. IF YOU WEAR
SOMEONE ELSE'S TUXEDO YOU ARE
NOT YOURSELF. WHEN A MAN
ESSAYS TO WEAR FORMAL ATTIRE
HOW IMPORTANT THAT EVERY
DETAIL BE CORRECT.
HIS COLLAR AND BOW MUST
BE EXACT; HIS SHIRT, METICULOUS;
HIS GLOVES AND HIS HOSE, HIS
STUDS AND HIS LINKSâ€”THEY
MUST ALL BLEND INTO THE PICTURE.
OUR EXPERIENCE MAY BE
HELPFUL IN MAKING SELECTIONS
OF FORMAL DRESS ACCOUTREMENTS.
