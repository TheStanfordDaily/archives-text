### Katherine Capell 
|?VA GAUTHIER, French-Canadian mezzo-soprano, and one of the most
remarkable exponents of song today, will appear in a recital in the j
Assembly hall on Thursday, December 11, as the first of the Peninsula Music 1
Association concerts.
Critics have given Miss Gauthier the title, "The High Priestess of Modern
Song," since to every phase of vocalism, she brings not only creative skill and 1

artistry, but a deftness and individualism which have won praise from the
most exacting music lovers, and a versatility which is surprising.
She has a fine soprano voice, so tuned and colorful as to express the
acutest emotional demands made upon it, from*the lyrics of Beethoven,
through the wide field of modern French, Italian, and Russian vocal music,
to the mysterious and alluring folk songs of the Orient, and the Malay Straits, !

■$>of which she has made a special |
| study, and of which she is the sole
| occidental exponent.
Interpretations Delightful
Philip Hale, music critic of the Bos
ton Herald, says of Miss Gauthier, ,
"Her interpretations of the various !
moods, sentiments, and emotions were
an unfailing delight. Vocal difficulties
were easily surmounted; tones were i
i artistically colored at will; the voice'
was the subtle and sympathetic voice
of each composer."
The rich interpretative sense of the !
; singer, the introspective sensitiveness
