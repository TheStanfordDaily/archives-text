# EVA GAUTHIER WILL SING IN ASSEMBLY HALL DECEMBER 11
## French Canadian Mezzo Soprano Is First Artist On Association Program For Coming Year 
### Katherine Capell 
|?VA GAUTHIER, French-Canadian mezzo-soprano, and one of the most
remarkable exponents of song today, will appear in a recital in the j
Assembly hall on Thursday, December 11, as the first of the Peninsula Music 1
Association concerts.
Critics have given Miss Gauthier the title, "The High Priestess of Modern
Song," since to every phase of vocalism, she brings not only creative skill and 1

artistry, but a deftness and individualism which have won praise from the
most exacting music lovers, and a versatility which is surprising.
She has a fine soprano voice, so tuned and colorful as to express the
acutest emotional demands made upon it, from*the lyrics of Beethoven,
through the wide field of modern French, Italian, and Russian vocal music,
to the mysterious and alluring folk songs of the Orient, and the Malay Straits, !

■$>of which she has made a special |
| study, and of which she is the sole
| occidental exponent.
Interpretations Delightful
Philip Hale, music critic of the Bos
ton Herald, says of Miss Gauthier, ,
"Her interpretations of the various !
moods, sentiments, and emotions were
an unfailing delight. Vocal difficulties
were easily surmounted; tones were i
i artistically colored at will; the voice'
was the subtle and sympathetic voice
of each composer."
The rich interpretative sense of the !
; singer, the introspective sensitiveness

Eva Gauthier, Mezzo Soprano
of her art, and its beautiful atmos
pheric quality are even more import
ant factors in her success than her
voice, which is wide in range and rich
in timbre.
In oratorio, in recitals of Chamber
Music, with full symphonic accompani
ment, and in recital, Miss Gauthier
has been equally well received. She
was the first to sing the title role of
Massenet's "La Vierge" in America,
and the first singer to be chosen to
interpret American songs at the fa
mous Salzburg Festival.
In addition, she became famous
overnight in New York as the first
singer to introduce American jazz to
the concert hall, by singing "Alexan
der's Ragtime Band" and other mod
ern "hits" on the same program with
"Bela Bartok" and Schoenberg's
"Gurrelieder." The audience, a group
of sophisticated New Yorkers, were
at first a trifle patronizing, but they
ended by surrendering completely to
the charms of their own folk music,
according to Deems Taylor, of the
World.

Critics have given Miss Gauthier the title, "The High Priestess of Modern
Song," since to every phase of vocalism, she brings not only creative skill and 1

artistry, but a deftness and individualism which have won praise from the
most exacting music lovers, and a versatility which is surprising.
She has a fine soprano voice, so tuned and colorful as to express the
acutest emotional demands made upon it, from*the lyrics of Beethoven,
through the wide field of modern French, Italian, and Russian vocal music,
to the mysterious and alluring folk songs of the Orient, and the Malay Straits, !

Interpretations Delightful
Philip Hale, music critic of the Bos
ton Herald, says of Miss Gauthier, ,
"Her interpretations of the various !
moods, sentiments, and emotions were
an unfailing delight. Vocal difficulties
were easily surmounted; tones were i

was the subtle and sympathetic voice
of each composer."

of her art, and its beautiful atmos
pheric quality are even more import
ant factors in her success than her
voice, which is wide in range and rich
in timbre.
In oratorio, in recitals of Chamber
Music, with full symphonic accompani
ment, and in recital, Miss Gauthier
has been equally well received. She
was the first to sing the title role of
Massenet's "La Vierge" in America,
and the first singer to be chosen to
interpret American songs at the fa
mous Salzburg Festival.
In addition, she became famous
overnight in New York as the first
singer to introduce American jazz to
the concert hall, by singing "Alexan
der's Ragtime Band" and other mod
ern "hits" on the same program with
"Bela Bartok" and Schoenberg's
"Gurrelieder." The audience, a group
of sophisticated New Yorkers, were
at first a trifle patronizing, but they
ended by surrendering completely to
the charms of their own folk music,
according to Deems Taylor, of the
World.

remarkable exponents of song today, will appear in a recital in the j
Assembly hall on Thursday, December 11, as the first of the Peninsula Music 1
