Campus golf enthusiasts will gather

tion it occupies at California and at a
! majority of the other leading Ameri
can universities. The members will
keep on the lookout for golfing stars
among the incoming freshmen, and
will co-operate with the varsity mana
ger and captain in their efforts to de
velop a first-class team.
Manager "Nick" Carter will be at
the meeting and is expected to de
scribe briefly the status of golf at
i Stanford and the prospects for the
coming season. Eli Dorsey, founder
and past president of the Encina Golf
Club, the first, known yearling organi
zation in any university, will outline
the plans discussed at the first meet
ing of the all-University club Novem
ber 20.
All men, except members of '28, who
are in any way interested in golf, are
I urged to be present.
