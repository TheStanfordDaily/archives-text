# ROOTERS TO FORM BIG SECTION FOR NEW YEAR'S GAME
## General Admission Tickets Will Be Sold Through Southern Office 
### 
Stanford will have a large rooting
section and well-organized bleacher
stunts at the Notre Dame game in
Pasadena on New Year's Day if the
present plans of the Rally committee
are carried out.
Eight hundred and fifty rooters
would form a section that would show
up to advantage in the stadium accord
ing to Les Peter, chairman of the com
mittee. It is his plan to have at least
this number in the section.
For this reason he urges every one
that plans to attend the game to sit
in the seats provided instead of scat
tering around the Bowl. Paul Davis is
planning to give the rooters the best
seats which are usually sold for $5.
Rooters' Tickets $1.50
These seats will sell tor $1.50 and
will be sold on the campus about
December 10 or 11. Students may
apply for six general admission tickets
through the Los Angeles office and
application blanks for these will be
distributed the first of next week.
Rooters' tickets are not transferable
%
and in order to gain admission on the
ticket, the holder must show his
rooter's hat.
All stunts planned by Cal Conron,
chairman of the stunt committee, will
be worked out with rooters' hats in
stead of with colored cards. The rea
son for this being the great cost of
cards. For the Big Game alone fhey
cost around $250, and $400 in 1923.
* Irish Undefeated
The New Year's Day game in the
Tournament of Roses Bowl should in
itself be worth traveling far to see.
Rockne's team is acknowledged to be
the best in the East and the brand of
football his charges will display should
be something new to Coast fans. Notre
Dame is comparatively light and it
has relied on its open game to win
from all the big teams encountered
this year. Although the Irish have
shown all around ability it is on this
aerial game coupled with a fast run
ning attack that their attack depends.
Stanford has also shown itself to
Wednesday night, and will probably
be Weigel's nearest competitor for
first place. While no decision was
given at the Berkeley contest it has
been rumored from several sources
that Weigel had considerably the best
of the argument.
Weigel's style has been probably
best expressed by the description of
his appearance at California this fall
given by Alan Nichols, the coach of
debate at U. S. C. "He kept the audi
ence in an uproar the whole time.
They were with him every minute."
Weigel has the faculty of combining
human interest and humor, without
diminishing his force.
Of the other six, one of the most
serious candidates will be William
Barber, of U. S. C. Barber is an ex
tremely polished speaker, almost too
much so. He closely follows the South
ern California style of debating which
includes telling several jokes at the
beginning and then presenting some
very convincing facts. At his worst
Barber will provide most interesting
competition.
Willamette Sends Orator
Ward R. Southworth, of Willamette
University, Salem, Oregon, was the
first contestant to arrive on the scene.
Southworth comes from a small uni
versity in Oregon which makes debate
a major sport, and which has produced
some nationally-known debate teams.
Two years ago as a freshman South
worth was a member of a debating
team which made a four weeks' tour
of the Middle West, speaking on Amer
ica's foreign policy. Southworth is es
sentially an orator, but stack all the
odds against him and the best speaker
there will know that Willamette has
a strong contestant in the running.
From Washington State College is
Fred Weller, now student body presi
dent of his school and formerly editor
of its daily paper. Weller placed third
last year and threatens to rate higher
on his second try.
Oregon Man Little Known
Robert Kerr, the son of the president
of Oregon Agricultural College, is to
speak for that institution. Kerr is a
veteran speaker, having received his
start as a junior in high school when
he appeared against Southworth, the
Willamette representative. Kerr was
on the O. A. C. team last year, which
sent U. S. C. down to defeat. He has
been trained this fall by the rather
numerous public speaking coaches at
O. A. C. and will make a strong bid
for a high rating.
The Oregon man is Sol Abrahamson,
about whom little or nothing is known
on the Stanford campus, and the Whit
man man has not yet been announced.

The National University of Mexico
is the oldest in North America. This
summer courses will be given, some
being in English.

on the O. A. C. team last year, which
sent U. S. C. down to defeat. He has
been trained this fall by the rather
numerous public speaking coaches at
O. A. C. and will make a strong bid
for a high rating.
The Oregon man is Sol Abrahamson,
about whom little or nothing is known
on the Stanford campus, and the Whit
man man has not yet been announced.

The National University of Mexico
is the oldest in North America. This

being in English.
Stanford will have a large rooting
section and well-organized bleacher
stunts at the Notre Dame game in
Pasadena on New Year's Day if the
present plans of the Rally committee
are carried out.
Eight hundred and fifty rooters
would form a section that would show
up to advantage in the stadium accord
ing to Les Peter, chairman of the com
mittee. It is his plan to have at least
this number in the section.
For this reason he urges every one
that plans to attend the game to sit
in the seats provided instead of scat
tering around the Bowl. Paul Davis is
planning to give the rooters the best
seats which are usually sold for $5.
Rooters' Tickets $1.50
These seats will sell tor $1.50 and
will be sold on the campus about
December 10 or 11. Students may
apply for six general admission tickets
through the Los Angeles office and
application blanks for these will be
distributed the first of next week.
Rooters' tickets are not transferable
%
and in order to gain admission on the
ticket, the holder must show his
rooter's hat.
All stunts planned by Cal Conron,
chairman of the stunt committee, will
be worked out with rooters' hats in
stead of with colored cards. The rea
son for this being the great cost of
cards. For the Big Game alone fhey
cost around $250, and $400 in 1923.
* Irish Undefeated
The New Year's Day game in the
Tournament of Roses Bowl should in
itself be worth traveling far to see.
Rockne's team is acknowledged to be
the best in the East and the brand of
football his charges will display should
be something new to Coast fans. Notre
Dame is comparatively light and it
has relied on its open game to win
from all the big teams encountered
this year. Although the Irish have
shown all around ability it is on this
aerial game coupled with a fast run
ning attack that their attack depends.
Stanford has also shown itself to
Wednesday night, and will probably
be Weigel's nearest competitor for
first place. While no decision was
given at the Berkeley contest it has
been rumored from several sources
that Weigel had considerably the best
of the argument.
Weigel's style has been probably
best expressed by the description of
his appearance at California this fall
given by Alan Nichols, the coach of
debate at U. S. C. "He kept the audi
ence in an uproar the whole time.
They were with him every minute."
Weigel has the faculty of combining
human interest and humor, without
diminishing his force.
Of the other six, one of the most
serious candidates will be William
Barber, of U. S. C. Barber is an ex
tremely polished speaker, almost too
much so. He closely follows the South
ern California style of debating which
includes telling several jokes at the
beginning and then presenting some
very convincing facts. At his worst
Barber will provide most interesting
competition.
Willamette Sends Orator
Ward R. Southworth, of Willamette
University, Salem, Oregon, was the
first contestant to arrive on the scene.
Southworth comes from a small uni
versity in Oregon which makes debate
a major sport, and which has produced
some nationally-known debate teams.
Two years ago as a freshman South
worth was a member of a debating
team which made a four weeks' tour
of the Middle West, speaking on Amer
ica's foreign policy. Southworth is es
sentially an orator, but stack all the
odds against him and the best speaker
there will know that Willamette has
a strong contestant in the running.
From Washington State College is
Fred Weller, now student body presi
dent of his school and formerly editor
of its daily paper. Weller placed third
last year and threatens to rate higher
on his second try.
Oregon Man Little Known
Robert Kerr, the son of the president
of Oregon Agricultural College, is to
speak for that institution. Kerr is a
veteran speaker, having received his
start as a junior in high school when
he appeared against Southworth, the
Willamette representative. Kerr was
on the O. A. C. team last year, which
sent U. S. C. down to defeat. He has

a strong contestant in the running.
From Washington State College is
Fred Weller, now student body presi
dent of his school and formerly editor
of its daily paper. Weller placed third
last year and threatens to rate higher
on his second try.
Oregon Man Little Known
Robert Kerr, the son of the president
of Oregon Agricultural College, is to
speak for that institution. Kerr is a
veteran speaker, having received his
start as a junior in high school when
he appeared against Southworth, the
Willamette representative. Kerr was
on the O. A. C. team last year, which
sent U. S. C. down to defeat. He has
been trained this fall by the rather
numerous public speaking coaches at
O. A. C. and will make a strong bid
for a high rating.
The Oregon man is Sol Abrahamson,
about whom little or nothing is known
on the Stanford campus, and the Whit
man man has not yet been announced.

The National University of Mexico
is the oldest in North America. This
summer courses will be given, some
being in English.
Stanford will have a large rooting
section and well-organized bleacher
stunts at the Notre Dame game in
Pasadena on New Year's Day if the
present plans of the Rally committee
are carried out.
Eight hundred and fifty rooters
would form a section that would show
up to advantage in the stadium accord
ing to Les Peter, chairman of the com
mittee. It is his plan to have at least
this number in the section.
For this reason he urges every one
that plans to attend the game to sit
in the seats provided instead of scat
tering around the Bowl. Paul Davis is
planning to give the rooters the best
seats which are usually sold for $5.
Rooters' Tickets $1.50
These seats will sell tor $1.50 and
will be sold on the campus about
December 10 or 11. Students may
apply for six general admission tickets
through the Los Angeles office and
application blanks for these will be
distributed the first of next week.
Rooters' tickets are not transferable
%
and in order to gain admission on the
ticket, the holder must show his
rooter's hat.
All stunts planned by Cal Conron,
chairman of the stunt committee, will
be worked out with rooters' hats in
stead of with colored cards. The rea
son for this being the great cost of
cards. For the Big Game alone fhey
cost around $250, and $400 in 1923.
* Irish Undefeated
The New Year's Day game in the
Tournament of Roses Bowl should in
itself be worth traveling far to see.
Rockne's team is acknowledged to be
the best in the East and the brand of
football his charges will display should
be something new to Coast fans. Notre
Dame is comparatively light and it
has relied on its open game to win
from all the big teams encountered
this year. Although the Irish have
shown all around ability it is on this
aerial game coupled with a fast run
ning attack that their attack depends.
Stanford has also shown itself to
Wednesday night, and will probably
be Weigel's nearest competitor for
first place. While no decision was
given at the Berkeley contest it has
been rumored from several sources
that Weigel had considerably the best
of the argument.
Weigel's style has been probably
best expressed by the description of
his appearance at California this fall
given by Alan Nichols, the coach of
debate at U. S. C. "He kept the audi
ence in an uproar the whole time.
They were with him every minute."
Weigel has the faculty of combining
human interest and humor, without
diminishing his force.
Of the other six, one of the most
serious candidates will be William
Barber, of U. S. C. Barber is an ex
tremely polished speaker, almost too
much so. He closely follows the South
ern California style of debating which
includes telling several jokes at the
beginning and then presenting some
very convincing facts. At his worst
Barber will provide most interesting
competition.
Willamette Sends Orator
Ward R. Southworth, of Willamette
University, Salem, Oregon, was the
first contestant to arrive on the scene.
Southworth comes from a small uni
versity in Oregon which makes debate
a major sport, and which has produced
some nationally-known debate teams.
Two years ago as a freshman South
worth was a member of a debating
team which made a four weeks' tour
of the Middle West, speaking on Amer
ica's foreign policy. Southworth is es
sentially an orator, but stack all the
odds against him and the best speaker
there will know that Willamette has
a strong contestant in the running.
