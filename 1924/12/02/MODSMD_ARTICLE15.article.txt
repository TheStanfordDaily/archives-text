# ROOTERS TO FORM BIG SECTION FOR NEW YEAR'S GAME
## General Admission Tickets Will Be Sold Through Southern Office 
### 
Stanford will have a large rooting
section and well-organized bleacher
stunts at the Notre Dame game in
Pasadena on New Year's Day if the
present plans of the Rally committee
are carried out.
Eight hundred and fifty rooters
would form a section that would show

this number in the section.
For this reason he urges every one
that plans to attend the game to sit
in the seats provided instead of scat

planning to give the rooters the best

Rooters' Tickets $1.50
These seats will sell tor $1.50 and
will be sold on the campus about
December 10 or 11. Students may
apply for six general admission tickets
through the Los Angeles office and
application blanks for these will be
distributed the first of next week.
Rooters' tickets are not transferable

and in order to gain admission on the
ticket, the holder must show his
rooter's hat.
All stunts planned by Cal Conron,
chairman of the stunt committee, will
be worked out with rooters' hats in
stead of with colored cards. The rea
son for this being the great cost of
cards. For the Big Game alone fhey
cost around $250, and $400 in 1923.

Tournament of Roses Bowl should in

Rockne's team is acknowledged to be
the best in the East and the brand of
football his charges will display should
be something new to Coast fans. Notre
Dame is comparatively light and it
has relied on its open game to win
from all the big teams encountered
this year. Although the Irish have
shown all around ability it is on this
aerial game coupled with a fast run
ning attack that their attack depends.
Stanford has also shown itself to
