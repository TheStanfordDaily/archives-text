# INJURIES CRIPPLE CARD RUNNERS IN TOMORROW'S RACE
## 
### 
Injuries to two of the best runners
on the squad have put a severe crimp
in the chances of a Card victory when
the Stanford and California cross
country teams meet at Berkeley to
morrow afternoon.
A1 Charles, captain, who had been
counted upon to repeat his victory of
last year, is out of the going because
of a bad heart, and Bob Cummings of
the 1927 track team cannot start as a
result of an injury his ankle suffered
last week. Both men had been counted
on to come in among the leaders and
their loss, especially that of Charles,
is keenly felt.
Those entered for Stanford are Bill
Kerr, Clark Cypher, Fred Richman,
Frank Hays, Luthar Ball, Wencjall
Carlsmith, B. C. Craft, and T. L. Mc-
Clellan.
Cypher, Clifford. Hays, and Bell all
placed in last year's race, Richman
won his letter on the 1927 cinder
squad, and Carlsmith. McClellan, and
Craft are strong runners. Kerr is the
best of the bunch, and if he can dodge
the hard luck which forced him out
of the race a year ago he should come
in ahead of the field.
Since their overwhelming defeat of
a year ago California has done much
to strengthen their squad. The addi- f
tion of a bunch of high-class distance
men from their '27 team to the vete
rans remaining from former seasons
has enabled Walter Christie to put a
squad on the track which should force
the Cards to the limit.
