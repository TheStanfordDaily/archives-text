# More Rooting

This is the time for all the staunch supporters of the Stanford rooting
section to do a bit of electioneering, and to come through a thousand per
cent. The Rally Committee, for obvious reasons, has requested a large
rooting section at the Notre Dame game in Pasadena, and the need for
whole-hearted support is vital.
Stanford will be in a difficult position at Pasadena. A large and clamor
ous group in the Angelic city considers that we ain't done right by their
little Nell, and Stanford students who went south for the Thanksgiving
recess can testify as to the largeness and clamorousness of that group. Los
Angeles is pretty well upset, what with "boycotts" and outraged provincial
patriotism.
It is entirely possible that the team may be playing in a hostile atmos
phere, whether audible or not. And a large and thoroughly audible rooting
section will be the best thing in the world to make the team feel at home—
as it properly is anywhere in California and especially so near Los Angeles,
Against Notre Dame the Cards will need the best of support, and a rooting
section is the only way to give it to them.
Some little sacrifice will be involved here, for quite a number of us. It
will seem necessary to most, and may actually be necessary for some, to
attend that game under conditions which prohibit the rooting section. But
think it over thoroughly before you do. Sit in that section, and yell your
head off, and leave the heavy duty until after the game. There is an un
written but well-observed sentiment here on the campus against queening
to games—let that sentiment be extended to Pasadena On New Year's. Ef
fective vocal support cannot come from scattered and unconcentrated
throats.
The team has a tough job on its hands, and we have our chance to help
out. The rooting section is the best geographically, patriotically, and finan
cially. «
