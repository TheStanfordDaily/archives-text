# SENIORS VANQUISH JUNIOR FIVE 14-11 IN INITIAL CONTEST
## 
### 
Accurate goal-shooting enabled the
seniors to down the juniors 14 to 111
in the first game of the interclass bas
ketball series yesterday. The senior
second team beat the junior "goofs"
14 to 10.
Both fives showed little teamwork
on account of the short practice period
preceding the series. The third-year
men seemed to work more smoothly
than their opponents, but lost out on
their inability to find the basket dur
ing the first period, when the '25 team
piled up a 9 to 4 lead. In the second
half the juniors got going, outplayed
their rivals, and tied the cout at 11 up,
but the seniors rallied and finished
strong.
Paul O'Hara's fourth-year outfit was
fast and shifty, and made the most of
its chances at the basket. Logan
played a bang-up game at center for
'25, scoring six of his team's fourteen
points and taking high point honors
for the contest. He broke the tie in
the last minutes of play by shooting a
basket from a difficult angle. "Mugs"
Mitchell, at running guard, led the
junior attack with a goal and two free
shots. He also curbed the senior of
fense in good style.
