# Debaters
## 
### 
Stanford is host this week to the Pacific Coast Public Speaking League,
which includes seven of the leading far-western universities. The Daily
extends to these men cordial greetings in behalf of the Associated Students,
and wishes them the best of success.
Public speaking, including debating, is one of the most valuable prepara
tions for later life which can be found among student activities. Especially
is this so in the matter of embroyo lawyers, and indeed anyone who aspires
to a position of public responsibility and influence. In spite of this, it re
ceives comparatively little support â€”perhaps less at Stanford than the
average university.
Granted, that unless the question is one of interest to the individual, it
is not wildly exciting to listen to even well-grounded and detailed argument
and rebuttal. The value of debating is not so much for the audience as for
the debaters, which is one reason for the high standard of Stanford orators
throughout great tribulation.
These members of the Public Speaking League have made a wise choice
of activity, and will reap in results what they may lose in glory.
