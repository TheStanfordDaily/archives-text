# MEN'S GYMNASIUM CLASSES ATTRACT 1183 ENROLLMENT
## 
### 
Enrollment figures for classes at the
Men's Gymnasium show that, 960 men I
have enrolled for requirement and
for credit, making a total of 1183.
Forty men have been excused from the
Lower Division requirement on ac
count of physical disability.
Swimming has, as usual, attracted !
the largest number of men and foot- j
ball, tennis, and track come in for,
second, third, and fourth places. There
is a total of about 200' men enrolled
in football and, counting the men who
do not care to enroll but who are out
for the teams, the number is a large
one. It certainly refutes the claim
made in some quarters that football
is only a game for the chosen few.
The Military department has at
tracted more men this year than ever I
before, two hundred having signed up
for courses. With its required work in
horsemanship and with the opportun
ity to play polo the Military depart
ment rfcally represents an active

branch of athletics. Combining the en
rollment in the Department of Physi
cal Education with that of the Military
j department, it is evident that there is
no falling off in the large turn-out for
athletic activities which is fast be
coming one of the traditions at Stan
ford and is being noted and made
mention of throughout the country.
