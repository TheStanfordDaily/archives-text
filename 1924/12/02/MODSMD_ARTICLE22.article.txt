A link in the chain is broken; a
light is out that just now sparkled
brilliantly. "Now we see through a
glass darkly, but then face to face.
Now I know in part, but then I shall
know even as I am known."
Last week we denounced "getting
by" with the intensity of a Dawes
ejaculation. May we now say, "that
despite the prophecies of their elders,
the student who just gets by, though
unconsciously, gets just what is best
for him, because in the work he later
takes up, the ability to make himself
congenial to others is -primarily essen
tial.
"A college training is not a total
failure for such men, although their
training is not an 'intellectual' suc
cess. Human relationship is not a
factor to be neglected even in the
hectic pursuit of "intellectuality."
For instance, there are quite a num
ber of people on the campus who could
make a fair fortune by hiring them
selves to some good soap concern, or
hair tonic manufacturer, or the Coty
Perfume Company, and pinning "We
always use it" on their waists.
But, as Kipling put it, "Theoreti
retti-retti-cally, of course, rigidity is
the thing. Purr-purr-practically, there
has to be a little give and take."
Isn't it strange how some people
can look at a drop of water under a
microscope and see myriads of the
most wonderful things; and others will
take the same drop of water and the
same microscope and see only blank
ness, or, worse still, things blurred
and deformed?
The man who invented the linotype
machine, which took the place of type
setting by hand, is dead. His invention
made large newspapers possible. If he
had led an army and slaughtered a
million people his career would be
known in every detail.
But, poor man, he didn't have the
sense to do it.
Did you ever notice that a figure

with a good deal of frontage is seldom
a public institution? (Yes, occasion
ally a metaphor is mixed intention
ally).
As if character were an end in
itself we have the devoted upholders
of the "babbling strenuous life," or
gregariousness, of playing at citizen
ship. Leisure! Leisure, is a synonym
for lazinessâ€”the one awful crime.
Which wouldn't be so bad if those
who don't believe in work as an end
in itself weren't so vigorously de
nounced.
Dear, dear!
Out of 457 colleges and universities
in the United States 123 have a suc
cessful honor system. The system has
recently been brought up for discus
sion at Northwestern.
