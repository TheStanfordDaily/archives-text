# Entries for Intramural Basketball Teams to Close on December 11
## 
### 
All living groups planning on enter
ing in intramural basketball must
notify C. W. Davis, director of intra
mural athletics, by December 15 in
order that the schedule may be drawn
up so that play may start at the be
ginning of next quarter.
Men who are not affiliated with any
living group may form teams and
enter the competition, but they must
let Davis know this quarter so they
can be included in the schedule.
Last year forty-two groups were
represented by basketball teams, and
Davis expects the number to reach
fifty this year.
