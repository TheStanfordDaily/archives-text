# J. GWINN DESCRIBES SCHOOL EXPANSION OF SAN FRANCISCO
## 
### 
"Good equipment is as necessary as
the teacher and the pupil in modern
| education," said Joseph Gwinn, super
intendent of the San Francisco schools
! in a talk before the Education Club
last night.
San Francisco has just entered on
an extensive school building program,
resultant from the fire and the expan
sion of the city since then.
"The Board figured that they could
fill a school with a capacity for 900
within a radius of one-half mile,"
Gwinn said. "Then they planned all
elementary schools to accommodate
approximately nine hundred pupils.
There are in every elementary school
building twenty-four classrooms, two
kindergarten rooms; an auditorium
big enough to accommodate the upper
grades; a covered play space; a nu
trition room, where milk and crackers
are kept; a general activities room,
where anything can happen from a
Boy Scouts meeting to a Parent-
Teachers Association meeting; also
offices for the principal, the district
nurse, and the librarian."
Gwinn went on to tell of the diffi
culties of building such schools in San
Francisco. Often the sites are badly
located, and the children have to be
protected as much as possible from
north and east winds, while class
rooms need to be protected from the
outside noises.
Competition for places on the staff
of the Cornell Daily Sun lasts two
months.
