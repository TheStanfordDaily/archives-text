"Forbidden Paradise" — Varsity,
Tuesday and Wednesday.
I The Ernst Lubitsch-Pola Negri team
is again in action. We almost said
Adolphe Menjou was supported by . .
i but the conventions must be observed.
Altogether, the picture was very
pleasing, far ahead of Miss Negri's
I other attempts. She goes through the
; usual "Negrie-esque" poses and eontor
j tions with a few new stunts added by
j the director. But for Mr. Menjou we
! have a great weakness. He has made
! so many poor productions at least en
; joyable with his air of laughing at
| life in general and the picture and
spectators in particular.
The story is an interesting adapta
j tion of one of the twenty-seven plots.
There is the willful lady, who happens
j also to be a queen, the earnest but at
times erring young man, and the ever
understanding and beneficent lord
chamberlain in the background.
