# Peninsular Coaches Will Discuss Basketball Rules
## 
### 
As an aid in interpreting this sea
son's basketball rules, a meeting of
all peninsular basketball coaches and
officials has been planned for Decem
ber 11, in the Encina gymnasium. Any
students interested are invited to at
tend the meeting.
Meetings similar to this have been
held for the past two years, forty-two
men attending the one held last year.
The varsity squad will probably play
two periods in order to make it easier
to explain the various rules and fouls.
