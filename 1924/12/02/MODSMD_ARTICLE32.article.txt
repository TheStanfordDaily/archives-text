# "PEACE" SUBJECT OF EUPHRONIA DEBATES
## 
### 
Euphronia literary society meets the
College of the Pacific Literary Forum
in debate tonight in the Little Theatre
immediately after the regular Tuesday
night lecture. Professor Lee Emerson
Bassett will be the chairman.
The subject of the debate involves
a discussion of a popular referendum
on war, except in case of actual inva
sion. Euphronia upholds the affirma
tive, and advocates the referendum.
The speakers for Euphronia are W.
Leslie Gosslin and 'John Dunniway.
They will be opposed by two veteran
speakers from the College of the
Pacific: Frank Delamarter and Roy
Wilson.
At the same time another Euphronia
team defends the negative of the same
question at Santa Clara College,
against the Santa Clara Congress. The
Euphronia speakers there are George
Crocker and Percy Spencer.
A new feature in Stanford debates
is to be inaugurated in the debate here
in that each speaker can be inter
rupted twice for question and answer,
time out being allowed for the process.
