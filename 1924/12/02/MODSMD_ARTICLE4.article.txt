# ROUGHS' DAY CUSTOM ABOLISHED BY COUNCIL
## 
### 
Roughs' Day, one of the last re- j
maining traditions of Stanford, was
abolished by action of the Men's
Council at a meeting held late last
| week.
The council, according to Chairman
Allan Charles, based its action upon,
three points: first, it was felt that this
tradition had never been of value to 1
the University in the past and that
the possibility of its being so in the
future was comparatively small; sec
ond, the tradition was not really an
old one (it was started after the abol-j
ishment of the Washington's Day pa
rade); third, the participants in the
last celebration carried their fun too
far.
The Men's Council also fel,t that pub
lic interest in Roughs' Day was rap-1
idly wanipg, and that there were few
students who had any desire to per
; petuate the tradition.
