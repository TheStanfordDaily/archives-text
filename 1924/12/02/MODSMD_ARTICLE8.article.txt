has ever produced. He starred first, in
his college career, in the freshman de
bate against California two years ago.
Last year he appeared against the
California varsity iri the Triangular.
By the time of the Joffre debate in

average caliber, and by the time of
the Triangular this fall he had added
another hundred per - cent.
Weigel Is Veteran
On November 3 he represented Stan
ford, speaking for John W. Davis in
the political debate at Berkeley. His
opponent there from the University
of Southern California is the man who
will oppose him from that institution
be an adept at passing, so the com
ing contest should be wide open with
a wealth of hair-raising thrills for the
spectator. Those wliq expect the mid
westerners to run rough shod over the
Cards have another guess coming for
Warner had a flock of scouts watch
ing the Eastern champs when they
beat Carnegie Tech in Pittsburgh last
Saturday, and when New Year's rolls
around "Pop" can be counted on to
