# BOARD OF CONTROL TO PASS RULING ON CHRISTMAS RUSHING
## 
### 
Under the present rulings passed by |
the Interfraternity Board of Control
last year, the fraternities may take
freshmen to Los Angeles for the j
Christmas vacation and may rush in
Los Angeles at that time. The con
tinuance of this ruling is subject to
the vote of the Board of Control to- j
morrow night.
At the meeting of the Interfraternity
Council last night an informal vote on
the question found the opinions well
divided.
The Council also discussed the possi
bilities of all houses initiating on the
sfime days. This idea is being fostered
by the Alumni council in San Fran
cisco.
