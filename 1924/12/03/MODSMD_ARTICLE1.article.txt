# ROCKNE'S ELEVEN WILL MAKE FIRST WESTERN INVASION
## Notre Dame Conceded Edge Over Cards on Early Season Showing 
### Hugh Hollembeak 
Football fans on the Pacific Coast
will have the treat of a lifetime New
Year's Day when Notre Dame, premier
grid machine of the East, goes against
Pop Warner's Stanford varsity in the
Rose Bowl at Pasadena —the chance
of a lifetime because it will be the
first occasion on record that the fa
mous Irish from South Bend have
ever invaded the West to try to grab
a new championship for their already
large collection.
Except for the play of St. Mary's
varsity the great system developed by
Knute Rockne, which has kept Notre
Dame in the center of the football map
for the past five years, is an unknown
quantity to most local followers of the
tan bark sport. They have heard the
Smith and Warner systems praised to
the skies and now that a chance to
see the product of another famous
school of football presents itself they
can judge for themselves just how the
best.on the Coast stacks up with the
pick of the East.
Notre Dame Has Edge
On the basis of their record during
the past season Notre Dame is con
ceded a small edge over Stanford. The
Irish are fast as greased lightning,
while all year Warner has had to put
up with a comparatively slow back
field. This gives the invaders an ad
vantage to start with, but offsetting
this is the fact that' several of Notre
Dame's opponents, notably Carnegie!
Tech, have been able to pierce the
Irish defense. If these facts mean:
anything it would not be surprising to 1
see a repetition of the Big Game with j
both teams Bcoring several times.
Stanford will outweigh the Eastern
ers. That is a foregone conclusion, for
Rockne's teams are always light. He j
sacrifices beef for speed and as a re
sult every man on his squad is a
sprinter. This light forward wall has j
succeeded in holding the attacks of
such teams as Princeton and Georgia
Tech but it should find its hands full
when it hits the Card line.
Card Line Is Heavier
All things considered, Stanford j
comes off better when the lines are j
compared than when the backfields j
are put up against each other. The j
Irish quartet is a wonder, without dis- j
pute the best in the United States j
today when it comes to working to-,
gether as a unit. Stuhlrehder, Miller,,
Crowley, and Layden have played to-1
gether for four years and they have
their work down to the point where i
the plays go off with every man in,
step.
This backfield has every quality a
coach might ask. Stuhlrehder is a field
general par excellence. The two halves
are wonders at running the ends, and
Layden has proved to be a sensational
line-cracker. All of them can pass and
Miller and Crowley are great in the
open field after receiving the ball. It
is the aerial attack of this outfit that
made its reputation, but its members
are capable of varying their offense.
Both of Notre Dame's scores against
Princeton came when Layden fooled
the opposition by smashing the line
after open work had advanced the ball
within scoring distance.

Opposed to this group of stars Stan
ford will probably use the same set
of backs that started the Big Game, j
Norman Cleaveland will not play, con-;
trary reports notwithstanding. Nevers;
may get into shape but a man who has
had both ankles broken during one,
season is a shaky proposition at best, j
Notre Dame has played no games
west of Nebraska this year but never
theless Warner will have his team
well coached to meet the Catholic at- !
tack. "Pop" has seen Rockne's men;
play many times in the past and he;
knows their style. Then, too, the East-!
erners met Carnegie in Pittsburgh
last Saturday and a lot of Warner's
boys back in the old home town were!
out there getting the latest dope. With
this information at hand it is not likely;
that the boys from the Farm will lose;
their heads when the invaders cut!
loose with their favorite plays.
Practice Starts Monday
At present the varsity is resting up
and getting ready for finals, but it
will be back at work again Monday
afternoon. Three weeks of intensive j
practice should bring the men back
to the height of their form. Except j
for Nevers the cripples will be back
in good physical shape and, barring
further mishaps the squad should be j
in better shape January 1 than it has [
been at any time since the Oregon
game.

best.on the Coast stacks up with the
pick of the East.
Notre Dame Has Edge
On the basis of their record during
the past season Notre Dame is con
ceded a small edge over Stanford. The
Irish are fast as greased lightning,
while all year Warner has had to put
up with a comparatively slow back
field. This gives the invaders an ad
vantage to start with, but offsetting
this is the fact that' several of Notre
Dame's opponents, notably Carnegie!
Tech, have been able to pierce the
Irish defense. If these facts mean:
anything it would not be surprising to 1
see a repetition of the Big Game with j
both teams Bcoring several times.
Stanford will outweigh the Eastern
ers. That is a foregone conclusion, for
Rockne's teams are always light. He j
sacrifices beef for speed and as a re
sult every man on his squad is a
sprinter. This light forward wall has j
succeeded in holding the attacks of
such teams as Princeton and Georgia
Tech but it should find its hands full
when it hits the Card line.
Card Line Is Heavier
All things considered, Stanford j
comes off better when the lines are j
compared than when the backfields j
are put up against each other. The j
Irish quartet is a wonder, without dis- j
pute the best in the United States j
today when it comes to working to-,
gether as a unit. Stuhlrehder, Miller,,
Crowley, and Layden have played to-1
gether for four years and they have
their work down to the point where i
the plays go off with every man in,
step.
This backfield has every quality a
coach might ask. Stuhlrehder is a field
general par excellence. The two halves
are wonders at running the ends, and
Layden has proved to be a sensational
line-cracker. All of them can pass and
Miller and Crowley are great in the
open field after receiving the ball. It
is the aerial attack of this outfit that
made its reputation, but its members
are capable of varying their offense.
Both of Notre Dame's scores against
Princeton came when Layden fooled
the opposition by smashing the line
after open work had advanced the ball
within scoring distance.

Opposed to this group of stars Stan
ford will probably use the same set
of backs that started the Big Game, j
Norman Cleaveland will not play, con-;
trary reports notwithstanding. Nevers;
may get into shape but a man who has
had both ankles broken during one,
season is a shaky proposition at best, j
Notre Dame has played no games
west of Nebraska this year but never
theless Warner will have his team
well coached to meet the Catholic at- !
tack. "Pop" has seen Rockne's men;
play many times in the past and he;
knows their style. Then, too, the East-!
erners met Carnegie in Pittsburgh
last Saturday and a lot of Warner's
boys back in the old home town were!
out there getting the latest dope. With
this information at hand it is not likely;
that the boys from the Farm will lose;
their heads when the invaders cut!
loose with their favorite plays.
Practice Starts Monday
At present the varsity is resting up
and getting ready for finals, but it
will be back at work again Monday
afternoon. Three weeks of intensive j
practice should bring the men back
to the height of their form. Except j
for Nevers the cripples will be back
in good physical shape and, barring
further mishaps the squad should be j
in better shape January 1 than it has [
been at any time since the Oregon
game.
Football fans on the Pacific Coast
will have the treat of a lifetime New
Year's Day when Notre Dame, premier
grid machine of the East, goes against
Pop Warner's Stanford varsity in the
Rose Bowl at Pasadena —the chance
of a lifetime because it will be the
first occasion on record that the fa
mous Irish from South Bend have
ever invaded the West to try to grab
a new championship for their already
large collection.
Except for the play of St. Mary's
varsity the great system developed by
Knute Rockne, which has kept Notre
Dame in the center of the football map
for the past five years, is an unknown
quantity to most local followers of the
tan bark sport. They have heard the
Smith and Warner systems praised to
the skies and now that a chance to
see the product of another famous

Tech but it should find its hands full
when it hits the Card line.
Card Line Is Heavier
All things considered, Stanford j
comes off better when the lines are j
compared than when the backfields j
are put up against each other. The j
Irish quartet is a wonder, without dis- j
pute the best in the United States j
today when it comes to working to-,
gether as a unit. Stuhlrehder, Miller,,
Crowley, and Layden have played to-1
gether for four years and they have
their work down to the point where i
the plays go off with every man in,
step.
This backfield has every quality a
coach might ask. Stuhlrehder is a field
general par excellence. The two halves
are wonders at running the ends, and
Layden has proved to be a sensational
line-cracker. All of them can pass and
Miller and Crowley are great in the
open field after receiving the ball. It
is the aerial attack of this outfit that
made its reputation, but its members
are capable of varying their offense.
Both of Notre Dame's scores against
Princeton came when Layden fooled
the opposition by smashing the line
after open work had advanced the ball
within scoring distance.

Opposed to this group of stars Stan
ford will probably use the same set
of backs that started the Big Game, j
Norman Cleaveland will not play, con-;
trary reports notwithstanding. Nevers;
may get into shape but a man who has
had both ankles broken during one,
season is a shaky proposition at best, j
Notre Dame has played no games
west of Nebraska this year but never
theless Warner will have his team
well coached to meet the Catholic at- !
tack. "Pop" has seen Rockne's men;
play many times in the past and he;
knows their style. Then, too, the East-!
erners met Carnegie in Pittsburgh
last Saturday and a lot of Warner's
boys back in the old home town were!
out there getting the latest dope. With
this information at hand it is not likely;
that the boys from the Farm will lose;
their heads when the invaders cut!
loose with their favorite plays.
Practice Starts Monday
At present the varsity is resting up
and getting ready for finals, but it
will be back at work again Monday
afternoon. Three weeks of intensive j
practice should bring the men back
to the height of their form. Except j
for Nevers the cripples will be back
in good physical shape and, barring
further mishaps the squad should be j
in better shape January 1 than it has [
been at any time since the Oregon
game.
Football fans on the Pacific Coast
will have the treat of a lifetime New
Year's Day when Notre Dame, premier
grid machine of the East, goes against
Pop Warner's Stanford varsity in the
Rose Bowl at Pasadena —the chance
of a lifetime because it will be the
first occasion on record that the fa
mous Irish from South Bend have
ever invaded the West to try to grab
a new championship for their already
large collection.
Except for the play of St. Mary's
varsity the great system developed by
Knute Rockne, which has kept Notre
Dame in the center of the football map
for the past five years, is an unknown
quantity to most local followers of the
tan bark sport. They have heard the
Smith and Warner systems praised to
the skies and now that a chance to
see the product of another famous
school of football presents itself they
can judge for themselves just how the
best.on the Coast stacks up with the
pick of the East.
Notre Dame Has Edge
On the basis of their record during
the past season Notre Dame is con
ceded a small edge over Stanford. The
Irish are fast as greased lightning,
while all year Warner has had to put
up with a comparatively slow back
field. This gives the invaders an ad
vantage to start with, but offsetting
this is the fact that' several of Notre
Dame's opponents, notably Carnegie!
Tech, have been able to pierce the
Irish defense. If these facts mean:
anything it would not be surprising to 1
see a repetition of the Big Game with j
both teams Bcoring several times.
Stanford will outweigh the Eastern
ers. That is a foregone conclusion, for
Rockne's teams are always light. He j
sacrifices beef for speed and as a re
sult every man on his squad is a
sprinter. This light forward wall has j
succeeded in holding the attacks of
such teams as Princeton and Georgia
Tech but it should find its hands full
when it hits the Card line.
