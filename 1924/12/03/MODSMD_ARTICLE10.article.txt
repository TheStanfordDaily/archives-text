# DEBATE STORIES RECALLED
## Speakers Gather for Session of Yarns; Contest Not Path of Roses 
### 
Extemporaneous speaking has its
perils and pitfalls, according to the
reminiscences and stories of previous
contests which we're heard yesterday
afternoon as the speakers and coaches
gathered for an informal discussion of
tonight's Extemporaneous Speaking
contest.
One coach recalled the occasion in
the oratorical contest some years ago
when a certain bright young speaker
held the audience absolutely in the palm
of his hand for almost the whole of his
address. Just before the close, how
ever, it seems that he completely forgot
his train of thought, and made such a
terrible showing that it absolutely
spoiled any chances he might have for
winning the prize.
The story goes that the next speaker
got to the platform, and had appro

| priately arranged to begin his oration
I with a quotation from Kipling:
"Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet
Lest we forget! Lest we forget!"
Lights Used Effectively.
All of which roused another delegate
to relate the method used by Albert J.
Beveridge in winning the interstate
oratorical championship of the middle
west several years ago. It is said that
Beveridge was the last on the program,
and before the contest lie bribed the
janitor of the building to leave the
lights low during the first speeches and
just as he got up, to turn them on as
bright as possible. The janitor did, and
as the lights came on the audience was
rather startled, sat up straight, and
Beveridge orated his way to first prize.
And that recalled a time when an-
other great man won the same contest.
Professor James Gordon Emerson, the
Stanford debate coach, was a victor in
the same event, several years later.
Rut his case was the exact oppQsite.
During his oration the lights went out,
and Emerson very glibly remarked that
his truths were such that they could be
seen even in the dark, and he went
straight on, and won first prize.
Some other representative then
chimed in with the suggestion that a
list be composed of all the famous men
who had been noted collegiate speak
ers. The impromptu list shaped itself
as follows: Woodrow Wilson, Calvin
Coolidge, ex-Governor Yates of Illinois,
ex-Senator Theodore E. Burton of Ohio,
Governor Preus of Minnesota, Albert
J. Beveridge, William Jennings Bryan,
and Robert M. La Follette as well as
Robert M. La Follette, Jr.
For the first time in the history of
the University of Michigan, the fresh
man class is to be allowed to handle
its own cases of discipline. The fresh
man discipline committee will have
the power to deal with all violations of
traditions and customs of which the
men of '28 are found guilty.
