# AUTO THIEVES PLAY HAVOC WITH CAMPUS MACHINES THIS WEEK
## 
### 
Automobile thieves are reaping a
harvest these days on the Stanford
campus, and it looks as though the
local sleuths will have to stay up all
night in the future to protect the inno
cent auto owners.
Claude Wakefield of the Sigma Nu
house was the first victim, and his was
a double dose, as his Ford roadster
was stolen twice in two days, and is
now in San Francisco in the hands of
the police awaiting his arrival.
Scott King was, and still is, the
next victim. His Dodge Roadster was
stolen from in front of the Theta
Delta Chi house last night, and is as
yet numbered among the missing. The
number of his car is 379290, and a
reward will be paid to anyone recover
ing the machine.
