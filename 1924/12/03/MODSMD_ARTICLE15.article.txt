# DULCY SHOULD PROVIDE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF COMEDY
## 
### Charles Parks 
If the house isn't packed next Satur
day night when the sophomore class
presents "Dulcy," there will be a lot
of people missing a golden opportunity
to laugh their heads off at something
really worth laughing at. The play
itself has the "makin's," and Gordon
Davis and his crew of "last-years"
hare certainly done the "makin." Any
i one who might drop in on rehearsal
would soon realize that all the gymna
sium apparatus isn't in the gym. There
are .dumbells, and dumbells.
Peggy Randall plays the title role to
perfection. She is so good, in fact, that
unless we really knew her, we might
think —well anyway, we all hope that
she can step out of the part as easily
as she stepped into it. Miss Randall
is playing a hard part, and our pro
phecy is that she'll prove to the cam
pus that the 1926 class can't claim
ALL the finds.
As for Les Herth, the way he han
dles a dumbell would make any gym
nast turn green with envy. A more
I iffectionate and thoughtful husband
lias never graced the Stanford stage.
!He is adoration personified, and his
words and carcsses of consolation are
| even more than enough to inspire the
life-long trust and confidence of our
fair Dulcina.
And who would have thought that
j old George Jean Nathan himself could
have been a staid and hard-headed
business man even for two weeks!
Thundering across the footlights, and
relieving the even temper of several
hilarious scenes, boom the powerful
tones of the inevitable magnavox. But
r or some unknown reason Charlie in
pires quite some confidence, and it's
I a sure bet that when he's on the
j stage mutilating one end of a Corona-
Corona in typical Theodore Roberts
I fashion, the scene won't die for lack
|
of action. No production could be com
plete without Charlie's hand in it
I somewhere.
