# Jumping Jacks

President Wilbur recently advocated the abolition of state examining
boards in the fields of law, medicine and engineering.
In their efforts to keep up standards, these examining bodies have been
guilty of too much standardization. In other words, their requirements
include too many formulated tests. To meet them, students must go
through set courses of study, regardless of advances in their particular
fields, to the detriment of individual research for the advance of knowledge.
President Wilbur's recommendations include the shifting of the respon
sibility of keeping up standards to recognized universities, better able to
keep abreast with the progress of science, and better able to determine
how students should spend their time.
The "docile student" absorbs only that knowledge already existent.
He is passive; a parasite, contributing nothing.
The "active student" enters his field looking for the undiscovered;
searching for new facts, proving them and giving them to the world.
It is to the benefit of the latter type that the President's plan would act.
Perhaps there is an analogy to this situation within the University it
self. The student who sincerely wants to learn has no need of the "set
hurdles" prescribed in the form of examinations, or stimulation by way
of uncomplimentary grades. Until there is a preponderance of such uni
versity men and women, however, we will continue jumping at set intervals.
There's a high hurdle directly ahead.â€”R. L. S.
