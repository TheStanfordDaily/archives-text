Roughs' Day has completed its cycle. Conceived as a remedy for
something - vastly worse—the Washington's Birthday P-rade—it dragged
apathetically along for a few years with steadily declining health, and last
week through the merciful kindness of the Men's Council it gave up its
little ghost. Traditions, are never hardy unless there is sound good sense
behind them, or at any rate unless they are vastly more attractive to the
eye, ear, nose, and throat than was the deceased.
With Roughs' Day there perishes the last bond of equality between
Stanford and the average high school. Stanford may now stand as an
institution of higher education the year round, without the annual five
hour lapse into' kid pranks on a grand scale. It is doubtful that dressing
in outlandish clothes was ever an inspiration to anything save the casting
off of all restraint—and when a collection of college men do that, there is
usually something popping.
The "razzing" of underclassmen has done no particular harm, but
neither has it done any good. The trend of the times has modified this
angle of the entertainment anyhow, leaving freak costumes as the only
ethical and legal justification for the event. And only about ten per cent
cared enough about it, this year, to put on these comic decorations.
In all probability Roughs' Day would have starved to death within the
next four years. The Men's Council has only rendered a humane service
in anticipating logical evolution.
STANFORD has taken eight prizes in national thesis contests con
ducted by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. No other uni
versity has taken more than two. We modestly refrain from comment.
