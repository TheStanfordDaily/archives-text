# "HOLY CITY" CHORUS WILL BEGIN FINAL PRACTICES TONIGHT
## 
### 
Choir, Schubert Club, and Glee Club i
will meet tonight in the Memorial
Church at 7:30, instead of Thursday,
to begin final practice rehearsals on
"The Holy City," the oratorio by Al- j
fred R. Gaul, which will be sung 1 a I
week from Sunday morning in mem
ory of the late Professor Alden.
All of the choral organizations of
the University are co-operating in this!
tribute. The choir of the First Pres- j
byterian Church of Palo Alto, of which
Professor Alden was a member, will i
also take part.
It is particularly appropriate that
"The Holy City" should be chosen for
presentation at this occasion, for Dr.
Alden once conducted this work with
the choir of the Presbyterian church.
The soloists for the oratorio are j
singers from the Stanford-Palo Altoj
community and include: Mrs. Sara 1
Bibby Brown, Mrs. S. S. Seward, Jr., |

Mrs. Dean Buchan, Dr. G. B. Little,
Harry Robertson, and Professor
Charles Mover.
The Schubert Club, under the direc
tion of Mrs. Warren D. Allen, will sing
the choruses which are for women's
voices, and will also join the Glee
Club and choirs in the climaxes of the
oratorio.
Next week's practice will also be
on Wednesday on account of Miss
Gauthier's recital.
