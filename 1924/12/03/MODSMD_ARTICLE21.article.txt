THE REWARD OF VIRTUE
Once there was a little lad named
Aloysius Pudunt;
Working on his studies occupied him
all the day.
And his mother often worried, saying,
"Al, you shouldn't
Read so much in them there books.
Now run along and play!"
Aloysius disregarded all remarks of
mamma's.
He preferred to gather learning for
the morrow's school.
Yes, he boned from sunrise 'till he
donned his wool pajamas—
In a recitation, Aloysius was no fool.
Gerald Arthur Keeter lived a boyhood
of abandon,
Often playing hookey, for he just de
tested books.
Called upon to answer, he had not a
leg to stand on.
Early Jerry had a preference for the
ladies' looks.
Jerry and Al Pudunt after awhile were
sent to college—
Registered in courses requisite for a
degree;
And, at last, they were successful in
their quest for knowledge;
And, at last, they got their sheepskins
—when they paid the fee.
Which one got the job? I ask. Now
tell me, was it Pudunt?
He to whom hard labor was a frolic
and a joy?
Keeter, you perhaps will think, who
might have worked but wouldn't?
Someone 'way in back said, "Al." He's
wrong! The office-boy.
