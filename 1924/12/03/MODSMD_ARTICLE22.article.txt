"The Silent Watcher" —Stanford,
Wednesday.
Another "timely drama" —at least,
we kept looking at the clock through
half the play. But even at that, the
picture was at times really good, resur
rected by the efforts of Bessie Love.
Glenn Hunter grimaces and wiggles
his already overworked eyebrows, and
so on and on.
The play itself —Young man loves
wife and is devoted to boss; boss
mixes in politics and women; Y. M.
falsely accused for boss; big mix-up;
final happy fade-out with repentant
boss in background. Add a few moral
izing and sentimental sub-titles and
stir thoroughly. You have the com
plete picture.
Incidentally, we hate to think such
an innocent exists who does not know
big men cannot afford to save their
proteges by exposing themselves. It
isn't done in the best political circles.

Bull fights are giving way to English
soccer football in Spain today. Sports
are entirely separate from the univer
sities and are sponsored by athletic
clubs bearing English names.
