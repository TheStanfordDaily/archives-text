# SOPHOMORES TAKE CLOSE GAME FROM YEARLING FIVE 17-16
## 
### 
Sophomore hoop men staged an up
hill fight and carried the game into an
extra period to win a hairbreadth 17 to
16 victory over the freshman interclass
five yesterday. The '28 seconds took an
abbreviated contest from the "last
year's" 11 to 9.
Coach Husky Hunt ran in about four
complete teams of yearlings during the
first game, and they showed remarkably
well against sophomore players from
the varsity squad. Vincent, Sheffield,
and Hawley at forward, Dennis and
Guthrie at center, and Clark and Sau
ters at guard looked like good material
for the first yearling squad.
Price, Southworth, Riese, and Ander
son, '27 numeral men, showed flashes
of brilliance but had difficulty in work
ing together. Price at running guard
was easily the star of the contest. He
ran up six points for the high individual
total, and scored the winning basket in
the extra five-minute period.
The sophomores started strong, piling
up three goals before the yearlings got
going. After a few substitutes had been
sent in the '28 men took the offensive
under the lead of Vincenti and scored
eight points while their opponents
looked on. The half ended 8 to 6.
Sophomores Poor Shots.
Although they had plenty of shots at
the basket the second-year players
failed to connect successfully and re
mained behind until the end. Just as
the gun went off Riese tossed in the
goal which tied the count at 15 up. In
the additional period the babes added
one tally on a foul goal but the sophs
won out on Price's basket.
The starting line-ups:
Frosh (16) Position Sophs (17)
Vincenti (5) F Southworth (5)
Nye F George
Dennis C Anderson (2)
Clark (1) G Price (6)
Reynolds G Clark
Substitutions Freshmen—Nye for
Vinccnti, Stuart (2) for Nye, Sheffield

for Dennis, Harlowe for Guthrie, Mc-
Murray for Clark, Sauters (1) for
Reynolds.
Sophomores—Riese (4) for George,
Walker for Anderson, Rowles for
Clark.
Babe Seconds Win Easily.
Owing to the trouble with the light
ing which caused considerable delay
the second team game was played in
shortened periods. Hunt again used
his reserves liberally, and they outshot
and outpasscd the sophomores consist
ently. The score at half time was 6 to
5 in favor of the freshmen. Crist, '28,
was high point man with five markers.
The first-year five goes against the
juniors tomorrow at 4:10 on the long
end of the odds as the third-year men
; looked unimpressive when they lost to
the seniors Monday.

the extra five-minute period.
The sophomores started strong, piling
up three goals before the yearlings got
going. After a few substitutes had been
sent in the '28 men took the offensive
under the lead of Vincenti and scored
eight points while their opponents
looked on. The half ended 8 to 6.
Sophomores Poor Shots.
Although they had plenty of shots at
the basket the second-year players
failed to connect successfully and re
mained behind until the end. Just as
the gun went off Riese tossed in the
goal which tied the count at 15 up. In
the additional period the babes added
one tally on a foul goal but the sophs
won out on Price's basket.

Babe Seconds Win Easily.
Owing to the trouble with the light
ing which caused considerable delay
the second team game was played in
shortened periods. Hunt again used
his reserves liberally, and they outshot
and outpasscd the sophomores consist
ently. The score at half time was 6 to
5 in favor of the freshmen. Crist, '28,
was high point man with five markers.
The first-year five goes against the
juniors tomorrow at 4:10 on the long
end of the odds as the third-year men
; looked unimpressive when they lost to
the seniors Monday.
Sophomore hoop men staged an up
hill fight and carried the game into an
extra period to win a hairbreadth 17 to
16 victory over the freshman interclass
five yesterday. The '28 seconds took an
abbreviated contest from the "last
year's" 11 to 9.
Coach Husky Hunt ran in about four
complete teams of yearlings during the
first game, and they showed remarkably
well against sophomore players from
the varsity squad. Vincent, Sheffield,
and Hawley at forward, Dennis and
Guthrie at center, and Clark and Sau
ters at guard looked like good material
for the first yearling squad.
Price, Southworth, Riese, and Ander
son, '27 numeral men, showed flashes
of brilliance but had difficulty in work
ing together. Price at running guard
was easily the star of the contest. He
ran up six points for the high individual
total, and scored the winning basket in
the extra five-minute period.
