# Y. W. WORKERS WILL SPEAK THIS EVENING
## 
### 
Miss Maude Russell, Y. W. C. A.
worker supported in China by Stan
ford women, and Miss Henrietta
Thompson, foreign student secretary of
the west coast, will speak to Univer
sity women in the Roble lobby at 7:15
tonight.
"The Youthful Movement" will be
the subject discussed. The foreign ex
perience of Miss Russel and Miss
Thompson especially fits them to tell
of this movement of youth all over the
world to take matter in its own hands,
to formulate opinions on such subjects
as war and race, to abolish prejudice
and think for itself instead of being
content with the statements of its
elders. Here in the West the informa
tion which Miss Russel is able to give
about Chinese students is especially
pertinent.
Miss Russel and Miss Thompson ar
rived on the campus yesterday and will
be the guests of Miss Isabel Capps, Y.
W. C. A. secretary, until Friday.
