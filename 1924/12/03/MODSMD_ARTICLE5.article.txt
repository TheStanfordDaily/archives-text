# STANFORD GOLFERS LAUNCH CAMPAIGN FOR CAMPUS LINKS
## All-University Club Formed As Working Unit With Dorsey as Head 
### 
i j The first shot in the campaign for
i a golf course on the Stanford campus
was fired last night when links en
i thusiasts met in the Old Union and
organized an all-University golf club.
Several plans for securing concerted
action toward the desired end were
advanced. It was decided to further
arouse favorable sentiment existing at
present among the undergraduates, to
enlist the aid of the faculty and the
alumni, and to gather all avilable data
on golf facilities in universities
throughout the country.
The following officers were elected:
Eli E. Dorsey, president; Harvey Ly
j tel, vice-president; Alfred Post, Jr.,
I secretary; C. Vance Carter, treasurer.
Carter, manager of the 1924 varsity,
declared that the majority of the
alumni body favored the construction
of a course on the campus. If suitable
playing facilities were available the
graduates would flock here in large
numbers for week-end visits and would
in that way keep in closer touch with
current University needs.
Great Natural Advantages
From the standpoint of available
land and favorable climate Stanford
enjoys greater natural golf advantages
than any other institution in the coun
try. There is no other university hav
ing as much waste land so admirably
suited for a links, where weather con
ditions allow the brassy swingers, to
engage in their sport the year round.
Carter pointed out that a course
could be constructed with a minimum
of expense and could easily become
self-supporting. A start was made sev
eral years ago on a nine-hole course
back of President Wilbur's home, but
because of lack of financial backing
the proposition was dropped. Greens
were leveled off and cups sunk. As a
! temporary measure oiled sand greens
' could be installed at a relatively low
j cost. Harold Sampson, professional at
: the Burlingame Country Club, has
agreed to do all the work incidental
to laying out a course free of charge.
He lias also promised to coach the
varsity players in his spare time and
to do all in his power to develop a
Cardinal golf team capable of beating
California.
A second meeting of the club was
, called for Thursday, December 11, at
| 8 p.m.
