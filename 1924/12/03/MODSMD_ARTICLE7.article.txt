An embryo Robert M. LaFollette, j
Albert J. Beveridge, or William Jen- j
nings Bryan is to be selected tonight j
in the Stanford Assembly hall. All
three of these men, during their col
lege careers, were winners of an in
terstate public speaking contest very
similar to the Coast Extemporaneous
Contest scheduled for 8 o'clock tonight. I
Representatives of seven coast col
leges arrived here today. They are to,
speak tonight on the general subject j
of the power of the United States â– 
supreme court to declare acts of Con- j
gress unconstitutional. This topic was
chosen two months ago, and tonight,
an hour before the fireworks, an en
velope will be opened which was last
sealed by the professor of Political
Science at the University of Illinois.
This contains the specific subjects for j
the disagreement.
The candidates will be allowed to j
prepare during the hour, and will ap
pear according to drawn lot. Professor I

j Robinson of the Stanford department
fof history will be the chairman of the
j affair, and he will announce each
speaker, without telling the school he
represents.
The contest is to be judged by the
debate coaches of the contesting
schools. Each coach rates every con
testant but his own, which is exactly
the opposite of what each coach really
wants to do tonight. Stanford's judge
will be Professor James Gordon Emer
| son, faculty debate advisor. The "Other
: judges are: Southern California, Alan
Nichols; Oregon, O. A. Brown; Oregon
Agricultural College, Earle Wells;
j Whitman College will be represented
by William M. Proctor, now at Stan
ford. formerly of Whitman; and Wil
lamette University's judging represen
j tative is Professor William H. Davis,
| temporarily of the Food Research De
partment at Stanford and formerly
head of the public speaking depart-
ment at Bowdoin College. The Wash
ington State College's representative
is unknown as yet.
The contesting . representatives of
the various schools are: Stanford,
Stanley A. Weigel; Southern California,
William Barber; Oregon, Sol Abra
hamson; Oregon Agricultural College,
Robert Kerr; Washington State Col
lege, Fred Weller; Willamette Univer
sity, Ward Southworth; and Whitman
College, Richard H. Ayres.
The first meeting of the Coast Public
Speaking League, which is the sponsor
for the contest, was held this after
noon in the Board of Directors room
of the Administration building. It was
called to order at 2:30 by Professor
Emerson of Stanford, the president
of the League. President Ray Lyman
Wilbur formally welcomed the repre
sentatives to Stanford.
Tomorrow two additional meetings
of the League will be held. In the
afternoon the delegates are to be
shown about the campus, and at 6
o'clock a banquet will be served in
the Union. Some tickets to the ban
quet have been put on sale for Stan
ford students and are available from
W. Leslie Gosslin, member of the
