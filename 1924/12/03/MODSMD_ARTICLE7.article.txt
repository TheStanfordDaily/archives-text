three of these men, during their col

Representatives of seven coast col
leges arrived here today. They are to,
speak tonight on the general subject j
of the power of the United States ■
supreme court to declare acts of Con- j

chosen two months ago, and tonight,
an hour before the fireworks, an en
velope will be opened which was last
sealed by the professor of Political
Science at the University of Illinois.
This contains the specific subjects for j
the disagreement.
The candidates will be allowed to j
prepare during the hour, and will ap
pear according to drawn lot. Professor I

j Robinson of the Stanford department
fof history will be the chairman of the
j affair, and he will announce each
speaker, without telling the school he
represents.
The contest is to be judged by the
debate coaches of the contesting
schools. Each coach rates every con
