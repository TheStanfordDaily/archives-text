"The remote antiquity of the Egyp-j
tion monuments and their rare inscrip
tions, which have baffled the sagacity
of centuries, are the reasons why no
intelligent man can be indifferent to
the recent excavations in the tomb of;
Tutankhamen," declared Professor j
Jean Capart of Liege University, Bel-|
gium, in his talk last night at the
Little Theatre.
Professor Capart showed many
slides of the Valley of the Kings and
the interiors of the tombs. He ex
hibited a map of Thebes, which was
in ancient times on the right bank of
the Nile, but now is considered to be
located on the left bank.
"All through history," he said, "there
has been an unceasing struggle be
tween the efforts of those who wish
to preserve the royal mummies, and
the attempts of thieves to pillage the!
burial places."
In ISI7 an Italian archaeologist first!
penetrated a tomb in the valley, and
going through long passages and down !
numerous steps, found the elaborate j
sarcophagus of the king. t
"From 1817 to IS9B almost nothing |
worth noting was discovered in the
Valley of the Tombs," said Capart.!
"Then in 1898 two new tombs were
unearthed.
"Archaeologist Davis of Newport,
discovered and explored two new;
tombs, one of a king and the other
of his queen, in 1902. Several small!
relics with the name Tutankhamen
were found, and Davis believed that
the tomb had been destroyed and pil
laged. '
"Lord Carnovan unearthed some
small stones one day in the midst of
excavation," he explained. "He thought
that the entrance to a tomb would be
in a different part of the valley, but
after a long period of labor, he un
covered the first step of the staircase
to the tomb of King Tutankhamen."
