# WEIGEL IS PACIFIC COAST VICTOR IN SPEAKING CONTEST
## William Barber of Southern California Takes Next Place in Battle 
### Robert Littler 
Stanley A. Weigel of Stanford, de
livering one of the best speeches ever
presented in the Assembly hall, last
night won the charfpionship of the
Pacific Coast in extemporaneous
speaking by a margin of eight points
over his nearest competitor.
Weigel received four firsts, one sec
ond, and one third, totalling nine
points. The next on the list was Wil
liam Barber of Southern California,
who rated one first, one second, two
thirds and two fourths, bringing his
average to seventeen. Fred Weller, of
Washington State, and Robert Kerr of
Oregon Agricultural College, tied for
third.
The contest was under the direction
of the Pacific Coast Public Speaking
ILeague, which is now in session at
Stanford. The general subject for the
<liscussion as chosen two months ago
was: "The power of the Supreme
Court to declare acts of Congress un
constitutional." The specific topics
were assigned the speakers one hour
l>efore the contest.
Stanford Man Spoke Fifth
Weigel was fifth speaker of the eve
ning. He deserves particular praise
■because in the drawing of topics he
was saddled with an almost impossible
subject, "The supreme court's inter
pretation of the 'due process' clauses
and the 1 consequent domination of
state legislation by federal courts."
Anyone without Weigel's genius for
Ituman interest would have been
snowed under at the outset.
The Stanford man presented by far
the most interesting address of the
evening, as he pointed out the his
torical origin of the due process
•clauses and then told of the defense
of these clauses by the supreme court
against legislation by the states.
Weigel was at the height of his
glory last night, since his strength
always lies in polish, good nature,
good humor, and human interest. And
those are exactly the things necessary
in an extemporaneous speaking con
test.
Barber of U. S. C., the only near
rival that Weigel had, was, on the!
other hand, out of his element com
pletely. Barber is essentially a com
bat speaker, a debater. Last night he
seemed unable to get warmed up, and
was not as effective as he usually is
in a free-for-all debate. Even at that,
Barber, speaking on the subject of the
"steps by which the supreme court
has taken over the veto" well fulfilled
the expectation that U. S. C. would
have an extraordinarily good speaker.
Robert Kerr, of O. A. C., who tied
for third, was under the handicap of
speaking first. His knowledge of the
subject was what saved him from
oblivion.
The judges of the contest were the
coaches of the contestants, each coach
rating every speaker but own.
Tomorrow there will be two meet
ings of the Pacific Coast Speaking
League and in the afternoon the dele
gates will be conducted over the cam
pus by some of the Stanford debaters.
In the evening there will bo a ban
quet for the members of the confer
ence at the Union.

rival that Weigel had, was, on the!
other hand, out of his element com
pletely. Barber is essentially a com
bat speaker, a debater. Last night he
seemed unable to get warmed up, and
was not as effective as he usually is
in a free-for-all debate. Even at that,
Barber, speaking on the subject of the
"steps by which the supreme court
has taken over the veto" well fulfilled
the expectation that U. S. C. would
have an extraordinarily good speaker.
Robert Kerr, of O. A. C., who tied
for third, was under the handicap of
speaking first. His knowledge of the
subject was what saved him from
oblivion.
The judges of the contest were the
coaches of the contestants, each coach
rating every speaker but own.
Tomorrow there will be two meet
ings of the Pacific Coast Speaking
League and in the afternoon the dele
gates will be conducted over the cam
pus by some of the Stanford debaters.
In the evening there will bo a ban

ence at the Union.
Stanley A. Weigel of Stanford, de
livering one of the best speeches ever
presented in the Assembly hall, last
night won the charfpionship of the
Pacific Coast in extemporaneous
speaking by a margin of eight points
over his nearest competitor.
Weigel received four firsts, one sec
ond, and one third, totalling nine
points. The next on the list was Wil
liam Barber of Southern California,
who rated one first, one second, two
thirds and two fourths, bringing his
average to seventeen. Fred Weller, of
Washington State, and Robert Kerr of
Oregon Agricultural College, tied for
third.
The contest was under the direction
of the Pacific Coast Public Speaking
ILeague, which is now in session at
Stanford. The general subject for the
<liscussion as chosen two months ago
was: "The power of the Supreme
Court to declare acts of Congress un
constitutional." The specific topics
were assigned the speakers one hour
l>efore the contest.
Stanford Man Spoke Fifth
Weigel was fifth speaker of the eve
ning. He deserves particular praise
■because in the drawing of topics he
was saddled with an almost impossible
subject, "The supreme court's inter
pretation of the 'due process' clauses
and the 1 consequent domination of
state legislation by federal courts."
Anyone without Weigel's genius for
Ituman interest would have been
snowed under at the outset.
The Stanford man presented by far
the most interesting address of the
evening, as he pointed out the his
torical origin of the due process
•clauses and then told of the defense
of these clauses by the supreme court
against legislation by the states.
Weigel was at the height of his
glory last night, since his strength
always lies in polish, good nature,
good humor, and human interest. And
those are exactly the things necessary
in an extemporaneous speaking con
test.
Barber of U. S. C., the only near
rival that Weigel had, was, on the!
other hand, out of his element com
pletely. Barber is essentially a com
