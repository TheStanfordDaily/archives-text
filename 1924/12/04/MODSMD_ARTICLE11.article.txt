# FORMER CARD ATHLETE IS NEW YORK BANK PRESIDENT
## 
### Robert Littler 
In the Stanford-California 6 to 6
game of 1895, the Card hero was |
Jack Reynolds, right halfback, of thej
class of '96.
Today that same gentleman occu
pies a fourth of a page in "Who's Who
in America" under the title of Jack-|
son Eli Reynolds, president of the
First National Bank of New York, the
second largest financial institution on
the American continent.
"One of the best football players we
ever had was Jack Reynolds," says
Dr. Jordan. "He was a big fellow. He
i could plow right through the line. His
brother, Dr. Harry Reynolds, of Palo
Alto, was also a good player, but he
was too fragile. He was always get-:
ting broken up at the wrong time."
On Varsity Two Years
Jack Reynolds played right half for
j two years, '94 and '95. In '94, Stanford
| won from California, 6 to 0. And dur- 1
| ing the same season, the Cardinals j
1 played two games with the University!
? of Chicago. The first one gave Chicago j
a 24 to 4 win, and the second, Stanford
the victory, with a 6 to 0 score. Walter
Camp was at this time coach of the
Stanford team.
The next year, '95, Stanford's three
important games were with the Olym
pic Club and the University of Cali
fornia. The California game was a
tie, and the two with the club re- j
I suited in Stanford victories.
Started in Law Work
After practicing law from 1901 on
i New York City, Reynolds started
financial work. Now, aside from his
1 banking connections, he is a trustee
of Columbia University, and a director
of twelve nationally-known business i
corporations.
i Dr. Jordan's present opinion of the
man is that "He has made a visible
[ mark among bankers."
