# Palo Alto Police Brazened By New Uniforms, Members
## 
### 
"Clothes make the man" or "There
is safety in numbers" probibly consti-
I tute the reasons for the Palo Alto
i police department suddenly breaking
away from its former peaceful condi
-1 tion. Within the last few weeks the
number of arrests, and sensational
man-hunts have increased to such an
extent that Palo Alto is no longer
safe for criminals or even petty of
fenders.
The force now numbers thirteen of
ficers and twelve uniforms, as one of
J the policemen is a policewoman. Ac
cording to a press report, plans are
being made to secure a dog for each
officer. One of these dogs and a police
man are supposed to equal two armed
men; therefore the force will soon
' number twenty-six.
The roll will probably be called in
; this manner: "Off'fficer Dugan, Officer
Fido, Officer O'Brien, Officer Rex â€”ad
I infinitum."
