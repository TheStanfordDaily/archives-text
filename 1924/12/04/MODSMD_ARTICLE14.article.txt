: row night, the festivities will be con
| tinued with a Tea Dance on Saturday

I of grease-paint that evening with the
! showing of the Sophomore Play,
I "Dulcy." Just as an added attraction,
there will also be a dance In the

the show, where the erstwhile thes
l pians will mingle with the common
herd to receive adulation.
Arrangements are being made with
i a San Francisco firm to supply the
j Cotillion committee with several hun
dred umbrellas, because the Encina
dining halls are furnishing food for!
the famishing folks who will attend:
the dance, and if it should rain somej

Encina.
Tea Dance Inexpensive
The Tea Dance on Saturday after
noon will be open to those with the
price, which incidentally will be the
lowest admission charge for a two

seen. Twenty-five cents is all the com
mittee is asking for the privilege of
trotting to the strains of Tyroler's ag
gregation of melody hounds, and as
j though that were not enough to do
for the patrons, the management has
arranged for a prize dance.
At some time during the celebration,
a hole will be suddenly opened up in
the middle of the dance floor, and the
lucky couple who falls through will
1 be presented with three packages of
Wrigley's Spearmint gum.
