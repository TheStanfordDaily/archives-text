Duplicating last year's triumph oyer
j the California cross-country team, the
i Cardinal harriers sent the Bear run
ners down to defeat in the annual long
; distance race held in Berkeley yester
i day afternoon, 20-39, low score win
i ning.
The victory was secured by the
Stanford men in the face of the loss
of A1 Charles, captain, and Bob Cum
mings and the necessity of running
over an unfamiliar and poor course,
j Charles, winner last year, was forced
out of the race by a bad heart, while
j Cummings was lost through injury.
Kerr Presses Leader
Schwobeda of California carried off
individual honors over the 4 8-10 mile
course in (he time of 31:17. Bill Kerr
closely pressed the leader all the way
and finished only forty yards behind.
McClellan, Frank Hays, Clark Cypher,
j and Clifford, all of Stanford, took the
next four places, and Luther Bell and
j Ashley crossed the line in ninth and
I tenth places.
Coach "Dink" Templeton expressed
himself as being well pleased with
the squad's showing, especially after
losing two of the best men. With yes
terday's performances to bank on,
things bode well for the distance runs
i in the spring track meet with Cali
i fornia.
Course in Poor Condition
The Cardinal team would undoubt
edly have done better if they had
been accustomed to the course which
started from the big "C" and ended
there after winding over Grizzly Peak.
The course was not in good condition.
; At times brush hung completely over
I the trail, and it could be seen in some
places only with difficulty. The stretch
at the finish was rough and on a down
grade.
Even with such a disadvantage so
that they were forced to follow the
lead of the California men in order
not to lose the course, the Stanford
runners were able to outrun and beat
the Bears. Kerr, McClellan, Hays, Cy
pher, Clifford, and Bell all ran in the
cross-country race last year for Stan
ford.
