# WORKER RECOUNTS BENEFITS OF YOUTH MOVEMENT IN CHINA
## 
### 
"The youth movement is one of the
things that will be remembered this
era," declared Miss Maude Russel,
Stanford's Y. W. C. . representative in
China, at the women's meeting at
Roble last night, after she had ex
plained the four phases of the move
ment in China.
"The first pliase may be termed that
of innovations in literature," said Miss
Russel. "China in the past has been
hampered by the rigorous distinction
between the vernacular, an easy lan
guage and one also capable of fine
shades of meaning, and the Wenli
language, in which all writing had to
be couched until the last four or five
years. Wenli is so difficult that to
understand it one must have an in
conceivable background of literature
at hand.
"In consequence many scholars were
afraid to write, and only five per cent
of the population could read what was
written. This condition was changed
through the work of Dr. Hu Shih, who
demonstrated the suitability of the ver
nacular, or 'white language' for writ
ing. In 1919 400 magazines came out
in the vernacular, and its use has
steadily increased. This means that
the Chinese people are now enabled
to think together."
The second phase named by Miss
Russel was the student movement.
She described the means employed by
students to get out of office three men
who were traitors to the country, and
were selling China's resources to
Japan. The students struck, refusing
to return to study until their demands
were satisfied. They secured the co
operation of merchants and railroad
men, and effected their ends.
Miss Russel named as the results
of the student movement: "The stop
page of national looting; education by
students in public affairs through mob
meetings, parades, lectures, etc.; the
return of students to their rightful
place in the leadership of the coun
try; the fostering of national indus
try."
Social reconstruction was the last
phase of the youth movement to be
treated. "The Chinese have a passion
for sharing education," declared Miss
Russel. "Students have insisted on
criticizing the government when ne
cessary, regardless of personal dan
ger."

Social reconstruction was the last
phase of the youth movement to be
treated. "The Chinese have a passion
for sharing education," declared Miss
Russel. "Students have insisted on
criticizing the government when ne
cessary, regardless of personal dan
ger."
"The youth movement is one of the
things that will be remembered this
era," declared Miss Maude Russel,
Stanford's Y. W. C. . representative in
China, at the women's meeting at
Roble last night, after she had ex
plained the four phases of the move
ment in China.
"The first pliase may be termed that
of innovations in literature," said Miss
Russel. "China in the past has been
hampered by the rigorous distinction
between the vernacular, an easy lan
guage and one also capable of fine
shades of meaning, and the Wenli
language, in which all writing had to
be couched until the last four or five
years. Wenli is so difficult that to
understand it one must have an in
conceivable background of literature
at hand.
"In consequence many scholars were
afraid to write, and only five per cent
of the population could read what was
written. This condition was changed
through the work of Dr. Hu Shih, who
demonstrated the suitability of the ver
nacular, or 'white language' for writ
ing. In 1919 400 magazines came out
in the vernacular, and its use has
steadily increased. This means that
the Chinese people are now enabled
to think together."
The second phase named by Miss
Russel was the student movement.
She described the means employed by
students to get out of office three men
who were traitors to the country, and
were selling China's resources to
Japan. The students struck, refusing
to return to study until their demands
were satisfied. They secured the co
operation of merchants and railroad
men, and effected their ends.
Miss Russel named as the results
of the student movement: "The stop
