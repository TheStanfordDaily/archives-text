# Specialization

### 
Egotism has its own reward. Either youth has fooled its elders into
thinking it is important, or it really is important. The younger generation
is given endless thought and publicity; it is the only excuse for the exist
ence of our schools and universities; and as the numbers trying'to crowd
into the colleges increase, the entire educational problem becomes more
intense.
Recently there have appeared two articles, "How About the College ?"
by Edward Bok, and "Unpreparing the Student for Life" by Irwin Ed
man. Both writers agree on one point: That the majority of students do
not get out of college the training that will be most valuable to them. Mr.
Bok believes that "collegiate training should be more purposeful and
definite . . . but this does not mean that the practical shall displace the
cultural training in colleges."
Says Mr. Edman: "The University owes it to society in general, to
the parent, and to the student in particular, to turn out in its graduates
young men who, beside loving the true, the good, and the beautiful, are
expertly trained to do a specific kind and piece of work for themselves and
for society."
We in college are too close to the subject to be able to criticize or reject
these arguments. Neither of these men mention college "associations"
(so often referred to) as an essential of college life, and we ourselves feel
that they are right in leaving this item out of their discussions. One cannot
seriously imagine a man going to a University for four years just to meet
a lot of good fellows. The purpose, of course, should be to get equipped
for later life.
It seems that Princeton is the first college to recognize the need of
specialization, in an age when specialization is essential, by the institution
of the four course plan of study. Now all that is necessary is an increased
curriculum to support the plan. Princeton has ■awakened to the need be
fore any of its brother universities, and now all that is necessary is a great
deal of money and an equal amount of patience.—Daily Princctonian.
Stanford is hot on Princeton's trail so far as this "specialization" goes,
and in certain branches of science has long been accepted as turning out
graduates with a practical and workable fund of knowledge. It is the im
pression of the writer, who at secondary school was decidedly in Princeton
atmosphere, that Princeton's specialization is of more or less recent origin,
and has developed at some sacrifice of a really splendid "cultural" edu
cation.
As Mr. Bok remarks—"this does not mean that the practical shall dis
place the cultural training in colleges." At Stanford the cultural is largely
left to the ambition and initiative of the individual student. If one does
not want it, one need not receive more than a smattering of it. Perhaps it
would not hurt Stanford to emphasize the cultural side any more than it
will hurt Princeton to become efficiently practical.

intense.
Recently there have appeared two articles, "How About the College ?"
by Edward Bok, and "Unpreparing the Student for Life" by Irwin Ed
man. Both writers agree on one point: That the majority of students do
not get out of college the training that will be most valuable to them. Mr.
Bok believes that "collegiate training should be more purposeful and
definite . . . but this does not mean that the practical shall displace the
cultural training in colleges."
Says Mr. Edman: "The University owes it to society in general, to
the parent, and to the student in particular, to turn out in its graduates
young men who, beside loving the true, the good, and the beautiful, are
expertly trained to do a specific kind and piece of work for themselves and
for society."
We in college are too close to the subject to be able to criticize or reject
these arguments. Neither of these men mention college "associations"
(so often referred to) as an essential of college life, and we ourselves feel
that they are right in leaving this item out of their discussions. One cannot
seriously imagine a man going to a University for four years just to meet
a lot of good fellows. The purpose, of course, should be to get equipped
for later life.
It seems that Princeton is the first college to recognize the need of
specialization, in an age when specialization is essential, by the institution
of the four course plan of study. Now all that is necessary is an increased
curriculum to support the plan. Princeton has ■awakened to the need be
fore any of its brother universities, and now all that is necessary is a great
deal of money and an equal amount of patience.—Daily Princctonian.
Stanford is hot on Princeton's trail so far as this "specialization" goes,
and in certain branches of science has long been accepted as turning out
graduates with a practical and workable fund of knowledge. It is the im
pression of the writer, who at secondary school was decidedly in Princeton
atmosphere, that Princeton's specialization is of more or less recent origin,
and has developed at some sacrifice of a really splendid "cultural" edu
cation.
As Mr. Bok remarks—"this does not mean that the practical shall dis
place the cultural training in colleges." At Stanford the cultural is largely
left to the ambition and initiative of the individual student. If one does
not want it, one need not receive more than a smattering of it. Perhaps it
would not hurt Stanford to emphasize the cultural side any more than it
will hurt Princeton to become efficiently practical.
Egotism has its own reward. Either youth has fooled its elders into
thinking it is important, or it really is important. The younger generation
is given endless thought and publicity; it is the only excuse for the exist
ence of our schools and universities; and as the numbers trying'to crowd
into the colleges increase, the entire educational problem becomes more
intense.
