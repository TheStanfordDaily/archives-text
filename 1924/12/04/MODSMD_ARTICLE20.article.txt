# Another Problem

### 
One of the most recent refinements of civilization—the automobile
thief—has made a belated and lamented appearance on the campus. In
formal "borrowing" of cars by friends would be nothing new, however
irritating, but within the last two days it has turned out that somebody
means business.
It is most probable, and greatly to be hoped, that this modern "rustler"
is not a student. Be that as it may, the days of care-free disregard of the
ignition switch seem to be ended. Best lock Lizzie whenever you leave
her alone, at least until some of the internal-compression criminals are
well-jailed.
