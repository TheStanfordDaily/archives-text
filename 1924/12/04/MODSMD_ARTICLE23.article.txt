# THE 						LAW STEPS

« V. G. D. <8>
If there is anything which can sink
the human soul into blackest depths
or raise it to glorious heights it is to
love an unresponsive something,
whether an ideal, an ivory god, or
merely a person. If you want to test
the range of your emotions, try it.
But be as intellectual about it as you
possibly can.
"Sincere friendships, between men
and women students, free from senti
mentality . .
The opinion of the majority on this
is, apparently, "Bah!"
Listen for a moment to the ever
present buzz of tongues and the why
of it will gleam forth: to be seen with
a man twice means "Ah-ha!" and three
times —God wot! And once with an
engaged man all of a week's peace. It
is the work of a Hercules to "rise
above it."
Why couldn't the Creator have fixed
so that the men who wear their
bodies out with the strength of their
minds could leap into the skins of
some of the ifiultitudinous, super
healthy inane? We could easily wax
blasphemous on the subject. Especial
ly right now.
Perhaps one of Dr. Gardner's stu
dents wasn't so far wrong when he
answered to a question regarding the
chaplain's duties: "Oh, he gets up in
the pulpit, looks over the congregation
of students, and then prays for the
University."
All unconsciously, we may be the

reincarnation of Galsworthy's little
boy walking with his mother on a
very windy day. "Why don't the trees
stop moving about so fast? They make
it so windy, mamma!"
What has become of all the "View
points?"
If they are suppressed much longer
there is danger that a Senior walking
off with a Freshman dink, or a car
having a puncture on Palm Drive will
be sent to the Chronicle and entitled:
"Stanford Senior —Thief," a»d "Stan
ford Student Halts Traffic by Acci
dent."
•
"F'Heaven's Sakes," let's not divert
the boiling waters of student opinion
into the uncontrollable wilderness.
For after all, it takes two to speak
the truth: one to speak and another
to hear. And, ah me! Some day I'm
going j to write a book on the listeners
I have known? and the things they
have heard me say.
We should not be blamed for walk
ing away, incoherently murmuring to
ourselves.
