# Library Receives Valuable Dictionary Set from Spain
## 
### 
The Library has recently received
an important addition to its collection
of Spanish works in the "Diccionario
re la Lengua Castellana."
This is a monumental work pub
lished in six volumes by the Royal
Spanish Academy in 1726, thirteen
years after the foundation of the
academy by the Duke of Escalona
under the patronage of Philip V. This
dictionary, commonly known as the
"Diccionario de Autoridades," is the
only complete Spanish dictionary ever
published.
The first volume gives the only au
thoritative and complete history of
the foundation of the academy and of
its statutes, and an eighteenth century
treatise on the history of the -Spanish
language. The remaining five volumes
contain the dictionary proper.
