The University of Colorado has a
ruling that no freshman can enter the
stadium until all the upperclassmen
have their seats. It is generally ex-i
pected that the Frosh will put on a
snake dance between halves. Frosh
are also compelled to remain in their
seats until all the upperclassmen have
left the stadium.
