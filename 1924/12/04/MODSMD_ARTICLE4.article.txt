# Chappie Gives In; Crossword Craze Gains New Victims
## 
### 
Long suspected of being on the rag
ged edge of mental incompetency, the
Old Boy has at last taken a definite
step along that wavering road that
leads to the booby-hatcli. Yes, you
guessed it. The Foolish One plans to
put out a Crossword Puzzle Number.
Material must be in early, and early
means right away. Monday, November
8, has been set as the deadline for
both artistic and literary contribu
tions. The magazine will not be outj
until after the Christmas Holidays,;
but even humorists must study and
this date has been chosen with the
idea in mind of leaving ample time
for finals preparation.
Jokes do not necessarily have to
ileal with crossword puzzles, although
these are preferred. Any reasonable
theme is all right provided only it has j
mirth-provoking possibilities.
