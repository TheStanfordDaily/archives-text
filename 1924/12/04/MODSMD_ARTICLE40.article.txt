# INTRAMURAL TRACK TRIAL HEATS WILL BE HELD TOMORROW
## 
### 
Trial heats in seven intramural
track and field events will be run
off on the old track tomorrow after
noon in order that the meet next
Tuesday may be staged in the shortest
possible time. Twenty-two living
groups have sent in entries.
The first call for the 100-yard dash
will be issued at 3:45, and the 220-
yard dash, 120-yard high hurdles, and
220-yard low hurdles will follow in the
order named. Among the field events,
trials will be held in the high jump,
the pole vault, and the shot put.
Heats will be so arranged that no
two representatives of the same group
will compete against each other. C.
W. Davis urges that all contestants
report promptly.
In addition to the seven /events
named above, four heats will be run
in the relay. Members of the coach
ing staff will act as officials, while
track managers and tryoutees have
charge of the details of the meet.
