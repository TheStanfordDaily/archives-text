# Palo Alto Merchants Will Have Big Christmas Party
## 
### 
Dancing, music, tug-of-war, and nu
merous exhibits will contribute to the
success of the annual Palo Alto Mer
chants' Christmas party which will be
held tomorrow night.
Many of the Palo Alto stores will
be open but none will be doing any
business except creamery and candy
stores. Some will have orchestras
and stage an informal open house.
The ninety-piece Stanford band and
the Naval Reserve band will be on
hand to provide several band con
certs. Naturally a Santa Claus has
been secured to distribute small gifts.
The curtain will raise on the first
act at 7 p. m. and will not drop until
about 11 p. m.
