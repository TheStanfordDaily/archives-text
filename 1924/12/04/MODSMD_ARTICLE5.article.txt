# FORMER FRESHMAN FIVE SHOULD TURN OUT VARSITY MEN
## Ted Shipkey, David, Jayred, Are Best Sophomore Possibilities 
### Wilbur Adams 
Material from last year's freshman
basketball five is expected to furnish
the foundation for a strong varsity
quintet this season.
Although a trifle inexperienced, the
'27 men individually possess ability
which can well be turned into first
class possibilities.
„ Game Called Off
The game with the Amblers Club at'
Stockton has been called off, due to l
the break it makes in the Christmas |
vacation, and because of the game i
with Notre Dame, most of the veteran |
basketball players being on the foot-|
ball squad.
The new men will be expected to
fill possibly one forward position,
either a center or guard position—
taking into consideration that Gurdon
Steele may be shifted from the center
position to the running guard berth —
and most of the reserve places.
Ted Shipkey Promising
Ted Shipkey, who will be busy at
football for the remainder of this
year, is an outstanding possibility for
a running guard, and might prove
capable enough to save Kerr the ne
cessity of shifting Steele from center.
Shipkey is fast and has the necessary
weight.
Fred Price, captain of the freshmen
last year, is a real find. Price is not
a big man, but his clever floor work
and his fight should secure him a posi
tion on this season's varsity. Running
guard in Price's natural place although
he has played forward until this year.
Nelson David and Harry Southworth
are the two best bets from the sopho
more class for the forward position
line. Both men are consistent, and
David has a slight edge over his class
mate. Like Price, these two players
lack weight. Ned Anderson, who plays
at either center or forward, is the
largest man from the 1927 squad. Al
though Anderson needs experience he
is learning the game fast and should
make a formidable bid for either a
forward place or the center job.
Jayred Good Center
Jayred plays exclusively at center.
He was considered last year to be
the best freshman center that has en
tered Stanford for several years. He
is an able substitute for Steele, and
with more coaching may even beat the
veteran out of his position at center.
other member of the 1927 fresh
men is "Mocco" Newhouse. Newhouse,
the corpulent standing guard, was
granted a leave of absence several
weeks ago. It is not known whether
he will be back in January for the
squad.
It hough the 1925 basketball team
will be primarily of new men it will
not be a weak quintet.

David has a slight edge over his class
mate. Like Price, these two players
lack weight. Ned Anderson, who plays
at either center or forward, is the
largest man from the 1927 squad. Al
though Anderson needs experience he
is learning the game fast and should
make a formidable bid for either a
forward place or the center job.
Jayred Good Center
Jayred plays exclusively at center.
He was considered last year to be
the best freshman center that has en
tered Stanford for several years. He
is an able substitute for Steele, and
with more coaching may even beat the
veteran out of his position at center.
other member of the 1927 fresh
men is "Mocco" Newhouse. Newhouse,
the corpulent standing guard, was
granted a leave of absence several
weeks ago. It is not known whether
he will be back in January for the
squad.
It hough the 1925 basketball team
will be primarily of new men it will
not be a weak quintet.
Material from last year's freshman
basketball five is expected to furnish
the foundation for a strong varsity
quintet this season.
Although a trifle inexperienced, the
'27 men individually possess ability
which can well be turned into first
class possibilities.
„ Game Called Off
The game with the Amblers Club at'
Stockton has been called off, due to l
the break it makes in the Christmas |
vacation, and because of the game i
with Notre Dame, most of the veteran |
basketball players being on the foot-|
ball squad.
The new men will be expected to
fill possibly one forward position,
either a center or guard position—
taking into consideration that Gurdon
Steele may be shifted from the center
position to the running guard berth —
and most of the reserve places.
Ted Shipkey Promising
Ted Shipkey, who will be busy at
football for the remainder of this
year, is an outstanding possibility for
a running guard, and might prove
capable enough to save Kerr the ne
cessity of shifting Steele from center.
Shipkey is fast and has the necessary
weight.
Fred Price, captain of the freshmen
last year, is a real find. Price is not
a big man, but his clever floor work
and his fight should secure him a posi
tion on this season's varsity. Running
guard in Price's natural place although
he has played forward until this year.
Nelson David and Harry Southworth
are the two best bets from the sopho
more class for the forward position
line. Both men are consistent, and
David has a slight edge over his class
mate. Like Price, these two players
lack weight. Ned Anderson, who plays
