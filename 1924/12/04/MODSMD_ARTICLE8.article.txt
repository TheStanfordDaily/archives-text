# HEART INTEREST TO DOMINATE IN "DULCY"
## Romance and Laughter Interwoven In Hilarious Comedy to Appear At Assembly Hall Saturday 
### 
WALL'S well that ends well," said our old friend Shakespeare one time, and
the ending of "Dulcy," the sophomore play to be presented in tne
Assembly hall Saturday night, seems to prove his theory. At least, it looks that
way, judging from this picture.
"Dulcy" is not only a screamingly funny comedy, but interwoven throughout
the play are the threads of three romances which will touch the heart of the
most incorrigible bachelor or maiden lady. The leading man and woman, por
trayed by Peggy Randall and Les Herth, go through a series of fortunate and
unfortunate occurrences which are enough to blast the marrjed happiness of
any young couple, but they come out smiling and happy in the end. When

adorable little Peggy sinks happily into the arms of handsome Les Herth, a
huge sigh of content will surge up from the audience on Saturday night.
Angela and Willie, played by Ruth Jordan and Len Schwartz, do a cave-man
elopement scene that is a wow. Willie sweeps Angela off her feet in a burst of
tempestuous wooing that will break all records for effectiveness. As is the way
with all women (so we are told) Angela resist just enough to make it very

interesting., but naturally capitulates *
when Willie really begins to do his
stuff.
Mrs. and Mr. Forbes, personified by
Kathreen Clock and Charles Simons,
are the storm centers of almost all
the trouble in the play, but manage
to wind up in each other's arms. Mrs.
Forbes is a flighty individual, with a
penchant for successful men, and with
a personality that makes everyone fall
in love with her. The old man is a
gruff, hard-headed, boorish sort of per
son with a streak of jealousy a mile
wide showing up whenever he catches]
his pretty little helpmate looking at
another man.
Humor and Tragedy Interwoven
"Dulcy" has a mixture of pathos and
bathos, humor and tragedy, ridiculous
ness and seriousness, which continues
throughout the whole three acts. Just 1
as hard luck follows on hard luck, and
all seems lost, laughs follow on laughs
and all is saved. A "crying jag" and a
"laughing jag" will be the inevitable
fate of everyone who ventures into the
Assembly hall next Saturday.
Seats are, still on sale at the Alumni j
Secretary's office in the Administra-j
tion building at 75 cents and $1 each.;
A cast dance will be given in the j
Women's Clubhouse immediately after,
the play, where the entire cast will
appear in street clothes in order to
give the public a treat.


Wn«[ couid &e sweeter than this? Everyone in somebody else's arms. But
don't judge too hastily, because this is only the final "clinch." Before this
tender scene was enacted, the three couples spent two hours of misery and
sadness. Left to right: Kathreen Clock, Charles Simons, Peggy Randall,
Les Herth, Ruth Jordan, Len Schwartz.

trayed by Peggy Randall and Les Herth, go through a series of fortunate and
unfortunate occurrences which are enough to blast the marrjed happiness of
any young couple, but they come out smiling and happy in the end. When

adorable little Peggy sinks happily into the arms of handsome Les Herth, a
huge sigh of content will surge up from the audience on Saturday night.
Angela and Willie, played by Ruth Jordan and Len Schwartz, do a cave-man
elopement scene that is a wow. Willie sweeps Angela off her feet in a burst of
tempestuous wooing that will break all records for effectiveness. As is the way
with all women (so we are told) Angela resist just enough to make it very

interesting., but naturally capitulates *
when Willie really begins to do his
stuff.
Mrs. and Mr. Forbes, personified by
Kathreen Clock and Charles Simons,
are the storm centers of almost all
the trouble in the play, but manage
to wind up in each other's arms. Mrs.
Forbes is a flighty individual, with a
penchant for successful men, and with
a personality that makes everyone fall
in love with her. The old man is a
gruff, hard-headed, boorish sort of per
son with a streak of jealousy a mile
wide showing up whenever he catches]
his pretty little helpmate looking at
another man.
Humor and Tragedy Interwoven
"Dulcy" has a mixture of pathos and
bathos, humor and tragedy, ridiculous
ness and seriousness, which continues
throughout the whole three acts. Just 1
as hard luck follows on hard luck, and
all seems lost, laughs follow on laughs
and all is saved. A "crying jag" and a
"laughing jag" will be the inevitable
fate of everyone who ventures into the
Assembly hall next Saturday.
Seats are, still on sale at the Alumni j
Secretary's office in the Administra-j
tion building at 75 cents and $1 each.;
A cast dance will be given in the j
Women's Clubhouse immediately after,
the play, where the entire cast will
appear in street clothes in order to
give the public a treat.


Wn«[ couid &e sweeter than this? Everyone in somebody else's arms. But
don't judge too hastily, because this is only the final "clinch." Before this
tender scene was enacted, the three couples spent two hours of misery and
sadness. Left to right: Kathreen Clock, Charles Simons, Peggy Randall,
Les Herth, Ruth Jordan, Len Schwartz.
WALL'S well that ends well," said our old friend Shakespeare one time, and
the ending of "Dulcy," the sophomore play to be presented in tne
Assembly hall Saturday night, seems to prove his theory. At least, it looks that
way, judging from this picture.
"Dulcy" is not only a screamingly funny comedy, but interwoven throughout
the play are the threads of three romances which will touch the heart of the
most incorrigible bachelor or maiden lady. The leading man and woman, por
trayed by Peggy Randall and Les Herth, go through a series of fortunate and
unfortunate occurrences which are enough to blast the marrjed happiness of
any young couple, but they come out smiling and happy in the end. When
