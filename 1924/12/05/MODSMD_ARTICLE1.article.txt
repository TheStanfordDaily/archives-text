# VARSITY WILL BEGIN PRACTICE FIRST OF WEEK
## Defeat of Notre Dame Would Add to Prestige of Cardinal Varsity 
### Dave Meiklejohn 
Football practice in preparation for
the Notre Dame game on New Year's
day will be resumed by the Stanford
football team Monday afternoon.
Warner has just sufficient time left
to work over his old plays and adopt
new ones which will meet the condi
tions of a game with Knute kockne's
eleven.
Stanford's great opportunity un
doubtly lies in a chance of defeating
the fast Eastern team. There is a
â–  chance. Warner knows there is a
chance and is not a bit afraid of the
impressive record made by Notre
Dame, a record which might easily dis
concert a less tried and experienced
coach.
Lawson Gains Prominence
Stanford ip fortimate in having a
few players who are really of
stopping Notre Dame. Jim Lawson,
for one, has suddenly sprung from All-
Coast end to an All-American possi
bility. Murray Cuddeback, after a
somewhat normal showing early in the
season, showed he possessed the ability
nvhich goes to make a really dangerous
half-back. It is possible that Warner
may begin by building most of his plays
around Cuddeback, providing an open
field attack is planned.
Ernie Nevers is expected to return
to the fold. Whether or not his ankles
will be in shape to withstand the gruel
ling grind of an entire game is a ques
tion that Warner, probably, would be
tickled to answer. However, until
Nevers' condition is absolutely assured
the Stanford coaches will be depending
more on Hey and Bogue for the full
back work.
Hey did some nice line bucking in
the California game, but, because of the
change in tactics he was not used quite
as often as had been Warner's custom.
The Cardinals will have to counter
act speed with speed. Admittedly the
Stanford backfield, if reports of Notre
Dame's record are at all reliable, is not
as fast as Rockne's secondary defense.
But the Cards looked fast enough in
the California game, due a great deal,
probably to the change in garb, substi
tuting lightness and sacrificing the pro
tection of heavy shoulder and pant
guards.
