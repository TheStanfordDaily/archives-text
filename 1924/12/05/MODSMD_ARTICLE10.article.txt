# CARD GOLFERS TO MEET CALIFORNIA BRASSY SWINGERS FOR ANNUAL PLAY
## FRESHMEN ARE BARRED Carter, Ditzler, and Lang Are Stanford's Best Bets for Victory 
### 
Stanford's golf varsity will make a
determined bid to regain prestige lost
in previous encounters when it tees
off in the annual tournament with
California at 9 o'clock tomorrow morn
ing at the Burlingame Country Club.
The Berkeleyites have had things
pretty much their own way in links
competition in previous years, but the
Cards will line up with an even chance
for victory.
Manager "Nick" Carter and Captain

Fritz Ditzler have selected the follow
ing team: Tom Condk, Charles Foye,
Harley Hubbard, Dick Lang, Ed
Quinn, "Nick" Carter, and Fritz Ditz
ler. These players will meet Califor
nia opponents in singles in the morn
ing, and six of them will be paired for
four-ball matches in the afternoon,
making a total of thirty-six holes for
the day.
Stanford Men Know Course
The Cardinal brassy swingers will
have the advantage of playing on what
is virtually their home course, as they
have been practicing three times a
week at Burlingame during the past
season. The majority of the Blue and


Mr. Leach, the self-styled "scenarist," is literally holding his audience in
the palm of his hand as he tells the story of his latest thriller. That is, every
one except Gordon Smith, who probably was up late last night. Old man
Forbes is still chewing his cigar, and the girls are all agog with Interest.
Left to right—Ruth Jordan, Peggy Randall, Kathreen Clock, John Wiggin,
Marvin Parks,/Len Schwartz, Charles Simons, Les Herth (asleep).
Gold contestants are unfamiliar with
these links. Offsetting this is the fact
that Carter will not be able to use
any freshmen, inasmuch as golf ranks'
as a first-class minor sport at Cali
fornia.
Stanford is one ok the few univer
sities where.the game is given only
second-class minor rating, under which
no distinction is made between fresh
men and upperclassmen in varsity
competition. A separate match be
tween first-year men of the two insti
tutions will probably be played in the
spring quarter.
Three Cards Veterans
Ditzler, Carter, and Lang are the
only veterans who will represent
Stanford tomorrow. Ditzler is per
haps the steadiest, but all three of
them play in the seventies when they
are at the top of their form. The
others were chosen on the basis of
their showing in University tourna
ments, and are consistent performers.
Lloyd Byerly, the find of last year's
freshman team, will not compete, as
he is not registered this quarter.

Gold contestants are unfamiliar with
these links. Offsetting this is the fact
that Carter will not be able to use
any freshmen, inasmuch as golf ranks'
as a first-class minor sport at Cali
fornia.
Stanford is one ok the few univer
sities where.the game is given only
second-class minor rating, under which
no distinction is made between fresh
men and upperclassmen in varsity
competition. A separate match be
tween first-year men of the two insti
tutions will probably be played in the
spring quarter.
Three Cards Veterans
Ditzler, Carter, and Lang are the
only veterans who will represent
Stanford tomorrow. Ditzler is per
haps the steadiest, but all three of
them play in the seventies when they
are at the top of their form. The
others were chosen on the basis of
their showing in University tourna
ments, and are consistent performers.
Lloyd Byerly, the find of last year's
freshman team, will not compete, as
he is not registered this quarter.
Stanford's golf varsity will make a
determined bid to regain prestige lost
in previous encounters when it tees
off in the annual tournament with
California at 9 o'clock tomorrow morn
ing at the Burlingame Country Club.
The Berkeleyites have had things
pretty much their own way in links
competition in previous years, but the
Cards will line up with an even chance
for victory.
Manager "Nick" Carter and Captain

Fritz Ditzler have selected the follow
ing team: Tom Condk, Charles Foye,
Harley Hubbard, Dick Lang, Ed
Quinn, "Nick" Carter, and Fritz Ditz
ler. These players will meet Califor
nia opponents in singles in the morn
ing, and six of them will be paired for
four-ball matches in the afternoon,
making a total of thirty-six holes for
the day.
Stanford Men Know Course
The Cardinal brassy swingers will
have the advantage of playing on what
is virtually their home course, as they
have been practicing three times a
week at Burlingame during the past
season. The majority of the Blue and


Mr. Leach, the self-styled "scenarist," is literally holding his audience in
the palm of his hand as he tells the story of his latest thriller. That is, every
one except Gordon Smith, who probably was up late last night. Old man
Forbes is still chewing his cigar, and the girls are all agog with Interest.
