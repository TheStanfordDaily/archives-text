### 
Stanford's golf varsity will make a
determined bid to regain prestige lost
in previous encounters when it tees
off in the annual tournament with
California at 9 o'clock tomorrow morn
ing at the Burlingame Country Club.
The Berkeleyites have had things

Manager "Nick" Carter and Captain

Fritz Ditzler have selected the follow
ing team: Tom Condk, Charles Foye,
Harley Hubbard, Dick Lang, Ed

making a total of thirty-six holes for
the day.
