Every need of the University per-;
taining to construction work, planting,
plumbing, anythiny and everything of
that nature, is placed under the care
of an unobstructive organization lo
cated at the Corporation Yards. Com
pletely equipped carpentry, electrical,
plumbing, blacksmithing, and automo
bile shops are all situated in the small
block which is the headquarters of |
this organization.
An average of two hundred men is
employed in the daily tasks such as
cleaning and planting work, and the
usual amount of construction work
takes some of these men.
Practically all the residences along
Alvarado street were built on the su
pervision of the Corporation Yards.
At present an addition to the Press
building is being made by men in the
employ of the Yards.
Two fully equipped and modern fire

trucks are housed there and the main
tenance of these is one of the tasks
for those in charge. Seventeen auto
trucks, two tractors, a steam roller,
and a dozen horses are all items in
the necessary paraphernalia. For the
upkeep of these, the machine foundry,
automobile shop, and blacksmith's
shop are essential.
Besides this active side, there is
the storeroom of University supplies
which contains almost everything in
the way of janitor's supplies and tools
for all sorts of work. Cement and
lumber are among the bulky com
modities stored away. The lumber
yard has wood in such varying sizes
and nature as to be able to meet at
a moment's notice any routine con
struction job that may come up.
The Corporation Yard also manages
a garage for forty automobiles of fac
ulty members and students.
