# DUNGAREES CHOSEN BY FRESHMEN FOR OFFICIAL GARMENT
## 
### 
Although the freshman class adopt
ed blue dungarees as their officiaV
wearing apparel at a meeting last
night, it remains to be seen how
many of the first-year men will blos
som out in blue pants. The resolu
tion was passed by a small margin
after a desperate fight on the part of
the men who believed such garments
would be belittling to freshman dig
nity.
The points advanced in favor of
this garb were that they would be
economical, democratic, and would
give the freshmen a mark of distinc
tion other than their traditional
"dinks." The one argument against
them was that at the best they are
not in the least becoming.
One argument in the favor, evi
dently overlooked, was that unlike the
"dinks," dungarees cannot be left
home. "Where a freshman goes his
dungarees must also go."
As a tribute to the work done by
the freshman football team the class
voted to purchase a silver cup in
scribed with the date and score of
the California game for every man
who participated in this contest.
