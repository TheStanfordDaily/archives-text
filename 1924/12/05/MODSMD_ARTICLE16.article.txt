# CURTAIN RISES AT 8:15 TOMORROW FOR 1927 PRESENTATION
## Humorous Situations Expected to Put "Dulcy" Among Successful Campus Stage Productions 
### 
Humor will be raised on a pedestal and worshipped tomorrow night
when the sophomore play, "Dulcy," is presented in the Assembly hall at 8:15.
A comedy of the first water, "Dulcy" is expected to prove one of the funniest
plays that campus theatregoers have seen in recent years.
Dulcy herself will attract most of the attention, with her charming
method of committing terrible mistakes l and her ingenuous way of atoning
for her sins. Peggy Randall is an exceptionally fine actress and will startle
those would-be critics who have said that there is a dearth of good actresses
in Stanford at the present time. Les Hertli, who plays opposite her in the
role of Gordon Smith, her husband, will bring to the Stanford stage a new

kind of leading man, and will show
Saturday night's audience the real way
to enact a love scene in a way that
seems to mean something.
Always one of the most interesting
plays of the season, for the fact that
it usually brings out new material for
Stanford dramatics, this year's sopho
more play is attracting more attention
than ever before because it follows
two plays which were extremely suc
cessful. Whether or not "Dulcy" will
keep up the good record remains to be
seen, but it is certain that nothing has
been left undone to make this last
play of the quarter hit the bull's eye
as the other two have done.
I
Real Comedy in Second Act
The heights of real comedy will be
reached in the second act, where the
movie "scenarist," played by Marvin
Park, tells the story of his latest
"brain-child" to an enraptured (??? —
see above picture) audience. Dulcy
has the happy faculty of making a
mess of everything she tries to do for
her husband, and the way in which
she entertains the visiting capitalist
who is going to help her husband in
business is the cause of some of the
funniest situations in the show.
There is only one set for "Dulcy,"
which will eliminate most of the tire
some waiting between acts. Arrange
ments are being made for musical se
lections to be played at these times,
which will help materially to make
the evening an enjoyable one. The
cast dance in the Women's Clubhouse
will commence immediately after the
show, and will last until 12 o'clock.

when the sophomore play, "Dulcy," is presented in the Assembly hall at 8:15.
A comedy of the first water, "Dulcy" is expected to prove one of the funniest
plays that campus theatregoers have seen in recent years.
Dulcy herself will attract most of the attention, with her charming
method of committing terrible mistakes l and her ingenuous way of atoning
for her sins. Peggy Randall is an exceptionally fine actress and will startle
those would-be critics who have said that there is a dearth of good actresses
in Stanford at the present time. Les Hertli, who plays opposite her in the
role of Gordon Smith, her husband, will bring to the Stanford stage a new

kind of leading man, and will show
Saturday night's audience the real way
to enact a love scene in a way that
seems to mean something.
Always one of the most interesting
plays of the season, for the fact that
it usually brings out new material for
Stanford dramatics, this year's sopho
more play is attracting more attention
than ever before because it follows
two plays which were extremely suc
cessful. Whether or not "Dulcy" will
keep up the good record remains to be
seen, but it is certain that nothing has
been left undone to make this last
play of the quarter hit the bull's eye
as the other two have done.
I
Real Comedy in Second Act
The heights of real comedy will be
reached in the second act, where the
movie "scenarist," played by Marvin
Park, tells the story of his latest
"brain-child" to an enraptured (??? —
see above picture) audience. Dulcy
has the happy faculty of making a
mess of everything she tries to do for
her husband, and the way in which
she entertains the visiting capitalist
who is going to help her husband in
business is the cause of some of the
funniest situations in the show.
There is only one set for "Dulcy,"
which will eliminate most of the tire
some waiting between acts. Arrange
ments are being made for musical se
lections to be played at these times,
which will help materially to make
the evening an enjoyable one. The
cast dance in the Women's Clubhouse
will commence immediately after the
show, and will last until 12 o'clock.
Humor will be raised on a pedestal and worshipped tomorrow night
when the sophomore play, "Dulcy," is presented in the Assembly hall at 8:15.
