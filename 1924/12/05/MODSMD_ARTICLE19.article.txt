# At Em, Sophomores
## 
### 
Tonight and tomorrow the campus will be entertained by the Class of
1927, acting for the first time in the role of host which will be an annual
function for its members until they graduate.
No Cotillion and Sophomore Play is ever as good as the Prom and
Junior Opera put on the following year by the same class. No Sophomore
Week-end—if it can be so styled—is ever as good as next year's Junior
Week. And with these two dress rehearsals, Senior Week eventually can
l>e carried off as a dignified and proper send-off for the graduating class.
But this is the maiden blush of 1927 in the way of entertainment, and
if the handling of their offerings so far can be taken as a forecast it will
be a successful program. The choice of "Dulcy" for the play seems ad
mirable, the play itself promises well, and the Cotillion management has
made no enemies.
Sophomores, the Daily wishes you fame and fortune. The campus
wants to be entertained, and we look to you.
