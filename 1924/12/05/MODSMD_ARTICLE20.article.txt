# On the Decay of Knowledge
## 
### 
The American University of today is overcrowded. In spite of more
exacting entrance requirements or the increased rate of football tickets,
an ever-growing number of our youth yearly flocks to the numerous and
local drinking fountains throughout the country to imbibe the life-giving
fluid of the waters of knowledge. They arrive hopeful, eager and earnest,
but the drinking fountain is so designed that soon the water tastes brackish
and before long has grown bitter.
They find it is not knowledge they have found, but an education, an
education reduced to a pattern and standardized to fit the democratic ideal.
Not only is it pointed out what they shall study, but how they shall study it.
Instead of being told "From these books you may read of theoretical gov
ernment ; in three months come and tell me what you have learned," they
are given in charge of a professor who has decided just what phases and
depth of this subject these boys should know and then offers it to them
in a tabloid form, like pre-digested food, calling this dose "Citizenship."
Does democracy then need a citizenry of mimeographic parrots? Dur
ing the students' first years free choice is almost wholly denied them, and
they become soft solder to be poured into a mediocre mould, spewed forth
at the end of four years as a "typical college man." And what does that
imply? Generally, that they are so many little mirrors reflecting the doc
trines thrust upon them and the social habits of the environment in which
they lived.
Those few fortunates are rare who emerge from this mill with the
mental depth and culture which association with books and men of learn
ing should imbue, and rare those men who find the knowledge they sought
instead of having a rubber-stamp education forced upon them. Their
problem is not easy. They must comply with the dictaphone system of
recitation and examination and still find time and mental energy to pursue
those themes which their originality and interest open for them. In any
thing but a strictly technical school, it is this man, the man of originality,
interest and initiative, that a college should favor.
But instead of this originality is regarded with suspicion, interest
dampened by regulation, and the whole system made a cathartic which
tends to purge the student of whatever initiative he may possess.â€”E. R. S.
