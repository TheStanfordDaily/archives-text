# CABBAGES and THINGS
## EARLY TRAINING 
### Hal John Snomis 
In response to numerous requests
from both our subscribers, Cabbages
herewith presents the training rules
to be followed by campus women who
are desirous of making the Varsity
Canoeing Squad. Spring schedules in
clude competition with Fraternity and
Hall men, with a big game against
Encina, so a large turnout is expected.
Tryouts will be held in the Roble
bath tub early next quarter. The loca
tion of this bathing device will be
revealed later.
Upon rising the candidate should
carefully brush her hair with a vigor
ous cylindrical motion, to practice re
moving the last vestiges of broken

hair nets. It would be well to indulge
in a mild setting-up exercise, such as
screaming. This will make even a
cave-man sit up.
What to eat is a serious question,
and for breakfast we feel confident
that the following menu will give ex
cellent results: One glass of clear cold
water, three peanuts and a pickle.
This will not only develop a svelte arm
motion, but will tend to accelerate the
growth of the finger-nails, a vital fac
tor in successful canoe defense.
After breakfast, the trainee should
indulge in a few moments of quiet
thought. For, after all, aren't we here
to think?
Luncheon should consist of very
simple foodstuffs, and should, not be
bulky. In fact, we would almost be

willing to state that the regular Union
lunch is enough for one meal. "While
eating, the candidate should keep her
mind on her canoe, using her knife
and fork as if they were paddles, or
weapons. No dinner. The candidate
must keep in her thoughts the fact
that she is in training for the highest
athletic honor that the Spring Quarter
brings. Anyone who will faithfully fol
low these simple rules is sure to make
the squad, provided only that she has
never been refused a position as ma
tron of Sing Sing prison.

canoeing varsity.
