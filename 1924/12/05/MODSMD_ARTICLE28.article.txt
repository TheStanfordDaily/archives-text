## 
### 
Playing a tricky passing game, the
sophomore hockey team pulled a 4-0
| victory over the hard-lighting fresh
men yesterday afternoon. The fresh
men, inexperienced at rushing the ball
in the striking circle and inadequately
supported from the half-hack line, put
up a good fight, and made the '27 team
fight for everything they got.
The sophomores showed unusual
team work and quick passing from the
back field forward. The first score was
made by Charlotte Lovekin, left wing,
who dribbled the ball down the alley,
passed the backs and goal-keeper with
a backhand stroke to the goal.
Dorothy Cone, left inside, and Fran
ces Clancy, center forward and captain
of the freshmen, carried the ball to the j
striking circle with a pretty series of ;
passes, but were unable to score.
The sophomores took the ball down
the field and Nellie Shepherd scored.
The iu>*t goal was made by Charlotte
Lovekin on a fumble by Carolyn Gross
man, freshman goal-keeper.
The freshmen rallied at the beginning
second half and sopho
mores from scoring again for more than

half the quarter hut the plays grew
ragged as the light failed. The fresh
men tried hard for a score, but were
unable to get the ball through Betty
Williams .sophomore goal-keeper.
Barbara Fenwick, right halfback,
made the last score for the sophomores

by hitting straight into the goal on a
recovery from a penalty corner,
