Decorations Completed
After three days of work by volun

the Cotillion were completed this af
ternoon, under the direction of
Charles Eckart. A Moorish motif pre
vails and the properties from the "Sea
Hawk" together with an especially
constructed Moorish arch will lend at
mosphere to the dance.
Jimmy Batcheldor's twelve-piece or
chestra from the University of Cali

will be seated on a platform elevated
above the heads of the dancers and
from the floor will be seen through
this arch of old Moorish architecture.
Refreshments at Encina
Refreshments will be served in the
Encina dining halls under the direc
tion of Miss Handy, director of dining
halls. Upon entering the pavilion,
each couple will be given a ticket
which he is to present upon being
served.
The dancers will be tfaken care of
in two sections: the first half will go
to Encina at 10:45 and the rest will
leave the. floor at 11:30.
If Jfrpiter Pluvius sees fit to send
showers to this vicinity tonight, com
plications will arise when it is time to
serve refreshments. Dean Grunland,
in charge of refreshments, plans to
have several busses close at hand to
transport the dancers to and from the
dining hall in case of necessity.
Mr. and Mrs. A. E. Roth, Dean and
Mrs. George B. Culver, Dean Mary
Yost, and Judge and Mrs. J. T. Nourse
have consented to chaperone the dance
according to the announcement of A1
Jergins, chairman of the chaperone
committee.
After the sophomores have weath
ered tonight's struggle, they will find
themselves scheduled for more danc
ing at the Clubhouse tomorrow after
noon. This inserted attraction should
keep the fire of sophomore enthusiasm
very much alive until the play and
Cast Dance in the evening.
