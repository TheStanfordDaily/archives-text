# FRESHMAN BASKET SQUADS TAKE DUAL VICTORY FROM 1926
## First Team Triumphs 20-15; Reserves Follow With 20-3 Final Score 
### Al Post 
Freshman hoop men rang up a dou
ble interclass victory over the juniors
yesterday afternoon in slow games
played at Encina gym. The first team
triumphed by a 20 to 15 score, while
the reserves overwhelmed the third
year players, 20 to 3.
The babe regulars took the lead at
the start and were never headed. As
in the contest against the sophomores,
Hunt substituted freely. Vincenti at
forward carried all before him and
showed himself a deadly shot. Haw
ley, at the opposite forward, also
played a good game.
Of the mob which got into the con
test at various times, the starting
combination of Guthrie at center,
Clark at running guard, and Young
at standing guard gave Vincenti and
Hawley the best support. The juniors
were much the heavier five, but they
were unable to get around the floor
