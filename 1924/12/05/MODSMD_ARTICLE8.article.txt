# FRESHMAN BASKET SQUADS TAKE DUAL VICTORY FROM 1926
## First Team Triumphs 20-15; Reserves Follow With 20-3 Final Score 
### Al Post 
Freshman hoop men rang up a dou
ble interclass victory over the juniors
yesterday afternoon in slow games
played at Encina gym. The first team
triumphed by a 20 to 15 score, while
the reserves overwhelmed the third
year players, 20 to 3.
The babe regulars took the lead at
the start and were never headed. As
in the contest against the sophomores,
Hunt substituted freely. Vincenti at
forward carried all before him and
showed himself a deadly shot. Haw
ley, at the opposite forward, also
played a good game.
Of the mob which got into the con
test at various times, the starting
combination of Guthrie at center,
Clark at running guard, and Young
at standing guard gave Vincenti and
Hawley the best support. The juniors
were much the heavier five, but they
were unable to get around the floor
fast enough to prevent the freshmen
from scoring frequently. "Mugs"
Mitchell was again the main cog in the
belated third-year attack, and he re
ceived first-class assistance from Car
ter at center.
Juniors Start Late
As in their encounter with the sen
iors, the '26 men did not get going
until the first period was about half
over. Although they had streaks of
working together they were inconsist
ent, and they never threatened to tie
the count. The half ended 11 to 0 in
favor of the freshmen.
The second frame witnessed im
provement in the juniors' play. They
scored nine markers, the same num
ber as their rivals, but lacked the
punch to cut down the babes' margin
of superiority.

Second Game Walkaway
The second game was a walkaway
for the freshmen from start to finish.
Hunt sent in an entire new team
every few, minutes, and the total
mounted with startling rapidity. The
juniors did not score until the final
minutes of play.
