# MISTAKES LACKING IN '27 PRODUCTION OF POPULAR PLAY
## Inexperienced Actors Carry Themselves Like Veterans in "Dulcy" Parts 
### Hal Rorke 
It is high time that something is
done about the dramatic situation
here at Stanford. For the present
condition to continue is unthinkable.
The sophomore play, "Dulcy," only
brought the point out more clearly
Saturday night.
For three whole acts the Daily rep
resentatives sat expectantly in their
complimentary seats, every minute on
the alert for critical material, and at
the final curtain every one of them
was forced to admit that he could
find nothing wrong with the show!
Now how can one write an inter
esting review with nothing at all to
crab about? It is right? Is it just?
Is it fair? It is just such situations as
this which account for the premature
baldness and the sour dispositions of
reviewers.

Not even Charles Simons, character
ized on the program as dramatic press
representative, was gracious enough
to make a few errors in acting the
part of C. Roger Forbes. Time and
again he made us laugh. He com
pletely gave himself away. He's a
good actor. He'll come to no good
end, that feUa. •
No Errors
And Velma Randall! After we had
banked on her for at least one mis
take —it was her first appearance, you
know —she turned out to be irrating
ly engaging all evening. As Dulcy,
Miss Randall hit off exceptionally
well, to the utter dismay of all who
had planned a nice night of unpleas
ant remarks.
In the role of Schuyler Van Dyck,
John Wiggin deported himself in an
outrageously amusing fashion. The
part is one which easily admits over
playing, and what should he do but
maintain a delicate restraint. All
riglit, all right. Only don't try to get
on the Daily staff, John Wiggin. We're
mad atcha.
Marvin Park, who played Vincent
Leach, is another problem. He was
undeniably good and try as one will,
there's nor worming out of having to
say so. One of the Daily Palo Alto
jury who lives in Hollywood left the
theater humming "Home, Sweet
Home" after seeing Park and what
greater tribute could an actor portray
ing a scenarist expect?
Keep Getting Better
Although Leonard Schwartz and
Kathreen Clock took care of their
parts adequately at first, they gath
ered momentum as the show prog
ressed and at the final curtain they
had all our friends on their side.
Schwartz played Willie Parker and
Miss Clock took the part of Mrs.
Forbes.
Angela Forber, acted by Ruth Jor
dan, held up her end of the comedy
convincingly, as did Leslie Hertli,
playing Gordon Smith ,the distracted
husband, and Lewis Andrews, as Tom
Sterrett, advertising engineer. If Miss
Jordan did hit an ungraceful posture
once in a while and if Herth lost his
confidence at times and if Andrews
failed once or twice to be the dis
agreeable go-getter he should have
been, there is no doubt that all three
are varsity material, needing only a'
little more experience. And they are
all sophomores! The outlook for fu
ture reviewers is certainly black.
Raymond Riese and Frank Feliz,
whose parts were not so prominent,
gave nothing to complain of playing
Attorney Blain Patterson and Henry
the butler, respectively. Feliz' man
ner had a disarming touch. The slow,
deliberate way in which he went about
his duties smacked strongly of the
dear old college life. He buttled ex
actly as though an upperclassman had
asked him to do it in a hurry; —
easily, with dignity, without upsetting
haste. Very touching.
Presentations Improving
After having seen the quality of
amateur acting in the Assembly hall
improve steadily for over four years,
one is forced to the conclusion that
Coach Gordon Davis may have some
thing to do with it. Although the
choice of "Dulcy" was fortunate, the
material has varied little. Yet plays
have improved enormously. Irreverent
as the idea is, one is led to believe
Mr. Davis is at the bottom of this
improvement. And unless something
is done to relieve this reviewing sit
uation, one can only think that he is
behaving this way deliberately. Sad!
Sad indeed, for we were such friends
formerly.
Chrysella Dunker's scenic design
practically surpassed the publicity
promises. It would be a pleasure to
live in the rooms she designed. That
she could give away the idea instead
of charging some millionaire a round
sum for it is almost inconceivable. It
took the lights amazingly well.
All in all, it would have been a very
enjoyable evening if one hadn't had
to criticize. Something HAS to be
done.

she could give away the idea instead
of charging some millionaire a round
sum for it is almost inconceivable. It
took the lights amazingly well.
All in all, it would have been a very
enjoyable evening if one hadn't had
to criticize. Something HAS to be
done.
It is high time that something is
done about the dramatic situation
here at Stanford. For the present
condition to continue is unthinkable.
The sophomore play, "Dulcy," only
brought the point out more clearly
Saturday night.
For three whole acts the Daily rep
resentatives sat expectantly in their
complimentary seats, every minute on
the alert for critical material, and at
the final curtain every one of them
was forced to admit that he could
find nothing wrong with the show!
Now how can one write an inter
esting review with nothing at all to
crab about? It is right? Is it just?
Is it fair? It is just such situations as
this which account for the premature
baldness and the sour dispositions of
reviewers.

Not even Charles Simons, character
ized on the program as dramatic press
representative, was gracious enough
to make a few errors in acting the
part of C. Roger Forbes. Time and
again he made us laugh. He com
pletely gave himself away. He's a
good actor. He'll come to no good
end, that feUa. •
No Errors
And Velma Randall! After we had
banked on her for at least one mis
take —it was her first appearance, you
know —she turned out to be irrating
ly engaging all evening. As Dulcy,
Miss Randall hit off exceptionally
well, to the utter dismay of all who
had planned a nice night of unpleas
ant remarks.
In the role of Schuyler Van Dyck,
John Wiggin deported himself in an
outrageously amusing fashion. The
part is one which easily admits over
playing, and what should he do but
maintain a delicate restraint. All
riglit, all right. Only don't try to get
on the Daily staff, John Wiggin. We're
mad atcha.
Marvin Park, who played Vincent
Leach, is another problem. He was
undeniably good and try as one will,
there's nor worming out of having to
say so. One of the Daily Palo Alto
jury who lives in Hollywood left the
theater humming "Home, Sweet
Home" after seeing Park and what
greater tribute could an actor portray
ing a scenarist expect?
Keep Getting Better
Although Leonard Schwartz and
Kathreen Clock took care of their
parts adequately at first, they gath
ered momentum as the show prog
ressed and at the final curtain they
had all our friends on their side.
Schwartz played Willie Parker and
Miss Clock took the part of Mrs.
Forbes.
Angela Forber, acted by Ruth Jor
dan, held up her end of the comedy
convincingly, as did Leslie Hertli,
playing Gordon Smith ,the distracted
husband, and Lewis Andrews, as Tom
Sterrett, advertising engineer. If Miss
Jordan did hit an ungraceful posture
once in a while and if Herth lost his
confidence at times and if Andrews
failed once or twice to be the dis
agreeable go-getter he should have
been, there is no doubt that all three
are varsity material, needing only a'
little more experience. And they are
all sophomores! The outlook for fu
ture reviewers is certainly black.
Raymond Riese and Frank Feliz,
whose parts were not so prominent,
gave nothing to complain of playing
Attorney Blain Patterson and Henry
the butler, respectively. Feliz' man
ner had a disarming touch. The slow,
deliberate way in which he went about
his duties smacked strongly of the
dear old college life. He buttled ex
actly as though an upperclassman had
asked him to do it in a hurry; —
easily, with dignity, without upsetting
haste. Very touching.
Presentations Improving
After having seen the quality of
amateur acting in the Assembly hall
improve steadily for over four years,
one is forced to the conclusion that
Coach Gordon Davis may have some
thing to do with it. Although the
choice of "Dulcy" was fortunate, the
material has varied little. Yet plays
have improved enormously. Irreverent
as the idea is, one is led to believe
Mr. Davis is at the bottom of this
improvement. And unless something
is done to relieve this reviewing sit
uation, one can only think that he is
behaving this way deliberately. Sad!
Sad indeed, for we were such friends
formerly.
Chrysella Dunker's scenic design
practically surpassed the publicity
promises. It would be a pleasure to
live in the rooms she designed. That
she could give away the idea instead
of charging some millionaire a round

Sad indeed, for we were such friends
formerly.
Chrysella Dunker's scenic design
practically surpassed the publicity
promises. It would be a pleasure to
live in the rooms she designed. That
she could give away the idea instead
of charging some millionaire a round
sum for it is almost inconceivable. It
took the lights amazingly well.
All in all, it would have been a very
enjoyable evening if one hadn't had
to criticize. Something HAS to be
done.
It is high time that something is
done about the dramatic situation
here at Stanford. For the present
condition to continue is unthinkable.
The sophomore play, "Dulcy," only
brought the point out more clearly
Saturday night.
For three whole acts the Daily rep
resentatives sat expectantly in their
complimentary seats, every minute on
the alert for critical material, and at
the final curtain every one of them
was forced to admit that he could
find nothing wrong with the show!
Now how can one write an inter
esting review with nothing at all to
crab about? It is right? Is it just?
Is it fair? It is just such situations as
this which account for the premature
baldness and the sour dispositions of
reviewers.

Not even Charles Simons, character
ized on the program as dramatic press
representative, was gracious enough
to make a few errors in acting the
part of C. Roger Forbes. Time and
again he made us laugh. He com
pletely gave himself away. He's a
good actor. He'll come to no good
end, that feUa. •
No Errors
And Velma Randall! After we had
banked on her for at least one mis
take —it was her first appearance, you
know —she turned out to be irrating
ly engaging all evening. As Dulcy,
Miss Randall hit off exceptionally
well, to the utter dismay of all who
had planned a nice night of unpleas
ant remarks.
In the role of Schuyler Van Dyck,
John Wiggin deported himself in an
outrageously amusing fashion. The
part is one which easily admits over
playing, and what should he do but
maintain a delicate restraint. All
riglit, all right. Only don't try to get
on the Daily staff, John Wiggin. We're
mad atcha.
Marvin Park, who played Vincent
Leach, is another problem. He was
undeniably good and try as one will,
there's nor worming out of having to
say so. One of the Daily Palo Alto
jury who lives in Hollywood left the
theater humming "Home, Sweet
Home" after seeing Park and what
greater tribute could an actor portray
ing a scenarist expect?
Keep Getting Better
Although Leonard Schwartz and
Kathreen Clock took care of their
parts adequately at first, they gath
ered momentum as the show prog
ressed and at the final curtain they
had all our friends on their side.
Schwartz played Willie Parker and
Miss Clock took the part of Mrs.
Forbes.
Angela Forber, acted by Ruth Jor
dan, held up her end of the comedy
convincingly, as did Leslie Hertli,
playing Gordon Smith ,the distracted
husband, and Lewis Andrews, as Tom
Sterrett, advertising engineer. If Miss
Jordan did hit an ungraceful posture
once in a while and if Herth lost his
confidence at times and if Andrews
failed once or twice to be the dis
agreeable go-getter he should have
been, there is no doubt that all three
are varsity material, needing only a'
little more experience. And they are
all sophomores! The outlook for fu
ture reviewers is certainly black.
Raymond Riese and Frank Feliz,
whose parts were not so prominent,
gave nothing to complain of playing
Attorney Blain Patterson and Henry
the butler, respectively. Feliz' man
ner had a disarming touch. The slow,
deliberate way in which he went about
his duties smacked strongly of the
dear old college life. He buttled ex
actly as though an upperclassman had
asked him to do it in a hurry; —
easily, with dignity, without upsetting
haste. Very touching.
Presentations Improving
After having seen the quality of
amateur acting in the Assembly hall
improve steadily for over four years,
one is forced to the conclusion that
Coach Gordon Davis may have some
thing to do with it. Although the
choice of "Dulcy" was fortunate, the
material has varied little. Yet plays
have improved enormously. Irreverent
as the idea is, one is led to believe
Mr. Davis is at the bottom of this
improvement. And unless something
is done to relieve this reviewing sit
uation, one can only think that he is
behaving this way deliberately. Sad!
