# GAUTHIER SHOCKS AUDIENCE
## Singer Introduces Jazz to Concert Hall In Historic New York Recital 
### Katherine Capell 
Eva Gauthier, who will sing in the
Assembly hall Thursday evening,
shocked concert-goers two years ago
when she daringly introduced Ameri
can jazz to the sedate atmosphere of
the concert hall.
Her singing of "Alexander's Ilag-|
time Band" was an historic event, ac
cording to Deems Taylor, New York
music critic, who defended the righti
of jazz to hold up its head in such com
pany as Miss Gauthier dragged it into,
and to take its place in true Ameri
can rhythm.
"It is folk music if ever any music
was, and I don't see why the mere
fact that its composers are alive
should bar it from respectable so
ciety," Taylor declared. "If a singer
can put a negro spiritual like 'Didn't
It Rain' on a Carnegie hall program
without being mobbed by the pundits,
if Mr. Lauri-Volpi can sing an Italian
jazz tune like 'Donna e Mobile' at the
Metropolitan and be solemnly ap
praised by the critics, why shouldn't
someone sing 'Carolina in the Morn
ing,' music that is just as sincere, just
as good, and just as profound as the
other two?"

First in her repertoire of contem
porary song, came "Alexander's Rag
time Band," by Irving Berlin, the
father of all American jazz. Next
came the "Siren's Song," by Jerome
Kern, with words by P. G. Wodehouse,
from the musical play, "Leave It to
Jane."
Then she sang Walter Donaldson's
i "Carolina in the Morning," words by
I Gus Kahn, and George Gershwin's
"I'll Build a Stairway to Paradise"
from George White's "Scandal's," the
! words by B. G. De Sylvia and Arthur
Francis. Another was by Gershwin
in collaboration with William M. Daly,
"Innocent Ingenue Baby" from the mu
j sical comedy, "Our Nell."
Miss Gauthier sang these numbers
straight, without any of the usual con
versational lapses and vocal tricks by
which a professional nnisical comedy
or cabaret performer puts over jazz.
The audience, according to critics,
found it was music they did not have
to think about, or intellectualize over,
or take solemnly. All they had to do
was "to listen, which was easy, and en
joy it. â€”which was unavoidable," as
i Taylor said.
