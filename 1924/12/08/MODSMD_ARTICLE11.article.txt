# JORDAN PEACE PLAN WINS $25,000
## CHANCELLOR EMERITUS OF STANFORD RECEIVES PRIZE Judges Choose His Recommendations From Thousands That Are Considered 
### 
Dr. Jordan, chancellor emeritus of Stanford, was awarded yesterday a
prize of $25,000 by Raphael Herman of Washington, D. C., for presenting
the best educational plan calculated to ensure world peace.
The paper was written during the summer, submitted to the contest
judges, and then was dismissed from Dr. Jordan's mind. The first intimation

that he had received the frrize came to him this morning from the San Fran
cisco papers. Announcement of the award, according to press reports, was
made yesterday by Augustus O. Thomas, commissioner of education of Maine,
and president of the World Federation of Education associations.

The supervision of the contest and
the choice of the winner was the duty
of this committee. It is said that
thousands of plans were received for
consideration.
When questioned regarding the dis
position of the money, Dr. Jordan
merely stated, "I have not received
it yet." Dr. Jordan has done more
writing this year than any previous
one with the exception of the year
during which he wrote his autobigro
phy, "The Days of a Man."
Dr. Wilbur expresses his pleasure
in the following manner: "I am de
lighted to hear that Dr. Jordan has
received this recognition for his long
years of splendid service."
Plan Totals 6,000 Words
The underlying substance of the
winning plan, which totals, approxi
mately 6,000 words, is a recommenda
tion that the World Federation "make
extensive studies of certain matters
pertinent to world amity through the
continuous operation of appropriate
committees on education for peace,
these to report at stated meetings to
the federation and to the various na
tional organizations corresponding to
and including our own National Edu
cational Association, indicating at the
same time lines of action likely to
contribute towards international
peace. Meanwhile, however, one must
admit that any specified procedure
can be at the most only a step to
wards the development of enlightened
public opinion and cooperation in ef
fecting mutual understandings among
people."

The supervision of the contest and
the choice of the winner was the duty
of this committee. It is said that
thousands of plans were received for
consideration.
When questioned regarding the dis
position of the money, Dr. Jordan
merely stated, "I have not received
it yet." Dr. Jordan has done more
writing this year than any previous
one with the exception of the year
during which he wrote his autobigro
phy, "The Days of a Man."
Dr. Wilbur expresses his pleasure
in the following manner: "I am de
lighted to hear that Dr. Jordan has
received this recognition for his long
years of splendid service."
Plan Totals 6,000 Words
The underlying substance of the
winning plan, which totals, approxi
mately 6,000 words, is a recommenda
tion that the World Federation "make
extensive studies of certain matters
pertinent to world amity through the
continuous operation of appropriate
committees on education for peace,
these to report at stated meetings to
the federation and to the various na
tional organizations corresponding to
and including our own National Edu
cational Association, indicating at the
same time lines of action likely to
contribute towards international
peace. Meanwhile, however, one must
admit that any specified procedure
can be at the most only a step to
wards the development of enlightened
public opinion and cooperation in ef
fecting mutual understandings among
people."

Emeritus of Stanford Uni
