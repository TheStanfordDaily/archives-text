# MOORISH COTILLION HIGH LIGHT OF '27 SOCIAL WEEK-END
## 
### 
An air of Old Morocco!
A bazaar which might have been
transported from the streets of Bag
dad, in which sat two turbanned
moslems in real native costume, was
the most novel feature of the deco
rations at the sophomore Cotillion.
At one end of the pavilion Jimmy
Batcheldor's twelve-piece orchestra
played under a Moorish arch.
Max Dolin, leader of the California
orchestra, and his accompanish, were
guests of honor and Dolin played a
solo.
Rapid transit busses transported the
mob to Encina for dinner. The busses
proved quite a successful innovation.
One-half the revelers dined at 10:45,
and the remained at 11:30.
The Tea Dansant, held in the Wo
men's Clubhouse on Saturday after
noon, was the second big attraction
of the sophomore week-end. The
dance was well attended, and Tyroler
furnished some knockout music.
