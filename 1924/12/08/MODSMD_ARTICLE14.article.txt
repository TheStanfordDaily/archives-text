A wave of dishonesty seems to be sweeping over the campus. Sev
eral automobiles have been stolen, checks have been actually forged, spare
tires disappear, notebooks are lost but not found, and property rights in
general seem at low ebb so far as their recognition is concerned.
The Daily is reluctant to believe that the automobile thievery is the
work of Stanford men. The other charges prove conclusively that there
are those among us whose presence should be speedily removed. ,It is no
situation to be dealt with mercifully—there is the choice of the old Stan
ford or a new and ghastly regime of petty and serious banditry. None of
us want the latter.
Of course, this situation leaves ninety-nine out of every hundred
students untouched. But there is a possibility of dishonesty—accidental,
not intentional—for all of us at this time in the quarter.
Be careful, when you pack up and sail thankfully for home, to leave
enough money in the bank to cover the checks you have written. Most
tradesmen who are accustomed to students suspend their check privileges
a week or so before the end of the quarter for exactly this reason, but this
precaution should not be necessary. Checks left to stand alone after losing
their balance in the bank are not "bad." They are negligent. Invariably
they are covered when the student returns, but they are a source of incon
venience and irritation and they leave a bad taste.
A check without a deposit is a poor Chrsitmas card to leave in any
body's hands. It puts you in a wrong light, and drags the University in
with you. The bank will help you protect yourself against a mistake of
this kind if you give it a chance. A little auditing will save a lot of
awkwardness.
