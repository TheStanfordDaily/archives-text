Word conies that a little more than half the Freshman Class wants to
wear blue dungarees, while a little less than half of the class doesn't. So
the entire masculine 1928 will wear them—maybe.
It doesn't greatly matter. The dungareed frosh will be an unsightly
but serviceable object, and handsome is as handsome studies. One thing
is important—a uniform should be a uniform if it is adopted for that pur
pose, and unless the adherents to the genteel trouser can be argued into
the inexpensive blue canvas the class would do well to forget the whole
controversy and wear what they personally please. Which probably is
just the way it will work out. The Daily ventures to opine that a dun
gareed frosh, within a couple of years, will be a rare sight.
The University is advancing, and the rough is gradually getting
smoother in his personal appearance. The atavistic dungaree, though
harmless and picturesque, is not likely to endure.

DUE TO the act that many of the Daily reporters plan to study for
their examinations, Wednesday's issue will be the last for this quarter.
Announcements and the like must therefore be brought in by 10 o'clock
Wednesday morning.

FIVE HUNDRED dollars was the price of a flask of whiskey at the
Big Game. It seems unjust to the unwealthy sufferers, who lost the result
of a summer's hard work. But breaking the law comes high, and the cost
seems due to increase rather than decline.
