# FOOTBALL PLAYER THROWS FARTHER THAN HE CAN KICK
## 
### 
John Levi, fullback on the Haskell
Indians eleven, and pupil of the fam
ous player, Jim Thorpe, can throw a
football farther than he can kick it.
On one occasion he heaved the pigskin
83 yards. He also has the distinction of
completing a forward pass that trav
eled 08 yards in the air.
Levi can stand on his own thirty
yard line and throw the ball over the
opponents' goal line, then it counts as
an incompleted pass over the line and
the ball is brought out to the twenty
yard line. Therefore, Levi's pass count
ed for as much yardage as a fifty-yard
punt.
The first liquid air machine to be
installed in the South is now in the
Chemistry department of the Univer
sity of Texas.
The University of Chicago intramu
ral department has introduced horse
shoes as a regular sport, and is con
ducting a tournament between the fra
ternities.
