# NEW YEAR'S GREETING
## 
### 
There must be some mistake about
these Notre Dame ticket prices. It's
all right if those $6 seats include over
night accommodations and bath, but
why don't they say so?
• • •
Tournament of Roses! "Tournament"
infers that the other guy at least has a
fighting chance. Six bucks is plain
banditry.
The Four Horsemen must have
something to do with it.
* * *
Knute forgets that Senator Stanford
was a great horse trainer.
* * *
When the last gun blows they'll be:
Charley Horse, Ofc Horse, Sorta
Horse and just plain Horsey.
* * *
This quarterback who Rockne says
was sent down from Heaven will think
he is where the other fallen angels went
when he sees the Cardinal all around
him. #
• • *
Harry wants to know who's Notre's
dame.
* * *
Notre Dame means "Our lady." Isn't
that emotionalizing athletics?
* * *
Willie has to be very careful how he
pronounces Notre Dame because he
won't get his gold watch if he swears
before he is 21.

Speaking of track records, there was
a good mark made in Africa yesterday
when an elephant stepped in the sand.

Have you ever heard of a comedy
making a person sad? Study French
comedies in the Romanic language de
partment.
