# BASKETBALL SQUAD CUT SATURDAY TO TWENTY-FOUR MEN
## 
### 
Twenty-four men survived the var
sity basketball cut that was made Sat
urday by Coach "Andy" Kerr. This
is the last time this quarter that the
squad will be thinned out.
The varsity is now composed of
Oliva (captain), Steele, Grace, H.
Shipkey, T. Shipkey, Nevers, Coen,
Middleton, Newhouse, Frazier, Harris,
Timmons, Alexander, Smith, Price,
Anderson, David, Southworth, Jayred,
Riese, Mitchell, Carter, Rice,
Hotchkiss.
Basketball practice will be held reg
ularly until December 28. The play
ers will then be given a rest with
practice starting again on January 2.
It was hoped that a game could be
scheduled during the holidays but, as
yet, no contest has been arranged.
In a scrimmage that was held last
Saturday, Rice and Alexander started
at forward, Jayred at center, and
Oliva and Mitchell played guards.
With the exception of Oliva this is a
brand new team. Both Mitchell and
Alexander were substitutes last gea
son. Price and Jayred came up from
the 1927 freshmen five. The men
worked well, although it is the first
time they have played together.

Steele, the varsity center from last
year, was not out over the week-end.
Jayred, who played in his position, was
in the game every minute of the time
and he gave a good account of him
self.
Two new men have been playing
well lately. Frazier and Timmons are
both out for forward places. Frazier
played at forward with Nevers on the
1926 team but was not out last year.
Timmons is a transfer from a south
ern college where he captained the
basketball quintet.
Nevers is still unable to do any
playing. Although his ankle is heal
ing, it is doubtful whether he will be
on the court before the middle of Jan
uary.
In practice Captain Dave Oliva is
woaring a steel brace on his knee. He
injured bis leg in the California series
last season, and it still troubles him
slightly. It should not keep him from
playing his best this year, and he is In
line for all-coast standing guard.

year, was not out over the week-end.
Jayred, who played in his position, was
in the game every minute of the time
and he gave a good account of him
self.
Two new men have been playing
well lately. Frazier and Timmons are
both out for forward places. Frazier
played at forward with Nevers on the
1926 team but was not out last year.
Timmons is a transfer from a south
ern college where he captained the
basketball quintet.
Nevers is still unable to do any
playing. Although his ankle is heal
ing, it is doubtful whether he will be
on the court before the middle of Jan
uary.
In practice Captain Dave Oliva is
woaring a steel brace on his knee. He
injured bis leg in the California series
last season, and it still troubles him
slightly. It should not keep him from
playing his best this year, and he is In
line for all-coast standing guard.
Twenty-four men survived the var
sity basketball cut that was made Sat
urday by Coach "Andy" Kerr. This
is the last time this quarter that the
squad will be thinned out.
The varsity is now composed of
Oliva (captain), Steele, Grace, H.
Shipkey, T. Shipkey, Nevers, Coen,
Middleton, Newhouse, Frazier, Harris,
Timmons, Alexander, Smith, Price,
Anderson, David, Southworth, Jayred,
Riese, Mitchell, Carter, Rice,
Hotchkiss.
Basketball practice will be held reg
ularly until December 28. The play
ers will then be given a rest with
practice starting again on January 2.
It was hoped that a game could be
scheduled during the holidays but, as
yet, no contest has been arranged.
In a scrimmage that was held last
Saturday, Rice and Alexander started
at forward, Jayred at center, and
Oliva and Mitchell played guards.
With the exception of Oliva this is a
brand new team. Both Mitchell and
Alexander were substitutes last gea
son. Price and Jayred came up from
the 1927 freshmen five. The men
worked well, although it is the first
time they have played together.

Steele, the varsity center from last
year, was not out over the week-end.
Jayred, who played in his position, was
in the game every minute of the time
and he gave a good account of him
self.
