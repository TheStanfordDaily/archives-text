dreams.'"

civilization," declared Professor Hyde.
"Christianity and womanhood are two
such dreams, Christianity as the love
of the LoTd with all our faith and
strength and our neighbors as our
selves, womanhood as the only force
capable of accomplishing certain re
forms today. Woman must not let
tolerance go so far as to become an
evil."
