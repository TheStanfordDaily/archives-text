# FIRST YEAR FIVE LOOMS STRONG IN EARLY WORKOUTS
## Coach Hunt Well Satisfied With Large Basketball Squad This Year 
### 
After a week of practice, the fresh
man basketball squad is gradually
working into shape and forecasts good
results. While there are no stars show
ing up so far, there is an abundance of
good material that can be worked up
into a team that should equal last
year's.
Coach "Husky" Hunt seems well
satisfied with the material and at pres
ent is spending most of the time in
looking it over and lining up the pros
pects.
Forty-five men are working out each
night of practice but so far no real
coaching has been done. At the begin
ning of next quarter Hunt will get the
squad to work and will probably divide
it into two groups.
There is a wealth of material for the
forward positions. Vincenti and Haw
ley seem to work well together and have
shown up very well in recent practice.
Cook and Nye have been constantly
replacing them in practice games but
there has been little preference shown.
The Moore brothers form a fast com
bination at forward and are good pros
pects.
In the pivot position there are a half
dozen good jumpers. Guthrie and Den
nis seem about on a par and have been
holding down the center position most
of the time. Rupe, Harlow, Canfield,
and Dyer have all been going good at
this position and this early in the sea
son rate little lower than Guthrie or
Dennis.
Clark and Young, at guards, make a
good combination and form a strong de
fense. Shooting ability among the
guards is one of the squad's outstand
ing points, at times the defense opens
up and beautiful long shots slide
through the hoop. Reynolds, Sauter,
Crist, and McMurray have been doing
some good defensive work and make
any distinct preference impossible.
