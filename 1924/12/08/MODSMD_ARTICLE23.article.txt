# MISSIONARY'S WORK IN CHINA SUBJECT OF REV. W.O. PYE'S TALK
## 
### 
"The work of the missionary in
China is the training of the native
Chinese for teachers, pastors and
leaders," said the Rev. Ppe in his talk
in the Memorial Church Sunday
morning.
According to the Rev. Pye, when a
missionary enters a new country he
must first learn the locations of the
cities and towns in the vicinity and
judge them from the standpoint of
future bases of operation. Next he
must ascertain the resources of the
country and the occupations of the
people, for the value of the work de
pends upon the ability of the people
to support it. After he is located his
area takes in a territory about forty
miles square. Then he must begin
the work of introducing Christianity,
to the natives.
The work is done as much as pos
sible through the Chinese Christian
teachers. The missionary selects two
of the most tactful Chinese preachers
and sends them into a new town.
They work quietly and unobstrusively
and endeavor to get acquainted with
the leading citizens of the town.
These men, usually, are educated, be
ing followers of Confucius. Confucius
was the sponsor of a code of morals
but he was not a religionist as he had
no conception of a spiritual God.
When Christianity is gradually ex
plained to these educated men they
begin to seo the relation between
Jesus and Confucius. What Confucius
could not understand and teach Jesus
could. The teachers seek to give a
fuller, richer understanding of the re
ligion.
The less intellectual people have
their suspicions allayed when they see
their own leaders sponsoring the re
ligion.
"The great burden of the work must
be carried on by the Chinese mission
aries themselves," said the Rev. Pye.
"We regard the chief object of our
work as being the discovery of mate
rial for leadership, and not the estab
lishment of churches, because the
churches are only bases of operation."
The work is still in its infancy. Cen
tral Asia is yet untouched and there
are large areas in China where the
missionary has not penetrated.

"The great burden of the work must
be carried on by the Chinese mission
aries themselves," said the Rev. Pye.
"We regard the chief object of our
work as being the discovery of mate
rial for leadership, and not the estab
lishment of churches, because the
churches are only bases of operation."
The work is still in its infancy. Cen
tral Asia is yet untouched and there
are large areas in China where the
missionary has not penetrated.
