# Big Football Scores Give Cause of Worry to Tonsorial Artists
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity football team al
most caused a business failure in Palo
Alto this fall, just because the boys
were so eager to score touchdowns, ac
cording to Ted Housh of the Block "S"
barber shop.
The Block "S" shop foolishly prom
ised, in a momentary burst of patriotism
and loyalty to Stanford men and their
beards, to give a free haircut to any
man on the varsity who • secured a
touchdown or blocked a kick during the
season. Housh was the originator of
the bright idea, which has caused much
weeping and wailing, and nashing of
scissors among the razor-wielders ever
since.
A little matter of some twenty-five
touchdowns is all the Block U S" has had
to consider, but it has kept the two
bosses, Ted and Louis, cutting hair
overtime since the Big Game.
And now the tonsorial artists are
wondering if the Notre Dame game
will force them to take out bankruptcy
papers.
