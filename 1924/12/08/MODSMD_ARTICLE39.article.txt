The store carries cookies, candies,
and fruit. Fresh upplies will be ordered
from the Union daily, and special'orders
for parties can be handled. Stanford
jewelry, such as is now on display at
the Union store, is for sale. In addition,
Gertrude Heineman and Katherine Ap

special agencies from time to time.
For the rest of the quarter the store
will be open an hour after lunch and an
hour after dinner. Next quarter it will
be kept open during the morning.
Student government at the Univer
sity of Colorado will be investigated
as a result of the charge that the
faculty is dominating student activi
ties.
