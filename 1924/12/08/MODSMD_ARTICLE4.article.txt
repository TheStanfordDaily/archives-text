# STANFORD TEAM IS NAMED FOR OXFORD DEBATE IN JANUARY
## Littler, Weigel, and Lewis Chosen After Tryouts Friday Afternoon 
### 
Robert Littler, Stanley Weigel, and
Robert Lewis were chosen after try
outs in the Little theater for the Stan
ford debating team which will meet Ox
ford on January 22. Ronald Button
and John Dunnivvay were named as
alternates.
All five men are seasoned speakers
who are competent to put up a stiff re
sistance to the arguments of the Brit
ishers Littler won the Joffre medal
last year and made an excellent show
ing in the no-decision Triangular de
bate last month, in addition to partici
pating in a number of other varsity
contests.
Weigel walked off with the honors in
the Pacific Coast extemporaneous
speaking contest held in the Assembly
hall Wednesday. He is a past master
of the informal style which is used so
extensively by the Oxford debaters.
Lewis has competed with success in
two Tri-state debates as well as in this
year's Triangular. Button and Dunni
way have had experience and should be
able to fill in as regulars if the need
should arise.
Twelve candidates tried for places on
the team, and each speaker showed so
well that the judges were given consid
erable difficulty in making their selec
tions. Dean Mary Yost, who was for
merly debating coach at Vassar, Pro
fessor Harold Shepherd of the Law
school, and William H. Davis, former
head of the Department of Public
Speaking at Bowdoin college, acted as
judges.
The Oxford team is composed of
Malcolm McDonald, son of the former
British premier, J. Ramsay McDonald;
Christopher Hollis, and a third man yet
to be announced.
