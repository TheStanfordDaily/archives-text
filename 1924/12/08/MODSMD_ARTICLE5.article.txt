# Chappie Deadline for Cross Word Number Extends to Wednesday
## 
### 
The Old Boy paused long enough in
his hilarious efforts upstairs in the Press
building to stick his head out of the
window and broadcast to the world in
general that the deadline for Chaparral
copy has been extended to Wednesday.
As has been rumored, the issue, to ap
pear on the campus early next quarter,
will deal largely with the cross-word
curse which is so widespread. How
ever, good copy of any nature will not
be passed up.
The regular tea session of the staff
will not be held tomorrow.
