# CALIFORNIA GOLF MEN DEFEAT CARD VARSITY PLAYERS
## Bears' Greatest Experience Telling Factor in Their 23 to 4 Victory 
### Al Post 
Outclassed by more experienced op
ponents, Stanford's golf varsity lost to
California Saturday at the Burlingame
Country Club by a score of 23 to 4.
Dick Lang was the only Stanford
man to win his match in the singles,
taking two points from Thomas. Tom
Condit broke even with Bray of Cali
fornia, each contestant taking one
point. Charles Foye took one marker
from Nounan. In the four-ball matches
in the afternoon the Blue and Gold
played best ball and made a clean
sweep. Haight and Thomas were too
good for Ditzler and Lang, Tait and
Nounan vanquished Quinn and Foye,
and Stephens and Dalziel defeated Car
ter and Condit.
Lang's showing was the only bright
spot in the tourney for the Cards. Play
ing second on the list against a more
seasoned player, he shot a 75 in the
morning round, equalling the record of
Stanton Haight, captain and No. 1 man
for the Berkleyites. Lang negotiated
the first nine in 39 to tie with Thomas,
forged ahead with a brilliant par 36 on
the second nine, and won the match 3
and 2, taking two points by the victory.
Harold Sampson, professional at the
Burlingame club who is coaching the
Stanford squad, predicts a bright future
for Lang, who is now in his sophomore
year.
Ditzler Has Off Day.
Captain Fritz Ditzler had one of those
off days which come at times to the
best of players and failed to exhibit the
kind of golf of which he is normally
capable. He started off well, losing
the first nine by only one hole, but went
to pieces coming in. His opponent,
Haight, is easily the best golfer in any
California university with the excep
tion of Loren Upson of Berkeley, and
was at the top of his game Saturday.
Carter, also was not at his best and was
outclassed by Stephens of California,
who won 4 and 3.
Quinn was all square at the turn in
his contest with Tait, but lost the sec
ond nine and with it the match, giving
two points to the Bears. Condit put up
a strong fight to halve his contest with
Bray. Condit is playing his first year
on the varsity, and so should improve
greatly with a little more practice.
At California, golf ranks as a first
class minor sport and regulation circle
block letters are awarded players who

fornia, each contestant taking one
point. Charles Foye took one marker
from Nounan. In the four-ball matches
in the afternoon the Blue and Gold
played best ball and made a clean
sweep. Haight and Thomas were too
good for Ditzler and Lang, Tait and
Nounan vanquished Quinn and Foye,
and Stephens and Dalziel defeated Car
ter and Condit.
Lang's showing was the only bright
spot in the tourney for the Cards. Play
ing second on the list against a more
seasoned player, he shot a 75 in the
morning round, equalling the record of
Stanton Haight, captain and No. 1 man
for the Berkleyites. Lang negotiated
the first nine in 39 to tie with Thomas,
forged ahead with a brilliant par 36 on
the second nine, and won the match 3
and 2, taking two points by the victory.
Harold Sampson, professional at the
Burlingame club who is coaching the
Stanford squad, predicts a bright future
for Lang, who is now in his sophomore
year.
Ditzler Has Off Day.
Captain Fritz Ditzler had one of those
off days which come at times to the
best of players and failed to exhibit the
kind of golf of which he is normally
capable. He started off well, losing
the first nine by only one hole, but went
to pieces coming in. His opponent,
Haight, is easily the best golfer in any
California university with the excep
tion of Loren Upson of Berkeley, and
was at the top of his game Saturday.
Carter, also was not at his best and was
outclassed by Stephens of California,
who won 4 and 3.
Quinn was all square at the turn in
his contest with Tait, but lost the sec
ond nine and with it the match, giving
two points to the Bears. Condit put up
a strong fight to halve his contest with
Bray. Condit is playing his first year
on the varsity, and so should improve
greatly with a little more practice.
At California, golf ranks as a first
class minor sport and regulation circle
block letters are awarded players who
make the varsity.
Outclassed by more experienced op
ponents, Stanford's golf varsity lost to
California Saturday at the Burlingame
Country Club by a score of 23 to 4.
Dick Lang was the only Stanford
man to win his match in the singles,
taking two points from Thomas. Tom
Condit broke even with Bray of Cali
fornia, each contestant taking one
point. Charles Foye took one marker
from Nounan. In the four-ball matches
