Following in the footsteps of "Dud"
De Groot, Fred Swan, Murray Cudde
back and other prominent Stanford
men, Donald E. Liebendorfer, former
editor of the Daily Palo Alto, has de
cided to plunge himself over the fateful
brink of matrimony. But, having the
journalistic instinct Liebendorfer has
decided to play fair by his former pub
lication, and so he is announcing his
engagement to Miss Dorothy Wilson,
before some reporter accidentally runs
onto the story weeks after the marriage
has been solemnized.
Miss Wilson was a Chi Omega at
Stanford and she graduated with the
class of 1923. At present she is teach
ing at Paso Robles. The engagement
was first announced at her home in
Yorba Linda on November 30, and
simultaneously at the Chi Omega house
and Breakers club Friday evening. The
marriage will not take place for some
time since Liebendorfer will not com
plete his course at Stanford until win
ter q-uarter.
