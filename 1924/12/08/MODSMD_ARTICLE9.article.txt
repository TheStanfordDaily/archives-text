# TRYOUTS THIS WEEK WILL SELECT CASTS OF TWO PRODUCTIONS
## Gordon Davis Will Present Macbeth, "You and I," After Christmas 
### 
The success of dramatics at Stan
ford has made it necessary for Gordon
Davis to find a different method of con
ducting tryouts for future plays than
has been used in the past.
Tomorrow and Wednesday, he will
hold tryouts for "Macbeth" which will
be sponsored by the English club, and
"You and I," which will be given by
Masquers society. Everyone registered
in college, with the exception of fresh
men women, is eligible for these pro
ductions and those who try out will be
given parts in both plays to read. In
this manner, a tryoutee will have a
chance to secure a part either in one
show or the other.
No rehearsals will be held for either
production until after the Christmas
holidays, although complete casts will
be picked at these tryouts. Those who
secure parts will be given a script of
the play they are to appear in, from
which they can start learning their
lines.
Tryouts will be held tomorrow after
noon in the Assembly hall from 3 to 5,
and in the evening at the Little theater
from 7 to 9. Wednesday afternoon
from 3 to 5, and Wednesday evening
from 7 to 9, the tryouts will be held in
the Assembly hall.
"Macbeth" will be the first Shakes
pearian production to be attempted on
the campus for several years, and it is
expected to attract a good deal of in
terest.
