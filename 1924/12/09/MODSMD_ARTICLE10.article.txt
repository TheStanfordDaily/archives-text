# GAUTHIER PROGRAM WILL EMPHASIZE MODERN SONGS
## Javanese Folk Music Will Be Among Opening Numbers 
### 
On Thursday evening the first of
four concerts sponsored by the Pen
insula Musical Association will be
given, when Eva Gauthier, French-
Canadian mezzo-soprano, sings in the
Assembly hall.
Miss Gauthier, the daughter of a
distinguished astronomer, was sent to
Europe to study music by her uncle,
Sir Wilfred Gauthier, when, at an early
age, she gave promise of her talent.
She studied in Paris, toured England
with Mme. Emma Albini, and later
went to the Far East, where she lived
for some time.
Collected Folk Songs
In the Orient Miss Gauthier made a
collection of Javanese folk songs. The
program Thursday evening will open
with selections from this collection. A
number of French songs will follow,
including some which she has had re
produced for Victor records.
Jazz selections included on the pro
gram are a radical departure from the
usual repertoire of a concert singer.
Miss Gauthier, who is called by critics
"the high priestess of modern song,"
believes in not only the folk songs of
foreign nations, but also the "mod
ern American folk music"-*jazz. Her
interpretations of these pieces differ
from the usual rendition of jazz, in
that she uses no conversational lapses
or tricks of vocal phrasing to "put the
song over."
Tickets for the concert are on sale
at Crandall's in Palo Alto this week,
and will be obtainable at the box of
fice the night of the performance.
