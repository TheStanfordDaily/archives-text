## 
### 
Tryouts for a varsity debating squad
of ten men from which will be se
lected three teams, will be held im
mediately after the opening of school
in January, according to the announce
ment of Debating Advisor J. G. Emer
j son.
The teams thus chosen will meet
j Willamette University, Utah State
; College, and the Kansas Agricultural
j College. These three universities are
1 making tours through California in
the spring, and will debate Stanford
on the question of the Supreme Court
to declare laws of Congress unconsti
tutional. The subject for tryouts will
be the same.
Varsity Men Ineligible
No varsity men are eligible for the
squad, according to Professor Emer-!
son. All three debates will be for
men who have never represented
Stanford before.
"There have been many appearing
i in the regular tryouts," says Professor I
Emerson, "who have not quite been
able to make the teams in competi-:
| tion with regular varsity men. There-;
! fore we have scheduled these de
bates. They will rank as regular var-j
I sity contests and participants will be J
entitled to the regular varsity reward, i
Two units of credit in public speak-1
ing will be given for regular work on
. the squad."
Willamette Strongest
Willamette University is probably j
j the strongest of the three. Willamette
I is the smallest university in the Coast
; Forensic League, but has produced
• several nationally known debate
i teams. Utah State College meets the j
TTniversity of Southern California
every year and is rated by them as (
lone of their most formidable oppon-'
I ents. Kansas is less known on the i
coast, but comes highly recommended. I
i It is possible that a debate with TTni-i
versity of West Virginia may be add
• i ed to the list.
