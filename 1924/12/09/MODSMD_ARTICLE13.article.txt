Two Stanford Jim Lawson
and Harry Shipkey, were picked by
"Pop" Warner on his All-Coast football
team choices, printed in the San Fran
cisco Examiner today. Four other Cardi
nals were represented on the second
team. They were: Ted Shipkey, at end;
Geroge Baker, at center; Fred Swan, at
guard; and Cuddeback, at halfback.
Warner considered Shipkey the best
tackle on the coast and for his second
choice picked Norman Anderson of the
University of Southern California.
Of Lawson he said: "There were a
number of good ends, but none who
stood out very prominently above the
others with the exception of Lawson.
This man has not only every defensive
qualification for a good end, but is un
usually heavy and great on the offensive,
both in handling the ball and receiving
forward passes. He was the headiest
end on the coast.
Kelly of Montana, overlooked by sport
ing critics with an apology, was placed
on Warner's first team. Warner consid
ered Kelly "the best halfback on the
coast." Imlay of California was chosen
for the other first string berth.
Babe Horrell of California was made
All-Coast center.
Strader of St. Mary's was chosen for
first string fullback, and Tesreau of
Washington was put on the second team.
