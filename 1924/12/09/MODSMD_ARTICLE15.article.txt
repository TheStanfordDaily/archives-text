### 
Masquers' Society met at the Chi
Omega house yesterday afternoon to
consider revisions of the constitution.

In the past Masquers' has been con
sidered an honorary society, but the
constitution contains provisions which
are capable of such interpretation as
to permit the organization to become
more active. The document was there
fore given over to Helen Lewis and
Alice Dodds for revision on those
points.
