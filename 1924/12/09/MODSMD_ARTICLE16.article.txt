# FOUR STANFORD DELEGATES GO TO COAST MEET
## U. S. C. TO BE DISCUSSED Santa Clara, St. Mary's, and Nevada Seek Admission Into Conference 
### Harry Bennett 
Four Stanford representatives left
yesterday evening to attend the an
nual meeting of the Pacific Coast Con
ference at Portland. They were: Paul
Davis, graduate manager; Professor
Cottrell, Dr. Barrow, and Andy Kerr.
The meeting in Portland will last
from December 11 to December 13.
This is considered one of the most
important sessions that has ever been
held on the coast, taking in considera
tion the U. S. C.-Stanford-California
controversy, and the likelihood of add
ing new members to the conference.
Nevada May Enter
St. Mary's and Santa Clara will
both try hard to be admitted to the
Coast body, but it is unlikely that the
representatives will consider either
college before the University of Ne
vada, which has made a stronger
showing, all in all, than have the
latter universitfes. Of course St.
Mary's has a bid to the post because
of the U. S. C. victory, but Nevada
has made the most consistent show
ing.
Stanford may be unwilling to stage
a game with St. Mary's college, and
if the Cardinal council prevails, it is
likely Nevada will be put once more
on the Cardinal schedule for 1925,
whether or not the Sagehens make the
conference.
Just how the University of Southern
California will emerge from the con
clave is hard to say. There are four
universities which are more or less
against the Trojans. These four are at
present the strongest in the confer
ence and it is thought that the council
of the four will prevail, either for
better or worse.
The official Stanford representative
will be Dr. Barrow, Professor Cottrell
and i\ndy Kerr will act merely in an
advisory capacity, and Paul Davis will
attend a joint meeting of the confer
ence graduate managers.
