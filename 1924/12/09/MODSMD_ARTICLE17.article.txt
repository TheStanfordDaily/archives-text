Bannister's lecture at 7:30 tonight in
the Assembly hall.
Bannister intends to give something
of the history of the negotiation of
this interstate compact and the cere
mony attending its final execution at
Santa Fe. He will also state the terms
of the compact and indicate the ad
vantages which will follow from the
ratification of it by the seven states
involved by Congress.
"In the treatment of the subject,"
says Bannister, "I shall develop to a
certain extent the physical and hydro
graphic data of the river, its potential
irrigation and liydro-electric service,
touching in an elementary way the
fundamental principles of the two sys
tems of water law known to America;
and consider the principles of law to
be involved in dividing the use of
water among states which border upon
the same interstate stream."
In Bannister's opinion the Colorado
River Compact is the most ambitious
interstate agreement attempted since
the adoption of the Federal Constitu
tion.
Bannister is a Stanford graduate of
the class of '93 and is at present prac
tising law in Denver. He is also pres
ident of the Denver Chamber of Com
