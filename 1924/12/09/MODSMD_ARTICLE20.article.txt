The campus rejoices with Dr. Jordan in the latest recognition of his
citizenship of the world—the winning of Raphael Herman's prize for the
best educational plan calculated to ensure world peace.
Dr. Jordan has during his life been vitally interested in a number of
things, and has attained a world-wide success in many lines. He was the
man who developed Stanford University, and working at first with Sena
tor and Mrs. Stanford and afterward alone he brought the Stanford Farm
in position to expand and improve indefinitely. He was the man who laid
the foundations, and he laid foundations all of which have not yet been
built upon. But they will be eventually, and the influence of Dr. Jordan
on Stanford will endure as long as Stanford itself.
He has made the statement, "You can do anything with a bayonet ex
cept sit on it." As indicated by the tone of this, he has long felt the need
of peace, as a general rule, though he has shown himself to be immovable
in the face of violent opposition. And being a constructive sort of man, he
has come out with a most constructive scheme for muzzling the cannon.
Dr. Jordan's plan is superior to other peace projects in that it is most
probably workable, it has no prohibitively cumbersome mechanism, and
the intention is actually to give it a chance to prove itself.
And it is designed to educate the world to peace without the develop
ment of individual and ineffectual "pacifists."
