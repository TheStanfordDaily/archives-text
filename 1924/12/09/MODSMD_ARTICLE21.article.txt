Down through the ages, since the distances between East and West
have been bridged by civilization, the travel has been heavily toward the
setting sun. Hardy pioneers in their prairie schooners traversed the great
distances, but with better transportation facilities the travelers become less
hardy. At last the latest arrival must be recognized, much to the disgust
of the venerable rough-neck, but to the utter satisfaction of the more nu
merous gentlemen of polish. In other words, it looks like golf was here*'
for good.
Whatever disregard, or otherwise, may be held for the attire accom
panying the sport, golf has its benefits. It is pointed out, that with a
course on the campus the University might have better teams to represent it |
across the bay, and that the relationships with the alumni might be strength- j
ened, by attracting them back to the farm on week-ends for eighteen or
nineteen holes, or whatever.
It best behooves those of us who have persisted in earnest derision for
the past three or four years to desist; we might best face the heretics with
tolerance. â€”R. L. S.
