The following letter, which was received recently by Graduate Man
ager Paul Davis, may well serve as a send-off for the Stanford varsity in
the impending Notre Dame affair.
Mr. Paul Davis,
Graduate Athletic Manager,
Stanford University, Calif.
Dear Paul: In behalf of the Associated Students of the University of
Washington I wish to congratulate Stanford University on their very suc
cessful football season.
You have won the right to represent the conference in the Pasadena
contest and our best wishes go with you in that game. We sincerely hope
you win. Yours very truly,
(Signed) Darwin Meisnest,
Graduate Manager.
