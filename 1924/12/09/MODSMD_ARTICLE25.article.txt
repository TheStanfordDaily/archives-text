# THE 						LAW STEPS
## 
### 
<8> V.' G. D. <$>
With the week of mental torture;
about to engulf our community we
would like to say that "after all, wis
dom isn't a process; it's a result, it's
the fruit of a tree. One can't be wise; ,
one can only be fortunate."
Therefore, why worry? Be content 1
as the fruit ye are: peach, prune, or
spineless cactus.
And now President Coolidge is
"mad." He has just closed his series
of breakfast conferences with the Re
publican senators without having in-1
vited Senators LaFollette, Ladd, Fra
zier and other who were Republicans
until they came out for LaFollette.
Instead of getting together and try
ing«o come to a common understand
ing, they give parties to which they
don't invite each other.
And all the time, like a Greek
chorus, the public is moaning about
the "condition of our colleges."
Suggestions are now in order for a
more adequate chec king system in the
ladies' cloak room at the pavilion.
May the Law Steps advocate a system
of photography whereby a picture is
taken of each girl as she enters and
made to tally her ensemble when she
leaves.
A great many things might be pre
vented in this way, a great many
things.
There is a very vulgar song with
words something like these, "
what I get I don't want.'' And it is
even more true than it is common.
Perhaps Fate, or Fortune, or What
not made us that way to spur us on.
But someone ought to call Fate's at
tention to the fact that it is com
paratively easy to get the things we
should get. H'm.
"Look about, my son, and see how
little wisdom it takes to govern the
world;" therefore seek not wisdom,
but understanding—that queer ab
straction of which he who has least
thinks he" has most.
But as Mr. Young decreed, "Wisdom
is rare, Lorenzo! Wit abounts." We
save the rest of our wit for next
week's struggle.
When an ideal turns into blackness
little gods shine out alluringly against
the dark. Little people by the multi
tude, little pieces of work by the 18
hours, little pleasures—all strung on
a beautiful thread of unhappiness—
come forward to take its place.
And these (in making the blackness
turn to a glittering jet) succeed in
appearing like marionettes hopping
foolishly about the stage of the Met
ropolitan Opera House.
Ideals don't get smashed; they
merely vary in shades of color.
