"He Who Gets Slapped"—Varsity,
| Tuesday, Wednesday.
Lon Clianey, Lon Chaney, Lon Cha
j ney—that sums up "He," and that
should be enough for all who have,
ever seen him act. In spite of our
usual hardened attitude toward the
I movies, we must admit that "He" got
i us, and it is by far the best picture
that we have seen in many moons.
It is doubly interesting to those who
saw "He" when it was played bv the
I
Masquers two years ago. And much
as we like Tully Marshall, we are in
clined to prefer Delmer Daves' work !
as the seedy old Baron Manchini. The |
i Marshall Baron was grosser, but the
Daves' version seemed far more ef- j
i fective. Norma Shearer as the Baron's -
! daughter was exceedingly charming.
By all means go to see this adapta- j
i tion of the play by Andreyev with its
supreme gestures of irony and mock
ery at life. And as we said above, j
Lon Chaney is immense.
