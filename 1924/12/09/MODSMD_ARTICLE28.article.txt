# DEAN YOST GIVES ADVICE TO WOMEN
## 
### 
Dean Yost presented some facts to
Roble women at the house meeting
last night which cleared the air of
apprehension in regard to finals, es
pecially 011 the part of freshman wo
men.
"Freshman scholarship has been
unusually good this quarter," she com
mented. "Only sixty smoke-ups were
sent in citizenship, and of these only
three went to women. No upperclass
woman bus received more than one
smoke-up."
Miss Yost explained the scholarship
regulations. "Only fifteen out of the
500 went on probation last autumn
quarter, that is to say, received less
than twenty-two hours and honor
points combined. Only three women,
were disqualified, on account of receiv
ing less than ten such points. My ad
vice to you is to face the facts, pass in
spite of a smoke-up if you possibly can,
but don't put in time on a course if you
know it is already lost, instead do well
enough in the others to make up for
it, get plenty of sleep, and above all
don't worry and burden your friends
with your complaints."
