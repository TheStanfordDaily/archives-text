# SOPHOMORE COURT FIVE TRAMPLES ON SENIOR TEAM 17-14
## 1925 Reserves Take Ragged Contest from 1927 Seconds 
### 
Overwhelming their opponents by a
belated attack, sophomore hoop men
downed thfe seniors 17 to 14 yester
day, and chalked up their second
second straight victory in the inter
class basketball series. The twice
defeated junior five is the only re
maining hurdle which 1927 will have
to clear in order to cop the champion
ship. In the second contest the senior
reserves trimmed the last years 19
to 16.
The lead see-sawed between the two
teams throughout the first half. Both
contenders were slow in getting
started, 1925 drawing first blood on a
basket by Logan. Logan at forward
and Grace at standing guard were the
center of the senior attack.
Southworth and Anderson went well
for the sophomores in the opening
period, and kept their team in the
lead until a few minutes before the
half ended, when the fourth-year men
rushed in a string of reserves and
took a new lease of life. Mulchay in
particular went great guns. At the
half-way point the seniors were on
top 13 to 7.
In the second half the sophomores
adopted a five-man defense and
snapped out of it to the extent of
tallying ten points and holding their
rivals to a lone four goal. Fred Price
found the basket four times and
Southworth looped in one. These two
form a pretty smooth scoring combi
nation.

Reserves "Basket Blind"
The' "goofs" staged a rather rugged
affair, in which neither team did any
thing to brag about. The result was
doubtful until the end, first one five
and then the other holding the ad
vantage, but it was the seniors instead
of the sophomores who furnished the
fireworks which cinched the victory In
the closing minutes of play. Both
contestants suffered severely ( from
"basket blindness," taking innumer
able shots at the hoop and sinking
about one in twenty. As a result lit
tle was done in the first period. 1927
led at half time, 4 to 3.
Stewart, a red-headed center, was
the whole show for the victors. He
seemed immune from the prevailing
ailment and tossed in no fewer than
six baskets. Dunfee at running guard
was the outstanding performer for the
sophomores.

The concluding games of the inter
class series will be played in the
Encina gym this week. On Wednes
day the freshman meet the seniors
and on Thursday the sophomores tan
gle with the juniors.
Crew racing will be added to the
athletic program of the University of
Ohio if contemplated plans for dam
ming the river go through.
Overwhelming their opponents by a
belated attack, sophomore hoop men
downed thfe seniors 17 to 14 yester
day, and chalked up their second
second straight victory in the inter
class basketball series. The twice
defeated junior five is the only re
maining hurdle which 1927 will have
to clear in order to cop the champion
ship. In the second contest the senior
reserves trimmed the last years 19
to 16.
The lead see-sawed between the two
teams throughout the first half. Both
contenders were slow in getting
started, 1925 drawing first blood on a
basket by Logan. Logan at forward
and Grace at standing guard were the
center of the senior attack.
Southworth and Anderson went well
for the sophomores in the opening
period, and kept their team in the
lead until a few minutes before the
half ended, when the fourth-year men
rushed in a string of reserves and
took a new lease of life. Mulchay in
particular went great guns. At the
half-way point the seniors were on
top 13 to 7.
In the second half the sophomores
adopted a five-man defense and
snapped out of it to the extent of
tallying ten points and holding their
rivals to a lone four goal. Fred Price
found the basket four times and
Southworth looped in one. These two
form a pretty smooth scoring combi
nation.

Reserves "Basket Blind"
The' "goofs" staged a rather rugged
affair, in which neither team did any
thing to brag about. The result was
doubtful until the end, first one five
and then the other holding the ad
vantage, but it was the seniors instead
of the sophomores who furnished the
fireworks which cinched the victory In
the closing minutes of play. Both
contestants suffered severely ( from
"basket blindness," taking innumer
able shots at the hoop and sinking
about one in twenty. As a result lit
tle was done in the first period. 1927
led at half time, 4 to 3.
Stewart, a red-headed center, was
the whole show for the victors. He
seemed immune from the prevailing
ailment and tossed in no fewer than
six baskets. Dunfee at running guard
was the outstanding performer for the
sophomores.
