# STANFORD VARSITY STARTS TRAINING AFTER REST
## Cardinals in Good Condition As Warner Begins Work for Notre Dame 
### Hugh Hollenbeak 
After a two weeks' rest following the;
close of the regular season, the Stanford
varsity took to the turf again yesterday j
afternoon, and with "Pop" Warner di
recting maneuvers began practice for the
coming clash with Knute Rockne's Notre
Dame eleven, January 1, in Pasadena's
Rose Bowl.
The compiete squad was on hand with j
the exception of "Chuck" Johnston, but
Warner elected to make a few changes |
in his first string line-up by starting
Bogue at full and Flood at right tackle.
Bill Neill, veteran guard, is back in first
class condition once more, while Art
Thomas, who has been out of the game
with a bad ankle ever since the game
with Oregon, was able to don a suit
again.
Practice this week will be devoted
principally to getting the men back into
the shape they had attained for the Big
Game. Then the hoys will lay off for
four days during finals, resuming their ;
daily sessions December 20, when inten-!
sive work on the attack and defense to !
be used against the Irish will begin. The :
exact date for the trip south has not
been decided, but it is probable that the
squad will travel to Pasadena before.
Christmas in order to work on the south
ern gridiron and get acclimated.
The latest development concerning the
game itself is Warner's statement that
he will insist on an Eastern referee for
the coming clash. "Pop" hasn't been
altogether satisfied with the work of the
Coast officials, and since the Notre Dame
sysfrm demands careful officiating, the j
Card mentor wants one of the arbiters j
who has worked with them in the East to j
handle the New Year's game.
Warner is one of those who believes
that the famous "Notre Dame shift" in
volves violations of the present rule
prohibiting motion in the backficld before
the ball is snapped. This rule, which
was originally designed to stop the Notre
Dame play, has actually modified the play
of the Indiana team but little. The Mid
westerners live up to the letter of the
rule by keeping the feet stationary, but
they still retain the forward sway of their
bodies, and "Pop" claims this is an in
fraction which should be penalized. He
pointed out the laxity of the local offi
cials in enforcing this rule some time
ago when he saw the work of St. Mary's,
a team which uses the Rockne system.
During his famous interview of the
past week Walter Camp, dean of football
writers and former Stanford coach,
called attention to the supposed weakness
of Western teams against the aerial
game. If Camp's observation is true,
Stanford will have to set a new prece
dent, for the Notre Dame passing attack
is the most highly developed in the
country, and a failure to stop it means
sure defeat. The Irish backfield special
izes in all varieties of passes, short ones
over the line, lateral tosses to Crowley
and Miller, the shifty halves, and oc
casionally a long one to the ends. Stan
ford will have to do even better than it
did against Tdaho if it stems this assault.
The South Bend line is very light and
many take this to mean that it will be
easy to pierce. They could hardly be
farther from the truth. This forward
wall, which averages scarcely 180 pounds
to the man, had little difficulty turning
back the attacks of such formidable
rivals as Princeton, Georgia Tech, and
Nebraska. In the Princeton game the
Tiger backs, famous along the Atlantic
seaboard for their powerful bucking,
butted their heads against Rockne's wall
without being able to force an opening,
and then after the offensive had spent
itself, Lay den proceeded to carry the ball

over the Orange and Black goal line
twice on straight football. Quite a show
ing for a team which has a weak line and
depends on the aerial game.
The Stanford coaches can do a lot to
prepare their men for this new brand
of ball, but in the last analysis the
chances of a Stanford victory depend
largely on the ability of the Card eleven
to adapt itself to any style of play Notre
Dame may choose to employ. If the boys
from the Farm can use their heads a
little faster than the visitors they will
win.

University held their first pajamarino
rally recently. So much interest was
shown that it is planned to be the big
event before each big game.

he will insist on an Eastern referee for
the coming clash. "Pop" hasn't been
altogether satisfied with the work of the
Coast officials, and since the Notre Dame
sysfrm demands careful officiating, the j
Card mentor wants one of the arbiters j
who has worked with them in the East to j
handle the New Year's game.
Warner is one of those who believes
that the famous "Notre Dame shift" in
volves violations of the present rule
prohibiting motion in the backficld before
the ball is snapped. This rule, which
was originally designed to stop the Notre
Dame play, has actually modified the play
of the Indiana team but little. The Mid
westerners live up to the letter of the
rule by keeping the feet stationary, but
they still retain the forward sway of their
bodies, and "Pop" claims this is an in
fraction which should be penalized. He
pointed out the laxity of the local offi
cials in enforcing this rule some time
ago when he saw the work of St. Mary's,
a team which uses the Rockne system.
During his famous interview of the
past week Walter Camp, dean of football
writers and former Stanford coach,
called attention to the supposed weakness
of Western teams against the aerial
game. If Camp's observation is true,
Stanford will have to set a new prece
dent, for the Notre Dame passing attack
is the most highly developed in the
country, and a failure to stop it means
sure defeat. The Irish backfield special
izes in all varieties of passes, short ones
over the line, lateral tosses to Crowley
and Miller, the shifty halves, and oc
casionally a long one to the ends. Stan
ford will have to do even better than it
did against Tdaho if it stems this assault.
The South Bend line is very light and
many take this to mean that it will be
easy to pierce. They could hardly be
farther from the truth. This forward
wall, which averages scarcely 180 pounds
to the man, had little difficulty turning
back the attacks of such formidable
rivals as Princeton, Georgia Tech, and
Nebraska. In the Princeton game the
Tiger backs, famous along the Atlantic
seaboard for their powerful bucking,
butted their heads against Rockne's wall
without being able to force an opening,
and then after the offensive had spent
itself, Lay den proceeded to carry the ball

over the Orange and Black goal line
twice on straight football. Quite a show
ing for a team which has a weak line and
depends on the aerial game.
The Stanford coaches can do a lot to
prepare their men for this new brand
of ball, but in the last analysis the
chances of a Stanford victory depend
largely on the ability of the Card eleven
to adapt itself to any style of play Notre
Dame may choose to employ. If the boys
from the Farm can use their heads a
little faster than the visitors they will
win.

University held their first pajamarino

After a two weeks' rest following the;
close of the regular season, the Stanford
varsity took to the turf again yesterday j
afternoon, and with "Pop" Warner di
recting maneuvers began practice for the
coming clash with Knute Rockne's Notre
Dame eleven, January 1, in Pasadena's
Rose Bowl.
The compiete squad was on hand with j

sure defeat. The Irish backfield special
izes in all varieties of passes, short ones
over the line, lateral tosses to Crowley
and Miller, the shifty halves, and oc
casionally a long one to the ends. Stan
ford will have to do even better than it
did against Tdaho if it stems this assault.
The South Bend line is very light and
many take this to mean that it will be
easy to pierce. They could hardly be
farther from the truth. This forward
wall, which averages scarcely 180 pounds
to the man, had little difficulty turning
back the attacks of such formidable
rivals as Princeton, Georgia Tech, and
Nebraska. In the Princeton game the
Tiger backs, famous along the Atlantic
seaboard for their powerful bucking,
butted their heads against Rockne's wall
without being able to force an opening,
and then after the offensive had spent
itself, Lay den proceeded to carry the ball

over the Orange and Black goal line
twice on straight football. Quite a show
ing for a team which has a weak line and
depends on the aerial game.
The Stanford coaches can do a lot to
prepare their men for this new brand
of ball, but in the last analysis the
chances of a Stanford victory depend
largely on the ability of the Card eleven
to adapt itself to any style of play Notre
Dame may choose to employ. If the boys
from the Farm can use their heads a
little faster than the visitors they will
win.

After a two weeks' rest following the;
close of the regular season, the Stanford
varsity took to the turf again yesterday j
afternoon, and with "Pop" Warner di
recting maneuvers began practice for the
coming clash with Knute Rockne's Notre
Dame eleven, January 1, in Pasadena's
Rose Bowl.
The compiete squad was on hand with j
the exception of "Chuck" Johnston, but
Warner elected to make a few changes |
in his first string line-up by starting
Bogue at full and Flood at right tackle.
Bill Neill, veteran guard, is back in first
class condition once more, while Art
Thomas, who has been out of the game
with a bad ankle ever since the game
with Oregon, was able to don a suit
again.
Practice this week will be devoted
principally to getting the men back into
the shape they had attained for the Big
Game. Then the hoys will lay off for
four days during finals, resuming their ;
daily sessions December 20, when inten-!
sive work on the attack and defense to !
be used against the Irish will begin. The :
exact date for the trip south has not
been decided, but it is probable that the
squad will travel to Pasadena before.
Christmas in order to work on the south
ern gridiron and get acclimated.
The latest development concerning the
game itself is Warner's statement that
he will insist on an Eastern referee for
the coming clash. "Pop" hasn't been
altogether satisfied with the work of the
Coast officials, and since the Notre Dame
sysfrm demands careful officiating, the j
Card mentor wants one of the arbiters j
who has worked with them in the East to j
handle the New Year's game.
Warner is one of those who believes
that the famous "Notre Dame shift" in
volves violations of the present rule
prohibiting motion in the backficld before
the ball is snapped. This rule, which
was originally designed to stop the Notre
Dame play, has actually modified the play
of the Indiana team but little. The Mid
westerners live up to the letter of the
rule by keeping the feet stationary, but
they still retain the forward sway of their
bodies, and "Pop" claims this is an in
fraction which should be penalized. He
pointed out the laxity of the local offi
cials in enforcing this rule some time
ago when he saw the work of St. Mary's,
a team which uses the Rockne system.
During his famous interview of the
past week Walter Camp, dean of football
writers and former Stanford coach,
called attention to the supposed weakness
of Western teams against the aerial
game. If Camp's observation is true,
Stanford will have to set a new prece
dent, for the Notre Dame passing attack
is the most highly developed in the
country, and a failure to stop it means
sure defeat. The Irish backfield special
izes in all varieties of passes, short ones
over the line, lateral tosses to Crowley
and Miller, the shifty halves, and oc
casionally a long one to the ends. Stan
ford will have to do even better than it
did against Tdaho if it stems this assault.
