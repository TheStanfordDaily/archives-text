# SENIOR HOCKEY TEAM UNEXPECTEDLY WINS GAME FROM JUNIORS
## 
### 
The senior hockey club team yester
day upset all predictions and defeated
the juniors 6-Ck.
The seniors kept the ball in junior
territory most of the first half, but
chiefly through inaccurate aiming
scored only once. When the juniors got
the ball, their forward line was not
fast enough to keep ahead of the '25
half-backs.
In the second half, Mabel McKib
bin, left inside, made three goals in
immediate succession. After a short
scrimmage Margaret Watson (cap
tain) scored. The final goal was made
at the end of the half by Doris Harter.
The game was slow because of the
wetness of the field. The seniors
played out of line, but made up for it
by superior speed. Neither team nsed
much team work. The half backs
passed too far ahead of them, par
ticularly on the junior team.
Mabel McKibbin, left inside, and
Carolan Strouse, center half back,
were the individual stars on the sen
ior team. Lois Wilbur, i'ight half
back, was the mainstay of the junior
defense.
