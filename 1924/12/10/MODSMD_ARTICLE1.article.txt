# ROOTERS' SEATS GO ON SALE TOMORROW
## Strong Rooting Section Necessary For Victory Over Notre Dame Team on New Year's Day 
### Harry Bennett 
SEVEN hundred and fifty seats have been reserved for the Stanford rooting
section at the Notre Dame game in the Pasadena Bowl on New Year's Day.
Special stunts, the Stanford band, and rooters' caps will all be used in making
this section as powerful and well organized as any that ever represented
this University.
Tickets for seats in this reserved block will go on sale at 8 o'clock to
morrow morning at 1.50 each. The sale will continue all day tomorrow, Fri-

day, and Saturday. Each purchaser*
must call and sign for his own rooter's,
ticket and in order that the section \
be kept strictly for Stanford students, |
the Board of Athletic Control has is
sued a statement which prohibits the
transferring of any ticket bought for
this reserved section.
Women's Section Reserved
A special section has been reserved
for the women students and these
will be on sale at the same time with
the same limitations.
Original and clever stunts are being
planned by the Rally Committee.
These will be put over between halves
with the use of both rooters' caps and
colored cards. In spite of Walter
Camp's suggestion that the western
universities gave too much attention
to bleacher stunts and not enough to
ward grim determination to win the
game, the Rally Committee feels that
the stunts help the building up of the |
enthusiasm of the rooters and specta-l
tors, and also has a secondary value j
in advertisement and entertainment.
Organized Cheering Necessary
The southern alumni are waiting
anxiously for the arrival of a strong
rooting section and some good bleach
er stunts. There is every indication j
that the entire capacity of the bowl
will be needed for applications from
the alumni have been rapidly pouring
into the branch graduate manager's
office in Pasadena and each has asked j
for a large number of seats.
On the opposite side of the field is
a large section reserved for Notre
Dame. While the Irish do not intend
to bring a big rooting section with
them, there are sufficient Notre Dame
alumni and Cardinal opposers in Los
Angeles and vicinity to fill many seats.
Volunteer Workers Needed
On the morning of the game the
Rally Committee will need the as
sistance of twenty-five students to
help in placing the instruction cards
in the reserved section. The entire
committee will be unable to get there
in a body and therefore has found it
advisable to ask for assistance.
Cal Conron, chairman of the stunt
committee, requests that anyone who
can be at the bowl about 8 o'clock in
the morning will please turn in his
name to P. O. Box 577.
The Board of Athletic Control has
decided to send the band to Los An
geles to play at the game. In follow
ing the team and rooters from game
to game the band is able to promote
a valuable spirit of enthusiasm that
no doubt will be needed before the
final shot of the game has been
sounded.
Les Peter, chairman of the Rally
Committee, says: "If numerous re
ports regarding the quality of the
Notre Dame players and supporters
are true, Stanford will need to muster
every possible supporter and must
present a highly unified rooting sec
tion, It must equal and surpass any
that has ever represented our Uni
versity."
Complete self-government in regard
to conducting examinations has been 1
given to the medical students at Ann
Arbor. The students have signed a i
pledge to abide by the honor system.
The plan was approved by the Board
of Regents.

game, the Rally Committee feels that
the stunts help the building up of the |
enthusiasm of the rooters and specta-l
tors, and also has a secondary value j
in advertisement and entertainment.
Organized Cheering Necessary
The southern alumni are waiting
anxiously for the arrival of a strong
rooting section and some good bleach
er stunts. There is every indication j
that the entire capacity of the bowl
will be needed for applications from
the alumni have been rapidly pouring
into the branch graduate manager's
office in Pasadena and each has asked j
for a large number of seats.
On the opposite side of the field is
a large section reserved for Notre
Dame. While the Irish do not intend
to bring a big rooting section with
them, there are sufficient Notre Dame
alumni and Cardinal opposers in Los
Angeles and vicinity to fill many seats.
Volunteer Workers Needed
On the morning of the game the
Rally Committee will need the as
sistance of twenty-five students to
help in placing the instruction cards
in the reserved section. The entire
committee will be unable to get there
in a body and therefore has found it
advisable to ask for assistance.
Cal Conron, chairman of the stunt
committee, requests that anyone who
can be at the bowl about 8 o'clock in
the morning will please turn in his
name to P. O. Box 577.
The Board of Athletic Control has
decided to send the band to Los An
geles to play at the game. In follow
ing the team and rooters from game
to game the band is able to promote
a valuable spirit of enthusiasm that
no doubt will be needed before the
final shot of the game has been
sounded.
Les Peter, chairman of the Rally
Committee, says: "If numerous re
ports regarding the quality of the
Notre Dame players and supporters
are true, Stanford will need to muster
every possible supporter and must
present a highly unified rooting sec
tion, It must equal and surpass any
that has ever represented our Uni
versity."
Complete self-government in regard
to conducting examinations has been 1
given to the medical students at Ann
Arbor. The students have signed a i
pledge to abide by the honor system.
The plan was approved by the Board
of Regents.
SEVEN hundred and fifty seats have been reserved for the Stanford rooting
section at the Notre Dame game in the Pasadena Bowl on New Year's Day.
Special stunts, the Stanford band, and rooters' caps will all be used in making
this section as powerful and well organized as any that ever represented
this University.
Tickets for seats in this reserved block will go on sale at 8 o'clock to
morrow morning at 1.50 each. The sale will continue all day tomorrow, Fri-

day, and Saturday. Each purchaser*
must call and sign for his own rooter's,
ticket and in order that the section \
be kept strictly for Stanford students, |
the Board of Athletic Control has is
sued a statement which prohibits the
transferring of any ticket bought for
this reserved section.
Women's Section Reserved
A special section has been reserved
for the women students and these
will be on sale at the same time with
the same limitations.
Original and clever stunts are being
planned by the Rally Committee.
These will be put over between halves
with the use of both rooters' caps and
colored cards. In spite of Walter
Camp's suggestion that the western
universities gave too much attention
to bleacher stunts and not enough to
ward grim determination to win the
game, the Rally Committee feels that
the stunts help the building up of the |
enthusiasm of the rooters and specta-l
tors, and also has a secondary value j
in advertisement and entertainment.
