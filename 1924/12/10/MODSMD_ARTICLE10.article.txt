# PUBLISHING D. P. A. IN 1892 NO EASY JOB— CARLSMITH
## Daily's First Editor Visits University After Six Month European Trip 
### 
Sidelights on the birVli and evolu
tion of the Daily Palo Alto were re
vealed last weok by the first editor,
Carl S. Carlsmith, who was a visitor
to the campus.
Carlsmith, an attorney of Hilo, Ha
waii, has just returned from a trip to
London with the American Bar Asso
ciation and is stopping on the "Farm"
to visit his two sons, Merrill and
Carl.
First Attempt in 1891
Tt. was Carlsmith, with Holbrook
I3linn, dramatic star, who decided to
chronicle the official opening of Stan
ford in 1891 by starting a monthly
publication known as the "Palo Alto."
Something went wrong in the man

agement however, and the "Palo Alto"
died a miserable death, after a year's
existence.
At the'opening of the second col
lege year, in 1892, Carlsmith and two
co-partners decided on another at
tempt at publication uut in a manner
new to the campus—a daily "Palo
Alto," which became Volume 1 of the
present sheet.
Student Body in Charge
Carlsmith was again the editor and
publisher, but retained the latter ap
pelation for only a semester, at the
end of which time the paper was taken
over by the student body.
Headquarters were established in
Room 223, Encina hall, from which
copy was sent by liorse and buggy to
; the printing office in Redwood City.
Palo Alto was then but a small village
and Mayfield was considered the Uni
versity's metropolis, but was without
a printing office.
"Although I did not follow news
paper work in after years," said Carl
smith, "it was very good experience
and something which I have never re
j gretted. There it was I got what
; might be termed the 'newspaper man's
I sense.' I can appreciate the many dif
! Acuities in the way of a reporter.
Interviewed Camp, Harrison
"My first reporting was an inter
view with Walter Camp, at that time
1 Stanford's coach. President Harri
| son, who lectured here in 1894, was
i also my victim.
"I have been very deeply impressed
I with the Daily Palo Alto, and am very
| proud of it. Stanford and the Daily
have had the growth which was prom
ised at. that time. They have attained
j what it was hoped they might attain,
and modifications have been in details,
j not in general principles."

Interviewed Camp, Harrison
"My first reporting was an inter
view with Walter Camp, at that time
1 Stanford's coach. President Harri
| son, who lectured here in 1894, was
i also my victim.
"I have been very deeply impressed
I with the Daily Palo Alto, and am very
| proud of it. Stanford and the Daily
have had the growth which was prom
ised at. that time. They have attained
j what it was hoped they might attain,
and modifications have been in details,
j not in general principles."
Sidelights on the birVli and evolu
tion of the Daily Palo Alto were re
vealed last weok by the first editor,
Carl S. Carlsmith, who was a visitor
to the campus.
Carlsmith, an attorney of Hilo, Ha
waii, has just returned from a trip to
London with the American Bar Asso
ciation and is stopping on the "Farm"
to visit his two sons, Merrill and
Carl.
First Attempt in 1891
Tt. was Carlsmith, with Holbrook
I3linn, dramatic star, who decided to
chronicle the official opening of Stan
ford in 1891 by starting a monthly
publication known as the "Palo Alto."
Something went wrong in the man

agement however, and the "Palo Alto"
died a miserable death, after a year's
existence.
At the'opening of the second col
lege year, in 1892, Carlsmith and two
co-partners decided on another at
tempt at publication uut in a manner
new to the campus—a daily "Palo
Alto," which became Volume 1 of the
present sheet.
Student Body in Charge
Carlsmith was again the editor and
publisher, but retained the latter ap
pelation for only a semester, at the
end of which time the paper was taken
over by the student body.
Headquarters were established in
Room 223, Encina hall, from which
copy was sent by liorse and buggy to
; the printing office in Redwood City.
Palo Alto was then but a small village
and Mayfield was considered the Uni
versity's metropolis, but was without
a printing office.
"Although I did not follow news
paper work in after years," said Carl
smith, "it was very good experience
and something which I have never re
j gretted. There it was I got what
; might be termed the 'newspaper man's
I sense.' I can appreciate the many dif
! Acuities in the way of a reporter.
