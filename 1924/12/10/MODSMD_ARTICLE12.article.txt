# SAMPSON WILL BE GUEST OF STANFORD GOLFERS TOMORROW
## 
### 
Stanford Golf Club will
gather in the Trophy room of the Old
Union at 7:15 tomorrow night to hear
Harold Sampson, professional at the
Burlingame Country Club, discuss
prospects for a course on the campus.
Following the talk some definite plan
of action will be aaopted.
Sampson will arrive at the Univer
sity at about 2:30 in the afternoon. He
will be met by "Nick" Carter, varsity
golf manager, and Eli Dorsey, presi
dent of the Stanford Golf Club, and
escorted around the campus and over
the ground back of President Wilbur's
home where the construction of a
links was started several years ago.
The party will dine at the Theta Delta
Chi house at 6:15.
According to the Burlingame pro,
a nine-hole course with oiled-sand i
greens and mat tees can be built fori
approximately $2,500. Such a plan
would require no water and could be j
kept in condition by one man. It
would be satisfactory until sufficient
funds could be raised to put in grass
greens.
One of the determining factors in
California's victory Saturday was the
fact that the Blue and Gold squad has
two high-grade courses, Berkeley and
Claremont, available for practice al
most at the campus gate, while the
Cards are forced to make a fifteen
mile trek to â€¢ Burlingame whenever
they an hour's workout.
A course on the campus would not
only raise the standard of varsity
play but it would also permit the great
mass of "dubs" among the undergrad
uates to enjoy healthful recreation in
the open air and at the same time to
improve their games.
