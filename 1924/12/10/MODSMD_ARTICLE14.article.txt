# EAST- WEST CLASSIC BIG GAME OF YEAR
## Irishmen Present Great Backfield Combination; Cards Should Be Better Than Against Bears 
### David Meiklejohn 
«IT will be a great game." That has become the slogan for the Stanford-
Notre Dame game in Pasadena on New Year's Day.
Everybody is shouting, talking and writing about it. And, indeed, it
should be a great game, with the undefeated Irishmen bucking up against one
of the strongest teams on the Pacific Coast.
Stanford is undoubtedly being greatly underrated in the East after Walter
Camp's articles have appeared following his Western visit. But in underrating

the Cardinal there is no consideration
given to the brand of football being
played In the West as compared to
the Middle-Western and Eastern sec
tions of the country. The defeat of
Syracuse by the University of South
ern California stands out as a fairly
convincing piece of evidence. It will
remain for the Stanford varsity to
prove that Notre Dame is not in for
an easy Christmas vacation.
Notre Dame Backfield Strong
Undeniably Knute Rockne has built
up a backfield which is enough to keep
any team and group of spectators on
edge for a full game.
Harry Stuhldreher, a thinker and ex
ceptionally good passer, picked by
many coaches and critics for an All-
American berth, will be the brains of
the Irish eleven. And working in con
junction with him will be Crowley,
Miller, and Livergood, hailed as the
Four Horsemen of Football.,
Notre Dame's backfield has been
drilled, and redrilled in the handling
of forward passes. There is no occa
sion which is unsuitable for a pass,
whether it be on its own ten-yard line
or three yards from the enemy goal.
When a team is so good at passing
that it spurns the place kicks for ex
tra point-trys, then undoubtedly its
passing formation is something worth
bragging—and using.
Deception is the keynote of Knute
Rockne's success in the passing game.
Spectators, water-boys, players, and
announcers are kept wondering who
has the ball. In the final game with
Carnegie Tech, in which the Irishmen
were forced to the limit, Notre Dame's
backfield completed THIRTEEN OUT
OF SIXTEEN PASSES.
Adam Walsh, playing at center for
Rockne, is all-American timber and
hits the line like a whole lumber yard.
Rockne might not lay a great deal of
emphasis on the strength of his line,
but, nevertheless, the Irish have been
known to stop some pretty formidable
opposition, whose specialty was to
drive the ball to its destination
through main strength.
And while Knute Rockne is planning
new ways and means of mystifying the
Old Fox, and new master of the West,
"Pop" Warner is busy filling up a new
bag with New Year resolutions and
a great many plays with which to beat
the Irish.
Varsity in Training
The varsity has gone back to inten
sive training. It will last until the
week'of the finals and then be resumed
again on December 22. On December
27 "Pop" expects to take his team to
Pasadena with a clean scholastic
record.
The Stanford eleven will be just as
strong, if not stronger, against Notre
Dame than it was against California.
There will probably be no last minute
notification of ineligibility; no rushed
shifting of responsibility and meth
ods, and this will help to keep the
team coordinating as it should.
