# COLORADO RIVER DRAFT LECTURE SUBJECT OF BANNISTER
## 
### 
"The Colorado River compact is a
draft of seven states aiming at the
division of water right," said L. Ward
Bannister, '93, in his lecture last night
in the Assembly hall.
There are two phases to the west
ern water law, the Riparian and the
Priority. The first makes water rights
tied to land ownerships, with the fun
damental principle that each has the
right to make use of a fair unit.
The second system was the inven
tion of the Colorado miners of '49.
The principle involved is that the per
son using the water first has the first
right, the second, the second right,
etc.
Four rules in interstate division are
conceivable. State sovereignity would
give the right to all water that flows
within the borders, while another rule
would give the state the right to all
the water that would naturally flow
into it without hindrance.
The technical division would give
a fair amount to every state regard
less of dates of settlement and the last
rule is based on priority, regardless
of state lines.
