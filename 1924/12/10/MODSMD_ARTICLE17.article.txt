Stanford needs a rooting section to win over Notre Dame, and Stan
ford needs a win over Notre Dame to successfully conclude a successful
season.
There is no question about having plenty of lung-power at the Rose
Bowl. Most of the student body will go home to Los Angeles, and few of
them will not be seated somewhere on the Stanford side of the arena.
Hie problem, then, is not one of attendance but of concentration.
Scattered voices are not effective, nor is it considered polite to give
tongue magnificently while seated in the midst of stately and nervous
dowagers. Hence, the solution of the problem is simply not to sit amongst
these estimable old ladies. Concentrate all the leather-lungs in the rooting
section, where they can drown each other out.
It must be rememl>ered in this connection that rooters' tickets are now
being arranged for, and must be called for in person. No application
blanks for seats of any kind will be mailed out except on request, and all
transactions for tickets must be made by calling in person at the Adminis
tration building or Encina gymnasium. Therefore let no Stanford man or
woman be frozen out of the semi-tropical Bowl because of waiting for a
salesman to drop around.
1 he team, in a thoroughly businesslike way, is going about its prepara
tions for showing Notre Dame where the West begins. The students body,
represented by the Rally Committee, is doing all it can by cooking up
bleacher stunts and arranging for concentrated vocal approval. It remains
for the rest of us to fill the section, and witness the game promised by the
last ten minutes of the California spectacle. Los Angeles to a man is be
hind usâ€”several miles.
