The quarter is about to reach its crisis. Final examinations are less than
a week away, and then it will be possible to take on a few Christmas spirits
and readjust to a holiday frame of mind.
Life is mostly made up of a series of changes in ones frame of mind.
This quarter, for example, has been a succession of them. Out of the long
vacation, a struggle to bring the brain back into proper discipline, the
accomplishment of that task, the upsetting of it by the Big Game, a feel
ing of emptiness, realization that one is bound to flunk out, preparation
for the ordeal of exes, the ordeal itself, and finally the let-down and the
opportunity to cut loose the animal-cracker spirits in the Santa Claus
atmosphere.
Consider a man feeding raw material into a machine, which works
many processes and turns out something quite different. We often think
that the man may tire of performing that one operation for days and years.
The machine is considerably more active and does more kinds of work, but
perhaps the machine would get tired if it could.
The variety and versatility of college is, after all, mostly on the surface.
"POP" WARNER is especially to be congratulated upon one phase
of his All-Coast selection. He gave Kelly of Montana his due, even though
he was not given the team support which might have made him an All-
American.
THIS ISSUE of the Daily Palo Alto is the last until January 5.
