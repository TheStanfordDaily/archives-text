# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT

The Editor —sir:
Does the constitutional privilege of
the free press give the Daily Palo
Alto any right to blaspheme, libel,
even —to your shame be it said —to
ridicule that agency of law and or
der, that band of meritorious protectors
of peace, prosperity, and burglar in
surance, the Palo Alto Police Force?
I have searched diligently in the glori
ous document of our national govern
ment, in the archives of our fathers
who framed that document, in the
learned interpretations thereof from
the discovery of America to the pres
ent day; but I have found not one
word, not one clause, not one consti
tutional amendment that would justify
any condonement of your flagrant at
tack entitled, "Palo Alto Police Bra
zened by New Uniforms, Members,"
in Thursday's issue.
Sir, if you have never served on a
police force of twenty-six members
entrusted with the protection of a city
of fully twenty-six hundred inhabi

tants, you have no conception of the
difficulties and dangers of that fear
ful responsibility. Sir, two dangerous
bandits —known to be murderous, for
did they not have dynamite caps un
der the rear seat of their auto and
dry-cleaner's tags in the pockets?—
two dangerous bandits paid a nefari
ous visit to our city. What happened
to them? I quote from two newspaper
accounts: Officer Blank "surrendered
his revolver (to one of the bandits)
and awaited developments." Sir, I
ask you, is not that evidence of pro
found intellectual perspicuity and the
good taste of a gentleman? But to
continue: Officer Two Blank (Officer
Blank's body-guard) "sneaked up be
hind the man (the bandit who was
caring for Officer Blank's revolver)
and "sapped" him over the head. As
the man staggered Officer Two Blank
shot him through the chest." Sir,
what words can suggest the presence
of mind, the strategy, and withal the
mercy of Officer Two Blank? Truly,
Sir, not every policeman is at once so
brave and so gentle as to soften the
pain of shooting by a preliminary

"sap" over the head! Nor was Of
ficer Blank idle. The second bandit,
to avenge the death of his comrade,
opened fire, but he reckoned without
his officer. I quote again: Officer
Blank crossed the street —with no un
seemingly haste we may be sure—"to
keep a look-out." Still watchfully
waiting, Sir. "As he moved away he
was struck in the leg with a bullet."
But though rendered motionless, help
less perhaps, by the nervous shock and
a bullet in the necessary means of lo
comotion, Glory be —"he kept his
post." Believe me, Sir, a post is no
great protection in a gun fight, either!
Nor are all the deeds of our heroes
recorded. Many a time and oft is
their valor unsung, unrewarded too
when the city's supply of merits run
low. Our Heroes, Sir, the Peninsula's
Best, well-dressed, handsome, modest
gentlemen all; these are the men you
slander. You say that thirteen dogs
will be added to the force. May he
who- has sunk so low as to blaspheme
these watchers of the night—and to
misspell probability—may he be Chief
among them!
