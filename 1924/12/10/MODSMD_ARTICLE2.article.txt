# EVA GAUTHIER WILL GIVE REPERTORY TOMORROW
## 
### Katherine Capell 
When Eva Gauthier sings in the As
sembly hall tomorrow evening she will
present one of the most varied musi
cal programs yet given on the campus.
The concert, which will commence at
8:15, includes every type of vocal mu
sic from folk songs to classics, and
even modern American jazz.
Miss Gauthier's first number will be
composed of Javanese folk songs, in
costume. The music is from a collec
tion which she made while living in
the Far East.
Will Give Famous Compositions
A piano group by Gordon Hampson,
lier accompanist, follows. Then comes
a group of vocal classics by Miss
Gauthier. "My Sweet Little Darling,"
by William Byrd (1853), is a typical
example of the varied and individual
style of the composer.
"ivhen I have Heard," by Henry
Purgell, is from his "Fairy Queen," a
musical adaptation of Shakespeare's
"Midsummer Night's Dream," in which
lie incorporated a number of beauti
ful compositions quite unconnected
â€¢with the original play.
A well known selection by Schu
bert i 3 "Hark Hark! the Lark," in the
group of Shakesperian settings. Two
of the musical adaptations in this
group, "Orpheus with his Lute" and
"Where the Bee Sucks," are Arthur
Sullivan, famous for the Gilbert-Sulli
van comic operettas of the nineteenth
century.
French Songs Included
In the group of French songs, the
best known is "La Chevelure," by
Claude Debussy, from "Chanson de
Lilitis."
The last group in Miss Gauthier'e
repertoire is composed of modern
American popular songs. Miss Gau
thier has objected to the term "jazz*
for these songs, which she declare?
to be as true rmisic, as folk songs ol
any country. "Alexander's Ragtirm
Band," by Irving Berlin, is one of the
first of the modern songs published
"Carolina in the Morning," by Don
aldson, and George Gershwin's "Swa
nee" are two of the best known selec
tions in this list.
