# HOBBIES OF THE FACULTY
## No. 4. Professor Lewis M. Terman 
### Aurelio Espinosa, Jr 
"I'm not much of a sportsman; in
fact, I haven't got an ordinary hobby
like regular people," declared Profes
sor L. M. Terman, when asked about
his hobbies. "My hobby is wholly
scientific; it is mental testing."
Professor Terman first became in
terested in mental testing while an
undergraduate at college, and while a
senior at the University of Indiana
he made a study of leadership and
genius. Terman declares that the ex
periments he made there were so in
teresting that he immediately became
lost in the work, and that since that

time he has not been able to leave it.
After finishing college, Professor
Terman undertook a revision and ex
tension of the Binet Intelligence Tests.
Later he was in charge of investiga
tional work of the Army mental tests.
During the last three or four years,
Dr. Terman has spent all his time in
the study of gifted children and of in
telligence inheritance.
In a few words, Dr. Terman's hobby
is to help replace the crude methods
of mental testing used today, by
"methods far more accurate, analyti
cal and searching." In fewer words,
his hobby is work.
