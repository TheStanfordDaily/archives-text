# BABE WATER POLO MEN MEET OLYMPIC JUNIORS SATURDAY
## 
### 
Coach Ernie Brandsten's freshman
water polo men will open their sea
son at 11 a. m. Saturday when they
take on the Olympic Club juniors in
the Encina pool.
Although this is the first regular
competition for the yearlings they are
in the pink of condition as a result
of scrimmages almost daily with the
varsity squad, and the majority of
them have noteworthy prep school
swimming records. The young Olym
pics are considerably lighter than the
Card babes and are not as well versed
in the fine points of the game, so
Brandsten accords his splashers a
good chance for victory.
The babes' attack will center
around Eddie Luster at forward. An
drews, Lawrence Dorcy of grid fame,
and his brother, Birnie, and Kincaid
will probably all see action at the
other forward berth. Danford, Van
dernacker, Maltby, and Klein are like
ly backfleld prospects, with the first
three probable choices to start the
game. Hollingswortli has been going
good as goalkeeper in the practice
tilts, with Hiller in reserve.
