# ORATORIO PLANNED AS TRIBUTE TO R.M. ALDEN
## Story of Holy City Will Be Presented in Memorial Church on Sunday 
### 
Gaul's Oratorio, "The Holy City,"
will be given at the Memorial Church |
next Sunday at 11 o'clock. The serv
ice will be in memory of Professor
Alden, late professor of English in the j
University.
This oratorio is a presentation in
musical form of the gospel narrative
of the Holy City. This tribute to Dr.
Alden's memory is especially appro-;
priate because Dr. Alden directed
"The Holy City" when he was organ
ist and leader of the choir at the Palo
Alto Presbyterian Church.
To quote from the resolution passed
by the Academic Council, "Dr. Alden
was well-trained and able as a musi-j
cian on both the piano and organ. In
all things his view was fixed on ideals.
One of the chief moving forces of his;
nature was strong religious convic-[
tions and emotions, and he was a
conscientious and orthodox, though
liberal Christian."
Musical Organizations Combine
The University Choir will be as
sisted by the Glee Club, Schubert
Club, and members of the choir of the
Presbyterian Church of Palo Alto.
There will be no services at the Pres
byterian Church Sunday as the con-!
gregation will join with the University j
in paying tribute to one of its mem-;
bers.
Some parts of the Oratorio are espe
cially fitted for women's voices. Four
soloists will sing various parts of the
work. Mrs. Sara Bibby Brown of Palo!
Alto will sing soprano; Mrs. Samuel
Seward, Jr., of Stanford, contralto;]
Harry Robertson of San Francisco,!
tenor, and Dr. George B. Little of Palo
Alto, baritone.
