# TRYOUTS FOR NEXT QUARTER'S PLAYS ARE CONTINUED
## 
### 
Tryouts for "Macbeth" and "You
and I," which were held yesterday af
ternoon and last night, will be con
-1 tinued today and tomorrow. Tonight
the tryouts will be held in the Assem
bly hall from 7 to 9, tomorrow after
noon from 3 to 5 in the same place,
and tomorrow night from 7 to 9 in
the Little Theater..
The names of those persons who
have passed the preliminary tryouts
are posted on the bulletin board out
side of room 203 in the English build
ing. All announcements of second
tryouts and the casts will be put on
that board when decided upon.
Although "You and I" is expected
to be one of the most interesting
theatrical attractions of the present
season, and a good many already have
tried out for parts, Gordon Davis has
had no one in mind for any of the
parts as yet. It is not at all unlikely
that a dramatic "dark horse" will
prove to be the outstanding star of
the play when it is produced next
quarter. More tryoutees are needed,
j as the problem of casting is espe
cially difficult.
