# CARDINAL FIVE STARTS SEASON WITH SAN JOSE
## Gurdon Steele Is Declared Ineligible for This Season's Play 
### Wilbur Adams 
With two games on the schedule for
this week, the varsity basketball team
is rapidly rounding into shape. On
Wednesday night the Cardinal live will
meet the San Jose Teachers and Sat
urday Santa Clara will be seen in ac
tion. Both games will be in the
pavilion.
The scholarship committee recently
gave the squad a defeat. Gurdon
Steele, who has played at center for
the last two yerrs, is at present ineli
gible. Steele failed to pass the required
number of hours. He will be unable
to play this season.
Practice was resumed last Friday
after a week of rest. Coach Andy
Kerr's first task was to find a center to
fill the position left vacant by Steele.
Jayred and Anderson, both of last
year's freshman team, are the two
most promising men for this place.
Jayred is the favorite. His main diffi
culty is not being able to last a whole
game. These men will probably alter
nate at center in the Wednesday con
test.
Football Men Report
The football players were out for the
first basketball practice today. Nevers,
Middleton, Ted Shipkey, Harry Ship
key, and Mitchell have handed in their
football suits and are now out in their
basketball togs.
Nevers is expected to step right into
"his old position at forward should his
ankles be strong enough. The other
forward is still in doubt. David and
Price are working hard for the place.
David is handicapped with a bad knee
and is practicing with a heavy steel
brace on his leg.
Four Guards
Mitchell, the Shipkey brothers, and
Grace will probably all be used at
running guard this week. Mitchell,
Harry Shipkey, and Grace were on the
1924 squad while Ted Shipkey was a
regular on last season's freshman
outfit.
Captain Dave Oliva will be in his
place guarding the Stanford basket.
Oliva's injured knee has entirely
mended, and he will be in old-time
form for this week's contests.
