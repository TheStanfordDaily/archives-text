# BREAKS A WARD IRISH VICTORY OVER CARDS
## NOTRE DAME RETURNS WITH NATIONAL HONORS Speed and Alertness of Visitors Is Largely Responsible for Their Good Showing 
### David Meiklejohn 
mHE bells in the moss-covered towers of Notre Dame are signalizing the
victory of Knute Rockne's Irish varsity over the Stanford eleven.
Nineteen players, who will never again don a football uniform for Notre
Dame, returned home with an undisputed claim to national honors.
In summarizing the reasons why Notre Dame defeated the Cardinal the
first thing would be —breaks. The Irish took the breaks as they came, and at
times they came in overwhelming numbers. Alertness in taking advantage
of these breaks was the chief factor, however, in the good showing made by
the Irish.
Stanford outplayed the Irish in practically every department of straight
football, but the Blue and Gold players waited and then struck. Twice Stanford
had the ball within easy scoring distance. The first time a fumble on an end
around play proved disastrous; the second opportunity came when the Cardi
nals had the ball within four inches of the Notre Dame goal, and the Irish

.held with a tenacity which was bo
characteristic of the visiting team
from the start of the game.
It took Stanford one touchdown to
discover what the Irish mode of attack
would be. The Irish were impenetrable
during that period when they first re
ceived the ball and started on the
march toward the goal amid a shower
of forward passes, end runs and me
chanically perfect interference.
Lawson Leads Defense
It was in this attack that the work
of Jim Lawson was the most outstand
ing. Lawson played with a tenacity of
a drowning man. He battled his way
through the Notre Dame interference
to follow the ball and nab the tackier.
He cleared the opposite end to catch
an escaping horseman, and in short,
ended his football career in what was
but little short of miraculous glory.
That was on the defense. Lawson's
work on the offense was as good. He
not only carried the ball on end runs,
but took part in the sweeping passing
game conducted by Stanford.
The bitter reality that Stanford was
gaining more yardage than the Irish
was the biggest pill to swallow. In
outplaying Notre Dame at their own
spectacular and reputed passing game
Stanford only wallowed into the pro
verbial mire of defeat. Two of Stan
ford's ill-placed passes gave a fleet
Irish horseman a chance to skirt clear
of opposing tacklers and make a touch
down. Solomon's indecision in receiv
ing a punt and fumbling the ball gave
the Irish another much-needed score.
Ernie Nevers and Ted Shipkey were
the big guns in running up yardage
for Stanford. Nevers, playing his first
