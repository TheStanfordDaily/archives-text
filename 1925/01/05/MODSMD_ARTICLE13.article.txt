# Freshman Quintet To Tackle Salinas In Season Opener
## 
### 
Coach "Husky" Hunt's freshman
hoopsters will have their first strenuous
workout next Saturday evening when
they play the Salinas high school quin
tet in the pavilion as a preliminary to the
varsity clash with Santa Clara.
With the opening of the season just
five days off, the freshman mentor gave
his men the last practice this afternoon
before he makes the first cut in the squad.
For a few weeks no men will be
dropped but the squad will be divided,
letting the most likely prospective play
ers practice at a different time than the
rest.
Although the Babe quintet lost two
games in the interclass series, Coach
Hunt believes that his players will dem
onstrate more class now that regular
daily practice has started.
Keen Competition
Vincenti and Hawley appear to be the
most promising candidates for the two
positions. The pivot position is being
hotly contested for with Dennis, Rupe,
Dorcy, and Guthrie as the leading con
tenders. Bill Clark seems to have the
edge over other aspirants for the run
ning guard berth, although Davidson and
Crist show up as promising players.
Standing guard is a toss-up between
Young and Reynolds, with fhe former
having the advantage. Helmke is an
other likely prospect. Other forwards
standing a good chance are Sheffield,
Nye, and "Red" Moore.
Little dope that has been figured so far
can be relied upon too strongly for the
beginning of the new quarter is bound
to bring out several more prospects.
It seems that this year there is less
than the usual number of football stars
practicing for basketball. If the fac
ulty axe did not clip off the same per
centage of basketball material as it did
football stars there will be good pros
pects for Hunt turning out a team to
equal that of the 1927 squad.
The entire schedule for the freshman
season has not yet been announced as
there are two or more indefinite dates
on the list.
