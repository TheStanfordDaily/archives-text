# NEVERS CHOSEN BY FOOTBALL TEAM TO LEAD 1925 VARSITY
## 
### 
Ernie Nevers .will guide the destinies
jof the 1925 varsity football team. He
i was chosen captain by the members of
j the squad after the Notre Dame con
test, in which Nevers played one of the
best games of his career.
Many critics have voiced the opinion
that Nevers is the greatest athlete ever
to wear the Cardinal. He is a member
of the class of 1926, but last year he
earned three varsity letters, and was a
star on each squad. This year he in
jured an ankle in the first practice foot
i ball game of the season and was un
able to participate until the Utah game.
' In the following game, with Montana,
he crushed the other ankle and could
not play until last Thursday. Against
Notre Dame he was in the thick of the
| fray invariably. His crashing line bucks
were never stopped until they had netted
j a substantial gain, his passes were well
j timed find accurate, and Notre Dame
' found its Waterloo in his work on de-
I fensc.
i Should his ankles be strong enough,
! Nevers is counted upon to fill one of the
! forward berths on the hoop squad. He
' played this position last year and was
known as one of the smoothest pivoters
! and dribblers In the conference.
Last year his work on the mound was
a leading factor in California's defeat
by the Card baseball varsity. On the
1923 grid team he was also invaluable,
being placed on Walter Camp's third
All-American eleven.
When a freshman Nevers earned four
I numerals, a feat seldom recorded. Two
of these came on the same day, as he
pitched for the Babe nine in the fore
noon, and then after taking "a shower
donned track togs and placed in the
i Stanford-California track meet.
