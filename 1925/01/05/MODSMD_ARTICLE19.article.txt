# Second Wind
## 
### 
All of ns are a little wiser, theoretically, and some of lis a little
sadder at the opening of this second quarter. Some of us, a little too
sad, are not here at all.
The winter quarter is probably the quietest of the three. In autumn
we have football, and in spring we have weather, Lagunita, and en
gagements. The absence, to a great extent, of these diversions during
the next three months will leave plenty of spare time, which must be
fiddled away somehow.
Student body activities will afford valuable experience, pleasure,
and an outlet for initiative to everybody who can find one fitted to his
or her interest and abilitv.
