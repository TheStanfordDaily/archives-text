"Peter Pan"—Varsity, Monday, Tues- j
, day, Wednesday.
It would be easy to say many things ;
I of no importance about this production
! of Barrie's play, but it defies reviewing
in the usual manner. One either likes
it or one doesn't but in either case one
I should be glad to see something differ
ent from the ordinary, half-melodramatic
| "super" movie.
We should have been glad to have
I had it here during "ex" week, as it
would have been an ideal rest cure for
' the tired student. Being a fairy play,
"Peter Pan" is well adapted to the
movies, for here miraculous happenings
and weird characters can be produced
with ease. We are sure that you will
like Nana, the dog, and the little fairy,
Tinker Bell. Too much cannot be said
for the acting of Betty Bronson as Peter.
She enters into the spirit of the movie,
and one is never tired of watching her. ,
And, of course, Ernest Torrence is good
as the old pirate, Captain Hook.
Whether you like fairies and fairy
stories or not, we should advise you to
see "Peter." It is altogether a pretty
play and has many beautiful scenes, and
it is infinitely better than the "hero-dogs

villain-final-clinch" type of movie. And j
we would venture that more will like it j
than would care to confess to their hard- !
boiled friends.
