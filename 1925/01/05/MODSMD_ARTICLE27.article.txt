# JACKMAN HERRICK REPAYS STANFORD FOR HIS EDUCATION
## Gives University Bond for $1000 Which He Says Is For Old "Debt" 
### Harry Bennett 
"Every Stanford graduate that has
been successful and has earned any
amount of money, should come back to
his Alma Mater and pay his debts, re
turn everything that this University has
expended on him during his years of
study," said Jackman Herrick, ex-'96,
who returned to the campus just before
Christmas vacation, from his ranch in
Utah, in order that he migh pay his
"debt."
Herrick, who was a classmate of Presi
dent Wilbur and Herbert Hoover, ap
peared at the President's office and de
posited a $1,000.00 bond for such use as
the University desires.
"This amount," he said, "is the ap
proximate figure that the administration
expended on me during the two and
three-quarters years that I was a reg
istered student."
Enrolled in 1892
On August 5, 1892, Herrick enrolled j
at Stanford from Washington, D. C. At
that time the academic year was di
vided into two semesters and the tuition |
was the nominal sum of $10 a semester.
When registering he was in very poor ,
financial condition but had a personal j
letter to Dr. John C. Branner, who |
guided him during his first day on the i
campus. He was soon able to secure j
work as private secretary to Dr. Jordan, j
Herbert Hoover, then an undergrad
uate, was Herrick's first acquaintance.
During the winter of 1892 these two
worked together in the geological labo
ratories, typing several books written on |
geological research in Arkansas, and
soon became fast friends.
Values Associations
"Two-thirds of my education and val
uable experiences came to me through
my associations with Dr. Jordan and j
Herbert Hoover, while I attribute the j
other third to the University training
itself," said Herrick. "Since leaving j
Stanford I have found that the ideas,
and personalities instilled in me, through j
my connections with these two men, j
have proven invaluable."
At one time Herrick was a news edi
tor on the Daily Palo Alto staff under
Carl S. Carlsmith, who was then editor.
During the year of 1892 when the Daily
first came into existence, he was one I
of the few that struggled to continue ;
the publication.
Health Fails
Toward the end of his third year, con- j
stant worry over financial conditions
caused Herrick to suffer a general
breakdown, and on March 7, 1894, he
was taken ill with typhoid. Throughout
Herrick's illness, Hoover was his con
stant attendant.
With this sickness came the end of j
Herrick's university career. Entirely
out of funds and in poor health, he left
for his grandmother's home in the mid
dle west. For several years he tried to
save sufficient money to return and fin
ish his four-year course but to no avail.
In 1907, he came west to Duchesne,
Utah, in an effort to regain his former
health. There he took up claims on sev- j
eral tracts of land. At present there
are many companies drilling for oil in
that section of the country and it is ex
pected that his lands will prove valuable
oil fields.
Spends Winter in California
With money earned as an agriculturist
and the prospects of striking oil, Her
rick is spending the winter in California
and is now on a ranch in Kern county
trying to build up his failing health.
"When I visit Stanford now, it seems
as though I were in a different world
than the one I left in 1894. Ihe last
time I was here, Stanford was a mite of
a University in the country, while now,
it seems to be a city in itself," was
Herrick's comment after making the
rounds of his former stamping grounds.
"In 1892 Stanford consisted "merely of
the present inner Quadrangle; Encina
hall; Roble hall, now known as Se
quoia ; and a few scattered laboratory
buildings.
"Even Palo Alto had only one hotel,
another small building, and a depot shed.
When I first arrived in Palo Alto, in
the fall of 1892, this shed was the first
object that met my glance. On its roof
was painted 14-10, the score of the first
'Big Game' with California, from which
the Cards emerged victorious."

"Two-thirds of my education and val
uable experiences came to me through
my associations with Dr. Jordan and j
Herbert Hoover, while I attribute the j
other third to the University training
itself," said Herrick. "Since leaving j
Stanford I have found that the ideas,
and personalities instilled in me, through j
my connections with these two men, j
have proven invaluable."
At one time Herrick was a news edi
tor on the Daily Palo Alto staff under
Carl S. Carlsmith, who was then editor.
During the year of 1892 when the Daily
first came into existence, he was one I
of the few that struggled to continue ;
the publication.
Health Fails
Toward the end of his third year, con- j
stant worry over financial conditions
caused Herrick to suffer a general
breakdown, and on March 7, 1894, he
was taken ill with typhoid. Throughout
Herrick's illness, Hoover was his con
stant attendant.
With this sickness came the end of j
Herrick's university career. Entirely
out of funds and in poor health, he left
for his grandmother's home in the mid
dle west. For several years he tried to
save sufficient money to return and fin
ish his four-year course but to no avail.
In 1907, he came west to Duchesne,
Utah, in an effort to regain his former
health. There he took up claims on sev- j
eral tracts of land. At present there
are many companies drilling for oil in
that section of the country and it is ex
pected that his lands will prove valuable
oil fields.
Spends Winter in California
With money earned as an agriculturist
and the prospects of striking oil, Her
rick is spending the winter in California
and is now on a ranch in Kern county
trying to build up his failing health.
"When I visit Stanford now, it seems
as though I were in a different world
than the one I left in 1894. Ihe last
time I was here, Stanford was a mite of
a University in the country, while now,
it seems to be a city in itself," was
Herrick's comment after making the
rounds of his former stamping grounds.
"In 1892 Stanford consisted "merely of
the present inner Quadrangle; Encina
hall; Roble hall, now known as Se
quoia ; and a few scattered laboratory
buildings.
"Even Palo Alto had only one hotel,
another small building, and a depot shed.
When I first arrived in Palo Alto, in
the fall of 1892, this shed was the first
object that met my glance. On its roof
was painted 14-10, the score of the first
'Big Game' with California, from which
the Cards emerged victorious."
"Every Stanford graduate that has
been successful and has earned any
amount of money, should come back to
his Alma Mater and pay his debts, re
turn everything that this University has
expended on him during his years of
study," said Jackman Herrick, ex-'96,
who returned to the campus just before
Christmas vacation, from his ranch in
Utah, in order that he migh pay his
"debt."
Herrick, who was a classmate of Presi
dent Wilbur and Herbert Hoover, ap
peared at the President's office and de
posited a $1,000.00 bond for such use as
the University desires.
"This amount," he said, "is the ap
proximate figure that the administration
expended on me during the two and
three-quarters years that I was a reg
istered student."
Enrolled in 1892
On August 5, 1892, Herrick enrolled j
at Stanford from Washington, D. C. At
that time the academic year was di
vided into two semesters and the tuition |
was the nominal sum of $10 a semester.
When registering he was in very poor ,
financial condition but had a personal j
letter to Dr. John C. Branner, who |
guided him during his first day on the i
campus. He was soon able to secure j
work as private secretary to Dr. Jordan, j

"When I visit Stanford now, it seems
as though I were in a different world

'Big Game' with California, from which
the Cards emerged victorious."
