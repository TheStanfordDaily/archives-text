# FOOTBALL FIGURES ARE COMPILED BY EASTERN FOLLOWER
## 
### 
For a period of ten years Fred A.
Hart, a close follower of Eastern foot
ball, has compiled statistics 011 the
football that has been played by Rut
gers college. During the ten years Rut
gers has met eighty-three of the best
teams in the East and Middlewest.
By means of a chart Hart maps out
every play accurately in the game. His
figures include penalties, passes, kicks,
and every other possible branch of
football. He has also carefully pre
served the individual work of each
Rutgers player.
Hazel, Camp's choice for Ail-Ameri
can fullback, was a member of the
Rutgers team this year and Hart's fig
ures show that whatever recognition
was giv-2n him was certainly deserved.
From the line of scrimmage this player
gained 392 yards in 83 plays. Twenty
one passes thrown by him netted 476
yards, and his punts averaged over 45
yards during the entire season.
The most interesting figures that
were compiled were those for the aver
age game of football, which follow:
Kickoffs: Average per game, 7; aver
age distance, 44.6 yards; average run
back, J4.5 yards; less runback and ball
out, 27.8 (ball in play).
Punts: Average per game, 13.8; av
erage distance, 35.6 yards; average
runback, 4.7. Less runback and ball
out, 29.8 yards.
Drop and placement kicks: Average
tried per game, 1.5; average scoring
goals, .28.
Passes: Average per game, 19.5; un
completed, .54; intercepted, .15; com
pleted, .33; average distance complet
ed passes, 4.8 yards.
Penalties: Average per game, 6.72;
average distance, 11.2; average dis

Scrimmages: Average, per game,
83.5; average gain in yards, 3.7.
Scrimmages: Average per game,

First downs: Average per game, 19.5.
Points scored: Average per game,
31.1.
Touchdowns: Average per game, 4.5.
Goals after touchdown: Average per
game, .72.
Recent physical examinations of
men of the freshman class at Syracuse
University showed that 65 per cent of
the yearlings were defective. Six hun
dred and eighty men were examined,
and of this number two hundred and
forty suffered from flat feet. It was
also learned that this year's freshman
class used 10 per cent less tobacco
than last year's freshmen.

Recent physical examinations of
men of the freshman class at Syracuse
University showed that 65 per cent of
the yearlings were defective. Six hun
dred and eighty men were examined,
and of this number two hundred and
forty suffered from flat feet. It was
also learned that this year's freshman
class used 10 per cent less tobacco
than last year's freshmen.
For a period of ten years Fred A.
Hart, a close follower of Eastern foot
ball, has compiled statistics 011 the
football that has been played by Rut
gers college. During the ten years Rut
gers has met eighty-three of the best
teams in the East and Middlewest.
By means of a chart Hart maps out
every play accurately in the game. His
figures include penalties, passes, kicks,
and every other possible branch of
football. He has also carefully pre
served the individual work of each
Rutgers player.
Hazel, Camp's choice for Ail-Ameri
can fullback, was a member of the
Rutgers team this year and Hart's fig
ures show that whatever recognition
was giv-2n him was certainly deserved.
