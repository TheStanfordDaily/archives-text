Starting the New Year off with a
rush, Gordon Davis will present next
Friday night in the Assembly hall,
"The Torch Bearers," by George Kelly,
with a cast composed exclusively of
members of the Stanford faculty, and
others who are connected with the
University in an official capacity.
"The Torch Bearers" is a satire on
the "Little Theatre" movement which
has such a vogue at the present time,
and the theme of the play concerns
itself with the experiences of a group
of amateur actors who heroically un
dergo the hardships and perils attend
ant upon the production of a one-act
play.
Dr. Bailey Has Lead
Professor Margery Bailey has the
most important role,, that of Madame
J. Duro Pampinelli, who is the direc
tress of the enthusiastic would-be ac
tors and actresses. Many of the most
prominent thespians in the faculty are
included in the cast among whom are:
Professors L. E. Bassett, as a hard
boiled stage manager; B. O. Foster,
as a sprightly and gallant youth with
a fondness for apt quotations; P. A.
Martin, as a mustached thespian, who
loses half his mustache in the middle
of the act.
The play is being presented by the
Stanford faculty as a benefit for the
Russian Relief Fund, and the net .pro
ceeds, including the dance which will
be given after the show in the Wo
men's Clubhouse, will be turned over
to that charity.
The seat sale will be held Wednes
day afternoon at 1 o'clock in the Ad

will still be at the same reduced rates
of 75 cents and $1.
