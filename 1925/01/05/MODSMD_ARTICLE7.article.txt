Eight Stanford men went to Canada
during the Christmas vacation with
the California rugby team that played
the picked teams of the North and
which won two out of its three games.
Twenty men made the trip and
eleven of the squad were members of
the team that won the International
Championship at the Olympic Games
last June.
In the first of the holiday season
games the Californians met and de
feated the University of British Colum
bia team by a score of 9 to (k
The second game was played with
a picked team representing the Van
couver Rowing Club. In this game the
American squad was defeated 3 to 0.
Beat All-Stars
Ending the two-week series with
Canadian teams the Americans staged
a comeback and in their fastest â€¢game,
defeated a Canadian All-Star team
15-0.
The Stanford men making the trip
included Dud DeGroot, Phil Clark, Lyn
Farrish, Norm Cleaveland, Charles Doe,
Morris Kirksey, Jack Patrick, and
"Lefty" Rogers.
While the team was in the North,
Dr. Otto Bohrsman, representing the
New South Wales Rugby Union, made
a short visit to San Francisco from
Sydney, Australia, to determine the
possibilities of forming an All-Califor
nia team to make a tour of Australia
next summer.
Dr. Bohrsman expressed much in
terest in the outcome of the Canadian
games and in all probability the Cali
fornians will be invited to make the
tour next July and August.
If the trip is made it will be con
ducted under the auspices of the New
South Wales Rugby Union and the
New Zealand Rugby Union.
All-Blacks Winning
At present the New Zealand team
is traveling through Europe playing
all of the best European teams. Out
of the twenty-two matches played by
the New Zealand All-Blacks they have
not lost a game to date.
The All-Blacks have defeated the
All-England, the All-Scotland, and the
All-Ireland teams. Among other promi
nent teams they have defeated are the
teams from Oxford and Cambridge.
At present the All-Blacks are in
France. From there they will go to
Canada and it is expected that during
the latter part of February they will
visit Stanford before sailing for Au
stralia. Harry Maloney is planning to
stage a practice match with them if
it is possible to organize a Cardinal
team.
