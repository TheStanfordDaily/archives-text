# VARSITY QUINTET MEETS TEACHERS IN FIRST CONTEST
## Card Squad Delayed Month by Lateness of Grid Season Says Kerr 
### 
San Jose Teachers' College will fur
nish the first competition for the Stan
ford varsity quintet tomorrow night
in the pavilion.
It will be practically a new team
that Andy Kerr will put on the floor.
The loss of "Nip" McHose and Ray
Mcßurney and the recent ineligibility
of Gurdon Steele leaves the Stanford
coach somewhat up in the air for
veteran material and dependent almost
entirely on players from last year's
freshman team and varsity reserve
men. x
Football a Handicap
Because of the lengthened period of
football the team is almost a month
behind schedule, according to Andy
Kerr. This means that the line-up will
in all probability consist of men who
have been working regularly with the
squad during the football season.
San Jose Teachers' College has al
ways furnished some real competition
for the Cards. It has the advantage
over the varsity because of regular
practice and early season games.
Notwithstanding this, however, Stan
ford is the favorite, and the game
will be a good early indication of just
how strong a team Kerr can bank upon
lor the remainder of the season. Not a
conclusive indication by any means,
but at least it will show which men
can be kept on the squad to advantage.
Three Places in Doubt
There are three positions which are
as yet a little in doubt. Ernie Nevers,
as soon as»he is in shape to continue
with basketball, is a cinch for one of
the forward positions. The other berth
is open to competition, but in all likeli
hood it will be filled by either Nelson
David or Fred Price, two of the 1927
stars. There is little to choose between
these two men, although they differ
to extremes in style of play.
David plays a faster, albeit more un
steady game, than Price, and is, per
haps, a more accurate shot. Price is a
good floor man and valuable in passing
formations.
Center Position Open
The center position might be filled
by either .Jayred or Anderson, both
sophomores playing their first season
of varsity basketball. In considering a
center Harry Shipkey might well adapt
himself to the position. He has the
height, perhaps more experience than
the two sophomore competitors, and is,
on the whole, not unsteady in shooting
baskets, although this ability was exer
cised but occasionally in the games
last season when he substituted at
standing and running guard.
Howard Mitchell is favored more or
less for the position of running guard.
Mitchell did not show up so diffidently
last season as a substitute to Mcßur
ney; he has speed and is a passable
goal-shooter. Ted Shipkey or Harry
Shipkey are also strong contenders for
this position.
