# SEAT SALE FOR FACULTY COMEDY TOMORROW NOON
## Professors and Wives Will Appear In "The Torch Bearers" For Charity 
### Charles Simons 
Tomorrow afternoon at 1 o'clock stu
dents will have their first opportunity
to purchase tickets for the faculty
show, "The Torch Bearers," which will !
be given in the Assembly hall next
Friday night with an all-star faculty
cast.
Satirical comedy is the theme of the
play, which depicts the struggles and
hardships which a group of would-be !
actors and actresses undergo when
they attempt ot put on a one-act play.
"Little Theatre" movements are satir

ized f o a fare-you-well in this comedy
which is replete with ludicrous situa
tions and funny lines.
Seat Cards Asked
Several comedians and comediennes
will be introduced to the campus on
Friday night, and as a consequence the
courses of quite a few professors will
be requiring seat cards for entrance.
Professors Bailey, Basett, Foster, Mar
tin, and Instructor Burks all have rich
comedy parts, which they enact with
all the skill of seasoned veterans.
The second act of the play depicts

the happenings back-stage when the
embryo thespians are producing their
one-act play. Professor Margery Bailey,
in the role of Madame J. Duro Pampi
nelli, is the directress of the play,
and her methods of instruction and
production form most of the hilarious
comedy of the act.
Professor Martin Shines
Professor Martin is the personifica
i tion of awkwardness and dumbness in
the role of Ralph Twiller, and manages
to lose everything but one-half of his
mustache during the progress of the
second act.
Professor Bassett has originated
what he has called the "kangaroo
leap," which he executes with consum
mate skill when awakened from a cat
nap by the noise mad« by the actors
back stage. He is seen in the role of
a stage manager, and is so hard boiled
that he makes the boards of the stage
shake when he talks.
So Does Professor Foster
Professor Foster has created an
other artistic triumph in the role of
Mr. Spindler, who is the "never-ready"
property boy who is always just too
late on each cue. His handling of a
cigar in the first act is so much like
that of every youth who first attempts
to smoke that it will bring sweet
memories to the male portion of the
audience.
Dana Burks, in the role of Mr. Hux
ley Hosselfrosse, typifies the average
small-town leading man, with his su

Howard, Professor Martin, Mrs. Huston.
perb .gestures and marvelous dramatic
voice. One of the funniest parts in the
play, Burks gives such a vivid por
trayal that he will keep the audience
in a continual gale of laughter when he
is on the stage.
Wives Act, Too
There are some mighty good ac
tresses among the professors' wives,
as the campus will learn during Friday
night's performance. Mrs. E. D. Adams,
as Florence McCrickett; Mrs. D. L.
Webster, as Clara Sheppard; Mrs. H.
W. Stebbins, as Jenny, and Mrs. C. A.
| Huston as Nelly Fell are splendidly
| cast and contribute a great deal of the
: comedy which runs throughout the
show.
Miss Emily Howard, in the role of
Paula Ritter, who fills in for one of
the actresses at the last fnoment, in
spite of the fact that her husband is
apparently seriously ill, has somewhat
of a "Dulcy" part in which she creates
an extremely humorous j-ole.
And Besides —
Paul Clyde, as her husband, chews
a cigar with true Theodore Roberts
effect, and executes a fall down stairs
which is worthy of the middle ring in
a circus.
Fred Lape takes the part of an office
boy in the one-act play, and manages
to gum things up in great fashion just
to help things along a bit.
Another attraction of the evening
will be a one o'clock dance in the
Women's Clubhouse after the show at
which the Hess-Young orchestra will
officiate. »
