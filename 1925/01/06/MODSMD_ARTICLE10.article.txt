# SEAT SALE FOR FACULTY COMEDY TOMORROW NOON
## Professors and Wives Will Appear In "The Torch Bearers" For Charity 
### Charles Simons 
Tomorrow afternoon at 1 o'clock stu
dents will have their first opportunity
to purchase tickets for the faculty
show, "The Torch Bearers," which will !
be given in the Assembly hall next
Friday night with an all-star faculty
cast.
Satirical comedy is the theme of the
play, which depicts the struggles and
hardships which a group of would-be !
actors and actresses undergo when
they attempt ot put on a one-act play.
"Little Theatre" movements are satir

ized f o a fare-you-well in this comedy
which is replete with ludicrous situa
tions and funny lines.
Seat Cards Asked
Several comedians and comediennes
will be introduced to the campus on
Friday night, and as a consequence the
courses of quite a few professors will
be requiring seat cards for entrance.
Professors Bailey, Basett, Foster, Mar
tin, and Instructor Burks all have rich
comedy parts, which they enact with
all the skill of seasoned veterans.
The second act of the play depicts

the happenings back-stage when the
embryo thespians are producing their
one-act play. Professor Margery Bailey,
in the role of Madame J. Duro Pampi
nelli, is the directress of the play,
and her methods of instruction and
production form most of the hilarious
comedy of the act.
Professor Martin Shines
Professor Martin is the personifica
i tion of awkwardness and dumbness in
the role of Ralph Twiller, and manages
to lose everything but one-half of his
mustache during the progress of the
second act.
Professor Bassett has originated
what he has called the "kangaroo
leap," which he executes with consum
mate skill when awakened from a cat
nap by the noise mad« by the actors
back stage. He is seen in the role of
a stage manager, and is so hard boiled
that he makes the boards of the stage
shake when he talks.
So Does Professor Foster
Professor Foster has created an
other artistic triumph in the role of
Mr. Spindler, who is the "never-ready"
property boy who is always just too
late on each cue. His handling of a
cigar in the first act is so much like
that of every youth who first attempts
to smoke that it will bring sweet
memories to the male portion of the
audience.
Dana Burks, in the role of Mr. Hux
ley Hosselfrosse, typifies the average
small-town leading man, with his su


One of the amusing situations in "The Torch Bearers." Left to right:
Professor Bassett, Frederick Lape, Professor Bailey, Professor Foster, Miss
Howard, Professor Martin, Mrs. Huston.
