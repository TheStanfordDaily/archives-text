# W. F. DIETRICH WILL SPEAK ON ECONOMIC CONDITION OF MEXICO
## 
### 
Professor W. F. Dietrich, of the
Mining and Metallurgy department,
will lecture tonight in the Little Thea
tre on the Economic Conditions in
Mexico. In his talk he will give a
general survey of the political and eco
nomic conditions of that country as he
found them on a fourteen-month visit
last year.
While in Mexico, on a leave from
the University, Dietrich was employed
as efficiency engineer for the Santa
Gertruda Mining Company. At that
time the "De la Huerta" revolution
was taking place and the party experi
enced a great many active times.
He visited Mexico City and it was
then considered almost impossible to
get to that metropolis safely. The
rebels were holding up all the trains
and causing great havoc.
In Pachuca, a small town some sixty
miles distant from Mexico City, Diet
rich experienced the novel sensation
i of being between two gunfires. On one
side were the attacking rebels and on
the other the federals were attempting
to hold their part of the city.
Xochimilcho is situated about twen
ty miles from Mexico City and is some
times considered the Venice of Mexico.
A number of the slides illustrating the
lecture have been taken from that vi
cinity and near Pachucha.
Professor Dietrich returned to the
! campus the first part of last Septem
! ber when his leave from the Univer
! fiity expired. In the following October
! lie gave a talk at a Palo Alto Commun-
I ity luncheon on the same subject upon
which he will speak tonight.
Professor Dietrich is of the class of
I '13, and took his degree here in 1914.
lln 1915, he was engineer with the
I Copper Queen Consolidated Mining
Company, Bisbee, Ariz., and in the
next year, engineer and later assayer
with the Consolidated Arizona Smelt
| ing Company. Since then he has been
an associate professor in the Depart
ment of Mining and Metallurgy.
