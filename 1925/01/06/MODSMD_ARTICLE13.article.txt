# TRACK TEAM LOSES HALE AND STORIE
## 
### 
Track prospects for this year re
ceived a serious blow when Captain
Marshal Hale and Bill Storie were put
out of competition for the season.
Hale went out by the flunk-out route
Vhile Storie's absence will be because
of doctor's orders. Storie is in college,
but will be unable to take part in the
coming track meets.
Hale was elected captain last year
after he had won the 220-yard dash
and taken second in the century in
the Big Meet. He was counted upon for j
10 points in the meet with Gulifornia
this season.
Storie crossed the tape in the quar
ter-mile run in last year's meet right j
behind Miller and ahead of Van Judah, j
Stanford's captain. He was expected j
to run a lap in the relay this year, too.
