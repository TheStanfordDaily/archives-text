# BABE WATER POLO SEVEN Will MEET OLYMPIC JUNIORS
## P. A. A. Swim Events Slated For Olympic Pool on January 30 
### 
Freshman water poloists will play a
return game with the Olympic Club
juniors January 30 as the first event
in a rather full swimming program
planned by Coach Ernst Brandsten for
; the coming season.
The yearlings lost the first game to
the young Olympics December 13, and
are thirsting for revenge. Both Brand
sten and the members of the team
believe that. Stanford should have won
the first game which was lost because
the absence of some of the Cardinal
stars made a last-minute change in the
line-up necessary. Coupled with this is
the fact that certain Stanford players
were not in the best of condition.
P. A. A. Junior Events
All of the P. A. A. junior events have
been awarded to the Olympic Club
this year, and some of them will be
held in conjunction with the water polo
game. The program will probably be
held in the pool of the Post-streeters,
as the first game was staged in Encina
pool. The remaining events are slated
for February.
During the latter part of February
and the early weeks in March the var
sity water polo seven will play a series
of three games with the Olympics,
which will serve to get the men in
condition for the game with California
to be held simultaneously with the
swimming meet with the Blue and
Gold about the middle of March. Defi
nite dates will be anounced as soon
as the final arrangements have been
completed.
Brandsten will in all likelihood enter
several of his paddlers in the national
indoor championship meet which will
be held in the new 100(Moot Fleishack
er Memorial Pool in San Francisco,
March 23-26. Stars from the United
States and several foreign countries
will compete at that time. Arne Borg,
the Swedish marvel, and several
Hawaiian performers have already ac
cepted invitations, and there is some
possibility that Boy Charleton of Au
stralia will participate.
The national outdoor championships
will be staged in Seattle in July, so
all the important national events of
! the year have been secured for the
I Pacific Coast.
