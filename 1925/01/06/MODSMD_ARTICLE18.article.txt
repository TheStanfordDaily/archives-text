The passing of Jim Lawson left the Stanford varsity with the problem
of finding a worthy successor to his captaincy. The presence of Ernie
Nevers simplified this problem to the extent of making it no problem at all.
Lawson has been a real captain, a real leader, and a real example. He
has brought his team to the turning point and started it on a path strange
to Stanford elevens for the past few years. His playing, his leadership,
and his personality have been all that Stanford background and ideals
could ask.
Nevers will carry on everything that Lawson has represented. One
of the greatest athletes ever seen in a Cardinal jersey (and Stanford is
not the only university which wears the red), he will be admirably fitted
to work with Coach Warner in building a new team from new material.
He is a hard player, a clean player, and a good player.
Nevers is probably the most widely known feature of Stanford ath
letics just now. As captain of the varsity, he will bring his team into the
picture, leaving himself out so far as possible. He will be a marked man
in every game, and the result of the marking will have a great effect upon
all-American selections for 1925.
The Daily congratulates both Lawson and Nevers, and thanks them on
behalf of the student body for their achievements of the past and future.
