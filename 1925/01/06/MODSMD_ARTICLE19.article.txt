Now, last night—ah, the last of freedom—there was considerable noise
at the movie show. Yes, considerable. The management stopped the pic
ture and showed a nice new slide purporting to abolish all unnecessary
disturbance.
Then the war started. Whoop! Wow! Boo! "Take it off!" The
slide persisted. The noise persisted. War persisted. It began to look as if
the management would win. No quiet, no picture. At the critical moment,
the operator, or the manager, or whoever in the picture show's forces,
weakened. The slide went. The picture went. By and by, the noise
went.
Not so long ago, the manager of the show told us that things usually
went along very peacefully, barring a few particular complaints. But
recently there seems to have been started an anti-noise campaign.
Things are pretty quiet on the campus and in Palo Alto, that is, usually.
What harm if a bunch of fellows pile into the show and act a little younger
than is conventional? The vociferous critics sometimes make a poor pre
sentation endurable. Excepting those times, of course, when they are
worse than the picture. —R. L. S.
