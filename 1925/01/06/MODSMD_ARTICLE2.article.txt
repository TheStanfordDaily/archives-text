# EIGHTY STUDENTS ARE DISQUALIFIED
## 
### 
Approximately eighty Stanford tin- j
dergraduates were declared ineligible
to participate in scholastic pursuits
for at least one quarter, according to :
the estimate of the Scholarship Com
mittee.
As there are several cases under
protest, awaiting the action of the
committee at its next meeting, it is
impossible to obtain final figures. It
is probable that the above estimate
will vary five or six figures.
Of the total number of eighty, only
twenty-two freshmen were "flunked
out." This is a very creditable showing
for the first-year men as compared
with former records.
