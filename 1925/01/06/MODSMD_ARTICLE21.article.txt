"Alas! the sprite that haunts us
Deceives our rash desire;
It whispers of the glorious gods . . .
. . . And leaves us in the mire."
May we be permitted to dig up the
past just long enough to philosophize
on the Notre Dame game?
It is another of those so Very lovely
examples of the way life operates.
The team, or the man, who has the
ball the greater part of the time, and
who is always the aggressor, loses be
cause an opponent took advantage of
a moment's fumble.
It rather seems that the one who is
ready to leap in when the man with
the ball loses bis grip for a second
comes out the winner.
Some of our student body went home i
in a hearse. Please God, they have |
not come back in one.
Perhaps you stood next to her vegis- I
tering yesterday:
"She would talk to a stone
Or to a grass blade by it;
I wonder where she's gone
If the Lord loves quiet?"
Shall we make a guess?
Don't stand off and look at the
crowd. You will only smile. Jump into
it, and take to heart these humble
lines to a Mexican Jumping Bean:
"Within that shell we may not see
behind
Thy agile shifts betray the master
mind;
Ah, little soul, so active, though un
seen,
From thee may I too learn to use
my bean."
"La vie: C'est la femme que l'on a;
L'art: C'est la femme que l'on de
sire." N'est ce pas?
