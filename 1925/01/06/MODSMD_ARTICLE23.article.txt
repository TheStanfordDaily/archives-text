# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT

### To the Editor 
There seems to be a divided opinion
on the question of "Jolly-ITp" dances.
I have been at Stanford for one quar
ter and find it hard to become ac
quainted. As 1 understand it, this dance
is usually held once a quarter to en
able the new students to become ac
quainted.
I believe they did not have this
dance last quarter because of numer
ous protests. But I certainly would wel
come the opportunity to meet more
campus people and I am sure there
are many others who would approve
of such an affair as the "Jolly-Up."
Here's hoping they will have one
this quarter and create a spirit of
friendliness. —"ANXIOUS."
