# COLLEGE CHURCHES STILL EXPERIMENT SAYS DR. GARDNER
## Stanford Chapel Ideal for Non-Sectarian Training Is Pastor's Opinion 
### 
"College churches represent an ex
periment," said the Rev. D. Charles
Gardner, chaplain of Stanford Univer
sity, in a recent interview in the
Christian Science Monitor, "snd thus
far the experiment has been a suc
cess."
"The church has not embarrassed
the universities," he said. "It has used
simple methods, spiritual and construc
tive. It has avoided notoriety, and es
tablishment of a college church has
changed the character of the students."
The Memorial Church at Stanford,
in which pulpit Dr. Gardner has
preached for the last twenty-two years,
represents his idea of what a college
church should be. It was built by Mrs.
Leland Stanford, â€žwife of the founder
of the institution, primarily as a me
morial to her husband and to fulfil
one object of the University's endow
ment.
The founder's deed provides that
non-sectarian religious instruction
should be part of the work undertaken.
Following submission of designs in
1898, Mrs. Stanford toured Europe in
search of methods of decoration. The
church was dedicated in 1903 and had
been used ever since except for six
years following the earthquake of 1906
which partially destroyed the building.
Nonsectarian Services
Care of the church's destinies was
delivered immediately after its con
struction to Dr. Gardner, who has held
nonsectarian services in it ever since.
He is an Episcopalian minister, but
wears the Lutheran gown in the ser
vices, says no creed, sings from a non
sectarian song book, uses no particu
lar liturgy, and reads from a Metho
dist-translated song book.
In watching college generations
come and go, Dr. Gardner formed con
clusions about college students which
are best expressed in his declaration
that "there is among college men and
women a new appreciation of the joy
and freedom, the beauty and potency
of, the moral and spiritual life.
"The work of the college church and
the university's work do not conflict
and there is harmony. The church is
organized as a regular academic de
partment of the university, and recog
nizes that the university is of neces
sity a hot-bed of skepticism; and it
tries to unify secular knowledge in a
religious philosophy of life.
Students Not Pious
"Religion occupies about the same
place in every large university. In
France, England, Germany, and the
United States there is an old complaint
that students are not religious. They
are not pious because they have their
first opportunity for liberty, and they
find new occupations of work and play
for the time being.
"There is a native reverence for re
ligion among students, much frank dis
cussion, and the crudest ignorance of
the facts of religious history, of the
principles of Christian faith, and the
relation of religion to daily life.
"In a church of this - kind we no
sooner make the acquaintance of a
freshman than he graduates and
leaves, and because of the diversity of
religion we must build a platform
broad enough for all parties to stand
on."
Dr. Gardner sees a great change
coming about in the student bodies
with reference to their religious affili
ations. In one institution, he points out,
the percentage of students having
some church preference has increased
from 21 to 90 students the last twenty
years.
While there is a shortage of theo
logical students in the United States,
this can be remedied to some extent,
Dr. Gardner said, by adding schools
of religion to the college curriculum.
The college church such as that at
Stanford, built to serve all creed 3, can,
in the opinion of the chaplain, "have
services and sermons suitable for all
which will not offend the prejudice of
any."
