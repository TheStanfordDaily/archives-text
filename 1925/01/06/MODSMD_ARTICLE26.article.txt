# Palo Alto De Molays Plan Mid-Winter Dance Saturday
## 
### 
The winter dance of the Palo Alto
Chapter of De Molay will be given in
the Woman's Club House at Palo Alto
on Saturday evening with Whitmer's
orchestra playing for the occasion.
Under the direction of Jack Humph
rey, the committee is making plans
and promises an enjoyable dance. All
members of the De Molay and their
friends can secure bids from the Palo
Alto chapter scribe, but must do so
immediately since only a limited num
ber of the cardboards are available.

Colored jackets will be worn by the
women of the University of Minnesota
who play on the various athletic
teams. This year the freshmen will
wear green, the sophomores blue, the
juniors purple, and the seniors gold.
