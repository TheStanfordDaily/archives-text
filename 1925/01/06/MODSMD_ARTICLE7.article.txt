###

visited England, France, Poland, Swit

order named to collect material for

indicated in one country where the

secured at Prague from President
Masaryk, Foreign Minister Benes, and
the old leader of the whole Czecho
slovak movement, Kamare.
A number of important collections
of books were purchased, notably the
library of the late Dr. Fried of Vienna,

collection in Europe on efforts toward
world peace. The Fried Library in
cludes the collection of Baroness
Bertha Von Suttner, who was for a
long time the leading woman pacifist
of Europe.
Valuable newspaper files were given
by the American Library of Paris, and
a special collection of Trench papers,
issued by soldiers in the field, was
bought in Geneva. Gifts of government
documents were secured from all the
countries visited.
Professor Adams examined all the
important war collections in Europe
and states that the Hoover War Li
brary has but one rival of importaifte
