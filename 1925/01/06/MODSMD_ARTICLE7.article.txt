### 
Professor E. D. Adams of the His
tory department returned Saturday
from a six months' trip in Europe. He
visited England, France, Poland, Swit
zerland, and Czecho-Slovakia in the
order named to collect material for
the Hoover War Library.
Professor Adams secured all kinds
of material covering the Great War
and Reconstruction periods. The main
purpose of the trip was to secure from
the leading men in Europe their per
sonal diaries, correspondence, and
documents relating to the Great War,
Peace Conference, or events since the
Peace Conference.
Materials of this nature were given
to the Hoover War Library on the
pledge that they were to be retained
in the library's confidential vault and
are not to be used for a period of
twenty-five years. Professor Adams
cannot in most cases state the names
of the persons giving this type of ma
terial.
Some glimpse of its value may be
indicated in one country where the
fact of the gift was published by the
Foreign Office itself and in the French
press afterwards. Such material was
secured at Prague from President
Masaryk, Foreign Minister Benes, and
the old leader of the whole Czecho
slovak movement, Kamare.
A number of important collections
of books were purchased, notably the
library of the late Dr. Fried of Vienna,
which was the'most important private
collection in Europe on efforts toward
world peace. The Fried Library in
cludes the collection of Baroness
Bertha Von Suttner, who was for a
long time the leading woman pacifist
of Europe.
Valuable newspaper files were given
by the American Library of Paris, and
a special collection of Trench papers,
issued by soldiers in the field, was
bought in Geneva. Gifts of government
