# COACH DAVIS CUTS 145-POUND BASKET SQUAD TO NINETEEN
## 
### 
The 145-pound basketball squad re
sumed practice last night after a rest
during the Christmas vacation. In less
than two weeks the team plays its
first practice contest.
Coach Hal Davis made the final cut
of the squad and nineteen men ara
still out. The players that now com
pose the 145-pound team are: Parsons,
Stewart, Blazier, Elliot, Sibbett, Hol
stein, George, Cairns, Kunzel, Cum
mings, Frank, King, James, Schultz
berg, Dunfee, Hughes, Snook, and
Keny.
There are no regulars left from last
season's team and Davis has the task
of rebuilding a new five. There are
several men who were on last year's
squad trying out again this season for
positions. Transfers and players from
the 1927 freshmen compose the rest
of the team.
Stanford lightweights lost to Cali
fornia in last year's series. The Blue
and Gold boasts of another unbearable
quintet this season, and Davis is pre
paring his men for a hard season.
Practice will be held, five nights a
week from now until the end of the
season.
