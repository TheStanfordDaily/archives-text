# CARD DEBATERS PREPARING FOR OXFORD CLASH
## World's Best Orators Will Argue on Prohibition January 22 
### 
Stanford debaters are digging in in
preparation for what promises to be
the most unique forensic duel which
has ever been held on a Stanford plat
form —that with the Oxford University
team, generally considered to be the
best debate trio in the world, on Janu
ary 22.
Taking as their subject, "Resolved,
that this House is opposed to prohibi
tion," both sides wjll enter the contest,
not with the object of winning, but
with the aim of getting across their
respective ideas on the question. Ox
ford will uphold the affirmative and
oppose prohibition, while Stanford will
defend the negative and support the
eighteenth amendment.
When the speakers have finished the
audience will not cast their ballots for
one of the two teams but either in
favor of or opposed to prohibition.
This is the British idea of a debate,
and it differs radically from the gen
eral American conception of such a
contest.
Oxford Men Talk Informally
The Oxford men have no concern
with delivery for its own sake, but
concentrate their efforts entirely on j
what they have to say. Hence they
have adopted a very informal manner
of speaking which at times makes
their offerings take on the tone of a
vaudeville show. Malcolm Mac Donald
is the only one of the three orators
who does not diverge from legitimate
argument.
Christopher Hollis and C. H. Wood
ruff, his colleagues, converse mainly in
lighter vein. Both Mac Donald and Hol
lis are ex-presidents of the Oxford
Union, the body which corresponds
most closely to the student bodies of
American universities. The Union
holds weekly meetings to debate on
current topics of general interest.
Stanford Men Experienced
Opposing the Britishers will be Rob
ert Littler, winner of the Joffre medal,
Stanley Weigel, extemporaneous speak
ing champion of the Pacific Coast, and
Robert Lewis, a consistent winner of
intercollegiate debates for the past
three years.
With their appearance in the assem
bly hall on the 22nd the Oxford team
will complete its tour of American col
leges, in the course of which they will
have delivered thirty-four debates.
Three nights previous to their engage
ment with Stanford the visitors will
meet speakers from the University of
California at Berkeley.
An international journalistic re
search movement has been started at
Ohio State University. The object of
the research is to determine the ef
fect of newspapers on news itself. It
is also to discover to what extent
propaganda and outside causes influ
ence v: r orld events.

meet speakers from the University of
California at Berkeley.
An international journalistic re
search movement has been started at
Ohio State University. The object of
the research is to determine the ef
fect of newspapers on news itself. It
is also to discover to what extent
propaganda and outside causes influ
ence v: r orld events.
Stanford debaters are digging in in
preparation for what promises to be
the most unique forensic duel which
has ever been held on a Stanford plat
form —that with the Oxford University
team, generally considered to be the
best debate trio in the world, on Janu
ary 22.
Taking as their subject, "Resolved,
that this House is opposed to prohibi
tion," both sides wjll enter the contest,
not with the object of winning, but
with the aim of getting across their
respective ideas on the question. Ox
ford will uphold the affirmative and
oppose prohibition, while Stanford will
defend the negative and support the
eighteenth amendment.
When the speakers have finished the
audience will not cast their ballots for
one of the two teams but either in
favor of or opposed to prohibition.
This is the British idea of a debate,
and it differs radically from the gen
eral American conception of such a
contest.
Oxford Men Talk Informally
The Oxford men have no concern
with delivery for its own sake, but
concentrate their efforts entirely on j
what they have to say. Hence they
have adopted a very informal manner
of speaking which at times makes
their offerings take on the tone of a
vaudeville show. Malcolm Mac Donald
is the only one of the three orators
who does not diverge from legitimate
argument.
Christopher Hollis and C. H. Wood
ruff, his colleagues, converse mainly in
lighter vein. Both Mac Donald and Hol
lis are ex-presidents of the Oxford
Union, the body which corresponds
most closely to the student bodies of
American universities. The Union
holds weekly meetings to debate on
current topics of general interest.
Stanford Men Experienced
Opposing the Britishers will be Rob
ert Littler, winner of the Joffre medal,
Stanley Weigel, extemporaneous speak
ing champion of the Pacific Coast, and
Robert Lewis, a consistent winner of
intercollegiate debates for the past
three years.
With their appearance in the assem
bly hall on the 22nd the Oxford team
will complete its tour of American col
leges, in the course of which they will
have delivered thirty-four debates.
Three nights previous to their engage
ment with Stanford the visitors will
meet speakers from the University of
