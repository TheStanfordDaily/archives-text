# CARD DEBATERS PREPARING FOR OXFORD CLASH
## World's Best Orators Will Argue on Prohibition January 22 
### 
Stanford debaters are digging in in
preparation for what promises to be
the most unique forensic duel which
has ever been held on a Stanford plat
form —that with the Oxford University
team, generally considered to be the
best debate trio in the world, on Janu

vaudeville show. Malcolm Mac Donald
is the only one of the three orators
who does not diverge from legitimate
argument.
Christopher Hollis and C. H. Wood

Union, the body which corresponds
most closely to the student bodies of
American universities. The Union
holds weekly meetings to debate on
current topics of general interest.
Stanford Men Experienced
Opposing the Britishers will be Rob
ert Littler, winner of the Joffre medal,
Stanley Weigel, extemporaneous speak
ing champion of the Pacific Coast, and
Robert Lewis, a consistent winner of
