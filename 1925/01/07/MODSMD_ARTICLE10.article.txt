# FACULTY PLAY WILL CREATE LAUGHS IN PROFUSION
## "Torch Bearers" Combines Satire, Humor; Davis Has All-Star Cast 
### 
For the first time in the history of
Stanford University, students will have
the opportunity of laughing at a pro
fessor without any fears of flunking a
course. In other words, the faculty
members in the cast of "The Torch
Bearers," which will be presented Fri
day night in the Assembly Hall have
cast aside their traditional roles of
dignity and seriousness, and will don
the grease paint for an evening of
foolery and merriment.
Rehearsals indicate another success
' ful Davis-coached play, with every
jcharacter well cast. In a comedy of
the type of "The Torch Bearers" a
great deal depends on the precision
and swiftness with which the action
takes place, and the cast seems to
have realized this in a marked degree.
Friday night's performance will re
veal an exceptionally well developed
performance without the ragged edges
usual in an amateur production.
Paul Clyde, as Mr. Frederick Ritter,
has the most appealing role in the
play, for he is the innocent victim of
the group of "Little Theatre" enthusi
asts who care more about putting on a
play than they do about the illness or
death of any one near them. Returning
from a trip unexpectedly, he learns
that his wife has been drawn into the
group to play a part left vacant by
the death of the husband of one of
the actresses, and their determination
to produce the play at any cost amazes
him, and in turn the audience is
amazed when Clyde tumbles headlong
from the top of the stairs, and is left
lying their unconscious as the rehears
al of the play goes on.
His return to health and action in
the third act is as convincing a bit of
acting as the Stanford stage has seen
in a long time, and when he gets
through there is not much doubt as to
who rules the Ritter family.
Professor Margery Bailey is ex
tremely natural in her role of Madame
J. Duro, Pampinelli, who is the zealous
directress of the group. Her interpre
tation of the various roles in the one
act play which they are producing is
humorous in the extreme, especially
her description of the way one should
show emotion on the stage.
Professor Martin in the role of
Ralph Twiller, attempts a series of
graceful gestures with the aid of
Madame Pampinelli, with the net re
sult of a hearty laugh from the audi
ence.
