# MOON MAY BE USED FOR AGRICULTURE---HOTELLING
## 
### 
It is entirely possible that agricul- j
ture on the moon may be utilized as a
source of food for the world, according
to Dr. Harold Hotelling of the Stan
ford Food Research Institute. Dr.
Hotelling made this assertion in the
course of an address before a meeting
of the American Statistical Associa
tion held in Chicago December 29.
Man would be able to reach the
moon if a feasible method could be
discovered for harnessing the energy
obtained by breaking up the atom. If
grains of sand could be shot with suffi
cient velocity the necessary force
would be provided and man would bo
able to reach the mdon, Mars, and
other planets.
This source of power would also be
valuable in countless other ways. Dr.
, Hotelling and other scientists are
working on the problem of harnessing
this energy. Accurate knowledge of the
practical value of agriculture on the
moon as a source of food suited to

man's consumption is not available,
but there is considerable likelihood
that the crops of the lunar fields could
be profitably utilized by the earth's
inhabitants.
Synthetic Food Possible
The meeting was called to consider
chiefly the problem of a limit of the
increase of the world's population and
the available sources of food when the
population should become so dense as
to encroach upon the land now used
for agriculture. Dr. Hotelling men
tioned briefly the proposal of Dr. Carl
Alsberg of the Stanford Food Research
Institute of producing synthetic food
by artificial means.
Hydrogen, nitrogen, and other essen
tial caloric ingredients of food are
present in large quantities in water,
| air, and in the earth, and could be pre
| pared for consumption if a satisfac
! lory method of combining them in the
proper proportion were devised. In that
! event the present natural agricultural
methods would be reserved for such
foods as salads and appetizers.
Foretells Population Movements
Dr. Hotelling considers that the pres
ent sources of food will suffice for
some time to come, inasmuch as the
world's population is increasing much
more slowly at the present time than
in the past and may in time become
stationary. The lower rate is more
than offset by the lower birth rate.
He believes it entirely possible to pre
dict several years in advance the gen
eral migratory movements of people
from one section of a country to an
other.
A study of migrations during the
past century reveals regular move
ments from the centers of density of
population toward the sparsely inhab
ited areas which bear analogy to the
movement of heat as stated in laws of
physics.
Advances New Theory
Though his address before the Amer
ican Statistical Association was per
haps more interesting to the general
public. Dr. Hotelling considers the
paper which he read before a meeting
of the western section of the American
Mathematical Society in Chicago on
December 26 to be of greater import
ance.
Taking as his subject, "Depreciation
and Other Economical Problems In
volving Maximums of Functionals" he
showed that the present methods of
calculating the depreciation on re
placeable assets such as machinery
and and irreplaceable assets
such as mines are incorrect, and in
some instances admit of considerable
error. He discussed and explained a
new method of calculation which em
bodis geometric principles generally
considered inapplicable to such a prob
lem, and showed them to be accurate.

the evening of the same day Dr. Hotel

Synthetic Food Possible
The meeting was called to consider
chiefly the problem of a limit of the
increase of the world's population and
the available sources of food when the
population should become so dense as
to encroach upon the land now used
for agriculture. Dr. Hotelling men
tioned briefly the proposal of Dr. Carl
Alsberg of the Stanford Food Research
Institute of producing synthetic food
by artificial means.
Hydrogen, nitrogen, and other essen
tial caloric ingredients of food are
present in large quantities in water,
| air, and in the earth, and could be pre
| pared for consumption if a satisfac
! lory method of combining them in the
proper proportion were devised. In that
! event the present natural agricultural
methods would be reserved for such
foods as salads and appetizers.
Foretells Population Movements
Dr. Hotelling considers that the pres
ent sources of food will suffice for
some time to come, inasmuch as the
world's population is increasing much
more slowly at the present time than
in the past and may in time become
stationary. The lower rate is more
than offset by the lower birth rate.
He believes it entirely possible to pre
dict several years in advance the gen
eral migratory movements of people
from one section of a country to an
other.
A study of migrations during the
past century reveals regular move
ments from the centers of density of
population toward the sparsely inhab
ited areas which bear analogy to the
movement of heat as stated in laws of
physics.
Advances New Theory
Though his address before the Amer
ican Statistical Association was per
haps more interesting to the general
public. Dr. Hotelling considers the
paper which he read before a meeting
of the western section of the American
Mathematical Society in Chicago on
December 26 to be of greater import
ance.
Taking as his subject, "Depreciation
and Other Economical Problems In
volving Maximums of Functionals" he
showed that the present methods of
calculating the depreciation on re
placeable assets such as machinery
and and irreplaceable assets
such as mines are incorrect, and in
some instances admit of considerable
error. He discussed and explained a
new method of calculation which em
bodis geometric principles generally
considered inapplicable to such a prob
lem, and showed them to be accurate.
At the banquet of the society held on
the evening of the same day Dr. Hotel
ling delivered an informal talk.
It is entirely possible that agricul- j
ture on the moon may be utilized as a
source of food for the world, according
to Dr. Harold Hotelling of the Stan
ford Food Research Institute. Dr.
Hotelling made this assertion in the
course of an address before a meeting
of the American Statistical Associa
tion held in Chicago December 29.
Man would be able to reach the
moon if a feasible method could be
discovered for harnessing the energy
obtained by breaking up the atom. If
grains of sand could be shot with suffi
cient velocity the necessary force
would be provided and man would bo
able to reach the mdon, Mars, and
other planets.
This source of power would also be
valuable in countless other ways. Dr.
, Hotelling and other scientists are
working on the problem of harnessing
this energy. Accurate knowledge of the
practical value of agriculture on the
moon as a source of food suited to

man's consumption is not available,
but there is considerable likelihood
that the crops of the lunar fields could
be profitably utilized by the earth's
inhabitants.
