# MOON MAY BE USED FOR AGRICULTURE---HOTELLING

### 
It is entirely possible that agricul- j
ture on the moon may be utilized as a
source of food for the world, according
to Dr. Harold Hotelling of the Stan
ford Food Research Institute. Dr.
Hotelling made this assertion in the
course of an address before a meeting
of the American Statistical Associa
tion held in Chicago December 29.
Man would be able to reach the
moon if a feasible method could be
discovered for harnessing the energy
obtained by breaking up the atom. If
grains of sand could be shot with suffi
cient velocity the necessary force
would be provided and man would bo
able to reach the mdon, Mars, and
other planets.
This source of power would also be
valuable in countless other ways. Dr.
, Hotelling and other scientists are
working on the problem of harnessing
this energy. Accurate knowledge of the
practical value of agriculture on the
moon as a source of food suited to

man's consumption is not available,
but there is considerable likelihood
that the crops of the lunar fields could
be profitably utilized by the earth's
inhabitants.
Synthetic Food Possible
The meeting was called to consider
chiefly the problem of a limit of the
increase of the world's population and
the available sources of food when the
population should become so dense as
to encroach upon the land now used
for agriculture. Dr. Hotelling men
tioned briefly the proposal of Dr. Carl
Alsberg of the Stanford Food Research
Institute of producing synthetic food
by artificial means.
Hydrogen, nitrogen, and other essen
tial caloric ingredients of food are
present in large quantities in water,
| air, and in the earth, and could be pre
| pared for consumption if a satisfac
! lory method of combining them in the
proper proportion were devised. In that
! event the present natural agricultural
