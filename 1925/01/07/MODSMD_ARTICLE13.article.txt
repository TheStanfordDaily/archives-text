# ROUGHS' SEATS WILL BRING PREMIUM AT CAST DANCE FRIDAY
## 
### 
Establishing a precedent for after
the-show dances, roughs' seats on the
window ledges of the Women's Club
house next Friday night will be sold
for 25c apiece.
1 he management of the dance feels
that this represents the value of such
locations, since from these positions
the apple-polishing roughs may shout
their congratulations and well-wishes
to the faculty actors. Before selling
any tickets, however, every rough must
present his last quarter's report card,
and anyone who received lower than
a C grade from any professor in the
show will be thoroughly searched for
concealed weapons and a statement of
intentions will be demanded.
