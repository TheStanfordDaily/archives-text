# RAM'S HEAD SHOW TRYOUTS COMMENCE TOMORROW AT 3:30
## All Men on Campus Eligible; Dancers, Cartoonists In Demand 
### 
Tryouts for Ram's Head annual musi
cal burlesque will be held tomorrow
and Friday, according to Dave Mannoc
cir, director. They will take place from
3:30 to G in the Women's Clubhouse
and from 7 to 10 in the Little Theatre
for both cast and chorus.
Every man on the campus is eligible,
says Mannoccir, and his call for try
outees is extended particularly to
freshmen. Two of the freshman class
starred in leading roles last year and
Mannoccir believes that there is prom
ising material among the 1928 class.
Specialties and music are also in
cluded in his "Help Wanted" plea for
it has been planned to make this year's
show one of variety. Dancers, car
toonists, and other specialty men are
asked to see Mannoccir at once for
possible roles in the production.
Fred "Chubby" Tyroler, who has
been named musical director, has be
gun work immediately on the selection
of musical numbers. He has also put
in a call for more music and tune
writers should see him before 6 p.m.,
Friday.
No selection of the chorus director
has been made yet by the committee.
This depends in part, according to
Mannoccir, on the type of chorus work
to be used. It is possible that the
chorus numbers will consist of Rus
sian and Turkish dances and, if so,
the committee wishes to engage a spe
cial director for such work.
