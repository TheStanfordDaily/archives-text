# VARSITY QUINTET IN FIRST CAGE MATCH TONIGHT
## San Jose Teachers College Will Tangle With New Card Five 
### Wilbur Adams 
Tonight at 8 o'clock in the Stanford
pavilion the 1925 basketball season
will be formally opened. The Stanford
varsity tossers meet a quintet from
the San Jose Teachers' College. This
is the first basketball contest in this
section this year.
The Teachers do not boast of a par
ticularly strong five, but they have
been practicing together for many
months and are working in team-like
manner. The Cardinal squad suffered
from a long football season which
made the first organized practice only
two days ago. With such a short prac
tice, the men are not expected to play
up to form tonight.
Nevers Still Out
It is doubtful whether Ernie Nevers'
ankle will permit him to start the
game tonight. The injury slows up his
pivoting and turning to some extent.
The husky forward will see some ac
tion later in the game. Although
Nevers' ankle is rapidly mending, the
basketball court proved to be harder
on the injury than the gridiron.
Nelson David and Fred Price are
expected to start at forward. Price and
David were team-mates on the victori
ous 1927 quinfet, and they work well
together. Should Nevers start the
game, Price may be used at running
guard. Riese, Coen, and Alexander are
the first call substitutes for the for
ward line.
At running guard will be found
"Mugs" Mitchell if the Price-David
combination starts at forward. Mitchell
played in many of the contests last
season as a substitute for Mcßurney.
Monday was his first night on the
court this season, as he was engaged
on the football field until then.
Ted Shipkey may be seen at the
running guard position before the game
is over. Harry Shipkey, reserve guard
last year, has not reported for practice
as yet this season.
Oliva Ready for Action
The job at standing guard will be
taken care of by Captain Dave Oliva,
