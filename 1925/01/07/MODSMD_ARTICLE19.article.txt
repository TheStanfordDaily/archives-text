# ART GALLERY HAS EXHIBIT OF SCENES IN RUSSIAN REVOLT
## 
### 
From thte archives of the Hoover
I War Library the management of the
! Stanford Art Gallery obtained for its
i exhibit of the hour one of the most
| touching and fascinating sets of pic-
I tures yet shown in the Gallery. Thirty
four scenes of life in Russia during
the revolutionary period through
which it has just passed are now on
! the walls.
Painted by an artist whose name
1 canont be divulged for reasons appar
| ent to one who sees the watercolors
these pictures have a glamour of ro
mance about them. I3rutal. harsh notes
predominate in all save one.
Scenes depicting the Red Army re
quisitioning food and cattle from peas
ants, a mob rampant in the winter
palace of the czar, daily life under a
I communistic regime, all these things
! showing from real life the results of a
government and system which has
; literally jarred history.
From an artistic point of view the
j pictures are merely average; their
chief value lies in their historical
interest. However, in one scene, that
|of the burial of a father of a small,
poor family, the artist goes into detail
| showing a dexterity in handling the
brush, which is but hinted at in the
other pictures.
The exhibit will remain in the gal
lery for two more weeks.
