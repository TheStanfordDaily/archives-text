# Minor Sports

### 
"Pop" Warner, peerless in football instruction, has stepped aside
for the time being. Basketball will hcfld center stage during most of the
quarter, with baseball and track gathering headway for their usual show
ing after Easter.
But basketball is not so selfish, so colossal, as football. Winter is
the time for minor sports-—many of them —on water and land. And in
this connection it is impossible to pass over the Stanford coaching staff
for these minor sports.
Take Harry Maloney first. He carries perhaps the heaviest burden,
and performs best when under heavy fire. During the slump in Stanford
athletics, Maloney's soccer, boxing, fencing, wrestling, and other cir
cle "S" teams were carrying the Cardinal successfully into battle, and he
was directing and training more than the usual number of players. He
trained rugby men, after the University returned to the American game,
and trained them to beat California and to represent the United States
abroad. It will be a long time before Harry Maloney's influence ceases
to be felt in California and international rugby. And this last summer
he coached the tennis team through a worth-while tour of Australia.
Versatile? That's Harry.
And Ernie Brandsten. His swimming and water polo teams play
California as a matter of course, and beat them likewise. True, the
Bruins have been hampered by inaccessibility of a proper tank for prac
tice, but the world-wide name of Brandsten-trained divers serves to off
set this. One champion diver would please most swimming coaches;
Ernie is always preparing the next one. Likewise in water polo. It
doesn't take the freshmen long to pick up the fine points of the duckings.
Both these men are ideal examples of the real place for athletics in
universities. They direct a very great number of men, they instill sports
manship, and they build health. It is the policy of the greatest good for
the greatest number —and the greatest good is, through the ability of
these minor sport coaches, easily made to include victories for Stanford.
