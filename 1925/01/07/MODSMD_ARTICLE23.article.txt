# Stadium Expansion
## 
### 
Though no definite plans have been so far formulated by the Board
of Athletic Control, it is obvious that some means of taking care of future
crowds must be adopted, this year if possible. There were almost one
hundred thousand people within eye-shot of the Berkeley playing field last
November, and what those people saw will bring them back for a number
of years, with all the relatives who are fortunate enough to obtain tickets.
The Stanford stadium was rushed through to completion in a short
time, and merges into the landscape in accordance with the University plan
of architectural unity throughout. It is not imposing in the metropolitan
senseâ€”its beauty lies in extreme simplicity, and fitness in relation to its
surroundings.
When the necessary expansion takes place, it would be well to bear
this in mind. The increase in seating capacity must be made, but the
stadium should not be turned into a nest of steel girders and concrete
pillars. Not unless it proves, eventually, to be absolutely necessary.
ONLY EIGHTY flunk-outs this quarter. Not so long ago, a
record of over three hundred was established. The harder it is to stay
in, the harder it hurts to flunk out, it would seem.
