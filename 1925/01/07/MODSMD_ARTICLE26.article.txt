"Ravings Based on the 'Bawlout'."
Being equipped with a pair of eyes
and ability to use them one may, by
wasting some time, find much of in
terest in the w.k. pocket-edition of our
own little "Bawlout." After one gets
through staring at his girl's name for
several minutes and begins seriously
to look for the humor not intended to
be put in that little brochure, lots of
things become evident. F'r instance,
did you know that thirteen means of
gaining a livelihood are mentioned in
the little booklet? No?
We have with us a Tanner, nine
Bakers (and they Bakewell!), eleven
Taylors, a Barker, a Barber, thirty
three Smiths, fourteen Cooks, four
Masons, nineteen Millers, a Sadler,
two Sawyers, three Gardners, and a
Miner.
While this list is not exactly repre
sentative of the industrial fields open
as a whole to ambitious Stanford stu
dents and graduates we thought it
would be at least suggestive, although
not in such a way that Chappie could
take issue with us.
* * *
With the two Parks we can make
quite an amusement place out of this
University's campus. A little research
work reveals the fact that our Parks
would have exactly two Acres of
ground—not very large, but enough.
For the exterior decorating neces
sary our three Gardners would come
in handy in assisting us to plant the
Elms and to clear off our only Field.
A glance shows us that though we
have but one Forrest—and a couple of
Lanes to go with it —we have five
Hills. Both a Poole and a Pond are
available for our only Fisher. Three
Brooks, a Glen, and a Marsh complete
the landscape.
The Masons and two Carpenters
could be kept busy repairing the
Barnes, the Halls, and the Towers. No
machinists are available, however, to
keep the four Fords and three Pages
in running order.
* • *
Though Stanford is reputedly a
democratic school it has thirteen
Kings, a Prince, but no Queens. Only
one Knight is in the court and he has
a suit of Armour and a Speer.
* * *
Colors? Several colors and many
shades thereof are available for what
ever purpose we may need them.
Twenty shades of Brown, three of
Green, and four of Rose. There is only
one Black, of course, but; mirable
dictu, eleven Whites are mentioned.
We could rave on forever mention
ing anything from Foxes, Lambs,
Clocks, Wolfs, Robbins, Popes, Streets,
Graves and Coffins, to Spring and Fall.

Colors? Several colors and many
shades thereof are available for what
ever purpose we may need them.
Twenty shades of Brown, three of
Green, and four of Rose. There is only
one Black, of course, but; mirable
dictu, eleven Whites are mentioned.
We could rave on forever mention
ing anything from Foxes, Lambs,
Clocks, Wolfs, Robbins, Popes, Streets,
Graves and Coffins, to Spring and Fall.

"Ravings Based on the 'Bawlout'."
Being equipped with a pair of eyes
and ability to use them one may, by
wasting some time, find much of in
terest in the w.k. pocket-edition of our
own little "Bawlout." After one gets
through staring at his girl's name for
several minutes and begins seriously
to look for the humor not intended to
be put in that little brochure, lots of
things become evident. F'r instance,
did you know that thirteen means of
gaining a livelihood are mentioned in
the little booklet? No?
We have with us a Tanner, nine
Bakers (and they Bakewell!), eleven
Taylors, a Barker, a Barber, thirty
three Smiths, fourteen Cooks, four
Masons, nineteen Millers, a Sadler,
two Sawyers, three Gardners, and a
Miner.
While this list is not exactly repre
sentative of the industrial fields open
as a whole to ambitious Stanford stu
dents and graduates we thought it
would be at least suggestive, although
not in such a way that Chappie could
take issue with us.

With the two Parks we can make
quite an amusement place out of this
University's campus. A little research
work reveals the fact that our Parks
would have exactly two Acres of
ground—not very large, but enough.
For the exterior decorating neces
sary our three Gardners would come
in handy in assisting us to plant the
Elms and to clear off our only Field.
A glance shows us that though we
have but one Forrest—and a couple of
Lanes to go with it —we have five
Hills. Both a Poole and a Pond are
available for our only Fisher. Three
Brooks, a Glen, and a Marsh complete
the landscape.
The Masons and two Carpenters
could be kept busy repairing the
Barnes, the Halls, and the Towers. No
machinists are available, however, to
keep the four Fords and three Pages
in running order.

Though Stanford is reputedly a
democratic school it has thirteen
Kings, a Prince, but no Queens. Only
one Knight is in the court and he has
a suit of Armour and a Speer.
