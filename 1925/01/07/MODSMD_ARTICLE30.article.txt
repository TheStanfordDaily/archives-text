"Let's have a block here. You put
it; I can't," says Orville Dewey, 6-year
old patient at the Stanford Convale
scent Home ;
Orville likes to build houses. He
demands structure after structure, but
he is always only the architect, never
the builder, for he canot control his
hand enough to put one cubic inch
block on another. He knows that his
blundering atempts will knock over
the structure, and rarely tries to ac
complish anything himself, although
his enthusiasm over the project on
hand is unlimited.
When Orville first came to the Con
valescent Home his nervous condition
was such that he could not even stand
up. Now he can walk, and is able to
grasp objects, though not to place
small things precisely. His condition
has been enormously improved at the
Home. His imagination "is keen, and
his play intelligent.
