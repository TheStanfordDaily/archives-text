# ORIGINAL HARD LUCK CASE DISCOVERED AT REGISTRAR'S OFFICE
## 
### 
A genuine case of hard luck has de
| veloped at the registrar's office as a
result of a senior who sought to gradu
ate at the end of the quarter just past.
Upon counting the unfortunate's units
O. L. JOlliott, registrar, found that the
would-be graduate lacked one unit of
the required one hundred and eighty.
Feverish counting and recounting
failed to bring another hour to light.
This piece of luck or rather lack of
luck is bound to become historic as
such, and at the same time a worth
while warning. All of which, however,
fails to help the unfortunate one.
N. B. Anyone finding a loose hour
please return same to the registrar's
office.
