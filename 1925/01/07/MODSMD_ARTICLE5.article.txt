# FACULTY REPORTS DIM OUTLOOK FOR BABE BASKETBALL
## Five Freshman Hoop Stars Are Declared Ineligible To Compete 
### 
I Freshman basketball prospects were
considerably dimmed when the faculty
axe deleted the names of five of
"Husky" Hunt's most precious charges.
Among those declared ineligible are
Hawley, Dorcy, Altaffer, Rupe, and
Young.
According to the looks of the turn
out at practice yesterday there is a
hard grind ahead if the babes wish to
annex the title this year. Although it
will be a hard one, it will not be an
impossible one.
This year the squad lacks the out
standing stars that it possessed last
season but the list of aspirants in
cludes a great many capable of de
veloping into good players.
At present, Hunt is holding daily
scrimmages to pick out the best of
these. A few men have been dropped
from the squad roll so far but a larger
cut is expected after the game with
Salinas next Saturday.
The entire week will be spent in
lining up a fair team for this game and
after that the real periods of instruc
tion will begin. Hunt should easily
be able to win over Salinas and other
high schools on the schedule which
will all go toward giving his men the
necessary experience for the Califor
nia series.
The great weakness of the squad at
present is at center position. Dennis,
King, Canfield, and Guthrie all loom
strongly as contenders in the race but
one of them will have to snap into
some real form before they can equal
Jayred's work last year.
