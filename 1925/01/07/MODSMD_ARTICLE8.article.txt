# WELSH SINGERS TO GIVE CONCERT IN ASSEMBLY HALL
## Palo Alto Elks Sponsors for Tomorrow's Concert by Noted Glee Club 
### 
The Rhondda Welsh Singers, under
the direction of Professor Thomas
Morgan, will give a concert in the
Assembly Hall tomorrow night under
the auspices of the Palo Alto Elks.
Solos, part songs, quartets, and duets
will be included in the program. The
chorus of fourteen voices will be ac
companied by EmTyn Jones. The great
variety of the program will interest
those who are not highly trained musi
cally; while the solos of the individual
singers are the feature of the concert.
Coming from a successful tour of
Canada and the Northwest where they
won renown, the Welsh Singers are
now touring California. The musical
critic of the Sacrafhento Bee, where
they sang recently, writes: "Probably
the highest and truest praise that can
be given the chorus is to say that the
hearer closing the eyes would think
one instrument or one great human
voice of splendid compass produced
the music.
"To the untrained musical ear the
variety of the program, with its ora
torio numbers and college glee club
songs, and in addition the fine solos
of the individual singers, is an ex
tremely pleasing feature."
Tickets will be on sale at the box
office tomorrow night. Price one dollar.
