# "PUBLIC SENTIMENT ABOUT MEXICO NOT UNIFIED," DIETRICH
## Fourteen Months Spent in Country Described In Lecture 
### 
"American public opinion of Mexico
is not unified," said Professor W. F.
Dietrich, of the Mining and Metallurgy
department, in his lecture last night
on the "Economic Conditions in
Mexico.' 1
"It takes longer than a few weeks'
trip to see into conditions in the coun
try," he continued. "I spent fourteen
months there, but I would rather dis
cuss impressions than economic con
ditions as such."
Economic Problem to Solve
Many persons realize that the Amer
ican government has a real economic
problem to solve, some believing in the
complete subjugation of Mexico by
our nation, while others hold a more
altruistic? idea, and wish to better the
conditions, according to Dietrich.
Throughout history Mexico has never
been ruled by an altruistic govern
ment; so-it is difficult for a Mexican
to believe any other country can be
governed by other than officials with
grasping motives. The natives hold the
Mexican War as evidence in favor of
this view, saying the United States
took territory away from her.
"Some day perhaps we're going to
attack the country," he declared. "In
Mexico many battles are won by bluif
or bravado. The inhabitants feel they
must be prepared to display this vir
tue at any time, and are suspicious of
our atittude.
Wants to Work Out Salvation
"In general Mexico wants to be free
to work out her own salvation. She is
glad of the protection of America from
European invasion, but she doesn't
care to admit it."
The second view Dietrich described
was to drive Mexico out of'our minds,
and quit the country, letting them
work out their own destinies in any
maner they desired. Some Americans
feel it would be better to establish re
lations with them when they find they
need our assistance, but not before.
"It is hard to realize the living
standards of the peons," he stated.
""The racial stock is largely Indian,
with a mixture of Spanish, and other
European races. The people are Indian
in their likes and dislikes."
Live in Adobe Huts
They live in adobe huts which, in
most cases, have no flooring, windows,
or door, and but little furniture. Sixty
to seventy-five per cent of the popula
tion lives in this way and few com
munities have a safe water supply."
Cleanliness in marketing is unheard
of, according to Dietrich. Vegetables
are grown in infected land, watered
with an infected supply, picked by
dirty hands, and sold in open markets,
where there is no protection from dust
and disease.
"Statistics in Mexico are hard to ob
tain," he declared. "Accurate figures
are almost unknown, but the general
impression is that the native born be
come more or less immune to typhoid,
and the other diseases, which are
found in many sections.
"The Mexican ideal of civilization
doesn't provide for betterment, for sel
dom is anything completed in the way
of good works. Officials would rather

put the money in their own pockets."
Dietrich described his experience of
being between two gunfires. On one
side were the attacking rebels, and
on th other, the federals, who were at
tempting to hold their part of the city.
A number of slides were shoivn of
pleasure resorts, gardens, pyramids of
adobe bricks, the market place-?, and
interiors of the mines of Mexico.
