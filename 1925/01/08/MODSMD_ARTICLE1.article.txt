# VARSITY FIVE SQUEEZES THROUGH 16 TO 13 VICTORY OVER TEACHERS
## David, Mitchell, and Price Show Class In First Trial at New Positions 
### David Meiklejohn 
STANFORD'S "new" basketball quintet went through a ragged session with
the San Jose Teachers College quintet last night and emerged with honor
points on the long end of a 1G to 13 victory.
On the surface it appeared to be somewhat lacking in the stuff that goes
to make a basketball game exciting and worth putting aside the peanuts. It
had its redeeming features, however. In the first' place Stanford won the
game, and this is saying a great deal considering the limited time that Andy
Kerr has been able to work with the team. In the second place three men who
started the game loom up as not at all bad prospects for a season which has
all the appearances of being a cross-word puzzle all in itself.
The teachers rather outdid themselves in the first part of the game and
accumulated a neat 6 to 0 lead on the Cards, which was neither terribly
foreboding or interesting; because Stanford came through as everyone ex
pected, and managed to lead in the first half, 10 to 9.
The entire weakness of the Cards lay, no doubt, in the fact that there were
four new men working with each other in the first game. There were some
indecisions, bad dribbling, poor passing; all to be expected in the first game.

Price Scores First
Price scored the first goal for Stan
ford on a neat pass from David, and
gave the Cards their start. David fol
lowed soon after with another basket
and evened the score a little later on
two nicely directed field goals. The
visitors went ahead, 9 to 8, on a free
ehot, but Oliva ended the half with
Stanford ahead by shooting his first
characteristic long shot of the season.
The second half was a millenium of
fumbles and missed goals; Stanford
managed to mark up six more points
and keep the Teachers down to thir
teen points.
The showing of Price, David, and
Mitchell was outstanding throughout
the game. David, especially, seems due
to make a first place for himself on
the varsity this year. Mitchell did
some good work as running guard and
is not at all a bad prospect to fill the
place of Mc√üurney.
