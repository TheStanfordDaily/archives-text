# Old Boy Mobilizes His Cohorts for Next Issue; January 15 Is Deadline
## 
### 
In stern commanding tones, the Old
Boy asks the campus artists and
pseudo-artists to rally round the old
standard. The next issue of Chaparral
is in process of preparation, and draw
ings must be in early so that cuts
may be prepared.
Some artistic hunches are on tap
and those aspiring (and perspiring)
gentlemen who have no ideas, may
possibly draw a prize suitable for de
velopment into a good picture.
Start contributing now so that no
one will get ahead of you. The dead
line on artistic material is the fifteenth
of this, the current month, January.
