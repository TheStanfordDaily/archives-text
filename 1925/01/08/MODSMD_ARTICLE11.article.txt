# Police Force Efficiency Revealed in Recovery Of Valuable Treasure
## 
### 
Four automobiles, and a regular Cap
tain Kidd treasure were unearthed
during the Christmas Holidays by
Deputy Sheriff Fred Frehe and the
Palo Alto police force.
The men were not out on a treasure
hunt or anything—it was just the re
covery of considerable loot gathered
by five sixteen-year-old Palo Alto
grammar school boys, according to po
lice reports.
All the sleuthing that finally led to
the recoveries was started when one
of the youngsters was caught going
through George Baker's car for tools,
or what have you, during the early
hours of one morning.
A partial list of the recovered utili
ties Includes one Ford automobile bo
longing to Itoscoe Thomas, Ford« be
longing to Les Drown and Will King,
a Dodge roadster of Scott King's, and
a flock of tools.
Further listing included half a dozen
' slide rules, several binders, fountain
1 pens, more books, and still more inci-
I dentals.
