# "TORCH BEARERS" READY FOR CURTAIN TOMORROW
## Dress Rehearsal Proves Faculty Show Up To Student Production Standards 
### 
SPEEDING up the action with each rehearsal, the cast of "The Torch
Bearers," the faculty play to be presented tomorrow night, is entering the
stretch leading toward the final performance with increasing skill and smooth
ness of acting.
Last night's dress rehearsal proved to a small but select audience that the
Stanford faculty can produce a show that will be in every way as good as any
student production. Time and again the action had to be delayed while the
handful of people out front calmed down and stopped laughing long enough
for the actors to give a few more speeches.
Professors Bassett and Poster will prove the comedy hits of the show, with
Professor Martin not far behind. Professor Foster has a mobility of facial
expression and sense df comedy which is irresistibly funny. Professor Bassett
as an extremely hard-boiled stage manager will bring down the house with
his rough-and-ready methods of dealing with the amateur thespians.
Professor Margery Bailey in the role of Madame J. Duro Pampinelli is
given an opportunity to display her talent as a burlesque artist, and her
attitude toward her "art" and anything which thwarts her desire provides
some of the most hilarious comedy of the play. As she says in the second act,

"A performance is never interrupted
merely because one of the actors hap
pens to die."
Mrs. Adams Skillful
Mrs. E. D. Adams has a role that
requires perhaps more skill to enact
than any other, because it is not the
same burlesque type as the rest of
the parts. She has a smoothness and
ease in acting which has a distinctly
professional touch, and a remarkably
clear and resonant voice.
Mrs. D. L. Webster, in the role of
"poor dear Clara $heppard," whose
husband had the inconsideration to die
just as she was about to make her
debut on the stage, will bring tears to
the eyes of the audience with her emo
tional upheavals in the second act.
Decidedly, the faculty show will be
well worth seeing, not only from the
standpoint of entertainment but also
for the opportunity of seeing a group
of otherwise serious-minded college
professors disporting themselves in,
the burlesque roles which make up the
broad comedy of "The Torch Bearers."
