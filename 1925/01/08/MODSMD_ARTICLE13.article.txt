# WILBUR SPEAKS ON COMMUNITY CHEST PLAN TO EUPHRONIA
## 
### 
President Wilbur addressed Eupliro
nia society last night on the subject
of "The Community Chest Idea" with
especial reference to San Francisco's
chest. William Gosslin, president of
the club, introduced Dr. Wilbur as a !
former member of Euphronia.
The speech was given as a result of
first-hand knowledge, as Wilbur has j
been chairman of the Organizations ;
Council of the San Francisco Com
munity Chest for the past three years
and is one of the leaders of the move
ment. He said: "The appeal for funds
is to be made this time chiefly by
speakers as this has been found more
effective than poster display and
pamphlet distribution. Every possible i
audience will be spoken to by repre--
sentatives of the Community Chest."
Social service and relief conditions
in San Francisco, before the new plan
was put into effect, were confused and 1
inefficient, according to President Wil
bur. Continual appeals for funds were
being made by the many charity or
j ganizations, and the cost of collecting
j the money was often between twenty
!five and fifty cents per dollar, leaving
| only a part for actual charity. Many
unworthy organizations and even im
i postors deceived the public into giv
ing them money, and the work of many
charities overlapped.
Contributions Pooled
About one hundred and three organi
zations representing different religions
and educational institutions were com
bined after some difficulty. Their con
tributions are now pooled in a com
mon fund so that the citizen sends his
| entire charitable contribution each
year directly to the chest, from which
it is divided among the organizations,
according to a carefully worked budget
system.
"The Community Chest is an Ameri
can idea," said Wilbur. "It is in effect
i in about one hundred cities in this
country. Oakland, Berkeley, San Fran
j cisco, and Los Angeles all have it. It
has been successful in eliminating
nearly all the professional street beg
ging, and imposition by unworthy ap
! plicants."
Many questions were answered by
! the speaker regarding the working of
! the system. Announcement was made
of next week's meeting to be held
Tuesday night in the Trophy Room of
the Old Union. The topic of discussion
will be "Professionalism in Athletics."
j Coaches "Husky" Hunt and Andy Kerr
will speak on the Ã¼bject, and letters
! giving student opinions will be read.
