# TRYOUTS FOR RAM'S HEAD BURLESQUE TO CONTINUE TONIGHT
## Mannoccir Asks for 100 Men; Vocal Ability Not Needed In Number of Parts 
### 
Tryouts for Ram's Head Burlesque
were begun this afternoon in the Wo
men's "Clubhouse and will continue to
night and tomorrow. Tryoutees should
appear tonight from 7 to 10 in the
Little Theatre, and tomorrow at the
Clubhouse from 3:30 to 6 p.m. and
7 to 10 p.m.
Freshmen are especially wanted by
Dave Mannoccir, director, for he is
certain a great quantity of new ma
terial is to be discovered. The tryouts
are easy and simple, and cover both
cast and chorus work so that the try
outee has a choice of roles.
Special Performers Needed
Following a consultation last night
with Dan Evans and Mike Ely, authors
of the libretto, Mannoccir has an
nounced that a Russian motif will be
used in the production, involving a
great many Russian dances and songs.
For this reason, he is again urgently
calling for special dancers and musi
cians—among the latter, banjo or man
dolin players being wanted.
I
"The cast is very large," said Man
noccir yesterday," and for this reason
we will be able to use nearly a hun
dred men. Contrary to the usual quali
fications, a majority of the leading roles
are not heavily burdened with both
singing and speaking parts, but call
for proficiency in only one capacity—
either musical or acting."
"Chubby" Tyroler, musical director,
is still in need of good musical num
bers. Song-writers should see him or
Mannoccir with their compositions be
fore Friday night at the latest.
All selections, both of the cast and
chorus, will be posted outside Gordon
Davis' office, the Green Room, and pub
| lished Monday in the Daily.
