# VARSITY NINE MEETS FACULTY AND STAFF PLAYERS TOMORROW
## National League Star Has Signed to Play with Faculty Team 
### 
After one day of official practice the
varsity baseball team will tangle with the
faculty nine on the varsity diamond at
3 o'clock tomorrow afternoon.
Several of the men have been in prac
tice for some time, but this afternoon was
the first official turnout of all the 1925
prospective material. Six of last year's
varsity lettermen reported, also many of
the 1927 freshman team.
Starting the season with a rush, the
varsity accepted the faculty challenge to
nine innings for tomorrow afternoon and
at once set to work building up a good
working combination.
Football Stars Out
Woltcr and Captain "Chuck" Johnston
are lining up an experienced bunch to go
in against the faculty. All the football
stars seem to have suddenly turned strong
baseball fans. Solomon, Cuddeback, Jim
Lawson, and all the boys are out after a
place on the nine.
The faculty will no doubt show the lack
of practice and training, but there are
many stars signed to perform for them.
"Johnny" Couch, a former student, and
now with the Philadelphia Nationals, will
do the twirling and Cook Sypher will be
on the receiving end.
The line-up looks a lot more like a
bunch of the varsity graduates than a
faculty, but most of them are in some
way connected with the staff.
C. W. Davis on First
C. W. Davis will cover first, and Dink
Templeton is to hold down the second
sack. Milo and Hackendorf are taking
shortstop and third, and Jim Kelley, Def
febach and Pratt will cover the outfield.
Harry Wolter refuses to go in the fac
ulty lineup against the varsity. He will
sit on the sidelines and use this game as a
good workout before the varsity's first
game which is scheduled for next Wed
nesday with Iceland's Independents.
The game Wednesday will really be the
opener of the varsity season and will be
followed with a long schedule of games
leading up to the California series next
spring.
