evidence.
Hunt tried a new combination in the
forward position that seemed to work
out very well. Cliff Moore and Irving
Hye went well together and showed
good floor work. Vincenti and Hosom
worked out against them, and no doubt
the starting forwards next Saturday
■will be picked from this quartet.
The squad is better off at the guard
position. Bill Clark, Don Hill, and J.

prep school reputation behind him, at
present is one of the best workers on
the squad.
Davidson, of football fame, is mak
ing a good bid for the standing guard
post, and "Windy" Bigelow, brother of

days of practice.
