# Precincts Possible?
## 
### 
For years, the number of students who have voted at campus elections
has averaged well under fifty per cent of the number eligible to cast a
ballot. The result of such an election could scarcely be called a reflection
of campus opinion. Yet, aside from urging students to exercise their
right, there has been little done to encourage voting.
It is not easy to vote in a campus election. The process involves.stand
ing in line for a considerable time during that part of the day when most
students are in,the greatest hurry. Persons who have wanted to vote have
often been forced to leave the line in order to get to class on time. A far
greater number have never cared to try to cast their ballots. The present
system is inconvenient and inefficient.
There afe not enough voting places, and the polls are not open long
enough. Both of these difficulties are easily remedied. A precinct system,
modified to suit the campus needs, might be established without too much
difficulty and the polls might remain open any convenient length of time.
Palo Alto students might continue to use the Quad booths. Sequoia,
Encina, Toyon, Branner and Roble Halls should have separate places to
vote and at least two polling places should be established on Lasuen and
Salvatierra streets for the living groups in that section.
No change would have to be made in the bawl-out system for checking
against repeaters, for students would be required to vote in the precinct
in which they live.
Precinct representation would not necessarily have to be adopted. The
results of the voting at each polling place might be added together, deter
mine the campus majority and no fundamental change would be necessary.
The total women's vote is now added to the men's in this fashion.
Advantages of this scheme are obvious. Those who do not have
classes near the Romanic Languages Building and who therefore often do
not vote there, would have the opportunity to vote near home, where they
go for meals, at least, three times daily. Long lines would be eliminated
because there would be more polling places. The greater convenience
would stimulate balloting.
Voting is more of a privilege than a duty. The duty falls on the ad
ministration and it is to see that as many as possible exercise their priv
ilege of voting. This may be a constructive step.
A month remains for the Election Board to consider the possibilities of
this suggestion for use in the next election. If that is too short a time ill
which to make arrangements, the system might be tested the following
time. â€”H. B. R.
