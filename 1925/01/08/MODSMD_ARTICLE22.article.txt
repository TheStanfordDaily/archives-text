Under the guise of a "news" story, yesterday's Daily burst forth with
the statement that roughs would be taxed 25 cents each at the Clubhouse
dance tomorrow evening.
The editor wishes to retract this statement, meanwhile apologizing for
the inaccuracy. Roughs will be as free as the air they inhale, and the pro
moters of the dance are no such idiots as they were made to appear.
Originality is difficult to attain in giving a "different" slant to the ad
vance notices of the numerous Clubhouse dances, and the pursuit of it is
sometimes carried too far.

BASKETBALL, in rules and penalties and other things, is funda
mentally different from football. Audible criticism of a referee is bad
form at Stanford even when that referee is wholly in the wrong. When
he is right, the offense is correspondingly greater.
