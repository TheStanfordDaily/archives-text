V. G. D.

My word! If the freshmen want a
jolly-up, why not give them one? That
plea was wistful and sincere. And, as
far as it is known, a "jolly"-up has
never injured anyone permanently.
We've discovered what makes all
the trouble in the worldJl. It's because
"the good are so harsh to the clever;
and the clever so rude to the good."
And it is sometimes so exceedingly
difficult to distinguish between harsh
ness and cleverness, isn't it?
There are two kinds of people:
Those who say, "Come on; let's;" and

j t hose who say, "And then what?"
And the clever ones do not always
! belong to the first category.
It isn't so much the A's and B's you
rated, as the D's you didn't get.
But, on the other hand, it isn't so
much that you don't do, as what you
do. It is all a puzzle. And when solved
would give a little more satisfaction
than a prize cross-word one.
Since winter's come:
The temper qf chums, the love of
a course, and a new piano's
tune . . .
Which of the three will have hold
you fast when it comes to the
end of June?
(Apologies to Kipling)
James Cabell offers a code of living
which might well be accepted—at least

at the beginning of the quarter:
"Live your life, acquiesce in life, as
becomes a gentleman; dream your
dreams, as becomes a child. In neither
case will you be assured of happiness
—yet it may be that you will find con
tent."
And perhaps it would be just as
well to remember too:
"Dreaming a dream to pribe
Is wishing ghosts to rise;
And, if I had the spell
To call the buried—w»11,
Which one would I?"
"Toujours la vie. Toujours la desire.
Mon dieu!"
