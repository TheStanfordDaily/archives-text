Merton of the Movies, Varsity—Com
ing.
There is a story told about one of
the famous Hollywood directors and
his contract which may or may not
explain the short time in which pic
tures are being made nowadays.
In the contract there is a clause
providing that the director must re
main completely sober during the pro
duction of a picture, but when t,he pic
ture is finished, a ten-day recess is
allowed him before work on another
commences. •
The first picture under the new con
tract got away fine. For a whole week
nothing happened. And here's where
the pretty moral comes in. The first
week found the story half told and the
director patched. Three days later the
thing was done and the recess fairly
started. And critics hailed the picture
as a gem.
"Merton of the Movies" was com
pleted in two weeks and shows the
benefits of hard work, too. In such a
short time the producer had to be con
tent with the very good story that
Harry Leon Wilson had written. There
are no assinine "improvements" nor
redundant "artistries." The story gets
away fast and continues its efficient
course to a snappy end, a faithful fol
lowing of the book and a worthy
dramatization.
Whether or not James Cruze works
under a liquor contract, he has utilized
the method to good advantage. His
picture is splendid entertainment.
A great deal of the credit is due
Glenn Hunter, who plays the title role.
Hunter has a delicate sympathy with
his part and a fine restraint. The quo
tation from Wilson's book criticizing
Merton does well for Hunter, too. "He
has put pathos in his comedy and that
is akin to genius," is in effect, what
Wilson says.
Viola Dana, supporting Hunter, is
as good a supporting actress as one
could ask. She brings the experience
of a long and creditable career to the
picture and an undimmed beauty
which prejudices the audience in its
favor immediately.
It is not unnatural that Cruze should
be able to make this picture better

than perhaps any other which he has
directed. The story is located chiefly
in Hollywood's movie studios, and that
is the thing about which Cruze and
his well-chosen cast know the most.
"Merton of the Movies" rings true, it
is touching, funny, and never boring.
It won't be long now. See it by all
means. —H. R.

main completely sober during the pro
duction of a picture, but when t,he pic
ture is finished, a ten-day recess is
allowed him before work on another
commences. •
The first picture under the new con
tract got away fine. For a whole week
nothing happened. And here's where
the pretty moral comes in. The first
week found the story half told and the
director patched. Three days later the
thing was done and the recess fairly
started. And critics hailed the picture
as a gem.
"Merton of the Movies" was com
pleted in two weeks and shows the
benefits of hard work, too. In such a
short time the producer had to be con
tent with the very good story that
Harry Leon Wilson had written. There
are no assinine "improvements" nor
redundant "artistries." The story gets
away fast and continues its efficient
course to a snappy end, a faithful fol
lowing of the book and a worthy
dramatization.
Whether or not James Cruze works
under a liquor contract, he has utilized
the method to good advantage. His
picture is splendid entertainment.
A great deal of the credit is due
Glenn Hunter, who plays the title role.
Hunter has a delicate sympathy with
his part and a fine restraint. The quo
tation from Wilson's book criticizing
Merton does well for Hunter, too. "He
has put pathos in his comedy and that
is akin to genius," is in effect, what
Wilson says.
Viola Dana, supporting Hunter, is
as good a supporting actress as one
could ask. She brings the experience
of a long and creditable career to the
picture and an undimmed beauty
which prejudices the audience in its
favor immediately.
It is not unnatural that Cruze should
be able to make this picture better

than perhaps any other which he has
directed. The story is located chiefly
in Hollywood's movie studios, and that
is the thing about which Cruze and
his well-chosen cast know the most.
"Merton of the Movies" rings true, it
is touching, funny, and never boring.
It won't be long now. See it by all
means. —H. R.
Merton of the Movies, Varsity—Com
ing.
There is a story told about one of
the famous Hollywood directors and
his contract which may or may not
explain the short time in which pic
tures are being made nowadays.
In the contract there is a clause
providing that the director must re
main completely sober during the pro
duction of a picture, but when t,he pic
ture is finished, a ten-day recess is
allowed him before work on another
commences. •
