President Wilbur received a wire

celebrating his 80th birthday. It
was from Rome, Italy, and con
tained only two words, "Semper
Fidel is."

Dr. Adolf Barkan, emeritus, profes
sor of structure and diseases of eye,
ear, and larynx, and one of the first
members of the Stanford Medical
School faculty, celebrates his eightieth
birthday today. Dr. Barkan, who has
spent some forty three-month periods
of study in various European univer
sities, is at present traveling in Europe.
Ur. Barkan was one of the earliest
faculty members of the Stanford Medi
cal School. He had two interests dur
ing his teaching days in addition to
his teaching and studyâ€”collection of
a library in opthalmology and a library
on the history of medicine. Through
his contribution of funds and time,
Stanford now has one of the finest li
braries covering the history of medi
cine.
