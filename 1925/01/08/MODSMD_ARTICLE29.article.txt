# Women's Party to Diminish Club Debt
## 
### 
Dinner will be served for 375 wo
men at 6 o'clock tonight at the Wo
men's Clubhouse, preceding the quar
terly women's conference party.
The serving of dinner at the party
instead of at the living groups was
instituted last year by a vote of the
women. The sale of tickets has helped
to clear the Clubhouse debt, and it is
hoped that the affair tonight will add
to the fund for this purpose. Last year
the women's debt was considerably de
creased, and every effort is being made
to clear it entirely this year.
Following the dinner, a program of
speeches and skits will be presented.
Speakers are Carolan Strouse, presi
dent of the women, and Miss Edith
Mirrielees. Dancing, for which Ty
rol er's orchestra has been secured,
will complete the evening.
