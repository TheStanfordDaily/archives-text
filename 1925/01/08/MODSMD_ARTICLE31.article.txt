# BOOKS ON POLITICAL PARTIES PRAISED BY WILL IN N. Y. TIMES
## 
### 
Professor Edgar E. Robinson's book,
"The Evolution of American Political
Parties," is highly recommended in a
review by Allen Sinclair Will in the
Book Review section of the New York
Times of Sunday, December 21.
Commenting on Professor Robinson's
opinion that the system of political
parties is a survival of the past and
sustained by little other than tradi
tion, Will says, "His book was com
pleted before the recent election, but
it carries the savor of prophecy in its
applicability to present conditions."
He says further that the citations,
arguments, and deductions are "as
pertinent to the campaign of 1924 as
to any in previous years."
Professor Robinson's book sets down
f,«
a chain of facts reaching to the pres

ent time, in order to demonstrate the i
I persistence in our party division in 1
1 our national life. The reviewer tells
• of the emphasis the book places upon
the influence of Jefferson, and of
| Jackson.
Will tells of the importance attached ,
! to the role of William Jennings Bryan
as a political leader and "an apostle of
; pioneer democracy."
Scientific Method Used
After summarizing the book as the
result of "the orderly methods of a
| political scientist," with the "basis in J
| a compact historical narrative for a j
definite consideration of the question!
whether parties in their current as
pects have sufficient justification for j
! their continuance," Will gives the au-1
thor's " conclusion in the following:;
"Fundamentally, he wishes a new con- ;
ception of party, that of a compara- j
tively few men who are supported by !
i a great number of citizens enrolled !
in organizations, to whom the leaders j

would be responsible and by whom
they would be removed."
This system would lead to the for-1
mation of a number of parties which
would possess "elements of national
appeal."
