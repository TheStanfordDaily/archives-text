# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT

The Editor, Sir:
Next Tuesday evening, at 7 :30 o'clock,
in the Trophy Room of the Old Union,
the Euphronia Debating Society is spoil
soring an Open Forum Discussion on the
question: "Is there professionalism in
Athletics at Stanford-" We would like
to use your columns to call for anony
mous letters, giving facts or expressing
opinions in regard to this question. Last
quarter, certain individuals publicly de
clared that Professionalism did exist in
Stanford Athletics. Others equally ve
hemently denied that this was the case.
In the middle ground, there are a large
number of us who frankly do not know.
We therefore feel that a full and frank
discussion upon the question might serve
to clear up this problem, and either assist
in uncovering and eliminating Profession
ism, or forever giving much idle talk the
lie.
We have asked Coach "Andy" Kerr
and Coach "Husky" Hunt to be present at
the discussion and they will informally
and frankly give us their viewpoints upon
the situation. We also hope to have sev
eral others present.
The anonymous viewpoints will be read
and discussed. For this reason, we are
requesting that any desiring to express
their opinion will be as brief, clear, and
concise as possible. All wishing to ex
press their opinion will please write to
William Leslie Gosslin, Box 1005, Cam
pus. Please do not sign your names.
The meeting next Tuesday evening is
open to all, whether student's, members
of the faculty, or residents of Palo Alto
and the vicinity.
Sincerely yours,
THE EXECUTIVE COUNCIL.
