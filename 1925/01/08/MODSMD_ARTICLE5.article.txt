# MINING DEPARTMENT PUTS APPARATUS IN NEW LABORATORIES
## 
### 
An Oil Testing laboratory and an
Oil Sedimentation laboratory have
been built in the Mining building by
the Mining department under the di
rection of Professor F. G. Tickell dur
ing the past three weeks.
The Oil Testing laboratory will be
used to test the properties of petro
leum for refining and use. Equipment
in the laboratory is of the most mod
ern apparatus available. A steam still,
which can develop 527 degrees Fahren
heit of heat, a vacuum distillation sys
tem, a centrifugal separator, and a
high speed mixer have been installed.
An open and a closed flash tester,
an intricate viscosimeter, and an Emer
son fuel calorimeter are now in opera
tion. The Oils and Fuels class of the
Mechanical Engineering department
will use this laboratory in conjunction
with the Mining department.
Oil well water will be analyzed in
the Oil Sedimentation laboratory.
There are, besides the apparatus room
in this laboratory, two small rooms,
which house the balances and the of
fice. The Geology and Mining Society
have an office in the same building
I which has just been completed.
