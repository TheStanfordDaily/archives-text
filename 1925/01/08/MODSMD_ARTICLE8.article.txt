# Junior Class Members Advertise as Incentive For Collecting Money

"Treasurer, Treasurer, pin a button
on me" . . . official song of the class
of 1926, prompted by a slight depres
sion of the class funds.
The feline is out of the burlap re
ceptacle. To each and every loyal
third-year man or woman who pays
his or her cla3s dues is given a little
white button embossed with a red
"26." By little is meant that the badge
is only about three-quarters of an inch
in diameter. However, the size of the
button has been figured in accordance
with the class dues. When one parts
with two dollars it takes considerable
button to reimburse one.
For the good of the '26 treasury, it
is hoped by the treasurer that many
corded gentlemen will be struggling
under the weight of one of the little
white badges with a red "26" embossed
upon it.
