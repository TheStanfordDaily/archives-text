# ONE HUNDRED APPEAR FOR INITIAL DAY OF RAM'S HEAD TRYOUTS
## 
### 
One hundred men appeared for Ram s
Head tryouts yesterday, according to
Dave Mannoccir, director.
The material was lacking in quality,
however, Mannoccir said, and he is
hoping that tonight's tryouts will bring
to light better prospects. He is directing
tryouts this afternoon in the Women's
Clubhouse and tonight in the Little The
ater from 7 to 10.
Because of the many parts to be filled,
there is still opportunity for a great
number of good actors, singers, and
dancers —especially in the freshman and
sophomore classes. Mannoccir believes
the latter possess material which is un
discovered and he has promised to give
all new underclassmen a good examina
tion.
No selections had fycen made up to
this morning, but the results of yester
day's tryouts will he posted outside the
Green Room Saturday morning for try
outs Monday afternoon. Today's results
will appear in Monday's Daily for sec
ond'tryouts to be held Monday evening.
Tyrolcr has also callcd a meeting of
all song-writers and lyric-writers for
Sunday afternoon at 2:30 at the Chi
Omega house. This will be the last
chance to present any songs or lyrics
and as Tyrolcr is still on the lookout for
possible "hits," he is hoping for a large
attendance.
Following the committee's decision to
make the dance numbers "entirely new
and different," as they expressed it, and
with a Russian motif, two special direc
tors —formerly with the Denishawn
dancers —have been obtained for the spe
cial numbers. In charge of the entire
dance program, however, is Aileenc
Burks. She is to manage the groups and
execution of the dances, while the spccial
directors will arrange the technical de
tails.
