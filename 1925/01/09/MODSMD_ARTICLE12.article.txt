# SEASONED SALINAS QUINTET WILL MEET BABES TOMORROW
## Squad Cut to Twenty-Nine; Further Reduction to Be Made After Game 
### 
Salinas High School will send its
well-seasoned quintet against the fresh
man aggregation .tomorrow night to
give them their first real test of the
year.
Coalh "Husky" Hunt has spent con
siderable time during the past week
endeavoring to pick out five men that
will show up well enough to start the
game.
At practice yesterday, the way the
babes worked out seemed to indicate
that Cliff Moore and Irving Nye would
start at forward, King at center, and
Clarke and Davidson at the guard posi
tions.
The eligible list now contains the
names of twenty-nine freshmen over
the forty that was signed up a week
ago. About seventeen of these really
figure as contenders for positions and
it is impossible to tell just how many
substitutions will be made as there
are unlimited possibilities.
Win or lose, tomorrow night Hunt
will have no alibis. He can only use
the material he has and must do the
best he can with it. The absence of
any outstanding stars is a great handi
cap to any coach and team and must
be figured accordingly.
Several small fellows have shown up
for practice this year and in some
cases have displayed an unusually
good brand of ball, but their size was
found too great a handicap to over
come.
The biggest fault of the team at
present is its inability to pass the ball.
Several of the men are very good at
hitting the basket on a reasonable
position but it seem too hard for them
to get the ball to their end of the floor.
Hunt has given his men little in
struction so far because of the great
crowd of aspirants. Now that a cut
has been made it is possible to give
the smaller group a few pointers.
By using plenty of substitutes in the
Salinas game "Husky" will be able to
get a line on his men and after the
first of next week he intends to make
another cut.
One of the hardest games of the
entire preliminary season will be found
in the Piedmont clash next Wednes
day. Piedmont is reputed to have one
of the fastest prep school teams around
the bay and vicinity.
Salinas has fared very well so far
Ibis season and it is just this kind of
competition that is most needed by
the 1928 squad at this time.

it is impossible to tell just how many
substitutions will be made as there
are unlimited possibilities.
Win or lose, tomorrow night Hunt
will have no alibis. He can only use
the material he has and must do the
best he can with it. The absence of
any outstanding stars is a great handi
cap to any coach and team and must
be figured accordingly.
Several small fellows have shown up
for practice this year and in some
cases have displayed an unusually
good brand of ball, but their size was
found too great a handicap to over
come.
The biggest fault of the team at
present is its inability to pass the ball.
Several of the men are very good at
hitting the basket on a reasonable
position but it seem too hard for them
to get the ball to their end of the floor.
Hunt has given his men little in
struction so far because of the great
crowd of aspirants. Now that a cut
has been made it is possible to give
the smaller group a few pointers.
By using plenty of substitutes in the
Salinas game "Husky" will be able to
get a line on his men and after the
first of next week he intends to make
another cut.
One of the hardest games of the
entire preliminary season will be found
in the Piedmont clash next Wednes
day. Piedmont is reputed to have one
of the fastest prep school teams around
the bay and vicinity.
Salinas has fared very well so far
Ibis season and it is just this kind of
competition that is most needed by
the 1928 squad at this time.
