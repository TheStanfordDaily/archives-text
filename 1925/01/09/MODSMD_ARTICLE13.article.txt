# BRONC QUINTET MEETS VARSITY FIVE TOMORROW
## Friars May Prove Strong Opposition for Card Hoop Aggregation 
### 
Santa Clara is expected to furnish
I some high class competition for the
, Stanford quintet here tomorrow night
] when the Bronco five meets the Cardi
! nals in the pavilion at S o'clock.
Barring the fact that Stanford did
not make any overwhelming showing
against the Teachers College last
Wednesday, it stands to reason that
the Cards will give the Friars more
j than their share of excitement.
The line-up will be somewhat the
same, probably, as began against San
Jose, with the possible exception of
Ernie Nevers, who might start the
game instead of Price. Although Nev
ers has not the speed characteristic
of him, due to his weakened ankles, he,
nevertheless, is the steadiest forward
on the squad, the best passer, and
probably goal shooter.
The Cards have the makings of a
really strong basketball team, for there
; is no gainsaying the fact that there is
| plenty of likely material. David, Price,
; Mitchell, all show likelihood of star-
I ring this season.
Strong Reserve Power
In reserve power Stanford has plenty
of men also. Ted Shipkey and his
brother parry are good guard pros
pects; Grace and Alexander both are
fairly experienced players; Newhouse
will have plenty of opportunities to
work into a standing guard position,
for experience, this year, and next sea
son should be about ripe for the posi
tion.
There is strong likelihood of shift
ing Harry Shipkey to center. At pres
ent the position is a little weak. Jayred
and Anderson are good men, and have
vast possibilities, but the job needs a
more experienced head.
Last year the Friars gave the Cards
a good stiff battle for a full half, then
let the Stanford five romp away with
the honors, 27 to 16.
The Broncs had a team which had
built up a perfect defense style, five
man, and exceedingly effective. This
is probably the kind of a combination
which Stanford will bump up against
tomorrow, and it will mean a good
many long shots.
Vukota of Santa Clara was the star
of last year's game. He is expected to
be on the line-up tomorrow. Vukota
is a shifty player to watch. He plays
the ball desperately and is no mean
shot when there comes an open oppor
tunity.
