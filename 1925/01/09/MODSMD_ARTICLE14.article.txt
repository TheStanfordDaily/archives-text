# EIGHT LETTER MEN TURN OUT AT FIRST DIAMOND PRACTICE
## 
### Harry Bennett 
The turnout of men at the varsity
baseball practice yesterday afternoon
indicated that Coach Harry Wolter
will have a great wealth of material
from which to build his 1925 baseball
machine.
Eight letter men from last year's
aggregation reported. This includes
McCandless, Mulchay, Roberts, Cudde
back, May, Johnston, Oviatt, Teague,
and Lawson. Solomon will not report
for a week or so yet on account of an
injused shoulder.
Ernie Nevers, star pitcher of last
season, is now devoting all his time
to basketball but will workout for the
ball team as soon as the present hoop
season comes to a close.
Jobs on the varsity line-up will not
be easy pickin's for the letter men this
year, for there are several good players
from the 1927 team that are now hang
ing around the diamond and building
ufi good form.
Future Is Bright
If past performances mean anything
to the dopester or the reader it can
easily be seen that there are unlimited
I possibilities for building up a winning
combination.
The tangle with the faculty and staff
this afternoon will mean little or noth
ing for future results. The first inter
esting game of the season will come
next Wednesday afternoon when the
team mixes with Cliff Ireland and his
"pick-up" gang of professionals.
Ireland has been bringing a team to
the Stanford lot for the past decade
and has always played a good game
and drawn a big crowd. He never lets
a game pass without furnishing the
spectators with reams of laughter by
i his bright cracks.
This game will be played on very
short notice and with little practice
on the part of the old-timers, most of
whom have been tied up with post
season football.
Large Squad Practicing
A large crew has been practicing
all last quarter and is now in fair
shape. Dick Keyes, a transfer from
Fresno State College, has been work
ing out on the initial sack and has
been covering plenty of ground and
showing good form.
Several others from last year's squad
are signed up and are now perform
ing. This includes Aydelott, Brown,
Hawkins, Kohler, Draper, and King.
Meeker, Mann, Murray, and McCol
lough are among some of the others
signed up.
With Oviatt, Teague, Solomon, and
Nevers all back and eligible, Wolter
has an excellent and experienced
bunch to do his pitching. Last year
Nevers turned out in time for the
California series and did some won
derful work towards bringing home
the bacon.
Captain "Chuck" Johnston will be
back at his old position behind the
bat and will be backed up by Jim
Lawson, Hal Kin& and Bob Bailard.
The only place left vacant without
ready material to fill in was the first
sack held down last year by Bud
Woodward. Keyes is going good in that
department and has several to help
him out.
Many Veterans Are Back
The infield is pretty well covered
with experienced men including
"Shorty" Roberts at second, Mulchay
at short, and Cuddeback on third.
"Cudde" is all excited over the open
ing of the baseball season and is wait
ing and raring to go. Â«
In the outfield is Bus McCandless
and "Lefty" May. "Lefty" has been
pretty handy with the stick in the past
and hasn't lost any of his old ability
between seasons.
Jerry Stewart, captain of the 1927
team, is no doubt the one to fill the
vacancy in the field. He was the heavy
hitter on last year's freshman squad.
Howard Sheets, another prospect, was
ineligible when the freshman season
opened last year, but is now free to
play.
Chinese students at the University
of Washington have brought over a
priceless exhibit of art and industrial
wares.
