Ths following article, which appeared in Time for January 5, has some
significant things to say about higher education in America. It treats of
matters vital- to every college man and woman, and considers them in a
light somewhat strange to the more or less conventional American opinions.
Perhaps the detachment of this observer means that he has escaped the
blur which comes from being too closely attached to the object under
scrutiny. Or perhaps it prevents him from grasping all the facts which
bear upon the situation.
The Daily will welcome "Viewpoints" based on this article, as an ex
pression of Stanford opinion. The reactions of the Englishman are inter
esting, and a discussion of these reactions might be equally so.
"A thoughtful student from the London School of Economics" spent
five months journeying through the United States. He stopped at colleges
and universities—colleges for men, for women, for men and women, for
negroes, for Indians, for divines, for business men, for lawyers—3o in
stitutions in all. At first he was staggered by the diversity of the sights he
saw. Then, gradually, he formulated comprehensive ideas about United
States education. When he returned, lately, to England, he said to his
countrymen:
"The visitor from Europe cannot fail to be amazed at two features in
the American college system. first, its extreme newness and tremendously
rapid growth; and second, its accessibility, at any rate as compared with
England, to the sons and (kiughters of the mass of the people. . . .
"But when the boy gets in, he receives something entirely different
from what is known as a university education in Europe. He gets, not so
much an insight into ways of thinking and methods of reasoning, not so
much a background of culture, as a training in 'leadership,' 'citizenship'
and 'character.' This may be a desirable thing at the present point of de
velopment of the United States, but it is something quite distinct from
the European conception of a university.
"The student not only gets something different, but he expects some
thing different. In England you go to the university to develop yourself,
while in America you go to the university to distinguish yourself. There
you have a whole world of difference. In Anperica a boy is always endeav
oring to attain some outward sign of achievement—to make the college
paper, to make one of the clubs or fraternities, to make the football team.
The center of gravity is in the world of action far more than in the world
of thought.
"You get the same tendency echoed in the academic sphere. I was
struck by the excellence, the vigor and the competence with which affairs
relating to the world of action are handled. I found that everyone could
use a typewriter and drive an automobile. I found that drives for money
were made on a vast scale and with a success undreamed of in England. I
found that the applied sciences, such as medicine and engineering and ag
riculture. and the vocational studies, such as law, are at their best taught
(and learned!) far better than anywhere in England. But when it came
to what one may call by contrast the world of thought, quite the opposite
was the case. Pure science and the purely cultural subjects, such as clas
sics and literature and art, are absolutely inferior in most cases, and usually
neglected. The situation in regard to them is either tragic or comic. Ac
cordingly, although one meets students who obviously show promise of
becoming great engineers, great doctors, captains of industry and so forth,
one rarely if ever meets a student who seems destined to become a Darwin,
a Beethoven, a Shelley.
"One of the main reasons why the Amerftan university system is not
going the right way to produce men of genius in art and philosophy, pure
science and literature, is because diversity of character is not encouraged
but suppressed; for genius is the flower of exceptional diversity. Let me
explain how this suppression is brought about.
"In the first place, you have the fraternity. A fraternity is a place
where a number of young men invite other young men to join them on con
dition that they, too, become like themselves. The resulting intellectual
stagnation is called a fraternity; and in these places there is no room at all
for a man who is in any way different from his fellows. Any knobs on
his character are quickly knocked off. . . .
"Then there are the badges and class distinctions which abound in
America, the land where class distinctions are supposed not to exist. You
can often tell from a man's appearance almost everything about him. At
Leland Stanford (to take an example at random) sophomores wear white
corduroy trousers, juniors wear small caps, seniors wear hard Mexican
hats. At Oklahoma and elsewhere, engineers wear Stetson hats and law
yers carry canes; while the übiquitous pins and buttons show which fra
ternity a man belongs to and where he met his girl. The 'tyranny of
categories' is pushed to an extreme point and has a very important effect
in reducing the individual to a mere member of a category, and robbing
him of his individuality to what I consider a dangerous extent. Add to
this the absence of a reasonable amount of privacy in the life of the student, |
and you may see what lam driving at. The desire for privacy is regarded
as bad form in colleges; and the usual rule is that everybody's
door must always be open for everybody to walk in or look in at random.
In the fraternities in particular, the lack of privacy is a special curse. Hie
men all keep together, eat together, wash together, play together and sing
together. In practice no one's door is ever closed, even if it is permissible
in theory. . . .
"It occurred to me that there is no real individualism whatever in
America in the sense of there being a true diversity of character and per
sonality. For this lack the university system is largely responsible."

as bad form in colleges; and the usual rule is that everybody's

Ths following article, which appeared in Time for January 5, has some
significant things to say about higher education in America. It treats of
matters vital- to every college man and woman, and considers them in a
light somewhat strange to the more or less conventional American opinions.

"A thoughtful student from the London School of Economics" spent
five months journeying through the United States. He stopped at colleges
and universities—colleges for men, for women, for men and women, for
negroes, for Indians, for divines, for business men, for lawyers—3o in
stitutions in all. At first he was staggered by the diversity of the sights he
saw. Then, gradually, he formulated comprehensive ideas about United
States education. When he returned, lately, to England, he said to his
countrymen:
"The visitor from Europe cannot fail to be amazed at two features in
the American college system. first, its extreme newness and tremendously
rapid growth; and second, its accessibility, at any rate as compared with
England, to the sons and (kiughters of the mass of the people. . . .
"But when the boy gets in, he receives something entirely different
from what is known as a university education in Europe. He gets, not so
much an insight into ways of thinking and methods of reasoning, not so
much a background of culture, as a training in 'leadership,' 'citizenship'
and 'character.' This may be a desirable thing at the present point of de
velopment of the United States, but it is something quite distinct from
the European conception of a university.
"The student not only gets something different, but he expects some
thing different. In England you go to the university to develop yourself,
while in America you go to the university to distinguish yourself. There
you have a whole world of difference. In Anperica a boy is always endeav
oring to attain some outward sign of achievement—to make the college
paper, to make one of the clubs or fraternities, to make the football team.
The center of gravity is in the world of action far more than in the world
of thought.
"You get the same tendency echoed in the academic sphere. I was
struck by the excellence, the vigor and the competence with which affairs
relating to the world of action are handled. I found that everyone could
use a typewriter and drive an automobile. I found that drives for money
were made on a vast scale and with a success undreamed of in England. I
found that the applied sciences, such as medicine and engineering and ag
riculture. and the vocational studies, such as law, are at their best taught
(and learned!) far better than anywhere in England. But when it came
to what one may call by contrast the world of thought, quite the opposite
was the case. Pure science and the purely cultural subjects, such as clas
sics and literature and art, are absolutely inferior in most cases, and usually
neglected. The situation in regard to them is either tragic or comic. Ac
cordingly, although one meets students who obviously show promise of
becoming great engineers, great doctors, captains of industry and so forth,
one rarely if ever meets a student who seems destined to become a Darwin,
a Beethoven, a Shelley.
"One of the main reasons why the Amerftan university system is not
going the right way to produce men of genius in art and philosophy, pure
science and literature, is because diversity of character is not encouraged
but suppressed; for genius is the flower of exceptional diversity. Let me
explain how this suppression is brought about.
"In the first place, you have the fraternity. A fraternity is a place
where a number of young men invite other young men to join them on con
dition that they, too, become like themselves. The resulting intellectual
stagnation is called a fraternity; and in these places there is no room at all
for a man who is in any way different from his fellows. Any knobs on
his character are quickly knocked off. . . .
"Then there are the badges and class distinctions which abound in
America, the land where class distinctions are supposed not to exist. You
can often tell from a man's appearance almost everything about him. At
Leland Stanford (to take an example at random) sophomores wear white
corduroy trousers, juniors wear small caps, seniors wear hard Mexican
hats. At Oklahoma and elsewhere, engineers wear Stetson hats and law
yers carry canes; while the übiquitous pins and buttons show which fra
ternity a man belongs to and where he met his girl. The 'tyranny of
categories' is pushed to an extreme point and has a very important effect
in reducing the individual to a mere member of a category, and robbing
him of his individuality to what I consider a dangerous extent. Add to
this the absence of a reasonable amount of privacy in the life of the student, |

Leland Stanford (to take an example at random) sophomores wear white
corduroy trousers, juniors wear small caps, seniors wear hard Mexican
hats. At Oklahoma and elsewhere, engineers wear Stetson hats and law
yers carry canes; while the übiquitous pins and buttons show which fra
ternity a man belongs to and where he met his girl. The 'tyranny of
categories' is pushed to an extreme point and has a very important effect
in reducing the individual to a mere member of a category, and robbing
him of his individuality to what I consider a dangerous extent. Add to
this the absence of a reasonable amount of privacy in the life of the student, |
and you may see what lam driving at. The desire for privacy is regarded
as bad form in colleges; and the usual rule is that everybody's
door must always be open for everybody to walk in or look in at random.
In the fraternities in particular, the lack of privacy is a special curse. Hie
men all keep together, eat together, wash together, play together and sing
together. In practice no one's door is ever closed, even if it is permissible
in theory. . . .
"It occurred to me that there is no real individualism whatever in
America in the sense of there being a true diversity of character and per
sonality. For this lack the university system is largely responsible."
Ths following article, which appeared in Time for January 5, has some
significant things to say about higher education in America. It treats of
matters vital- to every college man and woman, and considers them in a
light somewhat strange to the more or less conventional American opinions.
Perhaps the detachment of this observer means that he has escaped the
blur which comes from being too closely attached to the object under
scrutiny. Or perhaps it prevents him from grasping all the facts which
bear upon the situation.
The Daily will welcome "Viewpoints" based on this article, as an ex
pression of Stanford opinion. The reactions of the Englishman are inter
esting, and a discussion of these reactions might be equally so.
"A thoughtful student from the London School of Economics" spent
five months journeying through the United States. He stopped at colleges
and universities—colleges for men, for women, for men and women, for
negroes, for Indians, for divines, for business men, for lawyers—3o in
stitutions in all. At first he was staggered by the diversity of the sights he
saw. Then, gradually, he formulated comprehensive ideas about United
States education. When he returned, lately, to England, he said to his
countrymen:
"The visitor from Europe cannot fail to be amazed at two features in
the American college system. first, its extreme newness and tremendously
rapid growth; and second, its accessibility, at any rate as compared with
England, to the sons and (kiughters of the mass of the people. . . .
"But when the boy gets in, he receives something entirely different
from what is known as a university education in Europe. He gets, not so
much an insight into ways of thinking and methods of reasoning, not so
much a background of culture, as a training in 'leadership,' 'citizenship'
and 'character.' This may be a desirable thing at the present point of de
velopment of the United States, but it is something quite distinct from
the European conception of a university.
"The student not only gets something different, but he expects some
thing different. In England you go to the university to develop yourself,
while in America you go to the university to distinguish yourself. There
you have a whole world of difference. In Anperica a boy is always endeav
oring to attain some outward sign of achievement—to make the college
paper, to make one of the clubs or fraternities, to make the football team.
The center of gravity is in the world of action far more than in the world
of thought.
"You get the same tendency echoed in the academic sphere. I was
struck by the excellence, the vigor and the competence with which affairs
relating to the world of action are handled. I found that everyone could
use a typewriter and drive an automobile. I found that drives for money
were made on a vast scale and with a success undreamed of in England. I
found that the applied sciences, such as medicine and engineering and ag
riculture. and the vocational studies, such as law, are at their best taught
(and learned!) far better than anywhere in England. But when it came
to what one may call by contrast the world of thought, quite the opposite
was the case. Pure science and the purely cultural subjects, such as clas
sics and literature and art, are absolutely inferior in most cases, and usually
neglected. The situation in regard to them is either tragic or comic. Ac
cordingly, although one meets students who obviously show promise of
becoming great engineers, great doctors, captains of industry and so forth,
one rarely if ever meets a student who seems destined to become a Darwin,
a Beethoven, a Shelley.
"One of the main reasons why the Amerftan university system is not
going the right way to produce men of genius in art and philosophy, pure
science and literature, is because diversity of character is not encouraged
but suppressed; for genius is the flower of exceptional diversity. Let me
explain how this suppression is brought about.
"In the first place, you have the fraternity. A fraternity is a place
where a number of young men invite other young men to join them on con
dition that they, too, become like themselves. The resulting intellectual
stagnation is called a fraternity; and in these places there is no room at all
for a man who is in any way different from his fellows. Any knobs on
his character are quickly knocked off. . . .

America, the land where class distinctions are supposed not to exist. You
