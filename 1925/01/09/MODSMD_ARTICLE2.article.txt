# CONCERT PROGRAM OF WELSH SINGERS IS WELL RECEIVED
## 
### Herbert Klein 
Excellent martial and dramatic num
bers were outstanding in the program
given by the Rhondda Welsh Singers
last night in the Assembly hall. The
chorus, directed by Thomas Morgan,
was in large part responsible for the
success of the concert.
. Solos, duets and quartets were also
part of the program. The opening num
ber, "March of the Men of Harlach,"
given in resonant tones, was particu
larly impressive.
Emlyn Jones played, a flawless ac
companiment to the vocal numbers.
The last group was by the chorus,
who sang Prothero's mighty setting of
the poem "Invictus." The Welsh Na
tional Air, next given was rather a
novelty to most who had been accus
tomed to think that "Men of Harlach"
was the national song of Wales. It was
a very tuneful song slightly remini
scent of "Mother Machree." Our own
"America" closed the program.
Nearly thirty numbers in all were
given and no one could say that the
chorus was anything but generous with
their music.
