Alonzo's back! Yes, he's back, after
three quarters' absence. His roommate
think's he's still about three-quarters
absent. Don't yell! He's such a sensi
tive boy, you know.
In fact, he dropped out of school
last year only because he was so sensi
tive. He was highly incensed, one day,
when his engineering professor recom
mended that he take Forging Prac
tice; the idea of teaching such a low
art in college! And for anyone to sug
gest that Alonzo practice it! As if
that were necessary.
Then Alonzo told us about his sum
mer's work, punctuating his remarks
with the queerest little gesture. He
would raise his hand to his upper lip,
making the most peculiar twisting
motion with his thumb and forefinger.
Manerism he's picked up some place,
I guess.
He says he's been writing for sev
eral of the foremost magazines in the
country. But his roommate told us
later that none of them ever came, so
he's still writing.
