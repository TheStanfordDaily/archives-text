"If a woman comes out of college
with a perspective of what is going
on around her, a sense of humor, and
a vital interest in some one thing, col
lege has done for her what it should
do," said Miss Edith Mirrielees, who
addressed the women at their quar

j terly party held last night in the
(Women's Clubhouse.
j "One of the privileges of those en-
I tering this quarter is the unique ex
, perience of being one of the few new
ones in a closely-knitted and well
acquainted community. Here is an op
portunity for exercise of the sense of
humor," explained Miss Mirrielees. "A
{disadvantage of college life, however,

is the prevalent intellectual flippancy.
College students aim not to know but
to seem to know."
Carolan Strouse, president of Asso
i dated Women, welcomed the new
women, pointing out some of the fea
tures of college life worthy of their
| observance. A report was made on the
recent action of Women's Conference
| in establishing 11:30 instead of 10:30

hours without signing out, on week
ends.
Freshmen and sophomores presented
musical skits, divination stunts, and
pantomines.
Dinner was served to 375 women in
two relays. The profits from the dinner
will be used to help clear the Women's
Clubhouse debt. Dam ing preceded and
followed the program.
