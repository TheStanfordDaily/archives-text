# INTRAMURAL BASKET AGGREGATIONS MIX IN OPENER MONDAY
## A. K. L. Meets El Cuadro in First of Six Scheduled Games at 4:15 
### Al Post 
When the Alpha Kappa Lambda five
lines up against representatives of El
Cuadro at 4:15 Monday afternoon in
the Encina gym, intramural basketball
will be off to a Hying start in what
promises to be a record-breaking sea
son, both from the standpoint of the
number of teams and the quality of
game played by the competing aggre
gations.
Other contests Monday will be: El
Capitan vs. Branner First at 4:50,
Theta Delta Chi vs. Encina 3W at
5:30, El Campo vs. Sigma Alpha Epsi
lon at 7:15, El Tigre vs. Encina 2E at
7:50, and Sequoia First vs. Alpha Delta
Phi at 8:25. All games will be played
in two fifteen-minute periods. C. W.
Davis urges that managers have their
men ready promptly at the scheduled
tyne. Any team more than five minutes
late will be obliged to forfeit.
Forty-eight squads have entered the
race, six more than participated last
year, and many of the living groups
have already started practice. Most
of the organizations will have enough
material for at least two teams when
the series actually gets under way, so
great is the interest in the sport.
Placques will be awarded each of
the eight league winners, and a silver
loving cup is offered for the Univer
sity champion. Both Delta Tau Delta,
which emerged victorious last year,
and Beta Theta Pi, 1923 titleholder and
runer-up last season, are strong out
fits.
The rule barring letter men and var
sity and weight team players from in
tramural competition will keep the ma
jority of veterans of both fraternities
from participating in the series, as
their good work last year earned them
be"tbs on either the varsity or the
lightweight squads.
The Delta Taus have only Collett
and Morrison left from their champion
ship quintet and the Betas claim Dave
Mannoccir as their sole seasoned per
former. The Betas, however, have
been practicing for the past three days
and will be in tip-top shape for their
first game with the Encina basement
team January 10, while the Delta Taus
only started work today.
A dark horse that should make a
good fight for the title is L. F. Kel
logg's independent team, the Panthers,
whose members are picked at random
from all the living groups and from
men living off campus, solely because
of their ability to play good basket
ball.
Other fives strictly in the running
are the 1924 league winners: El Toro,
Phi Delta Theta, Japanese Club, Kappa
Sigma, and El Cuadro. With the ex
ception of Toyon men affiliated with
eating clubs the hall representatives
have failed in the past to show enough
stuff to win, but Sequoia and Branner
have a wealth of good material which
may come through in this series.
Owing to the large number of teams
in the freshman dormitory Encina is
usually unable to get enough first
class talent on any one squad to be
effective.
