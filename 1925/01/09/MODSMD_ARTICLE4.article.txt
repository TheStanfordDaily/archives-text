# INTRAMURAL BASKET AGGREGATIONS MIX IN OPENER MONDAY
## A. K. L. Meets El Cuadro in First of Six Scheduled Games at 4:15 
### Al Post 
When the Alpha Kappa Lambda five
lines up against representatives of El
Cuadro at 4:15 Monday afternoon in
the Encina gym, intramural basketball
will be off to a Hying start in what
promises to be a record-breaking sea
son, both from the standpoint of the
number of teams and the quality of
game played by the competing aggre

Other contests Monday will be: El
Capitan vs. Branner First at 4:50,
Theta Delta Chi vs. Encina 3W at
5:30, El Campo vs. Sigma Alpha Epsi

7:50, and Sequoia First vs. Alpha Delta
Phi at 8:25. All games will be played
in two fifteen-minute periods. C. W.
Davis urges that managers have their
men ready promptly at the scheduled

late will be obliged to forfeit.
Forty-eight squads have entered the
race, six more than participated last
year, and many of the living groups
have already started practice. Most
of the organizations will have enough
material for at least two teams when
the series actually gets under way, so
great is the interest in the sport.
Placques will be awarded each of
the eight league winners, and a silver

which emerged victorious last year,
and Beta Theta Pi, 1923 titleholder and
runer-up last season, are strong out
fits.
