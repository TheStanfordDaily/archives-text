# CALIFORNIA PIANIST WILL GIVE SONATA AT TUESDAY CONCERT
## 
### 
David Alberto, pianist, will give a
recital in the Assembly hall Tuesday
evening at 7:30. Alberto is a Califor
nian, a protege of La Forge and a stu
dent of Leschinsky. He has been living
in retirement in Carmel, playing but
few concerts, and for ten years has
been making an intensive study of
Chopin's sonata, Opus 35, which he
will play at the recital.
Alberto is not only a pianist, but
also a composer. An instance of this
is his solo arrangement of the Arensky
waltz for two pianos. Alberto will play
it for the first time in public on his
coming program.
