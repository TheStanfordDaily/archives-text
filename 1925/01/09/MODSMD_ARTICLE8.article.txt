# FIRST PRACTICE IS HELD BY FRESHMAN BASEBALL PLAYERS
## 
### John Levi 
With less than three weeks to pre
pare for its first scheduled game the
freshman baseball squad held its first
organized practice yesterday after
noon. "Husky" Hunt, the mentor of
freshman athletes, is at the present
time busy with basketball, and the
team is taking its first instructions
from Coach Harry Wolter.
As a preliminary to the batting and
fielding practice a pick-up game was
played between the first-year prospects
and the varsity squad. This game
made one thing evident —the fresh
men, although as yet lacking a pitcher,
are going to have three excellent play
ers as a nucleus for a team.
One is a catcher, one is an out
fielder, and the other is a shortstop.
With the backing of these well-distri
buted men even a mediocre aggrega
tion should prove a hard one to beat.
Cook Sypher is one of the niftiest
backstops that has been seen in this
part of the country for quite a while.
He plays with the air of a veteran
and is a powerful batter.
Tom McGuire is a clever outfielder
and is also somewhat of a batter. Jim
Garibaldi will not have much difficulty
obtaining the position of shortstop.
Pitchers Are Scarce
The pitchers have not commenced
their warming up but it is probable
that "Husky" will have two excellent
twirlers. One of these is Jim Reynolds
who is at the present time holding
down a guard position on one of the
freshman basketball squads. The other
is Robert Phillipi from Norwalk, who
has not yet shown up for practice.
With an eye toward future varsity
material the handful of men that are
working out give excellent promise.
They should contribute more real var
sity players than any class since the
class of 1925, and it is encouraging to
note that these men play positions
that will have to be filled next year.
