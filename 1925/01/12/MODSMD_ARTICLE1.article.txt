# 'TORCH-BEARERS' PRODUCTION IS SUCCESS---GRAY
## DOCTOR BAILEY STARS Faculty Play Pleases Large Audience; $ 1,000 House To Aid Russians 
### H. D. Gray 
A thousand dollar house —the proceeds
to go to Russian relief, greeted the fac
ulty members who assumed the various
roles in "The Torch Bearers" on Friday
evening. The applause and laughs were
plentiful, and the performance "went
over" as an unqualified success.
As a satire on the Little Theater
movement, "The Torch Bearers" makes
its point. The author, George Kelly, is
apparently not concerned with matters
of plot, of characterization, or even dia
logue ; except as these furnish opportu
nity for the absurdities which make up
the evening's fun. When the play was
put on in New York it scored a success
entirely unexpected by the management—
a success which seemed due almost
wholly to the fact that the time was ripe
for a burlesque of the amateur in thea
tric art.
Play Timely
We have not suffered here from an
overdose of "tendency" plays put on by
such groups as are travestied in "The
Torch Bearers," and without the excel
lent professional cast which secured the
play its run in New York, Friday even
ing's success sterns rather a surprise.
In reading, "The Torch Bearers" is so
stupid that it is almost impossible to get
through with it; it has nothing of the
brilliancy of Mr. *Stephen Leacock s
"Behind the Beyond," which treats the
same subject so delightfully. In reading,
Mr. Leacock's play is as much a joy as
Mr. Kelly's is a bore; yet "Behind the Be
yond" fell flat in the production that I
saw, and "The Torch Bearers" "got
across."
The reason for this seems to be that
the broader the burlesque the better,
when anything purporting to be intellec
tual is to be victimized. From Molier's
"Precicuscs Ridicules," and down to Mr.
Kelly's Httle piece, the crowd has always
taken delight in seeing affectation made
ridiculous; and especially it rejoices to
see those who assume intellectual supe
riority paraded as fools. The more
asinine an advocate of highbrow art is
made out, the better the audience likes it.
A character that is being ridiculed for
"devotion to a cause" must be represented
as taking himself with absolute serious
ness. Though all the members of the cast
realized this, Miss -Bailey stood out as
primarily successful in putting a genuine
characterization into her part. For that,
she had the best opportunity: Mrs. Pam
pinelli is by far the best done character
in the play. She is perhaps the only
real person that Mr. Kelly provided.
Miss Bailey played with perfect ease
and conviction, and made her impersona
tion all the more amusing for being
credible. For the most part, Mr. Burks
did extremely well. He portrayed the
intense young man who is utterly devoid
of humor, and who really goes at his part
in desperate earnest. As with most of
the others, his over-acting was due to
the author's undercharacterizing; but
Mr. Burks did present a personality.
The rest acted, on the whole, very well.
Mr. Clyde took his part too seriously,
though he made his points and got his
laughs. Miss Howard was at her best—
and her best is very good—in the char
acterization she gave her part in the
play within the play.
Minor Roles Good
Mr. Foster and Mrs. Adams made their
minor parts stand out, and, with Miss
Bailey, scored the artistic successes of
the evening, because they happen to
possess to an unusual degree the; genuine
ability to act. But a good word could be
said of each member of the cast; and
that is as much to say that Gordon Davis
showed his usual insight in selecting
precisely the best person available for
each of the parts, and then gave to the
production itself the finish and charm
which he manages to put into all his
work.

overdose of "tendency" plays put on by
such groups as are travestied in "The
Torch Bearers," and without the excel
lent professional cast which secured the
play its run in New York, Friday even
ing's success sterns rather a surprise.
In reading, "The Torch Bearers" is so
stupid that it is almost impossible to get
through with it; it has nothing of the
brilliancy of Mr. *Stephen Leacock s
"Behind the Beyond," which treats the
same subject so delightfully. In reading,
Mr. Leacock's play is as much a joy as
Mr. Kelly's is a bore; yet "Behind the Be
yond" fell flat in the production that I
saw, and "The Torch Bearers" "got
across."
The reason for this seems to be that
the broader the burlesque the better,
when anything purporting to be intellec
tual is to be victimized. From Molier's
"Precicuscs Ridicules," and down to Mr.
Kelly's Httle piece, the crowd has always
taken delight in seeing affectation made
ridiculous; and especially it rejoices to
see those who assume intellectual supe
riority paraded as fools. The more
asinine an advocate of highbrow art is
made out, the better the audience likes it.
A character that is being ridiculed for
"devotion to a cause" must be represented
as taking himself with absolute serious
ness. Though all the members of the cast
realized this, Miss -Bailey stood out as
primarily successful in putting a genuine
characterization into her part. For that,
she had the best opportunity: Mrs. Pam
pinelli is by far the best done character
in the play. She is perhaps the only
real person that Mr. Kelly provided.
Miss Bailey played with perfect ease
and conviction, and made her impersona
tion all the more amusing for being
credible. For the most part, Mr. Burks
did extremely well. He portrayed the
intense young man who is utterly devoid
of humor, and who really goes at his part
in desperate earnest. As with most of
the others, his over-acting was due to
the author's undercharacterizing; but
Mr. Burks did present a personality.
The rest acted, on the whole, very well.
Mr. Clyde took his part too seriously,
though he made his points and got his
laughs. Miss Howard was at her best—
and her best is very good—in the char
acterization she gave her part in the
play within the play.
Minor Roles Good
Mr. Foster and Mrs. Adams made their
minor parts stand out, and, with Miss
Bailey, scored the artistic successes of
the evening, because they happen to
possess to an unusual degree the; genuine
ability to act. But a good word could be
said of each member of the cast; and
that is as much to say that Gordon Davis
showed his usual insight in selecting
precisely the best person available for
each of the parts, and then gave to the
production itself the finish and charm
which he manages to put into all his
work.
A thousand dollar house —the proceeds
to go to Russian relief, greeted the fac
ulty members who assumed the various
roles in "The Torch Bearers" on Friday
evening. The applause and laughs were
plentiful, and the performance "went
over" as an unqualified success.
As a satire on the Little Theater
movement, "The Torch Bearers" makes
its point. The author, George Kelly, is
apparently not concerned with matters
of plot, of characterization, or even dia
logue ; except as these furnish opportu
nity for the absurdities which make up
the evening's fun. When the play was
put on in New York it scored a success
entirely unexpected by the management—
a success which seemed due almost
wholly to the fact that the time was ripe
for a burlesque of the amateur in thea
tric art.
