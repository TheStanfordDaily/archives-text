# 'TORCH-BEARERS' PRODUCTION IS SUCCESS---GRAY
## DOCTOR BAILEY STARS Faculty Play Pleases Large Audience; $ 1,000 House To Aid Russians 
### H. D. Gray 
A thousand dollar house —the proceeds
to go to Russian relief, greeted the fac
ulty members who assumed the various
roles in "The Torch Bearers" on Friday
evening. The applause and laughs were
plentiful, and the performance "went
over" as an unqualified success.
As a satire on the Little Theater
movement, "The Torch Bearers" makes
its point. The author, George Kelly, is
apparently not concerned with matters
of plot, of characterization, or even dia
logue ; except as these furnish opportu

the evening's fun. When the play was
put on in New York it scored a success
entirely unexpected by the management—
a success which seemed due almost
wholly to the fact that the time was ripe
for a burlesque of the amateur in thea
tric art.
Play Timely
We have not suffered here from an
overdose of "tendency" plays put on by
such groups as are travestied in "The
Torch Bearers," and without the excel

play its run in New York, Friday even

In reading, "The Torch Bearers" is so
stupid that it is almost impossible to get
through with it; it has nothing of the
brilliancy of Mr. *Stephen Leacock s
"Behind the Beyond," which treats the
same subject so delightfully. In reading,
Mr. Leacock's play is as much a joy as
Mr. Kelly's is a bore; yet "Behind the Be
yond" fell flat in the production that I
saw, and "The Torch Bearers" "got
across."
The reason for this seems to be that
