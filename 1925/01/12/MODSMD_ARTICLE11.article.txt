One hundred hooks and two hundred j
pamphlets hound by Professor William
A. Cooper of the Germanic Languages
: department during the past fifteen years
testify that his hobby of bookbinding is
| not a mere passing fancy.
, Professor Cooper first became intcr
! ested in the art while studying in Ger
many in 1908-09. On one occasion he
bought a Goethe library, many of the
volumes of which were unbound; so lie
: found an old bookbinder, who had his
little shop across the street from the
Goethe house in Weimar, to bind them
for him. Cooper then boxed up the j
; books and sent them home. ,
After a few more weeks of study and |
travel in Germany, lie bought some more
unbound books. Then he realized that
some time in the future lie might buy
other books, and furthermore, that in his
status of professor, he could hardly af
: ford to have such books bound in tlic

! United States. Therefore he returned to
thq old bookbinder at Weimar and ob
tained a few private lessons from him.
Cooper proved to be an apt pupil and
soon completely mastered the art of
pamphlet binding.
First becoming interested in book
binding as the result of a little economic
foresight, the professor soon became so
enthusiastic over the .subject that after
his return to Stanford he developed a
method of his own. So skillful did he
become that he was persuaded by admir
ing friends to teach a free class in book
binding in the Art department of the
i University.
Two of those who caught some of
Conner's enthusiasm for the art are Mrs.
Briggs, wife of Professor Briggs of the
English department, and Professor Slo
naker. Mrs. Briggs latcd studied artistic
bookbinding in France and Italy, and has
I become very proficient.
