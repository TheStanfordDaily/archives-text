Her book, "Country Life and the Coun
try School," is well known to every
educator concerned with the rural
school systems. She contributed to the

the Department of Education, that the
Education club succeeded in securing

the rural school problem are invited
to attend the meeting. Refreshments
will be served at the conclusion of the
address.
