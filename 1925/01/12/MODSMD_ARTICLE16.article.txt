# CARDS NOSE OUT BRONCOS 15-16 IN CLOSE GAME
## VARSITY LEADS AT HALF Stanford Shows Improvement In Second Contest of Basketball Season 
### David Meiklejohn 
After a heated exchange of one and
two point leads with the Santa Clara
quintet la-st Saturday night, the Cardi
nal five managed to stall long enough
on its advantage to win, 15 to 13, over
the disappointed and revenge-thirsty
Broncos,
The first half developed into nothing
more serious than a tumbling match
with Santa Clara unable to score but
three foul shots; Stanford, meanwhile,
wondering how much safety lay in a
G to 3 lead.

In the second period, however, the
Broncs, using a tight five-man defense
to considerable advantage, kept drop
ping in stray baskets and, in inde
terminate sprints, went ahead of Stan
ford, 9 to 8. Price's field goal managed
to keep the Cards above water long
enough for one Gottewals to decide
on the next Friar advantage—which
came quickly. Harry Shipkey scored
three points all in one breath and Stan
ford was ahead. The Broncs evened up,
and Price ended the competition by
cinching the game and taking part in
a quiet little game of passing the ball
until the gun shot.
Nelson David, who went out early in
the second half because of personal
fouls, was high point man with five.
Vukota of the visitors took a great
interest in shooting points for his side,
and also an important role in the j
Santa Clara defense —which was eas
ily the feature of the game.
It is noteworthy that the Cardinals
looked something over fifty per cent
better than in the San Jose Teachers
College game. The team worked better
as a unit, and there was less indeci- j
sion. Unity will be the foundation for j
a strong team this year, not individual
work, as was the case last seson.

Stanford (15) Santa Clara (13)
