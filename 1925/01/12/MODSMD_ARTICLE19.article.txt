Coach Andy Kerr's basketball varsity pulled a surprise Saturday
evening, and as a result the stock booms a trifle.
Coach "Husky" Hunt's freshmen demonstrated that they were not
nearly so bad as they have a right to be, considering the set-backs sus
tained in their first preliminary scrimmage with the scholarship committee.
These two quintets will be wholly in the public eye, but there are
nearly fifty others which will derive just as much benefit from the sport.
Intramural basketball began this afternoon, and a number of dusty law
majors and medics will get a bit of frenzied exercise striving to pop the
ball through the hoop for the glory of So and So.
Purely from a recreational standpoint, it seems probable that intra
mural sport must be far superior to the varsity brand of competition. A
man on a Stanford team is not able to look back upon his mistakes —if
he makes any, an-d most men do—with any satisfaction, but an intra
mural player can sink the ball through the wrong hoop and feel well
pleased with himself for having inspired the biggest laugh of the game.
"Peanut league" contests never offer much of an excuse for loss of sleep.
Some of these intramural teams will be coached and trained by the
process of shouting up the stairs, "Who wants to come down and play
basketball?" Others will spend hours on the floor, perfecting shooting,
passing, and team-play on the theory that anything worth doing is worth
doing well. The difference in methods will be readily observed when
a team of one type meets a representative of the other.
But, when all is said and done, the healthy exercise will be fairly
evenly divided. The English trait of loving the sport without caring
much of a hang who wins is not apt to take much of a hold in America,
but it comes about as close as it ever will in tfiese rough-and-tumble, un
scientific, but entertaining intramural sports.
vStan ford is proud of her "peanut leaguers." In basketball and base
ball they are especially flourishing, and from now on many an intramural
forward or first baseman will watch his block "S" contemporary with a
critical and studious eye.
