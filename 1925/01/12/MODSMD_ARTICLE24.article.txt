## YES OR NO? QUICK! 
### Hal 
Some Stanford man wrote a song
not long ago entitled, "Why Don't the i
Pretty Girls Go to College?"
Why should they?
They learn too much in high school.
They learn that a half hour in a
beauty parlor improving the hair is
better than spending half hours im
proving what's under the hair.
They know that grammar never did
no one no good.
It is easier to accept a kiss than to
decline it. And more satisfaction re
sults.
They don't want papa to spend five
hundred a quarter to keep them in
school and clothes.
They would rather have him spend
the five hundred just on clothes.
A fur coat bought with the extra
ninety-six dollars may be a good in
vestment.
Of course the ninety-six dollars is
just the first installment.
One girl went out with a three-hun- :
dred-dollar outfit and came back with
a millionaire.
Quick return on the investment.
Now she can start a college of her
own. â€”ALUMNUS, B.A.
