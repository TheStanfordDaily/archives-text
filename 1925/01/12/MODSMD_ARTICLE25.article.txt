I would send thee, dear, a rose
Plucked, dew-dripping, just at dawn.
In my heart the blood-red rose
Wakens memories of you—
(Of your head, so gently droo
ping; your hair is crimson, too.)
So I send thee, dear, a rose,
Since It brings you to my mind;
(Do not think this, dear, a pose)
For its ruby glow I find
Just the color of your nose
Seen at dawn. —GOLIATH.
