# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT

<$>
The Editor —Sir:
I read in your columns that the
Euphronia Debating Society is spon
soring a public discussion of a ques
tion which is generally conceded to be
real and important on the campuses of
the larger universities of the country
today.
I wish to express my belief that the
discussion group or open forum is one of
the most valuable means when rightly
conducted of sharing viewpoints and in
the long run of arriving at sane conclu
sions. Harrison Elliott, one of Amer
ica's foremost directors of group think
ing writes, "Group thinking is essen
tially the instrument of democracy. It
assumes the right of the rank and file
of folks to think and decide for them
selves. In this regard it is directly in
opposition to many Bible classes, reli
gious and other meetings, where it is
assumed that the teacher of the class or
the leader of the meeting has the truth
and his function is to win those present
to hfc point of view. In a discussion it
is assumed that the group has a right to
come to its own opinion tven though it
may disagree with that of the leader. In
deed that of the leader should be in
tegrated; Group thinking n|nd propa
ganda are in dircct opposition to each
other."
We often run across criticisms to the
effect that there is a stultifying confor
mity in the life and thinking of the aver
age college student. This conformity
leads to intellectual stagnation. Whether
this is true at Stanford or not, we cer
tainly need the stimulus that group dis
cussion can give.
I believe that there should be a regu
lar time and place for such discussion
and that the group should be composed
of both men and women students and
faculty representing the whole gamut of
opinions and temperaments. We have
the motto, "The wind of freedom blows,"
but where is the great liberal club or
forum which ought to be a power in such
an institution as Stanford?
Euphronia is offering an opportunity
for group discussion Tuesday night.
There arc likely a good many others be
sides myself who are interested in the
success of open student forums where
not only campus problems can be freely
discussed but basic social problems of our
day as well. —Edwin Vail.
