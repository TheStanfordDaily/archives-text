# CHICAGO GETS DOCUMENTS OF ELIZABETHAN PERIOD
## 
### 
Manuscripts once in the possession
of Sir Nicholas Bacon are now in the
hands of the University of Chicago.
There are nearly two thousand docu
ments in the collection, some of which
are of great importance historically.
There are deeds, and some letters
signed by prominent Elizabethans, in
cluding Queen Elizabeth herself. It is
expected that a careful study of these
papers wiJl change some phases of
history.
