# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT

### 
The Editor —Sir:
You invite discussions on Friday's
editorial, and I herewith give my opin-1
ion on some of the statements.
Except for a few obvious inaccura
cies (such as the wearing of cords by
sophomores!), which may be excused,
there are germs of truth in practically
every paragraph.
What the author has to say about
fraternities and class distinctions is j
true enough. The greatest fault of the !
American student lies in the overde- !
✓ i
velopment of one of his greatest vir- !
tues, namely, his collectivism. His -
strong esprit de corps patterns and moulds
him too far, and the rewards aro for i
the "lockstep" type of man who con-1
forms to the prevailing ideas of his {
college. Everything he does is, or must j
be, done to order. If he attempts to do I
otherwise, violence is visited upon
him, or he suffers ostracism. Poor stu- j
dent! This state of affairs prevails at |
Stanford; it cannot be denied.
However, it does not follow that the |
student must needs be a man of ere-1
j
ative power, for such men are few— j
they are born, not made. But the stu- i
dent, to quote from H. F. Osborn, 1
"must be a man of some degree of cen- (
trifugal force, of individuality, of
critical opinion, who must make over
what is read into conversation and
into life." I have been here for four
years and do not believe I have met
more than three Stanford students
who could fully conform to these spe
cifications.
Outside the classrooms, students are I
in a contest with their intellectual en- !
vironments, and it is sad to be forced j
to relate that Stanford students are !
generally at the losing end. Being ac
customed to having most of their
thinking done for them, it is too pain
ful mentally and physically even to
attempt any productive thinking, the
chief means as well as the chief end
of education. "Morally, according to
Ferrero, politically, according to Bryce,
and economically, according to Car
negie," we students "are in the midst
of a triumphant democracy." But in
the world of ideas such as sways the
more advanced European countries,
we are in the midst of a "triumphant
mediocrity." To illustrate forcibly the
truth of the writer's charge that "The
center of gravity is in the world of
action far more than in the world of
thought," need I mention that those
who display the greatest athletic abil
ity regularly receive inch-high news
paper hedlines, while brilliant student
scholars and scientists in. the making
languish unknown and unsung in the
library and in the science laboratories?
Last autumn there were 226 under
graduates in Mechanical Engineering,
201 in Economics, and only two in
Botany and three in Germanic Lan
guages. This is sufficient proof of the
veracity of the statement that "Pure
science and the purely cultural sub
jects . . . are usually neglected."
Why 1 ? The reason is obvious: the lat
ter subjects require so much mental
effort and outside study that practi
cally no time remains for participation
in a half-dozen athletic activities. In
England conditions are exactly the re
verse, hence the surprise of the eco
nomics student. —D. A. Johansen.
