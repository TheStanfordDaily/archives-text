# ABSENCE OF O'CONNOR WEAKENS CARDINAL SWIMMING VARSITY
## 
### 
With the failure of Oaptain Wally
O'Connor to return to school this quar
, ter and the ineligibility of Stanley
| Belcher, veteran paddler, prospects for
a bannqr season in swimming and
water polo are somewhat dimmed.
O'Connor was chosen to lead the
1925 varsity mermen after his brilliant
performance last season, and his loss
will be a severe one. Coach Ernie
Brandsten is still confident of putting
out a creditable aggregation, however.
With the exception of Belcher, all his
charges have survived the faculty axe
and are in good condition as the result
of plenty of practice last quarter.
Arden Allen, who came through in
fine style in the P. A. A. meet, the
only competition of the fall season, is
j expected to step forward and fill
I O'Connor's suit handily. Although he
I has had only one year of varsity swim
ming, he has made constant improve
, ment and shows promise for the fu-
I ture.
Belcher and O'Connor are both sea
t soned water polo men, and it is in that
game that their absence will be most
keenly felt. But with the important
series with the Olympic Club not sche
duled until the latter part of February,
Brandsten will have ample time to
groom men to fill the breach.
