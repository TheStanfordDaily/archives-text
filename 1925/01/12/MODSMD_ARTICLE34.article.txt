### 
Appointment of Mrs. Marylyn M.
Thomas, acting postmaster of the Stan
ford postoffice since 1920, as University
postmaster, has been confirmed by the

by this appointment, will continue dur
ing President Calvin Coolidge's term
of office.
The Stanford postoffice, located about
a mile from Palo Alto, the nearest com
munity, serves a shifting population of
4,000. Its business equals that of the
Monterey postoffice. Normally a force
of four assistants handle the mails. This
force is increased in busy seasons to ten
or eleven by addition of students, working
their way through the University, who
have taken the civil service examination.
P<usiness done by the Stanford post
office is peculiar in that an extraordinar
ily heavy second class mail distribution is
handled. Many students receive news
papers from home. Two hundred and ten
suitcases of laundry are shipped to and
from homes each week. Increase of gen
eral business brought" about an enlarge
ment of the building recently by construc
tion of a 20-foot extension across the
back and installation of 500 new boxes,
bringing the total to 1500.
Mrs. Thomas graduated from Stanford
with the class of 1898, and by virtue of
her long interest in the University has a
sympathetic understanding of problems
peculiar to this postoffice. She js the
widow of Chester A. Thomas, mining en
gineer who died in Alaska in 1922.
