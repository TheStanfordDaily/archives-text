# DR. JORDAN SPEAKS AT VESPER SERVICES

"The pursuit of happiness is a some
what narrow trail," commented Dr. Jor
dan, speaking to the women at their
weekly vesper service at Roblc yesterday
afternoon. "What constitutes happiness
cannot be learned offhand, but each must
realize it for herself. How much pro
priety, how much religion, is essential
for happiness? Some conventions are
not vital, while others are reality. The
same is true of religion. And the real
ities of both must not be disregarded."
"I often think of a hotel barber, who
had chalked onto his mirror, 'The great
est pleasure is the conquest of an evil
habit,' " said Dr. Jordan, using the ex
ample to show individual ideas of happi
ness.
Lois Olmstead played the prelude to
the meeting and gave a piano solo, "Chan
son Triste," of Tsaikowski. Elizabeth
Clapp sang "Pale Moon," by Frederick
Knight Logan, and "The End of a Per
fect Day," by Carrie Jacobs Bond, ac
companicd by Muriel Saxon. A prayer
of Robert Louis Stevenson's for self
forget fulness was read by Helen Lewis,
who conducted the vespers.
