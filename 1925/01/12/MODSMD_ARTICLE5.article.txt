# FACULTY DEFEATS VARSITY IN SEVEN INNING CONTEST. 4-3
## Many First String Players Are Absent From Wolter's Starting Lineup 
### 
Faculty members waxed humorous
and gave the varsity baseball squad
the horsehide laugh last Friday after
noon, handing them a 4 to 3 defeat on
the varsity lot.
The Instructors started the ball roll
ing in their half of the first inning
when Pratt oozed the ball between
second and third for a single.
Before three men were counted out,
they had brought their total to two.
The varsity retaliated, went one better,
and held the one run lead until the
last half of the seventh.
In that frame, the faculty started a
big rally. Two men had crossed home
plate for tallies when "Lefty" May,
the varsity left fielder, brought it to an
end by laying down in front of a fast
grounder. His peg to third was perfect
and ended the inning.
The varsity went to bat again but
could not tally. Feeling the approach
of an ominous ninth inning, the faculty
talked the regulars into calling it
quits, thus letting the Instructors walk
into the showers with their 4 to 3 win.
In the absence of "Johnny" Couch,
who failed to show up as anonunced,
"Dink" Templeton did the moundwork
for the faculty. Cook Sypher was on
the receiving end.
Sypher is only a freshman but in
the absence of a first class faculty
catcher he was drafted to perform.
This he did and no doubt about it. He
shows wonderful form and is one of
Harry Wolter's best bets for the fresh
man team.
Many Substitutions
The varsity line-up was subject to
various and sundry substitutions and
the first string men were never all on
the field at the same time. Several
veterans were not even in uniform but
watched the game from the sidelines.
On the whole, it was a good work
out for the boys before they meet Cliff
Ireland's Independents next Wednes
day afternoon.
Considerable interest is being dis
played among campus baseball fans
over the approach of this series. This
will be the thirty-third year that Cliff
Ireland and his collection of stars have
i invaded the campus for the annual
series.
The Shamrock squad has already ad
mitted just how good it really is and
j tells of its nearing national fame. The
j fact is, Ireland always brings down a
1 first-rate team and a good supply of
Irish wit.
