# FRESHMAN QUINTET COPS FIRST GAME FROM SALINAS
## First Year Men Overwhelm High School Athletes By 22-9 Score 
### Harry Bennett 
Coach "Husky" Hunt's freshman
basketball aggregation got away to a
running start toward a successful sea
son when it bowled over {.he first op
ponent in its path, Salinas high school,
with a 22 to 9 score in the pavilion
last Saturday night.
Eighteen freshmen were sent into
the fray at various stages in order to
give all the best prospects a good op
portunity to exhibit their ability. Con
sequently, it was almost impossible
for one team to get working well to
gether and pile up larger score.
At the beginning of both halves the
high school team kept the babes out
of range of the baskets. After a few
moments, in both cases, they tired and
let the freshmen run over them for a
few baskets.
Defense Work Best
The 1928 men seemed to think more
of their defense work than they did
of the offense and when the original
line-up finally got something of its
stride in the second half, Salinas only
tallied two points during the remain
der of the game.
At half time the score stood four
teen to seven with the babes holding
the upper edge. Two of the freshmen's
biggest worries were Miller and Se
gretti of the Salinas squad. Both were
clever little players and were always
i nan open space ready to take the
ball.
Lack Finer Points
C. Moore, Vincenti, and Clark were
the high-lights for the babes. While
none of these are the equal of the
outstanding stars that started the
freshman season last year, they are
showing a good brand of playing but
are lacking in many of the finer points.
Clif Moore and Irving Nye started
the game as forwards for the babes.
They were good at getting the ball but
unble to make their shots count. Vin
centi was sent in for Nye and was the
second man in a good forward com
bination with Moore. He started a
short rally by sinking three baskets
in rapid succession. King added one on
a foul.
Entire Team Replaced
Then an entire new team went in.
In this change Dennis replced King
at center and what little he lacked in
jumping ability was made up by his
accurate shooting.
Windy Bigelow and Don Hill went
in for Davidson and Bill Clark.
When the first team went in again
in the second half they played loosely
for a few moments and Segretti of
Salinas added two points.
For quite a period neither team took
a shot, but the high schoolers soon
tired and Clif Moore and Bill Clark
sank a few on follow-up shots, adding
eight points.
The starting line-ups were:
Stanford Salinas
C. Moore F Thorup

at center and what little he lacked in
jumping ability was made up by his
accurate shooting.
Windy Bigelow and Don Hill went
in for Davidson and Bill Clark.
When the first team went in again
in the second half they played loosely
for a few moments and Segretti of
Salinas added two points.
For quite a period neither team took
a shot, but the high schoolers soon
tired and Clif Moore and Bill Clark
sank a few on follow-up shots, adding
eight points.
The starting line-ups were:
Stanford Salinas
C. Moore F Thorup
Nye F Segretti
King C Swenson
Clark G Miller
Davidson G Gabe
Coach "Husky" Hunt's freshman
basketball aggregation got away to a
running start toward a successful sea
son when it bowled over {.he first op
ponent in its path, Salinas high school,
with a 22 to 9 score in the pavilion
last Saturday night.
Eighteen freshmen were sent into
the fray at various stages in order to
give all the best prospects a good op
portunity to exhibit their ability. Con
sequently, it was almost impossible
for one team to get working well to
gether and pile up larger score.
At the beginning of both halves the
high school team kept the babes out
of range of the baskets. After a few
moments, in both cases, they tired and
let the freshmen run over them for a
few baskets.
Defense Work Best
The 1928 men seemed to think more
of their defense work than they did
of the offense and when the original
line-up finally got something of its
stride in the second half, Salinas only
tallied two points during the remain
der of the game.
At half time the score stood four
teen to seven with the babes holding
the upper edge. Two of the freshmen's
biggest worries were Miller and Se
gretti of the Salinas squad. Both were
clever little players and were always
i nan open space ready to take the
ball.
Lack Finer Points
C. Moore, Vincenti, and Clark were
the high-lights for the babes. While
none of these are the equal of the
outstanding stars that started the
freshman season last year, they are
showing a good brand of playing but
are lacking in many of the finer points.
Clif Moore and Irving Nye started
the game as forwards for the babes.
They were good at getting the ball but
unble to make their shots count. Vin
centi was sent in for Nye and was the
second man in a good forward com
bination with Moore. He started a
short rally by sinking three baskets
in rapid succession. King added one on
a foul.
Entire Team Replaced
Then an entire new team went in.
In this change Dennis replced King
at center and what little he lacked in
jumping ability was made up by his
accurate shooting.
