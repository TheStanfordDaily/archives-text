Two additional days have been given
to first tryouts for the annual Ram's
Head show. Because of certain types
yet undiscovered, Dave Mannoccir has
decided to continue the initial tryouts
until Tuesday evening in the hope of
bringing out more material.
Second tryouts are being held today
in the Assembly hall from 3 to 6 p.m.,
and again tomorrow from 3 to 6 p.m.
and 7 to 10 p.m. No tryouts will be
held tonight.

former member of the Russian Im
perial Ballet. She will begin her direc
tion the latter part of the week when

Frank Bascom, an undergraduate
transfer from Yale, will have supervi
sion of the costumes. Bascom is the
author of the 1923 Yale Prize Play and
