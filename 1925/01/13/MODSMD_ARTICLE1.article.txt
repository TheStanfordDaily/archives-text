# VARSITY TO OPEN SEASON TOMORROW WITH IRELAND NINE
## Independents Invade Campus in Thirty-Third Annual Series with Cards 
### Harry Bennett 
Cliff Ireland will open* the thirty
third annual series against the Stan
ford varsity nine on the Cardinal lot
at 2:30 tomorrow afternoon.
Captain "Chuck" Johnston and his
crew of regulars are lined up in good
form, and are ready to follow last
year's example of forgetting tradition
by winning the series.
Most of the stars that have played
with Ireland in past years are back at
their old posts. Ireland, himself, claims
that he has in charge a dandy bunch
of Shamrocks.
Cliff Has Reputation
The return of the Irish to the cam
pus will no doubt arouse the old inter
est and should draw a capacity crowd.
For years, Cliff has held the reputation
of being one of the world's wittiest
ball managers and sideline coaches.
When there is no one on bases to
talk to or about, he centers his atten
tion on the spectators and always pro
vides plenty of directions and sugges
tions. He is never content until he has
caught and played up some of his op
ponents' peculiarities.
Eig Leaguers With Ireland
Ritchie and Anfinson are both catch
ers of Big League fame, and will be
on hand to do the backstop work. On
the mound will be found one of Ire
land's strongest points.
The staff of pitchers that he totes
around with him looks more like the
line-up for some big league than it
does for an independent team.
They fiay be Independents, but that
does not keep them from having such
men as Ludolf, Ren Kelley, Puccinello,
Reppy, Cole, Manouk, and De Mayer
ready to step up to the box and
perform.
In the infield, Bert Ellison of the
San Francisco Seals is holding down
the initial sack. "Stew" Clark is cover
ing short, and Montague will take
third, leaving the second sack open
to Cliff Ireland himself.
In this position Cliff is usually the
starter wth Tanner filling in when
there is necessity of a little pepper
from the sidelines. #
First Real Game for Varsity
The varsity should be ready to op
pose this Irish crew as a unit, for the
