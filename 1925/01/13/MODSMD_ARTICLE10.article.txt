### 
The following resolutions in memory
of Judge Samuel F. Leib, one-time presi

Council:
"Judge Samuel Franklin Leib, for 32
years a trustee of Stanford University,
and seven years president of the Board,

the founders, and a personal friend,
Judge Leib was especially helpful to Mrs.
Stanford in the trying years following
the death of her husband. In the liti

Lieb's judgment, tact, and business sa

happy issue. For nearly half a century
he lias been a practicing attorney in San
Jose and has long held a leading place

qualities of good citizenship.
