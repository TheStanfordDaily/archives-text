Council:
"Judge Samuel Franklin Leib, for 32
years a trustee of Stanford University,
and seven years president of the Board,
died at his home in San Jose December
26, 1924. One of the trustees selected by
the founders, and a personal friend,
Judge Leib was especially helpful to Mrs.
Stanford in the trying years following
the death of her husband. In the liti
gation growing out of the government
suit, in the financial distresses due to the
panic of 1893, in the problems of- invest
ment and re-investment of funds, Judge
Lieb's judgment, tact, and business sa
gacity contributed greatly to the final
happy issue. For nearly half a century
he lias been a practicing attorney in San
Jose and has long held a leading place
in his profession. He was a man of
sterling integrity and great personal
charm, winning the respect and esteem
of his associates and of the whole com
munity. His interests were varied, and
he found special recreation and pleasure
in the development of his fruit and ranch
properties in Santa Clara county. His
death is a loss to the~community and to
the State of California.
"The Academic Council desires to put
on record its appreciation of his char
acter, his high service to the University,
and his lifelong exemplification of the
qualities of good citizenship.
"Resolved, That this tribute be spread
on the minutes of the Academic Coun
j cil and transmitted, with the sympathy of
this body, to the surviving members of
j the family."

"When William Herbert Carruth came
; to Stanford in 1913 as professor of Com
' parative Literature and executive head
j of the English department, he had al
ready achieved at the University of Kan
sas a distinguished academic and per
sonal career. There he took his Bach
elor's and Master's degree and began his
work as a teacher, rapidly advancing to
the rank of professor of Modern Lan
guages. To the same university he re
turned, after taking his Doctor's degree
at Harvard University, as professor of
the German Language and Literature.
For 26 years, from 1887 to 1913, he car
ried the duties of that position, and
through the later years of it, in addition,
important executive responsibilities as
Vice-Chancellor of the University. Dur
ing that period, too, he edited a number
of books in his chosen field, translated
significant works of foreign scholars,
and earned a recognized place in the
anthologies of American poetry. His
earnest activity in the work of his chosen
religious body led to his being elected,
in 1909, president of the National League
of Uunitarian Laymen. No less dis
tinguished was the influence he exerted
in his community as helpful and sympa
thetic teacher, public-spirited citizen, and
winning friend and neighbor.
"When Doctor Jordan called him to
Stanford in 1913 to take the place made
vacant by the death of Professor New
comer, Professor Carruth brought to
our University his trained capacity as
a scholar, his ripened human culture,
and his modest love of service. His
work among us was not so much in the
public eye, but those who were closest to
him—students,.colleagues, and friends—
knew best the unselfish generosity he put
into his work, the enriching influence
exerted by his sincere love of beauty and
of worthy living.
"In our appreciation of the fine-spirited
service that Professor Carruth has given
to our University and our community,
we, the Academic Council of Stanford
University, hereby record our deep sense
of loss in the death of our colleague and
friend, and direct that copies of these
resolutions be transmitted to the trustees
of the University and to the family,
whose bereavement we share."
