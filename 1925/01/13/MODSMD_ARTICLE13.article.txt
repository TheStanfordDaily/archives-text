# THIRD TRYOUTS FOR RAM'S HEAD WILL BE HELD TOMORROW
## Annual Production Draws 250 Tryoutees, Breaking All Previous Records 
### 
Selections for the cast and chorus
of Ram's Head show have simmered
down to the third tryouts.
A few second tryouts are being held
this afternoon in the Assembly hall,
and in the Little Theatre it 7:10 to
night. The list of those who should
appear is published below.
• Announcements Saturday
Dave Mannoccir hopes to conclude
the third tryouts by Wednesday night
and begin his final selections Thurs
day. The cast and chorus will un
doubtedly be announced Saturday
morning, by a list at the Green Room,
or in Monday's Daily.
Nearly 250 tryoutees appeared for
the initial tryouts, according to Man
noccir. This tops, by one hundred, aAy
previous records for the number of
tryoutees at a Ram's Head show.
Although the cast is quite complex
and requires actors of quality, Man
noccir's troubles are now arising in
the selection of certain types. His ma
terial is very good, he said yesterday,
making the "weeding out" process dif
ficult.
Real Comedy, No Burlesque
The Rani's Head committee has also
announced that it wishes to correct
the impression that the show is to be
a burlesque. Contrary to tradition, the
Ram's Head production this year is to
be first-class comedy with the usual
"situations" but no heavy burlesque.
For this reason, Mannoccir is looking
for actors, singers, and dancers of the
first water.
