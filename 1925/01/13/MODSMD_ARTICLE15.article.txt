# CLUB TEAMS SHARE COURT VICTORIES WITH ROW SQUADS
## A. K. L.'s, S. A. E.'s, Alpha Delts, Branner, Encina Quintets Win First Day 
### Al Post 
Three clubs and three fraternity
teams emerged victorious from the
first day of play in the intramural
basketball series yesterday. Poor pass
ing and ragged play generally was in
evidence in all six games.
The following are the figures: Alpha
Kappa Lambda 11, El Cuadro 2; Bran
ner First 12, El Capitan 10; Encina
3W 25, Theta Delta Chi 4; Sigma
Alpha Epsilon 19, El Campo 8; Encina
2E 10, El Tigre 8; Alpha Delta Phi 18,
Sequoia First 9.
El Cuadro didn't have a prayer in
the opener against Alpha Kappa
Lambda..The A. K. L.'s took the lead
early in the first half when Barnett
sunk a free throw, and succeeded in
blanking their opponents until the last
two minutes of play. Frasifer came
through with a field goal at that time
to save his club from being white
washed.
Cornell and Barnett shone at the
two forward positions for the frater
nity men, the former in particular
sinking several long shots from diffi
cult angles. Cornell was also high
point man with six tallies. Aside from
the work of this pair the game was
slow, both teams exhibiting poor team
work and inability to hold onto the
ball at critical moments. The half
ended with the A. K. L.'s leading 4 to 0.
Branner Firsts Surprise
Though failing to produce any par
ticularly brilliant basketball, the Bran
ner First-El Capitan struggle which
resulted in a 12 to 11 win for Branner
