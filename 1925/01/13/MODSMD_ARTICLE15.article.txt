# CLUB TEAMS SHARE COURT VICTORIES WITH ROW SQUADS
## A. K. L.'s, S. A. E.'s, Alpha Delts, Branner, Encina Quintets Win First Day 
### Al Post 
Three clubs and three fraternity
teams emerged victorious from the
first day of play in the intramural
basketball series yesterday. Poor pass
ing and ragged play generally was in
evidence in all six games.
The following are the figures: Alpha
Kappa Lambda 11, El Cuadro 2; Bran
ner First 12, El Capitan 10; Encina
3W 25, Theta Delta Chi 4; Sigma
Alpha Epsilon 19, El Campo 8; Encina
2E 10, El Tigre 8; Alpha Delta Phi 18,
Sequoia First 9.
El Cuadro didn't have a prayer in
the opener against Alpha Kappa
Lambda..The A. K. L.'s took the lead
early in the first half when Barnett
sunk a free throw, and succeeded in
blanking their opponents until the last
two minutes of play. Frasifer came
through with a field goal at that time
to save his club from being white
washed.
Cornell and Barnett shone at the
two forward positions for the frater
nity men, the former in particular
sinking several long shots from diffi
cult angles. Cornell was also high
point man with six tallies. Aside from
the work of this pair the game was
slow, both teams exhibiting poor team
work and inability to hold onto the
ball at critical moments. The half
ended with the A. K. L.'s leading 4 to 0.
Branner Firsts Surprise
Though failing to produce any par
ticularly brilliant basketball, the Bran
ner First-El Capitan struggle which
resulted in a 12 to 11 win for Branner
was easily the most interesting and
exciting one of the day. El Capitan
started like a whirlwind, and Branner
didn't seem to have an outside chance
to cop as it finished the half on the
short end of a 9 to 3 count.
Then Krotz, running guard on the
hall team, started to ring in baskets
and foul goals in droves, his final score
coming in the last minute of play, just
in time to send his team into the lead
for the first time and give it the
victory. "Lefty" May of the baseball
varsity went well at standing guard,
giving Krotz a good deal of timely
assistance. Evans played a nice game
at forward for El Capitan.
After the Branner outfit furnished
all the thrills of the afternoon, Theta
Delta Chi and the Encina 3W quintet
floundered through the dullest contest
on the card. The only thing which kept
the spectators awake was the neat ex
hibition of goal shooting put on by
Reasoner and Weaver of the freshman
team. The half found Encina leading
11 to 0.
S. A. E.'s Show Class
Sigma Alpha Epsilon's entry estab
lished itself as the smoothest combi
nation of the day by trouncing El
Campo 19 to 8 in the first evening
game. L. Gibbons led the S. A. E.
attack with ten points, but the whole
team showed a degree of co-ordination
rarely seen in an intramural five the
first day of the season. The passing
was good and the goal shooting fair.
At half time the score stood 9 to 2 in
favor of the S. A. E.'s.
El Campo played as good a brand of
ball as the average intramural quin
tet, but it measured up poorly to the
polished work of the winners. The
club men rallied during the second
half but were unable to overcome the
early lead of the Greeks.
Freshmen Take Another
Freshman hoop men gained their
second victory of the day when the
Encina 2E outfit won the verdict over
El Tigre 10 to 8 in a listless affair in
which both contestants were about
equally mediocre. The scorebook
showed the teams 6 up at the half way
point. A basket by Smid enabled En
cina to conclude the game two points
to the good. Nearly all the El Tigre
men contributed to their aggregation's
total.
Tennis stars made over into basket
ball forwards were a big factor in
Alpha Delta Phi's 18 to 9 victory over
the Sequoia Firsts in the final event.
Cran Holman and Phil Neer proved
too fast a scoring combination for the
hall men, and with the assistance of
Sid Meeks, running guard, accounted
for every one of their team's tallies.
Truman, Avilla, and Macabee per
formed creditably for the losers. At
half, the Alpha Delts led 11 to 7.
Tomorrow's Games
Tomorrow's games are scheduled as
follows: El Toro vs. Encina 4W, 4:15;
Theta Chi vs. Phi Sigma Kappa, 4:50;
Encina 3E vs. Delta Tau Delta, 7:15;

Encina 4E vs. Phi Kappa Sigma, 8:25.

ended with the A. K. L.'s leading 4 to 0.
Branner Firsts Surprise
Though failing to produce any par
ticularly brilliant basketball, the Bran
ner First-El Capitan struggle which
resulted in a 12 to 11 win for Branner
was easily the most interesting and
exciting one of the day. El Capitan
started like a whirlwind, and Branner
didn't seem to have an outside chance
to cop as it finished the half on the
short end of a 9 to 3 count.
Then Krotz, running guard on the
hall team, started to ring in baskets
and foul goals in droves, his final score
coming in the last minute of play, just
in time to send his team into the lead
for the first time and give it the
victory. "Lefty" May of the baseball
varsity went well at standing guard,
giving Krotz a good deal of timely
assistance. Evans played a nice game
at forward for El Capitan.
After the Branner outfit furnished
all the thrills of the afternoon, Theta
Delta Chi and the Encina 3W quintet
floundered through the dullest contest
on the card. The only thing which kept
the spectators awake was the neat ex
hibition of goal shooting put on by
Reasoner and Weaver of the freshman
team. The half found Encina leading
11 to 0.
S. A. E.'s Show Class
Sigma Alpha Epsilon's entry estab
lished itself as the smoothest combi
nation of the day by trouncing El
Campo 19 to 8 in the first evening
game. L. Gibbons led the S. A. E.
attack with ten points, but the whole
team showed a degree of co-ordination
rarely seen in an intramural five the
first day of the season. The passing
was good and the goal shooting fair.
At half time the score stood 9 to 2 in
favor of the S. A. E.'s.
El Campo played as good a brand of
ball as the average intramural quin
tet, but it measured up poorly to the
polished work of the winners. The
club men rallied during the second
half but were unable to overcome the
early lead of the Greeks.
Freshmen Take Another
Freshman hoop men gained their
second victory of the day when the
Encina 2E outfit won the verdict over
El Tigre 10 to 8 in a listless affair in
which both contestants were about
equally mediocre. The scorebook
showed the teams 6 up at the half way
point. A basket by Smid enabled En
cina to conclude the game two points
to the good. Nearly all the El Tigre
men contributed to their aggregation's
total.
Tennis stars made over into basket
ball forwards were a big factor in
Alpha Delta Phi's 18 to 9 victory over
the Sequoia Firsts in the final event.
Cran Holman and Phil Neer proved
too fast a scoring combination for the
hall men, and with the assistance of
Sid Meeks, running guard, accounted
for every one of their team's tallies.
Truman, Avilla, and Macabee per
formed creditably for the losers. At
half, the Alpha Delts led 11 to 7.

Three clubs and three fraternity
teams emerged victorious from the
first day of play in the intramural
basketball series yesterday. Poor pass
ing and ragged play generally was in
evidence in all six games.
The following are the figures: Alpha
Kappa Lambda 11, El Cuadro 2; Bran
ner First 12, El Capitan 10; Encina
3W 25, Theta Delta Chi 4; Sigma
Alpha Epsilon 19, El Campo 8; Encina

Sequoia First 9.
El Cuadro didn't have a prayer in
the opener against Alpha Kappa
Lambda..The A. K. L.'s took the lead
early in the first half when Barnett
sunk a free throw, and succeeded in
blanking their opponents until the last
two minutes of play. Frasifer came
through with a field goal at that time
to save his club from being white
washed.
Cornell and Barnett shone at the
two forward positions for the frater
nity men, the former in particular
sinking several long shots from diffi
cult angles. Cornell was also high
point man with six tallies. Aside from
the work of this pair the game was
slow, both teams exhibiting poor team
work and inability to hold onto the
ball at critical moments. The half
ended with the A. K. L.'s leading 4 to 0.

nation of the day by trouncing El
Campo 19 to 8 in the first evening
game. L. Gibbons led the S. A. E.
attack with ten points, but the whole
team showed a degree of co-ordination
rarely seen in an intramural five the
first day of the season. The passing
was good and the goal shooting fair.
At half time the score stood 9 to 2 in
favor of the S. A. E.'s.
El Campo played as good a brand of
ball as the average intramural quin
tet, but it measured up poorly to the
polished work of the winners. The
club men rallied during the second
half but were unable to overcome the
early lead of the Greeks.
Freshmen Take Another
Freshman hoop men gained their
second victory of the day when the
Encina 2E outfit won the verdict over
El Tigre 10 to 8 in a listless affair in
which both contestants were about
equally mediocre. The scorebook
showed the teams 6 up at the half way
point. A basket by Smid enabled En
cina to conclude the game two points
to the good. Nearly all the El Tigre
men contributed to their aggregation's
total.
Tennis stars made over into basket
ball forwards were a big factor in
Alpha Delta Phi's 18 to 9 victory over
the Sequoia Firsts in the final event.
Cran Holman and Phil Neer proved
too fast a scoring combination for the
hall men, and with the assistance of
Sid Meeks, running guard, accounted
for every one of their team's tallies.
Truman, Avilla, and Macabee per
formed creditably for the losers. At
half, the Alpha Delts led 11 to 7.

Three clubs and three fraternity
teams emerged victorious from the
first day of play in the intramural
basketball series yesterday. Poor pass
ing and ragged play generally was in
evidence in all six games.
The following are the figures: Alpha
Kappa Lambda 11, El Cuadro 2; Bran
ner First 12, El Capitan 10; Encina
3W 25, Theta Delta Chi 4; Sigma
Alpha Epsilon 19, El Campo 8; Encina
2E 10, El Tigre 8; Alpha Delta Phi 18,
Sequoia First 9.
El Cuadro didn't have a prayer in
the opener against Alpha Kappa
Lambda..The A. K. L.'s took the lead
early in the first half when Barnett
sunk a free throw, and succeeded in
blanking their opponents until the last
two minutes of play. Frasifer came
through with a field goal at that time
to save his club from being white
washed.
Cornell and Barnett shone at the
two forward positions for the frater
nity men, the former in particular
sinking several long shots from diffi
cult angles. Cornell was also high
point man with six tallies. Aside from
the work of this pair the game was
slow, both teams exhibiting poor team
work and inability to hold onto the
ball at critical moments. The half
ended with the A. K. L.'s leading 4 to 0.
Branner Firsts Surprise
Though failing to produce any par
ticularly brilliant basketball, the Bran
ner First-El Capitan struggle which
resulted in a 12 to 11 win for Branner
was easily the most interesting and
exciting one of the day. El Capitan
started like a whirlwind, and Branner
didn't seem to have an outside chance
to cop as it finished the half on the
short end of a 9 to 3 count.
Then Krotz, running guard on the
hall team, started to ring in baskets
and foul goals in droves, his final score
coming in the last minute of play, just
in time to send his team into the lead
for the first time and give it the
victory. "Lefty" May of the baseball
varsity went well at standing guard,
giving Krotz a good deal of timely
assistance. Evans played a nice game
at forward for El Capitan.
After the Branner outfit furnished
all the thrills of the afternoon, Theta
Delta Chi and the Encina 3W quintet
floundered through the dullest contest
on the card. The only thing which kept
the spectators awake was the neat ex
hibition of goal shooting put on by
Reasoner and Weaver of the freshman
team. The half found Encina leading
11 to 0.
