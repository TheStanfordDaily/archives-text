# DR. CARNEY STRESSES EDUCATION PROBLEMS IN RURAL DISTRICTS
## 
### 
Dr. Mabel Carney, of the Teachers
College, Columbia University, stressed
the importance of the rural education
situation in an address before the
Education Club in the Women's Club
house last night.
"The rural situation is vitally im
portant because the whole nation is
dependent upon the country," she de
clared.
Dr. Carney attributes discontent in
rural districts to marketing, prices,
and taxation. She believes that the
picture of the prosperity of the farmer
is overdrawn.
School Terms Shortened
There are six and one-half million
children in country schools who are
directly influenced or thwarted by
rural conditions. In many districts, the
school term can be only seven months
and in some cases only four months,
due to bad roads, bad weather condi
tions and child labor. This latter is
the greatest evil of the country. There
are over a million children engaged in
child labor in the United States be
tween the ages of ten and fifteen and
over 72 per cent are in the country,
particularly the southern states. A di
rect result of child labor is illiteracy
and in some southern states 25 per
cent of the population is unable to
read or write.
The question of teachers and teacher
training in rural education is a big
one. One-half of the teachers in coun
try schools are not high school gradu
ates. Another evil of rural districts is
improper administration. There is lit
tle true supervision and in most cases,
that is very poor.
Recent Progress
The progress within the last few
years has been great. Recently there
has been an effort to have better
buildings, and teacher training has
made progress. Another helpful factor
lias been the health inspection of the
country schools. Universities have
done much in forwarding progress by
installing distinct departments for
| training teachers in the field of rural
! education alone.
"The remedies of this situation have
not been worked out completely," said
1 Dr. Carney, "but a few of the outstand
! nig ones are: a better understanding
and appreciation of rural life prob
lems, some legislation, greater local
effort on the part of the farmers and
some Federal assistance in education.
: This is one of the most vital of Amer
i ica's problems."
