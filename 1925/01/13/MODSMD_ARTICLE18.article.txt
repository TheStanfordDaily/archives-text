James Harvey Robinson, keen critic of a man's social system, remarks
that of all man's institutions, man himself is least willing to hear the
social structure disparaged. Let science be applied to nature; it has noth
ing to do with the ordering of man's social life. The attitude is akin to
that which causes "hundred per cent Americans" to rail at those who do
not conform to their conventional patriotic standards in times of external
unpleasantness. It even reminds us of the mental state which employs
the examination paper to enforce conformity on the flaccid college intel
ligence.
G. Sherwood Eddy, speaker of international note, comes to Stanford
tomorrow for a stay of two days. Elsewhere in this edition Mr. Eddy's
topics are listed as "The Challenge of the Present World Situation," "The
Challenge of the Campus Situation," and "What's the Big Thing in Life."
Of immediate interest to college communities is the second topic. At the
present time there is being carried on by at least two national educational
associations extensive research on all phases of campus life in American
universities. Mr. Eddy has their latest findings.
If we are informed correctly, Mr. Eddy has marked abilities as a
speaker. His words should prove interesting to all. That they will prove
palatable to the student body as a whole is, as Mr. Robinson says of all
social critiques, extremely doubtful. â€”D. C. McK.
