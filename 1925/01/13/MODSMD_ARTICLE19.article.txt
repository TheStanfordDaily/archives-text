Debating at Stanford for some time past has been relegated to a
standard below that of its natural merits as an activity. Recently there
has been an emergence from the depths, by the slow, sure process of
securing important contests for campus teams.
Now comes a society, chiefly engaged in that takes the bit in
its mouth, to rise or fall in one rather dramatic gesture.
Did the leaders of this movement consider that they are discussing a
question upon which other universities are alleged to have spent much
time and effort, employing professional investigators? Did they con
sider that they are reflecting upon those University officials whose duty it
is to keep Stanford athletics clean?
Considered or not, these questions might well be overruled by a desire
for free speech, and an ambition to settle the question for once and for
all. The organization has provided an opportunity for those who have
seen fit to question Stanford's athletic ethics to prove their statements or
retract them. If the forum accomplishes either retraction or proof, it will
justify itself. If it clouds the question in long-winded, meaningless dis
course, it is discredited in the eyes of the campus public.
Time for dilly-dallying is gone. A show down has been called for.
