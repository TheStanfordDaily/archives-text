# LARGE TRACK SQUAD ANSWERS CALL OF COACH TEMPLETON
## 
### 
Coach "Dink" Templeton started the
1925 track season last night by giving
the men a stiff workout. All those who
had signed up for track, including the
varsity men, were treated in the same
manner.
To loosen up the unused muscles,
Templeton first administered setting
up exercises. The athletes are required
to go through these calisthenics every
afternoon before doing any running.
After trotting around the quarter
mile track, the men were paired off for
a 220-yard dash. The class paced an
other quarter mile before going in.
Most of the varsity men were out
yesterday limbering up. They included
Campbell, Gaspar, Miller, Richardson,
Smith, Kerr, Charles, Leistner, Dole,
Swayne, Kemnitzer, Richards, McCrey,
and Arthur.
The team has four tentative track
meets this season besides the Irish
Marathon, and the interclass event.
Dual meets with Nebraska and Oregon
are being arranged. Neither of these
teams have run against Stanford, and
there is much interest in the outcome
of such meets. Nebraska has already
decided to run against the Cardinals
on April 11.
The Olympic Club, with Marshal
Hale and Dick Mcintosh on its roster,
will be seen against Stanford in the
first real meet of the season. The Club
men lost to Stanford last season, 85
to 4fi, but (he competition was much
stronger than the score would indi
cate.
The Dig Meet with California, like
the other three meets, will be held in
the Stanford bowl. The team will make
no trips this season except to the Na
tional Championship in the East, and
the Pacific Coast Conference Meet at
Eugene, Oregon.
