# VETERAN RUNNERS HOLD FIRST TRACK PRACTICE OF YEAR
## 
### 
Track practice has started with
a large squad of veteran performers on
hand. The team that dealt California
such a decisive defeat last year is almost
wholly intact this season.
The recent loss of Marshall Hale will
be felt, although lan Campbell is on the
team again this year. In the Big Meet
last April Hale beat Campbell in the 220-
yard dash, but Campbell lead his team
mate in the century run. These two men
took sixteen of the possible eighteen
points in the sprints against the Bears.
Ted Miller won the quarter-mile event
last season and he is eligible again this
season, but Bill Storie and Van Judah,
who placed second and third, respective
ly, in the Big Meet, will not compete this
year. A1 Smith has been shifted to the
440. In 1924 Smith ran the mile and
was second only to Bill Kerr.
The half-mile run will be taken care of
by Bill Richardson, Bill Swayne, and
Norm Dole. Richardson annexed a place
in the 800-meter race in the Olympic
games last summer. Dick Mcintosh is
one of the alumni and is ineligible for
competition.
Teammates arc needed for Bill Kerr in
the mile. Elmer Elliot has graduated,
and Smith has been changed to the 440.
Cyphers and Clifford arc prospects for
the long run. Cyphers placed second to
Kerr in the freshmen meet two years
ago, but was unable to compete last sea
son because of sickness. Clifford is a
cross-country man and may be used in j

the mile or two-mile. Bob Cummings is
another likely miler.
A1 Charles was on the track Wednes
day night for the first time this quarter.
After being elected captain of the cross
country team last year, Charles was
forced to quit the sport with a bad heart.
He will run one of the longer races this
season.
Hugo Leistncr, Hal Boles, Clarence
West, and Crookshank have been out
working on the hurdles this week. Leist
ner and Boles arc block "S" men; West
was 1927 freshman track captain, and
Wells and Crookshank are transfers.
Big Jim Arthur is eligible for another
year on the cinderpath. It will be re
membered that Arthur broke a world's
record in the discus throw last year in
the I. C. A. A. A. A., but the officials
would not accept his distance because of
the strong wind that was blowing.
"Tiny" Hartranft will represent Stan
ford in the shot and discus for the last
time this year. Hartranft is out for a
world's record in one of the events. He
may be used in the 1-00-yard dash this
quarter. Dick Ricrards and "Biff" Hoff
man are also strong men. Hoffman was
high point man in the freshman meet at
Berkeley last April.
Anderson and Ludeke are out of the
high jump and Kemnitzer and Work
are left to take care of the event. But
worst of all, Donnis and Scofield have
graduated, leaving the pole vault open
to all comers. The javelin event is also
lacking in veterans.
Coach "Dink" Tcmplcton has not
picked a first squad as yet. He is out
looking the men over. A squad will be
chosen this week.
