# Aspiring Tennis Fans to Hold Meeting Thursday
## 
### 
Hal Davis, instructor of tennis, has
issued a call for tennis material and
requests that everyone interested in
either varsity or freshman teams come
to the Encina Gymnasium at 4 o'clock
on Thursday.
Tournaments were held last quarter
for all four classes and the results
brought to light many new stars, par
ticularly among the underclassmen. As
piring freshmen are particularly urged
to attend the meeting.
