### 
Among the names of the seven Fed
eral Students who received degrees
from the University in the quarter
just completed are those of A1 White,
Olympic diving champion, and Ralph
V. Ellis, who received the highest
scholastic recognition awarded a stu
dent â€”the Phi Beta Kappa key.
Federal Students are veterans of the
World War who received injuries
which incapacitated them for continu
ation of their pre-war occupations, and
who are being afforded the opportunity
of receiving a college education at
the expense of the Government.
Of. the seven graduates, three are
taking their degrees in Engineering,
two in Law, one in Biology, and one
Economics. White is entering the field
of engineering, while Ellis is leaving
to become head of the Department of
Biology at the State Teachers College
of Missouri. Sixty-six Federal Students
still remain in Stanford, though four
more will receive degrees in the pres
ent winter quarter.
Oliver Olson took charge of the
Federal Students of Stanford at the
commencement of the school in Octo
ber, coming from the San Francisco
office. According to Olson, Stanford
University is rated among the highest
in the country by the Federal Govern
ment, as a place to train men.
