# SOCCERITES TO PLAY TEACHERS TOMORROW
## 
### 
Harry Maloney's soccer eleven
meets the San Jose Teachers College
squad tomorrow in their first game of
the quarter.
The teachers have just recently
taken up soccer and since Maloney's
squad is disorganized, the game will
be more of a practice for both elevens
than a scheduled clash.
Nes Knowlin, a former Stanford ath
letic instructor, is coaching the San
Jose aggregation. This encounter will
be his first against the Card eleven.
Maloney's eleven will not be in first
class shape, however, due to the dis
banding of the squad last quarter. He
has not announced a definite lineup
but expects to pick one from such
members of the squad as appear to
morrow. Freshmen, as usual, are not
eligible.
