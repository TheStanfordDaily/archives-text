# PIEDMONT HIGH READY FOR CONTEST WITH BABE QUINTET
## 
### 
Coach Sam Moyer of Piedmont high
school will bring his crack aggregation
of basket tossers to the campus to
morrow night to meet the Stanford
babes in the pavilion at 8 o'clock. The
145-pounders will meet Palo Alto high
In the preliminary. I
Piedmont nas tour veterans in the
line-up, and has been playing an ex
ceptionally fast game all season. Last
Friday night the team was defeated
by the California freshmen by a score
of 33 to 29 in a nip-and-tuck affair.
Captain Ropie, Gil Weeks, and Dick
Johnson are all veteran players, and
starred in last week's encounter. Norm
Donant also plays a fast game for
Piedmont.
Cards Have Same Line-up
The Cards will begin with practi
cally the same line-up as last week.
Vincenti may be used as forward in
stead of Irv Nye. The showing made
by Vincenti against the Salinas team
proved worthy of comment when he
displayed some accurate shooting and
good floor work.
Last week the babes had been in
practice and under instruction only a
short while, and their intense drilling
on defensive work was so much in
their mind that they seemed to forget
all about offense.
In the first few moments, they wore
down the fast high school offense and
then went through to score. Roy Den
nis, substituting for center, was the
high light at these times, with several
good follow-up shots.
Bill Clark and Davidson at the guard
positions held off attack after attack
by the Salinas team and let them have
but very few shots.
Eighteen makes it al
most impossible to expect any great
teamwork. There were several good
plays and players, but during this
week of practice they have been
spending almost all of their time on
building up teamwork.
