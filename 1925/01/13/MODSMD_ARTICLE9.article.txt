# EUPHRONIANS ASK FOR VIEWS ON ATHLETICS
## Professionalism To Be Probed By Debaters at Meeting Tonight 
### 
Anonymous letters on any subject per
taining to college athletics are still being
accepted for reading and discussion at
the open forum being conducted by Eu
phronia Club tonight at 7:30 in the
Trophy Room of the Old Union. All
such communications should be ad
dressed to W. L. Goslin, Box 1005,
Campus.
Dr. Barrows, Comptroller Roth, Andy
Kerr, and "Husky" Hunt will discuss
different angles of the question of the
evening, "Is There Professionalism in
College Athletics?" The discussion will
not be limited to this subject, however,
but is expected to deal with every phase
of athletics and their relation to college
life.
The meeting is open to all who are
interested; wish to contribute any views,
or ask questions of the speakers.
It is expected that many revelations
will be made by the speakers as they
are all in close touch with the subject,
and are in a position to throw light on
a number of obscure points. Each one
will probably approach the subpect from
a different angle, depending upon his
relations to University athletics.
This is the first of a series of open
forums to be sponsored by Euphronia
which will deal with questions vital to
college men and women.
