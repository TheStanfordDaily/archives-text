# FRESHMAN QUINTET OPPOSES PIEDMONT HIGH IN PAVILION
## Tonight's Contest Should Be Good Indication of First Year Strength 
### John Levi 
First indications of the actual
strength of the freshman basketball
team will be obtained at 8 o'clock this
evening in the pavilion when the first
year men oppose the fast Piedmont
high school quintet.
The California freshmen were forced
to the limit to defeat the high school
aggregation by a bare four points last
Friday niglic. Sam Moyer, the Pied
mont coach, has four veterans from
his strong squad of last year in his
present line-up and his squad has made
a formidable showing against all the
high schools that it has met.
Captain Robie, Gil Weeks, Dick
Johnson, and Norm Donant are the
four veterans and it is predicted that
these men will cause the Stanford de
fense considerable trouble.
Defect Remedied
At the beginning of last week's
game the frosli showed an inclination
to disregard their offense and over-'
stress their defense. As a result they
did not succeed in penetrating the op
ponents' second line until the game
was well under way. The workouts
that they have gone through this week
have no doubt remedied this defect.
Altaffer, Dorcy, and Young donned
suits for the first time at practice
yesterday. There is a bare possibility
that these men may be declared eligi
ble. However, they will not participate
in this evening's contest.
The starting line-up has been con
siderably changed since last week.
Vincenti will take Nye's place at for
ward. Vincenti made a very impres
sive showing against Salinas, and has
continued to show up well during this
week's practice. Nye, who started out
well this season, slumped considerably,
but he is not out of the running.
Moore, who will occupy the other
forward berth, has played consistently
well. He is fast and, above all, is an
accurate shot.
Defense Is Strong
Bill Clark and Davidson, guards,
have proved practically impenetrable
and time after time they held off the
attack of the Salinas players, allow
ing them only a few shots.
The fight for the center position is
between Dennis and King, but in all
probability Denis will be called upon
first this evening. His ability to score
follow-up shots made him the nucleus
of the Stanford attack.
The number of substitutions in the
last freshman game made it impossi
ble to show any real teamwork, but
after several days of intensive practice
"Husky" Hunt has been able to formu
late a more definite opinion of the
various men and the team that goes
on the floor tonight should be a well
drilled one.
Rifle practice for women is offered
at Oregon Agricultural College.

suits for the first time at practice
yesterday. There is a bare possibility
that these men may be declared eligi
ble. However, they will not participate
in this evening's contest.
The starting line-up has been con
siderably changed since last week.
Vincenti will take Nye's place at for
ward. Vincenti made a very impres
sive showing against Salinas, and has
continued to show up well during this
week's practice. Nye, who started out
well this season, slumped considerably,
but he is not out of the running.
Moore, who will occupy the other
forward berth, has played consistently
well. He is fast and, above all, is an
accurate shot.
Defense Is Strong
Bill Clark and Davidson, guards,
have proved practically impenetrable
and time after time they held off the
attack of the Salinas players, allow
ing them only a few shots.
The fight for the center position is
between Dennis and King, but in all
probability Denis will be called upon
first this evening. His ability to score
follow-up shots made him the nucleus
of the Stanford attack.
The number of substitutions in the
last freshman game made it impossi
ble to show any real teamwork, but
after several days of intensive practice
"Husky" Hunt has been able to formu
late a more definite opinion of the
various men and the team that goes
on the floor tonight should be a well
drilled one.
Rifle practice for women is offered
at Oregon Agricultural College.
First indications of the actual
strength of the freshman basketball
team will be obtained at 8 o'clock this
evening in the pavilion when the first
year men oppose the fast Piedmont
high school quintet.
The California freshmen were forced
to the limit to defeat the high school
aggregation by a bare four points last
Friday niglic. Sam Moyer, the Pied
mont coach, has four veterans from
his strong squad of last year in his
present line-up and his squad has made
a formidable showing against all the
high schools that it has met.
Captain Robie, Gil Weeks, Dick
Johnson, and Norm Donant are the
four veterans and it is predicted that
these men will cause the Stanford de
fense considerable trouble.
Defect Remedied
At the beginning of last week's
game the frosli showed an inclination
to disregard their offense and over-'
stress their defense. As a result they
did not succeed in penetrating the op
ponents' second line until the game
was well under way. The workouts
that they have gone through this week
have no doubt remedied this defect.
Altaffer, Dorcy, and Young donned
suits for the first time at practice
yesterday. There is a bare possibility
that these men may be declared eligi
ble. However, they will not participate
in this evening's contest.
