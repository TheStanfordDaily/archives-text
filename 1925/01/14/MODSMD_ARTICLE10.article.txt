# STANFORD ATHLETICS CLEAN -- VERDICT OF EUPHRONIA
## 
### 
Full confidence regarding cleanli
ness in Stanford Athletics was ex
pressed to both the University admin
istration and the Board of Athletic
Control by a unanimous vote of the
mtire house at the open torum meet
ng of the Euphronia Debating Society
n the lobby of the Old Union last
light.
Four important instances which had
'ormerly created shadows of doubt in
he minds of some of those present
vere thoroughly discussed and cleared
ip by members of the faculty, coaches,
and other officials present.
These questions were brought up by
means of anonymous letters read by
the chairman. The audience, composed
of eighty students and officials, dis
cussed the questions pro and con. In
all cases they met with satisfactory
explanations.
The most important question con
cerned whether or not Stanford ath
letes were subsidized, by whom, and
did this make them professional.
Dean Culver explained that sixty
men were now registered students that
had all of their tuition, and books
paid for besides a regular salary of
$100 per month. These are Federal
Board students and in the past only
three of them have been varsity ath
letes.
Several alumni clubs have sent stu
dents here that were crippled and al
ways would be such. The entire ques
tion was explained very satisfactorily
to those present.
Other questions brought up were
the Norman Cleaveland case, Pop War
ner's salary, the Notre Dame game,
and why tickets to the big contests
sold for five dollars.
Graduate Manager Paul Davis brief
ly outlined four principles that he be
lieved would be a firm foundation upon
which cleanliness and non-profession
alism in college athletics could be
built. These included bonafide entrance
requirements, definite scholastic stand
ings, non-use of University funds for
high school athletes, non-use of Uni
versity funds for subsidizing athletes
in college.
He stated that this was the policy
strictly adhered to by Stanford and
feels that this would keep any college
from varying from the straight line.
Dr. Barrows Speaks
It is the belief of Dr. Barrow that
everyone, including students, alumni,
public, and faculty, take the matter of
sports altogether too seriously.
"The alumni feel that if their Alma
Mater does not win the majority of
the athletic events in which they par
ticipate, there is something wrong and
that the college is going to the dogs,"
said Dr. Barrow. "They then try to
get their young athlete friend inter
ested in going to their school and get
criticized from both sides.
"One should remember that, after
all, sports are only a preparation for
later life and should not be taken too
seriously. A lesser degree of serious
ness would eliminate criticism from a
great many sources."
