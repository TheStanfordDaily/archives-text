# FAST NUMBER NEARS PRESS TIME; CHAPPIE SNORTS A WARNING
## 
### 
Chappie arises to announce that only
five more days arc left in which humorist
and psuedo-luimorists may send in their
offerings for the Fast Number.
Close on the heels of this startling
statement comes a threat of murder. Sud- j
den and lasting death is promised to any |
and all who send in a gag concerning
a "fast male." Brilliant as this hunch
no doubt is, or was, there is a limit to
all things.
Art contributions, according to latest
news from the front, must he in right
away, if not sooner. The Old Boy also
send word around that he would like to t
create a clubby atmosphere around his
hangout. He invites his contributors toj
come around and make themselves per
sonally acquainted.
