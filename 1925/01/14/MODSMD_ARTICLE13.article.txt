# INDIVIDUALITY SHOWN BY DAVID ALBERTO IN CONCERT
## New Composition Presented For First Time Pleases; Chopin Also Played 
### Herbert Klein 
Individuality of interpretation and
style marked the piano recital by
David Alberto in the Assembly hall
last night. His new arrangement for
one piano of the Arensky "Value for
Two Pianos" was publicly played for
the first time.
Alberto's playing showed the effects
of the long seclusion which he has
been devoting to the development of
his technique. In his platform presence
he showed himself keenly sensitive to
every variation of tone and meaning.
Of the Chopin numbers comprising
the first two groups "Mazurka Opera
33, no. 4" and "Sonata B major"
showed the most lyrical feeling and
appeal. The element of dance rhythm
in the Mazurka was subordinated to
bring out its interpretative quality.
The "Piece de resistance" was the
sonata B major to the study of which
Alberto has devoted ten years. The
third movement of this is the "March
Funebre" known to everyone as
"Chopin's Funeral March."
His tone was even, and restrained,
but at times as, in his encore, Mc-
Dowell's "March winds," it was vi
brant and powerful. His playing was
never hurried or slighted. Most notice
able of all was the lack of the me
chanical type of playing.
In the Nocturne B Minor Opus 32
the emotional power of Chopin music
was revealed. The last number, "Al
legro di Concerto," was perhaps the
most rhythmical and spirited.
In successfully arranging the "Valse
for Two Pianos" as a solo number Al
berto showed skill. His version suf
fers nothing by comparison with the
original.
