# PASADENA ADOPTS STANFORD PARKING PLAN FOR ARROYO
## 
### 
When the Stanford men took over the
entire handling of the Rose Bowl for the
Notre Dame game they devised a sys
tem for handling the automobile traffic
that cleared 20,000 machines from the
Arroyo Scco in an hour, breaking all
former records by two or three hours.
In last Sunday's automobile section of
| a prominent Los Angeles paper, almost
i the entire first page is given over to pic
i turcs and discussion of what they call
the "Magic System."
j L. Harold Anderson, a Stanford grad
! uatc and the master mind behind opcra
| tion of the plan, is praised by the news
j papcrmcn for his efficiency in taking care
I of the traffic jam situation.
That his solution was the most suc
cessful ever used at the Rose Bowl may
| be realized by the fact that Pasadena has
\ just announced the adoption of the sys
tem for future fiestas, and has requested
Anderson to take charge again next year.
Gerard Wilson also came in for a share
of the praise in handling the distribution
of tickets. Almost 60,000 pasteboards
i were handled without a single difficulty.
Percy Hcckendorf was complimented
' for taking care of the seating arrange
ments. lie had charge of all the ushers.
