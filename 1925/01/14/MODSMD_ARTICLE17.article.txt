## 
### 
All three of the Oxford debaters who
•will meet the Stanford team January
22 have had the distinction of being
candidates for seats in the British
paliament. Malcolm Mac Donald, son
of the former premier, running on the
Labor ticket, polled only 750 votes less
than the winning contestant in a re
cent election, while his colleagues,
Christopher Hollis and C. H. Woodruff,
made good showings as Liberal party
nominees.
Membership in the Oxford Union,
university debating society, has made
the British trio familiar with parlia
mentary procedure and has enabled
them to cultivate the witty, often ban
tering, style of speaking which has
brought them victory over many
American colleges in debates where
the audience has done the judging.
About 1000 students hold member
ship in the Union and the average
attendance at each weekly meeting is
about 300. The presidency of the so
ciety and a like office in the boat club
are considered the two greatest hon
ors which can come to any Oxford
student. Mac Donald is a past presi
dent of the Union,
At the opening of every debating
meeting the president selects the topic
for the discussion and appoints teams
to uphold opposing sides of the ques
tion. Members who are on neither
team may gain permission to speak
by addressing the chair. When the de
bate is over the audience indicates its
preference by filing out of either one
or Iwo doors. The student s then re
enter the room and the subject is
thrown open for general discussion.
