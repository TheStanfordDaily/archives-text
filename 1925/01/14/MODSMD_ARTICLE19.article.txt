Writers and thinkers on the problem of education in America seem
almost unanimously agreed that our university system has many obvious
and defihite faults, chiefest among which is the machine like standardiza
tion brought about by the democratic ideal. The theory that all men are
created free and equally entitled to life, liberty and the pursuit of happi
ness would seem to have been stretched to mean that tjiey must be given
the same amounts of the same education before they are allowed to
specialize, even to the least degree, in the field of knowledge that interests
them. It is rather like'a mother warning her infant that unless he eats
his bread pudding he can have no ice cream.
But th&main point is to find the class or classes in American life that
are responsible for this state of affairs. It lias been pointed out that the
educators themselves, the faculties of our colleges, are aware of the evils
of the system. Why, then, are they unable or unwilling to bring about
a change? In answer to which we offer you the following quotation from
the public prints, issuing from the fluent pen of that eminent critic of
modern life, Mr. Arthur Brisbane:
"H. G. Wells worries about the American system of public school
education. He is much afraid that our manhood will be damaged because
our schoolboys are educated largely by women, while British boys are
educated by men. It is kind of Mr. Wells to worry, but he is wasting
time and energy in this case.
"If he will look into his own book of history, at some of his ancestors
with the big teeth, low forehead and heavy jaw. he will find that human
beings have changed. And he ought to know that they have been changed,
thanks to the fact that men have tjeen educated by their MOTHERS.
"Women have educated, not only the boys, but also the men. gradually
taking the brutality out of them. And that's what they need. On the
lap of his mother, and at her knee, man has been changed from the tra
glodyte, that used to crack his neighbor's thigh bone to get at the marrow,
into our present imitation of civilization. Women can teach the schoolboy
justice, kindness, courage, patience and concentration. What other manly
characteristics does the man teach?
"The only teacher that Abraham Lincoln ever had was a woman, his
stepmother. She did pretty well. The right woman for a mother and the
right woman for a teacher, will turn out men sufficiently manly, as Wells
will learn from Lincoln's history."
With which characteristic Rotarian Gecture toward the venerate
figure of Mr. Lincoln, our learned sage turns his critical and microscopic
mind on the financial affairs of this great and glorious republic. We sin
cerely hope that the attention of Mr. Wells and the followers of Darwin
and Wallace has been called to the importance of MOTHERS as a factor
in the process of evolution, and that from the fertile mind of Mr. Bris
bane we may have a work on this subject, possibly entitled "Evolution;
from Monkey t oPollyanna (and back again.)" Moreover, we would be
equally interested in an essay on the mothers or stepmothers of famous
men, which would clear up in the minds of some of us that mothers have
been distributed rather widely by an All-wise Providence, and that (unless
our memory is at fault) Judas Iscariot received the same portion in this
phase of his life as Mr. Lincoln.
In the face of this sweet tasting dose of paregoric for the mentally
ill, is it any wonder that the educators and the students, the two parties
most directly concerned, are unable to bring about the much-needed
changes in our university system. It is admitted that education today is a
matter of machinery, and hence must be governed by the factors control
ling mass production. And one of these cardinal factors is the law that
the demand, and not the producer, controls the output. That the demand
is not for a thoroughly educated man is evident. From the Baptist belt
is heard the raucous cry of the Fundamentalists, bellowing their inane
charges against evolution like mastodons calling across primordial swamps,
while from the Hearst organs of public opinion we have a criticism like
the above, written by the mentally deficient for the mentally lazy. Quite
in accord with modern social practice, we again reach the ultimate con
sumer, and as long as American life is so organized that the young men
of the nation must train themselves for a livelihood and not for life, the
university will continue to turn out vast hordes of future Kiwanians at
the expense of the serious minded men who might contribute to the
culture and intellectual wealth of a great nation. —E. R. S.
The "professionalism" bogey was taken out and aired last night at
the Euphronia forum. Those who went to the meeting with a vague feel
ing of discontent of the order of things in Stanford athletics, went away
reassured. Stanford athletics arc clean.
The expected furor, from those people who have seen fit to publicly
question the administration, failed to develop. Dr. Barrow, Paul Davis,
Dean Culver, Andy Kerr. Harry Maloney and Dr. Williams answered
every question put to them to the satisfaction of their questioners.
To Euphronia goes the honor of thoroughly thrashing out a trouble
some problem efficiently. If that problem ever arises again, may it have
no more justification than has been found in the episode just closed.
