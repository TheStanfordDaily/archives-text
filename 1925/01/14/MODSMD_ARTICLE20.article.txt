## ADDITIONAL INDUCEMENT OFFERED TITLE WRITERS 
### Hal 
Since not more than 100 titles for
the Cabbage mystery picture have
been submitted, an additional induce
ment has been offered to those am
bitious for the generous prizes.
The latest contribution which has
threatened to capture first prize in
the title contest is the review of the
"Torch Bearers."
The following is an excerpt from an
un-named opera. The touching ro
mance, of this affecting ballad will, no
doubt, appeal to all of Cabbage's large
and intelligent clientele.
And to those who call at the office
with a contribution —or any other aid
to singing—the tune to these words
will be taught by one of Cabbage's
vocal experts. The winning title will
be used to designate song as well as
picture.

(with sprlghtliness)
Oh the hosts of the Prohphet were many
and bold.
And quite unaccustomed to fear,
And of all, the most reckless of life or
of gold
Was Abdul de Bulbul Alfnir.
If you wanted a man to rally the van,
Or harass the foe from the rear.
Or to storm a redoubt you had but to shout
For Abdul de Bulbul Amfr.
Now in the hosts of the Russians were
men known to fame
In the armies then led by the Czar,
And the greatest of these was a man by
the name
Of Ivan Skavinsky Skivar.
He could imitate Irving, tell fortunes with
cards,
And strum on the Spanish Guitar.
In fact* quite the cheese of the Musvo
vitees
Was Ivan Skavinsky Skivar.
One day, this bold Russian, he shouldered
his gun,
Put on his most cynical sneer,
And was looking for fun, when he hap
pened to run
Into Abdul de Bulbul Amir.
"Young man," quoth Abdul, "has your
life grown so dull
That you're willing to end it right here?
For now you must know you have trod on
the toe
Of Abdul de Bulbul Amir."
"Oh take your last look on the sunshine
and brook.
From you I have nothing to fear. "
From which I imply, you are going to die,
Mister Abdul de Bulbul Amir."
And the bold Russian Duke siezcd his
trusty skibook.
And shouting a wild Slavic cheer,
On slaughter intent, he ferociously went
For Abdul de Bulbul Amir.
Oh the Sultan rode out to witness the
bout,
And hand to the victor a beer.
He arrived at the strife as the last signs
of life
Left Abdul de Bplbul Amir.
Then the Czar he came up to witness the
fight,'
The noise he had heard from afar.
He saw with disgust, that biting the dust
Was Ivan Skavinsky Skivar.
(Slowly and with solemnity)
Oh there rises a stone where the Blue
Danube flows,
Inscribed with characters clear,
"Oh stranger remember to pray for the
soul
Of Abdul de Bulbul Amir."
Oh a muscovite maiden her vigil doth
keep
By the light of the Great Northern Star,
And the name she so often repeats in her
sleep
Is Ivan Skavinsky Skivar.

Friends and relatives of the seventy
four former Stanford students who
passed into educational oblivion with
the termination of the Autumn quar
ter, will join in the deep-sorrow felt
by the Committee on Scholarship in
their great loss.

Since not more than 100 titles for
the Cabbage mystery picture have
been submitted, an additional induce
ment has been offered to those am
bitious for the generous prizes.
The latest contribution which has
threatened to capture first prize in
the title contest is the review of the
"Torch Bearers."
The following is an excerpt from an
un-named opera. The touching ro
mance, of this affecting ballad will, no
doubt, appeal to all of Cabbage's large
and intelligent clientele.
And to those who call at the office
with a contribution —or any other aid
to singing—the tune to these words
will be taught by one of Cabbage's
vocal experts. The winning title will
be used to designate song as well as
picture.

Oh the hosts of the Prohphet were many
and bold.
And quite unaccustomed to fear,
And of all, the most reckless of life or
of gold
Was Abdul de Bulbul Alfnir.
If you wanted a man to rally the van,
Or harass the foe from the rear.
Or to storm a redoubt you had but to shout
For Abdul de Bulbul Amfr.
Now in the hosts of the Russians were
men known to fame
In the armies then led by the Czar,
And the greatest of these was a man by
the name
Of Ivan Skavinsky Skivar.
He could imitate Irving, tell fortunes with
cards,
And strum on the Spanish Guitar.
In fact* quite the cheese of the Musvo
vitees
Was Ivan Skavinsky Skivar.
One day, this bold Russian, he shouldered
his gun,
Put on his most cynical sneer,
And was looking for fun, when he hap
pened to run
Into Abdul de Bulbul Amir.
"Young man," quoth Abdul, "has your
life grown so dull
That you're willing to end it right here?
For now you must know you have trod on

Of Abdul de Bulbul Amir."
