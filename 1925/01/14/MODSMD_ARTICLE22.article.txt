Abraham Lincoln —Stanford.
When you see Abraham Lincoln, and
we hope you will, go in the right frame
of mind. By this we mean prepare
yourself for recreation rather than en
tertainment. The picture, we are
pleased to say, is not an attempt to
amuse the great American Public. On
the contrary it is a good and sincere
effort to portray the life of Abraham
Lincoln. After some of the historical
distortions which have lately flooded
the motion picture market, this sort of
thing is a welcome change.
The producers have made no effort
to weave into the play any artificial
plot; instead they have relied alto
gether upon the dramatic element of
fered by the simple and unadorned
story of Lincoln's life. The only draw
back to this plan is a slight "draggi
ness" in the early parts. Ample recom
pense is made for this, however, in
the tense and real drama which
marked the closing stages in the
career of the martyr president.
Only one criticism might be made.
The story lacks unity. It appears to
be more a series of incidents than a
continuous narrative.
Oh yes, one thing more. We wish,
most sincerely, that we had been
spared the touching battle scene in
which father and son meet as enemies.
We have witnessed some dozen or
more American Civil Wars (on the
screen) and because of just such
scenes as this, we carry with us the
impression that the conflict was made
up of a number of family disagree
ments in which fathers and sons made
a special point never to get on the
same side.
So far as we have observed, in no
case did the military authorities fail
to arrange a family reunion in the
thick of battle. . —S. O'D.

Just why the producers of this pic
ture insisted upon introducing, indi
vidually and by name, a staggering
number of characters, we do not know.
Most of them had nothing to do with
what plot the story offered, and even
if they had vitally affected it, one
would hardly be repaid for any mental
effort he put forth in following them.
We could see through this alleged
plot about three minutes after the first
scene (and we do not follow Conan
Doyle). It is the insipid small town
doctor story, with the deserted woman,
her crippled child, and the delicate
operation thrown in for cheap emo
tional effect.
It is worthy of note that everyone
who was within a radius of ten miles
of the studio is mentioned as having
had something to do with the atrocity.
We infer that what was lacking was
some big, strong man who would take
the full responsibility.
The suggestion of the management
that the audience refrain from cheering

is unnecessary. The picture does not
inspire that sort of thing. S. O'D.

So far as we have observed, in no
case did the military authorities fail
to arrange a family reunion in the
thick of battle. . —S. O'D.
Lovers' Lane—Varsity *
Just why the producers of this pic
ture insisted upon introducing, indi
vidually and by name, a staggering
number of characters, we do not know.
Most of them had nothing to do with
what plot the story offered, and even
if they had vitally affected it, one
would hardly be repaid for any mental
effort he put forth in following them.
We could see through this alleged
plot about three minutes after the first
scene (and we do not follow Conan
Doyle). It is the insipid small town
doctor story, with the deserted woman,
her crippled child, and the delicate
operation thrown in for cheap emo
tional effect.
It is worthy of note that everyone
who was within a radius of ten miles
of the studio is mentioned as having
had something to do with the atrocity.
We infer that what was lacking was
some big, strong man who would take
the full responsibility.
The suggestion of the management
that the audience refrain from cheering

is unnecessary. The picture does not
inspire that sort of thing. S. O'D.
Abraham Lincoln —Stanford.
When you see Abraham Lincoln, and
we hope you will, go in the right frame
of mind. By this we mean prepare
yourself for recreation rather than en
tertainment. The picture, we are
pleased to say, is not an attempt to
amuse the great American Public. On
the contrary it is a good and sincere
effort to portray the life of Abraham
Lincoln. After some of the historical
distortions which have lately flooded
the motion picture market, this sort of
thing is a welcome change.
The producers have made no effort
to weave into the play any artificial
plot; instead they have relied alto
gether upon the dramatic element of
fered by the simple and unadorned
story of Lincoln's life. The only draw
back to this plan is a slight "draggi
ness" in the early parts. Ample recom
pense is made for this, however, in
the tense and real drama which
marked the closing stages in the
career of the martyr president.
Only one criticism might be made.
The story lacks unity. It appears to
be more a series of incidents than a
continuous narrative.
Oh yes, one thing more. We wish,
most sincerely, that we had been
spared the touching battle scene in
which father and son meet as enemies.
We have witnessed some dozen or
more American Civil Wars (on the
screen) and because of just such
scenes as this, we carry with us the
impression that the conflict was made
up of a number of family disagree
ments in which fathers and sons made
a special point never to get on the
same side.
