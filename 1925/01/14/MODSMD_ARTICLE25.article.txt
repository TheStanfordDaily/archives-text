### 
Following the end of the college
year in June, Dr. Solon Shedd, '96,
head of the Geology department of
the State College of Washington, will
come to Stanford to take charge of the
Branner Memorial Geological Library.
Dr. Shedd received both his Master's
and Doctor's degrees here after gradu
ating at Monmouth, Oregon. He took
charge of the Geological department
at the Washington State College and
during the thirty years that he served
there he built up that department until
it is now one of the strongest ones in
the college.
He published a report on the iron
ores of the state of Washington, an
other on building stones, a third on
clays, and still another on cement ma
terials. In 1921 the state legislature
requested that the survey of iron ores,
fluxes and fuels be brought up to date.
Dr. Shedd was selected to make the
report on fluxes and fuels. This fall he
issued a new bulletin on the mineral
resources of the state of Washington.
Besides these writings he is the author
of the special section on the geography
of the state of Washington included in
all American Book Company geogra
phies used in Washington.
The Stanford Alumni Association is
now raising an endowment fund of
$100,000 for the Branner library.
Dr. Shedd received his Ph.D. here
in 1910, and taught at the University
during the summer and fall of 1921,
and in the summer of 1922.
