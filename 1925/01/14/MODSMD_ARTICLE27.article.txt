# Playing Hours on Tennis Courts Limited by Classes
## 
### 
Bccause of the large enrollment in the
tennis classes for men it is necessary to
have the courts free for the use of the
regular classes, and men merely playing
for pleasure are asked to confine their
playing on the Encina courts to the fol
lowing hours: Monday, Wednesday, and
Friday, 8 to 10; Tuesday and Thursday,
8 to 12; Tuesday, Wednesday and Thurs
day, 1 to 2, and Tuesday
4 to 5; Sunday, all day.
There is no objection to having the
courts used during the above stated hours
but the use of the courts will be con
fined to class woek at other times.
