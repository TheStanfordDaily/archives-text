# GAME WITH IRELAND TEAM PUT OFF UNTIL FRIDAY AFTERNOON
## 
### 
i Due to lack of co-operation on the
part of the weather bureau the game
| scheduled between the varsity base
ball team and Cliff Ireland's Indepen
i dents has been postponed until Friday
j afternoon.
This stroke of fortune or misfortune
will give the varsity an additional day
| to get in trim to withstand the tongue*
i lashing of the witty Irishman. The con
| stant flow of abuse that comes from
j the vicinity of the first base coaching
I box is enough to try the patience of
the most hardened baseball players.
However, Ireland's "bark is worse
than his bite," and the Stanford team
has never failed to give him a run for
his money. ,
