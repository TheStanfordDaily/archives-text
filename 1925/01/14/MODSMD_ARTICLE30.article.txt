# STANDARD IN FOREIGN COLLEGES DISCUSSED BY EX-STANFORD MAN
## 
### 
J. P. Weller, of the Modern Lan
guages department of the University
of Texas, and former Stanford student,
recently gave his impressions of Eu
ropean universities after having been
at the University of Brussels, Belgium.
"Standards of European universities
differ from those of the colleges in
this country in many respects," he
said. "Admission requirements for the
foreign universisits amount to two
years' work in American schools. The
study of Latin and Greek is strongly
emphasized, and degree requirements
all specify courses in these subjects.
"No examinations are given in the
University of Brussels pntil the end of
the school year, which comes in
August. These examinations are oral
instead of written and cover an entire
year's work in three questions, two
of a general, and one of specific nature.
"Athletics are not a part of the school
life in Brussels, and due to the crowded
conditions, the student's life is that
of the city. Students find recreation in
the cafes, theatres, and dance halls of
the boulevards. Dancing is the most
popular diversion, and is a nightly
amusement for the students."
