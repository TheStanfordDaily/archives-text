# COACH DAVIS CUTS 130-POUND SQUAD TO FIFTEEN MEN
## 
### 
With the squad cut to fifteen men,
the 1150-pound basketball team is work
ing hard for the opening game with
the Palo Alto lightweights Friday
night in the pavilion. Like the 145-
poudd squad the 130's have been prac
ticing five nights a week and, although
it is early to predict much, the quintet
is bound to develop under the teach
ing of Coach Hal Davis into a fast,
scrappy team.
The men who remain on the squad
are Geery, Meyers, Ilobro, Gandy,
Morison, Lee, Suffern, Mirron, Sano,
Spradling, Jensen, Bushnell, Fritts,
Brockaway, Hall.
Four games have been scheduled
before the California games and one
open date remains to be filled. The
schedule to date is as follows:
January 17, Palo Alto high school;
January 21, San Jose Y. M. C. A.; Feb
ruary 6, San Jose high school light
weights; February 11, Sequoia high
school lightweights. The dates for the
California series have not yet been set.
