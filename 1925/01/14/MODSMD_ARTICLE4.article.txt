# ZETA PSI INTRAMURAL FIVE NOSES OUT PIRATES 7-6
## Big Scores Feature Other Games on Second Day Of Competition 
### 
Zeta Psi and the Pirates supplied all
the fireworks on yesterday's intramural
basketball program, the Zetas managing
to nose out a 7 to 6 win in the last min
ute of play. All the other contests were
ragged, loosely played affairs ending in
big, lopsided scores.
The score book furnishes the follow
ing statistics: Sequoia Seconds 25, Chi
nese Club 2; Chi Psi 35, Encina 2W 2;
Encina IE 20, Delta Chi 5; Phi Kappa
Psi 28, Sigma Nu 10; Panthers 28, Los
Arcos 3.
Joe Achesoh's Pirates, a team of in
dependents, gave Zeta Psi a real run for
its money, even though they were slow
in getting started. Both quintets pre
sented a tight defense and kept scoring
down to a minimum.
Things looked all to the good for the
Zetas in the first half when Findlay
chalked up a free throw and Roberts and
Sproul tossed in a basket apiece for a
total of 5 points, the Pirates failing to
tally. In the second period the inde
pendents started to cash in on the near
scores they had been making previously.
Sequoia Runs Wild
Hertz's long shot sent them into a 6 to 5
lead, but Roberts cinched the game for
Zeta Psi with a neat field goal about 30
seconds before the final whistle. Miron
was the star of the Pirates' flashy at
tack, while Roberts, Post, and Sproul
were deciding factors in the Zetas' vic
tory.
Proving themselves much stronger
than the Firsts of their dormitory, the
Sequoia Seconds had an easy time with
the Chinese Club and came near achiev
ing a shutout, the final score being 25
to 2. Irwin was very nearly the whole
show with 16 points, but Senior ren
dered able assistance.
The Chinese were so greatly out
weighed and outreached by the hall
players that they were unable to do any
effective guarding and could not hold
on to the ball for any length of time.
Kwan scored their only basket. Sequoia
led 12 to 2 at the half.
Chi Psi doled out a similar dose to
the Encina 1W five, only worse and
more of it, establishing a high scoring
record for the intramural scries with 35
points to Encina's 2. The freshmen
could do nothing to stem the avalanche
of baskets which kept pouring in from
every man on the fraternity team.
Menzies and K. Walker led iii the
carnage. Read saved Encina from a
shutout by looping a field goal late in
the second quarter. The half-way mark
found the Chi Psi's holding a 21 to 0
advantage.
Encina's IE five avenged the defeat of
the 1W players by trouncing Delta Chi
20 to 5. The freshmen showed occa
sional flashes of good teamwork, and
Rowles' guarding was the only factor
which saved Delta Chi from a more
disastrous reverse. Dobson, Cook, and
Carlsmith showed best for Encina. Six
to 2 was the babe's margin at half time.
Phi Psi's Two Horsemen
With "Dutch" McCallister and Wally
Knox assuming the roles of the Two
Horsemen, Phi Kappa Psi's shock troops
rode roughshod over Sigma Nu and
pounded out a 28 to 10 triumph. Though
adept at prancing around the floor and
at passing, the Horsemen shied at the
basket and registered about one out of
ten attempts.
And at that they chalked up goals
pretty regularly, so that the Sig Nu's
trailed 12 to 2 at the half. The losers
threw the ball around rather wildly, but
improved somewhat towards the end of
the game. Bragg and Todd tossed in a
few neat ones for Sigma Nu.
Panthers Look Good
Kellogg's Panthers showed the way to
Los Arcos to the extent of a 28 to 3 win
in the final contest. Kellogg hogged
the honors with almost uncanny shoot
ing ability which enabled him to roll up
15 points. Every man on the indepen
dent team was good, and the outfit gave
promise of being a stronger contender
for the title in League 4. A 19 to 1
lead had been piled up for the Panthers
at the end of the half.
