# ZETA PSI INTRAMURAL FIVE NOSES OUT PIRATES 7-6
## Big Scores Feature Other Games on Second Day Of Competition 
### 
Zeta Psi and the Pirates supplied all
the fireworks on yesterday's intramural
basketball program, the Zetas managing
to nose out a 7 to 6 win in the last min
ute of play. All the other contests were
ragged, loosely played affairs ending in
big, lopsided scores.
The score book furnishes the follow

Encina IE 20, Delta Chi 5; Phi Kappa
Psi 28, Sigma Nu 10; Panthers 28, Los
Arcos 3.
Joe Achesoh's Pirates, a team of in

Things looked all to the good for the
Zetas in the first half when Findlay
chalked up a free throw and Roberts and
Sproul tossed in a basket apiece for a
total of 5 points, the Pirates failing to
tally. In the second period the inde
pendents started to cash in on the near
scores they had been making previously.

was the star of the Pirates' flashy at
tack, while Roberts, Post, and Sproul
were deciding factors in the Zetas' vic
tory.
Proving themselves much stronger
than the Firsts of their dormitory, the
Sequoia Seconds had an easy time with
the Chinese Club and came near achiev
ing a shutout, the final score being 25
to 2. Irwin was very nearly the whole
show with 16 points, but Senior ren
dered able assistance.
The Chinese were so greatly out
weighed and outreached by the hall
players that they were unable to do any
effective guarding and could not hold
on to the ball for any length of time.
Kwan scored their only basket. Sequoia
led 12 to 2 at the half.
Chi Psi doled out a similar dose to
