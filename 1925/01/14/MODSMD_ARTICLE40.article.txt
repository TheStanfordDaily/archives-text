# "Foundations of Religions" Will Be Discussed Tonight
## 
### 
"The Foundation of All Religion Is
One" is the subject which will be dis
cussed tonight at the regular Bahai
meeting at 7:15 in the Women's Club
house. Baliais believe that the present
bitter religious hatreds are due to the
dogma that has crept in quite foreign
to the desires of the first teacher of
religion; that iu reality the esence of
all religions is the same; and that
when people realize this, unity and
harmony will result. The meeting is
open to the public.
