# TEN CARD PLAYERS LEAVE TONIGHT FOR SOUTH
## Stanford Five Will Meet Pomona and Southern Branch Quintets 
### 
Ten members of the Stanford varsity
basketball team will leave tonight for
Southern California to compete against
Pomona and Southern Branch.
The Cardinals will meet Pomona next
Friday night, and play the Cubs on Sat
urday.
The members of the team who are
leaving, besides Coach Andy Kerr and
manager, are: Captain Dave Oliva, Er
nie Nevers, Nelson David, Fred Price,
Harry and Ted Shipkey, Howard Mitch
ell, Jayred, Anderson, and Alexander.
The Cards expect to encounter some
tough opposition in both games, espe
cially against the Pomona sage-hens,
who are reputed to have a good squad.
Southern Branch put up a good fight
against the University of Oregon during
the Christmas holidays, but lost the
game.
This will be the first game that Stan
ford has ever played against either team,
and it marks a new era in establishment
of closer and less â€¢ discriminate athletic
relations between northern and southern
institutions.
Kerr has probably struck the right com
bination in players, with the possible ex
ception of the center position, which
outwardly seems to need remedying, but
which actually may be capably filled.
As soon as Nevers is in shape to take
a regular post, the varsity should have
less and less trouble against stronger
competition. a,
