# "ONLY DECADE LEFT TO MAKE PEACE" SAYS SPEAKER
## Characterizes World League As Panacea for Ills; Advises Entrance 
### Beatrice Flesher 
"We have one decade in which to
make peace." This is the opinion Sher
wood Eddy, Y. M. C. A. worker, who
traveled around the world extensively
since the world war, gave this morn
ing in an address on "The Challenge
of the Present World Situation," be
fore a University assembly.
"By that time," he said, "Europe
will have recovered, there will be a
fresh batch of young men, and old
questions will be brought up for a
rehearing.
"Then," he said, "it will be a ques
tion of whether the decision will be
made by force, or will be a trial
by jury, whether it will be decided by
a world war, or the league of nations."
Eddy characterized the League as a
panacea for the three great evils in
Europe today. These, he asserted, are
the growth of intense, bigotted inter
nationalism, intense imperialism, and
United States Partly in League
Concerning the entrance of the
United States in the League of Na
tions, he said, "We are getting into
the League section by section through
the back door, and I believe we will
get in the front way within a decade."
Telling further of the situation in
the United States, Eddy enumerated
the following: "We are leading the
world in wealth, trade, commerce,
manufacturing, and trade.
"It is painful, however, to report
that we are also leading the world in
color and race prejudice."
Ilustrating the fact of the racial
prejudice in the United States, Eddy
recited the story conencted with the
passing of the recent exclusion bill.
Me said this destroyed the good effect
produced in Japan by the Washington
Conference and by the aid the United
States offered Japan on the occasion
of the great earthquake. "Now," he
said, "Japan has been driven back to
Rusia and China for her alliances.
Eddy also said that the Japanese
net*d their people in their own coun
try and that, had there been a friendly
conference and discussion between the
United States and Japan, relations
would have remained in the friendly
state in which they were,
Concerning the question of nation
alism, Eddy said, "Nationalism is
shown in the British Empire, where
country after country demands either
independence, self-government, or self
determination. There is intense na
tionalism in the minority party in
France, and is especially prevalent in
the small countries re-made after the
war.
Eddy said of the intense imperialism
which is endangering Europe, "If
patriotism is love of one's country, im
perialism is love of another's country.
Since 1800, Great Britain has multi- s
plied her area nine fold, and her popu
lation twenty-three fold.
"At least ten states in Europe," he
said, "have the memories of past em
pires, and hopes they had had for the
future." He said that France remem
bered the days of Napoleon's glory,
Greece, the days of Alexander, etc. j
Eddy commended the religious tolera
tion, he explained was for those who
are not in politics. Eddy said there is
greater attenflanee of churches now
than there was ever before in Russia.

since the world war, gave this morn
ing in an address on "The Challenge
of the Present World Situation," be
fore a University assembly.
"By that time," he said, "Europe
will have recovered, there will be a
fresh batch of young men, and old
questions will be brought up for a
rehearing.
"Then," he said, "it will be a ques
tion of whether the decision will be
made by force, or will be a trial
by jury, whether it will be decided by
a world war, or the league of nations."
Eddy characterized the League as a
panacea for the three great evils in
Europe today. These, he asserted, are
the growth of intense, bigotted inter
nationalism, intense imperialism, and
United States Partly in League
Concerning the entrance of the
United States in the League of Na
tions, he said, "We are getting into
the League section by section through
the back door, and I believe we will
get in the front way within a decade."
Telling further of the situation in
the United States, Eddy enumerated
the following: "We are leading the
world in wealth, trade, commerce,
manufacturing, and trade.
"It is painful, however, to report
that we are also leading the world in
color and race prejudice."
Ilustrating the fact of the racial
prejudice in the United States, Eddy
recited the story conencted with the
passing of the recent exclusion bill.
Me said this destroyed the good effect
produced in Japan by the Washington
Conference and by the aid the United
States offered Japan on the occasion
of the great earthquake. "Now," he
said, "Japan has been driven back to
Rusia and China for her alliances.
Eddy also said that the Japanese
net*d their people in their own coun
try and that, had there been a friendly
conference and discussion between the
United States and Japan, relations
would have remained in the friendly
state in which they were,
Concerning the question of nation
alism, Eddy said, "Nationalism is
shown in the British Empire, where
country after country demands either
independence, self-government, or self
determination. There is intense na
tionalism in the minority party in
France, and is especially prevalent in
the small countries re-made after the
war.
Eddy said of the intense imperialism
which is endangering Europe, "If
patriotism is love of one's country, im
perialism is love of another's country.
Since 1800, Great Britain has multi- s
plied her area nine fold, and her popu
lation twenty-three fold.
"At least ten states in Europe," he
said, "have the memories of past em
pires, and hopes they had had for the
future." He said that France remem
bered the days of Napoleon's glory,
Greece, the days of Alexander, etc. j
Eddy commended the religious tolera
tion, he explained was for those who
are not in politics. Eddy said there is
greater attenflanee of churches now
than there was ever before in Russia.
"We have one decade in which to
make peace." This is the opinion Sher
wood Eddy, Y. M. C. A. worker, who
traveled around the world extensively
since the world war, gave this morn
ing in an address on "The Challenge
of the Present World Situation," be
