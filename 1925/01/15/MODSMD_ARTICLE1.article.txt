# IRELAND'S MEN OPPOSE VARSITY NINE TOMORROW
## Strong Array of Stars Will Play Stanford Team on Cardinal Diamond 
### John Levi 
Cliff Ireland's Independents will op
pose the varsity baseball team on the
Stanford diamond at 2:30 tomorrow
afternoon providing the contest is not
postponed again because of unfavor
able weather conditions. The game
was originally scheduled for yesterday,
but the muddy condition of the field
made playing impossible.
The postponement did not materially
benefit the varsity, for no practice was
held yesterday. However, it is prob
able that practice can be held today.
Ireland's team this year is prob
ably the most formidable group of Big
League and Coast League players that
lie has ever brought to the Farm. As
he has been coming here for the past
thirty-three years this is a rather
broad statement.
The strongest part of his team will
be his pitching staff which includes
such men as Ludolf, Ren Kelley, Puc
cinello, Reppy, Cole, Manouk, and De
Mayer. The backstop for these men
will be either Ritchie or Anfinson,
both of whom are well known in the
Big Leagues.
The infield will be composed of Bert
Ellison of the Seals at first, Stew
Clark at short, Montague at third, and
the incomparable Cliff Ireland himself
at second. When it is necessary for
â– "pep" to be provided from the sideline,
Cliff usually resignes in favor of Tan
ner, and devotes his attention to the
tongue-lashing department.
Wolter has only two vacancies to
fill from his last year's nine, and judg
ing from the wealth of material that
has showed up for practice it is un
likely that he will have much difficulty
in filling them.
Neither "Chuck" Johnston nor Jim
Lawson are at the present time prac
ticing with the squad so King will no
doubt be catching.
Franz Osthaus of the '27 freshman
team and Dick Keyes, a transfer from
Fresno State College, are having a
close battle to fill the position of first
base, which was left vacant by the
graduation of "Bud" Woodward. In the
outfield Jerry Stewart and Howard
Sheets have been alternating for Frank
Fuller's old place. Brown is also a
prospect.
"Shorty" Roberts is back at second,
Mulchay at short, Cuddeback at third,
"Bus" McCandless at center, and
"Lefty" May at left field. Both May
and McCandless have retained their
eagle batting eye, despite the long lay
off, and should prove a menace even
to the array of pitchers that will ac
company Ireland.
With the exception of Nevers, who
is at the present time in the South
with the basketball team, and A1
Lowenstein, who was lost by gradua

tion, the varsity will have the same
pitching staff as last year. Aydelott,
Oviatt, and Teague, varsity players
from last year, and Collins, Hunter,
and Osthaus, from the '27 squad, have
been working out regularly and it is
difficult to tell just which one will be
called upon to open the game. -
The varsity-faculty game which was
played last Friday was no indication
of the strength of the team. Numerous
substitutions made it impossible for
any one group to work together
smoothly and several of the first
string men were warming the bench
throughout the greater part of the
contest.
The second game of the three-game
series with the Ireland aggregation
will be played on the varsity diamond
at 2:30 Saturday afternoon.
