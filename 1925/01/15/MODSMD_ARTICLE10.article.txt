# Quad Dance Saturday to Be Featured by Balloon And Lucky Spot Dances
## 
### 
If you are lucky, you may win the
prize at the 1926 Quad dance Saturday
night in the Women's Clubhouse. Num
bered spots will be hung from the ceil
ing. When the music stops, a number
will be drawn from a hat, and the lady
under the spot with the lucky number
gets the prize.
Spot-light dances will be another
feature of the evening. Other illumina
tion will be turned off, and two colored
lights on the stage will play over the
dancers.
Add to this a balloon dance, and
the Hess-Young orchestra to broad
cast the harmony, and you will have
an evening of â€”well, the Quad invites
you to come and see for yourself.
