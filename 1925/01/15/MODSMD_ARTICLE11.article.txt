## 
### Al Post 
Delta Tau Delta virtually forfeited
! its chance to cop the intramural hoop
| title for the second straight season
when it lost yesterday to the Encina
3E quintet by a 7 to 3 score. If the
Delts win all their remaining games
and other contenders lose they will re
main in the running, but their show
ing yesterday was anything but prom
ising.
Results for the other games follow:
El Toro 14, Encina 4W 9; Theta Chi
17, Phi Sigma Kappa 15; Kappa Sigma
32, Kappa Alpha 0; Phi Kappa Sigma
j 17, Encina 4E 4.
The work of Stewart diminutive
I freshman center, was the outstanding
! feautre of the Encina 30-Delta Tau
j Delta melee. He ran like a flash and
! shot baskets with accuracy, looping in
: goals occasionally from the center of
: the floor. All the Encina points were
scored by Stewart in the second half.
Both sides occupied themselves dur
ing the first period with taking wild,
! poorly-aimed tries at the basket, none
of which were successful. Stewart of
' the Delts managed to connect for one
foul goal, making the count 1 to.O at
the half. Although . they had two
veterans in their line-up the Delta
I Taus gave a sorry imitation of their
championship work of last season.
They passed poorly and failed to hold
onto the ball when they had it in their
jpossession.
El Toro Trims Encina 4W
El Toro bowled over Encina 4W 14
to 9 without much trouble. Fred
Ludeke and Rupe were the main cogs
in the club's offense, the lanky track
man rolling up 8 tallies. After trailing
in the first half 10 to 3, the freshmen
i snapped out of it in the second period.
Garibaldi of Encina sunk two neat bas
kets in rapid succession.
Gray also performed well for the
yearlings, but the rest of the team was
I not sure enough of its shots to over-
I come the lead of El Toro. Encina
! players made good only one try for
goal on a free throw during the entire
I game.
Theta Chi and Phi Sigma Kappa
staged a see-saw contest which was
not decided until the last thirty sec
onds of the game, Theta Chi finally
winning out 17 to 15. Both contestants
i scored freely and exchanged the lead
with nearly every shot. Miller, Phi
Sigma Kappa, did spectacular work,
accounting for 9 points mainly on long
shots which seemed to be easier for
him than the shorter tries.
Green, Dice, and Schultzberg showed
best for Theta Chi." Dice's basket en
abled his squad to lead 9 to 7 at the
half. The Phi Sigs forged ahead in the
second period but could not hold the
advantage for long. Green's field goals
put Theta Chi out in front at the end.
Kappa Sigs Whitewash K. A.'s
The first shutout of the intramural
series was inflicted on the Kappa
Alpha five, with burly Kappa Sigma
athletes applying the whitewash brush
fo the extent of 32 points, 10i of which
were accounted for by Tex Middleton.
Total lack of any of the elements of
defense caused the downfall of the
K. A.'s.
Phi Kappa Sigma disposed of Encina
IE almost as easily by a 17 to 4 mar
gin, all of the Phi Kaps taking a hand
in the carnage. The freshmen tried
hard enough, but lost possession of
the ball at the crucial moment, and
registered only a small proportion of
goals out of the shots attempted. The
score stood 9 to 0 at the half way
point.

scored by Stewart in the second half.
Both sides occupied themselves dur

El Toro Trims Encina 4W
El Toro bowled over Encina 4W 14
to 9 without much trouble. Fred
Ludeke and Rupe were the main cogs
in the club's offense, the lanky track
man rolling up 8 tallies. After trailing
in the first half 10 to 3, the freshmen
i snapped out of it in the second period.
Garibaldi of Encina sunk two neat bas
kets in rapid succession.
Gray also performed well for the
yearlings, but the rest of the team was
I not sure enough of its shots to over-
I come the lead of El Toro. Encina
! players made good only one try for
goal on a free throw during the entire
I game.
Theta Chi and Phi Sigma Kappa
staged a see-saw contest which was
not decided until the last thirty sec
onds of the game, Theta Chi finally
winning out 17 to 15. Both contestants
i scored freely and exchanged the lead
with nearly every shot. Miller, Phi
Sigma Kappa, did spectacular work,
accounting for 9 points mainly on long
shots which seemed to be easier for
him than the shorter tries.
Green, Dice, and Schultzberg showed
best for Theta Chi." Dice's basket en
abled his squad to lead 9 to 7 at the
half. The Phi Sigs forged ahead in the
second period but could not hold the
advantage for long. Green's field goals
put Theta Chi out in front at the end.
Kappa Sigs Whitewash K. A.'s
The first shutout of the intramural
series was inflicted on the Kappa
Alpha five, with burly Kappa Sigma
athletes applying the whitewash brush
fo the extent of 32 points, 10i of which
were accounted for by Tex Middleton.
Total lack of any of the elements of
defense caused the downfall of the
K. A.'s.
Phi Kappa Sigma disposed of Encina
IE almost as easily by a 17 to 4 mar
gin, all of the Phi Kaps taking a hand
in the carnage. The freshmen tried
hard enough, but lost possession of
the ball at the crucial moment, and
registered only a small proportion of
goals out of the shots attempted. The
score stood 9 to 0 at the half way
