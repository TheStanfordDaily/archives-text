The work of Stewart diminutive
I freshman center, was the outstanding
! feautre of the Encina 30-Delta Tau
j Delta melee. He ran like a flash and
! shot baskets with accuracy, looping in
: goals occasionally from the center of
: the floor. All the Encina points were
scored by Stewart in the second half.
Both sides occupied themselves dur
ing the first period with taking wild,
! poorly-aimed tries at the basket, none
of which were successful. Stewart of
' the Delts managed to connect for one
foul goal, making the count 1 to.O at
the half. Although . they had two
veterans in their line-up the Delta
I Taus gave a sorry imitation of their
championship work of last season.
They passed poorly and failed to hold
onto the ball when they had it in their
jpossession.
El Toro Trims Encina 4W
El Toro bowled over Encina 4W 14
to 9 without much trouble. Fred
Ludeke and Rupe were the main cogs
in the club's offense, the lanky track
man rolling up 8 tallies. After trailing
in the first half 10 to 3, the freshmen
i snapped out of it in the second period.
Garibaldi of Encina sunk two neat bas
kets in rapid succession.
Gray also performed well for the
yearlings, but the rest of the team was
I not sure enough of its shots to over-
I come the lead of El Toro. Encina
! players made good only one try for
goal on a free throw during the entire
I game.
Theta Chi and Phi Sigma Kappa
staged a see-saw contest which was
not decided until the last thirty sec
onds of the game, Theta Chi finally
winning out 17 to 15. Both contestants
i scored freely and exchanged the lead
