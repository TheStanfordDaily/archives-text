# Requests for Dates Makes Work for "Hello" Girls
## 
### Douglas Meservey 
Last night John Rough cast aside
1 his old clothes and telephoned Susie
for a "date" for this week-end. Like
wise, many other John Roughs called
other Susies for a similar reason.
And thereby hangs a tale; because
; of these many requests over the tele
hone, Palo Alto's "hello" girls were
put to much added work. At least, that
is one item learned from a trip through
the Pacific Telephone & Telegraph's
exchange in Palo Alto, through the
| courtesy of H. D. Worthington, gen
eral manager.
Inspection Offered
Worthington, several weeks ago, ex
tended an invitation to all students
and citizens of Palo Alto to visit the
exchange, and since that time hun
dreds have enjoyed an examination
of the inner-workings of a telephone
office, or exchange, as it is called.
Of course the information as to John
Rough's activities on Wednesday eve
ning was not given by a telephone
operator. E. T. Becker, the guide, ex
plained that operators have found their
work increased on Wednesday nights
'tecause of the added use of the phone
j by Stanford students. Operators have

no chance to "listen in" on conversa
tions but the repetition of the added
"load" Wednesday nights has given
them the above deductions.
University Calls Oakland
In the same way too, it has been
found that most of the Oakland calls
through the exchange are made by
University men in search of "dates."
As for the frequency with which long
distance calls are made from the cam
pus, it was explained that during vaca
tions, when there are no sessions, the
daily average for toll calls drops fcom
1000 to 700, or nearly one-tjiird.
Becker makes a detailed explana
tion of the workings of a phone call —
too detailed to put on paper but never
theless interesting. Pointing out the
system of lights which shows the oper
ator when a receiver is taken off the
hook, he shows how she "plugs in,"
takes the number, calls it, and hurries
to answer another light.
"Haste Makes Waste"
And how the girls' bands fly! No
one who has seen them work will
again impatiently jiggle the receiver
on the hook for it not only aggravates
the operator but sometimes causes her
