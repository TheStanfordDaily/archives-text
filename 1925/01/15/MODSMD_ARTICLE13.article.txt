# POMONA FIVE MAY GIVE CARDS STIFFEST BATTLE OF SEASON
## Stanford Team Should Profit From Stiff Competition Offered By Claremont Quintet 
### 
►> Stanford encounters its toughest op
! position of the season when the Card
j varsity tangles with the Pomona court
I squad at Claremont tomorrow night.
Despite the handicap of being a
' smaller college the Sagehens, neverthe
less, have a presentable basketball
team. Four letter men from last season
are back in the gold and, in this re
spect, they have an advantage over
the Cards, with two letter men and an
over-abundance of green material.
This is the first time a Stanford
team has played a Pomona squad, and
there is 110 way of (Comparing the two
teams by means of past performances.
This season will be lacking in the
exciting interest always aroused by
the U. S. C. series in Los Angeles and,
until the California schedule is
reached, there is bound to be more or
less of a lapse in that interest.
Stanford has not a strong team this
year. Compare it with the squad of
last season, which trampled its way
through the preliminary season with
out a defeat and which managed to
edge out victorious over the University
of Southern California quintet. But the
work of the squad last season was
purely individual. Without "Nip" Mc-
Hose there would have been fewer
overwhelming scores.
By means of pure teamwork Kerr
may be able to put out a team which
is just as strong. But. it will take
time; it might be that, even by the
time the California series approach,
the team will not have been whipped
into proper shape.
There are also good individual pros
pects on the teams. Nelson David is
not at all hard to watch on the floor,
and Ernie Nevers, providing he re
gains his old form, will most certainly
do some outstanding work before the
season is finished. It depends a lot on
the varsity showing in these next two
games i ntlie South how much strength
the Cards may be expected to show.
