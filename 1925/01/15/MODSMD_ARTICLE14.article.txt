# Fame of 'You and I' Will Be Spread By Cross Word Puzzle
## 
### 
Determined not to be outdone by
' the Old Boy the Dramatic Council is
starting a cross-word puzzle bee of its
! own. The puzzle will appear in Mon
; day's Daily and, according to Delmer
Daves, dramatic manager, it is no
j-"cinch."
The first intellectual who success-
I
| fully and correctly fills the blank
1 spaces creating such words as "a foot
| warmer commonly used by a tribe of
j the South Sea Islands," will receive
six tickets for the coming production
of "You and I." These tickets will not
be behind a post unless the winner so
chooses, because the choice of seats
will be left entirely to the discretion
of the brilliant one.
Daves furthermore states that the
key to the mystery is safely locked in
a safe deposit vault in a Palo Alto
bank over which a special guard of the
state militia has been placed, and
neither fraternal ties nor bonds of
friendship will cause him to divulge
the secret of even one perplexing
word.
