# Y. M. C. A. SPEAKER DEPLORES COLLEGE MORALS IN ADDRESS
## 
### 
"Am I honest? Have I a great moral
purpose? Am I dead, in earnest? asked
Sherwood Eddy, noted Y. M. C. A.
speaker in his talk on college problems
last night in the Assembly Hall. He has
talked on these problems to college stu
dents the world over, and has a broad
knowledge of the temptations which be
set university students.
"Fraternities are being questioned on
many campuses today," he said, and added
that he thought that this particular prob
lem was not as bad here as in other uni
versities. The fraternity, according to
Eddy tends to cast the individual in the
mold of his fellows. If the greater num
ber of men are of the right type, the
tendency will be to improve the individual.
In many cases, the speaker claimed, this
is not the case, and a man is injured
morally by his contact with other men in
his fraternity.
Throughout the evening Eddy stressed
the importance of religion in college life.
"Not a superficial creed, or dogma, but a
vital religious faith."
The speaker also attacked drinking
among college men. "Is the constitution
a joke?" he asked. "If the educated
group arc allowed to violate it at will
why cannot twenty millions of labor vio
late it as they will ?" f
Gambling Prevalent.
Gambling was another practice which
Eddy deplored. He said that he was not
an extremist' and did not oppose games
for small stakes for the direct harm
they might do, but because of the 'get
rich quick' mental attitude which they
produced. "I have never known a man in
college who was a habitual gambler, who
was a great moral leader on his campus,
he declared.
Profanity, in Eddy's opinion, is a silly
and degrading vice, and its wide preval
ence among collcgc students is a thing
which he believes unnecessary.
Following his address, Eddy answered
questions which were asked him by per
sons in the audience. This discussion,
which took the form of an open forum,
will be continued at 4:30 this afternoon
in the Little Theater.
