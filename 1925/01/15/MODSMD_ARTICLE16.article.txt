# STATE HEADLIGHT ENFORCEMENT DRIVE NOW IN PROGRESS
## 
### 
Traffic officers working under the
direction of the Division of Motor Ve
hicles and co-operating with police
authqrities in most of the larger cities
and towns are conducting a state-wide
headlight enforcement campaign, the
California State Automobile Associa
tion anounced today.
Headlight raids are being carried on
niglitly in various sections of the state
and officers are checking up on the
equipment of parked cars during the
daytime. Where it is found that a
motor vehicle is not equipped with
headlight devices approved by the
Division of Motor Vehicles under the
requirements of the California Vehicle
act, or where legal equipment is found
to be improperly focused and adjusted,
citations are being issued.
For the convenience of the motoring
public, the State Automobile Associa
tion has supplied all its 23 offices in
Northern and Central California with
lists of approved devices. These lists
may be consulted by any motorist.
Motorists who have knotty problems
to solve in conection with the renewal
registration of their cars can receive
personal service and advice from any
of the 22 offices of the California State
Automobile Association, which will
begin issuing plates to Association
members on February 2, it was an
nounced today.
With registration requirements more
complicated than usual, many motor
ists do not seem to know how to pro
ceed in securing their 1025 license
plates, according to George S. Grant,
manager of the Automobile Associa
tion's touring bureau. Grant said that
additional clerical help in the Associa
tion's offices would handle re-registra
i.ion requirements with the greatest
possible dispatch, thereby eliminating
possible delay and troublesome corres
pondence.
Where both the certificate of regis
tration and the certificate of owner
ship are presented to the Association
in good condition, motorists can secure
immediate delivery of plates. Where
motorists who are not the legal owners
of their cars find that they are unable
to bring in the pink certificate of
ownership, (he Automobile Association
will handle their registration require
ments by issuing them a receipt which
will enable them to operate their cars
until plates are forwarded them by
mail from S-icramonto.
The fact that Stanford and Califor
nia are holding out open dates leads
many to conclude definitely that these
days are being reserved for games
with the University of Southern Cali
fornia. Therefore a reconciliation is
being planned. Q. E. D.
Official statements are lacking, how
ever, and will be lacking until some
thing tangible is decided.

Traffic officers working under the
direction of the Division of Motor Ve
hicles and co-operating with police
authqrities in most of the larger cities
and towns are conducting a state-wide
headlight enforcement campaign, the
California State Automobile Associa
tion anounced today.
Headlight raids are being carried on
niglitly in various sections of the state
and officers are checking up on the
equipment of parked cars during the
daytime. Where it is found that a
motor vehicle is not equipped with
headlight devices approved by the
Division of Motor Vehicles under the
requirements of the California Vehicle
act, or where legal equipment is found
to be improperly focused and adjusted,
citations are being issued.
For the convenience of the motoring
public, the State Automobile Associa
tion has supplied all its 23 offices in
Northern and Central California with
lists of approved devices. These lists
may be consulted by any motorist.
Motorists who have knotty problems
to solve in conection with the renewal
registration of their cars can receive
personal service and advice from any
of the 22 offices of the California State
Automobile Association, which will
begin issuing plates to Association
members on February 2, it was an
nounced today.
With registration requirements more
complicated than usual, many motor
ists do not seem to know how to pro
ceed in securing their 1025 license
plates, according to George S. Grant,
manager of the Automobile Associa
tion's touring bureau. Grant said that
additional clerical help in the Associa
tion's offices would handle re-registra
i.ion requirements with the greatest
possible dispatch, thereby eliminating
possible delay and troublesome corres
pondence.
Where both the certificate of regis
tration and the certificate of owner
ship are presented to the Association
in good condition, motorists can secure
immediate delivery of plates. Where
motorists who are not the legal owners
of their cars find that they are unable
to bring in the pink certificate of
ownership, (he Automobile Association
will handle their registration require
ments by issuing them a receipt which
will enable them to operate their cars
until plates are forwarded them by
mail from S-icramonto.
The fact that Stanford and Califor
nia are holding out open dates leads
many to conclude definitely that these
days are being reserved for games
with the University of Southern Cali
fornia. Therefore a reconciliation is
