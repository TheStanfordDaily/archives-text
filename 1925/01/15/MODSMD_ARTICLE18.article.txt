# The 						Cart Before the Horse

### 
A law student; with a meditative turn of mind is in cerebral anguish..
It has occurred to him that the local educational system is not all that it
should be. On your marks, viewpointers.
This ambitious barrister has attended Stanford's law school for over
two years and is supposed to be in a fair way to know something about
law. Yet, when he set himself the problem of preparing a plea defending
a disputed contract—Contracts being the subject for which he has the
most aptitude—he was forced to admit that he was at a loss. He knows
his note-book and has a good grasp of the subject, but since his hypo
thetical case combines several points of recent development, he is helpless.
It would be necessary to do original work in order to gather the ma
terial and, further, he finds himself ignorant of just how to present such
material should he get it, by any chance. He complains that he would be
unable to use his law. He has not been taught to THINK c&rycctly about
his subject. And his law record is a good one. Why shouldn't the sys
tem be blamed ?
The criticism is not only one for Stanford, but for every other uni
versity. Instruction in professional method is reserved as a parting shot
in almost every school of every university. And for what reason ?
By the time students are allowed to learn how to study their subject,
they have had an enormous quantity of detail drummed into them which
they must either retain by rote memory or by a private system of mental
classification. Of course there is an enormous waste in finally rearrang
ing this correctly, if it is possible at all.
Our scholarly friend protests.
All right, viewpointers. Now it's your turn to explain just what
sense there is in having the cart before the horse. —H. B. R.
