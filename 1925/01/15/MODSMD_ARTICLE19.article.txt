# Well, Why?

The Englishman doesn't approve of you boys (men) and girls
(women). He says that you have come to college to gain distinction
rather than to develop mental excellence. And, if he is correct, why?
And, i f he is correct, why not ?
But is he correct? Why do you come to college?
It is possible that the world shall never know. One thing is obvious
to any one who has listened to us report to friends the marks won from
the professors after each quarter has passed. To "get by" is highly desir
able. Most students are satisfied to remain out of the reach of the
scholarship committee. Any stranger who suspects that American col
leges are not dominated by ambitious scholars is perhaps as right as a
stranger can be.
If he decides that it must be athletics, or some other honored activity,
which is to blame for the condition, he has doubtful sagacity. It is safe
to say that the majority of college students do not engage in activities,
that is, they do not do so whole-heartedly for great distinction.
Why, then, does one come to college? For one thing, it's a respectable
occupation. Besides that, attending Stanford might almost be called
fashionable. College, especially this one, offers congeniality. Attending
college, whatever else may be said about it, is easier than working for a
living. Whatever tedium there is about being a college student is of an
endurable sort and not altogether unpleasant. At any rate alumni seem
to enjoy telling what they know about it.
That sort of thing would certainly influence a lot of people, now
wouldn't it? And, of course it is outrageous. But what can we two do
about it?
If only there were more whose one collegiate concern was scholarly
performance, such as you and —H. B. R.
