# "GUS" HENDERSON WILLING TO STEP OUT AS U. S. C. COACH
## 
### 
"Gloomy" Gus Henderson is willing
to step out and find another job, ac
cording to reports from the South.
Henderson has apparently not resigned
from his lately turbulent position as
coach of the U. S. C. football teams,
but is willing to do so if those in
authority feel it would benefit the
Southern California standing.
On top of the rumor that Henderson
has signified his intentions of resign
ing comes the reports that University
of Southern California officials are
seeking reconciliation with Stanford
and California. Some highly signifi
cant things are going to happen in the
next few days.
Whether or not Henderson has been
the obstruction in the wheels of a
good relationship between the Big
Three of the Pacific coast is highly
problematical. Still there is reason to
believe that the establishment of re
lations would run a smoother course
were Henderson to spread his gloom
elsewhere.
The advent of Knute Rockne on the
Pacific Coast has caused quite a shake
up among several colleges, who in a
mad scramble, are seeking Four Horse
men for football coaches. Eddie Kien
holz, largely through Alumni influence,
has handed in his resignation at Santa
Clara. Adam Walsh, Notre Dame cap
tain and center, has been mentioned
for the position, along with Struhelder.
Knute Rockne, himself, has been
offered a position at U. S. C., it is
understood. Rockne, however, is not
likely to desert his post at Notre Dame
to enter a field and, more particularly,
an institution, where there is hard
feelings. ,
