# THE 						LAW STEPS

How many of the students here, all
of them wanting to "know life," are
succeeding? Nine-tenths of those you
pqps on your way to class are as dy
namic are a dead battery. We have
wondered at times if they are all home
sick —or it may be that the food here
on the campus has that devitalizing
effect.
A person who is all alive, completely
conscious, as it were, is rare. But when
you do meet one —you feel with Kip
ling that —
"Thar's nothing like opin-speakin' . .
Slape is a shuparfluoUs necessity."
#
"But, Oh! It is seldom or never
That things happen just as they
should;
For the good are so harsh to the
clever,
And the clever so rude to the
good!"
The "thoughtful student from the
London School of Economics" wasn't
far wrong in saying that the "tyranny
of categories iB pushed to an extreme"
in American colleges.
From dinks to sombreros the aver
age student struggles to become identi
fied with as many "categories" as he
possibly can. If he doesn't he lacks
"college spirit."
Of course, one may be caught in a
category unknowingly—like the Lu
cille-Irene-Rose one —but there is al
ways the possibility of an awaken
ing. Just a possibility!
By our mistakes we learn! that nice,
red apples aren't always all they seem.
(But they are such a pretty color!)
However, with Robert Ingersoll, we
would say that "only those remain of
the same opinion still who have reach
ed the intellectual autumn of their
lives."
We wish we cauld have asked him
what the hordes-with-no-opinions-at-all
do "when autumn comes" to crystical
ize what is not.
Perhaps they just go up in the blue
smoke that makes "that beautiful
autumn haze!"
In case there are students who are
subjected to four classes five times
a week and-other-things, we submit in
time for memorizing before the end
of the quarter—
"Bury me with clenched hands,
And eyes open wide;
In struggle and storm I lived,
And in storm and struggle I died!"
