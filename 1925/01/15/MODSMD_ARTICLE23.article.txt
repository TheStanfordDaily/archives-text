# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT

### 
The Editor —Sir:
I should like to make a statment of
what I consider to be a rather serious
'■ situation in the freshman class.
At the beginning of the year the
! class met for the election of officers.
Roth at the times of nomination and
1 election of these officers the women
In the class were far better repre
sented in numbers than were the men.
In fact, it is very doubtful whether
the president could have received the
! election without the votes of the
women who cast their ballots, almost
unanimously, for him. The women
have made at least as good a showing
as the men in the payment of class
I dues to the treasury.
In view of the above facts it seems
to me that the women should have
some say in the determination of class
! policy and the transaction of class
business. However, freshman meetings,
so called, have been held at Encina
and class business has been transacted
in meetings which it would be mani
; festly impossible for the women to
attend. According to announcements in
| the Daily a good part of this business
has had to do with the expending of
, class funds.
I am not sure at whose door to lay
the blame for this situation, but I am
inclined to believe that it should go
to the execeutive of the class. Would
it not be possible to hold the meetings
at a time and place convenient to all
of the members of the class? There is
no criticism offered of the management
of class affairs. None of the women
know enough about them to criticize.
Probably everything is being con
ducted efficiently, but is it fair to put
class affairs in the hands of the men,
only? —A Loyal Woman of *28.
The Editor, Sir:
At the first Open Forum discussion on
j campus problems sponsored by the Eu
i phronia Debating Society, the following
resolution was unanimously passed:
"Be it resolved, that this house go on
! record as expressing full confidence in
j the Administration and Board of Athletic
I Control in their securing and maintaining
| of clean athletics at Stanford."
j The Euphronia Society is planning to
arrange open forum discussions on cam
pus problems every two weeks. Due to
conflicts week after next, we have ad
vanced the date of the next forum dis
cussion to Wednesday, January 21, and
1 will probably hold it in the lobby of the
Old Union at 7 :30 p. m. The subject for
discussion will be: "To what extent is
the government regulation of liquor drink
ing violated by the Stanford students?"
We have asked Dean Culver, Professor
Harley F. Lutz of the Economics depart
ment, and John C. Duniway, a member of
the Oxford debate squad, to speak.
Special emphasis will be placed on the
liquor problem on the campus "and we
shall also attempt to estimate the success
of prohibition throughout the United
States.
We should like to explain these open
'forum discussions, although sponsored by
the Euphronia society, are open to all,
men or women, students, faculty mem
bers, or residents of Palo Alto and the
vicinity. We sincerely hope that women
will be present at and participate in these
discussions. A special invitation is also j
extended to members of the faculty and ;
administration.
As pointed out in a previous viewpoint, :
there is a place at Stanford for a great 1
liberal club which will include in its mem- j
bership students of both sexes, faculty
members, and those in the vicinity inter
ested in Stanford. We feel that in these
open forum discussions sponsored by 'Eu
phronia that we are paving the way to a
realization of this ideal.

conflicts week after next, we have ad
vanced the date of the next forum dis
cussion to Wednesday, January 21, and
1 will probably hold it in the lobby of the
Old Union at 7 :30 p. m. The subject for
discussion will be: "To what extent is
the government regulation of liquor drink
ing violated by the Stanford students?"
We have asked Dean Culver, Professor
Harley F. Lutz of the Economics depart
ment, and John C. Duniway, a member of
the Oxford debate squad, to speak.
Special emphasis will be placed on the
liquor problem on the campus "and we
shall also attempt to estimate the success
of prohibition throughout the United
States.
We should like to explain these open
'forum discussions, although sponsored by
the Euphronia society, are open to all,
men or women, students, faculty mem
bers, or residents of Palo Alto and the
vicinity. We sincerely hope that women
will be present at and participate in these
discussions. A special invitation is also j
extended to members of the faculty and ;
administration.
As pointed out in a previous viewpoint, :
there is a place at Stanford for a great 1
liberal club which will include in its mem- j
bership students of both sexes, faculty
members, and those in the vicinity inter
ested in Stanford. We feel that in these
open forum discussions sponsored by 'Eu
phronia that we are paving the way to a
realization of this ideal.
Sincerely yours,
W. L. GOSSLIN,
President, Euphronia Debating Society.
The Editor —Sir:
I should like to make a statment of
what I consider to be a rather serious
'■ situation in the freshman class.
At the beginning of the year the
! class met for the election of officers.
Roth at the times of nomination and
1 election of these officers the women
In the class were far better repre
sented in numbers than were the men.
In fact, it is very doubtful whether
the president could have received the
! election without the votes of the
women who cast their ballots, almost
unanimously, for him. The women
have made at least as good a showing
as the men in the payment of class
I dues to the treasury.
In view of the above facts it seems
to me that the women should have
some say in the determination of class
! policy and the transaction of class
business. However, freshman meetings,
so called, have been held at Encina
and class business has been transacted
in meetings which it would be mani
; festly impossible for the women to
attend. According to announcements in
| the Daily a good part of this business
has had to do with the expending of
, class funds.
I am not sure at whose door to lay
the blame for this situation, but I am
inclined to believe that it should go
to the execeutive of the class. Would
it not be possible to hold the meetings
at a time and place convenient to all
of the members of the class? There is
no criticism offered of the management
of class affairs. None of the women
know enough about them to criticize.
Probably everything is being con
ducted efficiently, but is it fair to put
class affairs in the hands of the men,
only? —A Loyal Woman of *28.
