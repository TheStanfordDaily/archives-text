# Foraminifera Laboratory Carries on New Research
## 
### 
Stanford has the only Foraminifera
laboratory in a western university to
day, and important research is being
carried on here by Mr. Hubert Schenck
of Geology department, who built
the laboratory last winter.
The practical application of this
study of these shelled protozoans fos- j
sils is made In the boring for oil. On
the basis of the combination of For-,
aminifera it is comparatively easy to j
correlate the strata of different oil j
sections and various strata of the
same basin.
A number of the graduates of the |
Geology department have entered this j
lield and me now working in labora
tories of large oil companies. Don [
Hughes, '20, and H. L. Driver, '19, are I
now employed in the Foraminifera:
laboratories of oil concerns in San J
Francisco. Dale Sparks, '22, is now j
working along the same lines in Tam
pico, Mexico, for the Cia Emmex de i
Petroleo.
