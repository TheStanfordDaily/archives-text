# McGoun Impressed With Library Arrangement
## 
### 
"After two weeks at the University
of Alberta, Canada, the freshmen need
no more than a request to make orches
tral music at dawn for the word to be
j come reality," said Visiting Professor
Archibald F. McGoun today. For four
teen days the entering students wear
I their collars backward like good
i clergymen. That this has some won-
Iderful psychological effect is apparent
j when they parade without murmur at
4 o'clock in the morning with green
l painted faces for the exclusive benefit
of the upperclassmen.
But with all this Professor McGoun
is impressed with California and espe
cially with Stanford University. "Your
library is extraordinarily complete and
well arranged," he said. "In the library
at Alberta there is a scarcity of books
and inconvenience of arrangement and
files, as well as lack of seating capacity
i which make your building seem most
(extraordinary by contrast.
"It seems to be no diffilculty at all
for people to raise money here for any
purpose. Especially is your wealth ap
! parent in the lack of parking space
; everywhere for motor cars. In Alberta
quite the contrary is true. There is
plenty of parking space but a decided
1 scarcity of motors.
