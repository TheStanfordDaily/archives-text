# 145-POUND QUINTET SHOWS PROMISE IN BEATING PALO ALTO
## 
### Jimmie Adams 
Exhibiting surprisingly early-season
teamwork and displaying an able list
of reserves, the Stanford 145-pound
team trounced the Palo Alto High
School unlimiteds 25 to 16, last night
in the pavilion, in a preliminary to
the freshman game. Although slow
from a spectator's standpoint, due to
frequent substitutions, the game was
gratifying to Coach Hal Davis in re
vealing a number of fast, scrappy, and
apt substitutes.
Coach Davis played every man on
the squad, relieving the first string the
Becond quarter with the second five,
which was in turn taken out at the
end of the third frame and a third
quintet substituted. The first combina
tion proved the most effective and
was responsible for the majority of
points.
Blazier found the basket a number
of times, passed well, and displayed
some clever floor work. The passing and
teamwork was not perfect. Cairns and
Parsons of the second string both
played well and bid strongly for a
permanent position.
For the high school five Osmunson
and Haines showed to advantage. A
bit of fast playing was seen in the
last quarter when the two first string
fives got together but the Stanford
team seemingly had the edge through
out.
The line-ups were as follows:
Stanford 145's (25) Palo Alto (16)
Blazier P Brown
George F Stanton
Stewart C Martin
Kunzel G Smith
Clark G Trodson
Substitutedâ€”Stanford: Parsons, Sie
mons, Smith, Cairns, Dunfree, King,
Sibbett, Sawyer, Holstein, Cox, Elliot,
Ring, Cummins, Hughes, James.
