# PIEDMONT HIGH TAKES FAST GAME FROM BABE TEAM BY 15-14 SCORE
## CARDS LEAD AT HALF 5-4 Return of Altaffer, Dorcy, and Young Strengthens 1928 Outfit 
### Harry Bennett 
Piedmont high school forced the
freshmen to take a 15-14 beating in
the pavilion last night in what was
undoubtedly the fastest and closest
game seen in these parts go far this
season.
The first half progressed slowly with
neither team able to take many shots.
At the end of the first quarter Stan
ford led 5 to 4. Coach "Husky" Hunt
surprised the spectators by starting
the second quarter with Altaffer,
Young, and Dorcy in the lineup. These
men have just been declared eligible.
None of these players have seen any
action this season and, consequently,
were slow in getting under way. Until
half time neither quintet sank a bas
ket.
Bill Clark started the second half
by ringing the hoop from the middle
of the floor for two points for the
babes. The Cards were able to pene
trate the Piedmont defense many
times but on the follow shots were
unable to hit the hoop.
Piedmont Rallies
Led by Corbin, the Piedmont center,
the high school lads began a rally that
finally gave them a 14 to 9 lead. Cor
bin sank three baskets in rapid suc
cession and Johnson followed with
another from a hard side angle.
Dennis, the Card center, came back
with a goal but Johnson, the Piedmont
guard, offset this advantage by con
verting on two free throws.
Hunt then sent in Vincenti who
started the freshmen off on the final
fight that almost tied the score. He
played brilliantly and time after time
worked in under the basket for follow
shots.
Cliff Moore went in during the last
few moments and tallied two points
for the babes on a wonderful, long,
hard angle shot.
One of the fastest five-minute periods
of play witnessed so far this season
| on the campus started with Piedmont
leadirlg 15 to 13. Anxious to tie the
; score or get a one-point lead, the tabes
! shot from almost any place on the
1 floor.
One point was made by Clark on a
ifree throw hut that was as far as the
!
I scoring went. Throughout the entire
contest "Husky" Hunt sent in thirteen
different men and these seemed a far
I different bunch than those that fought
Salinas last Saturday.
Prospects Improved
For one thing, the prospects are
greatly improved by the return of
j Altaffer, Young, and Dorcy to the
ranks. None of these are outstanding
stars but do rank a little above the
! average run.
Football tactics were seen at various
points of the game but were done un
consciously and without any harm re
sulting.
Sam Moyer, well-known basketball
referee and coach of Piedmont high,
was of the opinion that the California
freshmen are now a better and strong
er built team, showing better team
work, but as for individual players
and possibilities of development, Stan
ford has the better outlook.
Piedmont met the Blue and Gold
babes last Friday and was defeated in
, much the same type of game by four
j points, the final count being 33 to 29.

few moments and tallied two points
for the babes on a wonderful, long,
hard angle shot.
One of the fastest five-minute periods
of play witnessed so far this season
| on the campus started with Piedmont
leadirlg 15 to 13. Anxious to tie the
; score or get a one-point lead, the tabes
! shot from almost any place on the
1 floor.
One point was made by Clark on a
ifree throw hut that was as far as the
!
I scoring went. Throughout the entire
contest "Husky" Hunt sent in thirteen
different men and these seemed a far
I different bunch than those that fought
Salinas last Saturday.
Prospects Improved
For one thing, the prospects are
greatly improved by the return of
j Altaffer, Young, and Dorcy to the
ranks. None of these are outstanding
stars but do rank a little above the
! average run.
Football tactics were seen at various
points of the game but were done un
consciously and without any harm re
sulting.
Sam Moyer, well-known basketball
referee and coach of Piedmont high,
was of the opinion that the California
freshmen are now a better and strong
er built team, showing better team
work, but as for individual players
and possibilities of development, Stan
ford has the better outlook.
Piedmont met the Blue and Gold
babes last Friday and was defeated in
, much the same type of game by four
j points, the final count being 33 to 29.
Piedmont high school forced the
freshmen to take a 15-14 beating in
the pavilion last night in what was
undoubtedly the fastest and closest
game seen in these parts go far this
season.
The first half progressed slowly with
neither team able to take many shots.
At the end of the first quarter Stan
ford led 5 to 4. Coach "Husky" Hunt
surprised the spectators by starting
the second quarter with Altaffer,
Young, and Dorcy in the lineup. These
men have just been declared eligible.
None of these players have seen any
action this season and, consequently,
were slow in getting under way. Until
half time neither quintet sank a bas
ket.
Bill Clark started the second half
by ringing the hoop from the middle
of the floor for two points for the
babes. The Cards were able to pene
trate the Piedmont defense many
times but on the follow shots were
unable to hit the hoop.
Piedmont Rallies
Led by Corbin, the Piedmont center,
the high school lads began a rally that
finally gave them a 14 to 9 lead. Cor
bin sank three baskets in rapid suc
cession and Johnson followed with
another from a hard side angle.
Dennis, the Card center, came back
with a goal but Johnson, the Piedmont
guard, offset this advantage by con
verting on two free throws.
Hunt then sent in Vincenti who
started the freshmen off on the final
fight that almost tied the score. He
played brilliantly and time after time
worked in under the basket for follow
shots.
