# IRELAND'S CREW MEETS VARSITY NINE TOMORROW
## Brown and Osthaus Wolter's Probable Choices for Vacant Berths 
### 
Cliff Ireland's Independents will
-meet the Stanford baseball team on
the varsity diamond tomorrow after
-noon in the first game of the annual
series. The announcement from the
Graduate Manager's office yesterday
that there would be a game with Ire
land this afternoon was unfounded,
according to word from the Sports
Publicity office this morning.
A wealth of material is on hand
and only three vacancies remain to be
filled from the team that succeeded in
putting over a win last year. Dave
Brown is the most likely man to step
into Frank Fuller's place at left field.
Dave is an expert fielder, but his bat
ting has not been consistent.
Franz Osthaus from last year's fresh
man team looks like the probable filler
of "Bud" Woodward's old position at
first base. Osthaus is also a fair
pitcher and a good batter. As neither
"Chuck" Johnston nor Jim Lawson
lias been practicing regularly the fight
for the backstop position for tomorrow
will be between Hal King and Johnnie
Kohler.
Veterans to Play
The rest of the team will no doubt
foe identical to the one that played
in the California series last year:
Tloberts, second; Mulchay, short; Cud
deback, third; and May and McCand
less, alternating between right and
•center fields.
All the varsity men have been show
ing good early-season batting form and
if they keep going the way they have
.in practice even Ireland's staff of
pitchers will be likely to take a pound
ing. The only thing that will hinder
the varsity at all is lack of practice
as a unit, and this should be secondary
as the Independents are in a somewhat
similar position.
Many Stars
Ireland's team is one of the greatest
collection of individual stars that he
has ever assembled. Practically every
unan on his team is well known in
either the Pacific Coast or the Major
Leagues. They will be handicapped be
cause the men have not played to-
gether enough. If the Stanford squad
benefits any from the two" extra days'
practice its members should not have
difficulty in dealing out a dose
similar to the one that Ireland received
at tneir hands last year.
For backstops, Ireland has Ritchie
and Anflnson. His pitching staff is
composed of such men as Ludolf, Ren
Kelley, Puccinello, Reppy, Cole, Man
ouk, and De Mayer. Bert Ellison of the
Seals will be on first, Stew Clark at
short, Montague at third, and Cliff
himself at second. Tanner will relieve
Ireland whenever it becomes necessary
for the witty Irishman to journey to
;he sideline and lend his efforts to
the vocal department.
At this branch of the game Ireland
has few peers on the Coast. His snappy
emarks keep the grandstand in a con
stant state of laughter although they
do not seem to affect the playing of
he opposing team to an appreciable
extent.

Publicity office this morning.
A wealth of material is on hand
and only three vacancies remain to be
filled from the team that succeeded in
putting over a win last year. Dave
Brown is the most likely man to step
into Frank Fuller's place at left field.
Dave is an expert fielder, but his bat
ting has not been consistent.
Franz Osthaus from last year's fresh
man team looks like the probable filler
of "Bud" Woodward's old position at
first base. Osthaus is also a fair
pitcher and a good batter. As neither
"Chuck" Johnston nor Jim Lawson
lias been practicing regularly the fight
for the backstop position for tomorrow
will be between Hal King and Johnnie
Kohler.
Veterans to Play
The rest of the team will no doubt
foe identical to the one that played
in the California series last year:
Tloberts, second; Mulchay, short; Cud
deback, third; and May and McCand
less, alternating between right and
•center fields.
All the varsity men have been show
ing good early-season batting form and
if they keep going the way they have
.in practice even Ireland's staff of
pitchers will be likely to take a pound
ing. The only thing that will hinder
the varsity at all is lack of practice
as a unit, and this should be secondary
as the Independents are in a somewhat
similar position.
Many Stars
Ireland's team is one of the greatest
collection of individual stars that he
has ever assembled. Practically every
unan on his team is well known in
either the Pacific Coast or the Major
Leagues. They will be handicapped be
cause the men have not played to-
gether enough. If the Stanford squad
benefits any from the two" extra days'
practice its members should not have
difficulty in dealing out a dose
similar to the one that Ireland received
at tneir hands last year.
For backstops, Ireland has Ritchie
and Anflnson. His pitching staff is
composed of such men as Ludolf, Ren
Kelley, Puccinello, Reppy, Cole, Man
ouk, and De Mayer. Bert Ellison of the
Seals will be on first, Stew Clark at
short, Montague at third, and Cliff
himself at second. Tanner will relieve
Ireland whenever it becomes necessary
for the witty Irishman to journey to
;he sideline and lend his efforts to
the vocal department.
At this branch of the game Ireland
has few peers on the Coast. His snappy
emarks keep the grandstand in a con
stant state of laughter although they
do not seem to affect the playing of
he opposing team to an appreciable
extent.
Cliff Ireland's Independents will
-meet the Stanford baseball team on
the varsity diamond tomorrow after
-noon in the first game of the annual
series. The announcement from the
Graduate Manager's office yesterday
that there would be a game with Ire
land this afternoon was unfounded,
according to word from the Sports
Publicity office this morning.
