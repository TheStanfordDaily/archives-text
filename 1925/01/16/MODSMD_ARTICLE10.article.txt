# SACRAMENTO WILL SEND STRONG QUINT AGAINST FRESHMEN
## Hunt Will Substitute Often in Effort to Discover Right Combination 
### John Levi 
The freshman basketball squad will re-
I ceive its third test of the season in the
pavilion tomorrow night at 8 o'clock
when it encounters the Sacramento high
school aggregation. Although little infor
mation can be obtained regarding the
high school team it is fairly certain that it
is a strong squad. In the past' Sacramento
teams have always been strong contenders
for the northern interscholastic champion
j ship, and so far this season the present
: team lias proved to be no exception.
The freshmen are still in an experi
mental stage. Coach "Husky" Hunt is
fairly certain that he will start Vincenti
and Altaffer at forwards, Dorcy at cen
ter, Clark at running guard, and Young
at standing guard. However, he is of the
opinion that the number of substitions
will be as great as in the previous con
tests.
New Lineup.
Hunt's task this year lias been a diffi
cut one. The winter quarter interrupted
his work when it was just reaching its
most constructive stage and when his
players returned he found it necessary to
reconstruct his whole lineup. The one
that he is starting tonight is composed of
several individual stars, but if their play
ing Wednesday night was any indication
they have much to learn before they will
be a smooth working aggregation.
It is true that the babes were playing
an exceptionally powerful high school ag
gregation, but this is no excuse for the
use of football tactics. In comparing the
Stanford freshmen with the California
babes, Coach Sam Moyer of Piedmont
high said, "You have a larger collection
of individual stars than California but
your men have not learned the secret of
playing together."
Strong Reserves.
For his second string Hunt has a list of
men who seem equally as good players as
those he is starting, but at the present
time lie is merey searchilng for an ef
fective combination? If the men he is
starting tomorrow night' ever get work
ing together they will no doubt be the
combination he will use during the season.
All the freshmen have plenty of fight
and wonderful possibilities. Clark and
Vincenti are the most accurate shots. On
the second string, Nye, Dennis and Moore
have been the most consistent point
gainers.
Dennis has an eye for follow-up shots
that converts many missed long shots into
the two points. Moore has a tendency to
disregard his teammates, but he is fast
and is an excellent shot. Nye started out
well this season but for a few days he
could not find the basket, and so Vincenti
was called upon, to take his place. Nye's
playing Wednesday night showed a flash
of his old form.
In short it is going to be difficult for
Hunt to choose to everyone's satisfaction,
or for that matter his own, a team that
he can truly call his first squad. It is pos
sible that he will be able to form two
teams of approximately the same strength.

mental stage. Coach "Husky" Hunt is
fairly certain that he will start Vincenti
and Altaffer at forwards, Dorcy at cen
ter, Clark at running guard, and Young
at standing guard. However, he is of the
opinion that the number of substitions
will be as great as in the previous con
tests.
New Lineup.
Hunt's task this year lias been a diffi
cut one. The winter quarter interrupted
his work when it was just reaching its
most constructive stage and when his
players returned he found it necessary to
reconstruct his whole lineup. The one
that he is starting tonight is composed of
several individual stars, but if their play
ing Wednesday night was any indication
they have much to learn before they will
be a smooth working aggregation.
It is true that the babes were playing
an exceptionally powerful high school ag
gregation, but this is no excuse for the
use of football tactics. In comparing the
Stanford freshmen with the California
babes, Coach Sam Moyer of Piedmont
high said, "You have a larger collection
of individual stars than California but
your men have not learned the secret of
playing together."
Strong Reserves.
For his second string Hunt has a list of
men who seem equally as good players as
those he is starting, but at the present
time lie is merey searchilng for an ef
fective combination? If the men he is
starting tomorrow night' ever get work
ing together they will no doubt be the
combination he will use during the season.
All the freshmen have plenty of fight
and wonderful possibilities. Clark and
Vincenti are the most accurate shots. On
the second string, Nye, Dennis and Moore
have been the most consistent point
gainers.
Dennis has an eye for follow-up shots
that converts many missed long shots into
the two points. Moore has a tendency to
disregard his teammates, but he is fast
and is an excellent shot. Nye started out
well this season but for a few days he
could not find the basket, and so Vincenti
was called upon, to take his place. Nye's
playing Wednesday night showed a flash
of his old form.
In short it is going to be difficult for
Hunt to choose to everyone's satisfaction,
or for that matter his own, a team that
he can truly call his first squad. It is pos
sible that he will be able to form two
teams of approximately the same strength.
The freshman basketball squad will re-
I ceive its third test of the season in the
pavilion tomorrow night at 8 o'clock
when it encounters the Sacramento high
school aggregation. Although little infor
mation can be obtained regarding the
high school team it is fairly certain that it
is a strong squad. In the past' Sacramento
teams have always been strong contenders
for the northern interscholastic champion
j ship, and so far this season the present
: team lias proved to be no exception.
The freshmen are still in an experi
mental stage. Coach "Husky" Hunt is
fairly certain that he will start Vincenti
and Altaffer at forwards, Dorcy at cen
ter, Clark at running guard, and Young
at standing guard. However, he is of the
opinion that the number of substitions
