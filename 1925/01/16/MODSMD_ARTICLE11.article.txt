# PALO ALTO TREE MAY DIE WITHIN NEXT TEN YEARS
## 
### 
"The Palo Alto tree may die within ,
ten years," declared Professor G. J.
Pierce of the Bontany department yes
terday. "Lack of water, a destroyed
root system, and sooted foliage are j
threatening the life of Palo Alto's j
famed landmark."
Appearing on the seal of the Univer
sity and decorating the masthead of
the Daily Palo Alto, this tree has re
ceived national attention. It is located
at the railroad bridge over San Fran
cisqufto creek and can easily be seen
from either the track or highway.
"Water that is necessary for the
existence of the Palo Alto tree is no
longer available since the San Fran
cisquito creek has been dry for years,
and the water level has been lowered j
by the increased use of well water for i
irrigation," Professor Pierce said. "The
heavy concrete retaining wall of the !
railroad bridge has destroyed most of
the system, and the tree is now only
supported by four steel cables. All of
the leaves have turned black because !
of the smoke from passing locomo-1
tives."
Several attempts have been made i

by individuals and organizations to
save the tree. The Native Sons have
tried to prolong its life but they have
at last given up. The city of Palo Alto
has spread fertile soil over its roots
and has watered it, but these relief
measures have been entirely inade
quate, due to the size of the tree.
Under the direction of Vanderlynn j
Stow, former treasurer of the Univer-1
sity, seven young redwood trees were j
planted in the west circle in front
of the Physics building eight years I
ago and they are growing rapidly. Of
the six still remaining, one has reached
the height of thirty feet, with the j
others nearly as tall. When the Palo ;
Alto tree dies the largest of these
redwoods will become its successor.
Tf the proposed new subway is built
under the railroad tracks at the bridge
conecting Alma street to the highway, j
it will paralyze the life of the tree
by blocking it off on the south side.
It will be cheaper to build a bridge
over San Francisquito creek and con
nect Alma street to Menlo Park. This
will save the tree from perishing for
a few years longer.

of the smoke from passing locomo-1
tives."
Several attempts have been made i

by individuals and organizations to
save the tree. The Native Sons have
tried to prolong its life but they have
at last given up. The city of Palo Alto
has spread fertile soil over its roots
and has watered it, but these relief
measures have been entirely inade
quate, due to the size of the tree.
Under the direction of Vanderlynn j
Stow, former treasurer of the Univer-1
sity, seven young redwood trees were j
planted in the west circle in front
of the Physics building eight years I
ago and they are growing rapidly. Of
the six still remaining, one has reached
the height of thirty feet, with the j
others nearly as tall. When the Palo ;
Alto tree dies the largest of these
redwoods will become its successor.
Tf the proposed new subway is built
under the railroad tracks at the bridge
conecting Alma street to the highway, j
it will paralyze the life of the tree
by blocking it off on the south side.
It will be cheaper to build a bridge
over San Francisquito creek and con
nect Alma street to Menlo Park. This
will save the tree from perishing for
a few years longer.
