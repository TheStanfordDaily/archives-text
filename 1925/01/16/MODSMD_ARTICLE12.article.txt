# Fraternity Man "Places One On" Encina Freshman
## 
### 
The first violation of the rushing
rules occurred last week. A local Greek
happened to be passing Encina hall
oile evening when he was showered
from above with a bucket of very wet
water.
The fraternity man immediately for
got all the warnings on rushing that
he had heard at the last house meet
ing, and dashed into the secret en
virons of the freshmen. Incidentally he
pinned something on the frosh, and
rumor is that it was not a pledge pin.
It is still undecided whether the
Interfraternity Conference will punish
the fraternity or give the criminal
member a vote of thanks. It has been
suggested that he be honored with one
of the sponsor positions.
