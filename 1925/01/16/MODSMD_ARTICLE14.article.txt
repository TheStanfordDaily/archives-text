# STANFORD DEBATERS SCHEDULE TILT WITH OREGON OVER RADIO
## 
### 
Stanford debaters will match their
wits with the University of Oregon
speakers via radio during spring vaca-
tion. Arrangements have just been
completed with the Oakland Tribune
radio station whereby the Cardinal
team will be able to use KLX to up-
hold their end of the argument.
Other debates planned for the near
future include Kansas State Agricul-
ture College and Utah State Agricul-
ture. Kansas State will be met on
April 7 but the date with Utah is as
yet undetermined.
Tryouts for these debates have been
set for Monday, January 26, in the
Little Theatre.
The question for the tryout is: "Re-
solved, That the Immigration Law of
1924 should be so amended as to admit
| Japanese on the same basis as Euro
peans."
On account of the great number of
i tryoutees expected, it is entirely prob
able that the main speeches will be
only four minutes in length instead of
the usual five. The usual three-minute
rebuttal period will remain intact.
To those intending to become candi
dates for the squad, W. Leslie Gosslin
urges an immediate registration with
him. He can be found either in Bran-
ner hall or Room 205 on the Quad.
