# NEVERS SLATED TO START GAME WITH SAGEHENS
## Harry Shipkey Looks Like Best Bet for Regular Varsity Center 
### 
Ernie Nevers is expected to appear
in the starting line-up of the Stanford
quintet in its game against Pomona at
Claremont tonight. With Nevers back
at his old position the Cards' chances
to put over a victory will be consider
ably increased, because the big for
ward adds greatly to Kerr's fast, driv
ing offense.
Harry Shipkey will probably work
at center in preference to Wally Jay
red, if the team used in scrimmage
before the team went south is an in
dication of the players Kerr will use
in the south. Fred Price has a little the
edge over Nelson David for the other
forward job. If Nevers is bothered by
his ankles, David will probably replace
him early in the game. Otherwise
David will alternate with Price.
Oliva Only Back Guard
Captain Dave Oliva was the only
standing guard to make the trip to
Los Angeles. This indicates that the
Redshirt leader will have to play all of
the game with Pomona, and also the
game with Southern Branch tomorrow
night.
Ted Shipkey went along as a substi
tute for "Mugs" Mitchell. Mitchell has
been going good so far this season,
while Shipkey has not had an oppor
tunity to show his wares.
Harry Shipkey is beginning to forget
football tactics, and is fitting quite
well into the scheme of things around
a basketball court. Jayred will un
doubtedly get to play in both games,
and Ned Anderson is also on hand
should a third center be needed.
' Tom Alexander, a forward, is the
other member of the squad to be
taken on the trip. Alexander has been
on the varsity as a substitute for three
years. However, with Nevers, Price,
and David all in great shape, Alexan
der may not be used.
