# TEMPLETON PICKS THIRTY-SEVEN FOR CARD TRACK SQUAD
## 
### 
I Coach "Dink" Templeton selected
j thirty-seven men for his varsity track
j squad yesterday afternoon. The men
I picked are mainly from last year's
varsity and freshman teams.
Those chosen are as follows: Camp-
I bell, Gaspar, Babcock, Adams, Frye,
Garthwaite, Miller, Shermund, Rich
' mann, Richardson, Kerr, Swayne,
Smith, Leistner, Hartranft, Richards,
Evers, Work, Kemnitzer, Macßae,
; Meeks, Hyland, Chase, Dole, Cum
mings, Charles, Cypher, Clifford, Mc
i Lellan, Murphy, West, Crooksliank,
Wells, Heston, Scofield, Whistler, and
I Lloyd.
The track squad was dealt a severe
! blow when Hal Roles was forced to
! give up hurdling this year because of
] sickness. Boles placed third in the
high sticks in the Big Meet last April
and was counted upon for points this
| season.
The loss of Hale, Storie, and Boles
has handicapped the Cardinal track
prospects for the 1925 season. Stan
ford was doped for another victory
over California this year, but the loss
of these men weaken the Card chances.
Such college dual meets as may be
scheduled will be held on the new
track in the Stanford stadium. The
1 contest with the Olympic club will be
run off on the old oval, where the daily
| workouts will also be held.
