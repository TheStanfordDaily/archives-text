Cliff Ireland will be here tomorrow, weather permitting, just as he has
been for thirty-three years. Stanford baseball, it almost seems, would l>e
entirely different if Ireland's Independents failed to show up in January
or February for the annual breaking of the ice. 4
A freshman who happens to drift out to the varsity diamond during
one of Cliff's engagements seldom fails to show up once or twice during
the subsequent three years. There is something about the Ireland brand
of humor—and baseball—that calls for more. Cliff's teams are always
made up of a real bunch of baseballers, and they give the Cards the scare
of their lives, if not more. As an exclusively baseball exhibition, the
fracas is always worth seeing.
But add to that ClifPhimself. For weeks after his three-game engage
ments the campus quotes him. His "Don't get hoit" and "Shut the gate"
endure throughout the intramural baseball season, and although his more
impromptu flurries of wit are not quite so permanent, they usually bring
down the house.
Teams like the Independents are a great thing for sports, and the tough
part of it is that there are so few of them. Cliff gathers in his array of
talent from every available source, and the diamond stars flock to him as
though h» were the force of gravity. They do this for two reasons—
first, it gives them good pitching and competition in general in preparation
for the coming season of professional baseball, and second, they get
about as much kick out of playing for Cliff as they would for a salary.
The result is that the atmosphere has more of sportsmanship than is
usually possible in athletic competition. Both teams do their best to win,
and neither loses anything tangible in defeat. The college men are im
proved by rubbing up against individual brilliance, and the professionals
get their first taste of battling against team-work after a winter of non
baseball.
Cliff Ireland himself, rather time-worn but still spry and foxy, is doing
a lot for all kinds of baseball on the Pacific Coast. And his personality
makes his good work vastly attractive. When, finally, second base gets
a little too hot for him, it would be well for him to make a hobby of debat
ing, or anything that isn't physically strenuous. We don't want to lose
Cliff.

get their first taste of battling against team-work after a winter of non
baseball.
Cliff Ireland himself, rather time-worn but still spry and foxy, is doing
a lot for all kinds of baseball on the Pacific Coast. And his personality
makes his good work vastly attractive. When, finally, second base gets

ing, or anything that isn't physically strenuous. We don't want to lose
Cliff.
