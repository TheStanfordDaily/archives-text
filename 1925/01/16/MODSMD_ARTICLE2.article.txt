# FORMER STANFORD MEN SUCCEED IN JOURNALISM--SMITH
## 
### 
"Stanford men now engaged in jour
nalism are as a group successful," de
clared Professor Everett W. Smith of
the Journalism division, who spoke to an
informal gathering of students at his
home last night, on his experiences in the
cast during the past fall.
After teaching at the University of
Wisconsin summer quarter, Professor
Smith made a tour of Eastern colleges,
studying their journalism departments,
and visited many prominent newspaper
:men in New York, Washington, and other
eastern cities.
Among the journalists who have
reached high positions are a number of
Stanford graduates. "Their distinguish
ing characteristic seems to be an excep
tional amount of originality and innova
tion," Professor Smith stated. "They all
seem to be doing things in new and dif
ferent ways. All are modest and unas
suming when it comes to discussing their
own achievements, and most of them term
luck what was really their own ability."
According to Professor Smith, almost
the entire editorial staffs of some of the
New York papers and also the United
Press at Washington, are composed of
Stanford men, all of whom have gotten
their positions without help from the
others.
