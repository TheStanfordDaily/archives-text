# Fairness, Not Convenience

A letter in yesterday's Daily called attention to the fact that freshman
class meetings had been held in Encina, rather effectively prohibiting the
presence of the women members of 1928. It was a mere suggestion that
the situation be remedied, and it seems to be a very good suggestion indeed.
With so large a proportion of the class living together in Encina, it
would be easy to forget or to disregard the few who struggle along else
where. And, as this letter intimates, the women probably take as much
or more interest in class matters as do the men. Unquestionably they are
entitled to a voice in the conduct of affairs, and they are fortunate in hav
ing a representative who spoke for that voice when the need became ap
parent.
It is a great convenience to the 1928 men to hold their class meetings in
their own place of residence, but it is not fair to the women of the class
or to the class itself. This disregard cannot have Ijeen intentional, and the
Daily hopes that the proper authorities will see to it that the blunder is
not repeated.
