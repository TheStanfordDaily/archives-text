January 15, 1904
At a meeting of the Athletic com
mittee last night action was taken to
prevent the promiscuous wearing of
preparatory school sweaters and jer
seys by Stanford men. The committee
believed that this practice detracted
from the dignity of the Stanford var
sity letter.
Forty men turned out yesterday for
the first baseball practice of the year.
Eight varsity men form the nucleus
around which Coach Doyle will build
his '04 nine. Among the games sche
duled is one with a team composed
of alumni of both Stanford and Cali
fornia. It is also probable that Ireland
will organize a team similar to the
Independents of last year and bring it
to the campus for a game.
Final tryouts for the selection of
the Carnot debating team will be held
in the chapel tomorrow night. Judges
will be I)r. R. M. Alden, Prof. C. A.
Duniway, and M. G. Dodge.
While the conditions this year are
not as good as they were last year
there is yet great reason to hope that

the Stanford team will capture the |
medal that last year was awarded to !
a California man.
The play "David Garrick," which is j
to be presented by the sophomore j
class on the evening of January 22 is
one of the best modern comedies. The
parts have been carefully rehearsed
and studied since early in November
and no effort is being spared to make
i the production one of the most inter- j
lesting and artistic of the year.
