The well and favorably known pro
prietor of Morey's Smoke Shop has
been chosen by Judge Winterbottom
as most deserving of the first prize in
the great Cabbage Title Contest. The
Hon. Mr. Winterbottom deliberated
deeply before choosing the winner,
completing the selection in 3.1416 sec
onds, sight unseen.
With the 100 denomination bill dis
posed of, it was a comparatively easy
matter to award the other two. Charles
Wegner, the fastest compositor west
of Eureka, wins the 50 prize with the
suggestion "Bull!" He was handi
capped considerably by his neglect to
include the family name of Durham in
his title, but the- exclamation point
gave him second place over Ray Law,
humorist, scholar, sports expert, and
bonvivant, who submitted practically
the same thing.
Among those which were dangerous
contenders were Downing McGallon's
suggestion that the noble animal pic
tured above represented the same
thing as "bad breath," or "H-l-t-s-s."
The title "Static" won much praise.
The prizes will be presented this
evening at mignight on the Law Steps.
(And the big stiff who suggested
"Cabbages" will find no welcome!)
