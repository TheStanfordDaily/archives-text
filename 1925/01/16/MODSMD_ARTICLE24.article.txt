# CARD VARSITY SQUAD ARRIVES TONIGHT IN SOUTH
## 
### 
Tia Juana, April 1 (1944) —The
Stanford card team, accompanied by
Coach Eddey, arrived here today in
splendid shape.
Some of the men Trainer Denny re
ported to have lost capital on the trip,
but a corresponding gain by the first
string players is expected to counter
balance this.
Alumni who are spending this spring
at the resort here have formed an
association and have placed large re
serves at the disposal of the team.
Large dividends are expected, particu
larly from poker. —Steve and Dud.
