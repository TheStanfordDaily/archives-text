A
I The Editor, Sir :
Hear a few remarks from an humble
j law student in reference to your recent
! editorial, "The Cart Before the Horse."
| The student there referred to as being in
"cerebral anguish" is apt to remain agi
tated for a long time if he thinks that any
law school can or expects to turn him out
in the cold world equipped with a clientele,
an office, a mahogany desk, and a blonde
| stenographer. It certainly would be con-!
venient if it could be done; but even in
: this age of efficiency, there are always
j some things that a man simply has to do
■ for himself. The path of life has not yet
been electrified.
What does the law school (I can speak j
for no other department) aim to- do for a
! student? In my opinion, it does not even
. pretend to turn out law practitioners; its
| sole aim is to equip a man to become a
law practitioner. And notice that there
l is a difference between a lawyer and one
[ who practices law ; many lawyers are not |
practitioners. But the law school does i
turn out lawyers—very good ones (it is j
going to turn me out soon).
The question then is, Is the law school i
right in attempting only to turn out mere
lawyers, or should it go a step further
and turn out practitioners? My own opin
ion (humbly, as I before remarked) is
that it should go a whole lot further in this
direction than it does. I think that most
law students will agree that the process
of becoming a mere lawyer is much too
laborious; that there is an unnecessary j
amount of drudgery imposed on students
in merely equipping them to become prac
titioners. In other words, the gap be
tween the lawyer and the practitioner is
much too large when the student gets his
J. D.
How could this be remedied? In my
opinion (Uriah Heep had nothing on me
for humbleness now) it should not take
three quarters to instill into a student the
underlying theories and principles of con
tract, for instance, and the underlying
theories and principles is all that a student
remembers by the time he gets his J. D.
anyhow. It seems to me that a student
could more profitably use some of this
time in preparing a few contracts of his

| own to test his understanding of the sub
' ject. And he should be allowed to bring
j and defend a few moot-court actions in
j volving contracts at the same time that he
studies the subject. As it' is, in none of
the law courses does the student do any
of the actual work that a lawyer would
have to do in handling cases in that sub
ject. He studies the principles and
theories only. And principles and theories
taken alone are dry and indigestible, yet
the law student must assimilate them, in
vast quantities, to get a J. D.

! editorial, "The Cart Before the Horse."
| The student there referred to as being in
"cerebral anguish" is apt to remain agi
tated for a long time if he thinks that any
law school can or expects to turn him out
in the cold world equipped with a clientele,
an office, a mahogany desk, and a blonde
| stenographer. It certainly would be con-!
venient if it could be done; but even in
: this age of efficiency, there are always
j some things that a man simply has to do
■ for himself. The path of life has not yet
been electrified.
What does the law school (I can speak j
for no other department) aim to- do for a
! student? In my opinion, it does not even
. pretend to turn out law practitioners; its
| sole aim is to equip a man to become a
law practitioner. And notice that there
l is a difference between a lawyer and one
[ who practices law ; many lawyers are not |
practitioners. But the law school does i
turn out lawyers—very good ones (it is j
going to turn me out soon).
The question then is, Is the law school i
right in attempting only to turn out mere
lawyers, or should it go a step further
and turn out practitioners? My own opin
ion (humbly, as I before remarked) is
that it should go a whole lot further in this
direction than it does. I think that most
law students will agree that the process
of becoming a mere lawyer is much too
laborious; that there is an unnecessary j
amount of drudgery imposed on students
in merely equipping them to become prac
titioners. In other words, the gap be
tween the lawyer and the practitioner is
much too large when the student gets his
J. D.
How could this be remedied? In my
opinion (Uriah Heep had nothing on me
for humbleness now) it should not take
three quarters to instill into a student the
underlying theories and principles of con
tract, for instance, and the underlying
theories and principles is all that a student
remembers by the time he gets his J. D.
anyhow. It seems to me that a student
could more profitably use some of this
time in preparing a few contracts of his

| own to test his understanding of the sub
' ject. And he should be allowed to bring
j and defend a few moot-court actions in
j volving contracts at the same time that he
studies the subject. As it' is, in none of
the law courses does the student do any
of the actual work that a lawyer would
have to do in handling cases in that sub
ject. He studies the principles and
theories only. And principles and theories
taken alone are dry and indigestible, yet
the law student must assimilate them, in
vast quantities, to get a J. D.
