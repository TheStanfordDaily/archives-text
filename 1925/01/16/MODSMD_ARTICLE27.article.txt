# FEG MURRAY SPORT CARTOONS WILL RUN IN D. P. A. COLUMNS
## 
### 
After an absence of six months, Feg
\lurray and his sports cartoons, titled
"Sports of 1925," are to make their re
appearance in the Daily Palo Alto begin
ning Monday.
The reproduction of Murray's work on
the Stanford campus is unique in that
Murray himself graced the "Farm" and
its athletic fields from 1912 to 1910. His
greatest line of athletic endeavor was on
the cinder path and for four years he led
the Card hurdlers, emerging in 1916 as
captain of the team.
His greatest feat while bearing the
Cardinal colors was his entry into the
Intercollegiate Track Meet at Boston in
1915. There he annexed the national
titles in both high and low hurdle cham
pionships. In 1916 he accompanied a
five-man team of United States' stars to
Norway and Sweden.
Another avocation absorbed Murray's
attention, however. This was the pursuit
of art, and upon deciding to turn this into
a vocation, he graduated in 1916 with the
degree of B.A. in the Graphic Arts de
partment. Following his jaunt to Europe,
he advanced on New York to enter the
Art Students' League to study drawing
and painting. These he struggled with in
the daytime, and at night continued his
old habits of winning medals by running
for the New York Athletic club.
Feg was still hard at work on cartoon
ing when the war broke out, but he man
aged to reconcile Cartoon to Kultur and
took his chalks and paper with him into
the trenches. Following the Armistice,
he tried his hand at animated cartoons in
New York, became engaged to Miss Doro
thy Hanna, a former Stanford girl, and
went into training for the 1920 Olympiad.
Although out of the game for years, he
made the team and took third place in the
110-metre hurdle race at Antwerp.
He is now married, and draws regularly
for news syndicates, besides an occasional
contribution to Chaparral in the way of
his unique "Snoppyquops."
Murray, who is a son of Professor A.
T. Murray of the Department of Classical
Literature, is a member of Skull and
Snakes, Hammer and Coffin, and Kappa
Alpha.
