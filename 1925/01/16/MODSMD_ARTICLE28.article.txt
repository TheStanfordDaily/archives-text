# WOMEN'S ASILOMAR MEETS JANUARY 30
## 
### 
Women of Stanford, the University
of California, and possibly Southern
California and Arizona, will meet at
the Asilomar conference from January
30 to February 1.
By leaving Friday the women can
have two whole days at Asilomar.
Leaving Saturday or even Saturday
night will give plenty of time, how
ever, as the return need not be made
until Sunday night or early Monday
morning.
Approximately $11 is figured as the
whole expense of the conference. Of
this $5 is for transportation, $1 for
registration, and $4.50 for board and
room.
Speakers of the national Y. M. C. A.
organization, and from the East as
well as from this Coast, are scheduled
for the winter conference this year.
An opportunity is thus offered for dis
cussion and information on questions
of importance, as well as for the en
joyment of Asilomar and a general
good time.
