"Ireland at the Cross Roads" will be
the -subject of a lecture by H. G. Scott
next Tuesday evening at 7:30 in the
Little Theatre.
The title accurately represents,
Scott says, the exceedingly doubtful
and critical situatioh at the present
moment. Scott is a Scotch barrister
holding an M.A. degree from the Uni
versity of Edinburgh with honors in
Classics and Ancient History, and an
L.L.B. degree. He is a qualified solici
tor of Scotland, and a barrister solici
tor of Alberta, Canada. He served In
the late war in France and Greece,
and since then has been engaged in
editorial work, and in the writing of
special articles for Alberta news
papers.
All athletic relations between
Wabash college, Indiana, and DePauw
University have been severed as a re
sult of the indictment of twenty
Wabash students for malicious tres
pass in connection with the smearing
of red paint on some of the buildings
at DePauw.
