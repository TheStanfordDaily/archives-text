# FRUIT BASKETS AND FOOTBALL USED FOR INITIAL COURT GAME
## 
### Astrid Arnoldson 
Basketball is scarcely thirty-four
years old. It was invented in 1891 by
James Naismith, a student at the Y. M.
C. A. Training School at Springfield,
Mass. The success of the 1890 football
season had left everyone enthusiastic
over games, and Dr. Luther Gulick
held a class discussion one day on
games suitable for gymnasium play.
The students decided that the follow
ing features were necessary:
1. The game should call for as many
players as possible.
2. Teamwork was preferable to in
dividual effort.
3. The game should be played with
a ball or some similar object.
4. Two or more goals were desirable.
The rules worked out by Mr. Nais
mith are for the most part still used
today. He said:
Boxes Were Goals
Goals may be boxes or baskets fif
teen inches in diameter and also in
depth. The ball may be thrown or
batted in any direction.
Players may not run with the ball.
The ball is to be held with the hands,
not against the arms or body. Three
consecutive fouls, mostly for rough
play, count as a goal for the opponents.
The player first touching the ball out
of bounds is entitled to throw it in.
The umpire is to watch the ball while
the referee is to watch the players
and keep the score.
' The two halves are to be of fifteen
minutes' play, with five minutes' inter
mission.
Small Gym
The original gymnasium was very
small, being only 24x34 feet in size.
The ball used was a football, and the
baskets were sixteen-quart peach bas
kets, the only available containers of
a, suitable kind. Most, of the players
were football men, and so the game
was pretty rough. Every time either
side scored, a step-ladder had to be
called into play to get the ball out of
the basekts. Later mesh baskets were
substituted.
Nine men played on each side in the
first game, but the number was soon
reduced to seven. The players wore
long gymnasium trousers and sleeve
jerseys.
