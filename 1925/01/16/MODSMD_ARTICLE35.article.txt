# Campus Journalists Meet, Plan Dance This Quarter
## 
### 
Plans for an informal dahce were
discussed at the meeting of the Stan
ford Journalists Club last night. A
committee was selected to work upon
this affair and it is probable the Jour
nalists Club will be hosts to the cam
pus in the Women's Clubhouse before
the end of the year.
The club members decided to revise
and publish a Stanford handbook. At
present this handbook is in an incom
plete state, having been started sev
eral years ago and then left unfinished.
The book will be put on the press as
soon as possible, and when finished
will serve as a complete guide to the
Stanford campus.
