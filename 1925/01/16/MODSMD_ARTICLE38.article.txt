# STANFORD FRESHMEN SHOULD HAVE STRONG TRACK AGGREGATION
## 
### Wilbur Adama 
Prospects for a freshman track vic
tory over the California Cubs look
bright again this year, since a large
number of former high school stars
are working out under Coach "Dink"
Templeton every afternoon.
The hurdle events will be as much
Stanford this season as they were in
the Litle Big Meet last April. Ross
Nichols of Huntington Beach is inter
scholastic hurdle champion. Nichols
is the speediest looking man that has
entered Stanford for some time, and
he bids well to take Leistner's place
on the varsity when the latter gradu
ates in June.
As a running mate for Nichols is
Smisseart, who ran the 120 low hur
dles for the Alympic Club last sea
son. The ex-Club man can run a lap in
the relay also. He will likely be used
in both the high sticks and quarter
inile events for the freshmen.
Good Quarter-Miler
There are other good 440 runners,
besides Smisseart, out for the 1928
team. Boardon of Palo Alto, and Mc-
Guire, of Santa Rosa, are showing well
in the one-lap race. Boardon placed
second in a :51 flat race in the North
Coast high school track • meet last
year. .
'McGuire has nad some experience in
the quarter, but has more of a half
miler's build. He may be shifted to
the 880 this year to fill the vacancy
in that event.
Raney will take care of the mile
and two-mile runs for the 1925 men.
Raney showed his ability in the cross
country and in practice meets last
quarter. It is believed that he will give
Lockhart, the California frosh, a close
race. Lockhart won the 1500 meter
race from Kerr and Smith in the
Olympic tryouts last spring. Although
he is a transfer from Sacramento Jun
ior College, he is ineligible for varsity
competition until next season.
Lack of Sprinters
The sprints look rather weak at
present. Bly is the only freshman who
is showing any form in these races,
but his time has not been very good
as yet.
Rupe and King are two high jumpers
of note. Both men have cleared the
bar at 6 feet. King's best jump is 6
feet 2 inches, which is about the
height that the event was won in the
freshman meet at California last year.
As usual, the freshman football team
turns out en masse for the weight
events. L. Dorcy, Patchett, and Altaf
fer are showing well in the shot, dis
cus, and javelin. Altaffer's throws in
the javelin are especially good.

events. L. Dorcy, Patchett, and Altaf
fer are showing well in the shot, dis
cus, and javelin. Altaffer's throws in
the javelin are especially good.
Prospects for a freshman track vic
tory over the California Cubs look
bright again this year, since a large
number of former high school stars
are working out under Coach "Dink"
Templeton every afternoon.
The hurdle events will be as much
Stanford this season as they were in
the Litle Big Meet last April. Ross
Nichols of Huntington Beach is inter
scholastic hurdle champion. Nichols
is the speediest looking man that has
entered Stanford for some time, and
he bids well to take Leistner's place
on the varsity when the latter gradu
ates in June.
As a running mate for Nichols is
Smisseart, who ran the 120 low hur
dles for the Alympic Club last sea
son. The ex-Club man can run a lap in
the relay also. He will likely be used
in both the high sticks and quarter
inile events for the freshmen.
Good Quarter-Miler
There are other good 440 runners,
besides Smisseart, out for the 1928
team. Boardon of Palo Alto, and Mc-
Guire, of Santa Rosa, are showing well
in the one-lap race. Boardon placed
second in a :51 flat race in the North
Coast high school track • meet last
year. .
'McGuire has nad some experience in
the quarter, but has more of a half
miler's build. He may be shifted to
the 880 this year to fill the vacancy
in that event.
Raney will take care of the mile
and two-mile runs for the 1925 men.
Raney showed his ability in the cross
country and in practice meets last
quarter. It is believed that he will give
Lockhart, the California frosh, a close
race. Lockhart won the 1500 meter
race from Kerr and Smith in the
Olympic tryouts last spring. Although
he is a transfer from Sacramento Jun
ior College, he is ineligible for varsity
competition until next season.
Lack of Sprinters
The sprints look rather weak at
present. Bly is the only freshman who
is showing any form in these races,
but his time has not been very good
as yet.
Rupe and King are two high jumpers
of note. Both men have cleared the
bar at 6 feet. King's best jump is 6
feet 2 inches, which is about the
height that the event was won in the
freshman meet at California last year.
As usual, the freshman football team
turns out en masse for the weight
events. L. Dorcy, Patchett, and Altaf
fer are showing well in the shot, dis
cus, and javelin. Altaffer's throws in
the javelin are especially good.
