# Fewer Students Will "Transfer" to Nevada
## 
### 
Prospective Stanford "flunk-outs"
have sent scouts out on the trail of a
new university that they ruay enter
immediately upon severing connections
here.
Such drastic actions are necessary
now that the University of Nevada has
annonunced a higher scholarship
standard and a boost in non-resident
tuition.
The new limitations will be effective
upon registration next fall. Limited
and special students from outside
Nevada will not be allowed to register
and first-year students must have
eight recommending units. In 1926 it
will be necessary to have ten.
The present non-resident tuition of
$60 has been raised to $75. Moral:
Do your "flunking-out" this quarter.
