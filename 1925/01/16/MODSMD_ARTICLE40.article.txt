# Small Bird Delights in First Journalism Class Of University Training
## 
### 
A new recruit in search of the "higher
learning" to be gained at a university
made his appearance in his first class this
morning. ,
A sparrOw, with an inheritance of fond
ness for perching on doorways, inherited
perhaps from Poe's raven, heard the class
in news writing this morning.
This is the first time in the history of
the University tliat one of the feathered
variety has sought entrance to the halls
of knowledge. However, for some time
dogs have attended class more religiously
than students.
There was 110 sign of a desire on the
part of tht newcomer to croak out a dis
gusted "Nevermore," but a decided
sprightliness and abandon in his method
of flying was taken by the observer to
show his delight at being "on the inside."
It is thought that this may be a move
ment on the part of the sparrows to com
bine the functions of the carrier pigeon,
and the news writer himself, bringing
about a news writing system to be envied
by any corporation.
