# THETA XI DEFEATS DELTA UPSILON IN FAST GAME 23-10
## Japanese Club Squad Loses To Branner Seconds in Upset of Dope 
### Al Post 
Exhibiting good passing and almost
perfect teamwork, the Theta Xi quin
tet defeated Delta Upsilon 23 to 10
last night in one of the fastest con
tests yet played in the intramural
series.
Scores for the other games were:.
Phi Delta Theta 16, Alpha Sigma Phi
1; Breakers Club 5, Alpha Tau Omega
4; Branner Seconds 14, Japanese Club
7; Encina 2W 14, Phi Gamma Delta 8.
Theta Xi won one of the leagues
last year and seems to be in a fair
way to reach the finals for the Uni
versity championship this season.
Work, Murray, Schofield, and Mulchay
showed particularly well, and Delta
Uupsilon was outclassed by a bigger
margin than the score indicates.
The D. U.'s showed occasional flash
es of ability, and at one time were
tied with the winners, but could not
hold the pace. At half Theta Xi led
13 to 6. Atwell, Hyland, and Osthaus
shone for Delta Upsilon.
Alpha Sigs Generous
An extremely novel feature of Phi
Delta Theta's 16 to 1 triumph over
Alpha Sigma Phi came when an un
known Alpha Sig became so excited
as to toss a perfectly good field goal
into the Phi Delt basket. This evi
dently weakened the morale of the
losers, for although they had numer
ous chances to annex points after the
brodie had been pulled they missed
out by a narrow margin every time.
Ferguson saved the Alpha Sigs from
a coat of whitewash by sinking a free
throw, and played a good game
throughout. Plater, Logan, and Keny
were mainly responsible for the Phi
Delt victory. Plater especially came
through in good shape.
