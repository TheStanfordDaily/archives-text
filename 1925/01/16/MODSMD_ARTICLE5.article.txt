# THETA XI DEFEATS DELTA UPSILON IN FAST GAME 23-10
## Japanese Club Squad Loses To Branner Seconds in Upset of Dope 
### Al Post 
Exhibiting good passing and almost
perfect teamwork, the Theta Xi quin
tet defeated Delta Upsilon 23 to 10
last night in one of the fastest con
tests yet played in the intramural
series.
Scores for the other games were:.
Phi Delta Theta 16, Alpha Sigma Phi
1; Breakers Club 5, Alpha Tau Omega
4; Branner Seconds 14, Japanese Club
7; Encina 2W 14, Phi Gamma Delta 8.
Theta Xi won one of the leagues
last year and seems to be in a fair
way to reach the finals for the Uni
versity championship this season.
Work, Murray, Schofield, and Mulchay
showed particularly well, and Delta
Uupsilon was outclassed by a bigger
margin than the score indicates.
The D. U.'s showed occasional flash
es of ability, and at one time were
tied with the winners, but could not
hold the pace. At half Theta Xi led
13 to 6. Atwell, Hyland, and Osthaus
shone for Delta Upsilon.
Alpha Sigs Generous
An extremely novel feature of Phi
Delta Theta's 16 to 1 triumph over
Alpha Sigma Phi came when an un
known Alpha Sig became so excited
as to toss a perfectly good field goal
into the Phi Delt basket. This evi
dently weakened the morale of the
losers, for although they had numer
ous chances to annex points after the
brodie had been pulled they missed
out by a narrow margin every time.
Ferguson saved the Alpha Sigs from
a coat of whitewash by sinking a free
throw, and played a good game
throughout. Plater, Logan, and Keny
were mainly responsible for the Phi
Delt victory. Plater especially came
through in good shape.
In a slow but nevertheless exciting
struggle Breakers club took the meas
ure of Alpha Tau Omega, 5 to 4, estab
lishing a low point record for the pres
ent intramural series. Both teams
threw a well-developed defense around
their respective baskets and spent
most of the time passing the ball
around in the middle of the floor.
Toffelmier put A. T. O. out in front
at the start with a field goal, but
George of the Breakers looped in a
basket and free throw before the end
of the half, putting the club in the
lead 3 to 2. In the second period A.
T. O. again forged ahead on Mariette's
field goal and held its opponents score
les until near the close of the game,
when Compton contributed the win
ning two points for the Breakers after
many unsuccessful attempts.
Branner Surprises
Branner Seconds surprised the ma
jority of spectators by downing the
Japanese Club 14 to 7 without a great
deal of trouble. The Japs had one of
thfe best teams in the University last
year and were counted upon to repeat.
They did their best, and handled the
ball well, but the Branner quintet had
too great an advantage in weight.
Neisser, Branner forward, was eas
ily the star of the game, registering on
long shots time after time. Murata and
Mizota formed the scoring combina
tion for the Japanese Club and suc
ceeded in holding the total to a 6 to 6
tie in the first half.
Fast, smooth playing enabled the
Encina 2W team to trip Phi Gamma
Delta 14 to 8. The Fijis showed a lot
of fight in the first part of the game
but the tight five-man defense of the
babes was too much for them.
Rae, Harlow, Whitney, and Cass per
formed the bulk of the work for En
cina. Kirwan, Elliott, and Adams
played good games for the Fijis, but
showed clearly that they had not had
sufficient practice to work together.
Round II will start Monday with the
following games: Chinese Club vs.
Zeta Psi, 4:15; Sequoia II vs. Encina
IW, 4:50; Pirates vs. Chi Psi, 5:25;
Delta Chi vs. Sigma Nu, 7:15; Encina
IE vs. Panthers, 7:50; Phi Kappa Psi
vs. Los Arcos, 8:25.
