# CRITICISM OF POET BROWNING WRITTEN BY MRS. RUSSELL
## 
### 
"Browning, th Artist in Theory and
Practice," is the title of an article, by
Mrs. Frances Theresa Russell of the
English department, published in the
University of California Chronicle for
January 1925.
Browning's inconsistency in lauding
truth and then proceeding to feast 011
"the rare oases of vivid intensity" is
the point stressed by Mrs. Russell. But
when we discover theory and practice
"at variance or divorced, we linger to
inquire . . . ~" she says.
When Browning admits that ani
mating spirit of art is the artist's in
terpretation, he is more self-consistent,
according to Mrs. Russell. Poetry may
be a thing of beauty, but must be "a
criticism of life." And Browning, she
says, is aware of the part of beauty in
art, for there is beauty in his poems
while he is extolling truth.
Human life fascinated Browning,
Mrs. Russell holds, and he says that
"living itself is an art finer than any
artistic account of life."
