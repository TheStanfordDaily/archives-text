THE TRUTH ABOUT LIFE INSURANCE
The principal objection to the usual policy life insurance
and investment is that the annual accumulations, which provide the
"cash values," are forfeited in event of the premature death of the
insured, the face of the policy only being paid to the beneficiary.
Another serious objection is that if a policyholder withdraws his "cash
value," the insurance protection is immediately sacrificed as the policy
must be surrendered to the company for cancellation.
The Perfected Twenty Year Accumulation Policy, issued by the Guar
antee Fund Life Association of Omaha, overcomes both of these
objections.
It's simple, ask to see the policy and let me explain.
