# OXFORD DEBATE TEAM 10 SPEAK THURSDAY NIGHT
## SUBJECT IS PROHIBITION English Have Taken Negative Side in Debates Against American Colleges 
### 
Oxford University's debaters, gen
erally acknowledged as the best arguers
of the present day, will stop their world
tour long enough to Qppose Stanford
speakers on the question of prohibition
Thursday night.
The Englishmen, J. D. Woodruff, M.
C. Hollis, and Malcolm Mac Donald,
come about as close to being professional
debaters as it is possible for college stu
dents to become. They cast aside their
studies several weeks ago and started on
the most extensive trip ever undertaken
l>y a university forensic team. They are
defending the negative of the prohibition
question in all their engagements.
The Oxford men have spoken at many
of the more important colleges of the
United States, and in nearly every case
the debate has been decided by an audi
ence vote. Last Wednesday they spoke
at the University of Southern California.
It is reported that the decision of the
audience favored prohibition.
Meet California Tonight
Tonight they will be the guests of the
University of California at Berkeley, and
Tuesday they will speak over KLX in
Oakland. Wednesday they have a debate
scheduled with Mills College. After
meeting Stanford Thursday night. the
Oxford team will return to San Fran
cisco, where it will be entertained by
the Oxonian Club Friday night. On Sun
day the Britishers will sail for New
Zealand, continuing their trip around
the world.
' Owing to tjie fact that there is no pro
hibition in' England, and that the ma
jority of the people there drink to a
certain extent, the Oxford men have a
viewpoint on the question totally differ
ent from that which prevails in the
United States. In most of their debates
their attitude of mind has been so dif
ferent from that of the Americans that
there has been really no debate, but
merely six speeches.
According to Professor J. G. Emer
son, faculty debate advisor, the Stanford
team, composed of Stanley Weigel, Rob
ert Lewis, and Robert Littler, has been
striving to develop ideas that will con
nect with those of the Oxford invaders.
So in all probability the debate Thurs
day night will be of a real clash in which
each side will understand the beliefs of
the other and take steps to refute them,
which process will bring out a wealth of
the clever repartee and humor for which
the British debaters are famous.
