### Fred Speers 
"Since the war more attention has

and to the practical things than to the
study of pure science and the cultural
pursuits," said Professor Alexander
Findlay of the University of Edin
burgh, who is at present connected
with the faculty of the Chemistry de
partment here.
In response to a query as to his

more intently in American universi

Many Students Do Research
"On the other hand I have found as
many students in the chemistry depart
ment here at Stanford who are as
earnestly engaged in research work
for pure science as there are in any
other university whether on this side
of the Atlantic or on the other. And if
a country is to make progress in
