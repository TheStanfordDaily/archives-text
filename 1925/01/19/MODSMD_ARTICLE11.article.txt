# PURE SCIENCE HAS SETBACK
## War Accented Practical Values of Science, Says English Chemistry Professor 
### Fred Speers 
"Since the war more attention has
been paid to the aplication of science
and to the practical things than to the
study of pure science and the cultural
pursuits," said Professor Alexander
Findlay of the University of Edin
burgh, who is at present connected
with the faculty of the Chemistry de
partment here.
In response to a query as to his
opinion of the correctness of the views
| held by a certain English writer who
held that American students come to
college to distinguish themselves in
some line of extra-curiculum pursuit
I rather than for -the studies offered.
Professor Findlay stated that he found
America no different from any other
I country in this respect. "But,'' he add-

Ed, "students go into these pursuits
more intently in American universi
ties.
Many Students Do Research
"On the other hand I have found as
many students in the chemistry depart
ment here at Stanford who are as
earnestly engaged in research work
for pure science as there are in any
other university whether on this side
of the Atlantic or on the other. And if
a country is to make progress in
civilization a certain section of its
scientific men must be engaged in re
f
search work.
"Take Roentgen, for example, in dis
covering the X-rays; his work catnc
merely by study of pure science and add
ing bit by bit to the knowledge of clec
trical forces. But it was someone else
who made the practical applications of
his findings. And the same is true w r th
J. J. Thompson in his work with the
radio.
"If, as is frequently said, America pays
too much attention to the practical sides
of life, it is truly deplorable for Ameri
can science and advancement. I have not
yet had opportunity to observe the extent
of the division of interests.
Activities Important
"I think it is a very important thing
for college students to engage in athletic
and social activities, though they should
not take them too seriously. Anything
which expands the mental horizon is ex
cellent and worth while. In fact, at Aber
deen College in England we grant a half
holiday each week in order that the stu
dents may have an opportunity for out
door exercise."
Professor Findlay was educated at
Aberdeen College, receiving his M.A.
there in '95, and B.S. in '97. He later
studied under Professor Ostwald at
Leipzig. He has lectured on chemistry at
the College of London, University of
P>irmingham, and was a professor of
chemistry at the University of Wales,
Abcrystrewth, from 1911 to 1919. Since
1911 he has been a professor of chemistry
at the University of Edinburgh.
During 1901 and 1902 Professor Find
lay was engaged in research work under
Sir William Ramsay at the College of
London. Study of the combination of
nitrogen and hydrogen occupied their
time.

A volume of poems by students of
the University of Washington is now
on sale by the dramatic art depart
ment there. It. sells for $1.75. A volume
of plays was published last year.

search work.
"Take Roentgen, for example, in dis
covering the X-rays; his work catnc
merely by study of pure science and add
ing bit by bit to the knowledge of clec
trical forces. But it was someone else
who made the practical applications of
his findings. And the same is true w r th
J. J. Thompson in his work with the
radio.
"If, as is frequently said, America pays
too much attention to the practical sides
of life, it is truly deplorable for Ameri
can science and advancement. I have not
yet had opportunity to observe the extent
of the division of interests.
Activities Important
"I think it is a very important thing
for college students to engage in athletic
and social activities, though they should
not take them too seriously. Anything
which expands the mental horizon is ex
cellent and worth while. In fact, at Aber
deen College in England we grant a half
holiday each week in order that the stu
dents may have an opportunity for out
door exercise."
Professor Findlay was educated at
Aberdeen College, receiving his M.A.
there in '95, and B.S. in '97. He later
studied under Professor Ostwald at
Leipzig. He has lectured on chemistry at
the College of London, University of
P>irmingham, and was a professor of
chemistry at the University of Wales,
Abcrystrewth, from 1911 to 1919. Since
1911 he has been a professor of chemistry
at the University of Edinburgh.
During 1901 and 1902 Professor Find
lay was engaged in research work under
Sir William Ramsay at the College of
London. Study of the combination of
nitrogen and hydrogen occupied their
time.

"Since the war more attention has
been paid to the aplication of science
and to the practical things than to the
study of pure science and the cultural
pursuits," said Professor Alexander
Findlay of the University of Edin
burgh, who is at present connected
with the faculty of the Chemistry de
partment here.

opinion of the correctness of the views

held that American students come to

Professor Findlay stated that he found
America no different from any other
