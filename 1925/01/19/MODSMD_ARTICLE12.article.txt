"You and I," the clever, humorous,
and human comedy-drama by Philip
Bary, will be given January 30th by
one of the best casts, according to j
Gordon Davis, that has ever been
brought together on the Stanford Cam- j
pus. It will be that ideal combination,
wit, humor, and sentiment portrayed
by a first-class cast, which is rare but
not impossible.
Marjorie Allen, as Veronica Duane,
the "girl next door," will tempt Leon
ard Schwartz, a young architect, to j
the breaking point. The latter seems |
especially adapted, or fated, to soul- |
rending roles. First as the tortured
brother of "Dulcy," and now as that
most unhappy being—an artist in love
—he should be entirely faultless.
Former Stars in Cast
It is rather a far leap from a young
Robot girl experiencing the first throes
of love to the mother of a grown-up
son. But Virginia Graves does it, cap
ably. Alan Robertson, who had the
leading role in "R. U. R.," will uphold
the character of the father who "does
mural decorations beside the tele
phone."
Velma Randall, of "Dulcy" game, is a
liouse-mai<| with "social ambitions"
who acts as a model for Maitland
White. The resultant picture, "A Por
trait of a Lady," is sold to a mysteri
ous stranger, whereby hangs the sus
pense, as it were.
Lowell Mathay is the only untried
member of the cast. His selection is
another example of the fairness of
Gordon Davis' tryoutee system, and if
the director's choice is to be judged
by previous results Mathay should
scintillate.
Charles Parks, a veteran in campus
dramatics, will have another oppor
tunity to add newspaper clippings of
fame to his memory book, as Geoffrey
Nichols. In "Milestones" and "R. U. R."
be did excellent work which, to repeat
with slight variation what has already
been said, is another example of the
fact that a director can be appreciative
of ability.

"You and I," the clever, humorous,
and human comedy-drama by Philip
Bary, will be given January 30th by
one of the best casts, according to j
Gordon Davis, that has ever been
brought together on the Stanford Cam- j
pus. It will be that ideal combination,
wit, humor, and sentiment portrayed
by a first-class cast, which is rare but
not impossible.
Marjorie Allen, as Veronica Duane,
the "girl next door," will tempt Leon
ard Schwartz, a young architect, to j
the breaking point. The latter seems |
especially adapted, or fated, to soul- |
rending roles. First as the tortured
brother of "Dulcy," and now as that
most unhappy being—an artist in love
—he should be entirely faultless.
Former Stars in Cast
It is rather a far leap from a young
Robot girl experiencing the first throes
of love to the mother of a grown-up
son. But Virginia Graves does it, cap
ably. Alan Robertson, who had the
leading role in "R. U. R.," will uphold
the character of the father who "does
mural decorations beside the tele
phone."
Velma Randall, of "Dulcy" game, is a
liouse-mai<| with "social ambitions"
who acts as a model for Maitland
White. The resultant picture, "A Por
trait of a Lady," is sold to a mysteri
ous stranger, whereby hangs the sus
pense, as it were.
Lowell Mathay is the only untried
member of the cast. His selection is
another example of the fairness of
Gordon Davis' tryoutee system, and if
the director's choice is to be judged
by previous results Mathay should
scintillate.
Charles Parks, a veteran in campus
dramatics, will have another oppor
tunity to add newspaper clippings of
fame to his memory book, as Geoffrey
Nichols. In "Milestones" and "R. U. R."
be did excellent work which, to repeat
with slight variation what has already
been said, is another example of the
fact that a director can be appreciative
of ability.
