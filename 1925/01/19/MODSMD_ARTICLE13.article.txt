# ENCINA'S BASEMENT QUINTET WINS OVER BETA THETA PI 11-4
## 
### 
Beta Theta Pi, runner-up for the
intramural championship in 1924, lost
its first start of the season to the En
cina Basement five Friday by a de
cisive 11 to 4 margin. In the only
other game played Sigma Chi bowled
over Delta Kappa Epsilon 13 to 8.
With Dave Mannoccir as the only
veteran remaining from last year the
Betas tried to make up in beef what
they lacked in speed and co-ordination,
but they were no match for the light,
fast sfiuad of freshmen. Mannoccir
played a good game but his teammates
did not seem to be able to woi'k with
him.
Netter, running guard for Encina,
together with Bryan and Cook, for
wards, formed a smooth scoring com
bination, Cook being high point man
with five points. The babes went
strong in the first half, rolling up
nine tallies and holding the Betas
scocreless, but let up a little in the
second period, wjien Netter was the
only one to sink a basket.
Sigma Chi Stages Comeback
A fast finish won for Sigma Chi over
Delta Kappa Epsilon in a hotly-con
tested battle. Both teams were up on
their toes every minute and Sigma
Chi triumphed because of more ac
curate goal shooting and greater en
durance. The Dekes had a goodly num
ber of shots at the basket, but could
not come through with anything like
consistency.
D. K. E. started well and amassed
a 5 to 2 lead during the first half,
thanks mainly to the work of Jimmie
Adams. Sigma Chi found the range late
in the game, and managed to elude
the Deke defense, which was getting
winded. Urner poured in goals in
flocks. Lundborg went well at guard
for Sigma Chi.

their toes every minute and Sigma
Chi triumphed because of more ac
curate goal shooting and greater en
durance. The Dekes had a goodly num
ber of shots at the basket, but could
not come through with anything like
consistency.
D. K. E. started well and amassed
a 5 to 2 lead during the first half,
thanks mainly to the work of Jimmie
Adams. Sigma Chi found the range late
in the game, and managed to elude
the Deke defense, which was getting
winded. Urner poured in goals in
flocks. Lundborg went well at guard
for Sigma Chi.
