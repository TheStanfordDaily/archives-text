# CARDS WINNERS IN LOS ANGELES BASKET SERIES
## ERNIE NEVERS IS STAR Stanford Wins 21 to 13 Over Sage-Hens; Branch Five Defeated 23 to 17 
### 
Stanford varsity basketballers kept
the seasonal slate of victories clean
last Friday and Saturday nights when
they defeated the Pomona quintet 21
to 13, and the Southern Branch quintet
23 to 17.
Ernie Nevers was the star of both
contests and came through with
enough baskets in both games to keep
the Cardinals out of convincingly hot
water.
The Pomona team kept the advan
tage during the first half, but field
goals by Nevers soon gave the Cards
a lead which the sage-hens were un
able to overcome.
The Southern Branch game was the
hardest-fought of the two, the Branch
quintet leading for approximately ten
minutes of the game with a six-point
lead. The Stanford team found it hard
at first to penetrate the five-man de
fense offered by the Los Angeles five,
but once Nevers and Shipkey were
put in the line-up Stanford gradually
overcame the lead, and with a strong
last five-minute spurt, outdistanced
the home team.
Stanford managed to lead the first
half 13 to 12.'
Nevers, and Ted Shipkey were
the most formidable of the Cards' de
fense and offense, but Fred Price was
high point man in the Branch game
with seven points. Oliva and Nevers
both scored four points, and the Ship
key brothers scored three each.
These two victories against fairly
tough opposition give the Stanford
team the necessary impetus to con
tinue undefeated the rest of the sea
son. The Olympic Club game looms up
as the real test of the season. The
Winged "O" men were able to defeat
California at the first game, but this
was in early season and is hardly an
indication.
