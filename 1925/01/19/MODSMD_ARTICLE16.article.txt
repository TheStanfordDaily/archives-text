# PHYSICS DEPARTMENT TO GET X-RAY FROM WESTINGHOUSE FIRM
## 
### 
A new X-ray tube with a maximum
voltage of 300,000 volts and a capacity
of five watts will be given to the Physics
department through the courtesy of the
Westinghouse Electric Company, .ac
cording to Dr. P. A. Ross.
The new tube, which is now in the
process of construction, is of special
structure and will contain an uranium
target. Manufactured by the Westing
house company at a cost amounting to
some thousands of dollars, the tube is
such as could not be obtained on the
public market, and hence will be of great
valuei in aiding the department in their
research work. At present a tube manu
factured by the General Electric is being
used.
Incidentally the gift is in the nature of
recognition of the work of the Physics
department in investigating the X-ray
and will be the means of conducting their
work to a further extent.
