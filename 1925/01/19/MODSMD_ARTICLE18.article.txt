# Many Happy Returns
## 
### 
Today—January 19—is the birthday of David Starr Jordan, one of
the men who has done most for Stanford. It is celebrated, a trifle
prematurely, by the award of a $25,000 prize for the best and most
workable plan for attaining world peace. So Dr. Jordan, retired from
active participation in University affairs, is continuing his policy of
contributing to the betterment of the world.
Giving such a sum of money to Dr. Jordan is not properly giving it
to Dr. Jordan at all. In some form or other it will be used to the
benefit of somebody else, for Dr. Jordan does things that way. In the
earlier history of Stanford he continually refused offers that seemed, on
the surface, better; because here in the undeveloped West he saw an
opportunity to make of young Stanford University the educational and
scientific power which it is today. Stanford is a great thing for the
West, and through some difficult struggles Dr. Jordan was, practically,
Stanford.
A better man could hardly have been found for the development of the
University. At that time the enrollment was so small that the President
was a very close influence over the student body. Dr. Jordan's per
sonality is as appealing and powerful as his writings, and one of the
strongest undergraduate memories was of the President playing on the
Faculty baseball team which annually tangled with the varsity.
A Stanford man of the day says that two-thirds of what he got out
of college came from Dr. Jordan and Herbert Hoover, and there are
many more who were influenced nearly as much. His life has been
spent largely in the service of others, to the neglect of his personal gain.
Dr. Jordan is still beloved and appreciated by this later generation of
students, who unite in wishing him long-continued happiness.'
