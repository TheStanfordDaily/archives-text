# New Members
## 
### 
Five men and five women were added to the Daily staff at the close
of the winter tryout, which extended over last week. The new reporters
are as promising an accumulation as has been seen in some time, and
the management congratulates them upon their success.
The chosen ones stood out from the other tryoutees on the grounds
of superior initiative in searching out news, or higher quality of copy.
In case of a near-tie in quality the choice went to the most energetic of
the two â€”which is a good copy-book maxim. The aspirants were con
demned to hand in stories on a wide variety of subjects, and versatility
was considered to some extent. The winning numbers will start from
scratch with the older reporters, and seniority will give way to ability
if proven.
The successful tryoutees, in alphabetical order, are: C. A. Behle,
Aileene Brown, Elizabeth Clark, Eleanor Davidson, E. .M. Draper,
Florence Gallagher, Ida Railey, M. J. Sears, J. W. Shoup, and M. F.
Somerville. Miss Velva Darling was also made a member of the staff,
after a quarter of special writing for the Daily.
New members will meet upstairs in the Press Building at 12:50
tomorrow for congratulations and instructions. All of them must be
present. Those who missed the boat are reminded that there will be
another tryout later, and that several of the above are "repeaters."

THE DAYS of the Palo Alto tree are numbered, says Professor
Pierce. Another Stanford tradition succumbs to modernity.

FOLLOWING A suggestion made last week in this column, an intra
mural basketeer rang one up on the wrong register. We thank you!
