# "LIFE IS LIKE GREAT RIVER WITH SOURCE UNKNOWN"â€”SPERRY
## 
### 
Comparing life to a great river, its
source unknown and its mouth unknown,
the Rev. W. L. Perry spoke in the
Memorial Church yesterday morning.
According to Dr. Perry, a man reaches
a desire such as impelled Livingston,
when he stands on the brink of his own
life in early manhood and wonders
where the great stream comes from and
where it goes. The men interested in
science and education are the seekers
after rivers of life.
"The best way to do," declared Dr.
Perry, "is to get as near the source of
the river of life as is possible. In its
early stages it flows through forboding
country filled with a savage and primi
tive people. If we remove the artificial
restraints of morality we fiend tliat man
cannot get away from his inheritance.
We arc rather hard put to defend ideals
like the Christian when we see the things
behind us.
"But we must face the facts. The
Christian religion does not deny anyone
the full and free right as a thinker to
find dut about human origins. Christians
who arc afraid of truth have no place
in true Christian religion. Religion has
got to coincide with science. No matter
liow far back we go we always find
something beyond our knowledge, there
is always a mystery."
