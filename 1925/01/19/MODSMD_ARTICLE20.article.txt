Jn the case of this picture we would
heartily recommend that it be headed
"PRISCILLA Dean, Priscilla DEAN,
with the sub-stitle "A Triumph of
Nordic Love." If you like Priscilla Dean,
you will like this movie; and if you don't
like her as a rule, you may at any rate.
Of all the numerous actresses whom we
have seen at odd times in our career we
do not remember one who can play the
part of the so well, and there is
assuredly not one who can do so and
yet remain so beautiful.
By a cruel twist of our mind we liked,
as we do so often, the villain far better
than our noble, strong hero. In the bat
ter's ease we should say that strength
consists in being physically unable to sec

more than one way. His life history
might perhaps be summed up as follows:
Once upon a time there was a little hoy
and he would play with other little lads,
whether black, brown, or white. But
when he became a man, he refused to
play any longer. And this bar precluded
marrying a charming girl, who hap
pened to be an Arab. But it's all right,
friends, in the last five minutes of the
picture he discovers that she is of Nordic
blood.
The story, being a melodrama, becomes
a times strangely fantastic. There is the
little girl taken by a strange people and
brought up in ignorance of her nation
ality. But in the last act she learns the
truth and is able to marry the aforesaid
strong hero. That is all according to
Hoylc, but we wondered why the hero
retained in his possession a paper which
seemed to require a hurried delivery. We
forget, however, that this is needed more
urgently to make three reels of film at

least half-way plausible. Arab ladies,
also, seem to be wearing no veils this
year.
All that is but a mere detail, and we
are sure you will enjoy seeing Priscilla
Dean.
