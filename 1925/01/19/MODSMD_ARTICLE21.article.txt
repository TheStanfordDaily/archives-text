## HOBBIES OF THE GREAT 
### Hal 
Dave Damsoon
"More than anything else in the
wide, wide world," said the great
Damsoon, his blue eyes sparkling, "I
would rather play nuirbles. Not for
keeps, of course, but just plain mar
bles.
"Many times old Arch Buncombe
and I sit up here in the old Mesquite
office and play Boston Big Ring until
late at night, late enough so that we
get lockouts.
"Of course this lacks some of the
wild freedom that marked the Mes
quite 'get-togethers' in the old days,
but then the play really tends to build
a man up instead of tearing him down.
I find my nerves improving remarkably
by th development of accuracy in
shooting."
"What is your favorite taw, Mr.
Damsoon," we inquired breathlessly.
"The,red agate," replied the noted
humorist with conviction. "Take my
word for it, there is nothing at all in
this talk about green immys. Nothing
ruins a man's marbles so quickly as
the promiscuous use of the green
immy,"
"We are glad, Mr. Damsoon," we
cried fervently, "that such a man as
you, a truly finished marble-player,
has had the courage to make such a
statement. It will probably revolution
ize the game."
"Oh, not at all, not at all," the great
man blushed, "come around sometime
and I'll tell you my theory on the use
of peaks'."
