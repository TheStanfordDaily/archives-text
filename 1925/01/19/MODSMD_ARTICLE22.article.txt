# Grounds Around Branner Hall to Be Planted Soon
## 
### 
Plans are under way for planting
shrubs and trees around Branner Hall.
The ground has been leveled off and
staked. Several new gravel walks have
been laid, and trees will be planted early
in the spring. Planting of these trees
will remove a long noticed lack of green
ery around the two new halls. Not only
the space in front of Branner, but also
the small court between the dormitory
and dining hall and the space between
Toyon and Branner will be planted with
shrubs.
