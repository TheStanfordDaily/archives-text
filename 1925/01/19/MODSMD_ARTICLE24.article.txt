University, conceived under the auspices of the "You and I" management,
are as follows:
(1) The first correct answer to the puzzle will merit the sender the
choice of ANY four seats to the Masquers Play, "You and I," to be presented
in the Assembly hall on January 30. The second correct answer will give the
sender the choice of any other two seats to the play, after the first-place winner
has selected his or her seats.
(2) The winner and his party, and the second-place winner will be
admitted to the cast dance following the play, free of all monetary encum
brance.

Campus, who will number the answers in order of time mailed and the winners
will be determined and notified the coming week-end. All are eligible except
Dramatic Manager tryoutees, members of the Dramatic Council, and members
