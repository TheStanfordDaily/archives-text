# FREE THROW CONTEST AT ENCINA GYM TO BE HELD THIS WEEK
## 
### 
Intramural basketball artists will have
I an opportunity to test their skill in the
j basketball free throw contest, which will
j be held Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thurs
day of this week in the Encina gym.
Though likely to prove of especial in
terest to players on intramural teams,
the contest will be open to all under
graduate men.
In a similar contest held last year there
were 187 entries, and each man was al
lowed fifteen tries. This season con
testants will be permitted to take twenty
five shots at the basket. The winner
will have his name and living group en
graved on a placque which is on exhibi
tion in the Trophy room. Rodney George
of Encina was victor in 1924.
According to C. W. Davis, the number
of free throws converted into goals in
intramural games is very small. During
the first week of the present series only
81 out of a possible 254 foul goals were
made good, an average of 32.3 per cent.
Davis believes that this percentage can
be greatly improved, and the standard of
play proportionately raised, if partici
pants on the teams will devote a little
additional time to practice.
Tennis Starts Tomorrow
Davis also announces that play in the
intramural doubles tennis tournament
will start tomorrow. He is conducting
this competition under a new system. In
stead of leaving to the contestants the
responsibility of arranging their own
times for pltfying off matches he will
post in the gym tomorrow definite start
ing times, including day and hour, and
will designate the court on which games
shall be played.
In this way he hopes to eliminate a
great deal of the delay which is usually
incidental to a tournament of this kind.
All players who find it impossible to meet
their opponents at the time posted are
asked to see Davis immediately, as all
first-round matches must be finished be
fore the end of the week.
Entries for the intramural handball
tournament which will be played on the
four-wall courts in Palo Alto close at 6
p. m. today. Play will start tomorrow.
Men who make the best showing in this
tournament will be picked for the varsity
handball team which will meet Cali
fornia March 6. The regulation circle
"S" of second-class minor sports will
be awarded players who win at that time.
