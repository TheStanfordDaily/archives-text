# Religion as End of Road Is Subject of Dr. Sperry's Talk
## 
### 
"The great peril of American ciziliza
tion is that we do not associate ourselves
witli anything we have no use for," de
clared the Rev. William Learoyd Sperry
of Cambridge, Mass., in his talk at the
vesper services yesterday afternoon.
"We must think of religion as being
the end of the road," he pointed out. "It
is like the inn of which Chesterton
speaks in his criticism of Dickens, the
inn to which all roads point, not it to
the roads. For there are certain things
like art,, like a good friend, which hold
the utmost satisfaction, but are of en
joyment, not of use. They are ends in
themselves. The true thing that 'Main
Street' pointed out, however, is that
though we Americans live fast, faster
thany anyone else, we have no end in
view. Everything with us points on.
But to live on and on like the Wander
ing Jew is hell, not heaven. 1 agree with
the Easterner, who values the end."
The musical program was given by
Martin D*Andrea, who sang "Panis
Angelicus," by Cesar Franck, accom
panied by Chester Blackman, pianist, and
Elizabeth Peirce, violinist, and "My
Task," by Ashford. A poem from Made
leine Bridges was read by Norma
Wright, who conducted the services.

Piano music for the service was fur
nished by Marion Toll.
