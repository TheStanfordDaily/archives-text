# SPORTS OF 1925
## That Bushocker Deal 
### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Who got the better of the December trade between the St. Louis Browns and
the New York Yankees? Who will win the famous Bushocker argument?
Time alone will tell; at present it appears to be a cross-word puzzle involving
two three-letter words —Joe and Urb. If it were merely an out and out trade —
Bush for Shocker —nearly all fans would agree that the Yankees got the better
of the bargain. Miller Huggins, however, perhaps in his eagerness to do his
Christmas swapping early, kindly threw in Pitchers Milton Gaston and Joe
Giard, which certainly seems to swing the scales in favor of St. Louis.
Manager Sißler is sure that Gaston has the makings of a fine pitcher, while
Giard is a southpaw who has been with Toledo of the American Association.
Of course, both the youngsters may prove flops and be quite useless to the
Browns, but it is safe to say that Sisler will get some good out of at least
one of them.
Now as to the two veterans, Joe and Urb, both are about alike as far as age
and service go. From a New York viewpoint, everything is fine, for have not
the Yanks removed their nemesis, Shocker, from the ranks of the opposition?
Quite true, but look what the Browns have done: acquired a pitcher who beat
them seventeen times in succession in three years! Then too, Bullet Joe is
a fighter, a reliable pinch hitter, and surely has a lot of victories left in that
old right arm of his.
Shocker, however, should win more games than Bush in 1925. He is an
iron-man too, and I well remember seeing him beat the White Sox twice in
one afternoon last summer in Chicago. The husky spit-baller, in new sur
roundings, should do better than ever. As one writer put it, "The lost lamb
returns to the fold a seasoned mutton."
