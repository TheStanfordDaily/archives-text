# CLIFF IRELAND TEAM WINS OVER CARDS 7-5
## 
### 
Marty Griffin's? homer in the third
| inning added the three fatal runs to
! Cliff Ireland's total and defeated the
' Cardinal nine on the varsity field last
j Saturday, leaving the final score 7 to 5.
A few too many walks handed out
by Jim Aydelotte, who did the mound
work for the varsity, filled the bases
twice and in the third stanza Griffin
took advantage of the opportunity.
Griffin saw the bases full and went
into the box with the determination
to pull a "Babe Ruth" on the crowd
and bring home a few runs. Aydelotte
saved him some trouble when he let
one man score on a passed ball.
Collins Takes Box
After this donation Harry Wolter
decided that perhaps Steve Collins
could ward off a few runs. Steve went
to the box but, on the second ball he
threw, Griffin realized his fondest hopes
by driving the ball somewhere out in
the great open space beyond the left
field wall.
After this little incident Collins went
pretty well and allowed the visitors
only one more hit and no runs. In the
six remaining innings he chalked up
a total of nine strikeouts. For an in
experienced pitcher he shows great
promise.
Ireland Shows Hope
Cliff Ireland's style of playing has
improved considerably and with plenty
of practice he should prove good base
ball material. On the whole he is a
very likely-looking prospect. He caught
a slow short fly and made an assist
to first base.
The first Irish score came in the
second inning when Aydelotte filled
the bases on walks and then threw
one that Hal King couldn't stop. He
managed to shut down on them but
in the next frame he was forced to
the showers. Collins replaced him.
Three Men Score
In the fourth inning Stewart and
Kohler started off with a pair of
singles and Collins walked, filling the
■ises. "Shorty" Roberts grounded the
all to third and forced Kohler. Stew
art scored. Mulchay's single" sent Col
lins home and Roberts crossed home
plate when seven of Cliff Ireland's
nine lined up between first and second
vry ng to tag Mulchay who had started
'■«ast first.
"Chuck" Johnston crossed the plate
"or another tally in the fifth frame and
did likewise in the eighth after
i walk. Other than these there was
n entire absence of hits or runs.
Johnston Makes Two Hits
Captain Johnston made two hits out
>free times at bat and in the field
e held down first base in great shape.
THs arm is very weak and hinders his
-it grring ability.
This game gave a good line on
TTarry Wolter's material and showed
tl'at the backstop is really the only
weak position. Hal King, who went
n first at this position, failed to make
rv al important stops that meant
nns for the visitors. Johnny Kohler
went in with Steve Collins and worked
nt a little better.
Unexpected events have left this
Position holding the well-known bur
'an. Both Johnston and Lawson, who
t ok turns behind the plate last year,

are out of the game for a while on
account of bad arms. Johnston has
been able to take over first base be
cause his peg at that position is not
necessary, and what little he does
miss is made up in his batting amility.

Captain Johnston made two hits out
>free times at bat and in the field
e held down first base in great shape.
THs arm is very weak and hinders his
-it grring ability.
This game gave a good line on
TTarry Wolter's material and showed
tl'at the backstop is really the only
weak position. Hal King, who went
n first at this position, failed to make
rv al important stops that meant
nns for the visitors. Johnny Kohler
went in with Steve Collins and worked
nt a little better.
Unexpected events have left this
Position holding the well-known bur
'an. Both Johnston and Lawson, who
t ok turns behind the plate last year,

are out of the game for a while on
account of bad arms. Johnston has
been able to take over first base be
cause his peg at that position is not
necessary, and what little he does
miss is made up in his batting amility.
Marty Griffin's? homer in the third
| inning added the three fatal runs to
! Cliff Ireland's total and defeated the
' Cardinal nine on the varsity field last
j Saturday, leaving the final score 7 to 5.
A few too many walks handed out
by Jim Aydelotte, who did the mound
work for the varsity, filled the bases
twice and in the third stanza Griffin
took advantage of the opportunity.
Griffin saw the bases full and went
into the box with the determination
to pull a "Babe Ruth" on the crowd
and bring home a few runs. Aydelotte
saved him some trouble when he let
one man score on a passed ball.
Collins Takes Box
After this donation Harry Wolter
decided that perhaps Steve Collins
could ward off a few runs. Steve went
to the box but, on the second ball he
threw, Griffin realized his fondest hopes
by driving the ball somewhere out in
the great open space beyond the left
field wall.
After this little incident Collins went
pretty well and allowed the visitors
only one more hit and no runs. In the
six remaining innings he chalked up
a total of nine strikeouts. For an in
experienced pitcher he shows great
promise.
Ireland Shows Hope
Cliff Ireland's style of playing has
improved considerably and with plenty
of practice he should prove good base
ball material. On the whole he is a
very likely-looking prospect. He caught
a slow short fly and made an assist
to first base.
The first Irish score came in the
second inning when Aydelotte filled
the bases on walks and then threw
one that Hal King couldn't stop. He
managed to shut down on them but
in the next frame he was forced to
the showers. Collins replaced him.
Three Men Score
In the fourth inning Stewart and
Kohler started off with a pair of
singles and Collins walked, filling the
■ises. "Shorty" Roberts grounded the
all to third and forced Kohler. Stew
art scored. Mulchay's single" sent Col
lins home and Roberts crossed home
plate when seven of Cliff Ireland's
nine lined up between first and second
vry ng to tag Mulchay who had started
'■«ast first.
"Chuck" Johnston crossed the plate
"or another tally in the fifth frame and
did likewise in the eighth after
i walk. Other than these there was
n entire absence of hits or runs.
