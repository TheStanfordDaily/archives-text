# CLIFF IRELAND TEAM WINS OVER CARDS 7-5
## 
### 
Marty Griffin's? homer in the third
| inning added the three fatal runs to
! Cliff Ireland's total and defeated the
' Cardinal nine on the varsity field last
j Saturday, leaving the final score 7 to 5.
A few too many walks handed out
by Jim Aydelotte, who did the mound
work for the varsity, filled the bases
twice and in the third stanza Griffin
took advantage of the opportunity.
Griffin saw the bases full and went
into the box with the determination
to pull a "Babe Ruth" on the crowd
and bring home a few runs. Aydelotte
saved him some trouble when he let
one man score on a passed ball.
Collins Takes Box
After this donation Harry Wolter
decided that perhaps Steve Collins
could ward off a few runs. Steve went
to the box but, on the second ball he
threw, Griffin realized his fondest hopes
by driving the ball somewhere out in
the great open space beyond the left
field wall.
After this little incident Collins went
pretty well and allowed the visitors
only one more hit and no runs. In the
six remaining innings he chalked up
a total of nine strikeouts. For an in
experienced pitcher he shows great
promise.
Ireland Shows Hope
Cliff Ireland's style of playing has
improved considerably and with plenty
of practice he should prove good base
