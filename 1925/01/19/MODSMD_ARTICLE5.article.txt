# PALO ALTO QUINTET DEFEATS STANFORD LIGHTWEIGHT TEAM
## 
### 
Ragged passing and a scarcity of
teamwork brought defeat to the Stan
ford 130-pound quintet Saturday night
at the Pavilion when the Palo Alto 130's
took them down the line with a 17-12
score. A stout defense by Paol Alto
kept the Cardinal lightweights from
much scoring during the time that they
were not defending their own basket.
Both teams went slow in the first half,
which ended with Paly leading, 6-4. In
the second frame the game livened up
when Hall scored and tied the score.
Palo Alto came to the front with three
field goals in as many minutes and kept
the lead until the end. Coach Davis
hustled in the first line-up which had
been relieve dat the end of the first quar
ter by substitutes, but in their eagerness
to run up the score they committed
enough fouls to allow the high school
lightweights to gather the five winning
points.
Hobro and Meyers did the best work
for Stanford, but were not up to their
usual standard. Both accounted for four
points each. For the high school team
McLarklan was a power on the defense
besides sinking some nice shots from the
center of the floor. Ethen and Schutte
also did some commendable playing.
The Stanford team experienced diffi
culty in adhering themselves to the ball,
but had a little hard luck in their basket
shooting.
The summary follows:
Stanford (12) Palo Alto (17)
Meyers (4) F Payson (3)
Hobro (4) F Grey
Lee C Klotz (6)
Geary G McDowell
Brockway (2) G McLacklen (4)
Substitutes: Stanford, Little, Suffern.
Gandy, Jensen, Hall (2), Morrison,
Bushnell, Miron, Sano. Palo Alto,
Nourse (2), Schutte (2), Varsons, How
ards, Ethen, Targus.
