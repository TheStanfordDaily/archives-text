### 
Announcement of the presentation of
a trophy for the intramural basketball
competition by the Hastings Clothing
Company of San Francisco has been
made by the Accommodation department
of that business house. The trophy, a
twelve-inch silver basketball, is now on
display at the Union.
This award will pass into the perma
nent possession of the team which first
wins it twice, not necessarily consecu
tively. The names of the winners each
year will be engraved on the award.
Last year the intramural scries was
won by the Delta Tau Delta quintet,
which received for its efforts a pennant
for winning the scries and a placque for
winning its league game. Beta Theta Pi
was runner-up. Interest in intramural
basketball has hern increasing by leaps
and bounds, and this year forty-eight
teams, more than ever, are engaged in
the competition.
