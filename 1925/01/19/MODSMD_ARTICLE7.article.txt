! ANLY those who have grown up with Stanford University and who saw
Dr. David Starr Jordan begin his great work in California can fully
appreciate the significance of his services to the University, to education,
and to the West. As the leader of a new educational enterprise, which had
an unusual amount of publicity because of the great gift of the Stanfords, he
J had not only a free hand in the choice of his faculty and of his policies, but
also a virgin lield in which to work. Higher education in the West was just
beginning. The University of California was still reasonably small and had
not as yet felt the impulse of growth which has been so significant in its
history in recent years.
Dr. Jordan's advanced position in science and as an investigator and his
unique ability in presenting facts to public audiences in a simple way at
once gave him a position of leadership. He was very generous in his
willingness to appear in all parts of the West, before all kinds of audiences.
In this way his public services were as great as his direct services in education.
Stanford University has now become an impersonalized institution. In the
active period of Dr. Jordan's administration he had the closest intimate rela
tions to the founders and for many years his dealings with the surviving
founder, Mrs. Stanford, paralleled those of the ordinary university president
with the Board of Trustees. This personal contact came at a period of great
strain for the University. The suit brought against the Stanford estate which,
if it had been lost, would have cost a very large part of the endowment of
the institution, was the greatest obstacle of all. Dr. Jordan's greatest service
to education was in holding the Stanford Trust together in accordance with
its original purposes through not only the suit but a series of other incidents
that threatened the practical annihilation of the University. Only a man
of great patience, tolerance, enthusiasms and fine spirit could have succeeded
in this particularly difficult and trying task.
In "The Days of a Man" Dr. Jordan has given a picture of a world figure
interested in all phases of human endeavor and activity. In spite of
administrative responsibilities, through the help of such admirable lieutenants
as John Casper Branner and John Maxson Stillman, he was enabled to travel
to all parts of the world as a scientist collecting fish and other specimens
and as a publicist interested in world peace.
Everyone is delighted that his seventy-fourth birthday finds him well and
hearty and receiving the recognition which is his due. The Peace Award of
$25,000 comes to him after years of endeavor in a field that was often
unpopular.
With all of the other students who came to the University in the early
days I must express the gratitude that we owe David Starr Jordan for the
serviceable ideals which he brought to Stanford University and made a part
of its life from the very beginning. While we honor his work as a scientist
and respect his great achievements as a world figure our affection goes out
most to the man who was the leader of that group of young men and young
women who came filled with the pioneer spirit to help build up a great
University on the Stanford Farm.
