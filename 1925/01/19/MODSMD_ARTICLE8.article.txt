# FRESHMAN FIVE TAKES 29-10 GAME FROM SACRAMENTO
## Faculty Slices Many From Line-up of Babe Squad Just Before Game 
### 
With all but six of the former squad
said to be ineligible, the Stanford fresh
men fought the Sacramento High School
quintet to a 29 to 10 victory. I'or the last
three minutes of the game the babes
played with only four men in the lineup.
At the beginning of the game "Husky"
Hunt found that only Clif Moore, Vin
centi, Clark, Dennis, Nye, and Reynolds,
from his old squad, were eligible and
able to play. He also had "Windy" Big
elow, who has just entered this quarter,
and Snyde, who was out for the first
time. ..
The first big difficulty of the small
squad came in the last few moments
of the game, when after all the substi
tutes had been taken out, Bigelow com
mitted his fourth personal foul and had
to retire to the bench. This left only
four men to continue the game.
Four Man Team Scores
This combination not only kep the high
school lads from scoring, but succeeded
in adding three points.
Considerable misunderstanding over
the interpretation of the eligibility rules
has finally lead to seventeen men being
dropped from the squad. This number
includes many of the former first-string
men.
Despite these handicaps, the babes
played one of the best games of the sca
son and showed great improvement. The
entire team has developed its ability in
passing and general handling of the ball.
Moore High Point Man
Cliff Moore, at forward, was high point
man, adding eleven tallies. Dennis was
nc'xt with eight. Throughout the game
these two were the leaders in the offense
and both Clark and Vincenti backed tlicm
up well.
Moore started the scoring by ringing
the hoop from the side. Captain Mc-
Kenna of Sacramento sank one; Rooney
gave the Solons the lead by adding an
other basket. Fighting back and forth
put the ball first in one end of the floor
and then the other without either side
being able to take a shot. The quarter
ended, 4 to 2, in favor of Sacramento.
Start With Speed
The freshmen started the second quar
ter with a great burst of speed and al
most immediately built the score up to
10 to 4 in their favor. Clark started
by making a perfect shot from the mid
dle of the floor. Moore was next when
he dropped one from under the basket
on a pass from Vincenti. Moore caught
the next tip off, dribbled down, and shot
another. On the following tip off Sac
ramento dropped back for five-man de
fense and to save timevßill Clark made
another from past the middle of the
floor.
Three Subs Go In
Hunt then sent in his three substitutes.
Nye replaced Vincenti, Snyde for Moore,
and Reynolds for Bigelow. With these
men in, the game slowed up a bit, but
Clark converted a foul and Nye shot one
coming in fast from the side. Just as
the gun ended the half Rooney added
two points for Sacramento on a long
shot.
The three substitutes started the sec
ond half and played around for four
minutes, then Snyde and Dennis each
dropped one, adding four points. Just
as they started to work well together,
Hunt sent his first team in and took out
his three substitutes. Both Vincenti and
Moore scored baskets without hesitation
and the quarter ended, 21 to 6.
Denis Tries Hard
Dennis seemed to have his hands on
the ball all during the last period. At
one time he took six shots in a row, as
fast as he could throw the ball and
catch it again, and on the sixth shot the
ball rolled around the basket and finally
fell through. Just to show he could sink
one on the first try, Dennis tipped off
the ball, caught it, dribbled down, and
slipped it through.
Baxter of Sacramento started a short
rally when he converted two fouls, and
came back again sinking one from the
side. It was just at this time that
"Windy" Bigelow went to the bench on
a four-foul count and the four first
string men continued the game. They
added three points, leaving the final
score: Stanford 29, Sacramento 10.
The lineup was:
Stanford Sacramento
C.Moore (11) F Rooney (4)
Vincenti (2) F Howe
Dennis (8) C Minike
Clark (6) G McKenna (2)

Substitutes: Stanford. Nye for Moore:

three minutes of the game the babes
played with only four men in the lineup.
At the beginning of the game "Husky"
Hunt found that only Clif Moore, Vin
centi, Clark, Dennis, Nye, and Reynolds,
from his old squad, were eligible and
able to play. He also had "Windy" Big
elow, who has just entered this quarter,
and Snyde, who was out for the first
time. ..
The first big difficulty of the small
squad came in the last few moments
of the game, when after all the substi
tutes had been taken out, Bigelow com
mitted his fourth personal foul and had
to retire to the bench. This left only
four men to continue the game.
Four Man Team Scores
This combination not only kep the high
school lads from scoring, but succeeded
in adding three points.
Considerable misunderstanding over
the interpretation of the eligibility rules
has finally lead to seventeen men being
dropped from the squad. This number
includes many of the former first-string
men.
Despite these handicaps, the babes
played one of the best games of the sca
son and showed great improvement. The
entire team has developed its ability in
passing and general handling of the ball.
Moore High Point Man
Cliff Moore, at forward, was high point
man, adding eleven tallies. Dennis was
nc'xt with eight. Throughout the game
these two were the leaders in the offense
and both Clark and Vincenti backed tlicm
up well.
Moore started the scoring by ringing
the hoop from the side. Captain Mc-
Kenna of Sacramento sank one; Rooney
gave the Solons the lead by adding an
other basket. Fighting back and forth
put the ball first in one end of the floor
and then the other without either side
being able to take a shot. The quarter
ended, 4 to 2, in favor of Sacramento.
Start With Speed
The freshmen started the second quar
ter with a great burst of speed and al
most immediately built the score up to
10 to 4 in their favor. Clark started
by making a perfect shot from the mid
dle of the floor. Moore was next when
he dropped one from under the basket
on a pass from Vincenti. Moore caught
the next tip off, dribbled down, and shot
another. On the following tip off Sac
ramento dropped back for five-man de
fense and to save timevßill Clark made
another from past the middle of the
floor.
Three Subs Go In
Hunt then sent in his three substitutes.
Nye replaced Vincenti, Snyde for Moore,
and Reynolds for Bigelow. With these
men in, the game slowed up a bit, but
Clark converted a foul and Nye shot one
coming in fast from the side. Just as
the gun ended the half Rooney added
two points for Sacramento on a long
shot.
The three substitutes started the sec
ond half and played around for four
minutes, then Snyde and Dennis each
dropped one, adding four points. Just
as they started to work well together,
Hunt sent his first team in and took out
his three substitutes. Both Vincenti and
Moore scored baskets without hesitation
and the quarter ended, 21 to 6.
Denis Tries Hard
Dennis seemed to have his hands on
the ball all during the last period. At
one time he took six shots in a row, as
fast as he could throw the ball and
catch it again, and on the sixth shot the
ball rolled around the basket and finally
fell through. Just to show he could sink
one on the first try, Dennis tipped off
the ball, caught it, dribbled down, and
slipped it through.
Baxter of Sacramento started a short
rally when he converted two fouls, and
came back again sinking one from the
side. It was just at this time that
"Windy" Bigelow went to the bench on
a four-foul count and the four first
string men continued the game. They
added three points, leaving the final
score: Stanford 29, Sacramento 10.
The lineup was:
Stanford Sacramento
C.Moore (11) F Rooney (4)

Clark (6) G McKenna (2)

Substitutes: Stanford. Nye for Moore:

from his old squad, were eligible and
able to play. He also had "Windy" Big
elow, who has just entered this quarter,
and Snyde, who was out for the first
time. ..
The first big difficulty of the small
squad came in the last few moments
of the game, when after all the substi
tutes had been taken out, Bigelow com
mitted his fourth personal foul and had
to retire to the bench. This left only
four men to continue the game.
Four Man Team Scores
This combination not only kep the high
school lads from scoring, but succeeded
in adding three points.
Considerable misunderstanding over
the interpretation of the eligibility rules
has finally lead to seventeen men being
dropped from the squad. This number
includes many of the former first-string
men.
Despite these handicaps, the babes
played one of the best games of the sca
son and showed great improvement. The
entire team has developed its ability in
passing and general handling of the ball.
Moore High Point Man
Cliff Moore, at forward, was high point
man, adding eleven tallies. Dennis was
nc'xt with eight. Throughout the game
these two were the leaders in the offense
and both Clark and Vincenti backed tlicm
up well.
Moore started the scoring by ringing
the hoop from the side. Captain Mc-
Kenna of Sacramento sank one; Rooney
gave the Solons the lead by adding an
other basket. Fighting back and forth
put the ball first in one end of the floor
and then the other without either side
being able to take a shot. The quarter
ended, 4 to 2, in favor of Sacramento.
Start With Speed
The freshmen started the second quar
ter with a great burst of speed and al
most immediately built the score up to
10 to 4 in their favor. Clark started
by making a perfect shot from the mid
dle of the floor. Moore was next when
he dropped one from under the basket
on a pass from Vincenti. Moore caught
the next tip off, dribbled down, and shot
another. On the following tip off Sac
ramento dropped back for five-man de
fense and to save timevßill Clark made
another from past the middle of the
floor.
Three Subs Go In
Hunt then sent in his three substitutes.
Nye replaced Vincenti, Snyde for Moore,
and Reynolds for Bigelow. With these
men in, the game slowed up a bit, but
Clark converted a foul and Nye shot one
coming in fast from the side. Just as
the gun ended the half Rooney added
two points for Sacramento on a long
shot.
The three substitutes started the sec
ond half and played around for four
minutes, then Snyde and Dennis each
dropped one, adding four points. Just
as they started to work well together,
Hunt sent his first team in and took out
his three substitutes. Both Vincenti and
Moore scored baskets without hesitation
and the quarter ended, 21 to 6.
Denis Tries Hard
Dennis seemed to have his hands on
the ball all during the last period. At
one time he took six shots in a row, as
fast as he could throw the ball and
catch it again, and on the sixth shot the
ball rolled around the basket and finally
fell through. Just to show he could sink
one on the first try, Dennis tipped off
the ball, caught it, dribbled down, and
slipped it through.
Baxter of Sacramento started a short
rally when he converted two fouls, and
came back again sinking one from the
side. It was just at this time that
"Windy" Bigelow went to the bench on
a four-foul count and the four first
string men continued the game. They
added three points, leaving the final
score: Stanford 29, Sacramento 10.

Stanford Sacramento
