# RED MINGS TAKE ON LICK-WILMERDING QUINTET TOMORROW
## Eight Remain From Original Squad of Forty-Five After Two Weeks 
### Harry Bennett 
Eight freshmen will make up the
squad that will be sent against the fast
Lick-Wilmerdlßg quintet in the pa
vilion tomorrow night.-
This is the first time in many years
that Coach "Husky" Hunt has been
forced to work with such a small num
ber of recruits. The squad started at
the first of the quarter with forty-five'
men working out.
A week later the cut left twenty
five men still playing but now, the
faculty has forced another cut, leaving
Hunt just eight men.
Interpretations Strengthened
This unexpected slash comes after a
.discussion over the interpretation of
the Pacific Coast Conference eligibil
ity rules.
Players are governed by two rules
regarding scholastic standing. One
states that a participant must have
passed two-thirds of the hours taken
the previous quarter and the second
states that the player must not have
failed in more than one-fifth of the
total hours passed.
Previously, only the first rule has
been applied to freshmen, but at the
last meeting of the conference it was
decided that both rules should govern
the first year men as well as varsity
players.
Second Rule Does the Work
It was this second ruling that dis
qualified most of the freshmen. Only
one or two failed in more than one
third of the hours thpy took last quar
ter but very few could pass the second
qualification. £
The first effect of this cut was seen
In the game with Sacramento last Sat
urday. Dennis at center and Clark at;
running guard were forced to play
the entire game. If either had been
hurt the position would have been left
without a good substitute.
It showed again and was more evi
dent when Windy Bigelow was taken
from the game with four personal
fouls in the last few moments of play.
The babes had to continue the game
with only four men in the line-up.
At practice last night, the pavilion
looked rather deserted. About ten men
were in suits working under Hunt, a
few managers were there, and a half
dozen of the disqualified players sat on
the sidelines with long faces.
