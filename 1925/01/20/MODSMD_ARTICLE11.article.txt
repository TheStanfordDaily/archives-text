### Al Post 
Playing with mechanical smooth
ness, the Encina IE basketballers won
their second straight victory in their
clash with the fast Panther five yes
terday. The score was 10 to 5.
Results for the other games follow:
Zeta Psi 31, Chinese Club 4; Sequoia
Seconds 11, Encina 1W 5; Chi Psi 18,
Pirates 9; Sigma Nu 12, Delta Chi 4;
Phi Kappa Psi 22, Los Arcos 4.
Previous to their encounter with En
cina the Panthers were rated as one
of the strongest teams in the league.
Dobson and' Cook, center and forward
on the Encina squad, worked perfectly
together as a result of playing on the
same high school quintet for several
years before entering Stanford, and
Carlsmith did nicely as the third man
in the combination.
Taylor of the Panthers is probably
the fastest running guard in the
league, and Engleke and Kellogg rank
with the best centers and forwards,
but these bright individual stars have
not yet learned to co-ordinate as a
unit. They managed to lead Encina 3 to
2 in the first half, but their defense
broke in the second period.
Sequoia Seconds Win
Sequoia Seconds also chalked up
their second win in as many starts
when they defeated Encina IW, 11 to
5, in a slow contest. Encina was forced
to gather a piek-up team at the last
minute, and consequently was not in
a position to give Sequoia much to
worry about, although the babes led
4 to 1 at the half-way point. Hunt,
