# POWERFUL ENCINA IE AGGREGATION TRIMS PANTHER SQUAD 10-5
## Zeta Psi, Sequoia Seconds, Chi Psi, Phi Kappa Psi, Win Two Straight 
### Al Post 
Playing with mechanical smooth
ness, the Encina IE basketballers won
their second straight victory in their
clash with the fast Panther five yes
terday. The score was 10 to 5.
Results for the other games follow:
Zeta Psi 31, Chinese Club 4; Sequoia
Seconds 11, Encina 1W 5; Chi Psi 18,
Pirates 9; Sigma Nu 12, Delta Chi 4;
Phi Kappa Psi 22, Los Arcos 4.
Previous to their encounter with En
cina the Panthers were rated as one
of the strongest teams in the league.
Dobson and' Cook, center and forward
on the Encina squad, worked perfectly
together as a result of playing on the
same high school quintet for several
years before entering Stanford, and
Carlsmith did nicely as the third man
in the combination.
Taylor of the Panthers is probably
the fastest running guard in the
league, and Engleke and Kellogg rank
with the best centers and forwards,
but these bright individual stars have
not yet learned to co-ordinate as a
unit. They managed to lead Encina 3 to
2 in the first half, but their defense
broke in the second period.
Sequoia Seconds Win
Sequoia Seconds also chalked up
their second win in as many starts
when they defeated Encina IW, 11 to
5, in a slow contest. Encina was forced
to gather a piek-up team at the last
minute, and consequently was not in
a position to give Sequoia much to
worry about, although the babes led
4 to 1 at the half-way point. Hunt,
Senior, and Irwin iVere the main cogs
for the upperclassmen.
Sigma Nu triumphed over Delta Chi
12 to 4 in another slow encounter.
Sigma Nu piled up an early lead and
hung on to it. Aydelotte, varsity liuc
ler, was high point man with ten
tallies.
Zeta Psi had an easy time beating
the Chinese Club 31 to 4 and re
corded its second victory. As in their 1
game with the Sequoia Seconds the |
Chinese proved too small to cope ef- \
fectively with the heavy offense of I
their opponents. Sproul of the Zetas
had a banner day at running guard,
annexing fourteen points. Post and
Rockefellow also scored heavily. Zeta
Psi was out in front 17 to 4 at the ,
half.
Chi Psi and Pirate fives put on a
more interesting battle, with the Chi J
Psi's getting an 18 to 9 verdict for ;
their second win of the series. The
Pirates competed with two of their
stars, Miron and Espy, missing from j
their line-up on account of playing on
weight teams: Menzies was the big
gun for Chi Psi with ten points.
Shock troops of Phi Kappa Psi
staged a scoring carnival at the ex
pense of Los Arcos, running up a total
of 22 points to 4. Wittenburg, Knox,
McCallister, and the other "horsemen"
earned the vociferous praises of a
large ropting section of hill-dwellers
by their consistent work. At times it
took on the aspects of a slap-stick
comedy. Hamilton saved Los Arcos
from a coat of whitewash by scoring
all of his team's points.

their second win in as many starts
when they defeated Encina IW, 11 to
5, in a slow contest. Encina was forced
to gather a piek-up team at the last
minute, and consequently was not in
a position to give Sequoia much to
worry about, although the babes led
4 to 1 at the half-way point. Hunt,
Senior, and Irwin iVere the main cogs
for the upperclassmen.
Sigma Nu triumphed over Delta Chi
12 to 4 in another slow encounter.
Sigma Nu piled up an early lead and
hung on to it. Aydelotte, varsity liuc
ler, was high point man with ten
tallies.
Zeta Psi had an easy time beating
the Chinese Club 31 to 4 and re
corded its second victory. As in their 1
game with the Sequoia Seconds the |
Chinese proved too small to cope ef- \
fectively with the heavy offense of I
their opponents. Sproul of the Zetas
had a banner day at running guard,
annexing fourteen points. Post and
Rockefellow also scored heavily. Zeta
Psi was out in front 17 to 4 at the ,
half.
Chi Psi and Pirate fives put on a
more interesting battle, with the Chi J
Psi's getting an 18 to 9 verdict for ;
their second win of the series. The
Pirates competed with two of their
stars, Miron and Espy, missing from j
their line-up on account of playing on
weight teams: Menzies was the big
gun for Chi Psi with ten points.
Shock troops of Phi Kappa Psi
staged a scoring carnival at the ex
pense of Los Arcos, running up a total
of 22 points to 4. Wittenburg, Knox,
McCallister, and the other "horsemen"
earned the vociferous praises of a
large ropting section of hill-dwellers
by their consistent work. At times it
took on the aspects of a slap-stick
comedy. Hamilton saved Los Arcos
from a coat of whitewash by scoring
all of his team's points.

Playing with mechanical smooth
ness, the Encina IE basketballers won
their second straight victory in their
clash with the fast Panther five yes
terday. The score was 10 to 5.
Results for the other games follow:
Zeta Psi 31, Chinese Club 4; Sequoia
Seconds 11, Encina 1W 5; Chi Psi 18,
Pirates 9; Sigma Nu 12, Delta Chi 4;
Phi Kappa Psi 22, Los Arcos 4.
Previous to their encounter with En
cina the Panthers were rated as one
of the strongest teams in the league.
Dobson and' Cook, center and forward
on the Encina squad, worked perfectly
together as a result of playing on the
same high school quintet for several
years before entering Stanford, and
Carlsmith did nicely as the third man
in the combination.
Taylor of the Panthers is probably
the fastest running guard in the
league, and Engleke and Kellogg rank
with the best centers and forwards,
but these bright individual stars have
not yet learned to co-ordinate as a
unit. They managed to lead Encina 3 to
2 in the first half, but their defense
broke in the second period.
