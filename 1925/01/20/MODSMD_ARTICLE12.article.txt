# Cliff Ireland Tells Evolution Of Independent Baseball Club
## 
### John Levi 
"I play baseball primarily for the kick
that I get out of it." Any who have ever
seen Cliff Ireland, who at the age of
fifty-six is manager, captain, second
baseman, and humorist of the Ireland In
dependent baseball club, besides being a
successful importing broker, can readily
believe this statement. Despite the fact
that his age has somewhat lessened his
playing ability, there arc few men who
pet as much real enjoyment out of a
baseball game as Ireland docs.
"Although I am constantly warned
against overstraining myself, I believe
that I derive some benefit from the cx
creise," was his second consideration.
"It would be an impossibility for me
to get out and gallop around in the out
field, but I can handle the territory
. around second base with a fair degree of
efficiency," said Cliff.
If the truth be known, the largest part
i of his energy is not devoted to playing,
| but is expended upon the volley of

humorous observations that issue from
the vicinity of the first base coaching
box. Ireland has been bringing a base
ball team to Stanford for thirty-three
years, and with every team he brings a
new line of chatter to keep the stands
amused during the uninteresting moments
of the game.
To fully appreciate Cliff, one must
realize that the team he brings down here
is receiving nothing but expense money.
His long association with the game has
made him a well-known figure in the
baseball world. The calibcr of the men
lie is able to gather around him will in
dicate this.
Cliff, who is a native of San Francisco,
was the organizer, manager, and captain
of the Reliance Athletic Club team of
Oakland. After one successful season
under his leadership this club became the
present Oakland ball team. That is the
extent of Ireland's professional baseball
career.
His first independent team was or
| ganized in 1886, and one of the first
j games he played was with the University
'of California during the same year. Ac
cording to Ireland, the only reason he
| didn't play Stanford the same season was
that Stanford wasn't founded until sev
! eral years later. However, he did play
' the Redshirts in 1892, and since that time
I he has never missed a year.
Regarding his preference as to the two
j universities, Ireland refused to incrimi
nate himself, but he did say that he has
never had an unpleasant dealing with
either college, and furthermore he never
intends to have one.
Cliff Ireland was never a college
! student due to a slight misunderstanding
! with the dean of a commercial school in
San Francisco. Cliff made it very plain
that he was not asked to leave the school,
but did so of his own accord as soon as
he obtained the first intimation that his
resignation was to be asked for.
Appears in Red's Uniform
The Cincinnati uniform which is Cliff's
battle array is the gift of Sam Bohne,
famous infielder of the Reds, and a
former star of Ireland's Independents.
Formerly Ireland's team was composed
of many National and American League
players, but due to a ruling against the
big leaguers playing with outside teams,
Cliff depends chiefly on the Pacific Coast
League for his talent at the present time.

famous infielder of the Reds, and a
former star of Ireland's Independents.
Formerly Ireland's team was composed
of many National and American League
players, but due to a ruling against the
big leaguers playing with outside teams,
Cliff depends chiefly on the Pacific Coast
League for his talent at the present time.
"I play baseball primarily for the kick
that I get out of it." Any who have ever
seen Cliff Ireland, who at the age of
fifty-six is manager, captain, second
baseman, and humorist of the Ireland In
dependent baseball club, besides being a
successful importing broker, can readily
believe this statement. Despite the fact
that his age has somewhat lessened his
playing ability, there arc few men who
pet as much real enjoyment out of a
baseball game as Ireland docs.
"Although I am constantly warned
against overstraining myself, I believe
that I derive some benefit from the cx
creise," was his second consideration.
"It would be an impossibility for me
to get out and gallop around in the out
field, but I can handle the territory
. around second base with a fair degree of
efficiency," said Cliff.
If the truth be known, the largest part
i of his energy is not devoted to playing,
| but is expended upon the volley of

humorous observations that issue from
the vicinity of the first base coaching
box. Ireland has been bringing a base
ball team to Stanford for thirty-three
years, and with every team he brings a
new line of chatter to keep the stands
amused during the uninteresting moments
of the game.
To fully appreciate Cliff, one must
realize that the team he brings down here
is receiving nothing but expense money.
His long association with the game has
made him a well-known figure in the
baseball world. The calibcr of the men
lie is able to gather around him will in
dicate this.
Cliff, who is a native of San Francisco,
was the organizer, manager, and captain
of the Reliance Athletic Club team of
Oakland. After one successful season
under his leadership this club became the
present Oakland ball team. That is the
extent of Ireland's professional baseball
career.
His first independent team was or
| ganized in 1886, and one of the first
j games he played was with the University
'of California during the same year. Ac
cording to Ireland, the only reason he
| didn't play Stanford the same season was
that Stanford wasn't founded until sev
! eral years later. However, he did play
' the Redshirts in 1892, and since that time
I he has never missed a year.
Regarding his preference as to the two
j universities, Ireland refused to incrimi
nate himself, but he did say that he has
never had an unpleasant dealing with
either college, and furthermore he never
intends to have one.
Cliff Ireland was never a college
! student due to a slight misunderstanding
! with the dean of a commercial school in
San Francisco. Cliff made it very plain
that he was not asked to leave the school,
but did so of his own accord as soon as
he obtained the first intimation that his
resignation was to be asked for.
Appears in Red's Uniform
The Cincinnati uniform which is Cliff's
battle array is the gift of Sam Bohne,
famous infielder of the Reds, and a
former star of Ireland's Independents.
