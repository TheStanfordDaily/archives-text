### 
According to the report of Delmer |
J Daves at press time none of the solu- j
J tions to the cross-word puzzle which !
I had arrived up to that time were ah-!
solutely correct, so the contest has i
been changed to read: The first an
j swer to be mailed with the least num
ber of mistakes shall receive the prize |
of four tickets to "You and I," and the
| same system will be used to judge the ,
second prize of two tickets.
i
Two hundred and eighteen answers
had been received by noon and with ;
very few exceptions the senders had j
fathomed the technical direction of j
the puzzle if not the words. Owing to \
misprint, none of the Vertical 33, 34, j
35 will be counted incorrect in 'the:
solutions, because of lack of direc
tions; this will continue out of fair
ness to the solutionists.
Another announcement: The two |
I long horizontal twenty-word letters |
| under U and AND do not make a word, !
but are there for artistic purposes J
only, this has been clear to all the j
solutionists, but will reassure the ner- j
vous contenders that there still is jus- j
tice. Plenty of opportunity is still ham- j
mering at your door. LET HER IN! I
LET HER IN! See page four, and j
scramble on the brainy boat!
