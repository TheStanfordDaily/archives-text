# Anschutz Appointed Head Of. Committee to Select Junior Opera Plot, Music
## 
### 
Irving Anschutz will head the Junior
Opera committee that was chosen Friday
by Charles Stratton, president of the
class of '26. The other members of the
committee are "Chubby" Tyroler, Del
mer Daves, Marjorie Allen, Helen Lewis,
and Aileene Burks.
The committee was appointed at an
early date so that ample time will be
allowed for the selection of the play and
the music. All that are interested in
submitting either should get in touch
with Anschutz as soon as possible.
