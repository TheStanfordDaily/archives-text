# LIQUOR VIOLATION TO BE TOPIC OF OPEN FORUM DISCUSSION
## 
### 
Sensational revelations are expected
at the Open Forum, conducted by
Euphronia Club in the lobby of the
Old Union at 7:30 Thursday.
William L. Gosslin, president of the
club, is in receipt of an anonymous let
ter from one who evidently knows the
ins and outs of the liquor traffic
around the University. This letter and
any others that may be received bear
ing on the subject will be read at the
start of the meeting and discussed by
the assembly.
Dean Culver will speak on the topic
of the evening, "To What Extent Is
the Government Regulation Against
Liquor Being Violated on the Cam
pus?" Dean Culver has advocated pro
hibition for over fifteen years and,
although it is not generally known,
drinking has been outlawed by the
University for ten years.
Professor Harley L. Lutz of the
Economics department will present the
economic aspects of prohibition.
The student speaker is John C. Duni
way who is alternate on the Stan
ford debate team meeting Oxford.
Duniway spent a year at Oxford and
is acquainted with Woodruff, Hollis,
and McDonald, the debaters, and will
explain the attitude toward liquor of
men in the English college. There a
drinking party is as common and as
innocent as a smoker here, he says.
Exchange of opinion among those
present is solicited, as the object of
the meeting is that the audience do
more than merely listen to the speak
ers. All campus men and women, ad
ministrative and faculty members, and
people of Palo Alto are invited to at
: tend. The president of the organization
i extends a special invitation to campus
bootleggers and their patrons, who are
also urged 'to write anonyiuous letters
giving details and statistics regarding
the trade here. All such communica-
Hons should be addressed to W. F.
from being in the limelight. There are
but three theatres and until the time
of the Ayacuclio celebration two of
these were dark. There is one first
clas smotion picture theatre.
The dress is very formal, full-dress
being the customary costume from 4
o'clock in the afternoon on. Many stu
dents attend the university wearing
swallow-tail coats, spats, and carrying
canes. Something they could never get
used to are our balls and dances —
they are accustomed to an "eleven-to
sfx" affair.
The Government is the Presidential
form with almost a parliamentary
basis —in theory. In fact, it is a "one
man" government, a dictatorship. The
President has absolutely full power in
everything and all bmnches are sub
ject to him. According to Professor
Stuart, this has been very successful,
and the many public improvements
made by the last administration have
proved astounding.
"The United States has a tremen
dous standing in Peru," continued Pro
fessor Stuart. "It is perhaps the most
friendly of South American countries,
and Americans are in complete charge
of many public offices. There are fine
opportunities ,for Americans and the
pay is excellent. But get a contract
before you leave the United States, for
it is more advantageous to you. There
is a great deal of construction work,
and engineers especially are needed.

Dean Culver will speak on the topic
of the evening, "To What Extent Is
the Government Regulation Against
Liquor Being Violated on the Cam
pus?" Dean Culver has advocated pro
hibition for over fifteen years and,
although it is not generally known,
drinking has been outlawed by the
University for ten years.
Professor Harley L. Lutz of the
Economics department will present the
economic aspects of prohibition.
The student speaker is John C. Duni
way who is alternate on the Stan
ford debate team meeting Oxford.
Duniway spent a year at Oxford and
is acquainted with Woodruff, Hollis,
and McDonald, the debaters, and will
explain the attitude toward liquor of
men in the English college. There a
drinking party is as common and as
innocent as a smoker here, he says.
Exchange of opinion among those
present is solicited, as the object of
the meeting is that the audience do
more than merely listen to the speak
ers. All campus men and women, ad
ministrative and faculty members, and
people of Palo Alto are invited to at
: tend. The president of the organization
i extends a special invitation to campus
bootleggers and their patrons, who are
also urged 'to write anonyiuous letters
giving details and statistics regarding
the trade here. All such communica-
Hons should be addressed to W. F.
from being in the limelight. There are
but three theatres and until the time
of the Ayacuclio celebration two of
these were dark. There is one first
clas smotion picture theatre.
The dress is very formal, full-dress
being the customary costume from 4
o'clock in the afternoon on. Many stu
dents attend the university wearing
swallow-tail coats, spats, and carrying
canes. Something they could never get
used to are our balls and dances —
they are accustomed to an "eleven-to
sfx" affair.
The Government is the Presidential
form with almost a parliamentary
basis —in theory. In fact, it is a "one
man" government, a dictatorship. The
President has absolutely full power in
everything and all bmnches are sub
ject to him. According to Professor
Stuart, this has been very successful,
and the many public improvements
made by the last administration have
proved astounding.
"The United States has a tremen
dous standing in Peru," continued Pro
fessor Stuart. "It is perhaps the most
friendly of South American countries,
and Americans are in complete charge
of many public offices. There are fine
opportunities ,for Americans and the
pay is excellent. But get a contract
before you leave the United States, for
it is more advantageous to you. There
is a great deal of construction work,
and engineers especially are needed.
Sensational revelations are expected
at the Open Forum, conducted by
Euphronia Club in the lobby of the
Old Union at 7:30 Thursday.
William L. Gosslin, president of the
club, is in receipt of an anonymous let
ter from one who evidently knows the
ins and outs of the liquor traffic
around the University. This letter and
any others that may be received bear
ing on the subject will be read at the
start of the meeting and discussed by
the assembly.
