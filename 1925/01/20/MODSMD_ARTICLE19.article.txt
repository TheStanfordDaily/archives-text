any others that may be received bear

start of the meeting and discussed by
the assembly.

Duniway spent a year at Oxford and
is acquainted with Woodruff, Hollis,

explain the attitude toward liquor of
men in the English college. There a
drinking party is as common and as
innocent as a smoker here, he says.

the meeting is that the audience do

ers. All campus men and women, ad
ministrative and faculty members, and
people of Palo Alto are invited to at

i extends a special invitation to campus
bootleggers and their patrons, who are
