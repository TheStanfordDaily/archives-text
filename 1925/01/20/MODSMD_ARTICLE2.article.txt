# GOLF CLUB MEETS IN UNION TONIGHT; FRESHMEN ELIGIBLE
## 
### 
Stanford Golf Club members will
hold their first meeting of the quarter
at 7:15 tonight in the Trophy Room of
the Old Union. Freshmen were de
clared eligible for membership at the
last meeting of the club, and a large
influx of first-year men is looked for
at tonight's gathering.
The chief purpose of the organiza
tion is to secure a campus golf course
lor Stanford. According to President
Eli Dorsey, there is a host of men
in the University interested in the
links sport who fail to realize the ne
cessity for affiliating with the club in
order to assist in the (â€¢mpaign for
playing facilities, although they would
be quick to take advantage of a course
when it is secured.
No dues will be exacted until the
links become a reality, and there is
no obligation incurred upon joining. At
tonight's meeting reports will be made
on the possibility of obtaining aid from
the alumni. Letters describing golf
facilities in several large eastern uni
versities will be read.
