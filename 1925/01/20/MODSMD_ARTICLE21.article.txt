Oxford's debate team, in coining to the campus Thursday evening, is
offering a real opportunity to residents of the community who desire to be
in on something both unique and worth while. The subject of prohibition,
which has been argued so thoroughly since it became too late for argu
ment to be of anything but lung-developing merit, will receive a thorough
and sensible airing which may include two absolutely different points of
view.
Those who are apathetic toward debating because of the usual involved
and remotely interesting (to the average student) nature of the subject
will have no cause for objection here. It can almost be said that students
are more interested in prohibition—pro or con—than in any other problem
of national And it is a problem deserving serious thought,
involving as it does so large a share of the welfare and nature of the
country.
It will be interesting to note. Thursday evening, whether prohibition
is discussed as such, or as a law of the land which stands 011 the books and
which should therefore be strictly enforced. According to the "American
Mercury," the latter has entirely supplanted the former in the arguments
of the "drys," and if the Stanford debaters succeed in making prohibition
stand 011 its own feet their triumph should result in the convincing of
many skeptics. The Englishmen, it seems most probable, will concern
themselves with the institution rather than the legislation, and it will be
greatly to the point to meet them on their own ground.
Stanford will be glad to welcome these Oxford men. The debate will
be more interesting, more valuable, and better attended than any debate
has been for a long time.
