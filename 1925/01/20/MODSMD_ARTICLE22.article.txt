# More Recognition

The following editorial paragraph from "The Nation" comes as an
supplement to yesterday's appreciation of Dr. Jordan by Dr. Wilbur:
"Of all the peace awards of recent months none gives us more unques
tioning satisfaction than the Herman prize of $25,000 for the best educa
tional plan to promote world peace. The award went to David Starr
Jordan, chancellor emeritus of Leland Stanforc4 Junior University, who
for a quarter century has consecrated himself to education for world
peace. Other peace prizes have gone to men who, however brilliant may
have been their contribution in other years, failed the cause of peace in its
greatest need. Dr. Jordan stood by his principles through persecution and
ostracism. His program calls upon the World Federation of Educational
Associations to establish international committees to investigate the text
books and teaching of history, the possibilities of international interchange
of students, the question of military training in the schools, and similar
subjects. Whatever the concrete program, if this award calls attention
and respect anew to the personality and spirit of David Starr Jordan it
will effectively educate for peace."
