# Wolves and Sheepskins
## 
### 
Every once in awhile, college Students are given to looking to the
future, regardless of their supposed "rah-rah" ideas of life. Tradition has
it that the university graduate, diploma in hand, expects the world to
kneel in recognition. Another tradition gone astray.
Undergraduates now seem more apt to look at life after college with
apprehensions of bill-collectors, wolves, and even starvation. Sheepskins
have become more plentiful.
Professor E. W. Smith spent the last six months touring the East and
Middle West, inspecting schools of journalism and newspapers. He en
countered many a Stanford graduate plugging his way along.
The salient point of Professor Smith's report is that most of these
Stanford men have reached the top of the heap, in many cases assuming
the right of way and making places for themselves.
Whatever may be the true fundamental purposes of education, and no
matter where our present system bows to criticism to admit shortcomings,
the one concrete, reassuring fact stands: Stanford men are making good.
