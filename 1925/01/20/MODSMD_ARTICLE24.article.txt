# Women's Asilomar Gathering Planned
## 
### 
January 30 to February 1 is the
time set for the Mid-Winter Western
Conference on "Youth and Education"
at Asilomar near Carmel.
Women delegates from Northern
California and Nevada, including stu
dents from Mills, the University of
California, and Stanford, will gather
at Asilomar for the exchange of ideas,
and the recreation of a week-end hy
the sea. Speakers are scheduled, but
no noe need attend lectures unless she

! desires to. Such amusements as horse
back riding, swimming, hiking, and
; campfire stunts are available.
The total cost of the week-end is
1 figured at $11. This includes transpor
tation; and so those driving up will
! not spend as much as that amount.
Four dollars and seventy cents should
be figured for lodging and meals in the
Guest Inn, and $1 for registration
fee.

Over three-fourths of the men and
most of the women of Baylor Univer
sity are members of Sunday schools.
