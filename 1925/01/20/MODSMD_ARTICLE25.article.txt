## 
### Dudley Ross 
Forty larger paintings and a num
ber of small pictures painted by Wil
liam P. Silva, of Carmel, are on ex
hibition at the Art Gallery until Feb
ruary 8. Among his works on view is
"Afternoon," which received honorable
mention in the Salon des Artistes
Francaise in 1922, an honor which only
three Americans received at that time.
Most of his paintings have been
taken from scenes in California, espe
cially near Carmel, and in Carolina.
"Afternoon" is one of his'"Garden of
Dreams" series, which he painted
\yhile in South Carolina. Of these the
Paris edition of the New York Herald
says, "Americans found in Mr. Silva's
California and Carolina landscapes a
brilliant evocation of scenes physically
remote but ever near in happy mem
ory. French connoisseurs, on the other

j hand, while admiring the personal
style and finished technique of the
artist from overseas, underwent an
initiation into the peculiar beauties of
two very different American country
-1 sides."
Lemos Praises Silva
Pedro J. Lemos, director of the Art
; Gallery, stated that Stanford was very
I i
I fortunate in securing these paintings
for exhibition, as Silva is one of the
foremost of American painters.

Besides the honors which he gained
abroad, Silva lias been awarded many
[ medals at showings in this country, in
| eluding a silver medal at the Panama-
California Exposition at San Diego in j
1915. His individual exhibition in Paris
two years ago was one of the most
successful of the season.
At the time of his recent showing in
Los Angeles, Anthony Anderson, art

silvery charm that delights the eye and
leads the mind into happy reflections."
Parisians Laud Artist
La Revue Moderne, published in
Paris, considers him "one of the mas
ters of modern art in the United
States, and one of the most representa
tive artists of a school hitherto little
known in France, which has already
produced a good many masterpieces,
and may be expected to produce yet
more.".
In addition to the Silva exhibit are
a series of crayon drawings and
sketches made by Pedro J. Lemos, di
rector of the Art Gallery, while in
Europe last summer. Perhaps the most
interesting of the sketches are those
made in San Gimignano, an old town
in Central Italy.

Forty larger paintings and a num
ber of small pictures painted by Wil
liam P. Silva, of Carmel, are on ex
hibition at the Art Gallery until Feb
ruary 8. Among his works on view is
"Afternoon," which received honorable
mention in the Salon des Artistes
Francaise in 1922, an honor which only
three Americans received at that time.
Most of his paintings have been
taken from scenes in California, espe
cially near Carmel, and in Carolina.
"Afternoon" is one of his'"Garden of
Dreams" series, which he painted
\yhile in South Carolina. Of these the
Paris edition of the New York Herald
says, "Americans found in Mr. Silva's
California and Carolina landscapes a
brilliant evocation of scenes physically
remote but ever near in happy mem
ory. French connoisseurs, on the other

j hand, while admiring the personal
style and finished technique of the
artist from overseas, underwent an
initiation into the peculiar beauties of
two very different American country
-1 sides."
Lemos Praises Silva
Pedro J. Lemos, director of the Art
; Gallery, stated that Stanford was very
I i
I fortunate in securing these paintings
for exhibition, as Silva is one of the
foremost of American painters.
