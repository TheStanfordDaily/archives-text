# SPORTS OF 1925
## Three Winter B's 
### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
I lie murmhi ing of innumerable bees ' is not confined only to the summer
time. In the sports world there are winter B's too. Omitting the two biggest
of all B's, Boxing and Baseball, and sundry lesser B's like Bicycle-racing,
Boating, and Bull-fighting, we will confine this discussion to the three winter
B's —Basketball, Billiards, and Bowling.
Basketball is distinct from most of the other popular sports in that it was
deliberately invented and did not gradually evolve. Dr. James Naismith, of
the University of Kansas, originated the game about 1891. Butler University
is the present National A.A.U. Champion.
A great deal of interest is aroused annually over the ever-increasing string
of victories won by Passaic High School, in New Jersey. This wonder team
started to win games away back in 1919, and in five seasons ran up close to
150 victories without a single defeat.
You don't have to be so young to star as a basketball player. Many veteran
Big League ballplayers play professional basketball in the winter; among them
being our old friend Nick Altrock. Jack Tierney, of Chicago, has been starring
for over eighteen years as a basketball player, averaging twenty games a year
and twelve points a game.
Billiardfe, the favorite sport of Napolean and other celebrities, was never
more popular than at present. Willie Hoppe, the 18.2 champion, is causing
a lot of critics to gasp with his fine playing at three-cushion billiards. Bob
Canefax, the three-cushion champion, started out to be a professional ball
player, but lost a foot due to blood-poisoning after being hit by a pitched ball,
and then took up billiards. The matches now being played between him and
Hoppe have aroused tremendous interest.
Bowling, too, continues to grow in popularity. The annual meeting of the
American Bowling Congress is the world's largest sporting event, with 13,000
bowlers entered. Jimmy Blouin is generally accorded the title of "World's
Champion Bowler." He won first prize in the A.B.C. twice, and has rolled a
perfect score —more difficult than a hole in one in golf—on six different
occasions.
