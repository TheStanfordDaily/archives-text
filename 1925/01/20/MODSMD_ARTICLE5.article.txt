That "most men have lives of quiet
I desperation" is arresting merely as a
j shorn and shivering statement. But
When it is padded by as clever and
| brilliant lines as those which compose
| "You and I," it becomes not only ar
resting, but interesting—rather!
In fact, the entire play is conducive
! to extended, and active, thought. The
| story is of an American business man
who, in his youth, wanted to paint,
but who married "the only girl" in
stead. Then in his forties —still longing
to wield the brush —he discovers that
his son is facing the identical proposi
tion which made his own life one of
"quiet desperation."
How he manages to a belated
fling at painting and at the same time
to find a way for his son to "have his
cake and eat it too" is told by the
brilliant, young author in the three
rapid acts of the comedy-drama.
Outside of the entertainment of the
play, it furnishes excellent advice for
the many talented students who are
finding themselves in the position of
the hero. "Love or a career —a career
or love!" —can one have both if one's
father owns not a soap factory?
Rehearsals for "You and I" began
over a week ago, and since members
of the All-Star-Cast are appearing daily
in their various classes with the morn
ing sun, and as cheerful, there is no
reason to believe that Gordon Davis is
anything but pleased with the entire
proceedings.
