"Manana y tampico no hay."
Thus does Professor Gramah H.
Stuart of the Political Science Depart
ment sura up the country of Peru.
Professor Stuart has just returned
from a seven months' trip to this most
friendly of South American nations,
having been sent as a Research Asso
ciate of the Carnegie Institute of
Washington to prepare a monograph
on the Government of Peru.
"That phrase tells the entire story
of Peru, for it is essentially a land
of tomorrow," declared Professor
Stuart. "No one -believes in keeping
his appointment on time and many are

waiting than in any other one occupa

for a certain article, the answer is in

already stated, was to study the inner

now ready for publication. A book of
approximately 250 pages will appear
in a few months, dealing entirely
with the technical side.

Battle of Ayacucho, the celebration of
Peruvian independence, was in the

Professor Stuart was again the dele
gate of the Carnegie Institute and a
guest of Peru. For many months Lima,
the capital, had prepared for ttyis

had not been in vain. It was one round
of festivities and balls after another.
Delegates attended from most of the
civilized world.
Lima was likewise the scene of the
Third Pan-American Scientific Con

represented both the Carnegie Insti
tute and Stanford University. This fol
; lowed the Ayacucho celebration.
Lima is a very quiet city of about a
| quarter million inhabitants, and does
| not at all live up to the story that is
i told of it â€”"a second Paris." There are
j many churches, only a few cafes, and
jno cabarets, which is remarkable for

Were the bull fights.
