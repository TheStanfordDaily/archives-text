###

student at Oxford, speaking on the
side of the question which the British
ers will uphold Thursday, the Stanford
debating team engaged in a practice
clash last night under the direction
of Faculty Debating Advisor J. G.
Emerson.
Duniway has been of tremendous as
sistance to the Stanford squad as an
alternate, inasmuch as he is thorough
ly familiar with the Oxford style of
debating and with the peculiarities of
the three men who are making the
korld tour, and can offer valuable sug
gestions for combating their attack.
He is a personal friend of Malcolm
Mac Donald.
So perfectly have Emerson's speak
ers solved the problem, that both
Duniway and Professor L. E. Bassett,
who also spent several years at Ox
ford, yesterday expressed approval of
the tactics which will be employed.
Last night's speeches were entirely
extemporaneous, and showed that
every member of the squad has a thor
ough grasp of the subject.
Littler to Take Rebuttal
At the conclusion of the practice
clash Emerson anounced that Robert
Littler would handle the rebuttal for
Stanford. The debaters will speak in
such order that J. D. Woodruff will
oppose Stanley Weigel; Robert Lewis,
C. M. Hollis; and Robert Littler, Mal
colm Mac Donald.
Duniway received a telegram from
Mac Donald yesterday stating that the
Oxford team will arrive on the campus
Thursday morning. They will be met
by members of the debate committee
and conducted on a short inspection
tour around the University grounds
and buildings. In all probability, they
will dine with a few living groups.
Directly after the debate a reception
will be held in the Women's Clubhouse
to save all those who so desire an op
portunity to meet the visitors.
