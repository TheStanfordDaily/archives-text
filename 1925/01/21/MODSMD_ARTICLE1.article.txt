# FACULTY MEN ADDRESS OPEN FORUM TONIGHT
## Dry-Law Violation Problems To Be Presented by Euphronians 
### 
Whether violations of the Eighteenth
Amendement are frequent on the Stan
ford campus will be one of the ques
tions which Euphronia members will
attempt to bring out in an open forum
discussion tonight on the shbject "To
•what extent are government regula
tions against liquor violated by Stan
ford students."
An effort to get an exchange of
opinions and to get views either by
anonymous or signed letters is being
made by W. L. Gosslin, president of
the Euphronia Club. Three _ speakers
have been secured for tonight's meet
ing. They are George B. Culver, dean
of men; Professor Harvey L. Lutz, of
the Department of Economics, and
John C. Duniway, alternate on the
Stanford squad for the Oxford-Stanford
debate.
This is the second of a series of
Open Forum meetings which are being
held by Euphronia. The first, held last
week, was concerned with the topic of
professionalism in athletics. The next
will be on the fraternity-sorority ques
tion, when Dean Yost will speak.
W. L. Gosslin, president of the club,
says "These ijieetings are designed
to provide a common meeting ground
for faculty and students, similar to the
Liberal Clubs of Yale and Harvard,
where vital questions of affairs on and
off campus can be talked over. Al
though tonight's subject relates only
to prohibition on the campus the dis
cussion is expected to bear on the
■whole subject of national prohibition's
faults and virtues. The meeting -is
open to all campus men and women.
