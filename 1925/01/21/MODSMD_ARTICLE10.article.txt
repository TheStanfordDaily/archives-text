# TRAVELER DESCRIBES PRESENT POLITICS OF IRELAND
## 
### 
"Past history casts a dark shadow
over the present situation in Ireland,"
said G. H. Scott, Canadian barrister,
who lectured on "Ireland at the Cross-
Roads" last night.
"It is hard to judge past history with
accuracy," he continued. "In the south
ern part of the country the people are
fiercely demanding home rule, and in
the northern most of the people are
contented as things are. Most of the
population there is Protestant Scotch,
and they have never wanted home
rule."
Treaty Reached in 1921
At the close of 1921 the British Gov
ernment succeeded in calling a con
ference of Ireland and Britain. At the
last moment of the meeting, and at
two o'clock in the morning, an agree
ment was arrived at. This agreement
has been referred to as a treaty, and
considered the whole of Ireland as one
state.
Six northern counties had the privi
lege of voting themselves out, and the
boundary clause was responsible for
the trouble that resulted. An attempt
made to settle the boundary failed.
"If you go to Ireland it is natural
to go across to Dublin," Scott ex
plained. "At once one is confronted
with two types of public notices, Irish
and EngliJ»h. The Irish bulletins are
put in a more favorable place, and
generally have larger print, not be
cause more people use Irish, but as a
gesture to the world to show that
Ireland is free."
The Union Jack is seldom flown,
practically the first time Scott recalled
its being hoisted was last Armistice
Day, when "God Save the King" was
also sung again. This present attitude
is expected to lead to better feeling.
"The Free State is now facing eco-
I nomic and political difficulties. The
j Republican party is large and is re
| cruited in various ways," he declared.
"Ireland is a poor agricultural coun
try, and some hated to lose the thou
| sands of dollars spent by the British
j soldiers. These persons say if there
is a rebellion Britain will send troops,
and in this way Ireland will get the
money the garrisons spend. Other re
cruits are politicians, but the core of
the party are sincere prepared to
fight for their principles."

two o'clock in the morning, an agree
ment was arrived at. This agreement
has been referred to as a treaty, and
considered the whole of Ireland as one
state.
Six northern counties had the privi
lege of voting themselves out, and the
boundary clause was responsible for
the trouble that resulted. An attempt
made to settle the boundary failed.
"If you go to Ireland it is natural
to go across to Dublin," Scott ex
plained. "At once one is confronted
with two types of public notices, Irish
and EngliJ»h. The Irish bulletins are
put in a more favorable place, and
generally have larger print, not be
cause more people use Irish, but as a
gesture to the world to show that
Ireland is free."
The Union Jack is seldom flown,
practically the first time Scott recalled
its being hoisted was last Armistice
Day, when "God Save the King" was
also sung again. This present attitude
is expected to lead to better feeling.
"The Free State is now facing eco-
I nomic and political difficulties. The
j Republican party is large and is re
| cruited in various ways," he declared.
"Ireland is a poor agricultural coun
try, and some hated to lose the thou
| sands of dollars spent by the British
j soldiers. These persons say if there
is a rebellion Britain will send troops,
and in this way Ireland will get the
money the garrisons spend. Other re
cruits are politicians, but the core of
the party are sincere prepared to
fight for their principles."
