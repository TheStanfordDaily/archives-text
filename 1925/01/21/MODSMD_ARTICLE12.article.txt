syndicalism debate. He participated
with merit in the Joffre and the politi
cal forensic meets, and rounded out

home town, he is registered fom Los
Angeles. He has participated in con
tests with California, Oregon, and
Washington, and in 1923 was Stan
ford's entry in the Pacific Coast ex

candidacy in the political debate last
November.
Littler Is Logical Speaker
If debating squads chose a captain
Robert Littler would probably be se
lected for the honor. In straightfor

equal among coast orators, in the opin
ion of a majority of debate coaches.
Born in Ohio, he has spent most of
his life in Oregon. Littler attended
Willamette University for two years,
during which time he was a member
of a team which toured the United
States upholding the League of Na
tions. «
He transferred to Stanford in the
fall of 1923, and in January, 1924,
chalked up his first victory for the
Cardinal in the criminal syndicalism
debate. Later in the year he won the
greatest honor which can come to a
Stanford debater, the Joffre medal.
During the recent presidential cam
paign he was Director of the Bureau
of Research at the headquarters of
the Republipan party of California. He
defended Coolidge in the political for
ensic contest. In recognition of his
ability he was appointed chairman of
the Stanford debate committee last
quarter.
