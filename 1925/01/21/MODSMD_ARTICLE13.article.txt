# "YOU AND I" SETTINGS ARE DESIGNED BY LESLIE KILER
## 
### 
One of the finest sets which has
been made for a play in the history of
campus dramatics is being designed
by Technical Director Leslie Kiler
for one of the acts in "You and I." Al
though the play has been called "an
ordinary experience of people like 'you
and I'," it provides ample opportunity
for cleverness in setting designs—just
as the theme of it afford the author
infinite possibilities for scintillating
lines. From all indications the creators
of "atmosphere" are not far behind
the author in taking advantage of a
wonderful opportunity.
"You and I" is the first offering from
the pen of Philip Barry, and won the
now-famous Harvard Erize. It was im
mediately purchased by Richard Hern
don, and produced by him at the Bel
mont theatre, New York, with a bril
liant cast including H. B. Warner,
Lucile Watson, Ferdinand Gottschalk,
Geoffrey Kerr, and Reginald Mason.
It ran for a solid year on Broadway,
closing only to allow the stars to take
a well-deserved vacation, in spite of
the fact that the comedy was still
attracting capacity houses.
On account of the numerous activi
ties demanding the time of the bril
liant cast which is to present "You
and I" at Stanford on January 30th
the play can be given on but one eve
ning. However, the dramatic manager
will do his utmost to be perfectly fair
in the distribution of tickets in order
that as many people as possible may
have an opportunity to see the play.
Among the multitude of "different"
features of the comedy-drama is an
instant in the first act when every
one on the stage speaks at once. This
is an entirely new venture in dramatic
technique, and its effect is most strik
ing and interesting. However, it is only
another indication of the utter fear
lessness of the author which makes
him the fascinating writer he is con
ceded to be.
