# THETA CHI QUINTET STAGES COMEBACK TO BEAT ENCINA 3E
## El Toro, Phi Kaps, Kappa Sigs And Phi Delts Make It Two Straight 
### 
Theta Chi came from behind in the
last half to overcome a big lead and
nose out the Encina 3E squad 13 to 11
in an intramural backetball contest
yesterday.
Other games resulted as follows:
El Toro 16, Phi Sigma Kappa 10'; Delta
Tau Delta 17, Encina 4W 6; Phi
Kappa Sigma 18, Kappa Alpha 5;
Kappa Sigma 16, Alpha Sigma Phi 3;
Phi Delta Theta 10, Encina 4E 5.
Fresh from a victory over Delta Tau
Delta, the Encina 3E players were gen
eral favorites to trample on Theta
Chi, and they did look pretty good
during the first half when they ran up
a 7 to 3 lead. Then Dice and Green,
fraternity forwards, commenced to
sink the kind of shots that had rolled
around the hoop without going in dur
ing the early part of the game. Stew
art and Altaffer went well for the
freshmen.
Phi Sigma Kappa came near turning
the same trick as Theta Chi in its
game with El Toro. Outplayed by an
8 to 2 margin in the first period, the
Phi Sigs rallied after the intermission
and came within two points of tieing
the count at 12 to 12, but Wright and
Clifford each chucked in baskets for
El Toro just as the whistle blew.
Hawkins and Cox were the stars for
the Greeks.
Showing tremendous improvement
over their playing last week the Delta
Tau Delta basketers chalked up a 17
to 6 victory over the Encina 4W outfit.
