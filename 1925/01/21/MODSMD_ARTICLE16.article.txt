### 
Theta Chi came from behind in the
last half to overcome a big lead and
nose out the Encina 3E squad 13 to 11
in an intramural backetball contest
yesterday.
Other games resulted as follows:
El Toro 16, Phi Sigma Kappa 10'; Delta
Tau Delta 17, Encina 4W 6; Phi
Kappa Sigma 18, Kappa Alpha 5;
Kappa Sigma 16, Alpha Sigma Phi 3;
Phi Delta Theta 10, Encina 4E 5.
Fresh from a victory over Delta Tau
Delta, the Encina 3E players were gen
eral favorites to trample on Theta
Chi, and they did look pretty good
during the first half when they ran up
a 7 to 3 lead. Then Dice and Green,
fraternity forwards, commenced to
sink the kind of shots that had rolled
around the hoop without going in dur
ing the early part of the game. Stew
art and Altaffer went well for the
freshmen.
Phi Sigma Kappa came near turning
the same trick as Theta Chi in its
game with El Toro. Outplayed by an
8 to 2 margin in the first period, the
Phi Sigs rallied after the intermission
and came within two points of tieing
the count at 12 to 12, but Wright and
Clifford each chucked in baskets for
El Toro just as the whistle blew.
Hawkins and Cox were the stars for
the Greeks.
Showing tremendous improvement
over their playing last week the Delta
Tau Delta basketers chalked up a 17
to 6 victory over the Encina 4W outfit.
"Skin" Collett played a consistent
game at center for the Delts, looping
in baskets from ditticult angles for a |
total of nine points. He and Morrison
teamed together nicely. As a whole?!
| the passing of the Row quintet was
1 good. Duckett acounted for most oÂ£ the
Encina tallies.
Playing a fast offensive game the
Phi Kappa Sigma quintet swamped the
i Kappa Alpha squad by a.score of 18
to 5. Phi Kappa Sigma started out
right in the first half by leading 10 to
4. Thomas - sank the majority of the
baskets with the timely passing of
| McColloch. Yoakum penetrated the
Phi Kappa Sigma defense time after
J time, but received little support from
I his mates.
Kappa Sigma continued their win
' ning streak by running away with the
; Alpha Sigma Phi game. Led by Ste
phens and Middleton, the Kappa Sigs
rolled up a 12 to 1 score in the first
half. During the last half the shock
troop* of the Kappa Sigs were sent
into the fray and they held the Alpha
Sigs down to one basket. Art Mann
played a good game at standing guard.
Although running up against three
:of those freshmen who were cut off
j the squad, last week, the Phi Delts
i won their argument with the Encina j
4E squad by having better teamwork. 1
Playter and Rice each made two bas
kets during the game for the Phi Delts.
The Encina 4E outfit was trailing at
, the half by two field goals. Sheffield,
! Young, and Garibaldi carried the ball
within scoring distance for the hall
men, but always failed to make the
needed goals.
