## 
### 
Textbooks now in use in California
schools were declared by a committee

with the fundamental principles of re
ligion as presented in the Bible.
A committee was formed last sum
mer at the request of the state to
report whether "there is in any of
these textbooks a presentation of the
subject of evolution in such a way as
to discredit the Bible and to develop
in the minds of high school students
an attitude of irreverence and athe
ism." In the report it said that "evolu
tion is presented as a theory and not
as an established fact; that the theory
of evolution is commonly accepted by
scientific men."
The findings of this committee, of
which President Wilbur was a mem
ber, reject the proposal to eliminate
the teaching of evolution in the schools
in California.
