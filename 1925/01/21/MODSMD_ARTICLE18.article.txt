## 
### 
"Fear of Women" will be the subject 1
for Professor Margery Bailey in j
her talk before the Graduate Women's .
club, which is to meet today at G
p. m. in the Union banquet room.
"It should be understood," says Miss j
Bailey, "that I am presenting 110 argu
ment for bachelorhood, nor am I in- -
tending to go into the psychological
causes for non-marriage among men. At,
Yale they do not allow women to reg
ister for undergraduate work, only in
the graduate school. That is what I 1
refer to."
Miss BaiTey was at Yale last year doing
| advanced research work in English, and
plans to tell of her experiences there.
! The officers of the club have announced
that all women graduates of Stanford are
' eligible and invited to attend the banquet.
