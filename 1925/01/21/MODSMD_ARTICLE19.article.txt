# FRESHMEN FACE SAN FRANCISCO QUINTET TONIGHT
## Intensive Workouts Improve Teamwork of Small Babe Squad 
### 
With only eight men left from which
to pick a squad, Coach "Husky" Hunt
will send his yearling charges against
the Lick-Wilmerding high school quin
tet in the pavilion at 8 o'clock tonight.
"Husky" has been working his eight
men with more attention than it would
be possible to give the larger group
and this intensive work should show
in tonight's game. Even last Saturday
the babes were able to take the visi
tors into camp by a large inargin de
spite the sudden and unexpected cut
in the squad.
The team that went on the floor last
week was a well-balance and smooth
working one that fought hard from
the first to the last. Some of the men
of which it was composed would un
doubtedly have been second-string
players had the season continued un
harassed.
The size of the squad and the eager
ness of his handful of men should aid
Hunt considerably in futher perfection
of his teamwork.
Lick-Wilmerding boasts of a stong
squad, and the game should be a real
rest for the first-year men. Hunt's start
ing line-up will no doubt be Vincenti
and Moore at forwards, Dennis at cen
ter, Clark at running guard, and Rey
nolds at standing guard.
Clif Moore is one of the freshmen's
best bets. He is fast, shifty, and is a
fairly accurate shot. In the early sea
son he did not seem to have sufficient
fight but his playing Saturday was be
yond reproach.
Vincenti, who will occupy the for
ward berth, is equally as good as
Moore. Vincenti is not as accurate a
shot as Moore but his passing and
ability to work with the team make
him a valuable man.
Clark at running,guard has played a
consistent game all season. He is
fairly accurate on long shots and usu
ally manages to drop one or two dur
ing the course of a game.
Denis at center is one of the most
valuable men on the squad because
of the ability he possesses to follow
up long shots and convert them into
the two points. Although he is not a
sensational player he is continually
in the fight and is the heart of the
freshman defense.
Reynolds at standing guard will
probably alternate with Bigelow.
These men are about on a par. With
only one and a half minutes to play
in Sacramento Bigelow committed his
fourth personal foul and, as Reynolds
and the otlier two substitutes had gone
into the showers the fosh were forced,
to play with only four men.
