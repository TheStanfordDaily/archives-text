# GOLFERS ARE URGED TO PAY THEIR DUES AT BURLINGAME CLUB
## 
### 
Campus golfers face the possibility
iof losing all playing privileges on the
Burlingame course if they do not pay
their regular monthly fee of $5 imme-
I diately, according to Varsity Golf
Manager C, Vance Carter. Not only
will those who have not remitted be
deprived of the use of playing facili
j ties but the ban will be enforced in
j discriminated against all Stanford
! students.
Directors of the Burlingame club
have shown unusual courtesy in per
mitting persons connected with the
University who are not regular mem
bers of the links body to make use of
the course at all, and failure to pay
the nominal ffee is not only a great
discourtesy to the Burlingame officials
on the part of the delinquent students
but is also a blot on the reputation of
i Stanford, according to Carter.
The rule is that students sign up
with the manager in the clubhouse and
pay the $5 dues for the month before
starting play. On every subsequent day
I they will be required to show their
I receipts before being allowed to tee
off. Carter points out that any indi
vidual who attempts to evade payment
iis simply committing the equivalent
of stealing $5 from the cash drawer
! of the Burlingame club.
