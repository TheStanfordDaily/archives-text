For several years the comic weekly Judge has offered recognition
to funny American collegians and, what is more, the publication has
given the college wits money for accepted contributions. The usual
time for holding the contest is about two months away. It is high
time for penurious humorists to regard the Boy Scout, whose motto,
as you know, is "Be Prepared."
Stanford has had splendid success for the last two years in smart
cracking with contemporary undergraduates. Last laughing season the
Cardinal placed second in the race for the silver trophy which the year
before was won by the local wits. Individual honors went last year to
Carl Shoup and the year before to Mike Ely. And in the success of these
men, an early start was not the'least deciding factor.
.Announcement of the 1925 competition is yet to be made, so no definite
closing date is known. Chaparral, however, has already started preparing
material for the contest. As in the past, Chappie will handle Stanford
contributions. Everybody is eligible. The race is hard-fought and the
prize worth winning. By the time the formal announcement is made,
Stanford should be well under way. H. B. R.
