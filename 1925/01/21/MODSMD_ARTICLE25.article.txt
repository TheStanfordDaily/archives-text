### 
Intramural sports have been played at Stanford, after a fashion, for
four years. Before this year there was very little interest in such competi
tion. Few group teams ever practiced seriously. Many games were for
feited. Schedules were always tangled and the thing was otherwise in
efficient.
The same wizardry that accomplished the enlargement of the gym
nasium and the improvement of the athletic control arrangements, however,
has finally made intramural competition respectable. Whether it is because
there is better service at the gymnasium, as there certainly is, or whether
it is because of the better equipment, the men turn out to play every game
this year. And, further, they turn out to practice.
Those who saw the 145-pound basketball team play several nights ago,
know that their style is good. Last night Coach Davis persuaded a group
squad to practice with his men and not only did the tyros give the weight
men a good work-out, but the intramural five won. Phey were heavier
and had practiced almost as long.
Last year such a possibility would have been almost unbelievable.
Those in control of Stanford athletics have succeeded in quite a task.
