# FRESHMEN HAVE LARGE APPETITES; LIKE LATE SLEEP

### 
A report from the office of the
dining hall at Encina discloses the
vicissitudes of the freshman class in
a merciless manner.
That freshmen hate to get up in
the morning has been generally ac
cepted as a fact by everyone, but it
remains for the office report to show
that a cold morning will mean over a
hundred lens freshmen out for break
fast. Many of the frosh never come
down at all to the early morning meal,
The fact that the men miss break
fast, however, does not indicate any
reluctance on their part, to eat, or a
delicate condition of the freshman ap
petite.
Look over this list of food for one
meal and marvel at the capacity of
the individual: One hundred dozen
rolls, one hundred pies, thirty gallons
of milk, twenty gallons of cream, six
sacks of potatoes, ten pounds of coffee,
with the other items in proportion.
The freshman destructive complex
combined with an insatiable desire
for souvenirs has proved to be ex
pensive to the members of the hall.
The expense accounts for the hall
shows that unreasonable proportions
of the students' money goes for the
breakage of equipment. Last year
silverware amounting to $456.68 was
unaccounted for. Glass and china
breakage during the year amounted
to ?2724.77 and it can be quite safely

stated that the dining hall has fur
nished glasses for a majority of the
rooms in the dormitory.
Attendance to meals during the
week-ends decreases, the records
show, with the regular migration of
bay students home for Saturday and
Sunday.
Largest attendance is found on
Thursday evening when the dessert is
ice-cream.
