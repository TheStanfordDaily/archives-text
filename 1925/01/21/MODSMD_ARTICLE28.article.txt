DEAR EDITOR—
It is rumored that certain athletes
of this university are having all tuition
and expenses paid by their parents,
and not only this, but it is also ru
j niored that some of these athletes
have worked for money during the
summer vacation. Such jobs as pump
ing gasoline, driving automobiles, and
paddling canoes are considered profes
sionalizing because the athlete uses
his athletic ability for gain.
Furthermore it is pretty well con
firmed that great numbers of athletes
have had their expenses paid during
the last few years while traveling to
and from football games, baseball
games, and track meets.
' It is not only in athletics that pro
fessionalism is rife. For instance we
have the professional professor, pro
fessional eaters, professional sleepers,
professional snakes, professional pho
nograph players, professional apple
polishers, professional dumbells, and
professional tanks.
The writer has inside information
from a very reliable source at Cali
fornia that Ernie Nevers, captain of
next year's football team, played tag
for half a minute when he was six
years old and then received five cents
from his uncle to buy candy.
Is queening a profession, a habit,
or an affliction?
Does an athlete receiving a letter
with a two-cent stamp in it from his
best girl constitute professionalism?
Why not declare everybody intelligi
ble to study?
(s chewing gum a professional
pastime?
It is rumored that any athlete re
ceiving a nickel back from the quarter
he paid for a choc malt will be de
clared a professional.
It is reported that many athletes
have been induced to come to Stanford
by offers of free speech and free blank
checks.
If using your athletic skill for gain
is professionalism, what about the
jolly-ups? —M. D. E.

R. P. wants something done about.
Citizenship. He says that he will be
unable to stand further expense to
cure bunions induced by the Assembly
hall's foot-pinching seats.

An unfortunate youth was Louis Mc-
Clusion;
Whose habit was jumping at every J
conclusion;
He jumped at a mules,
Which ended the fool's
Sad and peculiar delusion.

Does the word "Snake" owe its use
to the fact that snakes are supposed
to be able to hypnotize chickens?

DEAR EDITOR—
It is rumored that certain athletes
of this university are having all tuition
and expenses paid by their parents,
and not only this, but it is also ru
j niored that some of these athletes
have worked for money during the
summer vacation. Such jobs as pump
ing gasoline, driving automobiles, and
paddling canoes are considered profes
sionalizing because the athlete uses
his athletic ability for gain.
Furthermore it is pretty well con
firmed that great numbers of athletes
have had their expenses paid during
the last few years while traveling to
and from football games, baseball
games, and track meets.
' It is not only in athletics that pro
fessionalism is rife. For instance we
have the professional professor, pro
fessional eaters, professional sleepers,
professional snakes, professional pho
nograph players, professional apple
polishers, professional dumbells, and
professional tanks.
The writer has inside information
from a very reliable source at Cali
fornia that Ernie Nevers, captain of
next year's football team, played tag
for half a minute when he was six
years old and then received five cents
from his uncle to buy candy.
