# THE 						AISLE SEAT
## 
### 
("The Man Who Came Back" —Stanford
Theatre—
The flood of humor released un
| consciously by the producer at the
same time the film was shown almost
! immersed us, even in the very back
seat which we obtained. It started with
the flashing on the screen of a beau
tiful little message to the spectators,
"If this picture will teach a lesson to
only one of those who see it, I shall
feel amply repaid for my efforts in
making it," and the stream never
stopped.
At points of crucial interest, little
j tid-bits of valuable information, such
las, "It is 3150: miles from New York
'to San Francisco," would provide an
i intriguing thought. We hadn't realized
just how much we needed brushing
up on our geography. And we also
learned a three-letter word meaning
| to find out.
The story is the old one of the
prodigal son. The drunkard son of a
Wall king is turned out by the
old gent. Shipped to San Francisco
(3150 miles away) to work in a ship
yard, he continues his booze-fighting
activities. The acquaintance of an hon
est dancing girl, who loves him ex
ceedingly, does not stop forgery, etc.
Father's money keeps him out of jail
but also shanghais him to Shanghai.
There he drops and drops, until he
meets the aforesaid poor but honest
girl, who by this time has turned to
dope. Making a compact to swear off,
he fights his way back to thfe great
path of respectability with her help.
Father finally takes him back.
But here the big catch comes in.
Here we learn that the girl has been
in constant communication with the
old man in her attempts to reform the
erring youth. And so she didn't take
dope at all!
Now this we resented a great deal.
Imagine, here we were led into think
ing that the girl, played by Dorothy
Mackail, had also been reformed by
the efforts of the youth, George
O'Brien, and it is so obviously hinted
that she never had at all. It may
satisfy the conventions, but it is
hardly what might be called good
drama. —D. T. R.

(3150 miles away) to work in a ship
yard, he continues his booze-fighting
activities. The acquaintance of an hon
est dancing girl, who loves him ex
ceedingly, does not stop forgery, etc.
Father's money keeps him out of jail
but also shanghais him to Shanghai.
There he drops and drops, until he
meets the aforesaid poor but honest
girl, who by this time has turned to
dope. Making a compact to swear off,
he fights his way back to thfe great
path of respectability with her help.
Father finally takes him back.
But here the big catch comes in.
Here we learn that the girl has been
in constant communication with the
old man in her attempts to reform the
erring youth. And so she didn't take
dope at all!
Now this we resented a great deal.
Imagine, here we were led into think
ing that the girl, played by Dorothy
Mackail, had also been reformed by
the efforts of the youth, George
O'Brien, and it is so obviously hinted
that she never had at all. It may
satisfy the conventions, but it is
hardly what might be called good
drama. —D. T. R.
