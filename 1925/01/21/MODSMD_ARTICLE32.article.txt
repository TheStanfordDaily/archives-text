### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Ben O'Sickey made the most sensational leap on skates ever recorded when
he safely shot through the air over thirteen barrels at Saranac Lake last year?
O'Sickey is a professional skater in Cleveland, and was able to jump 27 feet
on the ice by attaining a tremendous speed before taking off. Other men who
have set records at barrel jumping on skates are Ed Lamy, called the World's
Champion Barrel Jumper, and T. Karl Milne.
R. H. Corbett made a golf score that has never been equaled in a tournament
when he shot nine holes in 27, getting a three at each hole? This occurred in
the semi-final of the Tangye cup tournament at Mullim in 1916. Par for the
nine holes is 35. How's that, you duffers!
All the balls tossed during the annual tournament of the American Bowling
Congress travel a distance equal to more than twice the world's circumferance?
It has been estimated that 1,800,000 balls are used and that the 56 pin boys
handle 37,668,750 pounds of maple ten-pins during the various events.
