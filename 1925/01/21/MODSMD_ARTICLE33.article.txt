# LEMOS ANNOUNCES NEW ARRANGEMENTS IN CAMPUS DISPLAYS
## 
### 
Several changes have been made in
the Stanford Museum and the Thomas
Welton Stanford Art Gallery during
the last few years looking toward
making the two exhibits more inter
esting.
The Museum has reorganized sev
eral of the collections, making them
more related, and plans are now an
nounced by Curator Pedro J. Lemos
which anticipate a rearrangement of
the entire exhibits.
New California Room
A new room has been started which
is termed the California room, in which
material related to California's ro
mantic historical development is being
gathered, material particularly related
to this section. It is the curator's hope
that in time many things of interest
and artistic value for this room will
be acquired.
Another room is to be a display re
flecting the living and crafts of the
early American period. Many objects
have already been acquired by loan
and donation for this room.
School children when accompanied
by teachers are permitted to visit the
Museum free of charge. Each year,
many groups from peninsula schools
enter the building and express appre
ciation for the opportunity.
Extension Desired
Among the plans the Museum direc
tory hopes to bring about are these:
Circuit exhibits for surrounding towns,
placing material bearing upon subjects
under current discussion in the Mu
seum and stimulation of the collecting
habit among students at Stanford.
By establishment of the Art Gallery
seven years ago, a conecting link be
tween the Museum and the public was
established. Art Gallery and Museum
are now under one management, and
thus activities of both buildings are
inter-related. Collections have been
made from the Museum cases and
shown at the Art Gallery and exhibi
tions from other sources shown at the
Art Gallery have brought similar col
lections to the Museum.
Wisconsin University is celebrating
its seventy-fifth anniversary this year.
