# Ticket Sale Opens Tomorrow Morning in Preparation For Heavy Demand
## 
### 
Tickets for the Stanford-Oxford de
bate will be on sale at Crandall's all
day tomorrow and at the Administra
tion building after 1 p.m., at the price
of 35 c6nts for all seats. Students with
A. S. S. U. cards will be admitted
without charge.
This announcement, involving a rad
ical change of plans, was made this
morning by the Stanford debate com
mittee in order that the rush for tick
ets at the door might be avoided. Re
ports from U. S. C. and California,
where the Oxford team has appeared
this week, cause the committee to
make preparations for handling a full
house tomorrow night. In Los Angeles
the hall was completely sold out five
days before the night of the debate.
