# NEVADA OPENS 2-GAME SERIES WITH CARD FIVE HERE TOMORROW NIGHT
## WOLF PACK IS STRONGER Experienced Veteran Players Make Sage-Brushers Formidable Team 
### 
Stanford basketball fans will be
treated to the first real exciting bas
ketball game of the season tomorrow
and Saturday nights when the Nevada
Wolfpack—which comes from Reno
with a reputation and a column of stars
—invades the University campus for
a two-game series.
Early season performances show the
Nevada squad to possess some real
tough veteran material, experienced
and with a string of victories to its
credit.
The Reno five holds victories over
the Y. M. I. and Ellery Arms teams of
San Francisco. The former quintet lost
to the Sage-brushers by scores of
27 to 13 and 31 to 19, while the Arms
live lost by scores of 41 to 28 and 36
to 19.
Billy Goudale, forward on the Wolf
squad, came to Stanford with his team
last year, and if there ever was a for
ward who made the Cards jump, Gou
dale is one. He is playing his second
year of varsity basketball.
Fredericks Again
Ray Fredericks at the other forward
position has some of the same quali
ties which make Goudale a dangerous
man. Watson, standing guard, and
Friend, center, are two other regulars.
The real veteran of the Nevada out
fit is "Spud" Harrison, star football
player, who is playing his fourth year
at basketball at Nevada. He is an all
around man at the game and capable
of filling any position from forward to
standing guard.
Nevada Loses Last Year
Last season Nevada made a poor
showing against Stanford, losing a
two-game series 2S to 13 and 30 to 10.
But with practically the same squad
on tab, and with Stanford the less-
experienced it is hard to predict such
overwhelming victories for Stanford
this year. "Spud" Harrison, playing
center, was the star of these contests
last year, and Fredericks ranked sec
ond. With these two veterans back on
the team it looks like Nevada had the
odds, possessing two consistent
scorers.
There is no need of saying that
Stanford is gradually and steadily im
proving. Every game strengthens the
five and it has reached a point where
the early-season doubts are rapidly
disappearing.
In the first place Andy Kerr's worry
about a center has taken on a less
serious shade. Harry Shipkey seems
to be taking care of that job satisfac-

torily and with Anderson and Jayred
to assist, should perform creditably
the rest of the season.
Ted Shipkey looms up as another
possible substitute for running guard, j
Shipkey has not quite acquired Mit
chell's form, but with more experience
he should develop rapidly.

torily and with Anderson and Jayred
to assist, should perform creditably
the rest of the season.
Ted Shipkey looms up as another
possible substitute for running guard, j
Shipkey has not quite acquired Mit
chell's form, but with more experience
he should develop rapidly.
Stanford basketball fans will be
treated to the first real exciting bas
ketball game of the season tomorrow
and Saturday nights when the Nevada
Wolfpack—which comes from Reno
with a reputation and a column of stars
—invades the University campus for
a two-game series.
Early season performances show the
Nevada squad to possess some real
tough veteran material, experienced
and with a string of victories to its
credit.
The Reno five holds victories over
the Y. M. I. and Ellery Arms teams of
San Francisco. The former quintet lost
to the Sage-brushers by scores of
27 to 13 and 31 to 19, while the Arms
live lost by scores of 41 to 28 and 36
to 19.
Billy Goudale, forward on the Wolf
squad, came to Stanford with his team
last year, and if there ever was a for
ward who made the Cards jump, Gou
dale is one. He is playing his second
year of varsity basketball.
Fredericks Again
Ray Fredericks at the other forward
position has some of the same quali
ties which make Goudale a dangerous
man. Watson, standing guard, and
Friend, center, are two other regulars.
The real veteran of the Nevada out
fit is "Spud" Harrison, star football
player, who is playing his fourth year
at basketball at Nevada. He is an all
around man at the game and capable
of filling any position from forward to
standing guard.
Nevada Loses Last Year
Last season Nevada made a poor
showing against Stanford, losing a
two-game series 2S to 13 and 30 to 10.
But with practically the same squad
on tab, and with Stanford the less-
experienced it is hard to predict such
overwhelming victories for Stanford
this year. "Spud" Harrison, playing
center, was the star of these contests
last year, and Fredericks ranked sec
ond. With these two veterans back on
the team it looks like Nevada had the
odds, possessing two consistent
scorers.
There is no need of saying that
Stanford is gradually and steadily im
proving. Every game strengthens the
five and it has reached a point where
the early-season doubts are rapidly
disappearing.
In the first place Andy Kerr's worry
about a center has taken on a less
serious shade. Harry Shipkey seems
to be taking care of that job satisfac-
