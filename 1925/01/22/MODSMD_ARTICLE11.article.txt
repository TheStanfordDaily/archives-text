# "YOU AND I" PLAYERS WORK HARD FOR PERFECTION
## PLAY JUST IN MAKING Virginia Graves, Marjorie Allen, Velma Randall In Leading Roles 
### Velva Darling 
t "You and I," Barry's clever comedy
i drama scheduled for January 30th, is
j beginning to take on the semblance of
I a highly interesting production, due
jto the combined efforts of Gordon
Davis and the cast.
At present the play is just in the
! making, and every night means a con
! tinued grind, grind, grind, perfecting
little details, acting on a bare empty
| stage, without scenery, or props of any
kind, to make life interesting—all this
in order that the audience may enjoy
for one glorious evening the finished
production with us clever dialogues—
the cleverest that have been written
since Oscar Wilde's time —from the
lips of the campus' handsomest men
and most sparkling women!
One of the most delightful situa
tions of the play is the acting of
Velma Randall when she is asked by
an artist to pose for a portrait. As a
maid, a beautiful maid, to whom verbal
expression is extremely difficult, and
to whom posing has always meant
"pas en robe," as it were, she is ex
quisite.
Leonard Schwartz, as the artist who
gave up painting for love, is outstand
ing for the excellence of his work in
a part which must be both emotional
and restrained. To let the audience
know the "tumult within himself"
while appearing casual is one of the
most difficult feats of dramatic tech
nique. Under the direction of Gordon
Davis, however, Leonard Schwartz will
accomplish it.
Virginia Graves, in the role of an
older woman, subdues her vivacity ad
mirably. The fact that the energy is
there, however makes it possible for
her to give a sparkle to her lines
which makes them wholly alive. This,
combined with the wit given them by
the author, produces a fascinating re
sult.
