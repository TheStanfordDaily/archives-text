the win of the Japanese Club over the

day in running up a 17 to 10 score
over Delta Upsilon.
Scores of the remaining games were:
Phi Gamma Delta 6, Alpha Tau Omega

In the first game of the day Break

The Japanese Club upset the dope
in the evening by trimming the Encina
2W five 9 to 4, after the freshmen had
been favored to win. After the Encina
five had pressed the Japs close in the
first half, good work by Mizota,
Murata, and Kitow pulled their team
through to a win.
