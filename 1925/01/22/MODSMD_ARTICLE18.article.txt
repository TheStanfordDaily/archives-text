# STANFORD SPEAKERS TO DERATE ENGLISHMEN ON PROHIBITION TONIGHT
## AUDIENCE WILL JUDGE Britishers Conceded to Be Leading Exponents of Informal System 
### Al Post 
When Stanford meets Oxford at 8
o'clock tonight on the Assembly hall
debating platform three leading Ameri
j can speakers will be pitted against a
like number of able exponents of the
British system of debate.
"Resolved, that this House is op
posed to the principles prohibition"
is the subject. Oxford will defend the
affirmative and Stanfgord the nega
tive. At the conclusion of the debate
the audience will be asked to vote
either for or against prohibition â€”not
for the winning team. President Wil
bur will act as chairman.
J. D. Woodruff, M. C. Hollis, and M.
J. Mac Donald compose the team from
Oxford University. S. A. Weigel, R. E.
Lewis, and It. C. Littler will represent
Stanford. The men will probably speak
in the order named, but there may be
last-minute changes in both line-ups.
Main speeches will be from seventeen
to twenty minutes in length, and extra
time will be allowed for refutation.
Full House Expected
Holders of A. S. S. U. cards will be
admitted without charge. Others will
be required to pay a fee of thirty-five
cents. The balcony will be reserved for
the paid admissions. In view of the
crowds which turned out to hear the
English invaders in Los Angeles and
Berkeley, students are urged to come
early. Scalpers in the southern city
found a ready sale for tickets at $5.
Should the seating capacity of the
Assembly hall be overtaxed the over
flow will probably be accommodated
in the Little Theatre, and the debaters
will go there to repeat their speeches.
The members of the Oxford team are
men of importance in their own coun
try. J. D. Woodruff was born in Kent,
England, and educated by the Benedic
tine order of monks. He was a scholar
at New College, Oxford, from which
he graduated with high honors in mod
ern history. He is affiliated with the
Liberal party in politics, and is ex
president of the Oxford Liberal Club
and of the Union Debating Society.
Mac Donald Parliament Candidate
M. C. Hollis claims Asebridge, Sur
rey, England, as his birthplace. He
was educated first at Eton, one of the
most famous boys' preparatory schools
of the British Isles, and later in
Balliol College, Oxford. He was presi
dent of the Union in 1923, and a mem
ber of the Liberal party.
M. J. Mac Donald, son of the former
British premier, is a native of Lossie
mouth, Scotland, and received his A.B.
from Balliol College, Oxford, in 1923.

j Last year he lost out by the margin of
