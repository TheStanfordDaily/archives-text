# ALUMNUS READS OF CARD-NOTRE DAME CONTEST IN PARIS
## 
### 
In view of the fact that many of
the Stanford Alumni, as well as some
of the students, are of the belief that
Stanford does not receive the publicity
due her in regard to football and the
like, word has been received from an
alumnus in Rome showing wherein
Stanford is internationally well-known.
He inclosed an article from "The Paris
Times" (a new English-language paper
published in Paris) in which five col
umns were devoted to news relating
to the Stanford-Notre Dame game. In
addition to this there was a full pic
ture of Captain Jim Lawson and a
panel of "Tiny" Tliornhill, "Pop" War
ner, and Andy Kerr. This alumnus also
added that "hardly a day passes but
what some Stanford news is published
in one of the Paris papers."
Even Holland was reached on New
Year's Day. Just yesterday a letter
was received from a radio fan in Hol
land who had listened in on the Stan
ford-Notre Dame game. He picked it
up from a station in East Pittsburg,
KDKA, that was giving out the scores.
This was at A:4O p.m., their time,
which equals 3:20 Pacific time. Al
though this fan has some Stanford
connections he did not know that there
was to be such a game until he picked
it up on the radio.
