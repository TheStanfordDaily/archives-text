# FRESHMAN BASEBALL TEAM LOOMS STRONG AS 1925 CHAMPIONS
## 
### 
With barely two weeks' pjractice to j
its credit the first-year baseball team
is showing exceptional early-season
form. Thirty-one names are now on
the list of aspirants.
"Husky" Hunt took time off from his
basketball squad yesterday ajjternoon i
and gave his diamond stars the first
once over of the season. Previous to
this time the freshmen have been prac- j
ticing under the supervision of Harry i
Wolter.
Wednesday afternoon at 3:30' the
yearlings will oppose the Palo Alto
town team in their first scheduled
game of the season. With the wealth j
of material that is out it should not,
be difficult for the freshmen to throw
a winning combination together.
To begin with they have four excel- j
lent men to form the nucleus of their i
nine, and these men are distributed j
evenly over the diamond. Phillipi is a j
pitcher, Sypher a catcher, Garibaldi an
infielder, and McGuire an outfielder.;
A team with these men for a backbone j
should prove a hard one to beat.
Phillipi has only been striving to
get the kinks out of his arm for the
he will be a valuable man when he ,
hits his stride. His most effective de- j
last few days, but it is obvious that
livery is his sidearm one that kept [
the varsity men guessing in a practice
game yesterday afternoon.
Sypher is being pushed for his post
behind the plate by a new arrival on
the diamond, Nelson. Sypher, however,
is showing himself to be slightly
superior to his rival. Both of these
men are good batters.
Garibaldi should have little trouble
in landing the second base position.;
He handles himself well, and although I
he is not a hard hitter he is a con-1
.sistent one.
McGuire, an outfielder, will place
fear in the heart of many a pitcher
during the season. He not only hits
hard but hits accurately and with
regularity. Another heavy hitter and
also an outfielder is Simmons.
Bush, who is a candidate for short
stop, despite an evident lack of ex
perience, has a quick movement and a
good arm. He looks like the logical
man for this berth. Thompson is the
only first baseman that has been mak
ing much of a showing.

and gave his diamond stars the first
once over of the season. Previous to
this time the freshmen have been prac- j
ticing under the supervision of Harry i
Wolter.
Wednesday afternoon at 3:30' the
yearlings will oppose the Palo Alto
town team in their first scheduled
game of the season. With the wealth j
of material that is out it should not,
be difficult for the freshmen to throw
a winning combination together.
To begin with they have four excel- j
lent men to form the nucleus of their i
nine, and these men are distributed j
evenly over the diamond. Phillipi is a j
pitcher, Sypher a catcher, Garibaldi an
infielder, and McGuire an outfielder.;
A team with these men for a backbone j
should prove a hard one to beat.
Phillipi has only been striving to
get the kinks out of his arm for the
he will be a valuable man when he ,
hits his stride. His most effective de- j
last few days, but it is obvious that
livery is his sidearm one that kept [
the varsity men guessing in a practice
game yesterday afternoon.
Sypher is being pushed for his post
behind the plate by a new arrival on
the diamond, Nelson. Sypher, however,
is showing himself to be slightly
superior to his rival. Both of these
men are good batters.
Garibaldi should have little trouble
in landing the second base position.;
He handles himself well, and although I
he is not a hard hitter he is a con-1
.sistent one.
McGuire, an outfielder, will place
fear in the heart of many a pitcher
during the season. He not only hits
hard but hits accurately and with
regularity. Another heavy hitter and
also an outfielder is Simmons.
Bush, who is a candidate for short
stop, despite an evident lack of ex
perience, has a quick movement and a
good arm. He looks like the logical
man for this berth. Thompson is the
only first baseman that has been mak
ing much of a showing.
