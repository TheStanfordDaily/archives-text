# A 						Test
## 
### 
The Stanford debaters meet a real test tonight when they face the
Oxford team. The real test is not to win the debate, but rather to make
a showing worthy of the time and effort that has been expended to make
debating a first-class activity on the campus.
The audience-decision has done much to popularize debate. The topic,
and the prestige of the Oxford men combined tonight will probably draw
a full house. It is a golden opportunity for the Stanford men to capture
the elusive student interest, and perhaps more undergraduates will be in
the audience at future debates, among the Palo Alto people.
The center of interest in debate has shifted from the contest idea of
winning or losing, to the more fundamental conception of giving the topic
a fair, thorough consideration. —R. L. S.
