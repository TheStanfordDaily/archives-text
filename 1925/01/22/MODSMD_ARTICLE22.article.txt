# Honor Among Bookmen
## 
### 
During the Christmas vacation, men connected with the Library made
a survey of the fraternities and halls on the campus, thinking that possibly
they might pick up a few library books which somebody had been forget
ting to return. They were right. From the halls they took 50 books,
which they found laying in plain sight in the rooms. Then they went up
the Row, and found 145.
There was this difference. The books found in the halls had almost
all been charged—that is, they were simply overdue. The books found in
the fraternities, almost without exception, were shown by Library records
to be still in the Library. That is, they had been "borrowed," and the
factor of time turns "borrows" like that into steals.
It is not primarily the Library which suffers. The books are used by
the student body, and if they are not available it is the students who bear
the brunt. For a man to remove a book from circulation in this way is,
first of all, selfishness with regard to his fellows.
It is only a step from the Quad to the Library, but in many ways it
appears that the Honor System does not make that step. Library abuses
are several and varied, with students the greatest but not the only offenders.
For instance, the absent-minded professor may assign a certain book,
forgetting that he has a copy of that book in his study. There may be
only a few copies, and the class has to fight for them. Faculty members
have practically unlimited Library privileges, and it is no uncommon thing
for a professor to bring in an armload of books, some dating back to 1920
or 1921. Few of these are in active demand, but usually someone has been
trying for some of them, and in vain.
The students themselves work against one another in all sorts of selfish
and not very petty ways. Take, for instance, a book assigned to a large
class, with four copies in the Library. "Hour cards" for each copy are
placed at the Loan Desk, and students have been known to sign for a dif
ferent hour on each card, thereby getting a four-hour crack at the book
in a single day and helping somebody else to flunk out.
Worse than this are the people who sign other names on these cards—
names whose owners will not be near the Library. Then they hang about
the desk, and at five minutes after the hour they claim the book. Selfish
ness? It's that, and crookedness too. And the Library does not suffer at
all —the students do all that. It is good training for one who intends to be
a professional grafter, but poor citizenship.
Others have been known to take out a book on this hour card system,
use it all morning, and hide it in the racks at lunch time. Then they come
back and use it all afternoon. Of course, in a case like this the Library
knows, and fines the guilty person, but the situation is helped very little.
In the meantime the other signers of the hour card have been losing out.
The Library, and certain assigned books, are essential parts of many
courses in the University. In common fairness these books should be
shared, and such selfish abuses as these are violations not only of the Honor
System but of the signed contract which every student makes with the
Library. A little thought should also make clear the fact that they aren't
even ordinarily decent. >
A close check on offenders, with subsequent drastic action by the
Student Councils, would reward the guilty and might eventually benefit
the innocent sackholders. But in such a community as this, discipline
ought not to be necessary. Perhaps the selfish ones will realize that they
have been selfish.
