A beautiful girl and a fine man
walked out of the chapel yesterday
afternoon at 3:30 —married! One is a
Senior, the other a Junior. Both are
to be congratulated, Emily Post to the
contrary or not. Stanford is proud of
them. Long may they live —and the
best of luck! We're glad.
This contribution from a member of
the Freshman Class, a girl, is too good
to suppress:
"A knob is a protrusion of idiosyn
cracy from the surface of the ego.
"A freshman is a person whose in
ternal countenance is literally covered
with these warts.
"College life may be defined as the
process of extirpation of these person
al protuberances. When a compara
tively large number of freshmen oc
cupy a comparatitvely small number
of cubic feet their knobs collide and
rub and bump against each other.
"This constant friction gradually

wears down the knobs until the sur
face of the personality is smooth and
polished;
•—and behold! a typical college guy!"
Little Rollo, that's wonderful!
In fact, to quote a most plebian per
son :
"The right to be a cussed fool
Is safe to all devices human;
It's common (ez a gen'l rule)
To every critter born of woman."
We are referring to the peculiar
people who LIKE to "bump and col
lide" with others under the delusion
that they are growing more perfect by ;
becoming more smooth.
As a matter of fast, it is the person I
who can retain the most bumps who
is the success.
Somehow, a nice, polished "inner \
counfenace" is about as enticing as a |
jelly fish.

A goodly number of —not only in- ;
ternal —bumps should receive a fair
polish between now and February 13. j
Ram's Head rehearsals have begun.
Ah, well ....
"One seeks in vain the recompense, i

For youth, for charm, 'espirit!'
Ah, it is al so sad, so true,
. . . 'Personne chez lui'!"
(That is easy French; use a dic
tionary! )
