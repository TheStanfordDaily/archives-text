# MAGNETO HEADLIGHT EQUIPMENT ON FORDS GOOD UNTIL MARCH 1
## 
### 
Owners of cars equipped with head
lighting systems operating from the
magneto have been given until March
1 to have their equipment changed
over to comply with the requirements
of the present California law, the
California State Automobile Associa
tion anounced today following a recent
conference with Will H. Marsh, chief
of the Division of Motor Vehicles.
Owing to the possibility of working
a hardship on owners of such cars and
in order to allow the owners time to
have the work done properly, Marsh
has instructed all state traffic officers
to delay the enforcement of this part
of the headlight law until March 1.
However, he told Automobile Associa
tion officials today that no car would
be permitted to operate in California
after that date with lights operated
off the magneto.
Owners of such cars, the Automo
bile Association announced today, can
comply with the law by having their
lighting system changed over to stor
age battery type or by substituting
acetylene equipment for what they
have at present.
