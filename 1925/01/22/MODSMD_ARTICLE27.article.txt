## 
### 
Dairies of England are contemplat
ing the foundation of scholarships in
certain agricultural colleges as a re
sult of a war-time mistake.
In 1919 a tax of two pence a gallon
was erroneously imposed on all milk
exported from the southwestern coun
ties to other parts of England.
The dairies recovered the money by
legal action, and now plan to devote
the sum of $150,000 to scholarships
which will benefit mainly the sons of
the milk producers of those countries.
