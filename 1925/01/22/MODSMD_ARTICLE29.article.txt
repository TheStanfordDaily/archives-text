# Encina Gymnasium Will Be Beautified by Shrubs
## 
### 
A new unit of the proposed system
of gardens on the Stanford campus is
being developed in front of the Encina
gymnasium. This unit of the gardens
has been under consideration for some
time, but the incomplete facade of the
gymnasium has rendered the realiza
tion of the scheme impossible before i
this time. The c&mpletion of the new
wing of the gymnasium during this
last summer, however, makes the
j front of the building complete, and the
triangular space left vacant is now
being laid out in convenient paths, and
will soon be planted with low shrub-
;bery.
Water basketball is one of the fea
tures this year in intramural sports
at Northwestern University.
