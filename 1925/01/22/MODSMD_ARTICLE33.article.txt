# Myrra Heaves Javelin 199 Feet in Exhibitions
## 
### 
Johnnie Myrra, world's title-holder
in the javelin event, showed his ability
before the gymnasium classes yester
day afternoon by throwing the spear a
fraction of an inch less than 200 feet.
His best throw was 199 feet % inch.
Although last night was Myrra's first
time in a suit this year, he showed
perfect form in all his throws. He did
not strain himself in order to get bet
ter distance, because of the earliness
of the season. A crowd of three or
four hundred students turned out to
watch the record-holder perform.
More than sixty-eight per cent of
those who graduated from the engi
neering college at Ohio State Univer
sity last year were placed in their
field of business by the college.
