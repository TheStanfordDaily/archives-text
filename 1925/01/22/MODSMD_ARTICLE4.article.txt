# OPEN FORUM TREATS CAMPUS VIOLATIONS OF PROHIBITION ACT
## 
### 
At the Open Forum meeting of the
Euphronia Debating Society, held last
night in the Lobby of the Old Union,
the main question, "To what extent is
j government regulation against liquor
drinking violated by Stanford stu
dents?" was dismissed by the state
ment of Dean Culver's that "drinking
is not a problem at Stanford today,
and present conditions do not demand
immediate action on the subject," and
developed into a discussion of the
course of action that students should
follow when confronted by a violation
of the national act.
The general consensus of opinion in
regard to this question was that a
student confronted by such a violation
should act according to his own discre
tion, that is, report on obnoxious case
to the Men's Council, but should there
be any doubt or scarcitly of evidence,
use his own discretion.
This last point was stressed by all
the speakers of the evening. Dean Cul
ver, when asked to give his opinion
on liquor drinking violations, said that
"the course of action that a student
should follow is a matter of con
science, that all should use their judg
ment before reporting a case."
John C. Duniway, alternate on the
Stanford squad for the Oxford-Stan
ford debate, the other formal speaker
of the evening, said that "certain
tolerance, common sense, and reason
ableness should be used in enforcing
even such an ironclad act as the Vol
stead Act."
A1 Charles, chairman of the Men's
Council, gave an extemperaneous view
point stressing the same conclusion.
"The Men's Council is anxious to con
sider all obnoxious cases because of
the general result such cases have on
the University, but it does not want
cases of thin evidence. If a person
wants to be a policeman, let him be
so for himself, and if his own conduct
is that of a Stanford man, the Council
is satisfied."
