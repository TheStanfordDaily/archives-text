# Women's Block "S" Society Plans Play for Spring
## 
### 
Plans for a play to be given on
March 7 were discussed recently by
the Women's Block "S" society at
their weekly supper. The date has
been granted but nothing definite will
be decided, until a suitable play is
found.
The Fiesta Lagunita, a biennial
event, is not being given this year,
and the proposed play, which would
be open to women only, would take its
place. It will be given in the Little
Theatre, not in the, Assembly hall, and
the proceeds will go towards founding
a scholarship for women.
