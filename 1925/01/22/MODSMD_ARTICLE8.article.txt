# YEARLING FIVE DOWNS LICK-WILMERDING IN A FAST GAME 20 TO 17
## DENNIS AND MOORE STAR Smith, Lick-Wilmerding Man, Does Most of Scoring For Visitors 
### 
Playing a nip and tuck game througli
j out, the freshman basketball aggrega
tion downed the Liclt-Wilmerding quin
tet by a 17 to 20 score in the pavilion
last night.
Only one field goal and a foul were
scored in the first quarter. These tal
! lies were counted for the high school
combination when Smith made a long
shot from the center of the floor and
when later Nelson converted a foul.
First Half Ragged
During this entire period the babes
could not hit the basket and many
times they missed the backboard. How
ever, on the first few plays of the
next period they got under way im
mediately and built up the score to
9-3.
Denis was high point man for the
freshmen during this rally and fol
lowed the ball well. Moore at forward
was unable to sink any of his many
shots and was replaced by Snyde. At
the same time Nye went in for Vin
centi, Crist for Clark, and Bigelow for
Reynolds.
Crist is a small stocky fellow that
shows great prospects. In the game
he covered a great deal of territory
and exhibited a style of piay that Cook
well.
Smith, the Lick-Wilmerding forward,
ended the ftalf by totaling three more
points for his team. Throughout the
game he was high point man, scoring
thirteen of the seventeen piled up by
the high school lads.
Play in the second half was faster
and more points were added. Moore
started off the period by dropping in
a basket right after the tip-off. For a
moment the fray took on the appear
ance of a battle between Clark of
Stanford and Smith, the Lick forward. '
Lick Leads Half
Each took turns shooting two goals
apiece and then got mad at each other.
As a result of their argument, the
referee called a double foul and both j
made the point, leaving the score at
the end of the third quarter, Lick-
Wilmerding 15 and Stanford 14.
The real battle took place in the \
final period. Each team took turns in ;
holding a two-point lead until Moore i
dropped in two goals in succession
and left the final score 20 to 17 in
Stanford's favor.
The result of this contest leaves the
babes with a brighter outlook. The
Lick-Wilmerding coach is a former
California man and runs his team on ,
the same principal and with the same
style of play. This gave the first-year j
men a chance to work out against the
Blue and Gold system for the first
time.
Coach "Husky" Hunt has had an
other big turnout in response to a call
for more freshman material but has
only kept a few after one day's work
out. At present he has sixteen men
signed up and working every after
noon.
Quite a few of these are men that
were formerly cut from the squad but
the realization that they were once
cut seems to have its effect on their
playing. Men that formerly showed
nothing are now proving to be fairly
good material for the team.
One of the new finds is Biaginni
who played standing guard for awhile
in the game last night. Mike Reynolds
is showing considerable improvement
at the same position and started last
night.
The full starting line-up was:
Stanford (20) Lick-Wilmerding (17)
C. Moore (6) F Mathesen (2)
Vincenti (2) F Smith (13)

and more points were added. Moore
started off the period by dropping in
a basket right after the tip-off. For a
moment the fray took on the appear
ance of a battle between Clark of
Stanford and Smith, the Lick forward. '
Lick Leads Half
Each took turns shooting two goals
apiece and then got mad at each other.
As a result of their argument, the
referee called a double foul and both j
made the point, leaving the score at
the end of the third quarter, Lick-
Wilmerding 15 and Stanford 14.
The real battle took place in the \
final period. Each team took turns in ;
holding a two-point lead until Moore i
dropped in two goals in succession
and left the final score 20 to 17 in
Stanford's favor.
The result of this contest leaves the
babes with a brighter outlook. The
Lick-Wilmerding coach is a former
California man and runs his team on ,
the same principal and with the same
style of play. This gave the first-year j
men a chance to work out against the
Blue and Gold system for the first
time.
Coach "Husky" Hunt has had an
other big turnout in response to a call
for more freshman material but has
only kept a few after one day's work
out. At present he has sixteen men
signed up and working every after
noon.
Quite a few of these are men that
were formerly cut from the squad but
the realization that they were once
cut seems to have its effect on their
playing. Men that formerly showed
nothing are now proving to be fairly
good material for the team.
One of the new finds is Biaginni
who played standing guard for awhile
in the game last night. Mike Reynolds
is showing considerable improvement
at the same position and started last
night.
The full starting line-up was:
Stanford (20) Lick-Wilmerding (17)
C. Moore (6) F Mathesen (2)
Vincenti (2) F Smith (13)

Playing a nip and tuck game througli

tion downed the Liclt-Wilmerding quin
tet by a 17 to 20 score in the pavilion
last night.
Only one field goal and a foul were
scored in the first quarter. These tal

combination when Smith made a long
shot from the center of the floor and
when later Nelson converted a foul.
First Half Ragged
During this entire period the babes
could not hit the basket and many
times they missed the backboard. How
ever, on the first few plays of the
next period they got under way im
mediately and built up the score to
9-3.
Denis was high point man for the
freshmen during this rally and fol
lowed the ball well. Moore at forward
was unable to sink any of his many
shots and was replaced by Snyde. At
the same time Nye went in for Vin
centi, Crist for Clark, and Bigelow for
Reynolds.
Crist is a small stocky fellow that
shows great prospects. In the game
he covered a great deal of territory
and exhibited a style of piay that Cook
well.
Smith, the Lick-Wilmerding forward,
ended the ftalf by totaling three more
points for his team. Throughout the
game he was high point man, scoring
thirteen of the seventeen piled up by
the high school lads.
Play in the second half was faster
