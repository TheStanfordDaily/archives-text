# NEVADA QUINTET SLATED TO WIN FROM CARD FIVE
## Sagebrushers Reputed to Be Most Powerful Team on Coast This Year 
### 
Between the halves of the Nevada
game tonight Myron Schall and Rollin
Farmin will appear in a three-round
bout. Harry Maloney and "Ike" Har
wood will stage a tussle tomorrow be
tween halves.
Nevada is expecting a victory to
night when the Sagebrush five clashes
with the Cardinals in the pavilion at
8 o'clock. The second game will be at
8 o'clock Saturday in the pavilion.
This is founded on a bit of pub
licity that reached the Daily office re
cently. In the first place the Reno
aggregation boasts three veterans and
two high-class recruits. The three
veterans have, at on time or another,
been captains of the Nevada quintet.
Goodale Star
Captain Goodale, the present season
skipper, plays forward, and was one
of the outstanding stars on the team
iast year. From all reports he has lost
none of his talent.
Card basketball fans do not need an
introduction to "Spud" Harrison, cen
ter, forward, guard, or what-you-will,
who put up such a dandy scrap last
season against Stanford.
Nevada was handicapped last year
because of a strenuous two-game series
with the University of California, just
before the Stanford series. California
last season was no slouch and Nevada
came dangerously close to defeating
the pride of the Bruins.
Fredericks Fast
Fredericks, another ex-skipper, is
the fastest man on the Wild West
â– squad. The aforementioned publicity
calls him the "fastest bit of basketball
talent the University of Nevada has
seen iii the past few years." To which
due credit must be given.
"Little" Friend, standing 6 feet 7
inches in his nude feet, is the most
colorful and newest member of the
squad. He has had quite a bit of
basektball experience on club teams
around Oakland, and is learning the
fundamentals of college basketball
fast.
Watson completes the list. Watson,
some freshman of gone years will re
member, played and starred on a
Sacramento high school team which
played Stanford. To all appearances
he is slated for a steady berth on the
Sagebrush quintet.
Win Four
In the matter of past performances
the Cowboys offer four straight vic
tories for the fans' consideration.
.Two weeks ago the fast Y. M. I.
quintet went down in a two-game
series, and the next victim, the Ellery
Arms five, didn't do much better.
Don't underrate the Y. M. I. team.
Remember it is the team that cleaned
up everything on the Pacific Coast and
in the East last year!
Emmet Bohan, coach of the Ellery
Arms five, says of the Nevada five,
"They will beat every collegiate team
on the coast." Rather broad, but rings
true.
Ted Shipkey is slated to play run
ning guard tomorrow for Stanford, and
Harry Shipkey is a certainty to start
at center.
