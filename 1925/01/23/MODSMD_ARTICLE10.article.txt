# STAR INTRAMURAL COURT FIVES WILL BE SELECTED
## 
### 
Intramural basketball is the latest
sport to fall prey to the attack of all
star-selectionitis. Following the exam
ples of Walter Camp and several thou
sand would-be Walter Camps the coun
try over, Gifford Troyer, intramural
basketball referee and manager, con
sented today to pick, for exclusive pub
lication in the Daily Palo Alto, three
all-star quintets from among the 450-
odd players who are doing their stuff
in the intramural series now in
progress.
Troyer will choose first, second, and
third teams at the conclusion of the
season, and will award honorable men
tion to any remaining players who may
deserve it. He has gained a wide
knowledge of the game from playing
four years of high school and club
basketball.
Physically prevented from continu
ing in active competition at Stanford,
he has nevertheless kept in close
touch with the game.
He has seen in action all of the
forty-eight teams which compose the
intramural league, and hence is well
qualified for the difficult task of mak
ing all-star selections. He will take
into consideration not so much the
flashy type of individual playing as the
ability of men to work with the rest
of the team.
Athletes from the various living

groups will probably be up ori their
toes every minute and put all they
have into the game in an effort to
make one of the mythical fives. Aside
from the honor they may gain from
being selected, they are likely to at
tract the attention of coaches of var
sity, freshman, and weight teams, and
so become prospects for one of these
squads, with a chance of winning a
letter.
In this conection it is interesting to
note that a few days ago an intra
mural quintet met the 145's in a prac
tice clash and came out on top. Longer
practice and better teamwork is what
did it. Many a living group which
boasted a fast team last year is find
ing the going rough this season on ac
count of losing three or four veterans
to the weight or varsity aggregations.
