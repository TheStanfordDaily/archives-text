# Cold Feet Passe as Roughs Visit Roble
## 
### 
For years male visitors to Roble
| have been afflicted with "cold feet."
j Tonight, however, a certain few of
; those who come to the Hall's informal
will be free from the dread affliction
jâ€”but the favored will not be those
on the inside.
| Perhaps because they pity the roughs
as the latter shiver on the outside,
| the management of the hall has made
; arrangements for planks to be laid
I beneath all windows commanding a
| view of the dance floor. While it has
; been reported that this is to protect
| the grass, the roughs believe that for
once their comfort is being considered.
