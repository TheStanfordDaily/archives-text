# 145-POUND QUINTET WILL TANGLE WITH DENTISTS TONIGHT
## 
### 
In a preliminary game to the varsity
event tonight, the Stanford 145-pound
cagers will attempt to fill a prescrip
tion against the Pharmacy Branch of
the University of California. Coach
Hal Davis will need to prescribe a
tight defense for the Cardinal team if
reports about the powerful Druggist
outfit hold true.
Riese, who was recently added to
the lightweight squad from the varsity,
will fit nicely into a forward position
and should bring strength to the of
fensive playing of the team. Blazier
will operate in the other berth and
makes a fit partner.
Stewart will start at center and
Clark and Kunzel at guards. If the first
squad can run up a comfortable lead
Coach Davis will run in a number of
substitutes.
The 145-pound quintet has shown
flashes of clas sso far and if they
develop as they give promise to do,
the California lightweights will run
up against some stiff competition when
they meet next month.
The California games have been set
for February 13 at Berkeley and Feb
ruary 20 at Stanford, as preliminaries
to freshman games.
The 130-pound California games
have been scheduled as proliminaies
to the varsity games on February 14
and 21.
