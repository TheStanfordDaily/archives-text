# STUDENTS VOTE FOR PROHIBITION 730 YES: 228 NO
## Opposing Speakers Exemplify Varied Styles; Assembly Hall Overcrowded 
### Al Post 
Three Oxford and three Stanford
speakers did just what was expected

team as the best would be doing a
gross injustice to the other. "Resolved,
that this House is opposed to the

men were to break down with ridicule
the contentions of the opposition,
while the Stanford reperesentatives
established a case for themselves by
straight, logical argument. However,
Weigel of Stanford attempted to meet
the Britishers on their own ground
with a broadside of banter and sar

sayed the American style with a force

was the idea that drink does more
good than harm by binding together
