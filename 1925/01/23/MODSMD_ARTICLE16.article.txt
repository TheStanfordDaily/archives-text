# STUDENTS VOTE FOR PROHIBITION 730 YES: 228 NO
## Opposing Speakers Exemplify Varied Styles; Assembly Hall Overcrowded 
### Al Post 
Three Oxford and three Stanford
speakers did just what was expected
of them last night by delivering ex
cellent examples of two widely diver
gent styles of debate before an audi
ence which packed the Assembly Hall
to its farthest corners. To crown either
team as the best would be doing a
gross injustice to the other. "Resolved,
that this House is opposed to the
principle of prohibition," was the sub
ject of discussion.
In accordance with the British cus
tom no judges' decision was rendered,
but an audience vote was taken at the
conclusion of the debate showing 730
persons in favor of prohibition and
229 opposed. This was not a vote on
the merits of the debate.
The general tactics of. the Oxford
men were to break down with ridicule
the contentions of the opposition,
while the Stanford reperesentatives
established a case for themselves by
straight, logical argument. However,
Weigel of Stanford attempted to meet
the Britishers on their own ground
with a broadside of banter and sar
casm and Mac Donald of Oxford es
sayed the American style with a force
ful exposition of connected points.
Woodruff Humorist
J. D. Woodruff of the affirmative
kept the audience in a gale of laughter
in the opening speech with a series of
witticisms which could well be in
cluded on any first-class vaudeville
program. Interwoven in all his comedy
was the idea that drink does more
good than harm by binding together
the human race and building up civili
zation. Woodruff believes ,that 'the
evils of drink have been greatly Over
drawn.
Stanley Weigel opened the case for
the negative. After the Englishman
had described the happiness which
"booze" inspires in the partaker, Wei
gel painted in vivid colors the "hang
over" on the "morning after" and the
"dark brown taste."
M. C. Hollis enumerated more of the
benefits of liquor, stating that the af
firmative opposed prohibition solely on
that ground. Admitting that continued
use of the fermented beverage might
shorten life,'lie maintained the drinker
gets proportionately more more pleas
ure out of living during an abbreviated
span of years than does the teetotaller
out of longevity.
Lewis Logical
Robert E. Lewis plunged whole
heartedly into the task of tearing down
the hypotheses of the "wets." In refu
tation of the theory that moderate
drinking is all right Lewis asserted
that it is impossible for a large mass
of people to drink moderately without
creating a liquor traffic, and that the
root of the evil of excessive intoxica
tion cannot be eradicated without de
stroying that traffic.
Malcolm Macdonald emphasized the
point that much legitimate pleasure
and legitimate health can be obtained
from the moderate use of liquor, and
that prohibition forced men to give up
the pursuit of happiness merely for
social efficiency. He also hit the state
ment that crime has decreased since
the eighteenth amendment went into
effect, submitting statistics to the con
trary.
Littler Sums Up
Robert Littler summed up the case
of the negative in the closing speech,
and showed that the Volstead acts was
becoming better observed all the time,
and that the consumption of intoxicat
ing beverages in the United States has
been decreased 74 per cent since the
statute went into effect

Professor William L. Graves of the
English department at Ohio State Uni
versity suggests that football be made
the subject of verse. He thinks Vachel
Lindsay would be suited to the task.
