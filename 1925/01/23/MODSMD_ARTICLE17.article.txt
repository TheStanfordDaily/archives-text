# BABE WATER POLO TEAM TRAINS FOR OLYMPIC JUNIORS
## 
### Fred Speers 
Contenders for berths on the fresh
man water polo team are settling down
to the final week of training before the
date of their return game with the
Olympic Club Juniors rolls around. The
clash will be staged at the Olympic
Club pool in San Francisco on Janu
ary 30.
Though the babes lost the first game
by a 7 to 5 score Brandsten asserts
that so much improvement has been
shown that chances for victory are*
much brighter thiÂ» time than in the
first game.
Though definite playing positions
have not yet been filled there are
several men who are practically cer
tain of being ih action at the start of
the game. Coach Brandsten will select
his team from a squad of twelve men.
Head and shoulders above the can
didates looms Ed Luster, whose pre
vious experience at thia sport stands
him in good stead. He is out for a
center forward position. Because of ill
ness lie did not see action in the first
game of the series.
Vanden Akker is a speedy player
and has had previous experience on
prep school teams. He will play a for
,ward position. Having tasted of con
flict in the first engagement with the
Olympic Club Juniors, Maltby, a tricky
player at guard position, is fairly cer
tain of being in the starting lineup.
Both Ivinkead and Klein were used
in the first game and since then have
been steadily improving and rounding
into shape. Smith, candidate for goal,
will probably see action.
Several new men have shown up for
this sport, chief among whom are
Simons, Lafevre, and Treis. All of
these appear to stand equal chances of
playing.
