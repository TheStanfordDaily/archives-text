# Eskimos and College Education
## 
### 
The Eskimos have a jolly old gastronomical custom where the proud
male lies on his back and allows his female to feed him with tid bits of
walrus blubber and flesh until he is unable to move. Somewhat the same
stuffing process is going on in American universities if Dr. John A.
Cousens, president of Tufts College, is to be believed.
"College faculties must stop trying to stuff students so they may be
inspected on state occasions," declares Dr. Cousens. He also holds that
soon students will be graded on activities outside as well as inside the class
room. Afliletics, journalism, music and drama he considers an integral
part of a college education and as such should be graded.
By the end of this century Dr. Cousens thinks that the alumni will be
actively interested in phases of college work other than athletics. Such a
hopeful man would be a good thing to have around the house.
Thus does one university educator forecast.—Daily A T orthivestern.
Once attracted by the rather startling metaphor used to open the above
editorial, the mind cannot help lingering awhile over the points suggested
by Dr. Cousens. But the "stuffing" seems more easily to be dismissed
than any of the other contentions. Even the Eskimo can terminate the
stuffing process by the simple closing of his mouth, and the student can
evade mental indigestion even more easily. And the student very often
' does.
The statement on outside activities seems especially striking. Ath
letics, journalism, music and drama graded as part and parcel of the ordi
nary curriculum seems futuristic—very! And yet let us see.
Courses are certainly given—and graded—in journalism and music.
Drama is distantly represented by public speaking, though history and
writing of plays are the closest approaches to the stage usually rewarded
by grade points. Athletics are scarcely considered in the academic catalog.
And perhaps it is just as well for athletics. With an uneasy situation
all over the country in regard to scholastic standards and specialization in
athletics to the exclusion of a real education, what would be the effect of.
"grading" the athletes? One can imagine the star quarterback drawing
straight "A" grades in Football, Soccer, and Elementary Refereeing with
out ever going near the classrooms which entertain the less talented students
who cheer for him.
One could also imagine a sophomore substitute drawing a "D" because
he could not play well enough, and refusing thereafter to try for the team
for fear of flunking out.
Incidentally and quite irrelevantly, there is one way by which the ath
lete's place in the sun works a hardship and almost an injustice upon him.
If a college pitcher earns his way through the summer in the "business"
which is best known to him, sticking the ball over the plate for so much
per, he is straightway cast out of the fold and Class A college competition
knows him no more. He is "ineligible." He is a "professional."
Yet a man can work during the summer, or throughout the college year,
on a metropolitan newspaper, and then come back to the university and
edit the campus daily without a murmur from anybody. The comedian
can get a job with the movies—if he is good enough—and then return
likewise to college and outshine the amateurs. These men are really pro
fessionals, but their line of activity is such that nobody cares about it.
The reasons for this seeming discrimination against the athlete are
obvious, and perfectly sound. It's just a tough situation which he has to
face.

The Eskimos have a jolly old gastronomical custom where the proud
male lies on his back and allows his female to feed him with tid bits of
walrus blubber and flesh until he is unable to move. Somewhat the same
stuffing process is going on in American universities if Dr. John A.
Cousens, president of Tufts College, is to be believed.
"College faculties must stop trying to stuff students so they may be
inspected on state occasions," declares Dr. Cousens. He also holds that
soon students will be graded on activities outside as well as inside the class
room. Afliletics, journalism, music and drama he considers an integral
part of a college education and as such should be graded.
By the end of this century Dr. Cousens thinks that the alumni will be
actively interested in phases of college work other than athletics. Such a
hopeful man would be a good thing to have around the house.
Thus does one university educator forecast.—Daily A T orthivestern.
Once attracted by the rather startling metaphor used to open the above
editorial, the mind cannot help lingering awhile over the points suggested
by Dr. Cousens. But the "stuffing" seems more easily to be dismissed
than any of the other contentions. Even the Eskimo can terminate the
stuffing process by the simple closing of his mouth, and the student can
evade mental indigestion even more easily. And the student very often
' does.
The statement on outside activities seems especially striking. Ath
letics, journalism, music and drama graded as part and parcel of the ordi
nary curriculum seems futuristic—very! And yet let us see.
Courses are certainly given—and graded—in journalism and music.
Drama is distantly represented by public speaking, though history and
writing of plays are the closest approaches to the stage usually rewarded
by grade points. Athletics are scarcely considered in the academic catalog.
And perhaps it is just as well for athletics. With an uneasy situation
all over the country in regard to scholastic standards and specialization in
athletics to the exclusion of a real education, what would be the effect of.
"grading" the athletes? One can imagine the star quarterback drawing
straight "A" grades in Football, Soccer, and Elementary Refereeing with
out ever going near the classrooms which entertain the less talented students
who cheer for him.
One could also imagine a sophomore substitute drawing a "D" because
he could not play well enough, and refusing thereafter to try for the team
for fear of flunking out.
Incidentally and quite irrelevantly, there is one way by which the ath
lete's place in the sun works a hardship and almost an injustice upon him.
If a college pitcher earns his way through the summer in the "business"
which is best known to him, sticking the ball over the plate for so much
per, he is straightway cast out of the fold and Class A college competition
knows him no more. He is "ineligible." He is a "professional."
Yet a man can work during the summer, or throughout the college year,
on a metropolitan newspaper, and then come back to the university and
edit the campus daily without a murmur from anybody. The comedian
can get a job with the movies—if he is good enough—and then return
likewise to college and outshine the amateurs. These men are really pro
fessionals, but their line of activity is such that nobody cares about it.
The reasons for this seeming discrimination against the athlete are
obvious, and perfectly sound. It's just a tough situation which he has to
face.
