Athletic Director of Publicity—Don
ald Leaping Snorter.
"My Hobby? Oh, my," said Leaping
Snorter, biting his thumb. It was only
| after several minutes that he re-
I covered his composure sufficiently to
speak, that is coherently.
"Really, you know, I hate to tell
you; it sounds as if I were boasting.
"Oh go on," we urged him, "we
won't tell a soul, not a-a-a soul."
"Well," he went on, "my favorite
leisure occupation is spreading sun
: shine. It is my greatest pleasure to
take some erring youth aside and to
be confidential.
"In this way I find that I am able to
j convince many young men that things
are true which they would never
otherwise have believed.
"Of course you all know that I write
for the Chronicle, but that is another
story. You might come around and get
it sometime when you need a top col
umn."
"Oh, yes," we said as sweetly as pos
sible, "we know you write for the
Chronicle. We have often had the
pleasure of reading your articles when
we wanted to find out what was going
on in the Publicity D£partyient. Well I
must go and write this."
"Oh," called Leaping Snorter, "you're
not going to print this. I had no
idea "
"Yes, we know that," we interrupted,
| "but we told the editor we'd get an
J interview anyhow." —BLOCK S.

Will some insurance expert tell us
where one can get an endowment
policy on a Ford?

Although it is not generally recog
nized, perhaps the most disconcerting
basketball play in use this season is
the Cardinal gun play. Visiting teams
unaccustomed to the Big Bertha sel
dom regain composure after time is
called until the second half is well
along.

Discontinuance of this practice
j should save, in ammunition costs
'alone, almost $947.49 per game. When
the University's half of hospital bills
is considered, the added saving result
ing from the prevention of nervous
shock would very likely make possible
a tuition cut.
