# SPORTS OF 1925

### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
At an indoor track meet, such as the Milrose games in New York next week,
the excitement and general interest centers around the pole-vault more than
any other field event, while the high jump also comes in for a lot of "ohs" and
"ahs." The element of danger and the grace, skill, and acrobatic efforts of
the competitors al lcause many thrills among the cash customers.
Hugh Baxter, the "Father of Pole-vaulting," set the first official world's
record in 1887 at 11 feet, 5 inches. Since then ten different men have pushed
the mark up and up with the passing years. The greatest American vaulter
was Prank Foss, of Cornell University and Chicago, who won the competition
in the 1920 Olympic games at Antwerp with a leap of 13 feet, 5 1-16 inches.
Young Charles Hoff of Norway competed in the vault that day without suc
cess, but he watched Foss very carefully and learned a lot â€”so much that in
1923 he vaulted 13 feet, 6 inches, and in 1924 three inches higher. It is hoped
that Hoff will meet Lee Barnes, the Hollywood High School boy who won the
1924 Olympic pole-vault, in competition in America this winter.
Bob Gardiner, National Amateur Golf Champion in 1909 and 1915, held the
world's record in the pole-vault for one week in 1912. Then Mark Wright
cafe along and vaulted over an inch higher.
The high jump, a favorite event but not so spectacular as the pole-vault, has
developed greatly in form in recent years, but the record now is only 4 1-4
inches higher than it was in ISB7. The late "Dad" Moulton, veteran trainer and
coach at Stanford University, did a lot to revolutionize style in high jumping
and pole-vaulting. Two of Dad's pupils, Dole and Scott, held the world's record
in the pole-vault, while George Horine broke Sweeney's long standing record
In the higlijump.
Horine, with Moulton'a help, perfected the "western style" of jumping, in
which the athlete's body lies out parallel to the bar as it rolls over. Eddie j
Beeson, who broke Horine's record, and Harold Osborn, who holds the present i
world's mark of 6 feet, 8 1-4 inches, both used this same jumping form.
