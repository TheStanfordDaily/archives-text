### 
David L. Zyve, president of the Edu
cation club, compared the various
schemes for reform of educational
methods which appeared in France
during the French Revolution, and
those uppermost in Soviet Russia to
day, at a meeting of the French club
held last night in the Women's Club
house.
Zyve pointed out that the majority
of plans during the French Revolution
dealt with the substitution of political
doctrines for religious beliefs, while
in Russia, not political, but economic
and social doctrines are now being
taught. "The French plan was more
noble than that now tried since the
French merely wanted to do away with
the influence of tradition, while In
Russia the Soviets are trying to en
force atheism In all Russian schools.
