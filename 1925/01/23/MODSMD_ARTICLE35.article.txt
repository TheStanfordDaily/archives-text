# CARDINAL PUGILISTS START WORKOUTS FOR WINTER BOUTS
## Martin, Farmin, Schall, and Miron Will Form Basis For Boxing Team 
### Dud Ross 
With two matches with both the
California Aggies and the Southern
Branch under consideration, boxing
prospects for the coming season look
promising, according to Coach Harry
Maloney.
The advanced class has already
started working out, and good material
has reported for practice. Coach Ma
loney emphasized the fact that there
is an excellent chance for men new to
the ring at Stanford to make the team.
Early in February the first informal
elimination tournament will be held
in the Encina gym. This will give a
more definite line on the material on
hand and will furnish something more
like actual competition to members of
the squad. The tournament will decide
in all probability the make-up of the
team for the first outside match.
Veterans Look Good
Despite the loss of Jake Irwin, cap
tain of last year's team, Stuart Van
Van Hook, a liglitlieavyweight, and
"Ike" Harward, the remaining veterans
look like a winning combination. Cap
tain Vincent Martin, welterweight, Rol
lin Farmin, lightlieavy, Myron Schall,
middleweight, and Carlos Miron,
featherweight, will form the nucleus
of the team.
Captain Vince Martin will be the
best bet on the team. Last year he had
an impressive series of knockouts,
flooring the Agging man for the count
in both meets with the Davis Farm
pugilists. His hitting power should
count heavily in the matches this year.
The vacancy left by Jake Irwin will
be hotly contested for by Schall. He
substituted for Irwin In the second tilt
with the Aggies last year, when the
latter was out with a case of poison
oak.
Davis Farm has always turned out
good teams in the past and should
prove a tough opponent for the Cards.
After being defeated 5 to 1 at Stan
ford last winter, they turned the tables
in the return fight and downed the
Stanford men on their home floor.
