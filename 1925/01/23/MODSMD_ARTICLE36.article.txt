# Rakestraw Will Review Recent European Visit
## 
### 
Experiences in the little tourist
visited laud of the midnight sun will
be told by Norris W. Rakestraw in his
illustrated lecture, "Glimpses of Scan
dinavian Life," at 7:30 Tuesday eve
ning in the Little Theatre.
Rakestraw, who graduated from
Stanford in 1916, has been a member
of the Chemistry department here
since 1919. A year and a half ago he
left for study and travel in Europe.
Two months were spent in Copenha
gen, the place with which he became
most familiar during his travels. From
there he went to Sweden and Norway.
He had also the experience of going
north into the land of the midnight
sun. The fiords of the Scandinavian
peninsula particularly impressed him,
and some of the pictures which he
collected, and which he will show
Tuesday night, will be of these rugged
inlets so typical of Scandinavia. Other
pictures deal with the town and rural
life of the people.
