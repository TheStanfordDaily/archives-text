# New Theatre to Have Uniformed Usherettes
## 
### 
Uniformed usherettes will present
one of the main attractions at the
New Stanford Theatre when it is
opened May 1.
Another of the features promised
local cinema fans is an orchestra to
accompany, with fitting and melodious
music, the soul-stirring dramas shown
on the screen. The orchestra will be a
regular attraction, providing the exis
tence of the musicians is not made
too hazardous by the audience.
The management also plans to stage
vaudeville at various times, but the
continuance of the vaudeville depends
upon the behavior of the assembled
multitude.
There will be a balcony in the new
movie palace for the convenience of
those who smoke.
