The clever lines which compose
"You and I" are fascinating and spark
ling when the cast Gordon Davis has
chosen interprets them in the light of
its various personalities.
The restrained vivaciousness of Vir
ginia Graves which will bubble over

ence will be positive that he does —in
fac,t to doubt it would place one im
mediately with the morons, Class Z.
Although this is the first appearance
of Lowell Math ay in Stanford dra
matics, he promises to prove again
the customary surety with which Gor
don Davis casts his characters. As a
frank, energetic, not-too-tactful Ameri
can business man, he leaves little to
be desired.
