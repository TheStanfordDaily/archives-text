# SECOND GAME WITH IRELAND SLATED FOR TOMORROW.
## Baseball Varsity Is Out to Revenge Last Week's 7 to 5 Defeat 
### John Levi 
The varsity nine will meet Cliff Ire
land's Independents at 2:30 tomorrow
! on the varsity diamond for the second
I and, in all probability the last, time
[this year.
Last week Ireland's men succeeded
in taking the varsity into camp by a
7 to 5 score. Griffin of the Independ
ents conected with one of Collins' fast
1 balls in the third inning, and knocked
the pellet well over the left field fence,
scoring three runs. The varsity had
several chances to overcome the lead
that the visitors held throughout the
contest, but seemed to lack the neces
sary punch.

Jim Lawson's appearance at prac
tice yesterday for the first time this
season should help solve the problem
of getting a catcher. Solomon has been
taking a try at the backstop position,
and when he once gets his bearings
he will probably go well.
The Stanford lineup will no doubt
be the same as the one that was
used last week with the exception of
the battery. Johnston at first, Roberts
at second, Mulchay at shorstop, and
Cuddeback at third are all veterans
from last year, and al of them are
showing exceptional early season form.
Davie Brown, who is covering cen
ter field, is one of the best finds of
the year. He- handles himself like a
veteran and has a good peg, but so
far he has not been able to get his
batting eye. Jerry Stewart, a sopho
more, showed up well last week, and
will no doubt be seen in left field
again tomorrow. "Bus" McCandless
will be covering right field.
Either Teague, Oviatt, Collins, or
Aydelotte will be called upon to go
into the box. Aydelotte started the
game last week, but he wasn't up to
his usual form, and Collins was sent
in to replace him in the third inning.
Collins, once he got started, succeeded
in holding the visitors well under con
trol. "Tod" Oviatt is the most likely
candidate for tomorrow's starter.
The Ireland team will be the same
as last week with the possible addition
of Bert Ellison of the Seals on the
initial sack. Griffin, also of the Seals,
will pitch, and Cliff's protege, Mon
tague Manouk, is Ireland's second
choice for pitcher. He pitched a good
brand of ball the three innings that
he played last game, but he is not as
powerful a hitter as Griffin.
Ireland will be ambling around the
vicinity of second base. Cliff didn't
make any spectacular plays last week,
but he managed to keep the stands
amused.

several chances to overcome the lead
that the visitors held throughout the
contest, but seemed to lack the neces
sary punch.
Lawson in Suit
Jim Lawson's appearance at prac
tice yesterday for the first time this
season should help solve the problem
of getting a catcher. Solomon has been
taking a try at the backstop position,
and when he once gets his bearings
he will probably go well.
The Stanford lineup will no doubt
be the same as the one that was
used last week with the exception of
the battery. Johnston at first, Roberts
at second, Mulchay at shorstop, and
Cuddeback at third are all veterans
from last year, and al of them are
showing exceptional early season form.
Davie Brown, who is covering cen
ter field, is one of the best finds of
the year. He- handles himself like a
veteran and has a good peg, but so
far he has not been able to get his
batting eye. Jerry Stewart, a sopho
more, showed up well last week, and
will no doubt be seen in left field
again tomorrow. "Bus" McCandless
will be covering right field.
Either Teague, Oviatt, Collins, or
Aydelotte will be called upon to go
into the box. Aydelotte started the
game last week, but he wasn't up to
his usual form, and Collins was sent
in to replace him in the third inning.
Collins, once he got started, succeeded
in holding the visitors well under con
trol. "Tod" Oviatt is the most likely
candidate for tomorrow's starter.
The Ireland team will be the same
as last week with the possible addition
of Bert Ellison of the Seals on the
initial sack. Griffin, also of the Seals,
will pitch, and Cliff's protege, Mon
tague Manouk, is Ireland's second
choice for pitcher. He pitched a good
brand of ball the three innings that
he played last game, but he is not as
powerful a hitter as Griffin.
Ireland will be ambling around the
vicinity of second base. Cliff didn't
make any spectacular plays last week,
but he managed to keep the stands
amused.
The varsity nine will meet Cliff Ire
land's Independents at 2:30 tomorrow
! on the varsity diamond for the second
I and, in all probability the last, time
[this year.
Last week Ireland's men succeeded
in taking the varsity into camp by a
7 to 5 score. Griffin of the Independ
ents conected with one of Collins' fast
1 balls in the third inning, and knocked
the pellet well over the left field fence,
scoring three runs. The varsity had
several chances to overcome the lead
that the visitors held throughout the
contest, but seemed to lack the neces
sary punch.
