# CARD BABE FIVE IN PRELIMINARY WITH OAKLAND TECH
## Hunt Expects Improvement Tonight Against Fast Bay Court Team 
### Harry Bennett 
Oakland Technical High School will
send its best ' combination against
"Husky" Hunt's Cardinal babes at 7
o'clock tomorrow night in the pavilion
as a preliminary to the varsity clash
with the Nevada Sagehens.
Constant improvement in the fresh
man squad has been evident in the
last few games, and it is beginning to
seem possible that Hunt will be able
to overcome the effect of the many
ineligibilities. Several new men have
been added to the ranks and the size
of the squad has grown to eighteen.
So far this season the yearling squad
has been successful. It has been de
feated but once although most of the
games have been very close. The high
school opponents of the babes will in
no way equal the team that the fresh
men must face when they meet Cali
fornia's first-year team.
When the babes meet the aggregai
tion from Oakland Tech tomorrow,
they are going up against a fast team.
Oakland, several time champions of
the bay district, has won all its games
this year.
Last Wednesday, Hunt worked out
two full teams. The center position
is suffering the most from want of
substitutes. Dennis is playing a first
class game at this position but he has
no relief man.
The forward posts are well pro
tected with two or three good men for
each job. Moore and Vincenti have
been playing first string with Nye and
Snyde alternating. The first two work
very well together and make a good
offensive combination. Moore is slow
in going after the ball but when he
gets it he usually makes good his shot.
Reynolds Shows Form
"Mike" Reynolds earned the right to
start the babe games at baok guard
when he showed his working ability
against the Lick-Wilmerding team.
Bigelow will probably see action at
this position also.
Bill Clark at running guard has a
good substitute in Crist but his con
sistent working usually does away
with the need for a second man. This
has forced Crist to take up the work
as forward and his last performance
proved that he can hold down either
job.
