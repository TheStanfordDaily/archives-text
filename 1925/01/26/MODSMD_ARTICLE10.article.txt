With an All-Star cast, and a play acclaimed as the most representative
American comedy-drama that has ever attempted to depict present-day
American life, the Masquers play of 1925 is expected to be the oustanding
dramatic effort of the year.
Gordon Davis has assembled in the cast of "You and I" a galaxy of Stanford
thespians which has never been equalled in point of popularity and experience.
With a single exception each member of the cast has had either a prominent

<ยง>or a starring role in some former pro-
I duction.
Marjorie Allen Is Lead
Heading the list is the leading lady
i of the play, Marjorie Allen. Those who
i saw "Captain Applejack" last year,
and also the Junior Opera, will never
forget the appealing charm which Mar
jorie! Allen possesses. Her work in
"You and I" will far surpass her pre
vious efforts and her dramatic follow
ing, already .perhaps the largest of any
actress on the campus, will include
everyone who is fortunate enough to
see Friday night's play.
Peggy Randall, in the comedy role
of "Etta" will add to the fame she won
as the delightful "Dulcy" of last quar
ter. Looks, stage presence, a comedy
sense that is remarkable, all these will
aid her in a characterization that will
' literally "bring the house down" when
| she steps on the stage next Friday. Her
impersonation of the maid who "plays
lady" is one of the best bits of acting
that has been seen this year.
Virginia Graves, last seen as the
young Robotess, in the epilogue of "R.
U. R.," is the "mother" of the play.
Although far different from her other
role, the part of Nancy White in "You
and I" offers the opportunity for bits
of dramatic interpretation that will
stamp her as an exceptional actress.
Alan Robertson, the handsome lead
ing man of "R. U. R.," has the most
i important and at the same time the
most difficult male role in "You and
! I." As Maitland White, the successful
business man with a flair for art, who
: watches his son go through the same
: experiences that he had as a boy,
Alan Robertson will be called upon to
j "put over" a role which will require
acting ability in the nth degree. Re
hearsals indicate tlmt his acting in
this play will be one of the high lights
of the dramatic year.
Leonard Schwartz, as the son, made
his reputation as the young brother of
"Dulcy," and in "You and I" lie has
another part which seems to lit him
as though the role was originally in
tended for him. As "Rickey" White, he
falls in love with Ronny (Marjorie Al
len) but circumstances seem about to
forestall the marriage. His manner of
taking the news: nonchalant, but with
visible evidences of a broken heart
underneath, is one of those appealing
bits "of dramatic interpretation that
will bring tears to the eyes of even
the most sophisticated and blas6.
"You and I" is replete with such mo
ments, and Leonard Schwartz is en
acting them with the ease and skill of
a professional.
Charles Parks is perfectly at home
in the role of Geoffrey, a friend of the
Maitlands. His part calls for a breezy,
continental type which allows him to
put his personality into it.
Lowell Matthay, as the materialistic,
hard-headed business man, who owns
the company in which Maitland White

is interested, has a part which, al- j
though it excites no sympathy, is an
excellent characterization of the mod-1
em "captain of industry." Although he
has had no previous experience 011 the
Stanford stage, Lowell Matthay lias a
stage presence and a voice which fit
him ideally for the role.
The audience next Friday night will
include many distinguished visitors,
since this will be the first time that j
"You and I" has been produced 011 the :
Pacific Coast, and its reputation has j
made it one of the most interesting
plays of recent years.
Seats may be purchased, after the
general seat sale tomorrow noon, at
the office of the alumni secretary in
the Administration building. There j
will be the usual cast dance in the 1
Women's Clubhouse immediately fol-1
lowing the play.
