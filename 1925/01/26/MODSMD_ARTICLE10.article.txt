With an All-Star cast, and a play acclaimed as the most representative
American comedy-drama that has ever attempted to depict present-day
American life, the Masquers play of 1925 is expected to be the oustanding
dramatic effort of the year.
Gordon Davis has assembled in the cast of "You and I" a galaxy of Stanford
thespians which has never been equalled in point of popularity and experience.
With a single exception each member of the cast has had either a prominent

<§>or a starring role in some former pro-
I duction.
Marjorie Allen Is Lead
Heading the list is the leading lady
i of the play, Marjorie Allen. Those who
i saw "Captain Applejack" last year,
and also the Junior Opera, will never
forget the appealing charm which Mar
jorie! Allen possesses. Her work in
"You and I" will far surpass her pre

actress on the campus, will include
everyone who is fortunate enough to
see Friday night's play.
Peggy Randall, in the comedy role
of "Etta" will add to the fame she won

that has been seen this year.
Virginia Graves, last seen as the
young Robotess, in the epilogue of "R.
U. R.," is the "mother" of the play.
Although far different from her other
role, the part of Nancy White in "You
and I" offers the opportunity for bits
of dramatic interpretation that will
stamp her as an exceptional actress.
Alan Robertson, the handsome lead
ing man of "R. U. R.," has the most
i important and at the same time the
most difficult male role in "You and
! I." As Maitland White, the successful
business man with a flair for art, who
: watches his son go through the same
: experiences that he had as a boy,
Alan Robertson will be called upon to
j "put over" a role which will require
acting ability in the nth degree. Re
