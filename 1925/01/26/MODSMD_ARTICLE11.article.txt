# N.W. RAKESTRAW TO TALK TOMORROW ON SCANDINAVIAN LIFE
## Speaker Makes Investigation Of European Colleges In Course of Trip 
### 
Dr. Norris W. Rakestraw of the
Chemistry department who will give an
illustrated lecture on "Glimpses of Scan
dinavian Life" at 7 :30 tomorrow evening
in the Little Theater, has made a spccial
point of visiting European universities
during his year and a half abroad.
On arriving at Stockholm, Dr. Rake
straw found that the students of the
nearby University of Uppsala were cele
brating the spring festival. At this fes
tival he had the opportunity of seeing the
native Swedish dances done by the
dents. Directly after this festival the
students put on their white caps, as a
sign that summer had come.
Daily Promenade Held
"The recreation of the Swedish stu
dent is the promenade from 2 o'clock to
3 every afternoon," stated Dr. Rakestraw.
"They march up and down a section of
the main street, while all traffic along
there is stopped. Whenever they see a
friend, either man or woman, they take
off their caps very ceremoniously, bow
ing from the waist German fashion."
"In Norway," he continued, "both men
and women students wear black caps
with a long black tassel dangling from
the center, and in the front a sort of red
spot or seal."
In the twenty-five universities he vis
ited Dr. Rakestraw noticed a marked
absence of intercollegiate life. Not only
arc intercollegiate sports of no more im
portance than impromptu backyard
games, but there is a certain provincial
ism ; colleges know nothing of each
other, according to his observations.
Birmingham and Manchester in England,
for instance, are as "close to each other as
Stanford and the University of Califor
nia, but in interchange of ideas, knowl
edge of each other, and all relationships,
are far more separated, he declared.
Alma Mater Spirit Absent
Absence of the alma mater spirit was
one of the things Dr. Rakestraw noticed
in European universities, especially on
the continent, for the smaller coeduca
tion colleges of England are more like
ours. "In most of the universities the
buildings are scattered, so that there is
no campus. The students do not feel
pride in the loyalty to their university,"
Dr. Rakestraw explained, adding that in
some of the largest universities there are
unions similar to ours, but these arc
clubs, fostering personal relationships,
not the spirit of the class or of the
whole college, which is prcvelant in
America.
