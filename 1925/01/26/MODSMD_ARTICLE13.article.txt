# LIGHTWEIGHT TEAM EASILY DOWNS U. C. PHARMACY QUINTET
## 
### 
Holding the U. of C. Pharmacy
Branch 145's scoreless for the entire last
half and with the score against them at
half time 16 to 9, the Stanford light
weights turned defeat into victory with
a score of 22 to 18 in a few moments
of the most exciting basketball seen on
the local courts this season. An extra
three minutes was necessary to decide
the 16 to 16 tie that stood at the end
of the seoend half.
For excitement and tensity the light
weight preliminary game far exceeded
the following varsity game. It was only
after twenty minutes of close guarding,
hard playing, and fast offensive work
that the Stanford team dropped in the
tieing basket a minute before the gun
went off.
Play during tlie second frame was
largely centered around the Druggist's
basket but to completely shut out a fast
quintet like they were for a half shows
a remarkably strong defense. Kunzel and
Clark followed the ball like hawks and
allowed it to linger in their vicinity but
a short time before they had it shooting
down towards the other basket.
Coach Davis ran in <\ string of substi
tutes at the start of the second half but
althought they guarded closely and tallied
two points, more points were necessary,
so the first line up were sent in to open
up. Kunzel started things with a long
shot from the center of the floor. George,
substituting for Ricse, tied the score with
a pa tty field goal.
Tlie Stanford rally gained impetus in
the extra period and baskets by George,
Clark, and Parsons put the game on ice
although the Pharmacists managed to
slip in one field goal.
The Stanford five worked smoothly to
gether, Kiese and Blazier getting in some
nice teamwork which accounted for sev
eral goals.
Bonagiuso starred for the California
team and Akana and Cucci also worked
well.
