# NEVADANS LOSE TWO GAMES TO CARDINAL SQUAD
## Stanford Quintet Exhibits Remarkable Offensive, Defensive Work 
### David Meiklejohn 
University of Nevada's basketball team
returned to Reno yesterday, losers of a
perfectly good reputation and a two
game series to the Stanford five, which
managed to trim the Sagebrushers 18 to
12 Friday night, and squeeze out in the
second game by the uncomfortable, but
wholly satisfactory, score of 26 to 23
Saturday night.
Beating Nevada was something in it
self, but the Stanford five went further.
It proved that in its midst is some good
championship material, perfectly capable
of putting up a stiff scrap against any
team in the country.
Good Defense
The first game was an exhibition of
remarkable defense work on the part of
Stanford. Ten of the Nevada points
came as a result of personal fouls made
by Cardinal players. Fredericks, Nevada
forward, was the only player who suc
ceeded in penetfating the tight Cardinal
defense to score a field goal.
Stanford started out strongly a the
beginning of the initial contest by snow
ing the Wolf-Pack under an 8 to 2 lead
in the first half, and ending strongly
with an additional charge of field goals.
Ned Anderson at center was easily the
best player on the court that evening.
Nevada doped out the Stanford defense
capably in the second game, however, and
during the entire melee it looked like
anybody's money. Had not Fred Price
managed to locate the hoop during that
last tense minute the Wolf-Pack might
have carried a different story back to
Reno. Nevada was leading 23 to 21.
Stanford then missed four free throws
in succession, but Harrison, Nevada's
guard, obliged by letting the Cards have
two more tries. Price tallied the two and
tied the score, followed a little later with
another free marker, and just as the gun
shot managed to make it convincing with
a held goal.
Plenty of Subs
Stanford's strongest asset, beyond a
doubt lay in the variety and capability
of its substitute material. Kerr put in
men right and left, men to defend the
goal when such were needed and players
to score points when points were the
chief object. And it worked from the
beginning to the end.
Harry Shipkey made up for his some
what flurried, but excusable (seeing as
the ball was obliging enough to roll out)
blunder by scoring six of the Stanford
points in the second game and plaing a
creditable game on the floor..

Plenty of Subs
Stanford's strongest asset, beyond a
doubt lay in the variety and capability
of its substitute material. Kerr put in
men right and left, men to defend the
goal when such were needed and players
to score points when points were the
chief object. And it worked from the
beginning to the end.
Harry Shipkey made up for his some
what flurried, but excusable (seeing as
the ball was obliging enough to roll out)
blunder by scoring six of the Stanford
points in the second game and plaing a
creditable game on the floor..

University of Nevada's basketball team
returned to Reno yesterday, losers of a
perfectly good reputation and a two
game series to the Stanford five, which
managed to trim the Sagebrushers 18 to
12 Friday night, and squeeze out in the
second game by the uncomfortable, but
wholly satisfactory, score of 26 to 23
Saturday night.
Beating Nevada was something in it
self, but the Stanford five went further.
It proved that in its midst is some good
championship material, perfectly capable
of putting up a stiff scrap against any
team in the country.
Good Defense
The first game was an exhibition of
remarkable defense work on the part of
Stanford. Ten of the Nevada points
came as a result of personal fouls made
by Cardinal players. Fredericks, Nevada
forward, was the only player who suc
ceeded in penetfating the tight Cardinal
defense to score a field goal.
Stanford started out strongly a the
beginning of the initial contest by snow
ing the Wolf-Pack under an 8 to 2 lead
in the first half, and ending strongly
with an additional charge of field goals.
Ned Anderson at center was easily the
best player on the court that evening.
Nevada doped out the Stanford defense
capably in the second game, however, and
during the entire melee it looked like
anybody's money. Had not Fred Price
managed to locate the hoop during that
last tense minute the Wolf-Pack might
have carried a different story back to
Reno. Nevada was leading 23 to 21.
Stanford then missed four free throws
in succession, but Harrison, Nevada's
guard, obliged by letting the Cards have
two more tries. Price tallied the two and
tied the score, followed a little later with
another free marker, and just as the gun
shot managed to make it convincing with
a held goal.
