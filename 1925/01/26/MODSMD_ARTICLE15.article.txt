# WOMEN WILL PLAY SERIES OF PRACTICE BASKETBALL GAMES
## 
### 
I A practice series of women's basket
j ball games will be run off the first weeks
I in February, according to an announce
ment by Miss Helen Masters Bunting,
basketball coach.
Six games will be played, two each
week, thus enabling every team to meet
j every other team. After the practice
I series, a clearer idea can be had of the
material in the various squads.
Some good material has turned out
for the freshman squads, according to
: Miss Bunting. The thirty-five women
i who have enrolled for freshman basket-
I ball have been divided into two squads,
j and two teams or possibly three will be
organized from these women. The twen
! ty-three sophomore women should fur
; nish two teams, and a possible third to
meet the freshman third team. The
[ sophomores, however, are handicapped by
the loss of three of their best players,
| Laura Gardiner, forward, and Barbara
Fenwick, center, who are out on account
lof illness, and Charlotte Locekin, who
is spending the winter in New York.
( The senior and junior squads are small,
and will have only first teams.
Toward the end of February the offi
cial schedule of six games for the class
championship will be run off, two each
week.
