# Noise—When, Why, How
## 
### 
The Stanford rough and his smoother compatriots seem to have en
countered a continual storm of criticism in connection with the vocal
talents demonstrated by them on one occasion or another. Last quarter it
was believed in many quarters that the rooting section was c6mposed of
physically dumb intellectuals who couldn't produce an echo in a box-car.
And now it appears that these same members of our little community are
all too noisy.
And there is basis for the assumption. Friday's Daily carried two
items which bore directly upon the power and practice of Cardinal vocal
cords. The first and more serious of the two concerned the inexcusable
and "south of Market" razzing of officials and players in recent basketball
games. Skull and Snakes went to the heart of the matter in its rebuke,
and nothing too uncomplimentary can be said about the occupants of the
basketball pavilion who descend to such water-front tactics as have been
displayed.
The second mention was in connection with the new theatre now under
construction in Palo Alto. This theatre, it appears, will have a good
orchestra and several vaudeville acts —if the conduct of the audience will
perrriit. This permission will be in the form of a more or less thick
blanket of silence, to the exclusion of the verbal captions which have accom
panied the pictures for some years.
The Daily finds its difficult to frown upon-this good-natured hulla
baloo, until it becomes vicious or until there is proof that someone is being
definitely annoyed. If Palo Alto people or Stanford students find that the
noise spoils the picture, they have neglected to voice their disapproval
anywhere except to the theater management, which is already doing its
best to preserve peace. Only a few, as a rule, care to lift their voices in
comment. If they spoil the enjoyment of the rest of the picture-goers,
let these latter make their grievance known so that confident steps can be
taken to abate the nuisance. It must first be'proven that it is a nuisance,
and the Daily will be glad to print, when possible, letters relating to this
question.
Hooking up these two recent examples of noise, there is a peculiar
situation. The theater authorities say that some part of the trouble comes
from the younger generation in Palo Alto, who hear the Stanford men
and forthwith pipe up likewise in worshipful emulation. The athletic au
thorities say that some part of the razzing and cheap conduct comes from
the fact that the students hear the Palo Alto element giving tongue at the
wrong time, and that it is the students who follow the leader. At any rate
the blame seems equally divided, with each side of the controversy passing
the original viciousness to the other fellow and leaving only a charge of
weakmindedness for the home rooters.
Appearing at the same time, these two complaints give rise to a valid
question. Have the more enthusiastic members of the student body been
making their noise at the wrong time? Unquestionably the howl of dis
may after a penalty is awful, and there have been instances of even worse
spirit than that. And the movie problem may be just as definite. Accord
ing to the-announcement, the noise-makers have the option of keying down
and getting more for their money—or piping up and holding the sack.
The Rally Committee is doing well at holding down the calamity-howlers
in the Pavilion, but the Paly shows must be dealt with otherwise.
The best policy would be to let the yell-leaders call for the noise.
That's what they're for.

The best policy would be to let the yell-leaders call for the noise.
That's what they're for.
The Stanford rough and his smoother compatriots seem to have en
countered a continual storm of criticism in connection with the vocal
talents demonstrated by them on one occasion or another. Last quarter it
was believed in many quarters that the rooting section was c6mposed of
physically dumb intellectuals who couldn't produce an echo in a box-car.
And now it appears that these same members of our little community are
all too noisy.
And there is basis for the assumption. Friday's Daily carried two
items which bore directly upon the power and practice of Cardinal vocal
cords. The first and more serious of the two concerned the inexcusable
and "south of Market" razzing of officials and players in recent basketball
games. Skull and Snakes went to the heart of the matter in its rebuke,
and nothing too uncomplimentary can be said about the occupants of the
basketball pavilion who descend to such water-front tactics as have been
displayed.
The second mention was in connection with the new theatre now under
construction in Palo Alto. This theatre, it appears, will have a good
orchestra and several vaudeville acts —if the conduct of the audience will
perrriit. This permission will be in the form of a more or less thick
blanket of silence, to the exclusion of the verbal captions which have accom
panied the pictures for some years.
The Daily finds its difficult to frown upon-this good-natured hulla
baloo, until it becomes vicious or until there is proof that someone is being
definitely annoyed. If Palo Alto people or Stanford students find that the
noise spoils the picture, they have neglected to voice their disapproval
anywhere except to the theater management, which is already doing its
best to preserve peace. Only a few, as a rule, care to lift their voices in
comment. If they spoil the enjoyment of the rest of the picture-goers,
let these latter make their grievance known so that confident steps can be
taken to abate the nuisance. It must first be'proven that it is a nuisance,
and the Daily will be glad to print, when possible, letters relating to this
question.
Hooking up these two recent examples of noise, there is a peculiar
situation. The theater authorities say that some part of the trouble comes
from the younger generation in Palo Alto, who hear the Stanford men
and forthwith pipe up likewise in worshipful emulation. The athletic au
thorities say that some part of the razzing and cheap conduct comes from
the fact that the students hear the Palo Alto element giving tongue at the
wrong time, and that it is the students who follow the leader. At any rate
the blame seems equally divided, with each side of the controversy passing
the original viciousness to the other fellow and leaving only a charge of
weakmindedness for the home rooters.
Appearing at the same time, these two complaints give rise to a valid
question. Have the more enthusiastic members of the student body been
making their noise at the wrong time? Unquestionably the howl of dis
may after a penalty is awful, and there have been instances of even worse
spirit than that. And the movie problem may be just as definite. Accord
ing to the-announcement, the noise-makers have the option of keying down
and getting more for their money—or piping up and holding the sack.
The Rally Committee is doing well at holding down the calamity-howlers
in the Pavilion, but the Paly shows must be dealt with otherwise.
