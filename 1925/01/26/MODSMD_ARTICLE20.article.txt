Mary Ann McCarty
She had just returned home from
engaging in her favorite outdoor ;
sport. Her shoes (Stacy Adams) her .
frock (Paul Poiret) and even her
cerise wig were flecked with soupy
mud. In her hand she carried a dainty
tin shovel —nothing more, although
she might have easily got a quantity j
of other things in that magnificent j
member.
,J I have just returned from clam
digging," Miss McCarty volunteered.
"I feel that life has no greater thrill
for one than when she turns up a
fresh bivalve. I simply cannot help
thinking of the charming Stanford
snakes' haircut when I see the glisten
ing shell of a clam.
"Have you ever seen snakes?" she
innocently added.
"Tomorrow morning I leave for San
Pedro," Miss McCarty remarked, "to
compare the great northern and south
ern harbors. I have been greatly an
noyed digging in and about San Fran
cisco by the heavy shipping traffic,
and I understand that in San Pedro
such disturbance is practically negli
gible.
"I would be glad to give you a clam
for a souvenir," she blushingly said,
"but I must confess that after a thor
ough search through all the mud in
San, Franpisco bay I have failed to
find ah —er —single one."
