# DELEGATES CHOOSE SUBJECT OF LEAGUE DEBATE ON MARCH 1
## 
### 
At a meeting of delegates from the
various members of the Euphronia De
bating League, held last Friday, the fol
lowing subject, "Resolved, that the
President of the United States should be
nominated by the direct vote of the
people," was selected as the subject of
the league debates which will be held on
Wednesday, March 11th.
The Euphronia Debating League con
sists of the College of the Pacific, St.
Marys, San Jose State College, Mills
College, the University of Santa Clara,
and Euphronia at Stanford. The presi
dent of the league is W. L. Gosslin,
president of the local society also.
Each institution will prepare two teams
for the league debates, one to uphold
each side of the question. In each case
the home team will uphold the affirmative
and the visitors the negative. On Wed
nesday, March 11th, at the Little Thea
tre, Euphronia's affirmative team will
meet representatives from Mill's College,
while on Friday, March 6, the Euphronia
negative team will meet San Jose State
College.
Unusual arrangements for the debate
have been made. There will be two men
on a team. Rebuttals will follow the or
der of the main speeches. There will be
a three minute affirmative closing, which
time will be taken out of the time granted
for the affirmative rebuttals.
A feature worthy of note is the fact
that members of the audience will be
able to interrupt each debater twice dur
ing his constructive speech, with time
out for the question and answer. This
has never been done -on the Pacific Coast,
| but will be tried out in order to make
J the debates informal and of interest to
the audience.
A new system of judging will be tried
out at these debates. Each of the follow
ing will count one vote; the majority
j decision of the audience; the vote of an
expert judge, who shall give reasons for
his decision; and the vote of a balance
judge, who will vote on the general im
pression given by the speakers without
giving his reasons. This system was de-
I vised by Prof. Nichols of U. S. C., and
though it has been used but rarely, was
strongly recommended by the Pacific
Forensic League Conference which met
here last December.
Tryouts for this debate will be held
Wednesday, February 11th. All those
planning to tryout should send in their
names to W. L. Gosslin, Box 1005, stat
ing the side of the question they intend
to uphold.

has never been done -on the Pacific Coast,
| but will be tried out in order to make
J the debates informal and of interest to
the audience.
A new system of judging will be tried
out at these debates. Each of the follow
ing will count one vote; the majority
j decision of the audience; the vote of an
expert judge, who shall give reasons for
his decision; and the vote of a balance
judge, who will vote on the general im
pression given by the speakers without
giving his reasons. This system was de-
I vised by Prof. Nichols of U. S. C., and
though it has been used but rarely, was
strongly recommended by the Pacific
Forensic League Conference which met
here last December.
Tryouts for this debate will be held
Wednesday, February 11th. All those
planning to tryout should send in their
names to W. L. Gosslin, Box 1005, stat
ing the side of the question they intend
to uphold.
At a meeting of delegates from the
various members of the Euphronia De
bating League, held last Friday, the fol
lowing subject, "Resolved, that the
President of the United States should be
nominated by the direct vote of the
people," was selected as the subject of
the league debates which will be held on
Wednesday, March 11th.
The Euphronia Debating League con
sists of the College of the Pacific, St.
Marys, San Jose State College, Mills
College, the University of Santa Clara,
and Euphronia at Stanford. The presi
dent of the league is W. L. Gosslin,
president of the local society also.
Each institution will prepare two teams
for the league debates, one to uphold
each side of the question. In each case
the home team will uphold the affirmative
and the visitors the negative. On Wed
nesday, March 11th, at the Little Thea
tre, Euphronia's affirmative team will
meet representatives from Mill's College,
while on Friday, March 6, the Euphronia
negative team will meet San Jose State
College.
Unusual arrangements for the debate
have been made. There will be two men
on a team. Rebuttals will follow the or
der of the main speeches. There will be
a three minute affirmative closing, which
time will be taken out of the time granted
for the affirmative rebuttals.
A feature worthy of note is the fact
that members of the audience will be
able to interrupt each debater twice dur
ing his constructive speech, with time
out for the question and answer. This
has never been done -on the Pacific Coast,
| but will be tried out in order to make
J the debates informal and of interest to
