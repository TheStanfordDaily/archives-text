# ALPHA DELTS LOSE TO S.A.E. IN CLOSE FIGHT
## El Tigre Overcomes Sequoia Lead to Gain Victory In Final Minutes 
### 
Sigma Alpha Epsilon's quintet out
scored the fast Alpha Delta Phi team in
a close battle 8 to 6 Friday afternoon.
In the second game El Tigre shot two
goals in the last two minutes to pull the
game with the Sequoia â€¢ I squad out of
the fire with a 9 to 7 score.
The Alpha Delta sarted out with a
rush and gained a lead of two points
before the end of the first half. Their
defence was strong enough to keep the
S. A. E. scoring down, Phil Neer and
Cran Holman at forward and Sid Meeks
at running guard keeping the ball out
of danger. In the last half with McDer
mott and Stevenson leading the attack,
the S. A. E.'s were able to score up two
field goals. The ball see-sawed back and
forth, but the Alpha Delts were unable
to find the hoop.
El Tigre, Sequoia 9-7
El Tigre also furnished thrills in its
tilt with Sequoia. The hall team ran up
a four point lead in the first few minutes
of the game and looked like an easy
winner. El Tigre was behind 7 to 5
until the last two minutes of the game,
when Ruten and Robinson scored enough
points to give them a 9 to 7 win.
With the second round of league con
tests finished the prospective winners in
the eight leagues are shaping up. Alpha
Kappa Lambda and Encina 3\V have the
best record in League 1, as neither team
has been chalked up with a defeat. In
the second league Sigma Alpha Epsilon
is the only team with a clean record, but
the Alpha Delt team is running a strong
sceond.
Sequoia 11, Zeta Psi, and Chi Psi have
won all their games in League 3, but
some of these will be eliminated from
the race in this week's contests. In League
4 Phi Kappa Psi and Encina lE, both
strong teams have succeeded in crushing
all opposition so far. El Toro and Theta
Chi have taken the top berths in League
5, with the Delta Taus, last year's cham
pions, marked with one defeat.
In League 6 Kappa Sigma, Phi Kappa
Sigma, and Phi Delta Theta are sharing
honors at the present. The Breakers
look to be about the strongest team in
League 7 after beating Branner II last
week. In League 8 Theta Xi and the
Encina Basement squad are leading, but
Sigma Chi and Beta Theta Pi have
strong teams which ought to provide a
fight for leadership in the league.

The following games are scheduled for
tomorrow: Breakers vs. Phi Gamma
Delta, Alpha Tau Omega vs. Japanese
| Club, Branner II vs. Encina 2W, Theta
Xi vs. Encina Basement, Delta Upsilon
i vs. Sigma Chi, Delta Kappa Epsilon.
