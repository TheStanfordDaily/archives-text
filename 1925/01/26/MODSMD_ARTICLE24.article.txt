# A 						SPORTS BANQUET
## 
### FEG MURRAY '16 
A Sports Banquet — each course
plucked from the gr§at variety of
games and athletics that go to make
up the sporting world! Everything
from soup to nuts. The soup in this
case being that anual rain-fest, the
Yale-Harvard game, recently served
up in the Yale Bowl. The nuts, of
course are those super-comedians of the
diamond, Nick Altrock and A1 Schacht.

The Fish course —that Carp-Tunney
affair, called Fowl by many—is only a
preliminary to the "piece-de-resistance"
of the evening—the Wills-Dempsey
bout. From all indications it appears
that the principals of this affair —
whether you take dark meat or white —
will be rather old before they are
served up. But what a fight it might
be! The fans have been chewing on it

in anticipation for years.
Lettuce pass over that dainty mor
sel, "The Chicken Salad," with only
the usual comment about "very little
dressing." For dessert we have a
snappy French pastry, with Suzanne
taking the pasting. Two fighters, Mike
McTigue and Tiger Flowers, are the
Cheese and the Small Black, respec
tively, though, as Johnny Wilson

knows, the Tiger is not so small as, to
be trifled with.
"Vin Rouge" might be served on the
side in the shape of Red Grange, while
cigarettes are to be had, thanks to
Babe Ruth's "Home Runs." For the
golfer there is "green tee," with a
glass of milk for a water hazard and
the sugar bowl for a sand trap. Tris, of
course, is the after dinner Speaker.
