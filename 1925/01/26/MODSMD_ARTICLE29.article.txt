Though modern fire trucks have
been introduced on the campus, the
days of Old Dobbin have not been for
gotten by the firemen.
There was a time when the horses'
care and accoutrements were of prime

have not been forsaken. Every day at
noon the firemen gather in front of the
fir<j station, on a spot of ground worn
smooth of grass, with a stake at each
end —to tenderly finger the horseshoe.
