# Clear Weather Aids Scientists in Study Of Eclipse Saturday
## 
### 
Clear weather in the New England
states during the eclipse shortly after
nine o'clock, Eastern Standard Time,
Saturday, considerably aided scientists in
their investigations. However, at Michi
gan and Ontario clouds interfered with
observations.
The path of the shadow ran from Iron
Mountain, Michigan, across New York
to New Haven, Conecticut, and thence
out to sea and north of England. Total
ity which lasted for approximately two
minutes was on the average four seconds
later than astronomers had anticipated.
Cornell and Yale universities were al
most in the center of the totality area
and scientific staffs of both institutions
reported excellent observations. New
York City saw its first total eclipse in
119 years.
Concerted efforts to note the effect of
the eclipse on radio transmission and re
ception were crowned with remarkable
success. Iron Mountain, Michigan, where
the shadow of the eclipse commenced re
ported a slight increase in clarity and
volume of the wireless. At Waterbury,
Connecticut, a departure from the direc
tion of the tone wave was noted.
