# Sapero Holds Meeting For First-Year Women
## 
### 
Jim Sapero, '28, class president, held
a meeting of the freshman women in
the library at Roble Wednesday. A
motion was passed that the members
of the freshman football team receive
individual loving cups in recognition
of their past season's performance.
This was similar to a motion already
passed by the freshman men at an
earlier meeting. Anne Bancroft was
appointed chairman of a committee to
have charge of a get-together dance
for tl;e freshman men and women. The
date for this dance has not been set.
