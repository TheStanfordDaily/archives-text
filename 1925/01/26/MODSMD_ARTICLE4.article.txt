# Ruth Spilman, Grove Day Win Puzzle Contest
## 
### 
Ruth Lee Spilman and A. Grove Day
are the winners of the Dramatic Coun
cil's cross-word puzzle contest, accord
ing to an anouncement made by Del
mer Daves today. Miss Spilman de
feated Day by the margin of a special
delivery stamp.
Circumstances would indicate that
the two leading contestants conquered
the blind alleys, mystifying key-words,
and a labyrinth of confusing word con
glomerations at approximately the
same time. Miss Spilman took the best
Uncle Sam had to offer in the way of
delivery, and thereby won first honors.
Day has anounced his intention of
storing up a vast amount of special
delivery stamps for future protection
against the wiles of women.
All that remains of the contest is
for the winners to call Palo Alto 940
and claim their seats for "You and I;"
and for the dramatic manager to dis
pose of the stacks of wrong, late, and
otherwise unfit answers.
