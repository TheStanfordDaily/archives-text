# VARSITY DEFEATED IN SECOND GAME WITH IRELAND
## Marty Griffin's Mound Work Responsible for 5 to 0 Independent Win 
### 
Cliff Ireland's aggregation of profession
al baseball players repeated their per
formance of the week before and dealt
the varsity nine a 5 to 0 defeat on the
local diamond Saturday afternoon.
Marty Griffin who did the mound work
for the Independents was largely respon
sible for their victory. He kept the var
sity down to four hits, and in the eighth
inning ruined Stanford's only chance to
score by catching a hot liner hit by
Johnston.. At that time Oviatt was on
third, Roberts was on second, and there
were two outs.
Oviatt Replaces Aydelotte
Aydelotte started the contest for the
varsity but after allowing two runs he
was replaced in the second inning by
Oviatt. Oviatt shut the Independents out
for the remainder of the inning, but al
lowed one run in each of the next two
frames. The next four innings he held
the visitors well in hand, but in the ninth
he got himself in a bad scrape, escaping
rather easily after letting in one run.
Solomon has been shifted from the
delivering to the receiving end and he
handled the backstop position in a very
creditable fashion. He is the best man
that Wolter has had catching this year.
Jim Lawson was in a suit, but was not
called upon.
The Stanford infield played ragged
ball, having four errors chalked against
it, but the outfield played an errorless
game. Stewart in left field was easily
the star of the game. In the ninth inning
he made a shoestring catch of a long
drive that seemed almost impossible to
get. He also nabbed two or three other
long flies in a less sensational manner.
"Bus" McCandless in right pulled one off
the fence in the first inning that looked
good for two bases, and Dave Brown in
center handled all that came his way
admirably.
Marty Griffin is a hard man to hit;
but nevertheless the varsity seems to be
in the same predicament that it was in
last season at this time. Only four hits
were tallied to their credit. Oviatt ac
counted for two of these, Brown for one,
and Solomon for the other.
Independents Are Strong
Ireland's formidable array of Coast
Leaguers and gemi-pros played errorless
ball, and were connecting with the sphere
frequently. His team yesterday was one
of the strongest that has visited the farm
for several years.
At first base Cliff had George Arm
strong of the Kansas City Blues, who is
ordinarily a third baseman. He covered
his territory flawlessly. Montague, Cliff's
youthful protege was on third, and
Ritchie and Burmeister alternated for the
catching berth. Ritchie is with the Seals
and Burmeister is a semi-pro player.
Other stars playing with Cliff were
Corrigan, Kerr, Tanner, Schorr, Gearin,
and O'Keefe.
Ireland Gets Hit
The feature of the game was a Texas
leaguer hit by none other than Cliff
Ireland. However, Cliff's joy was short
lived for Shorty Roberts pulled the hid
den ball trick and a quick throw to
Johnston caught the old boy napping off
first base. Despite vigorous protests and
threats the umpire ruled him off the field.

"Bus" McCandless in right pulled one off
the fence in the first inning that looked
good for two bases, and Dave Brown in

admirably.
Marty Griffin is a hard man to hit;
but nevertheless the varsity seems to be
in the same predicament that it was in
last season at this time. Only four hits
were tallied to their credit. Oviatt ac
counted for two of these, Brown for one,
and Solomon for the other.
Independents Are Strong
Ireland's formidable array of Coast
Leaguers and gemi-pros played errorless
ball, and were connecting with the sphere
frequently. His team yesterday was one
of the strongest that has visited the farm
for several years.
At first base Cliff had George Arm
strong of the Kansas City Blues, who is
ordinarily a third baseman. He covered
his territory flawlessly. Montague, Cliff's
youthful protege was on third, and
Ritchie and Burmeister alternated for the
catching berth. Ritchie is with the Seals
and Burmeister is a semi-pro player.
Other stars playing with Cliff were
Corrigan, Kerr, Tanner, Schorr, Gearin,
and O'Keefe.
Ireland Gets Hit
The feature of the game was a Texas
leaguer hit by none other than Cliff
Ireland. However, Cliff's joy was short
lived for Shorty Roberts pulled the hid
den ball trick and a quick throw to
Johnston caught the old boy napping off
first base. Despite vigorous protests and
threats the umpire ruled him off the field.

Ireland's Independents: Griffn and

Stanford Varsity: Aydelotte and Solo
mon, Oviatt and Solomon.
Cliff Ireland's aggregation of profession
al baseball players repeated their per
formance of the week before and dealt
the varsity nine a 5 to 0 defeat on the
local diamond Saturday afternoon.
Marty Griffin who did the mound work
for the Independents was largely respon
sible for their victory. He kept the var
sity down to four hits, and in the eighth
inning ruined Stanford's only chance to
score by catching a hot liner hit by
Johnston.. At that time Oviatt was on
third, Roberts was on second, and there
were two outs.
Oviatt Replaces Aydelotte
Aydelotte started the contest for the
varsity but after allowing two runs he
was replaced in the second inning by
Oviatt. Oviatt shut the Independents out
for the remainder of the inning, but al
lowed one run in each of the next two
frames. The next four innings he held
the visitors well in hand, but in the ninth
he got himself in a bad scrape, escaping
rather easily after letting in one run.
Solomon has been shifted from the
delivering to the receiving end and he
handled the backstop position in a very
creditable fashion. He is the best man
that Wolter has had catching this year.
Jim Lawson was in a suit, but was not
called upon.
The Stanford infield played ragged
ball, having four errors chalked against
it, but the outfield played an errorless
game. Stewart in left field was easily
the star of the game. In the ninth inning
he made a shoestring catch of a long
drive that seemed almost impossible to
get. He also nabbed two or three other
long flies in a less sensational manner.

Ireland's Independents: Griffn and
Ritchie, Griffn and Burmeister.
Stanford Varsity: Aydelotte and Solo
mon, Oviatt and Solomon.
Cliff Ireland's aggregation of profession
al baseball players repeated their per
formance of the week before and dealt
the varsity nine a 5 to 0 defeat on the
local diamond Saturday afternoon.
Marty Griffin who did the mound work
for the Independents was largely respon
sible for their victory. He kept the var
sity down to four hits, and in the eighth
inning ruined Stanford's only chance to
score by catching a hot liner hit by
Johnston.. At that time Oviatt was on
third, Roberts was on second, and there
were two outs.
Oviatt Replaces Aydelotte
Aydelotte started the contest for the
varsity but after allowing two runs he
was replaced in the second inning by
Oviatt. Oviatt shut the Independents out
for the remainder of the inning, but al
lowed one run in each of the next two
frames. The next four innings he held
the visitors well in hand, but in the ninth
he got himself in a bad scrape, escaping
rather easily after letting in one run.
Solomon has been shifted from the
delivering to the receiving end and he
handled the backstop position in a very
creditable fashion. He is the best man
that Wolter has had catching this year.
Jim Lawson was in a suit, but was not
called upon.
The Stanford infield played ragged
ball, having four errors chalked against
it, but the outfield played an errorless
game. Stewart in left field was easily
the star of the game. In the ninth inning
he made a shoestring catch of a long
drive that seemed almost impossible to
get. He also nabbed two or three other
long flies in a less sensational manner.
"Bus" McCandless in right pulled one off
the fence in the first inning that looked
good for two bases, and Dave Brown in
center handled all that came his way
admirably.
Marty Griffin is a hard man to hit;
but nevertheless the varsity seems to be
in the same predicament that it was in
last season at this time. Only four hits
were tallied to their credit. Oviatt ac
counted for two of these, Brown for one,
and Solomon for the other.
Independents Are Strong
Ireland's formidable array of Coast
Leaguers and gemi-pros played errorless
ball, and were connecting with the sphere
frequently. His team yesterday was one
of the strongest that has visited the farm
for several years.
At first base Cliff had George Arm
strong of the Kansas City Blues, who is
ordinarily a third baseman. He covered
his territory flawlessly. Montague, Cliff's
youthful protege was on third, and
Ritchie and Burmeister alternated for the
catching berth. Ritchie is with the Seals
and Burmeister is a semi-pro player.
Other stars playing with Cliff were
Corrigan, Kerr, Tanner, Schorr, Gearin,
and O'Keefe.
Ireland Gets Hit
The feature of the game was a Texas
leaguer hit by none other than Cliff
Ireland. However, Cliff's joy was short
lived for Shorty Roberts pulled the hid
den ball trick and a quick throw to
Johnston caught the old boy napping off
first base. Despite vigorous protests and
threats the umpire ruled him off the field.
