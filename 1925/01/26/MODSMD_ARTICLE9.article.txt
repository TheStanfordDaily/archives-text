# OAKLAND FIVE GIVES WAY TO FRESHMEN IN COLORLESS GAME
## 
### 
Holding a safe lead throughout the
entire game, the freshman quintet had
little trouble in winning over the Oak
land Technical high school team in
the pavilion Saturday night in a pre
liminary to the Varsity-Nevada clash.
The final score stood 21 to 12.
Vincenti and Crist tied for high
point honors when each accounted for
six points. Crist, who has only recently
returned to the squad, was the bright
light for the freshmen in all the of
fensive work, showing some fast floor
work and rapid-fire passing.
Early in the first quarter Vincenti
took the ball down the court and hung
up a two-point lead that was never
passed. Oakland's quintet had plenty
of shots throughout the early part of
the game but was unable to make
many of them count.
Freshmen Poor at Passing
The babes experienced one of their
worst nights for passing when they
continually sent the ball into their op
ponents' hands. It was one of these
passes directly into a high school lad's
hands that enabled them to make the
first tally.
At the end of the first quarter the
first-year outfit had doubled the visi
tors, holding the large end of a 6 to 3
score. In the second period Crist and
Dennis each tallied, leaving the score
at half time 10 to 3.
Many Substitutions Made
The greater part of that period was
spent in sending substitutes in for
both teams. During this time Moore
went in for Crist and Snyde replaced
Vincenti.
Crist went in again at the beginning
of the last half and got away to a
flying start, sinking two baskets in a
row right after the tip-offs.
In the remainder of the period,
Aingers and Atkinson of the Oakland
team counted for nine points with two
field goals and five free throws. Mean
while, Dennis, Crist, Vincenti, and Nye
added eleven more to the babe count,
leaving the final score 21 to 12.
Biaginni played most of the game
at standing guard for the 1928 outfit.
Mike Reynolds went in at this position
for a few moments and looked good.
Meanwhile "Husky" Hunt sent TJige
low in at forward. Even though Uige
low does weigh something like two
hundred pounds he is able to get
around the floor fast enough to work
fairly well with the offense.
