1 Toppers of New Spring
I Stuffs Arrived Yesterday
They're beauties! Entirely new tcpcoat shades,
light and lively, like sky grey, London lavender and
fawn tan. Patterns are tastefully simple.
Right off the bat, yesterday, we sold several to
students. This week we ought to sell a dozen
more. Excuse our enthusiasm, but you will under
stand when you see one of these new toppers on
yourself before the mirror.
135 to 45 dollars
