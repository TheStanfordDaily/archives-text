# DR. RAKESTRAWIO PICTURE SWEDISH LIFE IN LECTURE
## Lecturer Tells of Seven-Year Education System in Scandinavia 
### 
"Countries of the Midnight Sun" will
be described by Dr. Norris W. Rake
straw of the Chemistry department,
who after a year and a half of travel
and study in Europe will picture the
life and country of the Scandinavian
peninsula in an illustrated lecture at
7:30 tonight in the Little Theatre.
Dr. Rakestraw will show slides de
picting the magnificent scenery of the
Scandinavian peninsula, and its town
and rural life. A part of Scandinavian
custom different from this country's is
university life. At Upsala, one of the
largest Swedish universities, the
course lasts on an average of seven
years, according to Dr. Rakestraw.
"However, no one cares when the
student gets through," Dr. Rakestraw
explained. "Two examinations must be
passed before the degree is received,
and the student can take them when
ever he deems himself ready, except
that a minimum time must elapse be
tween them."
"The Scandinavians do not care par
ticuarly how much time is spent in
taking the degree, for it is desired
that the student use initiative in learn
ing a subject, and therefore the spe
cific instructions and other aids to
swift learning which make our four
year course possible are not used in
Scandinavia, where the extra three
years is not considered time wasted,"
Dr. Rakestraw continued.
College activities as we know them,
as an integral part of our system, are
not known to the Scandinavian, ac
cording to Dr. Rakestraw, who pointed
out that initiative is developed as
part of the course of study, not outside
of it. "A typical difference between
European students in general and
Americans is this," observed Dr. Rake
straw. "Here we say, 'What is your
major?' while there they ask, 'What
are you reading?'"
