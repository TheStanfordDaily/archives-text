# FRESHMAN AGGREGATIONS IN CONTESTS TOMORROW
## Yearling Diamond Stars Will Meet Palo Alto Team in First Game of Year 
### John Levi 
By John Levi

The yearling baseball nine will re
ceive its first test of the year on the
freshman diamond at 3:30 tomorrow
afternoon when it opposes a pick-up
team from Palo Alto.
The Palo Altans are managed by
their catcher, Mel Pratt; Fortune, a
Portland recruit, will do their mound
work, and the remainder of the squad
is composed chiefly of Oakland Winter
League and San Jose players.
The freshmen have only been prac
ticing three weeks, but they have made
much progress and should be a tough
bunch to beat. "Husky" Hunt has
taken time off from his basketball
squad the last few days and has been
putting his diamond aspirants through
strenuous work-outs.
Philippi Is Best Hurler
So far Philippi is the only twirler
who shows a great deal of promise. He
has a fast and trick side-arm delivery,
which caused the varsity sluggers con
siderable difficulty in a practice game
last week. He is also a fairly heavy
hitter.
Sypher, who will occupy the back
stop position, has shown up well in
practice and is one of the heaviest hit
ters on the squad. He is also capable
of directing the team from behind the
plate.
The infield will be composed of
Thompson at first, Garibaldi at second.
Price at third, and Bush at short. Of
these four men Bush and Garibaldi
show the most promise. Garibaldi han
dies himself well, and, although not a
heavy hitter, he is consistent. Bush,
who obviously lacks experience, should
round into a star shortstop. He has a
good arm and a fine batting eye.
Outfield Strong
In the outfield Hunt has three heavy
sluggers; Nisson, McGuire, and Sim
mons. Nisson originally tried for
catcher but an oversupply of aspirants
for this position made it necessary for
him to be shifted to right field. He is
fast becoming accustomed to this
berth. McGuire will play center and
Simmons will be placed in right.
With one or two exceptions, every
man on the team is a hard and con
sistent hitter, and any difficulty en
countered by the freshmen will no
doubt be due to a dearth of pitchers.
Philippi is going good but it is doubt
ful whether his arm will hold up when
the strenuous schedule begins. Mike
Reynolds, who at the present time is
on the basketball squad, is reputed to
be a good twirler, but it will be
several weeks before he appears in a
uniform. Sobieski has been working
out daily and shows some promise.
