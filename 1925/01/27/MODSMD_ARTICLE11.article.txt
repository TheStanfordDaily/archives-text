# Santa Clara Ready to Give Babe Hoop Squad One Of Hardest Games
## 
### Harry Bennett 
The Stanford freshmen will undoubt
edly faced the hardest game of the
preliminary season when they go
against the Santa Clara first year
quintet tomorrow night in the pavilion
as a preliminary to the Varsity-Davis
Farm clash.
The Santa Clara team is made up
of a fast combination of first-year stu
dents, most of whom played on the
yearling football squad. So far this
season the Missionite babes have been
very successful, winning four out of
five games played.
Broncs Lose to Livermore
The one defeat was at the hands of
the Livermore high school aggrega
tion which usually has been the lead
ing team in their league. The Bronco
babes have been constantly improving
and are now in first-class form.
Coach "Husky" Hunt has made con
siderable changes in his lineup during
the last two games. The forward posi
tions seem well allotted between Vin
centi, Crist, and Moore. Either two
of these work well together but Vin
centi and Crist have tho edge over
the rest of the field by showing more
fight and better floor work while in
the game.
Dennis has the center position
cinched and so far no one has given
Bill Clark any competition at running
guard.
The standing guard position has
been handed around to several candi
dates recently. The most recent pros-
pect is Biaginni. Reynolds is now a
first-string substitute for him. "Windy"
Bigelow, the big two-hundred-pound
former standing guard, has been work
ing out at a forward position. His
weight is somewhat of a handicap for
fast company but so far he has man
aged to keep up with the game.
Freshmen Slump
In the last game the freshmen
seemed to take a slump. The passing
was considerably poorer and fewer
tries for the basket were successful.
Only about one-sixth of the free throws
were counted for points last Saturday.
There are about twenty-one on the
babe squad now and during the last
two games nearly ten of them have
had a regular position on the bench.
So it is very probable that Hunt will
make another cut soon.
With five straight victories already
piled up to their credit, the Cardinal
babe quintet has six more contests on
its schedule before tangling with the
California aggregation.
