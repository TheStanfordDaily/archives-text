# Chappie Stars Prepare For Grilling Contest With Alleged Scribes
## 
### The Old Boy 
With the signing of formal con
i tracts at a late hour last night, an
nouncement was made today of a
basketball game to be played between
the humorists of the Chaparral staff
and the alleged journalists who inhabit
the Daily offices beneath the Old Boy's
feet.
The Daily Palo Alto forces accepted
the Old Boy's conditions and nothing
remains to be done —except the Daily
Palo Alto. Although the Chappies po
litely suggested that the game be post
poned for a month or so, in order that
the Daily staff might have time to
discover that a game was planned, the
news brokers regarded so long a period
of notification as unnecessary. A week
will provide ample time for even a
Daily reporter to hear rumors of an
impending contest, it is fondly hoped.
The formidable array of Chappie
stars include such hoop wizards as
"Nip" McHose, Ken Ferguson, and Art
Bragg. It is understood that the Daily
will attempt to build a team around
Charlie Simons.
