# STANFORD SWIMMERS WILL HAVE HEAVY SCHEDULE
## Water Polo Team Entered in Junior National Championship 
### 
Plans for a heavy schedule are now
being carried out by Ernst Brandsten,
head mentor for the Cardinal splashers
and water poloists. Definite meets in
which Stanford men will compete are
listed up to May 31.
The freshman water polo seven has
thus far held the center of the stage
with its two games with the Olympic
Club Juniors, one clash of which was
played last December and the final of
the series is slated for next Saturday.
Several varsity men will also get their
first taste of action that day when they
compete in the P. A. A. junior meet in
the Post Street pool.
Polo Team Goes South
Perhaps the greatest glamour sur
rounding the activities of the swim
mers emanates from the proposed trip
south of the varsity water polo team.
Brandsten has entered it in the junior
national water polo championships to
be held at the Hollywood Athletic
Club's pool in the latter part of March.
Besides this major exertion several
minor ones in the form of exhibition
games with the Venice Club, Los An
geles A. C., and the Hollywood A. C.,
are now being planed. This trip would
be made in the interim between the
winter and spring quarters.
The winning team of the junior na
tional championships at Los Angeles
will be sent north to compete in the
senior championships which will be
held in San Francisco in April.
