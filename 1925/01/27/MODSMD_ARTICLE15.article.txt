# LEAGUE UPHOLDER POINTS OUT THREE PEACE POSITIONS
## "Political Organization of Entire World to Bring Justice"â€”Holt 
### 
Pointing out three positions which
men can take today on the problem of
world peace, Hamilton Holt, former
editor of the "Independent" and sup
porter of the League of Nations, in
addressing University students at an
assembly today, urged the stand to pro
mote law, and resultance justice and
peace.
The three stands which may be
taken in the matter of world pease are
those of Johnson, Wilson, and Hard
ing, according to Holt. "Johnson advo
cates letting other nations stew in
their own juice," remarked Holt. "This
is a policy impossible for me to con
sider. The Wilson plan of entering the
League is simply a more resolue stand
than that of Harding. Both recognize
the need of a strong world court to
promote international justice. Any
quibbling between these two policies
is simply partisanship."
Tracing the two ways of accomplish
ing ends, reason and force, Holt
showed how the peace movement has
advocated the use of reason, through
the agencies of courts, parliaments,
and executives. Holt reminded his
audience that these agencies have
been the promoters of law within the
nation, and that the peace movement
is nothing but a movement toward do
ing between nations what we have
done within the nation.
"Even after agencies had been pro
vided within the nation for settlement
of disputes by the use of reason, not
force, by the use of law, personal re
dress still continued and was tolerated
for a time," said Holt. "Therefore it is
not surprising that war has continued
after the creation of world courts, and
does not prove that world courts are
not to be the effective settlers of
international disputes, as courts have
been effective within the nation. Fur
thermore, the United States Supreme
Court was in existence three years be
fore settling a case, while the world
court has already settled twenty dis
putes, with justice in every case."
