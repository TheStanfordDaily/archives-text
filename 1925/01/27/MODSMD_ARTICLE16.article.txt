# RAM'S HEAD REHEARSAL SHOWS PROMISE OF GOOD PLAY
## 
### 
Ram's Head rehearsals of both cast
and chorus have progressed t-j such
an extent that the show will he put
together at the end of the week, ac
cording to Dave Mannoccir, director
of the production. This will be a rec
ord for musical plays, as it is usually
not until a week before the show that
the chorus is able to work in conjunc
tion with the cast.
The cast has been rehearsing in the
lobby of the Zoology building, and
every member has memorized Lis
lines, another unusual thing, three
weeks before the show is to be put on.
Differing from Ram's Head shows of
past years, the 1925 production will
contain a great deal of serious acting,
and every part requires a characteriza
tion which must be maintained to the
end. The plot is unusual, and is carried
to an unexpected and dramatic climax.
The chorus is under the direction
of Mrs Henry Lanz, who was formerly
a member of the Imperial Russian bal
let. Mrs. Lanz is working up some
dances which will startle the campus
with their originality and Russian at
mosphere. Although Russian dancing
is acknowledged to be the hardest
form of terpsichorean art, there are
several men who have lisown an amaz
ing aptitude for it, and the dance num
bers of the show will be among the
most interesting parts.
