# What Price Materialism?

Is the word "materialism" a term of reproach? Should we feel apolo
getic for this era when we call it a materialistic age?
President Darwin P. Kingsley of the New York Life Insurance Com
pany, in an address delivered at the opening of the new building of the
School of Business at Columbia University, answers with an emphatic
negative.
"It lias hitherto been the practice of scholars," declared Mr. Kingsley,
"to look a little bit askance at business men, partly because business men
have not been what we call educated men, partly because their work was
classified in the minds of the so-calted scholars as being materialistic. . . .
"We shall all agree that this age differs almost violently from all earlier
ages, and if it is materialistic, if that word clearly differentiates it, then it
seems to me that we must either admit the inferiority of our age because it
is materialistic, or pointing out its obvious superiority, insist that it holds
that rank, not in spite of its materialism, but because of it.
"This is indeed the freest, the most useful, the most prophetic, the
most progressive, the most inspiring age of all. It is materialistic, and it is
so because it has made a long advance toward the conquest of those ma
terial limitations which earlier made the masses of men slaves. . . .
"Teach your students to be proud of a materialism that annihilates
ancient barriers, that discovers and organizes new words, that brings a
fuller life and real happiness to rich and poor alike."
We are glad to see' someone bold enough to put in a good word for
materialism, in the higher meaning of that misused word, just as we are
always glad to see someone stand up for a reasonable and just conserva
tism. Such terms are not fashionable. Words like "idealism," "liberal
ism," "socialism" sound so much more "advanced."
But what class of men is it that keeps governments, businesses, families,
solidly on their feet? What class of men is it that endows universities,
hospitals, Foundations like the Rockefeller and the Carnegie Foundations?
What class of men are the fathers of most of us —fathers who provide
decently for their families, who educate their children, who believe in order
and justice, who pay taxes to support jails, insane asylums and poor houses,
which neither they nor theirs are likely to occupy? We suspect that they
are generally conservative men endowed with a wholesome, practical ideal
ism. but by no means contemptuous of the material $ide of life.
Materialism used in the "dollar diplomacy" sense is a stench in the
nostrils of every thinking man. When used, however, to denote a frame
of mind which has its ideals but which couples-them with a knowledge of'
facts and practicability materialism means strength.—Daily Princctonuin.

picture for the sake of a "uniform appearance." The old and opinionated
Stanford rough had best stay away from the locality, in order to avoid
making it a motion picture.
