Editor of the Daily Palo Alto,
Campus.
Dear Sir:
A recent editorial in the "Daily" commented on the increased interest in
intramural basketball at Encina Gymnasium. We feel as does the writer of
the editorial that the gymnasium improvements make the place more popular
and we are glad that this and the improved service are appreciated. However,
there is a more intangible influence that I believe is really behind the
intramural spirit. Stanford intercollegiate teams have started to win in major
as well as minor sports. As a result Qf this the athletic morale of the student
body is climing. Due credit is due the men in charge of intramural sports
who are responsible for the necessary organization, which is and has been
efficient. Cheerful surroundings and efficient gymnasium management are a
valuable secondary aid. But most essential is the spirit of the student body
and for the improvement in this spirit we should thank our varsity and
freshman teams. That is the contribution of intercollegiate athletics to
intramural sports.
Very truly yours,
WILLIAM H. BARROW.
