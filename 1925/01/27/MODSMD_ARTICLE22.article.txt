Someone once said, "It's jolly hell
when you've made a fool out of your
self!" It is.

But, "Let us go on with experiments;
Let us dare, and dream, and do;
Someday we may make a world
With a buttercup in it,
Or do something that will please
everybody!"

The California Legislature wants us
to stop quarreling. Senator Y. Canepa
of San Francisco placed a resolution
before it Friday asking the University
of California and Stanford to "settle
their differences with the University
of Southern California over of athletic
standards."
Speaking of paternal governments!
We can't even have a good quarrel
without grave heads shaking in dis
approval.
If every event went just as it should
—there wouldn't be any event. It is
the thing that you don't think is going
to happen which makes life worth
living at all.
And then again, if we thought that
there weren't grave heads disapprov
ing of every other thing we do —where
would be the fun in doing them?
There is nothing so deadening as
indifference . . . not even ridicule.
