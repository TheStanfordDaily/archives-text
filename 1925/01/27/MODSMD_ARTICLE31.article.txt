## It Can Happen in Golf 
### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 + 
Anything can happen in golf, and the things that can happen are both
humorous and tragic. Men have been killed 011 the links by being hit by golf
balls, and when you consider the fact that the initial velocity of a driven ball
is 500 feet per second, it is surprising that more people so struck are nof
fatally injured.
Mr. Wakasugi, the Japanese Ambassador at London in 1923, affords the only
known incident —or accident —of a golfer knocking himself out. The Honorable
Far-Easternerer, playing the ancient and honorable game one day at Chisle
hurst, drove and hit a guide-post, the ball rebounding and striking him on the
forehead, knocking him unconscious. "Anything Can Happen" when a Japanese
plays a Scotch game—even hara-kiri.
Golf balls go in strange places, too. Add this one to the list—a drive at
Neasden, England, that traveled 170 yards and rested inside a hollow papier
mache cylinder on the top of the pin used as a flag for the hole.
. You've read of the woman golfer who climbed a tree and played a perfect
shot out of a bird's nest up in the branches. The late Dick Trimble of St.
Louis, who was killed in the war, played a shot out of a rowboat. His mashie
shot, instead of clearing the water hole, dropped into a boat drifting by. Dick
got another boat, rowed out to where his ball was lying, climbed aboard and
reached the green on his first attempt.
