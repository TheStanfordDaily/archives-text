# SEVENTH INNING STRETCH

"Stanford has a good second base
man, too," says Cliff.
* * *
After Cliff got his anual hit he could
not run around the bases. It was
against the doctor's orders.

Ritchie, the Ireland backstop, saved
four women from death in a recent
fire in San Francisco before the fire
department arrived on the scene. Cliff
says that it's no boost for Ritchie, it's
just a slam on the fire department.

The baseball season is upon us, and
from all indications it is going to be
a victorious one.
* * *
If a bat is broken during one of the
Ireland games it is found stimulating
a fire in Cliff's home the next day. He
never bothers to bring any of his own
willows here, but he usually manages
to take the fragments of one or more
home.

If cameramen ever do infest the
lot Cliff will have to put the old red
flannel shirt he wears into hock and get
one that blends more harmoniously
with the landscape. Maybe he can in
duce Sam Bohne to have the Cincinnati
Reds change their color.

Cliff was quite insulted last, week
when he heard that he was being ac
cused of stepping in front of a pitched
ball to gain his base. He. indignantly
asked, "Do I look crazy?"
* * *
Cliff is another argument against
the supposition that golf is bad for
baseball players. Although he is back
ward about confessing it, Cliff has

been pursuing the white pellet with
fervor lately and it hasn't noticeably
affected either his playing or his talk
ing.
* * *
The main objection that is being
voiced against baseball in western col
leges is that it is not a suitable sport
for concerted bleacher cheering. Per
haps a number of the men who
queened to the game Saturday are just
as glad.
* * *
Judging from the variety of cos
tumes that were seen at Saturday's
game, the cameramen will soon be
giving Longchamps and Ascot the go
by for the good old varsity diamond.
Attention, Vanity Fair!!

Varsity primer for the edification of
our freshman readers:
"Lefty" May is not right-handed.
"Shorty" Roberts is not tall.
"Skipper" Cuddeback isn't a mil
lionaire yacht owner.
