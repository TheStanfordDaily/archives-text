# TENNIS TOURNAMENT WILL BE CONTINUED FOR SEVEN WEEKS
## 
### 
! Neither the varsity nor freshman
tennis list was materially changed by
the first week's play of the ranking
tournament that is now in progress.
The original ranking was compiled by
Coach Hal Davis, Captain Harold Over
felt, and Manager Henry Willis, on the
basis of past performances of the
aspirants.
The first week, number one played
number two, number three played num
ber four, and so on. This week num
ber two will play number three, num
ber four will play number five, and
so on.
After this week and one more week
the contestants will be obligated to
play two matches a week instead of
one for a period of five weeks. At the
end of three weeks of this harder
schedule the squads will be cut per
manently to ten men.
According to Hal Davis, when a
match is to be played, it is the duty
of the man lowest on the list to make
arrangements with his competitor.
