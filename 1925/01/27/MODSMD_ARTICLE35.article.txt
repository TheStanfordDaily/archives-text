# Asilomar Conference Plans Provide for Entertainment
## 
### 
Plans for the Asilomar Conference
this week-end have been completed
and include provision for both rest and
entertainment as well as for more seri
ous matters. Although the week-end
gathering is primarily a conference,
women who go are entirely free to
spend the whole time in idleness or
diversion as they see fit.
Swimming, riding, hiking, games,
campfire stunts and stories, and get
together affairs are included in the
program, and there will be ample op
portunity for sheer laziness and rest.
Women who go will meet representa
tives from other parts of California,
and possibly from Arizona. Because of
the enthusiasm shown by those who
went to the house party at Asilomar
last quarter those in charge hope that
Stanford will be well represented at
this conference. All who have not yet
signed and wish to go, should sisrn at
once with Miss Capps.
