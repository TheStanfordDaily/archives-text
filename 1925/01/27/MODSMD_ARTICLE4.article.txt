# Daily Sleuths Prepare For Grilling Contest With Alleged Humorists
## 
### Young Man 
Arrangements have been completed
for the most important athletic event
of the year. The Daily sleuths have
challenged the alleged humorists that
reign supreme above the Daily Sanc
tum to a hoop contest.
The Old Boy hammered out bis ap
proval and now nothing remains to be
done —aside from playing the game.
The Chappies vainly want the contest
postponed until after their next issue
appears, for they believe that some of
the Daily stars will laugh themselves
sick over the supposedly wise cracks.
The formidable array of Daily stars
includes such men as Charlie Simons,
Wallace Knox, and Cliff Moore. The
Chappies' sole hope will be "Nip" Mc-
Hose, who is reputed to be a fair
player.
