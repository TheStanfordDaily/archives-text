# MEN'S, WOMEN'S TASTES ARE ANALYZED BY DIRECTOR
## 
### Byron Williams 
When asked about the differences in
tastes between the men eating at En
cina and the women at Roble, Miss
Etta Handy, director of all University
supervised meals, said that when
everything was considered, tastes did
not differ to any great extent —quan-
tity alone forms the principal distinc
tion.
Greatest of all differences is the
amount of meat consumed, for the
women use only three-fourths as much
as the men. However, the former de
mand higher quality and finer cuts, and
as a consequence the meat cost per
person is approximately the same.
Coffee seems to supply another de
cided difference in quantity of con
sumption since women use only a
small proportion in comparison with
their more hardy rivals. The general
subject of coffee brings forth the fol
lowing quotation from Miss Handy re
garding the Union store: "Sixty-four
cups every forty-five minutes; 500 cups
a day!" Coffee seems to be a popular
indoor pastime for Stanford men.
Men Like Milk
The amounts of tea, milk, and cocoa
used are about the same for the indi
vidual, which is a surprising statement
when it is remembered that such
drinks are considered by many as
being "feminine." Last October the
Encina dining halls used almost 3000
gallons of milk, an average of six gal
lons for each man.
Incidentally, it might be mentioned
that the 210 women eating at Roble are
saving an aggregate sum of $7000 a
year, exclusive of the Summer quarter,
which is a real saving of $35 per
person. This has been accomplished
by the University taking over the man
agement of the kitchen and operating
it on a co-operative basis.
