# CALIFORNIA BASKETBALL TEAMS ROUNDING INTO SHAPE; VARSITY BEING STRENGTHENED
## 
### 
After playing mediocre ball for sev
eral weeks, the Bear basketball team
is gradually rounding into shape and
is now playing a good passing game.
Coach Price is concentrating all his
efforts on a fast passing game for he
realizes that this is the only sort of a
game that the Bruins will win with
this season, if they hope to retain the
conference title.
In the hope of developing some
likely material, Coach Price has kept
fifteen men on the varsity squad and
has been working them as much as
possible. Many of the second-string
men are playing exceptionally good
ball at the present time and are giv
ing the veterans a battle for regular
berths on the team. Watson, last year's
freshman center, showed his ability
in the Cal. Aggie game by caging the
majority of the points the Bruins
made. Robie and Clement at forward
are also playing up to par on the
varsity. Davis, Crow, and Fletcher form
a good reserve defense, giving Coach
Price plenty of material to choose
from.
Ladar at Forward
The most likely-looking five is
Belasco and Carver at guard, Higgins,
center, Captain Ladar, and either
Holmes or Jorgenson at forward. Jor
genson, a find from Utah, is playing a
fast game and giving Benny Holmes,
a veteran of last season, a run for a
regular forward berth.
Under the tutelage of Coach Ned
Kay, the 130-pound basketball team of
the University of California is fast
rounding into shape, and hopes to be
in excellent condition by the time the
annual series with Stanford rolls
around.
The squad has been cut to sixteen
capable men by Coach Kay, and will
probably be cut down to twelve men
next week. This will constitute the
team for the season. The men who
have survived the cut are Leith (cap
tain), Kotta, Smith, Curtis, Anixter,
Blum, and Bepp, forwards, Rasmussen,
Shaw, and Keiffer, centers; Bailey,
Levin, Broadway, Serrafino, Zerpoli,
and Blackwaulder, guards.
The squad is captained by Don
Leith, a veteran of two years on the
130's and one of the most capable
weight cagosters. He plays a flashy
game at forward.

The first game of the Stanford series
will be played as a preliminary to
the California-Stanford varsity con
test, in the Oakland Auditorium, on
February 14. The next game will also
be as a preliminary to the varsity
game. It will be played at Palo Alto a
week later, Saturday, February 21. If
a third game is necessary to settle the
series, it will take place on February
28 at the Oakland Auditorium, as a
preliminary to the fourth varsity game.
Both California and Stanford have
exceptionally good weight teams this
year and some hard-fought games
should result.
Play Stanford
Daring their trip south the Bruin
145's tackled some of the best un
limited teams in the state and did very
well. The weight cagesters hooked up
with eight teams, defeating four and
conceding honors to the other four.
They were victorious over the Bakers
field Owls, University of Redlands,
Santa Barbara State Teachers College,
San Diego First National Bank, Holly
wood Athletic Club, and the Fresno
State Teachers College.
Throughout the series of games the
work of Herman Lifsliiz, fleet-footed
forward, was outstanding. Lifshiz. a
product of Polytechnic High School of
San Francisco, showed great ability in
his floorwork and basket-shooting. He
will certaintly be a great asset to the
1926 Bruin varsity, if he keeps up his
work on the weight squad. The other
members who made the trip, aside
from Coach Ned Kay and Manager
Scott, are Lifshiz, Werner, Meyer,
Labarthe, Killallee, Seeley, and Mag
nesi.
