Kappa Sigma in Torrid Battle
The star game of the day turned
out to be the Kappa Sigma and Encina
4E tussle, which the former team won
20 to 19. In the first half the Kappa
Sigs ran up a three-point lead de
spite the efforts of "Red" Moore and
Sheffield, who rang up scores for the
freshmen.
The real fireworks started in the I
second half. The Encina five passed
the Kappa Sigs and held a one-point
lead. Middleton caged a short shot for
the Row squad, but Moore tallied a
long throw in the last two minutes.
With the game looking like Encina's,
Middleton tipped the ball in again just
before the final whistle. Moore scored
four field goals for the freshmen, and
"Tex" starred for the Kappa Sigs with
a like number, all made in the second
half.
Former Champs Lose Again
The Delta Taus fought with El Toro
all the way but lost 10 to 8. Most of
the scoring came in the first half when
the two fives ended all even with
seven points each. In the second half
the club squad broke through the Delta
Tau defense and scored one field goal,
which with a foul shot was enough to
put the game on ice for them.
Theta Chi had a tough job disposing
of the little-touted Encina 4\V quintet.
With Dice and Green popping in bas
kets at the start of the game, the
fraternity men looked like easy win
ners. But the light hall team carried
the game to them in the second half
and almost scored a victory with the
fast work of Garibaldi and I3usch.
Theta Chi squeezed out with a single
point margin 8 to 7.
Encina 3E took an easy win from
the Phi Sigma Kappa five with the
help of Altaffer and Hill. The score
was never close and the Phi Sigs were
not able to cope with the fast shooting
of Stewart, the Hall men winning 16
to 10. The Alpha Sigs had little diffi
culty in defeating Kappa Alpha, with
Ferguson ringing up thirteen points
i for his team. Both teams had a defense
! easy to penetrate but Alpha Sigma Phi
i had the edge with Acres and Lockett
to help Ferguson with the scoring.
Contests scheduled for tomorrow
are: Alpha Kappa Lambda vs. Encina
3W, El Cuadro vs. El Capitan, Branner
; I vs. Theta Delta Chi, El Campo vs.
Alpha Delta Phi, and Sigma Alpha

Kappa Sigma in Torrid Battle
The star game of the day turned
out to be the Kappa Sigma and Encina
4E tussle, which the former team won
20 to 19. In the first half the Kappa
Sigs ran up a three-point lead de
spite the efforts of "Red" Moore and
Sheffield, who rang up scores for the
freshmen.
The real fireworks started in the I
second half. The Encina five passed
the Kappa Sigs and held a one-point
lead. Middleton caged a short shot for
the Row squad, but Moore tallied a
long throw in the last two minutes.
With the game looking like Encina's,
Middleton tipped the ball in again just
before the final whistle. Moore scored
four field goals for the freshmen, and
"Tex" starred for the Kappa Sigs with
a like number, all made in the second
half.
Former Champs Lose Again
The Delta Taus fought with El Toro
all the way but lost 10 to 8. Most of
the scoring came in the first half when
the two fives ended all even with
seven points each. In the second half
the club squad broke through the Delta
Tau defense and scored one field goal,
which with a foul shot was enough to
put the game on ice for them.
Theta Chi had a tough job disposing
of the little-touted Encina 4\V quintet.
With Dice and Green popping in bas
kets at the start of the game, the
fraternity men looked like easy win
ners. But the light hall team carried
the game to them in the second half
and almost scored a victory with the
fast work of Garibaldi and I3usch.
Theta Chi squeezed out with a single
point margin 8 to 7.
Encina 3E took an easy win from
the Phi Sigma Kappa five with the
help of Altaffer and Hill. The score
was never close and the Phi Sigs were
not able to cope with the fast shooting
of Stewart, the Hall men winning 16
to 10. The Alpha Sigs had little diffi
culty in defeating Kappa Alpha, with
Ferguson ringing up thirteen points
i for his team. Both teams had a defense
! easy to penetrate but Alpha Sigma Phi
i had the edge with Acres and Lockett
to help Ferguson with the scoring.
Contests scheduled for tomorrow
are: Alpha Kappa Lambda vs. Encina
3W, El Cuadro vs. El Capitan, Branner
; I vs. Theta Delta Chi, El Campo vs.
