# PLAYERS IN 'YOU AND I' READY FOR FIRST CALL
## First Production of Harvard Play on Pacific Coast To Be Seen Friday 
### Douglas Meservey 
By Douglas Meservey

Infectious humor and, pathos that is
uncannily real will be seen on the
Assembly hall stage next Friday night,
when Masquers Society presents "You
and I," the Harvard Prize play of 1922.
A comedy-drama that is so true to life
it will make the audience feel that
they are "looking in" on the experi
ences of an average American family,
"You and I" is expected to reach the
heights of ease and naturalness in
dramatic presentation.
The humor of the play centers large
ly around the activities of the maid,
Etta, played by Peggy Randall, of
"Dulcy" fame. Etta is a "diamond in
the rough," uneducated, but with a
burning passion to be a "lady." The
second act shows the attic of the
White home, where Maitland White
has established a studio. It is here that
Etta goes to "play lady," and her at
tempts to acquire a polished conversa
tion, accompanied by the appropriate
gestures, provide some of the most
delicious comedy of the play. Her vari
ations of the pronunciation of the
world "golf" finally end in "gawf"
which suits her so well that she uses
it to the consternation of the White
family.
Robertson Expresses Pathos
The pathos of "You and I" is ex
pressed by Maitland White (Alan Rob
ertson), when he says, talking to his
son Rickey, "If you feel that you've
something it's your destiny to do —
something out of the beaten path, un
usual, difficult, then you had better
begin your married life doing it, or
the chances are it will never be done."
Maitland wanted to be an artist as a
boy, and then gave up his dreams in
order to marry Nancy. His son Rod
erick is facing the same dilemna, and
it takes all the ingenuity of both fath
er and mother to straighten out the
difficulties and start him out happily.
The lines of "You and I" are ex
tremely clever, with humor and na
turalness evident throughout the play.
Critics have unanimously praised the
production, and Stanford is fortunate
in securing the rights to present it, as
this will be its first performance on
the Pacific Coast.
Tickets are still on sale at the office
of the Alumni Secretary in the Admin
istration building, at 75 cents and $1.

Infectious humor and, pathos that is
uncannily real will be seen on the
Assembly hall stage next Friday night,
when Masquers Society presents "You
and I," the Harvard Prize play of 1922.
A comedy-drama that is so true to life
it will make the audience feel that
they are "looking in" on the experi
ences of an average American family,
"You and I" is expected to reach the
heights of ease and naturalness in
dramatic presentation.
The humor of the play centers large
ly around the activities of the maid,
Etta, played by Peggy Randall, of
"Dulcy" fame. Etta is a "diamond in
the rough," uneducated, but with a
burning passion to be a "lady." The
second act shows the attic of the
White home, where Maitland White
has established a studio. It is here that
Etta goes to "play lady," and her at
tempts to acquire a polished conversa
tion, accompanied by the appropriate
gestures, provide some of the most
delicious comedy of the play. Her vari
ations of the pronunciation of the
world "golf" finally end in "gawf"
which suits her so well that she uses
it to the consternation of the White
family.
