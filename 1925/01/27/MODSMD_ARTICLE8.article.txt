# DA VIS FARM WILL MEET CARD FIVE TOMORROW
## Stanford Doped to Continue String of Victories Against Aggies 
### David Meiklejohn 
By David Meiklejohn

Davis Farm will meet the Stanford
five.tomorrow night in the pavilion at
8 o'clock.
The California Aggies are not a re
putedly strong squad and the Cardinals
should easily continue the string of
victories. The California varsity de
feated the Farm quintet in a ragged
early-season game 26 to 10. Neither
team was reported to have displayed
a great deal of class, but the Farm
team looked far the weaker.
Andy Kerr has finally rounded his
basketball material into such shape as
to warrant a bright, if doubtful, sea
son.
Stanford Has Strong Subs
Stanford's strongest point is the high
calibre of its substitute material. In
using the word substitute, however, it
would not be quite fair to those play
ers, who stand on such an even basis
as far as playing ability. The only
difference at present is in experience,
and this has caused less worry than
comment.
Fred Price looks good at the forward
job. His floor work has improved over
fifty per cent since the first of the
season, and his ability to land the ball
in the required spot is just out of
critcism's reach.
It would be hard to feature last
year's Stanford basketball team losing
two men because of personal fouls and
then win against tough opposition. The
situation has changed somewhat this
season. Andy Kerr's "shock troops" do
all the rushing that is necessary, and
the new team continues to do more
rushing without any excess loss of
lung power.
There is still a period through which
the Card team must go before any
definite prediction of the California
games could be reached, but to all ap
pearances Stanford has the best team
—as a team —in two seasons.
