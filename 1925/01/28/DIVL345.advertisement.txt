$3 Buys a
Parker D. Q.
The flashing black Newcomer
made by Duofold Craftsmen
nearest thing made to
-*• a Parker Duofold Pen is the
new D. Q. —meaning Duofold
Quality. It is really a $4 value
—with ★White Gold Girdle,
smart fluted grip, and a pocket
clip; or an extra large ring to
link to your note-book.
More than that it has a jewel
smooth point of 14K gold,
tipped with polished Iridium.
The same Ink-Tight Duo-
Sleeve Cap, Press-Button
Filler, and sure-fire "Lucky
Curve" feed as the Duofold.
You can't beat it—you can't
tie it under $5. All good pen
counters carry this college
creation —or can get it double
quick.
