# BRONCO FRESHMEN MEET STANFORD FIVE TONIGHT
## Missionite Babes Will Present Powerful Combination; Expect Victory 
### Harry Bennett 
Santa Clara's freshman basketball
squad is starting the game against
the Cardinal babes tonight with the
full expectations of carrying home a
victory to avenge their defeat of last
year.
Coach Hal Toso, a former Bronco
varsity player, has gathered together
an excellent collection of first-year
Missionites for his team this year.
According to reports from the south
ern campus these men have been prac
ticing diligently for this encounter and
are in top form.
Babes Have Five Wins
On the other hand "Husky" Hunt
"has a fast bunch that are working
well together. So far this season they
have stacked up five straight victories.
Undoubtedly tonight's clash will be
the hardest before the California
game.
Santa Clara's freshman team is built
around "Red" Chisholm, the youngster
that played both varsity and freshman
football in a highly commendable man
ner last fall. If he goes as well on the
jHoor as he does on the gridiron there
should be plenty of fire in tonight's
game.
Chisholm plays center and has plen
ty of height along with the habit of
getting the touch off from the oppos
ing center.
Roy Dennis, who will go in against
him for the Cardinals, lias been play
ing a fast fighting game and covers
plenty of floor space to advantage.
The Saints will start Haley and
Burnette in the forward positions. Bur
nette is fast and has a good eye for
the basket while his running mate
makes a specialty of feeding him for
shots from under the basket.
Vincenti and Crist will start for the
Redshirts opposing these two. Both of
these forwards have shown improve
ment in their shooting in recent prac
tice. Last week there seemed to be
plenty of shots but not enough baskets.
At the guard positions Conley and
Draper of Santa Clara will oppose
Clark and Biaginni, two Redshirts who
seem to have a good hold on these
first-string places.
The Broncs have been successful
with most their games so far this
season although they have never been
at their full strength. Tonight the best
combination will be complete.
Coach Hal Toso has spent most of
his time drilling his men on the de
fensive work. His five-man combina
tion is going to be a hard one for
the babes to penetrate.

Coach Hal Toso, a former Bronco
varsity player, has gathered together
an excellent collection of first-year
Missionites for his team this year.
According to reports from the south
ern campus these men have been prac
ticing diligently for this encounter and
are in top form.
Babes Have Five Wins
On the other hand "Husky" Hunt
"has a fast bunch that are working
well together. So far this season they
have stacked up five straight victories.
Undoubtedly tonight's clash will be
the hardest before the California
game.
Santa Clara's freshman team is built
around "Red" Chisholm, the youngster
that played both varsity and freshman
football in a highly commendable man
ner last fall. If he goes as well on the
jHoor as he does on the gridiron there
should be plenty of fire in tonight's
game.
Chisholm plays center and has plen
ty of height along with the habit of
getting the touch off from the oppos
ing center.
Roy Dennis, who will go in against
him for the Cardinals, lias been play
ing a fast fighting game and covers
plenty of floor space to advantage.
The Saints will start Haley and
Burnette in the forward positions. Bur
nette is fast and has a good eye for
the basket while his running mate
makes a specialty of feeding him for
shots from under the basket.
Vincenti and Crist will start for the
Redshirts opposing these two. Both of
these forwards have shown improve
ment in their shooting in recent prac
tice. Last week there seemed to be
plenty of shots but not enough baskets.
At the guard positions Conley and
Draper of Santa Clara will oppose
Clark and Biaginni, two Redshirts who
seem to have a good hold on these
first-string places.
The Broncs have been successful
with most their games so far this
season although they have never been
at their full strength. Tonight the best
combination will be complete.
Coach Hal Toso has spent most of
his time drilling his men on the de
fensive work. His five-man combina
tion is going to be a hard one for
the babes to penetrate.
