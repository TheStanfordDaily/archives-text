# BRITISH PREMIER'S SON FINDS POSITION 'NO FUN'
## Malcolm MacDonald Says Americans Make Altogether Too Much Fuss Over Him 
### Robert Littler 
"How does it feel to be the son of
the Prime Minister of England? It
feels perfectly loathsome," said Mal
colm Mac Donald, whose father, Ram
sey Mac Donald, is the head of the
Labor Party of England. "I was glad
he had the decency to resign jyst
after I came to this country. I wouldn't
have been able to stand it. They make
way too much fuss here over a Prime
Minister's son. In England they push
me right off into the gutter."
Malcolm Mac Donald is touring this
country as a member of the Oxford
debating team. He was called upon to
express his views in the midst of a
vigorous wielding of the safety razor
and the dexterity with which he
answered the questions put to him
indicated his long experience with
American interviewers. He readily ex

pressed his views on every subject
requested except the style of Ameri
can women's clothes. He said he
thought American women looked all
right and that was as much as he had
noticed.
"There is only one thing at the
American universities that I really dis
like," he said. "That's the fraternities.
I have often tried to analyze why I
am against them. I think it Is because
I should not like to bo forced to live
in common with so many I like
to get off by myself sometimes."
The recent comment by the London
University student that American col
leges tend toward too much standardi
zation, was called to his attention. "I
like the 'hard Mexican hats,' I think
they are pretty. I never liked corduroy
trousers in England, but I do here. I
am thinking of getting me a pair. But
those caps your freshmen wear—what
do you call them? They are horrible.
"I don't like your system of classes
here, though. When you get up in the
morning you have four or five hours
a day fixed up for you. have to
attend lectures. It's compulsory. At
Oxford we can do as we please. Dur
ing the four years I was at Oxford I
attended six lectures —not six courses
of lectures —six lectures."
When they were in Pomona the Ox
ford debaters attended the Stanford-
Pomona basketball game. "I enjoyed
it," said Mac Donald. "We don't have
basketball in England, except for girls.
I like American football immensely.
The best thing is the cheering. Your
football is as good a game as our
Rugby, but we don't have the cheer
ing."
Malcolm Mac Donald is not at all
what should be expected in the son
of a labor leader. He is an immaculate
dresser from the bottom of his fawn
colored spats to the uppermost ex
tremity of his carefully combed hair.
He speaks with a slight accent, which
is a bit more noticeable off the plat
form than on. His whole personality
is of a warmness which bespeaks the
politician in the highest sense.
"What are you going to do when
you go back?" he was asked.
"Be a reporter. What kind? Oh, mur
der trials and the like. Then in the
next election we are going to try to
win Bassetlaw for Labor. And we'll
succeed, too."
Bassetlaw is the division in which
Malcolm Mac Donald is standing for
parliament.

Over 420 men are on the waiting
list for rooms in Toyon hall. Not all
these applicants can be accommodated,
according to Dean J. B. Culver.

The recent comment by the London
University student that American col
leges tend toward too much standardi
zation, was called to his attention. "I
like the 'hard Mexican hats,' I think
they are pretty. I never liked corduroy
trousers in England, but I do here. I
am thinking of getting me a pair. But
those caps your freshmen wear—what
do you call them? They are horrible.
"I don't like your system of classes
here, though. When you get up in the

Oxford we can do as we please. Dur
ing the four years I was at Oxford I
attended six lectures —not six courses
of lectures —six lectures."
When they were in Pomona the Ox
ford debaters attended the Stanford-
Pomona basketball game. "I enjoyed
it," said Mac Donald. "We don't have
basketball in England, except for girls.
I like American football immensely.
The best thing is the cheering. Your
football is as good a game as our
Rugby, but we don't have the cheer

Malcolm Mac Donald is not at all
what should be expected in the son
of a labor leader. He is an immaculate
dresser from the bottom of his fawn
colored spats to the uppermost ex
tremity of his carefully combed hair.
He speaks with a slight accent, which
is a bit more noticeable off the plat
form than on. His whole personality
is of a warmness which bespeaks the
politician in the highest sense.
"What are you going to do when
you go back?" he was asked.
"Be a reporter. What kind? Oh, mur
der trials and the like. Then in the
next election we are going to try to
win Bassetlaw for Labor. And we'll
succeed, too."
Bassetlaw is the division in which
Malcolm Mac Donald is standing for
parliament.

Over 420 men are on the waiting
list for rooms in Toyon hall. Not all
these applicants can be accommodated,
according to Dean J. B. Culver.
"How does it feel to be the son of
the Prime Minister of England? It
feels perfectly loathsome," said Mal
colm Mac Donald, whose father, Ram
sey Mac Donald, is the head of the
Labor Party of England. "I was glad
he had the decency to resign jyst
after I came to this country. I wouldn't
have been able to stand it. They make
way too much fuss here over a Prime
Minister's son. In England they push
me right off into the gutter."
Malcolm Mac Donald is touring this
country as a member of the Oxford
debating team. He was called upon to
express his views in the midst of a
vigorous wielding of the safety razor
and the dexterity with which he
answered the questions put to him
indicated his long experience with
American interviewers. He readily ex

pressed his views on every subject
requested except the style of Ameri
can women's clothes. He said he
thought American women looked all
right and that was as much as he had
noticed.
"There is only one thing at the
American universities that I really dis
like," he said. "That's the fraternities.
I have often tried to analyze why I
am against them. I think it Is because
I should not like to bo forced to live
in common with so many I like
to get off by myself sometimes."
