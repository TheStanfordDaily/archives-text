# DEKES DOWN BETAS BY SCORE OF 10-6 IN CLOSE GAME
## Japanese Club Shows Class; Hands Alpha Tau Omega 11 to 5 Defeat 
### 
! Delta Kappa Epsilon took a bitterly
contested game from Beta Theta Pi by a 1
10 to 6 score yesterday, forcing the Betas
definitely out of the running for the
championship.
Scores of the other contests are as fol
lows: Breakers Club 3, Phi Gamma
Delta 2; Japanese Club 11, Alpha Omega
5; Branner Second 9, Encina 2W 3;
Theta Xi 12, Encina Basement 5; Sigma;
I Chi won from Delta Upsilon by default.
! The Delta Kappa Epsilon-Beta Theta
Pi struggle was admittedly a battle for
! blood. The Dekes had been pointing for
i the game ever since the start of the series,
and the Betas were anxious to win in order
to stay in the running for the intramural
; title. As a result there was a good deal
|of roughness evident on both sides, but
j only a fair amount of skill.
Smythe of the Dekes rung up the first
| basket on a lucky shot from near the cen-'
ter of the floor, and a few minutes later '
Simons tossed in a free throw for the
; Betas. Adams of the Dekes connected for |
a foul goal to make the count 3 to 1 in
favor of his team at the half. The leaders
| increased their margin during the second
j period as a result of some nice work by
Adams and Ogden. Kissinger, Simons,
and Mannoccir showed best for the Betas.
Breakers Beat Fijis 3-2.
Setting a record for low scoring, the j
i Breakers won from Phi Gamma Delta !
3to 2. The game was more or less of a j
comedy from start to finish, both teams!
throwing the ball everywhere but in the ;
basket. The Fijis failed to put in one
and the Breakers succeeded in registering â– 
] free throw out of about' fourteen attempts,!
one out of about ten chances.
Fancher Bell's foul goal was the only;
bit of scoring done during the first half,;
which enabled the Breakers to lead 1 to 0. ,
Conclit put the Fijis into the lead early in
the second period when he sunk a field
! goal after playing around the basket for
five minutes. Shortly after, Compton
gave the Breakers the advantage with a
basket. The score remained at 3to 2 for
the rest of the game.
Japs Show Class.
Playing a remarkably smooth game,
the Japanese Club downed Alpha Tau
Omega, 11 to 5. The Japs' teamwork was
faultless, and their shooting good. Di
minutive "size is the only factor which
keeps the Orientals from walking away
with championship honors. Mizota and
Murata went particularly well. Japanese
Club held an 8 to 0 lead at half time.
In the second period A. T. O. showed
some semblance of co-ordination for the
first time, and with Hess and Stratton
leading the attack chalked up 5 points.
The score is hardly a true indication of
the Japs' superiority.
Branner Seconds defeated Encina 2W
in a slow, uninteresting contest. Branner
took the lead at the start and was never
headed. At half Encina was trailing 8
to 0. Neisser, Edmundson, and Baer were
the whole works for Branner, while Rae
performed best for Encina.
Theta Xi Trims Encina.
Theta Xi looked good when it walloped
the hitherto undefeated Encina Basement
five 12 to 5. The fraternity men worked
well together and did some fairly consist
ent basket shooting. The babes were evi
dently caught on an off day, as they
failed to exhibit the dash and fire they
have shown in previous games. Theta Xi
was on top 12 to 3at the half. Lawrence
and Murray starred for the winners, while
Cook and Bryant came through well for
Encina.
Delta Upsilon's failure to appear at the
scheduled time gave the game to Sigma
Clii by default, ruining the hitherto per
fect record for the intramural series as
far as forfeits are concerned. Previous
to tonight fifty-eight contests had been
played promptly on schedule.
Tomorrow's games : Encina 2E vs. Se
quoia First, 4:15"; Chinese Club vs. En
cina IW, 4:50; Sequoia Second vs.
Pirates, 7; 15; Zeta Psi vs. Chi Psi, 7:50;
Delta Chi vs. Panthers, 8 :25.
