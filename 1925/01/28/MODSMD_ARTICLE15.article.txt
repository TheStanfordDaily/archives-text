# CARDS FACE DAVIS FARM AGGIES ON COURT TONIGHT
## Games This Week Will End Preliminary Season for Stanford Five 
### 
Davis Farm meets the Varsity basket
ball team in the Pavilion tonight at 8
i o'clock in one of the two remaining pre
liminary games before the California
j scries.
The Farm aggregation is not doped to
give the Cardinals any tough opposition.
Stanford has been going too well in the
: last few games to hold any qualms rela-
I tive to the Cards being nosed out at this
; stage of the season.
There will be more or less of a second
i string line-up used by Andy Kerr, and
men who have not been given a chance on
the court this season will doubtless be seen
, in action against the Aggies tonight.
I There are several of these sitting on the
| bench. Fred Newhouse, who as a fresh
man last year, acquired the nickname of
| "Mocco" has been watching rather than
performing. Newhouse will some day
regularly fill a varsity standing guard
berth, despite the fact he will be used
| little this season.
The Olympic Club game next Saturday
is expected to be another tough workout
for the varsity. The clubmen were suc
| cessful in downing the Bears in an early
; season game. It will be another good
| opportunity to compare the relative
| strength of the Stanford and California
quintets.
