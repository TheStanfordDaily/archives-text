# NORRIS RAKESTRAW TELLS OF TRAVELS, EXPERIENCE ABROAD
## Attendance Not Compulsory For All Classes at Copenhagen U. 
### 
"It is hard to realize that in some
countries the sun is shining at mid
night," said Dr. Norris Rakestraw, of
the Chemistry department, who told
of his experiences in Scandinavia in
an illustrated lecture last night.
Dr. Rakestraw traveled a year and
a half in Europe, studying conditions
there. He showed slides of Denmark,
Sweden, and Norway, and pointed out
scenes of interest. Tivoli, in Copen
hagen, Denmark, is one of the largest
and best-known pleasure resorts in the
northern part of the continent.
The University of Copenhagen is
the university of Denmark. There is
no formality of compulsion of class
attendance. The library of the univer
sity is famous for its collection of
original manuscripts, many of them
containing old legends of the country.
Dr.. Rakestraw had an opportunity
to visit Elsinor, famous as the alleged
seat of the story of Hamlet. Hamlet's
grave and Ophelia's well are shown
tourists, even though they are not con
sidered authentic.
Legend of Elsinor
Another legend of Elsinor is that
there is an old man living in an under
ground dungeon, who typifies the spirit
of Denmark. He will some day lead
Denmark back to her former glory.
Although the old man is invisible, he
is represented by a carved marble
staute in the entrance of his dungeon.
Stockholm was the most important
place in Sweden described by the
speaker. "The beauty of the city lies
in its water front.," he said. "Most of
the important buildings in the city are
built along the front.
Institutions somewhat resembling
our fraternities were described. Each
student belongs automatically to a
group of men from the same geograph
ical section of the country from which
he comes.
One of the most noticeable features
of Norway, according to Dr. Rake
straw, was the prevalence of electric
lights, even in country districts.
