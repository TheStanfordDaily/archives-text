# A 						Revival

Skull and Snakes is making an interesting, and possibly profitable ex
periment in staging a return to the old Jolly-up institution on Registration
Day for next quarter. Jolly-ups in the old days were among the most
rousing functions hold on the campus, but for the past year they have not
been resurrected from the oblivion into which they fell during the Autumn
quarter of 1923.
The Daily for that quarter included some enthusiastic printed matter
both pro and con, and opinions on the success of the last Jolly-up to be
given divided themselves fairly evenly between these two classes. It was
held on one hand that the Jolly-up was largely attended by "freaks and
drunks," and that it was an opportunity for goofs to "walk on the feet of
people who would never in ordinary circumstances wish to dance with
them."
The opposition seemed to admit these charges in whole or in part, and
chiefly concerned itself with offering suggestions for the betterment of
affairs, advocating especially the breaking up of the one large party into
several smaller ones, each with its own orchestra and floor. Something of
the sort was tried out at the Oregon Agricultural College, where the
student body was divided alphabetically into eight groups. No reports on
the success or failure of this experiment have drifted in.
Ideally the Jolly-up is a splendid institution. It undoubtedly includes a
possibility of making happy acquaintances and is a levelling influence over
the campus as a whole. Of course, the acquaintances may not be as
"happy" to one party as to the other, and possibly the campus does not wish
to be levelled. If, however, those who wish to mingle only with a certain
restricted group will stay away, the members of the party should have a
good time attended with lasting benefit, in many cases.
Referring back to the "freaks and drunks," the remark was made that
"between these two classes of male dancers women who make the mistake
of attending Jolly-ups are handed back and forth with no consideration of
their own wishes." There, it seems, is the opportunity of Skull and Snakes
to strike at the root of the matter and to firmly establish the Jolly-up where
it belongs—as a typically democratic institution at democratic Stanford—
if Stanford is democratic.
The drunks, if any, can be firmly hurled out without much regard as
to which ear they land on. Public and offensive arm waving is no longer
indulged in by those who matter. The "freaks" are another matter. Just
what is a "freak," anyhow? And what percentage of them remain freaks
after one comes to know them?
Skull and Snakes, at any rate, deserves success in this re-trial of an old
custom. If both men and women can be given a good time without any of
the former annoyances, a lengthy step will be taken toward putting the
student body back on the old basis of unified friendliness. And, if the
fact follows the theory, it should be broadening and worth while to the
individual.

EDITORIAL STAFF* of the Daily will meet tomorrow as usual
