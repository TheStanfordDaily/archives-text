# KENEALY SEALS TO OPPOSE CARD BALL TOSSERS SATURDAY
## Teague Likely to Start on Mound Against Strong Sand Lot Outfit 
### 
The Kenealy Seals baseball team
will visit the campus next Saturday to
play the varsity nine on the Cardinal
diamond.
The varsity has dropped both of its
games this season to Ireland's collec
tion of pro-baseball stars. All of the
games have shown excellent working
of the outfield but the infield has
chalked up several errors.
Marty Griffin, pitching for Ireland,
has held the batting averages down
low, and only twelve hits were made
in the two games. Of these, "Chuck"
Johnston made four. In the last game,
when the varsity was blanked, they
had several opportunities to score but
were unable to drive out the necessary
hits at the opportune times.
Last year the varsity suffered the
same trouble. Throughout the entire
preliminary season the hitting was
done almost exclusively by 'Bus" Mc
•Candless and "Lefty" May. When the
California series rolled around they
got going and squeezed through, win
ning two of the three big games.
In the outfield there has been some
brilliant playing and no errors have
been chalked up so far.
Jerry Stewart of the 1927 freshman
team has been playing a stellar game
in left field. Last Saturday he was
easily the star of the game. He nailed
three long flies on the bare outskirts
of his territory and came in a long
ways once to stop what would have
been a Texas leaguer.
The infield has had a less brilliant
record. Five times in the last game
some one of these four players com
mitted an error that gave a runner an
extra base or a free trip across the
plate.
Jim Aydelotte has started both
games and each time has been re
placed after taking considerable bang
ing around the field. Tod Oviatt> has
been looking good in practice, and held
the visitors to a few scattered hits
after replacing Aydelotte last week. He
should start Saturday's game.
Kenealy Seals is made up of a pow
erful bunch of players collected from
various sand lots throughout this sec
tor and meets the varsity in only one
clash this season.
