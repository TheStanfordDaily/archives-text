ger, Execution Committee, et al.
As we approached one of Orfil Tuck
ered's offices, we were trembling at ;
the knee. Opening the door slowly, we
said to the great man, "Mr. Tuckered,
we have come to interview you for |
our 'Hobbies of the Great' column."
The industrious man looked up from
I
his work. "What's been keeping you?" [
he said.
Ignoring this rebuke, we drove
straight to the point, "What," we
asked, as boldly as possible, "just what j
is your hobby?"
"Horses," stated Tuckered emphati- j
cally. "Horses have always been my I
hobby, since earliest childhood. There .
is, I find, something about the hortse j
which can be found nowhere else. I
find, furthermore, that the horse helps j
me in my work. You know what I
mean; that it gives me some sort of
recreation and exercise."
"And what sort of horse do you pre
fer, Mr. Tuckered?" we inquired cour
teously.
"White horse!" Tuckered stated,
most emphatically. "I find that Mr.:
Charles disagrees with me on this, !
but then it takeg all sort of horsemen
to make—ah—to make "
"A regiment of calvalry," we inter- i
supted.
"Ah yes, a regiment of cavalry. That
was the simile I was trying to remem
ber," said Tuckered. "Put that down
as if I said it, will you please?"
"Oh, yes, Mr. Tuckered, we'll put it
down as you said it."
"Goodbye!" called Orfil. —IBID.

I—Have you had "Insects and Dis
