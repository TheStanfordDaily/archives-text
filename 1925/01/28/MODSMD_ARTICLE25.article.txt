Corinne- Griffith is good. The picture, I
on the other hand, is not so good. We say
this despite the fact that Mr. Cabbages ■
was with us, and he got all excited over :
the alligator part. He feared for Miss j
Griffith, but we knew better. Miss Grif
fith has survived numerous encounters |
with alligators and the like, and by this |
time is getting to be quite a hand at it.
This brings us to the«point. We have,
as have many others, seen Corinne Grif- ,
fith in a number of grown-up part's. In |
fact none of her pictures, so far as we I
remember, ever featured her as a child, j
Now, praise be, she is blossoming out as 1
a maiden of such meager years'that her ;
lover refuses to take her seriously. This j
might be all right if it were not for the
fact that it is the same Corinne Griffith. »
However, do not think, dear reader tliat '
any strain is to be placed upon your imag- j
ination. The entire situation is carefully
explained by subtitltes. One subtitle in
fact predicts the bursting of the jungle
storm, and sure enough, the jungle storm
bursts "in all it's fury."
