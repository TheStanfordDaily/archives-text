# "EAST OF SUEZ"—Varsity.
## 
### 
Before we begin to consider this
thing in a critical light, we have an
admission to make. This Pola Negri
gets us ALL EXCITED. You will no
doubt understand that this is purely a
personal reaction. It is herein set forth
simply that you may (if you feel so
inclined) take it into consideration in
regard to our critical estimate of Miss
Negri.
However, and we hope we are speak- I
infi in a sufficiently cold maner, Pola j
Negri is an actress. The recent bung- i
ling efforts of her directors in casting !
her repeatedly in totally imposible
stories has in no whit detracted from j
her appeal as an artist. She is good, j
oh very, very, good, and apparently j
nothing can make her horrid.
This story in "East of Suez" proves
that conclusively. If Miss Negri were
capable of looking bad, she would do j
so here. It is the popular Chinese tale j
ih which people are poisoned, stabbed,
and even shot in an appallingly pro- I
miscuous manner.
We do not know if you ever read
the classic efforts of Sax Rhomer or '
not. They were the delight of our own
early adolescence. Anyway, this plot j
would delight Rhomer's mysterious
heart. It is supposed to be horrifying.
It succeeds in being horrible.
The direction of Raoul Walsh helped
it some, and the assistance was grave- j
ly needed. Edmund Lowe, Rockliffe j
Fellowes and Noah Beery are all i
rather good in themselves.
One parting shot, dear reader. Our
vituperation has exceeded our inten
tions, and consequently you may have I
gained the idea that the picture is not
worth seeing. On the contrary, it is.
An hour and a half of Pola Negri is
worth thirty cents of anybody's
money. —S. F. O'D.
