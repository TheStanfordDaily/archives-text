| "Dashing, black-haired Valentinos, sing
ing to the tune of a Spanish guitar, and
; whispering to their dark-eyed lady loves
through latticed windows, exist in fiction,
i not in Spain today," said Professor Ed-
J ward Maslin Hulme of the History de
partment in a talk 011 "Spain and the
! Spaniards," which he gave last night at
; an open meeting of the Euphronia Debat
ing Society.
"As a whole, though the Spanish are
picturesque and fascinating, they are not,
as a class, highly romantic, nor idealistic.
They are not hot recklessness itself, but
J cold prudence. They are open-eyed real-
I ists, and though ardent, they are self
i controlled.
"Spanish painting of today, portraiture,
shows that the Spanish people are realistic.
This fact is further borne out by the fact
: that the favorite theatrical entertainment
i in Spain today is the Zarzuela, a realistic
I one-act play concerned with the lower
' strata of society."
Professor Hulme found one character
istic common in all Spaniards. "The
Spaniard is proud, and when this becomes
j coupled with disillusionment about life,
the result is a lofty resignation."
I In the course of the evening various
other labels were pasted on the Spanish.
"They are temperate, much more so than
the northern peoples. The Spaniard is
conservative and lives with happy ease.
Above all Spain is a land of natural in
telligence, but the people are interested in
concrete things not in ideas."
" 'Will Spain revive-' is a question that
disturbs many of the visitors in Spain,
j but one that does not disturb the Span
iards," said Professor Hulme. "The
Spaniard instinctively feels that Spain has
a high destiny before her. Nor are they
taking a passive attitude. The Spanish
are harnessing their water power, and util
izing their resources. Progress is making
its way."
