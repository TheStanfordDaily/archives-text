Mr. John Levi is going to take a shot at big time baseball. John comes from
the Araphone tribe, not being descended from a son of Jacob in the land of
Israel, as his name might indicate. Will John Levi make good, as Chief Meyers
and Chief Bender did, or will he bite the dust like those others of his race,
Jim Thorpe and Yellowhorse, who tried to become Major League stars and
failed?
The signing of John Levi, like the signing of the Declaration of Independence,
was bound to start a lot of arguments. Does the management think that the
turnstiles at the Yankee Stadium will click all the faster next spring because a
famous one hundred per cent American is cavorting around within the en
closure, or is Huggins really looking for some one to take the place of Meusel
or Witt?
Anybody that can throw a football 90 yards, as John is reported to have
done, can certainly peg a baseball from the outfield to the home plate, and
Levi may turn out to be a first-class ball player. He has been playing
America's national pastime longer than he has been playing football, but it is
in the latter game that he has won his fame.
Like Jim Thorpe, Levi is also an all-around track and field star. His entrance,
into big league baseball will be watched with interest, and may forever settle
the oft-raised question, "Do Football and Baseball mix?"
