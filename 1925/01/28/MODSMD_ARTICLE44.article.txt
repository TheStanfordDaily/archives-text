# LIGHTWEIGHT TEAMS TO BATTLE FRIDAY
## 
### 
Lightweight basketball will furnish
fans the chief attraction Friday night
when the two Stanford midget teams
are scheduled to appear jointly against
a couple of fast quintets which give
promise of making the going interest
ing. The 145's will take on the U. C.
Dental College live and the 130's will
oppose the West Side Union High
School lightweights.
Coach Davis will have his hands
full with botli of his teams playing
the same evening. The 145-pound
game will be the feature event. The
Stanford five has won all of its games
so far, but in the U. C. Dentist squad
it will probably meet the toughest
competition that it has encountered
to date.
The Stanford 145's showed flashes
of class in their game last week and
should they come through Friday in
good style the team would be off to
a good start toward the California
games a few weeks later.
The 130-pound team has met disas
ter in their two games. Coach Davis
has been drilling them hard lately and
should they get over the hump Friday
night, perhaps, the going would be
smoother from then on.
