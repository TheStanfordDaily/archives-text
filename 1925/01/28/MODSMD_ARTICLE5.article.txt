# MAIER, PATTISON BLEND ART IN RECITAL TOMORROW
## Music Association Sponsors Two-Piano Recital in Assembly Hall 
### Katherine Capell 
One of the most unique pianistic
entertainments before the public will
be offered the campus tomorrow eve
ning when Guy Maier and Lee Pattison
appear at the Assembly hall at 8:15 in
a two-piano concert.
Although each artffct is a musician
of distinct individuality and tempera
ment, Maier and Pattison have merged
their art and personalities to such a
degree that they are known as the
"pianistic twins," and according to
critics their only limitation lies in the
short range of four-hand literature.
It has been said that Maier and Pat
tison play so gaily that the perfection
of their technique is less conspicuous
than the intangible spirit of their
playing. It is imposible to tell which
is playing, so extraordinarily do they
blend their individualities. They are
precise and vivacious, and they play
with equal facility everything from
Bax to Mozart.
Tomorow's program includes music
by many of the old masters, several
selections of younger composers of
recognized standing, as De√üussy and
Clementi, and a number of composi
tions of a lighter vein. Pattison him
self has made an arrangement for two
pianos of "Arkansaw Traveler," from
an old fiddler's tune.
Maier and Pattison made their first
appearance in California under the
management of Selby Oppenheimer,
who is conducting their present tour.
They gave a program, at the New
Columbia Theatre in San Francisco
last Sunday, and are planning on other
concerts in the city, where they have
been well received by western patrons
of music.
Tickets for the concert are still on
sale at Crandall's, in Palo Alto.
