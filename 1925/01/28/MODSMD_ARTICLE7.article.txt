# "YOU AND I" DRESS REHEARSAL TONIGHT
## Virginia Graves Will Have Lead; Marjorie Allen Ingenue Star 
### Douglas Meservey 
Dress rehearsal for "You and I" will
be held tonight, one day earlier than
usual on account of the concert which
will be given in the Assembly hall to
morrow night.
The cast of "You and I" is fast

nearing a perfection that is seldom
attained in campus dramatics, both
for the reason that the characters are
being taken by experienced actors or
actresses, and for the fact that a
longer period of preparation than usual
has been possible. Gordon Davis chose
the cast before the end of last quar
ter, giving everyone a chance to
familiarize themselves with the parts.
Virginia Graves, in the role of Nancy
(Vhite, has the main feminine lead of

ihe play, while Marjorle Allen has the
ingenue lead.
The role of Nancy White affords!
Virginia Graves the opportunity of por
traying a remarkable character: a,
mother who is the pal of her son, with
a heart that makes her do anything

that will tend to make him more
happy. Understanding, sympathetic,
resourceful, the part of Nancy White
is one of the best in "You and I."
There are still a few good seats
available at the office of the Alumni
Secretary in the Administration build
ing, and the box-office outside the As
sembly hall will be open at 7 p.m. on
Friday night. There will also be the
usual cast dance in the Women's Club
house immediately following the play.
