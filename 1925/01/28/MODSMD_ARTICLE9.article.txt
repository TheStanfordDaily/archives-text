# UNAUTHORIZED AD SCHEMES BANNED BY EX COMMITTEE
## 
### 
Regulation of advertising mediums
other than authorized campus publica
tions was placed in the hands of the
Executive Committee, the Student
Manager, and the Men's Council by a
resolution passed by the Executive
Committee last night.
Numerous free lance advertising
schemes have appeared on the cam
pus the last few years and, according
to Rene Rothschild, business manager
of the Daily Palo Alto, the non-fulfill
ment of the agreements on the part
of the people backing some of these
schemes has noticeably affected the
Daily and other authorized publica
tions.
The resolution provides that all per
sons planning a venture of this nature
first receive the sanction of the Execu
tive Committee and then deposit a
certain proportion of their gross re
ceipts with the student organization
fund. Half of this bond will be kept
permanently and the other half will
be returned when the promoter proves
that ho has lived up to his various
agreements.
Upon the recommendation of C. W.
