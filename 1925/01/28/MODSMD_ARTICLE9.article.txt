# UNAUTHORIZED AD SCHEMES BANNED BY EX COMMITTEE
## 
### 
Regulation of advertising mediums
other than authorized campus publica
tions was placed in the hands of the
Executive Committee, the Student
Manager, and the Men's Council by a
resolution passed by the Executive
Committee last night.
Numerous free lance advertising
schemes have appeared on the cam
pus the last few years and, according
to Rene Rothschild, business manager
of the Daily Palo Alto, the non-fulfill
ment of the agreements on the part
of the people backing some of these
schemes has noticeably affected the
Daily and other authorized publica
tions.
The resolution provides that all per
sons planning a venture of this nature
first receive the sanction of the Execu
tive Committee and then deposit a
certain proportion of their gross re
ceipts with the student organization
fund. Half of this bond will be kept
permanently and the other half will
be returned when the promoter proves
that ho has lived up to his various
agreements.
Upon the recommendation of C. W.
Davis, director of intramural athletics,
eight sophomores were granted inter
class basketball awards for winning
the interclass championship. The men
to receive numerals are: Price, South
worth, Riese, Anderson, Jayred, Ana
wait, Rowles, and McCormick.
Skull and Snakes was granted the
registration date for a jolly-up next
quarter.
The resolution in full regarding free
lance advertising schemes is as fol
lows:
To the Executive Committee of The
Associated Students.

financial profit; and
2. WHEREAS in most cases that
have come to the attention of the
undersigned, the solicitor makes cer
tain promises to those from whom he
solicits which he generally intends to
neglect and in fact does neglect to
carry out, which practice results in
the loss of faith in everything con
nected with Stanford advertising and
is particularly harmful to all bonafide
publications,
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED,
that the Executive Committee in regu
lar session on this, the 27th day of
January, 1925, hereby does adopt the
following plan for the protection of

under its general control and financial

scheme is carried out, provided fur
ther
2. That the advertising scheme has
been submitted to the General Man
ager for his recommendation before

supervising of this plan and the other
five per cent (5%) shall be returned to
the promoter when it has been shown
conclusively to the General Manager
that he has carried out the terms of
his contracts.
4. Failure to comply with tsese pro

light so that the approval of the Execu
tive Committee shall be automatically
withdrawn and the promoter shail be
reported to the Men's Council for pun
ishment.

We, the undersigned, managers of
the student publications indicated be
low, hereby do petition you, the Execu
tive Committee to pass the following:
1. WHEREAS certain advertising
matter such as blotters, telephone di
rectories, bulletins, notebook dividers,
etc., has been appearing on the Stan
ford campus, solicited by men from
among our student body for personal
financial profit; and
2. WHEREAS in most cases that
have come to the attention of the
undersigned, the solicitor makes cer
tain promises to those from whom he
solicits which he generally intends to
neglect and in fact does neglect to
carry out, which practice results in
the loss of faith in everything con
nected with Stanford advertising and
is particularly harmful to all bonafide
publications,
THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED,
that the Executive Committee in regu
lar session on this, the 27th day of
January, 1925, hereby does adopt the
following plan for the protection of
such publications as are operated
under its general control and financial
supervision, and the stopping of the
capitalizing of Stanford's good name
with the aforementioned unfulfilled
promises:
1. That every projected advertising
scheme put forth on the Stanford cam
pus by which the individual will per
sonally profit, either directly or in
directly and for which such person
intends to solicit advertising shall re
ceive the sanction of the Executive
Committee before the advertising
scheme is carried out, provided fur
ther
2. That the advertising scheme has
been submitted to the General Man
ager for his recommendation before
the Executive Committee takes final
action thereon together with a copy of
the blank form of contract which is
to be used, a full and complete state
ment of the nature of the enterprise,
the method of distribution, the cost of
advertising and any other facts that
the General Manager shall deem to be
pertinent.
3. If the scheme receives the ap
proval of the Executive Committee,
there shall be deposited within one (1)
week after date of approval in the
account of the Associated Students an
amount to be not less than ten per
cent (10%) of the computed gross re
ceipts; five per cent (5%) of which
shall be retained in a fund for the
supervising of this plan and the other
five per cent (5%) shall be returned to
the promoter when it has been shown
conclusively to the General Manager
that he has carried out the terms of
his contracts.
4. Failure to comply with tsese pro
visions shall be construed in such a
light so that the approval of the Execu
tive Committee shall be automatically
withdrawn and the promoter shail be
reported to the Men's Council for pun
ishment.
5. Ignorance of these rules does ont
provide an excuse for failure to com
ply with these rules.
