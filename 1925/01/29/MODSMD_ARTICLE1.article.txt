# DORMITORY RESIDENTS WILL BE REQUIRED TO EAT IN DINING HALLS
## ACCESSORIES ADEQUATE New Plan to Go Into Effect at Beginning of Fall Quarter 
### 
Beginning next fall all men living in
"University dormitories will eat in the
dining halls collected with those dor
mitories, Comptroller A. E. Roth told
the men of Branner hall last night.
According to President Wilbur the idea
is not a new one but is merely the putting
into effect of a policy that' the university
lias had for many years. Dr. Wilbur
says, "We have waited patiently for stu
dents to take advantage of the facilities
offered them, but their failure to do so,
and the fact that' the accommodations are
now adequate to take care of all men liv
ing in the dormitories has made univer
sity action imperative."
Roth Speaks at Branner.
Comptroller Roth spoke at the meeting
of Branner Club last night and pointed
out that the eating hall at Branner was
being run at a loss because of the small
number of men that were taking advant
age of the accommodations. According
to him there will be no way to improve
existing conditions until a sufficient num
ber of men eat there.
The three eating clubs that now occupy
their own buildings will be forced to
abandon these and move to locations that
will be provided by the University. Defi
nite plans as to where they will be moved
liave not been formulated. Whether or
not Sequoia will be permitted to run its
own dining hall, as it has in the past, is
as yet undecided. The clubs that will be
moved are El Toro, El Campo, and
Breakers.
