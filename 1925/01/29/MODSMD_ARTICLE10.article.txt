# Construction of "You and I" Plot Insures Story Interest
## 
### Douglas Meservey 
There will be no lessening at any
time of the audience's interest when
the Harvard prize play, "You and I,"
is presented tomorrow night. This is
guaranteed by the unusual construc
tion that Philip Barry gave to his crea
tion and by one of the best casts that
Gordon Davis has ever presented to
the campus.
It expresses love through the lines
of the enthusiastic son, Leonard
Schwartz; the father, Alan Robertson,
undecided as to the best future for
his boy; of the mother, Virginia
Graves, who sympathizes with her
son's ambitions but respects his fath

sweetheart, Marjorie Allen.
Philosophical, Comical
"You and I" is decidedly not a one
idea play. One is struck at first by
the sincerity of the philosophic lines,
then amused by the efforts of Velma
Randall as the aspiring maid, and
finally impressed by the way Charles
Parks breezes in and out. Philosophy,
drama, and comedy intermingle in a
way that leaves the audience with the
impression that it has seen a master

Some Plays depend upon situations
for effectiveness and "Captain Apple

Then again, a burlesque of custom or
of modern tendencies, such as "The
Torclibearers," provokes laughter

But a play that combines clever lines
with dramatic situations, humorous
lines with touches of philosophy, and
combines all in producing an effect of
homeliness and naturalfiess, is the su
preme production. That is "You and I,"
a play that is a combination of the
Appeal Strong
best qualities of all types.
But a fine play is not "put over" to
the audience on its merits alone. Upon
the cast of "You and I" will depend
the success of its appeal ayd from the
dress rehearsal last night, we should
judge that there will be no failure in
that direction tomorrow night. It has
been said that a poor dress rehearsal
forecasts a successful "first night"
and vice versa, but the ability alone
of Davis' splendid cast should over
come the poor appearance apparently
forecasted for tomorrow night.
Virginia Graves in the leading role
of mother and wife with its sympathy
and understanding, has a difficult part
to portray but skillfully upholds it-
She has a fine resonant voice that is
