# Construction of "You and I" Plot Insures Story Interest
## 
### Douglas Meservey 
There will be no lessening at any
time of the audience's interest when
the Harvard prize play, "You and I,"
is presented tomorrow night. This is
guaranteed by the unusual construc
tion that Philip Barry gave to his crea
tion and by one of the best casts that
Gordon Davis has ever presented to
the campus.
It expresses love through the lines
of the enthusiastic son, Leonard
Schwartz; the father, Alan Robertson,
undecided as to the best future for
his boy; of the mother, Virginia
Graves, who sympathizes with her
son's ambitions but respects his fath
er's wisdom; and of the charming
sweetheart, Marjorie Allen.
Philosophical, Comical
"You and I" is decidedly not a one
idea play. One is struck at first by
the sincerity of the philosophic lines,
then amused by the efforts of Velma
Randall as the aspiring maid, and
finally impressed by the way Charles
Parks breezes in and out. Philosophy,
drama, and comedy intermingle in a
way that leaves the audience with the
impression that it has seen a master
piece of dramatic construction.
Some Plays depend upon situations
for effectiveness and "Captain Apple

jack" might be said to be of this type.
Then again, a burlesque of custom or
of modern tendencies, such as "The
Torclibearers," provokes laughter
through its so-apparent burlesque.
But a play that combines clever lines
with dramatic situations, humorous
lines with touches of philosophy, and
combines all in producing an effect of
homeliness and naturalfiess, is the su
preme production. That is "You and I,"
a play that is a combination of the
Appeal Strong
best qualities of all types.
But a fine play is not "put over" to
the audience on its merits alone. Upon
the cast of "You and I" will depend
the success of its appeal ayd from the
dress rehearsal last night, we should
judge that there will be no failure in
that direction tomorrow night. It has
been said that a poor dress rehearsal
forecasts a successful "first night"
and vice versa, but the ability alone
of Davis' splendid cast should over
come the poor appearance apparently
forecasted for tomorrow night.
Virginia Graves in the leading role
of mother and wife with its sympathy
and understanding, has a difficult part
to portray but skillfully upholds it-
She has a fine resonant voice that is
peculiarly adapted to the mother who
is still young and has not forgotten
youthful loves.
Opposite her is Alan Robertson. Una
might almost say that his love of his
wife and his ambition stifled for her
comfort were the high-lights of the
play, so well portrayed are they, yet
they are only part of '.ha dramatic
incidents.
The love of Leonard' Schwartz, the
son, for Marjorie Allen, tne sweet
heart, is the most refreshing and in
spiring "Jove theme" seen on the Stan
ford stage for a long while. Both bi ing
into their parts a strong, youthful in
terpretation that finely balances the
more sorrowful love of the parents.
Parks Continental
Charles Parks will never be forgot
ten for his splendid work in "Mile
stones" as the English friend of the
family and it is his ability to appear
"continental" that makes a like part
in "You and I" so strong. At times he
is humorous and again, sad â€”wishing
that he, like his friend, Maitland White
(Alan Robertson), was married and
settled down instead of a globe-trotter
calling the world his home.
Velma Randall, as the maid, absorbs
nearly a whole act of "You and I",
with her humorous attempts to imi
tate Mrs. White (Virginia Graves), her
mistress. Conversation, manners, and
dress are all subjected to a trial and
her mannerisms while "playing lady"
are extremely comical.
Lowell Mathay makes his initial bow
in dramatics as a typical hard-headed
business man and captain of industry
and does vej-y well in spite of inexperi
ence. Making a close friendship with
Richey (Leonard Schwartz), he in
duces him to enter his soap factory
when the latter is for a time disap
pointed in his efforts to reconcile art
and love.
The usual cast dance will be held
in the Women's Clubhouse following
the play. Couples are to be admitted
for 75 cents for two hours of dancing
from 11 to 1 o'clock.
