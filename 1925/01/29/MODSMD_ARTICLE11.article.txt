# CAMPOS NOSE OUT ALPHA DELTS 10-9 IN LAST MINUTES
## A. K. L.'s Defeat Encina 3W; Cuadro 15, Capitan 8; S. A. E. 19, Tigre 2 
### 
El Campo furnished the sensation of
yesterday's intramural program by com
ing from behind in the last minute of play
to nose out the strong Alpha Delta Phi
quintet 10 to 9. The Alpha Delts showed
better teamwork, but failed to make good
on a majority of their shots.
The results of the other games are:
Alpha Kappa Lambda 22, Encina 3W 11;
El Cuadro 15, El Capitan 8; Branner
First 18, Theta Delta Chi 2; Sigma Alpho
Epsilon 19, El Tigre 2.
Alpha Delta Phi and El Campo put on
a tilt that uncovered some fast, brainy
basketball in spots, but was rather medi
ocre for the most part. The Alpha Delts
went like a house afire during the first
half, and at the start of the second period
seemed to have the game on ice by virtue
of their Bto 1 lead. So they shoved in a
few of their shock troops and gave El
Campo a chance to break through.
The club men proceeded to break
through so efficiently that the Alpha Delts
scored only one point, when Neer sunk a
free throw, during the remainder of the
game. Schoen, Siemons, and Bigelow led
El Campo's rally. Schoen dropped in the
winning basket forty-five seconds before
the final whistle blew.
A. K. L. Downs Encina 3W.
Shooting baskets from the center of the
court' with uncanny accuracy, Alpha
Kappa Lambda defeated Encina 3W by a
22 to 11 score without much trouble. The
victory practically cinched the title in
League 3 for A. K. L. Although they
failed to exhibit much teamwork on the
offense, the Greeks went fairly well on the
defense. Cornell and Barnett, forwards,
tallied on a high percentage of their shots,
the former accounting for fifteen points.
The freshmen were evidently caught on
an off day, as they failed to put up the
fight they have shown in previous games,
and they could not shoot basket's with any
degree of consistency; although they had
an abundance of opportunities. A. K. L.
