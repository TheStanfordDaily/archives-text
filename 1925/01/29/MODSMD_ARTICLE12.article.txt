# ATHLETIC CARNIVAL IS SCHEDULED FOR MINOR SPORT MEN
## Boxers, Wrestlers, Fencers to Have Championship Tournaments 
### 
Novice athletes will show their wares at
the annual Indoor Athletic Circus for the
University Novice Championships, to be
run off by Harry Maloney February 12 in
the Encina gym.
Three tournaments will be held at the
same time in a "Three-ring Circus" for
boxers, fencers, and wrestlers. Competi
tion is open to all men, including fresh
men, registered in the University who
have not represented Stanford, and who
have not won a university championship
in the sport in which they wish to com
pete. Competitors are asked entry lists
for the three events posted on the bulletin
board in the gym.
Gold Medals to Victors.
The Department of Physical Education
is donating gold medals to be awarded to
the winners in each class. Harry Ma
loney expects to get a line on any men
who show signs of being promising candi
dates for the minor sports teams.
Boxing will be run off in the following
divisions: featherweight, 125 lbs.; light
weight, 135 lbs.; welterweight, 145 lbs.;
middleweight, 158 lbs.; light heavyweight',
168 lbs.; and heavyweight. Three pounds
over weight will be allowed in each class.
Bouts will be three rounds of a minute
and a half each.
Wrestling will be run off with the same
weights as the boxing, except that the
light heavyweight class will be omitted.
In fencing Harry Maloney has made
two classes, the novice senior and the
novice junior. This will allow men who
liave not handled the foils before this
year to participate on an even basis. It
is expected that a large number will be on
hand to show their swordsmanship, as
Harry Maloney has fifty-two men work
ing out under him.
Student body cards will admit members
of the University to the circus. All others
will be required to pay a fee of fifty cents,
the proceeds going toward paying for the
medals.
