# HOBBIES OF THE FACULTY
## PRESIDENT WILBUR 
### Hulda Hoover 
President Wilbur considers that the
thing he does best in the world is to
make venison broth. He likes food
cooked in the open, especially when
he himself is chef. Aside from this, his
hobbies are birds, dogs, bucks, trout,
high mountains, and football. He goes
camping every time he has the chance.
At the end of his freshman year in
the University, Wilbur and some class
mates went on a thrtÂ»e-months camp
ing trip in Arizona fo collect speci
mens for the zoological museum which
Timothy Hopkins was assisting in hav
ing collected. Arizona was a much
rougher country then than it is now,
and as a consequence they bad some
interesting experiences.

They spent most of their time camp
ing in the Hauehucha mountains which
are on the Mexican frontier. It was a
very rich collecting field because it is
far enough south to have many of the
Mexican and Central American birds,
and the party got some prize speci
mens. For the three months that they
were down in Arizona they killed an
average of five rattlesnakes a day in
addition to numerous scorpions, centi
pedes, tarantulas, and gila monsters.
The road which the collecting party
took on their way to one of the camps
at Fort Lowell, near Tucson, now
passes through the campus of the Uni
versity of Arizona.
President Wilbur says that his pet
aversions are Pullman cars and after
dinner speeches.
