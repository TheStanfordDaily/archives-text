"There are only three cities in the
United States in which newspapers
present both sides of the League of
Nations problem," said Hamilton Holt,
the internationally known advocate of
the League, in an interview yesterday.
He enumerated St. Louis, New York,
and Philadelphia. "The others," he
said, either print one version only, or
say nothing at all.
"A great many of the newspapers in
the United States are owned by men
who have secured their capital through
conservatism. Consequently," explained
Holt, "when confronted with a prob
lem which does not directly affect
themselves, they take a decidedly con
servative attitude.
"Until journalism is freed from the
influence of self-centered capitalists,
who want to keep all of America's
money in the United States, it is
doubtful whether the public will re
ceive from newspapers any sort of a
fair conception of the League of Na
tions," Holt predicted.
He said that the United States is the
wealthiest country in the world, and
that is money has been made largely
by men who could not have succeeded
had they not been extremely conserva
tive and itnent upon personal gain
alone. "These men who because they
have the money are all-powerful, have
secured this power since they were
capable of forgetting everything but
themselves," he said.
"To expect them to change in a
flash and become interested in setting
the world right is scarcely to be ex
pected," was his comment on these
newspaper owners.
