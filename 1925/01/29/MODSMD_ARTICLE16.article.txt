# FRESHMEN SET FOR WATER POLO GAME WITH OLYMPIC BOYS
## 
### Fred Speers 
Members of the freshman water polo
squad which will meet Hie Olympic
Club Juniors tomorrow night, not Sat
urday, as was anounced yesterday,
were given a stiff workout last night
by Coach Brandsten.
No regular line-up was used, varsity
and freshmen playing side by side. The
main purpose of last night's practice
was to get the men in shape for the
grind Friday evening at the Olympic
Club pool in San Francisco.
Nine freshmen will make the trip
and several varsity members will be
there also to compete in the P. A. A.
junior meet. The babe squad is play
ing a return game with the Olympic
Club Junior outfit, having dropped the
first clash 7 to 5 early in December.
Trip Not Certain
While the proposed trip south has
I not yet been cinched definitely, there
is every reason to believe that the plan
j will be carried out. A squad of water
! polo players would be taken down to
! compete in the national junior water
I polo championship tourney and to play
teams from several athletic clubs.
Four of the main varsity aces, liav
, ing won the junior championship be-
I fore, would be ineligible to compete.
These would bo Carsen, McCalllster,
Meyers, and Collett. However, they
would in all probability make the trip
also because of their value in certain
i tentative exhibition games being lined
| up.
One of Ernie Brandsten's main rea
sons for having such a full schedule
us he has outlined at present is his
j desire to stir up interest in water polo.
