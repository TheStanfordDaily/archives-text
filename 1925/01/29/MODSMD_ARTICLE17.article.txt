# AGGIES FALL BEFORE CARD QUINTET 31-7 IN RAGGED, COMICAL GAME
## PRICE HIGH POINT MAN Bossford, Davis Farm Guard, Plays Best' Game for Visiting Team 
### 
Stanford struggled through a rag
ged comical politest with the Davis
Farm Aggies in the pavilion last night,
the Card varsity winning 31 to 7.
The first half ended 12 to 4 in favor
of Stanford. The Cards were slow in
getting started, but once started the
team shot baskets with repeated regu
larity, working passing formations to
advantage over the weak defense of
the Aggies.
Fred Price, forward, starred for the
Stanford team, totalling ten of the
winning points. The best work on the
Aggie side was done by Bossford at
standing guard, who managed, practi
cally unaided, to snatch several balls
in the process of becoming goals, from
the backboard.
Andy Kerr substituted frequently,
putting in a "scrub" team in the last
few minutes to give the Aggies a little
added work and condolement —which
they failed to appreciate or take ad
vantage of.
Once Stanford got the lead there
was no attempt made on th#* part of
the Cards to concentrate solely on
points. It was a good workout in plays
and passing, which led subsequently to
a large score.
Ernie Nevers had his biggest night
on the court this season, scoring six
of the Stanford points and playing a
cool, heady game on the floor.
The biggest game of the week will
be played against the Olympic Club
Saturday night. The Winged "O" ag
gregation brings the usual strong ag
gregation—reported to be faster than
ever this season.
