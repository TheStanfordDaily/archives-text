# TOYON FORMAL DANCE SET FOR FEBRUARY 20
## 
### 
The annual Toyon formal given by resi
dents of Toyon Hall, will be held the
evening of February 20. Tentative plans
for this social function have been made by
the dance committee headed by Henry
Martin as chairman.
Decorations will be worked out in a
"Spanish" fashion, according to Martin,
and the lighting effects, programs, and
other details will all be arranged so as to
carry out this idea. Color-lighting
schemes using yellow, red, orange, and
black, will be employed. Refreshments
will be served in the Encina dining halls.
Art Weiner's Fairmont orchestra has been
engaged for the evening.
