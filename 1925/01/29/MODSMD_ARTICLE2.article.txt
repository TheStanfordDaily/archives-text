# ALL-BLACKS RUGBY TEAM MAY APPEAR HERE FEBRUARY 23
## 
### 
Efforts are being made by Harry Ma
loney to arrange an exhibition rugby
match between the New Zealand All-
Blacks and a team made up of men who
represented America on the Olympic
champion rugby team supplemented by
Stanford players, on Monday, February
23.
Harry Maloney, who is president of the
California Rugby Association, has been in
communication with Colonel Bell-Irving
of the Vancouver Rugby Union, who is in
charge of the All-Blacks' appcarance in
the West.
ThÂ£ All-Blacks arc now en route from
Europe on the last lap of their world
tour. In thirty-two matches against the
best teams of England, Ireland, Scotland,
Wales, and France, they were not de
feated. In Canada they are scheduld to
play two matches at Victoria and Van
couver, B. C. They sail for New Zealand
from San Francisco February 25.
Much depends on the showing of the
California team in the game with the All-
Blacks, as the result will probably be a
deciding factor as to whether a team will
be invited to tour Australia and New
Zealand during the coming summer. A
good fight should be made against the
All-Blacks, as the California squad won
two out of three games played in a series
in Vancouver during the Christmas vaca
tion.
