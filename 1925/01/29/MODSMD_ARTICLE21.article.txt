# Blotters

Judging from the figures which issue periodically from the Appoint
ment office, a high percentage of Stanford men find it necessary to earn at
least a portion of their college expenses. Figures from the same source
also indicate the ingenuity with which some of these expenses are earned.
One of the most enterprising of the means of self-support has been
definitely limited by the Executive Committee with the resolution to
restrict free-lance advertising.
At first glance, this would seem a step in the wrong direction. It ap
pears to make hard work a little harder for those who have to get out and
dig. If a student wants to get out and make some money, why should the
Executive Committee step in to stop him ? Aren't the student publication
managers using their influence to make their own positions more secure?
However, further analysis of the resolution shows that it merely serves
to put free-lance advertising on a basis of competition more fair to the
student publications. It is aimed at that type of advertising secured on
"unfulfilled promises" and on the "capitalizing of Stanford's good name."
The Daily, Chaparral and Quad managers have endeavored to sell
their advertising space on a business basis; as a commodity with a tangible
value. This endeavor suffers when the free-lancer solicits ads on the basis
of that ancient plea—"l'm working my way through college."
These publications suffer again when their competitors manage to col
lect profit on half-fulfilled promises. The merchant usually allots a certain
portion of his advertising budget to campus advertising. If he sees fit to
patronize a door-to-door distribution of blotters, rulers, or what-not, and
these blotters are not all distributed, campus advertising as a whole suffers
because of the unprofitable experience.
The Executive Committee has rectified the situation, and hereafter the
student advertising venture must first be sanctioned, a bond put up to
guarantee contracts with merchants, and a fee collected for supervision by
the student manager. This puts the free-lancers on an equal basis with
the publications. If they successfully compete on this basis, the business
managers will have no valid reason for complaint.
If they fail, the bookstore will sell some blotters. —R. L. S.
"DINK" TEMPLETON denies the Daily's report that he and Andy
Kerr bit the dust in a golf match with Harry Wolter and Jesse Whitehead.
Accordingly the. paper serves notice that in future coaching-staff golf
matches the party who first interviews a Daily reporter wins the glory if
not the match.
