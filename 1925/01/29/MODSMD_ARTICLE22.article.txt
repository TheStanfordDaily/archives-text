Editor, The Daily Palo Alto,
Campus.
Dear Sir:
Having been actively engaged with Stanford athletics for some seventeen
years I feel that I should be somewhat familiar with the strides made in
intercollegiate athletics, both major and minor and, of the last three years,
intramural. I well remember Stanford's seven straight victories in track and
five straight and two ties in Rugby football. As to the many straight victories
in crew, both varsity and freshman, I am, due primarily to not having majored
in mathematics, unable to tally. These victories were all in major sports and
took place roughly between 1909 and the year 1919. The success in minor
sports during this same period was equally remarkable.
We have opposed California in soccer football on thirty occasions and
Stanford has lost but seven matches, having won eighteen and tied five. In
swimming we have been returned the winner both in varsity and freshman
teams for the last eight years. What applies to swimming is just as true for
water polo, only over a shorter period as water polo did not become an
intercollegiate sport until 1918, since which Stanford has won all the varsity
matches with California and lost but one freshman match. In intercollegiate
boxing between the years 1915 and 1922 Stanford won four and broke even in
two matches and up to two years ago when this sport was temporarily dis
continued as an intercollegiate sport, that is as far as competition with
California is concerned, Stanford had thus won the majority of the matches.
In fencing the result has been the same. The last four years" have been
victories for Stanford teams.
The reason for these statistics are two-fold. First, to point out the success
that Stanford teams have had in intercollegiate minor sports over a long
period of years and, second, to try and prove that success with our minor
sports has not in any way been dependent upon the success of our major
sport teams as was stated in the viewpoint column of the Daily Palo Alto the
other evening. Success as far as major athletics are concerned in most
institutions runs in cycles. (Such does not seem to have been the case, at least
as far as Stanford is concerned, in minor athletics, as our long string of
unbroken successes will show.
From 1919 and until last year our victories in major athletics can be very
readily totalled even by one who is not a math, major:
The unusual interest that is being shown in intramural sports this year,
especially in backetball, lias not in the writer's opinion had much, if any,
bearing upon what our major sport teams may have done. There are reasons,
of course, but not as already stated, as such may relate to major athletics. It
is the opinion of the writer that the unusual interest that is being taken in
all branches of athletics here at Stanford is due primarily to the following
couses:
1. Compulsory Physical Training for all Lower Division students.
2. One unit of credit for all upperclassmen.
3. One, if not the best, equipped gymnasium plants in the country.
4. More outside playing facilities, fields, etc., than any other university
in America.
5. A competent coaching staff to cover almost every branch of indoor
and outdoor sport.
6. The encouragement given by those having charge of Physical Education
to general participation in athletics.
7. The natural desire of the bulk of our students to keep physically as
well as mentally fit and to be not only "of the game but in the game."
In summing up would say that with an athletic policy, relative to general
participation such as that fostered by the Department of Physical Education
coupled with the Board of Athletic Control, will continue to mean much
towards keeping the ranks of our major sport teams well filled.
Were we to look over the list of students taking part in major athletics,
not only the teams of the present but of the past also, and the same under
the present athletic policy will be true of future teams, we would begin to
realize that both minor sports and intramural athletic activities have and will
continue to assist in the development, together with contributing a good quota
of athletic material to our varsity teams, which will carry "Stanford's Athletic
Banner" to success in intercollegiate, national and international athletic com
petition. Sincerely yours, HAItRY W. MALONEY.
