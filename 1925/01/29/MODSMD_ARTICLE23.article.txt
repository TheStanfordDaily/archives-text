# TRACK PROSPECTS DIMMED BY LOSS OF VETERAN RUNNERS
## New Men Must Take Up Jobs Left by Old Varsity Cinderpath Men 
### 
Practically the entire Stanford var
sity track team has been chosen and
is working out at present under the
direction of Coach "Dink" Templeton. |
Despite the loss of ten letter men
the Cards are thought to possess ma
terial from which to build up anew a
squad which will be in every way as
strong as last season's.
Captain Van judah (440), Mixon
(440), Elliott (mile), Mcintosh (880),
Scofield (pole vault), Denis (pole
vault), and Anderson (high jump),
graduated last year. Hale (100-yard
dash), Boles (hurdles), and Storie 1
(440), will be unable to compete.
These men accounted for 28y 2 points I
in the California meet, Stanford win
ning 83 to 48. California has experi
enced no such disastrous slash in its |
track squad, and has an advantage
over the Cardinals in the matter of
veteran material.
In losing Hale, Storie, and Boles,
"Dink" Templeton was left without
three probable first place men. Hale
won the hundred last year and placed
second in the two-twenty. At present
he is working out with the Olympic
track squad and is a valuable addition
to the Winged "O" prospects.
Anderson is a loss in the high jump.
He consistently cleared the bar at bet
ter than six feet. Macintosh was a
comer and always came in second to
Richardson in the half-mile. Dennis
and Scofield placed second and third
respectively in the pole vault against
California and will be missed because
of Templeton's lack of pole vault ma
terial.
The positions left open by these men
will have to be filled by stars of the
1927 freshman track team, which last
year defeated the California Cubs.
Wilbur Adams, a likely man in the
sprints, took first place in the 100-
yard dash in his freshman year against
the Bruin babes, running the distance
in 10 3-5 seconds. He is expected to
improve this season to the 10 1-5 sec
ond mark.
West is the best all-around athlete
recently taken on the squad. He won
the high hurdles in 15 4-5 and took
third in the high jump in his frosh
season. Meeks is a bright prospect for
the broad jump. He is capable of
twenty-three feet.
"Biff" Hoffman, a double winner
against the Bruin yearlings last season
in the weights, has possibilities. He
does not rank close to "Tiny" Hart
ranft, but is expected to improve.
Cruikshank, a transfer from Pomona
College, is a hurdle possibility and may
be able to replace Boles.
Work, of Stanford, and Hampton,
California, are to be pitted against
each other again. Work defeated
Hampton last year in the freshman
meet with a leap of 6 feet 2 inches..
Templeton's veteran material is not
weak. Barring accidents and scholas
tic difficulties these men should be
mainstays: Campbell, Gaspar, sprints;
Hartranft, weights, with a likelihood
of sprints; Kerr and Smith, in the
mile; Miller in the 440; Richardson,
Swayne, and Doyle in the 880; Mc-
Clellan, Cypher, and Clifford in the
two-mile; Leistner in the hurdles; Ar
thur, weights; Evers in the javelin.
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA —
With the remodeling of California's
oval and the completion of a new clay
track, all will be set for the initial
start-off of the 1925 track season.
Having these two important factors
for a successful season almost com
pleted, Walt Christie, California's pro
verbial track coach and former star,
will call his men together for the first
time next Friday afternoon with a
general sign-up rally. Christie says "it
is going to be a hard season and the
boys will have to sacrifice greatly in
order to put out a winning team."
Stanford is adjudged to have an
even stronger team this year than it
had last, when it defeated California
by thirty-five points. Coach Templeton
has a number of veterans to rely upon
among whom are: lan Campbell, a ten
fiat man in the hundred; Leistner, who
took a second place in the high sticks
at the I. C. A. A. A. A.; Ted Miller, a
stellar 440 man, together with Bill
Richardson, a national figure in the
880, and Tom Work, who won the high
jump with the freshmen last year, at
6 feet 2 inches.

fiat man in the hundred; Leistner, who
took a second place in the high sticks
at the I. C. A. A. A. A.; Ted Miller, a
stellar 440 man, together with Bill
Richardson, a national figure in the
880, and Tom Work, who won the high
jump with the freshmen last year, at
6 feet 2 inches.
Practically the entire Stanford var
sity track team has been chosen and
is working out at present under the
direction of Coach "Dink" Templeton. |
Despite the loss of ten letter men
the Cards are thought to possess ma
terial from which to build up anew a
squad which will be in every way as
strong as last season's.
Captain Van judah (440), Mixon
(440), Elliott (mile), Mcintosh (880),
Scofield (pole vault), Denis (pole
vault), and Anderson (high jump),
graduated last year. Hale (100-yard
dash), Boles (hurdles), and Storie 1
(440), will be unable to compete.
These men accounted for 28y 2 points I
in the California meet, Stanford win
ning 83 to 48. California has experi
enced no such disastrous slash in its |
track squad, and has an advantage
over the Cardinals in the matter of
veteran material.
In losing Hale, Storie, and Boles,
"Dink" Templeton was left without
three probable first place men. Hale
won the hundred last year and placed
second in the two-twenty. At present
he is working out with the Olympic
track squad and is a valuable addition
to the Winged "O" prospects.
Anderson is a loss in the high jump.
He consistently cleared the bar at bet
ter than six feet. Macintosh was a
comer and always came in second to
Richardson in the half-mile. Dennis
and Scofield placed second and third
respectively in the pole vault against
California and will be missed because
of Templeton's lack of pole vault ma
terial.
The positions left open by these men
will have to be filled by stars of the
1927 freshman track team, which last
year defeated the California Cubs.
Wilbur Adams, a likely man in the
sprints, took first place in the 100-
yard dash in his freshman year against
the Bruin babes, running the distance
in 10 3-5 seconds. He is expected to
improve this season to the 10 1-5 sec
ond mark.
West is the best all-around athlete
recently taken on the squad. He won
the high hurdles in 15 4-5 and took
third in the high jump in his frosh
season. Meeks is a bright prospect for
the broad jump. He is capable of
twenty-three feet.
"Biff" Hoffman, a double winner
against the Bruin yearlings last season
in the weights, has possibilities. He
does not rank close to "Tiny" Hart
ranft, but is expected to improve.
Cruikshank, a transfer from Pomona
College, is a hurdle possibility and may
be able to replace Boles.
Work, of Stanford, and Hampton,
California, are to be pitted against
each other again. Work defeated
Hampton last year in the freshman
meet with a leap of 6 feet 2 inches..
Templeton's veteran material is not
weak. Barring accidents and scholas
tic difficulties these men should be
mainstays: Campbell, Gaspar, sprints;
Hartranft, weights, with a likelihood
of sprints; Kerr and Smith, in the
mile; Miller in the 440; Richardson,
Swayne, and Doyle in the 880; Mc-
Clellan, Cypher, and Clifford in the
two-mile; Leistner in the hurdles; Ar
thur, weights; Evers in the javelin.
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA —
With the remodeling of California's
oval and the completion of a new clay
track, all will be set for the initial
start-off of the 1925 track season.
Having these two important factors
for a successful season almost com
pleted, Walt Christie, California's pro
verbial track coach and former star,
will call his men together for the first
time next Friday afternoon with a
general sign-up rally. Christie says "it
is going to be a hard season and the
boys will have to sacrifice greatly in
order to put out a winning team."
Stanford is adjudged to have an
even stronger team this year than it
had last, when it defeated California
by thirty-five points. Coach Templeton

boys will have to sacrifice greatly in
order to put out a winning team."
Stanford is adjudged to have an
even stronger team this year than it
had last, when it defeated California
by thirty-five points. Coach Templeton
has a number of veterans to rely upon
among whom are: lan Campbell, a ten
fiat man in the hundred; Leistner, who
took a second place in the high sticks
at the I. C. A. A. A. A.; Ted Miller, a
stellar 440 man, together with Bill
Richardson, a national figure in the
880, and Tom Work, who won the high
jump with the freshmen last year, at
6 feet 2 inches.
Practically the entire Stanford var
sity track team has been chosen and
is working out at present under the
direction of Coach "Dink" Templeton. |
Despite the loss of ten letter men
the Cards are thought to possess ma
terial from which to build up anew a
squad which will be in every way as
strong as last season's.
Captain Van judah (440), Mixon
(440), Elliott (mile), Mcintosh (880),
Scofield (pole vault), Denis (pole
vault), and Anderson (high jump),
graduated last year. Hale (100-yard
dash), Boles (hurdles), and Storie 1
(440), will be unable to compete.
These men accounted for 28y 2 points I
in the California meet, Stanford win
ning 83 to 48. California has experi
enced no such disastrous slash in its |
track squad, and has an advantage
over the Cardinals in the matter of
veteran material.
In losing Hale, Storie, and Boles,
"Dink" Templeton was left without
three probable first place men. Hale
won the hundred last year and placed
second in the two-twenty. At present
he is working out with the Olympic
track squad and is a valuable addition
to the Winged "O" prospects.
Anderson is a loss in the high jump.
He consistently cleared the bar at bet
ter than six feet. Macintosh was a
comer and always came in second to
Richardson in the half-mile. Dennis
and Scofield placed second and third
respectively in the pole vault against
California and will be missed because
of Templeton's lack of pole vault ma
terial.
The positions left open by these men
will have to be filled by stars of the
1927 freshman track team, which last
year defeated the California Cubs.
Wilbur Adams, a likely man in the
sprints, took first place in the 100-
yard dash in his freshman year against
the Bruin babes, running the distance
in 10 3-5 seconds. He is expected to
improve this season to the 10 1-5 sec
ond mark.
West is the best all-around athlete
recently taken on the squad. He won
the high hurdles in 15 4-5 and took
third in the high jump in his frosh
season. Meeks is a bright prospect for
the broad jump. He is capable of
twenty-three feet.
"Biff" Hoffman, a double winner
against the Bruin yearlings last season
in the weights, has possibilities. He
does not rank close to "Tiny" Hart
ranft, but is expected to improve.
Cruikshank, a transfer from Pomona
College, is a hurdle possibility and may
be able to replace Boles.
Work, of Stanford, and Hampton,
California, are to be pitted against
each other again. Work defeated
Hampton last year in the freshman
meet with a leap of 6 feet 2 inches..
Templeton's veteran material is not
weak. Barring accidents and scholas
tic difficulties these men should be
mainstays: Campbell, Gaspar, sprints;
Hartranft, weights, with a likelihood
of sprints; Kerr and Smith, in the
mile; Miller in the 440; Richardson,
Swayne, and Doyle in the 880; Mc-
Clellan, Cypher, and Clifford in the
two-mile; Leistner in the hurdles; Ar
thur, weights; Evers in the javelin.
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA —
With the remodeling of California's
oval and the completion of a new clay
track, all will be set for the initial
start-off of the 1925 track season.
Having these two important factors
for a successful season almost com
pleted, Walt Christie, California's pro
verbial track coach and former star,
will call his men together for the first
time next Friday afternoon with a
general sign-up rally. Christie says "it
is going to be a hard season and the
boys will have to sacrifice greatly in
order to put out a winning team."
Stanford is adjudged to have an
even stronger team this year than it
had last, when it defeated California
by thirty-five points. Coach Templeton
