Freshman women at the University
of Colorado are required to wear dis
tinguishing badges. If they disobey
they stand trial before a court of
sophomore women who have been ap
pointed as policewomen. The badge
must not be concealed in any way,
and no freshman is allowed to chew
| gum, or to walk on the grass.
