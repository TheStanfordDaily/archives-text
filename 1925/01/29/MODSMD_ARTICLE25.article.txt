# SPORTS OF 1925
## Prides of Brooklyn 
### "FEG" MURRAY, '18 
Consider Brooklyn, where we are among champions. Vance, Riggin, and
Martin are three of the most prominent, and each one has achieved his or her
fame comparatively recently.
Ladies first, so little Aileen is discussed before "Dazzy" or Eddie, who are
not nearly so pretty anyway. As everyone who looks at the picture sections of
the papers knows, Aileen Riggin is a champion diver and swimmer. Besides
that, she is a student of ballet dancing, an accomplished cook, and the world's
worst golfer.
At 13 she won the world's diving championship at the Olympic games in
Antwerp, and last year she won a second and a third at Paris, and an
American national championship. One hundred and fifty cups and medals
already prove her prowess as an all-around water champion. Right now she
is in Florida preparing for the women's swimming championships at Miami.
"Dazzy" Vance doesn't live in Brooklyn, but he recently put Brooklyn on the
baseball map in 1924. The premier pitcher of the majors, holder of strike-out
records, most valuable player in the National League, sharp shooter extra
ordinary with a pistol, and comedian par excellence —that's "Dazzy."
Eddie Martin —bantamweight champion of the world —and from Brooklyn.
Sounds pretty good—to Eddie's friends and family anyway. Eddie beat Abe
Attel Goldstein in a hectic battle in Madison Square. Garden just as 1924 was
passing out of the picture. He is Brooklyn's first fighting champion since
Terry McGovern. The title first held by George Dixon should rest across the
Bridge as long as Eddie can make 118 pounds.
