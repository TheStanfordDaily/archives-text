UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA â€”
Thousands of rabid football enthusi
asts who shouted themselves hoarse
last fall as Jimmie Dixon, Cocky
Brown, Frank Thatcher, John Clymer,
and Scotty Tait, members of the 1924
varsity, romped through the season's
mix-ups, will have another opportunity
to see these men in action this spring.
They have been transplanted from the
gridiron to the diamond and are thriv
ing along with Coach Curl Zamloch's
three-score other baseball candidates
who are working out nightly in the
California Memorial Stadium.
Thatchers appears to be a "find" at
first base, his efforts thus far placing
him in the ranks of California's best
infielders. Scotty Tait is hotly contest
ing the keystone position with Howard
Russell. Jimmie Dilxon is showing his
wares in the great open spaces of the
outfield. Clymer, too, is an outfielder,
while Brown is working out as a
pitcher.
Zamloch admits that his team is
still in an embryo stage and is plan
ning his system accordingly. The ne
cessary weeding out will be accom
plished by games between first and
second teams. Summing up the pre
liminary outlook Zamloch said, "We
expect to lose the first few games of
the season. We are running up against
a bunch of semi-professional players
Saturday when we play the Ambrose
Ttailors and I would rather try out
combinations of new material than
concentrate on winning the game. I
will probably continue to do this dur
ing most of the preliminary games."
Next Saturday in the California
Memorial Stadium at 2:30 p.m., the
varsity baseball team meets the Am
brose Tailors, a semi-professional
team from Oakland, in the initial game
of the season. The following Saturday
they play the Redding Reserve Bank.
