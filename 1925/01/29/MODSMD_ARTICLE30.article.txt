# YEARLING BASEBALLERS OPEN SEASON WITH WIN OVER PALO ALTO SOUAD
## 
### 
Heavy hits at frequent intervals en
abled the yearling nine to win its first
game of the year, 8 to 4, over a pick-up
team from Palo Alto on the freshman
diamond yesterday afternoon.
Philippi, who occupied the box for the
babes the first six innings, pitched a win
ning brand of ball. During this time he
; struck out seven men, and only allowed
three hits and two walks. He has a fast
side-arm delivery that kept the Palo
Altans continually on the guess. Philippi
was relieved in the seventh inning by
Sobieski. He allowed two runs in the
I three innings he pitched, but' these were
j partially due to bad fielding.
The yearlings scored three runs in their
! first period at bat, and only once in the
| entire contest was there any danger of the
! Palo Alto team equalling their score. At
| the beginning of the fourth inning the
! score stood 3to 1. Fisher, the first batter
j for the Palo Altans, knocked a home-run.
• Three heavy hitters were the next on deck
| for the visitors, but Philippi sent them to
the bench by the fanout route in one, two,
three order.
Fortune who pitched for the Palo Altans
is a Portland recruit and is reputed to be
a fair pitcher. However, the freshman
! artillery proved a little too strong for him.
The visitors' heavy hitters were Fisher
and Zweirlein. Fisher accounted for a
homer and Zweirlein drove out a three
bagger.
The majority of the Palo Altans are San
Jose and Oakland winter league players.
Only two errors were chalked against
them, but they were powerless against the
heavy batting of the yearlings.
The freshmen played rather ragged in
spots having six errors against them. In
the sixth inning Maguire in center field
made a beautiful catch and in the next
frame he missed an easy one. Busch at
short made a couple of sloppy plays, but
he more than made up for them by pulling
two fast double plays.
Nissens and Sims, who were in left and
right respectively, played good games.
Price at third and Thompson at first lack
experience, but they handled their posi
tions in a creditable manner. Sypher at
backstop and Garibaldi at second played
steady games.
