# SPONSORS LAY DOWN LAWS TO WINDOW SMASHERS AT ENCINA
## 
### 
Stringent measures will be taken
against those who persist in violating
the rules of conduct for Encina hall,
according to Ted Miller, head of the
sponsors. Increased watchfulness and
drastic action, it is hoped, will greatly
reduce the epidemic of water-throwing
and window-breaking that has recently
been in progress at the freshman dor
mitory.
The action is the direct result of a
sponsor meeting held Monday evening,
traditions which directly affect the
freshmen be printed and a copy placed
in each room. By this method the tra
ditions of the "Law steps," the "dink,"
saying "hello," and others, will be fur
ther upheld. Observance of these cus
toms has fallen into more or less dis
use possibly through the ignorance of
the new students.
Several frosh who were guilty of the
crime of presenting their partners
with corsages for the Encina Formal
were reminded that one of the strong
est of customs is that no flowers be
given for such a social occasion.
The ungentlemanly conduct of the
"roughs" at the same dance was also
subject to criticism and action will
be taken to prevent any similar con
duct i nthe future.
An interfraternity horseshoe meet
is to be held at the University of
Chicago.
