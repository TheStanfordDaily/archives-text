# Mixed Freshman Jolly-Up Plans Near Competition
## 
### 
Final plans for the "jolly-up" being
planned between the men and women
jof the freshman class are rounding
' into shape. Next Tuesday night ninety
two freshmen from Eneina hall will be
the guests of the ninety-two freshman
women living at Roble. A dinner-dance
will serve to while away the time.
Music for the occasion which will
last from 6 to 8 will probably be fur
nished by the Cardinal orchestra, and,
if possible, some other form of enter
tainment will be provided also. If
Tuesday's affair is a success more of
these "get-together" dances will be
held.
The main arrangements are being
attended to by Jim Sapero, president
of the freshman class, and he is as
sisted by Anne Bancroft, Carolyn
Grossman, Fenton Barrett, and Bill
Hubbard.
