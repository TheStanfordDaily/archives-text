# MARCH 2 NAMED AS DEADLINE FOR 1926 OPERA MANUSCRIPTS

### 
Manuscripts for the 1926 Junior
Opera will be accepted from now until
March 2 and no later according to the
anouncement of Irving Anschutz,
chairman of the Opera Committee.
Music will also be aceptable until this
date.
This yÂ£ar the authors of the opera
manuscript will be rewarded for their
labors with real hard, cold cash. The
amount is being withheld for fear of
causing too much competition. The
only provision is that all those work
ing on manuscripts must report to the
chairman of the committee. This re
port may be made either in person or
by mail.
"We want to see just who is work
ing on a manuscript," says "Sneeze"
Anschutz, "and for this reason we ask
that every prospective make a report
at an early and prompt date."
"Undoubtedly there is a great deal
of material that will make first class
authors. Our great problem at the
present is to locate this material. We
want more manuscripts this year than
ever before because we intend to be
particular just who gets the cash re
| ward. Remember, we are setting a
i precedent," he concluded.
