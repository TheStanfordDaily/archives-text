# OLYMPIC CLUB BRINGS STRONG COURT QUINTET
## Bonney Outstanding Player, High Scorer in Olympic Club Outfit 
### David Meiklejohn 
The strong Olympic Club quintet,
undefeated this season, expects to
keep a clean record when it meets
the Stanford five here tomorrow night
in the pavilion.
Although undisputedly strong the
Winged "O" squad will meet some
tough opposition in this year's Stan
ford five. A close game is expected
and the Redshirts will have to pnt a
lot on the ball to come out on top.
The Olympic Club game and the
Southern Branch contest next Monday
"winds up the preliminary basketball
season for Stanford and then there is
■some real work ahead of Coach "Andy"
Kerr.
Kerr is of the opinion that if the
Cards had a month more to mould
together the mass of inexperienced
material on hand Stanford would have
an exceptionally powerful basketball
team.
Defeated Last Year
Last year the Olympic Club came to
Stanford with somewhat the same
reputation as this year—strong, unde
feated, and confident of wiping out
the Cards. It took five minutes to
convince the Club men that Stanford
would win the game—and they did,
31 to 11. That isn't predicting any
overwhelming runaway for Stanford,
but Andy Kerr's team beyond a
shadow of present doubt has the stuff
that makes a winner.
Bonney, star of this year's team, and
no mean forward last season, is ex
pected to be the point-getter for the
Post Streeters. Bonney recently pulled
a game out of the fire for the Olympics !
when he shot 16 out of 35 points !
against the Y. M. I. team of San Fran
cisco.
Lauterwasser is another stumbling
"block; although he has had an off
season this year. Last season, and the
season before, Stanford guards have
taken special pains to "get" Lauter
wasser and have succeeded to an as
tonishing degree.
The work of the Cardinal forwards
lias been astonishingly promising in
the last few games. Fred Price seems
to have cinched a steady berth among
the strong scorers, but that does not
belittle the work of Ernie Nevers, and
Nelson David, who to all appearances
are on an equal basis. Nevers, how
ever, still has the edge on both men
because of his passing ability and cool
"headed leadership on the floor.
