# CARDINAL, U. OF C. DEBATERS COMBINE TO OPPOSE OXFORD
## San Francisco Business Men Responsible for Second Forensic Contest 
### 
A combined team composed of de
baters from Stanford and the Univer
sity of California will oppose the Ox
ford university debating team in a
debate to be held in the Exposition
Auditorium in San Francisco on Tues
day.
The subject of the debate is the
same that was contested by the rival
university teams last week. The Eng
lish team will present arguments
against Prohibition, while its oppon
ents will uphold the provisions of the
Eighteenth Amendment.
The reason for the debate being held
in San Francisco is that a great num
ber of people were turned away from
the recent appearances of the Oxford
team at Berkeley and Stanford be
cause of inadequate seating capacities.
The Exposition Auditorium holds ap
proximately 7000 people, and it is
thought that this will provide ample
space for the great number of spec
tators expected.
Large Attendance Expected
A number of prominent business
men of San Francisco are mainly re
sponsible for the appearance of the
British debaters in the Auditorium. So
many people were turned away from
the previous debates, and particularly
San Francisco people, that it is the
opinion of many that the debate held
in San Francisco would be largely
attended. The proceedings are under
the direct management of Selby C.
Oppenheim.
The Oxford team, noted throughout
the world for its cleverness in refut
ing the arguments of its opponents, is
composed of J. D. Woodruff, M. C.
Hollis, and Malcolm Mac Donald. Their
opponents will be Stanley Weigel,
Robert E. Lewis, and Robert Littler,
of Stanford, and Raymond Stanbury,
of the University of California.
