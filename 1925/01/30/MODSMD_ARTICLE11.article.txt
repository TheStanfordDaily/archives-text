Leading golfers from a majority of
the coast universities will gather at
Del Monte on the week-end of Wash
ington's Birthday for the anual Pacific
Coast Intercollegiate Championship,
according to an anouncement made by
Manager "Nick" Carter today.
This tournament is the big event
of the year in college golf in this part
of the country, and is always produc
tive of some excellent scores. Both the
Del Monte and Pebble Beach courses,
which rank among the finest in the
country, will be available for the tour

ticularly sporty, several of the holes
necessitating shots over inlets of the
open ocean.

I offer a trophy for the championship
flight, and other awards will be se
cured as additional prizes. Among the
I institutions likely to be represented
are: Washington, Washington State,
; Oregon Aggies, California, and Stan
j ford. Loren Upson of California won
the championship last year. He later
j took high honors in outside competi-
I tion in California, in the northwest,
and in Canada. He has not yet an
j nounced whether he will defend his
: title.
Carter is completing final arrange
| ments as rapidly as possible, and will
! make public definite plans in the near
j future. Tournament contestants will
find it most convenient to engage
rooms at the Hotel Del Monte. The
average rate is $6 a day, which in
cludes green fees as well as hotel
; accommodations
