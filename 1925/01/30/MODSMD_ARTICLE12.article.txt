# KENEALY SEALS PLAY VARSITY NIKE TOMORROW
## San Francisco Manager Has Strongest Aggregation In Several Years 
### John Levi 
The Kenealy Seals will meet the
varsity nine on the Stanford diamond
at 2:30 tomorrow afternoon. The
Seals have assembled one of the
strongest teams they have had for the
past few years, and the varsity should
be forced to the limit to beat them.
For twirlers Kenealy has Ludoph
and Griffin. Griffin will be remem
bered as the big boy who twice this
season has pitched the Ireland Inde
pendents to victory against the Cardi
nal forces. Burns will be on first,
Keely on second, Baymter on third,
Lazzari at short, and the outfield will
be composed of Hutchinson, Bailey,
and Offer.
The varsity has been playing good
ball, but a hitting slump has proved
disastrous in the games so far this
season. Last week against the Inde
pendents the varsity hitters were only
able to tally up four scattered hits.
Stewart Good
The Stanford infield's playing has
been streaky, but the outfield has been
catching errorless ball. Stewart, in left
field, has made several hair-raising
catches, and "Bus" McCandless in
right is playing equally as well as he
did last season. Dave Brown in center
is one of Wolter's best finds. He has
been playing his portion of the outfield
in good style, and if last week's game
is any indication he will soon be hit
ting like a veteran. Dave's inability to
hit is the big reason why he has not
been used more frequently heretofore.
Solomon, who caught the entire con
test last week, showed up well. From
pitching to catching is a considerable
change for a player to undergo. Jim
Lawson has also been working out
regularly, and so it seems as if the
catching problem has been settled in
a satisfactory maner.
Four Pitchers Ready
Either Aydelotte, Teague, Collins,
or Oviatt will be called upon to start
the game tomorrow. With the excep
tion of Teague all of these men have
pitched part of a game this year.
Aydelotte started both the Ireland
games, and both times he was removed
after taking a bad beating. Collins
and Oviatt have done their turns
creditably.
For infielders Wolter has his four
veterans: Captain "Chuck" Johnston
on first, "Shorty" Roberts on second,
Mulchay at short, and Cuddeback at
third.
