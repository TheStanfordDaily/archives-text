Contrary to the ordinary ethics and practices of journalism in the out
side world, one of the primary functions of the campus newspaper is free
publicity to clubs and organizations of the university. With certain ex
ceptions, most of which realize that they are exceptions and act accordingly,
college papers give quantities of space to material which anywhere else
would run as paid advertising, or run not at all. Which is all very well
and good. The student papers are ordinarily owned by the students them
selves, and it would be fantastic indeed for them to refuse their best co
operation to their owners.
At times, however, it seems to be forgotten by certain of these organi
zations which deserve such support, that the newspaper is also entitled to
a bit of consideration. For instance, it would simplify matters extremely
for each organization to have its own press agent, who would write up the
activities of his client glowing terms, and stroll out and hand it to the
Daily linotype operator. That would relieve the staff of something of a
burden, and release the reporter who chases around after news and gets —
publicity, so that he would have time enough to insert his nose into the
breeze and whiff out a few items which would serve to surprise rather than
remind the campus at large.
Theoretically it would work out that way. Actually, it has frequently
been tried and sometimes works, but not often. A trained newspaper
writer will forsake enthusiasm for his cause sufficiently to*bring his article
into newspaper style, but the average publicity man will struggle so hard
to "sell" his point that his story will invariably have to be rewritten. -So
the campus sheets generally put their own reporters on the job in the
first place, thereby saving trouble in the long run.
