# Plenty for All

Some time ago an editorial appeared approving of the considerable
interest being shown in intramural competition, suggesting that perhaps
a large share of the credit for this showing belongs to those responsible
for the improved accommodations and service at the gymnasium. All of
which we considered very nice of us at the time.
Among other things which have something to do with this praise
worthy situation are major athletic success, minor athletic success and a
number of additional causes. The important point is that everybody
agrees that it is a good thing to have such an interest in intramural ath
letics. To lie exhaustive in the matter of causes and to distribute pro
portionate commendation is practically impossible.
Both Mr. Maloney and Dr. Barrow have done their best for Stanford,
and their best is excellent. â€”H. B. R.
