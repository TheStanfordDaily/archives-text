### Hal 
There seerus to be a general opinion
that college students drink a lot. We
drink water, occasionally, but most
of us don't like wine or beer espe
cially because it fills one up too much.
Besides, when we think how ashamed
we would feel if we should meet the
dean or one of our professors when
we were inebriated we just can't help
but shiver.
Furthermore, one sees very few
cases of drunkenness on the Quad
here at Stanford. We have watched on
week days when everybody is going
to and from classes so that we are
sure that we haven't missed anyone,
and yet we have not seen a single
really drunk person.
Statistics prove our condition. It is
reported that most students become
intoxicated after the Big Game; yet
statistics show that after the Stanford-
California Game this year:
2 college students (probably Cal
men) were found intoxicated.
394 did not sleep comfortably.
1087 spent the week-end in San Fran
cisco.
The compiler of these statistics was
himself a college student. He said he
had a headache the next ..morning,
from working all night getting them.
The average college student spends
his quarterly allowance as follows:
Tuition $96.00
Books 15.25
Laundry 25
Amusements T 29.00
Room and Board ,50i
Miscelloneaus 58.00
Cigarettes, refresh
ments, candy, etc. 147.56
The item marked refreshments in
cludes ice-cream, choc malts, coca
colas, etc. Because of their activities,
college students require a great deal
of refreshment.
If education does away with super
stition, why do so many students be
lieve in spirits? # —M. D. E.
