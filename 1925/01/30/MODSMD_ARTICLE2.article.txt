# 1928 Will Hold Jolly-Up In Roble Tuesday Evening
## 
### 
The freshman committee has made
â€¢definite plans for a Jolly-Up at Roble
Tuesday evening from 6:30 to 8
o'clock. The idea of a dinner dance
lias been abandoned because not all
of the men in the class could be ac
commodated at Roble. The present ar
rangement will allow for more time
to dance to music by the Cardinal
orchestra.
This is to be a class affair and all
of the members of the class of '28 are
expected to attend.
