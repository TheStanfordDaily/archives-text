# PERFECT HARMONY OF EXECUTION MARKS TWO-PIANO RECITAL
## 
### 
Perfect rhythmic harmony, com
bined with ease and spontaneity,
marked the performance of Guy Maier
and Lee Pattison, playing in a two
piano recital last night at the Assembly
hall.
I To judge each artist individually
i would be quite impossible. Distinct
personalities, yet co-ordinating so ab
solutely that the ear could not detect
when one piano ceased carrying the
j melody and the other began.
"Wedding Waltzes" from the "Veil
of Pierrette" by Ernst von Dohnanyi,
j modern pianist and composer, has
I been adapted for two-piano playing by
| Maier, and the sure, light touch of the
j artists brought out all the lively grace
-of the well-known air.
"Chinoiserie" is by Lord Berners,
one of the younger generation of com
posers. The selection was written os
| tensibly as an accompaniment to a
drama, according to the Chinese man
ner which, in Maier's words, "must
have had several murders in the
course of the plot."
In the place of Duvernoy's "Pin
i Wheels," Maier and Pattison gave by
request, "In the Land of Bye and Bye,"
a fox-trot tune by Pattison. Its lilting
melody and bright, inconsequential air,
called for a repetition, and encores,
whereupon selections by Bach and
Arensky, with "Minuet and Gavotte"
by Saint-Saens, were given generously.
