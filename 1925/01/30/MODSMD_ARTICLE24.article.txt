# SPORTS OF 1925
## Did You Know That— 
### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
A non-stop record for playing pocket billiards was established in Chicago
last year when Charles Ross and Mike Omielo played lifteen-ball pool for
fourteen consecutive hours? From nine in the morning until eleven at night
Charley and Mike tried to put the elusive ivories into the pockets, without
even stopping to eat lunch or dinner.
On June 11, 1916, Pitcher Morton of Cleveland struck out four of the
Athletics in succession in the sixth inning? "Impossible!" you say? No,
indeed. "Whitey" Witt hit at a wild pitch, making his third strike, then
succeeded in safely reaching first base. Another incident of four successive
strikeouts in one inning occurred in the majors just ten years before, "Hooks"
Wiltse being the pitcher.
A world's record score for girls' basketball play was made just a year ago in
Bridgeport, when the local high school girls defeated the South Manchester
High lasses, 10»6 to 2? Miss Waters, of the winning team (quite naturally),
scored 59 points by tossing 29 goals and one from the foul line.
