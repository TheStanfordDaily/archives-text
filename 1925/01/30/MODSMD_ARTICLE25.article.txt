# CHI PSI FIVE BEATS ZETES 9-6 IN HARD INTRAMURAL GAME
## 
### 
When Ankele caged two shots in
the latter part of the second half of
the game, the Chi Psi quintet, despite
the absence of Menzies, practically
eliminated Zeta Psi from the running
in League 3 by the score of 9 to 6 last
night.
Scores of the other contests were:
Encina 1W 31, Chinese Club 5; Se
quoia seconds 16, Pirates 10; Delta
Chi 6, Panthers 4; Encina 21 2, Se
quoia 0, by default.
Both Zeta Psi and Chi Psi started
with a rush from the opening whistle.
Close guarding on both sides kept the
forwards from slipping in any goals,
until Sibbett for the Zetes managed to
escape the Chi Psi defense and score
a field goal. Sproul added another shot,
and G. Hayes and W. Hayes each
scored for the Chi Psis before the
close of the half.
in the second half the Chi Psi squad
functioned more as a unit and enabled
Ankele to ring up two more field goals.
Van King scored a foul, while the best
the Zetes had to offer was a field goal
by Sproul. The game as a whole was
hard-played with both sides roughing
it up so that there was little open
basketball.
Pirates Easy
Sequoia seconds had an easy win
over the Pirates, 16 to 10. Brown for
the hall men proved too much for the
independent guards by scoring five
field goals. During the second half he
was able to locate the basket con
sistently from the middle of the floor.
The Pirates played loose basketball
and were not able to make headway
against the Sequoia five. Espy worked
the best for the Pirates and scored
one field goal.
Encina 1W smothered the smaller
and lighter Chinese Club squad 31 to
5. The Chinese were never able to get
the ball from the more powerful fresh
man five. The hall men continually
showered the goal with shots and were
able to use a large number of players.
Read, at forward, starred for the En
cina men with nine points.
Delta Chi Wins
Delta Chi slipped in an extra bas
ket in the second half and won from
the Panthers 6 to 4. The game was
slow throughout, as both team? were
guarding closely. The Panthers opened
the game with a basket by Kellogg
and looked as if they would walk
away with things. Good work by Hood,
Marks, and Rowles put Delta Chi in
the lead.
The Sequoia first squad failed to
appear for the game scheduled with
Encina 2E and gave the game to the
freshmen by forfeit. In the three
rounds which have been played in
tho Intramural tournament, only two
games have been defaulted, which is
a record for all tournaments which
have been played.
