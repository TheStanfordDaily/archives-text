# Skull and Snakes Makes Appeal to Stanford Men
## 
### 
Disappointed in the lack of response
by Stanford rooters to their appeal
last week for better conduct at bas
ketball games, the Skull and Snakes
society sent representatives this noon
to all living groups and dormitory
eating halls in an effort to remedy the
situation.
Such conduct as "razzing" or "boo
ing" the referee or any player was
referred to by the speakers as deplor
able because it lowers the standard
of sportsmanship of Stanford rooters
which in the past has been irreproach
able. Skull and Snakes officers state
that if improvement is not shown at
the games tonight and tomorrow
night, drastic action will be taken to
punish the troublemakers.
