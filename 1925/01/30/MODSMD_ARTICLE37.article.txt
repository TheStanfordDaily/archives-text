Stanford and in Europe, Professor
Findlay said: "I have found as many
students in the Chemistry department
here at Stanford who are as earnestly
engaged in research work for pure

Europe or America. If a country is to
make progress, a certain section of its
scientific men must be engaged in re
search work."
