# STUDENTS WILL GIVE THREE PEACE PLAYS
## 
### 
Three one-act plays, dealing with
the peace movement, will be presented
by University students of the Palo
Alto churches at 8 o'clock tomorrow
evening at the Unitarian hall, Cowper
street at Channing.
The plays are being given by stu
dents interested in the peace move
ment, and were chosen for their pre
sentation of the causes and results
of war, as well as hints toward ways
of attaining peace.
Mrs. Latham True is directing the
first play, "The Meddler," by Henry
Bailey Stevens, which goes back to
the times of duelling, showing how
the same arguments that were pre
sented to show that duelling could not
be done away with, are presented now
in regard to war. "The Patriots," by
Wilfred Wellock, directed by Helen
Lewis, deals with the economic causes
of war, showing how the greed of in
fluential persons is responsible for loss
of life. Barbara Probasco is directing
the third play, "Gas," by Frederick J.
Pohl, which presents the evils of mod
ern warfare. Carlson Bielefeldt, Carol
Hyde, and Mildred Hall are starring
in the various plays.
