# FRESHMAN QUINTET TO FACE STOCKTON HIGH AGGREGATION
## Hunt's Yearling Hoopsters Show Plenty of Power In Early Contests 
### 
"Husky" Huut's freshman backetball
squad will face the strong Stockton
high school quintet in the pavilion as
a preliminary to the varsity game to
morrow night. Little Information has
been obtained regarding the strength
of the Stockton team, but the fact that
it has won the majority of the games
played this season is some indication
of its power.
The freshman team has lost only one
game, Piedmont high being responsi
ble for that defeat. Since losing this
game the freshmen have bucked up
considerably and are showing plenty
of form. Wednesday night they suc
ceeded in taking the much-touted
Santa Clara yearling squad into camp
by a ten-point margin.
Crist Going Good
The starting lineup will no doubt
be Vincenti and Crist at forwards,
Dennis at center, and Clark and Biag
gini at guards. Crist is one of Hunt's
finds, but as yet he does not feel per
fectly at ease on the floor, although he
shows promise.
Vincenti is a cool, consistent player,
and he has been one of the mainstays
of the yearling offense. Dennis at cen
ter is a hard fighter and a fairly
accurate shot. His ability to score
follow-up shots has made him invalu
able.
Clark at running guard is the most
experienced and coolest player on the
squad. His work on both the defense
and offense has been excellent, al
though he has not learned to follow
his shots.
Biaggini at standing guard is one
of the new arrivals on the squad. He
has shown up well in the two games
in which he has played. Moore, who
is a substitute forward, handles him
self in a creditable manner. He has
been given the opportunity to play in
all the contests so far this season and
has tallied many points. Hunt has two
excellent standing guards to relieve
Biaggini. They are Bigelow and Rey
nolds.
