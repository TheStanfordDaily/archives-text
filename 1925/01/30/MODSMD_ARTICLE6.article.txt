# MASQUERS PRESENTS "YOU AND I" TONIGHT
## Polish of Cast Guarantees Sucess of Comedy-Drama by Philip Barry; Plot Has Universal Appeal 
### Douglas Meservey 
"You and I," Philip Barry's delight
ful comedy-drama of American life,
will be presented in the Assembly hall
tonight at 8 o'clock. The production is
the 1925 offering of Masquers and the
society believes that it will be the
acme of dramatic offerings this year.
Two qualities insure the success of
"You and I": its unequalled construc
tion and the brilliancy of its cast. Few
plays offer such a variety of interest
as does Barry's creation. He has put

into it a refreshing love theme, humor
that is strangely new but nevertheless
infectious, and problems of life that
seem quite natural placed in a setting
of the average American home. An
ambitious son, hoping to reconcile
love to art, wishes to marry his child
hood sweetheart, but his father, re

membering his own experience in the
same problem 20 years previous, hesi
tates in approving the combination of
art and love.
Universal Appeal
It was Barry's gift of universal ap
peal that sent his play, "You and I,"
for a continuous run of one year on
Broadway. No matter whether it is
the father soliloquizing, the son mak
ing love, or the aspiring maid preening
before the mirror—the audience never
loses interest in the engaging lines.

Portrayals of American life are fre
quent on the American stage but it is
not often that a play of this kind
makes one believe he is actually
"looking in" on the average home.
There is too often the element of na
turalness lacking. Barry, however, has


Marjorie Allen (left) and Leonard Schwartz (right), in a characteristic
pose from "You and I," which will be presented in the Assembly hall tonight.
