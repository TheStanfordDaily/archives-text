# MASQUERS PRESENTS "YOU AND I" TONIGHT
## Polish of Cast Guarantees Sucess of Comedy-Drama by Philip Barry; Plot Has Universal Appeal 
### Douglas Meservey 
"You and I," Philip Barry's delight
ful comedy-drama of American life,
will be presented in the Assembly hall
tonight at 8 o'clock. The production is
the 1925 offering of Masquers and the
society believes that it will be the
acme of dramatic offerings this year.
Two qualities insure the success of
"You and I": its unequalled construc
tion and the brilliancy of its cast. Few
plays offer such a variety of interest
as does Barry's creation. He has put

into it a refreshing love theme, humor
that is strangely new but nevertheless
infectious, and problems of life that
seem quite natural placed in a setting
of the average American home. An
ambitious son, hoping to reconcile
love to art, wishes to marry his child
hood sweetheart, but his father, re

membering his own experience in the
same problem 20 years previous, hesi
tates in approving the combination of
art and love.
Universal Appeal
It was Barry's gift of universal ap
peal that sent his play, "You and I,"
for a continuous run of one year on
Broadway. No matter whether it is
the father soliloquizing, the son mak
ing love, or the aspiring maid preening
before the mirror—the audience never
loses interest in the engaging lines.

Portrayals of American life are fre
quent on the American stage but it is
not often that a play of this kind
makes one believe he is actually
"looking in" on the average home.
There is too often the element of na
turalness lacking. Barry, however, has

pose from "You and I," which will be presented in the Assembly hall tonight.
incorporated this element into his pro
duction, and when Leonard Schwartz
pleads earnestly tonight that lie be
allowed to marry Marjorie Allen, the
girl next door, there may be many of
the older generation who will feel
themselves quite at home.
Experienced Cast
One of the most polished and experi
enced casts ever seen at Stanford will
present "You and I." Playing the leads
are Virginia Graves as Mrs. Maitland
White, and Alan Robertson, as her
husband. Both parts require portrayals
that call for age, dignity, the poise of
maturity, and an occasional diver
gence to filial paternal love. Both have
experience and, with it as a basis,
have developed parts that will be ex
cellent interpretations of fine charac
ters.
Leonard Schwartz, the son, makes an
interesting juvenile. This is only his
second appearance on the Stanford
boards but he is a new type of juvenile
for this campus and, as such, adds
variety to an inherent ease and force
of presentation. Marjorie Allen, as the
sweetheart, will add another laurel to
the many she has gained in the role of
ingenue in campus productions. Con
tinued work in the same role, how
ever, has not marred the appealing
charm with which she interprets her
parts; rather, she seems more charm
ing each time and tonight will be no
exception.
Velma Randall, as Etta, the maid,
carries alone the comedy of the plot.

The burden does not seem to fall
heavily, however, for, as in "Dulcy,"
she takes her part with all the zest of
true life and sweeps all before her. In
the role of a maid who attempts to
emulate her mistress, Mrs. White, she
creates an interpretation that is dis
tinct and varied from the ordinary
comedy part as is black from white.
Charles Parks puts all the ease and
poise of a veteran into the role of
Geoffery, the old friend of the father.
Globe-trotting and "flitting from pillar
to post like a gouty bumble-bee," he
breezes in on White when the latter is
most depressed, attmpting a reforma
tion. Parks is the most experienced of
the cast and distinguishes his interpre
tations with polished ability.
Contrasted to Parks in experience is
Lowell Matthay as G. T. Warren, typi
cal captain of industry. Yet untried,
Matthay promises much in the way of
future parts as forceful business men
for he has unusual ease and stage
presence.
Further diversion will be offered fol
lowing the presentation of "You and I,"
when its management gives the usual
cast dance! It will be held at the
Women's Clubhouse from 11 to 1
o'clock, couples being admitted for 75
cents.

for a continuous run of one year on
Broadway. No matter whether it is
the father soliloquizing, the son mak
ing love, or the aspiring maid preening
before the mirror—the audience never
loses interest in the engaging lines.

Portrayals of American life are fre
quent on the American stage but it is
not often that a play of this kind
makes one believe he is actually
"looking in" on the average home.
There is too often the element of na
turalness lacking. Barry, however, has

pose from "You and I," which will be presented in the Assembly hall tonight.
incorporated this element into his pro
duction, and when Leonard Schwartz
pleads earnestly tonight that lie be
allowed to marry Marjorie Allen, the
girl next door, there may be many of
the older generation who will feel
themselves quite at home.
Experienced Cast
One of the most polished and experi
enced casts ever seen at Stanford will
present "You and I." Playing the leads
are Virginia Graves as Mrs. Maitland
White, and Alan Robertson, as her
husband. Both parts require portrayals
that call for age, dignity, the poise of
maturity, and an occasional diver
gence to filial paternal love. Both have
experience and, with it as a basis,
have developed parts that will be ex
cellent interpretations of fine charac
ters.
Leonard Schwartz, the son, makes an
interesting juvenile. This is only his
second appearance on the Stanford
boards but he is a new type of juvenile
for this campus and, as such, adds
variety to an inherent ease and force
of presentation. Marjorie Allen, as the
sweetheart, will add another laurel to
the many she has gained in the role of
ingenue in campus productions. Con
tinued work in the same role, how
ever, has not marred the appealing
charm with which she interprets her
parts; rather, she seems more charm
ing each time and tonight will be no
exception.
Velma Randall, as Etta, the maid,
carries alone the comedy of the plot.

The burden does not seem to fall
heavily, however, for, as in "Dulcy,"
she takes her part with all the zest of
true life and sweeps all before her. In
the role of a maid who attempts to
emulate her mistress, Mrs. White, she
creates an interpretation that is dis
tinct and varied from the ordinary
comedy part as is black from white.
Charles Parks puts all the ease and
poise of a veteran into the role of
Geoffery, the old friend of the father.
Globe-trotting and "flitting from pillar
to post like a gouty bumble-bee," he
breezes in on White when the latter is
most depressed, attmpting a reforma
tion. Parks is the most experienced of
the cast and distinguishes his interpre
tations with polished ability.
Contrasted to Parks in experience is
Lowell Matthay as G. T. Warren, typi
cal captain of industry. Yet untried,
Matthay promises much in the way of
future parts as forceful business men
for he has unusual ease and stage
presence.
Further diversion will be offered fol
lowing the presentation of "You and I,"
when its management gives the usual
cast dance! It will be held at the
Women's Clubhouse from 11 to 1
o'clock, couples being admitted for 75
cents.
"You and I," Philip Barry's delight
ful comedy-drama of American life,
will be presented in the Assembly hall
tonight at 8 o'clock. The production is
the 1925 offering of Masquers and the
society believes that it will be the
acme of dramatic offerings this year.
Two qualities insure the success of
"You and I": its unequalled construc
tion and the brilliancy of its cast. Few
plays offer such a variety of interest
as does Barry's creation. He has put

into it a refreshing love theme, humor
that is strangely new but nevertheless
infectious, and problems of life that
seem quite natural placed in a setting
of the average American home. An
ambitious son, hoping to reconcile
love to art, wishes to marry his child
hood sweetheart, but his father, re

membering his own experience in the
same problem 20 years previous, hesi
tates in approving the combination of
art and love.

that call for age, dignity, the poise of
maturity, and an occasional diver
gence to filial paternal love. Both have
experience and, with it as a basis,
have developed parts that will be ex
cellent interpretations of fine charac
ters.
Leonard Schwartz, the son, makes an
interesting juvenile. This is only his
second appearance on the Stanford
boards but he is a new type of juvenile
for this campus and, as such, adds
variety to an inherent ease and force
of presentation. Marjorie Allen, as the
sweetheart, will add another laurel to
the many she has gained in the role of
ingenue in campus productions. Con
tinued work in the same role, how
ever, has not marred the appealing
charm with which she interprets her
parts; rather, she seems more charm
ing each time and tonight will be no
exception.
Velma Randall, as Etta, the maid,
carries alone the comedy of the plot.

The burden does not seem to fall
heavily, however, for, as in "Dulcy,"
she takes her part with all the zest of
true life and sweeps all before her. In
the role of a maid who attempts to
emulate her mistress, Mrs. White, she
creates an interpretation that is dis
tinct and varied from the ordinary
comedy part as is black from white.
Charles Parks puts all the ease and
poise of a veteran into the role of
Geoffery, the old friend of the father.
Globe-trotting and "flitting from pillar
to post like a gouty bumble-bee," he
breezes in on White when the latter is
most depressed, attmpting a reforma
tion. Parks is the most experienced of
the cast and distinguishes his interpre
tations with polished ability.
Contrasted to Parks in experience is
Lowell Matthay as G. T. Warren, typi
cal captain of industry. Yet untried,
Matthay promises much in the way of
future parts as forceful business men
for he has unusual ease and stage
presence.
Further diversion will be offered fol
lowing the presentation of "You and I,"
when its management gives the usual
cast dance! It will be held at the
Women's Clubhouse from 11 to 1
o'clock, couples being admitted for 75
cents.
