## 
### Murray Draper 
The Stanford polo team, champion
outfit of the Pacific Coast last year,
will open the 1925 season next week
with a series of two games with the
team representing the officers of the
Thirtieth Infantry, of the Presidio, San
Francisco. The first game will be
played Tuesday afternoon at 2:30 on
the Highway polo field, and the return
match is scheduled for Friday at the

While but little is known of the
ability of the Presidio team, Captain
J. M. Jenkins, coach of the Stanford
four, is confident that his men will pull
through with a comfortable margin in
their favor.
Team Strong
It is figured that this yearns outfit is
just as strong as the bunch which was
so successful last season.

years' experience playing polo in the
Hawaiian Islands, is expected to prove

i ured to show well at No. 3, and Rocky
j Thomas, at No. 1, is also being looked
! to for some good work.
j Captain Jenkins is looking forward
I to a heavier and more representative
j schedule than has been put through
I in past years. While no definite steps
j have been taken, it is probable that
four or five Pacific Coast universities
will plan to meet in some sort of play
off for the title.
Games Free

j charge, and the Military department
is seeking to secure a large attend
ance. The polo field where the games
