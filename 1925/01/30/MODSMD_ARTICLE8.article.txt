# WEIGHT TEAMS PLAY TWO HOOP GAMES IN PAVILION TONIGHT
## 
### 
Both divisions of the lightweight
cagers will be called into action by
Coach Hal Davis tonight when the
145- and 130>-pound teams will furnish
the court card for the evening in the
pavilion. The 145's are slated to take
on the U. of C. Dental College five in
the feature event at 8 o'clock. In the
preliminary tussle the 130-pound team
will play the West Side Union High
School 130's.
The- Dentist quintet is unlimited in
weight and will cary an advantage
over the Stanford team in that feature.
The Dental College numbers among its
list a few former college basketball
players who are eligible to compete
for the school. So far this season they
have made an impressionable record
and it is certain that the Stanford 145's
will meet their toughest opponents of
the year tonight.
The 145-pound squad is becoming
well-versed in all the arts of the court
game. They seem to have that coveted
combination of a strong defense and
a fast-working offense. In their game
last week the Pharmacy Branch team
was held scoreless the second half,
while the Stanford team rang up ten
points.
Clark and Kunzel work nicely in the
guard positions. Coach Davis is for
tunate in having a number of able
forwards who can take care of them
selves in the fastest of company. Of
these Blazier and Riese have held the
limelight so far and will start tonight.
Stewart will jump at the initial tip-off
but will probably alternate with Smith.
A strong effort will be made by the
Stanford 130's to chalk up their first
victory. So far the Midgets have ex
perienced tough sledding, having lost
both their games by close scores.
Davis plans to start Brockaway and
Meyers at forwards, Lee at center,
and Flobro and Geary in the guard
positions.
