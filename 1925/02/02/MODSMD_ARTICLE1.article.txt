E. 11. Vail, assistant secretary of
the Stanford Y. M. C. A., in comment

know much of the purposes and activi
ties of the Y. M. C. A. at Stanford,

"The Stanford Y. M. C. A. aims to
accomplish certain very definite things
for the benefit of the student body.
It issues annually 1200 freshman hand
books, it conducts a series of 'On the
Boat' assemblies for the instruction of
freshmen in Stanford traditions and
ideals, and it sponsors discussion
groups on topics of vital interest.
Every year prominent speakers are
secured to address the student body
as a whole. This year Dr. F. N. Seerley,
speaking on 'Manhood," and Sherwood
Eddy, who spoke on "The World Situa
tion," came to Stanford under the
auspic.ecs of the Y. M. C. A.
"These are only a few of the activi
ties of the organization, in which more
than 500 Stanford men are now en
rolled. And yet, although practically all
of the benefits of the organization go
to students, only one dollar comes from
the student body for every twelve that
is contributed from other sources."
