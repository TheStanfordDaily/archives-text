# STANFORD DEFEATS CLUBMEN 21 TO 18
## Shipkey's Points Cinch Game For Redshirts Five In Final Rally 
### 
By staging a last minute comeback, in
a game filled with uncertainties and bril
liant shooting, Stanford was able to nose
out the Olympic Club quintet 21 to 18 in
the Stanford pavilion last Saturday night'.
The Olympic Club was ahead at the end
of the first half", 11 to 10.
Harry Shipkey's three points, scored
two minutgs before thÂ£ game ended, were
virtually the deciding factors in the Card
victory. The score stood IB to 16 in favor
of the Post Streeters, when Shipkey tal
lied a field goal and a foul shot, putting
Stanford ahead 19 to 18. Ernie Nevers
followed in that hectic final spurt with
another field goal and cinched the game
for the Red Shirts.
Never at any point in the game did
either team hold an advantage for long.
The equal distribution of points showed
that both squads were using team work
to an advantage.
Nevers and Harry Shipkey were both
high point men with five markers.
Second Half Close.
At the beginning of the second half
Stanford took a 12 to 11 lead,, when An
derson tallied on a shot from the floor.
The Cards at one time held an advantage
'of 16 to 11, but good shooting by Dono
van and Boyle, and a foul conversion by
Rogers tied the score at 16 to 16. It was
at this point that the Cardinals found the
goal with inrceasing familiarity.
Stanford used a clever passing forma
tion in driving the ball near the goal. But
despite this, the Olympic Club defense
was strong at all times and Stanford was
forced to take advantage of a great many
open shots, which were usually long.
