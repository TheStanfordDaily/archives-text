# "YOU AND I" PLEASES IN PREMIER CAMPUS SHOWING
## 
### Hal Rorke 
Those who got a program for "The
Torchbearers" will remember that they
were advised by the Dramatic Council
to attend "You and I," the play by
Philip Barry which the Masquers So
ciety presented Friday evening. And
on the program for "You and I," thea
tregoers are urged to attend the Rani's
Head show and "Macbeth." If there is
any consistency in programs, be sure
to do so.
| "You and I" was splendid. It is a
1 drama about fine people, and it was
j sympathetically acted. Comforting it
is to watch characters who do as they
I think rather than as someone thinks

Miss Randall's performance of Etta

enthusiasm of as many of the cash cus
tomers as could be canvassed. It will
be betraying no confidences to say
that, in the opinion of moat, Miss Ran

Virginia Graves, who was elected to
Masquers together with Miss Randall,
by the way, demonstrated something
very nice in the way of mothers, play

strained, she made the most of a good
part. At any rate, Miss Graves ap
peared to distinct advantage acting
with Charles Parks and Alan Robert
son, whose abilities are so well known
as to be hardly a matter for comment.
Marjorie Allen and Leonard Schwartz
had the difficult jobs of performing in
straight parts, perhaps the hardest
kind of a thing for amateur actors to
get away with before an audience of
people with whom they are personally
acquainted. The jury of complimen
tary ticket holders were aware of this
and were all set for having a fine time
being magnanimous about it, but noth
! ing ever came of the difficulty. The
roles of Veronica Duane and Roderick
White were taken care of in the most
pleasant fashion possible.
Nor was "You and I" without its
"find." The honor of being the dra
