Stanford rooters will have the oppor
tunity to practice songs and yells at
4:45 o'clock Thursday afternoon at
the pavilion in preparation for the first
game of the U. C.-Cardinal series. At
this time the Rally Committee is to be
host to the entire campus at the first
Big Game basketball rally of the sea
son.
The varsity will be on hand to prac
tice before the rooters and to see the
student body's appreciation and sup
port by the turnout and spirit.
Tryoutees for the yell leader's job
will have their first chance to show
their ability when they will be given
opportunity to lead yells and songs.
The singing, yelling, listening, and
watching will not last more than an
hour and, according to the chairman
of the Rally committee, this short time
is to be filled with plenty of fire.
Almost.the entire capacity of the
pavilion has been sold for the first
California game and the committee is
laying plans for a well-organized sec
tion. No tickets are to be put on sale
to the general public. %
Plans are also being made to conduct
an organized rooting section at the
California games in the Oakland Audi
torium. In the past, rooters have been
scattered all over one side of the audi
torium, but this season the special
section is to be reserved.
