Southern Branch meets the Stanford
basketball team in the last preliminary
game of the season in the Pavilion at 8
o'clock tonight. .
The Southerners have already suffered
one defdat at the hands of the Cardinals
by the narrow margin of 21 to 17, and
the Red Shirts are doped to repeat the
performance again tonight.
Win Means Edge on Bears.
Should Stanford clear this last hurdle
in the way of a clean record before the
California series it will mean the upper
hand against the Bruin five next Saturday.
It will be a high hurdle to clear, and the
game should be as full of excitement and
good playing as was the Olympic Club
game last Saturday.
Taken all in all Stanford has, without
any undue optimism, a good opportunity
to take the series from California next
Saturday. This is not giving Stanford the
upper hand; for it was the sad experience
of the Stanford team last year to buck up
against a California team which had suf
fered a few defeats at the hands of teams
which Stanford had defeated heavily.
The Cards have by no means reached
the peak of condition and perfection. Each
week has brought forth some new im
provement, and this week should be a rule
rather than the exception.
Men Working Together
Andy Kerr's aggregation defeated a
good basketball team when it trounced
the Olympic Club last Saturday. It
brought out new strength and ability in the
Stanford team. It was not won by any
individual player ,as the points were dis
tributed fairly equally among all the play
ers. The victory was due more to the
good team work used by Stanford in car
rying the ball down the court and toward
the goal.
The line-up:
Southern Branch Stanford.
