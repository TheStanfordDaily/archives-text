# FRESHMAN QUINTET TARES GAME FROM STOCKTON 23 TO 19
## 
### 
Oakland High School will send its
basketball team against the Cardinal
freshmen tonight in a preliminary
game to the Varsity-S. B. U. C. engage
ment. Oakland is bringing a strong
aggregation that has triumphed over
several other teams of the Bay Dis
trict.
The Cardinal babes added another
victory to this season's total when
they handed the Stockton high school
quintet a 23 to 19 defeat last Saturday
night.
Stockton was undoubtedly the best
team that the babes have met this
year, playing an exceptionally fast of
fensive game. Hunt's charges demon
strated the best teamwork of the sea
son and in the last half kept ,Stockton
trailing three or four points all the
time.
% Dennis Out
Denis was missing from the regular
lineup and Clark was forced to take
his place at center while Davidson
filled in at running guard. These
changes in positions slowed the game
for awhile, and at half time the fresh
men only led 8 to 7.
Bush, of Stockton, dropped five out
of six free throws through the hoop
and was high point man of the game,
totalling nine points. Vincenti and
Clark, for the babes, were next with
eight and seven tallies.
Bush and Sweet, the visiting for
wards, kept the Redshirt defense run
ning in circles most of the evening.
Stanford spent very little time and
energy in protecting the basket and
concentrated most of their efforts on
the offense.
Stockton Fast
The visitors were quick to take ad
vantage of this with the result that
on almost every Sockton throw-in from
near the center of the court, Bush or
Sweet had the ball with only the
Cardinal standing guard between them
and the basket. Most of their field
goals came from this play.
The line-up against Stockton was:
Stanford (23) Stockton (19)
Vincenti (8) F Sweet (3)
Crist (4) F Bush (9)
Clark (7) C Mahaffey
Davidson (2) G Calcaterra (1)
Biaggini G • Barsi
Substitutes —Stanford: Moore 2, for
Vincenti. Stockton: Caviligia 4, for
Bush; McCoy 2, for Calcaterra.

John F. "Chick" Meehan, former
Syracuse coach, has been signed by
