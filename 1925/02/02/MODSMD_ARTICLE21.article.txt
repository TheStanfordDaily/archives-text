Campus music lovers, and others who might love music if they had a
chance to hear more of it, will have the opportunity of their lives tomor
row, when the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra visits Stanford for the
first of a series of two concerts.
Those who have made the trip to the city for the purpose of listening
in on this orchestra will be there en masse, and the Daily advises all others
to accept this chance for real enjoyment and relaxation. Except for Penin
sula Concerts and the organ recitals in the Memorial Church, good music
is rare around the Quad, and the San Francisco Symphony is the best of
good music.
The Daily congratulates and thanks the committee in charge, and hopes
that the Symphony concerts will become an annual treat.
EDITORIAL STAFF of the Daily will meet tomorrow at 1 o'clock
to vote for a new editor.
