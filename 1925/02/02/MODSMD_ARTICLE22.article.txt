(Editor's Note: The following verse zt'as the last course of a farezvell banquet
given "Pop" Warner by the residents of Springville, New York, whence he has
just moved to Palo Alto. The poem zt'as read by Jim Marks, athletic director of
Kiski Prep; its author is anonymous, and it is reproduced from the Springville
Journal jor January 1925.)
THE SAGE OF SPRINGVILLE
The Sage of Springville moves away to bask ou sunnier slopes,
Where folks grow roses by the ton, and live on cantaloupes;
Where night and day (the natives say) the sun shines in the sky,
And movie stars and fleas and flowers and coaches never die.
His paintings, pups, and relics rare across the land he sends,
He'd have to lease a whole railroad to transport all his friends.
He's hired a box car for his stuff, 'tis Springville's darkest hour;
With lofted brows the neighbors ask "What's in those kegs marked 'flour'?"
Behind he leaves a hapless host, his victims strew the sod.
The redskins that cleaned Custer out, he tempered with a nod.
Old Harvard, Yale, Cornell, and Penn he fed his flying dust,
While Bezdek, roaring lion-like, retired in glum discust.
I
At Wanakah fareway and green will miss his home-made mace;
San Smith, Doc Waite and Old Man Par lie strewn about the place.
But on Pacific's sunny links, when scores mount ever high,
We warn you, Pop, you can't use that "lumbago" alibi.
But coaches old and coaches young will miss the old man most.
To all he lent a helping hand, from Neophyte to Yost.
With sympathy and insight rare he helped us through the rough;
Why even Jones and Giggling Gil are using Pop's old stuff.
When Stanford's "Red Birds," New Year's Day, matched gallops with the
"Harps,"
Pop didn't have a snowball's chance, according to the sharps,
But as we got it thru the air and learned that Stanford lost
We felt that fate and luck combined had Warner double-crossed.
When Cuddeback kicked short and wide we all felt sad and sick;
When Layden grabbed a Stanford pass we sighed "you lucky Mick;"
When Crowley's kick far down the field was fumbled fftr a score,
A lot of people swore just then who never swore before.
Yet Pop takes bad luck with the good; he may have lost a bet,
But Scoby-like, he gave a grunt and lit a cigarette.
When Nevers' plunge three inches lacked the whole world must have sighed,
And sitting by my office desk I—l —By Gad! I cried.
He's won and lost with mein serene; he'll win and lose some more,
But Glenn will play the old game out, no matter what the score.
While others seek, thru printer's ink, to win enduring fame,
The Canery King, The Springville Sage, will simply play the game.
When Referee blows the final blast that ends his earthly game,
A million fans will shed a tear in reverence of his name;
And whether he coaches in heaven above, or whether he coaches in hell.
He'll find the old gang on the job to give a friendly yell.

His paintings, pups, and relics rare across the land he sends,
He'd have to lease a whole railroad to transport all his friends.
He's hired a box car for his stuff, 'tis Springville's darkest hour;
With lofted brows the neighbors ask "What's in those kegs marked 'flour'?"
Behind he leaves a hapless host, his victims strew the sod.
The redskins that cleaned Custer out, he tempered with a nod.
Old Harvard, Yale, Cornell, and Penn he fed his flying dust,
While Bezdek, roaring lion-like, retired in glum discust.
I
At Wanakah fareway and green will miss his home-made mace;
San Smith, Doc Waite and Old Man Par lie strewn about the place.
But on Pacific's sunny links, when scores mount ever high,
We warn you, Pop, you can't use that "lumbago" alibi.
But coaches old and coaches young will miss the old man most.
To all he lent a helping hand, from Neophyte to Yost.
With sympathy and insight rare he helped us through the rough;
Why even Jones and Giggling Gil are using Pop's old stuff.
When Stanford's "Red Birds," New Year's Day, matched gallops with the
"Harps,"
Pop didn't have a snowball's chance, according to the sharps,
But as we got it thru the air and learned that Stanford lost
We felt that fate and luck combined had Warner double-crossed.
When Cuddeback kicked short and wide we all felt sad and sick;
When Layden grabbed a Stanford pass we sighed "you lucky Mick;"
When Crowley's kick far down the field was fumbled fftr a score,
A lot of people swore just then who never swore before.
Yet Pop takes bad luck with the good; he may have lost a bet,
But Scoby-like, he gave a grunt and lit a cigarette.
When Nevers' plunge three inches lacked the whole world must have sighed,
And sitting by my office desk I—l —By Gad! I cried.
He's won and lost with mein serene; he'll win and lose some more,
But Glenn will play the old game out, no matter what the score.
While others seek, thru printer's ink, to win enduring fame,
The Canery King, The Springville Sage, will simply play the game.
When Referee blows the final blast that ends his earthly game,
A million fans will shed a tear in reverence of his name;
And whether he coaches in heaven above, or whether he coaches in hell.
He'll find the old gang on the job to give a friendly yell.
(Editor's Note: The following verse zt'as the last course of a farezvell banquet
given "Pop" Warner by the residents of Springville, New York, whence he has
just moved to Palo Alto. The poem zt'as read by Jim Marks, athletic director of
Kiski Prep; its author is anonymous, and it is reproduced from the Springville
Journal jor January 1925.)
THE SAGE OF SPRINGVILLE
The Sage of Springville moves away to bask ou sunnier slopes,
Where folks grow roses by the ton, and live on cantaloupes;
Where night and day (the natives say) the sun shines in the sky,
And movie stars and fleas and flowers and coaches never die.
His paintings, pups, and relics rare across the land he sends,
He'd have to lease a whole railroad to transport all his friends.
He's hired a box car for his stuff, 'tis Springville's darkest hour;
With lofted brows the neighbors ask "What's in those kegs marked 'flour'?"
