# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT
## 
### 
The Editor —Sir:
It was with genuine regret and deep I
indignation that I learned of the Ad- J
ministration's avowed intention of
compelling all residents of the Univer
sity dormitories to secure their meals
in University dining halls. As I am a
resident of Braner hall and am not at
present eating in the Braner dining I
hall, I realize that the new regulation, j
when put into effect, will peculiarly !
touch me, and when * consider the
arbitrary manner with which the "pow- 1
ers that be" have made their decision, !
I canont resist the urge to cry out
against it.
You ask me why I do not take ad
vantage of the Branner dining hall?
The reason is not because I am dis
satisfied with the food served there —
although, to be sure, it is by no means
the delight of epicureans—but rather
that I value highly the independence
and convenience of a nomadic campus
life. I likt! to eat where I please, when
I please, what I please, and with whom
I please. And I know of no reason why
I should not be allowed to do so. Of
course, if I were a> youngster at a
boys' boarding school' or military
academy, or a member of the weaker
sex abiding at RotJle, or even a tender
freshman of Encina, I should perhaps
submit without a murmur; but such is
not the case. It may be that the Ad
ministration is motivated by a desire
to save my scholastic record from ruin.
But what a queer coincidence that last
quarter, during which I was a boarder
at the dining hall, was my most unsuc
cessful from a scholastic standpoint
of any quarter up to date! Of course,
I attach no particular importance to
this coincidence; but it is true that one
can meet his duties and responsibili
ties more efficiently when allowed to
order his personal matters according
to his own tastes.
I must not neglect the financial side
of this problem. The Administration
reminds us that it has made a tre
-1 mendous expenditure in order to be
stow a first-class dining hall upon us,
and charges us with lack of apprecia
tion for the "gift." It finds that the
dining hall •is a financial failure as
matters now stand, for the students
are not supporting it. But if there
existed a real need for a dining hall
j at Branner, why this failure? If there
existed no such need and demand, why
did the Administration throw its
money into the project? A "gift," in
deed! What kind of a gift is it that
j must be forced upon those to whom
it is given?
The Administration has spoken;
the matter is, I take it, settled. If I
am to be the dictator of my daily
calendar, if I am to be the master of
my diet, if I am to be the chooser of
my table companions, I suppose there
is only one thing for me to do: pack
up my belongings and remove myself
to a distant room in our fair metropolis
of Palo Alto.

The Editor —Sir:
The fermented beverage has passed
away. Some of us were glad to see
it go. We felt that the law was good
for our fellow men, but who cares
where I eat my dinner? I see no great
good to mankind which will come of
my eating my dinner at either Encina
or Branner dining hall.
I came to Stanford in 1922. I ate
at the Union as a regular boarder. It
seems that the Union was at that time
running short. The food was terrible.
I took my share of the burden with
a smile, and paid my board promptly
—there was a fine if I didn't. Even
then revolt rankled inside of me. The
doctor said it was indigestion, but I
know it was revolt. Before me was
the rosy promise of board at Encina.
Then the bubble burst. I boarded at
Encina. Sometimes the food was very
good—stew, and more often not —
steak.
I was told that a few years of col
lege would give me some sense. Father
was right! It took me two years to
discover it, but I'm glad to walk to
town twice a day for my meals. They
are far superior to any I can get on the
campus. You may ask, is this true and
if so why? If you doubt me eat at
Encina for awhile. The answer to the
question "why?" seems to me to lie in

the very thing the University is going
to do. I want to know where you ever
saw a person breaking his back trying
to keep down the cost of production
in a monopoly. No, he was using all
his strength on the squeeze. I have
seen men trying their best to reduce
the cost of production under competi
tion, and have seen them bring it to
the minimum. That is why I can get
| better food for my money in Palo Alto,
I and that is why I will eat there until,
j like the prodigal son, I have to return
| to the fatted calf —liver.
Confidentially, Sir, the whole thing
| seems very encouraging. I have a
; terrible time each morning trying to
I decide what color necktie to wear.
I „
j Can t you see a time when this strug
gle of indecision, like all other social
and economic evils of our campus, will
l be settled by a rule?

the very thing the University is going
to do. I want to know where you ever
saw a person breaking his back trying
to keep down the cost of production
in a monopoly. No, he was using all
his strength on the squeeze. I have
seen men trying their best to reduce
the cost of production under competi
tion, and have seen them bring it to
the minimum. That is why I can get
| better food for my money in Palo Alto,
I and that is why I will eat there until,
j like the prodigal son, I have to return
| to the fatted calf —liver.
Confidentially, Sir, the whole thing
| seems very encouraging. I have a
; terrible time each morning trying to
I decide what color necktie to wear.
I „
j Can t you see a time when this strug
gle of indecision, like all other social
and economic evils of our campus, will
l be settled by a rule?

The Editor —Sir:
It was with genuine regret and deep I
indignation that I learned of the Ad- J
ministration's avowed intention of
compelling all residents of the Univer
sity dormitories to secure their meals
in University dining halls. As I am a
resident of Braner hall and am not at
present eating in the Braner dining I
hall, I realize that the new regulation, j
when put into effect, will peculiarly !
touch me, and when * consider the
arbitrary manner with which the "pow- 1
ers that be" have made their decision, !
I canont resist the urge to cry out
against it.
You ask me why I do not take ad
vantage of the Branner dining hall?
The reason is not because I am dis
satisfied with the food served there —
although, to be sure, it is by no means
the delight of epicureans—but rather
that I value highly the independence
and convenience of a nomadic campus
life. I likt! to eat where I please, when
I please, what I please, and with whom
I please. And I know of no reason why
I should not be allowed to do so. Of
course, if I were a> youngster at a
boys' boarding school' or military
academy, or a member of the weaker
sex abiding at RotJle, or even a tender
freshman of Encina, I should perhaps
submit without a murmur; but such is
not the case. It may be that the Ad
ministration is motivated by a desire
to save my scholastic record from ruin.
But what a queer coincidence that last
quarter, during which I was a boarder
at the dining hall, was my most unsuc
cessful from a scholastic standpoint
of any quarter up to date! Of course,
I attach no particular importance to
this coincidence; but it is true that one
can meet his duties and responsibili
ties more efficiently when allowed to
order his personal matters according
to his own tastes.
I must not neglect the financial side
of this problem. The Administration
reminds us that it has made a tre
-1 mendous expenditure in order to be
stow a first-class dining hall upon us,
and charges us with lack of apprecia
tion for the "gift." It finds that the
dining hall •is a financial failure as
matters now stand, for the students
are not supporting it. But if there
existed a real need for a dining hall
j at Branner, why this failure? If there
existed no such need and demand, why
did the Administration throw its
money into the project? A "gift," in
deed! What kind of a gift is it that
j must be forced upon those to whom
it is given?
The Administration has spoken;
the matter is, I take it, settled. If I
am to be the dictator of my daily
calendar, if I am to be the master of
my diet, if I am to be the chooser of
my table companions, I suppose there
is only one thing for me to do: pack
up my belongings and remove myself
to a distant room in our fair metropolis
of Palo Alto.

The fermented beverage has passed
away. Some of us were glad to see
it go. We felt that the law was good
for our fellow men, but who cares
where I eat my dinner? I see no great
good to mankind which will come of
my eating my dinner at either Encina
or Branner dining hall.
I came to Stanford in 1922. I ate
at the Union as a regular boarder. It
seems that the Union was at that time
running short. The food was terrible.
I took my share of the burden with
a smile, and paid my board promptly
—there was a fine if I didn't. Even
then revolt rankled inside of me. The
doctor said it was indigestion, but I
know it was revolt. Before me was
the rosy promise of board at Encina.
Then the bubble burst. I boarded at
Encina. Sometimes the food was very
good—stew, and more often not —
steak.
I was told that a few years of col
lege would give me some sense. Father
was right! It took me two years to
discover it, but I'm glad to walk to
town twice a day for my meals. They
are far superior to any I can get on the
campus. You may ask, is this true and
if so why? If you doubt me eat at

I came to Stanford in 1922. I ate
at the Union as a regular boarder. It
seems that the Union was at that time
running short. The food was terrible.
I took my share of the burden with
a smile, and paid my board promptly
—there was a fine if I didn't. Even
then revolt rankled inside of me. The
doctor said it was indigestion, but I
know it was revolt. Before me was
the rosy promise of board at Encina.
Then the bubble burst. I boarded at
Encina. Sometimes the food was very
good—stew, and more often not —
steak.
I was told that a few years of col
lege would give me some sense. Father
was right! It took me two years to
discover it, but I'm glad to walk to
town twice a day for my meals. They
are far superior to any I can get on the
campus. You may ask, is this true and
if so why? If you doubt me eat at
Encina for awhile. The answer to the
question "why?" seems to me to lie in

the very thing the University is going
to do. I want to know where you ever
saw a person breaking his back trying
to keep down the cost of production
in a monopoly. No, he was using all
his strength on the squeeze. I have
seen men trying their best to reduce
the cost of production under competi
tion, and have seen them bring it to
the minimum. That is why I can get
| better food for my money in Palo Alto,
I and that is why I will eat there until,
j like the prodigal son, I have to return
| to the fatted calf —liver.
Confidentially, Sir, the whole thing
| seems very encouraging. I have a
; terrible time each morning trying to
I decide what color necktie to wear.
I „
j Can t you see a time when this strug
gle of indecision, like all other social
and economic evils of our campus, will
l be settled by a rule?
Sincerely, H. K. D.

The Editor —Sir:
It was with genuine regret and deep I
indignation that I learned of the Ad- J
ministration's avowed intention of
compelling all residents of the Univer
sity dormitories to secure their meals
in University dining halls. As I am a
resident of Braner hall and am not at
present eating in the Braner dining I
hall, I realize that the new regulation, j
when put into effect, will peculiarly !
touch me, and when * consider the
arbitrary manner with which the "pow- 1
ers that be" have made their decision, !
I canont resist the urge to cry out
against it.
You ask me why I do not take ad
vantage of the Branner dining hall?
The reason is not because I am dis
satisfied with the food served there —
although, to be sure, it is by no means
the delight of epicureans—but rather
that I value highly the independence
and convenience of a nomadic campus
life. I likt! to eat where I please, when
I please, what I please, and with whom
I please. And I know of no reason why
I should not be allowed to do so. Of
course, if I were a> youngster at a
boys' boarding school' or military
academy, or a member of the weaker
sex abiding at RotJle, or even a tender
freshman of Encina, I should perhaps
submit without a murmur; but such is
not the case. It may be that the Ad
ministration is motivated by a desire
to save my scholastic record from ruin.
But what a queer coincidence that last
quarter, during which I was a boarder
at the dining hall, was my most unsuc
cessful from a scholastic standpoint
of any quarter up to date! Of course,
I attach no particular importance to
this coincidence; but it is true that one
can meet his duties and responsibili
ties more efficiently when allowed to
order his personal matters according
to his own tastes.
I must not neglect the financial side
of this problem. The Administration
reminds us that it has made a tre
-1 mendous expenditure in order to be
stow a first-class dining hall upon us,
and charges us with lack of apprecia
tion for the "gift." It finds that the
dining hall •is a financial failure as
matters now stand, for the students
are not supporting it. But if there
existed a real need for a dining hall
j at Branner, why this failure? If there
existed no such need and demand, why
did the Administration throw its
money into the project? A "gift," in
deed! What kind of a gift is it that
j must be forced upon those to whom
it is given?
The Administration has spoken;
the matter is, I take it, settled. If I
am to be the dictator of my daily
calendar, if I am to be the master of
my diet, if I am to be the chooser of
my table companions, I suppose there
is only one thing for me to do: pack
up my belongings and remove myself
to a distant room in our fair metropolis
of Palo Alto.
Sincerely, GEORGE. N. CROCKER.

The fermented beverage has passed
away. Some of us were glad to see
it go. We felt that the law was good
for our fellow men, but who cares
where I eat my dinner? I see no great
good to mankind which will come of
my eating my dinner at either Encina
or Branner dining hall.
