# Students Rate Holiday Washington's Birthday; Will Rest February 23
## 
### 
Thanks to one George Washington, the 1
students of Stanford University will en
joy an additional day of rest this year, j
Out of respect to the nation's founder the j
powers that be have decreed a holiday for
Monday, February 23, inasmuch as Feb
ruary 22 falls on a Sunday.
The cause of this unlooked for gener- j
osity on the part of the faculty remains a '
mystery. Last year they remained ada
mant in favor of business as usual on this j
most important day. Lincoln's birthday is
evidently considered a less important date,
as no respites from studies will be granted
February 12.
