# DENTISTS EXTRACT 36-15 WIN FROM 145-POUND TEAM
## 
### 
A heavy, speedy, and experienced
team from the U. of C. Dental College
slipped a muchly resisted trouncing to
the Stanford 145's Friday night with a
score of 36 to 15. In the preliminary
game the 130-pound cagers came
through with a win over the West Side
Union High School lightweights by a
17 to 8 score.
If the Dental College players can fill
teeth as they fill the baskets they are
all due for professional fame. A for
ward by the name of Farrar can also
lay claim to the original title of "Dead-
Eye Dick." This lone individual ac
counted for 17 points by himself. If
any Dentist's aim should err so much
that the ball didn't hit the ring at least,
lie was immediately relieved by one
who had better control.
All of the visflors have had two or
three years' experience on some club
or school team, and they were un
limited in weight. Farrar was on the
California varsity squad last year;
Kearns was a member of a champion
ship Olympic Club lightweight team;
Wilson at present plays on the Olympic
Club five. These facts offer some con
solation to the Stanford 145's who
could meet the sweeping offense of
their opponents only with fight.
Dentists' Aim Good
Whenever the Stanford team worked
the ball down to their own end and it
went astray the Dentists passed or
dribbled it back with such speed that
the guards stood very little chance of
preventing two or three shots at the
hoop. And in-so-much as the California
players had uncanny aim only a board
over the basket could prevent a field
goal now and then.
Riese and Parsons did the best work
for Stanford, each accounting for five
points. A shift in the guard combina
tion failed to make a great difference
in checking the scoring of the Dentists
although Clark and Cairns seemed to
display the most aggressiveness.
130's in Good Form
The 130-pound game was a one
sided affair in which the Stanford
lightweights exhibited the best form
they have shown this year. Meyers
found the range of the basket and
dropped in four field goals.
When a comfortable lead had been
sesecured Coach Hal Davis gave the
substitutes a workout and the lineup
was changed constantly. The 130's
showed great improvement in their
game especially in the passing and
teamwork departments.

score of 36 to 15. In the preliminary
game the 130-pound cagers came
through with a win over the West Side
Union High School lightweights by a
17 to 8 score.
If the Dental College players can fill
teeth as they fill the baskets they are
all due for professional fame. A for
ward by the name of Farrar can also
lay claim to the original title of "Dead-
Eye Dick." This lone individual ac
counted for 17 points by himself. If
any Dentist's aim should err so much
that the ball didn't hit the ring at least,
lie was immediately relieved by one
who had better control.
All of the visflors have had two or
three years' experience on some club
or school team, and they were un
limited in weight. Farrar was on the
California varsity squad last year;
Kearns was a member of a champion
ship Olympic Club lightweight team;
Wilson at present plays on the Olympic
Club five. These facts offer some con
solation to the Stanford 145's who
could meet the sweeping offense of
their opponents only with fight.
Dentists' Aim Good
Whenever the Stanford team worked
the ball down to their own end and it
went astray the Dentists passed or
dribbled it back with such speed that
the guards stood very little chance of
preventing two or three shots at the
hoop. And in-so-much as the California
players had uncanny aim only a board
over the basket could prevent a field
goal now and then.
Riese and Parsons did the best work
for Stanford, each accounting for five
points. A shift in the guard combina
tion failed to make a great difference
in checking the scoring of the Dentists
although Clark and Cairns seemed to
display the most aggressiveness.
130's in Good Form
The 130-pound game was a one
sided affair in which the Stanford
lightweights exhibited the best form
they have shown this year. Meyers
found the range of the basket and
dropped in four field goals.
When a comfortable lead had been
sesecured Coach Hal Davis gave the
substitutes a workout and the lineup
was changed constantly. The 130's
showed great improvement in their
game especially in the passing and
teamwork departments.
