# Headlight Certificates Not Required for 1925 Automobile Registration
## 
### 
Rumors that certificates from official
headlight adjusting stations would bo
required before 1925 license plates
would be issued have been branded
as false in a statement issued by
George S. Grant, manager of the tour
ing bureau of the California State
Automobile Association. He said that
! there was no foundation for such ru
mors either in the motor vehicle laws
or in the rulings of the Division of
Motor Vehicles.
Grant, who is in charge of the re
newal registration activities of the
Automobile Association, declared that
headlight certificates have no bearing
whatsoever upon renewal registration.
U. S. C. will have a new law school
building next fall.
