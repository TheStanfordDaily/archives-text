# CARDINAL SWIMMERS PLACE SECOND IN P. A. JUNIOR MEET
## 
### 
Stanford swimmers trailed into second
place with 5 points in the Pacific Associa
tion junior meet while the Olympic Club
easily took first place with 28 points by
picking up first places in all events. Uni
versity of California representatives came
third with 3 points while rep
resentatives were completely blanked.
In a hotly contested" match the Stan
ford freshman water poloists suppressed
the Olympic Club juniors 5 to 3. This
was the second clash of a' series of two
games, the first of which had been won by
the Winged "O" youngsters. â€¢
Carl Stevenson was easily tlie outstand
ing Cardinal performer of the evening,
being nosed out of .first place in the one
and hundred fifty yard backstroke event
by George Mitchell, Olympic Club per
former. Stevenson led the field until the
last fifty feet when Mitchell challenged
him and touched the bar with about' half
an inch to spare.
The remaining Stanford points were
picked up by third places brought by Klein
in the 500-yard free style event and Phil
Brookes in the hundred-yard free style.
Klein was the only Cardinal who was
bested by a Blue and Gold performer,
namely Classen, who placed second scor
ing all of the U. C. points.
Water Polo Men Show Power.
Prowess was uncorked by the Stanford
water polo men when after making up
for a poor start they literally played rings
around the Olympic boys. LcFibre at
goal guard was erratic in the first half let
ting slip two that should have been blocked
but he came back strong in the final period
and to all intent's and purposes has
cinched the position for this season.
Ed Luster playing sprint was the main
cog in the Cardinal offensive. Despite
the fact that he was out of the pool for
personals during a part of the second half
he had so bolstered up the attack that the
game was on ice for the babes.
The line-up used by Coach Ernie Brand
sten for Friday's game included Vanden
Akker and Andrews who between them
contributed three points for the victors.
Maltby at center back played a strong
game and when the spray of battle cleared
had given two points to his team. Guards
were Simms and Hollingsworth.
Probable Regulars Used.
This line-up will probably be the one
which Brandsten will use for the games
with California freshmen although it is, of
course,."subject to change without notice."
Several reserves of ability are available
and any of them may be given a chance
in a starting line-up.
