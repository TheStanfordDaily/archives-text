Edd Roush, one of baseball's greatest outfielders, struck out twice in the
sixth inning of the game of July 22, 1916? It isn't often that a man gets a
chance to bat more than once in one inning, and to strike out twice is a record.
It would be even more incredible if Edd should do it today. Roush batfed only
.267 in 1916, but his average has been over .320 every year since then. Only
two other National League players have achieved the doubtful honor of
striking out twice in one inning.
John Ball, who won the British Amateur Golf Championship eight times, won
a bet in 1907 by going around the Hoylake course in a dense fog, under 90, and
in less than two and a quarter hours? The veteran used a black ball, which
he was fortunate in not losing, went around in 81, and in less than the stated
time. If you know those British fogs, you'll appreciate what a stunt that was.
Mrs. Adolph Topperwein smashed 491 out of 500 clay tagets in an hour and
fifteen minutes, thus setting a record for endurance and accuracy? Mrs.
Topperwein did this stunt last year at San Antonio, Texas.
