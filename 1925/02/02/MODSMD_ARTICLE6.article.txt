# PRACTICE SERIES OF WOMEN'S BASKETBALL BEGINS TOMORROW
## 
### 
The first size-up of material in fresh
man women's basketball squads will be
made when the first-year women meet the
seniors in the first of the practice game
series, at 4 o'clock tomorrow on the Roble
field.
Many substitutions will be made during
the game, especially in the little-known
freshman team. The class of '28 appears
to fcave strong athletic interests, for
enough women have turned out to make
three teams, and possibly a fourth. The
material is good, but there has not been
enough action yet for the coming stars to
be apparent; the first and second teams
have been about equal, as have the third
and fourth, according to Mrs. Dudley De-
Groot, one of the freshman coaches.
The seniors are missing three of their
first team players, having a small squad
this year. Mabel McCanse, a graduate, is
filling the forward position left by Doris
Harter, and works well with Gracc Judd,
who was an all-star substitute last year.
| Edith Rossarini will probably start in the
side center position left by the absence of
! Emeline Williams, while Mildred Bur
lingame is in line for the position of jump
ing center, played by Katherine McCahan
last year. Many substitutions will be
] made in the senior line-up also.
The schedule for the Vest of the practice
i games is as follows: February 4, juniors
vs. sophomores; February 10, sophomores
vs. seniors; February 11, juniors vs.
I freshmen; February 17, juniors vs. sen
! inrs; February 18, sophomores vs. fresh
