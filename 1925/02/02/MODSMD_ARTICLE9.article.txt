# ENCINA 1E QUINTET BEATS PHI PSIS IN RAGGED CAGE TILT
## 
### 
Encina IE upset predictions in intra
mural basketball by overturning the Phi
Kappa Psi five 14 to 11 in a rather slow
game. Sigma Nu toppled Los Arcos over
27 to 7 in a hollow victory.
In the first game the Phi Psis bungled
innumerable chances to score and allowed
Dobson of the freshmen to drop in too
many shots. The first half ended with
the row men trailing 6 to 4. The fresh
men worked well when they were under
the basket and started off with a lead over
the Phi Psi squad.
With the second half the Encina team
opened up with a couple of scores by Dob
son and Carlsmith. Despite better team
work the Phi Psis were not able to find
the hoop and were not functioning fast'
enough to stop Encina's rushes. Good foul
shooting by Wittenburg and Walker
brought the Phi Psis up to the short end
of a 14 to 11 score at the final whistle.
Sigma Nu disposed of Los Arcos with
great ease. Although they missed many
shots under the goal Todd scored five field
goals and Bragg caged three to help bring
the total to 27 to 7 for the club team.
Tomorrow's games are: Kappa Alpha
vs. Phi Delta Theta, Kappa Sigma vs. Phi
Kappa Sigma, Encina 4E vs. Alpha Sigma
Phi, Breakers vs. Encina 2W, Alpha Tau
Omega vs. Branner 11, Japanese Club vs.
Phi Gamma Delta.
C. W. Davis in charge of intramural
athletics, urges all teams to play in the
remaining rounds of play regardless, of
their standing in the league, as the chief
purpose of the tournament is to get more
men out and give them a chance to play.

the third round of play is as follows:

Encina IE upset predictions in intra
mural basketball by overturning the Phi
Kappa Psi five 14 to 11 in a rather slow
game. Sigma Nu toppled Los Arcos over
27 to 7 in a hollow victory.
In the first game the Phi Psis bungled
innumerable chances to score and allowed
Dobson of the freshmen to drop in too
many shots. The first half ended with
the row men trailing 6 to 4. The fresh
men worked well when they were under
the basket and started off with a lead over
the Phi Psi squad.
With the second half the Encina team
opened up with a couple of scores by Dob
son and Carlsmith. Despite better team
work the Phi Psis were not able to find
the hoop and were not functioning fast'
enough to stop Encina's rushes. Good foul
shooting by Wittenburg and Walker
brought the Phi Psis up to the short end
of a 14 to 11 score at the final whistle.
Sigma Nu disposed of Los Arcos with
great ease. Although they missed many
shots under the goal Todd scored five field
goals and Bragg caged three to help bring
the total to 27 to 7 for the club team.
Tomorrow's games are: Kappa Alpha
vs. Phi Delta Theta, Kappa Sigma vs. Phi
Kappa Sigma, Encina 4E vs. Alpha Sigma
Phi, Breakers vs. Encina 2W, Alpha Tau
Omega vs. Branner 11, Japanese Club vs.

C. W. Davis in charge of intramural
athletics, urges all teams to play in the
remaining rounds of play regardless, of
their standing in the league, as the chief
purpose of the tournament is to get more

Encina IE upset predictions in intra
mural basketball by overturning the Phi
Kappa Psi five 14 to 11 in a rather slow
game. Sigma Nu toppled Los Arcos over
27 to 7 in a hollow victory.
In the first game the Phi Psis bungled
innumerable chances to score and allowed
Dobson of the freshmen to drop in too
many shots. The first half ended with
the row men trailing 6 to 4. The fresh
men worked well when they were under
the basket and started off with a lead over
the Phi Psi squad.
With the second half the Encina team
opened up with a couple of scores by Dob
son and Carlsmith. Despite better team
work the Phi Psis were not able to find
the hoop and were not functioning fast'
enough to stop Encina's rushes. Good foul
shooting by Wittenburg and Walker
brought the Phi Psis up to the short end
of a 14 to 11 score at the final whistle.
Sigma Nu disposed of Los Arcos with
great ease. Although they missed many
shots under the goal Todd scored five field
goals and Bragg caged three to help bring
the total to 27 to 7 for the club team.
Tomorrow's games are: Kappa Alpha
vs. Phi Delta Theta, Kappa Sigma vs. Phi
Kappa Sigma, Encina 4E vs. Alpha Sigma
Phi, Breakers vs. Encina 2W, Alpha Tau
Omega vs. Branner 11, Japanese Club vs.
Phi Gamma Delta.
C. W. Davis in charge of intramural
athletics, urges all teams to play in the
remaining rounds of play regardless, of
their standing in the league, as the chief
purpose of the tournament is to get more
men out and give them a chance to play.
