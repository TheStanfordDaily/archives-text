# TWO POSITIONS FILLED FOR 1927 QUAD STAFF
## 
### 
Two positions on the 1927 Quad staff
were filled yesterday by the editor,
Basil McGann, when he named Allene
Thorpe for the office of Wopien's
Manager and Marjorie Allen to fill the
position of Women's Editor. Competi
tion for berths on the Quad staff is
now in progress, for the annual publica
tion has been changed from one of
junior classes to one of senior classes.
Consent of Pedro J. Lemos to do six
full-color oil paintings, reproductions
of which will be used as division pages,
was received some time ago.
