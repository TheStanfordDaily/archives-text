# YEARLING DIAMOND STARS WILL MEET PALO ALTO SQUAD
## 
### 
The pick-up baseball team from Palo
Alto which was defeated by the year
ling nine last week will be given an
opportunity for reyenge on the fresh
man diamond tomorrow afternoon at
3:30.
The Palo Alto team is composed
largely of San Jose and Oakland win
ter league players. Fortune, who did
their mound work, is a Portland re
cruit, but he proved powerless against
the heavy slugging of the freshmen.
Although last week's game was the
first of the season, the babes presented
a smooth-working aggregation. They
took the lead at the beginning of the
contest, and at no time were they en
dangered by the townsmen. The final
score was 8 to 4 V
Reliable Pitchers
Philippi, who occupied the mound
for the first six innings, demonstrated
that he is worthy of all the praise that
was given him before the season
opened. He held the visitors well in
hand, allowing them only a few scat
tered hits. Sobieski, who relieved
Philippi, wiped away any idea that
Hunt only had one good twirler.
Syplier behind the plate is one of
the reliables of the squad. Very few
get past him, and, besides, he is capa
ble of directing the team from the
most advantageous place, and of hit
ting at the time when a hit is most
needed.
Besides Sypher, Hunt has four other
powerful and consistent batters. They
are Maguire in center field, Garibaldi
at second, Sims in right field, and Nis
sen in left. All of these men connected
with the sphere at frequent and op
portune moments last week.
At short the freshmen have Busch
who, although he lacks experience,
