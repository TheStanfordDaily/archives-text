# CARDS TROUNCE S.B.U.C. 23 TO 10 IN ONE-SIDED UNINTERESTING CONTEST
## SHIPKEY BROTHERS STAR Stanford Leads First Half 15 To 3; Visitors Fail To Show Strength 
### 
Stanford defeated the Southern
Branch quintet 23 to 10 in a one-sided
game last uight in the Stanford
pavilion.
The Southerners failed to live up to
the class displayed against the Card
varsity in Los Angeles and played a
losing game throughout.
Stanford started scoring early in the
proceedings when Harry Shipkey tal
lied three points on a field goal and a
foul shot which occurred as Shipkey
sunk the first goal.
Both Shipkey brothers, Harry and
Ted, were the outstanding men on
the squad. Harry Shipkey, especially,
showed an improvement in floor work
and came through with five points,
Ted Shipkey and Nelson David were
also tied with the older Shipkey with
five markers.
Stanford led at the end of the first
half, 15 to 3.
The Cards never let up once during
the whole game, maintaining a stiff
defense pressing with a well-directed
offense.
Goertz of the visitors managed to
score five points for Southern Branch,
half of the total number, for the vis*
itors.
The game was slow from beginning
to end, but it cast no reflection on
the Cardinal style of play. The reason
for the poor showing made by the
visitors was due, probably, to the tight
five-man defense of Stanford and not
lay claim to, and Dobson at center is
also a consistent player. Aydelotte and
Bragg did well for Sigma Nu.
Ability to find the basket enabled
Phi Kappa Psi to defeat the Panthers
21 to 10. Both teams were fairly strong
in the passing department, but the
Panthers were caught on an off day
as far as basket-shooting is concerned,
as a majority of their shots bounced
back off the ring instead of falling
through for points. Knox, Wittenberg,
Wisely, and McCallister rolled up big
totals for the Phi Psis. Kellogg and
Lentz starred for the Panthers. Phi
Psi was ahead 8 to 4 at half time.
The following games are scheduled
tomorrow: Theta Xi vs. Beta Theta
Pi, 4:15; Delta Upsilon vs. Delta
Kappa Epsilon, 4:50; Sigma Chi vs.
Eneina Basement, 7:15; Alpha Kappa
