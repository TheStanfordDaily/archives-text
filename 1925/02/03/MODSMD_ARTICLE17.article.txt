# YELL LEADING TRIALS WILL BE CLOSED TO 1927 MEN THURSDAY
## 
### 
Sophomores are now trying out for
yell leader and are being put through
practice three times a week under the
direction of "Dutch" McCallister, Ev
Young, and Ray Boren.
All sophomores interested may still
sign up at 3 o'clock on Wednesday
afternoon and 4 o'clock Thursday af
ternoon in the pavilion. The lists will
be closed at the end of this time.
Throughout the next two months
these tryoutees will have opportuni
ties to demonstrate their ability at
various rallies and games. About six
weeks before spring elections the
Rally Committee will cut the squad
to six.
These six candidates will then be
put before the student body for a final
choice for next year's assistant yell
leader. At the same time, either Ray
Boren or Ev Young will be chosen
yell leader for the following year.
At present there are about ten sec
ond-year men working out for the job.
The Rally Committee has expressed a
desire to see about ten or fifteen more
tryoutees sign up for this job. The
committee has promised that in the
final choice of the six candidates, poli
tics will play no part as has been
claimed in past years.
