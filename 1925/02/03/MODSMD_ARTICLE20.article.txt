# What Is an Educated Man?

### 
Ramsay McDonald joined a group of "old students" of a working
men's college at supper in* London a few nights ago, and discussed with his
sometime comrades the real meaning of education and the definition of the
"educated man." Certainly, said this man who sat in the seat of Gladstone,
the educated man is not a "learned man." By this is meant that he is not
necessarily educated because he is learned. Nor is he an educated man
simply because he is a university man, added this son of a farm laborer,
who was thrilled last July when the University of Glasgow gave him its
degree, the greatest of prizes in the eyes of a Scotchman. A man may be
educated for a' that and a' that.
Here is the educated man, according to the former Prime Minister:
The educated man is a man with certain subtle spiritual qualities
which make him calm in adversity, happy when alone, just in his
dealings, rational and sane in the fullest meaning of that word in all
the affairs of his life.
Such a man may be as learned as Aristotle, or he may, as Mr. Mac-
Donald said, have difficulty in signii% his own name. He may be back in
the country somewhere, singing the old folksongs, or talking about his
sheep and his dogs, or quoting Burns. This is defining education not in
ternis of "counts" afhd "credit" courses, of "majors" and "minors," nor in
professional or other vocational achievements, but in simple spiritual and
intellectual values. President Hopkins of Dartmouth, in an address on
the relation of college and life before the Harvard students last month, said
that the poorest definition ever given of higher education was that of an
ancient Dean of Christ Church College, who, in enumerating what he con
sidered its advantages to a student said :
First, that he may be able to read the Scriptures in the original
text; second, that he may be entitled to a proper contempt for all
who cannot; and third, that he may be able to earn a larger emolu
ment than his neighbor.
If other subjects be substituted for the Scriptures, and a like contempt
for those who are ignorant of such particular subjects, these advantages
are, as President Hopkins hints, not so far away from what is in the minds
of men today. His own definition of an educated man—who is qualified
for leadership—might well be put beside Ramsay Mac Donald's:
Such a man must have been humble in the presence of great
minds and great souls, must have been simple in contacts with his
fellows, and must have been indefatigable in his desire to cultivate
and to maintain the power of his mind and to accumulate that
knowledge which makes up the data of accurate reasoning.
One is on the way to being an educated man and to the mastery of all
things when in such attitude and industry he has, as Mac Donald's "Domsie"
said, mastered one thing.—New York Times.
