# Junior Women to Meet Sophomores Tomorrow
## 
### 
The junior women will meet the
Bophomores in a practice hoop game,
the first for both squads, at 4 o'clock
tomorrow on the Itoble field.
The junior women had a strong team
last year, which remains practically
intact this year. Their squad, however,
is small, numbering only ten. Of these,
Aileen Burks and Millison Hardy were
named for all-star last year.
The sophomores have not been so
fortunate in keeping their experienced
players. They have lost a guard, a for
ward. and a side center, two of whom
were all-star players. The practice
game will help to determine who will
fill these places.
