Stephen Leacock says, "As yet the
best universities refuse to teach Hair
cuting, Fishing, and -Undertaking. But
they are drifting nearer and nearer to

"Centuries ago colleges were found
ed to prepare people to die; then they
decided to prepare people to live; now
the idea is to prepare people to make
a living."
Why all the fuss about "life"? It gives
back exactly as much as is put into it.
If there were any institution that could
teach that fact, colleges, or churches,
or what-not, all would be well.
But —how many people can you
count who are madly clutching their
few miserable possessions, material or
intellectual (and most of those God
given), to their bosoms lest someone
besides themselves should chance upon
a little benefit from them? "College"
will never eradicate that.

But, after all, no man's thinking is
better than his information.

Galilio appended this to all his astro
nomical writings: "Whatever I say
must be taken merely as a mathe
matical hypothesis and must not be
held to commit the writer, or allowed
to influence the reader in any way."
We sympathize with Galilio.

With Mr. Woodruff we firmly be
lieve that if you cawn't make the world
go 'round you, why, then you must go
'round the world . . .
