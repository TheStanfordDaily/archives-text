"Captain Blood" —Varsity.
If you have not seen the "Sea Hawk"
you will probably enjoy "Captain
Blood." If you have, the comparison is
likely to spoil your evening.
J. Warren Kerrigan may have hair
on his chest. We doubt it. At any rate
he is not a strong masculine type, and
he falls far short of living up to the
gory title of Sabatini's hero. After a
man has gone through life until the
age of maturity under the guise of a
name parted in the middle, it is a
strain on the imagination to call him
Captain Blood.
The picture is replete with sea fights
which are rather well filmed (though
not as well as those in the Sea Hawk),
and as far as that goes, all the effects
created by the director are good.
"The Mine With the Iron Door"—
Stanford —We have not seen this spec
tacle, dear reader, and furthermore
that isn't the half of it. Harold Bell
Wright is responsible for the story,
and whenever a producer uses Mr.
Wright's name for advertising matter
there is something rotten in the King
dom of Denmark.
We have received advance publicity
stating that 685 people read Harold
Bell Wright's novels every hour. This
is news to us. We had heretofore be
lieved the rate to be one every minute.
—S. O'D.
