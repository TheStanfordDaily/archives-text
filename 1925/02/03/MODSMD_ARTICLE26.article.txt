# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT
## 
### 
The Editor —Sir:
The winds of freedom blow! All men
living in the dormitories shall be com
pelled to eat in the University dining
halls after next quarter.
There is some object in directing a
student's studies in the lower division;
there are some admittedly beneficial!
studies. But what is the object of
directing a student's eating? There are
no menus which everyone will acfmit
to be correct. If you have ever eaten !
in the dining halls, you know that you
have to eat what is served or nothing
at all.
I have in my hand several of the
menus of Encina dining hall, which I
have submitted to a well-known doctor j
and dietitian, and which 1 have com
pared with the advice of numerous
others. In every case there is a very
obvious disagreement in some way or
other. Why, then, should the Univer
sity put such a price on the living up
to one's individual ideas on the sub
ject? If I think that I am better off
when I eat no breakfast, why should I
be made to pay for it? And if I want
to spend the money thus saved, and •
more, on bettering my dinners and
suppers, why can I not do i£? Does j
everyone have to eat at thirty dollars j
a month just because the majority j
does?
I hope that this thing will be satis-1
factorily settled.
Sincerely,
STERLING BECKWITH.
