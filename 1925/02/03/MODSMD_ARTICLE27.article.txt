# STRENGTH

### FEG MURRAY, '16 
"Strength" is a peculiar word. Can
any of you cross-word puzzle fans
think of another eight-letter word with
only one vowel? The seven consonants
give the word the very ruggedness and
power which it signifies. For experi
ment I grouped eight champions—one
from each of the most prominent
sports—whose first names begin with
the letters that spell the word
"strength."
Sullivan, Thorpe, Ruth, Extermin
ator, Nurmi, Gotch, Tilden, and Hagen

form an unbeatable combination.
Boxing, Football, Baseball, Horse
racing, Track, Wrestling, Tennis, and
Golf, each gives a champion in whose
success strength has played a most
important part. True, Nurmi is noted
for his running form, but without his
strength of hips and legs he would
never break any records.
Other champions of great strength
—to go on grouping the names by
letters only—are Tom Sharkey, the
fighting sailor from Ireland, and San

clow, considered by many the strongest
man who ever lived. Earl Thomson,
j world's champion hurdler, is a giant
5 among men, but not so prominent as
k Thorpe or Tilden. Two other strong
j R's are Pat Ryan, who holds the
g world's record for throwing the ham
j mer, and Norman Ross, easily the
most powerful of all swimming cham
pions. E gives us Epinard and Gertrude
i Ederle, strongest of all girl swimmers,
ir
3 Art Nehf's strong heart and muscu
lar left arm place him among the

strongest of the N's.
Among the G's are "Red" Grange
and Tom Gibbons; add Gene Tunney
to the list of T's, and now we come to
the strongest group of all, the H's.
Besides Hagen, there is Hornsby,
whose whipcord muscles have helped
him lead his league in batting for five
years. Three of football's strongest
were Heffelfinger, Hart, and Heston,
while Houser, Hartranft, and Hills are
the world's best shot-putters. And
don't forget Hackenschmidt, the Rus
sian Lion!
