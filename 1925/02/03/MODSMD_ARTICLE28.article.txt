# HOBBIES OF THE FACULTY

### PROFESSOR HULME By Hulda Hoover 
"My favorite occupation pursued for
the amusement it affords? My hobby?
Well, perhaps it is serendipity," said
Professor Edwin M. Hulme of the His
tory department. "I like to discover,
by accident or by some unusual infre
quent access of sagacity, things I have
never been in quest of. It is more
amusing than solving cross-word puz
zles."
Anthropology is another of Professor
Hulme's hobbies. Hulme says that the
story of man's struggle is a fascinat
ing one and that its teachings are
encouraging. "This hobby has often
taken me on a backward journey of a
quarter of a million years. It was in
those distant times that I came upon
the first of all the mother-in-law
steries. It is this:

'As a cave man was gnawing at a
bone one morning his wife rushed in
yelling: "Quick! Get your club! Quick!
Quick!" "What's wrong?" growled the
cave man. "Saber-tooth tiger chasing
mother," gasped the woman breath
lessly. "Oh shucks!" said the cave
man, "what do I care what happens to
a saber-tooth tiger'."
Hulme also has a hobby which car
ries him far in the opposite direction
-â€”far into the future. It is music. "I
like all forms of music, even the well
worn melodies of Italian Grand Opera,"
he says. "I have been thrilled deeply
by seeing a little girl dancing on the
pavement of a London street, in the
shade of a bedraggled pine tree, to a
faded opera tune, played on a hurdy
gurdy."
