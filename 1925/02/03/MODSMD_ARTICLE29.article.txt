# NEW MEN FIGHT TO MAKE POSITIONS ON 1925 TRACK SQUAD
## 
### 
Twelve track men who placed last year
in the Big Meet are missing from the 1925
squad. The absent ones are : Hale, Storie,
Mcintosh, Mixon, Covcrly, Elliott, Boles,
Anderson, Ludeke, Scofield, and Dennis.
They were responsible for 30 of Stan
ford's 84 points against California. Can
last year's freshmen, and transfers make
up this deficiency of 30 tallies?
"Biff" Hoffman was high point man
for the 1927 squad with a total of two
firsts and a second in the encounter with
the Blue and Gold first-year men. His
work is in the weights and he can be
counted upon for at least 5 points in his
three strong man events. While Hoffman
is not registered in college this quarter, he
will be hack in the Spring and will be
eligible for the California meet.
West, Crookshank Hurdles.
In the hurdles Clarence West and
Miles Crookshank should gather a few
points to add to the grand total. West
was captain of last year's freshman team,
while Crookshank is a transfer.
Tom Work proved the sensation of the
little Big Meet last season when he won
the high jump event from Hampton, the
Bear's ace. Hampton was doped to win
easily, but the Stanford babe out-jumped
him the day of the meet. Again this
season Hampton is given the preference
over Work, but the latter may duplicate
his last year's performance in the Big
Meet this season. At any rate Work is
sure of a second which means 3 more
points for Stanford.
Sid Meeks is expected to place in the
broad jump this year. Meeks is a prom
ising sophomore, and is a consistent 21-

foot juniper. Ted Shipkey may add one
more spare point to the scorc by a place
in the javelin throw.
1927 Sprinters Work.
season's freshmen sprinters may
collect a tally or two in the Big Meet.
Babcock, Adams, and McDouglal are
practicing hard in the attempt to take
Hale's place. Hyland and Garthwaite are
capable sprinters and may surprise the
dopsters by placing in either the 100 or
220-yard dashes.
Eugene Scofield is attempting to fill his
brother's shoes in the pule vault. With
Lloyd and Whistler to help him, Stanford
may score a few more points in this event.
Shermund has returned to college and
wil compete in the quarter-mile race
this year. Shermund was captain of
the 1925 freshman squad, but he has
not competed since then. He and Rich
mond, of the 1927 team, are capable of
taking Storie's and Van Judah's place
in the one-lap run.
The freshmen and transfers may not be
able to supply all of the missing 30
missing points, but only 14 additional
points are needed to win the meet. Last
season Stanford ran up a total of 84 tallies
when only 66 points were needed, so they
wasted a few counters. Everything seems
to point to the closest meet in years, with
just a little more red on the score board
than Blue and Gold.

able to supply all of the missing 30
missing points, but only 14 additional
points are needed to win the meet. Last
season Stanford ran up a total of 84 tallies
when only 66 points were needed, so they
wasted a few counters. Everything seems
to point to the closest meet in years, with
just a little more red on the score board
than Blue and Gold.
Twelve track men who placed last year
in the Big Meet are missing from the 1925
squad. The absent ones are : Hale, Storie,
Mcintosh, Mixon, Covcrly, Elliott, Boles,
Anderson, Ludeke, Scofield, and Dennis.
They were responsible for 30 of Stan
ford's 84 points against California. Can
last year's freshmen, and transfers make
up this deficiency of 30 tallies?
"Biff" Hoffman was high point man
for the 1927 squad with a total of two
firsts and a second in the encounter with
the Blue and Gold first-year men. His
work is in the weights and he can be
counted upon for at least 5 points in his
three strong man events. While Hoffman
is not registered in college this quarter, he
will be hack in the Spring and will be
eligible for the California meet.
West, Crookshank Hurdles.
In the hurdles Clarence West and
Miles Crookshank should gather a few
points to add to the grand total. West
was captain of last year's freshman team,
while Crookshank is a transfer.
Tom Work proved the sensation of the
little Big Meet last season when he won
the high jump event from Hampton, the
Bear's ace. Hampton was doped to win
easily, but the Stanford babe out-jumped
him the day of the meet. Again this
season Hampton is given the preference
over Work, but the latter may duplicate
his last year's performance in the Big
Meet this season. At any rate Work is
sure of a second which means 3 more
points for Stanford.
Sid Meeks is expected to place in the
broad jump this year. Meeks is a prom
ising sophomore, and is a consistent 21-

foot juniper. Ted Shipkey may add one
more spare point to the scorc by a place
in the javelin throw.
1927 Sprinters Work.
season's freshmen sprinters may
collect a tally or two in the Big Meet.
Babcock, Adams, and McDouglal are
practicing hard in the attempt to take
Hale's place. Hyland and Garthwaite are
capable sprinters and may surprise the
dopsters by placing in either the 100 or
220-yard dashes.
Eugene Scofield is attempting to fill his
brother's shoes in the pule vault. With
Lloyd and Whistler to help him, Stanford
may score a few more points in this event.
Shermund has returned to college and
wil compete in the quarter-mile race
this year. Shermund was captain of
the 1925 freshman squad, but he has
not competed since then. He and Rich
mond, of the 1927 team, are capable of
taking Storie's and Van Judah's place
in the one-lap run.
