# Lake Not Yet Assured But Puddle Gives Hope
## 
### 
Roble women on the third floor are
again enjoying a marine view, for a
little water has leaked into the lake,
making a puddle that surrounds the
mound in the center of the bed.
The lake, however, is far from as
sured. Stanford's supply is not being
delivered at a regular rate, but only
according to the rains. Unless the
rains this month are enough to add
to it, the present hope may dry up as
did its predecessors. In other words, it
is not yet time to "let the lake in."
