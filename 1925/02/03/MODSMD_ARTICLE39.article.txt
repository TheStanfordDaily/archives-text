vote is no reason why they should be
lieve themselves to have equal intelli
gence," said Dr. Wilbur in a talk on
"Man as a Social Animal" before the
Education Club last evening.
"We must educate enough of our
citizens as to the actual l'acts of life
to do away with superstition." con
tinued Dr. Wilbur. "People must be
taught to recognize universal laws, and
to respect experts. The period of pre
paration for life increases as life be
comes more complex. It is now twenty
five years before an individual can take
his place among the forty per cent
which supports the other sixty per
cent of the world's population."
