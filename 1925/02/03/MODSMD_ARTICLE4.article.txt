# DELTA TAU DELTA SURPRISES BY WIN OVER THETA CHI'S
## 
### 
Delta Tau Delta furnished one of
i the biggest surprises of the intramural
J series yesterday by decisively wallop
j ing the undefeated Theta Chi quintet
14 to 4. El Toro, which had also come
through its schedule unscathed, fell
before Encina 3E 12 to 10. As a result
of these two games, Theta Chi, for
merly the favorite to cop the league
5 championship, is now a triple tie
with Encina 3E and El Toro for lead
ing honors.
Results of the other games are as
follows: Delta Cty 8, Los Arcos 3;
Encina IE 18, Sigma Nu 5; Phi Kappa
Psi 21, Panthers 10; Phi Sigma Kappa
2, Encina 4E 0 (won by default).
The Delts completely outclassed
Theta Chi, and led 6 to 2 at the half.
The losers failed to exhibit the co
ordination they have shown previously
and had a poor day at the basket. Col
lett and Morrison enabled the Delta
Taus to present the strongest offense
they have displayed to date. Dice and
Safyer contributed the sole tallies for
Theta Chi.
Encina 3E Wins
El Toro and Encina 3E put on the
closest battle of the day, the freshmen
winning 12 to 10. Toro failed to regis
ter a very la'rge proportion of its tries
at the bucket, while Encina was able
to put up a stiff defense due to its
weight advantage. The combination of
Altaft'er, Hill, and Stewart worked to
advantage for the babes. Rupe and
Wright were the whole works for El
Toro. Encina led 8 to 5 at the half.
Delta Chi downed Los Arcos 8 to 3
in a slow contest, neither team display
ing exceptionally good teamwork or
goal shooting. Los Arcos lost out
chiefly because of atrocious passing.
The fraternity men cashed in on only
a small percentage of tl\eir shots,
which was nevertheless sufficient to
cinch the game. Delta Chi led 4 to 3
at the half. Sandys, Hood, and Rowles
did the scoring for the winners, while
Williams and Hamilton performed
creditably for Los Arcos.
Sigma Nu Swamped

Exhibiting speed and precision, En
cina IE swamped Sigma Nu under an
18 to 5 score. This was Encina's fourth
straight triumph, and practically as
sures the babes the title in League 4,
as every other team in the league has
lost at least one game. Cook and Carl
smith are about as fast a pair of
forwards as any intramural outfit can
promises to be one of the stars of the
squad. He had two errors chalked
against him in the last game, but he
more than made up for them by catch
ing a hot liner and by executing a
perfect double play.
Thompson at first and Price at third
covered their respective territories ad
mirably. Both of these men show a
world of improvement over their pre
season form.

advantage for the babes. Rupe and
Wright were the whole works for El
Toro. Encina led 8 to 5 at the half.
Delta Chi downed Los Arcos 8 to 3
in a slow contest, neither team display
ing exceptionally good teamwork or
goal shooting. Los Arcos lost out
chiefly because of atrocious passing.
The fraternity men cashed in on only
a small percentage of tl\eir shots,
which was nevertheless sufficient to
cinch the game. Delta Chi led 4 to 3
at the half. Sandys, Hood, and Rowles
did the scoring for the winners, while
Williams and Hamilton performed
creditably for Los Arcos.
Sigma Nu Swamped
郊말
Exhibiting speed and precision, En
cina IE swamped Sigma Nu under an
18 to 5 score. This was Encina's fourth
straight triumph, and practically as
sures the babes the title in League 4,
as every other team in the league has
lost at least one game. Cook and Carl
smith are about as fast a pair of
forwards as any intramural outfit can
promises to be one of the stars of the
squad. He had two errors chalked
against him in the last game, but he
more than made up for them by catch
ing a hot liner and by executing a
perfect double play.
Thompson at first and Price at third
covered their respective territories ad
mirably. Both of these men show a
world of improvement over their pre
season form.
Delta Tau Delta furnished one of
i the biggest surprises of the intramural
J series yesterday by decisively wallop
j ing the undefeated Theta Chi quintet
14 to 4. El Toro, which had also come
through its schedule unscathed, fell
before Encina 3E 12 to 10. As a result
of these two games, Theta Chi, for
merly the favorite to cop the league
5 championship, is now a triple tie
with Encina 3E and El Toro for lead
ing honors.
Results of the other games are as
follows: Delta Cty 8, Los Arcos 3;
Encina IE 18, Sigma Nu 5; Phi Kappa
Psi 21, Panthers 10; Phi Sigma Kappa
2, Encina 4E 0 (won by default).
The Delts completely outclassed
Theta Chi, and led 6 to 2 at the half.
The losers failed to exhibit the co
ordination they have shown previously
and had a poor day at the basket. Col
lett and Morrison enabled the Delta
Taus to present the strongest offense
they have displayed to date. Dice and
Safyer contributed the sole tallies for
Theta Chi.
Encina 3E Wins
El Toro and Encina 3E put on the
closest battle of the day, the freshmen
winning 12 to 10. Toro failed to regis
ter a very la'rge proportion of its tries
at the bucket, while Encina was able
to put up a stiff defense due to its
weight advantage. The combination of
Altaft'er, Hill, and Stewart worked to
advantage for the babes. Rupe and
Wright were the whole works for El
Toro. Encina led 8 to 5 at the half.
Delta Chi downed Los Arcos 8 to 3
in a slow contest, neither team display
