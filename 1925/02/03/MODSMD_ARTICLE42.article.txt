# FRESHMAN TENNIS STARS FROM MANY PARTS OF COUNTRY
## 
### 
Tennis stars from prep schools all
over the country are to be found on
the freshman squad ranking list. Judg
ing from the material and the showing
so far displayed, there is every reason
to believe that the team will give the
California babes more than a good run
for their money in the annual match
on April 11.
Heading the freshman squad is Alan
Herrington who presents a formidable
record not only as a high school player
but in the National Junior rating as
well, Last year he played first singles
for Hollywood High School and was
rated first among Southern California
prep school During that year
he played in various eastern tourna
ments and was named as the third
best junior player in the country.
Second on the squad is Ralph Mc-
Elvenny who also played in the Na
tionals last year and with his partner
is champion of the open doubles for
the inter-mountain section. Thomas,
who ran into the finals of the open
singles tournament held last quarter,
follows in number three. He played
first singles for Los Angeles High
School and was considered one of the
three best high school players in the
southern part of the state.
The names of Castellanos and Faulk
ner follow in order, the first having
been captain and first man for Har
vard Military School, and the second
having played in numerous inter-club
tournaments in Pittsburg. Ballin, Mans
field, Price, Kengel, and Duval com
plete the list of the first ten ranking.
All were high school stars.
Plahs are under way to have a num
ber of practice matches in prepara
tion for the California tournament.
