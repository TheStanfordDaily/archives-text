# Old Training Quarters Will Become Permanent Home of Stanford Band
## 
### 
The Stanford band is to have per
manent headquarters at last. The old
training house, located at the old foot
ball field, is being moved up next to
the present military offices where it
will be remodeled and used for prac
tice purposes for the band.
This building was abandoned when
the stadium was completed, and two
years ago it was turned over to the
Military department. After some delay
permission was granted by the Univer
sity and Military department to have
it moved and fitted up into a home for
the band. The building will be placed
near the tennis courts and is to face
Toyon hall.
This is being financed jointly by the
University and Associated Students.
