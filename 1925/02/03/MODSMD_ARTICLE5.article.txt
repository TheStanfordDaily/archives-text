# RAM'S HEAD SHOW FOR 1925 WILL SURPASS ALL PREVIOUS EFFORTS
## 
### 
Colorful sets, a strong dramatic plot,
(lance numbers with real Russian at
mosphere, and music with tuneful and
haunting strains will bo the high-lights
of the 1925 Ram's Head production
which Director Dave Mannoccir is
rounding into shape for presentation
a week from Friday night.
The show this year, as anounced at
the beginning of the quarter, will not
be along the same lines as former
Ram's Head productions. Instead of
the usual burlesque there will be a
serious plot, real acting, and dance
numbers that promise to astound
everyone. Mrs. H. Lanz, wife of Pro
fessor Lanz, who was formerly in the
Imperial Russian Ballet, is in charge
of the chorus and dancing. The diffi
cult Russian style of dancing has sev
eral proficient exponents in the stu
dent body, and the campus is due for
a distinct surprise on February 13.
Ram's Head Society, in departing
from the usual type of show, is swing
ing into line with the famous Prince
ton Triangle Club, and other Eastern
collegiate organizations composed ex
clusively of men who put on musical
shows with real plots, tuneful music,
and good acting. This type of show is
new to the Pacific Coast, and Ram's
Head is to be congratulated in break
ing away from tradition and establish
ing a precedent which will increase

the fame of the Stanford stage.
The tentative title for this year's
show is "The Devil's Daughter," and
the plot concerns the hanging of an
innocent man and the theft of a prized
animal from the estate of a Russian
nobleman. Dan Evans and Mike Ely,
the authors, have written into the play
a number of dramatic situations which
will keep the audience on its seat-edge
throughout a great deal of the action.
The lines are clever, and the satire
upon the usual Russian drama is exe
cuted with convincing realism.
Seats are expected to be almost
completely sold out at the first public
sale, so the management requests
everyone to remember that next Tues
day will be the regular campus seat
sale. Ram's Head shows in the past
have had to hang out the Standing-
Room-Only sign, and this year the de
mand is expected to be even greater.
