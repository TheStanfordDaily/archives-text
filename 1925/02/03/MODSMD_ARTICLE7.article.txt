Gluck's overture to his opera, "Iphi
genia in Aulis," and Beethoven's over
ture, "Leonore" No. 3, are considered
two great examples of this type of
classical music. These overtures are
works independent of the opera for
which they were written and resemble
the sonata or symphony.
Will Play Hebrew Melody
Haydn's Symphony in G Minor is
peculiarly known as "The Surprise
Symphony" because of the sudden for
tissimo chord from the full orchestra
which is played in the middle of a slow
Andante.
In place of "Through the Looking
Glass" Alfred Hertz will offer an ar
rangement of the traditional Hebrew
melody, "Kol Nidrei," by Max Bruch.
Walter Ferner, first 'cellist of the or
chestra, will be the soloist in this
piece.
Strauss Piece Is Finale
"Don Juan," a symphonic poem by
Richard Strauss, one of the greatest
of living composers, has been chosen
as the finale. This is considered one
of the most dramatic and brilliant or
chestral masterpieces.
