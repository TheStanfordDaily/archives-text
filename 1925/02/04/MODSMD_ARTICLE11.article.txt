# CARD-BEAR COURT SERIES TO OPEN ON SATURDAY
## Stanford Looms as Favorite in First Game with Bruin Quintet 
### David Meiklejohn 
Having successfully gone through
its preliminary season without a de
feat the Stanford five is a heavy
favorite to defeat the University of
California quintet when the two teams
meet in the pavilion next Saturday.
4 Stanford has the most imposing rec
ord but, nevertheless Andy Kerr, Card
inal basketball coach, does not believe
that this will make any difference in
the final showdown. Stanford basket
ball teams have gone through pre
liminary seasons 1 undefeated in past
years, only to be nosed out somewhere
in the series by a better California
team.
Cards Pass Well
One thing the Cards can boast of
this year is a strong substitute aggre
gation. Three good forwards, three
and four guards make it pos
sible for Kerr to employ almost any
tactics desirable. A rushing, passing
offensive is usual style, and he
substitutes his forwards, centers, and
running guards at will, always to keep
the ball on the move.
This style of play worked well
against the Nevada team which, in the
second game, gate Stanford a hard
fight. The Nevadans had no substitute,
asd the strain told in the last part of
the game, when Kerr rushed in a new
team and started overcoming a heavy
lead.
California Is Powerful
California to all appearances is us
ing a similar brand of passing. Ladar
and Holmes compare favorably with
any of the Stanford forwards, and
Belasco and Carver at guards have
been showing a great deal of strength
of latÂ£.
