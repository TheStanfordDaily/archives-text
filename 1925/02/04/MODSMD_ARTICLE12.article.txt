# VOTE GOES TO WETS WHEN OXFORD TEAM MEETS STANFORD, U. C.
## 
### 
Oxford University's debate team was 1
avenged last night for what amounted
to defeat at the hands of Stanford
speakers January 22. A San Francisco [
audience voted almost two to one
against prohibition after a contest be
tween the Britishers and a squad com- j
posed of two Stanford men and one '
California debater.
The question was: "Resolved, That:
this House is opposed to the principles !
of prohibition." The count showed-743
ballots against prohibition and 465 in
favor of it. Approximately 3000 people J
were in attendance, but a large per- ,
centage did not «vote. ,
Robert Littler and RobertfE. Lewis
of Stanford and Raymond Stanbury of
California argued for the "drvs" and ,
J. D. Woodruff, C. H. Hollis, and Mal
colm Mac Donald of Oxford for the |
"wets." Rabbi Patrick I. Newman of i
Temple Emanu-El presided. The civic
auditorium was the sceng o£ the con
test.
As in their appearance at Stanford,
Hollis and Woodruff emphasized heav- I
ilv, the argument that a man should be :
allowed to choose the method in which j
he will secure his own happiness, and i
depended for the most part on clever
ness and wit to carry them through. I
Hollis received perhaps a bigger ova
tion than that accorded to any other
speaker.
'Mac Donald dealt with the benefits of J
driyk as a means of social reform,
stating that intoxicants enabled the
poor man to forget his troubles and
should not be taken away until some
method is devised for removing his
poverty. His style was serious and
logical in contrast with that of his col
leagues, but he managed to put across
several brilliant bits of repartee.
While the ballots were being countejl
Mac Donald delivered an informal talk
on the political situation in England,
I placing particular emphasis on the
| conflict of the Labor and Conservative
I parties.
The Oxford men sailed for Hawaii
at noon today. After a short stay in
the islands they will proceed to China,
New Zealand, Australia, and Egypt,
and thence to England. If their present
plans are carried out they will arrive
home next summer after the longest
tour ever, made by a university debat
ing team.
