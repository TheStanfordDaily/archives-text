# Cashier Warns Campus; February 11 Is Set as Syllabus Payment Date
## 
### 
Rigid economy is advised by the
University Cashier for all students
who have syllabus fees to pq#-, which
iu to say all students. This little sug
gestion comes as a result of a deci
sion to collect the f#es 011 February
11, with but scant warning to enable
students to prepare for the shock.
The Cashier's office is a little behind
in mailing the bills, but fully intends
to collect them on time. This has ne
cessitated an advance notice to all who
are intending to "blow" this month's
allowance before February 11.
