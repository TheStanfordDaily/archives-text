# YEARLING QUINTET FACES SAN JOSE HIGH IN PAVILION
## One Combat Remains After Tonight's Before Bear Series Opens 
### 
The first-year basketball team faces
San Jose High School tonight in the
main event of the evening at the
pavilion.
This game will be the second of the
week. Monday night the babes de
j t'eated Oakland High and Saturday
i they will clash with the Livermore
| aggregation. After playing St. Vin
cent's High next Wednesday the fresh
men will be ready to go against the
Blue and Gold freshmen in Berkeley
on February 13.
Of the eight games played this sea
son, Coach "Husky" Hunt's charges
have dropped only one tilt and this
was to the Piedmont High School
team. Since that game the freshman
five has shown great improvement,
and only last Monday they defeated a
team that played a much better game
than Piedmont.
Vincenti and Crist have practically
earned the right' to first-string posi
tions by their past performances. This
combination works well together but
is sometimes replaced by Nye and
Moore. The latter two will no doubt
*get in in tonight's game, and may
even play against the California team,
but so far they have not been able to
combine speed and accuracy to equal
the first-string men.
Clark has been shifted from running
guard to center, but action has shown
that he works better at his former
position. Dennis, who has been play
ing at center, is back at running guard
and sometimes forward. Dennis seems
to be able to fill in at any of these
places with equal effect, and he is
sure of some position.
Biaggini has spent most of his time
taking care of the standing guard
position and at intervals has relin
quished to Mike Reynolds. Both of
these freshmen have a good directing
head for the defense and stand up well
under pressure.
