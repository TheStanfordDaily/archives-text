# RUSSIAN TONE DOMINATES RAM'S HEAD REHEARSALS
## 
### 
Shrill yips and yowls are emanating
I from the Assembly hall these evenings
for Ram's Head Society is preparing
its 1925 production for the edification
; of the campus a week from next Fri
day night. The strange noises referred
to are the refrains of the various
musical numbers, all of which have
the gusto and verve which character
; izes Russian songs.
The music will be distinctly different
from that of past years for every piece
I will have a Russian motif, and the i
tunes have a melodiousness which will
haunt the bearers. Fred "Chubby" Ty- 1
roler is in charge of the nufeical num-'
bers. and he has chosen about eight
pieces which he expects will prove to
be hits in the show.
Costumes will be colorful and ex- ;

pressive of the Russian maimer in
dress. Frank Basconib. a transfer from
Yale, is in charge, and has designed
all the costumes which are being made
to order in San Francisco. Long flow
ing robes, high velvet hats and big
boots will predominate in the general
scheme of <jostuming, which will aid in
preserving* the Russian atmosphere.
Finished Production Due
Both cast and chorus have worked
hard for the past, three weeks, and an
exceedingly finished production is due
for the boards on Friday the 13th of
February. Ram's Head Society be-
that this otherwise unlucky
date will prove a turning point for the
better in Ram's Head shows since this
year's production will be radically dif
ferent than those of other years. A
well-worked-out strongly dramatic plot,
dance numbers of originality and dis
tinction, and a cast of experienced
actors will all help to make the first
show under the new system an un
qualified success.
Only two large sets will be used in
the play, and both of these will be
designed and executed by Les Kiler,
who has created so many exceptional
settings for Stanford productions. The
first set will be in three parts, and
from there the action is carried to a
full stage view, a change which will
tax the ingenuity and resourcefulness
of Les Kiler and his assistants. The
second act shows the courtyard of a
Russian castle, and opportunity will
be given here for Kiler to display his
cleverness in depicting massiveness of
detail in a minimum of space.
The show was put together last Mon
day night, and the results showed that
this year's production is well along on
the way to a finished and successful
performance a week from next Friday.
