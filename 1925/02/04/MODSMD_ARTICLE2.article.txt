## 
### 
Encina 2W provided the big upset
yesterday in intramural basketball by
toppling the Breakers from their lone
position at the head of League 7 into
a three-cornered tie with the Japanese
Club and Branner II in a fast game,
24 to 13.
Scores of the other games were:
Japanese Club 17, Phi Gamma Delta
10; Kappa Sigma 11, Phi Kappa Sigma
7; Encina 4E 25, Alpha Sigma Phi 20;
Phi Delta Theta 2, Kappa Alpha 0
(default); Branner II 2, Alpha Tau
Omega 0 (default).
Encina 2W Shows Fast Work
Encina 2W overwhelmed Breakers,
who had hitherto had no defeats
chalked up against them, 24 to 13. The
freshmen, despite the handicap of
light weight, turned in some flashy
passing and good shots under the
ket, penetrating the club defense time
after time. The first half ended with
the Breakers on the short end of a
15 to 6 score, Compton having scored
field goals.
The club five spurted at the begin
ning of the second half with foul shots
by Compton and a lucky goal by Bell.
But Encina kept the ball moving to
ward their opponents' goal and en
abled Sanders to score three shots,
bringing his total up to six for the
game. Whitney and Adains did good
work for the Encina quintet, while
Compton wfs the whole works for the
Breakers.
Japanese Stage Come-Back
The Japanese Club, by virtue of ex
cellent teamwork after half-time, ran
up a 17 to 10 score against the Phi
Gamma Delta team. In the first period
the Fijis took advantage of their super
ior height and gained a 9 to 6 lead.
Lombard hooped three shots, and Col
vin made one.
In the last period the Japanese
showed some pretty passing and fast
dribbling, especially by Kitow. Phi
Gamma Delta was unable to block the
speed of the smaller aggregation by
their weight, and Lombard made their
only score of the half with a foul shot.
Mizota caged three goals and one foul
shot, while Murata went well in his
floor game.
Kappa Sigma Wins Four
Kappa Sigma made it four straight
by defeating Phi Kappa Sigma 11 to 7
in a fast, closely contested game. The
Phi Kaps furnished the stiffest compe
tition that the Kappa Sigs have yet
had to buck up against, and lost out
because they could not shoot baskets
when they had a chance.
Though the losers had some hard luck
with their shots, the Kappa Sigs played
a slightly more finished game as far
as teamwOrk is concerned, and de
served to win. Hey and Middleton
were important factors in the victory,
while Thomas and McCulloch fought
hard for the Phi Kaps. Kappa Sigma
led 9 to 5 at the half.
Encina 4P] played better than in any
of its previous starts whe it nosed out
Alpha Sigma Phi 25 to 20, registering
its first win. The Alpha Sigs opened
with a bang, ringing up six points
before Encina scored a basket, but
could not hold the pace when Moore,
Garibaldi, and Sheffield found the
range for the freshmen. Ferguson
played sensationally for the fraternity
team, but received little support from
his mates.

The Japanese Club, by virtue of ex
cellent teamwork after half-time, ran
up a 17 to 10 score against the Phi
Gamma Delta team. In the first period
the Fijis took advantage of their super
ior height and gained a 9 to 6 lead.
Lombard hooped three shots, and Col
vin made one.
In the last period the Japanese
showed some pretty passing and fast
dribbling, especially by Kitow. Phi
Gamma Delta was unable to block the
speed of the smaller aggregation by
their weight, and Lombard made their
only score of the half with a foul shot.
Mizota caged three goals and one foul
shot, while Murata went well in his
floor game.
Kappa Sigma Wins Four
Kappa Sigma made it four straight
by defeating Phi Kappa Sigma 11 to 7
in a fast, closely contested game. The
Phi Kaps furnished the stiffest compe
tition that the Kappa Sigs have yet
had to buck up against, and lost out
because they could not shoot baskets
when they had a chance.
Though the losers had some hard luck
with their shots, the Kappa Sigs played
a slightly more finished game as far
as teamwOrk is concerned, and de
served to win. Hey and Middleton
were important factors in the victory,
while Thomas and McCulloch fought
hard for the Phi Kaps. Kappa Sigma
led 9 to 5 at the half.
Encina 4P] played better than in any
of its previous starts whe it nosed out
Alpha Sigma Phi 25 to 20, registering
its first win. The Alpha Sigs opened
with a bang, ringing up six points
before Encina scored a basket, but
could not hold the pace when Moore,
Garibaldi, and Sheffield found the
range for the freshmen. Ferguson
played sensationally for the fraternity
team, but received little support from
his mates.
Encina 2W provided the big upset
yesterday in intramural basketball by
toppling the Breakers from their lone
position at the head of League 7 into
a three-cornered tie with the Japanese
Club and Branner II in a fast game,
24 to 13.
Scores of the other games were:
Japanese Club 17, Phi Gamma Delta
10; Kappa Sigma 11, Phi Kappa Sigma
7; Encina 4E 25, Alpha Sigma Phi 20;
Phi Delta Theta 2, Kappa Alpha 0
(default); Branner II 2, Alpha Tau
Omega 0 (default).
Encina 2W Shows Fast Work
Encina 2W overwhelmed Breakers,
who had hitherto had no defeats
chalked up against them, 24 to 13. The
freshmen, despite the handicap of
light weight, turned in some flashy
passing and good shots under the
ket, penetrating the club defense time
after time. The first half ended with
the Breakers on the short end of a
15 to 6 score, Compton having scored
field goals.
The club five spurted at the begin
ning of the second half with foul shots
by Compton and a lucky goal by Bell.
But Encina kept the ball moving to
ward their opponents' goal and en
abled Sanders to score three shots,
bringing his total up to six for the
game. Whitney and Adains did good
work for the Encina quintet, while
Compton wfs the whole works for the
Breakers.
