Fire Chief Bob Dugan, in the course of a general reorganization
of the campus fire protection system, is asking for a bit of consideration
from motorists. Anywhere but here, it would simply be a case of print
ing some tags, hanging them in appropriate places, and collecting the
fines.
Fires here at Stanford are few and far between, especially since
Dugan stepped in. They are, indeed, so rare that they seldpm enter the
head of a student who leans his weary Ford against a restful fire-plug,
or aligns it with others in company front across a roadway marked
"No Parking." If, however, a serious blaze should loom up, the fire
department might be forced to bru#h a few of these obstructions aside,
with possible serious consequences to the obstructions.
Every road on the campus which might be needed as a right-of-way
by the fire department is plainly labelled. Many of the buildings are not
fitted to resist fire without the active assistance of Dugan's rolling stock.
With the exception of the Postoffice at noon, there are no traffic jams
at Stanford made up of cars which would move if they could. And
there is no excuse anywhere for parking cars where they might be in
the way.
This is one opportunity for systematic traffic and parking direction
which the Board of Athletic Control has so far overlooked.
