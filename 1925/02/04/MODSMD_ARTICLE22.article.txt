# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT
## 
### 
The Editor—Sir :
When I read the criticism of "You and
I" in last night's paper I could fully
appreciate the significance of the words,
"complimentary ticket holder's jury," and
wondered how Mr. Rorke kept from
using them more than he did. Whether
he included the university employees and
faculty or not, I do not know, but if he
did not, their addition would make the
"jury" representative of practically every
good seat in the house.
Every one will admit that the mem
bers of the cast are entitled to some
reward for their services, and the prac
tice of allowing them a- certain number
of complimentary tickets is just, if not
carried too far. We will probably sec
it carried too far on the 13th of this
month, because the size of the cast
should have a direct bearing on the num
ber of "comps" per actor.
The above paragraph is not in criti
cism of "You and I", but when univer
sity employees and faculty can, and do,
have prior time for any or all good seats
in the house I believe it is time for the
students to object. The posters promised
a good show and the D. P. A. promised
good seats. They were both right, only
the latter should have added, "If you've
got a pull."
Along with a dozen or so others I
spent my lunch hour in the Adminis
tration Bldg., and by the tirqe the ticket
sellers arrived promptly ten ihinutes late,
and without change, the line of expect
ant ones numbered better than two hun
dred. The manager announced that per
haps the ones in the rear would not get
very good seats. He might as well have
included those of us who were leaning on
the ticket counter. The men at the ends
of the lines didn't expect seventh row
center seats, but those at the head of
the line like to, and should, see more
than a fringe of seats under the edge of

the balcony, and aisle seats in row P.
I caught sight of four tickets that
promised to pay for my long wait in
line. Just as I was about to point them
out, the manager rushes in grabs the
stack of tickets, saying that a certain
professor wants some good seats. The
manager may want to be accommodat
ing, but giving out all the good in
the house before the student "sale is go
ing altogether too far. He should spend
part of his time picking out a more
visible orchestra to entertain those of
us that cannot get our fullest enjoy
ment when the curtain is up. Until the
present deplorable condition is remedied,
those of us who are not lucky enough
to be receiving money from the univer
sity, will have to continue to sit under
the balcony and think, when looking over
the heads of the university officials, how
lucky it is that professors do not have
large families.
Sincerely
A Senior.
The reviewer knozvs nothing of the
complimentary ticket situation save that
the Daily gets six. These six constitute
the jury to decide upon fulfillment of
publicity promises. Wc did. . IVe liked
"You and I." Ami wc would like to hear
more about this.
