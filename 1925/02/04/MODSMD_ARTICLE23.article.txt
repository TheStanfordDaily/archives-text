WHERE DO WE EAT
IT SEEMS that the studes
* * *
OBJECT TO eating 1 " in the
* * *
DINING HALLS now that they
* * *
ARE BEING asked to do so.
* * I
SOME OBJECT on general principles,
* * *
OTHERS ARE more specific
* * *
IN THEIR denunciation of
* ? *
TIIE EATING places.
* ♦ *
HERBERT HOOVER is mentioned
+ * *
AS AN example of what a
♦ * *
COLLEGE TRAINED diet can do
» * *
FOR A man and we want more
♦ * *
MEN LIKE Hoover;
• * *
NICE, PLUMP Hoovers.
♦ * *
THE ONLY thing that remains
• * *
TO BE done, then, is to find
♦ * 4c
THE PLACE that Hoover ate at
* * *
WHEN HE was here. And
* * *
I!" 1 YOU can find the point
* * *
TO THIS you are doing better
* * *
THAN WE were able to do with the
* * *
TOPIC OF the
• * *
"DIETITIAN'S" SALARY. —M. S.

Several years ago the Roble dining
hall manager saved a lot of money
on old canned fruit. The result was that
about forty women were ill.- In this
primitive time, this sort of thing was
considered thorough-going.
* * *
Modern methods have eliminated
such large numbers as pretentious and
in bad taste. Nowadays effort is made
to be consistent rather than sensa
tional and an average number of about
five in the hospital is striven for, it is
said on reliable info.
* * *
One Palo Alto doctor sees nothing
but additional profit in this. He has
been trying to collect his 1923-24 uni
versity guild fees since last July.
* * *
It has been suggested that the eat
ing monopoly's office be called "Yes-
Man's Land."
