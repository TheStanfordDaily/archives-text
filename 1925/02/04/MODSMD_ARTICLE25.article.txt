# UNUSUAL WORK DONE BY SELF-SUPPORTING STANFORD STUDENTS
## 
### 
Recent figures issued by the Ap
pointment Office show that Stafford
students have departed into strange
fields of endeavor in their efforts to
keep the proverbial wolf from the
portals of their respective dwelling
places.
There seems to be no limit to the
unusual methods that the fertile minds
of students conceive to earn their way.
One has a position as minister for a
Methodist Church, and a second has
found advertising local playhouses lu
crative.
Many students have found unusual
employment in working for the Uni
versity as niimeograpliers, telephone
switchboard operators, basketball offi
cials, radiotelephone laboratory re
search work, as stage electricians for
campus plays, and as assistants in the
various educational departments.
Two have secured positions as
church organists, several work as post
office clerks, as well as in the
store. There is one phonograph repair
man on the list, and a number give
piano lessons and do tutoring. Other
jobs include poster drawing, chauf
fering, electrical wiring, work in ser
vice statidns, early morning milk
routes, soft drink stands on the high
way, soda jerking, selling life insur
ance, and various kinds of publicity
work.
Playing in dance orchestras has
proved popular. One student is con
sulting draftsman for a Palo Alto lum
ber company, and another is assistant
engineer for the city of Palo Alto. The
commonly known jobs include hashing,
work as agents for laundries, cleaners,
and corresponding for city newspapers.
