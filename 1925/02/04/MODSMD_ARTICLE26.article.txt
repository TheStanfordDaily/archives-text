# Criterion of Bahai Is Study Subject Tonight
## 
### 
"What is a Bahai?" is the question
for discussion at the Bahai meeting at
7:15 this evening in the Women's
Clubhouse.
The Bahais lay great stress on "the
divine art of living." They believe that
certain attributes of character, certain
motives, and deeds are the criterion
of a Bahai, not enrollment of a name.
What it is that makes a Bahai is' the
subject of the meeting. The public is
invited.
