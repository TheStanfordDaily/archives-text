### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Here is a young writer of fiction stories, who is well-known for his ability to
cover the ground for a short distance in remarkably quick time. Jackson
Scholz won fame as a sprinter for the University of Missouri back in the days
when Bob Simpson was breaking hurdle records for the same institution.
Now he is in New York again, competing in the indoor meets after a trip
around the world, and the remarkable part of it is that Scholz at 30 is as
fast as, or faster than, the Scholz of 21.
As every follower of track and field athletics knows, Jackson Scholz was
one of the four best sprinters in the ■tforld in 1920 i, when he, with Murchison,
beat Paddock and Kirksey in the final Olympic tryouts. Later, at Antwerp,
the four proved unbeatable as a relay team in Olympic competition. Scholz
gradually drifted out of the game, and four years later upset all the dope by
beating the best sprinters in America at the final Olympic tryouts. Twice he
broke the world's record for 200 meters, arid, at Paris, just beat Paddock with
a final superhuman burst of speed at the tape.
Scholz always contended that his type of finish —a lunge at the tape with
a slight turn of the shoulders —was superior to Paddock's leaping finish, and he
more than proved his contention. Schfilz is one of the, fastest of starters, and
lias the smoothest of strides. His running form is marred only by a slight
tipping of the head to the right.
