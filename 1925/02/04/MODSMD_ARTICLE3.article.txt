# Appointments on 1927 Quad Are Changed; First Reports Are Erroneous
## 
### 
Due to an oversight on the part of
the Quad Board, combined with a
"leak" in a news source, an unofficial
report appeared in the Daily Palo Alto
yesterday regarding staff appointments
for the 1927 Quad. The statement that
Marjorie Allen and Allene Thorpe had
received appointments as women's edi
tor and women's manager, respective
ly, was erroneous.
The appointments referred to were
not confirmed by the Quad Board until
yesterday evening when Allene Thorpe
was appointed women's editor and
Margaret Cosgrave women's manager
for tfie 1927 Quad.
