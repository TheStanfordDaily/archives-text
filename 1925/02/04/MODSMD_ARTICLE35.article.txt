## 
### 
Installation of the new fire alarm
call whistles for the campus was of
ficially announced today by Fire Mar
shal R. E. Dugan, chief of the Stan
lord Fire Department.
Printed cards bearing the number of
whistles for all possible fire locations
on the campus will be distributed this
week in order to facilitate the report
ing of fires. Every fraternity, sorority,
hall, office, and all buildings of any
«ize will be provided with a card. In
return for this added protection Dugan
asks that the cards be put up in a
conspicuous place.
Dugan also called attention to the
laxity of the students and University
residents in regard to parking closer
than fifteen feet to fire hydrants, and
in obstructing closed roadways on the
campus. Much valuable time is lost
at a fire when it is necessary to move
wrongly-parked machines, and for this
reason "No Parking" signs should be
observed, whether there is a penalty
tor non-observance or not.
He designated the following roads
as being most frequently blocked:
Lasuen, at the northeast corner of the
Quad; the roadway in front of the Ad
ministration and Physics buildings;
the entrance to the Memorial Court;
Palo Alto avenue on the west side
of the Physics building; and Panama
avenue on the north side of the Press
building.
Three blasts on the fire house siren
means a fire; the power house whistle
blows the exact location.
