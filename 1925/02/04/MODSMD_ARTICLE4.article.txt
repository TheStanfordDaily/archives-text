# VARSITY BASEBALL TEAM WILL OPPOSE OLYMPIC CLUB NINE
## First Contest of Two-Game Series Scheduled for Saturday 
### Harry Bennett 
The Olympic Club nine will open a
two-game series with the varsity ag
gregation next Saturday afternoon on
the Stanford diamond.
The Cardinal team is right in the
midst of a losing streak, having lost
every game played so far this season.
The outfield is playing a tight game
and very few errors have been chalked
against the infield but, nevertheless,
Stanford has always taken the short
end of the score.
Solomon is now handling the back
stop position exclusively. Hal king
started the first game and Kohler has
been in once, but "Solly" seems to
have taken over the job for good. His
work has been up to par and no trouble
has been experienced in this depart
ment.
Four Good Hurlers
On the mound there have been four
furlers running close for preference.
Collins and Oviatt have appeared the
most consistent workers; yet both
have been knocked around the lot to a
considerable extent.
Teague started the last game against
the Kenealy Seals and went fine for
the first four innings. In the fifth
frame the Seals seemed to see through
him and began to connect with the
ball.
Aydelotte started the first two games
only to be replaced when the opposing
team lifted his pegs all over the lot.
Aydelotte is t working hard and im
provement is noticeable in his work.
Without a doubt, Harry Wolter will
start Oviatt against the Post Street
team next Saturday. Tod has been
found reliable when called on in a
pinch every game this season, but so
far he has never started a game.
The Olympic Club is bringing a
strong team to the Farm. Only last
week they defeated the Santa Clara
nine 5 to 3. This was the first game
of the year and the heavy hitting that
was evident in this contest forecasts
some high averages before the season
is over.
