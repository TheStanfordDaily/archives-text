# MESSIAH EXCERPTS OFFERED BY CHOIR
## 
### 
The University Choir, assisted by all
singers in the "community who wish to
participate, will render the Passion
Music from Handel's Messiah on the
night of Good Friday, April 10, in the
Stanford Memorial Church.
Rehearsals for this event will begin
immediately, at the next regular choir
rehearsal, Thursday evening of this
week, at 7 :30.
For the first time in several years,
Good Friday and Easter fall late enough
in the year to be included in the Univer
sity calendar. The only other Good
Friday service held in the Memorial
Church during the last eight years was
in 1922, when Dubois Seven Last Words
was performed.
According to Warren D. Allen, there
is room in the University Choir for any
experienced singers in the neighborhood,
who would like to renew their acquain
tance with the most popular oratorio
ever written. Sopranos and altos are
needed particularly, and those who have
no other church affiliations will be very
welcome, not only for this Good Friday
service, but for regular assistance at all
Sunday morning services.
