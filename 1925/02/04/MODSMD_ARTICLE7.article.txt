# ORCHESTRA RECITAL By S.F. SYMPHONY IS EXCELLENT
## Leonore Overture, Don Juan Played Brilliantly; 'Cello Solo by Ferner 
### Herbert Klein 
(h\e of the finest musical treats pre-
I sented here so far this season was
heard last night in the Assembly hall
; when Alfred Hertz and 85 members of
j the San Francisco Symphony Orches
i tra gave the first of their two con-
I certs at the University. A well-bal
| tfnced and satisfying program was
played in a way that gave the audience
ample cause for Its apreciative en
thusiasm.
The highlights of the program un
doubtedly were Beethoven's third
Overture to his opera "Leonore" and
the Richard Strauss Tone-Poem "Don
Juan." The Leonore overture ran the
whole gamut of orchestral effects and
was full of magnificent emotional col
oring and great climaxes. The program
called this number "a drama in minia
ture" and it was that, more than the
formally classical character of the first
two presentations, showed Hertz's
power of putting intense human feel
ing into his renderings. It is this abil
ity that puts him almost in a class by
himself in interpreting dramatic and
emotional music. m
"Don Juan" Rendered
The modern element of the program
was furnished by the last number,
"Don Juan." Although written almost
thirty years ago, it is modern in every
sense of the word. It is a piece of
"program music" and is the story, in
sound, of the amorous Don Juan, his
love affairs, and ultimate death in a
duel. Every event was portrayed in a
way that suggested the actual picture
to the mind of the hearer. The work
is full of great energy and power, yet
the passages describing the loves of
Don Juan were among the most appeal
ing in the program.
The first number in order was the
overture to "Iphigenia in Aulis," by
Gluck. The string section showed up
to wonderful advantage as it alternated
between graceful and dramatic parts,
all full of melody.
Haydn's "Surprise Symphony" in G
Major was second. It consisted of four
movements, the surprise features be
ing in the sudden loud breaking in of
drum strokes on the quiet. Andante of
the second movement. It must be con
fessed that the effect was not so sur
prising to modern ears as it must have
seemed to those who first heard it
performed. A piece of music like "Don
Juan" with its dissonances and turbu
lence has surprises for the ear that
the old masters never would have
thought' possible. The Symphony was
well handled throughout except that
the third movement, a minuet, was
given with a force and loudness that
detracted a little from its grace and
lightness.
Following this was the great Leo
nore Overture and then the solo num
ber, the Hebrew melody "Kol Nidrei,"
played by Walter Werner, first 'cellist
of the orchestra, accompanied the or
chestra. Mr. Ferner showed himself
possessed of wonderful technique and
a perfect mastery of his instrument;
but he somehow failed to put the heart
ache and longing into the rendition
that this number requires. This may
have been due to its amplification and
arrangement as an orchestra number.
Judging by this concert, music lov
ers of the campus and vicinity have
another treat coming at the orchestra's
second appearance here on March 31.
They will play then, among other
things, the very new suite, "Through
the Looking Glass," by Deems Taylor,
a New York musical critic.
Next Tuesday the orchestra is pre
senting in San Francisco an all-Wag
ner program with Florence Easton,
dramatic soprano, as soloist. One of
the numbers to be sung by Miss
Easton is Wagner's epic of passion,
"Isolda's Love-Death" from "Tristan
and Isolda."
