# INTERCLASS GAMES SLATED TO FOLLOW INTRAMURAL SPORTS
## 
### 
With the completion of play-offs for
the intramural basketball champion
ship February 20, interclass sports will
take precedence over competition be
tween living groups. Swimming, water
polo, baseball, the Irish Marathon, and
track will follow in rapid succession.
An interclass swimming meet was
held this afternoon, and the water polo
series will take place next week. The
winner of the water polo title will be
awarded ten points in the swimming
ranking, so the title-holder of the
aquatic sports competition cannot be
determined until water polo is out of
the way. The juniors and the sopho
mores are expected to battle it out in
the swimming events. No class seems
to be a cinch at the present time to
cop water polo honors. If the sophs
come through with a win they will
have triumphed in three consecutive
sports and will be almost certain of
the all-round interclass championship.
Prospective baseball material in the
four classes will have a chance to
make a bid for fame shortly after
February 21, when the diamond series
will get under way, each team taking
on the other three squads as was done
in football and basketball. In the ab
sence of definite dope on the merits of
the respective squads each must be
classed as a potential champ. An out
line of the arrangements together with
entry blanks has been mailed to class
managers by C. W. Davis.
Quarter-milers will hog the lime
light on February 28, when the Irish
Marathon will be run off. Victory in
the marathon will count ten points
toward the total in interclass track.
A complete program of cinder path
and field events is on the boards for
March 14, when the 1925 track season
will be formally ushered in. Unlike
other interclass sports, track competi
tion is open to varsity and freshman
performers.
