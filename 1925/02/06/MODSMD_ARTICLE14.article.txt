# RIDE SHANK'S MARE TO CARD-BEAR CLASH TOMORROW, ADVICE
## 
### 
Campus residents are urged to run
their cars into the garage and hie them
selves for the Card-Bruin clash via the
Shank's Mare route tomorrow night, ac
cording to an announcement from the
Graduate Manager's office.
This measure is taken so that Califor
nia rooters and off-campus spectators
will be able to get their automobiles
within sight of the pavilion. As the
parking space is limited it is hoped that
ho congestion will result if students co
operate by walking to the game.
Hoop fans who have purchased stand
ing room for the game must wait outside
of the pavilion until 7:55 before they
will be admitted.
