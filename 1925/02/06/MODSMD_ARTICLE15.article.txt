# CHAPARRAL, WIDOW TO ISSUE JOINT MAGAZINE
## 
### 
Cheered on by the success of the joint
number with the Columbia Jester last
year, Chaparral has completed arrange
ments for a second hands-across-the
nation act, this time with Widow, Cor
nell comic.
Material for the combined number, to
appear on April 2, is now being received
by the Old Boy. Art material will be
accepted up until February 19 and lite
rary contributions until February 24.
The early deadlines are made necessary
by the time conSunied in making and
shipping the Chaparral plates east.
The two magazines, each containing
the same material, will appear at the
same time on the two campuses. Chapar
ral and Widow will alternate in double
page spreads.
Chaparral was a pioneer in the joint
issue movement, making its first appear
ance in this field two years ago with the
California Pelican. Last year a combina
tion was effected with the Columbia"
Jester.
The Widow, who has consented to hon
or the Old Boy by her cooperation, is
famous among undergraduate jesters.
The prefix is neither "grass" nor "golf,"
but "merry." Since her first appearance,
an unmeittionable number of years ago,
she has lost nothing in youth or beauty,
and today she is recognized as teh queen
of college comics. During the present
college season alone she is said to have
refused several offers from other Eastern
laugh-makers, finally accepting the An
cient One's proposal.
