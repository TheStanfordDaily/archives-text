# CARDINALS OPEN SERIES AGAINST WINGED '0' NINE
## Olympic Club Brings Heavy Hitters to "Farm" in Lineup Saturday 
### Harry Bennett 
If the weather permits, Coach Harry
Wolter will send his aggregation of
ball tossers against the Olympic Club
nine on the Cardinal diamond tomor
row afternoon.
The Post Street team has played
only one game this season, meeting
Santa Clara. The Broncos took the
short end of a 5 to 3 score. Notwith
standing the absence of games the
"Winged O" outfit shows strength in
its individual players.
The team being brought to the cam
pus is made up of a number of old
timers in the game. A1 Meuter, for ex
ample, who is handling the backstop
job, has already signed to go to the
Giants' training camp in the spring;
Barry at short is a wearer of the Salt
Lake uniform; and the right fielder,
Wellman, led the batting average in
the Winter League in San Francisco
last year.
Hard Hitters
The game with Santa Clara last
week displayed the slugging ability of
the whole team. Wellman and Hecken
dorf are the only left-handed hitters,
and they pounded the horsehide all
over the lot. The first baseman, Stara
scinich, lifted the ball over the center
field wall, scoring three men ahead
of him.
The Card varsity has been playing
a good brand of ball but nevertheless
arfe following the footsteps of former
varsities. In all the early games to
date, they have been unable to con
nect with the ball with airy effect.
Johnston and McCandless have been
doing most of the pounding but the
varsity experienced the same kind of
a slump last year. There is a lot of
time before the California series and
there is no reason to believe that the
Cards will be unable to locate the ball
after a few more games.
Aydelotte Lost
With Aydelotte signed by the San
Francisco Seals for a trial at the
training camp next spring, the list of
outstanding moundsraen is cut to three.
Oviatt, Teague, and Collins are left in
the tosser's box. Nevers is the old
standby at this work and after basket
ball season is over he will be out in
a uniform.
With Solomon as catcher and prac
tically the same men in the field, the
varsity should be in good shape to
morrow. After losing the first four
starts the Cards are generally figured
to make the total five when they meet
the Post street outfit.
Albert C. Blyird, one of the most
prominent professors of argument and
debate in this country, has been added
to the staff of lowa University.

Francisco Seals for a trial at the
training camp next spring, the list of
outstanding moundsraen is cut to three.
Oviatt, Teague, and Collins are left in
the tosser's box. Nevers is the old
standby at this work and after basket
ball season is over he will be out in
a uniform.
With Solomon as catcher and prac
tically the same men in the field, the
varsity should be in good shape to
morrow. After losing the first four
starts the Cards are generally figured
to make the total five when they meet
the Post street outfit.
Albert C. Blyird, one of the most
prominent professors of argument and
debate in this country, has been added
to the staff of lowa University.
If the weather permits, Coach Harry
Wolter will send his aggregation of
ball tossers against the Olympic Club
nine on the Cardinal diamond tomor
row afternoon.
The Post Street team has played
only one game this season, meeting
Santa Clara. The Broncos took the
short end of a 5 to 3 score. Notwith
standing the absence of games the
"Winged O" outfit shows strength in
its individual players.
The team being brought to the cam
pus is made up of a number of old
timers in the game. A1 Meuter, for ex
ample, who is handling the backstop
job, has already signed to go to the
Giants' training camp in the spring;
Barry at short is a wearer of the Salt
Lake uniform; and the right fielder,
Wellman, led the batting average in
the Winter League in San Francisco
last year.
Hard Hitters
The game with Santa Clara last
week displayed the slugging ability of
the whole team. Wellman and Hecken
dorf are the only left-handed hitters,
and they pounded the horsehide all
over the lot. The first baseman, Stara
scinich, lifted the ball over the center
field wall, scoring three men ahead
of him.
The Card varsity has been playing
a good brand of ball but nevertheless
arfe following the footsteps of former
varsities. In all the early games to
date, they have been unable to con
nect with the ball with airy effect.
Johnston and McCandless have been
doing most of the pounding but the
varsity experienced the same kind of
a slump last year. There is a lot of
time before the California series and
there is no reason to believe that the
Cards will be unable to locate the ball
after a few more games.
