# FRESHMAN BASEBALL SQUAD MIXES WITH SAN JOSE HIGH NINE
## 
### 
Weather permitting the yearling nine
will meet the San Jose high school base
ball team tomorrow morning at 10
o'clock.
The babes have a strong team and
should not experience a great deal of
difficulty with the high school aggrega
tion. Only one game has been played
this season, but this was sufficient to in
dicate that the first year men have a
heavy hitting, hard working squad.
Philippi who pitched the first six stan
zas of the initial contest showed that he
is worthy of all the praise that had been
given him. Sobieski, who twirled the last
three innings of the same game, gives
considerable promise.
Sypher, who occupies the backstop
position, is an experienced man and a
heavy hitter. Nissen in left, Maguire in
center, Baribaldi on second, and Sims in
right have also been wielding the willow
with positive results.
First base will be covered by Thomp
son, short by Busch, and third by Price.
These men have not had much experi
ence, but have shown a great deal of im
provement over their early season form.
