# S.A.E. Shows Class In Beating Encina 2W Men Easily, 31 To 4
## 
### 
S. A. E. demonstrated yesterday that I
it is the class of League 2 by crushing •
the Encina 2E quintet 31 to 4. The 1
freshmen at times showed poor and 1
good guarding, hut the S. A. E.'s were
too fast and showed too good team- i
work for their opponents ever to get
through to score.
The first half ended with the fresh
men trailing on a 19 to 4 count, Green
halgh and Lefebre accounting for the
four points. H. Stephenson. rang up i
ten points for the fraternity men.
In the second half the S. A. E.'s
showed the same co-ordination and
smooth work as in the first period, but
they had a harder time finding the
basket, although there was no diffi
culty in shutting out the Encina squad.
Gibbons at center made fifteen points
in the game, while the Stephenson
brothers also went well. At present the
S. A. E.'s appear to have the best
working combination entered in the
tournament.
Chi Psi Wins
Results of the other games were:
Chi Psi 25, Chinese Club 5; El Tigre 9,
Alpha Delta Phi 7; Encina 3W 2, El

I quoia First 0 (default).
Alpha Delta Phi failed to got going
in the second half of its tilt against
El Tigre and lost, by a 9 to 7 score.
■Both teams were loose in handling the
j boll, but the Alpha Delts had the

better teamwork. In a slow first half
the Row men came out on top 2 to 0.
A corner shot by Phil Neer was the
only basket.
In thp last period the Alpha Dolts
looked like easy winners until El
Tigre had a lucky three minutes and
popped in four shorts from all angles.
Newton and Robinson both hooped two
shots for the club men. Neer and Cran
Holman functioned best for the Alpha
Delts.
Menzies High Man
Chi Psi hart an easy walkaway with
the light and inexperienced Chinese
Club team. Ta'am did some good work
against the Row men and in the sec
ond period kept the scoring of Menzies
down. The Chi Psis played a loose
game throughout and passed the ball
to Menzies even when they were in a
position to make a score. Menzies
caged the ball for twenty-three points,
two less than the Chi Psi total. This

scorers of the intramural league with
a to.tal of 45 tallies.

■Both teams were loose in handling the
j boll, but the Alpha Delts had the

better teamwork. In a slow first half
the Row men came out on top 2 to 0.
A corner shot by Phil Neer was the
only basket.
In thp last period the Alpha Dolts
looked like easy winners until El
Tigre had a lucky three minutes and
popped in four shorts from all angles.
Newton and Robinson both hooped two
shots for the club men. Neer and Cran
Holman functioned best for the Alpha
Delts.
Menzies High Man
Chi Psi hart an easy walkaway with
the light and inexperienced Chinese
Club team. Ta'am did some good work
against the Row men and in the sec
ond period kept the scoring of Menzies
down. The Chi Psis played a loose
game throughout and passed the ball
to Menzies even when they were in a
position to make a score. Menzies
caged the ball for twenty-three points,
two less than the Chi Psi total. This
puts him in first place among the high
scorers of the intramural league with
a to.tal of 45 tallies.
Games in Round 5 scheduled for
Monday are: Delta Upsilon vs. Beta
Theta Pi, Theta Xi vs. Sigma Chi, Delta
Kappa Epsilon vs. Encina Basement,

Kappa Lambda vs. El Capitan, Branner
I vs. Encina 3W. The game between
Encina 2W and Alpha Tau Omega
scheduled originally for Thursday will
be played Monday afternoon at 3
o'clock.
S. A. E. demonstrated yesterday that I
it is the class of League 2 by crushing •
the Encina 2E quintet 31 to 4. The 1
freshmen at times showed poor and 1
good guarding, hut the S. A. E.'s were
too fast and showed too good team- i
work for their opponents ever to get
through to score.
The first half ended with the fresh
men trailing on a 19 to 4 count, Green
halgh and Lefebre accounting for the
four points. H. Stephenson. rang up i
ten points for the fraternity men.
In the second half the S. A. E.'s
showed the same co-ordination and
smooth work as in the first period, but
they had a harder time finding the
basket, although there was no diffi
culty in shutting out the Encina squad.
Gibbons at center made fifteen points
in the game, while the Stephenson
brothers also went well. At present the
S. A. E.'s appear to have the best
working combination entered in the
tournament.
