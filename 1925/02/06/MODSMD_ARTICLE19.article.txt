## 
### 
S. A. E. demonstrated yesterday that I
it is the class of League 2 by crushing •
the Encina 2E quintet 31 to 4. The 1
freshmen at times showed poor and 1
good guarding, hut the S. A. E.'s were
too fast and showed too good team- i
work for their opponents ever to get
through to score.
The first half ended with the fresh
men trailing on a 19 to 4 count, Green
halgh and Lefebre accounting for the
four points. H. Stephenson. rang up i
ten points for the fraternity men.
In the second half the S. A. E.'s
showed the same co-ordination and
smooth work as in the first period, but
they had a harder time finding the
basket, although there was no diffi

Gibbons at center made fifteen points
in the game, while the Stephenson
brothers also went well. At present the
S. A. E.'s appear to have the best
working combination entered in the
tournament.
