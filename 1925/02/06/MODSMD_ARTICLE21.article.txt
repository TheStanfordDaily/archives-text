# The
						Need in Education

The Hon. H. L. Fisher, former minister of education of England and
author of the famed Fisher Bill which attempted to universalize and
democratize education in England, has elicited considerable criticism as
regards his conceptions of American education. Dr. Fisher, who passed
some time in this country visiting schools and universities, among them
Syracuse, has just recently returned to England, and his views, derived
from his observations, have aroused the interest of the leading educators
here.
Dr. Fisher makes his most disparaging comments on secondary schools,
and prominent Americans agree fundamentally that herein lies the most
defective part of our system. It is superficial but Mr. Fisher has evidently
refrained from explaining the cause. -The fact is that we are today doing
something that has never been done before—offering education to all who
want it. That is a colossal undertaking, attended by an unlimited number
of obstacles when it is taken into consideration that we of necessity must
make a compromise between the child whose intelligence rating is 70 and
the child whose rating is 200.
By way of comparison, Dr. Fisher points out that our system is based
on educating the many, while Europe teaches the few. We will grant the
contention that in our colleges and universities we are not as thorough as
they are abroad, but this is merely resultant of our system —which we
should not give up.
Charles F. Thwing, President Emeritus of Western Reserve Univer
sity, says, "It is true that the great lack in American education is that of
scholarly interest. Our peril is that of making education materialistic in
content and aim and practibility in the narrow sense. Yet, the endeavor of
wise leaders is quite in keeping with the best thought of English leaders.
The purpose of both is to give education depth without narrowness, breadth
without superficiality and long vision without visionariness."
However, Dr. Fisher's report was necessarily abbreviated and liable to
misunderstanding jand misinterpretation. He himself maintains that
"nobody can visit America without being profoundly impressed by the
courage and energy with which the extraordinary difficulties of providing
schools for the rapidly increasing population, heterogeneous in race and
language, are being everywhere met, and by the munificence, both public
and private, which responds to any well-grounded educational project."

the bridge team is on a trip. Cardinal is the color of Stanford, "card" for
short.
