Dean Kirkwood of the Law school today rendered a decision making
the official result of the Daily staff election 21 votes for Spangler and 18
for Rorke, instead of the 22 to 20 previously announced.
The election was held under a proviso made by the election board chair
man and the editor, designed to prevent abuse of the customary proxy
system, and stipulating that all proxies must be handed to the editor per
sonally by the person whose vote was involved. Under this ruling, two
proxies handed in by friends of the voters were disqualified. If allowed,
these two proxies would have made the returns votes for Rorke, with
17 ballots, and 22 for Spangler with 13 ballots.
This result was protested, and the matter taken to Dean Kirkwood,
who held first that the stipulation was illegal, being contrary to precedent
and not made by a majority of the board; and second that the use of
proxies is not permissible according to the A. S. S. U. constitution and
the only valid votes were those cast in person. This decision makes the
official count 21 for .Spangler with 12 ballots and 18 for Rorke with 13
ballots. The original announcement was 22 for Spangler with 13 ballots
and 20 for Rorke with 15 ballots.
This does not affect the Quad election, as it would be necessary for
cither man to have 27 votes in order to decide the question on the staff.
