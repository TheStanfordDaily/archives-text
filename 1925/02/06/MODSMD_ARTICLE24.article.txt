# CABBAGES and THINGS
## PHILOSOPHY 10

Professor Brown says that it would
be possible to discover the exact
course of past, present and future
events if a sufficiently comprehensive
differential equation could be made
to include the actions of every particle
of matter.
The idea will probably have to be
abandoned if the compulsory eating
enforcement actually goes through.
There would be disarranged particles
enough to start two volcanos, a war
and three peace conferences, accord
ing to conservative estimate.

The disarrangement which was
originally responsible for the idea has
never been accounted for, by the way.

A Palo Alto Church advertises in
the current freshman handbook that
it is "On the Carline." That's nothing.
Stick with Cabbages and you'll be on
the gravy train.
