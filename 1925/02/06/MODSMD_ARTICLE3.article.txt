### 
Perhaps a few of the most supersti
tious of the men in Branner hall awoke
at 4 o'clock yesterday morning thinking
that the end of the world, so freely pre
dicted, had arrived a day ahead of time,
and that what was necessary was a sec
ond Noah and his ark.
At least, these early risers must have
had weird thoughts when they looked
down at the floor and saw water swish
ing shoes and slippers away from their
beds.
It was soon discovered that the cause
of all this was the opening of a valve
in the water pipe. The awakened men
were soon able to stop the leak. No
damage was done, although the waves
were three inches deep in the down
stairs hall-ways and rooms.
