## A 						Speedy Pair 
### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Here are the two leading contenders for Benny Leonard's crown, who meet
this week in New York. They are Sid Terris, ranked at the top of Tex Rickard's
"First Ten" in the lightweight class, and Sammy Mandell, who is placed next
below Terriß. Sid is from New York's East Side, while Sammy is claimed by
Rockford, 111., and will have the backing of all of Chicago and the Middle West.
Terris is a Hebrew and Mandell an Italian, and both are fast and clever. What
more could one want to make a popular match?
Sid Terris has been called a "Second Leonard," "The East Side Will O' The
Wisp," and "The Blue Streak." He is so fast that you can hardly follow his
lightning blows, and his feet seem scarcely to touch the floor.
Mandell is fast too, but not as speedy as Terris. He is, however, a better
boxer, and, probably, a harder hitter. A finer type of young manhood never
graced the boxing game, and with his ever-present smile, unassuming
ways, and ring ability, has won hundreds of friends.
The winner of this bout will probably be the next lightweight champion,
unless Leonard reconsiders his decision to retire. Terris and Mandell fought
a ten-round draw in New York in December, 1923.
