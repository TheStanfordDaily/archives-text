In the span of twenty-five years.
Ram's Head society has made many
changes in the character of its an
nual productions. •
A week from tonight, Friday the
thirteenth, a Russian satire, entitled
"The Devil's Daughter," will be pre
sented as the 1925 production of Ram's
Head. Twenty-five years ago, however,
in the year 1899, the campus boards
were graced by an entirely different
type of presentation, called by the
singular title of "Seven Dobbers
Down."
What the title meant, no one —not
even the authors —knew, but advance
publicity promised "seven good mur
ders with blood and thunder as side
dishes to each one," and the results
fulfilled all predictions and expecta
tions. The plot was clear burlesque
on the melodramas of that day, fea
turing such lines as, "They shall not
have our little Nell," but it was royally
received and highly appreciated.
No Burlesque
This year's play, however, has
neither "seven murders" or burlesque
to distinguish it. The latter has been
a characteristic of Ram's Head plots
for so long that past productions
seemed indispensable without it, but
Dave Mannoccir, director, has prom
ised "absolutely no burlesque —just
straight satire and comedy."
The idea for a satire on the modern
impressionistic Russian drama origi
nated with Dan Evans and Mike Ely
who are co-authors of "The Devil's
Daughter." The plot concerns the ac
tivities of Boris the Red, Stenka the
Villain, Mother Petroska, The Devil's
Daughter, a real Devil, and sundry
villagers, imps, and dancers.
Effective entrances and exits with
peculiar lighting and musical effects
heighten the atmosphere of the play.
Two choruses, dressed in genuine Rus
sian costumes, have worked for three
weeks on typical Asiatic dances under
the direction of Mrs. H. Lanz and
promise something new in the way
of chorus work.
