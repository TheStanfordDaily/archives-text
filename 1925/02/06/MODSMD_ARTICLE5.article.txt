# Freshman Hoopmen Will Tackle Livermore High Team Tomorrow
## 
### 
Coach "Husky" Hunt's aggregation
of freshman baketball players has a
real job on its hands tomorrow night
when it goes against the Livermore
high school five in the pavilion. The
game starts at 7 o'clock.
This contest and the tilt with St.
Vincent's next Wednesday are the
last obstacles in the path before the
babes clash with the California five
in Harmon gymnasium next Friday
night.
The Blue and Gold combination re
cently lost four of the first string

| through the ineligibility rules that
affected the Cardinal team earlier in
the season. Even with the severe cut,
the Cubs are playing a fast game and
at present hold a slight edge over
Stanford's team.
Livermore has run along from game
Ito game meeting groat success and
comes to the Farm tomorrow with the
best kind of a record. Not so long ago
the Cowboys trampled on the Santa
Clara freshmen and piled up an even
greater score than the freshmen did
when they beat the Babe Broncos.
"Husky's" new combination seems
to be the best one that has gone on
the floor so far this year. The lineup
leaves Vincenti and Crist at forwards,
puts Clark at center, Dennis at run
ning guard, and leaves Biaggini in the
standing guard position.
While playing »t. center, Clark goes
down in the hole ready for the passes
and has appeared the best man for
that position yet tried. Dennis does a
lot of good guarding at his new post,
jSo much in fact, that it has been
found most irritating by some of the
I invading forwards.
Biagfeini is always one of the coolest
I men on the floor throughout the entire
i game. His passing ability and calm
ness make him a valuable asset to
j the combination.
