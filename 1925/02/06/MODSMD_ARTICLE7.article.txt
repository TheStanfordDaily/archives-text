# CARD-BRUIN CLASH IN PAVILION TOMORROW
## BOTH TEAMS HAVE EQUAL CHANCE TO WIN Kerr Develops Strong Aggregation From Comparatively Raw Squad; Ladar Dangerous Man 
### David Meiklejohn 
THE California-Stanford basketball series, classic of the court games played
on the Pacific Coast, will open here tomorrow night in the pavilion at
8 o'elocb.
All the excitement and last-minute qualms of the Big Game will be present,
but on a smaller scale, for at present all indications point to both teams being
evenly matched.
California's chief claim to an even break is the number of veteran players
who grace its lineup. Ladar, Holmes, Higgins, and Belasco have all been in
action against Stanford varsities before.
Ladar, especially, is a good man to watch. Ladar plays a fast floor game
and is a good individual shooter. He rose in the ranks of the California
varsity with competitive tenacity and emphasized this to no uncertain degree
against the Stanford live last year.
Last season the Bruin series was chiefly one hair raising contest after
another. The Cardinals won the first game 18 to 17, after "Nip" McHose in
one last desperate plunge managed to save the game with a field goal. The
second game, close to the closing gun, went to the Bears in much the same
fashion, 26 to 25. In a third contest
California again won 27 to 23, and a
fourth and deciding game also went
to California by a score of 26 to 23.
Lacked Substitutes
With the exception of the first game
Stanford led in the first half of every
contest. The initial game first half
score "was a tie, 11 to 11.
The reason, probably for the Stan
ford collapse, in the last part of each
of these games was the utter lack of
men to take the place of the Cardinal
forwards. This year the situation is
relieved somewhat by the fact that
Kerr can use at least three forwards
during the game without noticeable
lack of strength.
Kerr has built up a team which can
meet California on an even basis. The
significance of this is lost to the fan if
he fails to take into consideration the
batch of comparatively raw material
with which the Stanford coach was

forced to work.
Sophomores Good
Kerr had to find a forward to re- j
place "Nip" McHose, a center to take!
the place of Gurdon Steele, a running '
guard to fit into the place of Ray Mc-
Burney. He had to depend chiefly on
sophomore material, which, as it turns
out, has acquired many of the requi
sites to varsity calibre.
Harry Shipkey has fitted into the !
position left open by Steele, and both
Anderson and Jay red are comers.
Nelson David and Fred Price are
doing well at the forward jobs, and
Ted Shipkey and Howard Mitchell are
choices for the running guard berth.

8 o'elocb.
All the excitement and last-minute qualms of the Big Game will be present,
but on a smaller scale, for at present all indications point to both teams being
evenly matched.
California's chief claim to an even break is the number of veteran players
who grace its lineup. Ladar, Holmes, Higgins, and Belasco have all been in
action against Stanford varsities before.
Ladar, especially, is a good man to watch. Ladar plays a fast floor game
and is a good individual shooter. He rose in the ranks of the California
varsity with competitive tenacity and emphasized this to no uncertain degree
against the Stanford live last year.
Last season the Bruin series was chiefly one hair raising contest after
another. The Cardinals won the first game 18 to 17, after "Nip" McHose in
one last desperate plunge managed to save the game with a field goal. The
second game, close to the closing gun, went to the Bears in much the same
fashion, 26 to 25. In a third contest
California again won 27 to 23, and a
fourth and deciding game also went
to California by a score of 26 to 23.
Lacked Substitutes
With the exception of the first game
Stanford led in the first half of every
contest. The initial game first half
score "was a tie, 11 to 11.
The reason, probably for the Stan
ford collapse, in the last part of each
of these games was the utter lack of
men to take the place of the Cardinal
forwards. This year the situation is
relieved somewhat by the fact that
Kerr can use at least three forwards
during the game without noticeable
lack of strength.
Kerr has built up a team which can
meet California on an even basis. The
significance of this is lost to the fan if
he fails to take into consideration the
batch of comparatively raw material
with which the Stanford coach was

forced to work.
Sophomores Good
Kerr had to find a forward to re- j
place "Nip" McHose, a center to take!
the place of Gurdon Steele, a running '
guard to fit into the place of Ray Mc-
Burney. He had to depend chiefly on
sophomore material, which, as it turns
out, has acquired many of the requi
sites to varsity calibre.
Harry Shipkey has fitted into the !
position left open by Steele, and both
Anderson and Jay red are comers.
Nelson David and Fred Price are
doing well at the forward jobs, and
Ted Shipkey and Howard Mitchell are
choices for the running guard berth.
THE California-Stanford basketball series, classic of the court games played
on the Pacific Coast, will open here tomorrow night in the pavilion at
