# LIGHTWEIGHT FIVES WILL MEET S. J. H. S. QUINTETS TONIGHT
## 
### 
Both lightweight teams are slated
for performance this evening in the
pavilion, when the 145's meet the San
Jose high unlimiteds and the 130's
take on the same school's 130-pound
squad. The 145-pound game starting
at 8 o'clock will be the feature event
while the 130-pound tussle will serve
as a preliminary.
The 145's have fallen into a slump
lately although they have met some
stiff opposition in their last two games.
In the game Wednesday night. Coach
Hal Davis tried a new combination
with Smith at center and Cairns at
standing guard. Smith and Stewart are
about a stand-off for the center posi
tion. Cairns is an aggresive player and
follows the ball closely but seems to
be wild in his passing.
The game tonight will be the last
scheduled affair for the 145's before
they meet California next Friday night
in a preliminary to the freshman game
at Berekley.
The Stanford 130-pcund team nas
been steadily improving and Coacn
Hal Davis now has a scrappy aggrega
tion which puts up a last brand of
basketball. Meyers and Hobro have
sliined lustrously in nearly eveiv
game while Lee also baa been doing
some nice work at center.
The lightweights have one more
game with the San Jose "Y" 130's
before the California game, which will
be a week from tomorrow night pre
liminary to the Card-Bear contest.
