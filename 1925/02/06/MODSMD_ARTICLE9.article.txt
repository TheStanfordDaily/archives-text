# SEARSVILLE LAKE AT 16-FOOT LEVEL
## 
### 
Another twenty-four hours of rain and
two weeks to allow the streams and
freshets to do their work and Searsville
Lake will be full, Ernje Brandsten said
yesterday. Sixteen feet of water in the
deepest part is already in the lake.
An effort is being made to have a golf
club organized by the people living near
Searsville.and to make a golf course on
the grounds near by. There is an excel
lent chance of having a hazardous course
constructed near the lake, Brandsten
said..
