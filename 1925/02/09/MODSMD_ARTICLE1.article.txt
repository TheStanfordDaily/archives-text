Candidates for seven student body
offices and for all class positions will
be voted upon at a general Quad elec
tion tomorrow. The ballot box is lo
cated near the Law steps, and will be
open for voting from 8: 30 i« the morn
ing until 2:30 in the afternoon.
More than fifty persons have been
named for the various offices. With
at least two men running for the more
important positions, some close races
are expected. Caucuses were held last
week, at which were represented the
different factions in the various classes.
These factions have placed their repre
sentatives in the field as a result of
the voting at the. caucus. A caucus
candidate has a large following, and
in cases where two ,of them are up
for the same position, there will be a
large poll.
Jim Lawson is the only candidate
for representative to the Board of Ath
letic Control. His election will take
place on a white ballot.
Three men have been nominated for
membership to the Union Board of
Governors. The two receiving the
greatest number of votes will become
members. In the case of the Men's
Council, each student will vote for two
of the candidates, since two new mem
bers must be elected.
Ray Spangler, Managing Editor, and
Hal Rorke, Associate Editor, candi
dates for editor of the Daily Palo Alto,
will have their names placed before
the entire student body for election
tomorrow. Neither man was able to
get the necessary two-thirds majority
at the D. P. A. election as required for
selection at the primary election. This
is the first time in four years that the
student body has had the chance of
selecting a Daily editor.
