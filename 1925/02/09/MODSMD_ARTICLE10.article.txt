# RAM'S HEAD TICKET RUSH STARTS TOMORROW NOON
## "The Devil's Daughter" To Innovate New Policy For Future Productions 
### Douglas Meservey 
By Douglas Meservey

ipiCKETS for the 1925 Ram's Head production will go on sale in the
*■ Administration building tomorrow at 1 p.m. The usual fast service will be
dispensed by the Dramatic Manager and his assistants, with three lines of
customers in operation at one time. The price of tickets will be increased 25
cents, due to added expense which the show incurs in the renting of costumes
for the large cast and chorus and for the orchestration of the musical numbers.

> Ram's Head shows in the past have
always proved to be the most success
ful of any of the season's productions
from a box-office standpoint, and this
year the demand for seats expected to
be even greater. Any tickets left from
the first general sale will be given to
the Alumni Secretary for disposal to
those who are unable to be present
tQmorrow.
Cast, Chorus Near Perfection
Director Dave Mannoccir and Mrs.
H. Lanz have brought both cast and
chorus to a point further along in the
matter of rehearsals than has ever
been possible in previous productions.
A somewhat longer period of prepara
tion and a greater diligence than usual
in the matter of learning lines on the
part of the cast predicts a successful
show next Friday night.
The chorus, under the expert direc
tion of Mrs. Lanz, has mastered the
difficult Russian style of dancing, and
the dance numbers this year will be
a revelation to an audience accus
tomed to the hit or miss type of
terpsichorean endeavors characteriz
ing Ram's Head shows of the past.
"The Devil's Daughter," as "Mike"
Ely and Dan Evans have titled their
plot, is a unique production in many
ways and from this it derives its in
terest. Plot, music, dancing, and scen
ery are all decidedly different than
usual, but of them all the plot will
appeal strongest to many.
Satire on Russian Drama
It is a clever satire on Russian
drama, bringing out the latter's strong
and weak points in a matter that pro
vokes much laughter, and has so much
of a northern atmosphere that one be
lieves himself transported to the very
steppes of Russia.
The two leads are young—but how
different from the juvenile and ingenue
parts of American productions! Phil
Urner, as Ivan, and Pat Kelley, as
Anna, attempt a love-affair but, accord
ing to the plot, Russian customs of sor
row and sadness forbid happiness and
so they struggle against joy in any
form. Kelley, a freshman, is truly a
find and in makeup and costume looks
exactly like a demure peasant girl flee
ing from the hardships of a cruel
world.
Kiler Original
Les Kiler and Frank Bascom have
charge of the technical details of "The
Devil's Daughter." Kiler has designed
and is putting into execution two sets
that will astonish and please through
their originality alone. One represents
the courtyard of a Russian castle with
the latter rising high on the hills in
the background. Color dominates the
whole set and sets it off in a striking
manner.
Bascom has conducted an exhaus
tive research into Russian costume
design which has enabled him to se
lect the exact types for several cos
tume-changes by the choruses. From
hat to boots, every detail has been
promised to be exact which will lend
additional effect to the striking sets
and satirical plot.
Seats will b% placed on sale Tuesday
at 1 o'clock in the Administration
building, according to Delmer Daves.
No drawing will be held, in conform
ity to the recent changes put into
effect.
