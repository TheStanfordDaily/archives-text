ipiCKETS for the 1925 Ram's Head production will go on sale in the
*■ Administration building tomorrow at 1 p.m. The usual fast service will be
dispensed by the Dramatic Manager and his assistants, with three lines of
customers in operation at one time. The price of tickets will be increased 25
cents, due to added expense which the show incurs in the renting of costumes
for the large cast and chorus and for the orchestration of the musical numbers.

> Ram's Head shows in the past have
always proved to be the most success
ful of any of the season's productions
from a box-office standpoint, and this
year the demand for seats expected to
be even greater. Any tickets left from
the first general sale will be given to
the Alumni Secretary for disposal to
those who are unable to be present
tQmorrow.
Cast, Chorus Near Perfection
Director Dave Mannoccir and Mrs.
H. Lanz have brought both cast and
chorus to a point further along in the
matter of rehearsals than has ever
been possible in previous productions.
A somewhat longer period of prepara
tion and a greater diligence than usual
in the matter of learning lines on the
part of the cast predicts a successful
show next Friday night.
The chorus, under the expert direc
tion of Mrs. Lanz, has mastered the
difficult Russian style of dancing, and
the dance numbers this year will be
a revelation to an audience accus
tomed to the hit or miss type of
terpsichorean endeavors characteriz
ing Ram's Head shows of the past.
"The Devil's Daughter," as "Mike"
Ely and Dan Evans have titled their
plot, is a unique production in many
ways and from this it derives its in
terest. Plot, music, dancing, and scen
ery are all decidedly different than
usual, but of them all the plot will
appeal strongest to many.
Satire on Russian Drama
It is a clever satire on Russian
drama, bringing out the latter's strong
and weak points in a matter that pro
vokes much laughter, and has so much
of a northern atmosphere that one be
lieves himself transported to the very
steppes of Russia.
