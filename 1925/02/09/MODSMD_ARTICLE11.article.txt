## 
### 
Stanford freshmen defeated the
' Livermore high school five Saturday
evening by a score of 24 to 16. This
leaves just one more game before the
opening of the California babe series
in Harmon Gym, Berkeley, next Fri
day.
Crist, playing at forward for the
babes, was the outstanding star of the
evening. Time after time he dribbled
down the outside for baskets and once
he went through the entire Livermore
i team for a perfect shot. He took all
! high point honors with fourteen tallies.
The game was slow in starting and
for the first six minutes of play nei
: ther side was able to shoot a basket,
i Crist counted the first tally that led
j to twelve points in the first half. In
these first tao periods the Livermore
five was held to 3 points.
McGlinchy Livermore Star
The three points scored by the young
"Cowboys" in the first half came from
free throws. It was not until in the
mfedle of the third quarter that they
started scoring on field goals. Bill Mc-
Glinchy was the hard worker on this
outfit and totaled nine points.
Bill started the ball rolling and be
fore the babes were able to sink a
basekt in the second half the Cowboys
had evened the score, 12 to 12. How
ever, this was the nearest that theh igli
school five exer came to the lead. The
freshmen snapped out of the slump and
romped away with twelve points in the
last quarter.
Vincenti at forward slipped into a
shooting slump from which he was un
able to climb. Throughout the entire
evening he failed to score a single
point.
Clark shot four baskets and Dennis
made the other one. This left the
entire scoring power of the evening
into the hands of these three. Biaggini
did plenty of guarding around his own
basket and played the entire game.
Moore and Davidson were the only
substitutes used. The lineup follows:
Stanford (24) Livermore (16)
! Vincenti m F Sherman (2)
I Crist (14) * F F. McGlinchy (4)

fore the babes were able to sink a
basekt in the second half the Cowboys
had evened the score, 12 to 12. How
ever, this was the nearest that theh igli

freshmen snapped out of the slump and
romped away with twelve points in the

shooting slump from which he was un
able to climb. Throughout the entire

basket and played the entire game.
