# BEARS WINNERS IN FIRST COURT CONTEST, 17-13
## Bruin Offensive, Defensive Proves Strongest in Final Minutes 
### 
Clever offensive tactics, supple
mented by Stanford's inability to score
points in crucial moments, enabled
the California varsity quintet to de
feat Stanford's basketball team 17 to
13 in a one-sided game last Saturday
night.
California was ahead at the end of
the first half 10 to 5.
The Bears got off to a flying start
early in the contest, and only once,
when Harry Shipkey's field goal was
scored, did Stanford lead, 4 to 3.
Undoubtedly there was something
lacking with the Stanford team that
had previously defeated Nevada, South
ern Branch, and the Olympic Club
quintets, as good teams as the Bruin
varsity proved to be in the first game
of the series.
There was nothing overwhelming in
California's victory. The Stanford for
wards were simply unable to boost
themselves over the high points and
ultimately the Bruins forged ahead to
a victorious advantage.
Stanford's best chance to win came
in the second quarter when, after hav
ing battled desperately to overcome
a 10 to 5 advantage, the Cards mount
ed the score to 13-12 in favor of Cali
fornia. At this point of the game both
squads went scoreless for the better
part of two minutes. Belasco and
Holmes, however, in two successive
baskets, managed to put the game on
ice with a field goal each. Price scored
the last Stanford point as the half
ended.
California's offensive formations
were successful in bringing the ball
close to the basket often and profit
ably. The Bruins' defense in turn kept
Stanford away from the basket and
forced the Cardinals to take long,
quickly aimed shots.
Nelson David, Stanford forward, was
high point man on the Stanford side
with five, and Belasco of California led
both teams with seven points.
