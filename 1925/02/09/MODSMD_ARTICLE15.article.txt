Tomorrow being election clay, it is the traditional function of the
Daily to urge everybody to get out and vote.
Traditions are useful and praiseworthy provided there is anything
worth while behind them, and through that process of reasoning we arrive
at the conclusion that the urge for voting is an extremely beneficial custom.
So the Daily will several times, in the course of this editorial, urge every
body to get out and vote.
Fifty-two men are proposed for civic office in the University. There
are eight student body offices to be filled, and all class officers are subject
to change. With such a general convulsion in the official personnel it be
hooves all those interested in the conduct of student affairs to get a finger
voted either for or against the man you disagree with. If you didn't care
in the pie. It is much more seemly to criticize—if you want to —after you
have voted either for or against the man you disagree with. If you didn't
care enough to vote, it really is none of your business what the man does
who is elected, even if he is responsible for something that steps directly
and forcibly upon your toes.
The Daily is not in the habit of supporting one man against another.
In case of an amendment to the A. S. S. U. constitution, the paper will
make a more detailed examination than the average student would care to,
and report the facts and the most advisable attitude, according to the edi
torial opinion.
But the qualifications of a student body officer are ability, sincerity, and
merit, not unmixed with the personal equation, and any student in pos
session of his facts and faculties will decide for himself. Moreover,
there is no opposition paper for the opposition to oppose in.
So, as has been remarked, put your crosses on the ballot and get these
candidates out of their suspense.
