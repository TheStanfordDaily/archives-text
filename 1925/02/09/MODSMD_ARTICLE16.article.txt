# Let Us Eat
## 
### 
Three years ago the student body rose up in righteous indigestion
about the rule of the infamous Tagawa over the campus eating situation.
Now we rise up and howl because of the University's grasp on the
same situation.
In the first case, the University failed to provide. It has since pro
vided all too well, at least in quantity. Which leaves the student body
suing for divorce on two radically different points.
The University's first move toward increasing the demand for its eat
ing facilities was to issue an ultimatum, construed in most cases to mean:
eat where we tell you to or get out.
Since the time of taxes on tea, ultimatums have reacted in a most re
sounding fashion. This one did. Perhaps it was a tactical error.
The second move, possibly influenced by that reaction, was to postpone
the settlement of the problem until the middle of next quarter. In the
meantime, menus as usual.
Two possibilities are being considered in the solution. Either force the
students to eat enough to keep the present establishments going, or dimin
ish the number of establishments until such time as they will be fully
utilized under normal conditions.
In the first possibility, the very idea of a new limitation on what we
are prone to call our personal liberty has certain of the indigestible quali
ties of the alleged club steaks oftimes provided for consideration on tlie
local bill of fare.
As for the second, it may result in a medium at least moderately
joyous.
Three months remain for discussion of the problem. During this time,
the University will devote itself to getting as many facts on both sides of
the situation as possible. Tonight the eating clubs will present their view
point.
Altruistic as it may seem, the University has other than financial mat
ters to consider. Curiously enough, too, there is strength in the student
argument. A little optimism might help the ultimate solution; it might
aid the digestion. â€”R. L. S.

POSTER STEALING is back again. Twelve hand-painted posters,
developed at the expense of four hours' time and a vast amount of Russian
research, have disappeared. Also, fifteen of the printed cards are no
more. The Dramatic Manager states that anybody is welcome to take
them the day AFTER the ticket sale, but that Rams Head needs the pub
licity. That's a fair offer, and no fair-minded man will jump the gun.
