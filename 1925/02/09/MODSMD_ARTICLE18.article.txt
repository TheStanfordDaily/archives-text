## JUST PREDICTING 
### Hal Rorke 
Miss Convenient:
You are in full charge of my son's
diet, I hear, and there are a few
pointers that I believe you should
know. Now, I wish you wouldn't let
William eat too much chicken. You
know, he simply dotes on chicken, and
I don't believe too much chicken is
good for him, do you? I hope that
you will make every effort to keep him
in good health.
One of the main reasons why I ob
ject to William eating too much
chicken is that he never brushes his
teeth enough. And you know, Miss Con
venient, how the white meat sticks
between the teeth.
Now, of course, if most of the boys
are in the regular habit of eating
chicken, why just go ahead and let
William do his share, that is, provid
ing that you can see to it that William
pays the proper attention to his
molars. Do be severe!
Sincerely, Mrs. Phinitteny.
Stanford, California.
Dear Senator:
My boy, Joe, writes me that you
are going to put him on rations and
my boy says that he doesn't like it.
Now don't you let that worry you. I
sent my boy to your school to have
you make a man of him and I will back
you up in whatever disciplinary meas
ures you think best. I know what
boarding school did for me.
Yrs, J. P. Auppie, Sr.
