The Seventh Day Adventists gained
approximately three thousand converts
when Big Bertha announced the end
of the California Game.

better Bertha on an army limber.

We call Mr. Bok's attention to this
compulsory military training. After
basketball season every rooter will be
seasoned to gunfire whether he likes
it or not. —STEVE.
