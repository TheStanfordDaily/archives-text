# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT

The Editor â€”Sir:
Now and then an example of real
sportsmanship that is worthy of pass
ing mention bobs up on our Farm. In
this particular instance the action of
the Chinese Club in the Intramural
Basketball League is worthy of men
tion.
They entered the competition with
an admittedly weak team, but their
members desired to play the game. Al
though they have failed to win a game
to date in their league they have al
ways been on hand to play their sche
duled matches. To them it is the
game for the game's sake, and when
the possibility of winning the league
championship dwindled, their interest
still remained.
"We shall play out our schedule and
not disappoint any of our opponents
or deprive them of a game by forfeit
ing our match," said their captain re
cently.
That should be the slogan of every
Intramural team regardless of its
standing in the league. The last round
in the Intramural schedule starts to
day. There have been very few teams
who have forfeited games this season.
Every team that has should redouble
its efforts to place a quintet on the
floor and wind up the season properly.
