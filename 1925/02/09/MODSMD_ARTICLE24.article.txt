# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT
## 
### 
The Editor—Sir:
I also welcome the recent Viewpoints
on the dining halls. However, so far
these have expressed only discontent or
destructive criticism.
If hall men are compelled to eat in hall
dining rooms, would it not be possible to
run these dining halls on a cafeteria
basis?
Each mnn could pay his $30 per month
for a meal ticket. Each day the cost of
his meals would be punched out. Thus
if a man wants to eat more than
worth per month, he can pay extra; if he
wants to economise he can. In this way
a choice of foods would be possible, so no
food would be "forced" on anyone. I
believe the majority would eat more than
$l's worth per day, consequently the Uni
versity would not lose.

The Editor —Sir :
It seems to me that the jobs of both
the Daily and Chappie would be consid
erably lightened if the Daily would pub
lish the means through which any am
bitious student can get his materials into
these offices.
Chappie is habitually begging for ma
terial, new jokes and stories, and yet,
there has never appeared any instructions
as to the method of getting contributions
in,
May I suggest, if there is no such
thing at present, that there be erected
boxes at each bulletin board solely for
the purpose of contributed literary ma
terial. I think this will help in prepar
ing a channel for the "flow of wealth"
bound to come!
Taking myself as a fair average, every
once in a while I have a bright idea —
not often—and I jot it down, with Chap
pie in mind. But I have never contrib
uted because there was no way I knew of
open to liberate that bright flash with a
negligent use of energy; and so the
flashes have died away. Very likely the
material, if got into the office, would
have been short-lived, but getting it in
is the point.
This, I hope, is not unreasonable, be
cause I remember what wonders Watt
did "just sittin' thinkin'" and nothing
else. And if reasonable, here's hoping
for some tangible results.

bitious student can get his materials into
these offices.
Chappie is habitually begging for ma
terial, new jokes and stories, and yet,
there has never appeared any instructions
as to the method of getting contributions
in,
May I suggest, if there is no such
thing at present, that there be erected
boxes at each bulletin board solely for
the purpose of contributed literary ma
terial. I think this will help in prepar
ing a channel for the "flow of wealth"
bound to come!
Taking myself as a fair average, every
once in a while I have a bright idea —
not often—and I jot it down, with Chap
pie in mind. But I have never contrib
uted because there was no way I knew of
open to liberate that bright flash with a
negligent use of energy; and so the
flashes have died away. Very likely the
material, if got into the office, would
have been short-lived, but getting it in
is the point.
This, I hope, is not unreasonable, be
cause I remember what wonders Watt
did "just sittin' thinkin'" and nothing
else. And if reasonable, here's hoping
for some tangible results.
