### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Are holes in one made by accident or accuracy? Arthur Powell of Muskerry,
Cork, sliced his drive to the ninth hole away out of bounds. The ball hit the
roof of a cottage, bounced back onto the fairway, ran up to the green, and fell
into the hole. The Irish always were lucky!
J. H. Taylor, who has won the British Open Championship five times, has
holed out in one on eight different occasions. Harry Vardon, six-time winner
of the British Open, has made a hole in one only once, and that was twenty-two
years ago.
Mr. T. E. Lewis, after playing golf for over half a century, made a hole in
one on Nov. 13, 1909, at the tender age of 78.-
There are two holes where you are paid for dropping in your tee shots. If
you get a one at the "Island Hole" on the Royal Ashdown Forest Club course
in Sussez, in the Easter, Whitsuntide, or autumn tournaments, you will receive
the accumulated interest on a five-pound note, donated some years ago by a
rich golfer who fell in love with the hole. Or if you should get an ace at the
eighth hole on the course of the Druid Hills Club, in the United States, you
would be rewarded in a like manner.
