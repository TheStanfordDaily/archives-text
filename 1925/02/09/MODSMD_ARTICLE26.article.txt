# SOPHOMORES TAKE LEAD IN INTERCLASS SWIMMING CONTEST
## 
### 
With the final result in the balance,
sophomore swimmers took an unsafe lead
in the struggle for the interclass swim
ming championship in the meet Friday
afternoon. The results of tomorrow's
final water polo game of the series will
tell the tale.
At present the second year men are
leading with 37 tallies, followed by the
seniors with 32 points. Freshmen and
juniors are at a standstill with 13 and
14 points respectively.
The chilly drizzle of Friday afternoon
did not hamper the swimmers from turn
ing in some good times, especially Allen,
junior representative, who was clocked
in 1:13 in the one hundred yard back
stroke. This time comes within striking
distance of the Stanford-California rec
ord for that event and many expect a
new time in that event to go on the
books this season.
Seniors Take Relay
The relay, won by the senior team,
went by the boards in rather fast time,
the upperclassmen being clocked in the
four laps in 1:08 2/5. Gibbons, Carson,
MacAllister, and Meyers made up the
team.
The winning squad took three first
places while the seniors and juniors took
two apiece, completely shutting out the
freshmen so far as first places were con
cerned. Williams, a sophomore, was high
point man of the meet, scoring two first
places.

With the final result in the balance,
sophomore swimmers took an unsafe lead
in the struggle for the interclass swim
ming championship in the meet Friday
afternoon. The results of tomorrow's
final water polo game of the series will
tell the tale.
At present the second year men are
leading with 37 tallies, followed by the
seniors with 32 points. Freshmen and
juniors are at a standstill with 13 and
14 points respectively.
The chilly drizzle of Friday afternoon
did not hamper the swimmers from turn
ing in some good times, especially Allen,
junior representative, who was clocked
in 1:13 in the one hundred yard back
stroke. This time comes within striking
distance of the Stanford-California rec
ord for that event and many expect a
new time in that event to go on the
books this season.
Seniors Take Relay
The relay, won by the senior team,
went by the boards in rather fast time,
the upperclassmen being clocked in the
four laps in 1:08 2/5. Gibbons, Carson,
MacAllister, and Meyers made up the
team.
The winning squad took three first
places while the seniors and juniors took
two apiece, completely shutting out the
freshmen so far as first places were con
cerned. Williams, a sophomore, was high
point man of the meet, scoring two first
places.
