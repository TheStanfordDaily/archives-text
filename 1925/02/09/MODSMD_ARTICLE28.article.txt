# JOHN MENZIES WINS SCORING HONORS IN INTRAMURAL RANKING
## 
### 
By annexing 23 of his team's 25 points
against the Chinese Club Johnny Men
zies, rangy Chi Psi center, took a com
manding lead among the high point men
of the intramural basketball league with
the respectable total of 45 points. Men
zies' achievement is all the more im
pressive on* account of the fact that he
participated in but three of the four
games which his squad has played.
Louis Gibbons, who handles the pivot
position for the S. A. E.'s, crept from
seventh up to second place by scoring 14
points against Encina 2E. Unlike the
Chi Psi's, the S. A. E.'s did not go out
of their way to feed the ball to Gibbons
when other members of the team were
in a position to shoot. Elton Cornell of
A. K. L. was forced from third down to
ninth place when his quintet won by
forfeit from Theta Delta Chi and he did
not have a chance to get into action.
"Tex" Middleton, Kappa Sigma, who
led the race at the end of the third round,
dropped down to the third position with
a total of 30 tallies. "Ken" Ferguson of
Alpha Sigma Phi, who was not listed
among the' first ten scorers last week,
earned the right to eighth place with 24
points.
C. W. Davis earnestly desires that all
teams play their games as scheduled, as
a default not only robs the winning team
of practice which it needs but also works
an injustice on men who have a chance
for high point honors, as in the case of
Cornell of A. K. L. who was forced out
of the run-iing when Theta Delta Chi
forfeited to his squad. Moreover, failure
to play is a violation of the spirit of
intramural competition, which demands
that teams play for the fun they may
derive and not simply to win.
At the end of round four the first
eleven high point men were as follows:
1. Menzies (C), Chi Psi 45
2. L. Gibbons (C), S. A. E 35
3. Middleton (F), Kappa Sigma 30
4. Knox (C), Phi Kappa Psi 27
5. Irwin (F), Sequoia 26
6. Dobson (C), Encina IE 25
7. Kellogg (F), Panthers 25
8. Ferguson (F), Alpha Sigma Phi....24
9. Cornell (F), A.K.L 23
10. Sproul (RG), Zeta Psi 22
11. Wittenburg (F), Phi Kappa Psi 22
