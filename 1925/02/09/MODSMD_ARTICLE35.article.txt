# SOCCER SQUAD TIES SAN JOSE TEACHERS
## 
### 
Playing on a muddy field, the soccer
squad tied the San Jose State Teachers
College team in a game played in San
Jose on Saturday. Each team made one
goal during the game.
Although outplaying their opponents
throughout the entire game, the squad
only succeeded in scoring one goal. This
was the result of a kick made in the
first half by Butler, inside left, which
was banked by an opponent and then sent
[ into the net. San Jose made their goal
in the second half after a penalty kick
and some excellent teamwork. McCarty
played a good game as goalkeeper and
Norman was the shining light of the
San Jose defense.
The squad is composed of only four
veterans of the varsity, the remaining
j being members of the last freshman
I'team. Last month the squad de'feated the
i San Jose team by a 2 to 1 score. The
lineup: Hay, outside left; Butler, inside
left; Paige, outside right; Strowger, in
side right; Rivero, center forward;
Hoover, left halfback; Stollery, center
halfback ; Holmes, right halfback ; Daw
son, left fullback; Clark, right fullback;
McCarty, goalkeeper.
