### 
Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Welling
ton Furlong, Fellow of the Royal Geo
graphical Society, bases his illustrated
lecture, "Saharan Lands and Cara
vans," which he will give at 7:30 i to
morrow evening in the Little Theatre,
on a variety of experiences in Tripoli
and the Saharan lands, countries of in
terest which are, however, only a part
of the territory through which he has
traveled on research expeditions.
Colonel Furlong conducted an ex
ploration of Patagonia and Tierra del
Fuego in 1907-1908 for Harpers Maga
zine. Tierra del Fuego is the largest
island in the Fuegian archipelago, the
tip of South America, lying below the
Strait of Magellan while Patagonia
lies just north of the strait. The whole
country was at first called Tierra del
Fuego, from the reports of an ex
plorer who charaqterized it as an
infernal land.
Describes Southernmost Town
Colonel Furlong, in one of his arti
cles subsequently published in Harpers
Magazine, describes his arrival in
Ushuaia, the southernmost town of
the world. Ushuaia is chiefly the site
of a penal colony which he visited.
Colonel Furlong remarks on the pe
culiar dress of the prisoners.
"For purposes of identification," he
writes, "the prisoners wore a uniform
of heay blue material, consisting of a
short jacket with trousers and a pe
culiar round cap, the crown raised at
a point in front and back. On the
jacket was stamped the man's prison
number, but on the front of the cap
was a most ingenious device of marks
and numerals, whereby a convict's
criminal record and prison history
could be read at a cursory glance."
