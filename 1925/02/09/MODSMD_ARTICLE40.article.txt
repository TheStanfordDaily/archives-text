# STANFORD CHAPLAIN RECOMMENDED FOR OFFICE OF BISHOP
## 
### 
The Rev. Dr. Charles D. Gardner,
University chaplain and vice-president
of the Church Divinity School of the
Pacific, has been recommended to fill
the see of the diocese of Olympia,
Wash., according to announcement in
San Francisco papers.
The see has been vacant since the
death of the Rt. Rev. William Keator
last year. His successor will be chosen
at the annual convention meeting in
Tacoma next week.
Dr. Gardner is ope of the best-known
clergymen in the diocese of California.
He is a graduate of the Church Divin
ity School of the Pacific, holding the
degree of D.D. from that institution.
Dr. Gardner has not received any an
nouncement of the recommendation.
In an interview, Dr. Gardner said:
"If this bit of news is to be published
here* its meaning should be understood.
Evidently some kind friend has recom
mended me as a person fitted for a
vacant office. But a recommendation
means little. Even if it leads to a
nomination to the convention my name
will be one among many. The elec
tion is democratic and the choice usu
ally falls upon a clergyman eminent in
the diocese itself, or some clergyman
distinguished for his work in another
diocese and known to the voters. In
this case I am not distinguished and
quite unknown, except perhaps to some
good Stanford man who has a kind
thought for his old padre. That's the
Stanford spirit and I am grateful to
my unknown friend for his gracious
thought of me. But I know nothing
about the matter, and I should like
my friends here to know that I have
not even been nominated, much less
elected, to the high office of bishop."
