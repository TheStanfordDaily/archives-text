# ENTRY BLANKS FOR COLLEGIATE LINKS TOURNEY AVAILABLE

### 
Entry blanks for the Pacific Coast
Intercollegiate Golf Championship which
will be held at Del Monte February 22
are now available for distribution at the
graduate manager's office or may be se
cured from Manager "Nick" Carter, ac
cording to an announcement made by
Carter today.
If present plans mature the tourna
ment will be the biggest collegiate golf
event ever staged on the coast, both in
the number of entries and in keenness of
competition. Carter, who is supervising
all the details of the event, has sent
entry blanks to sixteen universities in
California, Oregon, and Washington, the
majority of whom are cxpected to send
delegations.
Stanford will be represented by its
entire varsity golf team, and by several
members of the freshman squad, includ
ing Ashton Stanley, who held the junior
amateur championship of California for
two years. California's varsity will also
enter en masse. Of the Cardinal players
who will make the trip James Wilson
looms as the most likely contender for
the title on account of his thorough
knowledge of both Del Monte courses,
the inland and the Pebble Beach links.
It is as yet problematical whether
Loren Upson of California, winner of
the coast intercollegiate title in 1924,
will be on hand to defend his title. He
was not in college last quarter and so
could not compete in the Stanford-Cali
fornia tourney. It he is able to play he
will put in a strong bid for the Spauld
ing trophy which will go to the winner
of the championship flight. Upson is not
only a college golfer of ability, but he
is also a seasoned performer who has
weathered considerable outside competi
tion creditably. Stanton Haight, who
captained the Bruin team in its recent
match with the Cards, is not registered
at Berkeley this semester and will not
compete.
Students who engage accommodations
at the Hotel Del Monte for the week end
of the tournament will be able to play a
great deal of golf over two of the finest
courses in California in return for a
comparatively small outlay.
