# CARD TANKSTERS PLAN MEET WITH NORTHWESTERN
## Purple to Engage Stanford in Intersectional Swim Tuesday Afternoon 
### Fred Speers 
By Fred Speers

Definite arrangements for a dual
swimming meet between Northwestern
1 University of Evanston, Ilfinois, and
Coach Ernst Brandsten's Cardinal
swimmers were completed today. The
meet will be held at Encina pool to
morrow afternoon at 3 o'clock.
This clash has been dickering for some
time but little hope of clinching the
matter was entertained but due to the
fact that practically the entire Purple
swimming team is touring the western
coast with the Northwestern Glee Club
the meet was arranged.
Northwestern University, though a
rather impotent factor in major sports
of the Big Ten Conference, is noted for
the excellence of "its minor sports teams
especially swimming. The mid-western
boys registered at the Purple institution
last year copped the National Inter-Col
legiate Swimming Meet held at An
napolis.
Aquatic relay teams of this outfit hold
national records in several length races,
notably the 200 yard.
Two members of the visiting team
competed for the United States in the
last Olympic Games and arc middle dis
tance men of rare national repute.'These
are Howell and Breis who navigate the
century, furlong, and quarter with equal
facility.
It was these men in company with sev
eral of their teammates who broke Yale
University's long string of records in all
distance relays.
The events which will be swum off, so
to, speak, are the 50, 100, 200 yard free
style races, 100 yard breast stroke and
100 yard backstroke, four man relay
800 feet, and besides these will be the
diving events.
Brandsten has not yet received the
probable list of Purple entries nor has
he decided what the Cardinal competitors
will be, because the inter-class meet may
uncover some material worthy of swim
ming against Northwestern.
