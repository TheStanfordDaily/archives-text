# ZETA PSI TAKES 17-6 BEATING FROM FAST SEQUOIA II QUINTET
## Better Teamwork Enables Encina 1W to Hand 20-16 Defeat to Pirates 
### 
Zeta Psi stock took another fall when
the strong Sequoia II five defeated its
team in a ragged game, 17 to 6. The
Zetes were unable to get going at any
time, being shut out in the first half.
Encina 1W showed improved form in
beating the Pirates 20 to 16 in the only
other game on Friday.
Sequoia II has come along in fine
shape in the league games it has played
and had the most coordinated attack of
any game they have played against the
Zetes. In the first half they were un
able to find the basket with any con
sistency, although their defense was air
tight.
In the final period the hall men came
through with a shower of baskets, Brown
leading the offense with three to his
credit in this half. Irwin also starred
for Sequoia, while Sproul functioned
best for the Zeta Psi quintet.
Encina-Pirate Game Fast
The Encina 1W and Pirates struggle
produced some faster basketball. Al
though the freshmen held a 12 to 5 lead
at half-time the independents spurted
and looked for a time as if they might
win, with Evans, Acheson, and Espy
pushing the freshmen.
But Encina kept the lead with shots
by Read, Hughes, and Canfield, and fin
ished the game with a four-point lead,
20 to 16. Both teams had a little diffi
culty in keeping the ball in their pos
session, but the better teamwork of the
freshmen enabled them to defeat the
Pirates, who did not get going until the
second half.
With the intramural series entering on
its last week today the race has narrowed
