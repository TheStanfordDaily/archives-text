# ZETA PSI TAKES 17-6 BEATING FROM FAST SEQUOIA II QUINTET
## Better Teamwork Enables Encina 1W to Hand 20-16 Defeat to Pirates 
### 
Zeta Psi stock took another fall when
the strong Sequoia II five defeated its
team in a ragged game, 17 to 6. The
Zetes were unable to get going at any
time, being shut out in the first half.
Encina 1W showed improved form in
beating the Pirates 20 to 16 in the only
other game on Friday.
Sequoia II has come along in fine
shape in the league games it has played
and had the most coordinated attack of
any game they have played against the
Zetes. In the first half they were un
able to find the basket with any con
sistency, although their defense was air
tight.
In the final period the hall men came
through with a shower of baskets, Brown
leading the offense with three to his
credit in this half. Irwin also starred
for Sequoia, while Sproul functioned
best for the Zeta Psi quintet.
Encina-Pirate Game Fast
The Encina 1W and Pirates struggle
produced some faster basketball. Al
though the freshmen held a 12 to 5 lead
at half-time the independents spurted
and looked for a time as if they might
win, with Evans, Acheson, and Espy
pushing the freshmen.
But Encina kept the lead with shots
by Read, Hughes, and Canfield, and fin
ished the game with a four-point lead,
20 to 16. Both teams had a little diffi
culty in keeping the ball in their pos
session, but the better teamwork of the
freshmen enabled them to defeat the
Pirates, who did not get going until the
second half.
With the intramural series entering on
its last week today the race has narrowed
down to between two or three teams,
in each league for the respective divis
ional titles. In some instances, as in
the case of Alpha Kappa Lambda in
League 1, one outfit may have such an
edge as to be practically a cinch for
initial honors. A. K. L. has won all four
of its contests and meets the thrice de
feated El Capitan five in the final today.
Sigma Alpha Epsilon looks like an
equally safe bet to cop the flag in League
2. The S. A. E.'s have come through the
season with a clean slate, and take on
the four times beaten Sequoia Firsts to
morrow. In League 3 both Sequoia Sec
ond and Chi Psi have four straight wins
to their credit and will decide the issue
when they clash tomorrow. Encina IE
leads League 4 by virtue of its four
victories.
Ties Are Possible
A triple tie for first honors exists in
League 5, El Toro, Theta Chi, and En
cina 3E each having three wins and one
defeat. The two first-named teams meet
Wednesday, and the tie may not be
broken if Encina comes out on top in its
tilt with the Encina 4W aggregation on
the same day. Kappa Sigma and Phi
Delta Theta, both unconquered to date,
battle it out for the championship of
League . 6 Thursday. Breakers, Japanese
Club, and Branner Second have an equal
chance for League 7 honors. The Japa
nese and the Breakers tangle Friday. The
undefeated Theta Xi's loom as the cham
pions of League 8.
In the event that ties exist in Leagues
5 and 7 after the series is finished, play
offs will be held before the elimination
contests for the University championship
commence. Then drawings will be con
ducted between the eight divisional win
ners to determine the first round games,
and the resulting victors wil lbe matched
for the semifinals. Playoffs will probably
be concluded by the end of next week.
In addition to the games regularly
scheduled for tomorrow the contest be
tween Kappa Alpha and Encina 4E,
scheduled originally for Thursday, will
be played at 2 o'clock in Encina Gym.

Pirates, who did not get going until the
second half.
With the intramural series entering on
its last week today the race has narrowed
down to between two or three teams,
in each league for the respective divis
ional titles. In some instances, as in
the case of Alpha Kappa Lambda in
League 1, one outfit may have such an
edge as to be practically a cinch for
initial honors. A. K. L. has won all four
of its contests and meets the thrice de
feated El Capitan five in the final today.
Sigma Alpha Epsilon looks like an
equally safe bet to cop the flag in League
2. The S. A. E.'s have come through the
season with a clean slate, and take on
the four times beaten Sequoia Firsts to
morrow. In League 3 both Sequoia Sec
ond and Chi Psi have four straight wins
to their credit and will decide the issue
when they clash tomorrow. Encina IE
leads League 4 by virtue of its four
victories.
Ties Are Possible
A triple tie for first honors exists in
League 5, El Toro, Theta Chi, and En
cina 3E each having three wins and one
defeat. The two first-named teams meet
Wednesday, and the tie may not be
broken if Encina comes out on top in its
tilt with the Encina 4W aggregation on
the same day. Kappa Sigma and Phi
Delta Theta, both unconquered to date,
battle it out for the championship of
League . 6 Thursday. Breakers, Japanese
Club, and Branner Second have an equal
chance for League 7 honors. The Japa
nese and the Breakers tangle Friday. The
undefeated Theta Xi's loom as the cham
pions of League 8.
In the event that ties exist in Leagues
5 and 7 after the series is finished, play
offs will be held before the elimination
contests for the University championship
commence. Then drawings will be con
ducted between the eight divisional win
ners to determine the first round games,
and the resulting victors wil lbe matched
for the semifinals. Playoffs will probably
be concluded by the end of next week.
In addition to the games regularly
scheduled for tomorrow the contest be
tween Kappa Alpha and Encina 4E,
scheduled originally for Thursday, will
be played at 2 o'clock in Encina Gym.
Zeta Psi stock took another fall when
the strong Sequoia II five defeated its
team in a ragged game, 17 to 6. The
Zetes were unable to get going at any
time, being shut out in the first half.
Encina 1W showed improved form in
beating the Pirates 20 to 16 in the only
other game on Friday.
Sequoia II has come along in fine
shape in the league games it has played
and had the most coordinated attack of
any game they have played against the
Zetes. In the first half they were un
able to find the basket with any con
sistency, although their defense was air
tight.
In the final period the hall men came
through with a shower of baskets, Brown
leading the offense with three to his
credit in this half. Irwin also starred
for Sequoia, while Sproul functioned
best for the Zeta Psi quintet.
Encina-Pirate Game Fast
The Encina 1W and Pirates struggle
produced some faster basketball. Al
though the freshmen held a 12 to 5 lead
at half-time the independents spurted
and looked for a time as if they might
win, with Evans, Acheson, and Espy
pushing the freshmen.
But Encina kept the lead with shots
by Read, Hughes, and Canfield, and fin
ished the game with a four-point lead,
20 to 16. Both teams had a little diffi
culty in keeping the ball in their pos
session, but the better teamwork of the
freshmen enabled them to defeat the
Pirates, who did not get going until the
second half.
