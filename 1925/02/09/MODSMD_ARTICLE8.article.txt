# LIGHTWEIGHT TEAMS ARE VICTORIOUS IN COURT GAMES FRIDAY
## 
### 
Both Stanford lightweight teams
were victorious in their court games
Friday night, the 145's heating the San
Jose High unlimiteds 23-13, and the
130-pound team winning from the San
Jose 130's by a score of 17-12. With
(lie score against them at half time
10-7 the 145's started going in the
second frame and ran up sixteen
points while their opponents were held
to three.
The 145-pound quintet played rather
ragged basketball. Passes were wild
and the teamwork was not of the best.
Smith played a good game at center,
scoring six points. Clark did some nice
guarding work and played a good floor
game.
The team on a whole did not display
the same smoothness that they showed
in their earlier games but Coach Hal
Davis has a week to iron out the
wrinkles before they take on Cali
fornia.
The 130i-pound game was liard-fought
throughout with the score see-sawing
back and forth. At half time Stanford
led 7 to 6. A long field goal by Geery
and three additional points by Hobro
sewed che game up for the Cards in
the last few minutes of play.
Hobro led the scoitng attack and
played a fast game. He was responsi
ble for six points. Meyers accounted
for two field goals.
