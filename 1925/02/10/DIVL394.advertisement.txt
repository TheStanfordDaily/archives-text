Why the two-button
Because you men at Stanford have
shown a preference for coats which
are roomy at the shoulder and trim
about the hips. This effect—best ob
tained with two buttons, set low—is
masterfully handled by Kuppenheimer.
In their light shades of grey, blue,
and buff, and interesting weaves, our
spring two-button suits have proved
especially attractive to those who have
been down to see them.
Thirty-five dollars to fifty dollars
