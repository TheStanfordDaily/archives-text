## Explorer Has Been Writer, Ethnologist, Cowboy, Soldier, Artist 
### 
Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Welling
ton Furlong, Fellow of the Royal Geo
graphical Society, will lecture on
"Saharan Lands and Caravans" at 7:30
this evening in the Little Theatre, il
lustrating his talk with colored lantern
slides from the collection he has se
cured on his expeditions.
Colonel Furlong is an explorer who
has conducted expeditions in the
Saharan lands, of which he will tell
tonight. He has also explored in the
Azores, Madeira, Desertas, and Canary
islands. He has made his way through
the wilderness of Dutch Guiana, up the
Orinoco and across the llanos of Vene
zuela, and has gone to the very south
ernmost tip of South America, Tierra
del Fuego, which he calls "the land
of cold fire" in an article he subse
quently wrote for Harper's Magazine.
He discovered in Tripoli harbor in
1904 the wreck of the U* S. frigate
"Philadelphia" sunk by Lieutenant
Stephen Decatur exactly 100 years
before.
Colonel Furlong's career as an ex
plorer, which furnishes the material
for his lecture tonight, is only a part
of his experiences.
For his work in the field of "Belles
Lettres and Beaux Arts" Colonel Fur
long was made an officer of the French
Academie last year, the highest honor
France can bestow 011 a foreigner for
artistic achievement.
He is the author of several books
and articles, among them "The Gate
way to the Sahara," "The French as
Colonizers," "The Men Behind the
French Guns," and "Native Troops of
the Tricolor." Another subject he has
treated is that of French developments
in North Africa, which he illustrated
by means of a series of paintings.
Scientific investigation has been an
other of Colonel Furlong's interests.
He conducted an ethnological research
in the leading museums of South
America in 1910, and contributed the
Fuegi and Patagonian collection in the
American Museum of Natural History
and in the Peabody Museum, Harvard
University.
As a result of his experiences as a
soldier, Colonel Furlong was awarded
medals and badges by Greece, Monte
negro, and Italy. He has had a part
not only in war, but also in peace
negotiations, and was one of Wilson's
party in Paris. During the war he was
attached to the Intelligence depart
ment of the General Staff.
Colonel Furlong's achievements are
even more varied by his career as a
cowboy. Riding the famous bucking
bull, Sharkey, he won the world's
rough riding championship in the
round-up at Pendleton, Oregon, in 1914.
