# Three Quartettes Are Tied for First Place In Glee Club Contest
## 
### 
Three quartettes, so equally matched
in singing ability that the winner is
not yet picked, tried out in the Glee
Club Quartette Contest yesterday aft
ernoon. They will sing again for War
ren D. Allen, director of the Glee Club,
at 5 o'clock in Room 84 today, and a
final selection will then be made.
The winning four will be heard in
the annual Home Concert Program to
be given here February 27 and for
which the Glee Club is now prepar
ing. It is possible that the quartette
will accompany the club on its south
ern tour in the spring.
Another feature of the Home Con
cert will be the Woodwine Ensemble
composed exclusively of instruments
of the woodwind variety played by
San Francisco artists. This group will
be heard for the first time on the
peninsula and promises to provide
something unusual in the line of music.
The Ensemble will give the *wind in
struments an opportunity to show their
beauty and capabilities just as a cham
ber music quartette does for stringed
instruments.
