## 
### 
Boxing and several selections by a
quartet of Sequoia men made up the
program at a smoker given by mem
bers of Sequoia Club last evening at
the hall. Several recitations were also
among the numbers on the program.
Members Of the organization will
give an informal dance Friday evening,
February 20. Decorations will be under
the supervision of Hume West, who
will carry the scheme to make a sil
houette effect, casting shadows and
fantastic forms on the walls. The
lights, favors, and programs will all
be in keeping with this. Jaak Ross'
seven-piece orchestra from the city
will be engaged for the occasion.
Election of Sequoia Club officers
will take place the coming Thursday
when a president, vice-president, and
secretary will be chosen for the rest of
the college year.
