# CARD NINE MEETS REDWOOD POLICE TEAM TOMORROW
## 
### 
The varsity baseball squad will meet
the Redwood City Police nine at 3:30
tomorrow afternoon on the varsity dia
mond and the freshman baseball team
will oppose the Santa Clara yearlings
at the same time on the freshman lot.
Judge Ray Griffin, who sponsors the
Redwood team is a close follower of
Stanford athletics and for' several
years he has organized a team to meet
the Stanford nine. Griffin usually has
a few former Cardinal diamond stars
in his lineup, and as a rule he gives
the varsity some stiff competition.
Wolter has three first-string pitchers
upon whom he may rely, Collins,
Oviatt, and Teague. It is questionable
which one of these men will be called
upon to start tomorrow's contest, but
is certain that Solomon will be the
other unit of the battery.
The infield will be composed of
"Chuck" Johnson, "Shorty" Roberts,
Mulchay, and Cuddeback*. These men
are all veterans from last years's
team. The outfield will be made up of
Jerry. Stewart, Davie Brown, and "Bus"
McCandless. McCandless is the only
Block "S" man in the outfield.
Freshmen Are Powerful
The freshmen have played only one
game but this was sufficient to indi
cate that Hunt has a heavy-hitting,
hard-fighting aggregation.
Little is known regarding the rela
tive strength of the Santa Clara and
Stanford babes, but in the past Santa
Clara has turned out strong yearling
teams.
