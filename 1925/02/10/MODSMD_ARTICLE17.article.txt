# Students Urged to Pay Syllabus Fees by Mail
## 
### 
Students are asked to pay their
syllabus fees tomorrow by mailing
checks to the University cashier, if
possible, instead of by remitting pay
! merits in person at the Administration
building as has been done in the past.
It is hoped by this means to eliminate
the lines and confusion usually in
curred when the mid-quarter contri
butions to the University treasury are
! made.
