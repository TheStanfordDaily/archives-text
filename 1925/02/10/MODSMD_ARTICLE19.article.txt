Sixty graduate and undergraduate journalists met at the Hotel St.
Francis last evening, and in a most amicable California-Stanford atmos
phere installed a California chapter of Sigma Delta Chi, national profes
sional journalistic fraternity. This new group at California will be a
tangible body for give-and-take relations with Stanford journalism—
something that should be of benefit to both universities.
Journalism is almost the only undergraduate activity in which two
rival colleges can meet on a non-competitive basis, and in a pinch the
two college papers involved can do much for the relations between the
institutions. Doubtless these Sigma Delta Chi chapters will hold joint
meetings from time to time, just as the two Hammer and Coffin chapters
in the same universities have met together, and through these meetings
a joint understanding and friendship will be built up—an understanding
which will find expression just as readily, and be more inclined to endure
than the mutual feeling of regard inspired by a pair of football teams
tearing great holes in the turf. Rivals, we hope, Stanford and California
will always be, but enemies, never.
Sigma Delta Chi has great influence over the type of journalism in any
institution in which it is found, and Sigma Delta Chi is a national unit.
And it is this combination of facts that prophesies closer and better
relations between California and Stanford in the future.
