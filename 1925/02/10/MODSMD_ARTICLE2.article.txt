# RESEARCH INSTITUTE COMPLETES ANNUAL WHEAT INVESTIGATION
## 
### 
The marked rise in wheat prices
during the second half of 1924 ajjd the
high level at the end were mainly at
tributable to the very close adjustment
between world supplies and require
ments, according to conclusions found
in the third wheat study of the Food
Research Institute just issued.
The institute considers it reasonable
to expect the acute stringency to be
relieved with the harvesting of the
next crop. The conclusion is reached
after a study of the supplies of wheat
available in exporting countries and of
the requirements of European and
Oriental importers.
With the United States the largest
exporter, American prices were lower
than those of her competitors, the
study points out. During the first five
months of the present crop year, the
leading wheat exporting countries —
United States, Canada, Argentine,
Australia and British India — had
shipped, mainly to Europe, 344 million
bushels of wheat and flour. Of this
total, the United States had shipped
172 million bushels, or 50 per cent.
The Canadian foreign marketing was
much less rapid, the Institute reports,
while the Argentine and Australian
shipments from this year's crops are
just now getting under way and, in
view of high prevailing prices, bid fair
to be of large dimensions.
It is estimated by the bulletin that
approximately 373 million bushels of
wheat were available for export on
January 1 in various exporting coun
tries.
Level Prices in December
The Institute shows that in spite of
the rapid advance in prices in the
United States, wheat prices at Ameri
can markets were lower than Canadian
and Argentine prices for similar wheat
until December. During that month
American prices became more nearly
comparable with those of her com
petitors. Because of the relative short
age of Canadian spring wheat and the
relative abundance of American spring
wheat, the import tariff of 42 cents
was largely inoperative during the
period under review. Only small par
cels of Canadian wheat have been im
ported into the United States during
the past six months.
"The United States has been for
tunate in producing a large crop of
bard wheat of good quality Ibis year
when crops in other parts of the world
have been below normal, and when
wheat substitutes have also been
scarce," said Mr. J. B. Davis, a director
of the Food Research Institute. "The
Canadian crop shortage is the most
serious among the usual exporters.
But poor crops in southern and eastern
Europe, Germany, and Russia have
forced these countries to ro abroad
for unusually large quantities of
wheat.
