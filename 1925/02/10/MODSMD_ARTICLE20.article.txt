# A 						New Editor
## 
### 
Tomorrow, H. B. Rorke, elected by Quad ballot today, will take up
the editorial duties for the remainder of the college year with the
confidence of adherents and opponents alike that the Daily will be
competently handled.
Rorke became a member of the staff in November, 1920, and has
served ever since, with two intermissions during which he was not
registered in college. His experience clearly establishes his eligibility
for the editorship. He comes into office by vote of the student body,
which will enable him to wield a firm editorial typewriter in the knowl
edge that he is the actual choice of student opinionâ€”a factor of which
the editor elected by his staff cannot be so certain.
Under Rorke the Daily should be a brilliant and entertaining news
paper.
In closing Volume 66 of The Daily Palo Alto, grateful acknowl
edgments are due Dr. Henry David Gray, Donald McKay, and Kverett
YV Smith for editorial contributions. Tlje chief 'satisfaction in being
connected with a student publication lies in the degree of interest taken
by the staff, and Volume 66 has been rarely fortunate in this respect.
The retiring management especially thanks Miss Mary Baker, who
leaves a splendid record as Women's Editor, and R. L. Spangler, who has
done more than his share as Managing kditor.
