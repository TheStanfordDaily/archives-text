# RADIO DEBATE TO BE HELD WITH OREGON
## 
### 
Plans are being made for a Radio
Debate between Stanford and the Uni
versity of Oregon. A similar debate
was carried on last year with Oregon
and the University of California. If the
universities are able to hire a private
line between the Oregonian station
and the Oakland Tribune, KLX, so
that both sides of the debate can be
broadcasted from the two stations, the
debate will probably be held on March
25.
The question for debate is "Should
the Present Exclusion Law be Amend
ed so as to Admit Japanese on the
Same Basis as Europeans?" It has not
been determined what side Stanford
will uphold. The team of two men will
be chosen from the squad which is at
present working on the question.
Members of the squad include Baer,
Bruce, Duniway, Durand, Frazier, Goss
lin, Jones, Lindsey, Parker, Crocker,
and Scott.
