"Now that" Quad elections are over
and there is time to meditate, Spur
geon's apothegm gives food for
thought:
"He who believes everybody will be
bitten, but he who believes nobody will
be devoured."
The "Shrinking Violet" who doesn't
know where the Chaparral office is, or
that the editor may be reached through
the United States Mail Service is most
interesting. Especially since he has
discovered that getting his "bright
ideas" in is the "point."
Just to add a word to this food dis
cussion—with Dr. Frank Crane—"Buy
a banana or so, and a bag of peanuts,
for your lunch, instead of gorging your
self on a table-d'liote monstrosity at a
restaurant, and you'll feel better, and
live longer."

Culture? Education? The very heart
and soul of it is the disposition to
"Tackle the difficult things." And
there is a sufficient number to make
perfection of the world.
Might not an "Educated Man" be
perhaps the man who is never more
serene than when "all creation thinks
it has downed him"?
