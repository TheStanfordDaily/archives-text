# Sophomore Women Will Play Seniors Tomorrow
## 
### 
The sophomore women will have j
their first chance to demonstrate bas- :
ketball ability when they meet the
seniors in a practice game at 4 o'clock
tomorrow afternoon on the Roble field.
Due to the rain their game with the
juniors scheduled for last week had
to be postponed. It will probably not be j
played until Thursday of this week. !
The sophomores have a good squad, j
both in numbers and ability. The game j
tomorrow will help to show how
changes in the lineup necessitated by
the absence of three of last year's !
players, will affect their chances.
