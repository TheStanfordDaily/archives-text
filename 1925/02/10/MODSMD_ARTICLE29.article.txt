# SPORTS OF 1925
## Among Those Present 
### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
St. Augustine, known as the oldest town in the United States, has looked
on many sights since it was founded by the Spanish in 1565, but never before
has it viewed such a collection of feminine aquatic stars as are now gathered
within its gates for the Women's National Swimming and Diving Champion
ships.
Among those of Neptune's Daughters who are sure to give several records a
tumble are Sybil Bauer of Chicago, and Helen Wainwright and Gertrude
Ederle of New York. Sybil broke only eighteen world's backstroke records
last year, and is out to smash a couple of dozen more before 1926 rolls in.
She is the "Nurmi" of women swimmers in that she has perfect rythm of
stroke, combined with a fine judgment of pace.
Helen Wainwright is famous as a champion diver and record-breaking free
style swimmer, and as the girl who will attempt to swim the English channel
next summer. Gertrude Ederle last, year was regarded as the world's greatest
woman swimmer, but she badly beaten at the Olympic games. Now she
is out for revenge.
East, West, South, and Middle West will all be represented in this carnival
of pulchritude and skill. The coast will send Carol Fletcher, Florence Cham
bers, and Frances Cowells Schroth; the Middle West, Sybil Bauer, Ethel
Lackie, and Eleanor Coleman; while Virginia Ashe will represent Atlanta.
But, as usual, the Women's Swimming Association of New York is expected
to carry off most of the glory.
