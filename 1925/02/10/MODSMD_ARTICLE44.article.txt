# EXAMINATIONS FOR L. A. SCHOOLS WILL BE HELD IN NORTH
## 
### 
Examinations for positions in the
Los Angeles city schools will be held
annually in San Francisco according
to information issued by the Appoint
ment Office. This year the examina
tion will be held at 9 o'clock on April
13, at a place yet to be announced.
The official anouncement in part,
follows: "Applications must be in the
mail on or before March 13. It is there
fore important that the proper forms
be secured immediately. Absolutely no
applications completed at a later date
will be given any consideration what
soever. Teachers, whether they have
had experience or not, and who have,
or will have secured their high school
credentials between September 1, 1924,
and September 1, 1925, including those
who will have completed sufficient grad
uate work to secure a secondary cre
dential up and including the last date
mentioned above, evtn though their
degrees may not have been granted
officially; and who have attended
Stanford University some time during
the year specilled, will be eligible to
take this examination. Full particu
lars and the proper application forms
may be obtained at the Stanford Uni
versity Appointment Office."
In the past the practice has been
to give examinations for Los Angeles
schools in the southern part of the
state only, which made it impossible
for many students to avail themselves
of many desirable positions. Last year,
largely through the efforts of Mrs.
Snell, Appointment Secretary, an ex
amination was given in San Francisco
which proved so successful that it
was decided to continue the practice.
