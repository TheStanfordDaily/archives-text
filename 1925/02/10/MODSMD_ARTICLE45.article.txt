## 
### 
Professor W. H. Manwaring of the
Bacteriology department is now working
on the physiological analysis of shock in
dogs. This research is of significance on
account of the similarity with traumatic
shock in man. Traumatic shock was the
cause of half a million deaths in the
world war.
At the present time Professor Man
waring is working on the nature of the
internal secretion of the liver which
plays a dominant role in this type of
shock. The methods used are liver trans
plantations and blood transfusions. About
twenty papers have been published by
Professor Manwaring during the last
three years, 011 the results of this re
search.
