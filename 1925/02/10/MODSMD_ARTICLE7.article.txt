# SEATS STILL AVAILABLE FOR RAM'S HEAD SATIRE
## Rehearsal Last Evening Indicates Success for Show Friday 
### 
DESPITE the heavy rush for Ram's Head tickets this afternoon, there are
still a few good seats available, which may be secured from the Alumni
Secretary in the Administration building. The prices are $1 and f1.25, with
all reats reserved.
Last night's rehearsal was held with a complete orchestra and full lighting
effects, and the results seem to indicate an exceptionally smooth and finished
production for next Friday night. Special interest was attached to the
rehearsal last night since it was the first time that the show could be viewed
in anything like the same conditions which will prevail on the night of
performance.
Mrs. Lanz has brought the dance numbers to a more finished state than any
Ram's Head production of recent years, and the difficult Russian dances will
be one of the most important parts of the show. The ensemble numbers, with

imore than twenty people dancing at a<
time, have been worked up to such a
degree that the performance Friday
night will approach professional stand
ards.
Dramatic scenes add strength to the
plot, too. Boris the Terrible cows the
villagers through his wicked helpers,
Stenka and Zatoff, who stalk on and
off stage like mighty lords; Satan him
self adds an atmosphere of brimstone
to the mists of sorrow that hang over
a feudal town; and captive Tartars
from far countries execute strange
dances under the lash of knotted
whips.
And then there is a cast that began
the four weeks' practice period untried
and inexperienced, compared to its
predecessor of "You and I," but wijl
trod the boards Friday a finished prod
uct. There really seems to be no char
acter work in "The Devil's Daughter"
—so dramatic* and absorbing is the
heavy atmosphere of music, strange
scenery, and queer characters —but Ely
and Evans have so cleverly combined j
characters with theme that the entire
effect is much stronger and interesting
for it. :
Dean Grunland, as Serge, and Dud
ley Chambers, as Vacha, are the butfs
of the cruel jokes of Stenka (Charles I
Simons) and his trouble-maker, Zatoff
(Jack Wiggin), the magistrate. Stenka
is the typical cowardly villain who, if
he could, would "frame" the Czar, King j
of England, Mayor of Palo Alto, and
Men's Council, but is frustrated in his
efforts to hang Ivan by an unexpected
visit paid him by His Majesty, Satan
the First, Allen Campbell.
Satan plays no little part in the pro
duction and makes things lively by his
frequent appearances and disappear
ances. With him come four little imps ;
who play havoc with modern ideas of
Hades being the land of fire and
molten steel.
