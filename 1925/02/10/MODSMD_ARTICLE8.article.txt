cina Basement 2, Delta Kappa Epsilon

Theta Xi Shows Fast Passing
Both teams showed some fast bas
ketball in the Theta Xi and Sigma Chi
clash, with the former having slightly
i the better teamwork, which pulled
thfim through by a four-point margin.
The first half furnished some close
|
guarding on the part of each squad,
although Theta Xi scorgd up a slight
lead, with Lawrence and Mulchay go
ing well down the floor.
In the final period the game opened
up into some faster basketball. The
Sigma Chi five staged a desperate
spurt, which brought them up nearer
to Theta Xi, but they were unable to
hold the pace, in spite of fast work by
Urner, Tremaine, and King. Theta Xi
did some pretty passing and more
j than doubled its first half score. Their
> floor work is probably the fastest yet
displayed in the intramural league.
Lawrence, Mulchay, and Schofield form
; a combination hard to stop.
Betas Win in Extra Period
The Beta-D. U. tussle was a htird
fought and rough game throughout.
'The first half closed with Delta Upsilon
j leading 3 to 2.
The second half furnished a bunch
of thrills. The D. U. quintet started off
with a rush and it looked as if the
game were on ice. But the Betas kept
j right on their heels and obtained a one
j point lead in the last five minutes.
; The D. U. squad came back with
| another point to tie the score shortly
j before the whistle blew. In the first
' overtime period neither side was able
to score, although D. U. missed a
chance at a foul shot. % In the final
stretch the Betas got a foul shot and
I clinched the game. Bushnell and Dave
i Mannoccir starred for Beta, while At
will and Hubbard were going well for
! Delta Upsilon.
A. K. L. Clinches League Lead
Alpha Kappa Lambda retained the
hold on leading position in League 5
by defeating El Capitan 17 to 12 in a
slow, uninteresting contest. A. K. L.
never had to get going and played the
sloppiest backetball that the team has
displayed this season. Barnett and Cor
nell found the hoop frequently for the
Row men, and Evans and Fraser
starred for El Capitan.
In the final game of the night Encina
3W had an easy time taking Branner I
into camp to the tune of 18 to 11. The
Encina team showed a stronger offense
at all times and were never in serious
danger from its opponents. Time and
again the freshmen marched down the
floor to put the ball through the hoop.
At times the Branner squad showed
flashes of form, but they were unable
to meet the work of Reasoner, Birnie,
Dorcy, and Spears. Krotz played a fast
game for Branner.
Tomorrow at 4 o'clock the Intra
mural Committee meets to decide the
dates and order of play-offs for league
ties and the schedule for the final
round. Any team may send xepresenta
times to the meeting, which will be
held in C. W. Davis' office.
In order not to interfere with Harry
1 Maloney's athletic circus in the En
cina Gym the following games on
Thursday will be played in the
Pavilion in place of the regular sche
dule: Phi Sigma Kappa vs. Delta Tau
Delta at 2 o'clock; Kappa Sigma vs.
Phi Delta Theta at 3 o'clock; Phi
