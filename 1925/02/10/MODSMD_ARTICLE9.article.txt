# PLANS MADE TO PRESERVE FAMOUS PALO ALTO TREE
## 
### 
' The Palo Alto Tree, which graces j
the University Seal, anil for which the (
city of Palo Alto was named, will be
the center of a beautiful garden spot
in the near future, according to plans
now being laid by the Palo Alto parlor
of the Native Sons of the Golden West.
Work has already been started on
the improvement of the grounds about
the tree by the organization which is
working with the city council upon
! the project. The plan calls for a lawn
! which will surround the tree. A huge !
rough-hewn granite rock will be placed !
in the near vicinity, and on it will be j
a bronze tablet bearing the history of
the tree.
For some time the famous old land
mark, estimated to be about eight hun
dred years old, has been undergoing a
i decided depreciation due to many
I causes. One of these, an insufficient !
I supply of water, will be remedied by
| the moisture which the tree will re
j ceived from lawn irrigation. Large de
cayed cavities have been scraped and
filled with cement by the Stanford tree
surgeons who also worked on the oaks
in the front of the library this fall.
In order to carry out the plan of
the garden it has been necessary for
the city to secure a lease from the
, Southern Pacific Railway Company

which owns the property upon which
the tree is located. A strip along San
Fruncisquito Creek, which is owned
by the city, is also to be included in
the project.
The Palo Alto Tree, now one of the
most famous trees in the world, was
first discovered in 1769 by Portola
when lie set out from San Diego for
Monterey. The ancient explorer missed
his objective and his followers dis
covered the long arm of the sea, the
San Francisco Bay, and a tall redwood,
which was later called Palo Alto. At
that time two branches were on the
tree but some forty-five years ago one
of these was broken off and only the
timely intervention of Senator Stan
ford preserved the other as it is today.
Again in 1774 Don Rivera and his
followers discovered the tree and made
plans to establish a mission upon the
spot. The plan was never carried out,
however, as missions were founded at
Santa Clara and San Francisco. The
landmark was soon recognized and
appeared on the early Spanish maps
of San Francisco as early as 1775.
The Palo Alto tree is the greatest
natural landmark between San Fran
cisco and San Diego, according to Mon
! signor Gleason, member of the com
mittee now planning the new project.
