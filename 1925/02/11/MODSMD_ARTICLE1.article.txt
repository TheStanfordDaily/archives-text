# STUDENT ELECTION NEXT TUESDAY TO DECIDE TIE VOTES
## One A. S. S. U. Office, Six Class Office Positions To Be Voted On 
### 
Another Quad election will be held
Tuesday of next week, according to
decision of the Executive Committee
at its meeting last night. Six class
officer positions will be up for voting
and one A. S. S. U. office will be
filled.
A new interpretation was made of
the rule concerning the case of a can
didate failing to get a majority in an
election. Under the new system only
the two receiving the highest number
of votes will be placed on the next
"ballot, whereas it has been the practice
to drop only the lowest candidate.
As a result or this no long series of
ballots will occur.
The Executive Committee officially
accepted the figures of yesterday's
polling as released and gave out the
results of the freshman class election.
