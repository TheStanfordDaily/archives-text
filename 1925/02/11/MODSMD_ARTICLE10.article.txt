# MARION DELANEY TO TALK TO WRANGLERS
## 
### 
In accordance with its plan of hav
ing leading people discuss topics of
general interest for the benefit of
campus residents, Wranglers' Society
is bringing Miss Marion Delaney here
tomorrow evening to talk on the part
of women in public life.
The specific title of her talk is "The
League of Women Voters and Its
Work." Miss Delaney was formerly
president of the San Francisco Center
of the California League, one of forty
five in the United States, and is now
head of the state organization.
The League is not a women's party,
but is supplementary to the existing
parties. It encourages women to choose
one of the larger parties and merely
aims to fit women better for their
duties as citizens.
The League, although not a party,
has lent its support to various acts
which it considers beneficial in char
acter. Among the laws for which it
has worked are those granting jury
service to women, t lie Sheppard-
Towner federal grant for maternity
| and infancy, and other legislation in
' favor of women and children. The
'League has also worked for community
property and for the Pacific colony for
morons.
Miss Delaney hopes to interest the
campus in the work of the League.
She will speak in the Women's Club
house at 7:15 tomorrow evening.
