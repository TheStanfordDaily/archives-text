# CHI PSI WINS LEAGUE 3 TITLE BY BEATING SEQUOIA II
## 
### 
Led by Johnny Menzics and Van King,
the Chi Psi's crashed through to a 26 to
5 victory over Sequoia II and thereby
cinched the title in League 3. The two
teams were tied for the lead before the
game. Sigma Alpha Epsilon won the
championship of League 2 without lifting
a finger when Sequoia I forfeited.
The other games resulted as follows:
El Tigre 11, El Campo 8; Zeta Psi 23,
Encina IW 11; Pirates 24, Chinese Club
0; Alpha Delta Phi 2, Encina 2E 0 (for
feit) ; Encina 2W 2, Alpha Tau Omega
0 (forfeit).
The individual work of Menzies and
King stood out far more clearly in the
play of the Chi Psi's than did coordina
tion of the team as a whole although they
did at times show flames of real team
