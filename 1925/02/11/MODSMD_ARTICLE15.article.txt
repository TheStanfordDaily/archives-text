# CHI PSI WINS LEAGUE 3 TITLE BY BEATING SEQUOIA II
## 
### 
Led by Johnny Menzics and Van King,
the Chi Psi's crashed through to a 26 to
5 victory over Sequoia II and thereby
cinched the title in League 3. The two
teams were tied for the lead before the
game. Sigma Alpha Epsilon won the
championship of League 2 without lifting
a finger when Sequoia I forfeited.
The other games resulted as follows:
El Tigre 11, El Campo 8; Zeta Psi 23,
Encina IW 11; Pirates 24, Chinese Club
0; Alpha Delta Phi 2, Encina 2E 0 (for
feit) ; Encina 2W 2, Alpha Tau Omega
0 (forfeit).
The individual work of Menzies and
King stood out far more clearly in the
play of the Chi Psi's than did coordina
tion of the team as a whole although they
did at times show flames of real team
work, and their passing was generally
fast and accurate. The winners turned in
their best game of the season, while Se
quoia, which has shown so well heretofore,
was obviously caught on an off day and
had great difficulty in finding the basket.
Sloppy handling of the ball was another
factor which caused the' downfall of the
hall quintet, as it enabled Chi Psi men to
slip through the Sequoia defense time
after time and drop in easy shots. Se
quoia trailed 17 to 4 at the half and scored
only one point, on a free throw during
the second period. Brown and Senior
hogged the limelight for the hall team.
El Tigre Downs El Campo.
El Tigre came out on top in a slow
contest with El Campo. The score was
11 to 8. Tigre showed improvement over
its performance in previous games, and
was able to sink the ball fairly accurately.
Neither squad exhibited a very high degree
of teamwork. Newton and Robinson did
good work for Tigre, enabling it to hold
a 7 to 5 advantage at the half way mark.
Schoen and Bigelow starred for El
Campo.
Zeta Psi played rings around Encina
1W in an uninteresting game, winning 23
to 11. The Zetes displayed real teamwork
in spots, but for the part trusted to
Ted Sproul to loop in goals. He did not
disappoint' them, as he rolled up twelve
markers. Encina never threatened, Zeta
Psi leading 14 to 7 at the half. Canfield
and Read shared leading honors for
Encina.
Chinese Club Shut Out.
Achcson's Pirates recorded the first
shutout of the intramural series against
the Chinese Club, annexing 24 points.
The Chinese tried hard, but were easily
brushed aside on account of their small
size. It must be said in their favor
that they have played every game on
their schedule knowing that they had
but a slim chance to win, a record which
few other losing teams can lay claim
to. lierz and Achcson led the attack
of the Pirates, while Ta'am and Wong
played good games on the floor for the
