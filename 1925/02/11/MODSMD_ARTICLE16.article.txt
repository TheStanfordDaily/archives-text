## 
### 
The group of sketches made by
I Pedro J. Lemos, director of the Uni
i versity museum and art galleries, dur
i ing a trip through Europe has aroused
1 so mucl, interest that it is being re
tained in the Thomas Welton Stanford
j art gallery beyond the time when it
was to have been taken down.
The collection is comprised of near
ly a hundred sketches in pencil, cray
! on, pastel, tempera and watercolor, of
j scenes in Greece, Italy, France, Eng
i land, Switzerland, Belgium, and Hol
land, and offers interesting notes not
| only along the usual courses of travel
; but in picturesque byways.
The sketches were made while Di
rector Lemos was directing oil studies
j of a group of art students on a tour
jof Europe. The wide, variety of me-
I diums employed 'is the result of the
; fact that pictures were object lessons
to the class to demonstrate various
ways of sketching outdoor subjects.
The collection has been exhibited in
a number of Eastern cities, and nearly
a third of the subjects were sold to
art collectors during these exhibitions.
The group was brought to Stanford
intact, however, since purchasers
agreed to permit their pictures to re
main until after the exhibition here,
j Several of the pictures were bought
Ifor reproduction in Eastern magazines.
Lemos, as editor of the School Arts
Magazine, is known as an art edu
• cator to thousands of teachers of the
| subject in America, and his contribu
j tion of art teaching methods and
I school art materials is recognized as
; a large factor in developing public
| school art.
