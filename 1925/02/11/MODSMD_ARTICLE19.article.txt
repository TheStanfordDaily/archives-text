# FRESHMEN OPPOSE ST. VINCENT [illegible] QUINTET TONIGHT
## "Husky" Hunt Has Developed Effective Yearling Combination 
### 
As its lust preliminary contest be
fore the California series the freshma
basketball team will face the Sa !
Vincents high school quintet in
pavilion at 8 p.m. tonight.
"Husky" Hunt, despite several ;
verses, has developed a strong fresl.
man combination. His team has lost
only one game during the preliminary
season and that was by the margin
of one point. Besides having assembled
a smooth-working aggregation he has
brought several future varsity pros
pects into the limelight.
At forwards the yearlings have Vin
centi and Crist. Crist's ability to drib
ble and pass, and Vincenti's accuracy
and speed enable them to work to
gether effectively. For substitute for
wards Hunt depends upon Moore and
Nye.
One of the most recent changes was
the removal of Clark from running
guard to center and the shifting of
Dennis from center to running guard.
This lineup has been used in the last
two games and has made a world of
difference in the power of the team.
At standing guard, Biaggini has
proved supreme. He is wide awake oh
the defense, and is accurate enough
when the opportunity presents itself
to sink a long one from behind the
half-way mark. Biaggini was "all P.
A. A. guard" when in high school last
year.
Little is known about the relative
strength of the Saints and the babes,
but it is rumored that the visitors are
bringing a powerful quintet. *
