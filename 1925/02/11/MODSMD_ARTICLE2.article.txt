# STANFORD GIVEN GOOD CHANCE TO WIN BEAR SERIES
## Cardinal Quintet Has One Game Handicap to Overcome 
### David Meiklejohn 
California's victory in the first game |
of the basketball series leaves the,
Cardinal with somewhat of a handicap
to overcome, but does not make Cali
fornia any more the favorite to win
than if the Cards had been on the '
victory side.
In the first place it was evident that
the Stanford players had lost much of
their early-season form. This is not
idle talk because anyone who had
watched the Cards play against
Nevada, the Olympic Club, and South
ern Branch, would agree that the
usual teamwork and baskA-shooting
ability was absent in the Stanford |
quintet last Saturday.
The California team looked good in j
spurts, but the score, 17 to 13, was a
good indication that the Bears could
be beaten.
The second game of the series will
be played in the Oakland Auditorium
next Saturday. California should have ;
all the advantage on this court due to
familiarity. The Auditorium court
holds a comfortable crowd, but the
make-shift, goals and the solid floor
make playing conditions unusually
bad.
There may be a few changes in the
Stanford lineup, although this would
be tentative throughout the game.
