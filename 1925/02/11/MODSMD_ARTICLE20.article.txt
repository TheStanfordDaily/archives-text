# NORTHWESTERN ACES HAND TROUNCING TO CARDINAL SWIMMERS
## Invaders Run Up 36 Points to Stanford's 23; Allen Shatters Record 
### 
Four nationally known swimmers wear
ing the colors of Northwestern Univer
sity handily defeated the Cardinal team
yesterday afternoon at the Encina pool
with a 36 to 23 score. Fast times in the
racing events marked the meet as a dis
play of high grade material.
One record went by the boards when
Arden Allen of the Cardinal squad cut a
full second off the Stanford-California
record in the 100-yard backstroke.
The visiting team composed of Rreyer,
Corbett, Howell, and Manowitz, took
five first places with Breyer high point
man of the meet', having fourteen and a
quarter points. Two other Purple men
came next in scoring honors with nine
and a quarter points apiece.
Besides Allen's contribution of five
points in the century backstroke, Dave
Fall came across with a first place in the
diving to bolster Erne Brandsten's squad.
Bob Williams came near to capturing the
100-yard free style race but was just
touched out by the flashy Breyer.
By the time the relay race, the first
event on the program, was Hearing com
pletion the fans watching the swimmers
! knew some high class material was per
! forming. The Purple men took the four
man event with yards to spare.
Corbett did all the divin gfor the vis
iting team and nabbed third place. Both
Fall and Gibbons were in fine fettle for
this event yesterday.
Sprints were next and the visitors' point
total rolled up rapidly. Of these the
century free style was the most hair
raising as Breyer and Williams jockeyed
for first. Facility in turning at each lap
gave the former the race.
Allen, in his record breaking race, held
his lead throughout. His performance
yesterday marks him as an almost certain
iirst place man in the California meet.
The furlong, another free style event,
at first looked like a Cardinal five-point
event as Stevenson led the field until the
last lap but lost out on the sprint at the
end, trailing into third place as both
Howell and Breyer passed him. Time in
this was rather slow but the winner still
showed power at the end.

gave the former the race.
Allen, in his record breaking race, held
his lead throughout. His performance
yesterday marks him as an almost certain
iirst place man in the California meet.
The furlong, another free style event,
at first looked like a Cardinal five-point
event as Stevenson led the field until the
last lap but lost out on the sprint at the
end, trailing into third place as both
Howell and Breyer passed him. Time in
this was rather slow but the winner still
showed power at the end.
