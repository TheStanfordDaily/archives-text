With the ending of William L. Wright's term as editor, three execu
tive positions on the Daily become vacant. The new appointees to these
posts assume their duties today.
Beatrice Flesher has taken Mary Baker's place as Woman's Editor.
Miss Flesher has been on the staff for almost two years, serving in the
capacity of reporter and later as news editor. During the first part of the
year she was in charge of the feature department. In her new capacity,
Miss Flesher will direct the work done by women staff-members for the
Daily.
A slight change in the designation of the Associate and Managing
Editors will take effect today. Since both editors do the same work on
alternate weeks, they will be known as Assistant Editors. Wallace W.
Knox and David Meiklejohn will hold these positions. It will be their
duty to take charge of the composition of the paper and one of them will
be responsible for its freedom from technical errors each day.
Knox and Meiklejohn commenced working on the Daily at the same
time more than two years ago. They have advanced as reporters and
news editors together and now they will continue together in making-up
the paper.
John Levi, Harry Bennett and Stephen O'Donnell, veterans of a
year's battle for supremacy among the reporters, find themselves news
editors. These men have all been assistants on the news desk since Octo
ber and have shown themselves qualified in every respect to assume their
new responsibility.
Steve, the signature which was attached to a large share of the contri
butions to Cabbages and Things last term, stands for S. F. O'Donnell, and
it is upon his shoulders as column conductor that the burden of being
funny will fall.
One additional reporter has been added to the staff. M. D. Eaton was
among those who were unsuccessful at the last tryout for staff positions,
but nobody could make him believe it. He has continued to turn in ma
terial which the Daily has practically been forced to use. And now we
don't believe it either, so he's 011 the staff.
