"Information rather than reformation —entertainment rather than con
straint," was the keynote sounded by Kenneth Stewart, the editor of
volume 63, when he wrote his opening editorial. And with this policy the
present editor heartily agrees.
This much policy is the outside maximum for immediate consump
tion. For a considerable time political matters have concerned members
of the Daily Palo Alto staff and these affairs have interested us as
much as anybody. Today we are sentimental about the election. We are
glad it is over and sorry that everybody could not escape disappointment.
And this is quite upsetting.
More students were interested in voting yesterday than ever before.
And, for this reason, their choices are more interesting. A majority out of
1,051 ballots comes as near to a vote of confidence as any candidate for
editor has had.
The late Mr. Cabbages thanks his supporters for their faith and their
ballots and takes this opportunity to try to assure those others that he
will do what he can to keep his allegedly villainous nature in check.
We're getting settled now. Business as usual.

STAFF MEETING tomorrow at 1:30 o'clock. News Editors meet
