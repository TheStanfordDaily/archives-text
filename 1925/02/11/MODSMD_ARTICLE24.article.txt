# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT
## 
### 
TIME:
When the "Kampus Klock" was
knocking out "two bells," last
Tuesday.
PLACE:
Before the ballot box on the Quad.
EVENT:
Five or six seniors trying to turn
in ballots that had been already
made out. Three or four other
upper-classmen trying to get
ballots (as well as several frosh)
all of whom failed.
CRITICISM:
In Monday's "D. P. A." the news
article said, "The ballot box is
located near the Law steps, and
will be open for voting from 8:30
in the morning until 2:30 in the
afternoon." When reminded of
this the ballot-box keeper said,
"I can't be worried about that."
And as a result the dozen "on
the job" were not permitted to
vote, and perhaps more —who knows?
—One of the Seniors.
