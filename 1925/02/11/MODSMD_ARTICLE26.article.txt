of every quarter, just as everybody is
beginning to feel optimistic, there ap
pears on the bulletin board of the
Administration building a large white
sheet of paper with names and num
bers printed upon it in black —VERY
BLACK—ink.
After that everything is different.
No longer can we go to the movies
with a clear conscience. No longer can
we persuade our profs that we "take
an interest in our work." The shame
is out.
Anyway one can't got any lower than
0-20 and it is impossible to flunk out
on a record of 4-30 or more.
The Bawl Out rivals Chappie as a
source of amusement and Edgar Allen
Poe as a source of depression.
After all, it's numbers that count.
Is the Scholarship Commitee fair?
63-21—42
14+28=42
therefore 63-21=14+28.
The fellow that got 63-21 flunked out
and the one that got 14+28 still has
half of his apples left.

from the Bawl-Out:
Ima Cow, Meadowfield Wt. 96+105
Eta Bita Pi
