# 145'S PREPARE FOR CALIFORNIA GAMES
## 
### 
Coach Hal Davis is putting his 145-
pound squad through some fast paces
this week in preparation for the first
game with the California lightweight
team Friday night at Berkeley. The
game will be staged as a preliminary
to the Card-Bear frosh game.
The second game will be staged in
the Stanford pavilion on the 20th of
February. Only two games will be
played unless honors are divided, in
which case a third game will be ar
ranged.
Several scrimmages have been in
dulged in by the squad and they are
showing signs of improvement in the
departments in which they are weak.
Inaccurate pasing seems to be the
common fault of nearly every member
|of the team. Coach Davis has tyeen
drilling them in this regard and the
| teamwork should, consequently, be a
I little smoother.
The California 145-pound team is
reputed to be as strong as the one
last year, which handed a beating to
the Stanford 145's. In* a recent game
with the U. of C. Dental College, who
defeated Stanford, the Bear light
weights were defeated by the close
margin of 18-13.
The Cardinal team has had the dis
advantage of a rather short season.
Very little practice was held before
the Christmas holidays. The California
team began work early and during the
vacation, playing eight games in the
j Southland, four of which they won.
Coach Davis is considering a shift
in the line-up by playing Smith at for
ward since his recent display of scor
ing ability. No definite line-up is de
terminable as several men have been
showing a marked improvement and a
few more changes may be made.
