"Control of the Mediterranean Sea
means control of most of the countries
of Africa," said Lieutenant-Colonel
Charles Wellington Furlong, Fellow of
the Royal Geographical Society, in his
illustrated lecture on "Saharan Lands
and Caravans," last night.
The people have many legends about
the camels, fpr the anmals have been
responsible for helping in the country's
progress. He showed slides of baggage
camels, as well as the ones used for
riding.
Men from the desert come in to the
camel markets to decide how much
tribute should be exacted from the
caravans. One of the largest caravans
Furlong had known of numbered 13,000
camels. Dr. David Barrows, of the Uni
versity of California, however, knew
of a caravan of 15,000. The caravan
refused to pay tribute, thinking it was
strong enough in numbers, but it never
reached its destination, all the mem
bers being either killed or captured.
Colonel Furlong conducted an ex
ploration of Patagonia, Tierra del
Fuego, in 1907-1908 for Harpers Maga
zine. Tierra del Fuego is the largest
island in Fuegian archipelago, the tip
of South America, lying below the
Strait of Magellan, while Pagonia lies
just north of the strait.
He also headed expeditions in the
Saharan lands, where he studied the
economic conditions of the country as
well as the people. Slides showing
scenes In the desert, and the people in
native dress, illustrated the lecture.
