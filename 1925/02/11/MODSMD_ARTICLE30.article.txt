# PRELIMINARY TRYOUT FOR IRISH MARATHON STARTS NEXT WEEK
## 
### 
The picking of the Irish Marathon
teams will start next week under the
direction of a captain from each class
and with the help of the track mana
gers. Twenty-four quarter-milers from
each class will be chosen.
Last season's winning senior team
I has graduated. This leaves the 1926
class with the most dangerous squad.
Last year's freshmen, that placed after
the sophomores in the last marathon,
are strengthening their lineup in the
hopes of turning the tables on the
class of 1926.
The juniors have the most outstand
j ing stars. Richardson, Gaspar, Kerr,
j Miller, Hyland, Crookshank, Lloyd,
I Scofield, Wells, Cypher, Clifford, Frye,
j Humphrey, Chase, Watson, and Carl-
I smith are all able to run the 440 in
I
j 54 seconds. Boles is the only man from
last year's lineup that will not run on
! February 28.
The 1927 class has the following
j men runing again this year: West,
j Babcock, Mr. Dougall, Garthwaite,
Doerr, Work, Meeks, Adams, Rich
mond, Cummings, Truman, Kleinsorge,
Eaton, Lee, Decker, Andrews, Herring
ton, Casad, Johnson, and Allen. The
sophomores have lost their best quar
ber-miler in Spencer, but there are sev
eral new runners trying out who may
take his place.
Although the race seems to be be
tween the sophomores and juniors
there is a possibility of the other two
classes upsetting the dope. This year's

seniors placed fourth last season, and
they are, furthermore, handicapped by
the loss of their fastest runner, Bill
Storie. They still have Campbell, I
Swayne, Smith, Dole, Hartranft,
Charles, Macßey, Leistner, Shermund,
Murphy, McLellan, Bledsoe, Thayer,
Dickey, Bell, Middleton, and Starr.
The freshmen are the unknown
quantity. They have some capable 440
runners and they have a large squad
to pick the rest of the twenty-four men
from. The 1928 men that are showing
best at present are: Bly, Nichols,
Moore, Smisseart, McGuire, Boarilon,
Raney, Anderson, Burton, Worthing- j
ton, Collins, Rupe, and Salsman.
"Dink" Templeton will select cap
tains from each das sto organize the
men. The teams will be picked by the
end of next week. This will give the
classes an opportunity to practice to
gether and learn to pass the baton
before the day of the race.
There is some talk of the Olympic
Club entering a team in the relay. The
Olympic Club will bring some men
down on February 28, and if he can
get twenty-four quarter-milers to- 1
gether, they will make the fifth team
in the Irish Marathon.

end of next week. This will give the
classes an opportunity to practice to
gether and learn to pass the baton
before the day of the race.
There is some talk of the Olympic
Club entering a team in the relay. The
Olympic Club will bring some men
down on February 28, and if he can
get twenty-four quarter-milers to- 1
gether, they will make the fifth team
in the Irish Marathon.
The picking of the Irish Marathon
teams will start next week under the
direction of a captain from each class
and with the help of the track mana
gers. Twenty-four quarter-milers from
each class will be chosen.
Last season's winning senior team
I has graduated. This leaves the 1926
class with the most dangerous squad.
Last year's freshmen, that placed after
the sophomores in the last marathon,
are strengthening their lineup in the
hopes of turning the tables on the
class of 1926.
The juniors have the most outstand
j ing stars. Richardson, Gaspar, Kerr,
j Miller, Hyland, Crookshank, Lloyd,
I Scofield, Wells, Cypher, Clifford, Frye,
j Humphrey, Chase, Watson, and Carl-
I smith are all able to run the 440 in
I
j 54 seconds. Boles is the only man from
last year's lineup that will not run on
! February 28.
The 1927 class has the following
j men runing again this year: West,
j Babcock, Mr. Dougall, Garthwaite,
Doerr, Work, Meeks, Adams, Rich
mond, Cummings, Truman, Kleinsorge,
Eaton, Lee, Decker, Andrews, Herring
ton, Casad, Johnson, and Allen. The
sophomores have lost their best quar
ber-miler in Spencer, but there are sev
eral new runners trying out who may
take his place.
Although the race seems to be be
tween the sophomores and juniors
there is a possibility of the other two
classes upsetting the dope. This year's

seniors placed fourth last season, and
they are, furthermore, handicapped by
the loss of their fastest runner, Bill
Storie. They still have Campbell, I
Swayne, Smith, Dole, Hartranft,
Charles, Macßey, Leistner, Shermund,
Murphy, McLellan, Bledsoe, Thayer,
Dickey, Bell, Middleton, and Starr.
The freshmen are the unknown
quantity. They have some capable 440
runners and they have a large squad
to pick the rest of the twenty-four men
from. The 1928 men that are showing
best at present are: Bly, Nichols,
Moore, Smisseart, McGuire, Boarilon,
Raney, Anderson, Burton, Worthing- j
ton, Collins, Rupe, and Salsman.
"Dink" Templeton will select cap
tains from each das sto organize the
men. The teams will be picked by the
end of next week. This will give the
classes an opportunity to practice to
gether and learn to pass the baton
before the day of the race.
