# FLORENCE EASTON BRILLIANT SOLOIST IN WAGNER CONCERT
## 
### Herbert Klein 
The San Francisco Symphony Orches
tra and Florence Easton, the soprano so
loist, scored a triumph last night in their
All-Wagner program in the Municipal
Auditorium. The concert was the last of
the municipal series and drew a crowd
that filled almost' every seat.
A personal ovation was given to Dr.
Alfred Hertz, the conductor, by the au
dience at the end of the intermission.
Florence Easton was enthusiastically re
ceived in every number and showed skill
and feeling in the difficult parts.
The opening number was the mystic
ally religious Prelude to "Parsifal." The
Bacchanale from the French version of
"Tannhauser." This was interpreted with
the help of a chorus of twenty voices con
cealed somewhere behind the scenes. After
the wild energy of the Ballet part had
subsided the voices were heard magically
blending with the subdued tones of the
orchestra.
The aria, "Elsa's Dream," from
"Lohrengrin" was the first' vocal number
and was given with almost perfect balance
between orchestra and singer. Introduc
tion to act three of "Lohrengrin" with
its stirring and brilliant march finished
the first group.
The Prize Song from "The Master
singers," was played. Next' came The
Entrance of the Gods into Valhalla from
the last act of "The Rhinegold." After
a stirring opening it closed with majesty.
The last two selections were vocal solos.
"Hail, Hall of Song" from "Tannhauser,"
and then the favorite of the progratrf, the
"Love-Death" from "Tristan and Isolda."
Miss Easton sang the difficult part with
ease and finish and her voice even when
it had to be heard against the full power
of the orchestra was never forced nor
harsh.
Announcement was made of the second
annual Spring Music Festival to be given
with a chorus of 600, four famous solo
ists, and the orchestra fn an augmented
form as the chief attraction.
The orchestra will be heard in its sec
ond concert in the Assembly Hall on the
31st of March. They have arranged to
include Deems Taylor's whisical suite,
"Through the Looking Glass," descriptive
of characters and situations in "Alice in
Wonderland." This number was intro
duced with great success by Mr. Hertz
during the past summer. As the work of
a living American composcr it has at
tracted much interest and favorable com
ment.
