# JOFFRE TRY-OUTS TO BE SUPERVISED BY J. G. EMERSON
## 
### 
Members of the Stanford team to
meet the University of California in
the Joffre Medal Debate will be chosen
tomorrow by means of regular try-out
in the Little Theatre. Probably three
men will be chosen.
The rules of the final debate provide
that the Medaille Joffre shall be
awarded to the best individual speaker
appearing in the debate. Each man
may choose the particular side of the
question on which he wishes to argue
with the single limitation that not
I more than two men from one univer
sity shall be on the same side of the
question.
The entire contest is extemporane
ous. Several months in advance a gen
eral topic is announced and an hour
before the debate opens a specific
question within the general subject
is announced. This year the general
topic is "France and the colored
races."
The debate is endowed and the
medal furnished each year by Baron
Pierre de Coubertin of France. It is
provided in the endowment that the
discussion shall be of some phase of
French policy.
The try-out tomorrow will be under
the supervision of the faculty debat
ing advisor, Professor J. G. Emerson.
Usually in the first try-out a squad is
picked, from which the regular Joffre
team is later selected. In view of the
fact that a squad is already at work
on another question which will occupy
the time of most of those who would
be eligible for the Joffre squad, prob
ably the regular Joffre team will be
announced tomorrow evening.
It is the intention of the Stanford
authorities to put forth a special ef
fort to win the Joffre medal this year.
A Stanford man has won the medal
for three successive debates: Knox
Miller in 1922, Bertrand Comparet in
1923, and Robert Littler in 1924.
It is rumored that Robert Lewis,
Stanley Weigel, and John Duniway of
the Oxford squad of this year, will
make a bid for places on the team.
Some of the others that have an
nounced the intention of becoming
candidates are Leslie Gossliri, Ronald
Button, George Crocker, Raymond
Bruce, and Hugh Lindsey. Past win
ners of the Joffre medal are not eligi
ble.
The candidates will meet tomorrow

tomorrow by means of regular try-out
in the Little Theatre. Probably three
men will be chosen.
The rules of the final debate provide
that the Medaille Joffre shall be
awarded to the best individual speaker
appearing in the debate. Each man
may choose the particular side of the
question on which he wishes to argue
with the single limitation that not
I more than two men from one univer
sity shall be on the same side of the
question.
The entire contest is extemporane
ous. Several months in advance a gen
eral topic is announced and an hour
before the debate opens a specific
question within the general subject
is announced. This year the general
topic is "France and the colored
races."
The debate is endowed and the
medal furnished each year by Baron
Pierre de Coubertin of France. It is
provided in the endowment that the
discussion shall be of some phase of
French policy.
The try-out tomorrow will be under
the supervision of the faculty debat
ing advisor, Professor J. G. Emerson.
Usually in the first try-out a squad is
picked, from which the regular Joffre
team is later selected. In view of the
fact that a squad is already at work
on another question which will occupy
the time of most of those who would
be eligible for the Joffre squad, prob
ably the regular Joffre team will be
announced tomorrow evening.
It is the intention of the Stanford
authorities to put forth a special ef
fort to win the Joffre medal this year.
A Stanford man has won the medal
for three successive debates: Knox
Miller in 1922, Bertrand Comparet in
1923, and Robert Littler in 1924.
It is rumored that Robert Lewis,
Stanley Weigel, and John Duniway of
the Oxford squad of this year, will
make a bid for places on the team.
Some of the others that have an
nounced the intention of becoming
candidates are Leslie Gossliri, Ronald
Button, George Crocker, Raymond
Bruce, and Hugh Lindsey. Past win
ners of the Joffre medal are not eligi
ble.
The candidates will meet tomorrow
in the Little Theatre at two o'clock
for the announcement of the question
for the try-out. They will be allowed
till three o'clock to prepare.

The College of the Pacific will dedi
cate a new auditorium in April.
