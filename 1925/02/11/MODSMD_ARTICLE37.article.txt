# Sophomore Women Defeat Senior Team in Practice
## 
### 
The sophomore women overwhelmed
the seniors in the practice basketball
game yesterday, totalling a score of
38 to the seniors' 2.
The playing was almost entirely
about the senior basket where the
sophomore forwards exhibited ability
to shoot from a distance as well as
from the favored positions.
The seniors were playing without
two of their best players, which was
partly responsible for the large score
of the second-year women.
