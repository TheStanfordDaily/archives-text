"Leland Stanford Junior University
—Organized 1891" —so reads the Uni
versity's seal.
"Founded May 14, 1887" —most stu
dents are familiar with this phrase.
But how many know where the
cornerstone was laid in 1887; where
the name-plate of the University is
located ?
The University cornerstone and
name-plate are located in the North
east corner of the Applied Math build
ing, which is the first one west of the
Memorial Church. Both have been
there for almost 38 years.
When Stanford opened in 1891, and
for several years following, the entire
life of the new college centered in the
Inner Quad. At that time the only
buildings which had been erected were
those which comprise the Inner Quad,
the exception of the living facili-

I ties, Encina Hall and Roble Hall (now
Sequoia).
Beginnings were made for the build
ing of the Outer Quad in 1899, at
which time the library was started.
This structure has undergone various
alterations and is now the Administra
tion building. Construction on the As
sembly Hall and Memorial Arch (razed
|by the earthquake of 1906) began si
multaneously, and in 1900 the corner
! stone of the Memorial Church was
laid. A place had been left on the Inner
Quad for the Church, and its erection
completed that group. Afterwards fol
lowed the construction of the Science
and English buildings.
When interrogated as to the location
of the University's cornerstone, many
students guessed any one of a dozen
places on the Outer Quad, as well as
every place on the Inner Quad but
the right one.
