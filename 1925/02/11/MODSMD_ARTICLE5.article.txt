# 1925 WATER POLO TEAM DEFEATS BABES IN FINALS
## 
### 
Playing raggedly with the offensive but
exceptionally well with the defensive tac
tics the senior water polo team downed
the freshmen yesterday afternoon by the
score of 4 to 0. This clash marked the
final event on the intcrclass swimming
meet program but due to a hitch in ar
rangements the winning class is not yet
determined.
Indecision on the number of points to
be awarded for the water polo matches is
holding up the announcement of the win
ner of the interclass swimming cham
pionship. It is expected that ten points
will be awarded to the seniors for yester
day's game thereby giving them the
laurels.
Both the freshman and senior sevens
had been showing rare form in their pre
liminary games and fans looked for a
scientific style of play on the part of one
Disappointment in
found in the weak
derclassmen and flabby
upperclassmen. The lat
however was practically
, the freshmen making but few
an half a dozen trials at the goal.
Schmeider Scores.
Schmeider after working his way well
up into the foreign waters was fed the ball
and knocked down the first point for the
1925 men. LaFibre, freshman goal guard,
started out well but let down considerably
in the second half. Score at half time
was 1-0, and seemed to indicate a hot
struggle for final honors.
Instead of gaining strength from the
respite the freshmen let down in the sec
ond half and failed to pierce the senior
goal while three more points were clialked
up against them by the upperclassmen.
Meyers made two of these goals and Lar
son one.
The lineup sent against the seniors yes
terday by the freshmen gave a good hint
as to their team which will meet the Cali
fornia babes soon. If the young Cardinals
brush up on a few offensive plays and ag
gressiveness in getting the ball they will
make a much better showing against the
California youngsters. The 1928 squad
that downed the sophomores though the
same men played was by far better than
that which lost to the seniors yesterday.
The upperclass aggregation on the other
hand was not the regular Card varsity out
fit and little dope on the probable
strength of the latter outfit can be gleaned
from the playing yesterday.
