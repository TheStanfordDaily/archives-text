# "DEVIL'S DAUGHTER" TO SET PRECEDENT
## "Nothing Like It Before" Is Catch Line ot Ram's Head Production; Cossack Dances Difficult 
### Douglas Meservey 
Certain catch-lines often originate
in the production of plays on the pro
fessional stage and "The Devil's
Daughter," although an amateur pre
sentation, has its favorite. That is
i the now oft-repeated phrase "Nothing
j like it before."
"Mike" Ely and Dan Evans said it
| when they waved the completed plot
I before the eyes of Ram's Head's play
committee. Director Mannocc"> said it
after reading the plot. Mrs. H. Lanz
said it when she finished the first week
of practice with her two choruses.
And now we say it after having seen
fifty-seven parts of the plot put to
gether; Mrs. Lanz put her twelve Cos
sacks through their paces; and heard
"Chubby" Tyroler play over the weird
Russian music for the chorus to stamp
out a few steps by.
Snappy Dance Steps
These steps, by the way, are more
like athletic feats than dance steps.
Someone has called them Cossack
dances. If they originated with the
Cossacks, as Mrs. Lanz emphatically
reports they did, it is not difficult to
determine the source of the Cossack
riding ability: dancing. Just a few
early-morning dances in the village
square and the Cossack's limbs are
well-loosened for the day's ride of fifty
miles or so.
The first day of practice for the Cos
sacks of the Stanford Farm was not
so easy, however, and the following
day Wallace Denny was called in for
a few hours' work as "rubber." Con
stant practice, though, has enabled
the chorus now to do their hand
springs, somersaults, and flips without
"tieing up" and landing in the foot
lights.
As for the music, it has received
little mention heretofore but has de-1
served much. The character of "The I
Devil's Daughter" does not permit of
many musical numbers but the few
that Tyroler has selected are as dis
tinct as the theme of the play itself.
The "Song of the Volga Boatman"
provides atmosphere for a scenery
change of the first act and is pre
sented by the entire orchestra of
twelve pieces. Following it is the open
ing dance number by Jack Wiggin,

"The Peasant Dance." Wiggin has
written both music and words with a
distinct Russian touch that is brought
out well by the full chorus.
Two Vocal Selections
The only two vocal selections are
rendered by Phil Urner as Ivan, the
wandering minstrel, with Bruce Toffle
mier as Peter, his brother, accompany
ing him on the violin. Ivan's first num
ber is the "Wanderer's Song," express
ing the minstrel's longing for the open
road, followed later by "Ivan's Love
Song" sung by Pat Kelly as Anna.
The latter was composed by Alice
Dodds who may be justly praised for
a composition far above the merits of
the output of "Tin Pan Alley." Russian
music has neither the theme, rhythm,
or expression of our modern popular
music—written for the dance alone —
but Miss Dodds has succeeded in
changing to the former style in a high
ly credible manner.
Two of the dance numbers have
been composed by Herbert Smith, '26, j
and Chet Barker, '18, of the Appoint
ment Office. Both compositions add a
great deal to their respective dances — j
the Devil's Dance and the Tartar
Dance —whose spectacular effects are
heightened by the weird accompani-1
ments.
Another innovation that Tyroler is
introducing is the use of a mandolin
guitar quartette in accompanying sev- j
eral of the musical numbers.
Two guitars and two mandolins com-,
pose the quartette and are to be used, [
with a violin obbligato, as the sole 1
music for the "Peasant's Dance" and
the opening number of the second act,
"The Gypsy Song." The latter is sung
by a sextette, garbed in gypsy costume
of original design, which opeuo the
act in an effective manner.
The purpose of the entire musical
urogram, as may be seen from the
ibove list, is more to provide atmos
nliere than to be an element of at
traction for the audince'B interest. As
atmosphere, the unusual merit of the
strains will be realized only when col
ored lights are thrown upon fantastic
settings and the audience is treated
to the entrance of Satan, a Tartar's
Dance, the Dance of the Devils, or the
far-away strains of Ivan the Wandering
Minstrel.
