Spring's Smartest Coats
Fashion, clever sorceress that she is, centers new interest in the slim, straight coat with this artful
trimming and gives a chic style-flare to this charming mode that is most appealing to smart Co-Eds.
Particularly does she favor the long silky haired furs such as fox, kit fox, king lynx, nat
ural skunk and zvolf. More so when they border the glorious soft-colored fabrics and rich
silks that make the mode of today.

Style experts have selected everyone. All are smart, all are becoming, all are youthful and flatter
ing. Displayed in a satisfying price range between $69.50 to $165.
