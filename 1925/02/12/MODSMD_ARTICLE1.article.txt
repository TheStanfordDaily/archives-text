# 1928 BASKETBALL TEAM WINS FROM ST. VINCENT HIGH
## Freshmen Experience Little Difficulty in Winning Last Preliminary 
### 
The freshman basketball team com
pletely overwhelmed the Saint Vincent
high school quintet by a 34 to 7 score
in its final preliminary game of the
season last night.
Coach Hunt started his first
Vincenti and Crist at forwards, Clark
at center,' and* Biaggini and Dennis at
guards. They piled up such a sub
stantial lead during the first fifteen
minutes of play that Hunt relieved
them and did not call on them again.
The Saints have had a very success
ful season, having won 20 out of 22
games played, but they proved power
less against any of Hunt's combina
tions. On the first play of the game
they scored ,a basket, and from that
time on failed to show any class.
Hunt's first string men looked better
than they have at any time during
the season. Their shots were dropping
in and they presented a formidable
defense.
For second-string men the freshmen
used Cliff Moore, King, the Bigelow
brothers, Davidson, and Reynolds.
"With the exception of Moore all of.
these tip the scales around the i
200-pound mark. Of the six, Moore |
and King made the best showing. King
scored five goals in about fifteen min- J
utes of play.
The score at the beginning of the j
fourth quarter stood 32 to 5 and so
Hunt gave practically every man on |
the squad an opportunity to play.
Seventeen men were used during the
game.
Because of the decided inferiority
•of the high school team the game did
not serve as much of an indication of |
the freshman strength. But it did give ,
the yearlings a good light workout
before they oppose the California
babes at Berkeley Friday night.
Following is the lineup:
