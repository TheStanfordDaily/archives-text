Kappa Sigs Win Easily
The Kappa Sigs pulled the unex
pected and disposed of the Phi Delts
in an easy manner. The latter team
I never threatened the Kappa Sig lead,
although a comeback was staged in j
the closing minutes of the game. The i
Kappa Sigs held a 7 to 1 lead at half
time.
Both teams showed power, but
Kappa Sigma was the more consistent.
They worked the best and fastest of
any game they played so far
and should provide plenty of trouble
for the other teams in the final round.
Middleton scored eight points and
starred in floor work, while Newkirk
and Hey were also going well: Rice
and McCormick provided the majority
of the fireworks for the Phi Delt five.
Toro Wins Close Game
After gaining a 11 to 6 lead in the
first period El Toro allowed Theta
Chi to slip in shots in the last half
and bring the score to 15 to 12. Toro
started out fast with the starting
whistle and rang up eight points in
quick order. After this submersion
Theta Chi seemed to find itself again
and scored six points before the half
was over.
In the second period Theta Chi
proved itself the stronger, although
it didn't have the power to pull
through the game. ,For El Toro Clifford
with seven points and Wright with
four were the stars. Sawyer and Dice
formed the best scoring combination
for Theta Chi.
Phi Psi Beat Delta Chi
Phi Kappa Psi defeated the Delta
Chi quintet 13 to 6 in a slow game.
Neither side had much speed, and
both missed a number of easy shots.
In the first half the Phi Psis allowed
their opponents only two points with
a shot by Rowles, while McCallister,
Wittenburg, and Knox did some good
shooting. Hood, of Delta Chi, found
the basket twice in the latter part of
the game, but his team was so far
behind that the shots served only to
close up the gap slightly.
In the other game of the day Phi
Kappa Sigma smothered the Alpha
Sigs 17 to 7. The latter team was never
able to get going against the strong
defense of the Phi Kaps, getting most
of its points on some pretty shooting
by Ferguson, who was easily the class
of his team. McColluch and Coen
starred for the Phi Kap squad.
