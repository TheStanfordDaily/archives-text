# THREE-RING CIRCUS IS SCHEDULED FOR PAVILION TONIGHT
## Large Number of Bouts Are On Tap in Three Minor Indoor Sports 
### 
Sixty-five men will compete in the
University novice championship for
boxing, fencing, and wrestling held at
; the pavilion tonight under the direc
tion of Harry Maloney. Only men who
have never seen action for the Univer-
I sity will be seen on the floor tonight.
Probably twenty bouts will be held
|in the boxing in the welterweight,
middleweight, featherweight, and
heavyweight divisions. As preliminary
rounds have been boxed previously,
1 only the semi-final and final goes are
, scheduled for the circus. *
Varsity Men Ineligible
In the semi-final bouts the first two
| rounds will be a minute, and the third
I will last a minute and a half. Varsity
men, who are not eligible for the
events, will aid Maloney in conduct
ing the bouts.
Twenty-two fencers have signed up
for the two classes being held. Eight
will compete in the senior novice
event, and fourteen in the junior
novice. The two divisions have been
scheduled in order to allow men to
run up against swordsmanship of their
own class. In the junior novices, Stro
'ven and Worner are expected to give
a good exhibition with the foils.
All of the fencers are new to the
Fencers Give Promise
sport. The seniors have taken it up
for the past year, while the juniors are
'entered in the class for the first time
this year. Several are expected to de
' velop the class shown by the Stanford
fencers in the past.
In wrestling four bouts are on tap
in most of the divisions. Only five
weights are open to competition, as the
, light-heavyweight division is omitted
from the program. The wrestlers have
been working out under Hal Davis and
will probably furnish some good bouts.
As the winners in the preliminary
round will have to tackle an opponent
in the finals, the time limit will be kept
down.
All three events will be going on
| simultaneously, so that plenty of ac
| tion will be seen tonight. Bouts will
start promptly at 8 o'clock in order to
i have the program run smoothly. Stu
dents will be admitted to the pavilion
j on their student body cards. Outsiders
! will be charged 50 cents admission.
