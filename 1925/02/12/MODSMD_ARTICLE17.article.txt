# Surprise, Surprise, Surprise!
## 
### 
A sport writer for the Daily Calif ornian remarks about the first basket
ball game played here last Saturday that the Blue and Gold won much to
the surprise of many major sport prophets, and of Stanford. To con
tinue his sentence for him, the Blue and Gold won much to the surprise
of California, for although that is not the sort of thing the scribe would
care to admit, it is probably true.
The last time Stanford jarred Berkeley into exclamation was Novem
l>er 22, 1924. The Berkeley boys were able to use the same ejaculations
that they thought up after the freshman football game. And now, in
basketball, it appears to be the privilege of the frosh again to teach the
Bears amazement.
Coach Hunt takes his 1928 squad across the bay tomorrow. He takes
a hard-fighting, goal-shooting gang which may or may not be inferior to
the Cub team. At any rate, if the experts who gave the California fresh
man football team the edge last fall feel the same way about basketball, it
looks very nice for tomorrow â€”and the next day.
Better come along to the party to holler, "Surprise !"
