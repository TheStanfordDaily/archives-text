Every once in a while the campus mobilizes its opinion and the inter
mittent fire of viewpoints becomes a fusillade, which makes us enormously
happy in all but one respect. The space in the Daily remains about the
same from day to day, and when too many long letters are received it is
something of an embarrassment to the make-up editor.
Now the make-up editor is a pretty good guy and, whenever it is pos
sible, the staff likes to help him out. Plenty of letters are desirable and an
effort is made to print every one, but when the opinions are too long they
sometimes squeeze each other out.
InÂ»the future all letters submitted to the Daily will be printed. To
make this possible, it may be necessary to eliminate parts of some. Two
hundred words are enough to state the case ordinarily, and the Daily re
serves the right to delete and edit longer letters to within reasonable limits.
