# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT

The Editor â€”Sir:
Recently several have mentioned to
me about the desirability of having a
better calendar service and have
raised the question as to having the
calendar itself cover more than just a
week ahead. Perhaps it would be suf
ficient to include in the anouncement
column all dates fixed even though
were a week or several weeks
ahead and thus be of very much great
er value to those who were seeking
open dates far in advance.
Of course anouncements only a week
ahead serve only those people who
are interested in attending the events,
but do not help very much those who
are trying to get open dates two or
three weeks ahead.
I understand that at Berkeley the
weekly calendar contains every fixed
date however far in the future and is
accordingly of very much greater
value to the public.
