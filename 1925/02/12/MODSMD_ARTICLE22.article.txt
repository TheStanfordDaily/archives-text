Lagunita is filling up rapidly; wise
students are doing likewise, mentally,
with required textbooks while this
weather lasts.
Plant seeds, as it were, while the
rain falls. When the sun shines hay
must be made —and canoes paddled.
On these pale blue days, when rain
comes down in a pale blue mist, and
we sit listening to a pale blue voice
pouring data into our pale blue ears
to be regurgitated into a pale blue
book — is it any wonder that a lake
that is not pale blue, but a good,
muddy brown, twines its fingers around
our hearts and sends us down into the
cellar to count the cracks in the dusty
canoe?
H. L. Mencken say;-, "One of the
tragedies of civilization is that so
many men miss their vocations." What
superb sailors for the American fleet
the daring fellows of Rum Row would
make, and how beautifully some of the
current admirals of the navy would
fit into the pants business.
And how perfectly some of our sen
iors would fit beneath a dink.
It is true that "the first shall be
last, and the last shall be first;" but,
when, oh Lord, will the change take
place?
Jf people would only go occasionally
by their feelings instead of forever by
their minds! Feelings never become
indignant—it is the "logical" mind that
makes a fool out of itself.
The idea that every student is a
great admirer of his alma mater is not
entirely true. What is true is that
every student brags immensely about
his college to those of a like institu
tion and vice versa. Neither of them
believes "the half of it, dearie."
