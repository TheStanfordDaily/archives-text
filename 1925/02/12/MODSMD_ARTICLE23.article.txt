Advance publicity stated that "So
Big" was Colleen Moore's greatest his
trionic achievement. We beg to carry
that statement a bit farther, and pro
ceed on a slightly different tack. "So
Big" is Miss Moore's only histrionic
achievement.
Partially because it proves such a
pleasant surprise, and partially be
cause it is good on its own merits, "So
Big" receives our official approval.
(We do not expect this statement to
produce a record box office run. This
pessimistic view is based upon the fact
that we fully expected the Palo Alto
theatres to go into bankruptcy last
week. They are still open, and for the
sake of the column, we rejoice).
Football really has little to do with
dramatic (or rather moving picture)
criticism. However, we are going to
draw upon a statement of one An
drew Kerr, eminent gridiron tutor, for
a statement which may explain why
we liked "So Big" When many critics
condemned it.
Kerr says that "he likes to enter a
game as the under dog. It puts him
in an advantageous position psycho
logically. If no one expects him to win,
defeat is not so disappointing, while
victory is more appreciated by his
supporters." When we sat down to
see "So Big" we felt much the same
as we did at the Big Game in 1922.
We didn't expedt much, because on
a basis of past performances there
were no groilnds to do so. Consequent
ly when Colleen Moore did things
which would be taken for granted in
other actresses, we were almost as
pleasantly surprised as we would have
been if "Scotchy" Campbell and his
followers had beaten the Golden Bear.
We have it on authority that the
original story of "So Big" is rather
badly mutilated in the picture version.
We don't care if it is. As it stands, it
manages to hold the interest. Largely
this is because Miss Moore makes the
character of Selina Peaks plausible.
The only criticism of the plot that we
could offer is that there are several
huge jumps in years without a satis
factory effort at connection. â€”S. O'D.
