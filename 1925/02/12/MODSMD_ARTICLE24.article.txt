# TRANSLATOR CALLS ARK A BARGE; IS A MODERNIST
## 
### 
Publication of a translation of the
Old Testament in which the most mod
ern terms were used was announced
recently. The Garden of Eden is called
a park, Noah's Ark a "barge," and the
i City of David "Davidsburg" in Dr.
James Moffat's new version. He is a
professor of church history in the
United Research College, Glasgow, and
claims that the Bible must be re
j written for each generation in order
to be properly understood. The phrase
ology of the day must be used in each
instance, he believes. â€” University
