# INTERCLASS RESULTS STILL IN DOUBT; TO BE DECIDED FRIDAY
## 
### 
Due to the decision of C. W. Davis,
director of intramural sports, to award
points for all four places in the inter
class water polo games, final results
of the interclass swimming meet are
held up again until the sophomore
junior game.
Points will be awarded thus: 10 for
first place, 6, 4, 2, for the remaining
places. As a result of the seniors de
feating th,f freshmen in the water polo
game Taesday the upperclassmen lead
in scoring honors with 42 points. The
sophomores at present are second with
38 points.
Friday afternoon, the probable date
set for the sophmore-junior class, will
decide whether or not the interclass
swimming meet will end in a tie.
The freshmen now lead the juniors
in points 19 to 14, and whether or not
they will hold third place is another
question to be answered, for should
the juniors beat the sophomores they
will put themselves third.
With the 1927 men owners of two
first places in the interclass all-round
tourney and a possibilify of their cap
turing the third, attention is being
centered on the game Friday.
