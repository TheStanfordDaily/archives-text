# RAM'S HEAD SHOW IS NEARING PERFECTION
## Rehearsal Impresses With Colorful Sets, Dramatic Moments; Dances Create Russian Atmosphere 
### 
LAST night's dress-rehearsal of the 1925 Ram's Head show, to be presented
tomorrow night, proved conclusively to those in attendance that "The
Devil's Daughter" will be the most startling innovation along dramatic lines
that the campus has ever seen, and that it will more than fulfill previous
promises regarding the novel of excellent dancing and colorful settings.
One of the best features of the production is that neither to the two acts
are very long, and the action in both is fast. The continuity is never broken,
a remarkable thing for a Ham's Head show, and every bit of action is neces-

sary to the proper development of the plot. In past years the productions
have had a tendency towards a conglomeration of relatively unimportant bits
of action, but not so with this show. Interest will never lag, for the lines are
clever, the situations well-constructed, and dramatic moments well inter
spersed throughout the whole play.
The playing of the orchestra, under the leadership of "Chubby" Tyroler,
was a revelation to those who have come to expect a hit-or-miss fashion
of accompaniment from a Ram's Head orchestra. Tyroler-has been able to

gather a very talented group of musi
cians, and the music will be one of
the high-lights of the show.
The last part of the first act will
be the most impressive moment in the
whole show, for it is here that
Petroushka, the "Devil's Daughter,"
makes an incantation and calls His Sa
tanic Majesty forth from the depths
of the earth. With the air of a spe
cially constructed device, the Devil
and his dancing demons suddenly ap
pear in the middle of the stage, and
while Petroushka weaves a spell over
a cauldron, the demons execute a
weird and gruesome dance. The stage
is bathed in a sombre red glow which
lends an atmosphere of terror to the
scene. This is expected to be the most
dramatic moment in the whole show,
and no effort is being spared to per
fect the details so that an impressive
performance will be given.
The absence of any "jazz" numbers,
the substitution of a real plot for a
series of unimportant scenes, and a
conscious effort for legitimate dra
matic effects instead of nonsensical
burslesque, will constitute the dra
matic bill-of-fare tomorrow night when
Ram's Head Society presents its ini
tial effort under the new policy of
satirical semi-serious musical plays.


Stenka, Chamberlain to Lord Boris of the Red Castle, and Zatoff, the
Magistrate, are trying to decide what kind of a death would best suit Serge
and Vascha, two villagers. One of the dramatic moments in "The Devil's
Daughter." (Left to right: Jack Wiggin, Charles Simons, David Evans,

Ram's Head Society presents its ini
tial effort under the new policy of
satirical semi-serious musical plays.


Stenka, Chamberlain to Lord Boris of the Red Castle, and Zatoff, the
Magistrate, are trying to decide what kind of a death would best suit Serge
and Vascha, two villagers. One of the dramatic moments in "The Devil's
Daughter." (Left to right: Jack Wiggin, Charles Simons, David Evans,
Dean Grunland, Dudley Chambers, Ward Poulson.)
LAST night's dress-rehearsal of the 1925 Ram's Head show, to be presented
tomorrow night, proved conclusively to those in attendance that "The
Devil's Daughter" will be the most startling innovation along dramatic lines
that the campus has ever seen, and that it will more than fulfill previous
promises regarding the novel of excellent dancing and colorful settings.
One of the best features of the production is that neither to the two acts
are very long, and the action in both is fast. The continuity is never broken,
a remarkable thing for a Ham's Head show, and every bit of action is neces-

sary to the proper development of the plot. In past years the productions
have had a tendency towards a conglomeration of relatively unimportant bits
of action, but not so with this show. Interest will never lag, for the lines are
clever, the situations well-constructed, and dramatic moments well inter
spersed throughout the whole play.
The playing of the orchestra, under the leadership of "Chubby" Tyroler,
was a revelation to those who have come to expect a hit-or-miss fashion
of accompaniment from a Ram's Head orchestra. Tyroler-has been able to

gather a very talented group of musi
cians, and the music will be one of
the high-lights of the show.
The last part of the first act will
be the most impressive moment in the
whole show, for it is here that
Petroushka, the "Devil's Daughter,"
makes an incantation and calls His Sa
tanic Majesty forth from the depths
of the earth. With the air of a spe
cially constructed device, the Devil
and his dancing demons suddenly ap
pear in the middle of the stage, and
while Petroushka weaves a spell over
a cauldron, the demons execute a
weird and gruesome dance. The stage
is bathed in a sombre red glow which
lends an atmosphere of terror to the
scene. This is expected to be the most
dramatic moment in the whole show,
and no effort is being spared to per
fect the details so that an impressive
performance will be given.
The absence of any "jazz" numbers,
the substitution of a real plot for a
series of unimportant scenes, and a
conscious effort for legitimate dra
matic effects instead of nonsensical
burslesque, will constitute the dra
matic bill-of-fare tomorrow night when
Ram's Head Society presents its ini
tial effort under the new policy of
satirical semi-serious musical plays.
