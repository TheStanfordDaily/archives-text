# Bahai Meeting Discusses Universal Education Need
## 
### 
"Universal Education" was the sub- |
ject of the Bahai meeting last night. j
Abdul Baha, speaking in America, j
said: "No individual should be denied |
or deprived of intellectual trailing,
although each should receive according
to capacity. All cannot be scientists
and philosophers, but each should be ,
educated according to his needs and
deserts." Universal education is one
of the twelve basic Bahai principles.
Refreshments were served following
an informal discussion.
A recent mid-year Biology examina
tion at Yale was given in the form of j
a cross-word puzzle.
