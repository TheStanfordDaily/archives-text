# FEBRUARY BIRTHDAYS
## 
### FEG MURRAY, '16 
jTlie Amethyst is the birth-stone for
February. It should have been the
diamond, for so many diamond lumi
naries were born in the second month.
In February come the birthdays ol'
Lincoln and Washington, outstanding
figures in American history. But Feb
ruary also gave us Babe Ruth, the
outstanding figure in America's nation
al game. The Big Bam was born on
the seventh of February, just a year

to the day after his teammate, Wally j
Pipp and Outfielder Charley Jamieson
of Cleveland first saw this world.
Another Yankee, Herb Penock, the
slim southpaw of Kennett Square, was j
born in February, as was Grover Cleve
land Alexander, the Grand Old Man I
of the Cubs' pitching staff. Four of the j
world's champion Washington team
came into this world in the month
made famous by Washington and Lin-1

coin. They are Peckinpaugh, one of
the heroes of the last World Series;
Mogridge, the.left-handed pitcher; and
Sam Rice and Muddy Ruel, who were
both born on February 20th. The Sena
tors owe a lot to the shortest month.
In picking an All-February Team
from the majors, we find an abundance
of southpaw pitching material.
Pitchers, Alexander (Cubs), Ring
(Phillies), and southpaws Cooper i

(Cubs), Mogridge (Senators), Pennock
(Yankees), and Smith (Cleveland);
catchers, Ruel (Senators) and Perkins
(Athletics); first base, Pipp (Yan
kees) and Seely (White Sox); second,
Tierney (Braves); shorty Peckinpaugh
(Senators); third, Toporcer (Cardi
nals); outfielders, Ruth (Yankees),
Rice (Senators), and Jamieson (Cleve
land). Six of this team hit over .310
in 1924. Not so bad!
