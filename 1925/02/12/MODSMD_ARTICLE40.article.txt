## 
### 
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA,
Feb. 11.—Carl Zamloch's varsity Bruin
baseball squad has encountered it's first
obstacle, rain. Continual downpour dur
ing the past week left the turf diamond
of the California Memorial Stadium in a
state resembling a discouraged sponge
necessitating the cancelling of preliminary
games with Ireland's Independents and
the Federal Reserve Bank nine, and caus
ing the practical discontinuance of prac
tice. One consolation is offered by the
fact that the weather is playing no favor
ites and lias retarded baseball practice at
Stanford in a similar manner.
Baseball managers at Berkeley are
making every possible effort to get the
field into condition for the three games of
the coming week with the Ambrose Tail
ors, the Anglo-California Trust Co., and
Ireland's Independents. If the predicted
storm reaches the bay region this week it

will make it impossible to run off these
games.
California's first intercollegiate base
ball game, to be played with Santa Clara,
will be held in the Memorial Stadium 011
March 4 leaving but three weeks for pre
liminary practice. Stanford meets Santa
Clara in two games before this time and
the Bruin-Bronco clash will furnish a
basis for comparing the relative strengths
of California and Stanford.
Duffy Gerlah's freshman baseball squad
resumed practice Monday 011 West Field.
Inclement weather is responsible for the
fact that' but few workouts have been held
thus far. The men are being divided into
teams and will play their first game to
morrow.
A new baseball field is being planned
for the University of Washington. It
will accommodate 4000 spectators.
