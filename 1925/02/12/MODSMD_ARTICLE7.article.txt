# BEARS FACE CARDS IN SECOND TITLE COURT CONTEST
## Absence of Higgins Held as Serious Blow to Bruin Hopes of Victory 
### DeWitt K. Burnham 
(Assistant Sporting Editor,
Daily Californian)
California meets Stanford Saturday
night in the Oakland Auditorium, in
what may prove to be the fastest and j
hardest game of the series. The game
will be called at 8 o'clock.
As the Bruin team took the first
contest of the four-game series from
the Cardinals last Saturday night, they
are conceded the edge in tomorrow ;
night's conflict, but they won't find I
this second game so easily won.
In the first battle the Cardinal team j
was clearly over-confident. They had
won every game of their schedule and
were expecting an easy time with the '
Bears. The California team, with its
fast playing and dazzling floor-work,
caught the Cardinals napping, and took
the game by a 17-13 score.
Tomorrow night Stanford will not be
napping. They were rudely awakened
last Saturday and with one full week
to gather their senses, it will be a;
different Red team that takes the floor. |
The California team is not fortunate. ;
Bill Higgins, the lanky center, who j
; gave a good account of himself in last
j week's game, has been laid up with
! an infected knee. While he will prob
ably be in a suit Saturday night, Coach
|"Nibs" Price will not be able to use
j him. He will be missed.
| Watson, from last year's freshman
1 team, will take his place. Watson is a
good man, but as he has not had the |
experience of Bill Higgins, he can't
ibe counted upon in a pinch.
Last week's game was played on the i
Stanford court. Tomorrow's game will
be played on a neutral court. The
California team is not playing at ,
home. The Bears have not been on j
the Oakland floor for three weeks, and
will not get a chance to work out
there before the game.
Coach Price is not expecting to take j
Stanford by surprise this week. He is
expecting the toughest game of the
series. His men are not over-confident.
They are tuned to a high pitch for the
game that will probably decide the
champion of the solthern conference, j
If the Bears lose tomorrow night it :
will put them on even terms with the
Cardinals again and all the good work
of that first game will be lost. If they
win, well

California meets Stanford Saturday
night in the Oakland Auditorium, in
what may prove to be the fastest and j
hardest game of the series. The game
will be called at 8 o'clock.
As the Bruin team took the first
contest of the four-game series from
the Cardinals last Saturday night, they
are conceded the edge in tomorrow ;
night's conflict, but they won't find I
this second game so easily won.
In the first battle the Cardinal team j
was clearly over-confident. They had
won every game of their schedule and
were expecting an easy time with the '
Bears. The California team, with its
fast playing and dazzling floor-work,
caught the Cardinals napping, and took
the game by a 17-13 score.
Tomorrow night Stanford will not be
napping. They were rudely awakened
last Saturday and with one full week
to gather their senses, it will be a;
different Red team that takes the floor. |
The California team is not fortunate. ;
Bill Higgins, the lanky center, who j
; gave a good account of himself in last
j week's game, has been laid up with
! an infected knee. While he will prob
ably be in a suit Saturday night, Coach
|"Nibs" Price will not be able to use
j him. He will be missed.

1 team, will take his place. Watson is a

experience of Bill Higgins, he can't
