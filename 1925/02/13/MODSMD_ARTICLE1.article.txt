# UNIVERSITY NOVICE TITLES DECIDED AT CIRCUS LAST NIGHT
## McCallister Takes Best Bout, Winning Welterweight In Extra Round 
### 
University Novice championships in
boxing, fencing, and wrestling were
decided at the "three-ring circus" held
in the pavilion last night. Eighteen
bouts in boxing and the five finals in
wrestling were held, while twenty-two
men competed in the fencing matches.
In the final bouts in boxing, the "go"
between "Dutch" McCallister and bte
venson for the welterweight title pro
vided the most thrills. Though both
men were tired from fighting in the
preliminaries and semi-finals, the three
rounds saw plenty of action. McCal
lister won by a narrow margin, after
an extra round had been fought.
In the heavyweight division Bert
Simmons scored a technical knockout
after flooring Stephens twice, when
Harry Maloney stopped the bout. The
start seemed to indicate that comedy
would be provided, when both men fell
down at the same time.
Heston Takes Middleweight
Heston outpointed McDonald in a
close fight in the middleweight finals.
Both men were fast, but Heston scored
more frequently. Swing carried the
battle to Willis in the bout for the
featherweight championship and came
out on top by a wide margin.
In the last two bouts of the evening
Feely won a close match from Crist,
after both men had battered each other
for the first two rounds, and Fain
scored heavily over Mustain for the
light-heavyweight title. Fain's better
skill in handling the gloves enabled
him to stop the repeated rushes of
Mustain.
All bouts in the final round were
three rounds of two minutes each. The
fights were evenly matched with the
exception of the heavyweight go, which
was stopped in the first round.
Ted Criley won the senior novice
championship in the fencing. In his
preliminary matches he won easily
over Adams and Eshelman. McDonald
furnished a hard fight in the final,
despite the fact that he had also com
peted in two boxing bouts previously,
and held Criley to a 5 to 3 score.
In the novice junior division Hal
Warner defeated Fred Sauer 5 to 3.
Warner won over Stroven and Coolidge
in the preliminary rounds and showed
good form in winning the finals.
Snitjer captured the lightweight
championship by defeating McNamie
in the final round. The match between
Rodger and Jones was declared a draw
after extra time had been allowed and
will be decided next week.
Willis, who also reached the finals
of the featherweights, in boxing, won
this title in wrestling by scoring a fall
over Oyama in short order. Fortine
took the battle in the middleweight
class from Hansen, while Cornelison
in the heavyweights handily defeated
Potts.

for the first two rounds, and Fain
scored heavily over Mustain for the
light-heavyweight title. Fain's better
skill in handling the gloves enabled
him to stop the repeated rushes of
Mustain.
All bouts in the final round were
three rounds of two minutes each. The
fights were evenly matched with the
exception of the heavyweight go, which
was stopped in the first round.
Ted Criley won the senior novice
championship in the fencing. In his
preliminary matches he won easily
over Adams and Eshelman. McDonald
furnished a hard fight in the final,
despite the fact that he had also com
peted in two boxing bouts previously,
and held Criley to a 5 to 3 score.
In the novice junior division Hal
Warner defeated Fred Sauer 5 to 3.
Warner won over Stroven and Coolidge
in the preliminary rounds and showed
good form in winning the finals.
Snitjer captured the lightweight
championship by defeating McNamie
in the final round. The match between
Rodger and Jones was declared a draw
after extra time had been allowed and
will be decided next week.
Willis, who also reached the finals
of the featherweights, in boxing, won
this title in wrestling by scoring a fall
over Oyama in short order. Fortine
took the battle in the middleweight
class from Hansen, while Cornelison
in the heavyweights handily defeated
Potts.

University Novice championships in
boxing, fencing, and wrestling were
decided at the "three-ring circus" held
in the pavilion last night. Eighteen
bouts in boxing and the five finals in
wrestling were held, while twenty-two
men competed in the fencing matches.
In the final bouts in boxing, the "go"
between "Dutch" McCallister and bte
venson for the welterweight title pro
vided the most thrills. Though both
men were tired from fighting in the
preliminaries and semi-finals, the three
rounds saw plenty of action. McCal
lister won by a narrow margin, after
an extra round had been fought.
In the heavyweight division Bert
Simmons scored a technical knockout
after flooring Stephens twice, when
Harry Maloney stopped the bout. The
start seemed to indicate that comedy
would be provided, when both men fell
down at the same time.
Heston Takes Middleweight
Heston outpointed McDonald in a
close fight in the middleweight finals.
Both men were fast, but Heston scored
more frequently. Swing carried the
battle to Willis in the bout for the
featherweight championship and came
out on top by a wide margin.
In the last two bouts of the evening
Feely won a close match from Crist,
after both men had battered each other
for the first two rounds, and Fain
scored heavily over Mustain for the
light-heavyweight title. Fain's better
skill in handling the gloves enabled
him to stop the repeated rushes of
Mustain.
