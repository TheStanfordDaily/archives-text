# 130's Clash With U. C. Before Varsity Encounter at Oakland Tomorrow
## 
### 
The 130-pound teams will open the
California-Stanford strife tomorrow
night, when they meet in a prelimin
ary to the varsity game at the Oakland
Auditorium at 7 o'clock. This will be
the first game of their scheduled two
game series.
Stanford's 130's started the season
poorly but have continually improved
until now they will make a strong bid
for supremacy over the Bear light
weigths. Out of five games they have
lost three, two to the San Jose "Y"
team which they played Wednesday.
In the second game with the "Y" team
the Cards displayed a very noticeable
improvement over the first game.
The lightweights have a fast work
ing offense led chiefly by Meyers who
has a good shooting eye and who drib
bles in efficient maner. Lee, at center,
lias been coming up in recent games
and adds to his good general floor
work a habit of ringing baskets occa
sionally. In Hobro, Coach Davis has a
very capable floor man who is released
from his guarding duties enough to
sink a number of baskets each game.
The five-man defense is worked to
good advantage by the 130's. Whether
it will be able to check the attack of
the California midgets is hard to pre
dict since the two teams have met no
common foe.
In addition to the above men, Coach
Davis will start Brockaway at forward
and Geary at standing guard.
