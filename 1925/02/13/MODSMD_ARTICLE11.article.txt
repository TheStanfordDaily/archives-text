# Ram's Head Presents Satire In "Devil's Daughter" Tonight
## 
### Douglas Meservey 
A new era in amateur productions will
open tonight when Ram's Head society
presents its 1925 production, "The Devil's
Daughter," at 8:15 in the Assembly Hall.
Director Dave Mannoccir has the dis
tinction of coaching the first Ram's Head
show of the new kind—so designated be
cause it marks a departure from the old
burlesque and slap-stick comedy. Satire,
with an excellent plot and dramatic
scenes, makes up this year's presentation

and should be a pleasant innovation for
a capacity audience.
Ely, Evans Co-Authors
Mike Ely and Dan Evans, co-authors
j of "The Devil's Daughter," were the
originators of the idea for a new typi
I of production and sought to follow the
| example recently set by eastern universi
ties in using satire as a basis for tbc
plot. "The Devil's Daughter" is a two
act satire on Russian life, with the ttsua
morbid atmosphere, village dances, feuda
lords, and gruesome witches giving loca
color.
More attention has been paid to dra

matic sets this year and the results are
the skillfully designed effects. One has
to do with the appearance of Satan (Alan
| Campbell) at the call of his daughter,
Mother Petroushka (John Truman), the
witch. Modern magic and science have
made it possible for Satan to appear and
disappear in clouds of smoke as one of
the surprise for tonight, and Truman
does some real character work as
Petroushka, the witch.
Unusual dances, some executed while

colored lights arc cast upon the dancers,
I form another item of dramatic effect.
' One, the Devil's Dance, takes place un
! dcr the watchful eye of Satan himself,
| while green lights shine upon the flash
i ing bodies of four imps from Satan's
! palace. Another, the Dance of the Tar
| tars, takes only two minutes, but the
audience is kept tense while four captive
| Tartars are made to dance for Boris of
I the Iron Hand by means of frequent
lashes from rawhide whips.
