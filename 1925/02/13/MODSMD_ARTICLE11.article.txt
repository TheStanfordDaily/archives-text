# Ram's Head Presents Satire In "Devil's Daughter" Tonight
## 
### Douglas Meservey 
A new era in amateur productions will
open tonight when Ram's Head society
presents its 1925 production, "The Devil's
Daughter," at 8:15 in the Assembly Hall.
Director Dave Mannoccir has the dis
tinction of coaching the first Ram's Head
show of the new kind—so designated be
cause it marks a departure from the old
burlesque and slap-stick comedy. Satire,
with an excellent plot and dramatic
scenes, makes up this year's presentation

and should be a pleasant innovation for
a capacity audience.
Ely, Evans Co-Authors
Mike Ely and Dan Evans, co-authors
j of "The Devil's Daughter," were the
originators of the idea for a new typi
I of production and sought to follow the
| example recently set by eastern universi
ties in using satire as a basis for tbc
plot. "The Devil's Daughter" is a two
act satire on Russian life, with the ttsua
morbid atmosphere, village dances, feuda
lords, and gruesome witches giving loca
color.
More attention has been paid to dra

matic sets this year and the results are
the skillfully designed effects. One has
to do with the appearance of Satan (Alan
| Campbell) at the call of his daughter,
Mother Petroushka (John Truman), the
witch. Modern magic and science have
made it possible for Satan to appear and
disappear in clouds of smoke as one of
the surprise for tonight, and Truman
does some real character work as
Petroushka, the witch.
Unusual dances, some executed while

colored lights arc cast upon the dancers,
I form another item of dramatic effect.
' One, the Devil's Dance, takes place un
! dcr the watchful eye of Satan himself,
| while green lights shine upon the flash
i ing bodies of four imps from Satan's
! palace. Another, the Dance of the Tar
| tars, takes only two minutes, but the
audience is kept tense while four captive
| Tartars are made to dance for Boris of
I the Iron Hand by means of frequent
lashes from rawhide whips.
Satire Prevails
A great deal of comedy must not be


From Left to Right: Horine, Roberts, Mason, Hastings, Graves, and Lane
expected tonight, for the plot itself was
purposely directed toward another end—
satirical drama with a few light touches
and effective action. Continuity has also
been stressed and the audience is not al
lowed to lose interest at any time through
the frequent introduction of the element
of surprise. Ely and Evans have an
unusual way of introducing their char
acters and action.
Mannoccir has worked with a
cast, necessary to the plot, but it has lost
its touches of crudeness in the past few
rehearsals. The leads, particularly, have
caused him little trouble. Phil Urner as
Ivan, the wandering minstrel, and Pat
Kelly, as Anna the peasant girl, make
a perfect combination. Urner carries the
part of a light-hearted minstrel well and
possesses a good singing voice. Kelly's
part is heavier as the peasant girl, who
is the object of the love of women, but
his voice, face, and poise are well adapt
ed to the role.
Dean Grunland as Serge, although he
has no opposite, has risen fast "from the
ranks" (of last year's chorus) and car
ries a minor lead with great ability and
energy. His role is a varied one, having
no one characteristic.
Simons Well Placed
Charles Simons is well placed in his
usual role as the "heavy." This time it
is the part of Stenka, Chamberlain of the
Castle and underling of Boris of the Red
Castle, and Simons does his usual "domi
nating" in an effective manner, lending
strength to the scenes of which he is a
part.
The chorus and dances, while not as
conspicuous as formerly, are neverthe
less an important part of the "Devil's
Daughter." Both lend colorful atmos
phere to scenes laid in the village and the
courtyard. The chorus, with its bright
costumes, will not be forgotten for some
time.
With the chorus used in only a few
dances, Mrs. Lanz, director, has had op
portunity to originate and execute sev
eral dances. The best, undoubtedly, of
the peasant chorus is one of the open
ing numbers and from its difficult steps
it is thought that speculation will arise as
to possible professionals in Stanford dra
matics—so well done are the numbers.
After twenty years the system of
afternoon classes was recently re
sumed at Princeton. Under the new
system students will have classes for
a part of the afternoon until 2:15.
Previous to this time there were no
afternoon classes.

A new era in amateur productions will
open tonight when Ram's Head society
presents its 1925 production, "The Devil's
Daughter," at 8:15 in the Assembly Hall.
Director Dave Mannoccir has the dis
tinction of coaching the first Ram's Head
show of the new kind—so designated be
cause it marks a departure from the old
burlesque and slap-stick comedy. Satire,
with an excellent plot and dramatic
scenes, makes up this year's presentation

Ely, Evans Co-Authors
Mike Ely and Dan Evans, co-authors
j of "The Devil's Daughter," were the
originators of the idea for a new typi
I of production and sought to follow the
| example recently set by eastern universi
ties in using satire as a basis for tbc
plot. "The Devil's Daughter" is a two
act satire on Russian life, with the ttsua
morbid atmosphere, village dances, feuda
lords, and gruesome witches giving loca
color.
More attention has been paid to dra

matic sets this year and the results are
the skillfully designed effects. One has
to do with the appearance of Satan (Alan
| Campbell) at the call of his daughter,
Mother Petroushka (John Truman), the
witch. Modern magic and science have
made it possible for Satan to appear and
disappear in clouds of smoke as one of
the surprise for tonight, and Truman
does some real character work as
Petroushka, the witch.
Unusual dances, some executed while

colored lights arc cast upon the dancers,
I form another item of dramatic effect.
' One, the Devil's Dance, takes place un
! dcr the watchful eye of Satan himself,
| while green lights shine upon the flash
i ing bodies of four imps from Satan's
! palace. Another, the Dance of the Tar
| tars, takes only two minutes, but the
audience is kept tense while four captive
| Tartars are made to dance for Boris of
I the Iron Hand by means of frequent
lashes from rawhide whips.
Satire Prevails
A great deal of comedy must not be


From Left to Right: Horine, Roberts, Mason, Hastings, Graves, and Lane
expected tonight, for the plot itself was
purposely directed toward another end—
satirical drama with a few light touches
and effective action. Continuity has also
been stressed and the audience is not al
lowed to lose interest at any time through
the frequent introduction of the element
of surprise. Ely and Evans have an
unusual way of introducing their char
acters and action.
Mannoccir has worked with a
cast, necessary to the plot, but it has lost
its touches of crudeness in the past few
rehearsals. The leads, particularly, have
caused him little trouble. Phil Urner as
Ivan, the wandering minstrel, and Pat
Kelly, as Anna the peasant girl, make
a perfect combination. Urner carries the
part of a light-hearted minstrel well and
possesses a good singing voice. Kelly's
part is heavier as the peasant girl, who
is the object of the love of women, but
his voice, face, and poise are well adapt
ed to the role.
Dean Grunland as Serge, although he
has no opposite, has risen fast "from the
ranks" (of last year's chorus) and car
ries a minor lead with great ability and
energy. His role is a varied one, having
no one characteristic.
Simons Well Placed
Charles Simons is well placed in his
usual role as the "heavy." This time it
is the part of Stenka, Chamberlain of the
Castle and underling of Boris of the Red
Castle, and Simons does his usual "domi
nating" in an effective manner, lending
strength to the scenes of which he is a
part.
The chorus and dances, while not as
conspicuous as formerly, are neverthe
less an important part of the "Devil's
Daughter." Both lend colorful atmos
phere to scenes laid in the village and the
courtyard. The chorus, with its bright
costumes, will not be forgotten for some
time.

Castle, and Simons does his usual "domi
nating" in an effective manner, lending
strength to the scenes of which he is a
part.
The chorus and dances, while not as
conspicuous as formerly, are neverthe
less an important part of the "Devil's
Daughter." Both lend colorful atmos
phere to scenes laid in the village and the
courtyard. The chorus, with its bright
costumes, will not be forgotten for some
time.
With the chorus used in only a few
dances, Mrs. Lanz, director, has had op
portunity to originate and execute sev
eral dances. The best, undoubtedly, of
the peasant chorus is one of the open
ing numbers and from its difficult steps
it is thought that speculation will arise as
to possible professionals in Stanford dra
matics—so well done are the numbers.
After twenty years the system of

A new era in amateur productions will
open tonight when Ram's Head society
presents its 1925 production, "The Devil's
Daughter," at 8:15 in the Assembly Hall.
Director Dave Mannoccir has the dis
tinction of coaching the first Ram's Head
show of the new kind—so designated be
cause it marks a departure from the old
burlesque and slap-stick comedy. Satire,
with an excellent plot and dramatic
scenes, makes up this year's presentation

and should be a pleasant innovation for
a capacity audience.
Ely, Evans Co-Authors
Mike Ely and Dan Evans, co-authors
j of "The Devil's Daughter," were the
originators of the idea for a new typi
I of production and sought to follow the
| example recently set by eastern universi
ties in using satire as a basis for tbc
plot. "The Devil's Daughter" is a two
act satire on Russian life, with the ttsua
morbid atmosphere, village dances, feuda
lords, and gruesome witches giving loca
color.
More attention has been paid to dra

matic sets this year and the results are
the skillfully designed effects. One has
to do with the appearance of Satan (Alan
| Campbell) at the call of his daughter,
Mother Petroushka (John Truman), the
witch. Modern magic and science have
made it possible for Satan to appear and
disappear in clouds of smoke as one of
the surprise for tonight, and Truman
does some real character work as
Petroushka, the witch.
Unusual dances, some executed while

colored lights arc cast upon the dancers,
I form another item of dramatic effect.
' One, the Devil's Dance, takes place un
! dcr the watchful eye of Satan himself,
| while green lights shine upon the flash
i ing bodies of four imps from Satan's
! palace. Another, the Dance of the Tar
| tars, takes only two minutes, but the
audience is kept tense while four captive
| Tartars are made to dance for Boris of
I the Iron Hand by means of frequent
lashes from rawhide whips.
Satire Prevails
A great deal of comedy must not be


From Left to Right: Horine, Roberts, Mason, Hastings, Graves, and Lane
expected tonight, for the plot itself was
purposely directed toward another end—
satirical drama with a few light touches
and effective action. Continuity has also
been stressed and the audience is not al
lowed to lose interest at any time through
the frequent introduction of the element
of surprise. Ely and Evans have an
unusual way of introducing their char
acters and action.
Mannoccir has worked with a
cast, necessary to the plot, but it has lost
its touches of crudeness in the past few
rehearsals. The leads, particularly, have
caused him little trouble. Phil Urner as
Ivan, the wandering minstrel, and Pat
Kelly, as Anna the peasant girl, make
a perfect combination. Urner carries the
part of a light-hearted minstrel well and
possesses a good singing voice. Kelly's
part is heavier as the peasant girl, who
is the object of the love of women, but
his voice, face, and poise are well adapt
ed to the role.
Dean Grunland as Serge, although he
has no opposite, has risen fast "from the
ranks" (of last year's chorus) and car
ries a minor lead with great ability and
energy. His role is a varied one, having
no one characteristic.
Simons Well Placed
Charles Simons is well placed in his
usual role as the "heavy." This time it
is the part of Stenka, Chamberlain of the
Castle and underling of Boris of the Red
Castle, and Simons does his usual "domi
nating" in an effective manner, lending
strength to the scenes of which he is a
part.
