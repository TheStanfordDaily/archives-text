# Scrubbing Red Popular Sport Among U. C. Babes; "C" Undergoes Washout
## 
### 
Freshmen of the University of Cali
fornia are reported busily engaged in
removing a coat of brilliant red paint
from the surface of their revered "C"
which normally outlines the hill in
back of the Berkeley campus with the
golden color of the Bears #
A few place blame upon students of
Stanford, whose "Cardinal" has al
ways flaunted the spirit and challenge
of the "Sons of the Stanford Red."
Little belief is placed in this view of
the transfiguration of the "C" due to
the agreement of co-operation in sup
pressing such rivalry between the two
institutions in athletic "contests.
