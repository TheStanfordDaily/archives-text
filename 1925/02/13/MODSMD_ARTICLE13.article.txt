# OLYMPIC CLUB NINE TACKLES CARD BALL PLAYERS TOMORROW
## 
### 
If the grounds arc dry enough, Stan
ford's baseball squad will be host to the
Olympic Club at 2:30 tomorrow after
noon. Rain prevented the game sched
uled with the Post-streeters last Satur-;
day, so Wolter's men have not performed j
against- organized competition since they
were defeated by the Kenealy Seals two
weeks ago. Â»
Unfavorable weather conditions have J
prevented the Cards from practicing dur- j
ing the past week, but the Olympics have j
been similarly handicapped, so that if i
the two teams get together tomorrow it j
is unlikely that they will show a par
ticularly fast brand of ball.
In their only start this season the club
nine defeated Santa Clara, 5 to 3, and a
number of individual players showed I
promising strength. The team which will j
invade the campus is made up of Coast
Leaguers and San Francisco Winter
League stars, who have had considerable
experience, such as Barry, Salt Lake
shortstop, and Wellman, a right fielder,
who led the Winter League in batting
last year.
Olympics Hard Hitters
While the Olympics have not had an
opportunity to develop much teamwork,
they make up for this deficiency by their
slugging ability. Starascinich, the first
sacker, pulled the dime-novel stunt in
the Bronco game by hitting a homer over
the center field wall with three men on
base. Wellman and Heckendorf, who
bat from the left side of the plate, proved
themselves especially dangerous with the
bat.
The Cards have not ygt succeeded in
breaking into the win column, but they
have nevertheless played good ball and
improved with every contcst. Their chief
weakness lies in the fact that they have
not found their batting eye. Johnson and
McCandless have done most of the
pounding so far, but the varisty should
get going in this respect by tomorrow.
It had the same trouble last year, but
came out of the slump in fine shape for
the California series.
Wolter can rely for mound duty upon
Oviatt, Tcague, Collins, and Hunter,
with the first-named man a slight favor
ite on past performance. The chances
are that more than one hurler will be
given a chance to get into action tomor
row. Solomon will hold down the back
stop job and practically the same line-up
will be used in the field.
