## 
### 
As a preliminary to tomorrow's game
with the University of Arizona polo team,
the Stanford poloists, now in Arizona,
today play an outfit made up of army
officers of the University of Arizona
R.O.T.C. unit.
This game will provide the Stanford
men with an opportunity to "get ac
quainted with" the horses which have
been furnished them through the cour
tesy of the Arizona team, and which the
Cards will ride tomorrow.
The Stanford men should have little
trouble in winning today's game, but the
tilt tomorrow will be a different story.
The University of Arizona team last year
was chosen to represent the West against
Princeton in a series for the National
Tntcrcollegiate championship. Princeton
won, but only after a hard tussle with
the Westerners.
The Arizonans are figured to be about
as good this year as last, and if Stan
ford can pull through with a victory
prospects for another Pacific Coast
championship will be considerably
i brighter.
