Berkeley is upset again over a coat of red paint on the hillside "C."
This time, however, the news comes to Stanford purely as information.
The Californians accept Student Body President Beardsley's protestation
that Stanford had nothing to do with it, without debate, for the last time
the letter glowed it was discovered that a Berkeley high school squad had
done the deed.
Now, the Daily is all for giving credit where credit is due. We would
like to go on record as recommending that the undergraduates across the
bay give a vote of thanks to the Stanford athletic teams. It is plain that
if the Cardinal varsities had not been giving such good account of them
selves lately the prep school lads would be quite indifferent to the color of
the big "C
The preservative qualities of paint are well known. In preventing
deterioration by the elements, paint has no superior. These intermittent
coats of red have a great deal to do with keeping the big "C" BIG for this
reason. And that should please California. They should be glad that
somebody cares enough to buy the necessary paint. If they had to wait for
the legislature to appropriate a paint fund, the decorative advertisement
of their puissance would have long ago mouldered away into a dusty
streak.
We are glad the thing got painted. Let's have an even bigger and bet
ter "C." There would then be a bigger and better victory for the bigger
and better "S."
