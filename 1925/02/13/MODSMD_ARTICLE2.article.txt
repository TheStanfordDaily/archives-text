# FIRST-YEAR BASEBALL TEAM SCHEDULED TO PLAY ST. IGNATIUS
## 
### 
Weather permitting, Cardinal fresh
man baseballers will go into action
against St. Ignatius at 10 o'clock to-,
morrow morning on the yearling dia
mond.
Little is known of the power of St.
Ignatius, but judging from the show
ing of the first-year men in their only
game of the season when they took a
pick-up team from Palo Alto into camp
by an 8 to 4 score, they should give a
good account of themselves.
Philippi and Sobieski, who did the
hurling against the Palo Altans,
showed a lot of good material for an
early-season game and held their op
ponents to a few scattered hits.
Sypher, the catcher, is one of the best
men on the squad. The freshmen
demonstrated that they are a hard
hitting outfit, and if they make the
customary progress as the season ad
vances they will do an untold amount
of pounding against California.
Garibaldi, at second, and Maguire,
Sims, and Nissen, outfielders, are the
most dangerous sluggers. Bush at
short, Price at third, and Thompson at
first are all fast fielders, Bush in par
ticular showing a great deal of prom
ise. With more experience the babes
should develop into a formidable ag
gregation.
