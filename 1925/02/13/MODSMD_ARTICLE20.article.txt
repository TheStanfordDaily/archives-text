Students of the University of Athens have sent the following message
to the undergraduates at Stanford through the courtesy of Ch. Simo
poulos, the Minister of Greece at Washington:
"The students of the National University, Athens, address vigorous
protests to their colleagues of universities throughout the civilized world
against the act of brute force whereby the Turks expelled the Primate of
our Holy Church from the See which has been respected throughout ages.
This act unhappily widens the breach between the two nations and frus
trates all efforts to bring the nations together in works of peace. We trust
our just cause will have your entire sympathy and support."
One man has offered already to speak to his 1 urkish acquaintances.
Another has changed his brand of cigarettes. Everybody has laughed.
Yet the incident itself is interesting. Such a resolution as this is as
indicative of the difference between European students and American
university men as anything could be. The Scottish students riot over par
liamentary elections. The Greek students are justly outraged at this ejec
tion of their reverend Primate.
U. S. C. publishes a "White Book" explaining that side of the recent
break in athletic relations with Stanford and California. And that's all
right, too.
The point of the matter is that maybe it isn't all roses for a Rhodes
scholar after all. At any rate, our Mediterranean colleagues deserve the
little sympathy we can give them. Drat the Moslems!

TO THOSE WHO FOREGO the gripping stories in the Daily news
columns in favor of this larger type, we recommend "The Devil's Daugh
ter," the musical drama which will be presented this evening by the Ram's
Head Society. The dress rehearsal indicated a highly entertaining per
formance for tonight.

BECAUSE OF A CONSTITUTIONAL choice of words, the As
sistant Editors of the Daily will have to be known in the future as Man
