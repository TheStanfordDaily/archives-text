G. B. Crabb, Chairman of the Board,
stated in regard to those students who
are objecting to these new rulings,
that (as has often been said before)
J those who are discontented are per-
I fectly welcome to leave. There is a
! long waiting list of people who are
: perfectly willing to live under the new
rules.
The Board has made a large appro
priation for buying up a stock of the
replaceable stomachs invented by Dr.
Carl Snipper (a Leland Stanford grad
uate) for college students who wear
out their original digestive organs—
from overeating, it is said. —M.D.E.
Professor Franz Rickaby, formerly
of he English faculty of the University
of North Dakota, and now of Pomona
College, has compiled a volume of log
: ging camp ballads. The ballads were
! gathered from the logging camps of
j Minnesota.
