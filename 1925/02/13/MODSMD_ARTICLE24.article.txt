# Heat Treatment of Steel Discussed by W. J. Crook
## 
### 
"Recalescence and Decalescence
Points of Steel" was the subject of a
lecture by Professor Welton J. Crook
given last night to members of the
Mining and Metallurgy department.
The whole theory of the heat treat
ment of steel was discussed by Profes
sor Crook. He illustrated the iron
carbon diagram and took up especially
the transformation taking place in the
solid state of steel. Studies of what
happens when steel specimens of vari
ous carbon content are slowly cooled
after the temperature of solidification
has been reached were shown.
Professor Crook will deliver this lec
ture before the American Society for
Steel Treating tomorrow night as the
third of the society's educational series
of lectures 011 the practice and theory
of the heat treatment of steel.
