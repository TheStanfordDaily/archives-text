### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Elmer Smith is back! Wielding the old tommyhawk as he did in 1920 with
the Cleveland Indians, Big Chief Elmer has battered his way back into the
Major Leagues. The New York Yankees let Smith go a year ago in the deal
for Earl Combs, and, not at all discouraged, Elmer proceeded to hit .334 for
Louisville and lead the American Association in home runs. Not bad for a
guy who was supposed to be through!
Now the Cincinnati Reds have Elmer Smith on their pay roll, and it will be
interesting to see what he does in the other Ohio big league town. Having
once established an American League batting record, how will he go against
National League pitching?
Smith, while playing for Cleveland in the World's Series of 1920 against
Brooklyn, hit a home run with the bases full. No other player ever achieved
that honor. The next year "Socking Smitty" hit a home run in the opening
game of the season, and then, not to start something he couldn't finish, hit
another home run in the last game of the year.
Cleveland traded Smith to Boston in 1921, and the Red Sox sent him along
to the Yankees in 1922 with Joe Dugan. Elmer and Earl Smith, of the Giants,
put on the famous "Smith Brothers" act in the 1922 World's Series, entitled
"Pinch Hitters Who Miss." But Elmer lived that down.
