# Howard Jones, Former Iowa Coach, at U. S. C.
## 
### 
Howard Jones, former coach of the
University of lowa, has been secured as
head mentor of the University of South
ern California's football teams. Jones
was selected as Gus Henderson's suc
cessor from a field of candidates, notable
among whom was Knute Rockne.
Following his acceptance of the posi
tion, Jones signified his intention of hav
ing as his assistants men who were used
to his system of playing football. With
this in mind he is angling for one of
his flashiest pupils, Aubrey Devine, a
nine "I" man, and captain and quarter
back of the 1922 All-American outfit.
Devine, following his graduation from
lowa, took the position of head coach
of the Denver University outfit and last
year turned out one of the best teams
that school has ever had.
Other men that Howard Jones has his
eye on are Leland Parkin, Gordon Locke,
and Harold Van Metre, who helped Jones
back in 1919. Parkin captained last year's
Old Gold team, and two years ago scored
the winning touchdown against Yale Uni
versity in the East-West classic of the
year. Locke was one of the strongest
backs in the Big Four. One point of in
terest in that contest was the fact that
Yale's coach, Tad Jones, was the brother
of U. S. C's new mentor.
