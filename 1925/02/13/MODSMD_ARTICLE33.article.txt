# STANFORD GOLF MEN MAKE BID FOR COAST TITLE FEBRUARY 22
## 
### 
Represented by a strong all-around
team, Stanford will make u determined
bid for the Pacific Coast Intercolle
giate Golf Champ onship at Del Monte
February 21-23. Manager "Nick" Car
ter, who is in charge of all arrange
ments for the tournament, will lead
the Card delegation.
He has not yet definitely decided on
the players who will be included in the
Stanford lineup. Lang, Wilson, Mey
berg, Stanley, Condit, Foye, Ditzler,
Quinn, and Clark are among those
from whom the four-man team will be
chosen. Carter is desirous that all men
with any golfing ability whatsoever
send in entries in order that lie may
have a large field from which to make
his selections. Entry blanks may be
secured from him or from the gradu
ate manager's office.
lleports from California indicate that
thp Bears are making exhaustive pre
paYations to send down a team capable
of. bringing the championship back to
Berkeley for the second successive
tiipe. In 1924 Loren Upson turned the
trfck, and there is a strong possibility
thUt he will compete again this year.
â€¢ Bears Lose Haight
Supporting Upson will be Johnny
Talt, Jack Nounan, and Lloyd Thomas.
These men trimmed the Stanford play
ers in the tournament held last quar
ters at Burlingame, and the Cards will
be' out to avenge themselves. The
Bejrkeleyites will enter the competi
tion minus the servics of Stanton
Height, their captain and No. 1 man,
but if Upson is on deck the loss will
be; more than made good.
Jim Wilson Is looked upon as Stan
ford's best bet to annex the silver
trophy offered by Spalding's for the
winner of the first flight. Wilson is
orte of the few performers on the Card
sqfuad who has succeeded in winning
his match against California. He is a
seasoned player and has the advantage
of being familiar with the Del Monte
links over which the match will be
pljiyed. The course is one of the most
dilfficult in the state and is likely to
handicap men who do not know its
peculiarities.
A check of the library attendance
in- many of the colleges throughout
the country serves as a measure of
the fluctuations of student ambition.
Whether or not "letter" sweaters or
other emblems should be given to the
members of the band is at present a
live issue at Howard College, Alabama.
