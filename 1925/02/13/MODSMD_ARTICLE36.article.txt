# UNIVERSITY FLOCK OF SHEEP KEEPS LAWN IN CONDITION
## 
### Herbert Klein 
The University flock of about 240
sheep quartered in the corral back of
the old track form a self-supporting
community. Not only do the sheep act
as a highly efficient grass-trimmer for
the lawns around the campus but each
sheep furnishes approximately four
and one-fourth pounds of wool selling
at about 35 cents a pound at each of
the semi-annual shearings. A shearing
nets the Board of Athletic Contral
about $350.
Bill McCollough, shepherd of the
flock, tends the sheep with the assist
ance of four dogs. He is out from day
break until 9 at night, moving along
with the assistance of four dogs. He
is out from daybreak until 9 at night,
moving along with the sheep as they
feed themselves. He has been their
shepherd since they were first pur
chased nearly ten years ago.
At a word from Bill the dogs are
off, dashing around and barking, mov
ing the flock in one direction or an
other, or rounding up the stragglers,
according to the way Bill points his
arm. At another signal the dogs come
running back to wait for the next time
they are needed, but always keeping a
watchful eye on the sheep. They can
tackle a lamb headed toward the auto
mobile bighway as expertly as a foot
ball man, and bowl it over without
hurting it, so that it will not be run
over.
Bill maintains that he would not sell
Bruce, his best trained dog, for $500.
"He knows what I'm saying as well as
a man would. A good sheep dog is the
most intelligent animal there is, if he
has been trained correctly," Bill says.
These dogs, like all other animals,
must be taught with kindness and un
derstanding, not scoldings or beatings.
The flock is kept to number about
230, and the extra sheep are sold each
year as they grow old. Besides these
there are about eight rams and six
goats. In moving the flock about the
goats are useful as leaders since they
are not as easily frightened or stam
peded as are the sheep who can be
made to go almost anywhere provided
one of their number leads the way.
That the flock is capable in its role
of grass cutter is shown by the fact
that, although the grass in the stadium
was at first trimmed by machine, it
was soon found desirable to have the
sheep do it, and now they take care
of it as well as the polo fields. The
ovals, before being transformed to
shrubbery, were also tended in this
way. The services of the flock are even
occasionally required for the lawns of
the estate of Timothy Hopkins, a trus
tee of the University.
