# PHI GAMMA DELTA TRIMS BRANNER II 8-4 IN RAGGED GAME
## 
### 
By losing to Phi Gamma Delta 8 to
4 Branner II yesterday broke the exist
ing triple tie and dropped out of the
running for the title in League 7, leav
ing Breakers and the Japanese Club
to fight it out this afternoon. Today's
winner will meet Alpha Kappa Lamb
da, winner of League 1, at 4:15 Mon
day. In the only other game played
last night Phi Sigma Kappa defeated
Delta Tau Delta 9 to 1. Kappa Alpha
forfeited to Encina 4E.
The Fiji-Branner affair was a rather
hit-or-miss exhibition of basketball.
The hall men were utterly unable to
find the basket, and it was not their
fault that they scored even four points,
as one goal went through on a blind,
overhead backward shot by Stevenscn.
Neiser chalked up the remaining two
points on a pretty throw late in the
game.
Although thley showed flashes of
good teamwork the Fijis played ragged
ball for the most part, missing about
ten attempts for every bucket they
sank. Condit and Chase were the main
cogs in their attack. The Row men led
5 to 0 at the half.
Phi Sigs Trounce Delts
Delta Tau Delta and Phi Sigma
Kappa put on a battle that went the
Fiji-Branner contest one better for
wild and wooly basketball and out
right comedy. The Delts played minus
most of their regulars and showed the
effects plainly. "Skin" Collett gave the
hill-dwellers their sole tally in the
opening minutes of the game on a free
throw.
McLellan's basket and Miller's foul
goal accounted for the Phi Sigs' three
points in the first half. Toward the end
of the second period the winners came
to life and displayed some real team
work. Bruce looped in a couple of nice
buckets and McLellan contributed one.
Today's program concludes the in
tramural series and playoffs for the
championship will be held next week.
In the preliminary round Monday the
following teams will mix: Alpha Kappa
Lambda vs. Breakers or Japanese Club,
4:15; Sigma Alpha Epsilon vs. Kappa
