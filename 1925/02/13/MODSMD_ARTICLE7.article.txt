# VARSITY, FRESHMEN MEET BEAR BASKETBALL TEAMS
## 1928 Battles With California Tonight 
### Dudley Ross 
Stanford's freshman basketball team
plays the first game of the series with
the California first-year men tonight
at Berkeley. Both teams have come
through consistently good preliminary
seasons and should be almost evenly
matched.
The Bear team started out the year
with excellent material from which to
form a star team. But with the open
ing of the present semester several
of their best men were declared ineli
gible, which caused a considerable
weakening of the squad.
Johnny Talt, former captain of the
Bruin vefrsity and present coach of the
freshman team, has since welded to
gether five meij who shown high
class basketball during their playing
together. Although the team lacks a
brilliant performer, it has developed
into a consistent quintet.
Only Small Defeat So Far
The Stanford yearlings have played
exceptional basketball throughout the
early-season games. Only one defeat
has been scored up against them by
| Piedmont High School, and that was
jlost by the narrow margin of one point,
i Of late, the babes have never had dif
ficulty in disposing of their opponents.
; In all games in which there was any
possibility of defeat in the first period,
the five has furnished thrills in the
latter part to win.
Although the freshman squad suf
fered from the loss of several stars
and was cut down in numbers as a
result of the posting of scholastic aver
ages, Coach "Husky" Hunt has put a
| team on the floor which bids fair to
! rank with the best class quintets which
jhave ever been produced at Stanford.
Same Uineup Probable
Probably the same lineup will start
tonight against the Bears as was used
at the opening of the game with St.
Vincent's. After a great deal of experi
mentation Hunt has found that Crist
I and Vincenti at forwards, Clark at cen
tre, and Dennis and Biaggini at guards
shape up the best together.
Crist, who was not rated high at the
beginning of the season, has developed
into a flashy forward under "Husky's"
coaching. In -the last few games he
has shown a great deal of fight and has
dribbled through the opponents time
after time for a score. Vincenti pairs
up well with Crist. He has played
steadily all season and can be counted
on to make a number of points.
Clark Scores With Others
Bill Clark, named captain after the
St. Vincent game, was shifted to cen
ter in mid-se'ason, changing over with
"Swede" Dennis. With the two for
wards he has turned in the majority
of points for the freshmen. Dennis is
a reliable man at his new position of
running guard and can always be
I counted on to ring up some follow
shots during a game.
Biaggini is another of Hunt's finds.
Although he has played in only a por
tion of the season's games, he has
come along rapidly into an excellent
standing guard. His work has played a
large part in keeping the scores
| against the freshmen down to a mini
mum.
For substitutes Coach Hunt has Cliff
Moore, King Bigelow, and Reynolds,
who have all performed well during
the early-season contests.

at Berkeley. Both teams have come
through consistently good preliminary
seasons and should be almost evenly
matched.
The Bear team started out the year
with excellent material from which to
form a star team. But with the open
ing of the present semester several
of their best men were declared ineli
gible, which caused a considerable
weakening of the squad.
Johnny Talt, former captain of the
Bruin vefrsity and present coach of the
freshman team, has since welded to
gether five meij who shown high
class basketball during their playing
together. Although the team lacks a
brilliant performer, it has developed
into a consistent quintet.
Only Small Defeat So Far
The Stanford yearlings have played
exceptional basketball throughout the
early-season games. Only one defeat
has been scored up against them by
| Piedmont High School, and that was
jlost by the narrow margin of one point,
i Of late, the babes have never had dif
ficulty in disposing of their opponents.
; In all games in which there was any
possibility of defeat in the first period,
the five has furnished thrills in the
latter part to win.
Although the freshman squad suf
fered from the loss of several stars
and was cut down in numbers as a
result of the posting of scholastic aver
ages, Coach "Husky" Hunt has put a
| team on the floor which bids fair to
! rank with the best class quintets which
jhave ever been produced at Stanford.
Same Uineup Probable
Probably the same lineup will start
tonight against the Bears as was used
at the opening of the game with St.
Vincent's. After a great deal of experi
mentation Hunt has found that Crist
I and Vincenti at forwards, Clark at cen
tre, and Dennis and Biaggini at guards
shape up the best together.
Crist, who was not rated high at the
beginning of the season, has developed
into a flashy forward under "Husky's"
coaching. In -the last few games he
has shown a great deal of fight and has
dribbled through the opponents time
after time for a score. Vincenti pairs
up well with Crist. He has played
steadily all season and can be counted
on to make a number of points.
Clark Scores With Others
Bill Clark, named captain after the
St. Vincent game, was shifted to cen
ter in mid-se'ason, changing over with
"Swede" Dennis. With the two for
wards he has turned in the majority
of points for the freshmen. Dennis is
a reliable man at his new position of
running guard and can always be
I counted on to ring up some follow
shots during a game.
Biaggini is another of Hunt's finds.
Although he has played in only a por
tion of the season's games, he has
come along rapidly into an excellent
standing guard. His work has played a
large part in keeping the scores
| against the freshmen down to a mini
mum.
For substitutes Coach Hunt has Cliff
Moore, King Bigelow, and Reynolds,
who have all performed well during
