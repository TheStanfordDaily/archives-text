# Stanford Has Good Chance Tomorrow
## 
### David Meiklejohn 
Stanford still has an even chance to
defeat the Bruin five when the two
meet in the Oakland Auditorium to
morrow night at 8 o'clock.
California will have, it is true, the
advantage of a one-game victory and
the familiarity of the Oakland Audi
torium court, which latter is probably
the most advantageous.
The fact that the Bruins defeated
Stanford on the pavilion court was also
somewhat of an advantage. Heretofore
the Stanford teams have played their
best games on the home court and
managed albeit somewhat haphazardly
to win 'the greater percentage of the
contests.
Speed will be the main item the
Cards will have to pit themselves
against. The Bruins displayed a clever
running defense in their first game.
Ladar, Belasco, and Higgins are a
speedy combination, all of them good
shots and experienced players.
Ernie Nevers is due for a good night
on the court during one of these
series games. Nevers last year was
one of the main pillars of the offense.
Teams Evenly Matched
The two teams are so evenly
matched that it would be endangering
life to predict victory for either side.
The style of play on both teams has
necessarily undergone a change, and
Stanford, a little slow in the first game
to understand that change, has had the
advantage of a good week's practice
to become acclimated.
The reason Kerr's sophomore team
apepared to be the best combination
last Saturday night was that the
newer members were lighter and
faster than the regular team, therefore
comparing favorably with California's
running style of play. This does not
necessarily mean that the sophomores
would be the best in all cases. Kerr
probably has his squad in hand by this
time to combat speed.
Nelson David's work in the first
game with California was worthy of
note. It must be remembered that this
was David's initial tussle with a Cali
fornia team on the varsity lineup, and,
keeping this in mind, his work was
commendable, to say the least.
