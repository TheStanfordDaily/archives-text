# LIGHTWEIGHT FIVES READY
## 145's Play California Game Preliminary to Babe Tilt This Evening 
### 
In the first encounter of the Cali
fornia-Stanford lightweight brigades
the 145-pound basketball teams will
clash at 7 o'clock tonight in the Har
mon Gym at Berkeley. The lightweight
game will be preliminary to the Card-
Bear freshman tilt.
The entire season of the lightweight
teams is spent with one end in view,
to beat California. Earlier games are
only preparatory steps necessary to
turn the trick. The 145's have met a
number of high-powered teams during
the season and have emerged with vic
tories over three. The U. of C. Dental
College, which beat the Stanford team
36-15, slipped through with a win over
the California 145's by a score of 18-13.
The results of these' games offer the
only comparative estimate of the rela
tive strength of the California and
Stanford teams.
At times the Cardinal lightweights
have resembled a well-oiled machine
and at other times a machine that
never saw oil. Inaccurate passing has
beati a sore spot in nearly all of their
games. If they respond to Coach Davis'
constant drilling they should get their
forces well organized and make for
themselves a few opportunities to try
for the basket. There are several good
shots on the squad but they have been
ineffective because the team has had
difficulty in working the ball into close
range of the basket.
No definite lineup has been an
nounced by Coach Davis but the initial
one will probably include Blazier and
Smith at forwards, Riese at center,
and Clark and Kunzel at guards.
George, Stewart, Cairns, Sibbett, and
Parsons will likely do the major work
of substituting.
