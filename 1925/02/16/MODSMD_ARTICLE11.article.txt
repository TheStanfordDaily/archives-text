# 'DEVIL'S DAUGHTER' SATISFIES CRITIC
## Ram's Head Production Has Artistic Qualities; Ends Without Climax 
### Norris James 
Take a little pedigreed Siberian bull,
two heaping potions of traditional Slavic
grief—soften it down in spots (the grief,
not the bull) —add a few songs in each
act and then thoroughly trample under
foot to the alluring cadence of balalaikas
and the muttered curses of a score or more
female impersonators.
Result—rthe formula for "The Devil's
Daughter," just' about the most interesting
and artistic dramatic attempt made by
Ram's Head Society in recent years.
Exceptional dancing, rhythmic music,
able direction artistic costuming, brilliant
stage cffects and an interesting plot' treat
ment marked out the play as the very real
success it was but, on the other hand, like
a story without a climax, like a drink
without a "kick," or, to use a time-worn
but none the less effective metaphor, "like
an egg without salt," "The Devil's Daugh
ter" promised something which it could
not or would not flufill. Perhaps it was
the pernicious alumni influence exerted by
the authors, Dan Evans and Mike Ely,
who emulating Merton Gill, tried to do
Bigger and Better things for Stanford
dramatics in general and Ram's Head in
particular and forced Russianophile ideals
of sorrow and sadness over the campus.
Be that as it may, through the weakness
of the lines, "The Devil's Daughter"
wavered between lukewarm satire and
burlesque and finally drifted out of the
realm of drama entirely, all because the
Evans-Ely brain child came into the world
without a sense of humor.
Plot Clever.
Undeniable cleverness in plot structure
was the authors' chief contribution to the
play for though the lines were either
insipid or indistinguishable, the plot suc
ceeded in breaking all precedent by hold
ing the attention of Friday night's au
dience.
No moral nor physical justification can
be made, however, for attaching the pro
logue to the play proper without likewise
including the epilogue. Every canon of
dramatic good taste revolts at the idea.
As to the beauty and artistry of "The
Devil s Daughter," it carried a very dis
tinct appeal which should set new tradi
tions in Ram's Head shows. Evans and
Ely provided the central idea but to carry
it into execution required the united ef
forts of Dave Monnoccir, Mrs. Henry
Lanz, Frederick Tyroler, Hume West
and Leslie Kiler. A less auspicious blend
of talents would have results in a dismal
I failure.
Dancing Well Coached.
Ihe dancing excelled any previous
Ram's Head attempts; it was distinctive,
colorful, well-coached. Out of the bril
liant mesh of swiftly moving terpsichor
ean numbers the peasant dance in the first
act surpassed all others and on the part
of the dancers required unusual athletic
jadeptness to meet the strenuous demand
jof the Russian steps. It is not easy to
| describe this number and the dance of
| the devils without becoming grandiloquent,
j Attractive costuming and stage effects
certainly appealed to the eye. Without
j question they were the best ballet bits
the present generation of student au
diences can remembr seeing on the As
sembly hall stage.
Dave Mannoccir saved the dramatic
part of "The Devil's Daughter" from go
ing to the demnition bow-wows because
of the weakness of the lines. The play
rolled along to its conclusion with a sur
prising smoothness and case and the
tempo and verve actually made the plot
engrossing. Mannoccir resorted to the
simplest of stage business yet it was ef
fective and fool-proof.
No particular distinction was attached
to the acting Friday night for no heavy
demands were placed on the players. John
Truman made Mother Petroshka sinister
enough to be melodramatic and burlesque
enough to be funny.
Impersonators Please.
Usually the Ram's Head female im
personators resemble a stage hands'
beauty contest but Pat Kelly did espec
ially well as Anna, heroine of the play.
His voice is small, but well-used and he
has much poise and a certain prettiness
not exactly unlike the well known W. T.
Benda type. ,
Lee Flood was appealing as Olga but
when he opened his ruby lips to speak
out drawled the voice of a train an
nouncer. Both these men will bear watch
ing in future Ram's Head shows. Statu
esque Muscovite girls in the choruses wore
their attractive peasant' costumes with an
unusual nonchalance. We especially liked
the blonde haired one who scaled about
125 pounds on the hoof and had an at
tractive way of tossing her head.
Phil Urner did not have to do very
much as the hero. He sang the "Song of
the Trail" and "Anna of Mine," two
really appealing pieces by Alice Dodds,
with a strong, clear voice, but aside from
this he only had to make several personal
appearances in company with Anna.
Jack Wiggin and Charles Simons were
funnier facially than verbally. Wiggin,
as Zatoffa, the magistrate, gave an excel
lent characterization and Simons as the
dyed-in-the-wool villain, Stenka, was
tough and imperturble enough to be con
vincing.
Allen Campbell was well chosen for
Satan, a rather bland, charming misap
priator of good deeds. Aided and abetted
by the astute Messrs. Kiler and West,
Satan and his assistants were whisked off
the stage right before the eyes of the
audience.
A few self-confessed laughs fell to the
lots of Dean Grunland, Bruce Tofflemier,
Elmer Collett, Frank Feliz and other
members of the large cast. Feliz and
Grunland were subtle at times as the hang
man and villager respectively, and Toffle
mier played the fiddle nicely.
As to the music we especially liked
Alice Dodds' two pieces. Jack Wiggin
was credited with writing the opening and
closing chorus but the management recall
ing the horrible intensity of the satire in
the second act at the last' minute, dis
pensed with Wiggin's second effort. The
opening chorus, something about tundras,
mujiks and droshkas was distinctly re
freshing in contrast with the old hokum
bucket filled to the brim with the usual
inanity about June time, croon time, noon
time and so forth.
Chester Barker's "Gypsy Song" sung at
the opening of the second act was a thing
of beauty supplemented by sagely chosen
singing talent. Herbert Smith is respon
sible for the durid music of the devil's
dance. Finally, credit must go to
"Chubby" Tyroler for the musical setting
for the show.
It is so gratifying to see a Ram's Head
show with distinctive features that there
is danger of hurling the adjectives too
profusely. Without question "The Devil's
Daughter" showed crUdeness, lack of
finish and a deplorable lack of humor but
wc think it was head, shoulders and waist
above the feeble attempts at burlesque
witnessed in the last two shows. Most of
the time Friday night, the 1025 Rain's
Head show was intelligent, tuneful, beau
tiful and decent entertainment. And
that's that.
