# CALIFORNIA 130-POUND TEAM TOO FAST FOR CARDS
## 
### 
By fast manoeuvering and deadly shoot
ing the California 130-pound team dealt
out a defeat to the Stanford lightweights
Saturday night, with a score of 31-17. A
small individual on the California squad
named Koppa had a great influence on
the score inasmuch as he scored 9 field
goals which totals 18 points.
Hobro, who was elected captain of the
team just before the game, played a hard
fast game but the Bears' teamwork was
too fast to stop, Meyers was about the
only man who could work the ball through
the California defense to take a try at the
basket.
A team with a player who can chalk up
9 field goals is placed in very good posi
tion to win any game. A fast working
offense coupled with the uncanny aim of
Koppa was too much for the Cards.
The Stanford lightweights were ob
viously off their game. Their passing
was the worst it has been this year. The
five man defense which they had worked
to such good advantage in their earlier
games failed to be effective against the
speedy Bears.
Throughout the entire game the su
perior teamwork of the California five
was noticeable. Only at times did the
Stanford quintet appear a match for their
well drilled opponents. These flashes of
form were usually led by Meyers who
after a series of short passes managed to
slip through the Bears and take a shot at
the hoop.
