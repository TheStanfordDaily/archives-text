# CARD POLOISTS BEATEN EASILY BY CRACK SOUTHERNERS
## 
### 
The Stanford polo team returns to the
campus today from a week's trip to Ari
| zona, where they lost to the University
j of Arizona four Saturday by a score of
15 to 2. A preliminary game with the
i officers of the R. O. T. C. unit of the
U. of A. was won by the Cards, 4 to 3.
: This match was played Friday.
Saturday's defeat is a heavy blow to
Cardinal hopes of an unquestioned inter
collegiate championship of the Pacific
I Coast this season, but the Stanford men
! at least have the satisfaction of knowing
j that they were defeated by a team rated
| as the best on the Coast'.
It is possible, however, that a return
match will be arranged by Captain Jcn
' kins, the Stanford coach, for a date some
| what later in the season.
If present plans arc carried to comple
i tion, Arizona will be one of several Pa
cific Coast colleges to be represented at a
' polo tournament to be held at Del Monte,
probably in April. Others who will prob
| ably enter teams if the tournament is held
are Oregon, Utah, and Stanford.
The movement is being sponsored by
Captain Jenkins and other Stanford au
thorities, who hope to make this an an
i nual championship event.
