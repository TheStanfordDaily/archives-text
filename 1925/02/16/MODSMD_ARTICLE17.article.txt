# CALIFORNIA DOWNS CARD BASKET MEN IN CLOSE CONTEST
## Extra Period Necessary to Decide Game; Final Score 22 to 18 
### Cliff Moore 
Stanford's basketball team lost its
I chance to meet California on an even
basis next Saturday when the Bears
j ran off with the second victory of the
series in the extra period last Saturday
night by a score of 22-18.
Stanford was ahead in the middle
of the first period, 2-1. Stanford led at
half time, 9-5. Stanford led a half min
ute before the final gun, but Holmes
got the ball under the basket and tied
the score 18-18. Then California got a
bad break when Ladar missed an extra
free throw and the game had to go
five minutes more.
In the short period Stanford's diffi
culty in scoring through the strange
baskets was the most heart-breaking.
The Cards continued to get more shots
than the Bears did, only to have the
ball jig about the rim, finally to fall
away. California scored a long one
and a follow shot and the game was
over.
Ernie Nevers played a brilliant
brand of ball. Time and again the big
Card forward crashed through the
Bruin defense. Ernie also ran off with
high point honors, sinking three field
goals and two foul shots for a total
of eight points. Belaaco, of the Bears,
counted for seven of California's
points.
The entire contest was marked by
fast teamwork and accurate long-goal
shooting, with California counting
more consistently than the Cards. The
lead see-sawed in the second half, with
first Stanford in the lead, and then
California.
Stanford clearly outplayed the
Bruins in the first half, demonstrating
a decidedly superior brand of play.
Led by Ernie Nevers and Fred Price,
the Card offense ran rings around the
California guards, and only tough luck
under the bucket prevented Stanford
from running up a much larger score
iu the initial period.
California Stages Comeback
California staged a determined
comeback in the second half, tieing
the count in a few minutes by long
shots by Ladar and Belasco. From
then on the game developed into a
real battle, with first one team and
then the other taking the lead.
Fred Price came into the game with
the count tied at 16 all, and put Stan
ford in the lead with a goal from the
foul zone. With barely a minute to
play, the Card defense weakened and
Benny Holmes slipped behind Dave
Oliva for the basket that tied the
game. Captain Ladar, of the Bears,
was awarded a free shot because of
an illegal time-out by Stanford, and
this gave California its best chance to
win the game. Ladar missed the shot,
however, and the result was dependent
on an extra five minutes of play.
Watson, substitute center, proved
to be the hero for the Bears when he
eluded the Card defense, and shot the
basket that put California in the lead.
Belasco further strengthened his
team's victory by sinking a follow-up.
The lineups were as follows:
California Stanford
Holmes (4) F Price (5)
Ladar (6) F Nevers (8)
Higgins C H. Shipkey (1)
Belasco (7) G T. Shipkey
Carver G Oliva
Watson (3) Bavid
Sechter (2) Anderson (1)
