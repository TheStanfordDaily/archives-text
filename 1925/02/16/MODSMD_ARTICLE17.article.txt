## Extra Period Necessary to Decide Game; Final Score 22 to 18 
### Cliff Moore 
Stanford's basketball team lost its
I chance to meet California on an even
basis next Saturday when the Bears
j ran off with the second victory of the
series in the extra period last Saturday
night by a score of 22-18.
Stanford was ahead in the middle
of the first period, 2-1. Stanford led at
half time, 9-5. Stanford led a half min
ute before the final gun, but Holmes
got the ball under the basket and tied
the score 18-18. Then California got a
bad break when Ladar missed an extra
free throw and the game had to go
five minutes more.
In the short period Stanford's diffi
culty in scoring through the strange
baskets was the most heart-breaking.
The Cards continued to get more shots
than the Bears did, only to have the
ball jig about the rim, finally to fall
away. California scored a long one
and a follow shot and the game was
over.
Ernie Nevers played a brilliant
brand of ball. Time and again the big
Card forward crashed through the
Bruin defense. Ernie also ran off with
high point honors, sinking three field
goals and two foul shots for a total
of eight points. Belaaco, of the Bears,
counted for seven of California's
points.
