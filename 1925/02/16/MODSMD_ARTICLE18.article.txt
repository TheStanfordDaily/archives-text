### 
j Coach "Dink" Templeton pat his 1925
: squad of track and field men through its
first meet of the season on the old oval
S Saturday morning. Both varsity and
• freshman candidates competed.
With the exception of the sprints, all
I events were cut to three-fourths distances
giving little basis for comparing records.
In spite of the soggy track, one-fifth
i of a second was cut off last week's record
' in the hundred—Gaspar cutting the time
from 0:10 3-5 to 0:10 2-5. Leistner and
Hyland finished close behind in the order
| named.
The most encouraging result of the
; meet was Work's leap for first place in
the high jump with a height of 6 feet
; 2 5-8 inches. This is Work's first year
j of varsity competition and with such an
I auspicious start, he should develop into
I a consistent first-place man for Temple
j ton.
Cruikshank also shows possibilities in
the broad jump, taking first, ahead of
! McCrae, with a jump of 21 feet 9 1-2
I inches. McCrae was second and Work
! third.
Hartranft began the season with a toss
j of 46 feet 6 inches in the shotput, but
j failed to do better than 156 feet 11 1-2
| inches with the discus.
