# JAPANESE, EL TORO FIVES WIN TITLES IN LEAGUES 5 AND 7
## 
### 
El Toro and the Japanese Club won
their way to the playoffs in intramural
basketball Friday, by grabbing off
championships in Leagues 5 and 7. El
Toro defeated Encina 3E 19 to 6 in an
extra game played to break the tie
existing between the two teams, while
the Japanese Club downed the Break
ers 16 to 7.
El Toro, playing its best game to
date, took the verdict over the Encina
quintet through good teamwork, and
some accurate shots by Arthur, Clif
ford, and Rupe. The freshmen fought
hard all the way, but failed to exhibit
the playing which brought them into a
tie for the title. Stewart and Altaffer
accounted for three points apiece.
During the first half the two teams
provided some of the fastest competi
tion yet produced in the intramural
series. El Toro scored repeatedly on
some nice passing formatioiys, the
Arthur-to-Rupe-to-Clifford combination
piercing Encina's defense without
much trouble. Luck seemed to be
against the freshmen on some of their
shots which rimmed the hoop without
going in. Toro piled up a 14 to 5 lead
during the first period and was con
tent to take things a little easier in
the latter part of the game.
Japanese Club Fast
Superior speed brought the Japanese
'Club victory in a rough, closely-con
tested battle with the Breakers. Al
though considerably smaller than their
opponents, the Japanese passed and
pivoted and dribbled with a speed
which enabled them to elude the slow
er and heavier Breaker guards. The
winners registered on a high percent
age of their shots, while the Breakers
threw the ball in the general direction
of the hoop numerous times without
aiming very carefully.
Frank Compton was most successful
in chalking up points for the eating
club when he stood directly under the
basket, held the ball out of the reach
of the shot Japanese guards, and
tossed it in. Murata, Mizota, and Horii
starred for the winners. At half time
the count favored the Japanese Club
8 to 2.

El Toro and the Japanese Club won
their way to the playoffs in intramural
basketball Friday, by grabbing off
championships in Leagues 5 and 7. El
Toro defeated Encina 3E 19 to 6 in an
extra game played to break the tie
existing between the two teams, while
the Japanese Club downed the Break
ers 16 to 7.
El Toro, playing its best game to
date, took the verdict over the Encina
quintet through good teamwork, and
some accurate shots by Arthur, Clif
ford, and Rupe. The freshmen fought
hard all the way, but failed to exhibit
the playing which brought them into a
tie for the title. Stewart and Altaffer
accounted for three points apiece.
During the first half the two teams
provided some of the fastest competi
tion yet produced in the intramural
series. El Toro scored repeatedly on
some nice passing formatioiys, the
Arthur-to-Rupe-to-Clifford combination
piercing Encina's defense without
much trouble. Luck seemed to be
against the freshmen on some of their
shots which rimmed the hoop without
going in. Toro piled up a 14 to 5 lead
during the first period and was con
tent to take things a little easier in
the latter part of the game.
Japanese Club Fast
Superior speed brought the Japanese
'Club victory in a rough, closely-con
tested battle with the Breakers. Al
though considerably smaller than their
opponents, the Japanese passed and
pivoted and dribbled with a speed
which enabled them to elude the slow
er and heavier Breaker guards. The
winners registered on a high percent
age of their shots, while the Breakers
threw the ball in the general direction
of the hoop numerous times without
aiming very carefully.
Frank Compton was most successful
in chalking up points for the eating
club when he stood directly under the
basket, held the ball out of the reach
of the shot Japanese guards, and
tossed it in. Murata, Mizota, and Horii
starred for the winners. At half time
the count favored the Japanese Club
8 to 2.

Friday's play concluded the intra

El Toro and the Japanese Club won
their way to the playoffs in intramural
basketball Friday, by grabbing off
championships in Leagues 5 and 7. El
Toro defeated Encina 3E 19 to 6 in an
extra game played to break the tie
existing between the two teams, while
the Japanese Club downed the Break
ers 16 to 7.
El Toro, playing its best game to
date, took the verdict over the Encina
quintet through good teamwork, and
some accurate shots by Arthur, Clif
ford, and Rupe. The freshmen fought
hard all the way, but failed to exhibit
the playing which brought them into a
tie for the title. Stewart and Altaffer
accounted for three points apiece.
During the first half the two teams
provided some of the fastest competi
tion yet produced in the intramural
series. El Toro scored repeatedly on
some nice passing formatioiys, the
Arthur-to-Rupe-to-Clifford combination
piercing Encina's defense without
much trouble. Luck seemed to be
against the freshmen on some of their
shots which rimmed the hoop without
going in. Toro piled up a 14 to 5 lead
during the first period and was con
tent to take things a little easier in
the latter part of the game.
Japanese Club Fast
Superior speed brought the Japanese
'Club victory in a rough, closely-con
tested battle with the Breakers. Al
though considerably smaller than their
opponents, the Japanese passed and
pivoted and dribbled with a speed
which enabled them to elude the slow
er and heavier Breaker guards. The
winners registered on a high percent
age of their shots, while the Breakers
threw the ball in the general direction
of the hoop numerous times without
aiming very carefully.
Frank Compton was most successful
in chalking up points for the eating
club when he stood directly under the
basket, held the ball out of the reach
of the shot Japanese guards, and
tossed it in. Murata, Mizota, and Horii
starred for the winners. At half time
the count favored the Japanese Club
8 to 2.
League Standings
Friday's play concluded the intra
mural series. Preliminary play-offs are
being held today between the eight
league winners. Semi-finals will take
place Wednesday, and the finals Fri-'
