El Toro and the Japanese Club won
their way to the playoffs in intramural
basketball Friday, by grabbing off
championships in Leagues 5 and 7. El
Toro defeated Encina 3E 19 to 6 in an

the Japanese Club downed the Break

quintet through good teamwork, and
some accurate shots by Arthur, Clif
ford, and Rupe. The freshmen fought
hard all the way, but failed to exhibit

tie for the title. Stewart and Altaffer

during the first period and was con

the latter part of the game.
