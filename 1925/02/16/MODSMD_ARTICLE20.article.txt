# U. S. C. Again
## 
### 
In spite of the assurances of those connected with the University of
Southern California to the effect that they wish to cooperate with Stan
ford and California and to compete again in athletics with these northern
universities, the Trojans persist in refusing to see the point. The south
erners should grasp by this time that they are unwelcome because their
conduct is not considered sportsmanlike.
It was pointed out that Stanford and California objected to the U. S.
C. disregard of certain rules agreed upon by the three universities. Evi
dence was found to prove that the southern university was guilty of un
sportsmanlike violation of the agreement.
There are certain other unwritten rules of conduct in which some gen
tleman should instruct these Trojans also.
And while they pester with petitions for readmittance and offers of
future cooperation, such things as this are discovered which indicate some
thing of a different state of mind.
The following is an extract from the Southern California Illustrated
News of January, 1925, a magazine published by the Alumni Association
of the University of Southern California, and may be taken, it is pre
sumed, as presenting an attitude with a certain degree of accuracy:
"A lot of people saw the Jim Lawson-Gordon Campbell party
during the Stanford-Southern California game last year. It was a
fitting end to the Stanford captain's career that, after he had
broken the bones of a few Notre Dame players in the Stanford-
Notre Dame game, Adam Walsh pulled up one of the legs of his
football suit and exposed a shiny steel knee-brace that had been
assisting Jim materially. The officials ordered Mr. Lawson to pad
his new brace. After that was done the game proceeded merrily."
While such incidents as this arise with U. S. C. even the most favor
ably disposed Stanfordite or Californian must see the difference of
principle.
