Robert C. Angell of the department of sociology at the University of
Michigan deplores the intellectual apathy of college students in an article
appearing in the Michigan Alumnus. The remedy, to some extent, says
Mr. Angell, is up to the college editors.
"They can bring the best scholars into prominence; they can subtly
lead students to appreciate the fascination of the intellectual life; they can
give less publicity to, and so lessen interest in, matters of minor import
ance like athletics," says this writer. •
There is little doubt that scholars might be brought into greater promi
nence, but it does not follow that more students will attend the lecture on
Greek literature it they have been advised of the scholarly accomplish
ments of the lecturer in his field, nor is it reasonable to believe that they
will leave the lecture with any greater interest in the subject because the
student paper has praised the speaker.
While the fascination of the intellectual life might be subtly intimated
by some good subtle intimater, there is no way of making the stuff stick.
Nor is this difficulty peculiar to college papers. Professional journals have
been subtly doing this and that for years, and their largest success has
ever been in the field where their readers' greatest interest lay.
There were the Greek Olympics, the Roman circuses, the medieval
jousts as well as the intellectual activities of these civilizations. How did
they compare ?
