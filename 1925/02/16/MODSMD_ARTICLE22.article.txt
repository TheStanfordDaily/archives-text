# Remains of Old Gymnasium Removed to Stock Farm
## 
### 
The large casKet-snaped stone, a
remnant of the old gymnasium,
wrecked by the earthquake, will no
longer be a silent witness to the an
nual bonfire. It has been removed from
its resting place of almost twenty
years and has been taken to the site
of the old Stanford stock farm where
it will serve as a pedestal for a statue
of a horse commemorating the many
prize-winning race horses that are
buried there.
The statue will contain the names
and best records of the famous ani
mals of Senator Stanford's stables and
is being donated by Timothy Hopkins
to replace the many scattered markers
and stones that have been there since
the horses were first buried and have
become dilapidated and weatherworn.
Many prize-winning thoroughbreds
were trained on the stock farm and
trained on the one-mile track. The first
motion pictures ever made were taken
to illustrate the movements of horses

in running. Trackmen also used the
track before a regular cinderpath was
built. The statue will be complete in
about two weeks and will add much to
the beauty of the historic section. It
was not found an easy task to move
the great stone which weighs over ten
tons. Durinf the process the axles of
the truck carrying it were severely
bent.
