### Steve O'Donnell 
The New Motto
Cabbages has just scratched (hat
magnificent head of his, thus generat
ing a handful of sauerkraut, and an
idea which lie believes will work to the
betterment of the University. He sug
gests that a new motto be adopted. In
vain have we tried to make the Uni
versity conform to its present motto,
now let us adopt a motto which con
forms to the University.
The present motto, "The Winds of
Freedom Blow," has no local signifi
cance. Nothing is free around here
anyway. Since this is true, how can
anyone blow? Would it not be better
to have a motto which would mean
something to Stanford men and
women? One which fould be clearly
impressed upon them by their college
experiences?
Cabbages suggests that the authori
ties respond to the crying need of the
moment and adopt as the new motto
of the University that inspiring line:
MAKE CHECKS PAYABLE TO
STANFORD UNIVERSITY BEFORE
COMING TO WINDOW.

We have just received a little
pamphlet on etiquette which contains
some distressing little queries. In case
these matters have been bothering you
as much as they have us, let us offer
a few hints:
1. Q. Should asparagus be eaten with
the fingers?
A. By no means! Eat the fingers
first and save the asparagus
for dessert.
2. Q. On what side should the owner
of an automobile sit?
A. On the inside. His friends al
ways stand on the running
board.
* * *
Members of women's athletic teams
have been forbidden to eat rich pas
tries and other desserts.
It is estimated that in Roble alone
this will effect a saving of $2.83 (two
dollars and eighty-three cents) each
and every week.
* * *
Cabbages want to know if a sorority
canoe is a house boat.
* * *
News Item
Campus women are now affecting
training shirts (sweat shirts) for daily
wear.
* * *
Full many a sweat shirt garbs the
manly chest
Of ath-a-lete, or man upon the bench;
Of all its varied uses—far the best —
It cloaks the contours of the campus
wench.

Cabbages suggests that the authori

We have just received a little
pamphlet on etiquette which contains
some distressing little queries. In case
these matters have been bothering you
as much as they have us, let us offer
a few hints:
1. Q. Should asparagus be eaten with

A. By no means! Eat the fingers

for dessert.
2. Q. On what side should the owner
of an automobile sit?
A. On the inside. His friends al
ways stand on the running
board.

this will effect a saving of $2.83 (two
dollars and eighty-three cents) each
and every week.

News Item
Campus women are now affecting
training shirts (sweat shirts) for daily
wear.

Full many a sweat shirt garbs the
manly chest
Of ath-a-lete, or man upon the bench;
Of all its varied uses—far the best —
It cloaks the contours of the campus
wench.
