# CLASS BALL SERIES STARTS NEXT WEEK
## 
### 
Interelass baseball will get under
way with the opening of its schedule
next week. According to C. W. Davis,
who is in charge of the series, Harry
Wolter, coach of the varsity, will post
a list of men from his squad who are
eligible to compete. This is being
done in order to give some men a
chance to play who would otherwise
not play in any game this season.
The interelass schedule is as fol
lows: Seniors vs. Juniors, February
24; Freshmen vs. Sophomores, Febru
ary 26; Freshmen vs. Juniors, March
2; Seniors vs. Sophomores, March 3;
Juniors vs. Sophomores, March 5; Sen
iors vs. Freshmen, March 9.
Davis urges that the class teams be
organized early this week so that prac
tice can be held before the opening
contest. The intramural diamond, back
of the tennis courts, is open to use by
the class squads at all times. All
games will start at 4 o'clock in the
afternoon and will be six innings. The
freshman game will be held on the
freshman field, according to present
plans, and all others will be played on
the intramural diamond.
The class presidents have been
asked by Davis to appoint managers
of the baseball teams, and they will
take charge of all arrangements for
the various classes.
