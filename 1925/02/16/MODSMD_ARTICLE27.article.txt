# THE 						AISLE SEAT
## "The Devil's Cargo"—Varsity. 
### 
Most movies are produced with some !
"big" purpose in mind, and the new left
overs are named the "most stupendous 1
picture of the age, so they won' tbe left |
out of the rush too. We have yet to dis
cover the purpose of "The Devil's |
Cargo," or, what is vastly more import- j
ant, its point. Something must have been j
wrong in Hollywood.
The plot itself is horrible. We our
scives cannot imagine any sort of a fei !
low stopping in the midst of a particu- j
larly appealing love scene to make the
pungent remark, "This is wrong, all
wrong." At the very least, his outraged j
virtue might have been held in check for 1
a little while longer. And from the prac- |
tical standpoint it was awfully poor tech
nique on his part.
No wonder, the little reformer was
then framed by the lady to be caught in I
the general cleanup of the town, old Sac
ramento, instigated by this same rather
wishy-washy young gentleman. The rest
of the story was taken up with, the recon
ciliation after three more reels of floating
out to sea on a river boat, which was
really senseless and not at all interesting.
Now the notable fact about this play j
is that it contained two of the best per- j
formers that we have seen on the screen j
in a long time. This Pauline Starke is j
getting better and better as time goes on, j
and last night she was right there with i
the goods. She can look more alluring
with more clothes on than most women !
in the movies at present. In our official
capacity we think she deserves a big
cheer.
She and Wallace Beery together made
an impossible show seem almost good.
Beery, to our mind, is just about the best
character actor now extant. The rest of
the cast was just ordinary, following "the
usual movie style of attempting to make
individuals into types, and we have always
hated to meet people who are just typical,
whether of college or not, and these were
not. —Dud Ross.
