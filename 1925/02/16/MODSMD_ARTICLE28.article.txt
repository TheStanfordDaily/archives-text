We enjoyed "So This Is Marriage" be
cause we are very young, and highly sus
ceptible to that sort of thing (You know
what we mean).
There is something about this Eleanor
Boardman that puts us on the edge of the
complimentary seat early in the first reel,
and keeps us there until they turn on the
lights. In this picture she was at her best,
which is to say that she was just too much
for any normal young man.
Lew Cody was quite good, but Conrad
Nagel, on the other hand, was so
good.
Dramatically, the picture was not worth
much. Nevertheless, in a college town it
gained a well-earned cheer. This is an
other way of saying that the play was
full of sex appeal.
Do not think from this that we favor
this sort of thing. We don't. We just
like it.
