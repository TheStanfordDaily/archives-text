# ROBLE WOMEN NOW ABLE TO SATISFY THIRST AT HOME
## 
### 
At last the Roble thirst stands fair
to be satisfied.
For long ages the women have had
to lean under faucets in order 10 im
bibe the sparkling water, unless
glasses pinched from the dining hall
were handy. Many protests were re
ceived by the authorities, all of which
brought out the fact that such conduct
was not in accordance with the dignity
of Stanford women.
So, in spite of the fact that this ex
pected to raise the water bill for the
hall, the management is installing
drinking fountains on each and every
floor.
