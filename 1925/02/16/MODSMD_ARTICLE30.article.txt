## Famous Guys Who Golf 
### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
In the old days a prize fighter would scorn such a lady-like pastime as golf,
but such is not the case npw. Leonard, Dave Shade, Gene Tunney, Carpentier,
Mickey Walker, and many other Kings of Clout have taken up the Scotch
game, some with a marked degree of success.
Tommy Gibbons is one of these, and he and his manager, Eddie Kane, when
ever the opportunity presents itself, are out chasing the little white pills that
drive men frantic. Tom took up golf in the summer of 1920. His best score
is an 82, shot on the par 76 course at the Hendon Country Club near London.
That was made last August when Tom went over to take a fall out of
liloomfield.
Tom isn't sure what his worst score was —but he is certain that the worst
single hole he ever shot was when he took an even dozen wherd par is four!
He has a lot of fun winning from his manager, Eddie Kane, who doesn't seem
to knock down any more dough on the links than he did in the Gibbons-
Dempsey fight at Shelby, Mont.
Gibbons and Gene Tunney seem to have trouble getting together. Perhaps
they could meet on the links instead of in the ring. Gene's best score last
summer was 87, but lately he has been improving under professional tutelage
in Florida.
