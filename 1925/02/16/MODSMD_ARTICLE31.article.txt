season's team.
On Tuesday, March 24, during Spring j
vacation, the freshmen and the San Jose
Teachers College will stage a dual meet.
Track is a weak sport at the Teachers
College, and the 1928 men should have
little difficulty in winning.
As a final practice before meeting Cali
fornia, the Stanford freshmen will be
matched against an all-sj/lar Peninsula
High School team. San Jose, Santa Cruz,
Palo Alto, Redwood City, and San Matea
will all send representatives, along with
the individual stars from the smaller
schools. The 1928 men should be going
their best in this meet, and the results of
the affair will have real bearing on the
meet with California the following week.
The Little Big Meet is at Berkeley
again this season. The date of the fresh
men battle is April 4.
The freshmen will also enter teams in
the Irish Marathon, and the interclass
events. Although the season will be short,
it will be severe with a meet every week
from the Irish Marathon on February 28
until the Little Big Meet on April 4.
The freshmen schedule is as follows:
February 28—Irish Marathon.
March 7—lnterclass meet.
March 14—San Francisco High
Schools.
March 24 (Tuesday)— San Jose Teach
ers College.
March 28—Peninsula High Schools.
