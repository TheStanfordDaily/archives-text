# CAST OF "MACBETH" STARTS INTENSIVE REHEARSING TODAY
## English Club Will Sponsor Two Performances on March 6 and 7 
### Charles Simons 
With but three weeks left for re
hearsals the cast of "Macbeth," which
! the English Club will present on March
! (5 and 7, has started intensive work in
order to insure a well-rounded per
formance of Shakespeare's greatest
tragedy. The performance on March
| fith will be in the evening and that of
: March 7th will probably be a matinee,
'according to reports from the Dramatic
Manager's office.
Gordon Davis has assembled an ex
ceptionally strong cast for this pro
duction, and rehearsals, which have
been progressing for several weeks,
indicate that "Macbeth" will be an
other representative Gordon Davis pro
duction. The selection of the cast be
fore Christmas vacation has enabled
many of the characters to partially
learn their lines, which has proved to
be aninvaluable asset.
The settings for "Macbeth" will be
created by Les Kiler, who has de
signed most of the sets for Stanford
productions in the past two years.
Several changes of scenery will en
able Kiler to show his versatility in
the matter of effective settings.
The manuscript which Gordon Davis
is using in this production is the James
K. Hackett version, which was secured
from Mr. Hackett by Les Sieb, '21.
Davis and Sieb attended Hackett's pro
duction of "Macbeth" while in New
York last year, and liked it so well
that efforts were made to obtain the
rights of production. Hackett respond
ed with a letter of assent which not
only conveyed permission to use his
version, but expressed the hope that
the play would be a success. "Mac
beth" will be the first Stanford pre
senation of a Shakespearian play for
several years, and no effort is being
spared to make it an outstanding per
formance.
The leads are experienced, and the
rest of the cast contains many names
familiar to campus theatre-goers. Del
mer Daves in the title role of "Mac
beth" should give a splendid portrayal
of that part, for he is possessed of an
excellent stage presence, good voice,
and a wealth of experiencec. Miss
Helen Feldman, in the role of Lady
Macbeth, has had experience on the
professional stage, and her interpreta
tion of the part should be one of the
most interesting features of the play.

most interesting features of the play.
With but three weeks left for re
hearsals the cast of "Macbeth," which
! the English Club will present on March
! (5 and 7, has started intensive work in
order to insure a well-rounded per
formance of Shakespeare's greatest
tragedy. The performance on March
| fith will be in the evening and that of
: March 7th will probably be a matinee,
'according to reports from the Dramatic
Manager's office.
Gordon Davis has assembled an ex
ceptionally strong cast for this pro
duction, and rehearsals, which have
been progressing for several weeks,
indicate that "Macbeth" will be an
other representative Gordon Davis pro
duction. The selection of the cast be
fore Christmas vacation has enabled
many of the characters to partially
learn their lines, which has proved to
be aninvaluable asset.
The settings for "Macbeth" will be
created by Les Kiler, who has de
signed most of the sets for Stanford
productions in the past two years.
Several changes of scenery will en
able Kiler to show his versatility in
the matter of effective settings.
The manuscript which Gordon Davis
is using in this production is the James
K. Hackett version, which was secured
from Mr. Hackett by Les Sieb, '21.
Davis and Sieb attended Hackett's pro
duction of "Macbeth" while in New
York last year, and liked it so well
that efforts were made to obtain the
rights of production. Hackett respond
ed with a letter of assent which not
only conveyed permission to use his
version, but expressed the hope that
the play would be a success. "Mac
beth" will be the first Stanford pre
senation of a Shakespearian play for
several years, and no effort is being
spared to make it an outstanding per
formance.
The leads are experienced, and the
rest of the cast contains many names
familiar to campus theatre-goers. Del
mer Daves in the title role of "Mac
beth" should give a splendid portrayal
of that part, for he is possessed of an
excellent stage presence, good voice,
and a wealth of experiencec. Miss
Helen Feldman, in the role of Lady
Macbeth, has had experience on the
professional stage, and her interpreta
tion of the part should be one of the
most interesting features of the play.
