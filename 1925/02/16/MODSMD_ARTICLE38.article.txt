# Bold Canoeists Discover Lagunita to Be Navigable
## 
### 
Lake Lagunita has been formally
opened for navigation. Two bold ex
plorer-adventurers paddled a bright
red canoe around the lake yesterday
afternoon and were loud in their
praises.
A great deal of activity is to be seen
around the boathouie and on the cam
pus as the veteran canoes and mud
scows are being repaired and painted
for a busy queenjng season.
The lake is now within about three
feet of the 1923 level and is gaining
daily. Although the water is unsettled,
students will be able to swim in a
couple of weeks, it is estimated.
