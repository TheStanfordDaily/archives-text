# Vesper Services Give Way To Sorority Teas Sunday
## 
### 
Because of the teas which were being
given by the sororities yesterday,
there wefe no vespers at Roble. Those
in charge decided that since the teas
would make it impossible for most of
the women of the campus to attend,
practically no one would be able to
come.
There will be services next Sunday.
