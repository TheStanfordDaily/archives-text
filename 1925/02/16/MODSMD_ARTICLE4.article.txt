# FRESHMEN WIN 10-1 IN EASY TILT WITH ST. IGNATIUS NINE
## Hunt's Men Play Consistent Game; Phillipi Does Good Mound Work 
### Al Post 
Stanford's freshman baseballers won j
their second straight victory in as I
many starts when they downed St.:
Ignatius high school 10 to 1 Saturday j
morning on the freshman diamond. ;
Although they had four errors j
chalked up against them the babes ]
pounded two pitchers for eleven hits
and played good, heady, all-around ball
considering the small amount of prac
tice they have had. In a few weeks
they should develop into one of the ,
strongest first-year nines that Hunt
has ever turned out.
Maintaining the fast pace he set in
the game against the Palo Alto team,
Philippi allowed only six scattered
hits, only one of which went for extra
bases, in secen innings, and retired
twelve men by the strike-out route,
walked one, and hit one batsman.
Sobieski, who replaced him at the
beginning of the eighth, also went well,
faning three men and allowing two
singles.
Babes Score Early
The frosh cut loose in the first in-:
ning, finding McCarthy, St. Ignatius;
moundsman, for three hits and as j
many runs. They added another in the ;
sixth, and a couple in the seventh. In I
5 the eighth they made their big killing |
by tallying four times.
St. Ignatius got its only run in the |
! seventh on three hits, an error, a walk,
i and one hit batsman. Maguire cut off j
a runner at the plate with a beautiful j
! peg from centerfield. Then, with two j
runners on base, Philippi fanned his ,
: man to retire the side.
Failure to hit in the pinches cost the
| prep school the game. Although they
made only two errors, both let in runs.
Creighton was the heavy hitter with a
single and a double out of four times
at bat. McGloin, catcher, and O'Connor,
left field, played consistent games.
Maguire Heavy Hitter
Maguire, center fielder, and Gari-;
baldi, shortstop, led the Card sluggers
with three blows apiece out of four
: times up, and both played well in the
; field. Maguire contributed a single, a
! double, and a triple. Garibaldi, on the
i other hand, is not a hard hitter, but
places his wallops nicely and depends
1 on his speed to get him to first.
Adams, playing second for the first
time, covered his position in a credit
able manner. Sypher did some nice
work behind the plate. Weaver looked
good when he took Sims' place in right
field during the last half of the game.
Although no chances came his way in
the field he drove in a run in the sixth
with a Bingle.

Stanford's freshman baseballers won j
their second straight victory in as I

morning on the freshman diamond. ;
Although they had four errors j
chalked up against them the babes ]
pounded two pitchers for eleven hits
and played good, heady, all-around ball
considering the small amount of prac

they should develop into one of the ,
strongest first-year nines that Hunt
has ever turned out.
Maintaining the fast pace he set in
the game against the Palo Alto team,
Philippi allowed only six scattered
hits, only one of which went for extra
bases, in secen innings, and retired
twelve men by the strike-out route,
walked one, and hit one batsman.
Sobieski, who replaced him at the
beginning of the eighth, also went well,
faning three men and allowing two
singles.
