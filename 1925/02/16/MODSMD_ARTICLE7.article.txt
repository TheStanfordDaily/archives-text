j ished. If the Cardinal babes can win
again when the two teams meet here
| Friday night, the series will be over
and the Encina men may contemplate
the basketball and football Cub-skins
hanging side by side.
In every department of the game
Friday night the Cardinals were su
perior, particularly in the scoring de
partment. Not once did California get
the lead.
Vincenti Starts Scoring
Vincenti started making points for
Stanford on free throws, scoring three
before either team made any baskets
from the floor. Captain Clark, playing
center, found the basket right after
wards and everybody kept his eye on
it from then on.
Clark, Vincenti, and Crist worked
well together through the Blue and
Gold defense and at half time these
three had brought the score up to 15-7,
with Clark making most of the points.
In the second half, the Cubs speeded
up a bit, Hurff and Walton getting
under way, but as they commenced
scoring, so did Vincenti and Crist and
the lead was maintained.
Clark Stars
The contest was, for the most part,
slow and one-sided. Captain Clark was
the outstanding man on the Card five,
scoring 16 of the 32 points. Vincenti
and Crist were responsible for some
pretty floor work.
For California, Hurff was the star,
making 11 points. Walton and Rucker.
who alternated at the other forward
job, made 10 counts between them.
The result of this battle, which
spilled the sporting dope all over the
place, makes the chances look favor-
