# FRESHMEN DEFEAT BERKELEY QUINTET
## Victors Exhibit High Grade Class of Ball in All Branches of Game 
### 
With a 32-23 victory over the Cali
j fornia 1928 iive to their credit, the
I Stanford freshman basketball team
J returned to the Farm after Friday
night's game with their job half fin
j ished. If the Cardinal babes can win
again when the two teams meet here
| Friday night, the series will be over
and the Encina men may contemplate
the basketball and football Cub-skins
hanging side by side.
In every department of the game
Friday night the Cardinals were su
perior, particularly in the scoring de
partment. Not once did California get
the lead.
Vincenti Starts Scoring
Vincenti started making points for
Stanford on free throws, scoring three
before either team made any baskets
from the floor. Captain Clark, playing
center, found the basket right after
wards and everybody kept his eye on
it from then on.
Clark, Vincenti, and Crist worked
well together through the Blue and
Gold defense and at half time these
three had brought the score up to 15-7,
with Clark making most of the points.
In the second half, the Cubs speeded
up a bit, Hurff and Walton getting
under way, but as they commenced
scoring, so did Vincenti and Crist and
the lead was maintained.
Clark Stars
The contest was, for the most part,
slow and one-sided. Captain Clark was
the outstanding man on the Card five,
scoring 16 of the 32 points. Vincenti
and Crist were responsible for some
pretty floor work.
For California, Hurff was the star,
making 11 points. Walton and Rucker.
who alternated at the other forward
job, made 10 counts between them.
The result of this battle, which
spilled the sporting dope all over the
place, makes the chances look favor-
able for a second victory for the red
shirts when the teams meet on the
Farm. Whereas the Stanford eligibility
list was carefully checked at the be
ginning of the season, California over
looked the high school scholarship of
Dougery until it was pointed out be
fore the game Friday.
The loss of this man affected the
efficiency of the Bruin five consider
ably, since he has been playing regu
larly. What steps can be taken to work
the reshaped team into a more perfect
unit will have to be taken this week at
California, while Stanford will practice
on remedying what weakness was
made evident Friday and putting th*e
finishing touches on a unit which is
already working smoothly.
The lineups were as follows:
Stanford California
Crist (5) F Walton (4)
Vincenti (9) F Hurff (11)
Clark (16) C Peterson (2)
Dennis G Carmicheal
Biaggini G Beckwith
Substitutions â€”Stanford: King (2)
for Vincenti, Davidson for Dennis.
California: Rucker (6) for Walton,
Iverson for Hurff, Bradley for Beck
with.
