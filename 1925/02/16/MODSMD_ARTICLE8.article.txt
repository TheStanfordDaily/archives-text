# STANFORD'S 145'S FALL BEFORE ATTACK OF BEAR FIVE
## 
### 
In a one-sided affair the Stanford
145's took a beating at the hands of
California Friday night at Berkeley
when they were snowed under by a
30 to 14 count. The game was rather
slow and ragged, neither team showing
the class of which they are capable.
At half time, with the score in Cali
fornia's favor 14-10, the Cards came
the closest to catching the lead as any
other time during the game. The Bears,
however, continued to pull away as
the second frame progressed.
Captain Clark, who was elected just
; before the game, played his usual
| aggressive, scrappy game. Although lie
and aims kept on their toes every
minute the California forwards man
aged to seep through often enough to
chalk up an occasional basket.
Stewart was high point man for the
Redshirts. He seemed the only Stan
ford player who could find the basket
i with any regularity. Blazier hasn't
j risen from his slump in basket-shoot
ing but played a commendable floor
game, nevertheless.
