# Oxford Debaters Unimpressed By American College System
## 
### Robert Littler 
Probably few of the universities
visited by the tree Oxford debaters
during their tour of America were
quite prepared for exactly what they
found in the Oxford men, both on the
platform and off. The radically differ
ent. approaches that the debaters found
to questions that are considered almost
| daily in this country started new lines
of thought abong many who were
! privileged for the first time to view
some actual English education in ac

me seems appalling. It implies a scram

crowds out some of the finest values

and students are too earnest for high
scholarship. It. is a great mistake to do
! everything too well. There are many
j things that, although they are worth !
j doing, are not worth doing well."
