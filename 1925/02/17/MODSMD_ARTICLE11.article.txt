# Oxford Debaters Unimpressed By American College System
## 
### Robert Littler 
Probably few of the universities
visited by the tree Oxford debaters
during their tour of America were
quite prepared for exactly what they
found in the Oxford men, both on the
platform and off. The radically differ
ent. approaches that the debaters found
to questions that are considered almost
| daily in this country started new lines
of thought abong many who were
! privileged for the first time to view
some actual English education in ac
' tion.
Take the fraternity problem, for
example. It is a much debated ques
tion here, and yet everyone will agree
that there is much to be said for fra
ternities. But -the three Englishmen
were unanimous in condemning them.
J. I). Woodruff, the leader of the Ox
ford team, expressed their idea when
be said, "The college fraternities seem
I to exist to force their members into a

mould. The pressure on the individual
is tremendous. Every tangent and i
every angle that would make him
stand out as an individual is removed.
One fraternity man told me that they
took in only the boys who gave prom
ise of 'doing something big.' That to
me seems appalling. It implies a scram
ble for a ertain sort of success that
crowds out some of the finest values
of living."
American Colleges Over-Organized
They enjoyed contrasting the Ameri
can plan of university with that of
Oxford. "There is genial tolerance at
! Oxford," said Woodruff, "for students
who would rather talk than work.
| American colleges are over-organized,
and students are too earnest for high
scholarship. It. is a great mistake to do
! everything too well. There are many
j things that, although they are worth !
j doing, are not worth doing well."
M. C. Hollis, another member of the |
team, believes that American educa
tion "hinders freedom and spontaneity.
You work so fiard you get all tired.
"Few persons have a taste for scholar
ship, which is of no more importance
in itself than a taste for doughnuts or
cabbage. It is a mistake for a college
to try to force education on a student."
Malcolm Mac Donald, the third mem
ber of the team, found more to his
liking in American universities than
either of the other visitors. He
said he sympathized with tho earnest
ness of „the American college man.
When asked how he thought American
students would compare with English
students, he cast a suggestive smile
at one of the Stanford debaters and
said, "I haven't seen enough American
students to know."
Culture Evident
The most striking thing about the
conversation of the Oxford men was
their general culture. Probably it
would be difficult to find five men on
the Stanford campus, faculty included,
who had the same degree of broad
knowledge as Hollis, Woodruff, and
Macdonald. They could talk with equal
facility about Herbert Sflencer, "Ben-
Hur," or the French military railroad
across Africa. And on all subjects they
would have something worth while to
say.
With the exception of Mac Donald,
however, they displayed a signal lack
of sufficient capacity in any one field
that would enable them to put them
selves forward in the open competi
tion of the actual world. Mac Donald is
obviously a man of politics, and a
good one.
Another particularly distinguishable
thing about the Englishmen, with the
exception of Mac Donald again, was
their "careless disregard for their ap
pearance. Woodruffff continually push
es his feiir full over big face, with little
care whether he gets it back where it

I should he or not. Neither Hollis nor
i Woodruff were disturbed in the least
when they walked in to a dinner party .
where everyone dressed formally and
they wWe suits that had passed the
margin of utility several months be-1
I fore. Mac Donald was not so. He
dressed well, and always looked what
Americans would term appropriate to
the occasion.
