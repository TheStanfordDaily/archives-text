# MYSTERIOUS FIRING NEAR QUAD LAID TO SCIENTIFIC GUNMAN
## 
### 
The more timid members of the stu- (
j dent body are giving the Physics cor
| ner a wide berth -these days, prefer-1
( ring to walk around the Quad rather
1 than brave that battleground of
j science.
For the past few weeks a regular
i hurricane of revolver shots has been
emanating from the general direction
of the field opposite the Physics lab- j
; oratory, and inquisitive students have j
fonly been able to discern the solitary
I figure of a man nonchalantly firing.
I aimlessly at the air. A closer investi-1
gation seemed extremely dangerous j
i and foolhardy.
A daring Sequoian was the first to
discover what it was all about. Care
fully wending his way from tree trunk j
j to tree trunk, he crept towards the j
j unknown warrior, and just as one ! <
1 pistol-full of cartridges had been ex-;
j pended, leaped forth from his hiding
| place and asked for an explanation.
The answer was easy. The Physics
department has merely been conduct
ing a series of experiments on the
speed at which sound travels.
