# DORMITORY EATING RULE SUBJECT OF WEDNESDAY FORUM
## 
### 
The recent University ruling which
will compel all men living in Univer
sity dormitories to eat in the dining
halls connected with those * dormi
tories, going into effect at the begin
ning of the fall quarter, will be the
topic of discussion at the Open Forum
which will be conducted by the Euphro
nia Debating Society in the lobby of
the Old Union at 7:30 tomorrow eve
ning.
The specific subject is, "Should the
Administration compel a Stanford stu
dent to eat in his own dormitory?" but
it is expected that the question will
work itself into the problem of
whether the Administration can issue
compulsory regulations on any subject
whatsoever.
Roth to Speak
Comptroller A. E. Roth will open the
discussion with a talk upholding the
side of the Administration and will ex
plain the situation that has made the
University regulation imperative.
William L. Gosslin, president of the
Euphronia Club, has received an
annonvmous letter giving facts on the
eating situation in one of the dormi
tories. This letter will be read after
Roth's talk, as a presentation of the
students' side of the case.
Frank and heated discussion of the
problem is invited, and several out
spoken opponents of the University
regulations have promised to give
their views on the subject.
This will be the fourth of the series
of five Open Forums which are being
sponsored by Euphronia this quarter.
The subject for this discussion was
chosen by the members of the last
Open Forum, held on February 4. The
question for the next forum, which
will be held on March 4, will be the
Sorority-Fraternity problem. Dean Yost
will have returned to the campus by
then,, and will have an opportunity
to express her views on the problem.
The discussion tomorrow night is
open to all interested in campus prob
lems.
