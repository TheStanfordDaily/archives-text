### 
Professor Douglas Houghton Camp
bel, head of the Botany department,
has announced that his book, "An Out
line of Plant Geography," will be ready
for publication soon.
Professor Campbell has been work
ing on this book for several years and,
as this is his last year in the Univer
sity, it will probably be the last work
he will write as professor at Stanford.
He is one of the few remaining pro
fessors who came to the University
the day it opened. Except for sabbati
cal leaves Professor Campbell has
spent all of his time at this institution.
