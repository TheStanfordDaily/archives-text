# VETERAN CAST WILL PRESENT "MACBETH" IN ASSEMBLY HALL
## 
### Wilbur Adams 
Stanford drama settles down to a
' more serious type of production. Dur
! ing this year the college theatergoers
have had a taste of comedy and a
taste of farce, and now they will have
the privilege of trying the flavor of a
real tragedyâ€”"Macbeth."
Delmer Daves is in the lead as Mac
' beth. Daves is well known and well
i liked by the Stanford audience. He
made his college debut as "Count
| Manchini" in "He Who Gets Slapped,"
a play that was presented in the fall
of 1922. Since that time he has been
active in all types of Stanford produc
tions. Daves' greatest success was in
! the part of the villain in the comic
j drama, "Captain Applejack," presented
: last year.
I Daves will not be alone in his glory.
Helen Feldman will be his lady for the
evening. Miss Feldman has never ap
i peared before a Stanford audience, but
j she has had plenty of experience else
where, having taken part in numerous
! amateur productions, and was on the
professional stage for *a time.
Macduff will be played by Raymond
Riese, who will be remembered for his
part in the sophomore play, "Dulcy."
James du Prau will characterize King
! Duncan, and Robert Carr will be in
the role of Banquo.
The characters are already familiar
with their lines, so Gordon Davis*
I whole time can be used in perfecting
the acting of the players. There are
(three left in which to do this.
