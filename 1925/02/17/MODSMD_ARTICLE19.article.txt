# Let's Have Precincts
## 
### 
When it was suggested in this column last year that a precinct system
of voting would improve campus elections immeasureably, nothing was said
disputing the idea and a great many favorable opinions were expressed.
By making balloting more convenient and by eliminating the long lines
at the two polls now used, the precinct polling plan will induce more
students to participate in elections and will make for a more accurate dis
covery of campus sentiment.
Adoption of this scheme would necessitate no change in the present
theory of conducting elections, for the university directory would be used
to check against repeating and the precinct results might be added together
to obtain campus totals, as under the present system. It would require
more help, but that is no drawback. A great many volunteer clerks are
turned away from the polls at each election whose services might well
be used.
There is no provision in the A. S. S. U. constitution concerning elec
tions save that the Election Board make the rules. When a dispute arose
over a detail of the last election, it was discovered that so far as the
Election Board was concerned, there were no rules. The body has no
records because it has never been known to confer, largely because no
meetings have ever been called.
We cannot urge too strongly the necessity for some sort of order in
this matter. Extemporaneous rules may be all for the best, but sometimes
such rules seriously handicap proper action.
Whether or not the precinct matter is favorably acted upon by the
board, and we hope it is favorably considered, some formality is needed in
the matter of rules. The memory of man is too likely to err if there is no
written memorandum to help him.
By way of making the matter easier, we present some suggested rules
for the Election Board to consider at the meeting which we hope will be
held as soon as possible. Any discussion which will help to clear up
doubtful points will be printed as questions arise.
Let's have action and let's have precincts.
