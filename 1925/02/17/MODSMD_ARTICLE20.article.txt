# It Was the Very Devil Himself, in Fact

### 
Last year the Ram's Head Society invited campus writers to submit
plays to a competition from which the recent show was to have been picked.
A considerable number of students prepared material of a burlesque
nature, with the encouragement of the society, and an exactly equal num
l)er of competitors were disappointed. All of the books entered in the
contest were rejected and Ram's Head chose to get its play from another
source.
It was all very well for Ram's Head to do as it pleased about such mat
ters. That is its privilege. At the same time it was natural for the per
sons who went to $ome trouble to compete in what they thought was a
contest to have a decided reaction when their collective works were dis
regarded.
There is no sense in remarking that the grapes were sour. One can't
get up any argument on lliat. The "competing" playwrights freely admit
that the grapes must have been sweet. The rub is that those who were
supposed to have a chance to pick the grapes didn't pick them. Tt was
the "competitors" who were picked—for green peas—and by nothing of
lesser importance than "The Devil's Daughter." |
