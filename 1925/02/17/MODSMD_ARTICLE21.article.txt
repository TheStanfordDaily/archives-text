Aud they laughed at "Oh, it Is all
so sad! My horse, my little horse!"
Friday evening.
If this is so—and it is—why, in the
name of le Papa Bob Dieu isn't half
the campus chuckling gleefully at the
other half most of the time?
Yes, well, perhaps it is.
It has been almost two years since
Lagunita fulfilled its destiny. Why
doesn't some philanthropic soul men
tion —before too many moons —for the
benefit of -the uninformed, the fact
that the human voice can be heard
across that body of water more clearly
than over a radio.
And then, there are other things: if
only some philanthropic soul could be
found!
Now that Roble has joined Lagunita
in the protest against dryness, we take
heart and timidly suggest—more sug
gestions—
It seems to be characteristic of the
sub-sophomoric mind (and they all
aren't topped with dinks) that every
thing is funny except its own dates
and D's in history.
It is miraculous —the influence upon
the cosmos the outcome of a citizen
ship course or the attitude of one
individual can have!
This is the first morning in eons it
hasn't rained at 8:57 a.m.
But, as Herodotus said, "Every dog's
gotta have his day—l'm bavin' mine,
and I'm willin' —Everything's comin'
my way!"
