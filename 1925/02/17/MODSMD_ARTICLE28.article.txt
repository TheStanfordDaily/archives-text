# SPORTS OF 1925
## "Pie" of the Pirates 
### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
As the days of Arnica, "bear stories," and spring training rapidly approach,
give a thought to the young third baseman of the Pittsburgh ball club, who
wears the gatsoronomical-sounding name of "Pie."
In 1922 young Mr. Traynor was hailed as a "comer." In 1923 "Pie" was
acclaimed the best third baseman of the year. In 1924 he suffered somewhat
of a slump. But I am here to venture a prediction that in 1925 Brother
Traynor will even surpass his record of two seasons ago.
Every player has a slump now and then. Cobb's record in 1908, his fourth
season with the Tigers, was well below his 1907 record, in the same number
of games. And Traynor's 1924 record was nothing to sneeze at. He played in
11 less games than the year before, yet managed to hit .291, which is a better
batting average than such stars as Stuffy Mclnnis, Charley Grimm, Heinie
Groh, and Casey Stengel could accumulate. "Pie" stole 25 bases in 1924, and
only his teammates Cuyler and Carey exceeded that number in the National
League.
Big events happen on November 11th. The Armistice came then, and Harold
Joseph Traynor was born on that date in 1899. Watch "Pie's" smoke in 1925 â€”
he is fast on his feet, has a sure pair of hands, a fine throwing arm, and is a
good batter in spite of a slightly blurred vision. Ty Cobb, too, has one bad eye.
