# CALIFORNIA FIVE HAS EDGE ON CARDS
## 
### 
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA,
Feb. 16. —Although California again
demonstrated their superiority over
the Stanford quintet in their second
game, the Cards showed a great deal
of improvement over their work of the
previous Saturday and if they improve
as much this week, the Bruins will
have to fight to capture the third con
test. Andy Kerr's Cards, however, fig
tire to win the next game on their o#n
court and withhold the onslaught of
the Bears for another week.
"Nibs" Price is in hopes of taking the
deciding contest from the Cards in
the next game and making it three
successive victories. This would be
quite a performance for the Bears and
would mark "Nibs" Price's system of
coaching as a very efficient one. It
would not be at all surprising to see
the California team romp off with the
deciding game, as they now have the
Cards on the jump and intend to finish
them Saturday night. The Bruins are
continuing to practice hard and will
not let up until Friday.
Although Higgins and Belasco, Cali
fornia stars, were weakened by their
injuries, they both played a good game
and with added strength will be in
good shape to meet Stanford in the
third battle. Individually and collec*
tively the Bruins went great in the
second game. They were there in the
pinch and that was what decided the
strenuous contest, Captain Ladar
showed the best shooting ability he
has so far shown this season and
Holmes at the other forward position
played a wonderful floor game. Belas
co, although weakened from fever,
played the whole game and was high
point man for the Bears. -Carver and
Fechter at standing guard, and Wat
son, sophomore center, played a fine
brand of basketball. These men will
probably all be seen in action against
the Cards in the third meeting of the
teams.
In the preliminary game the fast
130-pound teams of the two institutions
will meet in their second game. The
Bruin lightweights decisively con
quered the Card 130's, 31-17, in the
preliminary to the varsity contest Sat
urday night and expect to again de
feat the Stanford team. Coach Ned

' Kay's fighting Bear lightweights
showed great superiority over the
, Cards in the first game due especially
jto the basket-shooting of Kotta and
i the flopr-work of Captain Don Leith.
: Coach Hal Davis' Cardinal 130-pound
team is preparing to stage a comeback
against the Bruins on their own court
; Saturday night, and hope to win the
I second battle, making a third contest
necessary.

successive victories. This would be
quite a performance for the Bears and
would mark "Nibs" Price's system of
coaching as a very efficient one. It
would not be at all surprising to see
the California team romp off with the
deciding game, as they now have the
Cards on the jump and intend to finish
them Saturday night. The Bruins are
continuing to practice hard and will
not let up until Friday.
Although Higgins and Belasco, Cali
fornia stars, were weakened by their
injuries, they both played a good game
and with added strength will be in
good shape to meet Stanford in the
third battle. Individually and collec*
tively the Bruins went great in the
second game. They were there in the
pinch and that was what decided the
strenuous contest, Captain Ladar
showed the best shooting ability he
has so far shown this season and
Holmes at the other forward position
played a wonderful floor game. Belas
co, although weakened from fever,
played the whole game and was high
point man for the Bears. -Carver and
Fechter at standing guard, and Wat
son, sophomore center, played a fine
brand of basketball. These men will
probably all be seen in action against
the Cards in the third meeting of the
teams.
In the preliminary game the fast
130-pound teams of the two institutions
will meet in their second game. The
Bruin lightweights decisively con
quered the Card 130's, 31-17, in the
preliminary to the varsity contest Sat
urday night and expect to again de
feat the Stanford team. Coach Ned

' Kay's fighting Bear lightweights
showed great superiority over the
, Cards in the first game due especially
jto the basket-shooting of Kotta and
i the flopr-work of Captain Don Leith.
: Coach Hal Davis' Cardinal 130-pound
team is preparing to stage a comeback
against the Bruins on their own court
; Saturday night, and hope to win the
I second battle, making a third contest
necessary.
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA,
Feb. 16. —Although California again
demonstrated their superiority over
the Stanford quintet in their second
game, the Cards showed a great deal
of improvement over their work of the
previous Saturday and if they improve
as much this week, the Bruins will
have to fight to capture the third con
test. Andy Kerr's Cards, however, fig
tire to win the next game on their o#n
court and withhold the onslaught of
the Bears for another week.
"Nibs" Price is in hopes of taking the
deciding contest from the Cards in
the next game and making it three
successive victories. This would be
quite a performance for the Bears and
would mark "Nibs" Price's system of
