# Star Varsity Outfielder Is Declared Ineligible
## 
### 
"Lefty" May, star outfielder of the
i varsity baseball team, lias been declared
; ineligible for playing during the 1925
baseball games. "Lefty" can no longer
I play on the varsity due to his being used
as a pinch hitter on one occasion in the
1 1922 game against Santa Clara.
During this game "Lefty" did not even
| run the bases and simply came to bat
once, the only time that season. He was
; declared eligible after he had brought up
J the question himself which he did in order
to prevent complications that might arise
at a later time. "Lefty" has played in the
outfield for the past two years and was
I the main reason for the Stanford victory
in the second California game last year
i when he made a home run.
