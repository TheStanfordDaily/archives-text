# YEARLING BASEBALL NINE WILL MEET SAN MATEO
## Hunt's Team Expected to Annex Third Straight Victory Tomorrow 
### 
Weather permitting, Coach "Husky"
; Hunt's freshman nine will take on San
Mateo high school at 4 o'clock tomor
row afternoon on the yearling dia
mond.
The freshmen have won the only
two games they have played this sea
son by sizeable records, and unless the
San Mateo aggregation possesses
greater strength than the average
prep school squad, Hunt's men should
make it three straight tomorrow. The
record made by the peninsula ball
tossers this season is not known, but
in past years they have finished near
the top in their athletic league.
Philippi has performed the bulk of
the mound duty to date for the Cardi
nal babes, and has fanned twenty-four
men in twelve innings, a record which
any pitcher can well be proud of. So
any pitcher can well be proud. So
bieski can relieve him at any time
without weakening the attack of the
team. The latter player has enough
stuff on the ball to earn him a place
as leading liurler and would do most
of the work if it were not for Philippi's
outstanding power.
Sypher an Asset
Sypher, behind the plate, is one of
the greatest assets the freshmen have
because of his aggressiveness. He
continually shouts encouragement to
his mates and keeps them keyed up to
the highest point of efficiency. Al
though he committed two errors in
the game against St. Ignatius he more
xa s ! l I Jiastnjq nr?qV
all-around work. Sypher has a power
ful throw which should catch many
runners at second, and he is a fair
hitter.
Outfield Slugs Ball
The outfield is well taken care of by
Nissen in left, Maguire in center, and
Sims in right. Every member of the
trio can be depended upon to pound
the ball to all corners of the lot. Nis
sen made a number of pretty catches
last Saturday, and collected a hit.
Maguire crashed out a single, a dou
ble, and a triple in four times at bat,
and Sims contributed one bingle.
Weaver took Sims' place in right dur
ing the last half of the game and
proved himself a comer. He handled
the few chances that came his way in
nice shape, and drove in a run with a
timely single.
The team as a whole has a high bat
ting average, and can be depended
upon to make trouble for almost any
hurler who qpposes it. With the excep
tion of the pitchers, only two men
failed to connect in the St. Ignatius
game, and one of these scored a run.
Like most freshman nines the squad
lacks experience, but with two games
per week scheduled for the next cou
ple of months this deficiency should
be quickly surmounted.

An epidemic of the mumps recently
put about forty students of the Uni
versity of Kansas in the hospital.

all-around work. Sypher has a power
ful throw which should catch many
runners at second, and he is a fair
hitter.
Outfield Slugs Ball
The outfield is well taken care of by
Nissen in left, Maguire in center, and
Sims in right. Every member of the
trio can be depended upon to pound
the ball to all corners of the lot. Nis
sen made a number of pretty catches
last Saturday, and collected a hit.
Maguire crashed out a single, a dou
ble, and a triple in four times at bat,
and Sims contributed one bingle.
Weaver took Sims' place in right dur
ing the last half of the game and
proved himself a comer. He handled
the few chances that came his way in
nice shape, and drove in a run with a
timely single.
The team as a whole has a high bat
ting average, and can be depended
upon to make trouble for almost any
hurler who qpposes it. With the excep
tion of the pitchers, only two men
failed to connect in the St. Ignatius
game, and one of these scored a run.
Like most freshman nines the squad
lacks experience, but with two games
per week scheduled for the next cou
ple of months this deficiency should
be quickly surmounted.

An epidemic of the mumps recently
put about forty students of the Uni

Weather permitting, Coach "Husky"
; Hunt's freshman nine will take on San
Mateo high school at 4 o'clock tomor
row afternoon on the yearling dia
mond.
The freshmen have won the only
two games they have played this sea
son by sizeable records, and unless the
San Mateo aggregation possesses
greater strength than the average
prep school squad, Hunt's men should
make it three straight tomorrow. The
record made by the peninsula ball
tossers this season is not known, but
in past years they have finished near
the top in their athletic league.
Philippi has performed the bulk of
the mound duty to date for the Cardi
nal babes, and has fanned twenty-four
men in twelve innings, a record which
any pitcher can well be proud of. So
any pitcher can well be proud. So
bieski can relieve him at any time
without weakening the attack of the
team. The latter player has enough
stuff on the ball to earn him a place
as leading liurler and would do most
of the work if it were not for Philippi's
outstanding power.
Sypher an Asset
Sypher, behind the plate, is one of
the greatest assets the freshmen have
because of his aggressiveness. He
continually shouts encouragement to
his mates and keeps them keyed up to
the highest point of efficiency. Al
