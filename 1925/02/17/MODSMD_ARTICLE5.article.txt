# CARDINAL SWIMMERS TRAIN FOR COMING P.A.A. JUNIOR MEET
## 
### 
In anticipation of the P. A .A. Junior
championships to be held February 25,
Coach Ernie Brandsten is grooming his
Cardinal swimmers, hoping to garner a
first place and a more imposing array of
points than were obtained at a similar
meet last month/ The coming event's will
be held in the Oylmpic Club pool in San
Francisco.
Showings made in the recent dual meet
with Northwestern University and in the
interclass meet from the basis on which
Brandsten is selecting his entries for the
championships. The squad making the
trip will be composed entirely of varsity
swimmers according to the information
at hand.
Four events are on the program: the
50-yard sprint, 220-yard breast stroke,
relay, and medley. The latter is composed
of 100 yards swim breast stroke, another
hundred back stroke, and the last hun
dred in the regulation free style.
Fletcher to Enter Medley.
Fletcher who took third in the 50-yard
free style swim against Northwestern is
one of the best bets the Cardinals have to
offer in this race. The time in that race
was 0:26 but in the interclass race at
that distance the line was touched in 0:27.
Schwartz who beat Fletcher in the in
terclass meet is another man who will put
up a fight in the 50-yard sprint.

Captain Schmeider and Pyzel are the
entries at' present named for the 220-yard
breast stroke event. Brandsten expects
to select a third man for this race some
time during the next few days. Baker,
Sherman, Kenney, Prentiss, Waterhouse,
and Mack, will be in the competition to
fill this vacancy in the lineup.

Five men have been named from whom
four will be picked to make up the 400-
yard relay team. Schwartz, Fletcher,
Brooks, Wright, and MacAllister will all
be on deck for this event.
