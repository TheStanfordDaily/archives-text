# CHAPPIE HURLS DEFI AT SCIENTISTS; FILLS TWO BOOKS AT ONCE
## 
### 
Claims advanced recently by psy
j chologists, that it is impossible to do
! two things at once, were today de- j
I dared false and misleading by Chapar-!
ral, campus jester, in an impassioned
: address delivered from the window of
his ofi'icecs on the second floor of the
i Press building. As a proof of his con
tention, the Ancient One pointed to
the fact that two magazines are now j
in process of construction under his 1
I I
benevolent eye; one, the Faculty Num
! ber, to go on sale early in March; the
other, a joint issue with the Cornell
Widow, to be out a month later.
A polished flow of high-falutin lan
guage, in strange contrast to the Old j
Boy's usual lioarty style, marked this
morning's tirade. It is not known j
whether the change has been brought j
about by close association with the
faculty members who are in charge of
the next issue, or over-indulgence in |
cross-word puzzles.
"In order that the joint number of
: Chaparral-Widow may appear simul
taneously on the two campuses—or,
more properly, carapi—it is essential
that art material be in this office by
next Thursday evening, and literary
contributions on the following Mon
day," the Aged Fellow remarked, pol
ishing his glasses feverishly.
Here the Old Boy screamed slightly
and reverted to type. "It's quality what
we want," he tocsincd, pounding the
radiator. "This is a fine chance for you
guya to get famous, and besides, we
got a reputation to maintain."
