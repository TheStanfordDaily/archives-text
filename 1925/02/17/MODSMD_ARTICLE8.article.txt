# STANFORD INVITED TO ENTER DRAKE RELAYS NEXT MAY
## 
### 
Stanford has received an invitation
to send a track team to the Drake
relay carnival which takes place in
May. If the invitation is accepted,
Stanford will not enter a team in the
I.C.A.A.A.A. track meet. No definite
action has been taken on the matter yet.
Besides the regular track and field
events, the Drake meet consists of
numerous relay races. Drake is fam
ous for the times that have been made
in the various relays. It is a national
affair and the foremost colleges in the
country enter teams.
Last season on the Stanford oval
Richardson, Swayne, Smith, and Mcin
tosh came within a few seconds of
breaking the Drake record in the two
mile relay. The Stanford half-milers
were running against time, which was
a considerable handicap. If a man can
be found to take Mcintosh's place,
Stanford would stand a good chance
to win the event, and perhaps to
break the record.
In a four-mile relay, Stanford could
enter Kerr, Smith, Cypher, and
Charles. These four milers all run the
distance in around 4 minutes and 30
seconds. It would be difficult for an
other university in the country to col
lect four runners that could average
better.
The national track meet will be held
at San Francisco in June of this year.
This will give the eastern colleges an
opportunity to make a cross-country
trip.
