# S. A. E. WINS FROM KAPPA SIGMA IN PLAY-OFF GAME
## Japanese Club, El Toro, And Encina 1E Advance to Semi-Final Round 
### Al Post 
Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Japanese Club,
Encina lE, and EI Toro survived the
preliminary elimination round in intra
mural basketball yesterday, ami will
meet tomorrow in the semi-finals.
Three of the four contests were so
close that the outcome was in doubt
until the final whistle.
The scores: Japanese Clubs 17,
Alpha Kappa Lambda 16; Sigma Alpha
Epsilon 14, Kappa Sigma 10; Encina
IE 22, Chi Psi 8; El Toro 19, Theta Xi
14.
Lightning-like speed and deadly goal
shooting enabled the Japanese Club to
nose out Alpha Kappa Lambda in the
most thrilling game of the day. A. K. L.
furnished equally accurate goal-shoot
ing but was not quite fast enough to
keep the Japanese from taking shots
at the basket. Both fives were light,
but the fraternity team had the ad
vantage in height.
Kitow started the scoring early in
the game by looping in a basket for
the Japanese, but Cornell came right
back for A. K. L. with two points on as
many free throws, and sent his quintet
into the lead a moment later with a
field goal. Kitow made honors even
with a basket and put his club ahead
with a free throw. Although A. K. L.
; threatened many times .after that it
: never again held the advantage.
Kitow and Sano divided scoring
I honors for the Japanese, and for sev
i eral minutes at a stretch were almost
j infallible in sinking every shot they
attempted. The club led 13 to 8 at the
! end of the first half. In the second
( period the A. K. L.'s rallied and Bar
i nett brought them within one point of
j a tie by annexing a field goal just as
; (he whistle blew. Cornell furnished
most of the fireworks for the fraternity
men, contributing 14 of their 16 points.
Barnett and McDougall played good
floor games.
S. A. E.'s Show Power
Sigma Alpha Epsilon showed power
which will probably bring it through
to the final round when it took a hard
fought 14 to 10 victory from Kappa
Sigma. The Kappa Sigs started off like
q. whirlwind and looked like winners
during the tirst half when they ran up
a 4 to 1 lead, Middleton and Hey chalk
ing up baskets.
S. A. E. came back strong at the
opening of the second period and
played rings around their opponents,
keeping thefh away from the basket
most of the time. The Stevenson broth
ers and Gibbons showed fine teamwork
for the winners, while Newkirk and
Deffebach were the outstanding play
ers for Kappa Sigma. Cliff Hey was
forced out of the game in the second
period with an ugly gash below his
eye.
Encina 1E Fast
The light, fast Encina IE squad
walked away from Chi Psi in the first
evening game, winning 22 to 8. It was
another case where speed and shifti
ness were superior to beef. The Chi
Psis could not fiml the basket with
anything like the deadly effect they
had achieved in past encounters, and
the freshmen pivoted and dodged out
of the clutches of the fraternity guards
and so were in a position to take
plenty of shots at the hoop.
Dobson, Cook, and Carlsmith regis- j
tered on a large proportion of their i
chances, Dobson in particular tossing !
in many baskets at long range. Men
zies of the Chi Psis had an off night,
scoring only two points. Van King
accounted for the other six tallies. The
row men held down their own total
by refusing to shoot several times
when they had the opportunity. Encina

[ was ahead 14 to 6 at half time.
El Toro sprung the surprise of the
day by taking Theta Xi into camp by '
a 19 to 14 score. Previous to their
defeat Theta Xi had been a general
favorite to reach the finals. El Toro
looked unimposing at the start of the
season but has improved with every
game. The club men have developed I
a fast passing attack which is executed |
by moderately heavy men.
Rupe, Clifford, Arthur, and Crever
were the main cogs in El Toro'a attack, 1
the first three running up an eight
point lead before Theta Xi knew what
it was all about. The Row men

|
launched a formidable counter attack
towards the end of the first half and
' continued it in the second period until
Mulchay's free throw tied the score
at 14 p. Crever put El Toro on top
the next minute with a free throw, and
] the club men gradually forged ahead
until they held a five-point advantage
j as the game ended.
The semi-finals will be played ol'f
i tomorrow as follows: Japanese Club
vs. Sigma Alpha Epstlon, 4:15; Encina
IE vs. El Toro, 4:50. There is some
possibility that the finals will be staged
! as a preliminary to one of the varsity
\ or weight team games next week.
