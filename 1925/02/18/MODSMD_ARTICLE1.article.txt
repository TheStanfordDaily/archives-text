# YEARLING COURT TEAM WILL MEET BRUINS ON FRIDAY
## Berkeley Quintet Will Not Be Caught Off Guard In Second Game 
### 
Coach "Husky" Hunt, freshman bas
ketball coach, is putting his team
through a stiff workout preparatory to
the second game with the California
freshmen next Friday night.
Hunt believes that the Berkeley five
was caught napping Friday night and
loes not expect to find them in that
condition for the next game. The
declaration of the ineligibility of Doug
ery, California guard, however, should
not have come as a surprise to the
Blue and Gold authorities, according
to Hunt, for his ineligibility for the
Stanford game was known long before
the game.
1928 Five Works Hard
The Cardinal quintet has been put
through fast paces this week. There
will be no let-up because the Stan
ford babes came through victors in
the initial game.
A considerable amount of attention
is being given by Hunt to the fact
that in the second half, after a shift
in combinations, the California team
scored 16 points, a small margin be
hind the 17 points that Stanford gath
ered. The fact is not overlooked that
if the change had been made earlier
the 15 to 7 lead of the Cards might
not have been attained.
Babes Earned Victory
The Cardinal yearlings earned their
victory, however, by attaining (he form
which a hard season should have de
veloped at its climax. It is well to
consider, on the other hand, that the
1928 five might have played a Wit
over their heads in the first game, as
Stanford teams have been known to
do in their games with California, so
strong is the desire to administer
defeat to the traditional across-the-bay
rivals. This suggestion, not to discredit
the Stanford babes' victory but to cau
tion against a too-assured expectation
for its repetition.
No change in the line-up is being
considered by Hunt at present and the
opening whistle Friday night will prob
ably find Crist and Vincenti ni the
forward berths, Clark at center, and
Dennis and Biaggini in the guard posi
tions.
