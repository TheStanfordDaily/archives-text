## 
### 
"Cold weather plus a desire not to
interfere with training for the Cali
fornia water polo game has indefinitely
postponed the last game of the inter
class series," said Coach Brandsten
yesterday.
There is a possibility that the game
between the sophomores arid juniors
will be played before February 28
when the Blue and Gold water polo
men will play here. If the game does
not take place before then first place
in the interclass meet will remain un
decided for another week.
Cardinal swimmers will have a
heavy program next week since three
days before the California water polo
game is the set of P. A. A. Junior
championship races at the Olympic
Club pool.
Upon the results of the yet unplayed
interclass game hands the division of
points in the all-'round class contest.
Should the sophomores defeat the jun
iors, as is predicted by many fans,
seniors and sophomores will split first
place points.
The present standing in the class
swimming meet is: sophomores 38,
seniors 42, freshmen 18, juniors 14.
The juniors and sophomores will bat
tle for four points for the winner .and
two points for the loser. The seniors
received ten tallies for their victory
over the freshmen, who as runners-up,
received six.
