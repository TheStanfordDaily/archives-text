# OPEN FORUM TREATS DORMITORY EATING SITUATION TONIGHT
## 
### 
"Should the Administration compel
a Stanford student to eat in his own
dormitory?" This is the subject of the
Open Forum discussion which will be
conducted by the Euphronia Debating
Society tonight at 7:30 in the Trophy
Room of the Old Union.
This topic was selected by the mem
bers of the last Open Forum, held on
February 4, as the most vital problem
on the campus at present.
Comptroller A. E. Roth, the only
speaker of the evening, will explain
the dormitory eating situation, and
will show how the University is en
deavoring to settle the problem. The
students' side will be upheld by an
anonymous letter containing several
revelations on the eating situation in
one of the dormitories, which will be
read by W. L. Gosslin, the president
of the society.
The meeting is open to all, and frank
discussion of the problem, which will
probably work itself into the problem
of whether the Administration can is
sue compulsory regulations on ■ such
a subject, is invited.
W. L. Gosslin says, "Although these
meetings are sponsored by Euphronia,
they are not society meetings. The
society is sponsoring them merely be
cause it feels that some organization
must be behind them in order to en
[courago the discussion of vital campus
| problems by university students and
by all those interested in University
affairs."
This is the fourth of the series of
five Open Forum meetings which are
' being conducted by Euphronia this
quarter. The last, held on February 4,
dealt with the problem of racial pre
judice. The next, and last of the quar
ter, will be held on March 4 on the
fraternity-sorority problem, at which
Dean Yost will bo the principal
J speaker.
