# CARDS REM FOR THIRD TILT WITH CALIFORNIA FIVE
## Cards Will Have Advantage Of Pavilion Court in Return Contest 
### David Meiklejohn 
Two victories give the California
varsity quintet considerable of an edge
over the Cardinal five, and it will be a
j tough tussle for the Cards to clear the
j hurdles and even up the series.
California and Stanford are so ob
viously on an even basis that it would
be hard to pick the winner of the next
game, which will be played Saturday
night in the Cardinal pavilion.
Stanford, clearly, made quite a come
back and showing in the second game,
and it took an extra five-minute period
for the Bruin varsity to display any
thing of superior playing ability and
teamwork.
Kerr worked hard all of last week
in an effort to develop speed to coun
teract speed, and he succeeded to a
great degree in building up a suitable
defense. This was brought out clearly
in the first part of the game last Satur
day, when the Bears had such diffi
culty in working the ball through the
tight maze of Stanford's five-man de
fense.
The fact that Ernie Nevers went so
well in the last game is proof that the
veterans are beginning to show some
of their old form. Heretofore the
sophomores have displayed more real
shooting ability. Nevers was really the
cog on which Stanford made its ex
pected comeback, and he was finding
the basket with increasing and dan
gerous regularity during the entire
game.
Playing on its own court the Card
team might possibly manage to nose
out the Bears. Nevertheless this rea
son was undermined in the firut game
when Stanford made such a miserable
showing.
There is little doubt but that "Nibs"
Price's quintet has turned out to be
more or less of a surprise to those
who watched the team in earlier
games. Ladar is always dangerous, and
sure to score if given anything like a
decent opportunity. Belasco follows
the ball with such tenacious fervor
that he manages to keep the ball mov
ing toward the basket, sometime dur
ing the game scoring one of the re
peated attempts.
