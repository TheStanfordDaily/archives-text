# BOXING TEAM WILL MEET DAVIS FARM FIGHTERS SATURDAY
## Captain Martin Leads Green Squad Against Aggies In First Match 
### 
The varsity boxing team engages in
its first match of the season when it
meets the California Aggie fighters at
Davis Farm, Saturday. The squad
leaves Palo Alto Saturday morning and
returns to the campus the next day.
Harry Maloney has brought a team
made up of new men, to a point where
they are all performing well. Cap
tain Vince Martin is the only veteran.
Although little is known of the Davis
boxers, Maloney expects Stanford to
, win the majority of the bouts.
Seven Bouts
The men who fight on Saturday are:
M. C. Collins, bantamweight; Carlos |
Miron, featherweight; Jack Parsons,
! lightweight; Captain Martin, welter- j
weight; Myron Schall, middleweight;
j Rollin Farmin, light-heavyweight; and'
Jim Arthur, heavyweight.
Yince Martin looms up at the pres
ent time as the best of the varsity
fighters. His speed and hard-hitting
helped him to win his bouts last sea-'
son, and he has improved this year. I
Miron and Schall, although new to j
varsity boxing, have been fighting well
j during the fall and winter training I
: period. Miron is a fast featherweight |
j and is expected by Maloney to furnish j
one of the best bouts Saturday.
Schall Going Good
Schall is a rangy middleweight, who 1
has developed his boxing since last j
year, when he was ineligible for ■
the varsity. Farmin and Jim Arthur j
have shown power in the heavier 1
classes. The former is the better boxer, j
but Arthur has shown marked ability j
under Maloney's coaching, although he j
is rather slow at the present time.
Parsons and Collins are both steady !
men in the lighter divisions. Collins !
was defeated in the novice tournament, i
but no judgment can be formed from I
this performance, as he was fighting
above his weight.
Three additional matches are being !
arranged for the boxers. Return bouts
will be held with the Aggies at Stan- j
ford, and two meets with Southern !
Branch University of California, next i
month, are being scheduled.

The University of Kansas has a
radio broadcasting station (KFKU)
which sends out musical programs,
lectures, and plays every day.

ent time as the best of the varsity
fighters. His speed and hard-hitting
helped him to win his bouts last sea-'
son, and he has improved this year. I
Miron and Schall, although new to j
varsity boxing, have been fighting well
j during the fall and winter training I
: period. Miron is a fast featherweight |
j and is expected by Maloney to furnish j
one of the best bouts Saturday.
Schall Going Good
Schall is a rangy middleweight, who 1
has developed his boxing since last j
year, when he was ineligible for ■
the varsity. Farmin and Jim Arthur j
have shown power in the heavier 1
classes. The former is the better boxer, j
but Arthur has shown marked ability j
under Maloney's coaching, although he j
is rather slow at the present time.
Parsons and Collins are both steady !
men in the lighter divisions. Collins !
was defeated in the novice tournament, i
but no judgment can be formed from I
this performance, as he was fighting
above his weight.
Three additional matches are being !
arranged for the boxers. Return bouts
will be held with the Aggies at Stan- j
ford, and two meets with Southern !
Branch University of California, next i
month, are being scheduled.

The University of Kansas has a
radio broadcasting station (KFKU)
which sends out musical programs,
lectures, and plays every day.
