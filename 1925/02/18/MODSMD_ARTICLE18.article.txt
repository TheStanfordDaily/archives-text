# Saturday
## 
### 
Sport writers with their ears to the ground (figuratively speaking, of
course) may detect great things if they pay attention to noises current
around the basketball pavilion. The fact of prime importance which
would surely be discovered is that Stanford is not dead yet.
Amazing as it may seem to our Berkeley colleagues, the varsity has
every intention of taking the next three of what we fondly refer to as
"hoop tilts." They plan on it. They have made engagements to celebrate
the victory after the fifth game. They refuse to be convinced that the
Bears are better aijd they start proving it Saturday. They will tell any
interested persons this in decisive terms and they are determined to make
it stick.
There is an entirely new element in practice. Besides a grim determi
nation, the varsity has a fire of downright anger steaming-up workouts.
When they bring that additional punch out in the remaining games, be
there! There won't be any extra periods.
