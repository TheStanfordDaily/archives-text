# Just Sit Down Anywhere—

### 
In common with other disseminators of information, the staff of the
Daily Palo Alto likes to feel that its material attracts the attention of
somebody. While we cannot require attendance at our class nor conduct
examinations, the occasional viewpoint which recites opinion on our topics
gets the same hearty greeting from us that a professor might feel like giv
ing to a listener who is induced to attend a lecture for reasons having
nothing to do with the scholarship committee.
For some time the editorial column has announced opinions to an en
tirely complacent campus. Either our arguments have defied refutation
or they have not been worthy of more than a yawn. That is, we are either
being like a genius or an idiot. And we don't fancy ourselves in either role.
It is hereby formally announced that the editorial page is a bull-room
and we intend to have you figuratively reclining on the advertising with
your feet propped against the Cabbage column if we have to write forty
outrageous things like that which "D. L." disputes today.
"D. L." has the right idea. That editorial was shamefully one-sided,
which, however, is no reason for believing that one side all wrong. And
while he did better in that respect, there are certain subjects for discussion
suggested by his reply which somelxjdy ought to develop. Not that it
makes any difference now, of course, but it is an amusing topic for
speculation.
There is the Viewpoint column if you would kid the editor, or what
have you. There is Cabbages and Things if you care to be funny or any
thing else extraordinary. ,
If that isn't enough, start something!

CONSIDERABLE COMMENT has been stirred by the Men's
Council recommendation that Certain Student, whoever such an un
lucky man is, be required to take eighteen hours which have been selected
for him by his major department during as many quarters as may inter
vene between the present time and his graduation or his despair.
The case was one having to do somewhat with conduct and somewhat
more with the faculty feeling that the offender was not making a sincere
attempt to get the most out of Stanford, an opportunity which is being
furnished him by an outside agency. The recommendation called for
more serious action. The council's mercy is to be applauded. It is strictly
that agency's business —that part.
What is to be deplored is that any of his fellow-students should be
placed by circumstance in the embarrassing position of having to hand
down such an extraordinarily paternal decision to satisfy a policy not de
termined either by them or by the Associated Students of Stanford Uni
versity, the.body which they are supposed to represent.
There is a great deal to be said supporting the Men's Council in any
stand they are likely to go on record as taking, this one not excepted.

EDITORIAL AND BUSINESS staffs will meet tomorrow at 1:30
o'clock. Quad picture, among other things.

In common with other disseminators of information, the staff of the
Daily Palo Alto likes to feel that its material attracts the attention of
somebody. While we cannot require attendance at our class nor conduct
examinations, the occasional viewpoint which recites opinion on our topics
gets the same hearty greeting from us that a professor might feel like giv
ing to a listener who is induced to attend a lecture for reasons having
nothing to do with the scholarship committee.
For some time the editorial column has announced opinions to an en
tirely complacent campus. Either our arguments have defied refutation
or they have not been worthy of more than a yawn. That is, we are either
being like a genius or an idiot. And we don't fancy ourselves in either role.
It is hereby formally announced that the editorial page is a bull-room
and we intend to have you figuratively reclining on the advertising with
your feet propped against the Cabbage column if we have to write forty
outrageous things like that which "D. L." disputes today.
"D. L." has the right idea. That editorial was shamefully one-sided,
which, however, is no reason for believing that one side all wrong. And
while he did better in that respect, there are certain subjects for discussion
suggested by his reply which somelxjdy ought to develop. Not that it
makes any difference now, of course, but it is an amusing topic for
speculation.
There is the Viewpoint column if you would kid the editor, or what
have you. There is Cabbages and Things if you care to be funny or any
thing else extraordinary. ,
If that isn't enough, start something!

CONSIDERABLE COMMENT has been stirred by the Men's
Council recommendation that Certain Student, whoever such an un
lucky man is, be required to take eighteen hours which have been selected
for him by his major department during as many quarters as may inter
vene between the present time and his graduation or his despair.
The case was one having to do somewhat with conduct and somewhat
more with the faculty feeling that the offender was not making a sincere
attempt to get the most out of Stanford, an opportunity which is being
furnished him by an outside agency. The recommendation called for
more serious action. The council's mercy is to be applauded. It is strictly
that agency's business —that part.
What is to be deplored is that any of his fellow-students should be
placed by circumstance in the embarrassing position of having to hand
down such an extraordinarily paternal decision to satisfy a policy not de
termined either by them or by the Associated Students of Stanford Uni
versity, the.body which they are supposed to represent.
There is a great deal to be said supporting the Men's Council in any
stand they are likely to go on record as taking, this one not excepted.

EDITORIAL AND BUSINESS staffs will meet tomorrow at 1:30
o'clock. Quad picture, among other things.
