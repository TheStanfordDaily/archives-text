Editor, the Daily Palo Alto,
Dear Sir:
If last night's editorial in the matter
of Ihe devil and his daughter was in
tended as a consoling hand-clasp to
the alleged "green peas," that's fine.
If it was a criticism of Rams Head
for rejecting plays called for in compe
tition, that (you'll pardon me) is silly.
It hardly seems necessary to point
out that it is a written or unwritten
condition of all literary prize contests
that "in case no manuscript is found
to be of a satisfactory quality, no prize
Khali be awarded." It rests with the

judges to accept one of the MSS. sub
mitted in competition, or reject the
lot. I happen to have seen the plots
submitted in the Rani's Head competi
tion, and, without wishing to hurt
anyone's feelings, I believe that Ram's
Head was right in its action.
No one would have been more
I depended upon to crash through with
something worth seeing. And even
your critic, I think, at least implies
that the cash customers got their
; money's worth. The "green peas," on
| the other hand, got lots of practice,
land most of them probably have
; pleased than Ram's Head had a real
{lalapaloosa been turned in, especially

by a freshman or sophomore. Good
writers are rare birds, and it is nice
to see new ones coming up. Since this
could not be, it was logical for the
society to turn to two men, members
of the society, who had proved their
ability to write plays, who could be
enough modesty and sense not to be
discouraged by one set-back.
The play must be considered beyond
the feelings of a few competitors. It is
a matter for regret that no satisfac
tory plays were submitted; but criti
cism of Ram's Head, apt as it may
often be, is here unjustified.
