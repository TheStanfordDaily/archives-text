HOW TO DO IT
Cabbages recommends the fol
lowing plan for the operation of
the dormitory dining halls on a
profit basis.
1. Reduce the price of admission
to 50c a day.
2. Never serve chicken. It is
very costly to cream only the
necks and throw the rest away.
3. Never make soup with the
dishwater. It is a waste of good
soap.
4. Handle the steaks more care
fully so as not to wear them out
so quickly.
5. Do not boil the dish-rags and
floor-mops in the coffee. It is ter
ribly hard on them. The tender
fabric is soon eaten away by the
caustic fluid. —M. D. E.

Advice to apple-polishers—
The practice of polishing apples is
an age-old custom and should there- i
fore be regarded with the greatest
reverence. It is one of our traditions. :
We here submit the latest and most j
improved methods of apple-polisliing
known to the civilized (or uncivilized) j
world:
Only the reddest and juciest New
town pippins are well adapted to pol
ishing. A silk cloth must always be
used. Cotton or muslin cloths leave
fine scratches on the surface. Shoe
polish or elbow grease are the most
frequently used polishers, but it has
been recently discovered that fish-oil
gives an exceptionally fine polish.
The apple is held firmly in the left
hand between the thumb and other
four fingers and the polishing cloth
is spread over the right hand. The
cloth is then brought against the apple
and moved with a vigorous rotation.
After an hour or so of vigorous polish
ing the apple should be quite bright
and shining.
Apples polished in this way should
always be coated with shellac to pre
serve the finish.
