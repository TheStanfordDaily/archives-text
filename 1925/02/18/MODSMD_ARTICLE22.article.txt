# LIBRARY BUYS SET OF ENGLISH MAGAZINES
## 
### 
Forty-one volumes of "The London
Magazine" or "Gentleman's Monthly
Intelligencer" has been bought by the
Stanford Library from a London
dealer. These volumes are a complete
set from 1732 to 1772 and give a very
good picture of life in England at that
time.
The magazine was in most respects
very much like the modern monthly
reviews. Among the subjects covered
by the numbers are: parliamentary de
bates, country sports, poetical essays,
and discussions of contemporary prob
lems and political issues.
