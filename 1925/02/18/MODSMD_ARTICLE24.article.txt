"The White Peacock" —New Columbia,
—San Francisco.
There is something about this Olga
Petrova which is quite marvelous —
she writes the play and then carries
down the house acting the leading
part. The plot was a clever adaptation
of a melodramatic theme, but we have
a sneaking idea that Petrova's playing
was pretty much responsible for its
success.
For that matter, we are quite sure
that she could give cards and spades
to most popular actresses and yet
bring off the honors with greatest
ease. And it is no end of relief to
watch a performance in which the
actress does not ruin the evening with
emotional contortions and pitiful at
tempts at expression which end only
in a devil of a lot of ugliness.
We could go on and say many nice
things about Petrova, but we will not.
We think that the little spiel just
before the last act was really uncon
scious humor, though we feel that it
was the audience whom we are to
curse most loudly. We thought it was
all right the first time we heard it at
"Hurricane" (which was very good),
but the second time of "I thank you
for your silence," was a little boring,
and we had a train to catch.
The play concerns itself with the
attempts of an individualistic woman
to rjd herself of her husband, a Span
ish Casanova and hard-boiled politi
cian. The entrance of Don Cesar,
played by Lewis Willoughby, who had
been sentenced falsely by Don Miguel,
the aforesaid husband, years before,
serves only to bring matters to a
higher pitch. But ifs all right, finally,
and a big boost for feminism.
There is another character in the
really well-balanced cast who took our
fancy. Joseph Granby, as Raphael
Rodriguez, "the bravest man in Spain,"
was very effective as the roistering
scoundrel. He put on one of the best
exhibitions of arm-waving inebriation
that we have seen off the stage or on.
It would be an education to aspiring
artists along this line to study his
methods. In our responsible capacity
we put our approval on this character
ization. —D. T. R.
