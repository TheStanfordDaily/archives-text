## It Can Happen in Golf 
### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
That "anything" can happen in golf," you will agree, when two objects as
small golf balls can meet in mid-air. At Mid-Surrey, in England, W. G. Grace
and G. W. Beldam played their iron shots simultaneously. The balls met high
in the air and rebounded towards the players.
Jerry Travers in the semi-final round of a Metropolitan championship same
upon a curious incident which once more bore out the statement that "anything
can happen In golf." The baffling episode that arose at the seventeenth hole
checked Travers' triumphant march to a new course record, for when Jerry
reached his ball he found it reposing inside a large milk bottle.
"There should be a law keeping large milk bottles from cavorting on the
fairway," thought Mr. Travers, as he-smashed the bottle and freed the ball.
Golf balls that live in glass houses don't break course records, however, so no
new low score was set that day for the Fox Hills course.
It doesn't sound possible when you say that an eminent Scotch professional
once took eighteen strokes on a par 3 hole in the United States Open cham
puionship, but such a thing actually happened. In the 1919 tournament Willie
Chisholm's tee shot rested on a rock and he had to whack at the ball eight
times before it even wiggled.
