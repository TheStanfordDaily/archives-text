# Wranglers Will Postpone Meeting Until Next Week
## 
### 
Wranglers' Society will not meet
this week. Most of its members have
rather heavy social programs for the
week, and therefore have decided not
to meet.
Next week, if word is received from
Mrs. Whitaker, who is in charge of
the matter, Wranglers' Society will
have more material on the League of
Women Voters. Outlines of different
kinds of meetings will be used in
guiding the club.
Although the organization may not
become a part of the League, it will
probably take on a good many of the
forms and discuss many of the inter
i ests of the latter.

The University of Colorado recently
had a beauty contest.
