## 
### 
| Hammer and Coffin will celebrate
I two anniversaries on the seventeenth
j of April, the nineteenth anniversary of
J the earthquake and its own nineteenth
! anniversary.. The Fifth National An
j nual Convention of Hammer and Cof
fin Society will be held here on that
date.
The cerebration will be one of the
j biggest in Chappie's history, the Old
Hoy claims. Alumni from all over the
United States will attend. Mike Ely is
in charge of the arrangements.
The big time is to be held the night
before the track meet with California
and it is expected that the proceed
ings will take on an especially rosy
hue. San Francisco alumni are active
in the plans for the convention; so it
is expected that the attention of the
delegates will be divided between the
campus and San Francisco.
In order to make things really worth
while, arrangements may be made
with the Board of Athletic Control to ,
have another earthquake.
