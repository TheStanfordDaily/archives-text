# Searsville Overflowing As Heavy Rains Continue
## 
### 
With twenty-four feet of water in its
deepest part Searsville Lake is overflow
ing at the dam. The fire hydrants of the
university near the arboretum have been
opened to relieve the pressure and the
trees will now be given the needed soak
ing that they have not had for three years.
Over three more inches of rain has
fallen to date than fell up to this time last
year, and water for Lagunita is now as
sured.
