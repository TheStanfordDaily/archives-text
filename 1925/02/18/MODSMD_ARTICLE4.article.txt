# EROSION CYCLES HAVE FORMED CANYON SAYS DAVIS
## Orderly Development Seen in Earth's Origin Like Man's Progress 
### 
The value of the Colorado canyon as
a clear example of the earth's struc
ture, as a cue to the earth's enormous
age, and as an example of the orderly
development that is found also in the
similar development of man, was
pointed out by Dr. William Morris
Davis in his illustrated lecture on the
; Grand Canyon last night.
Dr. Davis first considered the possi
bility of the Grand Canyon's having
j been formed by the rapid stroke of an
earthquake, and pointed out how its
I great width at the top, as well as
j other facts of its structure disproved
j t his theory.
"Those who still cling to a theory of
rapid formation might suggest that
after the chasm appeared, the cut was
widened by the erosion of water. Why
not look to erosion as the whole ex
planation of this canyon?" he sug-
J gested.
Process Take® Time
| After pointing out the features of
the canyon which have made this
; theory generally accepted as true, Dr.
' Davis remarked on the observation
i usually made that this process must
have taken an enormous length of
time.
"This process is comparatively re
cent when we consider the time taken
to build up the plateau and bring it to
: its form before the canyon was cut,"
; he continued.
He then emphasied the fact that the
! development of the plateau has been
| through a series of cycles of erosion,
! by which material has been laid down
| and then worn away by the river into
its present form. "The inconceivable
I time which has elapsed in the build
j ing up of the plateau which the canyon
i cuts, the time it has taken for the ero
j sion to proceed as far as it has, and
i the time it would take for all of that
j plateau to be finally worn away and
! carried to the sea, forms the greatest
of the cycles of erosion," he explained.
Divisions in Structure
Looking at the structure of the can
' yon's walls as an index to the forma
tion of the plateau, Dr. Davis pointed
out three divisions in structure: a
crystalline foundation, a wedge-like
division, and the horiontal layers
above. "There was at one time 11,000'
j feet of strata above the foundation,"
he remarked.
"Seven cycles of erosion are in
volved in the building of the strata and
of the escarpments visible in the
north," he declared. "Coincident with
these cycles have been different ages
of life. Man developed like the wear
ing away of the plateau to form the
canyon. In the development of branch
canyons even now going on, I see a
resemblance to the research pushed
forward by men here and there which
will result in further improvements of
mankind for minerals have the same
properties now as then.
"The laws of Physics, Chemistry,
and Mineralogy were the same as they
are now, but the evolution of life goes
on, changing from day to day for the
aau uoiiniOAa jo sapAa aq) se
completed."

I time which has elapsed in the build
j ing up of the plateau which the canyon
i cuts, the time it has taken for the ero
j sion to proceed as far as it has, and
i the time it would take for all of that
j plateau to be finally worn away and
! carried to the sea, forms the greatest
of the cycles of erosion," he explained.
Divisions in Structure
Looking at the structure of the can
' yon's walls as an index to the forma
tion of the plateau, Dr. Davis pointed
out three divisions in structure: a
crystalline foundation, a wedge-like
division, and the horiontal layers
above. "There was at one time 11,000'
j feet of strata above the foundation,"
he remarked.
"Seven cycles of erosion are in
volved in the building of the strata and
of the escarpments visible in the
north," he declared. "Coincident with
these cycles have been different ages
of life. Man developed like the wear
ing away of the plateau to form the
canyon. In the development of branch
canyons even now going on, I see a
resemblance to the research pushed
forward by men here and there which
will result in further improvements of
mankind for minerals have the same
properties now as then.
"The laws of Physics, Chemistry,
and Mineralogy were the same as they
are now, but the evolution of life goes
on, changing from day to day for the

The value of the Colorado canyon as
a clear example of the earth's struc
ture, as a cue to the earth's enormous
age, and as an example of the orderly
development that is found also in the
similar development of man, was
pointed out by Dr. William Morris
Davis in his illustrated lecture on the
; Grand Canyon last night.
Dr. Davis first considered the possi
bility of the Grand Canyon's having
j been formed by the rapid stroke of an
earthquake, and pointed out how its
I great width at the top, as well as
j other facts of its structure disproved
j t his theory.
"Those who still cling to a theory of
rapid formation might suggest that
after the chasm appeared, the cut was
widened by the erosion of water. Why
not look to erosion as the whole ex
planation of this canyon?" he sug-
J gested.
Process Take® Time
| After pointing out the features of
the canyon which have made this
; theory generally accepted as true, Dr.
' Davis remarked on the observation
i usually made that this process must
have taken an enormous length of
time.
"This process is comparatively re
cent when we consider the time taken
to build up the plateau and bring it to
: its form before the canyon was cut,"
; he continued.
He then emphasied the fact that the
! development of the plateau has been
| through a series of cycles of erosion,
! by which material has been laid down
| and then worn away by the river into
its present form. "The inconceivable
I time which has elapsed in the build
j ing up of the plateau which the canyon
i cuts, the time it has taken for the ero
j sion to proceed as far as it has, and
