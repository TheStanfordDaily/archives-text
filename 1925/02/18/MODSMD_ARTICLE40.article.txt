# WOMEN TO HOLD DEBATE TRYOUTS
## 
### 
A meeting of those interested in
forming a women's debating squad to
meet California was held last evening
in the Women's Clubhouse. The ques
tion selected for the tryouts which are
to be held Tuesday, March 3, is: "Re
solved, That the school of thought
typified by Mencken is a harmful ele
ment in American Life." It is possible
that this question may be used in the
Intercollegiate debate.
Barbara Mayer was elected debate
manager, and will arrange plans with
California for a debate to be hehl in
Wheeler hall between April 7 and 15.
California will submit a list of judges,
from which the Stanford debaters will
choose three.
Madeline Lackman, California repre
sentative, was at the meeting last
night to make important arrangements
for the debate. Miss Lackman is a
member of the California varsity team,
representative debating council, and
member of the Parliamentary Debat
ing Society.
It is urged that all women interested
will try out for debating, since former
attempts to establish a women's var
sity team have not received the proper
support. The time and place for the
tryouts will be anounced later.
