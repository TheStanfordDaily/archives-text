# NOTED SONG WRITER TELLS OF MUSIC THIS EVENING
## Composer of "K-K-K-Katy" Noted for His Humor; Will Play Songs 
### Herbert Klein 
"How Music Is Made" will be the
1 subject of Geoffrey O'Hara's lecture
in the Assembly Hall tonight at 7:30
o'clock. He speaks under the auspices
of the Glee Club.
O'Hara is well qualified to talk upon
the theme on account of his experience
as a composer. He has written many
well-known songs, including "K-K-K-
Katie." This humorous number was a
product of his experience as a camp
song leader during the war.
Other phases of music besides its
composition will be discussed. The
place of music in the life of the com
munity and the home will be shown.
In explaining the process of composi
tion O'Hara will trace the steps by
which a simple theme of a few notes
is amplified into a composition. He
is also recognized as an entertainer
and humorist. He will play a number
of selections on the piano to illustrate
his subject and will sing some of his
own songs.
He has wiitten a number in the
French-Canadian patois, including
"The Wreck of the Julia Plant" and
"Little Bateese." After the war his
"The Unknown Soldier" and "There Is
No Death" appeared. "Give a Man a
Horse He Can Ride" is his composi
tion.
O'Hara has done research work in
conection with the preservation and
recording of the native Indian music
and was engaged in this when he was
called to have his musical knowledge
made use of as a leader of group sing
ing in army camps.
