### 
Sigma Alpha Epsilon and El Toro
won their games yesterday in the in
tramural semi-finals and will play the
final game for the championship next
week. S. A. E. defeated the fast
Japanese Club, winners in League 4,
out of the running by winning 22 to 12.
Although playing up to their usual
form, the Japanese Club lost to the
S. A. E. team which played a steady
rushing game taking many shots at
the basket and making accurate goals.
Before the S. A. E. squad had tight
ened up on their defense the club suc
ceeded in making two goals when
Kitow made a basket from the middle
of the court and Sano sent the ball
into the hoop on a backhand throw.
At the end of the half the score
stood 9 to 4.
Plenty of fast action and accurate
shooting featured the second period
as both teams opened up. Murata and
Kitow of the Japanese Club scored on
long shots while Gibbons and McDer
mont scored three times from follow
up shots. The game was played with
very few fouls being called on either
team.
El Toro outplayed the Encina IE
team throughout the entire and
the outcome was never in doubt. By
clever floorwork the freshmen were
able to take many throws, but they
seemed unable to make them count, j
The club took an early lead in the !
first half as Rupe, Wright, and Arthur
all scored. Ludeke played a stellar i
game at standing guard and always j
took the ball off the backboard and
got rid of it. The score at the half
was 13 to 4 in favor of El Toro.
