# 1928 NINE DEFEATS SAN MATEO EASILY BY 6 TO 3 SCORE
## 
### 
Stanford's freshman baseball squad j
easily defeated San Mateo high school
in a slow seven-inning game yesterday j
by a 6 to 3 score. The yearlings outhit
their opponents and were never in
danger of losing the advantage.
Sobieski started on the mound for
Hunt's men and pitched excellent ball !
in the three innings in which he ,
worked, striking out four batters and |
allowing three hits. Pliilippi relieved j
Jiim at the beginning of the fourth '
inning and blanked the, high school
during the remainer of the contest, 1
fanning seven men.
The freshmen got going early, find
ing Tassi, San Mateo hurler, for four
runs in their first time at bat. Adams
drew a walk and stole second. Gari
baldi, the next man up, was hit by a
pitched ball. Maguire singled, scoring
Adams, and Sypher pounded out a
two-bagger, bringing in Garibaldi. Ma
guire was thrown out at the plate. Nis
sen was safe at first on an error, and
Sypher scored. Nissen stole second
and third in rapid succession and came
home on Price's long fly to deep left.
Sims ended the inning by grounding
out t'o short.
Sypher Goes Well
Sypher played another nice game be
hind the plate, and -pounded out two
hits in three times at bat. Weaver
played the entire game in center field \
and gave a good account of himself.
Hunt used Maguire at first instead of
in his usual position in center. Maguire
showed his unfamiliarity with the in
field job by making a few ragged plays,
but did well on the whole. Busch re- 1
placed Adams at second during the j
last two innings.
Price was stationed at third in place
of Snyde. The team as a unit worked j
better than in its other two games, |
made fewer errors, and showed greater
co-ordination. Hunt made several j
changes in his line-up and uncovered I
an abundance of reserve strength.
