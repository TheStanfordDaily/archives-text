# ENGLISH CLUB TO PRESENT MACBETH ON MARCH 6 AND 7
## 
### Wilbur Adams 
The talents of the whole dramatic
department of the University are being
combined toward the end of making
the first Shakespearean production to
be produced at Stanford in a decade a
i great success. With the unlimited pos
i sibilities presented in all departments,
; the designers, the actors, the lighting
director, the business manager, and
the director have combined interests.
Such a combination of talents and pur
pose seems to predict a splendid suc
cess for the production of "Macbeth"
on March 6 in the Assembly hall.
Two performances will be given: the
Friday night show, followed by the
j cast dance, and a matinee performance
given for the people of the peninsula
i in response to the great number of re
' quests that have come in to Gordon
Davis from the various high schools
in the vicinity. It is hoped by present
ing the show on two occasions, that
the seats will be better for the patrons
! of both performances.
The New York critics gave very fa
! vorable comment on the James K.
I-lackett version of the playâ€”an acting
J version which makes it possible to
i preserve the high tempo of the per
| formance. This revision was played in
: New York and in Europe by Hackett
and met with the favor of audiences
and critics of both continents.
