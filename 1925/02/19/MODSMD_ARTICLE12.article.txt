## 
### Dudley Ross 
In his talk, "Our Attitude Towards Athletics," delivered from radio station
KPO last night, Harry Maloney advocated the spending of money to encourage
participation in sports rather than to watch picked teams play.
"It is estimated," he said, "that here in America *ve spend annually over a
billion dollars on sport. Still, when we come to analyze this huge outgo of
money, we find that although America leads the world from the standpoint of
having acquired most of the world's athletic championships the greatest portion

of this hume sum is spent in watching<S
other people at play. In other words,
we realize that we are of the game
but not in the game.
"We can readily sec," Maloney con
tinued, "that were we to encourage a
system of general participation in ath
letics in our institutions throughout
the country, the health of the average
man would not only be better but we
would change our entire attitude to
ward sports in general.
"By being on the field rather than

on the side-lines we would learn to
appreciate sport more. Being a partici
pant we would cultivate not only a
| keenness for the sport itself, but a
! keener desire for sport for its own
I sake. This is something that is too
often lost sight of here in America."
Maloney's address is the second of a
series of talks to be given over Radio
KPO by members of the Stanford De
partment of Athletics.
