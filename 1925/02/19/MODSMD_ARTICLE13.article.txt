## 
### 
Additions to the Lagunita boathouse
fleet are being made daily and it is
expected that all the berths and lock
ers will be taken before the end of
the week. With the lake nearly full,
the canoes in their bright war paint
tan now be launched directly from the
platform.
Red seems to be the favorite color
of the canoes with blue running a
close second. Of the fourteen canoes
six are painted cardinal, two blue, and
others are colored green, gid| r , and
white. A birch canoe and a cross-word
puzzle canoe are the feature ships of
the squadron.
With the coming of wanner weather,
it is expected that all of the boathouse
fleet will soon be on the water. ■
