# OPEN FORUM CLEARS UP QUESTION OF BRANNER EATING RULE SITUATION
## TOYON CLUBS TO REMAIN Roth Claims That Regulation Is Work of Students, Not Faculty 
### Aurelio Espinosa, Jr 
At the open forum held last evening
on the dormitory eating situation,
Comptroller A. E. Roth, the principal
speaker of the evening, explained the
situation by showing exactly what the
University proposes to do with the
Branner eating hall, thus clearing up
the misapprehension that has arisen
about the regulation.
"The eating clubs will continue to
eat where they are until the Univer
sity can build more eating halls in
back of Toyon. The recent regulation,
suggested by the student boards at
the Union and at Branner hall, and not
by the University authorities, deals
solely with Branner hall where the
dining hall has been run at a loss
during the last year, because of the
interfactional quarrels that the free
lances now at Branner hall have been
carrying on.
"A little co-operation among the
members would settle the situation,
but since this is not forthcoming, a
new system will be tried out next
quarter. Should this scheme not suc
ceed, the dining halls will be closed
up. The system that will go into effect
next quarter is that all those appli
cants for admission into Branner who
wish to eat there will be given prefer
ence over those who wish to live but
not to eat at the Branner dining halls."
The forum expressed approval at
having all freshmen eat at the Encina
dining halls, but a small majority were
in favor of the proposition that prefer
ence be given to those who wished to
eat as well as to live in Branner hall.
The question of the evening, as to
whether the University could adopt a
policy that tended toward compulsion
in any matter whatsoever was not
discussed, since Roth maintained that
the problem was not being settled by
compulsion.
The next open forum will be held
on March 11 instead of on March 4
as was previously announced. The
postponement is due to conflict with
the Euphronia league debate that will
be held in the Little Theatre on March
4. The question will be the fraternity
sorority question. It is planned to have
representatives from the Interfrater
nity Council, and from the Inter-Hall
Board speak. At the same meeting, the
question of the continuance of these
forums will be put'up to the audience.

next quarter is that all those appli
cants for admission into Branner who
wish to eat there will be given prefer
ence over those who wish to live but
not to eat at the Branner dining halls."
The forum expressed approval at
having all freshmen eat at the Encina
dining halls, but a small majority were
in favor of the proposition that prefer
ence be given to those who wished to
eat as well as to live in Branner hall.
The question of the evening, as to
whether the University could adopt a
policy that tended toward compulsion
in any matter whatsoever was not
discussed, since Roth maintained that
the problem was not being settled by
compulsion.
The next open forum will be held
on March 11 instead of on March 4
as was previously announced. The
postponement is due to conflict with
the Euphronia league debate that will
be held in the Little Theatre on March
4. The question will be the fraternity
sorority question. It is planned to have
representatives from the Interfrater
nity Council, and from the Inter-Hall
Board speak. At the same meeting, the
question of the continuance of these
forums will be put'up to the audience.
