# BEARS EXPECT TO TAKE YEARLING COURT TILT
## Intensive Work Given Bruin Freshmen Since First Game of Series 
### Jerry Levin 
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA,
Feb. 19. â€”Although defeated by the
Cardinals in the first game of their
annual series, the California freshman
bahketball team is confident that it
will take the second game from the
1 Card babes at Palo Alto, Friday night.
Johnny Talt, freshman cage mentor,
has been perfecting the play of tfee
freshman team during the past week
and has them in much better condition
than they were in the first game. Their
shooting and pass-work has greatly
! improved and they no doubt will show
I better form against the Stanford
quintet this week. Captain Peterson,
Bruin freshman center, is again put
i ting the ball in the basket with regu
larity and is expected to make good
a great many more points than he did
j in the first game. Walton and Hurff,
j the Bruin forwards, and Bradley and
i Beckwith, guards, are playing well to
gether and show great improvement
I in offensive and defensive work. Brad
ley is working in nicely at the place
left vacantly the ineligibility of Doug
i ery.
Coach Talt will probably use these
' five men against Coach "Husky"
I Hunt's Cardinals, but he has plenty
of good reserve material and may use
more of these ifien than he did in the
first contest.
Should Stanford win this game they
will claim the annual series, but if the
Bears win, a third game will be played
i to decide the victor.
