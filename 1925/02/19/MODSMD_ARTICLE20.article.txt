Athletic relations with the University of Southern California have
been resumed. Harold J. Stonier, executive secretary to President von
Kleinsmid of Southern California, has proved to the satisfaction of Pro
fessor E. A. Cottrell, who represented President Wilbur, and Dean of
Men J. H. Hildebrand, who represented California students, that the
athletic policy of U. S. C.is compatible with that of the two northern
colleges.
Since Professor Cottrell was representing Stanford, the student-body
may be sure that the policies from the Farm received the proper consid
eration.
U. S. C. has gone far toward eliminating future misunderstanding by
reorganizing its personnel. Those in control of the southern university
have made a sincere effort to remedy the difficulty. It is quite proper for
Stanford and California to accept such evidence in good faith.
The break is patched and an embarrassment ended. Presently the
misunderstanding will be forgitten, we hope.
To students registering from the South, the unpleasantness over the
break has been the most noticeable. About sixty per cent of those en
rolled in Stanford come from the Los Angeles vicinity. And since last
fall that sixty per cent has had to stand off a spirited attack in the old
home town.
These people will welcome the resumation of relations. Now they
may again feel at ease with the friends who chose to attend U. S. C.
Now both sides may laugh at the everpresent yawper who is forever
inquiring, "What's the matter with you high-hats that you won't play
ball?" and who thereupon seeks out one of the other side to demand, "A
swell bunch of guyÂ£ you are, when decent people won't play with you.
What's the matter ?"
This sort of unjustified comment has caused most of the ill-feeling.
Now that things are all set right again, both sides may join to sock
the yawpers on their respective noses.
To the students of the three universities, who perhaps understood less
about the reasons for the break than anybody else, will be left the pleasant
duty of being friendly again. That suits us fine. We write to Joe and
Bill tonight to arrange one of the pre-war Jjeach parties for next vacation
time.
