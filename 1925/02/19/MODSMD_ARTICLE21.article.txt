# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT

Editor, Daily Palo Alto:
For the benefit of those who have
spent their "off" hours for the past
few weeks, in scurrilous discuaion of
the proposed method for handling the
campus dining halls by University ad
ministration, this Viewpoint is enthu
siastically submitted.
Stepping into the Union Cigar Store
for a moment, during the Open Forum
discussion in the lobby of the Old
Union, I came upon a group of spell
bound listeners who, with a satanic
gleam in every eye, stood in crescent
formation about their corpulent leader
who was airing his latest "Viewpoint"
in this manner:
"I don't know what he is going to
tell them, and I don't care. (Obviously
the speaker referred to Mr. Roth, who
was talking to a group of twenty-five,
or less, in the room just above). What
ever he says, won't make a bit of
difference, anyway."
But I wish to here assure that per
son and his little audience, together
with any others who were making simi
lar statements between shows at the
Varsity or Stanford theatres, that what
was said in Euplironia's Open Forum
last night will make a difference in
the minds of those present, and will
send every one of those who were
interested enough in the matter to at
tend that meeting, home as a potential
advocate of the University's action in
the problem at hand.
The noisy speaker who talked in the
Cigar Store would not listen to the
reason and explanation that was being
given, not fifty feet away. He preferred
to retain his uninformed opinion by
avoiding the contaminating influence
of a. satisfactory explanation. Russia is
full of his sort, and suffering the con
sequences right now.
Being only a Class of '27 man, there
is some excuse for his undeveloped
method of getting at the bottom of
debatable questions of student inter

! est, but this does not excuse the cord
| clad audience who listened to his
! childish raving with bated breath.
He who only hears a part, hears
nothing. —R. E. C., '26.

Firemen were unable to put out a
fire in the business district of Mon
treal, Canada, recently, because the
weather was so cold that the water
i froze almost as soon as it emerged
from the fire hoses. The buildings
1 were coated with ice but the fire de
| stroyed two blocks before it could be
' checked.

Editor, Daily Palo Alto:
For the benefit of those who have
spent their "off" hours for the past
few weeks, in scurrilous discuaion of
the proposed method for handling the
campus dining halls by University ad
ministration, this Viewpoint is enthu
siastically submitted.
Stepping into the Union Cigar Store
for a moment, during the Open Forum
discussion in the lobby of the Old
Union, I came upon a group of spell
bound listeners who, with a satanic
gleam in every eye, stood in crescent
formation about their corpulent leader
who was airing his latest "Viewpoint"
in this manner:
"I don't know what he is going to
tell them, and I don't care. (Obviously
the speaker referred to Mr. Roth, who
was talking to a group of twenty-five,
or less, in the room just above). What
ever he says, won't make a bit of
difference, anyway."
But I wish to here assure that per
son and his little audience, together
with any others who were making simi
lar statements between shows at the
Varsity or Stanford theatres, that what
was said in Euplironia's Open Forum
last night will make a difference in
the minds of those present, and will
send every one of those who were
interested enough in the matter to at
tend that meeting, home as a potential
advocate of the University's action in
the problem at hand.
The noisy speaker who talked in the
Cigar Store would not listen to the
reason and explanation that was being
given, not fifty feet away. He preferred
to retain his uninformed opinion by
avoiding the contaminating influence
of a. satisfactory explanation. Russia is
full of his sort, and suffering the con
sequences right now.
Being only a Class of '27 man, there
is some excuse for his undeveloped
method of getting at the bottom of
debatable questions of student inter

! est, but this does not excuse the cord
| clad audience who listened to his
! childish raving with bated breath.
He who only hears a part, hears
nothing. —R. E. C., '26.

Firemen were unable to put out a
fire in the business district of Mon
treal, Canada, recently, because the
weather was so cold that the water
i froze almost as soon as it emerged
from the fire hoses. The buildings
1 were coated with ice but the fire de
| stroyed two blocks before it could be
' checked.
