; People? "One can do without them,
j but it is pleasant sometimes to sur- j
i prise a man with one's own unlikeness
j to him, to show one's dicerence from
1 1 him."

j Less of the above atitude and more ;
iof the one which investigates and — j
j tests—would result in a much more
; interesting view of life.
Once there was a professor who
taught art. He believed that anything
contemporary was scarcely worth ob
serving, because one could not judge
it yet.
There are students on this campus
worth knowing—but—their contempor- 1
aries aren't far enough from them — j
yet—ercept the near-sighted ones of
us.
There are better places than Stan
ford in which to learn salesmanship,
and typing, and blacksmithing, but
there are few places where, in four
years, one may obtain so intensive a
study of human nature.
The study is here —the "laboratory"
and all the "tools." To what extent one
is capable of using them—and to what
use the "tools" are put—depends en
tirely upon the man.
The danger is not so much in a stu
dent not recognizing the biggest oppor
tunity college ocers —as it is in the
recognition, but blundering misuse, of j
the privilege.
All of which means —what Kipling
discovered —that "an order is an order
till one is strong enough to disobey."
