## 
### 
An exhibition from the California i
Water Color Society, consisting of 49
water colors and 2 pastels, will be
the center of interest at the Stanford
Art Gallery, beginning today and con
tinuing until March 15.
The water colors were selected from
pictures submitted by members of the
society. They have all been painted
within the last year, as the selection
for exhibition is made annually by the
society. Last year's exhibit was also
shown at the Stanford Art Gallery.
Carlos Oscar Borg has contributed a [
number of water colors on Indian sub
jects. "Splendors of the West" is one
of the few pictures on exhibition done :
in the tempera, not the transparent :
water color medium. "The Cripple" j
and "The Hopi Shrine" are others of ;
liis pictures.
Two decorative water colors are the j
work of a Russian, V. Ulianoff. The
titles suggest their colorfulness:
"Flaming of Revolution" and "In the
Land of Dreams."
Rowena Meeks Abdy, a San Fran
cisco woman, has on exhibition "On
the Slopes of Twin Peaks," "Fishing
Village, Gibraltar," and "Clearing !
Weather."
A Chinese subject has been treated
by A. C. Wells in "Needle Pagoda," a
scene of Hangchow. Two paintings of
Eucalyptus trees, by Mildred S. Pierce |
and Georgina Roberts, form an inter- I
esting contrast.
"Breakers," by Birger sandzen, rep- J
resents the modern trend more deci-1
dedly than the other pictures. Georgina i
Roberts also paints with few brush
strokes, especially in her "Going to j
Early Mass," W. C. Watts has con- i
tributed "Sunset Glow, Mount Shasta" j
and "Evening Tide," Point Lobos.
Charles A. Smith is exhibiting a
scene of Monterey Bay. A large por- j
trait in transparent water colors by j
Donna Schuster is called "Marigold." I

tic standing. The member of a varsity
