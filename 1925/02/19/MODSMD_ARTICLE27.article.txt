# UNIVERSITY AVENUE RESIDENTS ASK FOR REMOVAL OF TRACKS
## 
### 
Since tlie recent decision handed to
the Palo Alto city authorities that the
electric cars service will be suspended
a petition has been drawn by the resi
dents of University avenue between
Waverley and Middlefield road provid
ing for the immediate removal of the
street car rails and a widening of the
pavement by 10 feet 10 inches, together
with the installation of an under
: ground electrical system and electro
liers for the lighting of that part of
the avenue.
Work on the electrical system is
already under way in the downtown
j district where the unsightly poles are
being replaced by underground con
jduits. A recent count of the traffic on
, University avenue shows that the
, widening of the street between Waver
| ley and the Middlefield road is justi
j fled, inasmuch as a decided change in
the business center has occurred dur-
I
ing the past year. The middle of the
business district is moving away from
the Circle toward the Palo Alto Bank
Building corner, giving evidence of
still greater advances in that direction
I in the future.
