# Art Work for Chaparral Faculty Number Due Today
## 
### 
Art Work for the Faculty Number
of Chappie must be in the office, not
the mail box, by tonight. All literary
contributions should be handed in be
fore Tuesday. The Faculty Number
will appear somewhere around March
first.
The material for this issue is all to
be contributed by members of the fac
ulty, a great deal of it probably being
taken from old English 2 composi
tions. Something new and original in
the way of humor is expected.
The Old Boy will appear this time
With a very striking three-color cover
by Pedro Lemos, a nationally known
artist.
The Chaparral-Widow number will
appear a month later.
