# DRIVERLESS MACHINE CAUSE OF PANIC ON PALO ALTO STREETS
## 
### 
An excited feminine voice poured a
torrent of words over the telephone
in the Palo Alto police station yester
day morning. "There's a car running
wild down Emerson street and nobody
is driving it. Come quick and stop it
before it kills someone."
Dashing into the street, the desk
sergeant saw an apparently driverless
car disappear around the corner of
Ramona street. Putting forth a burst
of speed, the intrepid officer set out
in pursuit.
But his efforts were in vain, for as
he rounded the corner of University
he saw the car parked in front
of a theatre, where the manager was
on his knees giving instructions to
the concealed driver.

It was merely a publicity stunt ad
vertising the evening's performance.
