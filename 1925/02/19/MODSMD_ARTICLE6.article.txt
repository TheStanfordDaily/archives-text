# METHODS OF COMPOSING MUSIC ILLUSTRATED IN LECTURE LAST EVENING
## CRITICIZES MODERNISTS No Trouble to Find Themes Declares Song Writer; New Ballad Played

"Composing music is not so hard as
it seems. Anyone can do it," said
Geoffrey O'Hara, speaking in the As
sembly hall last night on "How Music
Is Made." Calling for any three con
secutive notes from the audience, he
proceeded to take those proposed and
to improvise a waltz from them. The
Bame three notes served also for a
march. O'Hara intimated that almost
any kind of a musical composition
could be built from there.
"Repetition is the very backbone of
music/' he stated. "It is found in music
of all sorts, the only exception being
the formless and tuneless so-called
'modern music.'
"Rhythm is another element in music
that is of greatest importance. The
trouble and danger of jazz is that it
overdoes the montonous, tom-tom-like
percussion and keeps the same time
pounding all through a piece. Rag
time, on the other hand, is. simply a
fetching form of the principle of synco
pation, known and used by all the old
masters. The second movement of
Beethoven's 'Moonlight Sonata' is a
perfect instance of the use of the mis
placed accent, or syncopation."
Many of the modern popular num
bers credited with being ragtime are
nothing of the sort, according to
O'Hara. Irving Berlin, commonly
known as the master of ragtime, really
uses almost none of it.
O'Hara showed how the works of the
old masters were being combed by
composers of jazz and their themes
being "cribbed" for use in the latest
hits. "What is not so generally known,
however, is that popular tunes can be
made into classics by a sort of re
verse process," he said. This state
ment was illustrated by sublimations
of such tunes as "Poor Butterfly" and
"The Arkansaw Traveler," which was
made into a brilliant concert number
by the American pianist, John Powell.
O'Hara sang a number of songs to
his own accompaniment. Those of his
own composition were "Little Bateese,"
"Give a Man a Horse He Can Ride,"
and a ballad. "Out of the West," which
was sung by Charles Stratton.
