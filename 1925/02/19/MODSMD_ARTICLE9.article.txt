# STANFORD, CALIFORNIA REACH SETTLEMENT WITH TROJANS
## Southern California Assumes New Policy of Athletic Control By Student Body and Faculty 
### 
University of Southern California has finally patched up its difficul
ties with Stanford and California and athletic relations have been resumed.
It is possible that Stanford will meet U. S. C. in track this spring and
football next fall.
The Trojans have now adopted a policy of student control of athletics
similar to that being used by both the northern institutions, wherein stu
dents have representation. Control of scholastic requirements and enforce
ment of eligibility rules are in the hands of faculty representatives.
Negotiations for resuming athletic relations were started last fall by
U. S. C. and were finally closed last night when a conference composed
of Professor E. A. Cottrell of Stanford, Joel Hildebrand ,dean of men at
California, and Harold Stonier, executive secretary to President Von
Kleinsmid of U .S. C. reached a final decision. The adoption of the new
athletic policies at University of Southern California was a great factor in
reaching the final settlement.
The Three-Party agreement adopted when U. S. C. first entered the
conference still stands. Under the "Break" the Trojans still remained a
party to the agreement and now with the settlement of the difficulties the
old compact is further strengthened.

California has announced that it will be impossible to slate any contests
— <S>with the Trojans this spring or next

fall because of full schedules. Never
theless, it is entirely possible that the
freshman football teams of the two
institutions will meet next fall.
After football schedules are over
next year the three universities will
schedule games in all branches of
sports. A complete resumption of rela
tions in all departments will then be
effected.
Paul Davis, general manager, is at
present in Los Angeles and will no
doubt arrange dates for the proposed
contests before his return to the Farm.
