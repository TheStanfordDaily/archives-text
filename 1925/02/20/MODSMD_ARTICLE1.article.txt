# STANFORD TEAM OPPOSES M. J. B. NINE TOMORROW
## Oviatt or Collins Slated to Pitch; Coffee Kids Open Season 
### 
Stanford's varsity baseball team will
meet the M. J. B. Coffee Kids of San
Francisco tomorrow at 2:30 on the
varsity diamond. This will be the
fourth game of the season for the
Cards, as the rainy weather of the past
two weeks has forced the cancellation
of three dates from the schedule.
The M. J. B. outfit has not played
a game this season, but their strength
can be estimated by the lineup. The
Coffee Kids have several major league
recruits and other players of consider
able reputation on the team and will
probably furnish stiff opposition for
the Stanford men.
Steengrase is the big star of the
visiting team. He is a pitcher who has
built up a good record on the coast
and who is going to the Chicago White
Sox in the spring. He is expected to
l>e a hard man for the Cards to hit.
Conolley, third baseman, is another
big league recruit and will be sent to
Boston next year. Mellana, a 17-year
old star playing at shortstop, will leave
soon for the St. Louis training camp.
The heavy-hitter of the team is Lee
Ryan, first-baseman, who led the Ala
meda League in*batting last year.
The Coffee Kids, like Cliff Ireland's
team, will bring with them a comedian
of the diamond, "Sea Cap" Christen
sen, who will amuse the crowd from
right field. His favorite trick is turning
a hand-spring before he catches a fly.
In the three games played so far
by the Stanford men, not a win has
been recorded. Ireland's Independents
won the annual series with two
straight victories, the first by a 7 to 5
score and the second by a 5 to 0
whitewash. The Kenealy Seals took
the third game from the Cards.
Coach Harry Wolter will have but
two pitchers to use in tomorrow's
game. Oviatt and Collins, two right
banders, are the men who will do the
mound work for Stanford. Milt Teague,
who played last year, has quit practice,
and Jim Aydelotte, a left-handed pitch
er, is now in winter training with the
j San Francisco Seals. Wolter has not
! yet decided whether he will start
| Oviatt or Collins tomorrow, but it is
! probable that regardless of the order
! in which they go into the game, both
! will see service.
As for the rest of the lineup, it will
i be the same as was used against the
j Kenealy Seals. Solomon, who pitched
last year, but who has been changed
| to the catching job recently, will be
behind the bat.
Captain Chuck Johnston at first,
Roberts at second, Mulchay at short,
and Cuddeback at third will make up
the infield with Stewart, McCandless,
and Brown in the outfield.
The M. J. B. lineup will include:
Ross, catcher; Steengrase, pitcher;
,Ryan, first base; H. Christensen, sec
ond base; Mellana, shortstop; Conol
ley, third base; and Back, Christensen,
and Hawk in the outfield.

A sophomore student at Syracuse
j University died as the result of a
! blow received during a practice boxing
: match in the gymnasium recently. It
j was said that the tragedy would prob
! ably result in discontinuance of boxing

by the Stanford men, not a win has
been recorded. Ireland's Independents
won the annual series with two
straight victories, the first by a 7 to 5
score and the second by a 5 to 0
whitewash. The Kenealy Seals took
the third game from the Cards.
Coach Harry Wolter will have but
two pitchers to use in tomorrow's
game. Oviatt and Collins, two right
banders, are the men who will do the
mound work for Stanford. Milt Teague,
who played last year, has quit practice,
and Jim Aydelotte, a left-handed pitch
er, is now in winter training with the
j San Francisco Seals. Wolter has not
! yet decided whether he will start
| Oviatt or Collins tomorrow, but it is
! probable that regardless of the order
! in which they go into the game, both
! will see service.
As for the rest of the lineup, it will
i be the same as was used against the
j Kenealy Seals. Solomon, who pitched
last year, but who has been changed
| to the catching job recently, will be
behind the bat.
Captain Chuck Johnston at first,
Roberts at second, Mulchay at short,
and Cuddeback at third will make up
the infield with Stewart, McCandless,
and Brown in the outfield.
The M. J. B. lineup will include:
Ross, catcher; Steengrase, pitcher;
,Ryan, first base; H. Christensen, sec
ond base; Mellana, shortstop; Conol
ley, third base; and Back, Christensen,
and Hawk in the outfield.

Stanford's varsity baseball team will
meet the M. J. B. Coffee Kids of San
Francisco tomorrow at 2:30 on the
varsity diamond. This will be the
fourth game of the season for the
Cards, as the rainy weather of the past
two weeks has forced the cancellation
of three dates from the schedule.
The M. J. B. outfit has not played
a game this season, but their strength
can be estimated by the lineup. The
Coffee Kids have several major league
recruits and other players of consider
able reputation on the team and will
probably furnish stiff opposition for
the Stanford men.
Steengrase is the big star of the
visiting team. He is a pitcher who has
built up a good record on the coast
and who is going to the Chicago White
Sox in the spring. He is expected to
l>e a hard man for the Cards to hit.
Conolley, third baseman, is another
big league recruit and will be sent to
Boston next year. Mellana, a 17-year
old star playing at shortstop, will leave
soon for the St. Louis training camp.
The heavy-hitter of the team is Lee
Ryan, first-baseman, who led the Ala
meda League in*batting last year.
The Coffee Kids, like Cliff Ireland's
team, will bring with them a comedian
of the diamond, "Sea Cap" Christen
sen, who will amuse the crowd from
right field. His favorite trick is turning
a hand-spring before he catches a fly.
In the three games played so far
by the Stanford men, not a win has
