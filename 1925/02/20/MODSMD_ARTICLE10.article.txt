# FRESHMEN TO MEET CUBS TONIGHT IN SECOND TILT
## 1928 Squad Favored to Win Annual Series After Taking First Game 
### 
In the second game of the series,
1 the Stanford freshmen will oppose the
j California yearling five at 8 o'clock
; tonight in the pavilion. Should the
j Cards repeat their performance of last
! week and win the second game, tho
[series will go to them, but should Iho
Berkeley quintet come through with
a victory it will necessitate playing a
third game next week to decide the
affair.
Because of their victory last Friday,
the Stanford team is the favorite in
tonight's game. It is certain, on the
other hand, that the California five
will be a wide-awake aggregation this
evening and will not be caught off
their guard as they were last week.
Coach Talt will probably use the
combination which worked so well in
the second half of the last game and
which seemed to be a much better
match for the Cards than his first
lineup.
The Stanford freshmen were great
ly aided in their victory by the scintil
lating performance of Captain Bill
Clark,, who scored 16 points. If Clark
or the two forwards, Crist and Vin
centi, have difficulty in finding the
range of the basket, the scorebook may
tell a different story tonight.

Both these forwards are capable of
chalking up baskets but the Bruin de
fense is hard to penetrate. Clark, by
reason of his height, is a valuable and
dangerous man near the basket.

Hurff is the player that the Cards
will have to watch tonight. He was
the star for California in the first game
and accounted for a total of 11 points.
