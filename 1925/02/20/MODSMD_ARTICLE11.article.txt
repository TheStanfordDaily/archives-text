# BOXING TEAM MEETS CALIFORNIA AGGIES AT DAVIS TOMORROW
## 
### 
The varsity boxers will meet the
California Aggies at Davis Farm to
morrow night in the first match of the
year. The squad leaves tomorrow
morning.
Harry Maloney is confident that the
Cardinal fighters will win over the
Aggies, although little is known of
the strength of the opponents.
In spite of the loss of "Ike" Har
ward and Jake Irwin, captain last sea
son, through ineligibility, new men
have come up who will fill their places
capably and who lack only the experi
ence gained from competition.
Captain Vince Martin, fighting wel
terweight, should defeat his opponent
tomorrow. Last year he had an im
pressive record. His shifty style and
hard punching enabled him to score a
series of knockouts, and after the close
of the season he boxed in the Olympic
tryouts for Coast men. His form is at
present as good as his best of a year
ago.
To form the basis of the team with
Captain Martin are Carlos Miron in
the featherweight division, Schall, a
middleweight, and Farmin, who fights
in the light-heavyweight class. All
three of these men have improved in
the practice work.
