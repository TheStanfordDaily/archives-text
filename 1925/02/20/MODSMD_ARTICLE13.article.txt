# Stanford 130's Outclassed in Initial Game With Babe Quintet
## 
### 
The ISO's are all set for the Califor
nia lightweights in (heir second tilt
tomorrow night in a preliminary to the
varsity game. The Stanford team was
outclassed in the initial meeting but
after a week of hard practice it is
hopeful of making a better showing
against the Hears.
I Led by Koppa, the California live
is a fast, point-registering team. The
Cards found no little trouble in apply
ing a check to their basket-shooting
I habit. Better passing will be necessary
if they expect to slip through the Bruin
defense tomorrow night.
Coach Davis will start Meyers and
1 Brockway in the forward positions,
Lee at Center, and Captain Hobro and
i Geery in the guard berths.
