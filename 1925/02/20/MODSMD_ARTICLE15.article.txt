# STANFORD GOLFERS WILL COMPETE FOR COAST LINKS TITLE
## College Players of Three States Stage Tourney At Del Monte 
### 
More than fifteen golfers from Stan
ford will compete this week-end with
the foremost players of California,
Oregon, and Washington universities
for the intercollegiate championship of
the Pacific Coast. The tournament will
be played on the Del Monte links.
Judging by the interest that has
been manifested during the past
month a record-breaking field will tee
off in the qualifying round tomorrow
morning. Vance Carter, Stanford golf
manager, is handling all the details of
the tourney. {
If weather conditions continue pleas
ant the course should be in the best
of shape and some good scores should
be turned in. Although most of the
men whom Carter is taking down are
veterans, they will have to be at the
top of their form if they are to be in
the running for the title, as they will
be matched against a number of golf
ers who have made names for them
selves in open competition. Jim Wil
son, Dick Lang, Eddie Meyberg, Ash
ton Stanley, Vance Carter, and Rupert
Quinn are among the Stanford men
expected to put in the strongest bids
for victory.

Wilson Is Best Bet

Wilson is the veteran of the squad,
having played on the varsity for three
years. He won the University tourna
ment held at Menlo Park last spring
and has done consistently good work
in all the competition in which he has
represented Stanford. Having lived in
Carmel for many years, Wilson knows
the Del Monte links perfectly, and for
this reason he may be considered the
Cards' .best bet.
Lang is a sophomore playing his
first season on the varsity. He is a
man who shoots around 79 consis
tently. In the tournament with Cali
fornia he was the only Redshirt to
win his match. He has been medalist in
the qualifying rounds of several intra
mural meets, and was a member of
the freshman team which defeated the
California babes last year.

Meyberg Has Good Record

The youngest member of the squad |
is Eddie Meyberg, a freshman who is j
registered in the University for the |
first time this quarter. He has earned j
a splendid reputation by his perform
ances in invitational tournaments
around Los Angeles. In the last state
amateur tourney he was ranked in the
second flight.
