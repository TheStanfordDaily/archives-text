# CARD QUINTET BATTLES BEAR IN TITLE GAME
## Belasco Most Formidable of California Aggregation; Ladar Dangerous 
### 
Stanford and California quintets will
battle tomorrow night in the pavilion
at 8 o'clock in the third and deciding
game of the varsity aeries.
California, with two straight vic
tories to its credit, has every advan
tage to win, and hardly a chance of
losing. Stanford, on the other hand,
has a possibility of winning the next
two games of the series with a tie at
stake, and a possible fifth game in
which to decide the title.
The California team, for all its speed
and ability, will, nevertheless, not be
any heavy faforite to win this deciding
contest. Kerr has been working hard
during the last week polishing his of
fense and strengthening his defense.
Nevers is shooting better in practice
than he has all season. Last Saturday
at Oakland Nevers was easily the out
standing star, both in the score column
and on the floor.

Ladar, Holmes Clever

If the Stanford team can maintain
any semblance of the defense it ex
hibite last week, California's speedy
forwards are due for some hard at
tempts to reach the basket. But L.adar
and Holmes are clever players, and
Belasco is a veritable opposition in
himself.
Belasco's uncanny ability to land
one of his repeatedly atempted long
shots spelled ruin for the Cards last
Saturday. Belasco took more tries at
the basket than any man on the floor,
many of them long, ill directed, but
in the batch there were always a few
which seemed to have an unquench
able affinity for the net.

Mitchell's Game Better

Kerr's best combination on the floor
seems to be: Nevers and David at for
ward; Harry Shipkey at center; and
Cliva and Mitchell at guards. Mitchell,
undoubtedly, is playing a better game
at present than at any time this sea
son, and David, fast, accurate, and re
liable, is easily a good 'first-string
choice.
The California lineup will probably
consist of Ladar, Holmes, Higgins,
Belasco, and Carver.
