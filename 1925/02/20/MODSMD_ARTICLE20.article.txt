Just how the election board expects to operate a precinct voting system
without requiring students to cast their ballots in the precinct in which
they are registered remains unexplained, now that the board and the
election commission have decided the plan to be worth trying.
To object to a rule which makes this requirement is to object to the
present system. Even now the voters are divided into two groups
alphabetically. If this objection has any weight, why is it that a man is
not allowed to get his ballots from the clerk distributing to the opposite
group? Why is he prevented from voting at the women's polls? The
obvious answer is that checking votes is more easily accomplished under
this arrangement.
The simplest and most efficient manner in which to conduct any
campus election is to use the University Directory for checking. What
few exceptional cases would be affected by any inconvenience under the
requirement of voting in their registered precinct, would be negligible.
No matter how a man may be situated, to vote in any one of the
precincts would be more convenient than to vote at the present Quad
polling place.
A perfect scheme should not be expected. If there were a more nearly
perfect plan for voting, cities would have adopted it long ago. Precinct
voting is better than central polling. It saves time. There are fewer
persons who must vote at the precinct poll and the line is shorter. The
poll is geographically nearer and so is more easily and quickly reached.
These facts have been proven again and again in other communities.
Only one practical scheme for operating this system has been sug
gestedâ€”checking by University registration. If cities had official direc
tories which were brought up to date every three months, cities would
have no need for requiring voters to make the extra effort to register
before every election.
To disregard this advantage is to complicate matters unnecessarily.
With bawl-out checking, precincts are simple and advantageous. With
another system, the scheme would not be advantageous.
No reasons for opposing precincts have been presented. Until these
objections are forthcoming, it is logical to suppose that eithei there are
no dissenters, or that those dissenters have only private reasons for
objecting to the scheme.
It is maintained that precincts will get more votes out. If getting
more votes out is not desirable, there must be a reason. Let s have it
now so that the discussion in the executive committee may be as illumi
nated as possible.
Or is everybody agreed that the scheme is worth a trial ?
