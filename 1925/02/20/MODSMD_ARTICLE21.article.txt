The Editor —Sir:
An editorial of Wednesday's Daily
Palo Alto suggested that the Men's
Council handed down an extraordinary
paternal decision under pressure of
faculty demands. The recommendation
of the Council was that A Certain
Student be required to take 18 hours
a quarter under the direction of his
major professor for the rest of his
natural residence at the University.
An important trust is placed in this
body by the students who elect its
members; and this is appreciated. Yet
at no time this year has it been neces
sary to guard this trust from encroach
ment by outside persons, as was in
timated. The Administration and fac
ulty have not once asked the Council
to hand down a particular decision; on
the contrary it has been their policy
to respect the freedom of student con
trol and keep their hands off. And no
recommendation of the Men's Council
has been to the present rejected by
the President of the University.
In the above case the 18 hours a
quarter sentence was selected by the
council in lieu of suspension from the
University, for which there was ade
quate cause. The purpose was to give
the man a last chance. The reason the
more usual punishipent of adding
hours to the man's graduation require
ments was not meted out was because
under the circumstances such a pun
ishment would have been wholly inef
fective as the student already has
more than the needed number of hours |
and there was evidence that he had j
for some time been taking only a few i

hours a quarter and had been making
very objectionable use of the time i
which he so generously bestowed upon
himself.
That there should be criticism of
recommendations of the Men's and
Women's Councils is not surprising be
cause no statement of the case accom
panies the decision. This is because
it is still considered good policy to
prevent the names of persons charged
with offenses becoming known to the
public.
