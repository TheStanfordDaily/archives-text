## "Dodson's Hints on Musical Hits" 
### 
Ransacking the 33 slogans submitted
for one worthy of first prize, "Nip"
McHose and Don Liebendorfer agreed
that the contribution of L. H. Rogers,
appearing above, rated the honor.
Today an order for one-half dozen
dance records was mailed to Rogers
with thanks.
The slogans submitted ran the
gamut of human emotions from "Tire
some Talks by Tuneful Tommy" to
"Music hath power to charm."
Now that this column is completely
installed with a head drawn by a
Stanford man (you will find Del Daves'
name in the cut if you look hard
enough) and with a motto by another
Stanfordite, the future holds no ter
rors.
"Dodson's hints on musical hits" —
hmm, looks like a remark or two rela
tive to today's releases—is in order.
"Alabamy Bound" and "Call of the
South" played by Paul Whiteman and
His Orchestra is a typical Whiteman
record which is to say it's above the
average. Both are easy, smooth fox
trots and the last has plenty of color.
Waring's Pennsylvanians play "Annie
Dear" and Dan Gregory's Orchestra
plays "Then You'll Know That You're
in Love" on the same record. Both
are brisk.
The Victor Male Chorus sings
"Serenade" and "Drinking Song."
Beautiful harmony abounds in the
first. "The "Drinking Song" is as in
teresting as its name. .
