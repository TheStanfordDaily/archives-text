# TRACK SQUADS WILL COMPETE TOMORROW
## 
### 
Coach "Dink" Templeton will put his
varsity and freshman track squads
through their second trial meet of
the season tomorrow morning at 10:30
on the old oval. Only a heavy rain will
prevent the meet.
As it is early in the season, only
three-fourths distances will be run.
Templeton is using the Saturday
morning meets in an effort to gain a
line on the varsity prospects and to
develop a freshman team. The latter
class has put forth a few possibilities
but "Dink" hopes for a larger turnout
tomorrow than ever before.
