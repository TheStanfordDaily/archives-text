# BABE NINE TACKLES OAKLAND TECH TEAM
## 
### 
If weather permits, the freshman
baseball squad will take on Oakland
Technical High School at 10 o'clock
tomorrow morning on the 1928 dia
mond.
Rain has prevented the Tech nine
from playing many games this year,
so it has not been possible to get a
line on its ability. Hunt will start
practically the same lineup which
worked against San Mateo Wednesday,
with Philippi in the box.
