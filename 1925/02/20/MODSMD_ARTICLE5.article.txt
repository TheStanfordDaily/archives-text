# "MACBETH" TO HAVE ELEVEN SETTINGS DESIGNED BY KILER
## Shakespearian Tragedy to Complete Variety of Dramatic Season 
### Charles Simons 
Eleven distinctive sets are being
constructed by Les Kiler for the Eng
lish Club's production of "Macbeth"
which will be given in the Assembly
hall on March 6 and 7.

The action of "Macbeth" calls for
twelve scenes with only two of these
alike, and the settings, which Kiler is
designing, are expected to help as
much as any other factor in making
the show a success. The material to
be used in their construction is so
light that the problem of scene shift
ing will be greatly simplified.
Intensive rehearsals have been in
progress for* the past two weeks, and
the cast, which is exceptionally large,
has already learned most of the lines.
"Macbeth" is one of the hardest of
Shakespeare's plays to produce prop
erly, and Gordon Davis is already in
sisting on verbatim lines in order to
insure a finished performance.

Tragedy Is Step Forward

The introduction of Shakespearian
tragedy into the Stanford dramatic
season will be another step forward in
the plan of the Dramatic Council to
make Stanford University's name a by
word for all that is best in entertain
ment. Comedies, musical revues,
dramas, in fact every sort of dramatic
effort has been seen on the Stanford
stage in the past two years. There has
been but one field, that of Shakes
pearian tragedy, which has not been
represented. This lack will be fully
made up when "Macbeth" is presented
next month.

Interest Is Widespread

Interest in Stanford's production of j
Shakespeare's greatest tragedy is not
confined to the campus and Palo Alto, <
for numerous inquiries as to the dates !
of performance have been received by
the Dramatic Manager from many
parts of the peninsula. The recent ap
pearance of the famous Fritz Leiber
in San Francisco, where he presented
a repertoire of Shakespearian plays, |
including "Macbeth," is probably re-:
sponsible for the inquiries. There are ,
so few leading Shakespearian actors ,
who come to the Pacific Coast that'
when one does come he leaves behind j
him an awakened interest on the part!
f)f the public in the works of the
greatest of all playwrights. It was due j
to this unprecedented demand for in
formation regarding the play that led
the Dramatic Council to schedule two |
performances instead of the usual one. !
