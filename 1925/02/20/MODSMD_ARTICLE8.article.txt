# ELECTION BOARD TO RECOMMEND NEW VOTING SYSTEM
## Eight Precincts Suggested to Facilitate General Participation 
### 
Members of the Election Board and
Election Commission at a joint meet
ing last night voted 7 to 2 in favor
of recommendation of the precinct
system of voting at A. S. S. U. elec
tions to the Executive Committee.

The recommendation provided for
the establishment of eight precincts
on the campus but not requiring stu
dents to vote in their own precinct.
This last condition was balloted on
after the decision was made to back
the precinct plan.
By a vote of 7 to 2 the board op
posed the proposition that the results
of the voting be published by precinct,
also.
The chief argument used by the
backers of the precinct plan was that
a larger number of voters would ballot
than is the case under the present
system of having two polls, one for
men and one for women.
No definite manner for checking up
on the possibility of a student voting
more than once was suggested. This
problem is believed to be one of the
main barriers to the adoption of the
plan as made by the Election Board.
It was pointed out that punching stu
dent body cards would prevent a stu
dent from voting more than once. .
The Executive Committee will hold
its regular meeting next Tuesday night
and the precinct system will be
brought, up for discussion at that time.
