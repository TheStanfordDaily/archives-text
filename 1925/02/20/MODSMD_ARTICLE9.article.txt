# STANFORD SHOULD TURN OUT STRONG 1925 TENNIS TEAM
## 
### 
Tennis prospects at Stanford for the
1925 season point to the possibility of
turning out a winning team, despite
the fact that Captain Harold Overfelt
is the only man remaining from last
year's varsity team.
Overfelt has had much experience
in match contests, and plays a con
sistently good game. He was a mem
ber of the team that toured Australia
last summer.
Stanford's best prospect is in Cran
ston Holman, who captained last year's
freshman squad. He ranks No. 2 ( on
the National Junior rating and holds
numerous titles. Paul Fairchild, who
played on the 1926 freshman team,
ranks third among the varsity players.
He has gained much knowledge of
tenis during the past two years in city
tournaments and on one occasion
nearly defeated "Peck" Griffin â€”one
of the best players in the West.

Ogden and Davidson, Nos. 4 and 5,
are both varsity material. Ogden
played against California with the
1926 freshmen. Davidson has been on
the squad for the past two years.
Ranking Nos. 6, 7, and 8, are Coffin,
Willard, and McCleave.
