# Important Research on Leprosy Cure Undertaken by Chemist
## 
### 
Research work is being done in
the Chemistry department here by
Hashimoto, a Japanese investigator.
Surrounded by retorts, stills and con
densers he is step by step isolating
the many complex substances which
go to make up the puzzling but im
portant substance, known as chalmoo
gra oil, the only known cure for lep
rosy. Mr. Hashimoto is working with
the co-operation of Professor S. W.
Young of the Chemistry department.
So far little has been known of chal
moogra oil save that it had the power
of relieving leprosy, for ages thought
incurable. It may even be possible,
later on, to ascertain just what com
ponent of the oil is responsible for its
curative properties.
Chalmoogra oil is obtained by press
ing the nuts of the chalmoogra tree,

I found in Burma, and has been used for
centuries as a native remedy in India.
Since 1910 its use has been adopted by
the medical world with surprising sue- i
cess.
It is administered in the form of a
medicine and also introduced into the
systems of the patients by injections i
into the blood and muscles. The dose
is regulated mainly by the amount the
patient can stand. In 1904 Powers iso
lated two of the substances in the oil,
but this investigation is the first to be
carried out with completeness.
Unsuspected Compounds Found
Hashimoto states that he finds the |
oil an exceedingly complex substance ;
and many compounds that it was not !
suspected to contain have been iso
lated from it* The work is difficult i
