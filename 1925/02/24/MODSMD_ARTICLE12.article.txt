# DAVIS FARM BOXERS OVERCOME CARDS IN MATCHES SATURDAY
## Stanford Squad Loses Four Bouts to Aggie Men by Close Decisions 
### 
The California Agies won over
the Stanford boxers 4 to 3 in a
match at Davis Farm Saturday
night. All three bouts lost to the
Aggies were on decisions after
three rounds of hard fighting.
In the first bout Collins, in the
bantamweight class, pushed Captain
Meihle of Davis, Pacific Coast Inter
collegiate Champion, to the limit, and
lost on decision. Collins is new to the
boxing game at Stanford and was
brought out by the novice tournament
conducted by Harry Maloney.
Captain Vincent Martin scored an
easy victory over Miller of the Aggies
by gaining a technical knockout. Mar
tin had an easy time with his oppon
ent and was never in danger.
In what was declared by the
officials to be one of the best
bouts seen at Davis Farm, Jim
Arthur defeated Tuttle by a wide
margin, although the bout went to
a decision at the end of the third
round.
Myron Schall won handily over Mc-
Kerron in the middleweight class
after three rounds of fast fighting. In
the light-heavyweight division, Rollin
Farmin lost in the closest go of the
night. At the end of the third round
the judges declared the bout a draw,
and Grubbs of Davis captured the
extra round by a small margin.
In the featherweight and lightweight
classes Miron and Parsons lost the de
cision to Gomez and Schwall, the Aggie
men. Both bouts were close and were
a toss-up until the final round.
Harry Maloney was satisfied with the
showing made by the team, which was
new to the ring at Stanford with the
exception of Captain Martin. As all
the boiits lost were in doubt until the
last, he is confident that the decision
will be reversed when the two squads
meet again at Stanford on March 7.
