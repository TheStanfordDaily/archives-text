# SISSON WILL TALK ON EDUCATION FOR POLITICS TONIGHT
## Civic Importance of School Training Is Speaker's Special Interest 
### 
"Can We Educate for Politics?"
is the subject of a lecture by Ed
ward O. Sisson at 7:30 tonight in
the Little Theatre.
Dr. Sisson has written much on
the subject of the administration
problems in university education.
His special interest has been civic
education, and according to Edgar
E. Robinson, director of citizen
ship, "Dr. Sisson has recently pre
sented a group of striking conclu
sions on the teaching of history
and citizenship."
In view of the fact that Stanford has
been a pioneer in the teaching of citi
zenship, Dr. Sisson's lecture will be
especially timely, and will present an
opportunity to judge Stanford's course
in relation to the need for civic educa
tion.
Dr. Sisson is at present a special lec
turer in education at the University of
California. He was at one time president
of Montana State University, and was
professor of education and of philosophy
at Reed College.
In an article on "The Political Aims of
American Education" which appeared in
the January 21, 1923, number of School
and Society, Dr. Sisson says: "The rul
ing powers of the past have never desired
to educate citizens but to train subjects.
Hence the traditional school is anti-demo
cratic. It reached its zenith in the Ger
man system just prior to the great' war,
the pupil asked no questions; the con
trolled school 'told him all he needed to
know.'"
This kind of efficiency will not do, as
Germany soon discovered, observes Dr.
Sission. "The autocratic order came first
in evolution because it was easier to prac
tice and easier to train for. The demo
cratic comes now because it is better, al
though far harder to practice and harder
to train for. That is our problem, and we
must face it. It is a problem for which
our tradition of liberty, which goes at
least as far back as the Magna Carta in
England, well suits us," says Dr. Sisson.
