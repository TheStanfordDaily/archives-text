# TRACK SQUAD MAKES GOOD RECORDS IN EARLY-SEASON MEET
## 
### 
Louis Gaspar was the sensation of
the freshman-varsity meet Saturday
morning when he placed first in the
IOOi-yard dash with a time of 0:10 1-10.
This is 3-10 of a second better time
than has been recorded this season in
the century and is all the more out
standing because it was made on a
heavy track.
Gaspar finished with a strong, even
stride, giving prospects of even better
performances. He also placed first in
the 220-yard dash.
Captain "Tiny" Hartranft improved
his throw of 135 feet with the discus
for a first in last week's meet by toss
ing it 14S feet 4 inches this Saturday.
This was 2 feet 5 3-4 inches beyond
the mark of 145 feel 11 1-4 inches he
set in the Stanford-California meet last
