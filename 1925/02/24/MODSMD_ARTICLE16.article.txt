# TRACK SQUAD MAKES GOOD RECORDS IN EARLY-SEASON MEET
## 
### 
Louis Gaspar was the sensation of
the freshman-varsity meet Saturday
morning when he placed first in the
IOOi-yard dash with a time of 0:10 1-10.
This is 3-10 of a second better time
than has been recorded this season in
the century and is all the more out
standing because it was made on a
heavy track.
Gaspar finished with a strong, even
stride, giving prospects of even better
performances. He also placed first in
the 220-yard dash.
Captain "Tiny" Hartranft improved
his throw of 135 feet with the discus
for a first in last week's meet by toss
ing it 14S feet 4 inches this Saturday.
This was 2 feet 5 3-4 inches beyond
the mark of 145 feel 11 1-4 inches he
set in the Stanford-California meet last
year but still under his toss of 158
feet 8 inches in the I.C.A.A.A.A. at
Cambridge last June.
Swayne, running practically against
time, finished the 660 in 1:26 which,
with a margin of 30 seconds for the
additional 220 yards, was a good 1:56
for the 880. Richardson was not run
ning.
Miller looked better than he did a
week ago, leading Gartliwaite and
Adams in the 352 to finish in 0:35 3-5
seconds. His time last Saturday was
0:40 2-5.
A new prospect for .the freshman
distance events was discovered in Ran
ney, who kept behind Murphy for five
laps of the six-lap race, finally finish
ing in first place.
Leistner entered three events and
finished with two first places and a
second. The high hurdles he took in
the good time of 0:15 5-10 with Nichols,
the freshman hurdles star, close be
hind. He was also first in the low
sticks and second in the century.
