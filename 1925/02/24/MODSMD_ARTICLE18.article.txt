Prospects for a long series of basketball victories look bright after last
week-end. The freshmen closed their season by winning the series with
California and the varsity started out toward doing the same thing. The
most notable feature of the varsity victory is the fact that it was largely
accomplished by the sophomore team. With all of this material out for
varsity next year, the winning should be easy.
The winning should be easy for the rest of this year, for that matter.
The sophomore players showed that they have the Berkeley number and
they didn't look as though they were likely to forget it. With more time,
these men might have made the score even larger. It is doubtful, how
ever, if anything could have made Stanfordites happier than that 16 to 15
margin.
Presently the awarding of letters will be considered. While the regular
teams were winning, the weight basketball men were having no such ex
perience, and, as a result, there is some doubt as to whether or not the
lightweight players will receive any reward for their work.
It has always been a Cardinal policy to encourage sport for its own
sake. The losing Stanford teams have worked conscientiously. They
have played hard to win. That they did not is to the credit of California
and not to their discredit.
When the varsity and freshmen winners receive their awards, and who
doubts that such a varsity as played Saturday will win, we hope that
recognition is given the less successful lightweight players. They deserve
it also.
