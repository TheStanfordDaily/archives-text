It comes clearly to mind that there is a rule against this practice. The
penalty for breaking the law has been set at a costly figure, but with no

To anyone who makes a study of the problem, it is obvious that an
undeveloped mind is responsible for such book-scoring. Ihe portions

significant remarks ordinarily written in the margin are, usually, "I
think so" or "new idea" or else they are illegible, which is even more
