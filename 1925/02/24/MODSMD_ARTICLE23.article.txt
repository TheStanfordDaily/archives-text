# THE 						LAW STEPS
## V. G. D.

People are funny; and here their
traits come out beautifully magnified.
They love to be exclusive—whatever
that really means; it is evident that
they have excluded most of life, but
why they should be proud of it Heaven
only knows.
And they like to be subtle —anything
for the sake of not being obvious. They
gloat over intrigue like an Italian
count.
Mysteriousness is excellent, too. It
arouses the most curiosity with the
least effort. And when mixed with an
air of extreme busy-ness the effect is
enticing.
"Ask nothing of anyone!" That
sounds gloriously free —like a pirate
with a knife between his teeth.
But it is certainly true, too, that if
you ask nothing of anyone you will
get it. It is obvious that many people
are doing just that —splendidly.
They are called "college men and
women;" they are like ducks in a
flock of chickens: the chickens strut
ting about, secretly wondering what
it is all about, and the ducks trying
to imitate the chickens' sprightly walk.
Horses are canny. They can tell
when a man is afraid —horses, and pro
fessors, and women. And they act ac
cordingly, with little actual mental
process.
Why is it that some people make
you feel alive, and others —quite the
opposite?
And why do you take voluminous
notes from some professors, and write
poetry in the classes of others?
"The little things, the little things!
It is upon these that the great issues
wait."
