# BANTAM BASKETBALL TEAM LOSES SERIES TO CALIFORNIA FIVE
## 
### 
By again defeating the Stanford 130's
25 to 15, Saturday night, the California
lightweights won the 130-pound scries. At
half time the Cards were leading 11-9,
During the first half the Stanford team
liad the Bears humping due particularly
to the basket shooting of Hobro and the
good guarding of Geery.
In the second lialf, however, the Berke
ley five made 16 potxits and held the Cards
to 4. It was not until about the middle of
the half, however, that the Californians
started going. A basket by Lcith which
put them ahead 16 to 15 started the works.
From then on the points piled up which
substitutions by Coach Davis failed to
check.
Captain Hobro was high point man
with 10 points. He played his best game
of the season. Meyers couldn't find the
direction of the basket all evening, missing
a number of shots. A good many of the
Bears' baskets were obtained through the
cooperation of the Stanford players who
handed them the ball right under the
Bears' basket.
Until about the last five minutes the
Cards were fighting their opponents on
even terms but they suddenly weakened
and a deluge of California baskets fol
lowed.
The line-up was as follows:
Stanford (15) California (25)
Hobro (10) f Anixter (2)
Meyers f Curtis (3)
Lee (2) c Rasmussen (2)
Bushnell (2) g Serafino (4)
Geery g Zispoli
Substitutesâ€”Stanford, Suffern (1),
Brockaway. California, Koppa (4),
Leithe (7), Smith, Shaw (3), Levin,
Bailey, Blackwelder.
