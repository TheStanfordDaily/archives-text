# Davis Addresses Geology Men on Coral Problems
## 
### 
Dr. William Morris Davis, of Harvard
University, spoke to the members of the
Geology department yesterday afternoon
on the subject "Coral Reef Problems."
After over 11 years of research Dr.
Davis is inclined to believe that the Dar
win theory is the most correct one, but
needs the addition of the glaciation theory.
