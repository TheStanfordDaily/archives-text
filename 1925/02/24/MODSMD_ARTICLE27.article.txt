# NICHOLS, HURDLES CHAMP, INCREASES BABE TRACK HOPES
## 
### 
With a few stellar Individual per
formers as a nucleus, Coach "Dink"
Templteton lias hopes of building a
fairly strong freshman track squad.
His chief difficulty will be in develop
ing second and third place point win
ners for a number of events.
Nichols, last year interscholastic
champion hurdler, has been stepping
over the sticks in an impressive
fashion. With Rupe and King both
doing over 6 feet, the high jump seems
to be well taken care of. Anderson has
been passing the 21-foot mark in the
broad jump, which is good early sea
son distance.
Wortliington, Salsman and Smisseart
appear to be the best performers in
the furlong. In the 100-yard dash Bly
and Burton seem to be the fastest of
the candidates.
News has been received from Cali
fornia of the ineligibility of Lockehart,
star distance runner, who displayed
a good deal of class in winning the
Olympic tryouts for the two-mile in
the Stanford stadium last year. This
announcement gives some hope for
the Stanford distance runners who are
headed by Ranney, winner of the intra
mural cross-country run.
McGuire, who trailed Smith closely
last Saturday, and Boardon are dis
playing good form in the quarter mile.
Collins appears to be the best of the
half-mile runners.
Templeton may have potentialities
in his sprint men and a couple of
weeks more of training should bring
it out. He is searching for weight-tos
sing talent among the yearlings and
is also keeping an eager eye on the
vaulting pit.
The Irish Marathon next week /will
give some of the runners the first
chance to show their worth.
