# STANFORD 145-POUND FIVE LOSES SECOND GAME TO BEAR SQUAD
## 
### 
The California lightweights won the
145-pound weight team series Friday
night when for the second time they
defeated the Stanford 145's 2C-16 in
the preliminary to the freshman game.
The same thing that caused the Cards
to succumb the first game spelled de
feat Friday night. The Bears were too
speedy.
By the scrappy defense work of
Cairns and Clark and by field goals of
the latter, Blazier and George, the
Stanford five held the Berkeley team
to a score of 8-7 the first half. The
Cards were, perhaps, a little too
scrappy for they allowed the Bruins
10 free throws in this period, 6 of
which were converted into points.
The close following of the ball, how
ever, by Captain Clark and Cairns was
undoubtedly the factor in keeping
down the score of the Californians.
At the opening of the second period
Lieschiz, who was high point man
with 13 counters, started finding the
range of the basket. He seemed to
have a knack of making the Cards
foul him for he was awarded 12 free
throws, scoring on seven of them.

Bears Too Fast

The Stanford lightweights were
never able to catch up with the Bears
from this time on, in spite of the
determined fight that they showed.
Much improvement was noticeable
in the playing of the Cardinal five,
especially in working the ball down
faster. Where before they held the
ball and let the Bear defense get set,
they now got rid of it quickly, and
worked it through.
Clark and Cairns were both responsi
ble for some good defensive work.
Smith scored most of Stanford's points,
making 7 in all. Although both missed
a number of shots, Blazier and George
played hard fast basketball and fol
lowed the ball closely.
The lineup was:
Stanford (16) California (26)
George (3) F Leischiz (13)
Blazier (4) P Gibson (3)
Smith (7) C Meyer (1)
Clark, c (2) G Killallee (3)
Cairns G Magnesi
Substitutes —Stanford: Sibbet, Stew
art, Kunzel, Dunfree, James. Califor
nia: Werner (4), Pofanelli (2), Potter,
Healey, Laßarthe, Seeley.
