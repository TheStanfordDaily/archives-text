Ernst Brandsten has been put
in complete charge of all activities
at Lake Lagunita this year, ac
cording to an anouncement made
by Comptroller A. E. Roth. It is
felt by the University authorities
that the placing of the manage

lake activities.
He will also have charge of improve
ments which are going to be made.
A new log float is to be constructed,
and the other floats and the diving
boards are to be put in shape for the
coming season.
Brandsten says that boating and
swimming in the lake will be strictly
regulated, and that every precaution
would be taken to prevent drownings.
Every person taking a canoe out on
the lake will first be required to pass
a swimming test. This test will not
apply to those who go out in rowboats.
These tests may be taken at the
gymnasium where a certificate will
be given to those passing it, or
they may be taken at the lake
before the life guards in charge.
This rule will apply to everyone.
The women will be given certifi
cates of swimming ability at Roble
gymnasium.
Life guards will be at the lake from
10 o'clock in the morning until 10 at
night, except between the hours of
6 and 7 in the evening. Boating will be
allowed only while the life guards are
on duty. Swimming will be allowed
from 10 in the morning until dark.
Brandsten further stated that the
Palo Alto people will be welcomed to
the lake for boating and canoeing, pro
vided they pass the swimming tests,
but that only students, faculty mem
bers and their children will be allowed
to swim. This is to prevent over-crowd
ing. He said that there is too much
responsibility on the life guards other
wise.
There will be boats and canoes
for rent, and the lake will be open
on Sundays. Storage for canoes
and boats may be had at a nominal
fee.
