# MEN AT STANFORD ABLE TO EARN ALL COLLEGE EXPENSES
## Half of Total Registered Last Quarter Worked in Self-Support 
### 
An evaluation of those students who

are earning their way at Stanford
brings the conclusion in "Concerning
Stanford," a monthly information bul
letin, that there are many valuable
features of university life that only
the self-supporting student finds.
"The applicant for admission is asked
no questions concermng his finances,"
"Concerning Stanford" points out,
"for it is believed that no properly
prepared student who is in good health
and who has no dependents need hesi
tate to undertake a university course
because of lack of means. It is not
until he has met the necessary re
quirements and arrives on the campus
for registration that the University
asks these questions:
" 'Do you expect to earn any of your
college expenses? Do you expect to
earn all of your college expenses? If
not all, what percentage do you expect
to earn? Do you want assistance in
finding part-time work?'
"During the past quarter at Stan
ford, 49.2 per cent of all men and
women enrolled, or 1,453 students,
â€¢were either partially or entirely self-
The majority of these stu
dents earned one-half to all of their
expenses. The percentages of course
vary from quarter to quarter, but a sta
tistical study made in the appointment
office shows that the average continues
to be about 50 per cent."
Most of the self-helping students ob
tain their employment through the ap
pointment office, the bulletin points'
out. Some 34 different kinds of jobs
have been provided this year for stu
dents. These include places as seams
tresses, waiters, stenographers, teach
ers, translators, playground instruc
tors, advertising men, and milk de
liverers.
Students in new part-time positions
earned last year $31,979.33. This does
not take account of those who held
positions from the previous year.
The self-supporting student is wel
comed at Stanford, says the bulletin,
"because of their high ideals, earnest
ness of purpose and the splendid exam
ple they set for their fellows. The fact
that they are self-supporting is, at
Stanford, no handicap, unless one feels
that it is a handicap to be forced to
weight the value of recreation and to
decide whether outside work, study, or
play is the most important thing to be
done at the moment.

Musical programs are presented at
the University -of Oregon under the
auspices of the associated students.
Student body tickets admit their hold
ers to the concerts.
