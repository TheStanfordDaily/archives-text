# BABE GOLFERS MEET CUBS FEBRUARY 28
## 
### 
Freshman golfers will get into ac
tion for the first time when they meet
the California first-year men February
28 at the Burlingame Country Club.
Asliton Stanley, Eddie Meyberg,
Charles Chubbuck, and Harold Hindry
have been chosen to represent Stan
ford. All of these men have been prac
ticing at Burlingame several times a
week for the last two or three months,
and are in good condition. They have
un advantage over the California play
ers in being familiar with the course,
which is an important factor in a short
tournament. The Bear lineup has not
yet been announced.
