# STANFORD SWIMMERS FINISH TRAINING FOR P. A. A. JUNIOR MEET
## Four Races on Program 
### 
Stanford swimmers will have their
second chance tomorrow night to an
nex some Pacific Athletic Association
junior championships when they com
pete at the Olympic Club pool. Brand
sten has been pointing his men for this
event during the week of training just
past.
A squad of eight or nine men will
make the trip. All of these are varsity
swimmers and the majority of them
competed against Northwestern Uni
versity in the dual meet here two
weeks ago.

Four events are on the program for t
tomorrow night and all are races which
were not included in the first set of
P. A. A. junior championships awarded j
last month. The 50-yard sprint, 220-,
yard breast stroke, relay, and medley!
will receive the attention.
Fletcher and Schwartz will bear the;
brunt of the competition in the 50-j
yard sprint. They swim this distance
between :26 and :27 and are expected;
to be near the former time in tomor
row's race.
/
Captain Schmeider, Pyzel, and Led-1
erman are the Cardinal entries for the i
furlong event. Both Pyzel and Schmei
der will swim a nip-and-tuck race be
tween them as they are rated almost j
on a par. How they will stack up j
against the competition Wednesday is i
an open question.
The relay is an event which ;
the Cardinals stand as good a chance |
of copping as any of the races. Five
men have been named from whom four
will make up the team: Schwartz,
Fletcher, Brooks, Wright, ftnd Mac-j
Allister.
In the last sot of P. A. A. Junior
championships the Olympic Club jun
iors were far in the lead in point
totals, Brandsten's men were in sec
ond place, and the California entries
bringing up the rear.
