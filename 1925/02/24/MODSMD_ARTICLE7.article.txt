# VARSITY, FRESHMEN DEFEAT CALIFORNIA
## 1927 TEAM SAVES CARDS IN FINAL RUSH Babe Quintet Repeats First Victory Over Bear Cubs; Fourth Varsity Game at Oakland Saturday 
### 
Stanford is still in the running for
the Pacific Coast Conference basket
ball championship, largely because
five sophomores dazzled California
with their clever passing and bril
liant shooting, bringing the Cards
out of an eight-point hole and giving
them a 16 to 15 victory over Cali
fornia Saturday night in the third
conference game.
California looked like a sure winner
the first half, keeping the Cards a safe
distance from the hoop, and running
up a score of 8 to 5. Jorgenson, who
took Ladar's place on the Bruin squad,
located the hoop twlee the next half
and before the Cards knew what was
happening, they found themselves on
the short end of a 14 to 6 count. Then
things got going.

1927 Team Shows Power

The 1927 freshman combination of
David and Price, forwards; Jayred,
center; and Ted Sliipkey and "Moco"
Newhouse, guards, found themselves
playeing together, and at once set to
work to register a knockout over the
Blue and Gold outfit.
Fred Price dropped in the first bas
ket of the game 011 one of his favorite
corner shots. A foul was called and
Higgins converted, making the last
California point of the game.
Price hooked a long pass to
Jayred, who evaded a couple of
guards and lander the ball through
the hoop without touching the
sides. Nelson David broke loose
for two long shots, and with but
six minutes to go California found
themselves holding a precarious
lead of one point.
Captain Dave Oliva went back into
the game to bolster up the defense and

The California freshmen were
again humbled by the 1928 squad
when the Cardinal yearling five won
the second court game from the
Bears, 24-18, and consequently the
series, Friday evening in the Stan
ford pavilion.
It was a liard-fought contest with
the determination of the Berkeley five
met by the same aggressiveness and
fight which so marked the playing of
the Stanford team in the first game.
From the first five minutes when
Biaggini's field goal put the Cards
ahead 8-7, the Stanford quintet kept
the lead by the margin of a few points
in the rest of the game. The first half
ended with the score 15-8. Three long
shots by Crist, Vincenti, and Dennis
featured the scoring in this period.

Dennis Stars for 1928

Led by Hurff the Bears came back
strong at the opening of the second
half and brought the score up to 16-17.
Dennis seemed to think this too close
so he put his team out ahead again
with two pretty field goals. If there
was an individual star for Stanford
it was Dennis who not only scored 9
points but who used his huge bulk time
and again mussing up California's at
tempts at the basket.
Coach Hunt used the same for
mation that was so successful in
the game last week. Captain Bill
Clark played a standing forward
game, receiving the long passes
from the guards and then shooting
the ball to the forwards who fol
lowed down after the pass. Clark
was well covered after his run in
the first game, only being allowed
one field goal.
Biaggini gave a wonderful exhibition
of how to play standing guard. He
had the ball as it bounded off of the
backboard nearly every time and al
ways started it towards the other bas
ket with a well-directed pass. The
Bears were forced to shoot all their
baskets from long range.
Hurff was high point man with 10
points to his credit. Peterson, tall
California center, played a commend
able game, figuring in several plays.
Crist and Vincenti both played
clever, aggressive basketball. Crist
broke through the California defense
several times with some fast, shifty
dribbling.
Coach Talt's men were outclassed
in all departments of the game. The
playing of the Cards Friday proved
conclusively that their first victory was
not a stroke of luck for they repeated
the performance in just as brilliant a
manner as the week previous.
This victory makes the second con
secutive year that Coach Husky Hunt's
men have won the California freshman
series.

Stanford (24) California (18)

Crist (4) F Hurff (10)

Dennis (9) G Beckwith

for five minutes everybody was cover
ing so close that no one could get a
shot. Then, with but 60 seconds to go,
Fred Price looped in a long shot.
Credit for the Stanford victory must
go to the sophomore quintet. They ;
played the fastest brand of ball ex-1
hibited by a Stanford team this year. 1
Wally Jayred, who has been trying to
keep warm on the bench most of the .
season, did the best work of his young
life. His defensive play was unusually
good and his passing brought the ball
within scoring distance on numerous ,
occasions.
Fred Price played the whole game,
and did brilliant work throughout. He 1
never stopped going for a second, and i
played so aggressively that the Cali-'
fornia guards could never keep up,
with him.
Nelson David and "Moco" Newhouse ;
went in at the time when Stanford
didn't seem to have a chance. David
went like a whirlwind but managed to
slow up long enough to aim two per
fect shots—the kind that reach up to
the ceiling and swish through the net
without even brushing against the
hoop.
Newhouse used his 225 pounds to
advantage. Jorgenson and Holmes
could get up to him, but they didn't
have a chance to get around. Ted Ship-!
key likewise did some nice guarding,
usually upsetting Belasco before he j
could get a good shot.
The lineup:
Stanford (16) California (15)
Nevers (3) F Jorgenson (4)
