Philippi Will Pitch

Philippi will start on the mound
against Potter, but Sobieski will prob
ably see service before the end of the
game. Cypher will occupy his regular
position behind the plate. Maguire will
play first. Shifted to that position from
center field in the last game he showed
so much promise that Hunt has de
cided to convert him into a first base
man.
On second will be Garibaldi and at
short, Busch. Garibaldi is one of the
most consistent hitters on the team,
and plays steady ball in the field.
Busch was used at second against San
Mateo, and should go well at short.
Price, who will hold down third base,
is one of the fastest fielders Hunt has.
