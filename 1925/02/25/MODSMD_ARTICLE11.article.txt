# SISSON SAYS "DUTY OF EDUCATION TO HAVE REALISM"
## Freedom of Learning Most Essential to Proper Facing of Facts 
### 
"Every person has the right to learn
I anything he needs to know in order to
do his thinking," declared Edward O.
Sisson, speaking of civic education
last night.
Dr. Sisson pointed out that our pres
ent education falls down in its un
willingness to face facts. "The most
important freedom is not freedom of
speech but of learning, of hearing, of
reading," he declared, pointing out that
this sort of freedom is essential to the
proper facing of facts.
"Realism is a primary need of our
education," he said. "We need a truer
history, both past and present, in order
to prevent such beliefs as that of the
superiority of the past to the present.
We don't hear about the profiteering
involved in the Valley Forge incident.
Good points in our history are also ne
glected, such as the effective disarma
ment which has existed along our
Canadian border since 1817."
Another fact that must be faced,
and one that is the first basis of our
education, according to Dr. Sisson, is
that we are committed to democracy.
"Representative government is an es
sential part of our democracy, and in
order for it to be effective, our schools
must stimulate the capacity to trust
and to be trusted."
That in the present period there is
a great wave of interest in civic edu
cation as there was in vocational edu
cation in the period before, is the be
lief of Dr. Sisson.
