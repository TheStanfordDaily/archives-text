# LASUEN PROVES TO BE POOR FOOTBALL FIELD FOR CALIFORNIA STAR
## 
### 
Lasuen Street is not at all suited
i for open field football tactics, or at
' least "Tut" Imlay, California's stellar
, performer in the big game, has decided
I so as a result of a recent attempt to
I negotiate the row in the approved;
football manner.
"Tut" started out in fine form, but
a Stanford man stopped him before he
reached the other end of Lasuen. The
next year's captain of the Golden Bears
was driving a high-powered car and
strait-armed a car driven by E. V.
Young.
Imlay seems to have been given a
run for his money, for Young is now
suing him for $214.14 damages.
