# NEW MUSICAL GROUP TO BE FEATURE OF GLEE CLUB CONCERT
## Wind Instrument Ensemble Is Unique Organization In California 
### Herbert Klein 
In bringing to the campus the Wind j
Instrument Ensemble of San Fran-|
j cisco, guest artists for the anual Home
I Concert, the Glee Club is giving the
| University an opportunity to hear a
I musical organization unique in the
West.
This group of five instruments, oboe, j
flute, clarinet, basoon, and horn re- j
ceived much praise for the first con- j
cert given two weeks ago in San Fran
cisco, and they have arranged to play
two sections selected from the num-;
bers played then.
C. Addimando, leader «f the En
semble, and solo oboist for the
| San Francisco Symphony Orchestra,
was recently heard in a recital here. '
The rest of the players are also well
known artists.
It would be difficult to express any
| preference in regard to the numbers
; in the Glee Club's repertoire because,
as was shown in recital last Friday
night in Redwood City the audience
I found them uniformly good. Probably
j "Adoramus Te" by Palestrina and
| "Salterelle" by Saint-Saens show the |
; vocal ability of the chorus to the best
j advantage.
The program has been arranged as
follows: a group of numbers by the j
j Glee Club, followed by selections by
j the Ensemble. The club will then sing,
| and several solos will be sung by
I Charles Stratton, baritone. The club
j will sing again and the final selection
J will consist of the chorus accompanied
j by the Ensemble in two numbers, es-,
| pecially arranged for the concert by
! Warren D. Allen, director of the club. ■
The numbers are "Chorus of the Camel
Drivers" from Cesar Franck's "Re
becca" and a choral, "Now Let Every
Tongue Adore Thee," by Bach.
A closed date has been granted to
the Glee Club for the one o'clock dance
to be given in the Women's Clubhouse
immediately after the concert. Seats
for the concert went on sale today at
1 o'clock and are to be obtained in the ;
Administration building. Prices are
seventy-five cents and one dollar.
The repertoire of the club this sea
son contains entirely new songs. This
will be the only concert of the club
1 on the campus this year. During the
j spring a tour in the south is to be
I made.

In bringing to the campus the Wind j
Instrument Ensemble of San Fran-|
j cisco, guest artists for the anual Home
I Concert, the Glee Club is giving the
| University an opportunity to hear a
I musical organization unique in the
West.
This group of five instruments, oboe, j
flute, clarinet, basoon, and horn re- j
ceived much praise for the first con- j
cert given two weeks ago in San Fran
cisco, and they have arranged to play
two sections selected from the num-;
bers played then.
C. Addimando, leader «f the En
semble, and solo oboist for the
| San Francisco Symphony Orchestra,
was recently heard in a recital here. '
The rest of the players are also well
known artists.
It would be difficult to express any
| preference in regard to the numbers
; in the Glee Club's repertoire because,
as was shown in recital last Friday
night in Redwood City the audience
I found them uniformly good. Probably
j "Adoramus Te" by Palestrina and
| "Salterelle" by Saint-Saens show the |
; vocal ability of the chorus to the best
j advantage.
The program has been arranged as
follows: a group of numbers by the j
j Glee Club, followed by selections by
j the Ensemble. The club will then sing,
| and several solos will be sung by
I Charles Stratton, baritone. The club
j will sing again and the final selection
J will consist of the chorus accompanied
j by the Ensemble in two numbers, es-,
| pecially arranged for the concert by
! Warren D. Allen, director of the club. ■
The numbers are "Chorus of the Camel
Drivers" from Cesar Franck's "Re
becca" and a choral, "Now Let Every
Tongue Adore Thee," by Bach.
