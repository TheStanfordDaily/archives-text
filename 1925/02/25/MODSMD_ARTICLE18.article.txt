# CARD MERMEN ENTER IN P. A. A. MEET TONIGHT
## Program at Olympic Club Pool Includes Four Championships 
### Fred Speers 
Ten swimmers wearing the Cardinal
compete tonight in the second set
of P. A. A. junior championship races
to be held in the Olympic Club pool.
Coach Brandsten is confident that his
swimmers will make a better showing
in this meet than in the first set of the
P. A. A. championships.
The 400-yard relay team will be
made up of Schwartz, Fletcher, Brooks,
and Wright. This race includes three
laps for each man and as the Olympic
Club pool is the same length as the
Encina pool the Cardinals will experi
ence little difficulty on the turns. An
idea of the relative strength of Stan
ford and California will be obtained,
as the Bears also have a team in this
event.
In the 50-yard sprint, Brandsten has
entered Fletcher, Brooks, Danford, and
Schwartz. The first three of these men
are the best bets for the Cardinals, as
Schwartz is at his best in the middle
distance races.
Captain Schmeider, Pyzel, and Led
erman have been preparing for the
breast stroke race during the two
weeks of training just past and are
doped to be at their best. Pyzel, who,
though a senior, is swimming his first
year in varsity competition, is hold
ing his own with Schmeider. Lederman.
is a comer with ability.
The 300-yard medley consists of 100
yards back stroke, 100-yard breast
stroke, and the final century swim free
style. In this event Schmeider, Fletch
er, Williams, and Danford are compet
ing for Stanford.
Brandsten has not been training his
men particularly for this event, and
because of this the prospects of their
chances for laurels in this event can
not be guaged.
