# Souvenirs

### 
One hears from time to time, if he is an undergraduate at Cornell, of
the rather harmless covetousness of some of his fellow students, of their
attempts to satiate a desire for possession of such objects as movable
street signs, red lanterns, Pullman quiet signs, store placards, banquet
posters. But it is seldom indeed that this student bent for collection
extends itself to moving picture souvenirs. Perhaps if an investigation
were made it might show rather splendid collections of photographs of the
more prominent stars owned by those few who find a handsome face on
the Crescent screen an object of worship. We doubt exceedingly, how
ever, whether such an investigation would uncover any studied assortment
of cinema posters. Yet inexplicable as it may seem a freshman was fined
recently in a city court, charged with attempting to extricate a moving
picture poster from its metal-rimmed glass cabinet. As a matter of fact
this youthful poster collector had an accomplice, but he, evidently not as
conscientious a follower of this avocation as his compatriot, outran his
blue-coated pursuer.
In searching out a motive for this extraordinary performance of two
Cornell freshmen we are quite prejudiced to a theory of room decoration.
There may have been a beautiful face, or a brilliantly colored picture of
train and automobile racing for the same grade crossing, on this poster.
Either would look well in a freshman's room, particularly if it were
hung along with other similar prizes gained in a cleverer manner. Such
a collection is worthy of the most fastidious of undergraduates. We
might take heart were the freshman accused of lifting a Maxfield Parrish,
or a Detaille, from the wall of a picture store. This at least would show
artistic taste, regardless of the method used in gratifying it.

EVERY YEAR THE GLEE CLUB gives at least one campus con
cert. And every year the Glee Club sings off-campus, presenting an exhi
bition the way Stanford does things. Director Allen's chorus has a repu
tation which is a credit.
A great many students know of the Glee Club's success only by hear
say. They suppose that it is good—everybody seems to say so. But they
do not risk any first hand experimenting. Student support of this organi
zation might well be much greater.
And there is no reason why it shouldn't be. The concerts are as good
entertainment as can be had hereabouts. People come back for more.
When the Glee Club covers the same Territory twice in a comparatively
short time, as is often the case, the audiences are larger, if anything. Palo
Altans have more opportunities to hear these concerts than any other non
university community. If you don't belieye they like it, come around to
the Assembly Hall Friday night for the home concert and count them. It's
worth-while to attend in any case.

THE RAINY SEASON reminds us. Chaparral has inquired before
The Daily is still interested. "What about crew ?"
