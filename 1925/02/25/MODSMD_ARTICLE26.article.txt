THAT NERVOUS BIRD BEHIND
MY SEAT
That nervous bird behind my seat,
Who each day taps and kicks my
chair,
I hope he loses both his feet
Or the tendon in his limbs do tear.
Perhaps if he wore heavy boots
With soles of thick and weighty lead
He'd let me peacefully take notes
Without a wish that he were dead.
Perhaps handcuffs around his legs
Would keep his brogues off of my
stool
And curb his scuffing of the pegs;
But would that stop so big a fool?
Taptap! Taptap! Taptap! Taptap!
For other men he gives no rap.
I'd like to paste him in the map.
O God, why made you such a sap!
Some day in class I'll turn and rise
And to this restless moron slfout,
"I'll sever all your family ties
If you don't pronto beat it out.
"You brainless boob! you thoughtless
lout!
You great big piece of aged cheese!
Move on before your jaw I clout,
Else beg my pardon on your knees!"
I hope that bird behind my seat
Today does read and heed my lay,
For next when in our class we meet
I'll fear a censorious word to say.
â€”R. L. Hauck.
