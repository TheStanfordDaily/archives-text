"THE LADY," Curran Theatre, San
Francisco—Pauline Frederick's acting
was compensation enough for the plot
of this play. The story is of the fcareer
of a chorus girl, and her attempts to
become a lady. The remarkable inci
dent of a mother's meeting her son
after having given him up twenty
years earlier is another of the novel
ties introduced.
After seeing this play, we are con
vinced that Miss Fredericks should
never return to the movies. To waste
such a voice on millions of feet of film
seems criminal to us.
Like most of the plays the writer
has had the fortune of seeing lately,
this one takes place in London and on
the continent. We appreciate the ef
forts of playwrights to educate the
public on various accents, although we
must admit the continued "use of
French in the prologue and epilogue
was quite a strain on our third-year
knowledge of the subject, and we
couldn't help wondering what was hap
pening to the poor dubs who had hap
pened- to choose Spanish on their cur
riculum.
Miss Fredericks was supported in
her appealing characterization by a
cast which made the play alive with
real people of many varieties, each
skillfully interpreted
—Beatrice Flesher.
