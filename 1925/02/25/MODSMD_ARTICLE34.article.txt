# 'High School German to Be Taught Again in Pasadena
## 
### 
German will be taught in the Pasa
dena high school next semester for the
first time since the outbreak of the
World War. The demand for high
school German in the technical and
advanced courses of many universi
ties has made this move Imperative.
German is now taught in all eastern
and in many western high schools. San
Francisco and Oakland have re-estab
lished the subject, and the Los Angeles
school board has voted for its return
in the city schools.
