# Freshman Meeting Plans Dance for Next Quarter
## 
### 
At a meeting of the freshman class
yesterday plans were made for a
dance to be given next quarter, pro
ably May 15 or 16.
It was announced that a "jolly-up"
similar to the one held several weeks
ago at Roble hall will be held next
Tuesday.
Freshmen were urged to pay their
class dues and a motion was carried
that those who failed to contribute to
the treasury last quarter will be taxed
double the amount in the spring.
If sufficient money can be raised
the class will pay for sweaters for
numeral men on the freshman soccer
and swimming teams.
