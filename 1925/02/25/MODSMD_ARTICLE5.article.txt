# S.A.E. PLAYS EL TORO FIVE FOR INTRAMURAL CHAMPIONSHIP TONIGHTS
## 
### 
Sigma Alpha Epsilon and El Toro
meet in the finals of the intramural
basketball series in the Eni'ina gym
at 7:30 tonight. The winners will be
recognized as University champions
and will gain possession of the intra
mural basketball trophy for one year.
The first living group to win the title
three times will retain the cup per
manently.
The S. A. E.'s have come through
the season undefeated, while El Toro
encountered defeat once, early in the
series. Although the row players are
geenral favorites for first honors, the
club team has shown such marked im
provement in its last two games that
it is entirely possible that it may
spring a surprise tonight.
