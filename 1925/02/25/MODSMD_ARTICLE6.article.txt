# "MACBETH" TO HAVE LARGE CAST; SETS ARE IMPRESSIONISTIC
## Saturday Matinee on March 7 Scheduled for Benefit Of School Students 
### Charles Simons 
"Macbeth," which is to be given in
the Assembly hall Friday evening,
March 6th, and Saturday afternoon,
March 7th, will have the largest cast
of any play ever presented at Stanford.
This is, of course, with the exception
of the Greek play, "Oedipus Rex,"
which was presented on the steps of
the Museum last summer. There are
over sixty in the cast, and many of
these have more than just "atmos
pheric" parts.
Stanford's production of Shakes
peare's greatest tragedy is being
awaited with eager interest by people
on the peninsula, as well as by those
on the campus and in Palo Alto, judg
ing from the numerous requests which
have been received through the mail
for reservations.
The Saturday matinee will be held
especially for the benefit of the high
school students of the peninsula, and
practically every school in nearby
towns will be represented.
The settings for "Macbeth," as de
signed by Les Kiler, will be decidedly
impressionistic in execution, and will
be conceived mostly by means of
drapes. The new sky-cyclorama which
was purchased by the Dramatic Coun
cil, and first used in "You and I," will
aid materially in producing the many
varied effects which the action of the
play calls for. The forest scene will
be particularly impressive, and will be
the most intricate of all the sets to
construct.
The first chance for the campus to
purchase tickets will be on next Tues
day when the first general seat sale
will be held in the administration
building.
