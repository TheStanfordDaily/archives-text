# PROFESSOR DURAND TELLS HISTORY OF PAST ENGINEERING
## 
### 
"It would be impossible to fix any
exact date for the beginning of engi
neering, for it goes back through the
ages to the time when man first began
to put the materials of nature to work j
for him," said Professor W. F. Durand j
in his lecture on "The Engineering j
Profession, Its Antiquity and Obliga-1
tions," given in the Little Theatre yes
terday afternoon.
"The first piece of engineering done
was probably the crude plaiting to
gether of some twigs to form a mat
ting of some sort. The discovery of
the process of pottery-making, though
probably accidental, was also a great
engineering advance, as it filled a defi
nite need by use of the materials at
hand.
The bow and arrow, the sling shot,
the wheel and axle, and, greatest of
all, the mastery of fire, show that en
gineering talent was as productive and
effective in the early days of the
human race as it is now."
Professor Durand is president of the
American Society of Mechanical En
gineers and is the third Stanford pro- j
fessor to have the honor of presidency |
of the technical society representing '
his branch of engineering conferred
upon him. He has recently returned
from a trip in the East on which he
gave lectures on the work of his so- !
ciety.
He said further, "The great antiquity '
of the profession of engineering brings ;
with it great obligation. The engineers ;
are the connecting link between the j
civilization of the past and of the fu-'
ture. They must hand on what they |
have received in an improved and ex-1
panded form in order that the progress !
of the world go on."
