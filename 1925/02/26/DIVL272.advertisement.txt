Jumper Sport Frocks for Chic Co-Eds
Parisian designers have created enchanting two-picce sport frocks,
which we have copied in a delightful manner. Two are sketched
for you, each one a picture of youthful smartness.
$ 25
What a joyful task, selecting one or two for campus wear. Perhaps you will
choose a frock combining a knitted blouse with flannel skirt, or one of striped
silk, faille silk or jersey. Some employ gayly striped blouses with plain colored
skirts. A veritable garden of Spring's newest shades to choose fromâ€”Monterey,
gold, beige, penvder blue, artichoke, rust and rose.
