Gordon Davis has announced <$>
<$ there are several minor parts in <$'
<S> "Macbeth" which he has not yet <$>
<?> selected, and anyone interested is <?>
<$> requested to be at the Assembly <$>
hall tonight at 7 o'clock. Men only <$>
<§> are needed. <S>
<$> This will be an opportunity for <S>
<$> several men to become connected <$>
3> with the most ambitious tlieatri- <$>
<s> cal venture that Gordon Davis
<$' has yet attempted at Stanford, <$>
<$> and will be valuable training for <$>
<$> future productions. Because of the <$>
<$> fact that the cast was chosen <$>
<$> last quarter, several people had <$>
<$> to drop out on account of unfore- <$>
<?> seen circumstances, leaving this <$>
<S> chance for others to be in the <?>
<S> play. <$>
