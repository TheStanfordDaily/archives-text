The World Court will be the subject of
the open forum which will be conducted by
the local branch of the "League of Na

Two speakers have been obtained for
the forum. Professor Graham Henry

relations, will speak on the World Court.
Judge Jackson Harvey Ralston, at pres
ent a retired lawyer living in Palo Alto,

All students, faculty and campus resi
dents are urged to attend, in order that
any resolution arrived at may be consid
ered the consensus of university opinion,
in the first dispute ever submitted to the
Permanent' Court of Arbitration at the
Hague in 1899. Later he acted as arbi
trator for the Italian claims against Ven

This meeting is one of a number of
similar forums being sponsored through
out the country by the "American Peace
Award" in order to encourage discussion
on the World Court plan and thus in

mittee to act on the question before
March 4. Unless a bombardment of reso
lutions reaches the committee before that
date, action on the problem will probably
be deferred until the next session of Con
gress in November.
