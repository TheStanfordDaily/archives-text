# Y. W. C. A. Will Display Paris Styles Tomorrow
## 
### Ray Law 
The Stanford connoisseur has come
into his own! The last posie in his j
boquet of happiness has been handed
to him, and he rests content, as this
goes to press.
The Y. W. C. A., a long recognized
activity of Stanford women, has sud
denly proved itself to be a benefactor
to Bill Brogan, as well as to Rena
Roble. Without the necessity of spend
ing good time and money on a trip to
the nearby metropolis, a bona fide,
gilt-edge, guaranteed exhibition of
young American pulchritude, as well |
as late Paris styles, may be seen at
Le Maison Delta Gamma on Friday
afternoon at the nominal rate of fifty :
cents per pair of eyes.
If further proof be necessary that
the millenium has arrived, look over
this list of scintillating cloak models J

who will display garments secured
through the courtesy of the Gotham
Shop: Gertrude McLeod, Margaret
Harroun, Marietta Fry, Elizabeth Ren
ton, Allene Thorpe, Carol Chandler,
Betty Tuthill, Frances Pleasants,
Marion Nicholas, Helen Lewis, Ade
laide Kelley, Alfreda Poco Teague.
Although a pre-view of this feature
event of Y. W. week was manifestly
impossible, by a study of the dope
sheets and form charts it is not hard
to deduce that it will go down in
Stanford history as one of the greatest
triumphs of the Cardinal in recent
years. Never, not even for a Junior
Opera, has such an all-around galaxy
of stars, yea, even such a winning
team, been gathered together. In all
departments of the game the all-star
aggregation selected under the per
sonal auspices of the Y. W. C. A. bids
fair to walk off with All-Coast honors.
