# ALL-CALIFORNIA RUGBY SQUAD WILL PROBABLY MAKE AUSTRALIAN TRIP
## PLANS NOW BEING MADE All-Blacks Impressed With Campus, Stadium on Visit Tuesday 
### 
An All-California rugby team, made
up, as far as possible, from the mem-!
bers of the American Olympic team,
will tour New Zealand and New South
Wales, Australia, if present plans are
carried through.
The New Zealand and New South
Wales Rugby Associations are plan
ning to combine in bringing the Cali
fornia team to Australia during the
coming summer. In all probability, ac- j
cording to Harry Maloney, arrange-!
ments will be made to have the team
leave San Francisco immediately after
final examinations at Stanford.
S. S. Dean, president of the New
Zealand association, and manager of j
the All-Blacks, is especially desirous'
of completing arrangements for the;
trip. Maloney is already in touch with
the New South Wales officials.
Twenty-two members of the :All-,
Blacks were conducted about the cam-1
pus as guests of the Board of Athletic
Control during their stay here, while
the Stanford Club of San Francisco
acted as their hosts in bringing them I
down from the city in automobiles.
All of the men were impressed by j
the stadium, the athletic fields, and
the new dormitories. While here, they
were entertained at luncheon in the j
Union, whre Harry Maloney, as host,
made a speech of welcome and regret
that the All-Blacks were unable to j
play at Stanford.
C. E. O. Badeley, one of the stars of
the team, said, "Our main purpose in ,
coming to San Francisco was to play
an exhibition game at the Stanford
stadium. But we were very sorry that
all arrangements could not be made
for this because of the limited time of !
our stay before sailing for New Zea
land."
