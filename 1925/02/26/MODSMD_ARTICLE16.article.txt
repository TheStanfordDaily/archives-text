# OLYMPIC FLOES TAKE P.A.A. EVENTS
## Cardinal Swimmers Follow in Second Place With Five Counters 
### 
Repeating their performance made
in the first set of P. A. A. champion
ships, Olympic Club swimmers took
first place in every event in the races
last night at the Olympic Club pool.
Stanford men took two thirds and a
second in the 400-yard relay.
The open 100-yard event provided
the thrill of the evening when Smith,
Robertson, and Mooney, all Winged
"O" men, battled to an almost tie race.
The winner, after just touching Rob
ert son out, was clocked in 56 1-5.
Stanford's relay team had little dif
ficulty in forcing the Blue and Gold
team out of the running, though they
lacked the push to overtake the Olym
pic men. Results in this race mean a
nice boquet of five points for the
Cardinals when they meet the U. C.
swimming team in the annual dual
meet.
Schmeider showed ability of a high
order but set a poor pace in his 220
breast stroke, for had he held himself
down at the first he might have turned
in three or five points rather than one.
Dwyer captured the event quite han
dily, upsetting predictions by beating
out Peterson.
