One of the ways which has I>een adopted by the University of Arizona
to stimulate public opinion in favor of the new gymnasium which that
institution is promoting is to ask every student to describe the pressing
need to a friend. Now if you collegians will please drop your ukuleles for
a minute and come out of the vocal quartet we will present a suggestion
which might be called to the attention of every movie producer of your
acquaintance, as well as to the attention of every immigrant, yokel and
child, for whom the movies are alleged to be made.
The Daily would like to encourage the widespread opinion that col
lege students are not normally found all over the campus in impromptu
choral groups, nor are they all riding in high-powered roadsters with
lovely women when they are not either singing or giving the college yell,
nor are they all athletes or scholars, nor are they anything else which they
are usually represented on the screen as being.
Until today we suspected that all producers sent sons to colleges who
were too lazy to think up new excuses for extra funds. It is perfectly
possible that parents of many Stanfordites believe that all their children
do at the university is to buy books. Perhaps it all started when the first
movie producer's son wrote home for the seventh time within the month
for money to get a new musical instrument. We imagined that perhaps
father was only kidding his boy when he put out the popular type of col
lege cinema.
Today the proof came. The publicity agent for one of Hollywood's
most masterly makers of stupendous spectacles actually signed his name to
a jazz letter which offered to trade photographs of such "college" subjects
as the extra-girl's all star football team for a publicity puff about the
threatened serial which is guaranteed to contain all the sure-fire rah-rah
stuff and more.
These motion picture people take all this seriously. Such comedies as
this promises to be are not to be laughed at. The embarrassment threatens
to go on indefinitely. Our theory that it would stop when the producer's
son came home from college and made a clean breast of that ukulele mat
ter, is all wrong.
Something has to be done.

PRACTICALLY EVERY MEMBER of the 500 is connected with
the Y. W. C. A. drive for funds which started on the campus today. A
bridge party, fashion show and taxi service are on the program for the
two-day drive.
The Y. W. is a worth-while, recognized women's activity, which de
serves whatever support the men can give it. The women support men's
activities. Scalpers Society is setting the pace by corralling the roughs to
patronize the noon taxi service. The rest of us would do well to assist by
being corralled. C. C. S.

threatened serial which is guaranteed to contain all the sure-fire rah-rah
stuff and more.
These motion picture people take all this seriously. Such comedies as
this promises to be are not to be laughed at. The embarrassment threatens
to go on indefinitely. Our theory that it would stop when the producer's
son came home from college and made a clean breast of that ukulele mat
ter, is all wrong.
Something has to be done.

PRACTICALLY EVERY MEMBER of the 500 is connected with
the Y. W. C. A. drive for funds which started on the campus today. A
bridge party, fashion show and taxi service are on the program for the
two-day drive.
The Y. W. is a worth-while, recognized women's activity, which de
serves whatever support the men can give it. The women support men's
activities. Scalpers Society is setting the pace by corralling the roughs to
patronize the noon taxi service. The rest of us would do well to assist by
being corralled. C. C. S.
One of the ways which has I>een adopted by the University of Arizona
to stimulate public opinion in favor of the new gymnasium which that
institution is promoting is to ask every student to describe the pressing
need to a friend. Now if you collegians will please drop your ukuleles for
a minute and come out of the vocal quartet we will present a suggestion
which might be called to the attention of every movie producer of your
acquaintance, as well as to the attention of every immigrant, yokel and
child, for whom the movies are alleged to be made.
The Daily would like to encourage the widespread opinion that col
lege students are not normally found all over the campus in impromptu
choral groups, nor are they all riding in high-powered roadsters with
lovely women when they are not either singing or giving the college yell,
nor are they all athletes or scholars, nor are they anything else which they
are usually represented on the screen as being.
Until today we suspected that all producers sent sons to colleges who
were too lazy to think up new excuses for extra funds. It is perfectly
possible that parents of many Stanfordites believe that all their children
do at the university is to buy books. Perhaps it all started when the first
movie producer's son wrote home for the seventh time within the month
for money to get a new musical instrument. We imagined that perhaps
father was only kidding his boy when he put out the popular type of col
lege cinema.
Today the proof came. The publicity agent for one of Hollywood's
most masterly makers of stupendous spectacles actually signed his name to
a jazz letter which offered to trade photographs of such "college" subjects
as the extra-girl's all star football team for a publicity puff about the
threatened serial which is guaranteed to contain all the sure-fire rah-rah
stuff and more.
