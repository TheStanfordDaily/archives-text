Ph.D.'s, by Leonard Bacon—Harper
and Brothers.
Either this is a book of impressionistic
verse or it is quite bad. Bacon sings two
songs to the same tune: Sophia Trenton,
which was read as part of the 1920 exer
cises held by the Stanford chapter of Phi
Beta Kappa; and The Dunbar Tragedy,
which has not enjoyed any such distinc
tion.
Professors have obviously treated
Bacon in a shameful fashion—chiefly by
giving him A grades, I suspect. He con
sistently berates, with varying degrees of
fierceness, the academic tendency to em
phasize technique while ignoring poetic
beauty. He correctly charges scholars
with preserving the tin and tossing the
gold of poets when they work on such
theses as "Shelley's Knowledge of Geog
raphy."
And Bacon seems to speak with au
thority. His words arrange themselves
in academic order with such facility that
no one can suspect him of having insffi
cient knowledge of his topic. The style of
these poems has an almost perfect aca
demic atmosphere, whether purposely
created or not. What should be pointed
out is that tedium is the weakness of such
style in poets as in professors.
Several good cracks must be credited to
these versified lectures, however. It is
worth while reading the book to imagine
the effect these hot shots had on the 1920
chapter of Phi Beta Kappa at Stanford.
Mixing his punches by slipping in an oc
casional cheesy line among his rabid re

marks, Bacon must have given his au
dience of very cereberal purists a
wholly uncomfortable afternoon.
This book should be on every student's
desk. There is relief from the memory
of the lowest' grade within its covers.
The Daily copy has been offered to the
Library as a gift. —Hal Rorke.
