# Informal Soccer Team Defeats San Mateo 1-0
## 
### 
A team composed of men taking
soccer for gym credit defeated San
Mateo 1 to 0 in an informal game yes
terday afternoon on the soccer field.
Don Clark made the sole score of
the game against San Mateo. Both
teams showed poor teamwork due to
lack of practice. The Stanford players
were forced to rely on individual
brilliance to gain the victory. Good
work on the part of the goal guards
saved the Cards from being scored on
several times.
