"SANCHO PANZA," Columbia The
atre, San Francisco —Melchoir Leng
yel's "Sancho Panza" has been labelled
a fantastic comedy, some parts of it
seeming to have neither rhyme nor
reason, but it is well worth seeing in
that it serves its purpose as a satire,
and that the work of Otis Skinner is
extremely good.
It is indeed fantastic, in fact it is
so much so that one sits through the
prologue and the first act without quite
knowing what it is all about. The
orchestra further complicates matters
by rendering some of the lines in
audible.
Just as one's interest is about ex
hausted, the second act, which is quite
sane, comes along and saves the situa
tion. The theme, which comes to light
here, is taken from certain episodes in
Cervantes' "Don Quixote." It contains
some delightful comedy as well as
some attempts which are saved from
burlesque only by the clever acting of
Mr. Skinner, who dominates the whole
production, and is in large part re
sponsible for its success.
""Assisting Mr. Skinner, who plays
the part of Sancho Panza, goatherd of
Barataris, are Montague Rutherford,
as the Duke of Bavaria, and Robert
Rosaire, who conceals himself in the
hide of Dapple, Sancho's donkey. Both
of these men do some fine work, the
first in a serious, the second in a ridi
culous, role. —Charles Parks.
