# POTTER HIGH FAILS TO PLAY 1928 GAME
## 
### 
Because Potter high school's nine
failed to appear for its scheduled game
with the freshmen yesterday Hunt's
men were once more cheated out of
an opportunity to play against organ
ized competition. Last Saturday rain
prevented their contest with Oakland
Tech.
If the present good weather con
tinues the yearlings will have their
hands full during the next two weeks,
with games with high schools Wednes
day and Saturday and contests in the
interclass series either Tuesday or
Thursday.
