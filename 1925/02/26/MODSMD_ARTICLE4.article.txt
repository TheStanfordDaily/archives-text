# JOURNALISTS OBJECT AS CAMPUS POLICEMAN HANDS OUT NOTICES
## 
### 
j The space between the end of the
j carline and-the Press building nearly
; became tho scene of a riot yesterday
noon. It scorns that in this narrow
! space of a few yards there is a road.
And, what is more, this "would-be"
road is shut off from autoists looking
for short cuts, by a sign bearing, in
plain black and white, the single, em
phatic word, CLOSED. Certain mem
bers of the Daily staff, and other in
mates of the Press building, not being
able to find any other open country,
mistook this defunct road for a park
ing space. Unfortunately the campus
cop did not consider it as such. He
maintained that it is a road and con
sequently should not be obstructed,
even though it is marked closed. The'
result was that all those who were!
unable to tell the difference between 1
the center and the side of a street I
i
were given little yellow cards bearing
polite invitations to see the comptrol
ler at two dollars a chance.
