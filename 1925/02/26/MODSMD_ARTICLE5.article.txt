Last year's marathon was won eas
i ily by the seniors, who covered the six
| miles in 21:51 4-5 —an average time of
i :53.7 to the lap. Bill Storie, who can
not run this year because of ill health,
won the varsity medal with a fime of
j :49 1-5 seconds, while the best non
varsity record was :50 4-5.
Templeton had hoped to have an
Olympic Club team to run against his
class teams but Charlie Hunter is send
, ing down only one man, Myrra, world's
j champion javelin thrower from Fin
! land. He appeared on the campus in
! January in an exhibition, throwing the
spear 199 feet 1-2 inch. Saturday he
is bringing his own javelin, however,
and will attempt to break the existing
record in his event, 217 feet.
Of the other events arranged by
: Templeton, the annual Holdover Show
will be the first. It is written this year
by "Mike" Ely and, as usual, will
satirize some condition existing in the
j University. The newly-installed system
was the topic under discussion in last
year's show.
The marathon will follow the show.
Other events on the program will be
a 100-yard three-legged race, quarter-
I mile walk. 100-yard backward race,
| three standing jumps for distance, 100-
yard class race, and game cock chase.
The 100-yard class race is an innova
tion this year, consisting of 12 men
from each class*tightly tied together
in a circle, who will attempt to nego
, tiate the century.
Six roosters have been procured by
Track Manager William Wright for the
game cock chase, and the men catch
ing them will be given the roosters.
Prizes for the other events have been
donated by Roos Brothers.

i Club's annual offering to the campus,
