# MACBETH PROGRAMS TO BE ELABORATE IN DESIGN AND COLOR
## 
### 
The English Club, which is present
ing "Macbeth" in the auditorium on
March 6 and 7, has decided upon a
new style of programs for the drama.
The club has always endeavored to
have attractive programs, but never
before has so much time and money
been spent on them.
The programs will be a twelve-page
affair and will be colored in four
shades. The lettering will be illumi
nated in three colors, with the fourth
shade used as a background.
Each page will contain an ink sketch
of some scene from the play. The out
standing scenes from the drama will
be chosen for this purpose.
The cover of the program will be
light in color, and will be decorated
with the figure of Macbeth.
All the art work is being done by
Delmer Daves, who is also taking the
lead in the play as Macbeth. Daves has
drawn most of the advertisements
used for campus productions in the
last year.
The programs have already been
started and will be completed the first
part of next week. A sample of the
work will be exhibited on the Quad
soon.
As "Macbeth" is the first Shakes
pearian play to be produced at Stan
ford for a great many years, the whole
drama department is working in an
effort to make it a success. The stage
settings, the programs, and the re
hearsals are all progressing rapidly as
the time for the first dress rehearsal
