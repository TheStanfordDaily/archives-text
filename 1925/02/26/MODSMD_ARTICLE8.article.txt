# Dr. Taylor Publishes Article on Muscle Shoals
## 
### 
Dr. Alonzo E. Taylor, director of the
Food Research Institute, published in
last week's issue of the Saturday Eve
ning Post an article, "Nitrogen for
Agriculture."
He discusses the possibility of using
the electric power of Muscle Shoals for
the fixation of atmospheric nitrogen,
a proposal which has been under con
sideration for several years. The prac
ticability of such an enterprise depends
on the ability to obtain nitrogenous
fertilizer from atmospheric nitrogen
at a reasonable cost.
In the article Dr. Taylor summarized
the methods of obtaining various fer
tilizers and the need for their in
creased use in the United States to
insure progress in agriculture.
