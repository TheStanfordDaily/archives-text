# VARIETY IN GLEE CLUB PROGRAM
## 
### 
Nearly five months of drill and re
hearsal will culminate in the Glee Club's
annual home concert in the Assembly Hall
at 8:15 tomorrow evening. The Redwood >
City recital last week showed that the .
singers had mastered even the most exact-1
ing numbers of their repertoire, and only
needed some final touches from the di- j
rector, Warren D. Allen, before their j
presentation.
Assisting the club and also appearing in ;
solo groups is the Wind Instrument En
semble of San Francisco, whose services
the Glee Club has been fortunate enough
to secure. Its appearance Friday will be 1
the second since its formation a short j
time ago, the first having been at a re-;
cital in the Fairmont hotel on February 13.
Music of all schools, classical, romantic,
and modern, will be presented in a pro
gram much more ambitious than the kind I
usually attempted by college glee clubs. I
Almost every type of song: the religious,
satirical, humorous, romantic, will help
make a well balanced and varied whole.
"Matona, Lively Maiden," by Orlando j
di Lasso is of an entirely different nature, j
In it, the lover, singing his serenade is re- j
warded only by catching a cold which j
punctuates the bell-like melody of the j
song with sneezes.
Perhaps the favorite number with the |
singers is Saint Saens' "Salterelle" full
of vigor and an almost irresistible jollity.
"Music When Soft Voices Die" is a num
ber of great appeal, due to its subdued, al
most whispered, harmony. â€¢
Some songs o fa lighter nature have
been prepared for encores that are sure
to prove popular because of their snap and
humor.
Tickets may be obtained at the Admin
istration Building for 75 cents and $1.
The concert will be followed by a dance
in the Women's Clubhouse for which a
closed date has been secured.
