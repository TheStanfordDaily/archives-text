# WIND INSTRUMENT GROUP, GLEE CLUB COMBINE TO GIVE CONCERT TONIGHT
## Accompaniment of Singers by Ensemble Will Be Striking Feature 
### Herbert Klein 
A unique and novel combination of
musical instruments, with great pos
sibilities in tonal effects and contrasts
will be offered by the newly-organized
Woodwind Ensemble of San Francisco,
guest artists at the Glee Club's Annual
Home Concert at 8:15 tonight in the
Assembly hall.
The flute and clarinet are known
by almost every one but it is seldom
that the oboe, basson, and horn, com
prising the rest of the five instruments
of the group, are heard outside of a
symphony orchestra. The plaintive
toned oboe, known as one of the most
poetic of instruments, is in the hands
of the leader, C. Addimando, whom
many will remember as the solo oboist
of the San Francisco Symphony in its
first concert here this quarter.
The basson has a smooth liquid
quality to its music. Berlioz, one of
the leaders in modern orchestration,
called it "the clown of the orchestra."
Because it is capable of so many agile
.stunts and humorous effects, it is often
used for musical "comic relief."
Ensemble Pleases Critics
Charles E. Tryner, French horn, is
remembered at Stanford for his beauti

torio presented here a year ago. Miss
Isabelle Arudt, playing the piano ac
companiment, is the last member of
this novel group which has no counter
parts in the entire country west of
Chicago. Critics who heard their ini
tial recital at the Fairmont hotel on
February 13 declared their work to
be of a quality comparable only to |
that of the very noted Barrere Ensem- j
