# WIND INSTRUMENT GROUP, GLEE CLUB COMBINE TO GIVE CONCERT TONIGHT
## Accompaniment of Singers by Ensemble Will Be Striking Feature 
### Herbert Klein 
A unique and novel combination of
musical instruments, with great pos
sibilities in tonal effects and contrasts
will be offered by the newly-organized
Woodwind Ensemble of San Francisco,
guest artists at the Glee Club's Annual
Home Concert at 8:15 tonight in the
Assembly hall.
The flute and clarinet are known
by almost every one but it is seldom
that the oboe, basson, and horn, com
prising the rest of the five instruments
of the group, are heard outside of a
symphony orchestra. The plaintive
toned oboe, known as one of the most
poetic of instruments, is in the hands
of the leader, C. Addimando, whom
many will remember as the solo oboist
of the San Francisco Symphony in its
first concert here this quarter.
The basson has a smooth liquid
quality to its music. Berlioz, one of
the leaders in modern orchestration,
called it "the clown of the orchestra."
Because it is capable of so many agile
.stunts and humorous effects, it is often
used for musical "comic relief."
Ensemble Pleases Critics
Charles E. Tryner, French horn, is
remembered at Stanford for his beauti
ful work in the Bach Christmas Ora
torio presented here a year ago. Miss
Isabelle Arudt, playing the piano ac
companiment, is the last member of
this novel group which has no counter
parts in the entire country west of
Chicago. Critics who heard their ini
tial recital at the Fairmont hotel on
February 13 declared their work to
be of a quality comparable only to |
that of the very noted Barrere Ensem- j
ble of New York City.
The numbers played by the ensem
ble tonight will be selected from those
they played at their first appearance.
In addition the final group of numbers
on the program are to be sung by the
entire glee club of fifty voices with the
Ensemble playing accompaniments es
pecially arranged by Warren D. Allen,
the director. This group consists of
an old choral, "Now Let Every Tongue
Adore Thee," by J. S. Bach, and a song
in Oriental mood, Cesar Franck's
"Chorus of the Camel Drivers."
Club Sings in Redwood
The club appeared at Redwood City
last Friday night and gave the same
program that it will give tonight.
Charles Stratton, baritone soloist, was
very effective in some difficult num
bers, especially Sanderson's "Ship
mates o' Mine," which he will sing
tonight among others.
The Glee Club has never before at
tempted so ambitious a program which
includes bringing to the campus from
the outside professional artists. Pre
paration has been going on since the

first of the autumn quarter to make
this the most notable Home Concert
yet given. Seats are to be had at the
Administration building at prices of
seventy-five cents and one dollar.
