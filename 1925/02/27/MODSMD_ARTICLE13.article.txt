# YEARLING BALL NINE OPPOSES ALAMEDA PLAYERS TOMORROW
## 
### 
Coach "Husky" Hunt's freshman
! baseball nine will endeavor to make
j it four straight against Alameda high
| school at 10 o'clock tomorrow morning
on the freshman diamond. Unless un
foreseen circumstances prevent, they
should succeed.
A pick-up team from Palo Alto, St.
Ignatius high, and San Mateo high
have all contributed to the babes'
string of victories. Although it might
be said that they made their poorest
showing of the year yesterday against
the sophomore interclass nine, Hunt's
men were working without the aid of
their first-string pitcher, Philippi.
Philippi Will Pitch
He will be in the box tomorrow and
unless he makes a much poorer show
ing than in previous games, he may be
counted upon to strike out ten or
twelve men. Philippi does not rely
solely upon one style of delivery, but
mixes up his offerings enough to keep
the batters guessing. Sobieski, the
other regular pitcher, will be given a
rest Saturday as he pitched most of
the interclass game yesterday. Hunt's
need for a third moundsman seems to
be filled by "Mike" Reynolds of the
basketball squad. Though lacking in
experience, Reynolds has a world of
speed and fair control. If he can main
tain for a full game the pace he went
in the last two innings against the
sophomores the freshmen will have a
nearly invincible pitching staff.
Sypher appears to have the catcher's
job cinched permanently. He has
plenty of fight, a good peg, and he
always gets at least one hit per game,
often three. Maguire, the outfielder
who was recently shifted to first base,
is getting accustomed to his new posi
tion fast. Buscli and Adams are putting
up a hot fight for second. At present
the former has a slight edge because J
of his superior hitting ability.
Biaggini Outfield Prospect
On third, Price and Snyde have been
alternating. Price is a little the
steadier of the two. Garibaldi at short |
completes a fast infield. He is one of J
the mainstays of the team in the field i
and at bat, and has earned an undis-!
puted right to his job. Hunt has an,
abundance of outfielders to choose
from in Nissen, Weaver, Sims, Hill,
and Biaggini. The first three have done
most of the work so far. Biaggini is
another basketball player who has
been out for practice the last couple;
of days and he will probably get a
chance to show what he can do tomor
row. He has a tremendous peg and
covers a lot of territory.
