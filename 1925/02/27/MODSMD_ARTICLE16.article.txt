# VARSITY TO MEET HEAR BASKETBALL TEAM TOMORROW NIGHT IN OAKLAND
## Coach Kerr Will Probably Shift Lineup in Fourth Contest of Series 
### David Meikleiohn 
As a result of the speed shown by
5 five sophomores on the Stanford squad
1 last Saturday night against California,
• Andy Kerr is thinking seriously of a
radical change in line-up to be used
■ against the Bears in the Oakland Audi
• torium tomorrow in the final and de
" j ciding game.
California using speed, met speed in
return, and the result was to put the
j team on a par, with the Cards holding
i an edge in basket-shooting ability.
| California easily holds the odds in
| the situation and if the Cardinal five
jis not careful the Bear will bounce into
a Pacific Coast Conference champion*
j ship race without any fifth game.
Close Games
The game Saturday should bring out
: the best that is in each team, and botli
have been playing fair basketball
j throughout this season. Each game has
[been close to the extreme; to such a
! point that to pick the really best squad
in each instance would be a difficult
matter.
Kerr was working last night on sev
eral speedy formations to make use
of his two sophomore forwards, David
and Price, to better advantage, and
also to work in Nevers more with
! either of the two. Nevers, despite the
I criticism to the contrary, is actually
! the best player on the Stanford team.
!He is more useful in passing forma
tions than any of the other men; he
' keeps his teammates "set" in a diffi
, cult situation, and is altogether a good
! basketball player. Of late he has not
been doing so well shooting baskets,
: but while the California guards are
watching for Nevers to break through
and score, one of the other Stanford
forwards gets a shot at the basket,
which, if it works, is all to the good.

Ladar Valuable
The loss of Sammy Ladar is going to
I do a great deal toward tippling Cali
j fornia's chances in the final game.
Ladar was always a certainty for a
j flock of points, although most of them
came through personal fouls. Ladar
j was also a valuable man on the de
fense, and understood Price's style of
I play better, probably, than any other
| man on the squad.
Individual work by the California
j men is what is going more to help the
Bears over the high places than any
thing else. Belasco, for example, plays
1 practically a lone game, shooting at
! the goal whenever it is conveniently
! close, and that means from anywhere
on the court. That is why the Bears
have such difficulty, at times, in get
ting the ball through the Card defense
after a technical foul. Stanford in
variably takes the ball away from a
California passing formation, and the
Bruin forwards are forced to depend
more on dribbling and a chance op
portunity to get another man under
the basket for a pass, before there is
really any serious attempt to score by
way of co-operation from every mem
ber of the squad.
Cards Need Individuality
Stanford, on the other hand, needs
a little more individual play. Time and
again a Cardinal player will sacrifice
a good open shot at the basket in
order to work the ball in closer to a
man underneath the goal, for a set-up
shot. It is good tactics, but the chances
are ten to one that the other man will
get to try his set-up shot without an
opposing guard holding on long enough
to make it a personal or held ball.
Harry Shipkey is one member of the
Stanford team that believes in indis
criminate attempts at the baskets, and
some of his tries usually register for
a basket.
