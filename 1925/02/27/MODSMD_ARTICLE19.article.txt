# Boo!
## 
### 
Tomorrow night the varsity evens up with the California basketball
team. With the sophomore players setting the pace, the squad has pulled
out of the slump. Practice has snapped up and, what is more to the point,
the plays have been resulting in scores. The Cardinal eye is found.
There is no use in booming for support at the Oakland game. Every
one is going anyway. And there is no use in urging inspired yelling. We
don't see how it could be stopped.
What is important is to have consideration for the Golden Bear if it
dies hard. At the last freshman game, the first-year rooters forgot them
selves and emitted large and unmistakable BOOs. To the high school per
son it may seem to help the cause—this 800 stuff. The Golden Bear
thrives on "BOO."
It is ungentlemanly to yell this. It is not playing the game. It is, fur
thermore, an insane way of trying to help. The stupid boo-ers always
hurt whatever they root for. If one can't remember his manners in the
bleachers, he should be called to his senses, at least.
We are all one big family, as you know. Might we suggest that if any
erring brother forgets himself within range of one who is either well
mannered, intelligent or both, that the booing rooter receive a hinting
kick on the shin. If that doesn't help, follow with one in the teeth.
Of course we'll win the game. Let's have an untarnished victory.
