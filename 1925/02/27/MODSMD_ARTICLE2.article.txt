# 1927 HOLDS ENCINA NINE TO TIE SCORE IN INTERCLASS GAME
## 
### 
Sophomore and freshman baseball
teams battled to a 3 to 3 tie yesterday
in an interclass game that went three
extra innings. Coach Hunt stopped the
contest originally scheduled to go six
innings at the end of the ninth in order
that his men might not go stale before
the game with Alameda high Saturday.

Accorded only a slim chance for vic
tory by close followers of the game,
the sophomores, playing together for
the first time, put up a surprisingly
strong fight against the regular fresh
man team which has won all its con
tests with high school squads. 1927 got
but one hit, a single by Stevenson, to
six for the yearlings, but played a
steadier game in the field.

The first two freshman batters who;
came to bat in the opening inning col-j
lected hits, one scoring, and it looked !
as though the contest was going to be '
a slaughter for 1928. Then Murray, the i
sophomore chucker, tightened up and I
retired the side. Though he allowed !
more hits than Sobieski, the freshman |
pitcher, he kept them well scattered j
and showed good control, walking but;
one man to Sobieski's five. Murray re
ceived better support from his fielders,
Stevenson, Sheets, Blazier, and South
worth, cutting off several runs with
nice catches. "Mike" Reynolds, erst
while basketball player, relieved So
bieski in the eighth and pitched good
ball. j
