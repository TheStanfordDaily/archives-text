Two students from the same class spent last Sunday afternoon on the
lake. The next day in a mid-quarter examination one of them wrote an
excellent paper and the other failed rather miserably. It was not the case
of high against average intelligence, but rather of preparedness against
unpreparedness.
The first student had taken the one book on reserve for the class from
the library at 5 o'clock Saturday, and had kept it out until the last moment
at 9 o'clock Monday morning. The second student had gone to the library
on Sunday afternoon prepared to spend his time studying, but found the
book gone, with no possibility of his reading it in time.
Other members of the class had read the same book on week-days at
the library, or had used it at home from 10 o'clock at night until 9 the
following morning.
There is no reason why the student signing for the book on Saturday
afternoon should not have the advantage of the extra hours between that
time and 2 o'clock Sunday, but it is unnecessary for him to use it as room
decoration while the other man fumes and flunks helplessly.
