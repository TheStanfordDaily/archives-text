# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT

The Editor, Sir:
Despite the suggestions of the En
cina sponsors and the officers of the
freshman class there are still very few
dinks being worn this quarter. We
frosh are supposed to wear dinks and,
while they are not beautiful, they are
at any rate something that prevents us
from being mistaken for sophomores!
However, there are at the present
time about fifty frosh wearing dinks,
enough so that these few loyal wearers
feel conspicuous instead of comfort
able. Let's get together and either
wear 'em or discard 'em. â€”Dink '28.
