"SO THIS IS LONDON," Alcazar
Theatre, San Francisco —
It was a felicitous comedy scheme
George M. Cohan struck upon for his
"So This Is London," now playing at
the Alcazar Theatre in San Francisco,
when he chose to bring the barbarous
gum-chewing American, as represented
in "Punch," and the haw-ing English
man, as caricatured in the United
States, together.
Colonel Hiram Draper, "the Ford of
the American shoe industry," with a
fine contempt for the English and
their business methods, comes to Lon
don with his wife and son to buy out
his English competitor. Eleanor (pro
nounced El-ey-anor) Beauchamp, who
has been visiting America under the
chaperonage of Lady Ducksworth, re
turns on the same boat. Eleanor and
Hiram Jr. are both struck with the
same idea, namely that the other is
the "most adorable" creature. It then
becomes Lady Ducksworth's task to
reconcile the respective parents to the
prospect of a transatlantic in-law. Sir
Percy Beauchamp turns out to be
Colonel Draper's competitor, the two
manage to hit it off, and Eleanor and
"Junior" live, we trust happily, ever
after.
Miss Ruth Hammond as Eleanor and
Ralph Murphy as "Junior" do very
good work as the love-sick pair. One
almost expects them to moo at any
moment. Miss Dale Winter in the role
of Lady Ducksworth very nearly car
ries off the play with her charming
presence and refreshing enunciation.
Henry Duffy as Sir Percy Beauchamp
errs at times by making burlesque of
what should be comedy, but Maurice
Franklin in the role of Hiram Sr., is I
the stage-typical hard-headed captain
of Industry.
Altogether it is a very profitable and
entertaining two hours and a half.
