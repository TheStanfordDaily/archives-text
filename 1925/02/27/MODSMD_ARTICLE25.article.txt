# LEMOS DRAWS COVER FOR NEXT CHAPARRAL
## 
### Dave Lainson 
Nicely dressed in a Pedro J. Lemos
cover, the Faculty Number of Chapar
ral, prepared by men and women of
the University teaching staff, will go
on sale on Quad early next week.
In offering the Lemos print for a
cover design, Chappie is leaving tradi
tion utterly in the lurch. The design,
a view of the New Union at night, was
done especially for the Faculty Num
ber by Lemos, and is quite serious in
tone. No written matter appears on or
near the design, leaving it available
and suitable for framing.
Under the editorship of Dr. Henry
David Gray, the faculty has prepared
a number declared to be the equal of
any comic in the country, while many
of the features it contains are superior
to anything student jokesmiths have
been able to offer. Faculty members
have taken a flattering interest in the
preparation of the number, and turned
in a wide selection of art and literary
material.
