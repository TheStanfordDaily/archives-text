At the regular semi-monthly meeting of
the Women's Athletic Association it was
decided that there would be no intercol
legiate competition in women's athletics
this year.
After some discussion the association
went on record as opposing the triangular
interclass Play Day suggested by Mills
and the women of the University of Cali
fornia at the last triangular conference.
This decision was made because of the
shortness of time left to prepare for such
an event this quarter.
Sweater awards will be made at the end
of each quarter instead of at the field day
in the Spring Quarter as was formerly
the case. This will entitle the women
having a sufficient number of points to
become members of the association as soon
as they are eligible.
