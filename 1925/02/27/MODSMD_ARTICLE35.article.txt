## 
### 
Matches in the doubles tennis tour
nament have reached the third round.
At the present time Davidson and Mc-
Cleave shape up as the best prospects
in the upper half of the draw, while
the freshmen, Herrington and Thomas,
are likely-looking in the lower half.
C. W. Davis, director of intramural
athletics, urges that all matches be
played off at the earliest possible date
because of the short time remaining in
the present quarter.

iin the university will demonstrate
' their wares. One of the features of the
j exposition will be the celebration of
