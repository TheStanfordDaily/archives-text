# Meeting of Bahai Society Discusses Unity of Mankind
## 
### 
"The Oneness of Mankind" was the
topic for discussion at the regular
meeting of the Bahai society last night
in the Women's Clubhouse. The unity
of the world of mankind because of
the relation existing between the races
of the earth was the chief point
brought out in the discussion. The fact
that we imagine ourselves to be right,
and everybody else to be wrong is the
greatest of all obstacles in the path
toward unity.

The young English lawyer is inferior
to the American in education, accord
ing to Professor E. R. Sunderland of
the Law School of the University of
Michigan who recently returned from
England.
