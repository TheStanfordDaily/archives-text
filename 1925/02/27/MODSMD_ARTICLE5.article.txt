# FINAL WINTER GRID WORK HELD TODAY
## 
### 
Final workout of the winter football
| period is being held today on the
j varsity field under the direction of
i j Line Coach "Tiny" Thornhill. The can
â–  didates will be put through a scrim
mage which "Tiny" has promised will
be the hardest of the training period,
j The winter grid practice, an innova
; tinn at Stanford this year, has been

fully as successful as was hoped by the
coaching staff. Approximately 50 men
registered for the training, and an
average attendance of 35 to 40 men
has been maintained.
The first practice was held Monday,
February 2, but only two weeks' work
has been done since then, as heavy
rains have made practice impossible
at times.
Coach Thornhill has been in charge
of the training, handling both linemen
and backs most of the time, as Andy
Kerr, back field coach, is busy with var
sity backetball and has been able to
assist only slightly with the coaching
of the ball-packers.
Head Coach "Pop" Warner is now
in the East, and has not been directly
connected with the winter training.
"Pop" will be in charge at spring prac
tice to be held in April and May.
The success of the experiment this
year has encouraged the coaching staff
to the extent that the plan will be con
tinued next year, and more emphasis
placed upon the value of the work, it
was stated yesterday by Thornhill.
