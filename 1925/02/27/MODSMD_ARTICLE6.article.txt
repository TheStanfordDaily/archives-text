able pitchers, Oviatt and Collins. Both
of these men were used Wednesday.
Oviatt started the game and pitched
good ball until the sixth inning, when
he weakened and was relieved by Col

four innings. It is probable that both
of these men will be used tomorrow,
with Collins probably as Wolter's
starting choice.
Solomon Improving
Solomon, a former pitcher, has im
proved rapidly behind the plate, and'
will start as catcher. "Solly" played a
good game Wednesday. Jim Lawson, a

Captain "Chuck" Johnston, first
baseman, upheld his heavy hitting rec
ord Wednesday when he got a home
run in the eighth inning, scoring j

second, with Mulchay, shortstop, and i
Cuddeback, third baseman, completing j
the infield lineup.
In the outfield Dave Brown, Jerry
Stewart, and Bus McCandless will|
start. These men are good fielders and
heavy hitters.
For the visitors, O'Brien and Ran
dazzo are expected to do the heavy
stick work, while Campisi, regular
pitcher, is especially steady in the j
pinches.
Santa Clara is a slight favorite to j
take the game and series because of
its win in the initial contest, but the j
Stanford men are conceded a good,
chance of tying up the series tomor- j
row.
