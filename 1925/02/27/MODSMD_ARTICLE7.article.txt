# FORUM APPROVES OF WORLD COURT PLAN
## 
### 
The World Court forum, conducted
last night by the local branch of the
League of Nations Non-Partisan Asso
ciation, passed the following resolu
tion by an unanimous vote:
"Whereas, we believe the United
States should clearly make up its mind
whether it desires to participate in the
World Court, and thus join the other
great nations of the world in an at
tempt to substitute Law and the prin
ciple of Arbirtration for War as a
method for settling international dis
putes ;
"Be It Resolved, That a meeting of
the citizens of Stanford University
representing the League of Nations
Non-Partisan Association, and attend
ed by thirty persons, urges the Foreign
Relations Committee of the Senate of
the United States to report a resolu
tion providing for the participation of
the United States in the World Court
on the Harding-Hughes terms, in order
that it may be voted upon by the
whole Senate."
Judge Jackson Harvey Ralston spoke
in favor of the World Court, stating
that "the world is pointed to the time
when all disputes will be decided by
arbitration. Commencing with a few
scattered agreements for the settle
ment of problems by judication, in the
time of Henry IV or France, followed
by the Jay agreement and the two
hundred or more disputes settled by
arbitration before the Versailles treaty
was signed, the tendency toward the
judicial settlement of international dis
putes is constantly growing."
Professor Graham Henry Stuart, in
the other formal talk of the evening,
stated that since the United States is
now represented in most of the activi
ties of the league, it is only a matter
of time before the former ultimately
joins both the League and the Court.
This meeting was promoted by the
American Peace Award, which is con
ducting similar forums throughout the
country at this time in order that the
World Court resolution be voted upon
by the full Senate before the present
Congress goes out of office in March.
