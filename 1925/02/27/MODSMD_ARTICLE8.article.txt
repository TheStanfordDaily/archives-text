# THREE TITLES OPEN IN ANNUAL IRISH MARATHON
## FINN TO THROW SPEAR Sophomores, Juniors to Put Forward Strong Teams; Varied Program 
### 
1924 champions will not be
present to defend their titles tomor
j row when Quadrangle club holds its
| annual Irish Marathon on the old track
jat 1:30 p.m.
The three are: The class of 1924,
which annexed first place last year in
the six-mile run —the Irish Marathon;
i Storie, holder of the best varsity time,
! and Tarleton, who made the best non
! varsity time.
Present indications point to a close
| race between the junior and sopho
more teams for first honors in the
i Marathon. Both have been handicapped
jby the loss of fast men, such as Hy
land, Cypher, and Boles of the junior
team and Babcock of the sophomores,
but on the other hand both have a
formidable array of veterans.
Many Veterans
Of the class of 1926, Richardson,
Miller, Kerr, Clifford, Gaspar, Frye,
and Wells should turn in the best
times. Against them will be a long list
of point-getters in the California fresh
man meet last year, including West,
Adams, Garthwaite, Doerr, Cummings,
Meeks, Work, and McDougall.
As usual, the freshman squad is of
an unknown quality but it is possible!
that a number of fast laps may be
turned in by the babes. If this is done,
they will make a strong bid for sec
ond place. In any event, they will have j
a strong hold on third position since
Hugo Leistner, senior captain, has had I
difficulty in even making up a com-1
plete squad of twenty-four, giving the
seniors a strong chance to annex fourth
and last place.
Myrra on Exhibition
In addition to the varied program
which "Dink" Templeton has arranged 1
to accompany the Marathon, Charlie!
! Hunter, Winged "O" coach, is send
ing Myrra, Finnish javeiin star, down
for an exhibition. Myrra has visited
the campus before for the same pur
pose but tomorrow he will attempt in
his exhibition to break the existing l
world's javelin record of 217 feet. His ]
throw on liis first' visit here was 199
feet 1-2 inch.
As is customary, ten points will be !
counted for the class taking first place I
in the Marathon, the points to be ap
plied on its score in the interclass,
meet on Saturday, March 7.
