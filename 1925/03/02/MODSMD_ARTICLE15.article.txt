# GLEE CLUB PLEASES WITH CLASSIC SONG AT ANNUAL RECITAL
## 
### Herbert Klein 
Classic music instead of the lighter
selections usually given by college glee
clubs made up the program with which
the Stanford Glee Club delighted its
audience in the Assembly hall Friday
night. Sharing honors was the Wind
Instrument Ensemble of San Francisco
led by C. Addimando, oboeist.
Especially pleasing to the audience
was the last of the ensemble's solo
numbers, "Tarantella," by Fuhrmeis
ter. Its first number was a "Suite" by
Charles Lefebvre, which gave an op
portunity to show some interesting ef
fects, especially in the finale move
ment, with a queer little tune played
over and over by the mournful-sound
ing bassoon. "Salterelle" by Saint-
Saens was one of the most varied and
gripping songs on the entire program.
It was an invitation to be "up and
away" for a night of pleasure. After
a minor strain, came the wild music
of the carnival and finally the mourn
ful chant descriptive of the procession
of monks the next day. Words and
music together ran the whole gamut
without, interrupting the continuity of
the song.
Charles Stratton displayed his ex
cellent baritone voice in a solo, "Ship
mates," and encored with the old
Welsh song, "All Through the Night."
A lament for the passing of the In
dian race, "The Moon Drops Low," by
Charles Wakefield Cadman with a very
artistic accompaniment played by Wal
lace Rolls was sung by the club.
Following this came the enchanting
"Music, When Soft Voices Die," which
for sheer beauty had no rival on the
program except perhaps in "Adoramus
Te." As a striking contrast to its slow
and quiet dreaminess came the boister
ous "Plainsman's Song" by Bliss. A
baritone chorus of four voices sup
ported by the rest of the club sang
this, and carried a thrill and swing
greater than in any other songs.
The Woodwind Ensemble played the
first group to introduce its own pe
culiar, intriguing style of music. Be
sides the Suite it played "Divertis
sment" by Albert Roussel with piano
accompaniment. The accompanist,
Miss Isabelle Arndt, was very success
ful in subordinating the piano to the
instruments so that it reinforced but
did not dominate them. Enough cannot
be said for the work of the French
horn in the hands of C. E. Tryner, es
pecially in the Scherzando movement
of the Suite.
