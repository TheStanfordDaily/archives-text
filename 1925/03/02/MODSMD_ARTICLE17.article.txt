# CALIFORNIA TAKES FINAL BASKETBALL TILT FROM CARDS
## Bears Overcome Stanford Lead in Last Minutes To Win 17 to 16 
### Dudley Ross 
Overcoming a four-point lead in the
latter part of the second half, the Bear
basketball team took the deciding
game of the series from Stanford 17
to 16 at the Oakland Auditorium Sat
urday night and won the right to meet
the northern section winner for the
Coast title.
After trailing 10 to 6 at half time,
the Cardinal squad spurted in the sec
ond period to secure the lead over the
Bears. Nevers opened the scoring with
a pair of field goals, while David added
two more points on free throws after
a foul by Holmes.
California came out of its slump
when Jorgenson, at forward, scored
two goals on follow-up shots. Free
throws tied the score at fourteen all,
a couple of minutes before the final
gun. A long shot by Belasco and a foul
goal by Watson gave the Bears seven
teen points. Price was substituted and
made a pretty shot from close to the
center of the floor to cut down Cali
fornia's lead. But the gun ended Stan
ford's rally.
In the first half the Cardinal squad
was not able to get going. Coach Price
started his second string men and sent
in the regulars after the substitutes
had played the Cardinals about even.
Higgins and Jorgenson added scores
to the Bear total, while Stanford was
scoring only on free throws.
Stanford's attack with the lighter
combination working gave them an
edge over the Bruins until the last
couple of minutes of the game. David
and Nevers, with Jayred, formed a
hard combination to combat and gave
the Cardinal a two-basket lead.
The better co-ordination of the Cali
fornia offense in the first half kept
the ball toward the Stanford goal, but
class of 1924 made last year as Mrra
thon champions.
Issel, '28, wou the backward 100-yard
race with a time of :16. He established
a good lead at the first and finished
fifteen yards ahead of A1 Smith. Mc-
Clellan was third.
Harvey, '27, took first honors in the
standing three jumps, with three leaps
totaling 28 feet 5 inches. Bradley and
Arthur finished second and htird re
spectively.
Another innovation was a twelve
man team race. All twelve were tightly
tied together in a circle and the four
teams attempted to negotiate the cen
tury. Only the juniors finished without
falling. They took first place while the
sophomores took second when the 1928
team fell two yards from the finish.
Heston, '26, and Nichols, '28, won
the 100-vard three-legged race in
:14 1-5 with the Murphy-Gaspar team
a close second.
Issell took another first place in the
quarter-mile walk when Ilumphery, '26,
who finished first, was disqualified for
running. The time was 1:50.

Missouri Valley had a singing contest

throws tied the score at fourteen all,
a couple of minutes before the final

fornia's lead. But the gun ended Stan
