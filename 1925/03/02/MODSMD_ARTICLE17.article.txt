# CALIFORNIA TAKES FINAL BASKETBALL TILT FROM CARDS
## Bears Overcome Stanford Lead in Last Minutes To Win 17 to 16 
### Dudley Ross 
Overcoming a four-point lead in the
latter part of the second half, the Bear
basketball team took the deciding
game of the series from Stanford 17
to 16 at the Oakland Auditorium Sat
urday night and won the right to meet
the northern section winner for the
Coast title.
After trailing 10 to 6 at half time,
the Cardinal squad spurted in the sec
ond period to secure the lead over the
Bears. Nevers opened the scoring with
a pair of field goals, while David added
two more points on free throws after
a foul by Holmes.
California came out of its slump
when Jorgenson, at forward, scored
two goals on follow-up shots. Free
throws tied the score at fourteen all,
a couple of minutes before the final
gun. A long shot by Belasco and a foul
goal by Watson gave the Bears seven
teen points. Price was substituted and
made a pretty shot from close to the
center of the floor to cut down Cali
fornia's lead. But the gun ended Stan
ford's rally.
In the first half the Cardinal squad
was not able to get going. Coach Price
started his second string men and sent
in the regulars after the substitutes
had played the Cardinals about even.
Higgins and Jorgenson added scores
to the Bear total, while Stanford was
scoring only on free throws.
Stanford's attack with the lighter
combination working gave them an
edge over the Bruins until the last
couple of minutes of the game. David
and Nevers, with Jayred, formed a
hard combination to combat and gave
the Cardinal a two-basket lead.
The better co-ordination of the Cali
fornia offense in the first half kept
the ball toward the Stanford goal, but
