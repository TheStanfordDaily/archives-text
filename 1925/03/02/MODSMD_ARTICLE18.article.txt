# REDSHIRT YEARLING NINE HANDS ALAMEDA SCHOOL 3-1 DEFEAT
## 
### 
Playing the steadiest ball they have
I shown this season, Stanford's fresh
man nine downed Alameda high school
by a 3 to 1 score Saturday on the
freshman diamond. Alameda gave the
best exhibition of any team which has
faced the'babes this season, allowing
I them all three runs in one bad inning,
l Hunt's men failed to connect with
i the same frequency as in previous en
counters, but they made fewer errors,
only two being chalked up against
j them. Philippi pitched the entire game
for the freshmen. He allowed five hits
but kept them well scattered, and
struck out ten men.
Alameda Pitcher Good
Gordon, the Alameda chuclcer, gave
j a good account of himself, letting the
| yearlings down with five safeties, and
| received good support except in the
third inning. Bartell. second base, L.
Martin in center field, and Blanchard
in left were the outstanding players
on the prep school squad, the latter
making a sensational stop with his
bare hand on Sypher's line drive in the
i eighth inning.
