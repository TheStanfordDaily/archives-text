California has won the right to represent the southern section of the
conference in competition with the northern victors for the Coast basket
ball championship. The past series, the dopesters predicted would be
hard fought, with neither California having exceptional teams. For once
the dopesters were partly correct. The season was hard fought. But
what were supposed to be two weak teams turned out, instead, to be ma
chines of considerable strength.
Stanford rooters need not feel depressed about the loss of the Cali
fornia games. Every one was won by a narrow margin. The men who
were largely responsible for keeping this margin small are all sophomores.
The freshmen demonstrated that the Cardinal basketball hopes need never
flag on thir account. Next year, with the material which promises to be
available, Stanford should inaugurate a series of victories over California
which should last several years.
Both teams started out about evenly. Stanford developed and so did
California. California, evidently, had more possibility than was sus
pected. At any rate, they have the better team.
Whether or not the Bears win or lose in the north, the Cardinals can
be sure that had Stanford made the trip the results, whatever they turn
out to be, would not have been much different. It is a good team repre
senting this section. It may be its last chance for a while.
We find ourselves in the uncustomary activity of rooting for Cali
fornia.
