# "Husky" Hunt
## 
### 
No review of any sport these days is complete without some mention
of Coach "Husky" Hunt, who has done a great deal to put freshmen ath
letics on a winning basis at Stanford.
Hunt started with the class of 1926 in the fall quarter of 1922 and
since then has set a pace too rapid for freshmen coaches across the bay to
follow. His first season here was more or less unsuccessful, but since
then he has turned out two football and two basketball winning teams, a
feather which would become the hat of any Stanford coach.
Victorious freshmen teams were quite a novelty until Hunt started
directing Cardinal first-year athletics and now it has become a habit. And
that is probably the reason why Hunt seems about to put out a winning
freshmen baseball team. —D. C. M.

FOUNDERS' DAY, one week from today, is supposed by many stu
dents to be a full holiday and some already have made arrangements to
honor Senator and Mrs. Stanford all day. The Academic Council, how
ever, has provided for services which will not interrupt class schedules,
and the ceremonies will be held in the evening instead of during the morn
ing hours.
Several years ago, March 9 was a regular university holiday. It was
noticed at this time that the excused students largely ignored the univer
sity plans for honoring the day, choosing instead to observe the occasion
otherwise.
Since then, also, University Day has been instituted. These two
events fall so nearly together at Stanford, that it is most impractical to
provide long programs for each. For this additional reason the council
has preferred to keep Founders' Day services of a memorial character en
tirely and to eliminate events which have no direct bearing on the spirit
of the occasion.
