# Encina Gymnasium Grounds Planted With Low Shrubs
## 
### 
Sixty varieties of shrubs, consisting
of both deciduous and evergreen spe
cies, have been planted around the
Encina gymnasium by the University
recently. A drinking fountain will be
situated at the intersection of paths
in the west square and will be sur
rounded by a hedge of tall shrubs.
The planting of shrubs and trees
around Branner Hall will be started
by Henry Maier, University landscape
engineer, next week. This new unit of
the proposed system of gardens on the
Stanford campus will supply greenery
between Braner and Toyon halls.
