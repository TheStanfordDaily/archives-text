# SENIOR, 1927 NINES BATTLE TOMORRROW
## 
### 
Senior and sophomore interclass
baseball teams meet at 4 o'clock to
morrow afternoon on the intramural
diamond. This will be the first appear
ance for the seniors, the first game
having been forfeited to the juniors
when their manager, "Lefty" May, was
the only player to appear.
The sophomores tied the freshmen
3 to 3 in their first contest even
thought three extra innings were
played. The contest will not be re
played unless a deadlock in league
standing at the end of the season
makes it necessary.

The Rocky Mountain Faculty Ath
i letic Conference recently voted down
the continuance of athletic holidays at
the universities it represents. It also
i passed a motion to the effect that if
students from one conference institu
tion be found guilty of raiding the
campus fo another institution of the
conference, all scheduled conference
games of the offending institution
j shall be cancelled for at least one year.
