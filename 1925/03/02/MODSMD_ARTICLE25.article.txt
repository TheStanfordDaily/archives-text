## SUGGESTIONS FOR LAGUNITA ACTIVITIES 
### Steve O'Donnell 
(Compiled for underclassmen who this
ypar meet our lake for the first time.)
1. Contradicting general opinion, ex
pcriments by the Physics department
have proven that it is as easy to
raddle canoes by daylight as by moon
light. Remember this. Paddle by day.
Canoe by night.
2. To get into canoe. Hold canoe and
watch woman get in. Then get in cor
rect way.
3. To change seats. Paddlers stand
facing each other in bottom of canoe
with paddle at present arms. Simul
taneously, both step on opposite sides.
This preserves the balance. Walk along
sides as on tight-rope, using paddle
to maintain erect position, at equal
speeds. Simultaneously step into bot
tom of canoe. And there you are, safe
and dry.
4. To paddle. Always use right
handed paddle. If you paddle either
side be sure to obtain left-handed
paddle also before leaving boathouse.
Place wide end in water. Move for
ward to go backward and backward to
go forward. Holler at paddler in bow to
pull harder, you don't want to do all
the work. If there is difficulty in mak
ing paddle stay in water, use two or
three window weights.
5. Canoes are like women. In order
to get them to do what you want, try
to make them do what you don't want.
