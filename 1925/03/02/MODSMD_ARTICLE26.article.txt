D. P. A. News Item: "Ernie Brand
sten to require all canoeists, both men
and women, to present swimming cer
tificates before they will be allowed
on the lake."
There goes the last vestige of Uni
versity romance and chivalry. No more
shall shrill cries of "Help! Help!"
arouse the entire masculine population
of the campus to instant action. Nope,
we'll just light up another cigarette
and expertly criticize the technique
of the crawl stroke used, or loungers
may take to carrying stop watches and
betting on the results attained.
And then again, under the new
regime there'll be no force to the good
old threat, "I'll tip the boat over." .
