# ART GALLERY SHOWS ETCHINGS BY COTTON
## 
### 
A group of color etchings by John
W. Cotton went on display in the Art
Gallery yesterday and will continue
for two weeks.
John W. Cotton, of Southern Cali
fornia, is one of America's foremost
color etchers. His works are of par
ticular interest in that they illustrate
aquatint, a kind of etching resembling
water-color drawing. This process of
color etching is more difficult than
line etching as it requires successive
printings and often a series of plates.
The display includes scenes in
Southern California, New Mexico, Bel
gium, and France.
