### PHILIP BIDDISON 
| (A Continued Story)

First Installment

For years Silas Gibbs had dwelt in
perfect peace and happiness on the
outskirts of Falcon. He was a tall,
angular and singularly devout man
who, by the grace of God and the
sweat of his brow, together with that
of his wife and five children, had man
aged to make a patch of sun-baked
prairie yield lettuce, cabbage, and
what-not of garden truck.
It was the custom of Silas to toil in
his gardens on week-days, and, on
Saturdays, to set forth in a small
spring-wagon, drawn by a single white
nag, Cotton, for Falcon. Here, he drove
up and down the dusty roads, proclaim
ing in a loud, nasal sing-song that he
had "nice fresh vegetables for sale
today."
This particular Saturday morning,
a hot June sun was generously gener
ating steam through the battered
straw hat that had served as a cover
ing for Silas' mop of red hair the past
four summers. But business was good
and Silas was happy. What cared he
for perspiration so long as the pile of
turnips in the back of his wagon kept
diminishing at such a gratifying rate?
The vegetable dealer hummed a few
bars to himself by way of introduction,
and then burst forth in resplendent
volume. "On-ward Chris-chun sol-jurs,
mar-ching as to warrr "
As he ended his cadenza with an
extra flourish, the music ceased
abruptly. Perhaps the war had been
declared. For Silas it was certainly in
its first stages.
"Say you!" It was the booming voice
of Jim Kelly, who was no less a per
son than the Mayor of Falcon. Jim
fully realized the importance of his of
fice.
"Say you! Have you got a license t'
peddle this here truck o' yourn?"
"Course I got a license! Ain't I got
a right t' have one, an' ain't I got a
right t' use it?"
"I ain't askin' fer no back talk, Silas
Gibbs. But if y' have got a license it's
hereby, now and presently, revoked in
th' name o' th' law!" The mayor of

Falcon swelled with pride. He was
nothing if not impressive.
"Well, I'll be durned! An' who tol'
yew?" replied Silas, his temper rising
at a dangerous pace.
"There ain't nobody tol' me, but if
you want t' know, me an' several other
of us officials around town here has
decided that your yelpin* vegetables,
an' singin' sams aroun' th' streets o'
Falcon is contrary to th' peace an'
quietude o* th' community. We ain't
perposin't' tolerate it no longer, an'—"
'Hoi' on thar, Jim Kelly! I might as
well tell yew right now,, afore we goes
any farther, that I ain't distarbin' th'
peace, an' I ain't agoin't' obey no sech
orders from yew or nobody else! I
got a right t' make my own livin' an'
I'm a-goin* to." Silas was mad, and
when he got mad, he got just plain
mad.
"Well, it ain't fer me t' stand aroun'
an' argify with yuh. What I've said,
and if you perfer t' sing yer sams up
here in th' cooler rather than t' obey
th' law, why that's up t' you! But mark
my words, if I ketch y' hollerin' aroun'
th' streets agin' I'm goin't' arrest yuh,
an' don't youh fergit it!" Kelly was
gone. The oracle had spoken.
Silas, however, felt differently about
it. His small blue eyes flashed and his
jaw snapped shut with an audible
click.
"Humph! Giddap, Cotton!" was all
he said.
For a time he joggled along in si
lence, all the while assuring himself
mentally that he wasn't going to be
cheated out of an honest living by any
thing as inconsequential as a decree
from Jim Kelly. He had bought his
peddler's license and he certainly
would continue to use it. Squelching
the small voice inside of him that kept
insisting he didn't dare disobey the
mayor, Silas began crying his wares
again, even more loudly than before.

up and down the dusty roads, proclaim
ing in a loud, nasal sing-song that he
had "nice fresh vegetables for sale
today."
This particular Saturday morning,
a hot June sun was generously gener
ating steam through the battered
straw hat that had served as a cover
ing for Silas' mop of red hair the past
four summers. But business was good
and Silas was happy. What cared he
for perspiration so long as the pile of
turnips in the back of his wagon kept
diminishing at such a gratifying rate?
The vegetable dealer hummed a few
bars to himself by way of introduction,
and then burst forth in resplendent
volume. "On-ward Chris-chun sol-jurs,
mar-ching as to warrr "
As he ended his cadenza with an
extra flourish, the music ceased
abruptly. Perhaps the war had been
declared. For Silas it was certainly in
its first stages.
"Say you!" It was the booming voice
of Jim Kelly, who was no less a per
son than the Mayor of Falcon. Jim
fully realized the importance of his of
fice.
"Say you! Have you got a license t'
peddle this here truck o' yourn?"
"Course I got a license! Ain't I got
a right t' have one, an' ain't I got a
right t' use it?"
"I ain't askin' fer no back talk, Silas
Gibbs. But if y' have got a license it's
hereby, now and presently, revoked in
th' name o' th' law!" The mayor of

Falcon swelled with pride. He was
nothing if not impressive.
"Well, I'll be durned! An' who tol'
yew?" replied Silas, his temper rising
at a dangerous pace.
"There ain't nobody tol' me, but if
you want t' know, me an' several other
of us officials around town here has
decided that your yelpin* vegetables,
an' singin' sams aroun' th' streets o'
Falcon is contrary to th' peace an'
quietude o* th' community. We ain't
perposin't' tolerate it no longer, an'—"
'Hoi' on thar, Jim Kelly! I might as
well tell yew right now,, afore we goes
any farther, that I ain't distarbin' th'
peace, an' I ain't agoin't' obey no sech
orders from yew or nobody else! I
got a right t' make my own livin' an'
I'm a-goin* to." Silas was mad, and
when he got mad, he got just plain
mad.
"Well, it ain't fer me t' stand aroun'
an' argify with yuh. What I've said,
and if you perfer t' sing yer sams up
here in th' cooler rather than t' obey
th' law, why that's up t' you! But mark
my words, if I ketch y' hollerin' aroun'
th' streets agin' I'm goin't' arrest yuh,
an' don't youh fergit it!" Kelly was
gone. The oracle had spoken.
Silas, however, felt differently about
it. His small blue eyes flashed and his
jaw snapped shut with an audible
click.
"Humph! Giddap, Cotton!" was all
he said.
For a time he joggled along in si
lence, all the while assuring himself
mentally that he wasn't going to be
cheated out of an honest living by any
thing as inconsequential as a decree
from Jim Kelly. He had bought his
peddler's license and he certainly
would continue to use it. Squelching
the small voice inside of him that kept
insisting he didn't dare disobey the
mayor, Silas began crying his wares
again, even more loudly than before.

volume. "On-ward Chris-chun sol-jurs,
mar-ching as to warrr "
As he ended his cadenza with an
extra flourish, the music ceased
abruptly. Perhaps the war had been
declared. For Silas it was certainly in
its first stages.
"Say you!" It was the booming voice
of Jim Kelly, who was no less a per
son than the Mayor of Falcon. Jim
fully realized the importance of his of
fice.
"Say you! Have you got a license t'
peddle this here truck o' yourn?"
"Course I got a license! Ain't I got
a right t' have one, an' ain't I got a
right t' use it?"
"I ain't askin' fer no back talk, Silas
Gibbs. But if y' have got a license it's
hereby, now and presently, revoked in
th' name o' th' law!" The mayor of

Falcon swelled with pride. He was
nothing if not impressive.
"Well, I'll be durned! An' who tol'
yew?" replied Silas, his temper rising
at a dangerous pace.
"There ain't nobody tol' me, but if
you want t' know, me an' several other
of us officials around town here has
decided that your yelpin* vegetables,
an' singin' sams aroun' th' streets o'
Falcon is contrary to th' peace an'
quietude o* th' community. We ain't
perposin't' tolerate it no longer, an'—"
'Hoi' on thar, Jim Kelly! I might as
well tell yew right now,, afore we goes
any farther, that I ain't distarbin' th'
peace, an' I ain't agoin't' obey no sech
orders from yew or nobody else! I
got a right t' make my own livin' an'
I'm a-goin* to." Silas was mad, and
when he got mad, he got just plain
mad.
"Well, it ain't fer me t' stand aroun'
an' argify with yuh. What I've said,
and if you perfer t' sing yer sams up
here in th' cooler rather than t' obey
th' law, why that's up t' you! But mark
my words, if I ketch y' hollerin' aroun'
th' streets agin' I'm goin't' arrest yuh,
an' don't youh fergit it!" Kelly was
gone. The oracle had spoken.
Silas, however, felt differently about
it. His small blue eyes flashed and his
jaw snapped shut with an audible
click.
"Humph! Giddap, Cotton!" was all
he said.
For a time he joggled along in si
lence, all the while assuring himself
mentally that he wasn't going to be
cheated out of an honest living by any
thing as inconsequential as a decree
from Jim Kelly. He had bought his
peddler's license and he certainly
would continue to use it. Squelching
the small voice inside of him that kept
insisting he didn't dare disobey the
mayor, Silas began crying his wares
again, even more loudly than before.
