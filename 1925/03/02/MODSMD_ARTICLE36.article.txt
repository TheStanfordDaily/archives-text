# RAPID GROWTH OF UNIVERSITY PRESS SHOWN BY REPORTS
## 
### Maynard Sears 
That the University Press is rapidly
becoming an important institution is
shown by the nature and quantity of
material that it published during the
last year. It turned out 15,000 full
bound books and over two hundred
thousand copies of pamphlets, making
a total of eighty titles.
Further statistics and a statement is
sued in Comptroller Roth's last anual
report, to the president that "Publica
tion work at the Press lias grown to
such nil extent that it soon will be
necessary to set up a publication de
partment to handle the sale of official
publications and books published by
the Press," indicate that the Press is
growing in both material and educa
tional importance.
In spite of the lack of an endowment
the Press lias increased in an approxi
mate standing investment from $34,500
in 1920 to something like $100,000' in
1924. During the last academic year it
conducted a gross business of $115,-
49G.26 and shows a net profit of
$6,772.99 from sales outside of Univer
sity departmental work.
The Press had its very meager be
ginning in the early days of the Uni
versity's history. A student by the
name of Quelle first started a small
hand press on his own account for the
purpose of printing announcements,
posters, etc. This was of course merely
a private concern, and it was not until
1917 that the University purchased
Quelle's establishment and commenced
operation thereof. With the rapid
growth of the University and constant
ly increasing demand for printing fa
cilities the Press has been expanded
accordingly until at present a crew of
thirty employes is necessary to run the
plant and take care of the trade.
Besides publishing the Daily Palo
Aito, Chaparral, and the Stanford Il
lustrated Review, the Press turns out
six issues a year of Hispania which is
put out by The American Association
of Teachers of Spanish under the edi
torship of Professor A. M. Espinosa.
The Bulletin is issued quarterly by
the Seismological Society of America
under the direction of Professor S. D.
Townley of the Applied Mathematics
department. A new monthly publica
tion. Wheat Studies, compiled by the
Stanford Food Research Institute, was
started for the first time last Decem
ber. Besides these regular periodicals
the University itself issues a large
quantity of bulletins such as the Presi
dent's Report, Announcement of
Courses, the "Bawl-Out," and others,
including anouncements and posters.
It is hoped that in the future the Press
may be expanded still further until it
enjoys a reputation comparable with
the leading university printing plants
of the country.

An international track meet between
the combined teams of Cornell and
Princeton and those of Cambridge and
Oxford will be held in this country on
July 11. The English also meet Yale
and Harvard the week previous.
