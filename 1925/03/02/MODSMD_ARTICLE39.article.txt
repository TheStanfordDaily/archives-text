# Nurmi's Ghostly Rival

### 
The secret is out at last, and now we know "How Nurmi Does It." Mr.
George Trevor, in a most interesting article in the Brooklyn Eagle, brings out
the fact that "critics forget to take into account the phantom runner, the
shadowy specter, whom no eyes bu Paavo's can Bee. They forget that Nurmi
is not concerned with mortal rivals —that his single-track mind is concentrated
solely on conquering the shadowy substance of Time itself."
"You cannot blame them," he says, "for failing to realize that there is an
invisible starter who will force Nurmi to his best clip. They have not yet
grasped the fact that Paavo is waging a ghostly duel with an entry whose
number never appears on a program. They do not know of Nurmi's personal
vendetta against the stop watch. And Mr. Trevor goes on to tell more of "the
phantom runner whose ghostly spikes make no sound on the echoing boards."
The illustration shows Paavo just as he is about to pass the specter of time
and set a new record. "A self-respecting ghost can stand just so much," and
Nurmi, or rather Nurmercuri, is superior even as to Time itself.
Many hundreds of thousands of words have been written about Nurmi. He
has even had a race horse named after him —another world's record, by the
way. May I venture a new line of thought—that when Nurmi finishes (no pun)
breaking records from the half mile to the marathon, that he go on into the
sprints and hurdles, and, as a climax to his American invasion, enter a relay
race as a one-man-team against four American rivals? He probably could get
away with it.
