# CARD NINE LEAVES BATTING SLUMP TO BEAT SANTA CLARA
## Stanford Ties Series With Broncos by 9 to 3 Win Saturday 
### 
Coming out of its batting slump with
thirteen safe hits and playing error
less ball, the Stanford nine won its
first victory of the season by a 9 to 3
score last Saturday afternoon and tied
the series with Santa Clara.
Stewart had an excellent day at bat
and contributed largely to the Stan
ford scoring. Oviatt chalked up two
hits and two runs during the five in
nings in which he worked, while
Johnston also made a pair of scores.
Oviatt and Collins worked well in
the box and kept Santa Clara's eight
hits scattered. Oviatt held the visitors
scoreless but in the fifth got into
difficulties with three men on bases.
Coach Wolter sent in Collins, who
pulled the Cardinals out of the hole.
Santa Clara was unable to cope with
the Stanford squad. The Broncos' of
fense functioned intermittently, and
only twice did they hit the Stanford
pitchers consistently enough to do any
scoring. In the field their work was
ragged and below the standard of the
game at Santa Clara last Wednesday.
The Cardinals showed their first real
power of the season. The infield was
working smoothly and blanked the
Broncos until the eighth, when Miller
doubled and scored on Randazzo's
sacrifice. Santa Clara staged a belated
rally in the ninth, but was retired after
adding two runs.
McCandless started the scoring in
the second inning when he singled
over second and came home on Stew
art's hit. In the next frame Roberts
beat out a bunt and advanced to sec
ond on Mulchay's roller down the
third-base line. Johnston lifted a long
fly to center and scored Roberts. Mul
chay was safe at home when Muessel
dropped the peg from centerfield.
In the fourth the Cards drove
Wright out of the box after Lawson
and Oviatt scored. Storm took the
mound for Santa Clara but allowed
Stanford two runs in both the fifth
and seventh.
