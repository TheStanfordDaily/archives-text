# TICKETS EOR MACBETH ON SALE TOMORROW
## Orchestra from Stanford, Palo Alto Will Play Incidental Music For Campus Production 
### 
ffUCKETS for English Club's production of "Macbeth" will go on sale in the
* Administration building at Ip.m. tomorrow. Prices will continue the same,
seventy-five cents and one dollar, with all seats reserved. The regular per
formance will be given on Friday night, but a special matinee will be given
on Thursday afternoon for the benefit of high school students on the peninsula.
Incidental music for "Macbeth" will bo rendered by an orchestra of Stanford
and Palo Alto musicians, with Warren D. Allen, University organist and
Glee Club director, as leader. This will be Mr. Allen's first appearance at
Stanford as an orchestra leader, but his ability was demonstrated by the
manner in which he arranged the orchestral parts for one of the Glee Club's
songs last Friday night.
The Dramatic Council has recently purchased a set of new drapes. "Macbeth"
sets are necessarily impressionistic, and with the aid of the new drapes, which

lend themselves perfectly to any color'
of light, effects will be created without
radically changing the scenery.
"Macbeth" will be Gordon Davis'
final campus production of this college
year, as his next play will be the
Senior Farce, which does not appear
until after Spring quarter examina
tions. Davis is leaving for the East
immediately after "Macbeth," where
he will view many of the popular cur
rent shows, secure rights of perform
ance for the ones which he considers
most suitable for a college presenta
tion.
