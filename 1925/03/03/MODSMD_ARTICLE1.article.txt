# NEW RUSHING RULES PASSED UPON By CONFERENCE
## Professor Owens to Receive Violation Complaints For Board 
### 
New rushing rules for the spring
quarter, as passed upon by the Board
of Control, were adopted by the In
ter fraternity Conference at a meet
ing last night. Old rushing rules
were also modified.
Following the nomination two
weeks ago of three men, Homer Oat
man and Frank Frye were elected to the
Board of Control to succeed James Dickey
and Gil Wheat. The former men will
take office in the spring quarter.
Among the old rules stressed and modi
fied was one concerning the visiting of
freshmen in Encina liall by fraternity men.
Hereafter, permission must be obtained
from only a fraternity sponsor if a fra
ternity man wishes to enter the hall. In
the past, permission from any sponsor was
sufficient.
The rule prohibiting campus rushing by
entertainment was further interpreted to
include athletic contests and boating on
the lake. Violation of either part of the
rule is subject to a penalty.
In regard to the reporting of violations
of the rules to the Board of Control, all
complaints will be mailed henceforth in
writing to Professor W. P. Owens of the
Law faculty. Trfe signature of the com
plaining witness shall be thereon affixed,
but will not be used or mentioned during
or after the prosecution proceedings, only
Professor Owens having knowledge of
such signature.
The new rushing rules passed for use
in the spring quarter are as follows:
"During the first six weeks of the spring
quarter, rushing shall be subject to the
same restrictions as above outlined for the
fall and winter quarters.
"Actual rushing begins on Monday of
the seventh week, May 11, and will con
tinue until May 31. During the first
week, a fraternity may have only one
date with a freshman, which may be
either a luncheon or dinner date—but
only one. During the first week, which
begins Monday noon and ends Saturday
evening, the dates shall begin at 11:30
a. m. and end at 2 p. m. for luncheons;
and shall begin at 5:30 p. Nx and end at
8 p. m. for dinners.
"There are, therefore, twelve avail
able dates during the week, each of
which is equal in time. Friday and Sat
urday dates are the same as all the rest.
Each freshman may thus be at any one
house for a maximum time of two and
one-half hours during the first week.
"Dates for the first week shall be
made in the following manner only:
| Form cards must be secured from the
lnterfraternity Board of Control at the
Council meeting on Monday of the
week preceding the first week of rush
ing, May 4.
"These cards, which are self-explan
atory, are to be sent to each freshman
whom the house desires to invite, with
a list of dates, from which he may ac
cept ONE ONLY.
"His signature in the proper place
signifies his acceptance and is binding.
If a house permits a vi§it by a fresh
man who has not signed for that
it has violated this rule, and it will be
denied pledging privileges as a penalty."
A time has not yet been set at which
cards for the second week will be sent
to the freshmen but it will probably be
at the end of .the first week.
"These are to be signed and mailed
back to the house as were those of the
first week. The freshman, however,
may accept as many of the dates offered
by the house as he desires, during this
and the third week. The signature,
once made, is binding as iluring the first
week.
"The second week begins at noon on (
Sunday, May 17, and the time allotted
for rushing is: Sunday, Monday, and !
Tuesday—B a. m. to 8 p. m.; Wednes- 1
day and Thursday—ll:3o a. m. to 8 p. 1
m.; Friday—ll:3o a. m. to 1 a. m. Sat- j
urday; Saturday—B a. m. to 1 a. m.
Sunday.
"Rushing for the third week is iden
tical with that of the second, except that
on the last night of rushing, freshmen
may visit any house or houses, regard
less of signatures on the dtae cards." j
Pledging will take place on Sunday, j
May 31, at the Old Union through a !

The last edition of the "Daily Citi

on wallpaper and dated July 2, 1863,
the time of the Civil War, was lately
given to the University of Arizona for
its museum. The paper was found in
the attic of an old house in Southern
California. It is stated that at that
time that flour was $5 a pound, molas
ses $10 a gallon, and corn $10 a bushel.
New rushing rules for the spring
quarter, as passed upon by the Board
of Control, were adopted by the In
ter fraternity Conference at a meet
ing last night. Old rushing rules
were also modified.
Following the nomination two
weeks ago of three men, Homer Oat
man and Frank Frye were elected to the
Board of Control to succeed James Dickey
and Gil Wheat. The former men will
take office in the spring quarter.
Among the old rules stressed and modi
fied was one concerning the visiting of
freshmen in Encina liall by fraternity men.
Hereafter, permission must be obtained
from only a fraternity sponsor if a fra
ternity man wishes to enter the hall. In
the past, permission from any sponsor was
sufficient.
The rule prohibiting campus rushing by
entertainment was further interpreted to
include athletic contests and boating on
the lake. Violation of either part of the
rule is subject to a penalty.
In regard to the reporting of violations
of the rules to the Board of Control, all
complaints will be mailed henceforth in
writing to Professor W. P. Owens of the
Law faculty. Trfe signature of the com
plaining witness shall be thereon affixed,

Professor Owens having knowledge of
such signature.
The new rushing rules passed for use
in the spring quarter are as follows:
"During the first six weeks of the spring
quarter, rushing shall be subject to the
same restrictions as above outlined for the
fall and winter quarters.
"Actual rushing begins on Monday of
the seventh week, May 11, and will con
tinue until May 31. During the first
week, a fraternity may have only one
date with a freshman, which may be
either a luncheon or dinner date—but
only one. During the first week, which
begins Monday noon and ends Saturday
evening, the dates shall begin at 11:30
a. m. and end at 2 p. m. for luncheons;
and shall begin at 5:30 p. Nx and end at
8 p. m. for dinners.
"There are, therefore, twelve avail
able dates during the week, each of
which is equal in time. Friday and Sat
urday dates are the same as all the rest.
Each freshman may thus be at any one
house for a maximum time of two and
one-half hours during the first week.
"Dates for the first week shall be
made in the following manner only:
| Form cards must be secured from the
lnterfraternity Board of Control at the
Council meeting on Monday of the
week preceding the first week of rush
ing, May 4.
"These cards, which are self-explan
atory, are to be sent to each freshman
whom the house desires to invite, with
a list of dates, from which he may ac
cept ONE ONLY.
"His signature in the proper place
signifies his acceptance and is binding.

it has violated this rule, and it will be

The new rushing rules passed for use
in the spring quarter are as follows:
"During the first six weeks of the spring
quarter, rushing shall be subject to the
same restrictions as above outlined for the
fall and winter quarters.
"Actual rushing begins on Monday of
the seventh week, May 11, and will con
tinue until May 31. During the first
week, a fraternity may have only one
date with a freshman, which may be
either a luncheon or dinner date—but
only one. During the first week, which
begins Monday noon and ends Saturday
evening, the dates shall begin at 11:30
a. m. and end at 2 p. m. for luncheons;
and shall begin at 5:30 p. Nx and end at
8 p. m. for dinners.
"There are, therefore, twelve avail
able dates during the week, each of
which is equal in time. Friday and Sat
urday dates are the same as all the rest.
Each freshman may thus be at any one
house for a maximum time of two and
one-half hours during the first week.
"Dates for the first week shall be
made in the following manner only:
| Form cards must be secured from the
lnterfraternity Board of Control at the
Council meeting on Monday of the
week preceding the first week of rush
ing, May 4.
"These cards, which are self-explan
atory, are to be sent to each freshman
whom the house desires to invite, with
a list of dates, from which he may ac
cept ONE ONLY.
"His signature in the proper place
signifies his acceptance and is binding.
If a house permits a vi§it by a fresh
man who has not signed for that
it has violated this rule, and it will be
denied pledging privileges as a penalty."
A time has not yet been set at which
cards for the second week will be sent
to the freshmen but it will probably be
at the end of .the first week.
"These are to be signed and mailed
back to the house as were those of the
first week. The freshman, however,
may accept as many of the dates offered
by the house as he desires, during this
and the third week. The signature,
once made, is binding as iluring the first
week.
"The second week begins at noon on (
Sunday, May 17, and the time allotted
for rushing is: Sunday, Monday, and !
Tuesday—B a. m. to 8 p. m.; Wednes- 1
day and Thursday—ll:3o a. m. to 8 p. 1
m.; Friday—ll:3o a. m. to 1 a. m. Sat- j
urday; Saturday—B a. m. to 1 a. m.
Sunday.
"Rushing for the third week is iden
tical with that of the second, except that
on the last night of rushing, freshmen
may visit any house or houses, regard
less of signatures on the dtae cards." j

The last edition of the "Daily Citi
zen" of Vicksburg, Mississippi, printed
on wallpaper and dated July 2, 1863,
the time of the Civil War, was lately
given to the University of Arizona for
its museum. The paper was found in
the attic of an old house in Southern
California. It is stated that at that
time that flour was $5 a pound, molas
ses $10 a gallon, and corn $10 a bushel.
New rushing rules for the spring
quarter, as passed upon by the Board
of Control, were adopted by the In
ter fraternity Conference at a meet
ing last night. Old rushing rules
were also modified.
Following the nomination two
weeks ago of three men, Homer Oat
man and Frank Frye were elected to the
Board of Control to succeed James Dickey
and Gil Wheat. The former men will
take office in the spring quarter.
Among the old rules stressed and modi
fied was one concerning the visiting of
freshmen in Encina liall by fraternity men.
Hereafter, permission must be obtained
from only a fraternity sponsor if a fra
ternity man wishes to enter the hall. In
the past, permission from any sponsor was
sufficient.
The rule prohibiting campus rushing by
entertainment was further interpreted to
include athletic contests and boating on
the lake. Violation of either part of the
rule is subject to a penalty.
In regard to the reporting of violations
of the rules to the Board of Control, all
complaints will be mailed henceforth in
writing to Professor W. P. Owens of the
Law faculty. Trfe signature of the com
plaining witness shall be thereon affixed,
but will not be used or mentioned during
or after the prosecution proceedings, only
Professor Owens having knowledge of
such signature.
