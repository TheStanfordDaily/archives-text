# NEW RUSHING RULES PASSED UPON By CONFERENCE
## Professor Owens to Receive Violation Complaints For Board 
### 
New rushing rules for the spring
quarter, as passed upon by the Board
of Control, were adopted by the In
ter fraternity Conference at a meet
ing last night. Old rushing rules
were also modified.
Following the nomination two
weeks ago of three men, Homer Oat
man and Frank Frye were elected to the
Board of Control to succeed James Dickey
and Gil Wheat. The former men will
take office in the spring quarter.
Among the old rules stressed and modi
fied was one concerning the visiting of
freshmen in Encina liall by fraternity men.
Hereafter, permission must be obtained
from only a fraternity sponsor if a fra
ternity man wishes to enter the hall. In
the past, permission from any sponsor was
sufficient.
The rule prohibiting campus rushing by
entertainment was further interpreted to
include athletic contests and boating on
the lake. Violation of either part of the
rule is subject to a penalty.
In regard to the reporting of violations
of the rules to the Board of Control, all
complaints will be mailed henceforth in
writing to Professor W. P. Owens of the
Law faculty. Trfe signature of the com
plaining witness shall be thereon affixed,
but will not be used or mentioned during
or after the prosecution proceedings, only
Professor Owens having knowledge of
such signature.
The new rushing rules passed for use
in the spring quarter are as follows:
"During the first six weeks of the spring
quarter, rushing shall be subject to the
same restrictions as above outlined for the
fall and winter quarters.
"Actual rushing begins on Monday of
the seventh week, May 11, and will con
tinue until May 31. During the first
week, a fraternity may have only one
date with a freshman, which may be
either a luncheon or dinner date—but
only one. During the first week, which
begins Monday noon and ends Saturday
evening, the dates shall begin at 11:30
a. m. and end at 2 p. m. for luncheons;
