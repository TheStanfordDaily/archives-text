# PROFESSOR MANLY LECTURES TONIGHT
## Chicago English Head Will Discuss Man's Education During Infancy 
### 
Professor J. M. Manly, head of
the Department of English at the
University of Chicago since 1898,
will speak in the Little Theater this
evening at 7:30 on "Education That
Educates."
After illustrating the well known
saying, that any animal that has an
infancy can and must be educated,
Professor Manly will point out that the
period of infancy of education for man
has been greatly lengthened by the
enormous increase in the number of
facts and forces of the world that must
be mastered as a preparation for suc
cessful living.
"The period of infancy is now too
long. The mere loss of time is not the
most serious consideration. More im
portant is the fact that the period of
receptivity is now allowed to cover the
years when the creative powers of men
are at their height," says Manly.
Professor Manly will undertake to
point out three ways in which the sit
uation should be met.
Professor Manly is an authority on
the origins of the drama and has pub
lished many textbooks. He has also
contributed to the Cambridge History
of English Literature, the Shakespeare
Memorial Volume, and various period
icals.
