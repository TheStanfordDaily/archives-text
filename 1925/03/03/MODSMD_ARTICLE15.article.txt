# OLYMPIC CLUB WILL PLAY STANFORD ON VARSITY DIAMOND
## Ernie Nevers Joins Squad; Will Strengthen Card Pitching Staff 
### 
Stanford's baseball team meets the
Olympic club nine tomorrow afternoon
at 2:30 on the varsity diamond. A
game has also been arranged with the
St. Louis Ntaional League team at its
training camp in Stockton next Tues
day.
The Cardinal pitching staff has
shown great improvement over its early
exhibitions. With Ernie Nevers now
out for regular practice, additional
strength is given to the squad. During
the latter part of the basketball season
Nevers worked out a number of times,
but yesterday was the first time that he
was in uniform.
Besides Oviatt and Collins, who did
capable work in the last game with
Santa Clara, Coach Wolter has Teague
and Osthaus to round out the staff.
With Jim Lawson behind the bat the
squad has two excellent catchers. Last
Saturday Lawson played in his first
game of the season and turned in a
good exhibition.
Hitting Improves.
Against the Broncos the team showed
an improved brand of ball, with the
batsmen hitting the deliveries of
Wright and Storm consistently. The
infield went errorless, while at short
and second Mulcahy and Roberts did
some flashy work.
In the past the Olympic have brought
strong veteran teams to Stanford. Lit
tle can be judged of the comparative
strength of the two teams, but the club
men were defeated by the California
nine 9 to 0 Saturday, when the Bears
hit the Olympic pitchers safely thirteen
times.
