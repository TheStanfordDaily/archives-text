by Chief Justice Taft, who will administer
the oath of office, Cabinet members, and
President Coolidge. At high noon (East

a few moments as he raises his hand to
take the oath of office for a term of four
years.
The inaugural address will be preceded
by a short prayer and followed by "The
Star Spangled Banner" played by the
United States Marine Band. This will
conclude the ceremony.
