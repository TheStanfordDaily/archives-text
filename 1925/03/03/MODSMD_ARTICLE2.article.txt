# PRESIDIO POLO FOUR TO MEET CARDINALS ON FARM TOMORROW
## 
### Biddle Dorcy 
Polo enthusiasts will have an oppor
tunity to see the Stanford polo team
in action tomorrow at 2:30 on the
highway field, when they meet the
30th Infantry team from the Presidio
of San Francisco. The recent rains and
warm weather have put the field in
excellent condition, and a hard, fast
game is expected. With the fine weath
er that has prevailed there will no
doubt be a large turnout to see the
contest.
The ponies of the 30th Infantry ar
rived this morning at the military
stables, and have called forth much
admiring comments from riding en
thusiasts. In the first game with the
Stanford team some three weeks ago
these same ponies proved themselves
to be both fast and handy, and the
game tomorrow will bring out an exhi
bition of hard riding. While the visi
tors are conceded to be the better
mounted, Stanford has the advantage
of boing able to practice more consist
ently as a unit, and hopes to be able
to repeat the recent victory over the
Army four.
The lineup will be chosen from the
following men:
30th Infantry Stanford
Dierking 1 Thomas, Krohn
Capt. Hudgins 2 Irwin
Capt. Scott 3 Laub, Dorcy
lit.. Deal 4 Trotter, Baker
Lt. Dulaney
According to Capt. John M. Jenkins,
Jr., coach of polo at Stanford, there Is
a very good chance of entering the
California State Novice and Junior
championships at Del Monte in March,
if suitable arrangements can be made
with the University. This would be a
great stride forward for polo in Stan
ford, and on the Pacific Coast. The
great interest that is now taken in
riding and horsemanship at Stanford
nhould make it a natural center for
intercollegiate polo in the West.
