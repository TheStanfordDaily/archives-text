# About Those Dining Halls

### 
For a couple of months there have been grumblings about the eating
situation on the campus. The students have never fully understood the
Administration's attitude and it is possible that this misunderstanding is at
the botton, of a great deal of aimless conversation. We hope that the
following statement explaining the situation, which has been prepared by
Comptroller A. E. Roth, will clear up matters:
In order to understand the present situation it is necessary to know
something of the history of this problem.
For many years the University assumed no responsibility in the matter
of furnishing dining accommodations for men students, or for the general
public, and students were compelled to forage for meals wherever they could
find them. The old Stanford Inn, now the Military Headquarters building,
stood where the library now stands. It was privately managed and was
entirely inadequate to meet the needs. Many students were compelled to
stand in line and "wait second turn," or walk to College Terrace or Palo Alto.
Several hundred students were thus compelled to walk six miles each day for
their meals. The writer was a member of a student committee which made
an unavailing appeal to the Board of Trustees for the construction of adequate
facilities. I have on my desk a copy of a student magazine of that day in
which appears an article severely criticizing the administration for not build
ing dining halls. In 1914 Mr. McDowell, Alumni Secretary, was successful in
interesting alumni in the situation and the old eating clubs adjoining Encina
were constructed from the proceeds of loans made by three alumni. These
loans have not yet been entirely refunded. At that time the student body
numbered approximately 1200 men of whom about 300 were accommodated
at Encina Hall, which was then the only dormitory for men.
With the growth of the student body and the increased accommodations
due to the enlargement of Encina Hall and the use of Sequoia as a men s
dormitory, the need for additional eating accommodations on the campus was
greatly increased.
UNIVERSITY AIDS SEQUOIA
With the opening of college in 1919 the only dining accommodations on
the campus consisted of a cafeteria maintained in the old Inn and a dining
room in the basement of the old Union, both of which were operated by Prank
Tagawa, a Japanese. These places were poorly lighted and the kitchens were
unbelievably dirty and insanitary. Many well-founded complaints were made
to the University authorities concerning conditions in these places. During
the preceding summer the University had agreed to lease the Sequoia dining
room to Tagawa and he was preparing to open it in the fall of 1919. At the
suggestion of the Comptroller the Sequoia Eating Club was organized and
Tagawa's lease covering the Sequoia Dining Hall was cancelled. The Univer
sity lent $3000 to the Sequoia Eating Club to cover the cost of additional
equipment purchased by the Club. It is interesting to note that Sequoia
Eating Club was suggested and fostered by University authorities.
With the adoption of the one-year dormitofy rule for freshmen and the
completion of Toyon and Branner halls it became necessary to furnish addi
tional dining accommodations and the University thereupon adopted the
policy of providing dining halls in connection with, or in close proximity to,
all dormitories. The Encina Dining Hall was built to take care of the men
from Encina and a portion of the men from Toyon. Assuming that the men
of Branner Hall would desire to eat where they lived, as a great majority of
the men at Sequoia have been doing, a dining hall was provided for Branner.
The complete plans for Toyon call for a dining room in the area between
Branner kitchen and Toyon club rooms, which eventually shall accommodate
the men now taken care of by the private eating clubs, but probably will not
be added until the present private eating club buildings deteriorate to a point
where they must be wrecked, or until their site is required for additional
dormitories. Building plans call for two smaller dormitories, without dining
halls, to be built at either side of Toyon in the space occupied by the old
clubs and the auto parking space. If it seems desirable, these smaller units
may be operated on a departmental basis and open to both fraternity and non
fraternity men in Law, Medicine, Engineering, and other courses. With the
completion of these two additional units we shall again reach the point where
our dining facilities will be crowded to capacity.
So much for past history and future plans; now as to the present situation.
PRESENT SITUATION
The public dining room at the Stanford Union loses money and probably
always will in accordance with the well-established custom of university union
dining halls. The loss arises chiefly from the fact that a campus public dining
room patronage is both limited and fluctuating, due to holidays and a variety
of factors. Meals must be served over a very short period of time with
practically no turn over. The Stanford Union is under the control of a board
of directors composed of faculty members, alumni and students. This Board
considered various methods of securing a steadier patronage for the Union
dining room, and concluded that since there were many men on the waiting
list for rooms it was logical to give preference, in assigning rooms, to men
who would agree to board regularly at the Union. The Board concluded further
that since all the dormitories had waiting lists that it would be fair to apply
the same rule to all dormitories. It was unanimously decided by the Union
Board to make such recommendation to the President, and the recommendation
was made. The recommendation did not contemplate the abolition of the old !
eating clubs nor of the Sequoia Eating Club. The University authorities ac
cepted this recommendation and announced that it would be carried out with
the opening of the fall quarter.
The University's attitude in the matter has not been entirely clear, and
in order to clear up any possible misunderstanding the following statement of
the final plans for next fall is issued:
FINAL PLANS FOR FALL
1. Inasmuch as there are not a sufficient number of men now residing
in Branner Hall who desire to avail themselves of the dining room accommo
dations to justify the continued operation of the dining hall, the Branner
Dining Hall has been closed for the balance of this year. The men who have
been eating at the Branner dining room can be taken care of by the Union
and other dining groups.
2. Before the end of this college year a poll will be taken of applicants for
rooms at Branner Hall for next year to determine how many of the men now
living at the Hall and those on the waiting list desire dining accommodations.
If there are a sufficient number who desire dining accommodations at
Branner such applicants will be given preference in the assignment of rooms
and the dining hall will be open for their accommodation. If not, the dining
room will not be re-opened until the completion of additional dormitories
makes it necessary. This course is not taken with a view to compelling any
one to eat in the University dining halls, but. is based on the very logical
proposition that if there are students who desire to avail themselves of campus
dining facilities and who find this arrangement a convenient and economical
one, then such Btudefits should be given preference over men who desire to
live on the campus hut prefer to eat in Palo Alto. The University authorities
belteve that the reasonable thing to do is to find out. whether there are a
sufficient number of men who desire these accommodations to justify the
operation of the dining room. The student, in Palo Alto who has not been
fortunate enough to secure accommodations in Branner Hall or any of the
other dormitories, is entitled to as much consideration at the hands of the ;
University as the student now in Branner who may feel that simply because
he has enjoyed one or two years of splendid accommodations on the campus j
lie has a vested right thereto. It is true that there no doubt will be many j

who will prefer to forsake their privilege of eating in Palo Alto or elsewhere j
for their privilege of living in Branner and for this reason will state a
preference for dining accommodations thereby excluding men who would be ,
very happy to secure both living and dining accommodations. There is, i
however, no compulsion by the University involved in this decision. The men
now living in Branner Hall, who do not desire to eat and live at Branner will
still have their choice of living at Encina, Toyon or Sequoia.
OTHER GROUPS UNAFFECTED
3. The eating clubs will not be affected by this arrangement, with this
exception: men who are members of the eating clubs will not be assigned
to Branner Hall but must room in Toyon, Encina, or elsewhere.
4. Sequoia Eating Club will not be affected.
5. The Union Board of Control is left free to make whatever regulations I
it desires with regard to the Union.
Inasmuch as practically all the men who live at Toyon Hall now eat at
the private eating clubs, or the eating clubs operated at Encina Dining Halls,
and the men at Sequoia for the most part now eat at Sequoia, the above pro
gram will substantially carry out the University's policy of having the men
who reside in the Halls furnished with dining accommodations eat at the j
place where they live. For the present Sequoia Hall and the private eating ,
clubs are considered a part of the University system.
In considering "Viewpoints" published in the Daily Palo Alto, and criti-1
cisms which hame been made, it is well to bear these facts in mind:
1. It is a far cry from the lack of dining facilities in 15)09 when students I
were condemning the University for not providing dining halls to the splendid
accommodations of today; or from the dirty kitchens of the old Inn to the
clean, well-lighted kitchens of Encina, Branner, and the Union. These new
dining halls are considered models of cleanliness, and the manner in which
they are maintained and conducted has been the cause of much favorable
comment from alumni, parents, and visitors to the University.
2. Students are now able to obtain well-prepared, wholesome food at
very reasonable rates. A comparison with rates at other places will show
that the rates at Stanford are low.
3. The dining halls are run on a co-operative cost basis and neither
private concessionnaires nor the University makes any money out of their
operation.
STUDENTS ADVISE MANAGEMENT
4. The" students are given an opportunity to make constructive criticisms
concerning menus and of actually deciding many problems of management
through their duly elected student boards. It is the desire of the University
authorities that the students should be given as large a voice in the manage
mnt of the dining halls as is consistent with the operation of so large an
undertaking. It must be remembered, however, that in this matter, as in all
other co-operative schemes, the minority must submit to the will of the
majority, and the University should not be blamed by the minority for decisions
made by the majority. Many complaints are made which never reach the
governing boards. Many well-meaning suggestions from critics who do not
have possession of all of the facts are impracticable. The individual thinks
that what he wants is wanted by the majority and complains bitterly when
he does not get it, when as a matter of fact he may be one of very few
who desire the particular thing.
5. The University cannot hope to please everyone at all times with the
food served or the service rendered. This is impossible in a family of two to
say nothing of a family of from 100 to 500. It must necessarily deal with
averages. The University dining halls are not designed to accommodate
epicures nor people who desire and can afford to pay $40 or $50 per month
for board. They were designed to furnish plain, wholesome food at a
reasonable cost for the average type of Stanford man who wants quick service
at a low cost and an opportunity to become acquainted with his fellow
students. The only object which the University has in maintaining dining
halls is to accommodate the students. It makes absolutely nothing out of the
operation, and it would be much simpler from the standopint of the authorities
to provide no accommodations and let the students secure food and lodging
wherever they were to be found in Palo Alto or elsewhere as the students
are now compelled to do at the University of California and as they formerly
were compelled to do at Stanford. The University feels, however, that the
average student will get much more out of college from the standpoint of
health and an opportunity for friendships and association with other students,
and economy of time and living expenses if he can secure dining and living
accommodations on the campus, and this is the foundation of its policy. It has
no desire or intention of compelling any one to accept these privileges. It
does intend, however, that insofar as possible students who appreciate them
and desire to avail themselves thereof shall be given an opportunity and not
excluded by those who desire to dine elsewhere.
