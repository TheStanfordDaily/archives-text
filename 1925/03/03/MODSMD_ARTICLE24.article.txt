"Whoah, Cotton! What's that yew
say, Mrs. Perkins? Have I got some
radishes t'day? Yes, Mam! Nice ones!
Nickle a bunch!" Silas had gotten
down from the wagon and was holding
out a tempting bunch for the plump
Mrs. Perkins to inspect.
"Say, whatclia know, Kelly jest tol'
me I had t' git offen th' streets o'
Falcon from now on," confided Silas.
"Well, now, ain't that too bad!" bub
bled the plump Mrs. Perkins, sensing
a nice morsel of gossip. "Why is that,
Mr. Gibbs?"
"Oh him an' some o' th* rest o' his
gand aroun' town here has decided
that I'm disturbin' th* peace."
"My lan'! Did you ever!" exclaimed
the radish customer, dropping three
nice bunches of the vegetable into her
apron.
"Yeah, nice thing, ain't it, when a
man can't make a honest livin' in a
honest way?"
"Well, I should say so! But it's just
as I tol' my Jake when the last pair
o' twins came along, y' never kin tell
what's goin't' happen next. How much
is these tomatoes?" queried the house
wife, as she poked a stubby finger into
the middle of a basket.
"Twenty-five cents the basket," quot
ed Silas.
"Well, I'll take this one, an' I guess
that'll be all this time. I'm sure goin'
t' miss you fer my Sunday vegetables,
Mr. Gibbs."
Mrs. Perkins had unknowingly
fanned Silas into flame again.
"No yer not, fer I'm goin' t' keep
right on sellin', if I have anything t'
say about it!" He brought his fist
down upon the wagon with such a
loud whack that his customer nearly
dropped her tomatoes. "That'll be forty
cents, Mrs. Perkins."
Mrs. Perkins paid in silence. Evi
dently she wasn't going to risk her
tomatoes a second time.
"Thank you, mam—goodbye—see y'
nex' Saturday," yelled Silas as he rat
tled on down the street in his rickety
old wagon.
And so it went throughout the re
mainder of the forenoon and late into
the afternoon. Everywhere, Silas con
fided his troubles, and everywhere re
ceived the undivided sympathy of his
be-aproned customers in return.
About dark, he returned to his little
farm, and told his wife of the attempt
of Kelly to bring disaster to the family
income. At first the good woman was
frightened. But she had faith in her
Silas, and when he assured her that
there was nothing to be afraid of, she
decided to accept the matter as it
stood, with the resignation of a mar
tyr, and leave the rest to her husband.
The next day Silas and his starched
family went to church as was their
custom. Silas sang in the choir as
usual. Why shouldn't things go on nor
mally, particularly since it had been
decided by the majority of the church
brethren that it was the act of a
Christian gentleman to stand up for
his own rights?
By Monday morning, however, Silas
had begun to wear a worried look. If
Kelly should happen to carry out his
threat, there was nothing left for the
Gibbs family to do but pack up its
few scattered belongings and seek new
territory. But as far as Silas was con
cerned, this could never be. He loved
his carefully tended gardens, every foot
of them, and he would fight for them.

"Well, now, ain't that too bad!" bub
bled the plump Mrs. Perkins, sensing
a nice morsel of gossip. "Why is that,
Mr. Gibbs?"
"Oh him an' some o' th* rest o' his
gand aroun' town here has decided
that I'm disturbin' th* peace."
"My lan'! Did you ever!" exclaimed
the radish customer, dropping three
nice bunches of the vegetable into her
apron.
"Yeah, nice thing, ain't it, when a
man can't make a honest livin' in a
honest way?"
"Well, I should say so! But it's just
as I tol' my Jake when the last pair
o' twins came along, y' never kin tell
what's goin't' happen next. How much
is these tomatoes?" queried the house
wife, as she poked a stubby finger into
the middle of a basket.
"Twenty-five cents the basket," quot
ed Silas.
"Well, I'll take this one, an' I guess
that'll be all this time. I'm sure goin'
t' miss you fer my Sunday vegetables,
Mr. Gibbs."
Mrs. Perkins had unknowingly
fanned Silas into flame again.
"No yer not, fer I'm goin' t' keep
right on sellin', if I have anything t'
say about it!" He brought his fist
down upon the wagon with such a
loud whack that his customer nearly
dropped her tomatoes. "That'll be forty
cents, Mrs. Perkins."
Mrs. Perkins paid in silence. Evi
dently she wasn't going to risk her
tomatoes a second time.
"Thank you, mam—goodbye—see y'
nex' Saturday," yelled Silas as he rat
tled on down the street in his rickety
old wagon.
And so it went throughout the re
mainder of the forenoon and late into
the afternoon. Everywhere, Silas con
fided his troubles, and everywhere re
ceived the undivided sympathy of his
be-aproned customers in return.
About dark, he returned to his little
farm, and told his wife of the attempt
of Kelly to bring disaster to the family
income. At first the good woman was
frightened. But she had faith in her
Silas, and when he assured her that
there was nothing to be afraid of, she
decided to accept the matter as it
stood, with the resignation of a mar
tyr, and leave the rest to her husband.
The next day Silas and his starched
family went to church as was their
custom. Silas sang in the choir as
usual. Why shouldn't things go on nor
mally, particularly since it had been
decided by the majority of the church
brethren that it was the act of a
Christian gentleman to stand up for
his own rights?
By Monday morning, however, Silas
had begun to wear a worried look. If
Kelly should happen to carry out his
threat, there was nothing left for the
Gibbs family to do but pack up its
few scattered belongings and seek new
territory. But as far as Silas was con
cerned, this could never be. He loved
his carefully tended gardens, every foot
of them, and he would fight for them.

"Whoah, Cotton! What's that yew
