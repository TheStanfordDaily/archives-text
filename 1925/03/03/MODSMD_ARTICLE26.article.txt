### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
A few weeks ago there appeared in these columns a cartoon entitled
"Famous Walkers." Today we submit another one of the clan for your inspec
tion, who, though not bearing the same last name as the renowned "Mickey,"
is nevertheless as colorful and interesting a champion.
That handsome "Sheik of the Cinder-path," Ugo Frigerio of Italy, now in this
country to demolish walking records, and, perhaps, to go into the movies, is a
very interesting athlete. If you have ever seen Ugo stepping along jauntily
in his own inimitable style, with his shoulders moving up and down as his
knees lock and unlock, you will admit that here is one Walker who, at least,
has color.
Frigerio always carries a handkerchief in his hand when he completes, and
when the plaudits of the multitude reach him he is wont to turn his handsome
face to the crowd and acknowledge their cheers by giving the Roman salute.
Tis is quite different from the Suban Presidential salute or the equally famous
Bronx cheer.
Ugo is said to represent the Latin Spirit in amateur athletics. He is a
Chevalier of the Crown, and a true descendant of the fighting Caesars. He
has won two Olympic championships: one at the age of 19, and the second
when 23. Veni, Vidi, Yici! Pro Patria!
