# Juniors Will Hold Special "7 to 8" Tomorrow Night
## 
### 
The Junior Class is confident of hav
ing that rare event happen, a well
and fully-attended class meeting.
Instead of resorting to the time-hon
ored means of fines as in most or
ganizations, 1926 has joined the ranks
of the "seven-to-eighters." Gasps of
surprise and joyful shouts attended
the anouncement that the juniors
would hold a 7-to-8 in the Women's
Clubhouse tomorrow night, which is
to be absolutely free.
"Chubby" Tyroler will officiate
the dancing and Sam Johnson is ar
ranging entertainment, while "Sis"
McLeod will have supervision of the
whole affair.
