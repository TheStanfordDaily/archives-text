# DRESS REHEARSAL FOR "MACBETH" IS SCHEDULED TONIGHT
## 
### 
The first dress rehearsal for "Mac
beth, ' the Shakespearean drama that
will be presented by the English club
on Friday of this week, is scheduled for
tonight. This first dress rehearsal is
one day earlier tfian usual, and Gordon
Davis will hold another tomorrow
night.
The characters are rapidly adapting
themselves to this new type of produc
tion. Both Delmer Daves as Macbeth,
and Helen Feldman as Lady Macbeth
are "at home" on the stage as they
have had a great deal of previous ex
perience. Daves' acting is good, and his
deep bass voice works in well with the
role of the unscrupulous Macbeth.
Lady Macbeth has one of the most
difficult parts in the play, but Helen
Feldman handles the role with skill.
Miss Teldman, who has been on the
professional stage, is making her debut
before a Stanford audiencc in this
drama.
Raymond Riese is playing the part of
Macduff, and James Du Prau the role
of King Duncan. Riese and Du Prau
are also recent dramatic "finds." Riese
was in the Sophomore playâ€”Dulcy, but
Du Prau has never been on the Stanford
stage before, being a transfer last quar
ter.
Gordon Davis has been devoting a
great amount of time on the banquet
scene, in an effort to make every action
in it perfect. The witch scene which
is the most weird moment of the play,
is also being worked on. The witches
arc Barbara Probasco, Gwendolyn Mac-
Govern, Katholeen Hillis, and Harriet
Oliver.
