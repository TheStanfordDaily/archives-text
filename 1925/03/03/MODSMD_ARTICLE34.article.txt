# JUNIOR NINE LOSES TO FIRST-YEAR MEN IN INTERCLASS TILT
## 
### 
Rallying in the last two Innings,
baseball men of the class of 1928
pounded out a 6 to 5 win over the
juniors in the interclass series yester
day. At the end of the fourth frame
the score stood 4 to 1 in favor of the
third-year men.
With few exceptions Hunt used his
second-string lineup. Sobieski, one of
his regular hurlers, pitched good ball
for four innings but received poor sup
port. Wolf relieved him at the begin
ning of the fifth. Koliler, '26 backstop,
! was the only junior to hit safely. He
collected a single from each of the
freshman pitchers, and played a steady
game behind the plate.
Freshmen Field Poorly
Taking advantage of three errors
and Holder's hit, the upperclassmen
scored three times in their first ses
sion at bat. More errors and a walk
gave them another tally in the fourth
without connecting for one safe blow.
Kohler came through with his second
single in the fifth and added the last
1926 run on the customary freshman
bobble, making the score 5 to 1, the
yearlings having secured one tally in
the fourth.
Graves did fair mound work for the
juniors until the fifth inning, when
the babes put over four runs and drove
him from the box. Dickey, who had I
been playing a brilliant game in left I
field, took his place and held the fresh- j
men to one run in the last inning. As i
a whole the fielding of the upperclass
men was only mediocre. Biaggini, star
standing guard on the 1928 basketball
squad, did consistently well in left field
for the first-year men. Vincenti was
catcher.
