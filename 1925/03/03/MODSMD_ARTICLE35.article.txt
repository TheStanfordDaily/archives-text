# VARSITY, FRESHMAN SWIMMING TEAMS TO MEET U. C. SATURDAY
## 
### 
Stanford and California varsity and
freshman swimming teams clash next
Saturday in the Encina pool in their
annual dual meets. The Cardinal men,
fresh from their water polo victories
over the Blue and Gold, started inten
sive training last night.
Probable relay teams of the two
Cardinal squads were sent through
their paces at the practice yesterday,
and Coach Brandsten was pleased with
the showing made.
A large number of freshmen have
been turning out in anticipation of
Saturday's struggle. Brandsten is not
confident that the babes will come out
with the long end of the score and he
is welcoming all new material that
appears.
