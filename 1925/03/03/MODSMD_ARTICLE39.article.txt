# HAYWARD HIGH MEETS YEARLING BASEBALL SQUAD TOMORROW
## 
### 
Hayward high school will be the next
opponent of the freshman ball club at
3:30 tomorrow afternoon on the first
year diamond. With four straight vic
tories and no defeats to their credit
the babes should get a good workout
tomorrow but should not be forced to
extend themselves to the limit to win.
Since the close of the basketball
season Hunt has been able to devote
all his energies to baseball and has
hadÂ«some good prospects from the
court squad out in suits, the most
promising of which are Biaggini, Rey
nolds, and Vincenti. Biaggini has
worked in a couple of interclass games
and has shown a lot of fire. He is
fast and sure on flies, has a good peg,
and is a hard hitter.
