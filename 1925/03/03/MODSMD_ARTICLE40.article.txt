# MEN'S COUNCIL DECISIONS
## 
### 
The first liquor case on the campus
to be brought before the Men's Coun
cil during the present year is made
public in a recent announcement in
which:
The Men's Council for student con
trol recommends that in the case of a
certain student, he shall have fifteen
hours added to his graduation require
ments, and he shall be put on strict
probation because he was intoxicated
while at a campus dance and made
himself obnoxious to everyone present.
The offense is considered sufficiently
serious, that in the case of any similar
subsequent offense he will be immedi
ately dismissed from the University.

The Northwestern University has a
Women's Glee Club which gives regu
lar concerts.
