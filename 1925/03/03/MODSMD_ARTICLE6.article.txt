# TERMAN ADVOCATES MORE INDEPENDENCE
## 
### 
"Methods of Work and Study Suit
able for the Graduate Student" was
the topic which Professor L. M. Ter
man discussed at the Education Club
meeting last evening in the Women's
Clubhouse. Professor Terman strongly
advocated giving the graduate student
greater independence from set require
ments. At present, he said, the gradu
ate is not trained for individual work,
although it is expected from him.
Professor Terman further stated that
some universities give more freedom
to junior and senior undergraduates.
This system he advocated as giving the
student training for more advanced
work.
