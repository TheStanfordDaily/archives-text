# PRESIDENTIAL OATH HEARD OVER RADIO IN ASSEMBLY HALL
## International Relations Form Theme of Coolidge's Inaugural Speech 
### 
As William Howard Taft adminis
tered the oath of office to President
Calvin Coolidge this morning on the
steps of the capitol building in Wash
ington, D. C., an audience of about
one thousand heard the ceremony over
radio in the Assembly hall.
International relations was the
theme around which the President's
inaugural address centered. The part
which America has taken in helping
Europe is consistent with the way in
which America is inspiring humanity.
A conservative note was struck by
the President when he emphasized the
necessity of learning by the past, and
the caution with which we should look
upon new structures too rapidly re
placing the old. American life and in
stitutions must be safeguarded. The
dignity of a great people is necessary
to the common brotherhood of human
ity, he said.
Favors Arbitration
Coolidge definitely stated that he
was in favor of arbitration and that
much might be expected from interna
tional law. An understanding between
nations should be the concern of
America, yet implication in old-world
struggles is not necessarily inevitable.
At several points during the speech
the President was interrupted by
liearty applause.
This is the first time the inaugural
oath has been administered by an ex- j
president. When Coolidge last took J
the oath it was under very different j
circumstances. The news of the death I
of President Harding reached him at j
the Coolidge farm in Vermont, where i
the oath was administered by his fath-1
er on August 23, 1923. The same bible
was used in both ceremonies, being
brought to Washington for this occa
sion.
Speech Relayed
More than twenty radio stations 1
ranging across the continent between
Washington and San Francisco co-'
operated in relaying the inaugural,
exercises over the United States. An
announcer located on the east front
steps of the capitol, where a large of
ficial platform was built described the
proceedings.
Professors Ryan and Henline oper
ated the receiving set, getting the pro
gram as broadcasted from KPO.
Following a group of folk songs, the
announcer described the inauguration
crowd as consisting of 100,000 souls.
Counting Democrats, the audience
must easily have been 100,053, accord
ing to local political experts.
Chief Justice Taft administered the
oath following a selection by the Ma
rine Band, and after this ceremony
the President delivered his inaugural
address.
Static Strong
President Coolidge's voice was re
ceived fairly audibly during the first
part of his speech, but later static
interrupted the Stanford program. The
substance of what the President said,
as printed above, has been accepted
as reliable from several listeners re
porting proceedings from near the
stage.
In the back of the Assembly hall the
President's speech was heard to be:

"Mmnmmm mnnblbnnnali. (Applause).
Shirk ork. Whooooee!"
President Coolidge Beemed to go on
to elaborate, "Blblblblbumnmn wonk
wonk mnmnmnah. (Applause) Scaawk
waaaa mnmnmnah."
Following this the parade com
menced.
