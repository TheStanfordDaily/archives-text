# SENIOR BALL SQUAD DOWNS SOPHOMORES 6-4 IN RAGGED GAME
## 
### 
Staging a fierce last-inning batting
rally, the seniors pounded out five runs
and defeated the sophomore nine 6 to 4
in a ragged interclass game yesterday.
Both teams threw the ball around
the lot somewhat wildly, and most of
the scoring came as the result tof
errors. The seniors had the better in
dividual players, but the sophomores
worked more smoothly as a unit.
"Lefty" May and Bob Baillard scored
runs in the first inning for '25 and '27
respectively, on walks and errors.
Baillard Knocks Homer
Manager Sheets gave the sophs an
other tally in the third when he col
lected on a clean three-bagger and
was brought in by Baillard's sacrifice
fly. A pass to first and more ragged
fielding resulted in a third run for the
"last years" in the fourth, and Bail
lard's homer in the fifth made the
count 4 to 1.
Murray, sophomore pitcher, held the
seniors in check until the sixth. Tre
maine and Heckendorf, the first two
men up, hit singles. The seniors then
re-arranged their batting order so that
their heavy hitters could get in with
deadly work, with the result that five
runs came across the plate in rapid
succession. "Red" Maillot starred in
the last-minute attack with two safe
blows.
Cliff Hey started on the mound for
the seniors and pitched a good brand
of ball, though he received poor sup
port. After Baillard knocked his home
run in the fifth Hey retired in favor
of Sandys, who lasted half an inning.
