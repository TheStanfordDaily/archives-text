# J. MANLY TALKS ON EDUCATION OF TODAY
## Lecturer Says That Modern Systems of Teaching Lack Efficiency 
### 
| "Modern education is a chaos of
! new knowledge, forces, and ideas,"
said Professor J. M. Manly, head of
the Department of English at the Uni
versity of Chicago, in his lecture on
"Education that Educates" last night
in the Little Theatre.
"No system of education since that
of the primitive man has had a high
percentage of efficiency. With the
growing complexity of life under civili
zation the world of knowledge is
larger for the educated man than it
was for his forefathers and his period
of infancy, or preparation for life, be
comes correspondingly longer.
"All this is deplorable but not to be
remedied by increasing the period of
infancy. A genesis of the great inven
tions and thoughts in history will dis
cover them to have been conceived by
men below the age of thirty." Manly
went on to say that any system of
education which fills these years with
the routine acquisition of knowledge
to the exclusion of productive think
ing is exceedingly dangerous to the
individual and to the race.
Manly suggested three ways by
which the situation could be met and
the period shortened: first, by the ap
plication of mental tests to children
and plans made for special training
suited to their mentality; second, by
a system of teaching by advice and
supervision instead of by stuffing with
predigested knowledge; and third, by
an attitude of interest and enthusiasm
on the part of the pupil.
"Interest and enthusiasm are the
secrets of learning, and the modern
system of education tends to destroy
them. One of the most hopeful things
about education is that, so far, no one
has been able to devise a system which
can quite defeat the native intelligence
of the human mind."
