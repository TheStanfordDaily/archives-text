# INTRAMURAL ENTRIES IN BASEBALL LEAGUE TO CLOSE MARCH 10
## 
### 
Charles W. Davis, the director of
Intramural Athletics, today issued a
call for a meeting of representatives
from all intramural groups intending
to enter teams in the Intramural Base
ball League, Thursday afternoon at
4:30 in the Intramural office. Certain
rules and plans for the schedules will
be discussed.
The intramural groups consist of
fraternities, eating clubs, halls, and
independent or off-campus teams.
Should any other group such as the
colleges or special departments in the
University wish to enter teams in the
league, its entry will be permitted.
Entries close Tuesday, March 10,
and because of the details to be
worked out in connection with plan
ning the schedule, all entries must be
in on time. Hall groups are especially
urged to get their entries in early.
Play will start the first or second week
of next quarter.
Last spring quarter thirty-eight
teams organized to play through a
schedule, and this year a similar con
dition is expected. Kappa Sigma
Rained the University championship
last year, and the other league win
ners were El Cuadro, Theta Xi, Phi
Sigma Kappa, El Tigre, and Sequoia
First.
