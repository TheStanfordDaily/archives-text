(This is the second of a series of
articles dealing with the division made
of incidental fees charged each student
registering in the University.)
Two dollars of the incidental fee
paid by each undergraduate as he
registers each quarter goes to pay his
dues for the Students' Guild. 11l stu
dents who have been placed in the
isolation hospital maintained by the
University, or in the Palo Alto hos
pital, benefit from the organization.
The isolation hospital, situated near
the old stone quarry, is maintained be
cause no contagious cases may be
moved from Stanford into towns or
cities.
No hospital personnel is maintained
there except a caretaker for the
j grounds and building. Trained nurses
ore brought to the hospital when cases
are being treated. All ambulance
charges and costs of regular nurse
sorvice for these cases are paid by

the Guild. Special nurses' board and
fees, however, are paid by the students
receiving the benefits.
In event of illness, which may be
treated at the Palo Alto hospital, the
Guild advances two dollars per day
toward ward or private room charges,
and also pays for the doctor's hospital
visits on medical cases, for the first
week, provided that the cost does not
exceed $15.
Cases requiring surgical operations
receive twenty-five per cent of the
cost of the operating fees provided the
cost is not greater than one hundred
dollars. The Guild also pays for labor
atory fees, anaesthetics and operating
charges, and doctor's rhnrces for ap
plying casts in cases of fracture.
Students, whether at the isolation or
the Palo Alto Hospital, are to pny for
all rxtra charges such as drugs and
dressings.
