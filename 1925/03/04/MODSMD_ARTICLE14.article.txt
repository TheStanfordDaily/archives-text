# SIGMA DELTA CHI GIVES DANCING FETE SATURDAY
## 
### 
Members of Sigma Delta Chi will
| wash the ink from their hands, brush
I the crumbs of Durham from their
| vests, and participate in an all-comers
dancing carnival at the Women's Club
house Saturday night. Friends, rela
times and creditors of the boy report
ers are also invited to attend, at one
and one-tenth dollars per attendance.
Now it is said that some of the
demon reporters toss a wicked hoof as
well as rattling a mean Underwood, al
though those members who have not
stepped out since Cleveland's inaugu
ral ball (courtesy of the press), should
furnish amusement for the roughs and
participants.
It is reported that the sudden flare
of the journalistic clan into the lime
light of society is due to the influx of
young blood, which has overruled the
former policy of the body that a jour
nalist's place is in the foam.
