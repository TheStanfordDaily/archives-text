# CARD PUGILISTS WILL MEET DAVIS SATURDAY
## 
### 
The Stanford boxing team meets the
California Aggie fighters in a return
meet in the pavilion at 8 o'clock Sat
urday night. The Davis Farm team had
the edge on the Cardinals when they
fought two weeks ago, but Harry Ma
loney is confident that the decision
will be reversed Saturday.
Practically the same lineup will be
used as in the previous bouts, with the
exception of the lightweight and mid
dleweight divisions. Gleam Feeley will
fight in the 135-pound class and Bert
Simmons will take care of the heavy
event.
Feeley and Simmons both fought in
the novice tournament, when they both
did exceptionally good fighting to win
the championship in their weights.
Raff is also working out in the light
weight division and will have a chance
to box in the match with Southern
Branch, University of California. Since
Arthur is now spending most of his
time on the track Simmons will
probably participate in the majority
of the remaining' bouts.
Collins, bantamweight, Miron, feath
erweight, Captain Martin, welter
weight, Schall, middleweight, and
Farmin, light-heavyweight, form the
remainder of the team to fight Davis.
All of these men performed well in
the first fights of the season.
The Aggies have a strong squad,
headed by Mielile, Pacific intercollegi
ate champion, but in a match with
California the Bears were able to
score a win over Davis Farm.
