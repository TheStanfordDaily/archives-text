# MATINEE TOMORROW FIRST PRESENTATION OF CLASSIC TRAGEDY
## Final Rehearsal Is Scheduled For This Evening in Assembly Hall 
### Wilbur Adams 
"Macbeth," as produced by the Eng
lish Club, will be presented in the
Assembly hall tomorrow afternoon.
This matinee is offered mainly for the
benefit of students of nearby high
schools and those who may not be
able to attend the regular performance
Friday night. The final dress rehearsal
will commence at 7 o'clock tonight.
The first dress rehearsal last night
was made conspicuous by the few er
rors and blunders on the part of the
actors and actresses. The whole play
was acted, each scene being given as
it will be presented Friday night. Tech
nical mistakes were the only faults
found by Gordon Davis in last night's
practice.
The settings and lighting effects will
be the most elaborate that have ever
been seen on a Stanford stage. The
new drapes that were purchased by
the dramatic council have enabled Les
Kiler to design many original sets.
"Macbeth" will be given in twelve
scenes and only two of these are the
same. The sets were changed rapidly
and flawlessly last night.
Hume West is in charge of the light
ing arrangements, and the coloring of
the scenery and stage. He has worked
up some remarkable effects.
The characters have perfected their
acting so that last night's rehearsal
was a great improvement over the
practices of last week. With two more
rehearsals before the final night of the
show, the players should be at ease
before the large audience that is an
ticipated for the opening night.
Robert Carr plays the part of
Banquo with the enthusiasm that is
characteristic of a good actor. The role
of Malcolm is also done well by Fen
ton Barrett. Barrett, a member of the
freshman class, is just starting his col
lege dramatic career. William Thorn
ton, who is playing the part of Ross,
is also a freshman.
The work last night of Delmer
Daves, Helen Feldman, Ray Riese, and
James Du Prau, who are carrying the
main leads, was particularly encourag
ing. Tonight's rehearsal will go
through without a stop. It will be run
off in the same order that it will be
given on the night of the show.
