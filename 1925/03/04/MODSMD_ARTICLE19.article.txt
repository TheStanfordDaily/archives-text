# '28 SWIMMERS SET FOR CALIFORNIANS
## 
### 
j Working out nightly with the varsity
I swimmers the Cardinal freshmen are
getting what appears to be a strong
i team into shape for the meet with the
j California babes next Saturday.
Coach Brandsten has been holding
I competitions for the various events on
the program throughout the past week.
Material that has shown up recently
has disclosed a few good men while
the freshmen who competed in the
P. A. A. junior events in January will
probably make up the bulk of the
team.
Danford, in swimming the 50- and
100-yard free style events, has shown
speed in the former event that com
pares favorably with some varsity
times. Danford has been timed in :26
and 1:01 in these events.
Vanden Akker, 220-yard free-style
j man, turns in 2:47 for his event and,
| according to Brandsten, will go under
that time Saturday.
In the diving and plunge events the
1928 men are represented by two per
; formers of rare ability. Tormey
! plunges 65 feet, which is within a foot
of the distances turned in by varsity
plungers. Mills, a former Berkeley
High school performer, will bear the
brunt of the diving.
While Brandsten does not look for
the shattering of any freshman records
he nevertheless has built up an all
round team capable of earning points
in practically every event.
