# Rushing Rules and Principles
## 
### 
Several recent events have directed the attention of the campus toward
Encina hall. Perhaps the most interesting news affecting the freshmen
which has come up since the.end of their victorious basketball season, is the
announcement of the proposed rushing rules.
For many years attempts have been made to regulate this activity with
an eye to being fair to everyone on the campus. It is considered import
ant that new men become fully accustomed to and appreciative of Stanford
and its values before identifying themselves with any of the many campus
groups. It is judged to be only fair to the freshman that he have a full
knowledge of what he is about to do before he affiliates himself with any
organization.
With this end in view, the Administration has required the classes of
1927 and 1928 to live together during their freshman years in Encina.
Pledging has been set at the latest possible date in order to allow class
spirit to become as strong as possible, unhindered by the distraction of a
rushing season, on the theory that the class good-rfellowship developed
during this year will last regardless of subsequent events.
Rushing rules have had to be developed to conform to these ends. It
is the purpose of these rules to give every fraternity, save the eating clubs,
which correspond to local fraternities elsewhere but which are not regu
lated here, an equal chance to perpetuate itself. What disadvantages the
system may have so far as the fraternities are concerned, have been dis
regarded. And there arc disadvantages.
That there are drawbacks affecting the freshmen, too, may or may not
be true. At any rate, the regulated rushing system and required residence
rules have effected the condition for which they were instituted. The
1927 class has shown itself to be different from previous ones in having a
stronger class spirit. More than any other class in college, the sophomores
are above factional cleavage.
What is largely a myth to the present freshmen will probably show
itself to be an unpleasant reality next year. The bogey of hall-row antag
onism will be held up to them and strenuously urged. This feeling shows
itself most obviously in politics and it is political evidence which encour
ages the idea that the present sophomores are governed by bigger prin
ciples.
In the last election there were four men who happened to live on the
row and one man who happened to live in the hall who were competing for
the same office. Nobody received a majority. In spite of factional at
tempts to stampede votes by means of the alleged hall-row bitterness, the
five men polled votes which were of very nearly the same size. One row
man and one hall man ran the second time. Again the margin was narrow
—four votes. Who was elected makes no difference. If there were any
thing in the hall-row myth, such a situation would never have occurred.
The freedom of opinion of the sophomores influenced the entire elec
tion. What campaigning was done included halls and houses alike and
showed results in both places. The row did not vote row and the hall did
not vote hall.
We are pleased to believe that the year's residence together makes for
classes free from factional rancor. If this is true —that the present system
discourages the unpleasantness of hall-row mistrust—we believe that these
principles are proper and that those who are inconvenienced should make
the best of it for the common good.
Whether or not the details of the rules are the best, care should be
taken to preserve the general scheme when and if the rules are revised.

THREE BIRD-BANDING traps belonging to the station which is
operated here in connection with the United States Biological Survey are
reported as having been stolen and one quail net has deliberately been de
stroyed, according to the Zoology Department. It is the belief of the men
in charge of this government work, that the damage is being done by
children playing on the campus.
The department points out that the banding is being done to obtain
knowledge in order to aid the birds rather than to injure them. Students
might cooperate by helping the banders to care for their equipment when
ever possible.

STAFF MEETING tomorrow at 1:10 o'clock. The Quad photo
grapher will make his final appearance before the staff.

spirit to become as strong as possible, unhindered by the distraction of a
rushing season, on the theory that the class good-rfellowship developed
during this year will last regardless of subsequent events.
Rushing rules have had to be developed to conform to these ends. It
is the purpose of these rules to give every fraternity, save the eating clubs,
which correspond to local fraternities elsewhere but which are not regu
lated here, an equal chance to perpetuate itself. What disadvantages the
system may have so far as the fraternities are concerned, have been dis
regarded. And there arc disadvantages.
That there are drawbacks affecting the freshmen, too, may or may not
be true. At any rate, the regulated rushing system and required residence
rules have effected the condition for which they were instituted. The
1927 class has shown itself to be different from previous ones in having a
stronger class spirit. More than any other class in college, the sophomores
are above factional cleavage.
What is largely a myth to the present freshmen will probably show
itself to be an unpleasant reality next year. The bogey of hall-row antag
onism will be held up to them and strenuously urged. This feeling shows
itself most obviously in politics and it is political evidence which encour
ages the idea that the present sophomores are governed by bigger prin
ciples.
In the last election there were four men who happened to live on the
row and one man who happened to live in the hall who were competing for
the same office. Nobody received a majority. In spite of factional at
tempts to stampede votes by means of the alleged hall-row bitterness, the
five men polled votes which were of very nearly the same size. One row
man and one hall man ran the second time. Again the margin was narrow
—four votes. Who was elected makes no difference. If there were any
thing in the hall-row myth, such a situation would never have occurred.
The freedom of opinion of the sophomores influenced the entire elec
tion. What campaigning was done included halls and houses alike and
showed results in both places. The row did not vote row and the hall did
not vote hall.
We are pleased to believe that the year's residence together makes for
classes free from factional rancor. If this is true —that the present system
discourages the unpleasantness of hall-row mistrust—we believe that these
principles are proper and that those who are inconvenienced should make
the best of it for the common good.
Whether or not the details of the rules are the best, care should be
taken to preserve the general scheme when and if the rules are revised.

THREE BIRD-BANDING traps belonging to the station which is
operated here in connection with the United States Biological Survey are
reported as having been stolen and one quail net has deliberately been de
stroyed, according to the Zoology Department. It is the belief of the men
in charge of this government work, that the damage is being done by
children playing on the campus.
The department points out that the banding is being done to obtain
knowledge in order to aid the birds rather than to injure them. Students
might cooperate by helping the banders to care for their equipment when
ever possible.

STAFF MEETING tomorrow at 1:10 o'clock. The Quad photo

Several recent events have directed the attention of the campus toward
Encina hall. Perhaps the most interesting news affecting the freshmen
which has come up since the.end of their victorious basketball season, is the
announcement of the proposed rushing rules.
For many years attempts have been made to regulate this activity with
an eye to being fair to everyone on the campus. It is considered import
ant that new men become fully accustomed to and appreciative of Stanford
and its values before identifying themselves with any of the many campus
groups. It is judged to be only fair to the freshman that he have a full
knowledge of what he is about to do before he affiliates himself with any
organization.
With this end in view, the Administration has required the classes of
1927 and 1928 to live together during their freshman years in Encina.
Pledging has been set at the latest possible date in order to allow class
