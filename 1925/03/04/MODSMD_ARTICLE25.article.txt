# CABBAGES and THINGS
## 
### Steve O'Donnell 
The difficulty with the quarterly
faculty offensive is that It lacks or
ganization. Each Prof plots by himself
the best manner of attacking his op
ponent, the student. In order to bind
the forces of pedagogy more closely
together, Cabbages wishes to suggest
a yell, which may best be rendered
by the entire faculty group:
Give 'em the Ex! The Ex! The Ex!
Give 'em the Ex! The Ex! The Ex!
Give 'em the Ex! The Ex! The Ex!
Give 'em the Ex!
Where?
Right in the neck! The neck! The neck!
Right in the neck! The neck! The neck!
Right in the neck! The neck! The neck!
Right in the neck!
There! —M. M. K.
HAPPY DOG
At sundry times I've envied kings,
Ballplayers, millionaires and things,
But when I hear Professor Moss
I know that's all applesauce.
While he's intoning his rendition,
To be a dog is my ambition.
Ah! would I were a measly cur
With lolling tongue and mangy fur.
I'd crawl around from seat to seat
And scuff the shoes on people's feet.
I'd punctuate the Prof't remarks
By howls and whinings, yelps and barks'.
The classroom slumbers I would flout,
And then, I hope, they'd put me out.
—J. M. H.
