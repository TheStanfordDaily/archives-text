# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
The ardent "Dink '28" offered ub a
rather startling ultimatum in a view
point Friday. Dinks should either be
worn or discarded, according to this
loyal frosh.
Well, for goodness' sake, discard
them! The number wearing them show
unmistakably the number who want to
wear them. And if only fifty fellows out
of five hundred, a tenth of the class,
want to wear them, it is not a suffi
ciently popular movement to be con
tinued.
As for the traditional phase of the
matter, don't let that worry you; it's
just as easy to abolish dinks as it is
the baseball fight and Roughs' Day
and a host of others.
Also, I don't think we have to bother
ourselves at all over frosh being mis
taken for sophs. It's too obvious.
â€”XYZ.
