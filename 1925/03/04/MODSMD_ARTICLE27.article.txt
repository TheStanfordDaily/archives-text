# PATRICK NAMED ON RUGBY SELECTIONS
## 
### 
Jack Patrick, former captain of the
Stanford football team and a member
of the Olympic champion rugby team
last year, was the only American
represented on an all-star team chosen
by Gaston Benac, a French football
expert.
Benac named a team from through
out the world, which he thought likely
to beat the New Zealand All-Blacks.
Patrick was chosen as one of the
forwards of the team. Nine English
men, nine Frenchmen, two Welshmen,
two Scotchmen, and two Irishmen
made up the remainder of the squad
of twenty-five players.
