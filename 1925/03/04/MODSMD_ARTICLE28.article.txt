# Horseshoe Pitching Round Started by Sequoia Men
## 
### 
The first round of the Sequoia horse
shoe pitching tournament will be
played this week on the Sequoia Hall
grounds. Twenty men have entered
the contest which is being run off
under the direction of Harold Preston.
All matches must be played before
Sunday night, and the rules will be
the same as the national tournament
regulations. Some excellent material is
expected to be developed and Sequoia
claims to have the best barnyard golf
devotees on the campus.
