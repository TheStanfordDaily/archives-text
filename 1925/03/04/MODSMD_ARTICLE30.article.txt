(A Continued Story)

Third Installment
Wednesday found Silas astride Cot
ton, slowly, but surely, clumping his
way towards the Millisack Department
Store. Obviously, Mr. Gibbs no
mean mission, for he seldom rode Cot
ton unless there was something of un
usual importance to be attended to.
"Well, what kin I do fer you?" It
was Cassius Millisack, the breezy pro
prietor of Falcon's leading general
store. He had seen Silas come in the
door, and had hastened forward as best
he couJd to greet the newcomer. Mr.
Millisack was over sixty, and troubled
with rheumatism.
"Good marnin', Cassius. I ain't buyin'
nothin' perticlar. Jest dropped in t'
look aroun- a bit," was the slow reply.
"Got a mighty nice bunch o' fresh
stuff in this mornin' —like t' look over
some real lettuce?" Cassius winked
slyly at the freckled Min Slater, who
stood slouching behind the delapidated
counter. He had built up a reputation
as a wit among the matrons who did
their trading at the Millisack place of
business, and evidently he was going
to treat Silas to a sample of it.
"Well, I don't mind, Cassius, but I
jest came from my own lettuce patch,
an' I don't reckon yew got anything t'
beat it."
Cassius laughed hollowly. Min
jammed a cookie into her mouth to
keep from disgracing herself before
her employer.
"Well, jest as you say, o' course, 1
ain't insistin'. By the way, I hear
Kelly is gonn a make yuh cut out sellin'
stuff." Cassius would have his fun, and
since the lettuce hadn't succeeded too
well, he had launched forth on a new
line of attack.
"Uh huh," was the only reply.
"Sorry t' hear that, Silas; sorry t'
hear it." The smirk on Millisack's face
gave him away.
"Yes, I know ye must be, Cassius."
Silas had a disconcerting manner.
"What's that?" Obviously, Mr. Gibbs
hadn't made the desired comeback.
"Oh, ye ain't foolin' me none! I
kno wye don't like me, an' as fer 8s
that goes I ain't carin' neither!" Silas
was beginning to warm up to the oc
casion.
Millisack blinked. He wanted to say
something clever, but it just wouldn't
come. "Have a cheroot, Silas, have a
cheroot." This was a little weak, but
it was the best he could do under the
circumstances. Cassius held out a
black cigar.
"I ain't smokin' jest now," was the
answer. Millisack hurriedly replaced
the stogie in his pocket.
The silence which had come over
the two like a cloud was broken by the

rasping voice of Stella Hale, the book
keeper. "Do yuh want this money
banked at th' First National er th'
Farmer's, Mr. Millisack?"
"Why—er—er— take it to the Farm
er's." Cassius eyed Silas keenly and
found the man intent on giving his
feet a careful examination. The situa
tion' was awkward, to say the least,
and Cassius wanted to end it.
"Well, I must be goin' now. Got a
new shipment o' hats in this mornin'
an' I gotta look 'em over." The mer
chant began to sidle away. "Minnie!
Minnie,! Come here an' wait on Mr.
Gibbs!" Millisack tottered towards the
back of the store, and Silas made for
the door.

"Sorry t' hear that, Silas; sorry t'
hear it." The smirk on Millisack's face
gave him away.
"Yes, I know ye must be, Cassius."
Silas had a disconcerting manner.
"What's that?" Obviously, Mr. Gibbs
hadn't made the desired comeback.
"Oh, ye ain't foolin' me none! I
kno wye don't like me, an' as fer 8s
that goes I ain't carin' neither!" Silas
was beginning to warm up to the oc
casion.
Millisack blinked. He wanted to say
something clever, but it just wouldn't
come. "Have a cheroot, Silas, have a
cheroot." This was a little weak, but
it was the best he could do under the
circumstances. Cassius held out a
black cigar.
"I ain't smokin' jest now," was the
answer. Millisack hurriedly replaced
the stogie in his pocket.
The silence which had come over
the two like a cloud was broken by the

rasping voice of Stella Hale, the book
keeper. "Do yuh want this money
banked at th' First National er th'
Farmer's, Mr. Millisack?"
"Why—er—er— take it to the Farm
er's." Cassius eyed Silas keenly and
found the man intent on giving his
feet a careful examination. The situa
tion' was awkward, to say the least,
and Cassius wanted to end it.
"Well, I must be goin' now. Got a
new shipment o' hats in this mornin'
an' I gotta look 'em over." The mer
chant began to sidle away. "Minnie!
Minnie,! Come here an' wait on Mr.
Gibbs!" Millisack tottered towards the
back of the store, and Silas made for
the door.

Third Installment
Wednesday found Silas astride Cot
ton, slowly, but surely, clumping his
way towards the Millisack Department
Store. Obviously, Mr. Gibbs no
mean mission, for he seldom rode Cot
ton unless there was something of un
usual importance to be attended to.
"Well, what kin I do fer you?" It
was Cassius Millisack, the breezy pro
prietor of Falcon's leading general
store. He had seen Silas come in the
door, and had hastened forward as best
he couJd to greet the newcomer. Mr.
Millisack was over sixty, and troubled
with rheumatism.
"Good marnin', Cassius. I ain't buyin'
nothin' perticlar. Jest dropped in t'
look aroun- a bit," was the slow reply.
"Got a mighty nice bunch o' fresh
stuff in this mornin' —like t' look over
some real lettuce?" Cassius winked
slyly at the freckled Min Slater, who
stood slouching behind the delapidated
counter. He had built up a reputation
as a wit among the matrons who did
their trading at the Millisack place of
business, and evidently he was going
to treat Silas to a sample of it.
"Well, I don't mind, Cassius, but I
jest came from my own lettuce patch,
an' I don't reckon yew got anything t'
beat it."
Cassius laughed hollowly. Min
jammed a cookie into her mouth to
keep from disgracing herself before
her employer.
"Well, jest as you say, o' course, 1
ain't insistin'. By the way, I hear
Kelly is gonn a make yuh cut out sellin'
stuff." Cassius would have his fun, and
since the lettuce hadn't succeeded too
well, he had launched forth on a new
line of attack.
"Uh huh," was the only reply.
"Sorry t' hear that, Silas; sorry t'
hear it." The smirk on Millisack's face
gave him away.
"Yes, I know ye must be, Cassius."
Silas had a disconcerting manner.
"What's that?" Obviously, Mr. Gibbs
