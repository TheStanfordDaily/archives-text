# 1926 FAVORED TO WIN IN CLASS TRACK MEET
## 
### 
Odds favor the class of 1926 to win
the interclass track meet on the old
track Saturday at 1:30 p.m. With a
ten-point lead gained by a first in the
Irish Marathon last week and a host
of sure first-place men, the juniors
should have little trouble in finishing
ahead of the other three classes.
Coach "Dink" Templeton's primary
purpose in holding the annual inter
class meet Is to gain a line on pro
spective times for his varsity and
freshman squads. Previously, in the
two preliminary meets, only three
fourths distances have been run and
Saturday will be the first test of the
Card runners at full distances.
From the results of practice times
the past week it is possible that a
number of good records will be turned
in.
Miller is going even better than he
did last year in the 440 i and will un
doubtedly touch :49 2-5. He, with
Richardson, Kerr, and Gaspar, should
account for at least 25 points. Compe
tition for second and third places in
the quarter will be keen between Bab
cock, Garthwaite, Doerr, and Rich
mann, sophomores; and McGuire and
Borden, freshmen.
Gaspar is Templeton's star sprinter
this year, now that Campbell's work
outs are hindered by weak arches, and
should take two firsts in the century
and furlong. His time of :10 1-10 in
the hundred two weeks ago was good
for this time of year and it is possible
that he will lower it to :10 flat Satur
day.
Captain "Tiny" Hartranft has been
occupying most of his time with the
weights but tries an occasional hun
dred, and Templeton may enter him in
that event. Several years ago the big
fellow did around :10 consistently and
he may work back into that form this
year. Adams, who was shifted from
the sprints to the quarter and is now
back with the former, and McDougall,
regularly a miler, will sprint for the
sophomores; and Worthington, McCall,
