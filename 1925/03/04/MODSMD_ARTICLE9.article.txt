# STANFORD SWIMMING TEAM MEETS U.C. NEXT
## Three Veterans With 1927 Performers Train for Saturday's Races 
### Fred Speers 
Fans expect Coach Brandsten to
: have another winning swimming team,
for three veterans from last year's
i varsity squad and a group of point
winners from the 1927 team form the
bulk of this year's Cardinal swimming
team.
Dave Fall, who won the national low
board diving title last year, and Mike
Gibbons, holder of the Pacific Coast
championship in the same event, both
compete for the Stanford varsity this
year. Brandsten counts on eight points
from these men.
With men like those to replace A1
White and Fletcher, and Allen fitting
into the racing events where O'Connor
once was supreme, Coach Brandsten's
squad begins to take on the appear
ance of possessing as much power as
the record-breaking outfit of last year.
Practices for the coming meet with
California next Saturday have un
covered some fast times. Allen has
been swimming the 100-yard back
stroke two or three seconds under the
Stanford-California record of 1:13.
Another speedster is Stevenson from
last year's freshman team. He spe
cializes in the 220-yard free style, hav
ing won that event in the babe meet
with the Bears. In that race he clocked
in 2:48, now he is swimming the
distance in time ten seconds better.
Five varsity members are on the
list for the relay team and Brandsten
is yet undecided which four he will
pick. Williams, Doerr, Schwartz, Allen,
and McCallister are those who are
still in the running for this event.
Races against time by various com
binations from these men have re
sulted quite favorably and in a couple
of instances Brandsten has clocked
them in time better than 1:06 4-5, the
Bear-Card record.
Besides these flashes there is a
dozen of swimmers, the majority of
whom can be counted on for a point

or more, that are fast getting into
shape. Captain Schmeider and Pyzel
are swimming their event, the 100-
yard breaststroke, almost neck and
neck.
The stellar freshman team from last
year, which trimmed their Bruin babe
rivals by a 59 to 9 count has contributed
a good share of the varsity material
for Saturday's meet.

The University of Oklahoma is build
ing a radio station which will cost
$15,000.
