What
THE DANGER LINE
means to you
If you will look in a mirror, you will see a 0
tiny V-shaped crevice around each tooth
where it joins the gums. This is The Danger
Line. Food particles lodge there and ferment,
forming acids which lead to Acid Decay. The
gums also suffer from the effect of these acids,
becoming irritated and sore —perhaps reced
ing from the teeth. Then you have conditions
favorable to Pyorrhea.
Serious diseases often result from infection
due to Acid Decay at The Danger Line.
Heart and kidney trouble and rheumatism
are among them.
