# SPECIAL FOUNDERS' DAY CONCERT GIVEN ON MONDAY EVENING
## Eighty-Five Musicians to Be Brought to Campus by Alfred Hertz 
### 
The San Francisco Symphony Or
chestra will give a special Founders'
Day concert at 8 o'clock next Monday
evening in the Memorial Church. Al
fred Hertz, conductor, will bring his
entire orchestra of 85 men down for
the occasion.
This is the second time that the
Symphony orchestra has played in the
church on Founders' Day. The Senior
Class will attend in a body, seated in
the chancel, to pay their collective
tribute of respect to the Founders. The
day now celebrated is Mr. Stanford's
birthday, the custom beginning after
his death. At first the birthday of
JLeland Stanford Junior was kept, but
it was Mrs. Stanford's wish that the
change be made.
The program will include several of
the most beautiful sacred composi
tions, prominent among which will be
a symphony by Cesar Franck, and a
suite by Gluck, arranged by Gevaert.
The famous Prelude to Parsifal, by
Wagner, will be the most important
number on the program. This selection
is one of the most popular orchestral
numbers ever written.
