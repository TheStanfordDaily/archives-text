# STANFORD POLOISTS BEAT PRESIDIO FOUR IN EXTRA CHUKKER
## Captain Hudgins Ties Score By Making Hard Shot in Sixth Period 
### 
Johnny Irwin's goal in the extra
! period yesterday broke a 6 to 6 tie and
gave the Stanford polo four a one
goal win over the Thirtieth Infantry
team, in a game played on the highway
field. The win gives the Cards the
three games.
The game was close and hard-fought
throughout. Stanford led for five
periods, but the army men tied the
score in the sixth and final chukker
when Hudgins broke away from the
field and carried the ball down the field
for a goal.
It was agreed that an extra five
minute period be played, and that the
team scoring first should win the
match. Early in the period Trotter's
hard drive came within inches of
breaking the tie, and a few moments
later Irwin broke up the game.
For Stanford, Irwin and Fred Trot
ter were the outstanding stars. The
riding of Irwin, playing No. 2, was
exceptionally good, and Trotter's ex
perience showed up well.
Hudgins, of the visitors, starred by
scoring five of the six goals made by
the army men.
The Infantry team has been re
organized since the last game played
here several weeks ago, and the un
expected strength of the remade team
came near to upsetting Card hopes of
victory.
The lineup was as follows:
30th Infantry Stanford
Hudgins 1 Thomas, Krohn
Dulaney 2 Irwin
Beatty 3 Laub, Dorcy
Scott 4 Trotter
Umpireâ€”Col. Hennessy, Field Artil
ler, Retired.
