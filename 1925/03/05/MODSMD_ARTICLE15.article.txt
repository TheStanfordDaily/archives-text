# LEISTNER MAY RUN DASHES FOR 1925 IN CLASS TRACK MEET
## 
### 
Hugo Leistner, strongest Card pros
i pect In the hurdles, may run the 100
i and 220 for the seniors in the inter
| class meet Saturday. Leistner has de
, veloped along sprinting lines this sea
i son and Templeton may try him
against Gaspar, '26, in case sprinters
are scarce.
Leistner's certain ten points in the
high and low hurdles, and a possible
three points in the hundred, will raise
the seniors' chances. His nearest com
petitor will be Nichols, '28, who has
been following him closely in both
highs and lows the past few weeks.
The freshmen also have Bly and Bul
lis, who may account for third place.
It is in the field events that the 1926
team, favorites to win, are the weak
est. Captain Hartranft will give the
seniors ten points in the discus and
shot, but there are no junior pros
pects for second places. Evans, '27,
will probably enter both events and
should give a good fight for second in
the discus. Grey, '28, and Weaver, *28,
will enter the discus for the freshmen.
Richards, '25, and Jergins, *27, will
also compete in the shot.
With Dennis and Philip Scofield, pole
vault veterans, gone, Templeton is
scouting for prospects in that event.
So far, the chief contender is Gene
Scofield, who is doing around 11 feet.
Fontaine, a transfer and not eligible
for varsity, has been showing good
form and should gain a few points
for the sophomores, while Pallette, '27,
and Nichols, '28, are also entered.
Work, '27, will be the center of in
terest in the high jump. His best mark
this season is 6 feet 2 5-8 inches but
he may do better Saturday. Rupe and
King, '28, and Crookshank and West,
'27, will give him competition.
Evers, '26, should give the juniors
five points in the javelin since he has i
had little competition so far this year.
Shipkey, '27, and Anderson, '27, have
both been occupied with basketball
and will not be up to the form they j
displayed last year.

'27, will give him competition.
Evers, '26, should give the juniors
five points in the javelin since he has i
had little competition so far this year.
Shipkey, '27, and Anderson, '27, have
both been occupied with basketball
and will not be up to the form they j
displayed last year.
Hugo Leistner, strongest Card pros
i pect In the hurdles, may run the 100
i and 220 for the seniors in the inter
| class meet Saturday. Leistner has de
, veloped along sprinting lines this sea
i son and Templeton may try him
against Gaspar, '26, in case sprinters
are scarce.
Leistner's certain ten points in the
high and low hurdles, and a possible
three points in the hundred, will raise
the seniors' chances. His nearest com
petitor will be Nichols, '28, who has
been following him closely in both
highs and lows the past few weeks.
The freshmen also have Bly and Bul
lis, who may account for third place.
It is in the field events that the 1926
team, favorites to win, are the weak
est. Captain Hartranft will give the
seniors ten points in the discus and
shot, but there are no junior pros
pects for second places. Evans, '27,
will probably enter both events and
should give a good fight for second in
the discus. Grey, '28, and Weaver, *28,
will enter the discus for the freshmen.
Richards, '25, and Jergins, *27, will
also compete in the shot.
With Dennis and Philip Scofield, pole
vault veterans, gone, Templeton is
scouting for prospects in that event.
So far, the chief contender is Gene
Scofield, who is doing around 11 feet.
Fontaine, a transfer and not eligible
for varsity, has been showing good
form and should gain a few points
for the sophomores, while Pallette, '27,
and Nichols, '28, are also entered.
Work, '27, will be the center of in
terest in the high jump. His best mark
this season is 6 feet 2 5-8 inches but
he may do better Saturday. Rupe and
King, '28, and Crookshank and West,
'27, will give him competition.
Evers, '26, should give the juniors
five points in the javelin since he has i
had little competition so far this year.
Shipkey, '27, and Anderson, '27, have
both been occupied with basketball
and will not be up to the form they j
displayed last year.
