Campus telephones have all been
equipped with cards on which is print
ed in red ink: "In case of fire, call 2
or P. A. 1666."
This precaution is only one of many

bility of destruction of University
buildings by fire.
Students living in fraternities and
halls have again been requested to
prevent the accumulation of inbam
mable rubbish in their rooms.
