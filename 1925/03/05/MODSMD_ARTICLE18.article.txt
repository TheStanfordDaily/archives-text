### 
In spite of the fact that they were
i outhit, the Olympics defeated the Stan
ford baseball team, 6 to 2, on the
varsity diamond yesterday afternoon.
By scoring once in the second in
ning, the varsity gained a lead until

On the batting end the Cardinals
kept up the precedent set in the Santa

safe blows would have meant runs cost
Stanford the game. In the first the
Cards had three men on and one out,
but Cuddeback's strike-out and
Brown's fly to short got the club
pitcher out of a bad hole. Again, in
the eighth, after Solomon had scored,
Stanford missed another opportunity
with three men on bases when John
ston made an easy out at first.
The Olympic Club, up to the final
inning, made only four hits and con
verted most of these into scores. For
eight frames Oviatt kept the club bats
men under control, except in the fifth
when an error by the centerfielder
allowed Clark and Benn to score. In
the ninth Oviatt let down enough to
give them a chance for a rally.
In the field Stanford outplayed the
club, having two errors to the Olym
pics' three, while the infield did some
pretty work. For the most part of the
game the visitors were retired without
getting in a dangerous position.
After missing an opportunity in the
first inning, Stanford started off in the
second when Stewart singled and
scored on another hit by Roberts. The
third looked to be a big inning, but
McCandless and Cuddeback were
caught off second, and the Cardinals
were retired. In the eighth Brown
singled but was forced at second by

Solomon, after Stewart struck out.
Hits by Oviatt, Mulchay, and Roberts
scored Solomon and filled the bases,
bVit the Olympics rallied and threw
Johnston out at first.

In spite of the fact that they were
i outhit, the Olympics defeated the Stan
ford baseball team, 6 to 2, on the
varsity diamond yesterday afternoon.
By scoring once in the second in
ning, the varsity gained a lead until
the fifth, when the club slipped two
runs across the plate. The Olympics
got another in the eighth after Heck
endorf tripled, and added three more
in the ninth, when Oviatt allowed them
four hits. Stanford started a rally in
the eighth, but got only one score.
On the batting end the Cardinals
kept up the precedent set in the Santa
Clara game, but failure to hit when
safe blows would have meant runs cost
Stanford the game. In the first the
Cards had three men on and one out,
but Cuddeback's strike-out and
Brown's fly to short got the club
pitcher out of a bad hole. Again, in
the eighth, after Solomon had scored,
Stanford missed another opportunity
with three men on bases when John
ston made an easy out at first.
The Olympic Club, up to the final
inning, made only four hits and con
verted most of these into scores. For
eight frames Oviatt kept the club bats
men under control, except in the fifth
when an error by the centerfielder
allowed Clark and Benn to score. In
the ninth Oviatt let down enough to
give them a chance for a rally.
In the field Stanford outplayed the
club, having two errors to the Olym
pics' three, while the infield did some
pretty work. For the most part of the
game the visitors were retired without
getting in a dangerous position.
After missing an opportunity in the
first inning, Stanford started off in the
second when Stewart singled and
scored on another hit by Roberts. The
third looked to be a big inning, but
McCandless and Cuddeback were
caught off second, and the Cardinals
were retired. In the eighth Brown
singled but was forced at second by

Solomon, after Stewart struck out.
Hits by Oviatt, Mulchay, and Roberts
scored Solomon and filled the bases,
bVit the Olympics rallied and threw
Johnston out at first.
