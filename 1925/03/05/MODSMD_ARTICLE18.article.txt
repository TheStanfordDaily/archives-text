# OLYMPIC CLUB NINE DEFEATS STANFORD BALL TEAM 6 TO 2
## Cardinals Outhit Club Squad But Miss Opportunities For Scoring

In spite of the fact that they were
i outhit, the Olympics defeated the Stan
ford baseball team, 6 to 2, on the
varsity diamond yesterday afternoon.
By scoring once in the second in
ning, the varsity gained a lead until
the fifth, when the club slipped two
runs across the plate. The Olympics
got another in the eighth after Heck
endorf tripled, and added three more
in the ninth, when Oviatt allowed them
four hits. Stanford started a rally in
the eighth, but got only one score.
On the batting end the Cardinals
kept up the precedent set in the Santa
Clara game, but failure to hit when
safe blows would have meant runs cost
Stanford the game. In the first the
Cards had three men on and one out,
but Cuddeback's strike-out and
Brown's fly to short got the club
pitcher out of a bad hole. Again, in
the eighth, after Solomon had scored,
Stanford missed another opportunity
with three men on bases when John
ston made an easy out at first.
The Olympic Club, up to the final
inning, made only four hits and con
verted most of these into scores. For
eight frames Oviatt kept the club bats
men under control, except in the fifth
when an error by the centerfielder
