# Our Funny Faculty

While we will not go so far as to approve of the faculty entirely until
we see how the finals turn out, too much cannot be said congratulating them
on the issue of Chaparral which they presented to the campus yesterday.
There are several features of the edition which might well be pointed out to
the Chappies as worth perpetuating in future student editions. Certainly,
the Faculty Number should be made an annual feature of this publication.
At great risk to the glazing in our own residence, we here and now
officially toss a bouquet to the professors for their avoiding of wise-cracks.
Whether or not their style will ever attract the appreciation it deserves, it
was consistently cerebral. Their comedy was whole hearted. Their
humor played with ideas, not words. One could imagine that their ma
terial was prepared after a lot of hard work for the reason that it did not
appear to be.
What was done was done well. Although nobody, not even that oblig
ing soul who laughs at anything so long as it is presented by a humorous
magazine, could possibly have laughed at Mr. Lemos' cover, it is likely
that the illustration has given more enjoyment than the funniest cartoon
could have. Of nine men who bought the book, we know of six who have
hung the cover on the wall. Such a tribute to style as this is should not be
overlooked.
Theoretically, the sort of work the faculty has done should be prefererd
by those flocking to the seats of higher learning.
