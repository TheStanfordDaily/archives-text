# "Macbeth"

The "Macbeth" seat sale has been as large as for any previous show
this year, but the majority of the seats have been sold to the faculty, resi
dents of Palo Alto, and people from San Francisco and peninsula towns.
Students have secured only a small proportion of the seats.
"Macbeth" has indications, seen in dress rehearsal last night, of being
one of the outstanding achievements of the Stanford stage. In spite of
the fact that Shakespearean drama has never been looked upon with favor
by younger generations, and that it is generally considered "highbrow or
"intellectual," this production of "Macbeth" will afford the audience to
morrow night an evening of tensely dramatic situations, sets remarkably
beautiful, and an orchestra under the leadership of Mr. Allen which is ex
ceedingly well trained.
The seat sale has been satisfactory. This is not urged to fill the seats
with more cash customers, but from a desire to let you in on something
good which you should not miss. â€”C. C. S.

THE CHINK'S DIVE has been pulled. What is more interesting is
the fact that a number of local men were caught in the raid. We hope
that they don't come around crying about it.
Gambling with one's friends is one thing. Gambling with professionals
is another. One may be classed as amusement, but the other is undoubt
edly business. Much as one regrets seeing his friends take commercial
reversals, one is quite right in believing that it is their own damned fault.
We're sorry, but it's just too bad.
