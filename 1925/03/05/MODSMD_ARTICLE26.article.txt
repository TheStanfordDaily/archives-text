# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT
## 
### 
Mr. Editor: —
Saturday night in the basketball
pavilion the Stanford boxing team
meets the California Aggies. Very little
publicity has gone out regarding these
matches because of the fact that our
publicity has been reserved mainly for
major sport teams in the field at the
same time.
About all Stanford has had to brag
about in an athletic way in the last
few years has been her victories in
the minor sports and we should not
forget them now that major sports are
showing similar tendencies. The vic
tories of our minor sport teams have
been largely due to the efforts of
Harry Maloney, the director of minor
sports. The gentlemanly, sportsman
like attitude, and the fighting quali
ties, and the determination to win and
win fairly, that his teams have dis
played, have been largely due to his
influence. The number of students who
participate yearly in his sports and
the host of friends he has made in his
seventeen years of service for Stan
ford, stand as a silent tribute to one
of the finest of Stanford men.
Interest shown in a sport is the
thing that develops or kills it. Wres
tling was dropped as an intercollegiate
sport last year because of a lack of
support. Attendance at other minor
sport contests is beginning to fall off.

Must we expect a similar death for
boxing?
Boxing is a major sport at many
eastern institutions. It is a major sport
with the California Aggies and inci
dentally the sport that shows the
greatest surplus financially. The Ag
gies turn out a team that ranks with
the best teams in the West, with a
student body of 250 men. That is what
three points in the hundred, will raise
team will do.
Stanford has one of the best, boxing
teams today that she has had in years.
Led by their captain, Vincent Martin,
the team is composed of as fi,ne a
bunch of sportsmen as ever graced any
Stanford team.
Go to the boxing matches Saturday
night and show your appreciation of
Harry Maloney and the work he has
done and at the same time see inter
collegiate boxing at its best.
A special ladies' section has been
provided. There is no reason why the
Stanford women cannot see these
bouts as well as the men. Last year
at Los Angeles where we met U.C.E.B.
there were nearly as many co-eds pres
ent as men. A special invitation is ex
tended them for the matches Saturday
night. Sincerely—By Stander.

A ruling has been passed at the Uni
versity of Washington giving each
member of the faculty Ihe option of
using or abandoning the honor system
in his classes.

seventeen years of service for Stan
ford, stand as a silent tribute to one
of the finest of Stanford men.
Interest shown in a sport is the
thing that develops or kills it. Wres
tling was dropped as an intercollegiate
sport last year because of a lack of
support. Attendance at other minor
sport contests is beginning to fall off.

Must we expect a similar death for
boxing?
Boxing is a major sport at many
eastern institutions. It is a major sport
with the California Aggies and inci
dentally the sport that shows the
greatest surplus financially. The Ag
gies turn out a team that ranks with
the best teams in the West, with a
student body of 250 men. That is what
three points in the hundred, will raise
team will do.
Stanford has one of the best, boxing
teams today that she has had in years.
Led by their captain, Vincent Martin,
the team is composed of as fi,ne a
bunch of sportsmen as ever graced any
Stanford team.
Go to the boxing matches Saturday
night and show your appreciation of
Harry Maloney and the work he has
done and at the same time see inter
collegiate boxing at its best.
A special ladies' section has been
provided. There is no reason why the
Stanford women cannot see these
bouts as well as the men. Last year
at Los Angeles where we met U.C.E.B.
there were nearly as many co-eds pres
ent as men. A special invitation is ex
tended them for the matches Saturday
night. Sincerely—By Stander.

A ruling has been passed at the Uni
versity of Washington giving each
member of the faculty Ihe option of
using or abandoning the honor system
in his classes.
Mr. Editor: —
Saturday night in the basketball
pavilion the Stanford boxing team
meets the California Aggies. Very little
publicity has gone out regarding these
matches because of the fact that our
publicity has been reserved mainly for
major sport teams in the field at the
same time.
About all Stanford has had to brag
about in an athletic way in the last
few years has been her victories in
the minor sports and we should not
forget them now that major sports are
showing similar tendencies. The vic
tories of our minor sport teams have
been largely due to the efforts of
Harry Maloney, the director of minor
sports. The gentlemanly, sportsman
like attitude, and the fighting quali
ties, and the determination to win and
win fairly, that his teams have dis
played, have been largely due to his
influence. The number of students who
participate yearly in his sports and
the host of friends he has made in his
seventeen years of service for Stan
ford, stand as a silent tribute to one
of the finest of Stanford men.
