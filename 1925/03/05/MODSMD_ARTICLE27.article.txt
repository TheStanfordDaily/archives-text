# THE 						LAW STEPS

<g> V. G. D, <$>
Life is a series of surprises—take
canoeing and history examinations and
week-ends.
Or can it be "the lady doth protest
too much, methinks!"
"It often happens that those are the
best people whose characters have
been most injured by slanders; as we
usually find it to be the sweetest fruit
which the birds have been picking at."
—an interesting theory to follow out.
It's curious—that sudden "falling
off" in things, just when one's taste is
keenest. (No, this does not refer to
canoeing.)
As for brilliancy, which is attributed
to certain queer mortals, "How inferior
for seeing with is your brightest train
of fireworks to the humblest farthing
candle." Yes, but who ever had any
fun with a candle?
Illusions?
'Tis well to have them broken, they
say.
Take the lake, for instance; it really
isn't a lake at all; it's just a hollow
field full of water.
And President Coolidge's speech in
the Assembly hall yesterday—a mere
series of squawks and squeaks and
applause.
And campus dances, and "co-eds" —
well
Thank you, we prefer to keep all of
our illusions.
