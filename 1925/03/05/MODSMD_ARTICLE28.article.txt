### PHILIP BIDDISON 
(A Continued Story)

Fourth Installment
Friday came. Silas ate no breakfast.
"Come, Silas, eat this stack o' pan
cakes, an' here's some good crisp
bacon," urged Mrs. Gibbs, as she set a
plate of steaming buckwheat cakes be
fore her husband.
"No, Marthy, I ain't particler hun
gry this marnin' fer some reason."
Mrs. Gibbs put her hand on the back
of Silas' chair.
"It ain't Kelly what's takin' yer ap
petite is it?" Mrs. Gibbs was not a
diplomat.
"Not exactly, I ain't lettin' him
worry me none," Silas lied.
"Well, then, what is it?"
"Wall, I got an idee, an' I can't wait
till tomorrow t' try it out. I ain't so
sure o' myself, an' I jest can't do noth
in* but think o' what I'm gonna do
when I sees Kelly in the marnin'."
Mrs. Gibbs pressed the matter no
farther. She knew that her husband
would never confide his plan to her.
That wouldn't be Silas. She let the
matter drop and turned to her rapidly
cooling pancakes.
Saturday dawned, clear and hot.
Scarcely had old Millisack got his store
opened and the front walk swept off
before he was attracted by the clatter
of a spring wagon as it bumped along
down the dusty main street. It was
Silas Gibbs in his vegetable cart. The
vehicle rattle past the Millisack De
partment Store, its driver pretending
nof. to notice the astonished Cassius,
and was backed up against the curb in
front of the Farmers Bank across the
street with a bang. Silas alighted and
bean to arrange his wares.
"Well, I'll be damned!" muttered
Cassius, pickin up the broom he had

dropped when he first saw his com
petitor. "Th' ol' fool!"
With this by way of salutation, Mil
lisack turned and limped his way into
the shadowy deQths of the dry goods
department.
"Yes, I'll be aroun' th' streets a lit
tle later on. I'm jest ketchin' a few o'
the early birds afore I start out." Silas
had just completed a sale of carrots to
Sally Price, when out of the corner of
liia eye, he caught a glimpse of the
dumpy figure of Mayor Kelly coming
out of Glen Calvert's law office.
Straight across the street and on to
wards the bank corner came the portly
Mayor, puffing and radiating authority
in every over-nourished inch of his
five feet two.
His rapid egress from the office had
been taken by the boys in the pool
hall across the street, and a small
number of street loiterers along the
central highway, as a signal to begin
a steady advance towards the vege
table wagon of Silas Gibbs. The cart
itself bade fair to become the "no
man's land" in this war of authority
versus plain and unadulterated stub
bornness.
"Hey there!" was the first shot fired
by the outraged Mayor when he was
still a good ten feet away. "Hey
there!" Didn't I tell you that your
sellin' stuff on the streets o' Falcon
has got t' stop?" By this time, his
highness had come up to the firing
line and stood panting and glowering
at the exasperatingly calm Silas.
"Wall, now, it kind o' seems t' me
as how yuh did," answered the culprit
with a fine show of sarcasm.
"Well, then, what do you mean by
deliberately, overtly, and openly dis
obeying my orders?" The Mayor of
Falcon had acquired a formidable vo
cabulary since his inauguration, but
its fine points were lost on the un
appreciative Silas.
"I mean jest this, Mayor Kelly, that
you or no Cassius Millisack or nobody
else is goin't' stop me from exercisin'
my God-given rights t' make a honest
livin'. And afore I gits done with ye,
yer gonna wish ye hadn't started some
thin' ye couldn't finish!
"Well, yuh remember I tol' yuh I'd
arrest yuh if I caught yuh out agin,
don't cha?" Much of the Mayor's dig
nity had given way to red-faced rage.
"Yeah, I remembers it alright, Jim
Kelly. But yuh jest try an' do it!"

Silas folded his arms majestically and
calmly waited for the Mayor to take
action. Kelly sputtered and cursed but
moved not an inch.
