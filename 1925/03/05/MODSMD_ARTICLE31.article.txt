# E. W. MULLINS URGES INSANITY PREVENTION BY STUDYING CASES

"Of the 10,000 inmates of the State
Mental Hospital, 7,000 are suffering from
a state of preventable insanity," stated
Dr. E. W. Mullin of the Agnew State
Hospital in a lecture given last evening at
an open meeting of Tan Psi Epsilon, psy
chology fraternity. "The cost of main
taining these patients amounts to $2,000,-
000 a year, while California has paid
$10,000,000 as an initial cost for the men
tal hospital,", continued Dr. Mullin. "It
is the duty of parent, teacher, physician,
and everyone to prevent those problems
resulting in the condition known as 'de
mentia praecor' from developing."
Dr. Mullin, in speaking on "Abnormal
Psychology and Psychiatry" stated that
psychiatry, or the study of mental dis
eases, really amounted to abnormal psy
chology, and that only when the physician
in recent times approached the subject
from a psychological stand has much
progress been made towards understand
ing mental disorders. The work of Freud

in the nineteenth century, and the subse
quent controversy and study of Freud's
j theories, then astounding to the world,
were the first beginnings towards the cor
rect attitude towards treatment of the in
sane. "Insanity is not a mysterious con
dition, but the flight of the individual into
the life of fantasy as a relief from
! trouble."
Troubles Frequent Cause.
It is the accumulation of continued
| troubles of environment ending in a men
tal breakdown after a particular period of
stress, such as marriage, the period of
i college transition, or of an older person
realizing the failure of his life ideals, that
; gives the condition of "dementia praecox,"
according to Dr. Mullin. Fortunately the
larger per cent of cases do not cultimate
! in a "breakdown," but still their innate
desires are expressed in their actions. Dr.
Mullin cited the example of the extreme
| supporter of the Society for the Preven
tion of Cruelty to Animals as one in
which a sub-conscious desire to torture is
being perhaps shielded, when "You could
not' trust a dog alone in a room with such
| a case." So, too, one of extreme relig
-1 ious zeal might, sub-consciously, be im

bued with a desire to commit highway
robbery.
As an example of "dementia praecox,"
Dr. Mull in brought out the case of a
young boy, who, "hurt" by a companion,
is unable physically to retaliate, or to
settle the matter. As a result, and relief
from his trouble, the boy withdraws from
the activities and companionships of a
normal youth. His thoughts become more
and more separated from the normal path,
until finally, unless care is taken, the
brain is overburdened with the results of
his thoughts, and a case of breakdown
mentally, with subsequent physical harm
follows.
If a parent, teacher, or physician knows
the trouble and corrects the boy's tendency
towards aloofness, and so brings to him
the opportunities of a normal person, the
trouble is prevented. Likewise are cases
of heralded geniuses, who are misdirected
and erroneously encouraged to read
Shakespeare at ten instead of engaging in
normal activities.

The University of Soutnern Califor
nia recently received an endowment
amounting to nearly one million dol
lars from a Chicago millionaire.
