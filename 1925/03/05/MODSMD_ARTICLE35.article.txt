tle Theatre this evening at 7:30 on
"Modern Education in Persia."
Jenab-i-Fadil is now one of the fore
most exponders of the Bahai cause
which had its rise in Persia. The

World Unity of Religion. Persia is now
one-third Bahai.

In considering education in Persia
the different educational forces in the
country must be considered. Formerly
the Mohammedans did all the educa
tional work that was done. In more
recent years the Christian missionaries
have been doing work along this line,
and later still the Bahai Movement has
been undertaking the work of educa
tion in a country which is still illiter
ate. This last source of education is
rapidly coming to the front, its leaders
being such men as Jenab-i-Fadil.
Cosmopolitan Club, Y. W. C. A.,
Bahai Assembly, Wranglers, Education
Club, Women's Education Club, and
Chinese Club are co-operating to bring
this lecturer to the campus.
