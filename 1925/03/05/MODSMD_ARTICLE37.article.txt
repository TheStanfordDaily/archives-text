## 
### 
The junior women won from the
freshmen by a score of 22 to 16 in the
fastest basketball game of the series
played yesterday afternoon on the
lloble courts.
The game started out slowly, neither
team showing its form until after the
first quarter. The first half ended 8 to
6 in favor of the juniors.
In the second half the teamwork on
both sides became well organized and
the playing very fast. Aileene Burks
and Helen Erskine, forwards on the
junior team, worked especially well
together. The freshman centers played
a good game but the junior guards
intercepted most of their passes, keep
ing the ball from the freshman for
wards -who did not play their usual
steady game.
With two more games of the inter
class series to be played off, the sopho
mores now stand ahead, having won
two games and lost none. The fresh
men and juniors tie for second place
with one game lost and one won. The
seniors have lost two games and won
none. ,
