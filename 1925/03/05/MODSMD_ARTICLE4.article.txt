# Bird-Banding Station Is Managed by Zoologists
## 
### 
Students of the Zoology dopartment
under the direction of Professor J. O.
Snyder are maintaining a bird-banding
station on the campus in co-operation
■with the United States Biological Sur
vey. Several bird-banding traps are
placed in favorable locations about
the Qufid and in the arboretum.
The birds when caught are banded
with small aluminum bands, or, if al
ready banded, the number is recorded
and the bird released. All information
that is derived from the Stanford bird
banding station is sent to the United
States Biological Survey in Washing
ton, D. C., where data is being gath
ered concerning migration, feeding
habits, distribution, and other phases
of bird life.
