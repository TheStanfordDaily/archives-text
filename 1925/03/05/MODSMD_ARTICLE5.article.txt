# EFFECTIVE SETS ADD COLOR TO "MACBETH"
## 
### 
THE final dress rehearsal last night, and the special matinee held this
afternoon completed preparations for tomorrow night's production of
"Macbeth," in the Assembly hall at 8:15.
The two outstanding features of the play, as revealed last night, were the
colorful, impressionistic sets conceived by Les Kiler, and the well-trained
orchestra which Warren D. Allen has secured to play between acts.

The sets are achieved mostly by
means of a clever rearrangement of
the various drapes, with a certain
amount of doors, stairways, and walls
to create an illusion of the rooms in
a feudal castle. Les Kiler has executed
what he considers his most ambitious
settings, and the results are exceeding
ly beautiful. No small part of the ef
fects achieved is due to the efforts of
Hume West, who has arranged a light
ing system which is far superior to any
that has yet been seen in the Assembly
hall.
Warren D. Allen, University organ
ist, has arranged a complete program
of incidental music for the production
of "Macbeth" Friday night and will con
duct the orchestra, composed of Palo
Alto and campus musicians. This will
be the first time the campus has seen
Allen in the role of a conductor but he
orchestrated the Wind Instrument En
cemble of San Francisco last Friday.
No complete suite of incidental
music for "Macbeth" exists, so Allen
has drawn, from all sources, music that
will fit in with the mood of the play.
Six selections will be played preceding
the opening of the acts and fourteen
minor pieces between scenes. .
The overture previous to the first
raising of the curtain is "Tyrandut" by
Lochner. "Nightwatcher's Song" by
Edward Grieg precede the second act
and Tschaikowsky's "Romance" the
third. "Scotch Poem" by McDowell will
help to emphasize the atmosphere of
Scotland before act four. The gloom of
the final catastrophe is to be brought
out before the final act of Tschaikow
sky's "Chanson Triste," the "song of
sadness." The motif of the three weird
witches will be "In the Hall of the
Mountain King" by Grieg.

Edward Grieg precede the second act
and Tschaikowsky's "Romance" the
third. "Scotch Poem" by McDowell will
help to emphasize the atmosphere of
Scotland before act four. The gloom of
the final catastrophe is to be brought
out before the final act of Tschaikow
sky's "Chanson Triste," the "song of
sadness." The motif of the three weird
witches will be "In the Hall of the
Mountain King" by Grieg.
