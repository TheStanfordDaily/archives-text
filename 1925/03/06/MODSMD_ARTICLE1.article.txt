# VARSITY TO MEET SANTA CLARA NINE IN FINAL GAME OF BASEBALL SERIES
## Each Team Has One Victory; Cardinal Batters Now Hitting Heavily 
### 
Santa Clara plays the Stanford nine
in the deciding contest of the three
game series on the varsity diamond
tomorrow afternoon at 2:30 o'clock.
Each team has taken one of the pre
vious games.
It is unlikely that Coach Wolter will
start Oviatt in tomorrow's game, as he
has opened the last three games for
the Cardinal. Collins and Teague are
possibilities for tomorrow, with Nevers
likely to hurl a couple of innings. Both
Oviatt and Collins have gone well
against the Broncos in the previous
two contests with them.
Lawson will probably be behind the
plate. Last Saturday he played in his;
first game of the season and per-1
formed well against the Santa Clara j
nine. In Solomon and Lawson the j
Cards have two dependable men to
handle the pitchers.
In the first game Santa Clara
squeezed out a victory in the tenth
inning when the Mission team over
came a one-run lead held by the Cards,
on Dagley's homer, which scored one
man ahead of him.
Stanford started hitting in the sec
ond contest, making thirteen hits off
Wright and Storm. The whole team
went much better and played errorless
ball to win easily, 9 to 3.
In this game the Cards showed much
power and gave the best performance
of the present season. Stanford was
able to hit both Bronco pitchers with
regularity.
As the varsity has found its batting

eye and is performing well in the field,
the Cards should be able to take the
final game of the Santa Clara series.
Jerry Stewart, of last year's- freshman
team, is coming along rapidly and has
made five bits in the last two games,
i In the infield both Roberts and Mul-
I chay have been doing excellent work
j around second base.
