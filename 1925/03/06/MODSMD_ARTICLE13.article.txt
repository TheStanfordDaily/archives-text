# SECOND BOUTS WITH DAVIS FARM BOXERS SLATED TOMORROW
## 
### 
Harry Maloney is confident that the 1
Stanford boxers will outfight the
strong California Aggie team in the;
return match in the pavilion tomorrow'
night at 8 o'clock. Seven bouts will be j
held with the Davis Farm fighters. |
In the previous meet the Aggies j
were able to capture four of the bouts. |
All of these were extremely close, so |
that some of the decisions are sure to
be reversed tomorrow night.
Th Cardinal fighters are all in excel
lent shape, with the possible exception
of Bert Simmons. As yet he has not
rounded into the best condition since
his victory in the heavyweight division I
of the novice tournament, so that Jim
Arthur may take his regular place in 1
the lineup. On Wednesday Harry Ma-;
loney worked his men against two
fresh boxers in two rounds of three j
and two minutes, and they survived
the test well. This approximates the
length of tomorrow's bouts, which will
be three rounds of two minutes each.
Martin Sure to Win
Captain V. L. Martin is almost sure
to win his bout from Miller, over whom
he Scored a technical knockout two!
weeks ago. In this bout he had a wide
margin over his opponent.
Either Arthur or Simmons should
defeat Tuttle, of the Aggies. In the
previous match Arthur showed good
form in winning the decision. Sim-;
mons, although he is not at the peak
of condition, has* plenty of power to
make him a dangerous man for the
I
Davis heavyweight.
Captain Miehle, Pacific intercollegi
ate bantamweight champion, will again
meet Collins of Stanford. In spite of,
his inexperience, Collins pushed j

Miehle to the limit in their bout at
I Davis and lost the fight only on a
close decision. Collins has been de- j
' voloped rapidly by Maloney since his
appearance in the novice meet.
Schall Going Well
In the middleweight class Schall will
I j probably not have much trouble in
j disposing of McKerron pf the Aggies,
■ j whom he defeated easily before. An
i other good fighter is Rollin Farrairf,
light-heavyweight, who is expected to
! reverse the previous decision to
II Grubbs. This bout, which went to an
! extra round, was hard-fought all the '
way, and Farmin lost only by a narrow
margin.
Gleam Feeley will replace Parsons in
the lightweight bout. Feeley is a new
man, but he has shown up well in
workouts since winning the novice
I championship. Miron, featherweiht,
has been coming along well since the 1
first match and will give Gonez of
Davis an even harder fight than be
fore.
As judges for tomorrow night's bouts
I Ilarv Maloney will have Peter Flanni
gan, former amateur middleweight
champion of Australia, and Mort Black
burn, former heavyweight champion of
the University of Wisconsin.

that some of the decisions are sure to
be reversed tomorrow night.
Th Cardinal fighters are all in excel
lent shape, with the possible exception
of Bert Simmons. As yet he has not
rounded into the best condition since
his victory in the heavyweight division I
of the novice tournament, so that Jim
Arthur may take his regular place in 1
the lineup. On Wednesday Harry Ma-;
loney worked his men against two
fresh boxers in two rounds of three j
and two minutes, and they survived
the test well. This approximates the
length of tomorrow's bouts, which will
be three rounds of two minutes each.
Martin Sure to Win
Captain V. L. Martin is almost sure
to win his bout from Miller, over whom
he Scored a technical knockout two!
weeks ago. In this bout he had a wide
margin over his opponent.
Either Arthur or Simmons should
defeat Tuttle, of the Aggies. In the
previous match Arthur showed good
form in winning the decision. Sim-;
mons, although he is not at the peak
of condition, has* plenty of power to
make him a dangerous man for the
I
Davis heavyweight.
Captain Miehle, Pacific intercollegi
ate bantamweight champion, will again
meet Collins of Stanford. In spite of,
his inexperience, Collins pushed j

Miehle to the limit in their bout at
I Davis and lost the fight only on a
close decision. Collins has been de- j
' voloped rapidly by Maloney since his
appearance in the novice meet.
Schall Going Well
In the middleweight class Schall will
I j probably not have much trouble in
j disposing of McKerron pf the Aggies,
■ j whom he defeated easily before. An
i other good fighter is Rollin Farrairf,
light-heavyweight, who is expected to
! reverse the previous decision to
II Grubbs. This bout, which went to an
! extra round, was hard-fought all the '
way, and Farmin lost only by a narrow
margin.
Gleam Feeley will replace Parsons in
the lightweight bout. Feeley is a new
man, but he has shown up well in
workouts since winning the novice
I championship. Miron, featherweiht,
has been coming along well since the 1
first match and will give Gonez of
Davis an even harder fight than be
fore.
As judges for tomorrow night's bouts
I Ilarv Maloney will have Peter Flanni
gan, former amateur middleweight
champion of Australia, and Mort Black
burn, former heavyweight champion of
the University of Wisconsin.
Harry Maloney is confident that the 1
Stanford boxers will outfight the
strong California Aggie team in the;
return match in the pavilion tomorrow'
night at 8 o'clock. Seven bouts will be j
held with the Davis Farm fighters. |
In the previous meet the Aggies j
were able to capture four of the bouts. |
All of these were extremely close, so |
that some of the decisions are sure to
be reversed tomorrow night.
