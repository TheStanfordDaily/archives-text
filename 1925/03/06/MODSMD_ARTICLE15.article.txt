# BRANDSTEN'S MEN READY FOR MEET TOMORROW WITH BRUIN SWIMMERS
## Varsity, Freshman Teams to Clash in Encina Pool; Cards Favorites 
### 
Primed by a week of intensive train
ing under Coach Brandsten, the Cardi
nal varsity and freshman swimming
teams are ready to meet California's
best tomorrow afternoon at 3 o'clock
in the Encina pool. The Stanford men
will enter the competition heavy fa
vorites to win, according to compara
tive times made during practices of the
two teams.
Three Stanford-California records
may go by the boards tomorrow.
Brandsten has been drilling his men
with the idea of not only winning from
the Bruins but lowering times as well.
Arden Allen, swimming his second
J year of varsity competition, is intent
upon cutting three seconds or more
from the present record of 1:13 in the
100-yard breast-stroke. His time in this
event has been hovering around 1:10
all season. Allen is slipping with ease
i into the place left vacant by O'Connor,
[ who was sorely missed in the dual
I meet with Northwestern University.
If Fletcher gets under :26 in the 50-
yard free style swim he will be within
j grasping distance of the record. Fletch
er is one of the big contributions to
i the varsity made by the championship
freshman team of last year.
The third record which Brandsten's
men are after is that of the relay
which now stands at 1:06 4-5. The
j four men to make up this team will be
: named tomorrow afternoon depending
on the showings made by the five men
: now in line for the berths. Williams,
; Doerr, Schwartz, Allen, and McCallis
! ter are the potential relay team mem
| bers.
j Cardinal representatives in the div
ing may turn in a clean sweep but
' this is highly improbable as the best
Californian entrant in that event is
jdePerrari, captain of the Blue and Gold
: men. Fall and Gibbons are showing
superior style.
Stevenson and Wright will have a
l w b-ittle for honors and points in the
220-yard free style swim. The present
record is 2:38 and there is a bare pos
i sibility that this may be lowered in
| the race tomorrow. O'Brien, Bruin flash
i who placed third last year, is on deck
j again and in better shape than ever,
Barbat, who carried back second
