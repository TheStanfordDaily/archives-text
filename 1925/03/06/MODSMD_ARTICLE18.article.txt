# Our Varied Requirements

### 
American school superintendents, in congress assembled at Cincinnati
have adopted resolutions expressing their sentiments upon most of the
problems of the present day. They a codification of international
law, the teaching of citizenship in the schools, the proposed child labor
amendment, the budget system in the schools, the preservation of common
decency in the drama and the photoplay, the standardization of college
entrance requirements, the promotion of "humaneness" in the classroom,
and the establishment of an international court. Practically everything
seems to be covered. The most locally important action taken was that
proposed by Frank D. Boynton, superintendent of the Ithaca schools,
whose efforts to eliminate the confusion in college entrance requirements,
led to the adoption by the conference of a measure to encourage their
standardization.
Preparatory school curricula would be much simplified by such stand
ardization, and especially in English courses could a much needed reform
be instituted. In an effort to teach all the literary masterpieces demanded
by all the colleges, most have been slighted considerably. As a result, in
numerable complaints have come from the colleges, telling of the poor
preparation of freshmen in English literature. Figures compiled in several
western colleges have shown that more freshmen fail in English than in
any other subject.
This is only one condition which has resulted from the confusion of
college entrance requirements. Many other similar ineffifciencies migbt
be cited, so it seems that the situation is well worthy of the attention of
school Success should reward their efforts.—Cornell Sun.
«
COMPLAINTS HAVE BEEN MADE by the Palo Alto hospital
that students are not observing visiting hours, and that as a result danger
ously ill patients have been disturbed.
Students have felt themselves free to go to the hospital at almost any
hour of the morning, afternoon, or evening to see their friends. This
upsets the routine of the hospital and in many cases breaks into the rest of
the patients being visited.
Would-be Good Samaritans can cooperate with the hospital authorities
by visiting only at the proper hours, which are between 2 and 4 o'clock in
the afternoon and 7 and 8 o'clock in the evening. And it is not necessary
to enter the hospital with great gusto and a loud hurrah.
Unless a change is noted in the attitude of students visiting their sick
friends, the hospital threatens to restrict them to those who have special
permission. —W. W. K.
IN ACCORDANCE WITH AN OLD CUSTOM, the freshmen
members of the staff will be in complete charge of Monday's issue of the
Daily. The paper will be edited by Fred Speers.

that students are not observing visiting hours, and that as a result danger
ously ill patients have been disturbed.
Students have felt themselves free to go to the hospital at almost any
hour of the morning, afternoon, or evening to see their friends. This
upsets the routine of the hospital and in many cases breaks into the rest of
the patients being visited.
Would-be Good Samaritans can cooperate with the hospital authorities
by visiting only at the proper hours, which are between 2 and 4 o'clock in
the afternoon and 7 and 8 o'clock in the evening. And it is not necessary
to enter the hospital with great gusto and a loud hurrah.
Unless a change is noted in the attitude of students visiting their sick
friends, the hospital threatens to restrict them to those who have special
permission. —W. W. K.

American school superintendents, in congress assembled at Cincinnati
have adopted resolutions expressing their sentiments upon most of the
problems of the present day. They a codification of international
law, the teaching of citizenship in the schools, the proposed child labor
amendment, the budget system in the schools, the preservation of common
decency in the drama and the photoplay, the standardization of college
entrance requirements, the promotion of "humaneness" in the classroom,
and the establishment of an international court. Practically everything
seems to be covered. The most locally important action taken was that
proposed by Frank D. Boynton, superintendent of the Ithaca schools,
whose efforts to eliminate the confusion in college entrance requirements,
led to the adoption by the conference of a measure to encourage their
standardization.
Preparatory school curricula would be much simplified by such stand
ardization, and especially in English courses could a much needed reform
be instituted. In an effort to teach all the literary masterpieces demanded
by all the colleges, most have been slighted considerably. As a result, in
numerable complaints have come from the colleges, telling of the poor
preparation of freshmen in English literature. Figures compiled in several
western colleges have shown that more freshmen fail in English than in
any other subject.
This is only one condition which has resulted from the confusion of
college entrance requirements. Many other similar ineffifciencies migbt
be cited, so it seems that the situation is well worthy of the attention of
school Success should reward their efforts.—Cornell Sun.
