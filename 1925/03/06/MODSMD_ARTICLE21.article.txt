The Interfraternity Board of Control at
its meeting last night made the follow-'
ing additions and modifications to the
existing rushing rules:
1. If a fraternity man should pass a
freshman on the Quad, and the fresh
man should say "Hello," the fraternity
man must frown darkly and thumb his
nose at the freshman. If he fails to,
do this, his action may be interpreted
as showing sociability toward the
freshman, and his house will be pen
alized.
2. No fraternity man may entertain
a freshman on the campus. Holding
the watch so the freshman may hear
it tick is forbidden. The ticking in
this case is construed to be entertain
ing to the freshman.
3. If a faculty member of any fra
ternity should tell a freshman to hurry
up and finish his examination, his ac
tion shall be interpreted as rushing the
freshman, and the president of the
house in question will be sent to the
gibbet.
4. If a fraternity man has a brother
in the freshman class, neither one shall
be permitted to write home to their
common parents. Violation of this rule
shall be punishable by disinheritance.
5. If a fraternity man and a fresh
man live in the same city, they shall
flip a coin to see who goes home over
the vacations.
6. Formal rushing shall begin on
Monday, the third week following
March 2, at 2 p.m., and shall continue
every eighteenth hour thereafter, un
til the midnight of the following sea
son, and there shall be no rushing at
any other time unless by special dis
pensation of Calvin Coolidge, the Pope
of Rome, or the President of the Inter
fraternity Council.

Stanford University, March 3, 1944. —
The Inter-Hall Council held its regular
weekly meeting in the football sta
dium. The edifice was barely able to
accommodated quorum.
President Harry Wolf stated that
some doubt had been cast upon the
original intention of the club's found
ers, which was that it should be a so
cial organization. In denial of the slan
der the secretary read from the min
utes the account of a basket picnic
with the Palo Alto circle of the Camp
fire Girls, which was given in the fall
of 1933.
