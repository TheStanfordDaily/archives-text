# BY RIGHT OF CONQUEST
## (A Continued Story) By PHILIP BIDDISON 
### 
(Conclusion)
A considerable crowd had collected
around the vegetable cart. Silas threw
off his straw hat and jumped into the
wagon bed, and onto a perfectly good
bunch of onions.
"Gona sing us a tune?" came a voice
from the spectators. It was Clem
Peters, title-holder of the horseshoe
singles, and general man-about-town.
Everyone laughed patronizingly.
Clem had to be laughed at on all oc
casions. Clem laughed himself.
Gibbs motioned the crowd nearer.
The rebel was going to address the
multitude! He could, as far as that
goes', for Silas had testified at revival
meetings long enough to have acquired
a certain degree of oratorical ability.
The men in the crowd clapped and
shouted.
"Gentlemen and fellow citizens of
Falcon," began Silas in his high-:
pitched, nasal drawl. "I stand afore ye
a Christian gentleman, a man askin'
nothin' from nobody, 'cept a honest
irvin* fer my wife an' little ones. But, |
gentlemen, I have been outraged!"
Silas had a sense of the dramatic.
"Git down out o' there!" Kelly's I
voice was bellowing. Silas paid no heed
and continued his oration as though
there had been no interruption.
"You all know about what our Mayor
has tried to perpetuate agin me. Sar
tainly, no God-fearin' man could in
righteousness say that I have not been j
subjected to an insult."
"Well, whatcha gonna do about it, 1
huh?" Somebody in the crowd was evi-!
dently bent on seeing the honor of j
the Mayor upheld.
"I'm gonna do jest this! I ain't per
posin't' be made no fool of, an I don't
intend t' stop sellin' nice fresh vege
tables t' my friends o' Falcon."
This last was directed straight to- j
wards the steaming Mayor, who stood
directly under Silas, holding himself
in with great difficulty.
"There's a nigger in th' woodpile
here somewheres, and I'm from Miz
zouri. So, I sets out t' find out what's j
at the bottom o' all this here business, j
I warn't long in findin' out, neither!"!
Kelly could control himself no long- i
er. "Men, are yuh gonna stand here j
an' see this ninny defy th' law —huh?" i
His voice cracked with rage. "Git down ;
out o' there 'fore I yank ye down! Git'
down, I say! Git down in th' name o'j
th' law!"
It was pretty clear that the law, or j
the Mayor, for that matter, didn't make j
a great deal of difference to Silas now |
that he was started. He wiped the |
sweat from his forehead, and began j
with renewed vigor.
"Y' all know as well as I do that
Kelly here has th' most stock in th*
Farmers Bank, and things ain't been
goin', too good over thar ever since
th' crop failure las' fall. Milly's store
'cross th* street would make a purty
nice passed o' money fer th' dyin' bank.
Milly ain't been likin' me none too well
fer a long time. I guess me sellin'
vegetables gits too much o' his trade."
This thrust was aimed directly at the I
awe-stricken Millisack, who had been ;
standing on the outskirts of the crowd !
for several minutes. Cassius bit his \
finger nail. His cleverness had a way
of failing him in an emergency. The
men howled with mirth. Millisack
grinned sheepishly.
"Now I happens t' know that Milly |
has jest recently changed his bankin' j
business from th' First National to th'
Kelly Bank. I ain't perposin' t' go no j
farther 'cause I'm gonna leave th' rest
up t' you fellers t' draw yer own con
clusions. It's as plain as th' nose on
yer face that Milly and Kelly er at !
th' bottom o' all this here business.
Silas looked around for Kelly to give |
him a parting shot, but the Mayor j
was no longer in sight. Glancing to his j
left, however, the victor made out the
figure of the vanquished in the dis
tance, rapidly stalking in the general
direction of home.
"Nice fresh veg-ta-buls!" was the
last thing Millisack heard as he stum
bled over his door-sill in his haste to
gain the shelter of his store.
The End.
The cash value of a college educa
tion to its possessor is $72,000 accord
ing to Dean E. W. Lord of Boston Uni
versity.

vegetables gits too much o' his trade."
This thrust was aimed directly at the I
awe-stricken Millisack, who had been ;
standing on the outskirts of the crowd !
for several minutes. Cassius bit his \
finger nail. His cleverness had a way
of failing him in an emergency. The
men howled with mirth. Millisack
grinned sheepishly.
"Now I happens t' know that Milly |
has jest recently changed his bankin' j
business from th' First National to th'
Kelly Bank. I ain't perposin' t' go no j
farther 'cause I'm gonna leave th' rest
up t' you fellers t' draw yer own con
clusions. It's as plain as th' nose on
yer face that Milly and Kelly er at !
th' bottom o' all this here business.
Silas looked around for Kelly to give |
him a parting shot, but the Mayor j
was no longer in sight. Glancing to his j
left, however, the victor made out the
figure of the vanquished in the dis
tance, rapidly stalking in the general
direction of home.
"Nice fresh veg-ta-buls!" was the
last thing Millisack heard as he stum
bled over his door-sill in his haste to
gain the shelter of his store.
The End.
The cash value of a college educa
tion to its possessor is $72,000 accord
ing to Dean E. W. Lord of Boston Uni
versity.
(Conclusion)
A considerable crowd had collected
around the vegetable cart. Silas threw
off his straw hat and jumped into the
wagon bed, and onto a perfectly good
bunch of onions.
"Gona sing us a tune?" came a voice
from the spectators. It was Clem
Peters, title-holder of the horseshoe
singles, and general man-about-town.
Everyone laughed patronizingly.
Clem had to be laughed at on all oc
casions. Clem laughed himself.
Gibbs motioned the crowd nearer.
The rebel was going to address the
multitude! He could, as far as that
goes', for Silas had testified at revival
meetings long enough to have acquired
a certain degree of oratorical ability.
The men in the crowd clapped and
shouted.
"Gentlemen and fellow citizens of
Falcon," began Silas in his high-:
pitched, nasal drawl. "I stand afore ye
a Christian gentleman, a man askin'
nothin' from nobody, 'cept a honest
irvin* fer my wife an' little ones. But, |
gentlemen, I have been outraged!"
Silas had a sense of the dramatic.
"Git down out o' there!" Kelly's I
voice was bellowing. Silas paid no heed
and continued his oration as though
there had been no interruption.
"You all know about what our Mayor
has tried to perpetuate agin me. Sar
tainly, no God-fearin' man could in
righteousness say that I have not been j
subjected to an insult."
"Well, whatcha gonna do about it, 1
huh?" Somebody in the crowd was evi-!
dently bent on seeing the honor of j
the Mayor upheld.
"I'm gonna do jest this! I ain't per
posin't' be made no fool of, an I don't
intend t' stop sellin' nice fresh vege
tables t' my friends o' Falcon."
This last was directed straight to- j
wards the steaming Mayor, who stood
directly under Silas, holding himself
in with great difficulty.
"There's a nigger in th' woodpile
here somewheres, and I'm from Miz
zouri. So, I sets out t' find out what's j
at the bottom o' all this here business, j
I warn't long in findin' out, neither!"!
Kelly could control himself no long- i
er. "Men, are yuh gonna stand here j
an' see this ninny defy th' law —huh?" i
His voice cracked with rage. "Git down ;
out o' there 'fore I yank ye down! Git'
down, I say! Git down in th' name o'j
th' law!"
It was pretty clear that the law, or j
the Mayor, for that matter, didn't make j
a great deal of difference to Silas now |
that he was started. He wiped the |
sweat from his forehead, and began j
with renewed vigor.
"Y' all know as well as I do that
Kelly here has th' most stock in th*
Farmers Bank, and things ain't been
goin', too good over thar ever since
th' crop failure las' fall. Milly's store
'cross th* street would make a purty
nice passed o' money fer th' dyin' bank.

tables t' my friends o' Falcon."
This last was directed straight to- j
wards the steaming Mayor, who stood
directly under Silas, holding himself
in with great difficulty.
"There's a nigger in th' woodpile
here somewheres, and I'm from Miz
zouri. So, I sets out t' find out what's j
at the bottom o' all this here business, j
I warn't long in findin' out, neither!"!
Kelly could control himself no long- i
er. "Men, are yuh gonna stand here j
an' see this ninny defy th' law —huh?" i
His voice cracked with rage. "Git down ;
out o' there 'fore I yank ye down! Git'
down, I say! Git down in th' name o'j
th' law!"
It was pretty clear that the law, or j
the Mayor, for that matter, didn't make j
a great deal of difference to Silas now |
that he was started. He wiped the |
sweat from his forehead, and began j
with renewed vigor.
"Y' all know as well as I do that
Kelly here has th' most stock in th*
Farmers Bank, and things ain't been
goin', too good over thar ever since
th' crop failure las' fall. Milly's store
'cross th* street would make a purty
nice passed o' money fer th' dyin' bank.
Milly ain't been likin' me none too well
fer a long time. I guess me sellin'
vegetables gits too much o' his trade."
This thrust was aimed directly at the I
awe-stricken Millisack, who had been ;
standing on the outskirts of the crowd !
for several minutes. Cassius bit his \
finger nail. His cleverness had a way
of failing him in an emergency. The
men howled with mirth. Millisack
grinned sheepishly.
"Now I happens t' know that Milly |
has jest recently changed his bankin' j
business from th' First National to th'
Kelly Bank. I ain't perposin' t' go no j
farther 'cause I'm gonna leave th' rest
up t' you fellers t' draw yer own con
clusions. It's as plain as th' nose on
yer face that Milly and Kelly er at !
th' bottom o' all this here business.
Silas looked around for Kelly to give |
him a parting shot, but the Mayor j
was no longer in sight. Glancing to his j
left, however, the victor made out the
figure of the vanquished in the dis
tance, rapidly stalking in the general
direction of home.
"Nice fresh veg-ta-buls!" was the
last thing Millisack heard as he stum
bled over his door-sill in his haste to
gain the shelter of his store.
The End.

(Conclusion)
A considerable crowd had collected
around the vegetable cart. Silas threw
off his straw hat and jumped into the
wagon bed, and onto a perfectly good
bunch of onions.
"Gona sing us a tune?" came a voice
from the spectators. It was Clem
Peters, title-holder of the horseshoe
singles, and general man-about-town.
Everyone laughed patronizingly.
Clem had to be laughed at on all oc
casions. Clem laughed himself.
Gibbs motioned the crowd nearer.
The rebel was going to address the
multitude! He could, as far as that
goes', for Silas had testified at revival
meetings long enough to have acquired
a certain degree of oratorical ability.
The men in the crowd clapped and
shouted.
"Gentlemen and fellow citizens of
Falcon," began Silas in his high-:
pitched, nasal drawl. "I stand afore ye
a Christian gentleman, a man askin'
nothin' from nobody, 'cept a honest
irvin* fer my wife an' little ones. But, |
gentlemen, I have been outraged!"
Silas had a sense of the dramatic.
"Git down out o' there!" Kelly's I
voice was bellowing. Silas paid no heed
and continued his oration as though
there had been no interruption.
"You all know about what our Mayor
has tried to perpetuate agin me. Sar
tainly, no God-fearin' man could in
righteousness say that I have not been j
subjected to an insult."
"Well, whatcha gonna do about it, 1
huh?" Somebody in the crowd was evi-!
dently bent on seeing the honor of j
the Mayor upheld.
"I'm gonna do jest this! I ain't per
posin't' be made no fool of, an I don't
intend t' stop sellin' nice fresh vege
tables t' my friends o' Falcon."
This last was directed straight to- j
wards the steaming Mayor, who stood
