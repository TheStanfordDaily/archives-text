plot incident for the success of this
book, but rather is skillful in creating
interest by bringing together three
women from wholly different environ
ments, and presenting pictures of the
individuals by showing the effect of
each on the others.
Walpole has displayed real insight
in picturing sympathetically the deso
lation of old age. The effect is depres
sing, but is valuable for the character
study it presents.
His discrimination between women
who can enjoy their old age in poor
houses, and "old ladies" who must
proudly refuse help, and live in cir
cumstances similar to those of the
three women in the book is most ap
pealing. —B. F.
