squad will take on the Berkeley high

I teams, as the cubs defeated Berkeley
j in their second game of the season.

' probably start the game, with Rey- j
nolds and Sobieski in reserve. Philippi j
j has not yet been knocked out of the j
j box. Sypher is slated to occupy his ]
regular position behind the plate, and
| the rest of the lineup will be practi- j
I cally the same as has played in the I
i preceding games.
