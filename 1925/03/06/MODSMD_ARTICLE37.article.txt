# PHOTOGRAPHS SENT ACROSS CONTINENT BY NEW INVENTION
## 
### 
The capabilities of the system of
electrically transmitting pictures de
vised by Bell System engineers were
demonstrated in the sending of photo
graphs of the inauguration of Presi
dent Coolidge across the continent in
seven minutes.
Pictures were sent simultaneously
to New York, Chicago, and San Fran
cisco. The length of the telephone line
used was 3600 miles, the longest dis
tance over which the new system has

been tried. The American Telephone j
& Telegraph Company is soon to open
a transcontinental picture transmis-'
j sion service.
The company has been developing
| the invention for several years and
has it at a point where it is of com- j
mercial value. Wireless transmission
is also possible when atmospheric con
ditions are sufficiently steady.
In the new method a positive trans
parent film is suitable for transmis
| sion, and as the film may be used
{ while still wet, delay Ls eliminated. A
| picture seven by five inches can be
j sent in seven minutes, and is practi
i cally indistinguishable from the ordi
nary photograph when printed.
The film to be ftsed is inserted in
i
| the transmitter by rolling it on a cylin
drical form. During operation a small,
intense light beam shines through the
I film to a photoelectric cell within. The
: film is rotated at a uniform speed and
advances parallel to the axis of the
I cylinder, similar to a cylindrical phono
graph record.
Each portion of the picture affects
in turn the intensity of the light reach
ing the cell. The variation in the light
striking the cell gives rise to a current
which, by means of a vacuum tube and

amplifier and modulator, controls the
current bowing through the telephone
line.
At the receiving end a reverse pro
cess is employed, with an unexposed
photographic fifln. A control device
causes the two cylinders used to rotate
at exactly the same speed.
