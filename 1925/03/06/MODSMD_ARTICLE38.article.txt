# HOBBIES OF THE FACULTY
## MISS HELEN MASTERS BUNTING 
### 
Roughing is not an activity con
fined to Stanford men, judging by the
statement of Miss Helen Masters
Bunting of Roble Gymnasium that her
hobby is real camping with all the
rough trappings and inconveniences.
"Before I came out here," she said,
"I camped in the woods of Maine
every summer. We had swimmingâ€”
Blept in tents. It was real camping.
"After that I went to Colorado. I
used to go camping with the Colorado
Mountain Club there. I think we
climbed easily six or eight peaks,
ranging in height from 9,000 to 14,000
feet.
"Since I came to California I have
spent one summer at Yosemite and
several at Lake Tahoe. Two years ago

I was In the .Feather River country
and climbed Mt. Lassen, coming back
later by way of Tahoe. One time when
I was at Tahoe in late September, we
went swimming one morning in a
snowstorm.
"This summer I am going to Hono
lulu. I hope, but not oif a camping
trip.
"My most immediate hobby is get
ting the weeds out of my garden. Judg
ing by the number of weeds, plus the
size of me, plus the leisure time avail
able to a member of the faculty, it
looks like an overpowering job. If
there is any house that has an ambi
tious bunch of freshmen with lots of
spare time, they can come up to our
place, and they will be received with
joy."
