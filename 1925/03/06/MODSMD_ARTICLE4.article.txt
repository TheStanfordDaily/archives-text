### Charles Simons 
PLAYING to an audience of over 1,000 at yesterday's matinee, the English
Club's production of "Macbeth" was received with enthusiasm, and
proved to be an unqualified success. The regular campus presentation
will be given tonight at 8 o'clock.
When English Club first announced that its annual play this year would be
"Macbeth," the news was received with some degree of apathy, and no little
skepticism. But skeptics has changed to approbation since the first dress
rehearsal, and now everypne around<S >

enthusiasm usually associated with
Ram's Head or Junior Opera, rather
than a Shakespearian tragedy.
Whether this enthusiasm is due to
the Assembly hall is imbued with the
the sets, by Les Kiler; the music, led
by Warren D. Allen; the acting, by a
cast of experienced people; or the
manner in which the whole production
has rounded into shape, is an open
question. The fact remains that an
unusual spirit of optimism surrounds
the Assembly hall stage, an optimism
which has had no small part in making
"Macbeth" the finished production that
it is.
There are still a few good seats
available, which will go on sale at the
box officec tonight at There will
be the usual cast dance at the Women's
Clubhouse after the show.


The famous banquet scene of "Macbeth," where the murder of King Duncan
drives "Macbeth" to the verge oT insanity. One of the many dramatic moments
in the play to be presented tonight in the Assembly Hall at 8 o'clock.
