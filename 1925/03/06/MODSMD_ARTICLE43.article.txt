# PALMER CLASSIFIES MEXICAN COLLECTION
## 
### 
R. H. Palmer, formerly paleontolo
gist and geologist of the Geological
Institute of Mexico, is now working
in the Stanford geology laboratory,
classifying a large collection of shells,

gathered at Puerto Angel, Mexico.
Palmer will divide the shells into
three groups, giving one to the Stan
ford Geology department, another to
the University of California Geology
department, and keeping the third for
himself. He estimates that there are
140 species of fossils and 200 varieties
of sea shells in the collection.
