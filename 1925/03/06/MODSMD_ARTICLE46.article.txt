# SPORTS OF 1925

### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Add another famous Helen to the list! From Helen of Troy to "Hell 'n'
Maria" these Helens hold their places in the spot light. Helen Wills and
Helen Wainwright are internationally known in the world of sports, and now
Helen Filkey, of Chicago, takes her place beside them.
Who is Helen Filkey? She is a champion girl track and field athlete, holder
of seven world's and one American recordâ€”and only 16 years old. Sprints
and hurdles are her specialties, but she can also broad Jump, high jump and
throw the discus with grace and abandon.
Tom Eck, trainer of distance runners at the University of Chicago, says that
without doubt Helen is the champion all-round girl athlete of the world. We'll
take Tom's word for it, for he won fame years ago as the trainer of that
famous sprint cyclist, "Terrible Swede" Johnson of Minneapolis. Anyway
Helen proved her superiority over fourteen other young Amazons in the
national girls' all-round championship last summer.
Helen was born in 1908, the day after St. Patrick's day, and, like Charlie
Paddock, who is also something of a sprinter, she was frail and sickly as a
baby. Now she is the healthiest student at Lake View High School, stands
5 feet, 5 inches in her track shoes, and competes at the flyweight limit.
