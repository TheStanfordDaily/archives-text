eighty years ago Persia retained her
ancient civilization, untouched by Eu
ropean customs. About that time some
Persians, including the king, went to
France and brought back many French
ideas. Due to this influence there were
many schools established and several
universities. There was considerable
opposition, led~l>y the Persian priests,

Present education in Persia is a mix
ture of ancient Persian ideas and mod

Persia, those who retain the old Per
sian customs and those living under
European circumstances.
