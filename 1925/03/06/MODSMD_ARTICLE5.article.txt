## 
### Jim Adams 
The freshman track team, as yet un
tried, will have the first opportunity to
unveil its power in the interclass meet
tomorrow. Under the guidance of
' Coach R. L. Templeton the freshmen
have shown considerable development,
' with a few individuals giving much
promise of becoming point-getters.
No squad has been picked, Temple
ton prefering to allow any one with
track aspirations to compete. Rupe,
1 who has been leaping over 6 feet in
i the high jump, is ineligible for compe
j tition the rest of the year because of
scholastic difficulties. Nichols, star
hurdler, is ineligible for this quarter
but will be in good standing next quar
[
ter providing he makes good grades.
Tn the sprints, Worthington, Moore,
and Burton are •the most promising
candidates, but none have turned in
; any remarkable times.
The hurdles are well taken care of
by Nichols, Bly, and Bullis. Their
times so far have given promise of
the yearlings gaining a majority of
points in these events in any of their
dual meets.
! M"On ire, Borden, Abramson, and
I
McCall are the leading quarter-milers,
and Smith and Collins are the best in
the half. In the mile and two-mile Nel
son and Ranney are the only freshmen
who have shown any "signs of class.
Nichols Should Star
Nichols gives promise of being a
handy man to have around the field.
Besides the hurdles he should figure
in the pole vault, high jump, and broad
lump. He is at present the best vaulter
on the team, leaping consistently
around 11 feet. Carlsmith and Stanley
are other candidates. Besides Nichols
in the high jump King has potentiali
! ties of developing into a first-class
lumper. He has been going around
G feet with regularity.
Anderson, Salsman, Miller, and Nich
ols are the best hopes in the broad
lump. A large number of fairly good
weight-tossers are working out daily.
Helmke, Bigelow, Post, Everett, and
O'Malley are getting the best distances
! n the shot put. In the discus O'Malley,
Stanley, Gray, Weaver, and Kenaston
appear to be the best material. Stanley,
Joaquin, and Kenaston are the lead
| ing candidates in the javelin.

Joaquin, and Kenaston are the lead
| ing candidates in the javelin.
The freshman track team, as yet un
tried, will have the first opportunity to
unveil its power in the interclass meet
tomorrow. Under the guidance of
' Coach R. L. Templeton the freshmen
have shown considerable development,
' with a few individuals giving much
promise of becoming point-getters.
No squad has been picked, Temple
ton prefering to allow any one with
track aspirations to compete. Rupe,
1 who has been leaping over 6 feet in
i the high jump, is ineligible for compe
j tition the rest of the year because of
scholastic difficulties. Nichols, star
hurdler, is ineligible for this quarter
but will be in good standing next quar
[
ter providing he makes good grades.
Tn the sprints, Worthington, Moore,
and Burton are •the most promising
candidates, but none have turned in
; any remarkable times.
The hurdles are well taken care of
by Nichols, Bly, and Bullis. Their
times so far have given promise of
the yearlings gaining a majority of
points in these events in any of their
dual meets.
! M"On ire, Borden, Abramson, and
I
McCall are the leading quarter-milers,
and Smith and Collins are the best in
the half. In the mile and two-mile Nel
son and Ranney are the only freshmen
who have shown any "signs of class.
Nichols Should Star
Nichols gives promise of being a
handy man to have around the field.
Besides the hurdles he should figure
in the pole vault, high jump, and broad
lump. He is at present the best vaulter
on the team, leaping consistently
around 11 feet. Carlsmith and Stanley
are other candidates. Besides Nichols
in the high jump King has potentiali
! ties of developing into a first-class
lumper. He has been going around
G feet with regularity.
Anderson, Salsman, Miller, and Nich
ols are the best hopes in the broad
lump. A large number of fairly good
weight-tossers are working out daily.
Helmke, Bigelow, Post, Everett, and
O'Malley are getting the best distances
! n the shot put. In the discus O'Malley,
Stanley, Gray, Weaver, and Kenaston
appear to be the best material. Stanley,
Joaquin, and Kenaston are the lead
| ing candidates in the javelin.
