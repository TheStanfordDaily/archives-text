# SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA PLAYS HERE MONDAY
## 
### 
A concert by the San Francisco Sym
phony Orchestra to commemorate
Founders' Day will be given in the
Memorial Church on Monday evening,
March 9. .
The Symphony in D Minor by C<ssar
Franck will open the program. Franck
wrote a great deal of church music,
the symphony standing out as his
unique composition. Suite by Gluck,
arranged by Gevaert, has an appeal to
lovers of the classical style.
The Prelude to Parsifal, by Wagner,
will conclude the program. Wagner
was the first composer to use a theme
to typify a character or object, and
the Prelude is made up of the themes
which recur at the close of the opera
and suggest the Holy Grail.
Founders' Day has been observed
since the University began, this being
the second time that the San Francisco
Symphony Orchestra has given a con
cert on that day.
