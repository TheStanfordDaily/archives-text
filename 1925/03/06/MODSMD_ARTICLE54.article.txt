## "Dodson's Hints on Musical Hits" 
### 
The popular Victor releases this
week —"Nobody Knows What a Red-
Head Mamma Can Do" as interpreted
by George Olsen and His Music, and
"I Can't Stop Babying You" by Charles
Dornberger's orchestra are two excel
lent fox trots in the standard manner,
crisp and snappy—the last having
some very good piano work.
"You and I" by Jack Shilkret's Or
chestra and "Will You Remember Me?"
by Waring's Pennsylvanians—fox trots
whose strongest appeal will be to the
dancer —or the listener—who likes
finish find musicianship in dance re
cordings. *
A clever and tonic song by Wendell
Hall, "I Couldn't Get to It in Time"
and "Oh Mabel" by Billy Murray round
out this week's list.
