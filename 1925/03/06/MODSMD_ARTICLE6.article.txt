# JUNIOR NINE BEATS SOPHOMORES 12 TO 3 IN RAGGED CONTEST
## 
### 
Starring in what might properly be
called "a comedy of errors," the jun
iors handed out a 12 to 3 defeat to
the sophomore interclass nine yester
day. The 1927 team was considerably
weakened on account of having played
a hard game against the seniors Tues
day.
Both squads played about equally
atrocious ball in the field, but Ditzler,
'26, had the edge over Murray, '27, as
a chucker, the latter having pitched
six innings Tuesday. The juniors col
lected one run in the first and three in
the third. They made their big killing
in the fourth, when five men in suc
cession hit safely, and two more
reached first on errors. Five runs were
scored in all.
A couple of runs were chalked up for
the sophomores in the fourth on errors.
Sheets knocked a long three-bagger
that would have gone for a homer if
he had not been slowed down by a
game leg, but was left stranded on
base when the next batter struck out.
Two free passes to first and some
floppy handling of the ball gave the
second-year men another run in the
fifth. The juniors had the game cinched,
but proceeded to add three more tal
lies in the sixth. The lion's share of
the credit for the victory must go to
Ditzler, whose fast ball completely
baffled the sophomores.
