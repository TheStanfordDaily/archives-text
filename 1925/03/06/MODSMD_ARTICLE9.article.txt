# TEMPLETON KEEPS DISTANCE MEN TO SHORT RACES FOR INTERCLASS MEET
## Miller, Leistner to Enter Sprints in Annual Class Track Contest 
### D. W. Meservey 
Full distances will not be run by
most of the varsity traeksters tomor
row in the annual interclass meet to
be held at 1:30 p.m. on the old track.
Coach Templeton feels that his
veterans are nearing top form and may
become stale with too-strenuous work
outs. He has therefore limited a ma
jority of the distance men to shorter
races. Among those affected are Rich
ardson, Kerr, Smith, Miller, Leistner,
and Charles.
Richardson will take Miller's place
in the 440 while the latter will com
pete with Leistner, Campbell, and Gas
par in the 100 and 220. Smith and Kerr
have been running cross-country lately,
so are to be shifted to the 880 along
with Charles, veteran two-miler.
Leistner has been taken from both
hurdle races which will leave Crook
shank, '26, West, '27, Dole, '25, and
Bullis, '28, to fight it out in the highs.
Nichols, '28, will not enter, due to a
slight attack of influenza.
In the low hurdles, eight freshmen
are entered against Dole, '25; Heston,
'26; and West, '27.
Freshmen Lead Entries
Registration figures for the meet
totaled 180 entries yesterday with 1928
leading with ninety-nine. Sophomores
were second with thirty-one, juniors
third with twenty-seven, and seniors
last with twenty-three.
Campbell has been getting into form
the past week and is entered in both
the century and furlong. His arches
are still weak, however, so it is doubt
ful if he will be able to give Gaspar
much competition.
Miller May Be Sprinter
Templeton's move in shifting Miller
to the dashes may possibly be perma
nent if he can develop three capable
1 quarter-milers to take his place. Miller
has been showing up well in the
sprints, especially the 220, and in case
Campbell or Adams do not fulfill pre
dictions in the dashes he may replace
them. His performances, with those
j of Garthwaite, '27, and Frye, '26, who
may be his successors in the 440, will
be closely watched.
I Babcock and Adams, both stellar
| sprinters of last year's freshman team,
! are running in the dashes instead of
j the 440 where they started the season.
Swayne Improved
With Richardson, '26, out of the 880,
i Swayne, '25, should have it fairly easy
in that event although Smith and Kerr
j—both strong runners —may press him.
He is running better than last year.
, Truman is the only sophomore entry.
! Ranney, '28, who is regularly a miler,
