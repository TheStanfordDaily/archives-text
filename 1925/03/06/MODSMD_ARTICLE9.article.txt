# TEMPLETON KEEPS DISTANCE MEN TO SHORT RACES FOR INTERCLASS MEET
## Miller, Leistner to Enter Sprints in Annual Class Track Contest 
### D. W. Meservey 
Full distances will not be run by
most of the varsity traeksters tomor
row in the annual interclass meet to
be held at 1:30 p.m. on the old track.
Coach Templeton feels that his
veterans are nearing top form and may
become stale with too-strenuous work
outs. He has therefore limited a ma
jority of the distance men to shorter
races. Among those affected are Rich
ardson, Kerr, Smith, Miller, Leistner,
and Charles.
Richardson will take Miller's place
in the 440 while the latter will com
pete with Leistner, Campbell, and Gas
par in the 100 and 220. Smith and Kerr
have been running cross-country lately,
so are to be shifted to the 880 along
with Charles, veteran two-miler.
Leistner has been taken from both
hurdle races which will leave Crook
shank, '26, West, '27, Dole, '25, and
Bullis, '28, to fight it out in the highs.
Nichols, '28, will not enter, due to a
slight attack of influenza.
In the low hurdles, eight freshmen
are entered against Dole, '25; Heston,
'26; and West, '27.
Freshmen Lead Entries
Registration figures for the meet
totaled 180 entries yesterday with 1928
leading with ninety-nine. Sophomores
were second with thirty-one, juniors
third with twenty-seven, and seniors
last with twenty-three.
Campbell has been getting into form
the past week and is entered in both
the century and furlong. His arches
are still weak, however, so it is doubt
ful if he will be able to give Gaspar
much competition.
Miller May Be Sprinter
Templeton's move in shifting Miller
to the dashes may possibly be perma
nent if he can develop three capable
1 quarter-milers to take his place. Miller
has been showing up well in the
sprints, especially the 220, and in case
Campbell or Adams do not fulfill pre
dictions in the dashes he may replace
them. His performances, with those
j of Garthwaite, '27, and Frye, '26, who
may be his successors in the 440, will
be closely watched.
I Babcock and Adams, both stellar
| sprinters of last year's freshman team,
! are running in the dashes instead of
j the 440 where they started the season.
Swayne Improved
With Richardson, '26, out of the 880,
i Swayne, '25, should have it fairly easy
in that event although Smith and Kerr
j—both strong runners —may press him.
He is running better than last year.
, Truman is the only sophomore entry.
! Ranney, '28, who is regularly a miler,
may give the upperclassmen a good
run, as will Reasoner, '28.
Work, '27, is still leading the high
jumpers. He seems the most promising
jumper since the days of Howell and
Templeton and may develop into a
champion in a year or so.
Kemnitzer, '25, is the best senior
entry and should be good for several
points. Thompson, '26, West, '27, Rich
man, '27, Rupe, '28, and King, '28, are
the best prospects of the other class
entries.
Broad-Jumpers Even
Crookshank, '26, Macßae, '25, and
Meeks, '27, have been keeping close
together the last week in the broad
jump. This is Crookshank's first year
of eligibility and he looks good to give
the other two much competition. Sals
man is the most likely freshman entry,
having done over 21 feet several times.
Templeton is still on the lookout for
pole-vaulters. None of the present as
pirants can come near to Upson of
California, but second and third place
men may be developed.
Fontaine Best Prospect
Fontaine, '26, is the best prospect
for the first honors tomorrow but is not
eligible for varsity competition. He has
been doing around 12 feet. Scofield, '26,
Cuenod. '27, Pallette, '27, and Lloyd,
'26, are all doing around 11 feet.
Captain Hartranft will give the sen
iors ten points in the shot and discus
but second and third places will be
closely contested. Hoffman, '27, was
to have been good material for this
year's weight team but is not in the
University this quarter.
Arthur, '25, who came close to Hart
ranft in both the discus and shot last
year, should be a strong contender for
second place.
