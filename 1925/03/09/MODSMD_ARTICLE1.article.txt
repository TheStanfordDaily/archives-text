# FRESHMEN EASILY TIE FOURTH IN INTERCLASS MEET
## BABE PADDLERS DEFEAT CAL 34 TO 33 FROSH TROUNCE CUB SWIMMERS BY LONE POINT Varsity Cleans Up to Tune Of 56-12; Relay, Plunge Records Shattered 
### 
Duly humbled in both varsity and
freshman swimming events, the Bruin
slunk back to his lair Saturday afternoon
after the Cardinal point totals indicated
that Brandsten-coached men were again
the superior of the Blue and Gold.
The varsity swimmers, lowering two
records in their onslaught, piled up 56
points to California's 12, while the fresh
men barely nosed out their rivals with a
one point margin, 34 to 33. Ogden,
Cardinal plunger, added almost two feet
on the plunge record, going in a sub
marine-like manner for seventy-three
feet ten inches. The Stanford relay men,
as had been anticipated, lowered the rec
ord. Their time was 1:05 2-5.
Arden Allen failed by three-fifths of a
second to touch the Stanford-California
record in the 100-yard backstroke. He
had been counted on all season as one
of the best bets to shatter a record in
Saturday's meet, but because of having
been needed both in the relay and the
220, in which he took second, before
swimming the backstroke race, he was
not fresh enough.
In the 220-yard free style event Carl
Stevenson, barely pressed, had things all
lo himself. Though he missed by two
fifths of a second to touch the record,
he showed himself as being one of the
flashiest little swimmers to don the
Cardinal for some time.
While the Stanford varsity was piling
up points in an almost 5 to 1 ratio, the
Cardinal freshmrn were having a harder
time to down the Bruins. Two things
made the duel between the freshmen of
great interest; first, the fact that Dan
ford, one of the best sprinters in the
ranks of the Cardinals, had a sprained
ankle and was not at his best; and, sec
ond, the possibility that the Blue and
Gold might have a man in reserve that
would take the 100-yard backstroke
event.
The results of the diving were not
announced until the end of the meet, and
up to that time the little Bears led with
a seven-point advantage. Mills and
Mustain contributed eight points in this
event to give Brandsten a second victory.
Moore copped the 100-yard backstroke
after a hard struggle.
