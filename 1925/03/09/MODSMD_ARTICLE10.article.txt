# FRESHMEN EASILY WIN TENNIS MATCHES FROM P.A.H.S.
## 
### 
Winning all of the six matches in
straight sets, and losing a total of
only seventeen games, the freshman
tennis team easily defeated Palo Alto
High School in their first match of
the year, last Saturday morning.
The match Saturday was not a real
test of the freshmen's strength, as the
scores indicate. A match is scheduled
for next week with Oakland High
School, and it is expected that the
matches will be more closely con
tested.
Herrington, playing first singles, de
feated Kloatz at 6-2, 6-1. Thomas had
no difficulty in winning from Plymire
6-3, 6-0. McElveny won from Nyquist
6-2, 6-0. Castellanos won the final
singles match from Castle 6-1, 6-1.
In the doubles, Herrington and
Thomas won from Kloatz, 6-1, 6-2. Mc-
Elveny and Castellanos won from Ny
quist and Castle, 6-1, 6-3.
The freshman squad will play two
ranking matches this week, and the
first of next week a team will be
picked which will compete against
California on April 4.
