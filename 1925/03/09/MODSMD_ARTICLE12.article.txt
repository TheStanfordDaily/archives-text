# COLLINS TAKES MILE; 440 WON By ABRAMES, '28
## Many Stars Do Not Compete; Team's Strength Not Shown Saturday 
### 
INTERCLASS TRACK RESULTS
Seniors 59 5-6
Juniors 59 2-6
Sophomores 30 2-6
Freshmen 18 3-6
Placing heavily in all events except the
mile and the relay, and making prac
tically a clean sweep of the weights, the
1925 track squad took high honors in the
interclass track meet held last Saturday.
The seniors won by half a point from
their nearest competitors, the juniors,
who had gained a ten-point advantage
in winning the Irish Marathon last week.
Except for heaves of 138 feet and 48
feet 1 inch in the discus and shotput, and
Evers' toss of 178 feet in the javelin,
most of times and distances were poorer
than those made last year. This was due
largely to the absence of four of the
stars from competition, and the entrance
of men in events other than their regu
lar races.
Track Captain Hartranft repeated his
demonstration of last year and came
through with wins in the shotput and
discus. Miller, who was recently
switched to the dashes, won the shorter
sprint, and was a close second in the
220. In the 880 Charles pulled a sur
prise in leading both Swayne and Kerr
to the tape.
Even in the absence of some of their
best men, the freshmen furnished plenty
of surprises during the afternoon. They
garnered two first places. In the 440
Abramson uncorked a finishing sprint and
led the field by several yards at the finish.
Collins and Nelson, both freshmen, took
first and second in the mile, the lime be
ing 4 :45 2-5, which is above the average
for a freshman runner.

Placing heavily in all events except the
mile and the relay, and making prac
tically a clean sweep of the weights, the
1925 track squad took high honors in the
interclass track meet held last Saturday.
The seniors won by half a point from
their nearest competitors, the juniors,
who had gained a ten-point advantage
in winning the Irish Marathon last week.
Except for heaves of 138 feet and 48
feet 1 inch in the discus and shotput, and
Evers' toss of 178 feet in the javelin,
most of times and distances were poorer
than those made last year. This was due
largely to the absence of four of the
stars from competition, and the entrance
of men in events other than their regu
lar races.
Track Captain Hartranft repeated his
demonstration of last year and came
through with wins in the shotput and
discus. Miller, who was recently
switched to the dashes, won the shorter
sprint, and was a close second in the
220. In the 880 Charles pulled a sur
prise in leading both Swayne and Kerr
to the tape.
Even in the absence of some of their
best men, the freshmen furnished plenty
of surprises during the afternoon. They

INTERCLASS TRACK RESULTS
Seniors 59 5-6
Juniors 59 2-6
Sophomores 30 2-6
Freshmen 18 3-6
Placing heavily in all events except the
mile and the relay, and making prac
tically a clean sweep of the weights, the
1925 track squad took high honors in the
interclass track meet held last Saturday.
The seniors won by half a point from
their nearest competitors, the juniors,
who had gained a ten-point advantage
in winning the Irish Marathon last week.
Except for heaves of 138 feet and 48
feet 1 inch in the discus and shotput, and
Evers' toss of 178 feet in the javelin,
most of times and distances were poorer
than those made last year. This was due
largely to the absence of four of the
stars from competition, and the entrance
of men in events other than their regu
lar races.
Track Captain Hartranft repeated his
demonstration of last year and came
through with wins in the shotput and
discus. Miller, who was recently
switched to the dashes, won the shorter
sprint, and was a close second in the
220. In the 880 Charles pulled a sur
prise in leading both Swayne and Kerr
to the tape.
Even in the absence of some of their
best men, the freshmen furnished plenty
of surprises during the afternoon. They
garnered two first places. In the 440
Abramson uncorked a finishing sprint and
led the field by several yards at the finish.
Collins and Nelson, both freshmen, took
first and second in the mile, the lime be
ing 4 :45 2-5, which is above the average
for a freshman runner.
A complete summary of the results
follow:
100-yard dash—Gaspar, '26, first; Mil
ler, '26. second ; Leistner, '25, third; Bab
cock, '27, fourth. Time, :10 1-5."
