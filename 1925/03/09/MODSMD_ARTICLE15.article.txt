# 1928 at the Helm
## 
### 
With this issue of the Daily Palo Alto, members of the Class of
1928 try their luck in maintaining the annual tradition of a "Fresh
man Edition." By custom this edition's makeup is scrambled in a
manner that gives any journalist a start, and a freshman not
familiar with the tradition pauses to wonder what on earth his class
has done -to the "Dippy." So much for the why and wherefore of
this sheet.
Perhaps the originators of the first "Freshman Edition" sought
to give the campus an idea of what the Daily Palo Alto could be
but in its regular issues is not. And what should be more fitting
than to give the babe class the rather dubious honor of furnishing
this criterion?
Yet a remark made by an upperclassman recently that the "Fresh
man Editions" are, in the eyes of some, generally more interesting
than the regular editions, deserves mention in this issue at least.
THE FACULTY, in a rather subtle manner in the last issue
of Chaparral, "pulled the leg," as our English friends would say, of
dramatics reporters of the Daily. It being so near finals week we
forebear to answer the worthy ones.
