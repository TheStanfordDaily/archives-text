# Dr. Jordan on Founders' Day
## 
### 
No one is better fitted to express the thought and sentiment
which should pervade the campus on Founders' Day than David
Starr Jordan, chancellor emeritus. As first president of the Univer
sity and as companion and understanding friend of Senator Stanford
his name early grew to be inseparable with that of the University.
With which remark we leave the column to Dr. Jordan.
It is well for our students to realize, not only the present greatness and peren
nial charm of Stanford University, but something of the conditions under which
the University arose, and of the noble mind and character of the man in whose
brain it originated.
Leland Stanford, born in Watervliet, New York, March 9, 1824, Senator from
California and the efficient and popular war Governor of the State, was one of
four men who undertook the bold and risky proposition of building a railway
across the continent. Overcoming many and varied difficulties, they made the enter
prise a success, and out of the generous earnings of the Central Pacific, they built
up the greater system of the Southern Pacific, extending with its branches from
San Francisco to New Orleans, Ogden and Portland.
His hopes and those of his wise and capable wife, Jane Lathrop Stanford, were
centered in their only child, a bright and handsome youth, Leland Stanford Junior.
In March, 1884, this lad of sixteen was stricken in Rome by the mosquito-borne
"Roman fever," dying soon after in Florence.
After his death the parents thought long and earnestly as to what could be
done with their fortune. After an almost sleepless night, so Mr. Stanford told me,
he awoke with these words on his lips: "The children of California shall be my
children." To this purpose the remaining seven years of his life were sacredly
devoted, and in the twelve years which followed his death in 1893, his widow had
no other thought than to realize his plans. He was at first in doubt as to whether
to build a great museum with lecture halls and research laboratories, a great
engineering school, or to combine the two and other ideas in founding a great
university. The last plan was finally chosen, and the University is here, and its
influence is felt all over the civilized world. It is for you and for every past and
future graduate to extend and expand this influence, making your own part of the
world and the earth itself a better place to live in. For, as Emerson said: "The
world is upheld by the influence of good men: they make the world wholesome."
It is well to remember that a university is not a chance product of money and
publicity. The founder's far-reaching influence never rested wholly or even mainly
on wealth. In his early careCr, he was far from affluent, and a fundamental sim
plicity of life kept him always in touch with the people. In person of massive
build, and rather slow-spoken though extremely direct and earnest, he had a con
siderable fund of dry humor, and a rarely beautiful smile which illumined his
otherwise impassive face. Broad-minded and long-headed, he was a keen but
sympathetic and benevolent observer of human nature. I never heard him speak
in bitter terms of any opponent. His kindness of heart was naturally sometimes
imposed upon by political and other parasites; yet even in these matters he was
seldom deceived, being able to penetrate the various masks with which ambitious
impecuniosity tries to disguise itself. In the words of his secretary, Herbert C.
Nash, "he was active when other men were idle; he was generous when other men
were grasping; he was lofty when other men were bas."

Caring nothing for creed or ceremony, he had nevertheless a deeply religious
nature. To him, the feeling of awe and reverence which constitute religion form
the basis of character. He recognized certain emotional values, and his thelogical
position, the result of clear thinking, combined with warm feeling, might have
been partially defined as "Unitarian Methodist." His conception of the goodness
of God, the measure of divine bounty, he put into the form of an epigram which,
with his approval, we placed on the title page of the University Register:
"The benevolence of the Creator toward man on earth, and t4ie possi
bilities of humanity, arc one and the same."
Afterward, a sentence in one of my early addresses, "A generous education is
the birthright of every man and woman in America," caught his attention, and he
asked to have that appear with the other. After his death, Mrs. Stanford wrote:
"If a firm belief in a bcneficient Creator, a profound admiration for
Jesus of Nazareth and His teachings, and the ccrtainty of a personal life
hereafter, constitute religion, then Leland Stanford was a religious man.
The narrow walls of a creed could not confine him; therefore he was not
a professed member of any church, for in each confession of faith he
found something to which he could not subscribe. But for the principles
of religion he had a profound veneration; in his heart were the true senti-

ments of Christianty, and he often said that in his opinion the Golden
Rule was the cornerstone of all religion."
As a natural outcome of this attitude he provided in the endowment grant that
the University was to be free from all ecclesiastic ties, while at the same time it
should teach the basic principles of religion and morality.
In the document he also directed that it should be kept free from political as
well as sectarian entanglements.
The two provisions just noted were later more explicitly stated by Mrs.
Stanford:
"The University must be forever maintained upon a strictly non
partisan and non-sectarian basis. It must never become an instrument in
the hands of any political party or any. religious sect or organization.
. . . The moral and religious development of the University will be
better accomplished if utterly free from all denominational alliances, how
ever slight the bond may be.. . . . No profession of religious faith
shall be exacted of any one for any purpose."
Again, on October 3, 1902, in an address to the permanent board of trustees
that day organized, she further said: *
"Unless it maintains a strictly non-partisan attitude upon all political
questions, this institution with its large resources might well become a
public menace and forfeit all right to the special consideration it has re
ceived from the hands of members of all parties."
His educational ideals, largely drawn from pratical experience, were also in
part a reflex of the views of certain friends, especially Agassiz, White, and
Oilman. A conception of education as "training for usefulness in life" was his
central idea. But to him usefulness meant not only material efficiency, but intel
lectual and spiritual helpfulness also. On the influence of the teacher as a
moral force he laid great stress. His primary concepts involved individualism in
education, early choice of profession, and broad-based specialization along some
particular line. From Agassiz he had derived a realizing sense of the impelling
force of man's intellectual needsâ€”"that hunger and thirst after truth that only
the destitute student knows." "Man's physical wants are slight," he often said,
"but his intellectual needs are bounded only by his capacity."
No finer epitaph could be written than the closing words of the funeral sermon,
by Dr. Horatio Stebbins:
To the railroad men who bore the casket he said: "Bearers, men of iron
hands and iron hearts: gentle up your strength a little as you bear his body forth;
for 'tis a man ye bear, and lay it safely in its last strong resting place."
