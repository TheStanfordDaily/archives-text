FOREWORD
To our dear public (whoever he is).
Ladies, gentlemen, and oh-so-roughs:
We hereby wish to announce the adop
tion of a new name and still newer pol
icy by this well-known and popular col
umn. While under our direction it will
cease to be known by the crude, vulgar,
and meaningless moniker of Cabbages.
Henceforth and from now on it will dis
play its wares under the title of Sauer
krauts. "And why?" you ask. Well, to
indicate that it stands in the same rela
tion to the puerile space filler formerly
found here as finished product docs to
the raw material and also to suggest the
strong and biting quality of its wit.
First of all, we proclaim to the world
that the pernicious and deleterious pol
icy of poking fun at the acts of the ad
ministration of this University will
henceforth cease, quit, and stop. From
now on the policies of the powers that
be will be our policies and nowhere will
a stauncher and more valiant supporter
of all rules and regulations, restrictions,
Encina "food," and verbotens (not to
mention traditions) will be found than
scrappy little Sauerkrauts (registered
U. S. patent office).
Another step in advance to be taken in
the enlargement and extension of the
field of this peerless column. We pro
pose to make Sauerkrauts (registered
U. S. patent office) the sort of section
you will instinctively turn to before any
thing else and the sort you will want to
show your folks. With this end in view
we are accepting and printing all earnest
and thought-provoking viewpoints sub
mitted by scholars with an average of
"B" or above. In keeping with our
policy of "bigger, better, and more of
it" we promise a series of poems whose
literary merit is equaled only by their
brilliance. We will also run sections on
"Advice to the Lovelorn," "Shop Hints,"
"How to Make It," "The Canoeist's
Guide," and, if we get sufficient encour
agement, a Rover Boy serial. In addi

tion to this, Sauerkrauts will soon go on
the air with its brand new .00005-watt
broadcasting station BOOBEM. Watch
for further announcements in this line.

policy of "bigger, better, and more of

literary merit is equaled only by their
brilliance. We will also run sections on
"Advice to the Lovelorn," "Shop Hints,"
"How to Make It," "The Canoeist's
Guide," and, if we get sufficient encour

FOREWORD
To our dear public (whoever he is).
Ladies, gentlemen, and oh-so-roughs:
We hereby wish to announce the adop
tion of a new name and still newer pol
icy by this well-known and popular col
umn. While under our direction it will
cease to be known by the crude, vulgar,
and meaningless moniker of Cabbages.
Henceforth and from now on it will dis
play its wares under the title of Sauer
krauts. "And why?" you ask. Well, to
indicate that it stands in the same rela
tion to the puerile space filler formerly
found here as finished product docs to
the raw material and also to suggest the
strong and biting quality of its wit.
First of all, we proclaim to the world
that the pernicious and deleterious pol
icy of poking fun at the acts of the ad
ministration of this University will
henceforth cease, quit, and stop. From
now on the policies of the powers that
be will be our policies and nowhere will
a stauncher and more valiant supporter
of all rules and regulations, restrictions,
Encina "food," and verbotens (not to
mention traditions) will be found than
scrappy little Sauerkrauts (registered
U. S. patent office).
Another step in advance to be taken in
the enlargement and extension of the
field of this peerless column. We pro
pose to make Sauerkrauts (registered
U. S. patent office) the sort of section
you will instinctively turn to before any
thing else and the sort you will want to
show your folks. With this end in view
we are accepting and printing all earnest
and thought-provoking viewpoints sub
mitted by scholars with an average of
"B" or above. In keeping with our
policy of "bigger, better, and more of
it" we promise a series of poems whose
literary merit is equaled only by their
brilliance. We will also run sections on
"Advice to the Lovelorn," "Shop Hints,"
"How to Make It," "The Canoeist's
Guide," and, if we get sufficient encour
agement, a Rover Boy serial. In addi

tion to this, Sauerkrauts will soon go on
the air with its brand new .00005-watt
broadcasting station BOOBEM. Watch
for further announcements in this line.
