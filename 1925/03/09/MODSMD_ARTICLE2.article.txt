# Freshman Teams Exhibit Class In All Branches Of Athletics
## 
### 
Coming out on top in football, basket-1
ball, water polo, and swimming, the j
freshman class has enjoyed a success i
which there is good reason to believe
will lie kept intact in track, baseball, and
fencing still to come. Besides a well
earned and decisive victory on the grid
iron, the fro.?h accomplished the un- j
precedented feat of administering two
straight defeats to California in basket
ball and this after eighteen men had been
cut from the squad by ineligibility.
"Husky" Hunt, who has brought
yearling athletics to a topnotch point
since coming here, says, "The steady im
provement of freshman athletics has
been maintained by the showing so far
of 1928. The football team was the
strongest and most capable of any with.n
my experience and contained stars of,

outstanding ability. Although the basket
ball team was lacking perhaps in the ex
perienced players of last year, by hard
practice they developed teamwork that
enabled them to take the series without
losing a game. It would still be rash to
make any definite predictions in regard to
baseball, but owing to the training the
men have been receiving during the fall
and winter under Coach Harry Wolter,
they have gotten into great shape."
"With stars such as Captain Robesky
and Post in the line and Altaffer, Mur
phy, Hill, Dorcy, and Millage in the
backfield it is easy to see that *28 will
provide valuable support for next year's
varsity team. Captain Clark and Dennis
showed up to good advantage in basket
ball. Although the cut took eighteen
men from the basketball squad and made
things look pretty gloomy for a while,
those left, with steady work and strict
attention to business, produced a real
team. The California freshman team of
this year was undoubtedly harder to beat
than that of l>st year."
Eligibility Important
"Just how valuable '28 is going to
prove to varsity athletics depends to a
great extent on how many of the men
keep their eligibility by studying con
sistently. Naturally a man who is 'on
the ragged edge' scholastically cannot
be depended upon for a team no matter
how much of an athlete he may be."
Hunt is proud of the fact that three
>ut of five basketball players had "B"
averages and that the entire baseball
squad was "plus."
Under Coach Ernst Brandsten, winning
in water sports has become sort of a
tradition that 1928 has been able to up
hold with consistency. The score of
four to nothing by which the Bruin cubs
were trounced in water polo does not
half indicate the Cardinal's superiority,
for had it not been for the forwards
missing a series of easy shots at the goal,
the count might possibly have been ten
to nothing.
The solitary defeat administered last
quarter by the Olympic Club junior
water polo team was more than atoned
for when the Winged "O" players were
decisively defeated in a return game in
their own pool.
Barely Wins In Swimming
A margin of one point was all that
kept the swimming meet from resulting
in a tie, but the team deserves credit for
being able to pull through with a victory
against the strongest freshman team that
has swam for California in many years.
First places in diving, plunges, and
breaststroke were able to make up for
the unexpected scarcity of points in the
free style events.
Promise Shown in Baseball
Some promising material and plenty
of practice has built up a baseball team
that gives every promise of some snappy
and successful playing during the season.
The players have come through in the
five games already behind them in good
form. Cypher, catcher; Philippi, pitcher;
Garibaldi and Nisson are showing to
great advantage. It is probable that next
year's varsity will receive some real ma
terial from this team.
Next Friday for the first time in ath
letic history a three-man freshman fenc
ing team will try its skill against Cali
fornia, and Harry Maloney is optimistic
about the outcome. Three fencers will
be chosen from the following: Noack,
Hyatt, Coolidge, and Hull to represent
the freshmen.
According to Maloney, it is unfortu
nate that no freshman boxing compe
tition will take place, for he feels that
he has this year the finest bunch of
yearling scrappers who have ever donned
| the gloves.

men from the basketball squad and made
things look pretty gloomy for a while,
those left, with steady work and strict

team. The California freshman team of
this year was undoubtedly harder to beat

Eligibility Important
"Just how valuable '28 is going to
prove to varsity athletics depends to a
great extent on how many of the men
keep their eligibility by studying con
sistently. Naturally a man who is 'on
the ragged edge' scholastically cannot
be depended upon for a team no matter
how much of an athlete he may be."
Hunt is proud of the fact that three
>ut of five basketball players had "B"
averages and that the entire baseball
squad was "plus."
Under Coach Ernst Brandsten, winning
in water sports has become sort of a
tradition that 1928 has been able to up
hold with consistency. The score of
four to nothing by which the Bruin cubs
were trounced in water polo does not
half indicate the Cardinal's superiority,
for had it not been for the forwards
missing a series of easy shots at the goal,
the count might possibly have been ten
to nothing.
The solitary defeat administered last
quarter by the Olympic Club junior
water polo team was more than atoned
for when the Winged "O" players were
decisively defeated in a return game in
their own pool.
Barely Wins In Swimming
A margin of one point was all that
kept the swimming meet from resulting
in a tie, but the team deserves credit for
being able to pull through with a victory
against the strongest freshman team that
has swam for California in many years.
First places in diving, plunges, and
breaststroke were able to make up for
the unexpected scarcity of points in the
free style events.
Promise Shown in Baseball
Some promising material and plenty
of practice has built up a baseball team
that gives every promise of some snappy
and successful playing during the season.
The players have come through in the
five games already behind them in good
form. Cypher, catcher; Philippi, pitcher;
Garibaldi and Nisson are showing to
great advantage. It is probable that next
year's varsity will receive some real ma
terial from this team.
Next Friday for the first time in ath
letic history a three-man freshman fenc
ing team will try its skill against Cali
fornia, and Harry Maloney is optimistic
about the outcome. Three fencers will
be chosen from the following: Noack,
Hyatt, Coolidge, and Hull to represent
the freshmen.
According to Maloney, it is unfortu
nate that no freshman boxing compe
tition will take place, for he feels that
he has this year the finest bunch of
yearling scrappers who have ever donned
| the gloves.

Coming out on top in football, basket-1
ball, water polo, and swimming, the j
freshman class has enjoyed a success i
which there is good reason to believe
will lie kept intact in track, baseball, and
fencing still to come. Besides a well
earned and decisive victory on the grid
iron, the fro.?h accomplished the un- j
precedented feat of administering two
straight defeats to California in basket
ball and this after eighteen men had been
cut from the squad by ineligibility.
"Husky" Hunt, who has brought
yearling athletics to a topnotch point
since coming here, says, "The steady im
provement of freshman athletics has
been maintained by the showing so far
of 1928. The football team was the
strongest and most capable of any with.n
my experience and contained stars of,

outstanding ability. Although the basket
ball team was lacking perhaps in the ex
perienced players of last year, by hard
practice they developed teamwork that
enabled them to take the series without
losing a game. It would still be rash to
make any definite predictions in regard to
baseball, but owing to the training the
men have been receiving during the fall
and winter under Coach Harry Wolter,
they have gotten into great shape."
"With stars such as Captain Robesky
and Post in the line and Altaffer, Mur
phy, Hill, Dorcy, and Millage in the
backfield it is easy to see that *28 will
provide valuable support for next year's
