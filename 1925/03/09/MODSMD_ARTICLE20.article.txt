"While the summer program at Stan»
ford does not embody any of the Chau

mer sessions," said Sellards, "the Uni

provide something more than instruction
for the summer students.
"Many in attendance come for the sum
mer only. Stanford puts at their dis
posal all her resources. The University
will provide lectures and concerts on the
campus throughout the summer quarter
for the benefit of the entire community.
"The Theater Workshop will produce,
as in the past, a series of modern plays
and give an outdoor representation of the
Greek drama, Electra. The University
recognizes that the summer is normailly a
holiday time ; consequently it will arrange
week-end trips and excursions."

and give an outdoor representation of the
Greek drama, Electra. The University

holiday time ; consequently it will arrange
week-end trips and excursions."
