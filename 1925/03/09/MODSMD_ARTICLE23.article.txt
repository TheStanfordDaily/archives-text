# Memorable Church Organ Swells With Improvements
## 
### 
The organ in the Memorial Church is
now undergoing extensive enlargement

and improvement. The new console built
by the Skinner Organ Company is to be
installed, and the old organ is to be sup- j
plied with new action, improved swell
boxes, and two large new sets of pipes. j
a trumpet and diapason on the great
organ. The organ chambers will be en
larged to take care of all future addi
tions.
The new console is very similar in de
sign to the one recently installed by the
Skinner Company in the Palace of the j
Legion of Hoijpr at Lincoln Park. It
will have four manuals and stop knobs j
for the organ as it will be eventually, but
very little addition will be made at the
present time to the old instrument.
