# W. SHAKESPEARE HAS DRAMA POSSIBILITIES
## 
### Mae Tinee 
TO say that "Macbeth" was perfect is too much, but to say that it was a
success is to speak the truth. In common with most of the Stanford
playgoers we were worried about how Gordon Davis was going to put
Shakespeare's tragedy across.
We had a friend in the "Theatre Workshop" class and for a week preceding
the play we plied him with questions about the sets, cast, and everything else

that struck our mind. He was enthu
siastic for some reason which we
hesitated to consider as spontaneous,
but now we are as enthusiastic as he.
Delmer Daves in the title role, to
gether with Helen Feldman as Lady
Macbeth, practically "made" the play.
The mesh of troubles in which Mac
beth was tangled and its consequent
effect on the spirit and mind of the
usurper of Duncan's throne, were writ
ten on his face. All of Dave's ability
was called for in the danger scene
and in the banquet scene when the
apparition appeared. Terror which
seemed to be as real as that we felt
in a bad dream the night after the
Big Game literally emanated from

Dave'c face.
When Lady Macbeth began her part
one-half of the audienced asked the
other half in an ill-concealed whisper,
"Who is she?" Investigation of the
program showed her to be Helen Feld
man.
We recalled our English and won
dered what interpretation she would
place on the character of Lady Mac
benth; would she be the evil genius who
led Macbeth on to the job, or would
she merely be another character? Our
question was answered when, in a
sibilant, suggestive whisper, Lady
Macbeth said, "And when —goes
hence?"
We knew then that Helen Feldman
was going to interpret Lady Macbeth
as a positive character, one who
goaded Macbeth on, one who had
almost as much to do with the mur
der as the murderers themselves. Her
experience on the legitimate stage
served her in good stead and it was
apparent to everyone in the uadience
that here was some high-class acting.
When attempting to give the impres
sion of being under some high emo
tional stress her voicec seemed to
take on just the right strain. In our
opinion Gordon Davis did as good a
Job in casting her for this role as he
has ever done.
Robert Carr as Banquo, friend of
Macbeth and another general in the
king's army, carried his part excep
tionally well. Macduff showed an emo
tion when he learned that his wife
and children had been killed that
made us feel real downcast and sorry
for him. We could hardly wait until
we looked up in the program to see
who he was. To save you the trouble
we'll tell you that it was Raymond
Riese.
From the first eerie scene wherein
the witches on a dimly-lighted stage
gave the necessary "atmosphere," to
the final battle between Malcolm and
Macbeth the audience was treated to
perhaps the most gorgeous and im
pressive line of sets that has yet been
put on on the Stanford stage. Several
of the scenes were of the "impression
istic" type while those like the ban
quet and battlement scenes were of
the "realistic" type. Taken all in all,
the impression which everyone in the
audience seemed to gain was that he
or she had witnessed a classic pre
sented in the most elaborate style.
(Despite the fact that the program
gave the date for the performance of
"Macbeth" as February sixth a large
audience was present last Friday night
(March sixth).

We had a friend in the "Theatre Workshop" class and for a week preceding
the play we plied him with questions about the sets, cast, and everything else

that struck our mind. He was enthu
siastic for some reason which we
hesitated to consider as spontaneous,
but now we are as enthusiastic as he.
Delmer Daves in the title role, to
gether with Helen Feldman as Lady
Macbeth, practically "made" the play.
The mesh of troubles in which Mac
beth was tangled and its consequent
effect on the spirit and mind of the
usurper of Duncan's throne, were writ
ten on his face. All of Dave's ability
was called for in the danger scene
and in the banquet scene when the
apparition appeared. Terror which
seemed to be as real as that we felt
in a bad dream the night after the
Big Game literally emanated from

Dave'c face.
When Lady Macbeth began her part
one-half of the audienced asked the
other half in an ill-concealed whisper,
"Who is she?" Investigation of the
program showed her to be Helen Feld
man.
We recalled our English and won
dered what interpretation she would
place on the character of Lady Mac
benth; would she be the evil genius who
led Macbeth on to the job, or would
she merely be another character? Our
question was answered when, in a
sibilant, suggestive whisper, Lady
Macbeth said, "And when —goes
hence?"
We knew then that Helen Feldman
was going to interpret Lady Macbeth
as a positive character, one who
goaded Macbeth on, one who had
almost as much to do with the mur
der as the murderers themselves. Her
experience on the legitimate stage
served her in good stead and it was
apparent to everyone in the uadience
that here was some high-class acting.
When attempting to give the impres
sion of being under some high emo
tional stress her voicec seemed to
take on just the right strain. In our
opinion Gordon Davis did as good a
Job in casting her for this role as he
has ever done.
Robert Carr as Banquo, friend of
Macbeth and another general in the
king's army, carried his part excep
tionally well. Macduff showed an emo
tion when he learned that his wife
and children had been killed that
made us feel real downcast and sorry
for him. We could hardly wait until
we looked up in the program to see
who he was. To save you the trouble
we'll tell you that it was Raymond
Riese.
From the first eerie scene wherein
the witches on a dimly-lighted stage
gave the necessary "atmosphere," to
the final battle between Malcolm and
Macbeth the audience was treated to
perhaps the most gorgeous and im
pressive line of sets that has yet been
put on on the Stanford stage. Several
of the scenes were of the "impression
istic" type while those like the ban
quet and battlement scenes were of
the "realistic" type. Taken all in all,
the impression which everyone in the
audience seemed to gain was that he
or she had witnessed a classic pre
sented in the most elaborate style.
(Despite the fact that the program
gave the date for the performance of
"Macbeth" as February sixth a large
audience was present last Friday night
(March sixth).

TO say that "Macbeth" was perfect is too much, but to say that it was a
success is to speak the truth. In common with most of the Stanford
playgoers we were worried about how Gordon Davis was going to put
Shakespeare's tragedy across.
