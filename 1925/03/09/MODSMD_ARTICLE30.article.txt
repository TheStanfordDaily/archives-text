Playing loosely at times but lighten
ing up in the pinches, the Stanford
frosh baseball nine Saturday held the
Berkeley High Yellowjackets to one
run, meanwhile pounding out six hits
for three markers and the victory.
This is the fifth straight win In five
starts for Coach "Husky" Hunt's
charges.
The frosh broke into the scoring
column in the first inning. Don Gari
baldi, second baseman, slammed out a
hard drive to right center field for a
three-base hit, and was brought in by
Cook Sypher's single.
Two more runs were brought in in
the fifth when Price singled, was ad
vanced to second on Bush's walk, and
scored on the throw-in ffom Gari
baldi's long sacrifice fly. Bush scored
a moment later when the Berkeley
second baseman muffed Maguire's
high fly. Berkeley scored in the third
when Wilson walked and was brought
in on a hit and an error.
Bob Philippi, regular pitcher for the
frosh, went the whole game. Phil was
a little wild at times, but settled down
with men on bases and pitched air
tight ball.
His support was slack at times, but
came through in the pinches. A double
play in the first inning, Bush to Gari
baldi to McGuire, was well executed
and cut short a Berkeley rally.
At the plate Garibaldi, with two hits
in four times at bat, led the frosh,
while Frazier, of Berkeley, gathered
two singles in five times up. Nissen,
frosh outfielder, put two hard drives
deep into the outfield but sensational
catches in both cases kept him from
hits.
The frosh lineup included Syplier,
catcher; Philippi, pitcher; Maguire,
first; Garibaldi, second; Bush, short;
Price and Snyde, third; Nissen, left
field; Weaver, center field; and Simms
and Clark, right field.

one capable man in each event and others
are being developed who will probably

take part in the meet with the San Jose
Teachers College.
Abramson, whose red hot sprint at the
finish of the 440 was the big thrill of
the interclass meet, should do well. Ran
ney in the distances, is a potential cham
pion. Collins and Nelson are also good
in the longer races, with the former go
ing great in the half. Rupe is going well
in the discus and, with King, is a bet for
the high jump. In the sprints Burton
will doubtless show up to excellent ad
vantage, and probably in the broad jump
along with Salsman. The versatile Nich

number of events besides his specialty of
the hurdle races.

Abramson, whose red hot sprint at the
finish of the 440 was the big thrill of
the interclass meet, should do well. Ran
ney in the distances, is a potential cham

in the longer races, with the former go
ing great in the half. Rupe is going well
in the discus and, with King, is a bet for
the high jump. In the sprints Burton
will doubtless show up to excellent ad
vantage, and probably in the broad jump
along with Salsman. The versatile Nich

number of events besides his specialty of

Playing loosely at times but lighten
ing up in the pinches, the Stanford
frosh baseball nine Saturday held the
Berkeley High Yellowjackets to one
run, meanwhile pounding out six hits
for three markers and the victory.
This is the fifth straight win In five
starts for Coach "Husky" Hunt's
charges.
The frosh broke into the scoring
column in the first inning. Don Gari
baldi, second baseman, slammed out a
hard drive to right center field for a
three-base hit, and was brought in by
Cook Sypher's single.
Two more runs were brought in in
the fifth when Price singled, was ad
vanced to second on Bush's walk, and
scored on the throw-in ffom Gari
baldi's long sacrifice fly. Bush scored
a moment later when the Berkeley
second baseman muffed Maguire's
high fly. Berkeley scored in the third
when Wilson walked and was brought
in on a hit and an error.
Bob Philippi, regular pitcher for the
frosh, went the whole game. Phil was
a little wild at times, but settled down
with men on bases and pitched air
tight ball.
His support was slack at times, but
came through in the pinches. A double
play in the first inning, Bush to Gari
baldi to McGuire, was well executed
and cut short a Berkeley rally.
At the plate Garibaldi, with two hits
in four times at bat, led the frosh,
while Frazier, of Berkeley, gathered
two singles in five times up. Nissen,
frosh outfielder, put two hard drives
deep into the outfield but sensational
catches in both cases kept him from
hits.
The frosh lineup included Syplier,
catcher; Philippi, pitcher; Maguire,
first; Garibaldi, second; Bush, short;
Price and Snyde, third; Nissen, left
field; Weaver, center field; and Simms
and Clark, right field.
