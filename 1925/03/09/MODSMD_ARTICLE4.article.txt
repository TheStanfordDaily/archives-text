# STANFORD POLO TEAM BEATEN BY ARMY FOUR 6 TO 5
## 
### 
Held scoreless throughout the last
half while their opponents were mark
ing up four goal√ü, the Stanford pololsts
were defeated 6 to 5 by the Thirtieth
Infantry four in a game played Friday
afternoon on the highway field.
The Cardinals led at half time 5 to
2, but weakened in the next two
periods and allowed the Army men to
cut their lead to one goal at the end
of the fifth chukker, when the score
stood 5 to 4 for the Cards.
In the sixth and final period, how
ever, the Stanford defense could not
stop the Presidio men, whose fast
riding and hard hitting netted them
two goals for victory. Lieutenant
Dierking, No. 2, was largely responsi
ble for the infantry team's comeback
in this period.
Irwin Stars
For Stanford Johnny Irwin, playing
at No. 2 position, was the individual
star. Irwin scored three goals, and his
nervy and fast riding was a feature
of the game.
This game had no bearing on the
result of the three-game series, as
the Cards had already chalked up two
victories over the infantry team.
Captain J. M. Jenkins, Stanford
coach, has announced that in all prob
ability two games will be played with
the University of Oregon team this
month. These two games will be
played on the highway field March 21
and 24, and the Cardinal team will
have no matches until that time.
Friday's lineups were:
Stanford (5) Infantry (6)
Thomas, Krohn 1 Capt. Hudgins
Irwin 2 Lieut. Dierking
Laub, Dorcy 3 Lieut. Beale
Trotter 4 Capt. Scott
Referee, Colonel Henessy.
