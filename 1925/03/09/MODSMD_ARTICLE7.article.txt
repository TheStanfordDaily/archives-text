Each year two members of the junior class, a man and a woman, are
selected to place flowers in front of the Mausoleum every Sunday as a tribute
to the founders. The classes will meet in front of the Administration building

and will marrh in a body to the
Mausoleum.
Under the direction of Alfred Hertz
the entire San Francisco Symphony
Orrhestra will, at 8 o'dlok tonight, in
Orchestra will play at 9 o'clock to
night in the Memorial Church, a spe
cial sacred concert. This is the second
time the orchestra has played on
Founders' Day, the other time being
three years ago.
During the day a platform has been
built over the chancel which will be
occupied by the musicians. The senior
class will attend in a body as a
tribute to the memory of the founders.
A group of numbers appropriate to
the spirit of the occasion has been

selected. The three great classics of
orchestral literature chosen are:
"Symphony" by Cesar Franck, "Suite"
by Gluck, aranged by Gavaert, and,
most impressive of all, the Prelude to
Wagner's music-drama, "Parsifal."
Cesar Franck is known as the
"father of modern French music" and
is celebrated for the lofty spirit and
grandeur of his works. Although best
known as a composer of organ music
his orchestral works are marked by
equal nobility as is illustrated by the
symphony on the program tonight.
Gluck, as a composer, had great in
fluence on the opera in which he was
instrumental in bringing about many
reforms.
