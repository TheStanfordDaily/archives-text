# CONCERT IMPRESSES ON FOUNDERS' DAY
## Symphony Orchestra Gives Sacred Music Program In Church 
### Herbert Klein 
A concert of a grandeur and im
pressiveness that harmonized with the
setting of the Memorial Church was
the fitting observance of Founders'
Day last night. It seemed aR though
the church had been especially de
signed to serve as a background for
the music of the San Francisco Sym
phony Orchestra under the baton of
Alfred Hertz. The acoustic qualities
of the building proved to be perfect
land the blare of the brasses and rum
ble of the kettle drums were heard
without the least distortion.
Of the three numbers making up
the program the suite of dances by
Gluck, arranged by Gaevert, was the
i lightest and most tuneful but lacked
I the depth of the other two.
The Prelude to "Parsifal" with its
mysticism and symbolism provided
the religious touch of the concert.
Hertz is well fitted to direct this exact
ing work with understanding, for when
"Parsifal" was produced for the first
time in this country at the Metro
politan Opera of New York in 1903,
Hertz directed It. The atmosphere of
the church seemed to be felt by the
musicians and to be reflected in the
impressive and understanding quality
of their playing.
The Prelude contains the four
themes which make up the religious
element of "Parsifal," a music drama
built around the story of the Holy
Grail. Its purpose is to put the hearer
into the mystical mood of the opera
which follows.
A spirit of calm joy pervaded the
mighty Symphony in D minor by Cesar
Franck which was the stirring finish
to the program. The orchestra played
it in a way which brought out the
lyrical melodies which it contains in
greater abundance than almost any
other symphonic work. '
Due to the curved shape of the chan- |
eel, the wall acted as a reflector to j
intensify the notes of the French ;
horns and trombones and the kettle j
drums. This added to the effectiveness |
of the climaxes of the symphony.
