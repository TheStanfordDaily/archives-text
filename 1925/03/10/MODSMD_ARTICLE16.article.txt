### Charles Simons 
Gordon Davis, University dramatic
coach, leaves next week for New York
and other Eastern cities, where he
will view many of the current attrac
tions and secure rights of presenta
tion for the Stanford assembly hall
next year.
The English Club's production of
"Macbeth" last Friday night completed
the most ambitious and successful dra
-1 matic season that Stanford has yet
! enjoyed. The attractions this year
j were diversified in dramatic interest,
I and every production was received
with favor. So marked has been Davis'
achievements this year that many
articles have appeared about him and
the work he is doing at Stanford in
periodicals and newspapers of nation
al prominence. Such magazines as
"Theatre" and "Drama" have devoted
page reviews of productions which
have been presented during the past
season.
Davis Stars
Gordon Davis himself was the star
of the first play of the season which
was given on October 10. "The Dover
Road," by A. A. Milne, was the vehicle
for his reappearance after an absence
of two years from the Stanford stage,
during which time he traveled with a
stock company throughout European

Presented twice, once during the

first week of college, "The Dover
Road" was a success both times, and
Gordon Davis scored a personal tri

Settings for this play were designed
and executed by Chrysella Dunker and
Les Kiler, the team which has made
a name for themselves as artists of
the first water in stagecraft. Norris
James, Anne Wayland and A. Grove
Day also scored hits in their respec

sponsored by Sword and Sandals So
ciety. An extremely difficult drama to
produce effectively, "R. IJ. R." made
a profound impression on an almost
capacity audience. Alan Robertson
made his first appearance as a leading
man in this play, and gave evidences
then of the talent which made him
the likeable "Matey" of "You and I"
later on in the season. Helen Lewis,
Delmer Daves, and William Thornton
were exceptionally good in their roles,
with Daves' portrayal of Alquist, the
builder, outstanding as a finished per
formance.
Aguin the settings were particularly
effective, and the lighting effects by
Hume West added to the futuristic
