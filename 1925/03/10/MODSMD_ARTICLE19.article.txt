# YEARLING BALL NINE TACKLES PALO ALTO SCHOOL TOMORROW
## 
### 
Palo Alto high school will send the
next team to furnish competition for
the freshman nine. If weather permits
the game will be called at 3:30 o'clock
tomorrow afternoon on the yearling
diamond.
Palo Alto usually produces the
strongest squad in the Peninsula ath
letic league and will force the babes
to extend themselves to win their sev
enth straight game. The freshmen
have been a hard-hitting aggregation
from the start, but there is still plenty
of room for improvement in the field
ing department.
Sobieski will start on the mound
tomorrow. Though he is far from being
a sensational performer he pitches a
good brand of ball and with a reason
able amount of support is dependable.
"Mike" Reynolds will probably hurl
for a few innings. Sypher and Vincenti
will both see action behind the plate.
