# Only Six More Days

It is ordinarily contrary to the policy of the Daily to consider anony
mous material, but the person who submitted the following effusion as
"Another Viewpoint" has expressed an idea to which we are so sympa
thetic that we are pleased to accept the responsibility. Here are the senti
mnts of "A. B.'s Buzz" concerning the approaching scholastic crisis:
As finals whip around with their terrible scareheads and some
times with their knockout blows, we may ask ourselves: Is the
effort that an "A" demands worth it? It seems to me that an "A"
average man has to watch his step. He has to be careful lest he
warp his personality, as is frequently correctly charged. One has
to have a care that he have more than a "mechanism for learning."
He should have a mind.
It's true that business is reacting to ideas. Ample time is neces
sary for this. This reacting to ideas is more important than mem
orizing facts, which last ability happens in many cases to be peculiar
to the "A" student.
Roosevelt, we learn, graduated from Harvard with a "B" aver
age. Woodrow Wilson was thirty-eighth in a class of a hundred
and six, barely getting honors. Those leaders reacted to their read
ing. Many of those who get an "A" average won't do anything that
leads them from the beaten track, nothing that will side-track them
from the path that leads to the "A" grade.
Reaction to ideas is more important than retention of facts. The
former means growth, development, broadening. The latter means
stunting one's mental growth, hindering one's development, fore
closing the mind to any broadening.
Retention is keeping somebody else's knowledge; reaction is
making that knowledge one's own. It's changing the title of owner
ship.
The owner of a "B" in college is generally an "A" man in after
life. It matters little how we stand in the Bawl-Out; it matters
more how we stand in after-life.
And, on the other hand, it must be pointed out that March 17, which
is the day on which final examinations commence, is popularly celebrated
as St. Patrick's Day. Perhaps there is purpose in what appears to be a
coincident. Perhaps somebody thinks that it is high time to drive the
snakes out of Stanford.
We take this opportunity to announce that tomorrow's issue of the
Daily Palo Alto will be the last one this quarter. The staff members
then commence to establish reputations as book-worms, "B" grade, if
possible.
