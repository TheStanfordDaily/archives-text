### Steve O'Donnell 
Note.—Due to the heroism of the
author, the Poet Laureate of Encina
Hal, known to his readers by the
nome dc fountain pen of J. Green
Pea, we are able to present a remarkable
poem. Disguised as a prohibition en
forcement officer, Mr. Pea made his way
through the sponsor line hearing with
him his manuscript upon which he had
labored all night. He wishes to state
that he has strictly amateur standing in
the American Poetic Union, as the charge
that he took pecuniary reward for sup
plying the missing word in a cross-word
puzzle has been cleared up, for he has
never been able to get money for his
poems, anyway. He also wishes to ex
plain that this poem is not to be taken
as a literal description of the hall, but
is rather an impressionistic work—the
reaction of a sensitive soul to what is
going on about him.
Pea says, "I would not for the world
give anyone an impression that living
conditions at Encina are this bad. To
tell the truth, they're worse !"
the poem
OFT IN THE STILLY NIGHT
Tf I had gift of port rare,
I'd hymn the sounds that fill the air
In dear Encina hall.
I'd tell of shrieks, and whoops and
groans,
And midnight clicking of the bones;
Of cries that rend the night,
I'd tell of many an awful sight
In our Encina hall.

I'd write of catcall, whoop, and jeer;
Of windows breaking far and near;
I'd never mention drinks of beer
In our most sober hall.
I'd tell of rocks hurled through the
night;
Of noise that would unnerve you quite;
Of many a bitter verbal fight,
'Mid clash of glass and breaking chair,
And curses whizzing through the air,
As bedlam starts in everywhere,
In our most silent hall.
But, seein' as how T ain't no poet,
(And by this time I guess you know it),
All I can do is crawl in bed
And pull the covers 'round my head,
In vain attempt to sink in sleep,
To fall in slumber, sweet and deep,
In effort vain to keep sound out,
Or ope the window and instead,
To loudly shout:
"KEY DOWN, FROSH!"

I'd write of catcall, whoop, and jeer;
Of windows breaking far and near;
I'd never mention drinks of beer
In our most sober hall.
I'd tell of rocks hurled through the
night;
Of noise that would unnerve you quite;
Of many a bitter verbal fight,
'Mid clash of glass and breaking chair,
And curses whizzing through the air,
As bedlam starts in everywhere,
In our most silent hall.
But, seein' as how T ain't no poet,
(And by this time I guess you know it),
All I can do is crawl in bed
And pull the covers 'round my head,
In vain attempt to sink in sleep,
To fall in slumber, sweet and deep,
In effort vain to keep sound out,
Or ope the window and instead,
To loudly shout:
"KEY DOWN, FROSH!"
-H. A. K.
Note.—Due to the heroism of the
author, the Poet Laureate of Encina
Hal, known to his readers by the
nome dc fountain pen of J. Green
Pea, we are able to present a remarkable
poem. Disguised as a prohibition en
forcement officer, Mr. Pea made his way
through the sponsor line hearing with
him his manuscript upon which he had
labored all night. He wishes to state
that he has strictly amateur standing in
the American Poetic Union, as the charge
that he took pecuniary reward for sup
plying the missing word in a cross-word
puzzle has been cleared up, for he has
never been able to get money for his
poems, anyway. He also wishes to ex
plain that this poem is not to be taken
as a literal description of the hall, but
is rather an impressionistic work—the
reaction of a sensitive soul to what is
going on about him.
Pea says, "I would not for the world
give anyone an impression that living
conditions at Encina are this bad. To
tell the truth, they're worse !"
the poem
OFT IN THE STILLY NIGHT
Tf I had gift of port rare,
I'd hymn the sounds that fill the air
In dear Encina hall.
I'd tell of shrieks, and whoops and
groans,
And midnight clicking of the bones;
Of cries that rend the night,
I'd tell of many an awful sight
In our Encina hall.

I'd write of catcall, whoop, and jeer;
Of windows breaking far and near;
I'd never mention drinks of beer

Of many a bitter verbal fight,
'Mid clash of glass and breaking chair,
And curses whizzing through the air,
As bedlam starts in everywhere,
In our most silent hall.
But, seein' as how T ain't no poet,
(And by this time I guess you know it),
All I can do is crawl in bed
And pull the covers 'round my head,
In vain attempt to sink in sleep,
To fall in slumber, sweet and deep,
In effort vain to keep sound out,
Or ope the window and instead,
To loudly shout:
"KEY DOWN, FROSH!"
