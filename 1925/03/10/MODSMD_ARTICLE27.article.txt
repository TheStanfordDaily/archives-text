Harry Carroll's "Pickings," Wilkes
Theatre.—There is a leaflet in the
program for "Pickings" which adver
tises that the show is constructed in
episodes to allow the maximum of
flexibility and modernity. It is sug
gested that the revision can not take
place too soon, now that the new 1923
joke books are out.
A large amount of the comedy de
ponds upon the audience's ignorance
of quips current in convivial circles.

The joke about the man who was
treated nicely by his wife when he
came home drunk is the basis of an
entire scene. Fannie Brice's suicide
gag is the whole thing in another
scene. A quite perverted old wheeze
is the spirit of a movie lampoon.
Not that this situation has not its
advantages. There are some excellent
features in the show, and after all the
so-called humor is dragged out, the
good bits seem even better by con
trast. »
"It Happened in 1600" is perhaps
the act of the show. Suzette dances
her best in this scene, and those who
have seen Suzette dance at the Ren
dezvous in Los Angeles know that her
best is exceptionally good. She seems
to inspire her associates. The very
ones who are half-hearted in other acts
turn out some nice work.
A rhymed comment on the Duncan
Sisters' bout with the Cicero police
was rather good. A pantomined orien
tal tragedy was well prepared. But, by
and large, Pickings needs the indul
gent atmosphere of the home town
where local products are boosted if
only for the sake of boosting home
products.
Whitmer's orchestra, which played
between acts as a special Stanford
feature last night, helped out the eve
ning enormously.
With Willard Hall, Vivian Hart, Su
zette, and Harry Carroll to continue
to write music, there is hope that '.he
patient will recover. —H. B. R.
