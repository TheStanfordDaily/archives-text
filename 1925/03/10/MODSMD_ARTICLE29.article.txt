There Is something elating about a
piece of work well done. Some of us
should be well on our way to the Bkies.
"It's strange," said a horseman,
"how much smaller a horse seems
after you've ridden him for awhile!"
That might be applied to many things.
Examinations begin a week from
today. And gently we murmur:
Wliy fret and fume? "What boots it
to repeat
How time is slipping underneath our
feet:
Unborn Tomorrow and dead Yester
day,
Why fret about them if Today be
sweet?" •
"Myself, you see, did eagerly frequent
Doctor and Saint, and heard great
Argument
About it and About: but evermore
Came out by the same door as in
I went."
"The little things hurt," yes; but
it is usually "the little things" that
need to be rubbed off.
There is an understanding to be had
that can comprehend even the most
observing of us. Therefore, why be too
sure of anything?
Background makes the man. And
memories are background. 'Twere well
to look to one's memories. /
There is nothing so appalling in
anyone as the expression of the ob
vious, unless it is the absence of a
sense of humor.
Prodding people to see their reac
tion! Cruel? Well —perhaps.
"Was it for this I uttered prayers,
And sobbed and cursed and kicked the
stairs—
That now, domestic as a plate,"
I should read history—thus—so late!
