"Dulcy" Pleases
The sophomore class was responsi
ble for the next production, "Dulry,"
presented the day after the sophomore
cotillion. A farce-comedy of big busi
ness and married life, "Dulcy" was one
of the most enjoyable plays of the
year. It introduced to the campus as
an actress, Peggy Randall, considered
now by many as the cleverest comedi
enne on the Stanford stage. John
Wiggin, Les Herth, Kathreen Clock
and Leonard Schwartz were the out
standing performers of the evening.
"Dulcy," coming aa it did immedi
ately after the melodramatic "R. U.
R.," was a real test of Gordon Davis'
versatility in directing. From a melo
drama to a sparkling comedy is a long
jump, but both productions were un
qualified successes.
Faculty Members Appear
Reviving a custom which had lapsed
for a few years, the Stanford faculty
presented "The Torchbearers," a
comedy about amateur thespians, on
January 9. A cast of former campus
stars provided an evening of mirth
which continued the success of the
previous quarter. Margery Bailey, Pro
fessors Bassett, Foster and Martin,
and Paul Clyde were the individual

hits, with Emily Howard, Mrs. E. D.
Adams and Mrs. Huston very effec
tive in their roles. The opening scene,
executed by Les Kiler, was particular
ly good, and created many favorable
! comments. The proceeds, amounting
to over $1000, were given to the Rus
sian Relief.
"You and I" Next
Philip Barry's comic-drama success,
"You and I," was the next attraction.
'This play was produced with one of
the best casts which Gordon Davis
has yet assembled for a single pro
duction. It included Alan Robertson,
Virginia Graves, Marjorie Allen, Peggy
Randall, Schwartz, and
Charles Parks, all of whom had pre
viously taken leading or star roles in
campus productions. Casting was
again primarily responsible for the
success of the play, and sets by Les
Kiler were remarkably beautiful.
Ram's Head Innovates
Although the annual Ram's Head
show was not directed by Gordon
Davis, it continued the record of good
productions which he had established.
Dave Mannoccir was in charge of the
play, which was written by "Mike"
Ely, '24, and Dan Evans, '20. It was
an innovation for Ram's Head Society,
in that it departed from the former
policy of burlesque, and attempted a
satire on Russian drama. The show
was successful, in spite of the fact
that it was not what the campus had
expected from Ram's Head.

"Macbeth," presented last Friday
night, was the concluding offering for
this year under the direction of Gor
don Davis. Next quarter, the Junior
Opera will be the only production dur
ing the regular college term. Davis
will return i ntime to direct the Senior
Farce, which will be presented after
final examinations next quarter.
"Macbeth" was the most ambitious
undertaking which Davis has yet at
tempted, and its success was the more
remarkable in view of the apathy with
which most of the campus thought
about the production. Excellent cast
ing, colorful sets, splendid interpreta
tion of lines, all assisted towards mak
ing this first venture in the realm of
Shakespearian tragedy an outstanding
presentation. No better comment on
"Macbeth" as produced last Friday has
been noted than that of George C.
Warren, dramatic editor of the San

Francisco Chronicle, who stated that
in his remembrance, very few pro
fessional attempts of the bard's great
est tragedy could claim precedence
over Stanford's performance.
The dramatic season just concluded
was the most successful that Stanford
has ever had, and no small part of
this success has been due to the ef
forts of Delmer Daves, dramatic man
ager. Taking leading roles in two pro
ductions, managing every play, lette.
ing posters, programs, etc., Daves' ef
forts have borne fruit in the pheno
menal rise to popularity which Stan
ford dramatics enjoys.
The combination of Gordon Davis
and Delmer Daves has seemingly es
tablished a tradition of excellent dra
matics which is attracting large!
audiences to the Assembly hall lot
each' new production.
