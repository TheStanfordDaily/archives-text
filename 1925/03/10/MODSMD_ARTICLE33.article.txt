## 
### 
U. OF C., March 10. —Six veteran
Circle "C" acrobats will compete in a
gym club meet with Stanford on Fri
day evening, March 13, in Harmon
gymnasium in collaboration with a
fencing tournament between the
Bruins and Cardinals.
The wealth of excellent material
that turned out this season under the
guidance of Coach Pease, indicates
that the Bruin acrobats should repeat
their performancec of last season
against the Palo Altans. The last meet
ing between the two rival institutions
resulted in a victory for the Berkeley
boys by a margin of over thirty points.
Willard Aujer, captain of the club,
will enter in the long-horse mat and
•ring events for the Bears. He is a
three-year veteran and is favored to
win first place. Probably the best bet
for a victory in the all-round competi
tion lays in Nemo Debley, last season's
intercollegiate champion. Debley is an
other three-year veteran gymnast and
will make a strong bid to bring the
all-round intercollegiate championship
to California for the second time.
Buergin, a new man on the squad, will
also compete in the all-round events.
I). Miller and Antonio Samniago are

the best side-horse athletes while Mc-
Gowan and Van Dixon will be entered
in the ring and long-horse events re
spectively.
The remainder of the athletes will
be chosen after the interclass matches,
which will b? held Monday at Harmon
