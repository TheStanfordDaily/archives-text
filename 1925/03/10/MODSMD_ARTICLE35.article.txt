# STANFORD GRADUATE WRITES OF TRAVELS
## 
### 
A leader in India is Dhan Gopal
Mujerki, '14. He is a poet, and has
recently written travel impressions
for the Atlantic Monthly and Century
magazines.
Mujerki is a Hindu of the aristo
cratic Brahman parentage. He was
born in Calcutta in 1890. Educated for
the priesthood, at fourteen he com
pleted his training and entered on two
years of beggary. The pilgrimage over,
he returned to the temple for a short
time. He went to the University of
Calcutta and there he received a
traveling scholarship to the Univer
sity of Tokio, where he studied engi
neering.
Breaking all ties with the past, Mu
jerki sailed for San Francisco. He
came to Stanford and began to work
his way through school.
"He was a brilliant man," says Dr.
David Starr Jordan, then president of
Stanford. "He used to come to my

â–  house often and read something he
had written. He once wrote a book
of poemB which I prefaced. He was
quite well known among the students.
We had quite a few from India at that
itime, but Mujerki was the best ljked."
Holds I. W. W. Tenets
During summer vacations Mujerki
fell in with some I. W. W.'s and seems
'to have retained some of their doc-
I trines. During the last few years he
has been lecturing in the United
; States, England, and Norway. He has
also been at Stanford several times
i since he graduated.
j Just recently he returned to India
where he has a brother who is a radi
| cal revolutionary and follower of
Gliandi, Mujerki himself is a more
| practical man. "He is not opposed to
I the revolutionaries," says Dr. Jordan,
I "but he isn't one. He is a moderate."
