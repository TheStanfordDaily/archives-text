# EUPHRONIA SOCIETY TEAM MEETS MILLS DEBATERS TONIGHT
## 
### 
I The Euphronia debating team will
meet representatives from Mills Col
lege tonight at 8:40 in the Little
Theatre on the subject, "Resolved,
That the President of the United
States should be nominated by the
direct vote of the people." The de
bate will begin promptly after the
regular Tuesday evening lecture.
The Stanford team, which will up
hold the affirmative, consists of Bert
Levit and Harold Peterson. Levit, the
president of Euphronia debating so
ciety last year, has been a member of
several varsity teams, having debated
a year ago last fall against the Uni
versity of Washington on criminal
syndicalism, and as alternate on the
Joffre debate squad two years ago.
Levit, Peterson Compose Teams
Last summer Levit was a member
of the flying squadron that campaigned
for Coolidge throughout California. He
is at present the freshman debating
coach. He has an unusual plan for
presentation tonight that is expected
to take the Mills team by surprise.
Peterson, the other member of the
team, was a member of last year's
freshman debating squad. Last year
he argued against the College of the
Pacific on the Recognition of Russia.
He is at present secretary *of Eu
phronia.
The Mills College team consists of
Harriet Haskell and Marjorie Graham.
They will arrive this evening at eight
o'clock, accompanied by Elise Gold
schmidt, the senior debate manager,
and will be entertained at Roble by
Wranglers. A Mills debate team won
overwhelmingly from the Oxford de
baters last month.
Questions Allowed
As in the Euphronia league debates
held last quarter, members of the
audience will be able to interrupt each
speaker twice during his constructive
speech. This is being done to make
the debates informal and of interest
to the audience.
Professor Edgar Eugene Robinson
will act as chairman. The decision will
be by a majority audience vote, by
the vote of an expert judge, O. E. Nor
ton, of the English department; and
by the vote of a balance judge, Pro
fessor Harold Shepherd of the Law
department.
