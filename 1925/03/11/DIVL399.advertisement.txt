Cheviots
College men always like cheviots. They lend
themselves to the free-and-easy campus style.
Here are cheviots such as you have never seen.
Rare shades of gray and tan, relieved with stripes
of orange, blue, black, purple. But we could tell
you about them all day without giving you any
real idea of how they are. One look tells the
story. They're exclusive, of course. We're
pricing them at fifty dollars. How about a look?
