Kasha, Prints and
' Chiffons—
of such is the youthful mode
Kasha or one of her sisters is the leading woolen —brightly colorful or
in smart natural shades. Frocks for street, sports or campus and
ensembles of the dressier type all use this best liked of spring fabrics.
Printed silks —exotically lovely in color and richness of design—take
first place in frocks for afternoon wear or the gayer sports types.
Without much trimming most of them are slimly straight to the knee
\ —then flaring.
Chiffon for dancing frocks is a Spring mode of importance. In
brilliant hues, pastel shades, or the fascination of ombre shadings,
they are great favorites of graceful simplicity.
