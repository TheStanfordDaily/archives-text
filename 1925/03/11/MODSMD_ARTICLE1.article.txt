# OLYMPIC CLUB WILL BE FIRST OPPONENT OF CARD TRADERS
## 'Winged O" Team Composed Of Former California, Stanford Stars 
### 
Coach R. L. Templeton's track var
uty will undergo its first test Saturday
igainst the Olympic Club tracksters.
The meet will be held at 2:30 p.m. on
he old oval.
Stanford's meeting with the "Winged
0" aggregation will be the first of
tour hard battles for the Card track
md field men. Contests with U. S. C.,
Oregon, Nebraska, and California fol
low in successive weeks.
Charles Hunter, Olympic track
:oach, has gathered together one of
lie best track teams that the club has
?ver seen. A majority of the men once
performed under California colors and
i number are former Stanford men.
Eight in Olympic Games
Of the two teams that meet, eight
members entered the Olympic games,
either of 1920 or 192-1, and their per
formances alone should be worth
watchipg.
Aside from the interest that is
shown in individuals however, a num
ber of final battles will command at
tention.
Miller Versus Cochran
Chief among these should be the
race for 440 honors between Miller of
Stanford and Cochran of the Olympic
Club. Cochran at present has the upper
hand on past honors for he has beaten
the Card quarter-miler twice and runs j
under 0:50 at any time. He also is j
considered a serious contender, how- j
t'ver. His time of 0:49 2-5 in the Irish j
Marathon was good for early season |
and his 0:22 2-5 for the 220' last week ,
shows that he still retains his famous
sprint.
Another battle will be between for- j
mer teammates —Mcintosh and Rich- j
ardson —in the 880. Both raced a dead i
% . i
heat nearly to the finish of the Call-1
fornia meet last year, Richardson win
ning by six inches. They also finished
close together in the I. C. 4A meet last
June, with Richardson third and Mc-
Itnosh fourth.
Hale Ineligible
Hale, Card captain, was to give Gas
par a run for his money in the sprints
until he was declared ineligible to run
on the campus for an invading team;
that is, if he wishes to compete in the
future under Stanford colors. O'Brien,
who ran well in the Y. M. I. meet in
San Francisco last week, will take
Hale's place.
With Campbell unable to get in
shape because of weak arches, Gaspar
continues to bear the burden of the
sprints for Stanford. Hyland has re
covered from an operation but is not
-trcng enough for workouts. Miller,
Leistner, and Hartranft placed in the
interclass meet but will be busy with
their own events. This leaves Adams
and Babcock as the only capable
sprinters and the latter will probably
run the quarter.
A third interesting track duel should
be the Kerr-Loehkart eontest in the
mile. Boren, of the 1024 California
varsity, and now of the Olympic Club,
has jumped around 24 feet in the
broad jump.
'jaMojin ujiaAßf uutj 'njjAjv umjof
running up against no formidable
competition, will prove a great draw
ing card. Captain Hartranft will meet
two capable rivals Saturday in Mer
chant and Haner.
Stanford will be far from weak in
the high jump with Work and Kem
nitzer doing over six feet. Noris, Chris
tie's pole-vaulting star of two years
ago, may also compete for the Olym
pic Club.

Leistner, and Hartranft placed in the
interclass meet but will be busy with
their own events. This leaves Adams
and Babcock as the only capable
sprinters and the latter will probably
run the quarter.
A third interesting track duel should
be the Kerr-Loehkart eontest in the
mile. Boren, of the 1024 California
varsity, and now of the Olympic Club,
has jumped around 24 feet in the
broad jump.
'jaMojin ujiaAßf uutj 'njjAjv umjof
running up against no formidable
competition, will prove a great draw
ing card. Captain Hartranft will meet
two capable rivals Saturday in Mer
chant and Haner.
Stanford will be far from weak in
the high jump with Work and Kem
nitzer doing over six feet. Noris, Chris
tie's pole-vaulting star of two years
ago, may also compete for the Olym
pic Club.
Coach R. L. Templeton's track var
uty will undergo its first test Saturday
igainst the Olympic Club tracksters.
The meet will be held at 2:30 p.m. on
he old oval.
Stanford's meeting with the "Winged
0" aggregation will be the first of
tour hard battles for the Card track
md field men. Contests with U. S. C.,
Oregon, Nebraska, and California fol
low in successive weeks.
Charles Hunter, Olympic track
:oach, has gathered together one of
lie best track teams that the club has
?ver seen. A majority of the men once
performed under California colors and
i number are former Stanford men.
Eight in Olympic Games
Of the two teams that meet, eight
members entered the Olympic games,
either of 1920 or 192-1, and their per
formances alone should be worth
watchipg.
Aside from the interest that is
shown in individuals however, a num
ber of final battles will command at
tention.
Miller Versus Cochran
Chief among these should be the
race for 440 honors between Miller of
Stanford and Cochran of the Olympic
Club. Cochran at present has the upper
hand on past honors for he has beaten
the Card quarter-miler twice and runs j
under 0:50 at any time. He also is j
considered a serious contender, how- j
t'ver. His time of 0:49 2-5 in the Irish j
Marathon was good for early season |
and his 0:22 2-5 for the 220' last week ,
shows that he still retains his famous
sprint.
Another battle will be between for- j
mer teammates —Mcintosh and Rich- j
ardson —in the 880. Both raced a dead i
% . i
heat nearly to the finish of the Call-1
fornia meet last year, Richardson win
ning by six inches. They also finished
close together in the I. C. 4A meet last
June, with Richardson third and Mc-
Itnosh fourth.
Hale Ineligible
Hale, Card captain, was to give Gas
par a run for his money in the sprints
until he was declared ineligible to run
on the campus for an invading team;
that is, if he wishes to compete in the
future under Stanford colors. O'Brien,
who ran well in the Y. M. I. meet in
San Francisco last week, will take
Hale's place.
With Campbell unable to get in
shape because of weak arches, Gaspar
continues to bear the burden of the
sprints for Stanford. Hyland has re
covered from an operation but is not
-trcng enough for workouts. Miller,
Leistner, and Hartranft placed in the
interclass meet but will be busy with
their own events. This leaves Adams
and Babcock as the only capable
sprinters and the latter will probably
run the quarter.
