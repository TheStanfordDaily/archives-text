# EUPHRONIA DEBATERS DEFEAT MILLS TEAM
## Audience, Two Judges Give Unanimous Decision to Stanford Speakers 
### 
j The Stanford Euphronia debating
team defeated Mills College by the
unanimous decision of three votes last
night in the Little Theatre on the sub
ject, "Resolved, That the president of
the United States should be nominated
by the direct vote of the people."
The decision was determined by an
i audience vote, which gave the deci
sion to the affirmative, which the local
Euphronia was upholding, by a 36-27
vote; and by the votes of an expert
i judge, O. E. Norton of the English
J department, and of a balance judge,
Professor Harold Shepherd of the law
| school, both of whom made the deci
| sion unanimous forth 6 affirmative.
â€¢Bert Levit and Harold Petersdh, in
\ upholding the affirmative for Euphro-
I nia, compared the direct primary and
the convention systems, showing that
j the convention was a political acci
dent, and presented a plan for the
direct nomination of the president
which the negative failed to refute.
The Mills negative team, consisting
of Marjorie Graham and Harriet Has
kell, admitted the evils of the conven
tion system and based their argument
j on the advantages of another plan the
I presidential preference primary, which
! the affirmative pointed out to be mere
, ly a combination of the old convention
j system and the direct primary system.
I The affirmative plan upheld going the
J whole way and of adopting the direct
primary system alone.
This was the first of the two league
| debates in which Euphronia will par
ticipate this quarter. On March 26.
during the spring vacation, the society
will meet the San Jose State Teachers
College there on the same question.
