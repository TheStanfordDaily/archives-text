# CARD BOXERS WILL MEET BRANCH TEAM DURING VACATION
## 
### 
Stanford's boxing match with the
University of California, Southern
Branch, originally scheduled to take
place in the pavilion Saturday night
has been cancelled. On March 21, the
Saturday following finals, the Cardinal
fighters will box Southern Branch in
Los Angeles, according to an anounce
ment made today.
The same team, with the exception
of the lightweight representatives, that
met Davis Farm last Saturday, will
probably box in the south. Harry Ma
loney has not yet decided the boxer
in the 135-pound class who will make
the trip.
In the lightweight division, Feeley,
Raff, and Parsons are competing for
the place. Parsons fought against the
California Aggies in the first match of
the season, but his place was taken by
Feeley last week. Raff has not had
varsity experience, but has given the
other two men close competition for
a place on the team.
Simmons will box in place of Ar
thur in the heavyweight division. As
yet, he has not had any varsity com
petition, as the Aggies defaulted this
bout to Stanford in the last match.
The same men who fought against
the Davis squad last Saturday will
make the trip. All of these performed
well and are a't present in excellent
condition.
Captain Martin, Schall, and Fannin
are all probably sure winners against
the Branch team. Farmin gave a good
exhibition in defeating Grubbs of the
Aggies Saturday, after he had lost the
first bout at Davis by a close margin.
