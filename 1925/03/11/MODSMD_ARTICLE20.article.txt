# SI. LOUIS CARDINALS WIN FROM STANFORD IN CLOSE CONTEST
## Redshirt Nine Will Battle Ambrose Tailors Here Next Saturday 
### 
Though defeated 5 to 0 yesterday
afternoon by the St. Louis Cardinals
in training at Stockton, the Stanford
varsity baseball team looks forward
to its clash with the Ambrose Tailors
nine here next Saturday.
Teague, varsity hurler, played a
good game yesterday, allowing the St.
Louis Cardinals a single hit in the
first and another in the eighth frame.
Four of the Big Leaguers' runs were
made in the fourth inning after they
had taken five hits off the varsity.
Hafey singled in the fifth for the
last marker in that inning. Teague
braced and until Nevers went in for
him in the ninth played flawless baU.
The fifth run against the varsity was
made in the final frame.
The team returned from its jaunt
last night and will train here until its
next appearance when on the varsity
diamond here the Stanford men meet
the Ambrose Tailors Saturday at 2:30.
