# STORY OF RUSSIAN ART TOLD BY LANZ IN LECTURE
## 
### 
"Pictorial art is a mute story told
in colors," said Professor Henry Lanz
in his illustrated lecture on Russian
art last night in the Little Theatre.
Lanz told the story of pictorial art
in Russia from the beginning, the in
troduction of the Ikons with the ad
vent of Christianity.
He spoke briefly about the early
landscape artists, who "suffered from
an unduly magnified sense of decorum,
and the school of gengre which fos
ters painted anecdotes. The anecdotes
at times assume the proportions of
short stories with a sentimental or
moralizing tone."
Slides were shown of the pictures of
Antopav, Borovikouski, Brullov, Rapin,
and others, but Lanz spoke especially
about four representative modern
paintings.
Bakst, according to the lecturer, is
largely responsible for the present and
future styles in women's dress. Roe
rich is a painted of archaic legendary,
landscapes with rocks and clouds usu
ally taking the symbollic forms of
human terror. Soinov's human figures,
he said, are "marionettes frozen in
moonlight" but whose "inanimate na
ture is vital with the sap of life."
Lanz discussed Churlianis, the paint
er of music. "His pictures are melodies
of repeated themes, weird, and with no
plot.
"Modern art enjoys a bad reputa
tion. The general public believes that
to paint a picture, or compose a poem,
one has only to possess genius," de
clared Lanz. "Genius does not amount
to anything without hard work and
intensive training."
