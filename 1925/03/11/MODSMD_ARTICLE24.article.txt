What with illness, injuries and scholastic catastrophe, prospects for the
coming track season have dimmed considerably since the beginning of the
college year. Even the most ingenious dopesters have been forced to
credit California with the chance*of winning a couple of points. But, at j
the same time, the most pessimistic estimators cannot help but confess that ;
the Big Meet is not in the Blue and Gold ice-box. And what is behind
Cardinal confidence is the known ability of Coach R. L. Templeton.
When "Dink" started in, things did not look rosy. The expected crash j
was heralded with sobs. But the flop did not come-off according to 1
schedule. And each year since Templeton has worked on the Stanford
oval, his teams have done better than has been expectcd, until now it is!
a habit for rooters to consider their wildest fancies in the light of prob- j
ability.
As things look now, Stanford is likely to win the Big Meet. But it
cannot be done without a lot of hard training. Preliminary workouts have j
attracted only fair sized crowds. It is considerably more important to at- !
tend the early season meets than it is to be present at the final event, j
People fight to get in to the stadium when Stanford and California con- ;
test any point. The teams always work their best and get their biggest
backing at this time, whether it is urged or not.
How good their best is depends largely on early season work. What
ever support the track men have helps them to put more determination j
and enthusiasm, if that is possible, into preparatory training. It is at this,
time that encouragement is best given.
Templeton-'s team will set about puttnig awe into the purified souls of
the Trojans during this vacation. U. S. C. rooters will probably attend.
Since over half of the students of Stanford come from Los Angeles, there
should be plenty of available lung-power, if only it can be brought around
to the track.
For more reasons than one, this Trojan-Cardinal meet should be a
good one. And for three or four more reasons, Stanford needs a record
rooting section at this contest. The team deserves every advantage we
can give it. One hundred per cent is not enough. Bring a friend.
