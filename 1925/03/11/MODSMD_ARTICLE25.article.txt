Increasing interest in dramatics and other forms of entertainment since
1898, the year that the present Assembly Hall was erected, has placed the
University in an embarrassing position. The only place available for in
door gatherings of any magnitude, it is as antiquated and uncomfortable as
an old-fashioned country church.
The Assembly Hall is where many visitors get an impression of Stan
ford as a whole; it is the place where plays are given, which attract many
off-campus people; it is the meeting place for such events as the annual
High School Journalists' convention; and the picture it presents to every
gathering is a sorry one.
Students and visitors alike are seen squirming in seats which seem
bent on slanting one's knees into the back of the seat in front, trying at
the same time to catch a sound or two of the proceedings—sounds which
due to the acoustics, are either an unintelligible roar or an indistinguish
able whisper.
New dormitories are being constructed, various improvements are go
ing on apace, and yet nothing has been urged towards building an assembly
hall which will be not only a credit but a comfort to the students, faculty,
alumni and visitors alike. It is a need which should not be overlooked any
longer.
The University is not in a position to construct a new hall at the present
time, nor will it be in the near future. Here then, is an opportunity for
some diligent scouting 011 the part of the students to promote one. That's
how we get everything else. • —C. C. S.
