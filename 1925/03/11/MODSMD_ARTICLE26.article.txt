Greenwich Village Follies —A clover
girl and music review at the Curran
featuring Gallagher and Shean (in per
son, declares the program) in some
new and old stuff was well received.
Two very tolerable comedians, Ilan
ders and Milliss, get off some good
ones before the curtain, and Harriet
Cole does some most excellent inter;
pretive dancing in the role of a nisht
ingnle—she is good enough for any
show anywhere. Messrs. Shean and
Gallagher add a few dozen new lyricß
to their international ditty, and per
form in some entertaining acts here
and there with the rest of the prin
cipals. The production may well boast

, of very effective sets and varied and
' multi-colored costumes which are far
better than that the usual review has
to offer. A good show, on the whole —
no epilogues, no prologues —just two
acts that are easy to sit through.
