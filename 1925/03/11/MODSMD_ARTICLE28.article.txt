THE ROOMMATES
(With apologies to Kipling)
I've taken the rooms that they gave me,
And also the roommates as well.
(Like all freshmen that room at En
clna)
And four of the lot were —i—!
Algernon Fitzhugh, the first one —
Algy had just come from France,
Talked of the new Deauville tango
Whenever he went to a dance.
Playing Mali Jongg was his trouble
(His number of grade points was slim)
When the bawlout appeared it turned
out as I "feared."
But I learned about roommates from I
him.
Reginald Brown was my next one.
He was a studious lad,
Went to bed every night at eight-thirty |
Tho that didn't make me so sad.
But he got up at five every morning
And studied a Phi Bate to win;
And we got in a tight 'cause he turned
on the light.
But I learned about roommates from
him.
Q. Jones was a he man all over.
(So strong every place but the head).
He practiced to beat up Jack Dempsey
And could do it (at least so he said).
He was taking the course in jiu jitsu
And getting in good fighting trim.
But he practiced on me and we
couldn't agree;
But I learned about roommates from
him.
I
Percival Morgan—the latest.
He was a regular Sheik —
Drove over to Roble each week-end,
And also each pight of the week.
One evening some sophomores ob
* served him, « i
Altho I had warned him with vim.
Now, sad to relate, I have lost my j
roommate,
But I learned about roommates from !
him.
Now that is the reason I write this.
I'm as perfect as any may be,
For I sleep all the time —and to end
up this rhyme—
Will you please be a roommate with l
me? —J. B. P., '2b.!
