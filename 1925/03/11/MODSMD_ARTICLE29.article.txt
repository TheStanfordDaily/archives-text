# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Last Wednesday "XYZ" demanded
| that the Frosh rise up and discard
; their dinks. To my mind this is the
most destructive and revolutionary !
i viewpoint that has appeared in the J
"Dippy" for a long time. It is asking
: the Frosh, who have not been here
long enough to know what it is all
' about, to abolish a tradition sacred to
Stanford. The man who suggested this
is either an extreme radical or one
who hasn't yet realized just what Stan- 1
: ford is or means.
| Stanford is more than the school, it
is more than a collection of buildings
or a Quad. Stanford is a spirit; an in
stitution demanding the same type of
homage our country demands and it j
should be regarded with the same
! spirit of patriotism —the spirit that t
prompts men to go out and fight, and
when they are beaten to get up and j
fight again.
The number wearing dinks was
grossly underestimated, as I am sure
that after being here nearly two quar
ters now there are many more than
fifty men who have breathed enough
of the spirit of Stanford to be proud
of Stanford and their class.
These freshmen that come to Stan
ford and take all and give nothing are
undesirable. Every man at Stanford
must do something to uphold the
honor of the University. We can't all
be athletes, but we can all serve our
alma mater some way. If fellows don't
want to wear dinks they should go
over to Berkeley and become one of
the ten thousand. Here at Stanford we
all want to wear dinks —want to show
that we are proud of our privilege in
being allowed to come here.
