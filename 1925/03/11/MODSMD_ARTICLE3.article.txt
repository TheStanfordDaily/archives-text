"Back to childhood" is what the
Rally Committee has planned for this
year's Masque Ball to be held April 24.
The committee feels that in the past
those who have attended masque balls
have spent an evening under more or
less nervous tension. Consequently
in order to provide ample opportunity
for recreation and relaxation for all,
the basketball pavilion will be trans
formed into a playground. Swings, see
saws, and other apparatus for the
amusement of the playfully inclined
will be provided.
Original skits, dances, and songs
are needed to make the affair a suc
cess. Ideas should be conveyed to L.
H. Peter at once.
