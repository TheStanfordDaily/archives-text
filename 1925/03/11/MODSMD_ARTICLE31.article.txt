# E WORLD'S GREATEST INFIELD
## 
### FEG MURRAY '16 
awn <it Sarasota, Florida, the I
Id's greatest infield is in training j
the coming baseball season. A
it infield must be more than just
■ hall players who are brainy and
:hanically perfect in their execu
i of plays. A great infield must have
srve strength, and that is what
draw has got, and that is why the
nts of 1925 look to win their fifth
light National League pennant.
Celly, Frisch, Jackson, and Groh —
but Jackson are veterans of three
1 seasons together—form a defen

sive and offensive combination hard to
beat. If Heinie Groh's trick knee goes
back on him, young Freddie Lindstrora
is waiting to step into the breach, and
Freddy can occupy the "hot corner"
well, too —even bettlr than Groh can,
many fans think. His playing in the
last world's series was astounding for
an 18-year-old boy. He safely handled
25 chances and got ten hits, seven of
them in nine times at bat.
Travis Jackson, who is only 21, fits
well into the combination of Kelly,
Friscli, and Groh —or Lindstrom. Last

year was his first as a regular, and he
batted .303 in 151 games. McGraw con
siders Jackson the most promising
shortstop in baseball.
And in Bill Terry, Jawn McGraw has
another youngster who is very handy
to have around. Playing first base
against some of the Senators' right
handers in the world's series, he got
six hits in fourteen times at bat. It
may be that the Giant manager will
use him regularly at first with Kelly
in center field.
Incidentally, Kelly, Frisch, Jackson,

land Lindstrom were all developed by
the Giants' manager. McGraw calls
! Kelly the best first baseman he ever
say, and Frisch the most valuable all
round player. John seems well satis
fied with his infield —and who wouldn't
be?
