## THE 						COUNTESS 
### Carl Van Vechten 
(Courtesy of Paul Elder)
If you would enjoy placing a highly
sophisticated Italian countess in a pro
vincial little middle western town in
the United States, and then standing
j by, amuse yourself with unphilosophi
j cal observations on the events which
; follow —then you would enjoy Carl Van
; Vechten's "The Tattooed Countess."
| In his book Van Vechten has chosen
for his principal character an attrac
: tive girl, Ella Poore, who marries an
Italian of some social standing and be
comes the Countess Nattatorrini. After
the death of her husband the Countess
devotes herself to a succession of art
ists and actors. Finally tiring of this,
she leaves Italy and returns to her
native home in Maple Valley, Icwa.
A bond of mutual companionship is
rapidly formed between the Countess
and Gareth Johns, whose father owns
| and operates the most up-to-date hard
-1 ware store in Maple Valley, and who
aspires to get a glimpse of the world
lying beyond the boundaries of the
| progressive little town of his birth,
r To Gareth the Countess is a stimu
lating companion, some one who has
seen the world and who can tell him
about it. To the Countess, Gareth pre
sents a pleasant change from the bore
dom of provincial topics. Domestic dif
! Acuities arise in the Johns family and,
1 urged by subtle suggestions from the
Countess, Gareth and she escape to
: gether from the town.
"The Tattooed Countess" is, as a
sub-title suggests, "a romantic novel
with a happy ending." Van Vechten
; writes in a clear and almost elemental
! style which Somerset Maughan praises
as a model for aspiring young writers
i to cultivate.
The author manages somehow to
mention the names of all the old
favorites of the stage from Lillian
Russell and Adele Ritchie to Delia
Fox and Frank Mayo. He brings into
, the story long lists of popular authors
i and novels of the same period also.
All of which brings one back to
the beginning: If you would enjoy
: seeing a tattooed countess play havoc
! in Maple A'alley, lowa —then read the
book. —K. D.

"The Tattooed Countess" is, as a
sub-title suggests, "a romantic novel
with a happy ending." Van Vechten
; writes in a clear and almost elemental
! style which Somerset Maughan praises
as a model for aspiring young writers
i to cultivate.
The author manages somehow to
mention the names of all the old
favorites of the stage from Lillian
Russell and Adele Ritchie to Delia
Fox and Frank Mayo. He brings into
, the story long lists of popular authors
i and novels of the same period also.
All of which brings one back to
the beginning: If you would enjoy
: seeing a tattooed countess play havoc
! in Maple A'alley, lowa —then read the
book. —K. D.
