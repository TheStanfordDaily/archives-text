# "S" AWARDS MADE BY EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
## 
### 
Block "S" awards were granted to
nine Cardinal basketball players at
the meeting of the Executive Commit
tee last night. The interpretation
placed by the committee on the eligi
bility of E. H. Young in running for
cheer-leader in the May election was
that he would have to be registered
in the University to be eligible.
Young stated today that he will take
his proposed trip around the world and
thus will not be a candidate for the
office.
Due to an oversight in the Graduate
Manager's office the recommendation
for next year's basketball manager
failed to reach the Executive commit
tee meeting last night. The next meet
ing of the committee will be held
spring quarter and at that time the
appointment will be made.
Six freshmen were awarded block
"28" sweaters for basketball competi

sophomore swimmers for tieing for
first place in the interclass meet. Sev
