# DAILY TRYOUT PERIOD WILL OPEN MARCH 31
## 
### 
Spring tryouts for the Daily Palo
Alto will open under a new system on
March 31 and will close May 28, when
several positions on the news staff will
be filled. Opportunities will be given
for the tryoutees to learn about jour
nalism, and lack of previous experi
ence wilP not count in the final selec
tions.
Previously a one-week spurt has
given a wide edge to students who
have had previous experience on
school papers and has prevented
others who have potential ability from
being able to give evidence of their
worth and energy.
In the spring competition, the ability
to learn news writing, energy in find
ing stories, and general persistence
will be used as a basis of judgment
in choosing members for the staff.
All work done for the paper will be
counted by a point system. Work under
the new system will be as evenly di
vided as possible, and an excessive
amount of time will not be demanded
of the tryoutees. If asignments are
done promptly there will be no neces
sity for taking time from studies and
other activities.
Arrangements have been made to ac
commodate as many as wish to try out
next quarter. While there will be no
favor shown in considering members
of whatever class, underclassmen will
have the advantage of a longer time
to work on the Daily, and in the event j
that they are successful in making the 1
staff, toward attaining advanced posi- j
tions.
Every person who may come into i
contact with newspapers, which possi- J
bly includes practically everybody, j
will find it to his advantage to learn
something of journalism. Those inter- j
ested in other activities will profit I
from a knowledge of news writing. In !
the several departments of the paper
opportunity will be given everyone to j
develop his particular bent.
For every student who intends to j
become adept in any special field, to '
be able to write clearly will be advan- j
tageous. If the ability to prepare ma
terial for publication is never used in
college, although men who attain spe
cial distinction in athletics often have I
the opportunity to earn money writing
for metropolitan papers while they are I
still undergraduates, it is bound to be J
useful at some subsequent time.
It is the intention of this tryout sys
tem to develop every candidate's best,
selecting the most able for the staff
and leaving a useful knowledge with
the others.
Those who cannot attend the first
meeting of tryoutees at 1:30 o'clock,
March 31, at the Daily office, may make |
other arrangements beforehand.
