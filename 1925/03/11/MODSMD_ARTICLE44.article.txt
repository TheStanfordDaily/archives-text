## 
### 
"Landscapes of Northern France" is
the subject of a talk by Madame Ninon
to be given at the regular meeting of
Ihe French Club tonight at 7:30 in the
Women's Clubhouse. Madame Ninon
recently returned from a visit to
France, so she is well acquainted with
her subject. The rest of the program
will consist of a group of various
French songs by Maria Anderson.
Immediately following the entertain
ment the club will hold its usual busi
ness meeting. Plans will be discussed
for the presentation of two French
plays to be produced by the French
department, May 17. The plays are:
"Comedie de Celui Qui Epouse Une
Femme Emuette," by Anatole France,
and "Petite Pluie" by Edouard Pail
lerons. The plays will be given for
the benefit of the French war orphans
which the club has adopted.
