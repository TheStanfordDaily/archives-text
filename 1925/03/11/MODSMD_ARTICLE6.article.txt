# Mechanical Engineering Society Elects Officers
## 
### 
E. N. Merrill was elected president
of the Stanford chapter of the Ameri
can Society of Mechanical Engineers
at a meeting held last night. H. W.
Powers was elected vice-president and
G. P. Windsor, secretary-treasurer.
The society decided to re-establish
the old custom of casting the senior
plate (hat is placed on the Inner Quad
hy each graduating class. Starting this
year, the society will make the plate
instead of having it cast off the cam
pus as has been done in recent years.
