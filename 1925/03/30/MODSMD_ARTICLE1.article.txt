# TRYOUIS BEGIN TOMORROW FOR JUNIOR OPERA
## Daves Announces Production Requires Varied Cast, Many Music Scores 
### 
Tryouts for the 1926 Junior Opera will
be held tomorrow afternoon at 3 :30 until
5, and tomorrow night from 7 to 10, in
the Assembly Hall. Everyon? is eligible
except' freshmeq,women.
Webster Street won from a field of
twelve competitors in the contest for au
thorship of the 1926 opera, with a play
which has as its locale both the United
States and Mexico. The cast of charac
ters includes practically every type of
humanity, ranging from a Dutch inn
keeper to an American ace, and from a
Mexican senorita to a Los Angeles de
butante.
Delmer Daves, who will direct the pro
duction, has requested that everyone who
is interested in dramatics try out for the
Junior Opera, since the cast will be large
and several "nds" along dramatic lines are
•expected to be discovered.
The music will be under the direction of
Fred "Chubby" Tyroler, who was in
•charge of Ram's Head music, and song
plots should be turned in to him any even
ing from now on at the Assembly Hall.
A total of fourteen musical numbers are
now scheduled for the two acts of the
play, giving campus song writers ample
opportunity to display their versatility.
Settings will be designed and executed
by Les Kiler, and Chrysella Dunker will
have charge of the dancing and costum
ing. Miss Dunker has recently returned
from an extended trip to New York,
where she saw many of the outstanding
productions. Ideas from Broadway will
therefore be seen in the Junior Opera
when it is presented on May 6.
Tryouts will continue throughout the
week, and the cast will probably be picked
next Monday or Tuesday. Further an
nouncements of time and place of tryouts
will appear both in the Daily Palo Alto
and on the bulletin board outside the
■Green Room.
