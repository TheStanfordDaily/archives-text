# CARDS DEFEAT TROJAN TRACK TEAM, 71 TO 59
## U. S. C. Given Clean Sweep in 220-Yard Dash; Miller Wins Over Martz 
### Douglas Meservey 
The Cardinal tracksters came
through their first severe test of the
1925 season Saturday when they de
feated the University of Southern
California, 71 to 59V&.
Two weeks before, the Olympic
Club, also strongly rated, had gone
down before the Cards, 82 to 49. A
number of Coach Templeton's men did
not put in an appearance in their regu
lar events and gave little chance for
predictions for the U. S. C. battle.
Points began to roll up rapidly for
Stanford from the beginning. Kerr
took the lead in the mile and finished
first in the time of 4:30 1-5, far ahead
of Elwood who was doped to give him
a fight. Smith sprang a surprise by
finishing second.
Hartranft, after a few practice
tosses with the shot, strolled over to
the hundred stretch and a few minutes
later finished close behind Taylor for
a "second.
Clean Sweep for U. S. C.
The other sprint race was the only
clean sweep for the Southerners.
House, Smith, and Taylor finished in
a bunch with Gaspar bringing up
fourth. The time was 0:22 1-5.
Two surprises were sprung in the
440. One was Miller's time of 0:48 3-5
when he finished far ahead of Martz
of U. S. C. who was expected to press
him. The latter was not in usual form,
however, as he had just recovered
from a week's siege of the influenza.
Richardson in 440
The second surprise was the finish
of Richardson who ended the race in
second place at Miller's shoulders.
Richardson not only made record
time in the quarter, but after a brief
rest broke the Stanford-California 880
mark with the fast time of 1:55 2-5.
Captain Hartranft met his- arch
rival, Clarence Houser, for the third
time, with honors even, but the meet
ing failed to settle the dispute as far
as points are concerned.
Hartranft took the shot-put when,
after Houser had led him by inches, he
came back and on his last throw
tossed the ball 49 feet 8 1-2 inches.
Houser took second with 48 feet 6 1-4
inches.
Houser Wins Discus
The U. S. C. "little giant" once more
evened the honors, however, by win
ning the discus. Hartranft failed to
come up to form in this event and
could not do better than 144 feet 2
inches in his six throws. Houser won
the event with 149 feet 8 3-4 inches.
The long-awaited battle between
Leistner and Dye did not settle mat
ters either. Dye won the highs with
Leistner two feet behind but both
were disqualified for knocking down
three hurdles. Otto Anderson of U. S.
C., who finished third, was then given
first place, Wells of Stanford, second,
and Stever of U. S. C., third.
Leistner Defeats Dye
In the lows, Leistner and Dye led
the field with the latter slightly in
the lead up to the last two hurdles.
There the Card hurdler displayed a
stronger finish and although both went
over the last stick together he broke
the tape in the fast time of 0:24 1-5.
Evers, Shipkey, and Ned Anderson
gave Stanford a clean sweep in the
javelin in the order named.
Work Is Tied
Work found an unexpected rival in
the high jump when Ross tied him for
first at G feet 3 1-8 inches.
Charles followed Heilman of U. S. C.
for seven laps of the two-mile but
burst ahead on the back stretch of the
last one with a beautiful sprint and
finished fifty yards to the front. His
time was 9:54 2-5 and could undoubt
edly have been bettered at least five
seconds.
