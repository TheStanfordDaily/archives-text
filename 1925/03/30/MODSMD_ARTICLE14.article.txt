# CARDS DEFEAT TROJAN TRACK TEAM, 71 TO 59
## U. S. C. Given Clean Sweep in 220-Yard Dash; Miller Wins Over Martz 
### Douglas Meservey 
The Cardinal tracksters came
through their first severe test of the
1925 season Saturday when they de
feated the University of Southern
California, 71 to 59V&.
Two weeks before, the Olympic
Club, also strongly rated, had gone
down before the Cards, 82 to 49. A
number of Coach Templeton's men did
not put in an appearance in their regu
lar events and gave little chance for
predictions for the U. S. C. battle.
Points began to roll up rapidly for
Stanford from the beginning. Kerr
took the lead in the mile and finished
first in the time of 4:30 1-5, far ahead
of Elwood who was doped to give him
a fight. Smith sprang a surprise by
finishing second.
Hartranft, after a few practice
tosses with the shot, strolled over to
the hundred stretch and a few minutes
later finished close behind Taylor for
a "second.
Clean Sweep for U. S. C.
The other sprint race was the only
clean sweep for the Southerners.
House, Smith, and Taylor finished in
a bunch with Gaspar bringing up
fourth. The time was 0:22 1-5.
Two surprises were sprung in the
440. One was Miller's time of 0:48 3-5
when he finished far ahead of Martz
of U. S. C. who was expected to press
him. The latter was not in usual form,
however, as he had just recovered
from a week's siege of the influenza.
Richardson in 440
The second surprise was the finish
of Richardson who ended the race in
second place at Miller's shoulders.
Richardson not only made record
time in the quarter, but after a brief
rest broke the Stanford-California 880
mark with the fast time of 1:55 2-5.
Captain Hartranft met his- arch
rival, Clarence Houser, for the third
