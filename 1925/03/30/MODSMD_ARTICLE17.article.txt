# Post Season Possibilities

Coach Templeton's charges have trod rough shod over the Olympic
club and the U. S. C. track teams, and in doing so have shown sufficient
potential strength to make track followers ta"ke out their pencils and begin
figuring how Stanford can win the conference, I. C. A. A. A. A., Drake
relays, or what not.
Three affairs are possibilities—the Pacific Coast coherence meet, the
I. C. A. A. A. A., both of which come on the same day, and the Drake
relays, which comes a week after the California meet.
There are advantages to each meet, with almost as many disadvantages.
In considering this problem the Board of Athletic Control has voted to
attend the coast conference meet, which would eliminate the eastern meet
unless the board has a change of mind. The Drake relay invitation is still
undecided, although it is probable the team will participate in them if it
does not go east to the other meet.
Students and the majority of outsiders, without weighing important
factors, are frankly of the opinion that the I. C. A. A. A. A..is the only
thing worth attending, because of the national prestige it would give Stan
ford, should Templeton's men be able to win.
But, in deciding whether or not to send a team east, several things
must be considered—finances, scholarship, attitude of the other members
of the Pacific Coast Conference, possibility of winning, and effect upon
the athletes themselves.
From a financial standpoint, the coast conference and Drake relay
combination appears to be best. It costs approximately $330 to send a
man to Cambridge, and there is no chance of making this up from gate
receipts, as Stanford could obtain no split from the easterners.
The Drake promoters are so anxious to have Stanford attend that they
will pay practically all of the expenses of the team. Should a team go to
the meet it would consist of Captain Hartranft and several relay teams.
The conference meet, of course, could be entered at a small cost.
Scholarship is an important consideration. The men who are sent to
the I. C. A. A. A. A. usually lose most of a quarter's work, while it would
just take a few days from the quarter to send teams to the Drake relays
and coast conference meet.
Last year when the scholarship committee agreed to sanction the going
of the team to Boston they expressed a desire, which was assented to by
the Board of Athletic Control, that if the team went to the Atlantic coast
that year, another such extensive trip would not be planned for some time
to come. Should the hoard vote to send the team east it is probable that
the scholarship committee will present opposition.
One of the reasons Stanford should enter a first team in the coast con
ference is because of the friendliness it would create with the other mem
bers of the conference. In the past, northern universities have felt that
Stanford was not playing fair with them to forsake the west for import
ant eastern meets. At present it seems desirable to agree, so that Stanford
will have friends in the conference should it need them.
Last year a number of the Stanford track men who went east com
plained of the change in weather conditions which materially affected their
performances. If Stanford clearly has an almost certain chance to win
with a five or six-man team it would be worth while to send that many
men east. Hartranft, Work, Richardson, Miller, and Leistner should ac
count for more than twenty points, and should a few other men develop it
might pay to send a team east.
Unless it is certain that Stanford will be on top at Boston it will do
more harm than good to send the team east. The Cards are sure to figure
prominently in the coast meet, and mile and two-mile relay teams might be
entered in the Drake relays which possibly would be able to lower world
records. —W. W. K.

SATURDAY AFTERNOON'S most impressive event was not the
Stanford track victory over U. S. C., but the spectacle of Trojarf and
Cardinal hobnobbing at the barbecue given the two teams by the Univer-
the meet. Misunderstanding and disagreement have given way
to friendly competition now that the hulabaloo is over.
A first step was made toward establishing a new era in Pacific Coast
athletics. The bitterness and rancor of broken relations is being overcome
by sociability. It now remains for the rest of the Stanford and U. S. C.
student-bodies to follow suit to accomplish a complete understanding be
tween the two universities. What if it does take longer than one after
noon? ' —C. C. S.

WITII AN EXHAUSTING vacation barely finished and with the
harrowing memory of tuition fees still fresh in the undergraduate mind,
Skull and Snakes invites the campus to.a jolly-up. It seems altogether
fitting and proper that some such step be taken. Now that the faculty ax
has decimated the ranks of our care-free friends, we welcome the promise
of refreshment. Let us not fail our duty to cheer each other up in this,
our hour of need. »
