Ruble Q.—No, little lady, the recent
issue was entirely the work the class of
'28. What you heard your friend say was
that the faculty were going to put out a

Number.
I trust that this will clear the matter

quested to put in an appearance at the
office of Cabbages and each will be pre
sented with a handsomely engraved,
rustless-steel stilletto in order that
they may be able to settle their little
differences of opinion on the question of
"Dinks, to Be Worn or Not to Be
Worn?" with no further delay. Results
of the compromise effected will be an
nounced later. Sponsors will be present
to see that right is victorious.
