## 
### 
Fewer "fiunkouts" than were re-
I ported during the fall quarter were
mado in the past quarter, according
jto Miss Huston of tlie registrar's of
! ilce. Though final figures will not be
released until Friday it is probable
that the total number will lie between
sixty and seventy, as compared to the
eighty-seven in the fall quarter.
Scholarship difficulties hit several
of the athletic teams hard blows, not
ably the football squad, when three
freshmen, all potential varsity ma
terial, were dropped. John Altaffer,
triple threat man; William Pabst, line
man, and Douglas Jardine, back, were
declared ineligible for registration.
The varsity track team lost two
men, one through studies and the
other as a result of previous competi
tion for three years. Paul Murphy,
two-miler, and James Arthur, discus
thrower, were the ones affected.
