# INTRAMURAL TEAMS START FIRST BALL GAMES ON MONDAY
## Forty-Two Baseball Squads in Seven Leagues Will Play for Trophy 
### 
With the opening of the intramural
baseball series next Monday athletes
of the living groups will start on a
program of seven sports, baseball,
track, golf, swimming, soccer, tennis,
and handball.
Forty-two nines will fight it out for
the intramural trophy this season. The
teams have been arranged in seven
leagues of six squads each. Twenty
games a week are scheduled over a
period of six weeks. Four intramural
diamonds back of the tennis courts,
the freshman field, and the Sequoia
diamond will be used. C. W. Davis
asks that all men desiring to umpire
in the series see him at once.
Immediately after the finals in base
ball have been concluded intramural
track will get under way. The same
rules as were used last year will be
in force, whereby the ten highest men
from each living group will score in
each event. Swimming, handball, and
golf complete the intramural schedule.
The first competition between liv
ing groups will be held this quarter.
Each organization will be entitled to
enter a two-man team, and the halls
one squad from each floor. The tourna
ment will last not more than two
weeks, and will probably be played at
the Burlingame Country Club. Varsity
and freshman players will be barred.
Entries opened today in Encina gym.
Davis is planning a much more am
bitious schedule in golf than has ever
been attempted before, due to the in
creased interest shown in the game
during the past few months. A com
mittee from the Stanford Golf Club
will work in conjunction with him in
arranging the details of the tourna
ments. He will try to have the varsity
match with California held in the
spring instead of in the fall, in order
that he may get a better line on avail
able material through a series of in
tramural tourneys.
Interclass games are scheduled in
soccer and tennis. The sophomores
at present hold a one-half point lead
over the seniors for all-round athletic
honors. Davis asks that class presi
dents appoint managers as soon as
possible. The tennis matches will start
immediately after the varsity games
