j was the first man appointed to the Faculty
by Dr. Jordan at the opening of Stanford
and has been registrar ever since.
Dr. Mitchell has been on the faculty
staff since his graduation and has, espcc
i ially in recent years, been chairman of a
| number of university committees calling
I for ability in organization and manage
j ment of detail. So much of his time has
I been occupied with this administrative
work, especially since the organizaiton of
the Lower Division which supervises all
the work of students during their first two
years, that he has given only part of his
time to teaching.
Has Acted in Many -Capacities
For many years he has been chairman
of the committee that enforces the health
regulations of the university in various
j directions, and of that which arranges
j schedules and examinations to avoid con
! flicts and overlapping. He was also a
' member of the registration committee, of
! which the registrar is chairman.
From the beginning of the Board of
| Athletic Control, which manages the
buildings and "grounds and finances of the
physical training and athletic activities of
[ the university, he has been its secretary
'and treasurer, and he is also secretary of
the faculty committee on athletics.
Professor Mitchell has also organized
a number of Stanford enterprises, includ
ing the central bureau of accounts, through
which the finances of all undergraduate
enterprises are handled, the Stanford Un
ion, which serves as a center of under
j graduate life, and the Students' Guild,
which was formed to provide hospital
care to students at low rates. As treas
urer of the Board of Athletic Control he
managed the financing of the Stanford
stadium and the building of Branner hall,
: the men's dormitory crccted out of re
ceipts from contests in the stadium. As
: first chairman of the Board of Governors
j of the Stanford Union he worked out a
; financial scheme to make that institution
! self-supporting.
As a chemist Dr. Mitchell attracted par-
I ticular public attention by his work in
I cooperation with other Stanford men in
, devising methods by which agriculture
could be saved, from disaster through ce
ment dust near cement factories and
through smelter fumes. Through these
investigations and experiments methods
were worked out which resulted in in
creased profit', in some instances, to all
parties concerned, although previously
orchards and crops were being destroyed
I with innumerable lawsuits as the outcome.
Graduating from Stanford in 1903, Dr.
â€¢ Mitchell received his master's degree the
i next year and his doctorate in 1909, liaving
in the meantime spent a year in European
study. He began teaching t'a Stanford
the year after his graduation, and with
the exception of the year in Europe, has
been continuously on the faculty since
that time.
