fProm Miami,
Florida
comes the report that a 62-
year-old man played 144
holes of golf, walking a
course 3,030 yards sixteen
times. It did not state the
kind or make of Golf Shoes
that he wore —but it's an even bet that they
were Good Shoes.
If any of you Youngsters think that you would
like to try to beat this record, we suggest that
you let us fit you with first a pair of TOM
LOGAN'S Golf Oxfords. You'll know then that
you will have no trouble with your feet.
In Tan Grain with Crepe soles they sell at $9.
