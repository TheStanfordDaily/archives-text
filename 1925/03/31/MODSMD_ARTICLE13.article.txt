# STANFORD TO DEBATE UTAH TEAM THURSDAY
## Total Japanese Exclusion to Be Advocated by Bruce And Scott 
### 
Charles Craven Scott and Raymond R.
Bruce will compose the team to represent
l Stanford in the debate against the Utah
: Agricultural College Thursday, April 2,
jat 8 o'clock in the Little Theater. The
Stanford team will uphold the present law
of total exclusion of the Japanese, while
| Utah will present arguments advocating
Japanese admission to the United States
on a quota basis similar to that restricting
I the immigration of European races.
Both of the Stanford debaters are
; sophomores, and were on the freshman
| team last year. Bruce was the leader of
| the team to face the California frosh,
While Scott led the debate against the
College of the Pacific in his freshman
year. The former is an extemporaneous
speaker of exceptional ability, and so is
strong on rebuttal. Scott has a good de
bating voice and a clear, concise manner
of delivery.
The Utah team lias a reputation of be
ing one of the strongest aggregations in
the Rocky Mountain area. They have de
bated the University of California several
times in past years and are considered by
them as being a very* difficult team from
whom to win a decision. Among twenty
teams with which U. S. C. lias debated,
Utah and Stanford are placed as the two
strongest.
In arguing for a quota basis, the oppo
nents of Scott and Bruce will present
opinions for their side of the "Japanese
Question" from President Coolidge and
Charles E. Hughes, while Stanford will
advance pqints for total exclusion as en
forced by the present law.
A system of judging that has not here
tofore been used at Stanford will be em
ployed. Due to the difficulties that have
arisen in the past to the* fairness of a
decision either by judges or the audience,
in tl;.s debaie there will be two judges,
and the vote of the audience will be con
sidered as the vote of a third judge.
Another debating team from the Agri
cultural College recently won from the
Kansas State Normal College, while a
Stanford team debated several southern
colleges in a trip taken during the spring
vacation.
The Utah team will be entertained at
Toyon hall during their stay at Stanford.
