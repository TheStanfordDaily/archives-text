# TRYOUTS FOR CAST OF JUNIOR OPERA CONTINUED TONIGHT
## 
### 
Tryouts for the 1926 Junior Opera
were started this afternoon, and will con
tinue tonight from 7 to 10 in the Woman's
Clubhouse. Women tryoutees are spe
cially urged to come out, as there are
more feminine roles tlian usual in this
year's production. Tryouts will continue
tomorrow afternoon from 3:30 to 5 and
tomorrow night from 7 to 10, in the As
sembly hall.
This year's opera will have several new
features, among which will be an aero
plane escapade, a Mexican revolution, and
an American love scene. The latter is, of
course, an innovation for Stanford Junior
Operas. The "piece de resistance" will be
the parade of the Mexican soldier, re
viewed by the Mexican chief of staff and
his generalissimos. Stanford's foremost
character actor will also be seen in a short
skit with a weird theme.
The music already turned in is of a
very high order, many of the pieces reach
ing C sharp. Love songs, patter songs,
and just songs will be interspersed
throughout the production, with several
dance numbers for the choruses which
appear to be real hits.
