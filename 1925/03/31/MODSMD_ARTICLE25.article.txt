# The 						Young-er Gen-er-a-tion

Having the public status of "collegian" has its disadvantages. No
matter how hard an admitted collegian may try, he can never escape being
tagged as part of the younger generation. And, as any member of any
other generation will tell you, the younger generation is fair prey.
By this time it should be fairly well understood by members of that
unfortunate class—the citizens of tomorrow —that conditions are not quite
the same as when the serious-minded gentlemen with the brief-cases were
boys. Yet the popular philosophers can never quite be convinced. They
insist upon writing and talking, at every possible opportunity, about the
deplorable state to which things have come.
There are really two classes of great-hearted elders. Some write or
talk at every possible opportunity and others write or talk at every possible
opportunity for getting a half-cent a word for their stuff. It is the latter
group which needs regulation.
One expects to be regretted by the family. They regret the younger
generation of taxes, insurance rates and similar inevitabilities. It is
simply part of the game, and their amateur standing is maintained at
enough expense. Their sincerity can scarcely be doubted. The younger
generation loves the family and freely forgives them for questioning our
perfection if it amuses them.
But at least one of the younger generation does not love the profes
sional stand-aghaster. Somebody is always mailing something one of
them wrote and before we discover what it is we have read enough to com
pletely destroy an ordinarily sunny disposition.
Next to H. L. Mencken on religion, there is no worse reading than the
thoughts of somebody who feels that the younger generation is peculiarly
outrageous. We maintain that the younger generation is not even par
ticularly outrageous. And, conversely, there is no real evidence that our
friends are exceptionally commendable.
One one hand we have male and female sob-sisters in anguish over the
jazz age. They allege that the more and more radical dances indicate a
general depravation. Thrill-seeking is said to have supplanted the finer
pursuits of life. And when, pray, hasn't thrill-seeking done so? Whose
fault is it that enterprising youth gets no more jolt out of the old-fashioned
wajtz. If it hadn't been for the unspeakable rascals who made the waltz
more popular than the minuet, the younger generation might now be re
ceiving blame for just that. ,
On the other hand, there are those who ecstatically proclaim the dawn
of a new day—all because there seems to be one or two beings, call them
human or inhuman as you choose, included in this same generation. Of
course a new day is dawning. That is a characteristic of new days.
The genius of youth has been heralded by some as revolting at the
usual dawning process and these writers think that the idea is pretty fine.
The varsity thinkers are winning their block YG's solving the new prob
lems of a changed world after their own new and superior method. Non
sense. There aren't any new problems. There may be new arrangements
or conditions, but the mysteries are the same as always. Just why the
younger generation deserves such a huge cheer for recognizing the obvious
may possibly be one of the new problems to which modern literature so
hysterically refers. We doubt this exception.
It is plain, however, that the younger generation cheer leaders deserve
discredit.
What makes it all so upsetting is the fact that all the riot is caused by
a lot of middle-aged nuisances, not of the younger generation at all. They
should be old enough, in fact, to be normal about it.
If these people do not like the effect when their hair falls out, they buy
toupees. Is there no way of fitting a covering for their imaginations simi
lar to that with which they choose to disguise their skulls ? At any rate, let
us invent a cataloguing system of distiguishing marks to use in indicating
their literature. We have been lured into their clutches too often.
It is getting so that anybody who enjoys a bit of college now and then
is branded forthwith. We choose to be normal. The younger generation
and its alleged activities leave us cold. All reading matter on this subject
henceforth will be sent to the defenseless tots at the Stanford Home for
Convalescent Children.

insist upon writing and talking, at every possible opportunity, about the
deplorable state to which things have come.
There are really two classes of great-hearted elders. Some write or
talk at every possible opportunity and others write or talk at every possible
opportunity for getting a half-cent a word for their stuff. It is the latter
group which needs regulation.
One expects to be regretted by the family. They regret the younger
generation of taxes, insurance rates and similar inevitabilities. It is
simply part of the game, and their amateur standing is maintained at
enough expense. Their sincerity can scarcely be doubted. The younger
generation loves the family and freely forgives them for questioning our
perfection if it amuses them.
But at least one of the younger generation does not love the profes
sional stand-aghaster. Somebody is always mailing something one of
them wrote and before we discover what it is we have read enough to com
pletely destroy an ordinarily sunny disposition.
Next to H. L. Mencken on religion, there is no worse reading than the
thoughts of somebody who feels that the younger generation is peculiarly
outrageous. We maintain that the younger generation is not even par
ticularly outrageous. And, conversely, there is no real evidence that our
friends are exceptionally commendable.
One one hand we have male and female sob-sisters in anguish over the
jazz age. They allege that the more and more radical dances indicate a
general depravation. Thrill-seeking is said to have supplanted the finer
pursuits of life. And when, pray, hasn't thrill-seeking done so? Whose
fault is it that enterprising youth gets no more jolt out of the old-fashioned
wajtz. If it hadn't been for the unspeakable rascals who made the waltz
more popular than the minuet, the younger generation might now be re
ceiving blame for just that. ,
On the other hand, there are those who ecstatically proclaim the dawn
of a new day—all because there seems to be one or two beings, call them
human or inhuman as you choose, included in this same generation. Of
course a new day is dawning. That is a characteristic of new days.
The genius of youth has been heralded by some as revolting at the
usual dawning process and these writers think that the idea is pretty fine.
The varsity thinkers are winning their block YG's solving the new prob
lems of a changed world after their own new and superior method. Non
sense. There aren't any new problems. There may be new arrangements
or conditions, but the mysteries are the same as always. Just why the
younger generation deserves such a huge cheer for recognizing the obvious
may possibly be one of the new problems to which modern literature so
hysterically refers. We doubt this exception.
It is plain, however, that the younger generation cheer leaders deserve
discredit.
What makes it all so upsetting is the fact that all the riot is caused by
a lot of middle-aged nuisances, not of the younger generation at all. They
should be old enough, in fact, to be normal about it.
If these people do not like the effect when their hair falls out, they buy
toupees. Is there no way of fitting a covering for their imaginations simi
lar to that with which they choose to disguise their skulls ? At any rate, let
us invent a cataloguing system of distiguishing marks to use in indicating
their literature. We have been lured into their clutches too often.
It is getting so that anybody who enjoys a bit of college now and then
is branded forthwith. We choose to be normal. The younger generation
and its alleged activities leave us cold. All reading matter on this subject
henceforth will be sent to the defenseless tots at the Stanford Home for
Convalescent Children.
Having the public status of "collegian" has its disadvantages. No
matter how hard an admitted collegian may try, he can never escape being
tagged as part of the younger generation. And, as any member of any
other generation will tell you, the younger generation is fair prey.
By this time it should be fairly well understood by members of that
unfortunate class—the citizens of tomorrow —that conditions are not quite
the same as when the serious-minded gentlemen with the brief-cases were
boys. Yet the popular philosophers can never quite be convinced. They
