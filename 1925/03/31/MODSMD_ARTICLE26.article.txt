# The 						Glee Club Tour
## 
### 
Considerable criticism accompanies the glee club on its return from a
southern tour as a result of a concert that was given at a Los Angeles high
school. A few years ago the Stanford Glee Club appeared before the
student body of this same institution and gave a delightful concert â€”not
too much comedy, and not too much so-called "heavy stuff."
This year the same student body was greatly disappointed. Instead
of listening to a concert that was entertaining as well as edifying they
were forced to maintain a polite indulgence during forty minutes of choral
numbers and hymns colored only once by the rendition of a time-worn
ballad based upon a Biblical incident of alleged humor.
The same numbers were sung on several occasions to groups of alumni
who had come prepared for just such a concert, and they were highly
pleased. The club should realize that in order to gain sympathy from an
audience they must first of all give it what it wants. High school students
do not appreciate a heavy concert. t
The same thing in general holds true on the campus. It is correct that
the home concert of the glee club is well attended, but the audience is al
ways composed chiefly of the older residents of the campus and Palo Alto.
This has been deplored before. Whose fault is it? Is the glee club
entertaining the audience or is the audience indulging the glee club? lhe
responsibility plainly rests on the club.
There has never been a criticism on the quality of the performance.
The club can sing and it can and docs sing splendidly. But the stuff it
insists upon singing! J* N. L.
