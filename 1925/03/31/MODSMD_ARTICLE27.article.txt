V. G. D.
Registration day — rain — grades —
consultations —Mon Dieu!
What to do? "All you need to do
is to forget yourself and your miser
able little quakings. Go out into a
lonely place in the woods, take oft'
your coat and yell! Then begin."
Would that the "Intelligencia" might
read the funny papers. The last words
of the Katzenjammer Kids in Sun
day's "Chronicle" deserves a place
beside Cabell's "Jurgen."
Imagination—plus the eternal search
for —what? The Administration build
ing has been full of people all day.
Why?
"I saw a cow gazing amorously at
the bull on a Bull Durham billboard.
In that cow's eyes lay, as I have never
seen it so illuminatingly expressed,
the philosophy of the futility of most
men's earthly longings, ambitions, and
dreams."
Why is it that members of other
universities, for example the Univer
sity of Southern California track team,
Saturday, remark upon the "excessive
informality and quite—perhaps—artis
tic carelessness" of the men's attire?
Mental and physical ability of the
superior grade may be accompanied
by "carelessness;" when it is of the
lowest ten per cent it always is.
"Life is queer." Life is very queer.
"All is over," they say, they feel, it
should be —yes, it should be.
"Long have you timidly waded hold
ing a plank by the shore,
"Now I will you to be a bold swim
mer, to jump off in the midst of the
sea, rise again, nod to me, shout, and
laughingly dash with your hair."
H'm.
