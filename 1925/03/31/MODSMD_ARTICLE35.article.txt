# UNIVERSITY PLANS HIGH POWER PLANT
## 
### 
A new high voltage laboratory will
be constructed in the valley between
the l'ine and Mayfieid reservoir hills
by the University. Work on the project
will be started early this summer and
the laboratory is expected to be fin
ished by next spring.
The Trustees have already appropri
ated about 200 acres of land, including
a strip 300 feet wide and 8000 feet long
on which to suspend the large conduc
tors to be subjected to a million volts
three-phase. Six transformer units,
weighing 27 tons each and with a com
bined capacity of 2,100,000 volts, will
be furnished by the General Electric
C!o. This will make available, for tests,
the highest voltage ever produced at
commercial frequency.
Supply power for the laboratory will
be taken from the service connections
of the Pacific Gas & Electric Company
and will give the energy required by
the two 800 kilovolt ampers, three
phase generators and the two 500
horsepower synchronous motors. The
future of development of electrical
power interconnection depends upon
the outcome of experiments on high
voltage transmission which will bo
made in the new laboratory.
The present high voltage laboratory,
which is located west of the Press
building, was erected and equipped in
1913. It will be used hereafter for ele
mentary instruction and for re
searches requiring the use of com
flhratively low voltage sources. All
plans and specifications for the erec
tion of the laboratories have been
completed by the University archi
tects, Blakewell and Brown, San Fran
cisco.

Willamette JLTniversity debaters re
cently defeated the debate team from
the University of West Virginia in
a debate held at Willamette. The ques
tion concerned the adoption of Senator
La Follette's proposal to allow Con
gress, by a two-thirds majority, to de
clare constitutional laws already de
clared unconstitutional by the Su
preme Court. The West Virginia de
bate team will come to Stanford in the
course of its tour.
