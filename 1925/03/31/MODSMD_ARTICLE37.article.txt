### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Notre Dame has played 152 football games in the last eighteen years and
lost only seven? To lose on an average of only one game every thirty mouths
is a record that no other university can equal over such a span of years. And
it is especially remarkable when Notre Dame's uniformly tough schedules of
games are considered.
Rupert Phillips and Raymond Thomas, two Englishmen, played from the
first tee of one golf course to the last hole of another, twenty miles away, in
close to GOO strokes? They started at the Radyr Golf Club at 2 p.m. on
Dec. 3rd and finished at 1:30 P. M. on Dec. sth at the Southerndown course,
i having consumed sixteen hours in actual play. They carried large ordnance
maps, and played around swamps, woods, and ploughed fields, averaging about
yards a stroke.
"Kewpie" Osborne, Brooklyn pitcher and possessor of the largest hands in
basfeball, can hold five regulation baseballs at one time in his right hand?
"Big-Hearted Ernie," as he was playfully dubbed in Chicago, also amuses his
teammates by throwing four balls with one fling, thus proving himself to be
the only pitcher who can give a batter a pass with one pitch. Osborne is
6 feet, 4 inches tall.
