# NEW REPORT SHOWS CONVALESCENT HOME HAS RAPID GROWTH
## 
### 
The Stanford Convalescent Home
has accumulated property and endow
ment worth $173,903.77, according to
the annual report just issued. A satis
factory financial condition is shown,
and a rapid growth since the home
was established in 1919.
During the early part of the year
the original Stanford unit was closed
for repairs, and a new unit to care
for twenty children was built by Mrs.
Henry J. Crocker in memory of Mrs.
Kate Dillon McLaughlin. This enables
the home to care for 40 children. Sta
tistics show that 97 per cent of the
children treated come from San Fran
cisco, and 45 per cent of these from
■the Stanford hospital and clinic.
The cost for each child per day is
$2.71. The children receive medical
care, are taught hygienic habits, and
when strong enough are given regular
school work.
The main sources of income are the
interest from the general endowment,
operation receipts, and public contri
butions. Sixteen thousand six hun
dred and ninety-four dollars was do

nated to the home by the Community
Chest last year.
University and Palo Alto women
visit the children, and do the mending
| for the home. On Labor Day an after-
I noon holiday is granted by the Univer
sity, and students go out to work on
the home grounds.
The report contains statistics, ac
counts of the work", several pictures of
the home and children, and an appeal
for $3000 to balance the budget.
