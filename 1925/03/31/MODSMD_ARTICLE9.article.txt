## Western Association Formed At Vacation Meeting in Southern California 
### 
Arthur Duncombe, business manager
1 of the Chaparral, was electd president
j of the Western Association of College
Comics at an organization meeting
I held in Los Angeles during the spring
j vacation, â€¢ when representatives from
! the leading college comic magazines in
the West were guests of U. S. C.
i The new association was formed
' under the leadership of Chappie to
| bring the western publications in
! closer relations and to affiliate with
i the national body already composed
of the middle western and eastern
bodies.
A constitution was adopted by the
delegates. Duncombe, and Arnold
j Tscliudy, of the California Pelican,
were named as western representa
tives at the meeting of the national
body to be held at Ann Arbor, Michi
gan, May 6.
In the constitution of the new body
the purpose was set forth as follows:
"For the purpose of promoting the
general welfare of college magazines;
of developing the closest harmony and
co-operation among them; of regulat
ing advertising in order to promote
a bettor spirit of co-operation between
the advertiser and the college comics."
Resolutions San Spicy Humor
Resolutions were passed condemn
ing the use of spicy humor in the col
lege magazines. In accordance with a
regulation made by the association,
College Humor will have the exclusive
right for one year to material from
the comics represented at the rate of
$20 a page. This was done in order
to keep the cheaper magazines from
using exchanges, and College Humor
will be entitled to sue other publica
tions for violations under the contract
made with the association.
Judge, Life, the Literary Digest, and
contemporary comics are the only
magazines which are allowed to clip
from the western comics free of
charge.
Delegates were sent to Los Angeles
from the Stanford Chaparral, Califor
nia Pelican, Colorado Dodo, Pomona
Sagehen, and the Southern California
Wampus. Invitations were sent to all
western colleges publishing a comic
magazine to join the association.
Arnold Tschudy, of the Pelican, was
elected vice-president, and George
Orme, of the Wampus, was chosen
secretary-treasurer. The board of di
rectors of the new organization will
be composed of Lawrence Dunn, cf
the Dodo, and Leonard Sonneman, of
the Sagehen, in addition to the three
officers.

A 24-foot coaching tower was re
cently erected to facilitate the coach
ing of Cornell crews at Ithaca.
Launches were formerly used but
under the new system field glasses
will aid the coach to follow the maneu
vers of the squad.

Microphones have been installed at
New York which will
record every spoken word in the re
hearsal of plays.

Investigations at the University of
Chicago show that students should
spend 42 hours a week studying, and
only two hours at parties.
