Training for
the bond business
HALSEY, STUART k CO. believes that
a man who is worth taking into its organi
zation is worth training. Jioth in Chicago and
in New York, a well-equipped bond school is
maintained by this house. Each new member
of the buying or selling staff is given three
months' intensive training, with pay, before he
is assigned to actual work.
The purpose of this is two-fold: (a) to give
the man a better chance to make good for him
self and for the house; (b) to make sure that
our men are competent to renderthe responsible
sort of service which every bond house owes to
its customers.
If you are considering the bond business as
a career after graduation, you will be greatly
helped toward a right decision by reading our
pamphlet,"The Bond Business as an Occu
pation for College Men." We shall be glad to
send you a copy npon request.
