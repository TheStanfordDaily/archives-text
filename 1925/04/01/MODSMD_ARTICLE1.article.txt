# EX COMMITTEE NAMES GROUP TO INVESTIGATE NUMBER "S" AWARDS
## Frances Vaughan Will Fill Vacancy Made by Helen Lewis' Departure 
### 
The rule that swimmers who for three
years win an event in the Stanford-
California meet be awarded a Block j
"S" was abolished at the meeting of
the Executive Committee last night. !
This, together with the appointment
of a committee to investigate the al
leged making of too many awards was
made following the decision that the
weight basketball teams not be given
awards this year.
Frances Vaughan was named to fill I
the place on the committee left va- J
cant by Helen Lewis, who is not regis
tered in the University this quarter.
Helen Lewis has left on a trip to
Hawaii.
A recommendation that the gymna-1
slum team be granted more awards j
than the present two allotted to it |
was voted down. The present rule
reads that only the two Stanford men j
having the highest number of points
in the meet with California be granted
their awards. Had the recommenda
tion been accepted any man who
placed in the meet would receive an
award.
The committee which was appointed
with a view to reducing the number
of awards made in athletic fields is
composed of Harry Maloney, R. L.
Templeton, Carl Doerr, Ted Miller,
Gift'ord Troyer, and Jake Irwin. Sev
eral suggestions in this line as well
as proposed changes in the require
ments for track Black "S" will be in-;
vestigated by the committee.
Both weight teams, having failed I
to win in California games, were con-;
sidered as not having "distinguished" :
themselves and therefore will not re
ceive awards.
Norman Tucker was named the bas- !
ketball manager for next season and
four junior managers were appointed.
The minutes of the meeting are as !
