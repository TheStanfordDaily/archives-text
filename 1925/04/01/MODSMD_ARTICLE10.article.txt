# JOURNALISM' IS MADE PART OF NEW SCHOOL
## Change Will Broaden Scope Of Training and Give Degree in Course 
### 
The journalism curriculum at Stan
ford University will become a division
| of the recently created School of So
! cial Science next year, being trans
ferred from the English department,
where it has developed from a single
; course offered in 1910 to a point which
has won the designation of a "Class
A" school in the ranking of schools of
journalism in the United States.
The transfer of the journalism divi
sion to the School of Social Sciences
has been made because the courses
and provisions of that school are par
ticularly well adapted to the needs of
journalism students. The theory of
journalism instruction at Stanford has
always been that the proper college
preparation for journalism is the
broadest possible course, with a pre
ponderance of English, history, eco
nomics and political science, together
with some training in technical theory
and practice.
The Lower Division requirements at
Stanford bring the students during
their first two years into contact with
th fundamental fields of human inter
est, and the basic course of the School
of Social Sciences insures their gain
ing a knowledge of the principles of
economics, political science, psychol
ogy, and ethics. By the end of their
course they must also have gained a
knowledge of the history of the United
States and of Europe or some of its
leading nations.
With this as a basis, the journalism
students will take specialized courses
in their own fiel<J during the latter
years of college, and still have con
siderable latitude for choice of sub
jects according to individual interests
or needs.
