# CARDINAL DEBATERS WILL CHANGE STYLE FOR UTAH CONTEST
## 
### 
The Oxford style of informal, direct
argument will characterize the style
of the Stanford debating team which
meets Utah Agricultural College in
j the Little Theatre tomorrow evening.
All through tlfe preparation, the ele
ments of interest have been upper
-1 most in the efforts of Craven Scott
and Raymond Bruce who are to appear
j for the Cardinals. They are to defend
the negative of the question: Resolved,
That the Johnson immigration law
should be amended so as to admit the
Japanese on the same basis as other
Europeans.
An entirely unique system of judg
ing the debate is to be tried at Stan
ford for the first time, Thursday.
Thare will be a critic judge, who will
cast his ballot and explain to the
audience his reason for his decision.
Then there will be a "balance judge"
who will merely vote. The third unit
of the decision will be the vote of the
audience.
Dr. Willard M. Smith, the coach of
j debate at Mills College, will be the
| critic judge in the contest, and Pro
: fessor Robert T. Crane of the Depart
i ment of Political Scienc of the Uni
j versity of Michigan will be the balance
judge.
By the time Utah arrives at Stan-
I ford, the team will have debated the
| immigration question six times. Al
> though this is their first appearance
on the coast, Utah has the reputation
! of being one of the strongest teams
j in the West.
Scott and Bruce will speak for their
first time on a Stanford varsity team.
Both have had considerable previous
experience. They were the leaders of
' the freshman team last year and have
enviable records in preparatory school
I forenslcs.
The Utah contest is one of a series
arranged for a squad selected in open
; try-out early in the year. The two men
i who appear have been working on the
immigration question almost constant
ly for three months.
