# CORNHUSKERS LEAVE FOR CALIFORNIA TODAY
## 
### 
Coach "Indian" Schulte and his Ne-|
braska track team leave Lincoln today |
for the coast and will arrive in San
Francisco Friday morning.
Schulte is bringing with him a
strong band of Cornliuskers and one
that has held the Missouri Valley Con
ference outdoor track title for several
years and won its first indoor title
two weeks ago at Kansas City.
Two years ago the Middle Western
ers invaded the Pacific Coast for the
first time and were defeated by Call-!
fornia, 79 to 56. Walter Christie's men j
gained most of their points in the j
field events while the Nebraskans!
gave the Bears quite a scare on the j
track.
Nebraska Weak on Track
Conditions seem to be the same this
season with the visitors again weak
in the eld events. As for the Corn
hucker cinder-path entrants, they will
undoubtedly be handicapped by the
climatic change and lack of outdoor
practice. Frequent "cold snaps" have
kept them indoors and the several out
door workouts here will be practically
the first.
Two of Schulte's biggest stars are !
also two of "Snap-it-up" Dawson's
football celebrities —"Gipp" Locke,
called the fastest man in football togs,
and Ed Weir, unanimous choice for j
All-American tackle.
Locke Runs Ten Flat
Locke ran last year for the Nebraska ;
varsity and succeeded in doing 0:10,
in the hundred and around 0:21 2-5;
for the furlong in outdoor meets. His
first appearance this season was in
the indoor meet at Kansas City at
which he tied the conference record
in the 50-yard dash of 0:05 2-5 made
two years ago by Keith Lloyd, now
of U. S. C. A year ago he set the
world's record in this race by finishing
in 0:05 1-5 at the Kansas City Athletic
Club games.
Weir specializes in the hurdle events
and may enter the shot. He beat Tay
lor, of Grinnell, Olympic Games hur
dler, in the Conference indoor meet
high hurdles, winning in 0:00 6-10. He
also won the lows, with Locke second,'
in 0:06. His outdoor times for the two
last seasons averaged a little above
0:15 for the highs and 0:24 2-5 in the
lows.
Quarter-Milers
Captain Crites and Daily are the
quarter-mile entrants, running it in
:50. They will both run the relay with
Locke and Scherrick, and Lewis, lialf
