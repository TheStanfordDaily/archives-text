# ODDS AGAINST CARDS ON EVE OF BASEBALL GAME WITH CAE NINE
## Close Scores to Mark Series; Outcome Hangs on Form Pitchers Possess 
### 
i
With odds against it, the Stanford
varsity will enter the baseball series
with California on the varsity dia
mond Saturday afternoon. The Bears
have come through a consistently suc
cessful preliminary season, while the
Cardinal has been hard pressed in all
i its early-season games.
At present Coach Harry Wolter has
J a better co-ordinated team than at any
time so far. During the spring trip the
nine made a fairly good showing, beat
j ing the University of California South
j ern Branch, and losing to Occidental
twice by very close scores, when the
Southerners had Teachout, their star
pitcher, on the mound.
The Cardinal pitching staff has im
proved consistently during the spring.
! With Nevers now able to work for the
| full nine innings, the team is greatly
| strengthened. The other two regular
J hurlers, Oviatt and Collins, have
j turned in good performances in the
j last few games.
In the field the nine has performed
j creditably in practically all the games,
but on the offense the batsmen have
lacked the ability to bunch their hits
sufficiently to secure a win. In several
contests Stanford has outhit the op
ponents but has failed to outscore
them.
Coach Zamloch of California has de
| veloped a team which has won games
| from all competitors with the excep
| tion of the St. Louis Cardinals who
won a game at their training camp,
j The Bears have three wins over Santa
! Clara and two from the Olympic Club,
j while the Cardinal dropped a game to
I each, though the Broncos were unable
to take the three-game series.
In Jack Nounan California has one
jof the best pitchers that has been
| there for several years. He has done
most of the mound work and has al-
I ways let down the opponents with but
' few hits, while the Bruin batters have
| been hitting with regularity.
