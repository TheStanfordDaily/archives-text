# FIRST-YEAR BASEBALL MEN MEET CUBS ON APRIL 4
## 
### 
Coach E. P. Hunt will invade the
California campus with his freshman
ball club Saturday for the first con
test of the annual three-game series
with the Bruin cubs. The second game j
will be played at Stanford the follow-'
ing Saturday and, if necessary, a
third tilt will be played at Berkeley
April 18.
Supplied with an abundance of good '
material at the start of the season.
Hunt has developed one of the strong-1
est first-year nines which has ever j
worn the Cardinal. His men have won
twenty games and have lost but two,!
one to a team of ex-big leaguers. Re-'
ports from across the bay indicate [
that Coach "Nibs" Price also has a i
formidable aggregation, but the Stan-!
ford mentor is confident of being able j
to avenge the defeat suffered by his j
1927 nine last year.
Babes Heavy Hitters
Thfe Card frosh is a team of excep- j
tionally heavy hitters. Even the pitch- J
ers have a habit of knocking two- j
baggers on the slightest provocation.
The pitching staff is strong. Philippi 1
is probably the most consistent per- j
former, but Sobieski and Reynolds are I
capable of turning in some first-class 1
work when they are right. Nissen is ;
also available for mound duty, but he j
is too valuable in the outfield to be '
called upon to hurl in the California !
series.
Sypher is the only first-string catcher
on the squad, but barring injury, is j
plenty good enough for any yearling :
team. He handles pitchers well, and
his pegs to the bases are fast andi
sure. The infield is fair. Garibaldi, on
second, is perhaps the smoothest
fielder on the team, in addition to
being a dangerous hitter. Maguire on
first and Clark, baseball captain, at
short, are also dependable. Price,
regular third-baseman, handles most j
of his chances cleanly, but occasion- i
ally gets excited and lets the ball slip
through him. He is not too strong with j
the willow.
A trio of hard hitters, Nissen, Weav-'
er, and Biaggini, make up the outfield. J
All three are deadly on flies. Biaggini |
has an iron peg. Snyde, Simras, Thomp-1
son, Adams, and Vincenti are utility (
men.

Babes Heavy Hitters
Thfe Card frosh is a team of excep- j
tionally heavy hitters. Even the pitch- J
ers have a habit of knocking two- j
baggers on the slightest provocation.
The pitching staff is strong. Philippi 1
is probably the most consistent per- j
former, but Sobieski and Reynolds are I
capable of turning in some first-class 1
work when they are right. Nissen is ;
also available for mound duty, but he j
is too valuable in the outfield to be '
called upon to hurl in the California !
series.
Sypher is the only first-string catcher
on the squad, but barring injury, is j
plenty good enough for any yearling :
team. He handles pitchers well, and
his pegs to the bases are fast andi
sure. The infield is fair. Garibaldi, on
second, is perhaps the smoothest
fielder on the team, in addition to
being a dangerous hitter. Maguire on
first and Clark, baseball captain, at
short, are also dependable. Price,
regular third-baseman, handles most j
of his chances cleanly, but occasion- i
ally gets excited and lets the ball slip
through him. He is not too strong with j
the willow.
A trio of hard hitters, Nissen, Weav-'
er, and Biaggini, make up the outfield. J
All three are deadly on flies. Biaggini |
has an iron peg. Snyde, Simras, Thomp-1
son, Adams, and Vincenti are utility (
men.
Coach E. P. Hunt will invade the
California campus with his freshman
ball club Saturday for the first con
test of the annual three-game series
with the Bruin cubs. The second game j
will be played at Stanford the follow-'
ing Saturday and, if necessary, a
third tilt will be played at Berkeley
April 18.
Supplied with an abundance of good '
material at the start of the season.
Hunt has developed one of the strong-1
est first-year nines which has ever j
worn the Cardinal. His men have won
twenty games and have lost but two,!
one to a team of ex-big leaguers. Re-'
ports from across the bay indicate [
that Coach "Nibs" Price also has a i
formidable aggregation, but the Stan-!
ford mentor is confident of being able j
to avenge the defeat suffered by his j
1927 nine last year.
