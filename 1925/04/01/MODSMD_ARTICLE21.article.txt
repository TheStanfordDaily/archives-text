# More, Not Less

### 
That the number of athletic awards be reduced was recommended to
the Executive Committee last night.
Undoubtedly such a ruling is intended to make the wearing of the "S"
in any form more of an honor to its holder. Many, perhaps, to whom ath
letics mean football, track, and baseball regret that awards are given for
the so-called minor sports.
But the "minor" sports men also work hard. The difference is merely
in the minds of the student body. Sports are on an amateur basis. None
of the players receives any reward but the satisfaction and honor which
come from having participated, so it would seem that more, not less, should
be given some form of university emblem.
In accordance with the Stanford policy of athletics for all, it is cer
tainly necessary to have some encouragement for all who may enter any
held of sport. The men get nothing out of it in a substantial way, and
letters provide a visible reward.
The lessening of the number of awards is merely making athletics more
exclusive, a thing bad in itself. —D. T. R.
