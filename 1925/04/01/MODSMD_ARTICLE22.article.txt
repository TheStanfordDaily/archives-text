# Dawes on the Warpath

### 
Vice-President Dawes undoubtedly deserves the support of the public
in his campaign to revise the senate rules. Mr. Dawes has aimed his at
tack primarily at those senators who show no great willingness to act with
out prodding, and he will arouse the resentment of these senators who
have an exalted opinion of their importance.
In case there is an attempt at reprisal, the vice-president can be relied
on to take care of himself. At present, our senate is the only law-making
l>ody in the world in which the will of all others may be thwarted by the
obstinacy of a single member. It is impossible to estimate the loss in time
and money and legislation blocked, occasioned by the stupid operation of
the senate. —G. P., Jr.
