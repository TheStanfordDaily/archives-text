# Course "Methods in Play Activities" Given by Davis
## 
### 
Announcement of the fact that the
course, "Methods in Pl.iy Activities,"
is required of all men who will take
a state teachers' certificate, has been
the cause of an increase in the enroll
ment for the course. The course was
omitted from the time schedule by
mistake.
It is being given by C. W. Davis in
Room 460, Monday, Wednesday, and
Friday at 2.
The graduates of Yale University,
if assembled, would constitute a city
of 40,000.
