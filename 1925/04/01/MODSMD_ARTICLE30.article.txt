# NEW YORK PLANS TO SEND STUDY GROUPS ABROAD THIS SUMMER
## 
### 
Nine European study groups will be
sent out by New York University this
summer, according to word received
on the campus today by Professor
Eliot G. Mears.
"In spite of the age-old saying to
the effect that a rolling stone gathers j
no moss," says a letter received by;
Professor Mears, "New York Univer-;
sity intends to prove that just the j
opposite is true by sending out these >
study groups, which will learn their
lessons on the run."
These migratory college students
will travel from Italy to Greece and
as far north as Scandinavia. They
will be given an opportunity to browse
around the famous galleries and mu- j
seums of Europe and delve into the
economic and industrial conditions in
the Southeast, which form a back
ground for the vast immigration to the i
United States. Extra sight-seeing time 1
will be provided in Paris and London
and the cities of Italy.
Dean James E. Lough of the extra- j
mural division of New York Univer-j
sity is directing the "European Sum
mer School." Professor Mears, who has j
offices in the Economics department I
and the President's office, co-operates
with Dean Lough, and will supply in-!
formation to those interested.
"Study about things and places on
the spot is of much more value than
in a classroom thousands of miles dis
tant," wrote Dean Lough to Professor
Mears. "It would be pretty hard to
forget the battle of Waterloo if you
heard the details while standing on
the spot where the Duke of Wellington
defeated 'the Little Corporal.' The
same comparison is true of languages."
Faculty for the summer cruise will
be made up of men and women from
several Eastern colleges, while the
expense is no more than that of the
usual summer school, and in some
cases is less. Students will be taken
to Europe on the Royal Mail boats
"Orduna" and "Orbita."
