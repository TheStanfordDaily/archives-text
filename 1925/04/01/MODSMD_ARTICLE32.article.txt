# PUBLIC SENTIMENT CONTROLS SPORTS SAYS DR. BARROW
## Stanford Athletic Director Is Quoted in Christian Science Monitor 
### 
Intercollegiate .sports are what the
public makes of them. Not what the
players and coaches make, hut what
the public through its expressed senti
ment at games, makes, said Dr. W. H.
Barrow, director of athletics, in an
interview published in the Christian j
Science Monitor recently. The article
continues:
Dr. Barrow expressed his opinion of
Conference rules and their bearing on j
good sportsmanship and declared that
sports generally would he benefited by j
having a sportsmanship week, "when ;
from the pulpit and through the news
papers and over the radio and through (
every public agency we could hear ex
tolled the iine joy of real sport."
Dr. Barrow came to Stanford in 1921
from Concord, Mass., where he was ;
general director of athletics at Middle-1
sex School. Since then, as director of J
athletics here, he has until recently
represented the university in the Pa-1
cific Coast Conference. His declara-;
tions come as a result of experiences j
in and observations of the Coast Con- j
ference and institutions.
"What part can the public play in j
the control of intercollegiate ath- J
letic-s?" he asked. "Intercollegiate j
athletics, as they are now conducted, i
depend largely on the public for sup
port. Those in Control cater to the
public's desires just as do the news
papers and the theatres.
"Public sentiment in regard to
sport will control those who control
sport. Of course, the general public
wants to see close contests; but if they
are really interested in the game for
the game's sake, if they are ready to
applaud clean play and fine sports
manship on either side, as in the gal
lery of a tennis match, that is the j
sort of thing they will get.
"If, on the contrary, the public be
comes too partisan, they will encour- ■
age the sort of thing they later criti-j
cize.
"Coaches and players are good j
sportsmen, and the stimulus for poor j
sportsmanship usually emanates in J
the firfct, instance from the teams' sup- \
porters or promoters. So the general j
public consisting of alumni and sport
followers can exert a tremendous in
fluence on intercollegiate athletics.
"If there is a wrong emphasis on j
athletics, it is because the public j
wants to see battles rather than j
games. If there is overemphasis, it
is because the public has a greater in
terest in football than in education.
"We should not take our college I
sports too seriously. A game is only a !
game. Champions are fleeting and
quickly forgotten, while only sports
manlike qualities are lasting and long

¥
remembered. The fun and value of a
game lie in the closeness of the con
test and not in the size of the score.
Rules Are an Influence
Good sportsmanship in the contests
can be assured by the general observ
ance of eligibility rules and rules of
the game, said Dr. Barrow. "However,
we must also have more of a real
sportsmanlike idea in our supporters
;ind followers and managers and
coaches," he declared. "With this
background, collcge athletics can be
above criticism and can be a fine in
fluence for the boy, for the institution
and for the public that gets its fun
and inspiration from watching our
1 contests.
j "A well-balanced and properly con
trolled athletic program can be one of
the finest influences in college life. On
the other hand, athletics, when over
; emphasized, or wrongly emphasized or
poorly controlled may be an evil to
i the student, a menace to the intellec
| tual leadership of the university and
a degrading rather than an uplifting
j interest for the. public.
"Our intercollegiate conferences and
associations have dpne a great deal
i toward eliminating some of the abuses
which are the inevitable outcome of
any activity involving prestige and
I large amounts of money as does inter
-1 collegiate sport.

good sportsmanship and declared that

Dr. Barrow came to Stanford in 1921
from Concord, Mass., where he was ;
general director of athletics at Middle-1
sex School. Since then, as director of J
athletics here, he has until recently
represented the university in the Pa-1
cific Coast Conference. His declara-;
tions come as a result of experiences j
in and observations of the Coast Con- j
ference and institutions.
"What part can the public play in j
the control of intercollegiate ath- J
letic-s?" he asked. "Intercollegiate j
athletics, as they are now conducted, i
depend largely on the public for sup
port. Those in Control cater to the
public's desires just as do the news
papers and the theatres.
"Public sentiment in regard to
sport will control those who control
sport. Of course, the general public
wants to see close contests; but if they
are really interested in the game for
the game's sake, if they are ready to
applaud clean play and fine sports
manship on either side, as in the gal
lery of a tennis match, that is the j
sort of thing they will get.
"If, on the contrary, the public be
comes too partisan, they will encour- ■
age the sort of thing they later criti-j
cize.
"Coaches and players are good j
sportsmen, and the stimulus for poor j
sportsmanship usually emanates in J
the firfct, instance from the teams' sup- \
porters or promoters. So the general j
public consisting of alumni and sport
followers can exert a tremendous in
fluence on intercollegiate athletics.
"If there is a wrong emphasis on j
athletics, it is because the public j
wants to see battles rather than j
games. If there is overemphasis, it
is because the public has a greater in
terest in football than in education.
"We should not take our college I
sports too seriously. A game is only a !
game. Champions are fleeting and

manlike qualities are lasting and long

¥

Good sportsmanship in the contests
can be assured by the general observ
ance of eligibility rules and rules of
the game, said Dr. Barrow. "However,
we must also have more of a real
sportsmanlike idea in our supporters
;ind followers and managers and

j "A well-balanced and properly con
trolled athletic program can be one of
