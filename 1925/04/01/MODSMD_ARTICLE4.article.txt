Second tryouts for the Junior Opera
will be held tonight from 7 to 10 in

There will be an opportunity, how
ever, for anyone who has not yet tried
out to do so tonight, according to
Delmer Daves, director of the show.
Everyone is eligible, except freshman

have in its cast and two choruses, the
pick of the campus in pulchritude and
