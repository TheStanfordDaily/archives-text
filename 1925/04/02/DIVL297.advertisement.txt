A COLLEGE MAN BUYS FOR VALUE
How to buy a suit!
Fabric is a matter of taste â€”your taste especially. Pick
out a fabric that you kike. But don't stop there. Don't
overlook the cut. It is important. Long after the nov
* elty of the fabric is gone, a suit properly cut will
give satisfaction every day you wear it. Satisfaction
is value. Don't overlook value. The conservative well
dressed man buys values and not novelties. Be sure you
are receiving the full value you pay out. It will give you
great satisfaction. That's why a man who has once worn
a Kuppenheimer Suit will hardly wear any other kind.
It's the value.
