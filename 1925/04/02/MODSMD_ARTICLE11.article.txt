The Stanford polo team will take
part in the athletic program being ar
ranged for University Day, April 18,
by playing the Santa Cruz Country
! Club four on the Highway Field, it
was anounced yesterday. The game
will be played at 10:30 a.m.
During the past two weeks the
Cards have competed with teams of
much higher rating than the Santa
Cruz four, and should enter the Uni
versity Day contest favorites to win.
In the recent California Novice Polo
Tournament played at Del Monte, the
Cards ran up against the strong Mid
wick Country Club team in the first
round. The Stanford men were elimi
nated by a 12 to 5 score, largely be
cause of nervousness in the first two
chukkers, when they allowed the Mid
wick squad to run up a six-goal score.
In the next six periods the country
club was held, 6 to 3.
This game marked the first entry
of a Stanford team in fast tournament
competition, and according to Captain
Jenkins, his men made a good impres
sion with the members of other teams
entered as well as with the spectators.
