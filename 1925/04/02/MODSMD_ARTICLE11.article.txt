# POLO SQUAD SCHEDULES TILT WITH SANTA CRUZ TEAM UNIVERSITY DAY
## BEATEN TWICE IN SOUTH Novice Tournament Results Make Cardinals Favorites Over Club Four 
### 
The Stanford polo team will take
part in the athletic program being ar
ranged for University Day, April 18,
by playing the Santa Cruz Country
! Club four on the Highway Field, it
was anounced yesterday. The game
will be played at 10:30 a.m.
During the past two weeks the
Cards have competed with teams of
much higher rating than the Santa
Cruz four, and should enter the Uni
versity Day contest favorites to win.
In the recent California Novice Polo
Tournament played at Del Monte, the
Cards ran up against the strong Mid
wick Country Club team in the first
round. The Stanford men were elimi
nated by a 12 to 5 score, largely be
cause of nervousness in the first two
chukkers, when they allowed the Mid
wick squad to run up a six-goal score.
In the next six periods the country
club was held, 6 to 3.
This game marked the first entry
of a Stanford team in fast tournament
competition, and according to Captain
Jenkins, his men made a good impres
sion with the members of other teams
entered as well as with the spectators.
Members of the Midwick team espe
cially were impressed with the show
ing of the Stanford players.
During the vacation the Cards also
took on the strong San Mateo Junior
team, which is ranked above the col
lege class in the American Polo Asso
ciation ratings. The Stanford men
were defeated 11 to 8, playing the
country club team from scratch.
With the nine-goal handicap which
they would have been allowed in
tournament play, the Cardinals would
have won the game, 17 to 11.
Two games were played with Ore
gon Agricultural College, March 21
and 23. Th O. A. C. team was hope
lessly outclassed, and was beaten in
both games, 13 to 2 and 11 to 0, many
second-string men being used for
Stanford in both tilts.
To date the Card four has played
nine games, winning four and losing
five. The Redshirts have run up a
total score of 61 goals in the nine
games as compared with 62 scored by
their opponents.
Fred Trotter, playing at No. 4, has
led the individual scoring with 20
goals to his credit. Irwin, No. 2, is
second with 13 markers, and Rocky
Thomas, No. 1, is third with 9.
The next game will probably be
played Saturday at San Mateo with
the San Mateo Juniors.
