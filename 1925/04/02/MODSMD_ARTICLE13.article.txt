# CHESS CLUB PLAYS MATCH WITH BEARS
## 
### 
At the first meeting of the Cardinal
Chess Club held Tuesday night at the
Old Union, it was decided to take over
the correspondence match with Cali
fornia instead of having a team play
off the contest. Kornfeld, Smith,
Blackford, Bramhall, Henderson, and
Robinson have been doing the work
for this match heretofore. A chess
board will be placed in the Bookstore
window sometime next week showing
the progress of the correspondence
match. All Stanford chess enthusiasts
are invited to offer suggestions for the
playing of the contest.
There will be a short meeting of
the club tonight at 6:45 in the Union
to discuss the next move.
