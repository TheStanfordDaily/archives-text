# MYSTERY IS SOLVED; MASQUE BALL TAKES PLACE ON APRIL 24
## 
### 
At last the blue cards bearing a red
l masque that have been conspicuous
lon campus bulletin boards for the
past few days have been clearly and
j lucidly explained. They are advertise
i ments for the notorious Masque Ball,
I sponsored by the Rally Committee.
| The date for the dance is April 24.
j In order that everybody will feel en-
I tirely at home, the committee has ar
ranged to have innumerable swings,
see-saws, slides, and rocking horses
installed in the pavilion, making it as
nearly resemble a playground as any
basketball pavilion could.
The price of admission will be one
dollar and fifty cents. The committee
members state that they have pur
posely made the price low in order to
leave the victims enough money to buy
their costumes.
E. E. Wells, who is in charge of the
king and queen contest, promises that,
unlike all past contests, this one will
be conducted honestly. Tickets will be
printed in denominations of ten, a
hundred, and a thousand votes. One |
cent will entitle anyone to one vote
for the king or queen. Candidates are
urged to lay their platforms immedi
ately.
The committees in charge are as
follows: Decorations, E. L. Barnett
and G. H. Baker, chairmen, 'Jean
Ward, R. P. Myers, L. T. and
J. R. White. Entertainment, J. R.
White, chairman, W. L. Hobro, Eliza
beth Simmons, Mildred Worswiek, D.
M. Oliva, T. J. Grace, R. S. Boren,
and F. N. Tyroler.
L. T. Browne is in charge of the
costumes. He will have them brought
here by the stores and sold on the
campus. Whitmer's orchestra, from the
Cardinal Hotel in Palo Alto, will fur
nish the music.
