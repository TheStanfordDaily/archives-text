# TWO ONE-ACT PEACE PLAYS TO BE GIVEN
## 
### 
Two one-act plays showing the useless
ness and horror of modern war will be
played tomorrow night in the Little
Theater under the auspices of the Y. M.
C. A. The plays "Gas" and "Patriot's"
were presented at the Palo Alto Unitar
ian Hall last quarter. The original casts
made up chiefly of Stanford students will
be seen.
In "Gas" the leads will be taken by
Mildred Hall and Donald Chase. "Gas"
is a story of the frightful possibilities of
the modern weapons of warfare upon
non-combatants.
In "Patriots" Calbot Bielfeldt, George
Gage, Carol Hyde and Carol Davis will
take leading parts. This is an English
play presented originally in that country.
It shows how the true causes of warfare
are to be found in economic causes widely
different from those which the ordinary
citizv... is led to believe are the true cause
for struggle.
The plays are propaganda for peace
and show war stripped of its glamor and
romance in all its frightfulness. The
presentation will be open to the public
without charge. All are invited to attend
the performance.
Dr. Jordan asks that the attention of
the student body should be called to these
plays in view of the constant propaganda
for war by the militarists, and urges that
a large audience be present.
