# BRANDSTEN LOSES SCHMEIDER, CAPTAIN SWIMMING VARSITY
## 
### 
With the national A. A. U. meet at San
Francisco less than a month off, Coach
Erne Brandst'en is getting into shape the
best water polo seven he can muster as
well as preparing the swimmers and divers
for the competition. Captain Schmeider
has been lost to the team by graduation
and one of the problems confronting the
mentor is that of filling the gap in the
lineup made by the veteran's departure.
All events will be on the program which
Avill cover a period of four daysâ€”April
23, 24, 25, and 26. The Fleischacker pool
has been selected as tlfe best on the coast
for the classic where nine teams recog
nized as the leading ones in the country
will swim for national laurels.
A number of unattached men, individual
stars in their events, have entered the
-competition. Arne Borg, whose planned
visit here was postponed, will be among
the stars of the meet. He and Weiss
tnuller of the Illinois Athletic Club will
renew their feud in the middle distance
events and both are expected to lower sev
eral records before the final event has
been swum off.
The most probable man to replace
Schmeider in the lineup is Bob Williams
who has been showing rare form all sea
son. Regular practice in water polo has
not yet been renewed since the return of
the team from their southern trip during
the spring vacation.
