# If They Win, They're Crazy

### 
At the University of California there is a woman's debating society
which is to defend the proposition that women should pay half of the ex
penses incident to keeping an engagement with a young man. And, oddly
enough, the other side of the case will be presented by a men's debating
society. They insist upon grabbing all the checks.
The Daily Califomian editorializes on the subject to the effect that a
great deal of sound sense is to be expected from the women and a quan
tity of vociferous prejudice probably will come from the men. Comments
on the Farm take the other side. Our Cardinal gents think the paying of
bills is great stuff and declaim that these California women have acted in
an outrageous manner by even suggesting the matter.
One prominent local man asserts that it is a privilege to associate with
the women he queens. We know him well enough to reverse his state
ment. It is something of a pleasure to be with him. No amount of figur
ing can alter the 50-50 basis in his case, exceptional as it may be.
Another suggests that part of the responsibility for the party is placed
on the woman when she is required to share the financing. Well ?
One more points out that our gentler escorts are expected to conduct
themselves so that the males may acquire a sense of superiority and pro
tectivity. He suspects, that the women would refuse to dd their share
under a revised system. He considers this, further, undesirable. And
here is the point upon which the debate will probably be fought.
Any woman automobile driver knows to what the male sense of chiv
alry has come. W'omen doing other things on the same basis as men carry
the same report. An acute sense of chivalry needs unfamiliarity to keep
it sharp. Since women will no longer be talked into secluded housekeep
ing as an exclusive occupation and since they, have begun to assume a
more and more equivalent status, the general mysterious awe of woman
hood has become less.
Those who know say that men are, in general, physical superiors. If
enough women ever take a fancy for digging ditches or similar work, even
this may be denied. And with greater competitive equality between the
sexes, the caste difference becomes lesser. A perfect individualism, with
every man and woman merely a person might be the conclusion to this
developing. Which is not at all what the California debaters have in mind.
What the women propose simply isn't natural. Neither man nor
woman would have any sort of a good time on such a basis. It is certain
that in mental torture alone, any man would earn seven times as much as
he saved by the system.
As it is, the women do their share, reciprocating at one time or another.
Not that it makes much difference, for, as somebody has pointed out, when
a man complains about how much it all costs, he is bragging in a thinly dis
guised manner. Any woman will tell you how men enjoy that.
With a tacit understanding in operation, it does seem a bit unnecessary
to debate tlie matter.
And economically! Fighting for the privilege of spending money!
If the dear things uwnt to spend their money, however, the only course
of action for a true gentleman is plain to be seen. In this decadent day
and age men must cooperate to maintain the chivalric code as perfect as
possible. Indulge them.

IT IS REGRETTABLE that at a time when both California and
Stanford are enjoying amicable relations, the boxing feud should rattle
out like the old family skeleton and spoil a perfectly happy beginning.
Evidently it is Stanford's move; University of California authorities
are willing to meet us half-way. —D. C. M.

ing as an exclusive occupation and since they, have begun to assume a
more and more equivalent status, the general mysterious awe of woman
hood has become less.
Those who know say that men are, in general, physical superiors. If
enough women ever take a fancy for digging ditches or similar work, even
this may be denied. And with greater competitive equality between the
sexes, the caste difference becomes lesser. A perfect individualism, with
every man and woman merely a person might be the conclusion to this
developing. Which is not at all what the California debaters have in mind.
What the women propose simply isn't natural. Neither man nor
woman would have any sort of a good time on such a basis. It is certain
that in mental torture alone, any man would earn seven times as much as
he saved by the system.
As it is, the women do their share, reciprocating at one time or another.
Not that it makes much difference, for, as somebody has pointed out, when
a man complains about how much it all costs, he is bragging in a thinly dis
guised manner. Any woman will tell you how men enjoy that.
With a tacit understanding in operation, it does seem a bit unnecessary
to debate tlie matter.
And economically! Fighting for the privilege of spending money!
If the dear things uwnt to spend their money, however, the only course
of action for a true gentleman is plain to be seen. In this decadent day
and age men must cooperate to maintain the chivalric code as perfect as
possible. Indulge them.

IT IS REGRETTABLE that at a time when both California and
Stanford are enjoying amicable relations, the boxing feud should rattle
out like the old family skeleton and spoil a perfectly happy beginning.
Evidently it is Stanford's move; University of California authorities
are willing to meet us half-way. —D. C. M.
At the University of California there is a woman's debating society
which is to defend the proposition that women should pay half of the ex
penses incident to keeping an engagement with a young man. And, oddly
enough, the other side of the case will be presented by a men's debating
society. They insist upon grabbing all the checks.
The Daily Califomian editorializes on the subject to the effect that a
great deal of sound sense is to be expected from the women and a quan
tity of vociferous prejudice probably will come from the men. Comments
on the Farm take the other side. Our Cardinal gents think the paying of
bills is great stuff and declaim that these California women have acted in
an outrageous manner by even suggesting the matter.
One prominent local man asserts that it is a privilege to associate with
the women he queens. We know him well enough to reverse his state
ment. It is something of a pleasure to be with him. No amount of figur
ing can alter the 50-50 basis in his case, exceptional as it may be.
Another suggests that part of the responsibility for the party is placed
on the woman when she is required to share the financing. Well ?
One more points out that our gentler escorts are expected to conduct
themselves so that the males may acquire a sense of superiority and pro
tectivity. He suspects, that the women would refuse to dd their share
under a revised system. He considers this, further, undesirable. And
here is the point upon which the debate will probably be fought.
Any woman automobile driver knows to what the male sense of chiv
alry has come. W'omen doing other things on the same basis as men carry
the same report. An acute sense of chivalry needs unfamiliarity to keep
it sharp. Since women will no longer be talked into secluded housekeep
ing as an exclusive occupation and since they, have begun to assume a
more and more equivalent status, the general mysterious awe of woman
hood has become less.
