♦ v. g. d. e>
"There are smiles that make us
ha-a-a-apy!
There are smiles that make us
blu-u-ou!"
Few things have no changing,
But some it seems never do.
"Smiles," like poison oak, breaks
out every year just about nowy. Are
they "caught" for like reasons? And
are they to become equally irrevo
cable institutions?
NOW THAT you "waste not your hour,
nor in vain pursuit
Of this or that endeavor and dis
pute,"
You know " 'twere better to be jocund
with the fruitful Grape
Than sadden after none, or bitter,
Fruit.
NOW THAT you've discovered the
stuff your professors are made of
"words! words!" how much they
mean; and how little they actually
do
NOW THAT U. S. C. has most
graciously partaken of our barbecue —
AND it storms no more and the yel
low moon arises all too soon
AND the ordeal of Junior Opera
tryouts with its flaming judgment is
upon the Beauty of the campus
Remember that you could "take an
examination on the study of Man and
get A in it," maybe.
Yesterday Professor Hulme said,
"Man can become intoxicated with
work as well as with anything else."
So THAT accounts for it!
And another professor just declared
that he believes us to be "better than
our fathers."
Perhaps Tuesday's editorial was
read by others than the editor and
his staff after all.
