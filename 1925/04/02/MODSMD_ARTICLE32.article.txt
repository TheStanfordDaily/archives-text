# ROOTERS ARE URGED TO SIT IN ONE PLACE
## 
### 
The rally committee urges that all
students sit in the rooters' section at
the track meet with Nebraska next
Saturday. At the U. S. C. meet the
rooting section made a poor showing
because the rooters were scattered.
The side of the stadium on which the
section will be located is the best
from which to see the meet. The 440-
dash, the half-mile, mile, and two
mile runs all finish there, and the pole
vault and broad jump are nearby.
At the meet with California, the
squad of yell leader tryoutees will be
cut to six. From these six the student
body will elect next year's yell lead
ers. Students should watch tryoutees
and become acquainted with them so
as to be able to judge fairly their
relative merits at the coming election.
