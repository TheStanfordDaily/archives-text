# "Y" FRESHMEN TO BE ENTERTAINED HERE
## 
### 
California freshmen women interested
in Y. W. C..A. work will be entertained
on the campus by Stanford Y. W. C. A.
freshmen discussion groups next Saturday.
Luncheon will be served on the banks
of the lake to the visitors. During the
afternoon an Open Forum discussion will
be held to discuss the new plan of organi
zation used by Stanford freshmen this
year.
Until this year the freshmen have been
unorganized, but the discussion group plan
has been so successful that California
freshmen in the Y. W. C. A. have become
interested.
