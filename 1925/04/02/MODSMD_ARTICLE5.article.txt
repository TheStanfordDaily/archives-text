# UNIFORMS AND CIVIES ON EQUAL FOOTING AT MILITARY BALL
## 
### 
Camouflage for the Military Ball will
, hark hack to the days before there was a
j so efficient and long range killing device
I as field artillery, and when gentlemen of
'quality settled differences with bespiked
, cudgels, usually fatally, and the better in
fighter survived. Thus members of the
R. O. T. C. will not receive their custom
ary advantage in airing their knowledge
of modern material by way of entertaining
the fair sex.
The floor will become a medieval court
yard surrounded by frowning "battlements
and towers', which have been designed by
I John Craig, an interior decorator of San
Francisco, and executed by the students of
the R. O. T. C. under his personal super-
I vision. Craig has had wide experience in
this line, having decorated for the Univer
' sity of California sophomore cotillion,
| junior prom, and senior ball last year;
he also assisted for the San Francisco
i Mardi Gras.
The ceiling is a little higher than those
J previously used in the pavilion, is white,
and will be illuminated to represent a
cloudy sky. There will be no glaring or
I ghastly blue lights to ruin complections j
|or dresses. A dress rehearsal of lights i
will be held tonight. The translation into
the Dark Ages will be complete, the com
mittee in charge says, except for the cap
tive princess gazing soulfully through her
prison bars. So far their attempts to en
gage anyone to play this difficult role have
been unsuccessful.
Help on the decorations is needed to
night and all day tomorrow. Members of
the R. O. T. C. are especially requested to |
attend.
Music will be supplied by Art Wcidner's j
twelve-piece Fairmont' hotel orchestra, and :
his soloists will play during intermissions.!
The music will be placed on the north i
side, where a sounding board has been '
erected. Weidner has appeared on the
campus several times, and has gained uni
versal approbation. He promises at least
two numbers that have not heretofore
been heard on the coast.
Programs are being distributed at the 1
Bookstore.
