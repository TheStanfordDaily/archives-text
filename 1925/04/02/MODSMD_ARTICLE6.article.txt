# NEAR EASE EDUCATION DISCUSSED BY DODGE
## 
### 
"The whole hope of tne Near East
countries for future peace and pro
gress lies in the American colleges"
declared Bayard Dodge, president of
the American University of Beirut in
an address in the Little Theatre yes
terday afternoon.
In discussing the subject of "Amer
ica in the Near East," Dodge stressed
the great opportunity that America
has to aid in the constructive develop
ment of these countries of the Near
East. The great task is to teach them
co-operation and unity to the end of
bringing about international peace
and prosperity. All these countries,
notably Turkey, Armenia, Greece, Bul
garia, and Rumania are looking to
America for help in educating the
young people who are to determine
the future of the races.
"The real problem," declared Presi
dent Dodge, "is to give the students of
these Near East colleges a democratic
college life which will not make them
Americans but good citizens of their
own countries, to give them an inter
national viewpoint which alone can
bring about world-wide peace and
prosperity."
That the whole Near East is going
through a Renaissance movement, is
the opinion of President Dodge. These
people are jumping from their old
archaic ideas of those of the twentieth
century, the great danger being in
their going to extremes. The task of
the American educators is to develop
the intellectual life of these people so
as to prevent this tendency.
The American colleges in the Near
East are the American University of
Beirut, Robert College, and Constanti
nople Woman's College. They special
ize in the arts and sciences, com
merce, engineering, and industrial
training. They have the same type of
academic work and demand the same
standards as in American colleges of
high standing.
