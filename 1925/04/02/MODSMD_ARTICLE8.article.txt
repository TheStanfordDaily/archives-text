# RICHARDSON TO ENTER HALF-MILE RACE ONLY FOR CORNHUSRER MEET
## POINTING TO APRIL 18TH May Get Another Chance in Quarter Mile Against Oregon, April 11 
### Douglas Meservey 
Coach R. L. Templcton's star half
miler, Richardson, who showed great
i ability as a 440 man also against U. S. C.
last Saturday, will run only his favorite
! event in the Nebraska meet, April 4â€”the
880.
While it is possible that Richardson is
capable of two races an afternoon, and
the relay if necessary, Templeton believes
j it best not to strain him before the Cali-
I fornia meet. Over-exertion will "point"
j him too soon and Templeton is not run
ning any risk of ruining Stanford chances
for eight points or ten in the Big Meet
through Richardson's performance in the
440 and 880.
Miller will be left to run his race against
Captain Crites and Dailey of the Corn
huskers practically alone, therefore. Bab
cock and Doerr will also be run by 1 em
pleton in the quarter but they will have to
do under 0 :50 to beat either of the Ne
braskans if reports from Lincoln concern
ing the latters' times are correct.
If Richardson does run only the half
this Saturday, Templeton may put him
back into the 440 against Oregon on April
11 and give Miller a rest. That is, if it is
agreeable to both for the chances arc that
Miller will be as eager as ever to run
and Richardson may want to repeat his
performance against U. S. C.
The sprints are about the only weak
events. The pole vault has worried Tem
pleton somewhat up to last week but Sco
field made a little over 12 feet and it is
possible that he will improve to 12 feet 6
inches. In the dashes, however, Gaspar
will have to fight pretty hard for a place.
It is true that he has made 0:10 1-10 in
the hundred as compared with 0:10 1-5 in
the U. S. C. meet but he did not show it
Saturday. On a dryer track, however, he
might again reach that time.
Captain Hartranft, on the other hand,
surprised Cardinal followers by showing I
some of the old form he displayed several j
years ago when he finished second to Tay- j
lor by a strong finish in the century.
Campbell has not been figured in on
predictions in the dashes so far this sea
son, but he may spring a surprise Satur
day since the recent treatments on his
arches.
Charles' showing in the two-mile was
one of the brightest spots of the U. S. C.
meet for Templeton. The former has for
two years been handicapped by one form
of sickness or another and has not been
able to show the speed he really has. His
time was 9:54 2-5 against U. S. C.
