# MANAGER OF GLEE CLUB FOUND LAST NIGHT IN PORTLAND
## 
### 
W. F. Hunkins, manager of the Stan
ford Glee Club, who has been missing
since March 16, was found last night in
Portland, Oregon, according to a tele
gram received by his brother, B. C. Hun
kins, at Stanford.
Hunkins' disappearance the day before
the Stanford Glee Club was scheduled to
start on a tour of southern California is
believed to be due to worry over glee club
affairs and studies.
Hunkins' father, who has been search
ing throughout Oregon and Washington
for the past two weeks, located his son
at a Portland hotel near their former
home. The two are leaving Portland to
night for Stanford University.
