Modes for Easter and
Thereafter
I
With Easter so near, can Spring days be far behind?
Such a delightful season is this that arrives with
Eastertide —when one enjoys sniffing at fresh, bud
ding things; when one directs one's attention to a
new wardrobe; when the home comes in for its share
of general freshening up. Thinking it over, we decide
that the old world is a pretty good place, and decide
to make it better. The Easter service takes on added
meaning. Yes, Easter fully deserves the welcome
we give it.
Dainty little frocks for Easter wear will be found here at a saving.
They are priced as low as $13.75.
Others of finer quality materials in wonderful new styles as high as
$45.00.
The new straight line coats are a charming feature in the parade of
fashions for Easter and later. You will be pleased with the
assortment we have to offer at very moderate prices. From $24.50
to $65.00, in such materials as Basha, Charmeen, and other popular
fabrics of light weight for the warmer days.
New Crepe de Chine blouses for Easter are uncommonly important,
especially when they are hand embroidered and set off with deli
cate pleated frills or with buttons or perhaps just plain—but the
key to their door of fashion is the depth of color and the blending
of beautiful combinations. Moderately priced from $9.00 to $15.00.
One of fashion's newest creations is the ensemble scarf —a scarf that
can be used with or without the fur collar or the fur collar can be
used with any scarf one may choose. The collars are in tan and
gray fur with contrasting scarfs of various colors and designs.
