# UTAH AGGIES WIN DEBATE DECISION AGAINST STANFORD
## Return to Former Quota Is Advocated Instead of Total Exclusion 
### 
N. M. Christensen and P. L. Neil
sen of the Utah Agricultural College
defeated the Stanford team composed
of C. C. Scott and R. R. Bruce, by a
two to one decision in a debate held
in the Little Theatre last evening.
The question was: Resolved, that the
immigration act of 1924 should be so
amended as to admit Japanese on the
same basis as Europeans,
The Utah debaters advanced the
argument, supporting the affirmative,
that the United States should repeal
the act of total exclusion and return
to the "Gentlemen's Agreement" in
force between the two nations since
President Roosevelt's administration
in 1907. The Stanford team advocated
the present law in that peoples of two
races could neither assimilate one an
other nor live side by side without
friction.
Christensen, the first affirmative
speaker, traced briefly the so-called
"'Japanese Question," giving statistics
proving that the actual immigration
•of the Japanese under the "Gentle
men's Agreement" on a basis of 146
a year of the more highly cultured
people of Japan was less than would
be smuggled over the borders under
the present law. In addition, a lower
class as a whole would enter and so
would be more undesirable for assimi
lation. Quotations from President
Coolidge, Secretary Hughes, Dr. David
Starr Jordan, and other prominent men
as to the harmful effects of the exclu
sion law were given. In addition it was
pointed out that the act of Congress
in 1924 had caused the United States
co lose the co-operation and friendship
of Japan, who looked primarily for
recognition and equality.
Scott of the negative stated that the
auestion was one of "race difference,
not race inferiority." To this end it
was shown that America had two dis
tinct policies of immigratfon: the first,
restric rfbn of immigrants from Europe,
who wore, like Americans, Caucasians,
and the second, restriction of Orient
als who, of Mongolian blood, could not
assimilate with those of a distinctly
different race.
Neilson of Utah showed the effects
of the law on the attitude of the Japan
ese nation when an agreement which
they had lived up to was■ deliberately
broken and an accusation thus made
as to the honesty of the Japanese.
The dangers of such a policy were
emphasized.
The question of Chinese immigra
tion and its solution by exclusion was
the answer of the negative as ad
vanced by Bruce, who again empha
sized the fact of racial difference
involved.
A novel method of deciding the de
bate was employed for the first time
on the Stanford campus, with the ex
pressed opinion of a "critic judge," the
vote of a "balance judge," and the
ballot of the audience comprising the
three elements on which the decision
was based.
Dr. Willard M. Smith, coach of de
bating at Mills college, based his de
cision on the superior organization,
evidence, and rebuttal of the affirma
tive speakers, but giving the negative
credit for skillful delivery and argu
ment. Professor Robert C. Crane of
the Political Science department at
Michigan, gave his decision as balance
judge to Utah, while the audinence
voted 44 to 64 for the losing Stanford
team.
The Utah team will debate TJ. S. C.
April 6 on the same question. A sec
ond team has won every debate in a
trip taken in the Middle West and
South, with one more contest with
Louisiana scheduled for the trip.
