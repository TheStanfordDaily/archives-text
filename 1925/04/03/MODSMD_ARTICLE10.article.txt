# STANFORD FRESHMAN TEAMS MEET BRUINS
## Clarence Sypher Chosen to Lead Babe Diamond Men Against Cubs 
### AL Post 
Clarence Sypher, catcher, was elected
by the freshmen baseball squad yesterday
afternoon to serve as captain in the com
ing series with the California first-year
men, the first game of which will be
played at 3 o'clock tomorrow afternoon
in the California memorial stadium.
Sypher played high school ball in Seat
tle, Washington, and was captain of his
nine there. At Stanford he has shown
himself one of the most valuable men on
the squad, and attracted notice even be
fore the start of the regular season when
he caught for the faculty in their game
against the varsity. He is a hard hitter
and works well behind the plate.
Dope Favors Cards
Coach "Husky" Hunt put his charges
through their last practice of the week
yesterday. Coach Harry Wolter of the
varsity was out batting the ball at fielding
practice. Hunt docs not consider the
series a cinch, and the yearlings are not a
bit overconfident, but the dope is over
whelmingly in favor of the Cards. Dur
ing the season they have won seventeen
games and lost two, both on the spring
vacation trip.
"Nibs" Price's cubs are not as power
ful an aggregation as he usually turns
out. They dropped three contests to the
Bruin second varsity, tied Alameda high
school 3 to 3, and lost to San Francisco
Polytechnic high and to Berkeley high.
The Card freshmen trounced Alameda
and Berkeley by substantial scores and
shut out Poly 5 to 0.
Bruin Stars Unknown
Not much information has leaked out
regarding the individual stars in the Bruin
line-up. Price lost three of his best men,
Green, Nemechek, and Thornton, through
ineligibility, whereas Hunt's loss was nil.
Newell, who pitches from the left side, is
said to have considerable stuff on the ball
and may work on the mound tomorrow.
The Stanford coach will select whichever
one of his staff shows up best in warming
up before the game. The rest of the line
up will be the same as that which was
used on the San Joaquin valley trip.
The following men will go to Berkeley:
Captain Sypher, c; Philippi, Reynolds,
Sobieski, p; Clark, Busch, ss; Maguire,
lb; Garibaldi, 2b; Nissen, 3b; Biaggini,
If; Weaver, cf; Sims, rf; Snyde, Adams,
Tloxie, Millage, utility. Coach Hunt and
junior baseball manager E. F. Kurtz will
accompany the squad.
