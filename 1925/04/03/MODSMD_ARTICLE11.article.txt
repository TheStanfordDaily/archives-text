## 
### Jack Beard 
"Dink" Templcton, track mentor, de- j
clares that' Stanford will win in the an- ;
nnal dual track meet between the Cardi
nal and California Babes which is to be
held Saturday at 1:45 p. m. in the Berke
ley oval. "Dink" states that Dave Nichols
who was chosen captain last night, will
lead a yearling squad superior to the vic
torious freshman team of last' year.
Stanford will enter the field with one
of the strongest yearling squads that has
ever sallied forth from the Farm. Al
though the squad lacks brilliant stars,
with the exception of Captain Nichols
and King its strength is imposing and
formidable in almost every event. Nichols,
the outstanding star is doped to win both
hurdles, besides possibly of placing in the
jumps and the pole vault.
The sprints will be hotly contested, with
both Worthington of Stanford and Roeh
rig of California negotiating the hundred
in approximately the same time. Roehrig
is given a slight edge by his flashy time
of 10 1-5 in the century and 22 5-10 in the
220-yard dash. Burton and Bly will also
run the hundred for Stanford.
Nichols, who holds the intercholastic
record for the high hurdles, should win
both hurdle races with ease. Bullis, Bly,
and Dyer may be counted upon to account
for possibly both seconds and thirds in
these events.
In the high jump King of Stanford has
been showing exceptionally well, having
i made as high as 6 feet 3 inches. Karris
also doing well in this event.
Stanford is a strong favorite in the
i broad jump, through the leap of 22 feet
made by Anderson compared with the
best distance as yet shown by the Bear
| men, 20 feet.
Ranney and Collins should have no
! trouble in running off with the mile run.
Nelson and Ranney will run in the two
mile. Prospects in the shotput have
| brightened considerably since the last
j minute eligibility of Windy Bigelow.
