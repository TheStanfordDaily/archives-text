# CORNHUSKER TRACK TEAM ARRIVES FOR MEET Wild CARDS
## Stanford Favored to Defeat Nebraskans Tomorrow; Campbell to Run 
### Douglas Meservey 
Twenty-two Nebraska track men, ac
, companied by Coach "Indian" Schulte
and trainer, arrived in San Francisco
' this morning for their meet with Stan-
I ford'tomorrow at 2:30 in the Stadium.
Entries posted yesterday by Coach
! R. L. Templeton indicate that twenty
five men are entered under the Cardi
nal colors, but three will be dropped
! tomorrow to even the two entry lists.
The Middle-Westerners arrived with
both indoor and outdoor Missouri Val
ley Conference championships in their
| possession but Templeton's team is
predicted to win. The Cornliuskers are
handicapped in the field events and
| have been given only second places in
most track events, indicating that
! Stanford should win by at least thirty
points.
Hartranft in Three Events
Captain Hartranft looms as the high
; point man of the day, being entered
| in three events —shot, discus, and hun
dred. Firsts are conceded him in the
first two and a possible second or
! third in the century. If Campbell's
arches are better than they have been
this season, however, either he or
I Caspar may crowd Hartranft out —
Locke of Nebraska being given first
| place in the hundred through his past
performances of 0:10 flat.
Ted Miller is a last-minute entry in
| the 220 and Richardson in the 440.
| Miller has done 0:22 1-5 in the furlong
and will undoubtedly give both Locke
' and Gaspar a hard race. Templeton is
i still uncertain about Richardson's en
i tering the 440, but has planned to enter
s him with Miller, Doerr, and Babcock in
j the relay. This should insure a first
j in that event and give him some indi
i cation of what may be expected
i against California in the way of time.
It should be around 3:19 if the four
men above mentioned run.
West Out
West, who is not registered this
quarter, will be missed in the hurdles,
as he was capable of following Leist
ner. Wells has been showing consider
able improvement this season, how
ever, and with Dole will give Weir of
Nebraska a close fight. The latter will
be handicapped in several ways by
the change from indoor to outdoor and
Leistner should win both hurdles.
Meeks and Macßae will probably
fight it out for first place in the broad
jump. Rhodes of the Cornhuskers does
around 22 feet but if the Card jumpers
live up to past records they should
both clear 22 feet? 10' inches. Meeks
could probably have done it last week
against U. S. C. if he had been in
practice the entire vacation.
McClellan Returned
McClellan has returned to the cam
pus and is entered in the 880, mile,
and two-mile. He began the season as
a two-miler and has worked down t(?
fair times in the 880, giving promise of
an occasional battle with Swayne in
that event. He has lost two weeks'
training, however, and should be
beaten in any of the three events by
