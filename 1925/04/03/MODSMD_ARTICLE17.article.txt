# TWO ONE-ACT PLAYS WILL BE PRESENTED IN LITTLE THEATRE
## 
### 
Tonight in the Little Theater two one
act plays dealing with causes and preven
! tion of modern war will be presented
under the auspices of the Y. M. C. A. Dr.
David Starr Jordan has endorsed the plays
as valuable in educating for peace. The
same casts who successfully enacted the
; plays in the Unitarian Hall of Palo Alto
will appear tonight. They arc composed
almost entirely of Stanford men and
I women, and were directed by a Stanford
\ student, K. N. Chantry.
The productions arc entitled "Patriots"
; and "Gas," and both take up the subject
! of modern war, though from somewhat
i different angles. "Patriots" the work of
j an English dramatist deals with the true
j causes of international slaughter and
i "Gas" tells something of the horrors of
! the way warfare is conducted especially as
effecting non-combatants.
i Mildred Hall and Donald Chase appear
in "Gas," and George Gagg, Talbot Biel
| fcldt, Carol Hyde, and Carol Davis in
I "Patriots."
The performance will be without charge
i and all are invited to attend.
