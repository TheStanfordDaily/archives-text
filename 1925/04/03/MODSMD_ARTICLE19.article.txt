# Give 'Em the Axe
## 
### 
The Stanford axe, relic of many a hard-fought battle between students
of Stanford and the University of California, will be offered as a per
petual trophy to the winner each year of some Stanford-California con
test, according to a proposal coming from the California campus. There
is little glory in maintaining a trophy in a safety-deposit vault for all but
one day in the year, those fostering the move point out; and they urge the
adoption of some means for reviving the ancient axe tradition.
One doubts whether the revival of this tradition is either possible or
desirable. The proposed measure has not been hailed with any particular
joy by the students of either university, it appears. And it is a pitiful
thing to see a once-flourishing tradition dragged from a peaceful grave
and bustled into a painful and transitory show of life.
It seems unlikely that an attempt to breathe spirit into the axe tradi
tion could accomplish more than this. Like it or not, the hardy rah-rah
spirit of an earlier day has declined. Students of the two universities no
longer take so great an interest in the symbols of a rivalry that no longer
runs to so feverish a pitch. The Big "C"is seldom painted; bonfires are
seldom attacked; battles no longer rage in the dark of the moon at campus
gates.
With a mutual realization of common interests, the traditional enmity
has tended to become a mere formality, used only on special occasions,
like a full-dress coat. Students who blare defiance from rival bleachers
do so in an impersonal manner unknown to the good old days when every
Cal. (Stanford) man was one of those things.
Let us leave the famous axe, relic of a day when blood ran high—and
often —to accumulate dust in the dim atmosphere of a bank vault. To
make it a perpetual trophy, to be gained without impromptu and mortal
combat, is to dishonor a memento of the heroic days.
Would you use the sword of Richard the Lionheart to sharpen pencils
or cut cake? By all means, leave the old axe to the ghosts of the brave
spirits who once fought over it.
Give THEM the axe. * —D. L.
