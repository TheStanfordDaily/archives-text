# Dame Rumor Hath It

### 
Whether the Razz section of the 1926 Quad meets with the approval
of the Administration determines whether a Razz section will appear in
next year's annual, it is said. This section consists mainly of jokes con
cerning living groups, and the criticism has been made that the humor is
unfair and unkind.
Since the beginning of the book, this section has been popular, for it
seems that humor can best be injected into the book through this medium.
But it also seems that this humor must be of such a type that it can elicit
no condemnation from persons in executive positions.
This is expressed by D. D.:
The "razz" section is written to be laughed at —not to be swal
lowed whole." When the latter is done the effect is usually nausea.
Any book, or play, or person becomes most inartistically heavy
without a certain amount of humor. Shakespeare recognized that
fact both in his plays and in the characters of the plays. Any suc
cessful lecturer has his standard "jokes," and certainly the attractive
personality is the one with "a twinkle in its eye."
Why make the Stanford Quad an exception to a proven rule?
It doesn't deserve it—unless American undergraduate sense of
humor is disappearing, which, I believe is not true. —A. W. T.
CAN WE TRUTHFULLY say that football is a more manly sport
than boxing, polo or soccer? Whence this distinction between minor
and major sports came about is unknown. Local popularity of certain
events has something to do with it. Soccer is a major sport at the Univer
sity of Pennsylvania and at other eastern colleges. Tennis is a major sport
at Stanford and it is not at some other places.
Finance through gate receipts is another if not the main cause for this
division. Evolution to minor and major sports is evolution in the wrong
direction. Place winners in intercollegiate sports are entitled to the same
award whether it be a block or circle letter. —M. E. L.
