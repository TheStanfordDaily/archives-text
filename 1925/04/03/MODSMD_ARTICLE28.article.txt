The Editor, Sir:
Certain forms of petty thievery ar«
commonly regarded as a joke until
the misery of the victim is made ap
parent. Such seems to be true of the
stealing of posters and signs, and this
is the cry of justice of one victim of
that particular breach of fair play.
I think if the poster-grabbers knew
the trouble involved in making a
poster when one must proceed as
laboriously as I, they would extend
the spirit of the honor system a bit
beyond the walls of the classroom.
When half a dozen posters disappear
in a single night, it makes one want
to quarrel with somebody.
If posters might only be spared until
the time of the event they advertise,
it would satisfy
Yours, with regrets that complaints
of this kind should appear in a Stan
ford publication. —T.
The Northwestern University will
soon give a circus which consists of
competitive "stunts" by campus or- (
ganizations.

David Bancroft Johnson, founder of
Winthrop College, Rock Hill, S. C., has
the longest record of service of any
American college president. He re
cently finished his 38th year of ser
vice.

University of Tennessee students
each year confer the degree of "Bache
lor of Ugliness" upon the senior who
has done the most for the university
during his undergraduate years, in
