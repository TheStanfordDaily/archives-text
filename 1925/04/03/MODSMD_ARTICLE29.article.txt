# SPORTS OF 1925

### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Basketball, like baseball and football, has its records, its great names, and
its all-star teams. Bill Keenan of the old De Neri five, a professional team in
New York, was probably the greatest center who ever lived. He starred back
in 1912, along with the equally famous Joe Fogarty, and in one game actually
batted a goal from the toss-up. Those old birds played for about $20 a game,
while now two stars of the Celtics are said to receive over $12,000 each for a
season's work.
The Passaic High School team has set a record for continuous victories that
is unparalleled in sport history. Year after year this New Jersey team wins
about thirty games and loses none. In the 1921-22 season they ran up 2293
points to their opponents' 612, their highest score being 145 to 5 against
Williams Preparatory School. George Thompson set an individual scoring
record in that game, getting 69 points. Altogether in that season Thompson
ran up 1,000 points for Passaic, while his team won eight games with scores
of 100 or more.
Out in Missouri they have set a basketball record this year. The tallest
player in the world is there in the person of George Kennedy, who plays on a
business college five in Chillicothe. He is eight feet tall â€”and the baskets are
only ten feet above the floor. Easy, what?
