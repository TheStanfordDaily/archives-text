# Demand for "Jazz" Music Is Increased in Palo Alto By Popularity of Radio
## 
### 
From "Who Takes Care of the Care
taker's Daughter" to "Moonlight and
Roses" over eighty per cent of the
music sold in Palo Alto to Stanford
students is "jazz," and this, according
to local dispensers, is due to the
radio. Hearing a song which strikes
their fancy, is the theory, the fans
*peed to the stores to procure it, and
usually the piece is not classical.
As spring approaches, dreamy and
sentimental subjects, such as "Moon
light and Roses," are in vogue in the
University. "Something new and
snappy" is the demand most often
heard, for campus favorites are not
campus favorites long. â€ž
