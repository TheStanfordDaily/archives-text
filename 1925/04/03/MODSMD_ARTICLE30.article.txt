# WOMEN TO DEBATE WITH CALIFORNIA
## 
### 
The Women's Debating team, which
is to face California, April 7, at Berke
ley, will be composed of Eleanor Dav
idson and Ann Harris, with Marietta
Fay as alternate. The team upholds
the negative of the question, "Re
solved, That the school of thought
represented by H. L. Mencken is harm
ful." Mr. Mencken is one of the editors
of the Amercian Mercury magazine,
whose criticisms of religions, politics,
and American customs have created
much discussion.
A debate on this question will be a
departure from the technical questions
usually debated in the past. Efforts
will be made to actually discuss the
question rather than follow the cus
tom of "splitting hairs" in order to
win a decision. The question will deal
largely with matters of import in
social philosophy, culture, jazz, re
ligion, and family life, thus departing
from subjects of politics or something
of a more exact nature.
The Stanford team will adapt itself
to this style, paying attention to a
complete presentation of facts on
Mencken's policies.
