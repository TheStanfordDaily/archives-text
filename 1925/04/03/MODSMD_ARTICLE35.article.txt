# "POP" WARNER HERE TO TAKE CHARGE OF SPRING GRID WORK
## 
### 
Spring football practice starts Mon
day under the supervision of Coach
"Pop" Warner, who has recently re
turned to Stanford from the East.
"Tiny" Thornhill and Andy Kerr will
assist Warner in the task of teaching
the candidates the fundamentals of
football.
The spring practice season will only
last until May 15, a period of six
weeks.
Although this practice aids in keep
ing the varsity players in condition, its
main object is to teach new men the
proper methods of tackling, blocking,
and clipping. Thornhill will be in
charge of the line men, while Kerr
will instruct the backfleld candidates.
Many of the fundamental plays that
will be used next fall by the varsity
will be given to the men during the

spring practice so that they can take
up the work next September where
they leave off this May. This system
will give the Stanford coaches a big
jump on the other universities on the
coast.
The men signing up for spring foot
ball will be placed on particular teams
and each team will be provided with
their own plays and signals. The last
two weeks of practice will be devoted
to actual games between the elevents.
A number of last year's varsity
players have signed up for the spring
workout. Among these are: Mitchell,
Hunt, Mkidleton, Walker, Greisser,
Swan, Van Hook, Poulson, Simmons,
and Trombetta. Some of the members
of the 1924 squad are now out for
baseball and track, but will don their
football outfits after April 18. Captain
Ernie Nevers will be on the field when
the last baseball contest is over.
Many players from last season's fresh
man eleven will practice as varsity
men for the first time Monday.
