It has been thought that every me
dium for rivalry between Stanford and
California had been exhausted, but the
military ball has developed another.
Major Geary invited certain high
army ofijeers at the San Francisco
Presidio to observe the local battle,
but was informed that they had al
ready accepted a like invitation from
the institution across the bay, which
is also having its military ball tonight.
As a result the Farm will have to do
without silver leaves and stars.
Complimentary tickets which were
sent, to student officers at California
have also been returned with regrets.
Consequently there are eleven addi
tional tickets to the ball which may
be obtained at the door tonight, and
may be reserved by calling George
Baker at Palo Alto 737.
