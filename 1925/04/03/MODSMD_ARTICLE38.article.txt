# DR. HARRISON MADE PHYSICS PROFESSOR
## 
### 
Dr. George R. Harrison, one of the ;
most brilliant students ever graduated
from the Physics department at Stan
j ford, h;\s been appointed assistant pro- 1
feseor in that department, to begin his
j duties next October. He was graduated
in 1919, became master of arts the
next year and doctor of philosophy in j
1922. He was appointed an instructor
in 1920, a position he held until 1923,
when he was awarded a research fel
lowship under the National Research
Council.
Harrison has been carrying on ex
periments under this fellowship since
j that time. The field in which he is
now carrying on investigations is vis
ible and ultraviolet light. Work which
he began at Stanford and continued at
Harvard has been especially valuable
because it involves so much difficulty
in the control of materials of extreme
ly high chemical activity that little
has been done along this line.
