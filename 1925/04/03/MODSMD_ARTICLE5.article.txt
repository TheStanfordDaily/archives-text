# JUNIORS WILL LIMIT PROM TICKET SALE FOR UPPERCLASSMEN
## 
### 
Tickets for the 1926 Junior Prom
will be non-transferable and will go on
sale to members of the Junior Class
on April 14 in the Administration
building, according to D. J. Kropp,
chairman of the ticket committee. Any
bids remaining after the junior sale
will be offered to seniors, graduates,
and holdovers the following day.
The tickets are made non-transfer
able in order that the Prom be as
nearly as possible an upperclass affair.
Transferring will be prevented by re
quiring the purchaser to sign the
ticket at the time it is received and
again when presented for admission
at the pavilion. Last year no such pro
vision was made and a number of
•
freshmen and sophomores secured
bids while many seniors and holdovers
were unable to obtain them.
Construction of additional perma
nent bleachers in the pavilion last
year cut down the dancing space
greatly, making necessary a reduction
in the number of Prom tickets sold.
The erection of more seats was sanc
tioned at an A. S. S. U. election on
the grounds that the pavilion was pri
marily for basketball and that the
amount of available dancing space was
a secondary consideration.
The sales will begin at 11 a.m., on
both days, in order to make it possible
for students having afternoon classes
to purchase their tickets without the
necessity of "cutting." The usual price
of $5 will be charged.
