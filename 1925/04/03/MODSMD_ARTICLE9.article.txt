# Covered Wagon Mystery Still Remains Shrouded At Roble Parking Space
## 
### 
An addition to Roble attractions has
been made in the form of a "covered
wagon" which seems to be parked per
manently in front of the hall.
Apparently it is some sort of vehicle
because four wheels are visible under
its coverings. The rest of whatever it
is is tenderly stowed away under sev
eral varieties of swaddling clothes for
protection from the icy blasts.
If it is a Stanford automobile it
must have died of suffocation under
the blankets. To leave this corpse,
occasionally exposing its members
when the wind blows, so near to self
respecting Fords who brave the rain
uncomplainingly, seems a very indeli
cate act.
