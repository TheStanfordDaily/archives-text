# D.P.A. TO TAKE STRAW BALLOT ON QUESTION OF ATHLETIC AWARDS
## Vote to Ascertain Relative Esteem in Which Campus Holds Sports 
### 
Stricter limitation of the require
ments for earning an "S" athletic
award, and limitation of the number
of sports under the supervision of the
Board of Athletic Control are reforms
which, according to informal reports,
are being considered by the Athletic
department.

Under the proposed new system, it
will be necessary to know in what rela
tive degree of esteem each sport is
held on the campus. For the purpose
of ascertaining this information, the
Daily Palo Alto is taking a straw vote
in which each student is asked to cast
a ballot which will be used only for
statistical purposes.

Some reform, it appears, is going
to be attempted, and one suggestion
has already been offered. It is that all
sports be divided into three classes:
Major, Minor, and Gymnasium. In the
first class, there would be the four
foremost sports; in the second class,
the second four sports; and in tlie
third class would be placed all sports
left after this choice. Men playing on
teams in this last group would not re
ceive awards from the Board of Ath
letic Control, but from the gymnasium
department. All sports would be inter
changeable, and thus a sport in the
last group, if it became popular
enough, might rise to be a major sport.
The suggested system would be
much more flexible than the present
one, under which certain sports are
classified as Major and Minor for an
indefinite period. It would, however,
make more difficult the earning of the
regular "S" award by placing fewer
sports under the Board of Athletic
Control.
The ballot now being taken simply
indicates the present status of the
various sports in the minds of the
students. This will supplement box

office statistics. Votes need not be
cast upon the ballots printed in the
Daily. They will be honored, regard
less, provided only that they are
signed.
