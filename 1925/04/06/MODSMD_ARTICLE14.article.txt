# GENERAL COMMITTEE FOR CHARITY DRIVE TO FORMULATE PLANS
## 
### 
A meeting of the general committee
for the spring Charity Drive 011 the
campus will he held tomorrow to form
ulate plans for canvassing the various
living groups the week of the drive.

The Social Service Board has desig
nated two causes for the drive of the
Convalescent Home and the Students'
Friendship Fund. Under the new sys
tem which limits campus drives to
one each quarter, it is believed that
the student body will be more careful
in its consideration of pleas for finan
cial support. The drive will take place
the week cominancing Monday, April
13.

The Convalescent Home, situated on
the Stanford campus, is at present
caring for 40 children who are here
to regain their health after illness.
Need for keeping up the work being
done by the Home is apparent, and
the committee administering the drive
hopes for 100 per cent aid from the
students for this cause.

The Students Friendship Fund is
primarily for the purpose of giving aid
to less fortunate students in foreign
countries who are still struggling for
an education under extremely poor
conditions. The purpose of the fund is
not to give these people direct finan
cial aid, but to help them to help
themselves. Assisting these people
will not only promote a friendly feel
ing in future leaders, but will be a
direct step in establishing internation
al relations and hence world peace.

Every effort will be made the week
of the drive to promote the drive so
as to make it go "over the top."
