# Y. M. C. A. PRESENTS TWO ONE-ACT PLAYS
## 
### 
Two one-act plays written with the
purpose of showing the folly and
crime of modern warfare were offered
in the Little Theatre last Friday night.
"Patriots," the first, was the work
of an English dramatist, Wilfred Wel
lock, of Birmingham, a lecturer on
peace who hopes to come to this coun
try on a tour next year. The coaching
was by Lloyd Davies and Kenneth
Chantry.
"Gas" was the work of James Pohl
of Brooklyn and pictured "a day that
must never come" when whole cities
would be wiped out by poisonous gases
dropped from airplanes.
On Sunday the plays were presented
at Unity Hall, Berkeley, and next
Wednesday they are to be put on at
Mills College under the auspices of
the Mills College Forum.
