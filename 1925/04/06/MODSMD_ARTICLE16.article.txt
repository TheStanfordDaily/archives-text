# LAKE'S RISE HELPS AQUATIC SPORTSMEN
## 
### 
Farmers are not the only ones benefit
ing from the recent rains, for aquatic
students will no longer have to risk
sprained ankles in descending to the
landing-platform at Lagunita, for the
lake has risen to within a foot of the
boathouse floor.
Now also will the most ambitious high
divers have several feet more of grace
before scooping a mouthful of Lagunita's
higthly-colored and flavored mud.
