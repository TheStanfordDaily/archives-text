# NEBRASKA DEFEATED BY CARD TRACKMEN SATURDAY, 80 TO 50
## Slippery Track Shows Times In Distances, Sprints; Leistner Injured 
### Douglas Meservey 
Coach R. L. Templeton's track ath
| letes won their second intercollegiate
meet of the 1925 season when they
overwhelmed the University of Neb
raska, Saturday, 80 2-3 to 50< 1-3.
The victory was' as predicted but,
j due to the condition of the muddy
| track, the results were not indicative
of the Cards' strength. Templeton had
hoped to gain a little basis for pre
dicting the California meet but will
now have to wait until his men compete
with Oregon, on April 11.
Campbell Improved
Despite the poor quality of general
results, several individual perform
ances against Nebraska were encour
aging. Campbell, who has not been
counted on for places in meets prior
to the one Saturday, due to weak
arches, placed third in the hundred.
This was a surprise to Stanford fol
lowers because he had been in steady
training for only two weeks following
treatment in San Francisco. Photo
graphs of the century finish show also
that he was not straining at the end
of the hundred and on a dry track
might have given both Hartranft and
Locke a fight. Although he did not run
the 220, he will enter that event and
the century against Oregon.
Hartranft High Scorer
Hartranft was high point man of
the meet and may continue as such
throughout the season. Firsts are gen
erally conceded him in the shot and
discus and if he continues improving
in the dashes he will add several
points to the ten gained in the weights.
In two meets he has led the Stanford
dash men and with a faster "start"
will continue to do so.
Gaspar should not be counted out
entirely, however, and may pull up to
Hartranft's form. He struck a soft
spot in the track at the beginning of
