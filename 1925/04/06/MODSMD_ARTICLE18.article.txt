# NEBRASKA DEFEATED BY CARD TRACKMEN SATURDAY, 80 TO 50
## Slippery Track Shows Times In Distances, Sprints; Leistner Injured 
### Douglas Meservey 
Coach R. L. Templeton's track ath
| letes won their second intercollegiate
meet of the 1925 season when they
overwhelmed the University of Neb
raska, Saturday, 80 2-3 to 50< 1-3.
The victory was' as predicted but,
j due to the condition of the muddy
| track, the results were not indicative
of the Cards' strength. Templeton had
hoped to gain a little basis for pre
dicting the California meet but will
now have to wait until his men compete
with Oregon, on April 11.
Campbell Improved
Despite the poor quality of general
results, several individual perform
ances against Nebraska were encour
aging. Campbell, who has not been
counted on for places in meets prior
to the one Saturday, due to weak
arches, placed third in the hundred.
This was a surprise to Stanford fol
lowers because he had been in steady
training for only two weeks following
treatment in San Francisco. Photo
graphs of the century finish show also
that he was not straining at the end
of the hundred and on a dry track
might have given both Hartranft and
Locke a fight. Although he did not run
the 220, he will enter that event and
the century against Oregon.
Hartranft High Scorer
Hartranft was high point man of
the meet and may continue as such
throughout the season. Firsts are gen
erally conceded him in the shot and
discus and if he continues improving
in the dashes he will add several
points to the ten gained in the weights.
In two meets he has led the Stanford
dash men and with a faster "start"
will continue to do so.
Gaspar should not be counted out
entirely, however, and may pull up to
Hartranft's form. He struck a soft
spot in the track at the beginning of
the 220 Saturday and never regained
lost yardage.
Croolcsliank made a good showing
in two events and should be counted
on in the future contests. He tied
Macßae for second in the broad jump
with a distance of 22 feet and although
it was not good compared to usual
distances, was nevertheless fair for
the muddy runway and shows that he
is to be figured with both Meeks and
Macßae. Three broad junipers doing
around 22 feet 10 inches with two
weeks to improve before the Big Meet
means four to six possible points.
Leistner Injured
Leistner's failure to place in the
high hurdles should be qualified by
the fact that it was on a muddy track
which usually makes it a toss-up as to
the winner in such a race. Leistner
also twisted a ligament after the third
hurdle, but the accident was not seri
ous and he will be in good condition
by the end of the week.
Hoffman's return to the University
and his second placeMn the discus with
130 feet gives Templeton a possible
second place in that event for coming
meets. He broke the Stanford-Califor
nia record in that event last year as
a freshman and his showing Saturday,
with but two weeks' work, is encour
aging. With this year, Hartranft's last,
the Card team needs a successor to
the blonde giant and Hoffman's form
and ability indicate that he is the
logical successor, at least in the discus.

Hartranft (S), second; Campbell (S),
third. Time, 0:10-25.

Leistner's failure to place in the
high hurdles should be qualified by
the fact that it was on a muddy track
which usually makes it a toss-up as to
the winner in such a race. Leistner
also twisted a ligament after the third
hurdle, but the accident was not seri
ous and he will be in good condition
by the end of the week.
Hoffman's return to the University
and his second placeMn the discus with
130 feet gives Templeton a possible
second place in that event for coming
meets. He broke the Stanford-Califor
nia record in that event last year as
a freshman and his showing Saturday,
with but two weeks' work, is encour
aging. With this year, Hartranft's last,
the Card team needs a successor to
the blonde giant and Hoffman's form
and ability indicate that he is the
logical successor, at least in the discus.
The results Saturday are as follows:
100-yard dash —Won by Locke (N);
Hartranft (S), second; Campbell (S),
third. Time, 0:10-25.
220-yard dash —Won by Locke (N);
Hein (N), second; Daily (N), third.
Time, 0:23 1-5.

220 low hurdles —Won by Daily (N);
Dole (S), second; Locke (N), third.
Time, 27 2-5 seconds.
Broad jumn—Won by Meeks (S);
Mcßae (S), Crookshanke (S), tied for
second. Distance. 22 feet 3-4 inches.

Coach R. L. Templeton's track ath
| letes won their second intercollegiate
meet of the 1925 season when they
overwhelmed the University of Neb
raska, Saturday, 80 2-3 to 50< 1-3.
The victory was' as predicted but,
j due to the condition of the muddy
| track, the results were not indicative
of the Cards' strength. Templeton had
hoped to gain a little basis for pre
dicting the California meet but will
now have to wait until his men compete
with Oregon, on April 11.
Campbell Improved
Despite the poor quality of general
results, several individual perform
ances against Nebraska were encour
aging. Campbell, who has not been
counted on for places in meets prior
to the one Saturday, due to weak
arches, placed third in the hundred.
This was a surprise to Stanford fol
lowers because he had been in steady
training for only two weeks following
treatment in San Francisco. Photo
graphs of the century finish show also
that he was not straining at the end
of the hundred and on a dry track
might have given both Hartranft and
Locke a fight. Although he did not run
the 220, he will enter that event and
the century against Oregon.
Hartranft High Scorer
Hartranft was high point man of
the meet and may continue as such
throughout the season. Firsts are gen
erally conceded him in the shot and
discus and if he continues improving
in the dashes he will add several
points to the ten gained in the weights.
In two meets he has led the Stanford
dash men and with a faster "start"
will continue to do so.
Gaspar should not be counted out
entirely, however, and may pull up to
Hartranft's form. He struck a soft
spot in the track at the beginning of
the 220 Saturday and never regained
lost yardage.
Croolcsliank made a good showing
in two events and should be counted
on in the future contests. He tied
Macßae for second in the broad jump
with a distance of 22 feet and although
it was not good compared to usual
distances, was nevertheless fair for
the muddy runway and shows that he
is to be figured with both Meeks and
Macßae. Three broad junipers doing
around 22 feet 10 inches with two
weeks to improve before the Big Meet
means four to six possible points.

Coach R. L. Templeton's track ath
| letes won their second intercollegiate
meet of the 1925 season when they
overwhelmed the University of Neb
raska, Saturday, 80 2-3 to 50< 1-3.
The victory was' as predicted but,
j due to the condition of the muddy
| track, the results were not indicative
of the Cards' strength. Templeton had
hoped to gain a little basis for pre
dicting the California meet but will
now have to wait until his men compete
with Oregon, on April 11.
Campbell Improved
Despite the poor quality of general
results, several individual perform
ances against Nebraska were encour
aging. Campbell, who has not been
counted on for places in meets prior
to the one Saturday, due to weak
arches, placed third in the hundred.
This was a surprise to Stanford fol
lowers because he had been in steady
training for only two weeks following
treatment in San Francisco. Photo
graphs of the century finish show also
that he was not straining at the end
of the hundred and on a dry track
might have given both Hartranft and
Locke a fight. Although he did not run
the 220, he will enter that event and
the century against Oregon.
Hartranft High Scorer
Hartranft was high point man of
the meet and may continue as such
throughout the season. Firsts are gen
erally conceded him in the shot and
discus and if he continues improving
in the dashes he will add several
points to the ten gained in the weights.
In two meets he has led the Stanford
dash men and with a faster "start"
will continue to do so.
Gaspar should not be counted out
entirely, however, and may pull up to
Hartranft's form. He struck a soft
spot in the track at the beginning of
the 220 Saturday and never regained
lost yardage.
Croolcsliank made a good showing
in two events and should be counted
on in the future contests. He tied
Macßae for second in the broad jump
with a distance of 22 feet and although
it was not good compared to usual
distances, was nevertheless fair for
the muddy runway and shows that he
is to be figured with both Meeks and
Macßae. Three broad junipers doing
around 22 feet 10 inches with two
weeks to improve before the Big Meet
means four to six possible points.
Leistner Injured
Leistner's failure to place in the
high hurdles should be qualified by
the fact that it was on a muddy track
which usually makes it a toss-up as to
the winner in such a race. Leistner
also twisted a ligament after the third
hurdle, but the accident was not seri
ous and he will be in good condition
by the end of the week.
Hoffman's return to the University
and his second placeMn the discus with
130 feet gives Templeton a possible
second place in that event for coming
meets. He broke the Stanford-Califor
nia record in that event last year as
a freshman and his showing Saturday,
with but two weeks' work, is encour
aging. With this year, Hartranft's last,
the Card team needs a successor to
the blonde giant and Hoffman's form
and ability indicate that he is the
logical successor, at least in the discus.
The results Saturday are as follows:
100-yard dash —Won by Locke (N);
Hartranft (S), second; Campbell (S),
third. Time, 0:10-25.
