I C. A. will be named at a Quad election
1 next Wednesday from 8:30 a. m. to 2:00

| this year because of trips to several con
ferences which the newly elected officers
will make.
Because Helen Lewis, candidate for
president of the Associated Women, is
not registered in the university this quar
ter, it was necessary to choose a sub
-1 stitute candidate. Under the election rules
' this is the woman who received the
largest number of nominations from the
living groups and Mildred Worswick and
Jean Ward had equal number of votes.
Both were also running for the presi
: dency of the W. A. A. and because they
j could not be running for two executive
s positions Mildred Worswick resigned her
1 W. A. A. candidacy to run against Mar
! garet Dietrich for the presidency of the
A. W. S.
The president and president-elect of
the Associated Women leave on Monday,
