# A 						Son of the Stanford Red

### 
A Stanford athlete has made the supreme sacrifice for college athletics.
Three years ago a Cardinal track team needed half a point to tie Cali
fornia in the "Big Meet." Few of the present generation remember those
"dog days" when Stanford was fighting for its very existence in the ath
letic world or that the to tie with the Golden Bears actually
meant that the Cardinal had regained its pre-war footing. Few also re
member that it was Mint Howell's tie for third place that day that provided
the half point.
Howell rose from his sickbed, defied his doctor's orders and, with a
raging fever, went out to the high jumping pits. He summoned all his
courage and strength in three heroic attempts and he won out.
Ever since that day he has been bedridden, fighting a losing fight
agaiiist tuberculosis. Saturday night he died.
There is stark tragedy in Mint Howell's case, tragedy not only for the
splendid, courageous Howell, but tragedy for Stanford University. A
college generation has come and gone, track meets and football games
have taken place and our magnificent, smooth-working athletic machine
has rolled on, ever gathering momentum. Athletes whose names are on
our lips yesterday and today are gone tomorrow, forgotten.
Some day Stanford will have a Hall of Fame for Sons of the Red who
have brought glory to the University and to themselves.
Mint Howell's name will top the list! â€”N. E. J.
