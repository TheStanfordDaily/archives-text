# Athletic Reclassification

"If the entire output of the Kimberley diamond mines were placed on
the market, the value of the gem would drop to about that of cut glass.
Sweater athletic awards compare to jewels in the minds of the Stanford
student. These awards are now becoming more and more easy to get. Be
fore their value is destroyed, let us reorganize the machinery for granting
them so that the number shall be distinctly fewer."
This is the attitude of those agitating a decrease in the number of block
and circle "S" insignias. The reform propositions do not intend to let
lesser sports go unrecognized. Medals are suggested for competitors in
games which attract the least attention. But to preserve the distinction
of the "S" a great many students are favoring a more stringent set of
rules controlling the granting of major awards. Fewer recognitions in
fewer sports is the burden of the proposal.
There are counter propositions which have not yet been so well organ
ized. They shall be presented later. In all schemes the relative import
ance of various sports is considered. The Daily takes but one stand and
that is: whatever the plan, let it be submitted to the students for approval.
Since the classification of sports is vital to every reorganization advanced,
this popular balloting is being conducted. It is important to fill out the
entire list in order that the results will be worth while.
It is possible that this vote may influence the choice of the four major
and minor sports, should this plan go through. Tennis may retain its
place as a major sport at the expense of football, basketball, track or base
ball. Polo might find itself relegated to the gymnasium department with
some other sport in the minor category.
Complete campus cooperation is necessary.
