On the other side of the controversy over the Glee Club's selective
ability we have considerable vehemence. It is an 'interesting topic, for the
fundamentals of such a dispute as this underlie the questions of sensa
tional journalism, drama, art and all other subjects with the slightest
didactic possibilities.
Self-respecting performance surely should consider its own lights. On
the other hand, something more than instruction is owed to audiences and

tour was as much of a success as ever, and as well received. The
selection of songs was, if anything, better than heretofore.

thereby criticising the material used for entertainment by the club
is an example of the all too prevalent "snap judgments" either of
very young or inferior minds. "Praise from inferior minds is in
sulting. Condemnation from inferior minds is comic."
Opinions are the easiest things in the world to form. But when
they are printed by uninformed persons and read by an uninformed
public they are very likely to "start something." Before becoming
vehement why not be sure of the facts in the case?
