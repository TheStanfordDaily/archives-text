(The following verse is dedicated
with kindest regards to the chairman
of the Junior Prom Ticket Commitee):
Annie Oakley
I sing of Annie Oakley,
May I often hear her name!
Others may attract me,
But I'll love her just the same.
She's not much to look upon.
She's sallow-cheeked and thin,
But she has a heart of silver,
And she always gets me in.
We go to shows and dances,
To movies and to plays,
And as the woman always,
Sweet Annie Oakley pays.

Cabbages has often wondered (and
is still diligently seeking to discover
by experience) whether it is a good
line that lands the poor fish, or
whether a hair-net expertly managed
will turn the trick. —F. H.
