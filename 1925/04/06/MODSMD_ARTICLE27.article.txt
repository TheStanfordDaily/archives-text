### 
Introducing:
Mrs. Fanie McCubbin.
Mr. Thermos B. McCubbin (B stand
ing for bottle).
Cortez McCubbin the fifth (called
"Quart" for short).
Scene; What the McCubbins laugh
ingly call their living room.
Time: Shortly following the night
before.
Mrs. McCubbin — And Harold, it
wouldn't have been so bad to have
had your father doing all those ridi
culous things last night if you hadn't
applauded each antic by saying,
"That's my father."
Harold—Well, mother, he is, isn't
he? (Throwing himself on his knees).
Don't deny it, mother, it would break
Harold's heart.
Mrs. McCubbin—(Strikes an anxious
pose. Her attitude is not strained, how
ever, as she fully realizes that she
will have to maintain it until Wednes
day).
