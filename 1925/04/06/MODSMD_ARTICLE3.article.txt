# Little Lady, Old Boy To Do Specialty Act
## 
### 
Tomorrow morning the Little Widow
from Cornell joins hands with the Old
Boy in appearing in a specialty number
on the Quad. The regular price of 30
cents will lie the admission charge, and
the act will probably l)e for a limited en
gagement, as only 400 copies of the over
size book will be placed on sale.

The Chappies have been unable to
restrain their pride in the issue, which
is the largest of the year and eclipses
the Big Game number. The best campus
talent has been combed for material
worthy of the occasion, while on the
other side of the continent the Cornell
humorists have bent all their efforts to
do honor to Chaparral.

Nine full pages have been contributed
by the Little Lady, while Chaparral has
done ten, so that the editors say, "The
result is stupendous!"
