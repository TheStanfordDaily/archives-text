### 
"Comparison of tlie findings of the
physical examinations with the tabulated
results of the army tests taken at the
time of the World War show that the
Stanford men are well above the average
of the general population," is the sum
mary of this month's article on "Impor
tant Phases of Student Life in Health
and Recreation Program" in "Concern
ing Stanford," the University monthly
information bulletin.

"Although height and weight are not
definite indications of health, it is in
teresting that our students average over
one inch more in height and over three
pounds more in weight than the men
examined for the draft," declares the
bulletin. "It is evident that the men at
Stanford represent a selected group phy
sically as well as intellectually.
"Each man loses on an average less

than one day a quarter on account of
illness, and the time lost in the hospital
for more serious illnesses is only an
average of six-tenths of a day per man
for the whole academic year. The annual
admission rate of men to the hospital is
oidy 208 per thousand.

"Interest in sport and exercise rather
than compulsion and formal work is the
forse that leads four out of five Stanford
men to use the athletic plant. Some in
teresting results of the entrance health
examinations have been tabulated. About
sixteen per cent of the men entering each
year have defective vision of which they
are ignorant. Heart trouble has been
found in less than one per cent of the
men examined."
