# INTRAMURAL SERIES OPENS TODAY WITH FOUR BALL GAMES
## 
### 
C. W. Davis, director of intramural
athletics, Friday issued the complete
schedule of games for the intramurar
baseball leagues. The series begin to
day with four games and will last
until May 8.
With the schedule was announced
the rules for the games and teams in
the seven leagues. The championship
will, like the basketball series, be de
termined on a percentage basis. A
team failing to appear will forfeit the
game and if both teams for a sche
duled game fail to appear they will
both be declared losers on the per
centage basis.
Men dropped from varsity or fresh
man squads are eligible for the intra
mural games. Coaches of the freshman
and varsity teams after each cut on
their squad will post a list of the men,
ineligible to play on an intramural
team. The men whose names appear
on the final list cannot play intramural
baseball if either of the regular sea
sons should end before the intramural
season is over.
Seven men will constitute a team
and a man who starts out on one
team shall continue on that team for
the rest of the season. Managers of
the intramural teams are urged to see
that they have the full quota of play
ers and that their eligibility under
this rule is unquestioned.

All games will start promptly at
4:15 on the various diamonds desig
nated in the schedule.
