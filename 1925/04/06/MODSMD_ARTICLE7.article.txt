# REUNIONS SCHEDULED FOR UNIVERSITY DAY
## Barbecue, Revue, and Dance Planned by Committee For Occasion 
### 
The General Committee for University
Day met yesterday afternoon at 3 o'clock
in the New Union. Plans for the day
were discussed and reports received from
the various committees by Daniel W.
Evans, chairman. Numerous affairs have
been planned for the alumni so that their
visit here promises to be an eventful one.
Reunion banquets are scheduled for
Friday evening. These will include the
Law Association, English Club, and Cap
and Gown dinners as well as class re
unions. Two of the classes, '95 and '00,
will assemble at the president's home and
the remaining five, 'OS, '10, '15, '20, and
'23, are to banquet at the Union. The
Toyon Club smoker is also on the pro
gram for Friday evening.
Saturday morning the alumni will have
the opportunity of attending varsity ten
nis matches at 10 o'clock and a polo game
at 10:30. Tfiese will be followed in the
afternoon by the Stanford-California
track meet at 1:30 and baseball game at
3:30. Between 5:30 and 6:30, after the
game and before the barbecue, fraternity
and sorority houses as well as the halls
will be open to the alumni.
The barbecue, which begins at 6:30,
will be held on the shore of the lake.
It was decided not to have an alumni
show or speaking of any kind, but to
let music take the place of these. The
glee club is to be in evidence as well as
the band, which will probably be located
at the boathouse. It is hoped that tenta
tive plans for a pageant or spectacle on
the lake will mature.
The student show which is to follow
the barbecue is to be staged in the As
sembly hall at 8 o'clock and not at the
pavilion as originally planned. Since seats
will not be reserved a special section is
to be roped off for the alumni ImtMe
diately following the performance, which
consists of four acts, a dance will be held
in the pavilion.
Dr. Gardner has arranged special ser
vices for Sunday morning.
Heads of the committees will meet
again at 7:30 p. m. in the New Union

The General Committee for University
Day met yesterday afternoon at 3 o'clock
in the New Union. Plans for the day
were discussed and reports received from
the various committees by Daniel W.
Evans, chairman. Numerous affairs have
been planned for the alumni so that their
visit here promises to be an eventful one.
Reunion banquets are scheduled for
Friday evening. These will include the
Law Association, English Club, and Cap
and Gown dinners as well as class re
unions. Two of the classes, '95 and '00,
will assemble at the president's home and
the remaining five, 'OS, '10, '15, '20, and
'23, are to banquet at the Union. The
Toyon Club smoker is also on the pro
gram for Friday evening.
Saturday morning the alumni will have
the opportunity of attending varsity ten
nis matches at 10 o'clock and a polo game
at 10:30. Tfiese will be followed in the
afternoon by the Stanford-California
track meet at 1:30 and baseball game at
3:30. Between 5:30 and 6:30, after the
game and before the barbecue, fraternity
and sorority houses as well as the halls
will be open to the alumni.
The barbecue, which begins at 6:30,
will be held on the shore of the lake.
It was decided not to have an alumni
show or speaking of any kind, but to
let music take the place of these. The
glee club is to be in evidence as well as
the band, which will probably be located
at the boathouse. It is hoped that tenta
tive plans for a pageant or spectacle on
the lake will mature.
The student show which is to follow
the barbecue is to be staged in the As
sembly hall at 8 o'clock and not at the
pavilion as originally planned. Since seats
will not be reserved a special section is
to be roped off for the alumni ImtMe
diately following the performance, which
consists of four acts, a dance will be held
in the pavilion.
Dr. Gardner has arranged special ser
vices for Sunday morning.
Heads of the committees will meet
again at 7:30 p. m. in the New Union
on Wednesday evening, April 15, to make
final arrangements.
