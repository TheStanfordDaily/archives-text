# COLLEGE STORY TO APPEAR THIS WEEK
## 
### 
The first installment of "The Skipper
Skips," a short story by T. E. Com
molly Jr., will be published in tomorrow's
issue of the Daily Palo Alto. The story
will be run in four parts and the con
cluding chapter appears on Friday of this
week.

"The Skipper Skips" is a college ro
mance in which Skipper Mowen, a foot
ball hero, and Valentine Nierle, the
wealthy co-ed, are supposed to be deeply
in love with each other, but the youth
of today is very deceiving.

Connolly wrote the yarn for Miss
Mierrielees' short story course last quar
ter. He handles the plot well and his use
of collegiate expressions makes the story
of particular interest to college students.
