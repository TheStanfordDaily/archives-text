WHY do 80% of the people live in wooden houses when they
know that wood won't last as long as stone? Because man
likes change of environment and the most economical means of
change lies in shrewd building. For the cost of one stone house,
three wooden houses could be built, thereby enabling three changes
for the price of one.
Why not apply this to your wardrobe? Why buy expensive imported
fabrics in a suit when you can get the same style, cut, and quality in
domestic products? Why pay $80.00 for a suit when you can get
two for the same price with the same cut and style in a domestic
fabric ?
The answer to the question lies with you. If you are a man of
moderate means who desires style in clothes, the obvious answer is,
"Why should I pay $80.00 for a suit of clothes when I can get two
suits for the same price which will give me both style and longer
i"
wear!
For the past ten years we have made it our policy to study values in
clothing for Stanford men that we may offer them advice in solving
their clothing problems.
