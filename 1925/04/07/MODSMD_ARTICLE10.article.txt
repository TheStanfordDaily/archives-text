# "ACE HIGH" RELEASED AS TITLE OF OPERA
## Marjorie Allen and Fenton Barrett to Have Leads; All Parts Chosen 
### Herbert Klein 
With a chorus of queens and some
brand-new tricks it's in the cards that
"Ace-High," as the Junior Operji has
been officially titled, will draw a full
house. The cast selections, finished
last night, show one of the most prom
ising group of actors, singers, and
dancers gotten together for any cam
pus musical production. New faces
will be seen and new voices heard in
the opera.
The part of Collins Mcßaine, dash
ing aviator and ace of hearts, is being
taken by Fenton Barrett, a freshman,
known only before in the role of Mal
colm in "Macbeth." Opposite him as
Gale Windish, the heroine, is Mar
jorie Allen with a wealth of experi
ence in "You and I," "Captain Apple
jack," "Milestones," and last year's
Junior Opera. The absent-minded Pro
fessor Windish and his long-suffering
wife will be characterized by John
Truman, the witch of the Ram's Head
play, and Patrice Nauman. Truman
Dawes will be Senor Moreno, the slick
Spaniard, Velma Randall, one of the
best-known campus comediennes, is
"Catha."
Competition was keen for many of
the parts, but the ones picked had the
edge over the rest. Practice for chor
uss and cast will start immediately
and be held steadily till the opera is
produced.
Fred Tyroler, musical director of
the show, says a large number of
songs have been submitted to him in
the last couple of clays, making over
forty from which to select the hits.
The beauty chorus picked is going
to be a sensation, according to the
directors. Airplanes will be prominent
ly featured and the hero will rein up
his trusty steed as he dashes in by
shutting off the propellor, for be it
known that Collins Mcßlaine is an
aviator of talent and a high flyer as
well as a perfect lover.
