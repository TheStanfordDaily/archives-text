# Freshmen Dance Tonight At First Spring Jolly-Up.
## 
### 
Members of the freshman class will
meet tonight at Rohle for the first
"jolly-up" party of the quarter. Dancing
to music furnished by the Cardinal or
chestra will be the main diversion of the
evening.
It was previously announced that
twenty-five cents admission would be
charged, but the committee has decided
to make this affair like the previous
ones and allow the freshmen to dance j
free of charge.
