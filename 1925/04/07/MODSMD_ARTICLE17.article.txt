# FRESHMEN MEET CAL BABES ill BERKELEY STADIUM TOMORROW
## Ross Nichols, Captain, Looms As High Point Man in Freshman Events 
### 
'I he Stanford freshmen track team
goes to Berkeley tomorrow afternoon to
meet the Bear cubs in their own lair. All
indications point to a close meet with a
little more red on the scoreboard than
blue and gold. The first event will start
at 3:30 sharp on the California oval.
Ross Nichols is captain and the out
standing star for the Cardinal babes.
Nichols, who was interscholastic hurdle
champion in high school, is expected to
take both of the hurdle events. He may
also win the pole vault from his own
teammate, Carlsmith. Both vaulters are
capable of better than 11 feet 6 inches.
Coach Templeton has developed a fine
array of quarter-milers. Afiramson, Mc-
Guire, McCall, and Boardon all % run
53 at, with Abramson a little the best of
the four. Talbot of California will fur
nish the Stanford 440 men some real
competition. With these four men,
Stanford should easily cop the relay race.
Stanford's best sprinter is Worthing
ton, who is running the 100 in 10:3 and
the 220 in 22:3. Burton, Bly, and Sals
man will be Worthington's teammates
tomorrow in the dashes. Bly also will
compete in the low hurdle event along
with Nichols and Bulles.
The mile and two-mile runs will be
taken care of by Raney. Raney covers
the mile, distance in four minutes and
forty-ve seconds, but the two-mile race
is a new one for him. Nelson will enter
the eight-lap grind, too. Collins is the
best bet in the 880. although he will run
the mile before entering the half-mile.
Smith and Reasnor are Stanford's other
freshmen 880 men.
The dope shows Stanford the big
favorite in the jumps. King has cleared
the bar at 6 feet 3 inches already this
year in the high jump, while Anderson
i sdoing better than 22 feet in the broad
jump. Salsman is a good second to An
derson. Karris the freshmen's other
entry in the high jump.
The weight events may be considered
the weakest events for the Cardinal
yearlings, but both Stanley and Joaquin
are throwing the javelin over 160 feet,
which is almost varsity distance. Bigc
low, Helmke, and Kenaston are the out
standing men in the shot and discus.
The meet as a whole should be inter
esting, and will throw some light on
Stanforr track varsity in the future.
