# CARDINAL SWIMMERS TRAIN FOR COMING NATIONAL EVENTS
## 
### 
Stanford entries in the P. A. A.
national swimming championships at
San Francisco, April 23 to 26, will be
limited mainly to the water polo event,
while only half a dozen swimmers and
divers wearing the Cardinal will com
pete.
Brandsten is centering his attention
on the water polo team in the daily
practices in the Encina pool. Last
night he sent his freshman and var
sity sqnads, both winners over Cali
fornia, through a stiff practice game.
Several of the mainstays of the var
sity squad were absent but able sub
stitutes who will furnish the strength
of next year's team were in the lineup.
Attention is being paid by the Card
inal mentor to condition as he believes
that under the stress of the competi
tion in the national meet they will
exceed the best efforts they have
shown thus far. Collett and Carson,
veterans in the water polo game, will
see their second national contest this
year. Collett is playing in fine form
and promises to be one of the sensa
tions of the meet with his playing at
the goal guard position.
McAllister, Meyers, and Allen form
the bulk of the experienced material
upon which Brundsten is drawing for
his bid in the championship. Williams
has supplanted Schmeider and will
most likely see action from the very
start.
If Ed Luster, freshman flash, is eligi
ble, Brandsten may use him at some
time during the series.
Teams of national repute will be on
hand for the events in the Fleishacker
pool. The Illinois Athletic Club, which
ranks as one of the foremost con
tenders for the national title, is send
ing a complete swimming and water
polo team, both of which will train
on the Stanford campus. They are ex
pected to arive on April 12 or 13.
Johnny Weissmuller, who is wearing
I. A. C. colors, will train with his fore
most rival, Arne Borg, of Sweden, in
the Encina pool. Borg has been as
sociating with the I. A. C.for some
time though he will not swim under
their colors in the meet.
Other organizations which will at
tend the meet are the New York Ath
letic Club, Detroit Athletic Club, Chi
cago Athletic Association, and the
Hollywood Athletic Club, while several
universities are sending teams. The
University of California will enter its
full team.
Brandsten will enter only one swim
mer in the races for national honors.
Carl Stevenson will probably swim
the 100-yard free style. Allen, expert
in the back stroke event at the same
distance, will play on the water polo
team instead of raring.
Four divers are training for the
events and Brandsten may send all of
them to the meet. Dave Fall heads the
list witli Mike Gibbons right behind.
Ogden, whose sensational plunging
in the Stanford-California swimming
meet resulted in a new record, will be
sent with the team. The big fellow
lowered the Pacific Coast record in
his efforts and in practice has been
going as well as ever. Brandsten en
tertains several hopes of having Ogden
place.
