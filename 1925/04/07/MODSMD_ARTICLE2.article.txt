# FRESHMAN TENNIS SQUAD MEETS BRUIN BABE RACQUET MEN
## 
### 
Tennis matches between the Stanford
•and California freshmen will be held
.at 9 o'clock Saturday morning on the
varsity courts. The Stanford team will
be Herrington, Thomas, and McElvenny
playing first, second, and third singles,
and two teams composed of Herrington
and Thomas, and McElvenny and Cas
tellaties paying first and second doubles.
California will be represented by Heil
bron, Rhodes, and Sissoti, and a fourth
man yet to be named. The Cub team
present an imposing record, having de
feated Berkeley High School, Piedmont
High School, Lowell High School, and
St. Mary's Prefiartory School.. They will
be weakened considerably, however, by
the loss of Harrison and Risso, formerly
ranking first and second.
The strength of the Stanford fresh
men is practically untested. They have
defeated Palo Alto High School, and
Polytechnic High School of San Fran
cisco, these being the only matches they
have played as a team. The match sched
uled for last Saturday with Lowell High
School was canceled because of rain.
Herrington is national sixth ranking
junior, a winner of numerous cups and
titles in state junior tournaments, and
formerly captain of the Hollywood High
School tennis team. Thomas was run
ner-up to Fairchild in the fall open sin
gles tournament, and has been one of
the leading high school players in south
ern California for the past two years.
McElvenny is joint holder of the inter
mountain doubles championship and rep
resented that section in the national open
tournament last year. Castellanos was
captain and first man 'for Harvard
School, Los Angeles, last year. He has
won his place on the team through a
•demonstraion of consistently good tennis
throughout the year.
At a meeting of the frosh tennis team
last night Alan Herrington, ranking
freshman star, was unanimously elected
captain of the tennis squad.
Herrington is a nationally known ten
nis player, having been ranked among
the first ten junior aces of the country
for the last two years. A year ago he
won the southern California junior cham
pionship and since then he has added
several other important titles to his col
lection. His wide experience and good
general knowledge of the game should
materially aid him to lead his team to
victory in the matches with California
this Saturday.
