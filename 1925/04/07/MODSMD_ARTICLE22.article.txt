# Women's Suffrage
## 
### 
With offices in three branches of activity: Women's Council, Women's
Athletic Association, and Y. W. C. A. to be voted on between 8:30 and 2
o'clock tomorrow on Quad, the 500 should feel enough interest in at least
one of the activities to break.,the usual record of a two-thirds attendance,
and turn out for a 100 per cent vote.
Now that women "have the vote" and are enabled to take part in gov
ernment on the campus, they have the opportunity of determining what
candidates will best be able to establish the system they most desire. Vot
ing tomorrow is a way of rectifying student affairs and influencing politics
more effectively than spending time in the usual denunciatory orations
indulged in after elections. To have a community of women who feel per
sonally responsible for the politics and affairs which affect their welfare
and government is to have a Utopia in which all manner of progress is
possible. â€”B. F.
