University Day is drawing near. It is up to the present Stanford to
show the old Stanford how change may work for the better. Improved
sleeping and eating accommodations, better laboratories, evidences of con
centrated effort are all things to be proud of. The alumni will be our
guests, and as our guests they will have a right to expect something in the
order of a show. They will get it. They always have.
But while the confetti is falling in storms, while the music is playing,
and while the spirit of festival is ebullient in the minds of the Stanford
student body, it would be well to remember why these "old timers" come
back. They come back because there is something connected with their
memories of college which they hope to find when they return, if only as
visitors.
Except for the faculty, they have no friends here except in the abstract
sense. They are strangers. They may find friendliness, but they cannot
find friends, unless —and this is the point—friends go to meet them. The
initiative is with the students of the University. The festival is hollow
without the true spirit of friendliness behind it. —W. S.
