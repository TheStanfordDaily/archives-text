While a handful of rooters sat through a drizzling rain watching Coach
Templeton's tracksters slipping, ploughing, and splashing through a track
meet with Nebraska last Saturday Stanford's chances for sending a team
to the I. C. A. A. A. A. in Philadelphia on May 30 were slipping as slowly
and steadily as the rain was falling.
The Board of Athletic Control lost approximately $5,000 on the Stan
ford-Nebraska affair. Things had been figured out pretty closely, and
the gate receipts were calculated to pay the guarantee to the Nebraska
team and other incidentals. When old J up. Pluvius kept most of the
rooters at home the financial schemes of the Board of Athletic Control
went fiooey.
Everything on the budget has been appropriated, and since the
braska loss, the only way out is to call off plans for sending the team east.
As matters now stand, the Card tracksters will find all of their opposition
nearer to home, unless some unknown Godfather donates enough money,
or unless the board can borrow to pay the expenses of a team to Philadel
phia. This seems extremely unlikely considering that tlwit group is al
ready $638,000 in debt and cannot easily incur additional liability for un
essentials.
So, it seems that Stanford will have to content itself with entering the
Drake relays on April 25 and the Pacific Coast Conference meet on May
30, the same day as the I. C. A. A. A. A. —W. W. K.
