# THE 						LAW STEPS

V. Q. D,

It has been interesting to watch
women don mannish shirtß while the
men wear lavender sweaters —inter-
esting, and to be smiled at.
But when they begin squabbling
with the men for the dinner check it
is time either to laugh uproariously,
or for the few girls left who have lace
handkerchiefs to shed despairing
tears in them —Stanford chivalry to
the contrary notwithstanding.
Isn't it strange that all the men who
talk of "the crudeness of Western
colleges," and of the "conventionality"
and general "higher standard" of the
East have never been nearer the land
of the rising sun than Glacier Point?
A "twenty-track mind" like Henry
Ford's may be an excellent posses
sion; but, alas, the "omnibus heart!"
A line of Joyce Kilmer's:
"He never made —but was —success"
is a * keen observation; except that
ther are so few who will believe any
thing else about themselves.
And now they want to sue the Jani
tors Service Company because a jani
tor "borrowed without returning" cer
tain and sundry articles from Branner
hall.
May we be permitted to exclaim,
"Lord!" if this same principle were
applied to college and university fac
ulties.
