# THE 						AISLE SEAT

### 
A sewer-rat who is "indeed a very re
markable fellow," having a preposterous
faith in himself and being ambitious for
three things— to be promoted to the posi
tion of street cleaner, to marry a woman
with yellow hair, and to make a grand
tour of Paris in a taxicab and have the
money to pay for it'.
A woman of the street, without hope,
or faith, or love. A woman with a past
spent in bondage—no future and no am
bition for a future.
That in three acts —and Helen Menken
—is John Golden's "7th Heaven." The
author has made a fairy tale out' of the
most sordidly realistic situation. The
woman befcomes inspired with the idea of
bravery and self-determination, and after
that it seems to be easy. The author uses
the recent war as a means of complicating
the situation in the second act, and
strangely enough the hero and all his
friends return alive from the thickest of
the fighting—somewhat battered some of
them, but all of them alive nevertheless.
After having seen the play, one cannot
help but feel that the management must
have greatly influenced the third act. For
some reason it is never quite satisfying to
make up one's mind in the first act that
one is about to witness a tragedy, and then
have everything turn out beautifully, with
nobody dead, and everybody happy.
The "7th Heaven" is remarkably well cast
and there are some splendid bits of acting,
particularly in the first act. The life in
the slums that is so emphasized, does not
seem overdone. Above all else, Helen
Menken predominates the play and her
personality is felt at every turn.
