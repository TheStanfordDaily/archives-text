Achieving the striking combination
of a play in which all the characters
are dead, and a plot which permits
comedy without incongruity, Sutton
Vane has created a powerful drama.
Forrest Stanley, in the leading role,
gives a lifelike picture of the habitual
drunkard who is the central figure in
the group of people of widely different
social standing.
In the leveling process which de
mands an acceptance of death, the ac
tion exposes the innermost souls of
the characters, and still succeeds in

portraying their traits with delight
fully ironic humor.
The gripping situation before the
final examination for the sentence of
eternity is well acted, and in this, as
well as in the whole performance, the
members of the supporting cast give
convincing pictures.
Max Pollock as the boatman who
conducts the party to their destiny
has the degree of calm proper for one
who is "used to death." "The exam
iner," played by Gus P. Thomas, is a
startling and relieving conception of
the greatly feared character who
metes out the final verdict. —B. F.
