### T. E. CONNOLLY, JR. (Great Britain Rights Reserved 
Skipper Mowen began removing all
the apparel from the top drawer of his
dresser and shoving it into the one
below. "Where in the devil are my
studs?" he asked his roommate.
"In the box where you usually keep
them, I suppose," replied Buz Brock
way without looking up from his type
writer or breaking the steady, almost
musical beat of his fingers.
"No," objected Skipper, "I took 'em
outa there this morning."
"Go borrow Jack's," suggested Buz,
still intent upon his work.
"Hell, no! Jack's aren't pearl."
"Well, that won't kill you. You've
done worse than that before and got
away with it."
"I know, but tonight's different. This
is the night, you know." Skipper re
versed the previous process and an
assortment of ties, socks, and shirts
went into the upper drawer like so
much chaff.
"Going to desert Val this time for
sure," laughed Buz as he added the
finishing period to his work.
Skipper viciously attacked the third
drawer. "I mean it this time."
"Old stuff! When are you going to
shave ?"
"As soon as I find these damn studs."
Skipper directed his attention to the
box on top of the dresser. "Hell! Here
they are," he said in disgust.
"Told you so. Val's got you so wor
ried that your memory's on the fritz.
For the last time, before I lose my
temper, when are you going to shave?"
"Yesterday afternoon! What differ
ence does it make to you? Guess I can
shave myself."
"Well," smiled Buz, "I'm queening
tonight, myself.
"Who?"
"Grace Collins."
"Getting pretty steady, isn't it?" in
quired Skipper.
"Not so bad that I'm worried about
getting rid of her as you are about
Val. If I had a girl as "
"Equally old stuff. Why don't you?"
interupted Skipper.
"I am as soon as I can," was the
answer.
"Bunk!" was Skipper's only com
ment.
"If I had your looks and reputation,
I'd have a ring on her finger already,"
insisted Buz.

Skipper smiled through a sticky coat
of Palmolive. "Looks haven't anything
to do with It. A rep helps, but it's the
way you talk that does the trick."
"You must have some line, then.
You went with Grace a little before
you introduced her to me, didn't you?"
"Yeah." Skipper began using his
shaving brush. "She's not so bad. Had
to have something with more style,
pep. and class for myself."
"Well, I guess Grace and I are about
in the same class. Both members of
the common herd. Neither of us ever
, had very much money, and "
"That's the trouble with Val. She's
! spoiled, and I couldn't feed her for a
I week or dress her for a day, so I'm
going to say 'goodnight' while the say
ing's safe and sane."
Buz looked the other way as he
replied, "Well, it probably won't hurt
her any. will it?"
j "The devil it won't. That girl's just
I crazy to hand me the switch key to
j her Cadillac right now."
"Then you aren't going to "
"Yes, I am." Skipper assembled his
safety razor as he spoke.
"Ah! Thou cruel, cruel Brutus," said
Buz, with a very poorly assumed atti
| tude of tragedy.
"It isn't right. I know," replied Skip
per in all seriousness as he turned to
face the mirror. "Still, what am I to
do? I only treated her nicely. I didn't
mean to insinuate anything, but she
simply takes it for granted that I'm in
j love with her."
"How do you know?" asked Buz, as
i he began to investigate the condition
of his own wardrobe.
"Why, by the way she treats me.
She breaks dates for me. She fur
nishes the car, and "
"How about that picture on the
other corner of your dresser?" broke
in Buz.
"You mean Caroline! That's just the
point. She's been waiting three years.
Teaching school in the meantime, you
know. Nothing like the little girl at
home. Going to be hard on Val,
but " Skipper had been talking
like a telegram, but now he halted en
tirely as the razor neared one corner
of his mouth.
"Are you sure she's waiting?" ven
tured Buz.
"Absolutely."
Buz paused in the act of lacing a
shoe and looked intently at Skipper,
whose back was turned. "Skipper." he
said, as if weighing every word, "In
the last year that we played football
together, were you ever kicked in the
head?"

"As soon as I find these damn studs."
Skipper directed his attention to the
box on top of the dresser. "Hell! Here
they are," he said in disgust.
"Told you so. Val's got you so wor
ried that your memory's on the fritz.
For the last time, before I lose my
temper, when are you going to shave?"
"Yesterday afternoon! What differ
ence does it make to you? Guess I can
shave myself."
"Well," smiled Buz, "I'm queening
tonight, myself.
"Who?"
"Grace Collins."
"Getting pretty steady, isn't it?" in
quired Skipper.
"Not so bad that I'm worried about
getting rid of her as you are about
Val. If I had a girl as "
"Equally old stuff. Why don't you?"
interupted Skipper.
"I am as soon as I can," was the
answer.
"Bunk!" was Skipper's only com
ment.
"If I had your looks and reputation,
I'd have a ring on her finger already,"
insisted Buz.

Skipper smiled through a sticky coat
of Palmolive. "Looks haven't anything
to do with It. A rep helps, but it's the
way you talk that does the trick."
"You must have some line, then.
You went with Grace a little before
you introduced her to me, didn't you?"
"Yeah." Skipper began using his
shaving brush. "She's not so bad. Had
to have something with more style,
pep. and class for myself."
"Well, I guess Grace and I are about
in the same class. Both members of
the common herd. Neither of us ever
, had very much money, and "
"That's the trouble with Val. She's
! spoiled, and I couldn't feed her for a
I week or dress her for a day, so I'm
going to say 'goodnight' while the say
ing's safe and sane."
Buz looked the other way as he
replied, "Well, it probably won't hurt
her any. will it?"
j "The devil it won't. That girl's just
I crazy to hand me the switch key to
j her Cadillac right now."
"Then you aren't going to "
"Yes, I am." Skipper assembled his
safety razor as he spoke.
"Ah! Thou cruel, cruel Brutus," said
Buz, with a very poorly assumed atti
| tude of tragedy.
"It isn't right. I know," replied Skip
per in all seriousness as he turned to
face the mirror. "Still, what am I to
do? I only treated her nicely. I didn't
mean to insinuate anything, but she
simply takes it for granted that I'm in
j love with her."
"How do you know?" asked Buz, as
i he began to investigate the condition
of his own wardrobe.
"Why, by the way she treats me.
She breaks dates for me. She fur
nishes the car, and "
"How about that picture on the
other corner of your dresser?" broke
in Buz.
"You mean Caroline! That's just the
point. She's been waiting three years.
Teaching school in the meantime, you
know. Nothing like the little girl at
home. Going to be hard on Val,
but " Skipper had been talking
like a telegram, but now he halted en
tirely as the razor neared one corner
of his mouth.
"Are you sure she's waiting?" ven
tured Buz.
"Absolutely."
Buz paused in the act of lacing a
shoe and looked intently at Skipper,
whose back was turned. "Skipper." he
said, as if weighing every word, "In
the last year that we played football
together, were you ever kicked in the
head?"

Skipper Mowen began removing all
the apparel from the top drawer of his
dresser and shoving it into the one
below. "Where in the devil are my
studs?" he asked his roommate.
"In the box where you usually keep
them, I suppose," replied Buz Brock
way without looking up from his type
writer or breaking the steady, almost
musical beat of his fingers.
"No," objected Skipper, "I took 'em
outa there this morning."
"Go borrow Jack's," suggested Buz,
still intent upon his work.
"Hell, no! Jack's aren't pearl."
"Well, that won't kill you. You've
done worse than that before and got
away with it."
"I know, but tonight's different. This
is the night, you know." Skipper re
versed the previous process and an
assortment of ties, socks, and shirts
went into the upper drawer like so
much chaff.
"Going to desert Val this time for
sure," laughed Buz as he added the
finishing period to his work.
Skipper viciously attacked the third
drawer. "I mean it this time."
"Old stuff! When are you going to
shave ?"
"As soon as I find these damn studs."

to do with It. A rep helps, but it's the
way you talk that does the trick."
"You must have some line, then.
You went with Grace a little before
you introduced her to me, didn't you?"
"Yeah." Skipper began using his
shaving brush. "She's not so bad. Had
to have something with more style,
pep. and class for myself."
"Well, I guess Grace and I are about
in the same class. Both members of
the common herd. Neither of us ever
, had very much money, and "
"That's the trouble with Val. She's
! spoiled, and I couldn't feed her for a
I week or dress her for a day, so I'm
going to say 'goodnight' while the say
ing's safe and sane."
Buz looked the other way as he
replied, "Well, it probably won't hurt
her any. will it?"
j "The devil it won't. That girl's just
I crazy to hand me the switch key to
j her Cadillac right now."
"Then you aren't going to "
"Yes, I am." Skipper assembled his
safety razor as he spoke.
"Ah! Thou cruel, cruel Brutus," said
Buz, with a very poorly assumed atti
| tude of tragedy.
"It isn't right. I know," replied Skip
per in all seriousness as he turned to
face the mirror. "Still, what am I to
do? I only treated her nicely. I didn't
mean to insinuate anything, but she
simply takes it for granted that I'm in
j love with her."
"How do you know?" asked Buz, as
i he began to investigate the condition
of his own wardrobe.
"Why, by the way she treats me.
She breaks dates for me. She fur
nishes the car, and "
"How about that picture on the
other corner of your dresser?" broke
in Buz.
"You mean Caroline! That's just the
point. She's been waiting three years.
Teaching school in the meantime, you
know. Nothing like the little girl at
home. Going to be hard on Val,
but " Skipper had been talking
like a telegram, but now he halted en
tirely as the razor neared one corner
of his mouth.
"Are you sure she's waiting?" ven
tured Buz.
"Absolutely."
Buz paused in the act of lacing a
shoe and looked intently at Skipper,
whose back was turned. "Skipper." he
said, as if weighing every word, "In
the last year that we played football
together, were you ever kicked in the
head?"

Skipper Mowen began removing all
the apparel from the top drawer of his
dresser and shoving it into the one
below. "Where in the devil are my
studs?" he asked his roommate.
"In the box where you usually keep
them, I suppose," replied Buz Brock
way without looking up from his type
writer or breaking the steady, almost
musical beat of his fingers.
"No," objected Skipper, "I took 'em
outa there this morning."
"Go borrow Jack's," suggested Buz,
still intent upon his work.
"Hell, no! Jack's aren't pearl."
"Well, that won't kill you. You've
done worse than that before and got
away with it."
"I know, but tonight's different. This
is the night, you know." Skipper re
versed the previous process and an
assortment of ties, socks, and shirts
went into the upper drawer like so
much chaff.
"Going to desert Val this time for
sure," laughed Buz as he added the
finishing period to his work.
Skipper viciously attacked the third
drawer. "I mean it this time."
"Old stuff! When are you going to
shave ?"
"As soon as I find these damn studs."
Skipper directed his attention to the
box on top of the dresser. "Hell! Here
they are," he said in disgust.
"Told you so. Val's got you so wor
ried that your memory's on the fritz.
For the last time, before I lose my
temper, when are you going to shave?"
"Yesterday afternoon! What differ
ence does it make to you? Guess I can
shave myself."
"Well," smiled Buz, "I'm queening
tonight, myself.
"Who?"
"Grace Collins."
"Getting pretty steady, isn't it?" in
quired Skipper.
"Not so bad that I'm worried about
getting rid of her as you are about
Val. If I had a girl as "
"Equally old stuff. Why don't you?"
interupted Skipper.
"I am as soon as I can," was the
answer.
"Bunk!" was Skipper's only com
ment.
"If I had your looks and reputation,
I'd have a ring on her finger already,"
insisted Buz.
