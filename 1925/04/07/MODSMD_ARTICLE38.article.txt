# ATHLETIC TROPHIES EXHIBITED IN GYM
## 
### 
Stanford's trophy room has become
j a reality with the opening of an ex
| hibit of banners, cups, pictures, and
other objects of interest in the Encina
; gymnasium. While a trophy room has
I existed for past years in the Union
building, this will be the culmination
of several attempts in past years to
place Stanford on the same basis as
other universities, which have special
trophy rooms.
The trophy room is now located
opposite the store for athletic supplies
in the gymnasium and was opened for
inspection today. About twenty-five
cups awarded in past years to athletic
teams, banners presented various or
ganizations, and pictures of football,
bosketball, baseball, and other teams
form a large part of the 'exhibit.
Among the other objects of interest
are: the first Block "S" sweater ever
awarded at Stanford, a banner pre
sented by the sophomore class presi
ball team of 1892, the handle of a
cane which in past years was pre
sented to the sophomore class presi
dent to the president of the freshmen
as a symbol of the frosh becoming
second year men.
Among the contributions to the ex
hibits are a set of athletic pictures
and banners from Encina Club, while
Skull and Snakes and the Circle "S"
society have given one hundred and
fifty and one hundred dollars, respec
tively. Gifts of all kinds which will aid
in enlarging the trophy exhibition, as
well as funds, are welcome, while all
campus organizations are urged to
support the movement.
