# DITZLER HURLS NO-HIT GAME FOR CHI PSI BALL TEAM
## 
### 
Tight pitching and midseason field
ing featured the opening games of the
intramural baseball series yesterday
in which three fraternities and one
club emerged victorious. Ditzler, Chi
Psi hurler, won the individual honors
of the day when he fanned 18 of the
21 men who faced him in seven in
nings.
The following are the complete fig
ures: Tlieta Xi 3, Alpha Delta Phi 2;
Chi Psi 2, Phi Kappa Psi 0; Sigma Nu
3, Phi Delta Tlieta 1; El Campo 5,
Sigma Chi 0.
Maillot hurled perfect ball for Theta
Xi for six innings, allowing the Alpha
Delts but one blow, while his team
mates had been bunching hits in the
second and sixth frames for three
runs. The two Scofields were espe
cially effective in clearing the bases
with timely bingles.
In the seventh Maillot eased up and
allowed Jayred to go to first when the
catcher missed a wild pitch. Tompson
and Neer fanned but Dennis singled,
advancing Jayred to third. Both run
ners scored when Williams clouted
one past short. Wheaton of the Alpha
Delts ended the game by popping out.
The Chi Psi's won the first shutout
of the season when Ditzler pitched a
no-hit, no-run game against the Phi
Psis. Only 21 men faced him in seven
innings, and he was in complete con
trol at all times. His fast ball will
cause a lot of trouble in League I this
season.
Ditzler won his own game in the
third inning. Hays, first man up,
fanned, but Ankele, the next man,
walkd, and was brought in by a long
three-bagger by Ditzler. Fassoth's hit
brought the count up to two, bringing
in Ditzler. Troyer starred for the Phi
Psi's and kept the Chi Psi total down
by two clever catches.
Wilson of Sigma Nu'kept the Phi
Delts completely under control and
allowed but three scattered hits. Logan
made the only Phi Delt run in the
third inning when he singled and
scored when Kenney, the next man
up. was walked.
The Sigma Nu's scored one run in
the first inning when Wakefield's
single brought in Kohler who previ
ously doubled. Their big frame was
the sixth, when Kohler's home run,
Wakefield's walk, and Wilson's single
contributed two runs.
El Campo had little trouble with the
Sigma Chis, piling up a lead of three
runs in the first inning. Britton,- of
the club, kept up the good pitching
of the day by fanning twelve men. His
control was perfect and his fast ball
kept the Sigs guessing all the time.
Adams, the Sig' hurler, had trouble in
the first frame and allowed two hits.
Later he settled down and in the last
four innings the game developed into
a pitchers' battle.
The games tomorrow are: Breakers
vs. Cuadro; Sequoia vs. Alpha Sig
ma Phi; Independents vs. Zeta Psi;
Kappa Sigma vs. Encina Second.
