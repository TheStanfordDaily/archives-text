# DITZLER HURLS NO-HIT GAME FOR CHI PSI BALL TEAM
## 
### 
Tight pitching and midseason field
ing featured the opening games of the
intramural baseball series yesterday
in which three fraternities and one
club emerged victorious. Ditzler, Chi
Psi hurler, won the individual honors
of the day when he fanned 18 of the
21 men who faced him in seven in

The following are the complete fig

Chi Psi 2, Phi Kappa Psi 0; Sigma Nu
3, Phi Delta Tlieta 1; El Campo 5,
Sigma Chi 0.
Maillot hurled perfect ball for Theta
Xi for six innings, allowing the Alpha
Delts but one blow, while his team
mates had been bunching hits in the
second and sixth frames for three
runs. The two Scofields were espe
cially effective in clearing the bases
with timely bingles.
In the seventh Maillot eased up and
allowed Jayred to go to first when the
catcher missed a wild pitch. Tompson
and Neer fanned but Dennis singled,
advancing Jayred to third. Both run
ners scored when Williams clouted
one past short. Wheaton of the Alpha
Delts ended the game by popping out.
The Chi Psi's won the first shutout
of the season when Ditzler pitched a
no-hit, no-run game against the Phi
Psis. Only 21 men faced him in seven
innings, and he was in complete con
trol at all times. His fast ball will
cause a lot of trouble in League I this
season.
Ditzler won his own game in the
third inning. Hays, first man up,
fanned, but Ankele, the next man,
walkd, and was brought in by a long
