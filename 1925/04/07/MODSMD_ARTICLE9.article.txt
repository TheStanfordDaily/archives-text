# FOOTBALL RECEIVES HIGHEST RATING IN D. P. A. STRAW VOTE
## 
### 
Early results of the balloting in the
Daily Palo Alto's straw vote to de
termine the most popular sport indi
cate that football has a commanding
lead over the other sports in the race
for first place. More heavy voting than
is usual in this sort of balloting was
made by the student body.
Blank ballots will be printed in each
issue of the Daily for the remainder
of this week and ballots may be placed
in the box on the Engineers corner of
the quad or mailed to the Daily office.
Ballots must be signed.
The order of the first eight fa
vorites in the voting was football
first, followed by basketball, track,
tenis, baseball, swimm«ng, polo,
boxing, and golf; tennis nosing
baseball out of fourth place. Polo,
standing eighth, has been justified
as a minor sport, at least in the
eyes of the voters in the contest
today. Swimming, as was to be
expected, was close on the trail of
the present major sports.
Balloting during the week may sub
stantially change the list as it is at
present. Several organizations are ex
pected to attempt to place certain
sports in the running for a ranking po
sition. Today's voting, however, may
be taken as a fair indication of the
attitude of the unorganized students
at large.
The purpose of the Daily in holding
this ballot is to determine student at
trtude. If any importance is to be
attached to the vote by the reformers
of the athletic system it must be
ethical as far as possible. In order to
keep these things as fair as possible,
organized efforts to influence the re
sult of the ballot will be watched and
noted by the Daily.
There are several sports that are
hanging on the balance and backers of
these sports may, at the expense of
what is logical in gate receipts, try
to influence the voting values ridicu
lously.
The committee appointed by the
Executive Committee at its last meet
ing to investigate the question of ath
letic awards met last night but no
definite action was taken on the mat
ter. A meeting in the near fullire will
indicate the possibility of any pro
posed changes in the present system.
The members making up the ap
pointed committee are Harry Maloney,
R. L. Templeton, Carl Doerr, Ted Mil
ler, Gifford Troyer, and Jake Irwin.

Executive Committee at its last meet
ing to investigate the question of ath

Early results of the balloting in the
Daily Palo Alto's straw vote to de
termine the most popular sport indi
cate that football has a commanding
lead over the other sports in the race
for first place. More heavy voting than
is usual in this sort of balloting was
made by the student body.
Blank ballots will be printed in each
issue of the Daily for the remainder
of this week and ballots may be placed
in the box on the Engineers corner of
the quad or mailed to the Daily office.
Ballots must be signed.
The order of the first eight fa
vorites in the voting was football
first, followed by basketball, track,
tenis, baseball, swimm«ng, polo,
boxing, and golf; tennis nosing
baseball out of fourth place. Polo,
standing eighth, has been justified
as a minor sport, at least in the
eyes of the voters in the contest
today. Swimming, as was to be
expected, was close on the trail of
the present major sports.
Balloting during the week may sub
stantially change the list as it is at
present. Several organizations are ex
pected to attempt to place certain
sports in the running for a ranking po
sition. Today's voting, however, may
be taken as a fair indication of the
attitude of the unorganized students
at large.
The purpose of the Daily in holding
this ballot is to determine student at
trtude. If any importance is to be
attached to the vote by the reformers
of the athletic system it must be
ethical as far as possible. In order to
keep these things as fair as possible,
organized efforts to influence the re
sult of the ballot will be watched and
noted by the Daily.
There are several sports that are
hanging on the balance and backers of
these sports may, at the expense of
what is logical in gate receipts, try
to influence the voting values ridicu
lously.
