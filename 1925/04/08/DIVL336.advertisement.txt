PIPING ROCK FLANNEL
wonderfulfabric for college clothes
The first thing college men look for in
a suit is ease. It must look easy and feel
easy. For this, there's nothing better
than flannel. There's nothing as good
as Piping Rock flannel. It's a special
Society Brand fabric, to be had nowhere
else. It makes a wonderful college suit.
And, at fifty dollars, a wonderful buy.
