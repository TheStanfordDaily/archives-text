# FRESHMEN OPPOSE CUB BASEBALLERS
## Cards Have Edge in Series Opener at California Stadium Tomorrow 
### 
Led t>y Coach "Husky" Hunt, fresh
man baseball men travel to Berkeley
tomorrow to take on the California
babes in the first contest of what is
scheduled to be a three-game series.
Unless the dope is way off two games
will be all that are needed to settle
things in favor of the Cards. Post
poned from last Saturday on account
of rain, tomorrow's battle will start at
3:30 in the California memorial sta
dium.
The small amount of comparative
data available gives Hunt's men quite
an edge over the cubs, who have
dropped games to San Francisco Poly
technic and Berkeley high schools and
tied Alameda. The Stanford frosh have
beaten these teams decisively.
Of sixteen games played against out
side opposition the yearlings have won
fourteen and lost two, scoring 128
runs to their opponents' 39. In addi
tion, they took the interclass cham
pionship. Close followers of the squad
claim that the freshmen are capable
of beating the varsity.
Babes Heavy Hitters
In the 1928 nine Hunt has one of
the hardest-hitting first-year aggrega
tions he has developed in years. There
is not a man in the line-up who could*
be termed really weak with the willow.
Captain Sypher, Clark, Nissen, and
Garibaldi are perhaps the most con- j
sistent sluggers, but Maguire leads in j
the number of extra base cloutß.
The pitching staff is composed of j
three men of almost equal ability— i
Philippi, Sobieski, and Reynolds. The
former has the most stuff on the ball,
but he occasionally has off days. So
bieski is the steadiest of the trio. Rey
nolds has a tremendous amount of
speed, and when he has control he is
unbeatable. Hunt will not decide on
the moundsman for tomorrow until
just before the game.
Maguire on first, Garibaldi at sec
ond, Nissen at third, and Clark at
short make up a strong, fast infield. In
all probability Busch will alternate
with Clark at short during the Cali
fornia series. Busch was a regular at
the start of the season, but an injury
held him back for several weeks and
Clark stepped into the breach. The
basketball captain is such a powerful
hitter that Hunt was loathe to bench
him, although Busch is the fastest of
the two in the field. Biaggini in left
field, Weaver in center, and Sims in
right complete the nine. All are dan
gerous batsmen.

Percy Marks, author of "The Plastic
Age," says that fifty per cent of col
lege students should be put out, both
for their own good and good of the
college. He says some go because it is
'the usual thing," and others to join
the University Club in their own cities.
"First-class mechanics go to college
and come out fourth-rate engineers.
You ought to be in college to learn
to live."
Father and son are pursuing the
same course in rural journalism at the
same time in South Dakota cottage.

former has the most stuff on the ball,
but he occasionally has off days. So
bieski is the steadiest of the trio. Rey
nolds has a tremendous amount of
speed, and when he has control he is
unbeatable. Hunt will not decide on
the moundsman for tomorrow until
just before the game.
Maguire on first, Garibaldi at sec
ond, Nissen at third, and Clark at
short make up a strong, fast infield. In
all probability Busch will alternate
with Clark at short during the Cali
fornia series. Busch was a regular at
the start of the season, but an injury
held him back for several weeks and
Clark stepped into the breach. The
basketball captain is such a powerful
hitter that Hunt was loathe to bench
him, although Busch is the fastest of
the two in the field. Biaggini in left
field, Weaver in center, and Sims in
right complete the nine. All are dan
gerous batsmen.

Percy Marks, author of "The Plastic
Age," says that fifty per cent of col
lege students should be put out, both
for their own good and good of the
college. He says some go because it is
'the usual thing," and others to join
the University Club in their own cities.

Led t>y Coach "Husky" Hunt, fresh
man baseball men travel to Berkeley
tomorrow to take on the California
babes in the first contest of what is
scheduled to be a three-game series.
Unless the dope is way off two games
will be all that are needed to settle
things in favor of the Cards. Post
poned from last Saturday on account
of rain, tomorrow's battle will start at
3:30 in the California memorial sta
dium.
The small amount of comparative
data available gives Hunt's men quite
an edge over the cubs, who have
dropped games to San Francisco Poly
technic and Berkeley high schools and
tied Alameda. The Stanford frosh have
beaten these teams decisively.
Of sixteen games played against out
side opposition the yearlings have won
fourteen and lost two, scoring 128
runs to their opponents' 39. In addi
tion, they took the interclass cham
pionship. Close followers of the squad
claim that the freshmen are capable
of beating the varsity.
Babes Heavy Hitters
In the 1928 nine Hunt has one of
the hardest-hitting first-year aggrega
tions he has developed in years. There
is not a man in the line-up who could*
be termed really weak with the willow.
Captain Sypher, Clark, Nissen, and
Garibaldi are perhaps the most con- j
sistent sluggers, but Maguire leads in j
the number of extra base cloutß.
The pitching staff is composed of j
three men of almost equal ability— i
Philippi, Sobieski, and Reynolds. The
former has the most stuff on the ball,
but he occasionally has off days. So
bieski is the steadiest of the trio. Rey
nolds has a tremendous amount of
speed, and when he has control he is
