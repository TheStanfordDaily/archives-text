ranged to give Stanford alumni and
students a chance to release some of
the pent-up joviality which will un
doubtedly be acquired at the stadium

on one of the four numbers.
After seeing the freshman chorus at
work under the direction of Adelaide
Kelly, it is certain that even Flo Zieg
field would say that the opera revue,
which is the fourth act, is worth while.
Miss Kelly has designated the steps
for the freshman chorus, and it lifts
taken to them like a group of experi
enced dancers. The freshman girls are
too tall for a pony chorus and too
short for a beauty chorus, but combine
the good features of both. Gardner
