# Helen Menken, "Seventh Heaven" Star, Visits Stanford Campus
## 
### 
i With an imagination and personality
as vivid as her Titian hair, Miss Helen
Menken, star of John Golden'a produc
tion, "Seventh Heaven," now playing
in San Francisco, compels attention
I merely by her presence.
From the moment she entered the
! Chi Omega house yesterday noon until
; the time she left, her eager, husky
voice, sometimes laughing, sometimes
extremely earnest, held her listeners
fascinated.
Her large hrown eyes, half cloncd,
seemed to he dreaming of wonders,
then she opened them expresively, nn l
said. "Of course we will meet again,
j In life we always see those we know."

; Then changing her slender figure to
the stoop of old age, she mimicked, " I
hope you will still be watching me play
when I'm in the old lady parts, and my
teeth will have fallen out, and you
! will hopple up to setaoinshtaoinshr
! will hobble up to say, "Don't you re
| member meeting me at Stanford'?"
Advocates College Dramatics
Miss Menken is interested in college
j dramatics. She believes that participa
tion in such activities helps to teach
| technique, and is a good foundation
| for later stage work.
"At college," she said, "you learn
Greek drama, and the Elizabethan
period. You study the fundamentals,
and then it is easier to work. Every
one needs a foundation, and then one
has the privilege of building on it in
any way; it is just as one needs a
foundation before building a house.
"This idea of going on the stage
during childhood is wrong," she
claimed. "Girls should go on the stage
at the age of eighteen or nineteen.
Then they do not have to unlearn the
tricks they depended on when younger.
They learn to look at things from a
different attitude when they are more
mature." Miss Menken named Jane
Cowl as an example of a successful
actress who did not go on the stage
until she was older.
Concerning college she said, "I
should like to live this kind of a life
for awhile. We always like to do what
we can't do."
Predicts New Drama Center
That the West, especially Los An
geles and San Francisco, will be fu
ture dramatic centers, is Miss Men
ken's prediction. The West has a dis
tinct atmosphere, especially San Fran
cisco. she said. Eastern producers are
sending their plays out West more
often to try them out, and this, Miss
Menken believes, is merely the begin
ning of the building up of the West
as a distinct dramatic center.
Works Intensively
Miss Menken will have a vacation
for the first time in nine years this
summer. She says that she does not
mind the tired feeling that comes from
her hard work, because it gives her a
certain satisfaction. Even though she
has acted in "Seventh Heaven" for
three years, she still enjoys the lines
of the play.
While visiting Stanford, Miss Men
ken addressed a class in dramatic in
terpretation. and told them of her life.
With her came Miss Mary Ricard, her
understudy, who' also has a part in
"Seventh Heaven."
Miss Menken has been on the stage
since she was six years old.
