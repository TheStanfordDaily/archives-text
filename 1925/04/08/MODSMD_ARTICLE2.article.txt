# MYERS NAMED HEAD OF COMMITTEE FOR LABOR DAY EVENT
## 
### 
Members of the Labor Day Committee
beaded by R. P. Myers were named at
the Executive Committee last night and
four swimmers were granted the Block
"S" on the grounds that, before the ban
was laid, met the requirements under the
ruling recently abolished. Regular ath
letic awards in several branches of sports
were made by the committee.
The four men granted the Block "S"
for winning their event for three con
secutive years in competition with Cali
fornia were R. Meyers, C. McAllister,
F. Schmeider, E. Collett. All of these
men have played on water polo teams
that for the past three years have de
feated their Blue and Gold rivals. The
voting for these awards was 4 to 3, two
members of the committee being absent.
This action, while apparently incon
sistent with the attitude of the committee
as reflected at the last meeting when this
rule was abolished, is supported by the
fact that these men had already completed
the requirements.
No report was had from the committee
appointed to investigate the number of
athletic awards. This committee will
hold a meeting soon and definite results
of its inquiries will then be known.
The complete minutes of the meeting
are as follows:
M. S. C. That Art Schoen be appointed
to fill a vacancy on the Rally Committee.

for May 29 be changed to May 22.
