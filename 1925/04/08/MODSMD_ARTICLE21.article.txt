# BALLOTING SHOWS FOOTBALL FAVORITE, BASKETBALL SECOND
## 
### 
Football held a commanding lead in
the balloting of the first day of the
i straw vote being conducted by the
! Daily Palo Alto to determine the popu
lar sports. Basketball led track for
| second place by a narrow margin,
j though more votes were cast for the
â–  cinder-path sport in the totals than
for the court game.
Tennis continued to lead baseball
for fourth place in the race for major
sport honors under one of the pro
posed systems. Heavy balloting during
the noon hour did not greatly change
the complexion of the vote as cast
j before eleven o'clock yesterday. Swim
: ming has apparently cinched sixth
place with heavy figures.
The most notable advance was that
of soccer which moved from beyond
! eighth place up to seventh, forcing
horse polo back a notch from the posi
tion it held during the first two hours
I of the voting. Golf has been relegated
to ninth or tenth place and is fighting,
the matter out with boxing, which
came in strong late yesterday.
Following are the changes in the
list of favorites as made before 11
j o'clock for the first list and in the
second list is the second rating given:
First Second Sport
11 Football
2 2 Basketball
3 3 T rack
4 4 Tennis
5 5 Baseball
6 6 Swimming
7 8 Polo
7 Soccer
8 Golf
The Daily will continue to publish
ballots for the remainder of the week
and in Monday's edition will be pub
lished the total results of the voting.
A little over a hundred votes were cast
yesterday and it is expected that vot
ing today and tomorrow will be much
heavier.
