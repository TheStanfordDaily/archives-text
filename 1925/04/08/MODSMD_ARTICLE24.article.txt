# Athletic Aristocracy
## 
### 
The time is, admittedly, ripe for a complete revolutionizing of our
athletic system. But is it advisable? Will it be a fair revision?
Stanford major sport teams are beginning to compete on an equal
and victorious basis with teams all over the United States; newspapers are
giving Stanford more than a liberal share of healthy publicity; Stanford
athletes are ranking high in the opinion of a sporting public. But hasn't
it all gone to our heads?
There was a time—and it wasn't so long ago—when major sport teams
were noted mainly for their many defeats. There was a time when the
minor sport teams were our only victorious representatives. The fencing
teams, the gym teams, the weight basketball teams, the swimming teams,
the soccer teams, the cross-country teams, the handball teams, etc., held,
and still do hold, the larger percentage of victories over the University of
California. >
One example of unduly unfair distinction. The weight basketball
teams this season were denied awards because of a failure to distinguish
themselves. Granted. And yet did the varsity basketball team distinguish
itself? Sacriligious, of course, to even mention such a thing, but it bears
out with the argument that we are placing athletics on a scale depending
on the market price at which we can sell our sport. It is typically and re
grettably American. —D. C. M.
