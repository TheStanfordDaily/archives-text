The Editor, Sir:
"If they win, they're crazy" began
one of last week's editorials. Who's
crazy? Why is it "unnatural" for a
woman to want to pay her share of
the expenses of a date? Just because
at one time no woman had any money
of her own and had to allow the man
to pay for her is no reason why the
modern woman, who is financially as
well situated as the man, should do
the same.
The feeling now is that the man is
doing her a personal and expensive
favor in taking her out and that it is
up to her to do the entertaining. If she
does not, she is getting something for
nothing, which never works out right.
Our opinion is that the man and the
woman should share equally both the
responsibility and the enjoyment.
Of course, this must come through
a change in public opinion—nothing
can be done by individual action in
the face of present prejudice.
As for "chivalry" and the "mysteri
ous awe of womanhood" —why not
substitute mutual courtesy and a
genuine friendliness based on some
solider ground than mere unfamiliar
ity? —Misses M. F. and H. H.
