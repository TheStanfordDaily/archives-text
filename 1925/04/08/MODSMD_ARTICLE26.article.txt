# DEAN YOST TO OPEN EUPHRONIA FORUM TOMORROW EVENING
## 
### 
"Activities have two functions, to
afford recreation and to develop abili
ties and talents which will be useful
to the student after he leaves college."
This is the opinion expressed by
Dean Mary Yost in an interview on
the subject of what place student or
ganizations have on the Stanford cam
pus, which will be discussed at the
Open Forum in the Old Union tomor
row evening at 8 o'clock.
Dean Yost suggested at Ihe Deans'
Assembly last fall that student or
ganizations on the campus should be
surveyed and a discussion of the situ
ation tomorrow night will follow the
report of the committee on investiga
tion.
"It is a question whether all the ac
tivities on the campus* meet a real
need or whether in some the
need has been outgrown and the or
ganization continues just because it
lias always done so," Dean Yost con
tinued. "There has been a feeling that

too few students participate in too j
many activities. This situation wouid
mean that a great many are deprived
of the privileges received by partici
pation, and the organizations them
selves suffer from lack of enthusiasm
in the members."
She says that casual observance ha 3
brought many to believe that this is
the case. The purpose of the survey
: s to present the facts of the situation.
"Although all universities are fac
ing this same problem. I know of no I
other institution which has shown such !
interest in getting down to the facts.
The use of the Open Forum to clarify t
the matter is a sign of a most in Vli
ffent and constructive interest on the '
part of the students."
Ground was broken for the Donohoe
Memorial Infirmary building at Santa
Clara College.
