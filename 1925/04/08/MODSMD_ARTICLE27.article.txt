The Editor, Sir:
It seems to me that this attempt at
drawing a line between what shall be
a major sport and what shall be a
minor sport for the purpose of decid
ing whether a person shall get an "S,"
a German "S," or a blocked "S," can
hardly be justified. It takes just as
much effort to make a good tennis
player as it does to make a good foot
ball player; just as much time to
make a good swimmer as a good bas
ketball player. The sacrifice is no less.
The great difference lies in the fact,
that football men play before thou
sands of spectators while participants
of "minor" sports perform before com
paratively few. To base awards" of
honor upon such a foundation is to
my mind unworthy of Stanford's high
ideals.
However, the public is interested in
knowing in which sport a letter was
won. Therefore I would suggest that
each sport have its own particular in
signia. Thus, for example, an "S" and
a winged foot or an "S" and the letters
«T might indicate an athlete of
the Stanford Track Team, or an "S"
and crossed racquets might indicate a
member of the tennis team.
Similarly, insignia can be drawn up
to indicate "S" football men, "S" base
ball men, basketball men, wrestlers,
boxers, fencers, swimmers, etc. This
satisfies any logical demand for dis
tinction and would reward athletes ac
cording to their merit.
