# THE 						HORSE
## 
### 
By Tom Foolery
Oh the horse is a wonderful creature,
He has a big head and a tail,
He has a long main and he's steered
by a rein,
Which can easily be tied to a rail.
He likes to eat grass and drink water,
He can run very fast like a snail,
And, as I've already told you,
He has a big head and a tail.
