"Late as usual," whispered Skippe
to himself, as he fumbled or the be!
at Vfal's sorority house. "Well, i
won't happen again," he added with i
chuckle.
"Oh, yes! Mr. Mowen, of course,
apologized the freshman who an
swered, and then without giving Skijj
per a chance to say a word she ram
bled on. "Won't you come in and wait
Do. I'll call Val right away." And shi
departed to do his bidding.
"Sweet," murmured Buz as he heart
her bounding up the stairs. "Why don'
the darn thing take wings and fly?'
Being left alone. Skipper walked int<
the parlor, tossed his hat on a Ches
terfield, and sat on the piano bench
"Oh, Skipper," said the baby as sh<
entered the room, "Val wants you t(
get her car out of the garage. Sh<
gave me the key."
"All right," said Skipper, rising frore
his seat and extending his hand.
"Don't you think I'd better show yov
where it is?" she asked, and made nc
move to surrender the key.
"Thank you just the same, but 1
think I can find it. At least, I should
be able to by now."
"But they may have changed the
place, and. besides, it's awfully dark
out there."
"Aren't you afraid of the dark?"
"No, of course not."
"Then let's get under way."
Out the front door they went and
around the corner of the house with
out difficulty, but as they reached the
path which led to the garage, the girl
suddenly decided to walk on the high
wooden curb that bordered the path.
She slipped and Skipper caught her.
"Be careful," he cautioned, "no casu
alties on this party."
"Hold my hand, then," she com
manded, and continued to disregard
his suggestion.
"This is indeed a pleasure," he re
plied, as he complied with her re
quest.
"Really, is it?"
"Of course."
"I think you're kidding me."
"No, I'm not."
"But you almost never go out with
anybody but Val."
"What's that got to do with it?"
"Well, the girls all say that you flat
ter them with a hot line but that's as
far as it goes."
"That's not so."
"Why not?"
"Because I don't say that to every
girl."
"Then why do you—you—say it to
me?"
"Because you're pretty.
"Some line!"
"Very well. I'll let go your hand."
"I'll fall if you do."
"We're at the end of the walk. You
can't."
"Smart!"
"No," he replied, as he released her
hand. "Only careful."
Skipper found the light switch with
out aid or suggestion from his guide
and located Val's car in one of the
several stalls that served as garages.
"Nice big car, isn't it?" she chirped!
sinking back on the leather cushions.
"No nicer than its owner," he re
plied, and began the general process
of^ backing out of the garage.
"After all," she commented, "I guess
Val's pretty lucky."
"Now what is the meaning of that
remark?"
"Hasn't everybody told you how nice
they think you are?"
"Not everybody," he replied, as he
shut off the motor and helped her out
of the car.
"Well, they will some day, then,"
she said as they entered the hall.
"You're nice to everybody and they
just can't " There was a sound
()f high-heeled slippers on the stairs.
"We just got back in time," whispered
the freshman as she beat a hasty re
treat. "Goodnight."
