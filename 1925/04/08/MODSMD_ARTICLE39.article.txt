# KIDDY CAR PROVIDES TRANSPORTATION FOR BOLD YOUNG WOMAN
## 
### 
Ah! At last the transportation prob
lem has been solved. No longer will
the panting student rush into class and
gasp an intarticulate something about
"that alarm clock."
It is a young woman who has intro
duced this novel means fo locomotion
on the campus. Along the arcades of
the good old quad stie sped. At the
engineering corner she gracefully
alighted from her shining new vehicle
and carried it up the steps across the
way. How she loved to ride her kiddy
car! She rode it to all her classes and
back again afterwards. But â€”the young
lady was exactly three and one-lialf
years old.
Instructors of Ohio universities are
charged with Bolshevism and a
sweeping investigation has been de
manded.
