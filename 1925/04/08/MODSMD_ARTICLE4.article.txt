# SWIMMERS DISCOVER MUCH OTHER LIFE IN THICK LAKE WATERS
## 
### 
« Swimmers in Lagunita may be ex
pected to grow waterwings if the
number of fair shrimp in the lake, and
hence the number swallowed, becomes
much greater. But fairy-shrimp, which
looks rather like a centipede on its
back waving all its legs at once, is by
no means the only inhabitant of the
lake waters, according to students of
biology. Microscopic eyes would cer
tainly be a deterring influence on any
one who would otherwise have the
courage to brave the mangling min
now and the tasteful tadpole, the
awful algae and the biting bacteria.
Not to discourage ambitious swim
mers, Lagunita might be said to have
more life per gallon than old three
star. Of the larger aquatic animals
the lake contains tadpoles, salaman
ders (also known as water pups), pond
snails, water-beetles, and water-boat
men. These last creatures, about a
quarter of an inch long, have two oar
like projections which they use for
locomotion. If enough of them could
be harnessed together, a very service
able means of propulsion would be
furnished for canoes. Here is another
opportunity for ye engineering genius.
A half-dozen varieties of crustacea,
insect larvae, and microscopic plants
and animals are present in great
quantities also. Most notable is the
number of snakes seen in and around
the lake on afternoons and holidays.
These creatures seem to prefer warm
days when, wrapped in bright colors,
they may be seen in pairs.
