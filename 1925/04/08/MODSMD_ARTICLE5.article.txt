# JAP IMMIGRATION SUBJECT OF DEBATE
## 
### 
"Japanese Immigration" was the sub
ject of a no-decision debate between,
representatives of Stanford and the
Kansas Agricultural College held last
evening in the Little Theatre. T. F.
Baer and D. R. Parker upheld the af
firmative of the question, "Resolved,
That the immigration law of 1924
should be so amended as to admit
Japanese on the same basis as Euro
peans." R. E. Hedburg and C. A. Walt
supported the negative of the ques
tion for Kansas. Dr. A. M. Cathcart of
the Stanford law school was chairman
of the debate.
Baer, in advancing the case of the
affirmative, briefly traced the relations
of Japan with the United States. He
showed how the act of exclusion,
passed in the face of disapproval by
such statesmen as President Coolidge,
former Secretary Hughes, and others,
destroyed in one day the friendly atti
tude and co-operation of Japan on the
immigration question. Another point of
the affirmative was that by means of
the repealing of the exclusion act, not
only would but 146 of the best Japan
ese enter, but in addition the United
States would have the co-operation of
Japan, and so would aid in the estab
lishment of world peace.
Walt, first speaker for the negative,
stated that the hostility between Japan
and America was not the direct result
of the exclusion act, but the deeper
seated race friction caused by the
proximity of two distinct peoples, Cau
casians and Orientals. Thus repealing
the act would not settle the problem,
I but only delay it until in the future
| possibly it would culminate in racial
conflict. The presence of the Japanese
in America was compared to the past
land present difficulties with the ne
j groes in America. The example of
: Hawaii was given to illustrate results
i of unrestricted Japanese immigration.
Parker of Stanford argued for the
; affirmative that the negro analogy did
not materially affect the question, as
! the problem already existed previous
to the exclusion act. In agreeing that
there was a separation between two
peoples, Parker advocated admission
on the quota basis, thus obtaining im
migrants in fewer number than would
unlawfully enter from Mexico, with
the additional factor that the support
of Japan would aid in enforcing the
quota basis admission. "If there is any
menace in the Japanese problem it is
the menace to world peace," stated the
Stanford speaker.
The second speaker for the Kansans,
Hedburg, emphasized Japan's need for
territory in which to colonize and thus
relieve its over-population. The atti
tude of the Oriental country in at
tempting to have the domestic affairs
of America settled in the World Court,
and the difficulties subsequently aris
ing by the logical refusal of the United
States was also advanced.
In rebuttal the Stanford speakers
again emphasized the essentials of
Japanese co-operation, world peace,
and the favorable results obtained by
the Gentlemen's Agreement. Japan's
desire to be recognized on a basis of
equality was given as her primary aim.
Retention and assimilation of the good
qualities of the Japanese, producing a
"unity of mind" was advocated.
The true friendliness of Japan was i
questioned in the negative rebuttal,!
together with the fact that the Japa- j
nese were unassimillable.
An open forum was held at the i
close of the debate at which questions i
on both sides of the debate were asked !
and discussed by audience and speak-'
ers. Interest in the question was shown
to a marked degree by those attending
the debate.
The Stanford debate was the seventh
of ten to be made by Kansas on their !

trip, although only the second on the
immigration question.
The Joffre Debate with California
on French policy in Asia and Africa,
to be held in the Assembly hall at
Stanford, Wednesday, April 15, was
announced by Chairman Cathcart. The
Joffre contest will mark the close of
the debate season.

destroyed in one day the friendly atti
tude and co-operation of Japan on the
immigration question. Another point of
the affirmative was that by means of
the repealing of the exclusion act, not
only would but 146 of the best Japan
ese enter, but in addition the United
States would have the co-operation of
Japan, and so would aid in the estab
lishment of world peace.
Walt, first speaker for the negative,
stated that the hostility between Japan
and America was not the direct result
of the exclusion act, but the deeper
seated race friction caused by the
proximity of two distinct peoples, Cau
casians and Orientals. Thus repealing
the act would not settle the problem,
I but only delay it until in the future
| possibly it would culminate in racial
conflict. The presence of the Japanese
in America was compared to the past
land present difficulties with the ne
j groes in America. The example of
: Hawaii was given to illustrate results
i of unrestricted Japanese immigration.
Parker of Stanford argued for the
; affirmative that the negro analogy did
not materially affect the question, as
! the problem already existed previous
to the exclusion act. In agreeing that
there was a separation between two
peoples, Parker advocated admission
on the quota basis, thus obtaining im
migrants in fewer number than would
unlawfully enter from Mexico, with
the additional factor that the support
of Japan would aid in enforcing the
quota basis admission. "If there is any
menace in the Japanese problem it is
the menace to world peace," stated the
Stanford speaker.
The second speaker for the Kansans,
Hedburg, emphasized Japan's need for
territory in which to colonize and thus
relieve its over-population. The atti
tude of the Oriental country in at
tempting to have the domestic affairs
of America settled in the World Court,
and the difficulties subsequently aris
ing by the logical refusal of the United
States was also advanced.
In rebuttal the Stanford speakers
again emphasized the essentials of
Japanese co-operation, world peace,
and the favorable results obtained by
the Gentlemen's Agreement. Japan's
desire to be recognized on a basis of
equality was given as her primary aim.
Retention and assimilation of the good
qualities of the Japanese, producing a
"unity of mind" was advocated.
The true friendliness of Japan was i
questioned in the negative rebuttal,!
together with the fact that the Japa- j
nese were unassimillable.
An open forum was held at the i
close of the debate at which questions i
on both sides of the debate were asked !
and discussed by audience and speak-'
ers. Interest in the question was shown
to a marked degree by those attending
the debate.
The Stanford debate was the seventh
of ten to be made by Kansas on their !

trip, although only the second on the
immigration question.
The Joffre Debate with California
on French policy in Asia and Africa,
to be held in the Assembly hall at
Stanford, Wednesday, April 15, was

Joffre contest will mark the close of

"Japanese Immigration" was the sub
ject of a no-decision debate between,
representatives of Stanford and the
Kansas Agricultural College held last
evening in the Little Theatre. T. F.
Baer and D. R. Parker upheld the af
firmative of the question, "Resolved,
That the immigration law of 1924
should be so amended as to admit
Japanese on the same basis as Euro
peans." R. E. Hedburg and C. A. Walt
supported the negative of the ques
tion for Kansas. Dr. A. M. Cathcart of
the Stanford law school was chairman
of the debate.
Baer, in advancing the case of the
affirmative, briefly traced the relations
of Japan with the United States. He
showed how the act of exclusion,
passed in the face of disapproval by
such statesmen as President Coolidge,
former Secretary Hughes, and others,
destroyed in one day the friendly atti
tude and co-operation of Japan on the
immigration question. Another point of
