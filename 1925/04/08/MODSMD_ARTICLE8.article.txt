# OREGON TRACKSTERS WILL ARRIVE FRIDAY FOR CARDINAL MEET
## Hold Pacific Coast Title by Victory in Conference Meet, 1924 
### Douglas Meservey 
Coach "Bill" Hay ward and his Web
footers from the University of Oregon
will arrive in Palo Alto at 2:17 Friday
for their meet with Stanford next Satur
day.
The northerners are coming to engage
R. L. Templeton's tracksters in the for
mer's first intercollegiate meet of the
season and will therefore be handicapped
by inexperience. Only twelve men are to
make the journey but it is thought that
Templeton will not have to limit his
entry list as was done in the Nebraska
contest.
The Webfooters are Pacific Coast Con
ference champions, by Virtue of their first
place in the Conference meet May 31,
1924. They annexed the title with 37
points; Washington being sceond with
36 while Stanford's second team tied
with. Oregon Agricultural College for
third place with 27 points each.
Captain Rosenberg is one of the stars
of the aggregation. This is his second
year of varsity experience and he spe
cializes in three field events —broad jump,
pole vault, and javelin. His best marks
in the jump event range around 22 feet
with 12 feet in the pole vault. In both,
he should give Weeks, Macßae and Sco
field little trouble. He has been tossing
the javelin out around 175 and 180 feet,
and took second to Evers in the Con
ference meet.
Three sprinsters who have been turn
ing in fast times will run the dashes for
the northerners. Westerman does the
hundred in 0:10 1-5 with Hold running
about the same time. Extra, who is in
his first year of varsity competition,
seems to be promising material with 0:22
3-5 in tiie 220 and around 0:52 for the
quarter. He will also enter the broad
jump.
Hayward lias two of his 440 and relay
men back who competed in the Confer
ence meet —Ager and Kinney. The latter
touched 0:50 a number of times last
season and with Ager, Price, and Extra,
should make a fast relay team.
Money is the only entrant in the 880
but has improved his times of 2:02 last
year and is said to be getting under 2
minutes. If so he will give Swayne a
close fight for first place, since Richard
son will probably not run his regular
event.
Kelsey, who placed second to Role in
the Conference high hurdles and fourth
in the lows, is again entered in both
events. Dole surprised everyone by his
time of 0:15 5-10 in the highs and as
Kelsey was close behind him the two
may fight it out again Saturday for sec
ond place—Leistner being favored for
first.
Kelsey also pole vaults around 11 feet
6 inches and broad jumps 22 feet.
Flanagan is the other entry in the broad
jump and may make a bid for first place
with past records in that event of 22 feet
8 inches. He did not high jump last sea
son but has been reaching 5 feet 11
inches this year.
Spearow of Oregon is not entered this
season but Eby, who tied with Kemmit
zer of Stanford for second place in the
high jump, is back again and will seek to
give his rival good competition. Both
men have been doing around 5 feet 11
inches.
Hayward, as well as Templeton, has a
"Tiny" in the weight events but his name
is Johnsou. His throws in the discus
average-around 135 with Mautz putting
the shot out 40 feet.

A school has been started in London
to teach bachelors how to cook
Coach "Bill" Hay ward and his Web
footers from the University of Oregon
will arrive in Palo Alto at 2:17 Friday

year and is said to be getting under 2
minutes. If so he will give Swayne a
close fight for first place, since Richard
son will probably not run his regular
event.
Kelsey, who placed second to Role in
the Conference high hurdles and fourth
in the lows, is again entered in both
events. Dole surprised everyone by his
time of 0:15 5-10 in the highs and as
Kelsey was close behind him the two
may fight it out again Saturday for sec
ond place—Leistner being favored for
first.
Kelsey also pole vaults around 11 feet
6 inches and broad jumps 22 feet.
Flanagan is the other entry in the broad
jump and may make a bid for first place
with past records in that event of 22 feet
8 inches. He did not high jump last sea
son but has been reaching 5 feet 11
inches this year.
Spearow of Oregon is not entered this
season but Eby, who tied with Kemmit
zer of Stanford for second place in the
high jump, is back again and will seek to
give his rival good competition. Both
men have been doing around 5 feet 11
inches.
Hayward, as well as Templeton, has a
"Tiny" in the weight events but his name
is Johnsou. His throws in the discus
average-around 135 with Mautz putting
the shot out 40 feet.

A school has been started in London
to teach bachelors how to cook
Coach "Bill" Hay ward and his Web
footers from the University of Oregon
will arrive in Palo Alto at 2:17 Friday
for their meet with Stanford next Satur
day.
The northerners are coming to engage
R. L. Templeton's tracksters in the for
mer's first intercollegiate meet of the
season and will therefore be handicapped
by inexperience. Only twelve men are to
make the journey but it is thought that
Templeton will not have to limit his
entry list as was done in the Nebraska
contest.
The Webfooters are Pacific Coast Con
ference champions, by Virtue of their first
place in the Conference meet May 31,
1924. They annexed the title with 37
points; Washington being sceond with
36 while Stanford's second team tied
with. Oregon Agricultural College for
third place with 27 points each.
Captain Rosenberg is one of the stars
of the aggregation. This is his second
year of varsity experience and he spe
cializes in three field events —broad jump,
pole vault, and javelin. His best marks
in the jump event range around 22 feet
with 12 feet in the pole vault. In both,
he should give Weeks, Macßae and Sco
field little trouble. He has been tossing
the javelin out around 175 and 180 feet,
and took second to Evers in the Con
ference meet.
Three sprinsters who have been turn
ing in fast times will run the dashes for
the northerners. Westerman does the
hundred in 0:10 1-5 with Hold running
about the same time. Extra, who is in
his first year of varsity competition,
seems to be promising material with 0:22
3-5 in tiie 220 and around 0:52 for the
quarter. He will also enter the broad
jump.
Hayward lias two of his 440 and relay
men back who competed in the Confer
ence meet —Ager and Kinney. The latter
touched 0:50 a number of times last
season and with Ager, Price, and Extra,
should make a fast relay team.
Money is the only entrant in the 880
but has improved his times of 2:02 last
year and is said to be getting under 2
minutes. If so he will give Swayne a
close fight for first place, since Richard
son will probably not run his regular
event.
