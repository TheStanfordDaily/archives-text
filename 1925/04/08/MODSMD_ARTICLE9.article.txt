# A. T. O. WINS FROM ENCINA III NINE 5-3
## 
### 
Alpha Tau Omega's baseball team won
a victory over Encina 111 in the second
day of intramural baseball competition
yesterday afternoon. The final count left
the Row nine on the long end of a 5 to
3 score.
Walt Woods, pitching for the A. T.
O's, hurled excellent ball, retired fifteen
batters by the strike-out route. Christ
pitched a fairly good game for the En
cina team, but had two bad innings, the
first and third. He walked the first two
batters, and then allowed two hits, letting
the A. T. O's score two runs in the first.
Encina counted for one run in the first
iru'ing, and two in the third, due to the
timOiy batting of Pabst and Price.
El Tigre easily defeated El Toro in a
ragged game, 8 to'O. El Tigre's big fac
tor in winning was the stellar mound
work o ; Newton, who struck out twelve
players, and allowed but two hits. The
contest was marked by a number of bad
errors, both teams being frequent offend
ers. Newton also captured batting hon
ors, connecting for three safeties in four
trips to the plate.
Phi Sigma Kappa trounced Theta Del
ta Chi in another one-sided fiasco, emerg
ing victorious by a count of 6 to 0.
Hawkins, pitching for the Phi Sigs, kept
up the precedent established by other
intramural twirlers, by fanning sixteen
of the Theta Delta batters. He was also
tight with base hits, letting his opponents
down with three scattered blows.
The Phi Sigs had little difficulty hit
ting Graves ,the Theta Delt hurler. The
winners broke into the scoring column in
the first inning as a result of three con
jsecutive two baggers, accounting for two
runs. Two more were obtained in the
third by means of two hits and two
errors. The Phi Sigs completed the
I scoring by chalking up two more runs in
| the fourth.
The other game scheduled for yester
; day afternoon was between the Union
j and Branner teams, but the failure of
| the Union nine to appear caused the con
gest to be forfeited in favor of Branner.
