Frocks of Charm, $39.50, $49.50, up
Everything that is spring-like and youthful goes to make up the beauty of these
new dresses. Printed and single-shade silks use lace, flaring fronts, wide and
narrow pleats, to create frocks of flattering grace.
Youthful Coats are $55 and more
Satin and faille, charmeen and kasha weaves—such is the Spring story of coat
fabrics. Some are simply tailored with velvet collars—others banded with long
haired fur—in Spring blues and greens, natural and tan shades, navy and black.
Ensemble Costumes, $55, $69.50 up
The latest ensemble has a short box coat —as illustrated—with scarf collar and
one-piece frock with inverted pleats. In charmeen, $55. Ensembles with the
longer coats and smart silk frocks range up from $69.50.
