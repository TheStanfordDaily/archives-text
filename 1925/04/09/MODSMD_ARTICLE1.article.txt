# CARD POWER TO BE RESTRICTED AGAINST OREGON
## Templeton to Hold Distance Men in Check; Miller Entered in 220

For the second time this season,
Coach R. L. Templeton will hold his
star runners in check when the Card
tracksters meet Oregon Saturday in
the stadium.
Against the Olympic Club, the first
meet of the year, Templeton limited
the distances of a number of men to
avoid over-exertion.When the Nebraska
meet arrived the entire team needed

will be similar to the one in the
Olympic Club contest —the Big Meet
being but seven days away and every
man already in good trim.
All the runners affected by Temple
ton's limitation have not been decided
upon but they will probably include
Miller, Richardson, Kerr, Charles, and
Leistner.
Miller, who is expected to be the
backbone of the quarter-mile team and
relay against California, has been in

a comparative rest for the first time
by entering the 220. He has run this
distance only several times but with
a natural sprint should clip it off in
•close to 0:22 1-5.
With him will be Gaspar, Adams,
Campbell, and possibly Hartranft, al
though the latter may concentrate on
his regular distance, the century. On
a dry track it would not be surprising
to see Gaspar take a good lead in the
