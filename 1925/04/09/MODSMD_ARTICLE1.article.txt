# CARD POWER TO BE RESTRICTED AGAINST OREGON
## Templeton to Hold Distance Men in Check; Miller Entered in 220 
### Douglas Meservey 
For the second time this season,
Coach R. L. Templeton will hold his
star runners in check when the Card
tracksters meet Oregon Saturday in
the stadium.
Against the Olympic Club, the first
meet of the year, Templeton limited
the distances of a number of men to
avoid over-exertion.When the Nebraska
meet arrived the entire team needed
a good workout, however, and the dis
tance men were all run in their regu
lar events. This Saturday the situation
will be similar to the one in the
Olympic Club contest —the Big Meet
being but seven days away and every
man already in good trim.
All the runners affected by Temple
ton's limitation have not been decided
upon but they will probably include
Miller, Richardson, Kerr, Charles, and
Leistner.
Miller, who is expected to be the
backbone of the quarter-mile team and
relay against California, has been in
fine condition all season and will take
a comparative rest for the first time
by entering the 220. He has run this
distance only several times but with
a natural sprint should clip it off in
•close to 0:22 1-5.
With him will be Gaspar, Adams,
Campbell, and possibly Hartranft, al
though the latter may concentrate on
his regular distance, the century. On
a dry track it would not be surprising
to see Gaspar take a good lead in the
furlong and hold it. It must be remem
bered that his poor showings in the
last two meets have been made on a
wet track, a fact which always handi
caps a sprinter of small stature.
Campbell's performance is more
speculative than that of the other run
ners, due to his lack of recent prac
tice. His good finish in the hundred
against Nebraska is somewhat indica
tive, however, that he is getting into
his old form and if so should make
even Miller step out.
Miller's absence in the quarter will
be filled by Richardson, who will de
sert his regular event, the 880. The
latter has been running some fast
practice laps the past week and, if he
feels in good condition Saturday, may
