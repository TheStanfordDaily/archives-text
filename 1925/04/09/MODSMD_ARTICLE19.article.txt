# SPORTS BALLOTS GIVE TRACK LEAD OVER BASKETBALL
## Baseball Forces Tennis Out of Fourth Place After Yesterday's Vote 
### 
Track nosed basketball out of sec
ond place in the voting yesterday
made in the Daily Palo Alto's straw
ballot to determine the most popular
sports on the campus. After apparently
cinching second place according to the
results of the first day's balloting
basketball lost by a close margin
while track moved up to press foot
ball which now holds a lead practi
cally undisputable.
Tennis dropped to fifth place after
heavy voting for baseball was made.
Baseball has only a small lead over
the net sport but another day or two
like yesterday and it will have fourth
place cinched.
Other changes in the arrangement of
the favorites were the moving of polo
to seventh place from eighth, while
soccer and boxing are practically tied
for eighth place with boxing having a
slight edge. This is the first time that
boxing has been in the running.
Organized efforts by the backers of
several of the sports are now being
made to get several of the sports defi
nitely in the first eight. The most
bitter clash is perhaps that between
baseball and tennis, while golf ad
herents are fighting to get their sport
under the wire at all even though it
be eighth place.
Following is the list of the sports
as they ranked, first, after two hours
of voting; second, at the end of the
first day, and third, the rating at the
end of the second day:
Ist 2nd 3rd Sport
111 Football
