# BABE TRACK MEN WIN MEET FROM BRUINS, 75-56
## Sweeps in Broad Jump and Javelin Give '28 Third Major Sport Win 
### Wilbur Adams 
i By making clean sweeps in the
I broad jump and the javelin throw —
! the last two field events on the pro
! gram—the Stanford freshmen succeed
ed in forging ahead and won the an
j nual track meet from California in
j Berkeley yesterday. The final score
j stood 75 to 56.
i The Berkeley track was in poor con-
I dition and the times were consequent
:ly slow. This victory in track gives
the 1928 class every major sport so
[ far this year, as well as all the minor
sport events.
Captain Nichols was the high point
man for the Cardinal babes with 10
points to his credit. Rhoeig and Phil
ips of California also took two first
places, each tying Nichols for high
point honors of the meet. Nichols had
an easy time yesterday, winning both
hurille events with yards to spare.
Bullis and Bly, Stanford's other hurd
lers, both placed, giving the Cards 14
points in the two hurdle races.
The high jump was won by King of
Stanford with a jump of 6 feet 1 inch.
King won the event with his sweat
clothes on, only removing them in an
effort to break the record in the event.
The quarter-mile proved to be the
most exciting race of the day. Abram
son of Stanford, who was doped to
win, took the lead at the start and was
five yards ahead at 350 yards. Abram
son misjudged the finish and, thinking
the 350-yard mark was the end of the
race, he stopped. The rest of the run
ners continued and Talbot of Califor
nia nosed McGuire, the next Stanford
man, out of first place by inches. Bor
den took third for Stanford.
The two distance events went to
Stanford, Ranney winning the mile and
Nelson capturing the two-mile. Ranney
also placed second in the 880. Nelson
pulled an A1 Charles in the eighth lap
of the two-mile run, when he caught
up and passed his opponents with an
unusually fast sprint for a distant man.
He broke the tape ten yards ahead of
his teammat, Collins. Collins took an
other second place in the mile.
The sprints were won by the Cali
fornia freshmen's captain, Rhoeig.
Worthington and Burton of Stanford
placed second and third respectively
in the century, and Worthington also
captured a place in the 220-yard dash.
"California won both shot and discus
yesterday afternoon from Bigelow and
Weaver, the Stanford weight men. But
the yearlings came back in the javelin
throw. Stanley, Joaquin, and Millage
1 1-2 inch won the broad jump. Dyer
took second and Salsman tallied an
other point for Stanford with a third.

Captain Nichols was the high point
man for the Cardinal babes with 10
points to his credit. Rhoeig and Phil
ips of California also took two first
places, each tying Nichols for high
point honors of the meet. Nichols had
an easy time yesterday, winning both
hurille events with yards to spare.
Bullis and Bly, Stanford's other hurd
lers, both placed, giving the Cards 14
points in the two hurdle races.
The high jump was won by King of
Stanford with a jump of 6 feet 1 inch.
King won the event with his sweat
clothes on, only removing them in an
effort to break the record in the event.
The quarter-mile proved to be the
most exciting race of the day. Abram
son of Stanford, who was doped to
win, took the lead at the start and was
five yards ahead at 350 yards. Abram
son misjudged the finish and, thinking
the 350-yard mark was the end of the
race, he stopped. The rest of the run
ners continued and Talbot of Califor
nia nosed McGuire, the next Stanford
man, out of first place by inches. Bor
den took third for Stanford.
The two distance events went to
Stanford, Ranney winning the mile and
Nelson capturing the two-mile. Ranney
also placed second in the 880. Nelson
pulled an A1 Charles in the eighth lap
of the two-mile run, when he caught
up and passed his opponents with an
unusually fast sprint for a distant man.
He broke the tape ten yards ahead of
his teammat, Collins. Collins took an
other second place in the mile.
The sprints were won by the Cali
fornia freshmen's captain, Rhoeig.
Worthington and Burton of Stanford
placed second and third respectively
in the century, and Worthington also
captured a place in the 220-yard dash.
"California won both shot and discus
yesterday afternoon from Bigelow and
Weaver, the Stanford weight men. But
the yearlings came back in the javelin
throw. Stanley, Joaquin, and Millage
1 1-2 inch won the broad jump. Dyer
took second and Salsman tallied an
other point for Stanford with a third.

win, took the lead at the start and was
five yards ahead at 350 yards. Abram
son misjudged the finish and, thinking
the 350-yard mark was the end of the
race, he stopped. The rest of the run
ners continued and Talbot of Califor
nia nosed McGuire, the next Stanford
man, out of first place by inches. Bor
den took third for Stanford.
The two distance events went to
Stanford, Ranney winning the mile and
Nelson capturing the two-mile. Ranney
also placed second in the 880. Nelson
pulled an A1 Charles in the eighth lap
of the two-mile run, when he caught
up and passed his opponents with an
unusually fast sprint for a distant man.
He broke the tape ten yards ahead of
his teammat, Collins. Collins took an
other second place in the mile.
The sprints were won by the Cali
fornia freshmen's captain, Rhoeig.
Worthington and Burton of Stanford
placed second and third respectively
in the century, and Worthington also
captured a place in the 220-yard dash.

yesterday afternoon from Bigelow and
Weaver, the Stanford weight men. But

i By making clean sweeps in the
I broad jump and the javelin throw —
! the last two field events on the pro
! gram—the Stanford freshmen succeed
ed in forging ahead and won the an
j nual track meet from California in
j Berkeley yesterday. The final score
j stood 75 to 56.
i The Berkeley track was in poor con-
I dition and the times were consequent
:ly slow. This victory in track gives
the 1928 class every major sport so
[ far this year, as well as all the minor
sport events.
