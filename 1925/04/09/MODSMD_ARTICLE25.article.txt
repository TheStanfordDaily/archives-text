In a college community there are few functions of such general and
profound interest as commencement. Friends of the university, as well
as the horde of friends and relatives of the graduates, are vitally interested
in seeing the veterans of the four years' battle receive their awards —at $5
per award. It is unfortunate that the Memorial Church, where the exer
cises are ordinarily held, is so limited in space that only a small proportion
of those who desire to attend can gain admittance.
In dignity, in added solemnity and color, the Memorial Church is su
perior to any other place in which the exercises might be held. The beauty
of an affair which they were unable to witness cannot mean much to those
who find themselves unable to get admission slips. Would it not be better
to admit all those interested in the grauation, even at the sacrifice of what
impressive qualities are added by the church services.
The logical spot for the ceremonies is the stadium. That the great
horseshoe may be made rarely beautiful, a fitting spot for whatever type
of ceremony, was demonstrated in the staging of the operas there three
years ago. Last year the proposal was made for holding the commence
ment in the stadium, but was discarded when the Board of Athletic Control
announced that it would make a rental charge of $400 for this purpose.
Whether or not it be desirable that the exercises be held there, it seems
strange that so large an amount should be asked as rent. Logically, of
course, the students owe more to the university than the university owes
its students. And yet —the university, in justice to itself, does owe its
students fitting graduation ceremonies. The sum of $400 is a large amount
to the senior class; it is of no such importance to so large and powerful an
organization as the Board of Athletic Control. It would be only courteous
to turn the stadium over to the university for this purpose, if its use is
desired. To ask any such extortionate rent, particularly at a time when
the stadium cannot possibly be needed for any other purpose, smacks un
pleasantly of a rather small commercial spirit, and adds nothing whatever
to the prestige and popularity of that marvelous institution, the Board of
Athletic Control. —D. L.
