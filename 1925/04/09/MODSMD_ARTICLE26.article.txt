# Stadium Enlargement

### 
Whether the Stanford stadium will be enlarged for the 1925 Big Game
will be decided by the Board of Athletic Control at its meeting this week.
When thousands were turned away from the California Memorial
bowl last November, the Stanford authorities began considering the pos
sibility of enlarging the Stanford plant to accommodate a larger crowd.
Shirley Baker, an engineer, was asked to draw up plans and submitted
twenty-four different schemes to the Board for acceptance.
The board had previously allotted $450,000 for the remodelling of the
stadium but, upon looking over the various plans, decided that it would
be impractical to alter the stadium unless such changes were made as would
be lasting for many years. The only plan which seemed acceptable under
this view was the one calling for an expenditure of more than one-half a
million dollars. Should this be accepted the open end of the horseshoe
will be filled in and the entire structure raised to hold fourteen more tiers
of seats. The seating capacity will then be 90,000. The Ixxird at its next
meeting will decide whether it is wise to make the change for the 1925
game, or whether it should be made in 192/* or 1929. s
The board is to be commended upon its plan of not altering the stadium
until permanent changes can be made. It would be foolish to erect tem
porary stands for the next game, which would only have to be torn down
in a few years, since attendance is certain to increase with each succeeding
year. The only logical way of changing the stadium is to wait until Stan
ford has enough money or enough credit to do a job that will make the
stadium a credit to the university and this seems to be the plan the board
will adopt. —W. W. K.
