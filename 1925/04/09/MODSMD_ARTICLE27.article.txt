# TRYOUTEES MEET TOMORROW afternoon at 1 o'clock
## ANOTHER VIEWPOINT 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
On Friday afternoon, April 10, there
will be aji inspection and review of
the Stanford R. O. T. C. Unit. With
about ten per cent of the men at the
University enrolled in this unit it is l
a student activity that, as far as [
participation is concerned, ranks high
er than most sports and other activi
ties. This is as it should be because
in the maintenance of a military organi
zation Stanford, in common with many
other universities, is meeting a na-j
tional obligation by training officers
for emergencies and defense.
The inspection on Friday, made by
officers sent by the War Department |
in Washington, will determine Stan
ford's rating among the other univer
sities of the country. There will be a j

1 better showing if the unit receives en-
I couragement and support by a large
attendance at the exercises on the
part of the student body. I hope par
ticularly that men engaged and inter
ested in athletics will so far as they
are able show their interest in this
sister activity by being present. The
unit deserves our support and those
who go will be well repaid by an inter
esting exhibition. â€”W. H. Barrow.
