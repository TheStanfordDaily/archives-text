Skipper turned his eyes to the stairs.
I "Val!" he exclaimed in amazement,
j "How did you do it? Perfect!"
I "Skipper! Don't I always look pret
j ty?"_
| "I'll say you do, but tonight you look
prettier."
"Same old Skipper," laughed Val, as
jhe held an exquisite evening coat
ready for her graceful arms. "Is the
car ready?"
"It is, my queen."
"Be serious, boy."
"I can tonight."
"Good. Please try. There's only one
Senior Ball, you know."
"Only one," he repeated, "and I
guess it's the last one we will go to—
I to—, as seniors." They entered the car
| and Skipper took the wheel. "And how
| about Santa Claus? Is she going to be
| serious, too?"
"Let's call time out on the mellow
drama until it's absolutely necessary,"
said the man, as he put the car in
motion. "What have you been doing
with yourself?"
"I've been diligently wasting my
time reading a rather foolish novel."
"About what?"
"I hardly think you'd care for the
story. It was about a man who would
n't marry the girl he loved because of
her money. Finally, after a lot of dis
gusting bunk, she came down to his
level of the social world, and they
lived happily every after. Don't drive
so fast."
"I'll say you've been wasting your
time," said Skipper as he eased up on
the throttle. "W r ho wrote the darn
thing?"
"I don't remember her name."
"It was a she, then?"
"I think so."
"Sounds just like a woman. They
do turn out impossible stories."
"That's not impossible."
"The deuce you say! I can't feature
any of these wealthy flapettes work
ing for love. Love is a beautiful ideal,
my dear but eating——!"
"You're getting more sophisticated
every dav." she replied. "Suppose you
drive a little faster."
"You just told me to slow down."
"Well, I didn't tell you to play snail."
"Let's not fight. We can't afford to
do that for awhile. The Ingersoll beats
too rapidly, and . Say, did you know.
I had a good job offered me?"
"You're right, Skipper. We mustn't
have any trouble tonight."
"We never have, Val, and I don't see
why we should."
"We've certainly had three wonder
ful years," continued the girl. "'Three
years with youth at the prow and
pleasure at the helm,' and I hope we'll
go right on being friends," she said
slowly, and without hesitation, fear, or
the slightest suggestion of coyness,
she placed her hand on his as it rested
on the wheel.
"Hell!" exclaimed Skipper under his
breath before he spoke to her. "Val,
you've been a good pal and, I hope
that 1 want you "

Skipper turned his eyes to the stairs.
I "Val!" he exclaimed in amazement,
j "How did you do it? Perfect!"
I "Skipper! Don't I always look pret
j ty?"_
| "I'll say you do, but tonight you look
prettier."
"Same old Skipper," laughed Val, as
jhe held an exquisite evening coat
ready for her graceful arms. "Is the
car ready?"
"It is, my queen."
"Be serious, boy."
"I can tonight."
"Good. Please try. There's only one
Senior Ball, you know."
"Only one," he repeated, "and I
guess it's the last one we will go to—
I to—, as seniors." They entered the car
| and Skipper took the wheel. "And how
| about Santa Claus? Is she going to be
| serious, too?"
"Let's call time out on the mellow
drama until it's absolutely necessary,"
said the man, as he put the car in
motion. "What have you been doing
with yourself?"
"I've been diligently wasting my
time reading a rather foolish novel."
"About what?"
"I hardly think you'd care for the
story. It was about a man who would
n't marry the girl he loved because of
her money. Finally, after a lot of dis
gusting bunk, she came down to his
level of the social world, and they
lived happily every after. Don't drive
so fast."
"I'll say you've been wasting your
time," said Skipper as he eased up on
the throttle. "W r ho wrote the darn
thing?"
"I don't remember her name."
"It was a she, then?"
"I think so."
"Sounds just like a woman. They
do turn out impossible stories."
"That's not impossible."
"The deuce you say! I can't feature
any of these wealthy flapettes work
ing for love. Love is a beautiful ideal,
my dear but eating——!"
"You're getting more sophisticated
every dav." she replied. "Suppose you
drive a little faster."
"You just told me to slow down."
"Well, I didn't tell you to play snail."
"Let's not fight. We can't afford to
do that for awhile. The Ingersoll beats
too rapidly, and . Say, did you know.
I had a good job offered me?"
"You're right, Skipper. We mustn't
have any trouble tonight."
"We never have, Val, and I don't see
why we should."
"We've certainly had three wonder
ful years," continued the girl. "'Three
years with youth at the prow and
pleasure at the helm,' and I hope we'll
go right on being friends," she said
slowly, and without hesitation, fear, or
the slightest suggestion of coyness,
she placed her hand on his as it rested
on the wheel.
"Hell!" exclaimed Skipper under his
breath before he spoke to her. "Val,
you've been a good pal and, I hope
that 1 want you "
