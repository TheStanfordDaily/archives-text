V. G. D. <t>f
All inane—and ultimately harmful
—criticisms of University affairs that
are printed are, nine times out of ten,
written by a student with too. much
sleep and too little exercise.
This is true not only in college. This
by a foremost American critic:
"Moliere was a Scandinavian sculp
tor whose masterpiece, 'Tristan and
Isolde," was hung in the Louvre in
1894," said a jackass.
"I doubt it," replied a bystander.
"Chronic dissenter!" sneered the
jackass.
From the "D. P. A." of April 7th:
"A zoology professor at the University
of Washington has for pets two living
sponges."
How many fathers can say the
same? ,
"Smoking is permitted at Vassar."
"No, the report is false!" No, it isn't.
Yes it is
Isn't "permission" odd, at times?
No wonder the English have the
sense of humor for which they are
notorious. Living in a perpetual fog—
like that upon us now—would cramp
even the finest "American joke," and
make it slow to dawn.
Again criticism: this concerning
Mencken might be applied to a daily
growing number:
"Now I ask you: what could be more
harmless in a land of bunk than a
Mr. Mencken? A bunkist of sorts him
self, he is the best man to set on the
trail of other bunk." Well. Well. Well.
"And the night shall be filled with
comfort,
And the cares with which it begun
Shall fold up their blankets like
Indians,
And silently cut and run."
Yes, that which you know will never
happen, always does, for which, with
all reverence, we say "Thank God."
