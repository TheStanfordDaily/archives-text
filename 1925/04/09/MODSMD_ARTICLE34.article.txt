# California Glee Club to Give Recital on Campus
## 
### 
On Friday, the 17th, the Glee Club
of the University of California will bo
heard in recital on the campus. The
California singers are known as being
entertainers of the first class and as
being well-trained singers. Much in
terest is expected from Palo Alto and
surrounding towns as well as from
the campus for this event.

clip a part of a second off of Miller's
time of 0:48 3-5.
It is the second and third place men
of the Cardinal team in the quarter
who templeton will watch more close
ly, however, than Richardson. These
men will be Doerr, Babcock, and Carl
smith. Upon them will be the burden
of filling two places in the relay which
may decide the Big Meet. Smith has
also been running some fast quarter
miles and will possibly be used in both
the mile and relay, not only against
Oregon, but California.
It is quite probable that Kerr will
not run the mile, but whether he will
enter the 880 in Richardson's place or
the two-mile in Charles' absence, is
uncertain. Templeton believes he is
capable of at least a third in the two
mile, although he has not finished the
eight laps in the last two meets.
Templeton will also be on the look
out for possible second and third
places in the 880, mile, and two-mile.
Swayne will run his regular race in
the 880 and it is up to him to show
if he can beat out Boyden and Chase
of California by placing first against
Oregon. McClellan is a possible "fol
low-up" man in the two-mile and Smith
has a good chance to beat out Schwo
beda of California for third in the
mile, or even Ross for second. Both
of the Card runners will have to
stretch out this Saturday, however,

and show fast times to figure in on
the "dope" for the Big Meet.
Charles, who will not compete in
the two-mile this Saturday, will run
either with Swayne in the 880 or with
Smith in the mile. In either case it is
improbable that he will attempt to win
but rather to set a pace for his team
mate.
Lelstner, who has been improving
steadily throughout the year, will leave
the hurdles for the sprints. Dole,
Wells, and Heston will then be left
to face the Oregon hurdlers and give
Templeton a line on which one is
most likely to place in the Big Meet.
Leistner should give both Becker and
Aldrette plenty of competition for
first place but Templeton believes that
either Dole or Wells may show un
expected speed and finish "in the
money."
