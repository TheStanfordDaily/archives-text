# HOT, HOT CROSS BUNS IN GOOD FRIDAY SALE TOMORROW MORNING
## 
### 
Hot cross buns for breakfast may
be obtained tomorrow morning at the
bargain price of ten cents each, when
Theta Sigma Phi celebrates Good Fri
day by a sale to be held in front of
the Women's Clubhouse.
Opening at 8 o'clock and lasting as
long as the bans do, students who
have allowed life to rob them of par
ticipation in this quaint old custom
will have an opportunity to make up
for past omissions.
Theta Sigma Phi promises that the
hot cross buns will be hot!
