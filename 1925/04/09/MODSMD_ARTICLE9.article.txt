# KAPPA SIGMA BEATS ENCINA NINE IN RAGGED TILT
## Sequoia, Breakers, and Zetes Take Other First-Round Intramural Games 
### 
Ragged fielding and poor pitching
| featured the third day's games in the
I intramural ball series. Kappa Sigma,
â€¢ University champions last year, made
an unimpressive showing in defeating
Encina Second, 8 to 5. Other games
were: Sequoia 16, Alpha Sigma Phi 7;
Breakers 10, El Cuadro 5. Zeta Psi
won from the Independents by default.
Nye, the freshman hurler, had the
j edge oover Moore of the Kappa Sigs,
I but his support was woefully weak,
slipping especially in the second and
[ fourth innings. Each team made one
I run in the first frame, but by the end
|of the fourth the Kappa Sigs had a
lead which was not threatened until
the last of the seventh.
The fourth was Kappa Sigs' big in
ning. Two walks, a hit by Mann, and
two errors by the freshman catcher
gave the fraternity men three runs.
Nye came near tying the game for
himself when he brought in two run
ners in the last of the seventh by a
timely hit, but the game ended soon
after when McGinn flied out.
Sequoia, winner of one of the
leagues last year, had an easy time !
with the Alpha Sig nine. Prior, the
Sequoia pitcher, was in complete con
trol at all times, and until he was
jerked in the seventh when Sequoia
was 14 runs ahead, he had allowed
but two runs. His control was good,;
but he was not forced to bear down to
any great extent.
Breakers won from El Cuadro by
making fewer errors. They committed
three while their opponents were mak- j
ing six. Harris, El Cuadro pitcher, al-!
lowed six hits, while the Breaker hurl
er allowed but three and struck out I
II men. The hitting on both sides was j
weak, Glade of Breakers being high i
point man with two safe blows out:
of four trips to bat. and most of the
runs were made on errors.
