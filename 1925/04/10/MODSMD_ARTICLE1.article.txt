# BASEBALL ENTERS SECOND POSITION IN D. P. A. VOTING
## Net Game Drops to Sixth as Swimming Gains; Vote Closes Sunday 
### 
Baseball with over a hundred votes for
first and second places slipped past track
yesterday to press football, which still
leads by a good margin in the Daily Palo
Alto's straw vote to determine the most
popular sports on the campus. Tennis,
which at first was an easy favorite for
fourth place, went down to sixth and
swimming advanced to fifth.
The balloting will close at five o'clock
Sunday and complete results for all the
voting will be published in Monday's
D. P. A. This vote is being taken merely
to determine the popular will of the stu
dents at large in event of any action in
volving alteration of the present system
of athletic awards.
The results of the balloting thus far
are as follows. The first column contains
a ranking of the sports after the first two
hours of voting Tuesday morning, second
column, final results Tuesday, third, final
results of Wednesday, and fourth, yester
day's results.

Strenuous efforts to get baseball in first
place if possible or at least to cinch it a
place among the first four sports are
being made by diamond fans. This sport
seems especially popular at the dormi- j
tories. Polo has a strong group of sup- j
porters and from all appearances it will
be in seventh place in the final rating.
The predicted golf landslide has not j
been forthcoming. Golf was in eighth j
place only once and in the rating yester- i
day weight basketball and wrestling both j
passed it.
If soccer gets the support today that it j
has had for the past two days it will
undoubtedly cinch eighth place. Boxing
may challenge it today but the possibility
is very slight as there lias been but little
promoting of the ring game.
Approximately five hundred votes were
cast by six o'clock yesterday and an-!
other hundred and fifty are expected be-1
fore the polls close Sunday. All ballots j
cast in this poll must be signed.
