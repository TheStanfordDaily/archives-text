# PROM TICKET SALE SLATED APRIL 14, 15
## 
### 
In order to make the Junior Prom an
affair entirely for upperclassmen, P. J.
Meyers, general chairman of the Prom,
has adopted a set of rules to govern the
sale of the 300 tickets. The sale will be
held in the Administration building from
| 11 to 5 o'clock Tuesday and Wednesday.
I One hundred pasteboards for the Cordu
j roy Ball at $1 each will be sold at the
; same time.
On the first day only juniors will be
able to secure tickets, and on the follow
ing day seniors and holdovers will have
a chance to obtain the remaining paste
boards, which will cost $5 each. Each
student must present his student body
card, must sign for the tickets, and must
have paid his class dues, according to the
announcement made by Meyers.
Only 300 tickets Tor the ball are being
put on sale this year because of the re
duced floor space in the pavilion. The
added bleachers and the orchestra stand
have taken away from the capacity for
a dance. Tickets will be made non-trans
ferable so that only upperclass men may
attend. In order to make this system
work efficiently, all purchasers will be
required to sign the tickets.
Junior class dues can be paid at the
time Prom tickets are purchased, or can
be paid before then by getting in touch
with S. C. Cypher, class treasurer.
Leslie Kiler has been secured by J. PI.
Graves, chairman of the decoration com
mittee, to design a setting in which the
Japanese motif will predominate. Kiler
has executed scenery for many of the
campus shows and is working on some
unique and striking sets for the Prom.
The programs for the dance, according
to F. L. Matthar, chairman of the pro
gram committee, will be of a novel de
sign and will be finely printed.
