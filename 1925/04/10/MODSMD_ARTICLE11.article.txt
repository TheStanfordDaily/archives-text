# PHI KAPPA SIGMA NINE BEATS LOS ARCOS IN FAST GAME
## 
### 
| Phi Kappa Sigma defeated Los Arcos
| in the best ball game played in yester-
I day afternoon's intramural contests. Good
i pitching and excellent fielding were the
outstanding features of the game. The
result was in doubt until the last ball had
been pitched, the Phi Kaps finally emerg
ing with a 3 to 0 decision over the club
team.
The game, as has been the case with
nearly all the games so far this season,
j was especially marked by a large number
| of strikeouts. Hamilton, twirling for Los
1 Arcos, and Coen, the Phi Kaps' mounds-
I man, both were credited with fanning
j fourteen batters.
The fraternity team's first tally came
! in the initial inning when Hinckle scored
j v
j Coen on a two base hit. Coen started oft
I the third frame with a triple and was
! advanced to home on Wright's single.
| Coen connected for his third hit of the
I day, a two bagger, in the fifth, and was
[scored by Wright's triple. Coen was the
j individual star of the game, getting three
! hits out of three times up, in addition to
I pitching air tight ball.
Fiji's Defeat Delta Chi
Phi Gamma Delta had little difficulty
; disposing of Delta Chi, winning by the
! comfortable margin of 7 to 3. Tommy
Grace pitched shut out ball for the Fiji's
until the seventh inning, when lie got a J
! little too liberal with base hits, allowing
the Delta Chi players three runs. The
j loser's only runs were scored by solid
smashes by Frazier, Fritts, and Hay.
The Fijis had their big inning in the
J first, scoring three times on hits tuade
jby Chase, Colvin, Grace, and B lazier.
Two more tallies were chalked up in the
inext frame. Chase reached first on an
error, advanced to second, and then
scored on Blazier's single. Blazier added
another run to his team's score when he
made home on Broenkow's double.
The winners boosted their total to six
runs as a result of Kirwan's double and
Tucker's single in the third. Kirwan also
scored his team's last marker in the fifth,
getting on base on an error, reaching
second when the Delta Cliis booted
Tucker's roller around the lot, and finally
scoring when his opponents erred on
Blazier's grounder.
Dekes Win
Delta Kappa Epsilon encountered prac
tically no opposition in their contest with
the Encina Basement nine. The Dekes
had things their own way throughout the
entire seven innings, triumphing by a 10
to 1 margin.
McDonald exhibited plenty of stuff on
the hill for the Dekes. He fanned thir
teen frosh batters, and allowed but two
scattered hits. The Row sluggers found
Pierce's offerings to their liking and en
joyed seven innings of free hitting. The
real fireworks started in the third, Fuller
led off with a single. Miller also con
nected for a hit, and both runners scored
on Price's two bagger. Ogden brought
Price in with a one base hit, and Graves
finished the scoring for the inning with

a single that gave Ogden his chance to
cross the plate.
The winners kept up the slaughter in
the fourth when Fuller again led off with
a single. Miller and Wheat walked.
Ogden came through with a double,
bringing in two runs. Graves again hit
a single, scoring Ogden for the third run
of the inning.
Fuller smashed out his third hit of the
game in the sixth frame. Miller scored
him with a double and then was himself
scored by Anderson's single. Ogden
drove Anderson in with a single ending
the run-making for the game.
Bryant counted for the freshmen's lone
tally, crossing the plate in the first, after
being helped around the bases by errors
by the Dekes.
The Dekes seem to have one of the
hardest hitting combinations in the
league, and from all indications should
give any intramural nine plenty of com
petition.
Encina IV easily defeated Theta Chi
by the one sided score of 16 to 3. The
freshmen knocked the offerings of
Housli, Theta Chi's pitcher, all over the
lot. The fraternity men are also charged
with a number of errors, which made the
contest more like a track meet than a
baseball game.

The Fijis had their big inning in the

jby Chase, Colvin, Grace, and B lazier.
Two more tallies were chalked up in the
inext frame. Chase reached first on an
error, advanced to second, and then
scored on Blazier's single. Blazier added
another run to his team's score when he
made home on Broenkow's double.
The winners boosted their total to six
runs as a result of Kirwan's double and
Tucker's single in the third. Kirwan also
scored his team's last marker in the fifth,
getting on base on an error, reaching
second when the Delta Cliis booted
Tucker's roller around the lot, and finally

Dekes Win
Delta Kappa Epsilon encountered prac
tically no opposition in their contest with
the Encina Basement nine. The Dekes
had things their own way throughout the
entire seven innings, triumphing by a 10
to 1 margin.
McDonald exhibited plenty of stuff on
the hill for the Dekes. He fanned thir
teen frosh batters, and allowed but two
scattered hits. The Row sluggers found
Pierce's offerings to their liking and en
joyed seven innings of free hitting. The
real fireworks started in the third, Fuller
led off with a single. Miller also con
nected for a hit, and both runners scored
on Price's two bagger. Ogden brought
Price in with a one base hit, and Graves
finished the scoring for the inning with

a single that gave Ogden his chance to
cross the plate.
The winners kept up the slaughter in
the fourth when Fuller again led off with
a single. Miller and Wheat walked.
Ogden came through with a double,
bringing in two runs. Graves again hit
a single, scoring Ogden for the third run
of the inning.
Fuller smashed out his third hit of the
game in the sixth frame. Miller scored
him with a double and then was himself
scored by Anderson's single. Ogden
drove Anderson in with a single ending
the run-making for the game.
Bryant counted for the freshmen's lone
tally, crossing the plate in the first, after
being helped around the bases by errors
by the Dekes.
The Dekes seem to have one of the
hardest hitting combinations in the
league, and from all indications should
give any intramural nine plenty of com
petition.
Encina IV easily defeated Theta Chi
by the one sided score of 16 to 3. The

contest more like a track meet than a
baseball game.

led off with a single. Miller also con
nected for a hit, and both runners scored
on Price's two bagger. Ogden brought
Price in with a one base hit, and Graves
finished the scoring for the inning with

a single that gave Ogden his chance to
cross the plate.
The winners kept up the slaughter in
the fourth when Fuller again led off with
a single. Miller and Wheat walked.
Ogden came through with a double,
bringing in two runs. Graves again hit
a single, scoring Ogden for the third run
of the inning.
Fuller smashed out his third hit of the
game in the sixth frame. Miller scored
him with a double and then was himself
scored by Anderson's single. Ogden
drove Anderson in with a single ending
the run-making for the game.
Bryant counted for the freshmen's lone
tally, crossing the plate in the first, after
being helped around the bases by errors
by the Dekes.
The Dekes seem to have one of the
hardest hitting combinations in the
league, and from all indications should
give any intramural nine plenty of com
petition.
Encina IV easily defeated Theta Chi
by the one sided score of 16 to 3. The
freshmen knocked the offerings of
Housli, Theta Chi's pitcher, all over the
lot. The fraternity men are also charged
with a number of errors, which made the
contest more like a track meet than a
baseball game.
