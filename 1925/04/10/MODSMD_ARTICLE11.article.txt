I the third frame with a triple and was
! advanced to home on Wright's single.
| Coen connected for his third hit of the
I day, a two bagger, in the fifth, and was
[scored by Wright's triple. Coen was the
j individual star of the game, getting three
! hits out of three times up, in addition to
I pitching air tight ball.
