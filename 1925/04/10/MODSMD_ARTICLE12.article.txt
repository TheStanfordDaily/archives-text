# Mosquito Nuisance Abated Diptera Being Slaughtered Pests in Palo Alto Killed
## 
### 
In addition to hurry-call numbers
for the police department for burglars
and the fire department for conflagra
tions, Palo Alto now has one which
will secure help for the riddance of a
far more pernicious evil, the bow
legged mosquito.
Palo Alto 397 is the new number,
and anyone hearing that old home
coming song, "Cousin, cousin, etc., no
relation, no relation," has only to dash
to the nearest phone to get rid of the
pest which told Noah that land had
been sighted.
Under the direction of W. E. Hack
ley, superintendent of the abatement
work in the Matadero Mosquito Dis
trict, the pest has practically been
eliminated from the vicinity of Palo
Alto, Mayfield, and Los Altos. Three
thousand acres of marsh lands have
been drained. All stagnant pools of
water have been oiled regularly or
stocked with top minnows and stickle
backs. With the addition of the Sunny
vale and Mountain View district, the
peninsula â€¢will be drained for protec
tion from San Francisco to Alviso.
Anybody noticing the presence of
the mosquitos is requested to phone
Hackley so that remaining pests may
be exterminated.
