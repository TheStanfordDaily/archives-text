### Douglas Meservey 
Nineteen Webfooters from the Uni-
Iversity of Oregon arrived on the cam
,
pus early yesterday afternoon and pro
! ceeded to jog around the stadium track
i in an effort to loosen their muscles,
j Tomorrow the northerners meet
; Coach R. L. Templeton's tracksters in
the stadium at 2:30 in the latter's last
test before the California contest
! April 18.
The Oregon men appeared to be in
1 good condition and are reported to be
| fit with the exception of Extra, star
1220-man, who is suffering with a
| slight cold. Coach Hayward, grizzled
and noteworthy mentor of the north
ern team, admitted he had little hope
| for an Oregon victory tomorrow, but
believes that a number of his men will
make the Cardinal runners step out \o
| place. Some of the Oregon men are in
uniform this year for the first time,
Campbell's arches are nearly as
strong as ever now and he may step
out to beat both -Miller and Gaspar
in the 220. Hartranft should give him
a fast race in the hundred.
First-place men in most events are
also quite well-known to Templeton as
| far as performances are concerned, but
;it is a question who will take seconds
i and thirds.
Hoffman was the only man besides
| Hartranft entered in the shot and dis
cus last Saturday against Nebraska
'and will probaby follow him in both
I events. Evans has been tossing the
discus around 130 and over this week
and may take a tew laurels. Johnson,
I of Oregon, is the Northerners' only en
| trant in the weights, but is about on
a par with Hoffman in both shot and
discuss with 43 feet and 135 feet his
i best marks.
i Two agreeable surprises were hand
ed Templeton last Wednesday when
Evers tossed the javelin 190 feet and
Shipkey followed him with a mark of
! 177 feet. With such improvement by
both men, Stanford hopes in the jave
line have one up, and the Dodson
brothers of California will have to
! stretch out to beat either of the Cards.
