Mr. Allan E. Charles, Chairman,
Men's Council for Student Control,
Stanford University.
Dear Mr. Charles:
In approving the action of the Men's Council under date of April 8,
1925, covering certain charges against one of the fraternities, I note that
your action was based upon the clause in the lease to the holding company,
which provides as follows:
"It is hereby especially covenanted, agreed and understood that the
sub-tenants, if any, of the lessee, and the occupant and occupants of the
premises hereby demised and the improvements thereon shall at any and
all time and times during the term of this lease be subject to all rules of
discipline and other laws and regulations of every kind that may be at any
time or times prescribed or adopted by the lessor or other Unrversity au
thorities. And it is understood and agreed that if, at any time! or times,
any such sub-tenants, occupant or occupants shall, in the opinion of said
University authorities, be objectionable, or if they shall permit or allow
any disorderly or objectionable conduct on said premises, or in the build
ings erected thereon, the lessee shall and will, on demand, cause all such
sub-tenants and persons to be forthwith removed, dispossessed and evicted
from said premises, and the lessee hereby covenants and agrees to so re
move, dispossessed evict such sub-tenants and persons."
lam approving the action under this clause. In doing so I should also
like to call your attention to the following provision relative to intoxicating
liquors:
"It is hereby expressly covenanted, agreed and understood that no
malt, spirituous or intoxicating liquors of whatever kind shall ever at any
time be sold, kept or used, on the demised premises, and upon a violation
of this covenant this lease shall terminate and become void."
You will note that the lease terminates and becomes void in such cases.
I hope that following the action you have just taken we shall have no
further difficulty. Very truly yours,
(Signed) RAY LYMAN WILBUR, President.
