# Awards For All
## 
### 
There seems to he no separation of athletics and finances. In discus
sing the proposed cut in awards with Graduate Manager Paul Davis, it was
pointed out that the record expenditures of about $1,800 which was re
quired last year is certain to be exceeded this year. An expense of almost
$2,200 is estimated for next year at the present increase. In case that it is
found dsirable to recognize effort in whatever sport, the Board of Athletic
Control may be forced to limit the appropriation for awards.
While the aggregate may be a considerable outlay, nobody can seriously
maintain that the value of the individual awards is comparable to the win
ner's effort. It is of small importance that the successful athlete is given
an $8 sweater with a felt award. It is vastly important that he has the
right to wear it.
In supporting the proposition that every deserving athlete should have
recognition, it should be made clear that we would see him have the right
to wear an insignia.
When Stanford first started, football men insisted that no other
athletes should wear the block "S." They pointed out at that time that
football made more money than anything else. They claimed especial dis
tinction for this reason. It supported, in some part, almost every other
sport. Now five sports get block letters. Shall we call it progress?
To be absolutely consistent, the committee which is to decide between
sports should give block awards only to football menâ€”unless perhaps they
choose to work from a strict bookkeeping basis. In that case they cannot
overlook another money maker, the flock of sheep. The shepherd position
might be thrown open to the English and philosophy departments which
might- appoint a coach to select the varsity poet-thinker. Or the sweater
might be given to the efficient worker already on the job, who, by the way,
would probably be willing to buy his own.
The fencing situation has been cited as an argument against increased
awards. Four men form the varsity team out of a class of about fifty-six
At the California duelling meet only about five of the fifty-two men not
on the team showed up to cheer on their comrades. This is said to be an
evidence of lack of interest. So it is.
It has always been our opinion that Stanford is trying to encourage
sport for all, not all for sport. Fencing may be taken as a sport in which
Americans are not normally wrapped-up. If these fifty-two missing men
did not participate in this it is probabe that they would not compete in any
thing. Any effort from them is probably so much velvet. If awards are
to reflect budgets, these men would not have equipment to practice with.
Instead of making for more interest, as it should, this makes for less
opportunity. Although everybody is invited to play football, not every
body is able to do so. Why shouldn't these men have the equipment to
develop themselves? What if these other sports do lose money ? Is Stan
ford for athletics or athletics for Stanford? Everybody is entitled to op
portunity and recognition for effort, if not in profitable sports, then in
whatever he is able to do.
It is not inconceivable that a three-letter boxer may be a better athlete
than a heavier football substitute. I f awards arc to have relative value,
let the values be exact. But at all events, let everybody have one!

IT lIAS BEEN POINTED OUT by the Graduate Manager that the
editorial in last night's paper concerning the commencement exercises in
the stadium, is not entirely up to date. Mr. Davis announces that his office
reconsidered making a $400 charge for the use of the stadium by the grad
uating class shortly after the original announcement, which was unofficially
made to an individual, not to the 1924 class committee.
