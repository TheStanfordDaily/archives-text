The Editor, Sir:
"University Day brings the alumni
into closer contact with the under
graduate activities." A statement so
abstract as this is undoubtedly cor
rect.
It is possible, however, to point out
some far more concrete results of the
homecoming day of the "old boys"—
results that are in evidence even be
fore the most enthusiastic alumni sets
foot on the campus. Each year at this
time the campus is refreshed —and
this refreshment is not due entirely to
the stimulation of the spring weather.
Things that have been slowly deterior
ating are Bnatched from total ruin and
pass through a stage of rehabilitation.
Last year a plot of ground in front
of Toyon hall was transformed from
a barren waste into a mass of bloom
ing plants and ornamental shrubs. This
year a similar transformation has
taken place in front of the Encina
gymnasium and Branner hall.
What the campus needs more than
A University Day is several University
Days! —New Mark.
