<$> be given the opportunity to con- <$>
<$■ trol the situation, and therefore <$>
<$> recommends: <$>
<$> 1. That President Wilbur in- <$>
<$> struct the holding corporation to <$>
<$> cancel the lease held by their <$>
<8> sub-tenants, the Stanford chapter <$>
of a certain fraternity. <$>
<$> 2. That the property be not <§>
<$> again sublet by the holding cor- <$>
<$> poration except to those members <$>
of the aforementioned fraternity <a>
<$> having good records in the past <s>
<$> and giving assurance of good con- <$>
<$> duct in the future; these members <§>
<$> to be personally agreeable to the <$>
<$> officers or governing body of the <$>
<$> holding corporation, and not to <$> i
<$> be objected to by the Men's Coun- <§> |
<s> cil for Student Control. <$>
<$> 3. That any subsequent change <S>!
