## "Dodson's Hints on Musical Hits" 
### 
Today's Victor record releases prove
Waring's Pennsylvanians a dance or
chestra of versatility par excellence.
They play "At the End of the Road"
with a smooth finish not unlike that
manifested; in Henry Halstead's "Moon
light and Roses."
Then, after your impression is that
they can hardly be excelled at the soft
Schubertian type of fox trot, listen to
their rendition of "When My Sugar
Walks Down the Street." It is high
powered, wicked, exotic, primitive,
sacrilegious, and otherwise low-brow
jazz.
A special release worthy of note is
"I Wouldn't Be Crying Now" played
by Glen Oswald's Serenaders of South
ern California fame. The other side
of the record is "I Ain't Got Nobody
to Love." Both are up-to-the-minute !
and consequently full of pep.
