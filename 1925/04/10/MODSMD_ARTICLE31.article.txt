Skipper threw a quarter on the
counter and walked in the general di
rection of Val's exit. "Hope I didn't
keep you waiting long," she said as she
came toward him.
"Each minute seemed like an hour,"
he replied automatically.
"Skipper, you must learn something
new to say when I make my grand
entrance. It's the same thing every
time." •
"What's the use?"
"You can be so sarcastic when you
want to be. Now cease! Come and play
with me. I want to enjoy this party."
"Skipper! You've driven by the
place. It's back a block."
"Why didn't you tell me?"
"Why didn't you watch?"
"Well, here we are now. Let's not
worry about such dumb things."
Skipper found parking space near
the entrance of the Granada. A tall
footman opened the door for Val, and
escorted them to the entrance. Here
he directed Skipper to the right and
Val to the left. As soon as Skipper
had disposed of his hat and coat, he
sought the cigar counter.
"Strikes," he mumbled. The package
slid across the polished surface, and
Skipper inserted it in his pocket and
turned away.
"Fifteen cents, please?" said the girl
behind the stand.
"Pardon me," drawled Skipper as he
turned to face the keeper. "Didn't I
pay you?"
"No you didn't, and don't pull that
old stuff. You're the third guy to try
it in the last half hour."
Skipper complied with her request
and they entered the Granada ballroom
which had been transferred into a
dazzling bit of the South Sea Islands.
"Leaping linotypes!" exclaimed the
man, "the land of love, liquor, and
laughter. Fix up the court, too?"
"You bet!"
"Your idea?"
"Foolish question!"
"Well, you did a good job. Anyhow,
it doesn't suggest tragedy."
"Why should it?"
"Well, you see "
"There isn't going to be any tragedy
tonight," she inserted.
"I wish I could be as certain about
that as you are."
"Well, why should there be?"
"Because Damn it! The first
dance hasn't even started and here
we are acting like a flock of Greek
philosophers. Let's have action and
forget this stuff."
" 'To have twa minds is as confusing
as twins'," she quoted, and then added,
"Music wasn't made to listen to."
"Right," he voiced, and they began
to dance.
"Weird music, isn't it, Skipper?"
"Nasty flock of saxes," he replied
with a nod. "Recalls sweet memories."
"Sure does!"
"You remember then ?"
Val nodded this time. "It was two
years ago, in this same place, the night
after the game with Baker."
"How did you remember that?"
"How could I forget it. Isn't that the
time you earned the name of Skipper
for the way you ran the team in the
last three minutes? Those last three
minutes." •
"And then," said Skipper, "I found
a girl waiting for me after the game,
and I took her to a dance that night.
I hadn't seen her for several months,
but she was still faithfully waiting."
"Skipper, that was my pleasure. I
remember how proud I felt that night.
I, escorted by Skipper Mowen, the hero
of the day."
"But, Val, the feeling was mutual."
"Do you really mean that, Skipper?"
"I do, Val."
"And suppose that while you neg
-ected me, I forgot all about you, and
when the season was over you found
that I wasn't waiting. How would you
have felt then?"
"Val, I'd have felt that there wasn't
any glory in victory, and that all my
work had brought me nothing. Suppose
that that long pass I called for had
grounded and then I'd failed to con
vert, or what if I'd missed that place
kick? Would you still have been wait
ing for me, Val? I wouldn't have been
a hero, then."
The girl looked down as if afraid to
speak. Finally, she lifted her eyes and
murmured softly, "I would, Skipper."
"W r hy?"
"Because , because . Oh, Skip
per, you never would understand."
"I think I can, Val."
"I'm so glad. I knew you'd realize it
some day."
"Realize it some day! What do "

and I took her to a dance that night.
I hadn't seen her for several months,
but she was still faithfully waiting."
"Skipper, that was my pleasure. I
remember how proud I felt that night.
I, escorted by Skipper Mowen, the hero
of the day."
"But, Val, the feeling was mutual."
"Do you really mean that, Skipper?"
"I do, Val."
"And suppose that while you neg
-ected me, I forgot all about you, and
when the season was over you found
that I wasn't waiting. How would you
have felt then?"
"Val, I'd have felt that there wasn't
any glory in victory, and that all my
work had brought me nothing. Suppose
that that long pass I called for had
grounded and then I'd failed to con
vert, or what if I'd missed that place
kick? Would you still have been wait
ing for me, Val? I wouldn't have been
a hero, then."
The girl looked down as if afraid to
speak. Finally, she lifted her eyes and
murmured softly, "I would, Skipper."
"W r hy?"
"Because , because . Oh, Skip
per, you never would understand."
"I think I can, Val."
"I'm so glad. I knew you'd realize it
some day."
"Realize it some day! What do "

Skipper threw a quarter on the
counter and walked in the general di
rection of Val's exit. "Hope I didn't
keep you waiting long," she said as she
came toward him.
"Each minute seemed like an hour,"
he replied automatically.
"Skipper, you must learn something
new to say when I make my grand
entrance. It's the same thing every
time." •
"What's the use?"
"You can be so sarcastic when you
want to be. Now cease! Come and play
with me. I want to enjoy this party."
"Skipper! You've driven by the
place. It's back a block."
"Why didn't you tell me?"
"Why didn't you watch?"
"Well, here we are now. Let's not
worry about such dumb things."
Skipper found parking space near
the entrance of the Granada. A tall
footman opened the door for Val, and
escorted them to the entrance. Here
he directed Skipper to the right and
Val to the left. As soon as Skipper
had disposed of his hat and coat, he
sought the cigar counter.
"Strikes," he mumbled. The package
slid across the polished surface, and
Skipper inserted it in his pocket and
turned away.
"Fifteen cents, please?" said the girl
behind the stand.
"Pardon me," drawled Skipper as he
turned to face the keeper. "Didn't I
pay you?"
"No you didn't, and don't pull that
old stuff. You're the third guy to try
it in the last half hour."
Skipper complied with her request
and they entered the Granada ballroom
which had been transferred into a
dazzling bit of the South Sea Islands.
"Leaping linotypes!" exclaimed the
man, "the land of love, liquor, and
laughter. Fix up the court, too?"
"You bet!"
"Your idea?"
"Foolish question!"
"Well, you did a good job. Anyhow,
it doesn't suggest tragedy."
"Why should it?"
"Well, you see "
"There isn't going to be any tragedy
tonight," she inserted.
"I wish I could be as certain about
that as you are."
"Well, why should there be?"
"Because Damn it! The first
dance hasn't even started and here
we are acting like a flock of Greek
philosophers. Let's have action and
forget this stuff."
" 'To have twa minds is as confusing
as twins'," she quoted, and then added,
"Music wasn't made to listen to."
"Right," he voiced, and they began
to dance.
"Weird music, isn't it, Skipper?"
"Nasty flock of saxes," he replied
with a nod. "Recalls sweet memories."
"Sure does!"
"You remember then ?"
Val nodded this time. "It was two
years ago, in this same place, the night
after the game with Baker."
"How did you remember that?"
"How could I forget it. Isn't that the
time you earned the name of Skipper
for the way you ran the team in the
last three minutes? Those last three
minutes." •
"And then," said Skipper, "I found
a girl waiting for me after the game,
and I took her to a dance that night.
I hadn't seen her for several months,
but she was still faithfully waiting."

"Your idea?"
"Foolish question!"
"Well, you did a good job. Anyhow,
it doesn't suggest tragedy."
"Why should it?"
"Well, you see "
"There isn't going to be any tragedy
tonight," she inserted.
"I wish I could be as certain about
that as you are."
"Well, why should there be?"
"Because Damn it! The first
dance hasn't even started and here
we are acting like a flock of Greek
philosophers. Let's have action and
forget this stuff."
" 'To have twa minds is as confusing
as twins'," she quoted, and then added,
"Music wasn't made to listen to."
"Right," he voiced, and they began
to dance.
"Weird music, isn't it, Skipper?"
"Nasty flock of saxes," he replied
with a nod. "Recalls sweet memories."
"Sure does!"
"You remember then ?"
Val nodded this time. "It was two
years ago, in this same place, the night
after the game with Baker."
"How did you remember that?"
"How could I forget it. Isn't that the
time you earned the name of Skipper
for the way you ran the team in the
last three minutes? Those last three
minutes." •
"And then," said Skipper, "I found
a girl waiting for me after the game,
and I took her to a dance that night.
I hadn't seen her for several months,
but she was still faithfully waiting."
"Skipper, that was my pleasure. I
remember how proud I felt that night.
I, escorted by Skipper Mowen, the hero
of the day."
"But, Val, the feeling was mutual."
"Do you really mean that, Skipper?"
"I do, Val."
"And suppose that while you neg
-ected me, I forgot all about you, and
when the season was over you found
that I wasn't waiting. How would you
have felt then?"
"Val, I'd have felt that there wasn't
any glory in victory, and that all my
work had brought me nothing. Suppose
that that long pass I called for had
grounded and then I'd failed to con
vert, or what if I'd missed that place
kick? Would you still have been wait
ing for me, Val? I wouldn't have been
a hero, then."
The girl looked down as if afraid to
speak. Finally, she lifted her eyes and
murmured softly, "I would, Skipper."
"W r hy?"
"Because , because . Oh, Skip
per, you never would understand."
"I think I can, Val."
"I'm so glad. I knew you'd realize it
some day."
"Realize it some day! What do "

Skipper threw a quarter on the
counter and walked in the general di
rection of Val's exit. "Hope I didn't
keep you waiting long," she said as she
came toward him.
"Each minute seemed like an hour,"
he replied automatically.
"Skipper, you must learn something
new to say when I make my grand
entrance. It's the same thing every
time." •
"What's the use?"
"You can be so sarcastic when you
want to be. Now cease! Come and play
with me. I want to enjoy this party."
"Skipper! You've driven by the
place. It's back a block."
"Why didn't you tell me?"
"Why didn't you watch?"
"Well, here we are now. Let's not
worry about such dumb things."
Skipper found parking space near
the entrance of the Granada. A tall
footman opened the door for Val, and
escorted them to the entrance. Here
he directed Skipper to the right and
Val to the left. As soon as Skipper
had disposed of his hat and coat, he
sought the cigar counter.
"Strikes," he mumbled. The package
slid across the polished surface, and
Skipper inserted it in his pocket and
turned away.
"Fifteen cents, please?" said the girl
behind the stand.
"Pardon me," drawled Skipper as he
turned to face the keeper. "Didn't I
pay you?"
"No you didn't, and don't pull that
old stuff. You're the third guy to try
it in the last half hour."
Skipper complied with her request
and they entered the Granada ballroom
which had been transferred into a
dazzling bit of the South Sea Islands.
"Leaping linotypes!" exclaimed the
man, "the land of love, liquor, and
laughter. Fix up the court, too?"
"You bet!"
"Your idea?"
"Foolish question!"
"Well, you did a good job. Anyhow,
it doesn't suggest tragedy."
"Why should it?"
"Well, you see "
"There isn't going to be any tragedy
