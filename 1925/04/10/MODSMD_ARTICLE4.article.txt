# Stanford Men Re-Fish Lake Searsville to Thrive Again Felt Lake Furnishes Supply
## 
### 
If the efforts of Ernst Brandsten and
Professor J. O. Snyder prove success
ful, the waters of Searsville may soon
bo expected to overflow their banks.
Thursday morning these two adopt
ed the role of fishermen, and, with the
aid of a seine net and some large cans,
transplanted about one hundred bass
from Felt lake to Searsville. The fish
ranged in size from six inches to one
foot.
Since the complete evaporation of
the lake last summer there have been
no efforts made to secure aquatic spe
cies with which the lake could be re
stocked. Now, however, we have fair
promise of the normal population be
ing restored.
Brandsten is going to try to get the
Fish and Game Commission to co
operate with him in restocking the
waters with a variety of fishes.
