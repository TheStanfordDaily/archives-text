# DR. JORDAN SPEAKS ON EXCLUSION BILL
## 
### 
"The great menace to California is
not the Japanese, but the Mexicans,"
said Dr. Jordan in liis regular Thurs
day night lecture at his home. "All of
these are eligible to admittance and
half of them come in without paying
the head tax. They constitute a real
problem to the officers because they
are frequently in jails and in hospitals.
The Japanese, on the other hand, are
not expensive to the state; few of
them get into trouble with the law, and
they are healthy for the most part."
"Of the approximately 100,000 Japa
nese in California 65 per cent are en
gaged in farming and one-half of that
number aje day laborers. Most of the
day-laboring Japanese came here from
Hawaii when that country was an
nexed and the Japanese there were
released from virtual slavery. It is
not right to judge the Japanese as a
whole by these uneducated and back
ward members of the race from
Hawaii. This immigration was only
temporary and the Japanese coming
into the country at the time of the
exclusion bill were of a very different
type.
"Japan has never violated the Gen
tleman's Agreement. There has been
no immigration of day laborers since j
the agreement made with Roosevelt!
in 1908. The immigrants since that
time have belonged to the student,
tourist, and professional classes. It
would have been unnecessary to have
passed an exclusion bill; it would have
been just as sure a way to stop immi
gration by telling the foreign office in
Japan that we wanted all immigration
to this country to be discontinued.
"Japan is dependent upon the United :
States for her very existance; so she ;
is bound to accept anything that this <
country may do as nearly all of her
trade is to America.
