## California Yearlings Lose Contest 10-4 by Poor Fielding, Pitching 
### Cliff McDowell 
Coach "Husky" Hunt's freshman ball
! team decisively defeated the Univer
sity of California yearlings yesterday
in the California stadium by a score of
10-4.
Starting their run-collecting in the
i lirst inning, the Cardinal babes took
| the lead and were never in danger of
! losing it throughout the game. Poor
i fielding on the part of California al
[ lowed the score to become one-sided.
In the first inning the Stanford year
lings touched Newell, the California
hurler, for five hits and an equal num
ber of runs. From then on the game
; was all Stanford's, as the Bruin cubs
lost their spirit and played listlessly.
A total of eleven errors was charged
to "Duffy" Gerlach's players before the
i game ended.
California Gets Homers
Three of California's tallies were the
I results of home runs. In the first in
ning Douthit placed a hit in the right
field bleachers, scoring Thornton
ahead of him. Maurice scored another
run in the third canto when he knocked
the ball into the left field stands. Both
the right and left fields in the Cali
fornia stadium are exceedingly short,
and these home runs would have been
fly balls on a regulation field. Douthit
was actually tagged out at third base,
but as the ball had touched ihe stands
he was given a home run.
Phillippi, who did the mound work
for the Cards, pitched an excellent
game. He allowed the Blue and Gold
babes but nine hits, sent nine men to
the bench on strikes, and did not give
any walks. Phillippi was given splen
did support by his teammates, but two
errors being made by Stanford, and
neither of these accounted for runs.
Busch Takes Honors
Busch took the honors of the day for
hitting. In five times at bat he col
lected four hits, one of which was a
I
two-bagger. Maguire also starred with i
the stick, getting three hits out of five j
trips to the plate.
Sypher, the captain of the Stanford
babes, played his usually brilliant i
game behind the plate. But one stolen '
base was made against him.
Maguire's work on first was worthy
of note. He accounted for six put-outs
without a slip, and several of the
throws were hard to reach. Nissen, on
third base, accepted five chances and
finished the game with a clean record.

Coach "Husky" Hunt's freshman ball
! team decisively defeated the Univer
sity of California yearlings yesterday
in the California stadium by a score of
10-4.
Starting their run-collecting in the
i lirst inning, the Cardinal babes took
| the lead and were never in danger of
! losing it throughout the game. Poor
i fielding on the part of California al
[ lowed the score to become one-sided.
In the first inning the Stanford year
lings touched Newell, the California
hurler, for five hits and an equal num
ber of runs. From then on the game
; was all Stanford's, as the Bruin cubs
lost their spirit and played listlessly.
A total of eleven errors was charged
to "Duffy" Gerlach's players before the
i game ended.
California Gets Homers
Three of California's tallies were the
I results of home runs. In the first in
ning Douthit placed a hit in the right
field bleachers, scoring Thornton
ahead of him. Maurice scored another
run in the third canto when he knocked
the ball into the left field stands. Both
the right and left fields in the Cali
fornia stadium are exceedingly short,
and these home runs would have been
fly balls on a regulation field. Douthit
was actually tagged out at third base,
but as the ball had touched ihe stands
he was given a home run.
Phillippi, who did the mound work
for the Cards, pitched an excellent
game. He allowed the Blue and Gold
babes but nine hits, sent nine men to
the bench on strikes, and did not give
any walks. Phillippi was given splen
did support by his teammates, but two
errors being made by Stanford, and
neither of these accounted for runs.
Busch Takes Honors
Busch took the honors of the day for
hitting. In five times at bat he col
lected four hits, one of which was a
I
two-bagger. Maguire also starred with i
the stick, getting three hits out of five j
trips to the plate.
Sypher, the captain of the Stanford
babes, played his usually brilliant i
game behind the plate. But one stolen '
base was made against him.
Maguire's work on first was worthy
of note. He accounted for six put-outs
without a slip, and several of the
throws were hard to reach. Nissen, on
third base, accepted five chances and
finished the game with a clean record.
