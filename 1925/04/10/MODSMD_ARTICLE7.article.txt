## Cardinals Will Meet Bruin Nine On Memorial Stadium Diamond Tomorrow In Opening Game 
### 
By Harry Bennett
IJIHE Stanford nine will meet the Bruin varsity in the California Memorial
Stadium tomorrow afternoon for the opening game of the annual series.
The week's delay caused by the postponement of last SaUmlay's game has
given Harry Wolter and Carl Zamloch extra time in which to groom their
charges.
Both teams spent the week in light workouts, perfecting their playing form
and rounding into final shape. The pitching staif, consisting of Oviatt, Nevers,
and Collins, is in excellent condition, and with Lawson and Solomon as!
catchers, the battery for tomorrow should be at at its best.
Nevers and Lawson will probably start tomorrow's contest and will form
excellent opposition for Nounan and Lloynd. Nounan, pitching for California

ยง>this season, has built up a reputation
for being probably the best college
hurler on the Coast. Berkeley reports
that his arm is at its best.
Both batteries are now receiving
good, consistent support from the in
field, and very few errors have been
chalked up against either team out in
the outfield.
The two teams playing tomorrow
can hardly be accurately judged by
their performances of early season. It
is the first of another series of Big
Games, and the Cardinals believe that
they are in condition to spring a few
dope upsets.
One factor to the disadvantage of
the Stanford team will he the condi
tion of the Berkeley' field. The teams,
playing in the stadium, will be forced
to face the white background formed
by the concrete and seats. The Bruins,
practicing there constantly, have be
come used to this disadvantage.
