## 
### 
"One of the duties of a good man or
I a good citizen is to take a contributing
; part in some good enterprise," stated
! President Wilbur at a meeting of the
workers for the spring quarter Charity
j Drive last evening in the Women's
Clubhouse. Dr. Wilbur, in speaking to
the participants in the drive to be held
the first three days of next week, went
on to show that the drive for the Con
valescent Home and for the Students'
Friendship Fund was an enterprise
worthy of s/liport.
Tracing the history of drives at Stan
ford, Dr. Wilbur told of the innova
tion of the Social Service Board which
limits the drives to one a quarter. In
this way only those causes are chosen
which are particularly worthy for sup
port by the students, faculty, and resi
dents of Stanford and the vicinity.
The Stanford Convalescent Home is
to be the first part of the two-fold
cause for the drive. Dr. Wilbur in his
talk spoke briefly of the development
of the Home and its origination. He |
emphasized that the Convalescent
Home, which provides for. the care of
children who are in need of the health
essentials of sunshine, fresh air, and
good food, is an interest of the stu- j
dents themselves.
The Students' Friendship Fund is
to aid students in European countries !
to help themselves.
Paul Seivers, chairman of the drive !
committee, presided over the meeting. ■■
