# FRESHMEN EASILY DEFEAT CALIFORNIA BASEBALL MEN 12-5
## Cardinal Babes Take Annual Series by Second Win; Cypher Is Star 
### A. Espinosa 
The Stanford freshmen took their
ninth sport victory of the year from
the California Babes, when Coach
"Husky" Hunt's freshman baseball
nine defeated the California yearlings
by the decisive score of 12 to 5, last
Saturday, in the second game of the
annual series. This victory cinched the
series for the Cardinal babes, since
they won the first contest Thursday
by a score of 10 to 4.
In defeating the California freshmen,
the Cards chalked up a high run rec
ord for the Stanford-California fresh
men ball games. The previous record
was made in 1922, when under the
leadership of "Shorty" Roberts the
babes made 11 runs.
Hunt's team took an early lead when
Maguire, first baseman, clouted a
home run over the left field wall in
the opening frame, bringing in Weaver
and Garibaldi who had previously
singled. The Cards scored three more
runs in the second, when Newell, the
E3lue and Gold liurler, was jerked in
favor of Abercrombie, and three more
in the third and sixth innings, thus
piling up a lead which was never
threatened throughdut the game. The
fielding of the Bruins in the first six
frames was extremely ragged.
Newell, for California, had little on
the ball, and Abercrombie was not J
much better, though he tightened up !
the game considerably during five in- j
nings. Together the California mounds- j
men were toucher for fourteen hits.
The California yearlings could do j
little with Pliillippi's offerings until he j
weakened In the seventh, allowing :
three runs. Sobieski finished on the
mound for the Cards and in the last j
two innings was hit for one run.
Maguire Hits Homer
Maguire took thd- hitting honors of :
the day, collecting three hits, includ- -
ing one homer, out of five trips to the
plate. He is incidentally the leading!
slugger of the series, having smashed I
out six safe blows out of ten times at >
bat in the two games. Weaver, Gari- \
baldi, and Nissen also starred with j
the willow.
Every man on the Stanford nine 1
made at least one hit and one run in
the game. The Cards' fielding was i
practically perfect, one error having
been chalked up against them. Cap-!
tain Sypher played his usually bril
liant game behind the bat.
Oliver and Bree starred in the field
for the losers, and Maurice was the
heavy hitter, with three hits out of
five.

Newell, for California, had little on
the ball, and Abercrombie was not J
much better, though he tightened up !
the game considerably during five in- j
nings. Together the California mounds- j
men were toucher for fourteen hits.
The California yearlings could do j
little with Pliillippi's offerings until he j
weakened In the seventh, allowing :
three runs. Sobieski finished on the
mound for the Cards and in the last j
two innings was hit for one run.
Maguire Hits Homer
Maguire took thd- hitting honors of :
the day, collecting three hits, includ- -
ing one homer, out of five trips to the
plate. He is incidentally the leading!
slugger of the series, having smashed I
out six safe blows out of ten times at >
bat in the two games. Weaver, Gari- \
baldi, and Nissen also starred with j
the willow.
Every man on the Stanford nine 1
made at least one hit and one run in
the game. The Cards' fielding was i
practically perfect, one error having
been chalked up against them. Cap-!
tain Sypher played his usually bril
liant game behind the bat.
Oliver and Bree starred in the field
for the losers, and Maurice was the
heavy hitter, with three hits out of
five.

The Stanford freshmen took their
ninth sport victory of the year from
the California Babes, when Coach
"Husky" Hunt's freshman baseball
nine defeated the California yearlings
by the decisive score of 12 to 5, last
Saturday, in the second game of the
annual series. This victory cinched the
series for the Cardinal babes, since
they won the first contest Thursday
by a score of 10 to 4.
In defeating the California freshmen,
the Cards chalked up a high run rec
ord for the Stanford-California fresh
men ball games. The previous record
was made in 1922, when under the
leadership of "Shorty" Roberts the
babes made 11 runs.
Hunt's team took an early lead when
Maguire, first baseman, clouted a
home run over the left field wall in
the opening frame, bringing in Weaver
and Garibaldi who had previously
singled. The Cards scored three more
runs in the second, when Newell, the
E3lue and Gold liurler, was jerked in
favor of Abercrombie, and three more
in the third and sixth innings, thus
piling up a lead which was never
threatened throughdut the game. The
fielding of the Bruins in the first six
frames was extremely ragged.
Newell, for California, had little on
