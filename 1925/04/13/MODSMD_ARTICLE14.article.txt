# CALIFORNIA WINS FRESHMAN TENNIS BY SMALL MARGIN
## 
### 
Largely through the splendid tennis
displayed by Bradshaw Harrison, com
bined with unexpected strength in
doubles, the California freshman ten
nis team defeated the Stanford fresh
men three matches to two in their
annual match held Saturday morning
on the varsity courts.
Featuring for Stanford was the
stellar work of Gomar Thomas and
■Ralph M'cElVenny. Thomas defeated
Heilbron, bolder of naany junior titles,
in! the • sedond singles match, 9-7, 6-2,
r*v 1
and it was his consistent work that
nearly put over a win for Stanford in
the first doubles.
McElvenny played a brand of tennis
that is seldom seen fn^'freshman
matches, in 'third siqngleaj when he
! defeated Rhoades, holding the former
! Berkeley high i school star down to
j three games. Herrington, Stanford
! captain, was decidedly off form and
j at no time during either of his matches
[did he exhibit the brand of tennis that
has made him a nationally known
junior player.
Doubles Are Close
The closest and perhaps the best
match of the day came in first dou
bles. With the championship depend
ing on the match Herrington and
| Thomas ran up five games on the
Bear Cubs, but by registering their
points in the critical places Harrison

The Stanford team pulled out the sec
ond set 6-4 but were unable to come
through in the third set and dropped
the match at 6-2.

j son showed superior team play and
