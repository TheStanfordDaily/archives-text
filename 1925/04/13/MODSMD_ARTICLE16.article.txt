# CARDINALS OUTCLASS OREGON CINDER SQUAD By SCORE OF 92-38
## Hartranft Threatens World Discus Record With 155-Foot Heave 
### 
With the near record-breaking heave
of 155 feet in the discus throw, Cap
tain Glenn Hartranft added the crown
ing touch to the 92y> to victory
scored by Stanford's track varsity
against the University of Oregon in
the stadium Saturday.
The Redshirts took ten first places
to Oregon's four, tied their opponents
for initial honors in the high hurdles,
and made clean sweeps in
events, the shot, the discus, and the
880. They amassed 52 points on the
track and in the field.
Hartranft was agaiu high man with
eleven points with first in the shot
and discus and third in the century.
IJis mark in the discus came within
1 foot 1 3-8 inches of the world's rec
ord, and was his best achievement
since the Olympic tryouts last year.
When he tossed the shot out 49 feet
8 inches he practically assured himself
of a first in the Big Meet. Even more
gratifying than the work of the Card
captain was the showing made by
Hoffman and Evans, who placed sec
ond and third in both weight events.
The former put the iron pellet 44 feet
1 inch, which is better than any of
the Bears have doing consis
tently.
The third noteworthy achievement
of the day was A1 Smith's 4:25 race in
the mile, the best time that has been
made on the coast this year. Cu,m
mings set a fast pace for two laps
and then dropped out to let Kerr take
the lead, which he held until the last
half of th« fourth lap. Then Smith
uncorked a sprint and passed' both
Kerr and Holder of Oregon, who had
been running second, to win by a good
iriargin.
"Louis Gaspar gtit off to a flying start
in' both sprints and turned in J a pair
;of victories, winning second scoring
honors of the meet. His times of
:10 2-5 in the century and 23 flat in
| the 220 are not very promising in
view of the fact that Barber is in the
l habit of tearing off 10 flat and 22 flat
at Berkeley, but the wet track slowed
up the diminutive Card to some extent.
Hartranft was not in his usual form
and could do no better than third in
the 100.
Campbell was still bothered with
i his arches, finishing second to Caspar
in a slow furlong. Unless he improves
materially this week he will be lucky
to place next Saturday.

880. They amassed 52 points on the
track and in the field.
Hartranft was agaiu high man with
eleven points with first in the shot
and discus and third in the century.
IJis mark in the discus came within
1 foot 1 3-8 inches of the world's rec
ord, and was his best achievement
since the Olympic tryouts last year.
When he tossed the shot out 49 feet
8 inches he practically assured himself
of a first in the Big Meet. Even more
gratifying than the work of the Card
captain was the showing made by
Hoffman and Evans, who placed sec
ond and third in both weight events.
The former put the iron pellet 44 feet
1 inch, which is better than any of
the Bears have doing consis
tently.
The third noteworthy achievement
of the day was A1 Smith's 4:25 race in
the mile, the best time that has been
made on the coast this year. Cu,m
mings set a fast pace for two laps
and then dropped out to let Kerr take
the lead, which he held until the last
half of th« fourth lap. Then Smith
uncorked a sprint and passed' both
Kerr and Holder of Oregon, who had
been running second, to win by a good
iriargin.
"Louis Gaspar gtit off to a flying start
in' both sprints and turned in J a pair
;of victories, winning second scoring
honors of the meet. His times of
:10 2-5 in the century and 23 flat in
| the 220 are not very promising in
view of the fact that Barber is in the
l habit of tearing off 10 flat and 22 flat
at Berkeley, but the wet track slowed
up the diminutive Card to some extent.
Hartranft was not in his usual form
and could do no better than third in
the 100.
Campbell was still bothered with
i his arches, finishing second to Caspar
in a slow furlong. Unless he improves
materially this week he will be lucky
to place next Saturday.

Hoffman and Evans, who placed sec
ond and third in both weight events.
The former put the iron pellet 44 feet
1 inch, which is better than any of
the Bears have doing consis
tently.
The third noteworthy achievement
of the day was A1 Smith's 4:25 race in
the mile, the best time that has been
made on the coast this year. Cu,m
mings set a fast pace for two laps
and then dropped out to let Kerr take
the lead, which he held until the last
half of th« fourth lap. Then Smith
uncorked a sprint and passed' both
Kerr and Holder of Oregon, who had
been running second, to win by a good
iriargin.
"Louis Gaspar gtit off to a flying start
in' both sprints and turned in J a pair
;of victories, winning second scoring
honors of the meet. His times of
:10 2-5 in the century and 23 flat in
| the 220 are not very promising in
view of the fact that Barber is in the
l habit of tearing off 10 flat and 22 flat
at Berkeley, but the wet track slowed
up the diminutive Card to some extent.
Hartranft was not in his usual form
and could do no better than third in
the 100.
Campbell was still bothered with
i his arches, finishing second to Caspar
in a slow furlong. Unless he improves
materially this week he will be lucky
to place next Saturday.

Western and Middle Western col
lege men form better material for
business executives' positions than
their Eastern brothers, according to a
j recent statement by H. L. Doherty,
! president of the Cities Service Cor
poration of New York.
With the near record-breaking heave
of 155 feet in the discus throw, Cap
tain Glenn Hartranft added the crown
ing touch to the 92y> to victory
scored by Stanford's track varsity
against the University of Oregon in
the stadium Saturday.
The Redshirts took ten first places
to Oregon's four, tied their opponents
for initial honors in the high hurdles,
and made clean sweeps in
events, the shot, the discus, and the
880. They amassed 52 points on the
track and in the field.
Hartranft was agaiu high man with
eleven points with first in the shot
and discus and third in the century.
IJis mark in the discus came within
1 foot 1 3-8 inches of the world's rec
ord, and was his best achievement
since the Olympic tryouts last year.
When he tossed the shot out 49 feet
8 inches he practically assured himself
of a first in the Big Meet. Even more
gratifying than the work of the Card
captain was the showing made by
Hoffman and Evans, who placed sec
ond and third in both weight events.
