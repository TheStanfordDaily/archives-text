# Two Worthy Causes
## 
### 
Those who can remember back several years recall the time when the
quality of mercy was not altogether unstrained and the charity drives
dropped as the gentle dews from heaven. There was a time when students
rising for an 8 o'clock class were almost as certain of getting soaked in a
campaign for relief as they were of getting soaked by the morning damp.
So the under-graduates protected themselves against both.
With the establishment of the Social Service Board, however, the ex
pression of the urge to do good returned to the position of an emotion.
With one drive a quarter engaging the attention, charity has undergone a
deserved rejuvenation.
All appeals must be submitted to the board. Students may be sure
that only the most deserving causes have the approval of this investigating
body. This quarter the Stanford Convalescent Home and the Student's
Friendship Fund drives are combined.
Stanford's support of the home for convalescent children has won for
the University much commendation. The difference between life-long
ailing and robust health is made by the attention given the children here.
Each year the students have a Labor Day to clean-up about the grounds.
This year the renovation jubilee falls on the same day which will conclude
the drive for funds, Wednesday. If previous subscription records are not
passed before that time, contact with the hospital activities should lend
considerable impetus. Nobody should have to be solicited after a day
with the kids.
Although it is perhaps not so closely related to Stanford, the Student's
Friendship Fund is one which should have the sympathy of every college
student. For a great many of us the problem of going to a university is a
real one. To a great many more, the matter involves no hardships at all.
In other universities, particularly in Europe, students are uniformly
hard-up. The fund is for them.
Almost everybody has helped-out another college man at one time or
another. It isn't a matter of being too broke to buy a ticket from San
Francisco or of not having enough to pay a check. The European scholars
haven't enough to eat, in many cases. To anyone with the slightest imagi
nation, no further appeal is necessary.
Both of these funds will receive money equally unless it is otherwise
expressed on the subscription cards. If one can't decide on the better, he
might give twice as much.

FROM A LARGE GROUP of tryoutees for the business staff of the
Daily Palo Alto, two men and two women have been selected. Ihe new
members join the paper today Anne Russell, Anne Hartwell, C. C. Conn
or R. L. Harbison will be pleased to receive your congratulations and your

nation, no further appeal is necessary.
Both of these funds will receive money equally unless it is otherwise
expressed on the subscription cards. If one can't decide on the better, he
might give twice as much.

FROM A LARGE GROUP of tryoutees for the business staff of the
Daily Palo Alto, two men and two women have been selected. Ihe new
members join the paper today Anne Russell, Anne Hartwell, C. C. Conn
or R. L. Harbison will be pleased to receive your congratulations and your

WHO WON THE WAR? Well, the Glee Club is learning a funny
song now.
Those who can remember back several years recall the time when the
quality of mercy was not altogether unstrained and the charity drives
dropped as the gentle dews from heaven. There was a time when students
rising for an 8 o'clock class were almost as certain of getting soaked in a
campaign for relief as they were of getting soaked by the morning damp.
So the under-graduates protected themselves against both.
With the establishment of the Social Service Board, however, the ex
pression of the urge to do good returned to the position of an emotion.
With one drive a quarter engaging the attention, charity has undergone a
deserved rejuvenation.
All appeals must be submitted to the board. Students may be sure
that only the most deserving causes have the approval of this investigating
body. This quarter the Stanford Convalescent Home and the Student's
Friendship Fund drives are combined.
Stanford's support of the home for convalescent children has won for
the University much commendation. The difference between life-long
ailing and robust health is made by the attention given the children here.
Each year the students have a Labor Day to clean-up about the grounds.
This year the renovation jubilee falls on the same day which will conclude
the drive for funds, Wednesday. If previous subscription records are not
passed before that time, contact with the hospital activities should lend
considerable impetus. Nobody should have to be solicited after a day
with the kids.
Although it is perhaps not so closely related to Stanford, the Student's
Friendship Fund is one which should have the sympathy of every college
student. For a great many of us the problem of going to a university is a
real one. To a great many more, the matter involves no hardships at all.
In other universities, particularly in Europe, students are uniformly
hard-up. The fund is for them.
Almost everybody has helped-out another college man at one time or
another. It isn't a matter of being too broke to buy a ticket from San
Francisco or of not having enough to pay a check. The European scholars
haven't enough to eat, in many cases. To anyone with the slightest imagi
nation, no further appeal is necessary.
Both of these funds will receive money equally unless it is otherwise
expressed on the subscription cards. If one can't decide on the better, he
