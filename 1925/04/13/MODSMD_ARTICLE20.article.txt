# STANFORD POLOISTS OPPOSE ARMY TEAM
## 
### 
The Stanford polo team is scheduled
for a three-game series with the 30th
Infantry team of the Presidio of San
Francisco this week, on Tuesday and
Thursday afternoons at 2:30, and Sat
urday morning at 10:30. All games will
be played on the Highway field.
According to the averages so far,
Stanford should enter the series a favor
ite, holding two wins in the early season
games with the 30th. with only one de
feat. However, the Stanford line-up has
recently been changed, due to the loss
of Irwin at number two, and the In
fantrymen have had the benefit of al
most a month of practice with fast com
pany at Del Monte, which should make
the outcome practically an even break.
This is the first polo game to be
handled by the newly formed Stanford
Polo Association, and it is expected that
it will be a real social event. A polo tea
will be given by the association for the
officers of the 30th immediately after the
game.
The linc-up will be chosen from the
following men:
No. 1, Thomas, Krohn; No. 2 Dorcy.
â€¢Brown; No. 3, Laub; No. 4. Trotter.'
Admission to the games will he 50
cents per person. Members of the Stan
ford Polo Association are admitted free.
