# DIARY OF SAM PEPYS, JR.
## 
### 
March 30—Having but just come to
Stanford for the first time, I was
mightily terrified within, but held my
head high, and did not flinch even
once when I put on my dink, which I
dislike, it accentuating the size of my
ears and thinness of hair. Into a room
with two other persons at Encina, one
a chesty fellow from Los Angeles, and
the other a meek lad from Boston.
To the administration building where
I was, even against my will, registered
in all manner of idiotic lower division
subjects; I having outlined a splendid
course of pipes. Thence to the Encina
dining hall where we dined on a plate
of corn-beef pasty and kraut, I being
hit once in the left eye by a piece of
corn bread, tossed at the request of
one on my left. I was verily vext at
this, but the rogue having worked last
summer in the shipyards at San Pedro,
and rather hardy, I forebore any re
mark.
So to the jolly-up to which came
Infinity of Eds and but few of the
gentler sex, and where I did verily
feel out of place in my tuxedo, but had
a merry time withal. So to bed and had
a bad night of it.
March 31—This morning I lay abed,
thinking that I should have waked up
in time to make my eight o'clock. To
my saxaphone on which I worked up
an extraordinary harmony to "Moon
light and Roses." Going to class I
plucked a bouquet of poppies which
I delivered with as pretty a speech as
ever I did concoct. Verily I am become
a past master at apple polishing, only
two days at Stanford notwithstanding.
I did ditch my one o'clock to remain
in my room at the request of my room
mate who did teach me to play at
bridge. I by having but two dollars in
my pocket, and because that I did hold
the sack for two hours, and had not
one bidding hand, the game perforce
came to a close. To Encina haberdash
ery where I did buy me a new flannel
necktie with a college stripe. To din
ner at Sticky's with my roommate
from Boston had not dined no
more than myself, and who chid me
because that I had not gone swimming
with him and two blind dates from
Roble, I having unbeknown to him
seen my proferred date at the library
in the morning, and feared that should
she ever sink, I could not muster that
strength to raise her to the surface
again. To the picture show where I
did eat upon popcorn and peanuts, and
did laugh myself at the comedy until
that I feared I would blow out a tire.
To bed, reflecting on that I needs must
climb on the boat, and study on the
morrow, and the which produced un
pleasant dreams. —W. B.
