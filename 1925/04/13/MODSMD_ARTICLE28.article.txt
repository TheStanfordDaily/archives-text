"Skipper!" exclaimed Val in embar
rassment. "we've been dancing in this
same corner all the time. Everybody
is looking at us."
"I didn't realize it," he admitted, and
since the thoughts that were in their
minds were not for others they danced
to the finish in a deep silence.
The saxophones gave a painful moan,
the violin a dying screech, and the
drums added the final crash. Skipper
slowly released Val without looking
directly at her. "Whither?" he asked.
" 'The brave man chooses while the
coward stands aside'."
"Into the garden then."
"All right, old dear, but would you
mind waiting while I powder a little?"
"As the queen commands," he re
plied, and escorted her into the lobby.
"Can I depend on that?" she tossed
back over her shoulder.as she entered
the dressing room.
Skipper stood where she had left
him, and slowly and clumsily lighted
a cigarette. "Hold that for a minute?"
came a voice just back of him, as he
was about to flick out his match. Wally
Rand touched the flame to his own
cigarette. "Think you pulled through
exes all right?" asked the borrower.
"You're welcome," replied Skipper,
still looking in the direction of the
dressing room. •
"What!" exclaimed Wally. "Drink
ing?"
"No thanks. I never drink when I'm
out with Val."
"For God's sake!"
"What did you say?"
"What did I say?" demanded the
other. "First I asked you if I could
have a light, and then "
"Too much noise. I couldn't hear
you," iqrterrupted Skipper. "I'm
Excuse me. Here comes Val."
"Act one, scene two. Proceed," said
Val.
"The next scene will then be laid in
the garden of the king's palace," he
answered without smiling.
Val laughed. "'A little nonsense
now and then is !"
"This isn't nonsense."
"Oh Skipper! You really aren't get
ting serious?"
"It's time I did."
"But you never were before."
"Gotta do it tonight. It's the last
time, Val, and I'm afraid you don't
understand. I can't "
"I do understand. That's just the
trouble. If we go out into the court,
we'll "
"Don't you want to go, Val?"
Her graceful body quivered. "Y-e-s,
but not now', because the party's young
yet, and . Don't let sentimentality
get you down, Skipper."
"I wasn't being sentimental, but
there is . Oh, hell!" he exclaimed
under his breath, and the excited hum
of the stirring crowd rumbled above
the lull in their conversation.
Finally Val broke the silence. "Marie
Morton asked if she might have the
next dance with you."
"Well, what did you tell her?"
"I said it was all right with me."
"Fine! Marie is a cute little .
Who is she with?"
"Les Cramer."
"Is he that ham actor?"

we'll "
"Don't you want to go, Val?"
Her graceful body quivered. "Y-e-s,
but not now', because the party's young
yet, and . Don't let sentimentality
get you down, Skipper."
"I wasn't being sentimental, but
there is . Oh, hell!" he exclaimed
under his breath, and the excited hum
of the stirring crowd rumbled above
the lull in their conversation.
Finally Val broke the silence. "Marie
Morton asked if she might have the
next dance with you."
"Well, what did you tell her?"
"I said it was all right with me."
"Fine! Marie is a cute little .

"Skipper!" exclaimed Val in embar
rassment. "we've been dancing in this
same corner all the time. Everybody
is looking at us."
"I didn't realize it," he admitted, and
since the thoughts that were in their
minds were not for others they danced
to the finish in a deep silence.
The saxophones gave a painful moan,
the violin a dying screech, and the
drums added the final crash. Skipper
slowly released Val without looking
directly at her. "Whither?" he asked.
" 'The brave man chooses while the
coward stands aside'."
"Into the garden then."
"All right, old dear, but would you
mind waiting while I powder a little?"
"As the queen commands," he re
plied, and escorted her into the lobby.
"Can I depend on that?" she tossed
back over her shoulder.as she entered
the dressing room.
Skipper stood where she had left
him, and slowly and clumsily lighted
a cigarette. "Hold that for a minute?"
came a voice just back of him, as he
was about to flick out his match. Wally
Rand touched the flame to his own
cigarette. "Think you pulled through
exes all right?" asked the borrower.
"You're welcome," replied Skipper,
still looking in the direction of the
dressing room. •
"What!" exclaimed Wally. "Drink

"No thanks. I never drink when I'm
out with Val."
"For God's sake!"
"What did you say?"
"What did I say?" demanded the
other. "First I asked you if I could
have a light, and then "
"Too much noise. I couldn't hear
you," iqrterrupted Skipper. "I'm

"Act one, scene two. Proceed," said
Val.
"The next scene will then be laid in
the garden of the king's palace," he
answered without smiling.
Val laughed. "'A little nonsense
now and then is !"
"This isn't nonsense."
"Oh Skipper! You really aren't get
ting serious?"
"It's time I did."
"But you never were before."
"Gotta do it tonight. It's the last
time, Val, and I'm afraid you don't
understand. I can't "
