# MISS CORA REEVES SYSTEMATIZES DATA ON CHINA FISH LIFE
## 
### 
Misb Cora D. Reeves, who has spent
seven! years Instructing Col
lege, China, has been -ibe
guests of Dr. David Starr Jordan at
the University junoe last July, and is
systematizing all available infornja
tion on Chinese fish. Up to this time,
China, though possessing a r}ch abun
dance of fish, has lacked adequate
material for icthyological Study.
At Stanford Miss Reeves has access
to valuable data concerning Chinese
lihh and will use the information in
a manual of Chinese vertebrae. This
zoological work will be similar to Dr.
Jordan's "Manual of Vertebrae" and,
besides being printed in English, will
be published in Chinese in Nanking
for the use of university students.
This compilation will give the
Chinese an opportunity to develop
their own resources through a pre
sentation of a generalized background
of scientific facts that have been
worked out more completely in other
languages. Material gathered by hun
dreds of zoological systematists, and
especially that of Dr. Jordan, who is
considered the greatest living icthyolo
gist, will be used to enlighten Chinese
scientific study.
According to Miss Reeves, among
the great variety of fish that inhabit
oriental waters there are many that
have peculiarities. Fishing for min
nows with a bent pin in China would
be difficult as the minnows there grow
to the length of four feet. Another of
these interesting fish is the "climbing"
perch which can live out of water for
great lengths of time and is able to
propel itself on land by the use of its
powerful fins which it flaps rapidly on
the ground.
