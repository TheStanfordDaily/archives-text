# CHRISTIE PLEASED WITH SHOWING OF BEAR TRACKSTERS

California won its triangular meet
with Wisconsin and the All Stars of
the Southern Conference Saturday by
a score of 65. Wisconsin followed with
39V 3 and the All-Stars with 29^f.
Cpaeh Walter Christie, of the Bears
was visibly -pleased by the showing of
most of hia mefi and commented un
favorably on only the relay. It is on
that event also that the Big Meet this
Saturday may hinge and' Christie
realized it when he spoke after the
meet last Saturday/of working for im
pKoveipent the next few days.
It is clear that Johnson, the star
Bear quarter-miler, will have to im
prove his method of taking the baton,
but as this may happen in any meet
Christie should not be so greatly wor
ried. The California team's time for
the event was close to 3:29, better
than the Card relay men have done
M
this season. w
Coach R. L. Templeton has not run
his best 440 men together, however,
this year, and on a good track and
with Miller, Doerr, Babcock, and Rich
ardson running in the order named it
is entirely possible that they will
make 3:20.
Schwobeda was an enjoyable sur
prise to Christie by his time of 9:54
in the two-mile. Jensen did not run
because of work in San Francisco and
as he is capable of 9:54 himself the
Cardinal two-milers will have to step.
Charles' entry is a big IF—depending
on his physical condition. He was re
ported improved today but will not
be as strong as formerly on Saturday.
In gorfl condition he will easily win
over Schwobeda, however, as the lat-'
ter showed little strength in his finish.
Aldrette is a man whom Leistner
will have to watch in the low hurdles.
He has one of the strongest finishes
we have ever seen in a hurdler, com
ing up from a bad third for eight
hurdles to clear the tenth even with
Maxwell and Becker who were tied
and finish first. J He will probably not
enter the high hurdles.
Tliftre is no apparent explanation
for the poor showing of Garner, Hill,
and Graham in the pole vault since
weather conditions were excellent
across the bay. Garner has done 13
feet 1 inch, however, and with Hill will
give Scofield plenty of competition.
Barber's time's this year are evi
dently not the "flukes" they were last
year as evidenced by his close second
in a :9 9-10 hundred and 22 seconds in
the 220 —both on a poor track. Clymer,
Christie's other entrant, did not place
in either race, however, an d as Farns
worth and Schwalb have not shown
: anything this season, the Cardinal
sprinters have possibilities eight
i out of eighteen points.
