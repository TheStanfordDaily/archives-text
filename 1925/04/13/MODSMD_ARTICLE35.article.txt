# MEARS WILL SPEAK TUESDAY EVENING
## 
### 
Professor Eliqt Grinnell Mears of the
Economics department will speak at the
regular Tuesday evening lecture in the
Little Theater at 7:30 o'clock, instead of
Charles Caldwell Dobie, the short story
writer, as was first announced. Dobie is
sailing with the fleet today.
The lecture will be on Turkey, and
Mr. Mears is particularly well fitted' to
talk on this subject because he was for
merly an attache ia Turkey and has
lately published a book entitled "Mod
ern Turkey."
