# U. S. C. PLANS MOVE TO BURBANK TRACT
## 
### 
According to President Rufus B. Von
KleinSmid of the University of South
ern California, that institution is seri
ously considering moving from their
present location to a six-hundred acre
tract in Burbank. The proposition will
be heard at a meeting of the Board of
Trustees on April 21.
Owing to their cramped quarters and
the value of the property of the present
site, the university officials believe it ad
visable to move. The Burbank site
seems to offer the best location in the
vicinity.
This is the tract that was being con
sidered for the new home of the South
ern Branch which finally selected a 365-
acre tract in Westwood, a subdivision
within the city limits of Los Angeles.
