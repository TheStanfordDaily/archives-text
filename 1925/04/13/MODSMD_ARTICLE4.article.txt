# Rabbit Remembers Hungry Babes at Easter Breakfast
## 
### 
That the early bird gets the worm (if
nothing better) received confirmation at
Sunday breakfast at Encina dining hall.
A double surprise awaited the hungry
freshmen: firstly, the doughnuts were
actually hot, which was in itself a great
event; more surprising still was the ap
pearance on the table of a bowl of—no,
not the usual cereal, but—colored Easter
eggs
Purple, red, orange, and green hard
boiled hen fruit provided the frosh epi
cureans with a most ornamental, unusual,
and satisfying breakfast. All frosh will
agree that the chef suie knows his Easter
eggs.
