# CARD TRACK MEN WILL NOT TRAVEL TO DRAKE RELAYS
## 
### 
The Stanford track and field team will
not make a trip to the Drake relays at
Des Moines, lowa, it was decided Satur
day by the Board of Athletic Control.
The relays are to be held April 24 and 25.
The board agreed at the meeting to
put the final decision up to Coach R. L.
Templeton and the team itself, but the
matter was vetoed by both. Several
reasoos were given by Templeton as
spokesman for the team, the chief being
the relays' nearness to the California
meet, April 18.
As to a possibility of attending the
I. C. A. A. A. A., or Pacific Coast Con
ference meet, the board referred the
matter to the University Finance Com
mittee, whose decision will be final as
far as the board is concerned. If their
approval is then ratified by the Faculty
Athletic Committee and President Wil
bur, a trip to one of the two meets is
certain.
Which one of the two meets the
Finance Committee will, approve depends
a great deal upon the expenditures con
cerned, according to an announcement
by the Board of Athletic Control. Heavy
losses on .the Oregon and Nebraska
meets have made it inadvisable to ad
vance a large sum for trauÂ§poras:ion, as
wi\l be necessary if a inrge team attends
: 4he I. C. A. A. A. A. It is possible, how
ever, that seven men will be sent, in
cluding Templeton, at a cost of $280 per!
man, which may be considered favorable
by the committee.
On th eother hand, a team of four
teen men may possibly be sent to the
Conference meet at a less expense and
an amount that will not add so gratly
to the board's $640,000 indebtedness.
A decision on the matter will prob
ably be 'given by the Finance Committee
about April 28.
