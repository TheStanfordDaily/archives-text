# CALIFORNIA DEFEATS CARD NINE IN OPENER
## Bears Pound Four Cardinal Pitchers for 27 to 5 Victory Saturday 
### Harry Bennett 
The University uf California baseball
team will invade the campus Saturday
for the second game of the annual series.
The Bruins are great favorites to take
this game and the series after their 27
to 5 victory over the Cardinals in the
Memorial stadium last Saturday.
In the Berkeley game the entire pitch
ing staff was used to no avail in an at
tempt to stop the Bear rally. Nevers
started the game, but his usual speed and
control were lacking. After walking
three consecutive men, Tod Oviatt was
sent in to replace him. Later Collins and
Reese took a turn on the mound without
great success.
Nounan pitched his usual consistent
full game for the Bruins and split the
honors of the day with his teammate,
Dixon. Dixon's batting was spectacular
from his first trip to the platter in the
opening inning. With Sears and Tait
on base, he drove out a homer off Nev
ers. Later he smashed out another homer
and out of the five times at bat he tallied
four hits.
The Stanford batting was well up to
par, totaling ten hits and five runs, and
cannot be considered as poor. Lawson
and Johnston shared the honors with
two singles apiece.
The Cardinal:?' best inning was the
second. Both Brown and Draper sin
gled,-, and the bases were filled when
Lawson walked. Nevers singled, scor
ing Brown and Draper. After Mulchay
had walked, Johnston singled and
brought in Lawson.
During this.week, Wolter intends to
spend most of his time lining up his
hurlers for Saturday's contest. This be
ing the second of the series and on the
home diamond, should prove a help to
the Cards, but the terrible slaughter that
the pitching staff took means plenty of
wprk is necessary to strengthen that de
partment.
As a whole, the team in the field
worked well. Ftftlf errors were chalked
up: three in the infield and one in the
outfield.
