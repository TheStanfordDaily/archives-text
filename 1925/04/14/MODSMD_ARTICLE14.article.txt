## 
### 
A nine-hole golf course within a mile
of the campus, and offering full play
ing privileges to Stanford students will

cording to M. E. Miller, Palo Alto
business man, who is directing the
enterprise.

Middlefield. Construction work will
start this week, and it is hoped to
get the links in playing condition bv
the first in May, although the
official opening has been set for May

Abrego Is "Pro"
Autone "Al" Abrego is acting as
professional and architect for the
course. He has designed links in dif
ferent parts of the state and served
as "pro" at the San Jose Country Club
for two years. The Palo Alto course
will be 2G15 yards long, with a par of
33. Sand greens will be used at first,
and grass greens will be sown at once
and opened for play as soon as the
turf has become sufficiently firm. The
fairways will not be of turf, but will
be mowed regularly and kept in good
condition.
Although the site of the course is
level throughout, large trees scattered
over it at frequent intervals constitute
good natural hazards. All the greens!
will be well trapped and bunkers will
be constructed on the longer holes.
No clubhouse is included in the plans,
but a starting house will be erected
immediately where a full line of clubs
and balls will be on sale. Clubs will
also be available for rent by the day.
Abrego will give lessons at the rate
of two dollars an hour.
No Memberships Sold
No proprietary memberships are be
ing offered for sale, thus eliminating
any initiation charge. Green fees of
one dollar will be levied on weeks days
and $1.50 on Saturdays, Sundays, and
holidays. Cards similar to meal tickets
will be offered in $30 denominations.
They will be honored in payment of
green and caddy fees. Holders of cards
will be charged a flat rate of $1 every
day of the year. Cards may be pur
chased at the Palo Alto Chamber of
Commerce or at the Bank of Palo Alto.
Miller has made a special offer to
Stanford students who desire to avail
themselves of the privileges of the
new country club, the details of which
will be fully explained at a meeting of
the Stanford golf club Thursday night.

as "pro" at the San Jose Country Club
for two years. The Palo Alto course
will be 2G15 yards long, with a par of
33. Sand greens will be used at first,
and grass greens will be sown at once
and opened for play as soon as the
turf has become sufficiently firm. The
fairways will not be of turf, but will
be mowed regularly and kept in good
condition.
Although the site of the course is
level throughout, large trees scattered
over it at frequent intervals constitute
good natural hazards. All the greens!
will be well trapped and bunkers will
be constructed on the longer holes.
No clubhouse is included in the plans,
but a starting house will be erected
immediately where a full line of clubs
and balls will be on sale. Clubs will
also be available for rent by the day.
Abrego will give lessons at the rate
of two dollars an hour.

themselves of the privileges of the
new country club, the details of which
will be fully explained at a meeting of
the Stanford golf club Thursday night.
