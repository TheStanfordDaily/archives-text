# Local Golf Course To Be Constructed For Palo Alto Fans
## 
### 
A nine-hole golf course within a mile
of the campus, and offering full play
ing privileges to Stanford students will
become a reality within a month, ac
cording to M. E. Miller, Palo Alto
business man, who is directing the
enterprise.
The course will be semi-public in
character and will be located at the
intersection of the Embarcadero and
Middlefield. Construction work will
start this week, and it is hoped to
get the links in playing condition bv
the first in May, although the
official opening has been set for May
15.
Abrego Is "Pro"
Autone "Al" Abrego is acting as
professional and architect for the
course. He has designed links in dif
ferent parts of the state and served
as "pro" at the San Jose Country Club
for two years. The Palo Alto course
will be 2G15 yards long, with a par of
33. Sand greens will be used at first,
and grass greens will be sown at once
and opened for play as soon as the
turf has become sufficiently firm. The
fairways will not be of turf, but will
be mowed regularly and kept in good
condition.
Although the site of the course is
level throughout, large trees scattered
over it at frequent intervals constitute
good natural hazards. All the greens!
