# CONDITIONS IN MODERN TURKEY SUBJECT OF LECTURE
## 
### 
"Modern Turkey" will be the sub
ject of the lecture which is to be given
by Professor Eliot Grinnell Mears to
night at 7:30 in the Little Theatre.
In his lecture tonight Mears will
depict the social and economic condi
tions In Turkey since the overthrow
of Sultan Abdul Hamid in 1908. Spe
cial emphasis will be given to the
significance of the changes from an
autocracy to a Republic.
"The twentieth century has wit
nessed greater changes in Turkey
than in any other nation in the world,"
says Mears. "The new leaders of Tur
key are making a sincere effort to
reconstruct their country along pro
gressive lines. Their problems are dif
ficult, perhaps insurmountable. They
are building in a land where the re
forms may be premature, but at least
are real.
"Prior to 1908 there were no street
cars, telephones, or other public utili
ties in the Ottoman Empire. There
were over five thousand censors and
spies in the Imperial service. Secrecy,
extravagance, oppression, and graft
were the order of the day," he said.
Professor Mears was appointed in
1919 by President Wilson as economic
member of the American Mission to
Armenia and Transcaucasia to ascer
tain facts relative to a possible Ameri
can Mandate.
