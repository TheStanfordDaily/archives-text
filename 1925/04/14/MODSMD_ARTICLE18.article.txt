# CONVALESCENT HOME SCENE Of LABOR DAY PROGRAM TOMORROW
## R. P. Myers Completes Final Arrangements for Barbecue 
### 
Stanford's sixth annual Labor Day
will be observed tomorrow afternoon
at the Stanford Convalescent Home
when the student body reports there
for work, barbecue at 0 o'clock will
follow the day's labors of pulling
weeds, felling trees, and cleaning win
dows, according to R. P. Myers, head
of the committee in charge of arrange
ment's.
Fifteen barbecued sheep will form
the bulk of the menu for the feast, and
J. P. Prior, chairman of the barbecue
committee, and Sam Mac Donald prom
ise a real treat for the laborers. Two
hundred dozen sandwiches of all kinds,
hot coffee, hot beans, ice cream, ani
pickles complete the menu.
Work will begin at 1 o'clock tomor
row afternoon and all men are urged
to report at the Home at that time.
Trucks and automobiles will carry
women to the scene. Men with auto
mobiles who can assist in transporting
the women should report with their
cars to C. E. Collett at the Convale
scent Home tomorrow afternoon at 1
o'clock for instructions where to call.
Men will hike to the Home and are
urged to be there as early as possible.
No afternoon classes will be held to
morrow. The Convalescent Home is
the old Stanford residence and may be
reached by following the road through
the arboretum, past the cactus gar
dens, and then, after passing the red
Stanford Dairy building, turning to the
right on the second road. The Home is
about a mile from the Quad.
Though there will be no dancing this
year as there was last, D. Fassoth, in
charge of providing entertainment, has
arranged diversions for the workmen.
The Glee Club will sing several selec
tions and C. C. Stratton will give a
solo. T. A. Campbell, with several
girls, will put on a skit, and Whitmer's
orchestra will play during the barbe
cue.
Silver for the occasion is being sup
plied by the various fraternity houses
and the committee under T. F. Miller
collected it today. The work this
year will include the felling of only
three trees instead of the number han
dled last year. Clearing ground of
weeds, chopping wood and stacking
it, and cleaning windows will be the
tasks confronting the men.
The garden of the Home will be
cleaned up by girls working under
the direction of Velma Randall. Jean
Ward has charge of all work of the
women for the occasion.
Labor Day comes earlier this year
than It did last because of the number
of weeds which have sprung up. There
was thought to be no need of hiring
men to remove these when the stu
dents' Labor Day could be shoved
ahead on the calendar a month or so.
The Convalescent Home has at pres
ent about forty children, all of which
are cases from hospitals of San Fran
cisco. These have been recommended
by physicians for the fresh air treat
ment and wholesome food which serve
as the Home's only cures.

An assistant in the library at the
University of Oregon carried an an
cient pedometer for five hours on duty
and discovered that she had walked
six miles during the time.
