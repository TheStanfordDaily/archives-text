# A 						Pleasant Duty

Labor (la' ber) v. i.; to exert one's powers of body or mind; to exert
one's self; to work; toil. .
Tomorrow is Day. It is the day when all students ordinarily
hie themselves to the Stanford Home for Convalescent Children for the
purpose of eating. In order to save time, this opportunity to point out the
true meaning of the word "labor" is taken, because the cooks will be busy
and unable to stop every few seconds to explain that the laboring is to be
done with spades and rakes and not with knives and forks. One who has
attended any of Sam McDonald's previous barbacues will testify that it is
no effort at all to eat his meals. It is a pleasure.
Charity workers all over the campus started out yesterday to explain
exactly what the convalescent home is doing. Funds are being solicited to
continue the work of nursing children back to robust health after serious
illnesses. Each year Stanford residents respond financially to support the
home. And annually the student body helps the directors to save unneces
sary expense by turning out in force to clean-up around the grounds and
to tidy things generally.
Many hands make light work. In past years the undergraduate
laborers have accomplished considerable tasks at gardening, clearing and
other necessary chores. With everybody on the job at 1 o'clock, work is
finished shortly after 4 o'clock and the entertainment committee takes
charge. Afternoon classes are suspended. A festival spirit prevails, ever
and again infecting even parlor athletes to the point of actual labor.
There is just enough work to justify calling it Labor Day and every bit
as much pleasure as in anything else Stanford students do as a group.
It's a good idea all around. You must come over.
