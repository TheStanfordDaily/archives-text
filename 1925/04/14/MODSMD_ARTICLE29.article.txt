# THE 						LAW STEPS

V. G. D.

Some people are eternally "frank,"
and Oh! the joy they get from the
sacrosanctum feeling it gives them —
especially when they write on thought
in their secret diary, and it's contrary
to the world or its equivalent.
Suffering, after all, is proportional,
and it can't continue forever. And
frankness, or the lack of it, cannot
be cured by Triumvirates, any more
than can anything else.
He swam across Lagunita and back
again with a cigar, a smoking cigar,
in his mouth, and he wasn't long and
thin. And no polly-wogs were swal
lowed!

We live and learn —yes; but what
good does it do?
And then again
"If wit were always radiant,
If wine were always iced,
And bores were kicked out
straightway
Through a convenient gateway;
Then down the year's long gra
dient
'Twere sad to be enticed —
If wit were always radiant,
And wine were always iced."
N'est ce pas?
