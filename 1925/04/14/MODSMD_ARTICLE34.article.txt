# Organ Recitals to Be Resumed in May
## 
### 
Alterations on the organ of the Me
morial Church are in progress, which
will delay the resumption of organ re
citals given by Warren D. Allen until
some time in May. Extensive enlarge
ments and improvements are being made
which will put the instrument in good
mechanical order and provide space and
facilities for all future changes.
A new console is being supplied by the
Skinner Organ Company, very similar
to that installed by them in the Palace
of the Legion of Honor in San Fran
cisco. The console has four keyboard
manuals and a futt complement of stop
knobs, which while they will all not be
used at the present time, will take care
of any new sets 5f pipes to be added in
the future. The units which it is hoped
will be forthcoming later on include an
entirely new solo organ, two 32-foot
stops for the pedals, and an enlarge
ment of the echo organ to the propor
tions of a two manual division. When
this is done the old console, now being
replaced, may be used for an auxiliary
purpose in the chancel where it would
control the echo and antiphonal divisions
of the organ.

An investigation conducted on the
campus of Michigan Agricultural Col
lege showß that women take an aver
age of 4000 more steps a day than do
men.

By the will of the late Artemas
Ward, Harvard University receives a
fraction of every cent dropped in the
chewing-gum slot machines on the
elevated trains in New York City. The
sum derived from these machines
amounts to more than $2,000,000.
