Sixth Installment
"He's the man who played the part
of Harry in 'R. U. R.' and the best
leading man I ever had. Don't you like
him ?"
"Oh, I suppose he's all right, but just
the same ——"
"What do you mean, Skipper?"
"Val, I didn't like the way he looked
at you in that play."
"Skipper, don't be foolish. You don't
.mean that you thought that silly pro
posal was meant to be serious, even
on the s.tage?"
"I'm not as dumb as that, but remem
ber what the critics said?"
"What?"
"That your resistance was weak."
"Well, one can't always be perfect
in their acting. I'm not a professional,
you know."
"The critics say you could be."
"The critics are crazy."
"Just the same I don't like to
have "
Val's face was flushed. "Skipper, did
I ever forbid you dancing with ?
What right have you to talk this way?
I think you're rather inconsistent?"
"I-guess-I-am. They're coming now."

"You're a wonderful dancer, Skip
per," said Marie, at the end of the
first encore.
"I'm not dancing so well as usual
tonight," he replied, apologetically.
"What are you looking at so intent
ly?" and she tried to follow his gaze.
"Nothing." Skipper really cast his
eyes upon Marie for the first time.
"Then look at me a little bit. Don't
you know I had to fight with Lea to
get this dance?"
"Why?"
" i I don't know exactly, but Les is
so inconsistent. We're not engaged or
anything like that, and probably never
will be: still he gets mad every time
I . Men are so selfish."
"What makes you think so?"
"Take Les, for instance. He wants
all my time. I can't go out with any
body else. He treats the all right when
we're out, but he's not letting me have
what's part of college. I can't meet
and make other friends among the
boys "
"Then why do you go out with him?
You could get other dates."
"I know, but it's worth something
to have a man like Les Cramer taking
you around. He's somebody, you know,
and besides "
"Is he worth all you think you're
losing?"
"I don't think you understand."
"Perhaps I don't."
"Well, I don't exactly crave these
so-called petting parties. It's so foolish.
And Les never gets that way towards
me. He shows me all the respect that
a girl could ask for."
"And for that you are willing to "
"Absolutely!"
"Good! I admire you. Shall we dance
some more," he added, as the music
began again.
"I'd rather go out into the court, if
you don't mind?"
"Not at all, I assure you. I'm glad
for a chance to smoke."
They reached a more or less se
cluded bench. "How's this?" he asked.
"Quite intricate," she replied, and
complied with his suggestion.
Skipper lighted a cigarette before
he spoke. "Do you." he said slowly,
"think you really love Les?"
Marie took a seal ring from her
finger and then put it on again. She
repeated this action several times;
stopped for a brief instant, and then
continued as she spoke. "I don't know.
Sometimes I think I do and then
again . I have every reason in the
world to believe he loves me. I ex
pect him to propose sometime, and,
well , I think he should."
"I see," said Skipper, and these were
the last words for the next ten min
utes.
Marie was the first to break the
artificial silence. "You aren't angry
with me, are you?'
■ "No, Marie. Why should I be?"
"Then why don't you say some
thing?"
"I was just thinking. The music's
started. We'd better go," he answered.
Skipper exchanged Marie for Val
with all due and customary proceed
ings of courtesy. "Val," he asked, "will
•you come out into the court for a
moment?"
"Why do you want to go out. into the
court, Skipper? The music has just
started."
"Don't you trust me, Val?"
"Of course, Skipper. Did I ever do
anything that would make you think
I didn't?"
"Then, if you aren't afraid, why do
you keep objecting?"
"Skipper, going out into that court
seems like going out of all the fun
we've had. and . I'll go."
Another silent passage for Skipper
with an equally silent partner, as he
escorted her to the same bench. "Val,"
he said quietly, "I've something I must

tell you. I've put this off as long as
I could; perhaps longer than I should,
but now I've simply got to tell you.
Val, I "
Val rose resolutely to her feet. Skip
per did not, but he took hold of her
hand. "Sit lown," he said, in the same
quiet tones. "I'm sorry, Val, but it's no
use."
"Skipper, don't!"
"Val, please?"
"Then there is something I must
tell you first." She was now sitting
beside him, her hand in his.
"If it's anything about the past, and
all that bunk, it's better left unsaid.
It's better I didn't know, because noth
ing can change me now."
"Suppose you heard unfav ;
something that would make you hate
me?"
Seventh Installment
"I don't care anything about that.
It makes no difference. I feel that I've
been selfish, unkind, and mean to you.
I've even led you to believe certain
things that were not so. Val . Oh!
I'm a beast."
"Don't feel so bad about it, dear."
Val put her arm" around his neck.
"Don't, Skipper."
He looked into her eyes. "Val, you're
crying. Val, then you understand."
"Oh, Skipper. Stop! What are you
trying to do?"
"Forgive me, Val. I guess it was just
madness of "
"Skipper, before this thing goes any
further you must listen to what I have
to say. I can't marry you "
"What?"
"I am engaged to Donald Merrick."
"How long has this been going on?
I never heard of him. I thought you
were in "
"I didn't want to hurt you until I
had to, Skipper. I met him last sum
mer when I was in China with mother
and dad."
"In China!"
"Yes, he's Oh, something to do
with the ambassador."
"The hell you say!"
"His father and my father were old
friends, and, well I love him.
That's all there is to it."
"That's good," said Skipper, as he
sought to rescue a few of his scattered
thoughts.
"Good! What do you mean?"
"I was trying to tell you that I could
n't marry you."
For a jilted woman, Val's laugh was
very disappointing, as she replied, "Do
you expect me to believe that? That's
as funny as "
"There's nothing funny about it,
Valentine Nierle. Here I've been de
voting all my time to you. I've missed
the chance to meet lots of other girls
for your sake, and, now, now "
"You aren't mad, are you, Skipper?"
"Mad! Hell, no! I'm insulted."
"I didn't think you'd take it this
way."
"What else could you expect? You
lead me to "
"I didn't!"
"You did. I'm through with you, and
crying won't do any good."
"You were the best friend I ever
had," she sobbed.
" 'Were* is right."
"Skipper, won't you ever come to
see me again?"
"Yes, I'll run over to China every
morning before breakfast. I probably
won't speak to you again. Unless "
"Unless what?"
"Unless it.Hs to ask you to let go
of my coat."
'Tdon't believe you ever loved me,"
said the girl.
"Who in hell ever said I did?"
"Then what are you so mad about?"
"Dammit! Here you'fe been .
Get your hat and coat. We're going
home."

"But I can't go across the floor now.
I've been crying, and my face is all*
I've been crying, and —my —face —is all
wet."
"Tell 'em you fell in the fish pond.
Come on."

Skipper Mowen had been sitting at
his desk for an hour. His chair was
tilted far back and the heels of his
shoes were spoiling a new desk blotter.
He had not removed his hat nor coat
and his slouched position sent the stiff
front shirt well up in the direction of
his chin.
"She made a fool out of me," he said j
to himself. "Why, she didn't even be-!
lieve I didn't love her, and she wasn't I
sorry . That wasn't the way I in-!
tended it to be at all. Hell!"
The door flew open with a bang and
Buz burst into the room. "For crying
out loud," he exclaimed. "What the
devil are you doing home so early?
Who were you talking to?"
"I don't know. Do you see anybody?"
"What's the Idea?"
"Aw key down for "
"I'm so happy I can't be insulted,"
objected Buz. "Great news! Grace and
I are going to be married!"
"Go<#l God!" was the counter explo-!
slon. "How did you do it? What did
you say?" and Skipper's feet hit the
floor with a bump.
"I don't know what I said. I don't
care what I said. I Just did. Whoopee!*'
and he began a rather awkward inter
pretation of the spring dance.
"That's right It isn't what you say;
it's what you do. Last night out with
Val, though.
"Sure?" asked the jubilant Buz, pant
ing for breath.
"Absolutely," replied the other, and
began writing a letter.
