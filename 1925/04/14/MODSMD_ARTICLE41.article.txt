## 
### 
Over fifty Mechanical Engineering
students, with Professor E. P. Lesley,
made a trip to San Ftrancisco Satur
day for the purpose of looking over
the mechanical equipment ,of several
of the boats stationed there with the
fleet.
It had been planned to inspect the
battleship Colorado, the repair ship
Madusa, and the airplane carrier Lang
ley, but due to the fact that the
Madusa was ai Mare Island and the
Langley had just arrived, only the
battleship was inspected which is one
of the new electrically-driven type of
battleships and is propelled through
the use of four huge motors.
