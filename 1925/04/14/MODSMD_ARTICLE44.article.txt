# Western Colleges to Send Deans Here for Conference

### 
Twenty western universities will be
represented at the Deans of Men con
vention to be held on the campus
April 16 to 18. Problems dealing with
colleges will be discussed and ideas
interchanged. Papers will be read by
members of the convention touching

Dean Culver will speak on Stanford's
fraternity system, and talks will also
be given by President Wilbur and Pro

This is the second annual conven

for the visitors is a barbecue at Lake
Searsville, and an evening at the home
of Dean Culver.
