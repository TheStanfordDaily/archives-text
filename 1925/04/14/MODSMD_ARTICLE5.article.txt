# Masque Ball Date Changed; April 25 Final Selection
## 
### 
The date of the Masque Rail has
been changed from April 24 to April 25,
according to an announcement made
by the Rally committee. Since the
dance will take place on Saturday
night, by the new arrangement, it will
start at 8:30 and end at 12 o'clock.
A marble-shooting contest between
two campus notables will be held, says
E. L. Rarnett, chairman of the com
mittee on decorations. The committees
have been haunting children's play
grounds lately, and having found most
of.the apparatus anchored down, they
request that anyone having a spare
slide or see-saw, bring it along.
Costumes will go on sale next week
on the campus. The Coast Costume
Company, which is handling them, has
assured the committee that the dis
play will be the best possible.
Kate Clemens and Helen Stewart
will give an interpretive dance as a
part of the entertainment.
