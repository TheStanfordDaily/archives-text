# I. A. C. SQUAD ARRIVES TO PREPARE FOR A. A. U. RACES
## 
### 
Twelve Illinois Athletic Club swim
ming stars arrived on the campus yes
terday to finish their training for the
national A. A. U. events in San Fran
cisco the latter part of this month.
Heading them is Coach Bill Baclirach
with his world-famous proteg6, Johnny
Weissmuller.
The I. A. C. men headed for the
Encina pool which will be their train
ing headquarters until the champion
ship events commence. Yesterday aft
ernoon the water polo men worked
out with the Stanford varsity.
The swimmers who arrived are:
Ferd Lauer, Floyd Town, Sam Greller,
Conrad Mila, Ollie Horn, Johnny
Weissmuller, "Hooks" Miller. Dave
Barclay, "Jam" Handy, Bob Skelton.
Perry McGillvray, water polo player
and relay man, will join the team Fri
day.
The Illinois squad is rated as one
of the best in the country. It boasts
several record-holders in its lineup,
notably Weissmuller, who at the pres
ent time holds the 50-, 220-, and 500-
yard championships. Among the others
are Kruger, last year's A. A. U. cham
pion in the medley and pentathlon;
Horn, holder of backstroke record;
Skelton, winner of the world title of
breaststroke champion at Paris last
year at the Olympic games.
To this coterie of stars is added
Arne Borg, who arrived on the cam
pus last week. Borg will swim un
attached in the big meet and will not
compete in any water polo games on
the program.
In a practice game with the Stan
ford varsity Bill Bachrach's visitors
downed the Cardinals 6-0. Collett,
Brandsten's most dependable goal
guard, was absent from the Cardinal
lineup in this game. The Illinois men
showed speed but could not work well
on the defense and it was only the
poor shooting of the Stanford forwards
that kept the score from being closer.
During the past week Brandsten has
been using Borg with the Stanford
freshmen against the varsity. The com
! bination has worked well and given
| the varsity members some valuable
j practice.
