# CARD JOFFRE DEBATERS FACE STRONG OPPOSITION
## California Trio Reputed Among Cleverest Speakers in Forensic Contests 
### 
California will be represented in the
Joffre Medal debate tomorrow night
by three of the cleverest speakers that
have ever appeared for the Golden
Bear, according to word received from
the Berkeley campus.
Harold F. Cherniss, Raymond . Stan
bury, and Bernard E. Witkin, the

Berkeley trio, are all veteran debaters.
They appeared in the Joffre debate
last year, Witkin and Cherniss tying
for second place. The same trio formed
the combination which spoke in the
Oxford debate this winter before three
thousand people in Wheeler hall, one
thousand people in the first overflow
accommodation meeting, and five hun
dred in the second.
All three are seniors and will be
participating in their last intercolle
giate debate. Cherniss is a major in
Political Science and a member of Phi
Beta Kappa. His preparation at the
close of his rebuttal in the Joffre
debate last year was regarded by a
number of authorities who heard the
contest as the most effective speech
of the evening.
Raymond Stanbury was the Califor
nia member of the group which ap
peared with two Stanford men, Robert
C. Littler and Robert E. Lewis, in the
Prohibition debate against the Oxford
speakers in the Municipal Auditorium
in San Francisco. Last year Stanbury
spoke in the debate on the World
Court against the University of British
Columbia, and his speech was pub
lished in the 1924-1925 Debaters' An

j nual. This fall he headed the Demo
cratic Club on the Berkeley campus
I and spoke for Davis in the political
debate at the University of Southern
California.
Witkin, the third member, was the
first California student to lead a
I debating team during his sophomore
year. He was prominent in the La-

Follette campaign last fall, and de
fended LaFollette in the triangular
debate in San Francisco the night
before election. Witkin is regarded by
some critics as perhaps the cleverest
of the three.
The debate in the Assembly hall to
morrow night will mark the thirty
third such contest between two insti
tutions.
In 1893 Baron Pierre de Coubertin
offered a medal to the winner in a
forensic contest between Stanford and
California. At first the medal offered
was called the "Medaille Carnot" in
honor of the martyred president of
France.
In 1917 the name was changed
through action of M. de Coubertin to
the "Medaille Joffre." Rules of the
contest provide that three months be
fore the date set, a general question
shall be chosen from which a specific
topic is to be announced two hours
before the debate. The general ques
tion this year is "French Policy in
Asia and Africa."
The three Stanford speakers appear
ing in the contest are John C. Dunni
way, Victor Harding, and Robert E.
Lewis.
