With a good workout yesterday and j
today, the Stanford track team has
begun to taper down its training in
preparation for the Big Meet Saturday '
afternoon.
Trial races for time in the 440, 100,

A trial lap of the 440 was won by |

One of the other two places has been j
filled tentatively by Smith, depending
on whether he runs the 880 with Rich- j
ardson and his strength after the mile.

stride after being boxed twice. Doerr j
has also shown good prospects along |
