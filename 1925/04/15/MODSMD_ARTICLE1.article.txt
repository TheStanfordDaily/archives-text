# CARDINAL TRACKMEN PREPARE FDR BRUIN CONTEST SATURDAY
## Templeton Sends Stanford Runners Through Trial Laps Tuesday 
### Douglas Meservey 
With a good workout yesterday and j
today, the Stanford track team has
begun to taper down its training in
preparation for the Big Meet Saturday '
afternoon.
Trial races for time in the 440, 100,
and hurdles were run yesterday on:
the stadium track. Coach R. L. Temple- j
ton seemed pleased with the results |
and from now on will keep his men j
under cover.
A trial lap of the 440 was won by |
Babcock who finished in :51 3-5 with
Sherman second and Doerr third. ;
Miller did not run. Templeton has not I
announced his selections for the relay |
but it is understood that Richardson ;
and Miller are certain to be in it. !
One of the other two places has been j
filled tentatively by Smith, depending
on whether he runs the 880 with Rich- j
ardson and his strength after the mile.
Babcock Relay Prospect
The fourth place will be taken by
one of the three men who finished 1
the trial quarter yesterday, and pos- j
sibly two if Smith does not run. Bab
cock is nearly certain of a place, fin- ,
ishing yesterday with a strong, even |
stride after being boxed twice. Doerr j
has also shown good prospects along |
with Sherman.
Charles, Cardinal hope for first j
place in the two-mile, is reported as j
greatly improved from a siege of j
grippe. He attended classes Tuesday |
and is slowly regaining strength. It is i
doubtful, however, if he will be able
to fulfill predictions as to a fir«t in the
two-mile because of the sickness.
Hartranft, Gaspar Best Sprinters
Hartranft and Gaspar looked the
best of the sprinters yesterday and
have for the past two meets. On a
dry track it is netirely possible that
Gaspar will take a second or third in
either of the dashes, for he certainly
has the start. Hartranft, on the other
hand, has improved his start also, and
1 if he gets the jump on Barber, who
! is naturally high-strung, he may re
peat Campbell's performance of last
year and leave the California man in
I the dust.
Campbell did not look so good yes
terday but neither did he before the
! Big Meet last year when he won the
' century. A poor start has been handi
i capping him lately, other than his re-
I covery from weak arches, and if he
leaves the mark fast Saturday he has
la good chance of placing in the 220,
| his favorite distance.

cock is nearly certain of a place, fin- ,
ishing yesterday with a strong, even |
stride after being boxed twice. Doerr j
has also shown good prospects along |
with Sherman.
Charles, Cardinal hope for first j
place in the two-mile, is reported as j
greatly improved from a siege of j
grippe. He attended classes Tuesday |
and is slowly regaining strength. It is i
doubtful, however, if he will be able
to fulfill predictions as to a fir«t in the
two-mile because of the sickness.
Hartranft, Gaspar Best Sprinters
Hartranft and Gaspar looked the
best of the sprinters yesterday and
have for the past two meets. On a
dry track it is netirely possible that
Gaspar will take a second or third in
either of the dashes, for he certainly
has the start. Hartranft, on the other
hand, has improved his start also, and
1 if he gets the jump on Barber, who
! is naturally high-strung, he may re
peat Campbell's performance of last
year and leave the California man in
I the dust.
Campbell did not look so good yes
terday but neither did he before the
! Big Meet last year when he won the
' century. A poor start has been handi
i capping him lately, other than his re-
I covery from weak arches, and if he
leaves the mark fast Saturday he has
la good chance of placing in the 220,
| his favorite distance.
With a good workout yesterday and j
today, the Stanford track team has
begun to taper down its training in
preparation for the Big Meet Saturday '
afternoon.
Trial races for time in the 440, 100,
and hurdles were run yesterday on:
the stadium track. Coach R. L. Temple- j
ton seemed pleased with the results |
and from now on will keep his men j
under cover.
A trial lap of the 440 was won by |
Babcock who finished in :51 3-5 with
Sherman second and Doerr third. ;
Miller did not run. Templeton has not I
announced his selections for the relay |
but it is understood that Richardson ;
and Miller are certain to be in it. !
One of the other two places has been j
filled tentatively by Smith, depending
on whether he runs the 880 with Rich- j
ardson and his strength after the mile.
Babcock Relay Prospect
The fourth place will be taken by
one of the three men who finished 1
the trial quarter yesterday, and pos- j
sibly two if Smith does not run. Bab
cock is nearly certain of a place, fin- ,
ishing yesterday with a strong, even |
stride after being boxed twice. Doerr j
has also shown good prospects along |
