# ELEPHANTS, CAMELS, AND EVERYTHING ELSE COMING TO PALO ALTO
## 
### 
"Lad-ees and gentlemen, on the left
we have the original man Friday who
spent Saturday night with Robinson
Crusoe. On the right "

Elephants, lemonade (synthetic),
tinsel, glamor, crowds, all of them will
be there when A1 G. Barnes and his
wild animal show comes to Palo Alto
for a demonstration on April 28.

The curious can again gaze wide
eyed at the thinnest man and the
fattest woman. The elemental can
once more delight in the antics of the
trained Iberian Zooikah, and we can
all have our slapstick.

A parade—hey rube!—a mile long,
and one and all are invited to come
and watch the camel walk a league for
a man who can well afford to pay
more.
