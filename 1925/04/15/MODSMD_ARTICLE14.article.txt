Though the Pacific Fleet didn't pull
up anchor from its moorings near the
Golden Gate and steam down the
peninsula to Palo Alto, a miniature
naval battle took place on Lagunita.
Two canoes cruising on the lake
collided. The angry sailors whipped
out their paddles and began a fight i
which has never been equalled in the
naval history of Lagunita. Not being
satisfied with splashing water they j
leaped into each other's canoes. Both :
boats were overturned and their fully
dressed crews were drenched.
There were no fatalities as the bat-,
tie took place but a few feet from the
bank and the sailors could easily wade
ashore.
