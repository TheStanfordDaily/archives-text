## 
### 
Seven Stanford water polo stars,
who will in all probability see action
in the national meet, yesterday battled
the fast Illinois Athletic Club team
to a 1-1 tie in a practice game in the
' Encina pool.
Marked improvement was shown by
the Cardinals and their mark yester
day practically places them in the
running for first place honors in the
water polo event of the A. A. U. meet.
The I. A. C. team has been favored
to win this event.
Perry McGillvray, veteran of the
Olympiads, was not in the I. A. C.
lineup yesterday, and as he is rated
: as one of the best water polo players
!in the United States his presence in
the actual meet may be a deciding
â–  factor.
I Collett, at goal guard, played the
oustanding game yesterday by stop
ping numerous I. A. C. throws. Carson
! and MacAllister were both showing
I rare form.
