# The 						United Campaign

### 
Although a large measure of success has come from the efforts of the
workers for the United Campaign, a recent letter from that group suggests
that their charity drive cannot be wholly satisfactory except as it repre
sents the entire student-body.

Various students lend greater or less financial support according to
their means. No matter what size the contribution, the committee desires
to give everybody the chance to help. In order that this may be possible
the solicitors must see everybody and they rightly ask cooperation.
There is a group of strategists who out-maneuver the workers and an
other set of unconquerable alibi hiders. Assurance is offered to these that
only politeness is expected by the solicitors, generosity whenever possible.
Those who cannot afford to make even a small contribution, and there are
such, will have consideration.

Those off-campus residents who cannot be solicited are asked by the
committee to mail contributions to Drive Chairman J. P. Sievers. To
the workers it is more important that everybody cooperate with than that
everybody contribute to this United Stanford Campaign.
