# Debating Interest
## 
### 
Not so long ago debating was on its knees pleading for student body
support. Then the debaters learned the lesson that before could ex
pect student interest they must offer something interesting. Today, de
bating is independent. It bids for patronage on the ground that it will
entertain those who will come to the debates.
The "Medaille Joffre" contest this evening is the second big debate of
this season. The Oxford discussion was an unparalleled success because
the speakers forgot their old court-room logic and realized they were talk
ing to an audience that will not be bored.
A like amount of humor and wit is prophesied for tonight. Of the
six men who will speak, four spoke in the Oxford debates at Stanford and
California. The fifth was a student at Oxford last year and a frequent
participant in the Oxford Union debates. The sixth is a pltaform lec
turer of considerable note.
The Stanford audience is looking forward to one of the most inter
esting evenings of the year.
