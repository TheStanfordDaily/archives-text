# CALIFORNIA GLEE CLUB FEATURES MANY ENTERTAINERS

That "Brick" Morse is the leader of;
the California Glee Club, which is
singing in the Assembly hall Friday j
evening, is not known to most Stan
ford men and women. Under his direc
tion the club has acquired a world
wide fame and has twice given re
citals in Europe and Asia as well as
in all parts of America. Last summer
it toured Europe and in twenty-three
concerts sang to a total of over 120,000
persons. This summer it will make an
extended tour of Alaska and the North
west.
It woyld be hard to pick the main
feature of the Glee Club's repertoire.
The ten-piece jazz band,' the piano
syncopation of Harold Rosenblum, the
saxophone playing of Lawrence Lov
ett, the comic acts of A1 Payne and
George Dyer, combined with other di
verting numbers to make a program
that for sheer entertainment cannot be
matched. The regular fourteen-act
show, as carefully worked out and pre
pared as any vaudeville program, will
be given in its entirety, which means
that the jazz orchestra with Harolfl
Rosenblum directing from the key
board of the piano, will be heard with
the latest hits especially orchestrated
by Rosenblum himself exclusively for
his musicians.
Cris Quales has a chance to show his
skill as a dancer in one of the acts,
and George Dyer's monologues that
have the reputation of invariably set
ting the house in an uproar will be
another one of the "famous fourteen"
entertainments.
With all its novelty acts and stunts
the club is primarily a vocal organiza
tion and have a finished and spirited
execution of its many excellent songs.
The fact that the membership is held
down to twenty-five shows why those
selected from the great numbers avail
able possess voices of unusual merit.
The club has press notices from all
over the world that almost invariably
speak in terms of glowing praise. They
seem to have the faculty of pleasing
audiences of all nationalities and races
to an equal degree. The Berlin Tage
blatt said: "The students, led by Herr
Morse, are great singers." "Glee Club
takes Shanghai by storm" declared
the Shanghai Press, and so on almost
indefinitely.
Tickets are being sold in the Ad
ministration building for the concert.
Later on the Stanford Glee Club will
return the visit by giving a recital on
the Berkeley campus.
