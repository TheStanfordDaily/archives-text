# The 						Duty of Specialization
## 
### 
It is said on reliable authority that this is an age of specialists. There
is a place for everything in this perfect sdcial state and everything should
be in it. It is one's highest duty to discover the occupation for which he
is best fitted and to train himself to perfection. And for this reason there
are ever increasing numbers of medical specialists, athletic specialists,
professors, students, political specialists and what not.
This system is doubtless founded upon the general detestation of work.
Nobody loves work, he loves a kind of employment. The portly gentlemen
whose pictures appear in the success magazines are arrant liars when
they profess to be so attached to labor that they cannot stop. What they
mean is that unless they indulge themselves by satisfying a desire to do
what they do, they would be working. They are quite properly respected.
Obviously, to be successful and to fulfill properly one's obligations to
his fellow man he must become a specialist, which means enjoying himself
effectively. One is morally bound to find his place in life. In the winter
time it is one thing, but now the place is undoubtedly in a canoe under the
willows on the far side of Lagunita. What if there is no present scheme
for remunerating leisure experts. There will be if the profession is de
veloped intelligently and if society is consistent.
And anyway, one can't throw down a social duty, particularly when
the canoe is already rented .
