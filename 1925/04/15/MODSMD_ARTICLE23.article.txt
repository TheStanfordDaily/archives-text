# EX-CONVICTS AND CRIMINALS BEWARE!
## 
### 
Strange as it may seem, we have
been reading the newspapers and, after
noticing therein that jazz music is
driving the younger generation to
thievery, murder, and general naughti
ness, we here suggest a few precau
tions to make the Junior Prom safe
for democracy and insure the pre
servance of life, limb, and the pursuit
of snappiness.
If jazz music is used to dance by,
everyone's life will be in great danger.
We therefore recommend that, instead
of a tuxedo, a suit of armor be worn.
Guards should be placed at regular
intervals on the floor to prevent any
one from stabbing anyone else in the
back.
Watches and valuables should be
checked in safety boxes at the door
to be secure from pickpockets and sec
ond-story men.
Anyone who comes to the dance
carrying a jug of anything will be
regarded with suspicion and watched
carefully.
Small booths of heavy steel armor
plate should be placed along the walls
so that these can be used for protec
tion from the bullets during the fre
quent pistol duels that, will occur.
The windows should be well pro
tected to prevent their being broken
by the flying rocks and hatchets.
The chaperones should be placed in
a heavily armored "pill-box" provided
with machine guns.
A careful check of attendance
should be made to prevent escaped
convicts and lunatics from gaining en
trance. A sanity test of each person
should be made at the door before and
after the dance.
All these precautions and many more
will probably be necessary if the com
mittee in charge of the Junior Prom
persists in engaging a jazz orchestra
furnish the music. —M. E.
