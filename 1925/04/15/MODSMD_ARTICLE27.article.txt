# BORG WILL RETIRE AFTER MAKING NEW SWIMMING RECORDS
## 
### Herbert Klein 
"I'm going to set all world's records
from 400 yards to one mile and then
next year I'm going to retire."
This sounds like a pretty broad
statement, but when it comes from no
less a person than the redoutable
Arne I3org, who is to swiihming what
Nurmi is to running, it is a promise as
well as a threat.
Borg is training daily at the Encina
pool for the national championships
to be held the end of the month in
the Fleischacker Pool, San Francisco.
He is no stranger to the University
for he visited here last year at which
time he set a new world's record in
the half mile.
Borg says he likes the United States,
especially California, and that Sears
ville appeals to him especially. "I am
staying there with my friend, Ernst
Brandsten," he explains.
Self-confidence with capital letters â€”
that might be said to be the dominant
characteristic of this "swimming
Swede." Borg fairly radiates self-assur
ance and is no modest violet when it
comes to discussing his accomplish
ments.
Tall and blonde, with blue eyes, he is
a typical Scandinavian. His physical
makeup would never lead one to sus
pect that he was a world's champion
In some dozen events, for he has none
of the weight or bulging muscles that
swimmers of the type of Norman Ross
or Duke Kohanomoku. Rather he is
thin almost to the point of emaciation
and his muscles are long and tapering.
The same seemingly inexhaustible
energy that enables him to swim lap
after lap with no decrease in speed
shows itself in his constant activity
and alertness on land. He is always
ready for a joke or prank or, best of
all, to tell about himself and his swim
ming.
He has mapped out an ambitious
program for himself in the Nationals.
He will swim in four events and when
* Borg swims in a race it means that he
is planning, and confidently expecting,
to win. He is entered in the 500 yards,
220 yards, medley, and pentathlon
events. For the pentathlon diving ia
required and this Arne is practicing
faithfully to learn under Brandflten'3
direction. He will learn it, too, for his
is the kind of nature that is not
stopped by difficulties simply because
it does not recognize that there are
such things.
