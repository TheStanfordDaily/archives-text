UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA,
April 15. â€”One of the evenest and
hardest-fought track meets seen on
the Pacific Coast in many a day should
take place when the California and
Stanford tracksters clash next Satur
day, April 18.

Last season's trouncing the Bears
received at the hands of the Cardinals
will not be repeated, for during the
year Coach Walter Christie has de
veloped an experienced track team
that, on paper at least, looks several
points better than the Cards.

The sprints should go to California
and the distance runs to Stanford. The
field is evenly divided in regard to
first places but California should take
more points than the Cards due ta the
fact that they have a good chance of
scoring all the points in the javelin
and the pole vault. Stanford is con
ceded first in the shot-put and the dis
cus throw, but the Bruins have a good
chance to cop the other two places in
these events.

The broad jump should be a good
event to watch as the two leading
jumpers from the teams are making
about the same distance, 22 feet 10
inches. The high jump should also be
a five-four event. The Bears should
capture five points for first place but
the Cards should take the remaining
two places for four points.
