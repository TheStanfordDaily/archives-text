# DEBATERS ARE READY FOR JOFFRE CLASH
## Contest With California Tonight Thirty-First On French Policy Since Innovation In 1895 
### Calvin Behle 
Represented by Robert E. Lewis,
Victor H. Harding, and John C. Duni
j way, Stanford debaters will meet the
; California team composed of Harold
F. Cherniss, Raymond G. Stanbury,
i and Bernard E. Witkin, in the thirty
j first Joffre debate since the first con
; test was held between the two schdols.
1 The debate will take place this eve
-1 ning at 8 o'clock in the Assembly hall.
The origin of the debate was in
1 1895, when Baron Pierre de Coubertin,
; scion of one of the oldest French
j families, offered a medal to the indi
l vidual winner of a forensic contest
! between California and Stanford. The
i Baron, who is an internationally-known
educator and patron of philanthropic
i work, in 1893 visited the bay region
and while here listened to the infer
i collegiate debate between these two

schools. Impressed with the interest
paid to this activity, the Baron, on his
| return to France, endowed the an
i nual contest, stipulating only that the
I question be one on French policy,
i The debate at that time was named

jthe "Medaille Carnot" in memory of
! the martyred French president, but
in 1917, through action of the Baron,
was changed to the "Medaille Joffre"
in honor of the "Hero of the Marne."
Stanford will be represented by
three speakers, Lewis, Harding, and
I Duniway, who have records of ex
; perience in fields other than forensic.
; Harding, an ex-captain in the recent

war, participated in the LaFollette
campaign last fall, while Duniway has
debated both at Colorado College and
as a member of the Oxford Union.
The third speaker, Lewis, was a
member of the teams facing the Ox
ford three both at Stanford and in San
Francisco. His speech on "Freedom of
Speech Under the Constitution" given
in the intercollegiate meet two years
ago at Los Angeles was published
serially in Los Angeles papers.
Cherniss, Stanbury, and Witkin, the
California trio, are veterans of the
Joffre debate last year and participated
in the Oxford debate this winter. They
are seniors and will be appearing in
their last collegiate contest.
Chester H. Rowell, Associate Editor
of "World's Work," is to be the chair
man. The judges will be Colonel Allen
G. Wright, former judge-advocate of
the United States army; Hon. Beverly

| L. Hodgehead of San Francisco, and
Professor Robert T. Crane of the
political science department of the
University of Michigan.

At six o'clock tonight the sealed
envelope containing the question for
debate will be opened, allowing the
speakers two hours in which to pre
pare. The question, a specific one on
the general topic of "French Policy in
Asia," has been selected by Professor
Carlton Hayes of Columbia University.

Knox Miller, Bertrand Comparet,
and Robert Littler, all of Stanford,;
have been victors in the debate for
the last three years.
