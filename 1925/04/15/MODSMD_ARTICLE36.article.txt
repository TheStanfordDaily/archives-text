# ACT PROVIDING FOR NEW POSTAL RATES GOES INTO EFFECT
## All But First Class Matter Rates Raised by Latest Postal Charges 
### 
The new postal rates, under the act
of February 28, 1925, go into effect
today. This act provides for a change
in all except first class rates, and
raised the salaries of all regular clerks
and carriers.
Parcel Post now includes everything
over 8 ounces except regular first and
second class matter. The rates will be
the same, but there will be a new
service charge of two cents on every
package.
A new and faster Parcel Post ser
vice will be inaugurated in the "spe
cial handling." All Parcel Post pack
ages sent under this service will be
subject to an additional charge of
twenty-five cents. This will provide
for their being given regular first class
handling while en route on the trains,
thus securing a prompter delivery to
their*destination. It will not, however,
include a special delivery service on
the receiving end.
The new Special Delivery rates are
ten cents on everything up to two
pounds; fifteen cents on packages
from two to ten pounds; and twenty
cents for all packages over ten pounds.
Registration charges will be fifteen
cents on all packages having a value
up to fifty dollars, and twenty cents on
packages up to one hundred dollars.
There will be an additional charge of
3 cents for a return receipt.
The postage on all postcards, ex
cepting the one-cent stamped govern
ment cards, will be two cents.
The rate on second class matter,
when sent by other than publishers,
will be two cents for each two ounces.
Publishers' rates have been raised in
some zones and lowered in others.
Third class matter has a straight
rate of one and one-half cents for
every two ounces or fraction.
Charges on Parcel Post insurance
and domestic money order rates have
been increased.
The half-cent charges on third class
matter have necessitated an issue of
one-half and one and one-half cent
stamps. These will have pictures of
Nathan Hale and Harding, respective
ly. There is also a new special issue of
one, two, and five cent stamps com
memorating the 150 th anniversary of
the Battle of Lexington and Concord,
picturing various events of the battle.

Members of the faculty of the Uni
versity of Kansas will vote on whether
or not they approve of the wearing of
caps and gowns at the commencement
exercises.
