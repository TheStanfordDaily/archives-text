# SWIMMERS COMPETE FRIDAY IN ANNUAL INTRAMURAL MEET
## 
### 
Fraternity and hall swimmers will
have their chance to put their or
ganizations to the front next Friday
when the annual intramural swimming
meet is staged in Encina pool. Special
exhibitions of swimming and diving
I by the visiting I. A. C. national cham
: pionship team now training on the
| campus for the coming national events
at San Francisco will feature the after
noon's program.
The full schedule of events for Fri
i day's races is being drawn up today.
The schedule will be similar to that
I of last year which included almost all
of the shorter distance events and an
800-foot relay together with diving.
The title last year was captured by
Phi Delta Theta by a good margin.
Varsity, Frosh Eligible
Varsity and freshman team mem
bers are eligible to compete and some
good times will probably be hung up.
I El Toro and Breakers are expected to
I give the Phi Delts a closer race this
year than last, although the row men
are heavy favorites.
Plans are being made to have Arne
Borg swim a 500-yard race against a
picked team of five freshmen, but ac
j cording to Borg this exhibition will
probably be held until after the na
tional events. Brandsten has enough
freshmen that can swim the three laps
in an average of 1:09 and to beat
i this outfit Borg would have to shatter
; a world's record.
