# STANFORD POLOISTS LOSE TO INFANTRY
## 
### 
The Stanford polo team lost the first
tilt of the three-game series with the
30th Infantry yesterday by a score of
8 to 4 in a fast and interesting game.
Considerable improvement was shown
by the 30th since the Del Monte trip.
Stanford play was ragged in spots,
and showed that the loss of Irwin is
felt to a great extent.

Dorcy, playing at 2 in Irwin's place,
at times showed his inexperience in
polo, but with more participation in
fast match play should soon be settled
in the position, which will enable the
team to return its usual smooth game.
Thomas played a very good game at

No. 1, there being a decided improve
ment in his hitting. Laub was consist-
ent, as usual. Trotter, who scored
three goals, was the star of the Stan
ford team.
The goals for the 30th Infantry were
evenly distributed, Dulaney at No. 1
scoring two, Dierking at No. 2 scor
ing two, Stone at 3 scoring one, and
Captain Scott at 4 scoring three. Cap
tain Scott was the outstanding star
of the game, accounting for some of
(he longest shots seen at Stanford this
year.
It is interesting to note that the
30th and Stanford have played foil
match games this year, Stanford win
ning two, and the 30th winning two.
In these games Stanford has scored
24 goals, and the 30th has scored 25.
This shows the teams to bo about

equal in strength, and an interesting
match should result each time they
meet.

The Stanford polo team lost the first
tilt of the three-game series with the
30th Infantry yesterday by a score of
8 to 4 in a fast and interesting game.
Considerable improvement was shown
by the 30th since the Del Monte trip.
Stanford play was ragged in spots,
and showed that the loss of Irwin is
felt to a great extent.

Dorcy, playing at 2 in Irwin's place,
at times showed his inexperience in
polo, but with more participation in
fast match play should soon be settled
in the position, which will enable the
team to return its usual smooth game.
Thomas played a very good game at

No. 1, there being a decided improve
ment in his hitting. Laub was consist-
ent, as usual. Trotter, who scored
three goals, was the star of the Stan
ford team.
The goals for the 30th Infantry were
evenly distributed, Dulaney at No. 1
scoring two, Dierking at No. 2 scor
ing two, Stone at 3 scoring one, and
Captain Scott at 4 scoring three. Cap
tain Scott was the outstanding star
of the game, accounting for some of
(he longest shots seen at Stanford this
year.
It is interesting to note that the
30th and Stanford have played foil
match games this year, Stanford win
ning two, and the 30th winning two.
In these games Stanford has scored
24 goals, and the 30th has scored 25.
This shows the teams to bo about

equal in strength, and an interesting
match should result each time they
meet.
The lineup:
Stanford — 30th Infantry—
| Thomas 1 Dulaney
Dorcy, Brown 2 Dierking
J Laub 3 Stone
Trotter . 4 Scott
Referee: Capt. John M. Jenkins, Jr.
