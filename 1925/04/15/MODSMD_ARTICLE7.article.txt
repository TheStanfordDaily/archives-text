## Originally an Experiment Alumni Gathering Now Campus Institution

"Writing about University Day is
like taking a correspondence course in
swimming—the piano stool may be a
great aid in practicing various strokes,
but with the parlor technique acquired
the real test comes when you hit the
water," says an old grad in writing
a report of the second celebration of
University Day.

April 18, 1925, will be the fifth time
that Stanford will celebrate University
Day as the real time for all alumni to
return to the campus. Four years ago
a group of San Francisco and Palo
Alto alumni decided that they should
come back to the campus at some
other time than at commencement, be
cause coming at that time there was
nothing to attract them, all the under
graduates were gone, and their stay
was a very dull and uneventful one.
As a result of their discussion and ef
forts, the University invited them
back to a mid-quarter home-coming.
First Celebration in 1921
Before this the Alumni Advisory
Board made an annual visit to the
University and with the establishment
of University Day this was adopted
as the date for their gathering. The
day set was May 14, 1921. With only
a month to prepare for the event it
was naturally impromptu. The gue«ts
were entertained much in the same
way as they are now, enjoying first a
luncheon at the President's home, fol
lowed by a student review which in
cluded swimming, water polo, and ten
nis. Charles K. Field, '95, presided at
the dinner held at Roble hall in the
evening. Tints the first University Day,
while an experiment, and started with
many misgivings, proved to be a suc
cess.
University Day an Institution
It was soon found that in one year
University Day had become an insti
tution and not an experiment. The
alumni were more enthusiastic each
year and the success of the event des
rined to make a tradition out of a cus
tom,
Last year the day was celebrated
on April 26, and the classes of '94, *99,
'04, '14, '19, and '22 held reunion lunch
eons. This year '95, *00, '05, '10, *15, '20,
and *23 will celebrate in like manner.
These are the only two years that
class luncheons have been held at this
time, but having proved a success, it
will undoubtedly be adopted as a per
manent part of the University Day
program in the future.
National Board Meets
Last year with the establishment of
(he Stanford National Board another
opportunity was offered to bring an
important group of alumni back to the
campus, as the Board of Trustees set
University Day for its annual meeting
with the new National Board.
This year has been added the annual
meeting of the Alumni Council formed
last year under the new alumni con
stitution.

Fielding H. Yost recently celebrated
his twenty-fifth consecutive years as
football coach at the University of
Michigan.

University Day an Institution
It was soon found that in one year
University Day had become an insti
tution and not an experiment. The
alumni were more enthusiastic each
year and the success of the event des
rined to make a tradition out of a cus
tom,
Last year the day was celebrated
on April 26, and the classes of '94, *99,
'04, '14, '19, and '22 held reunion lunch
eons. This year '95, *00, '05, '10, *15, '20,
and *23 will celebrate in like manner.
These are the only two years that
class luncheons have been held at this
time, but having proved a success, it
will undoubtedly be adopted as a per
manent part of the University Day
program in the future.
National Board Meets
Last year with the establishment of
(he Stanford National Board another
opportunity was offered to bring an
important group of alumni back to the
campus, as the Board of Trustees set
University Day for its annual meeting
with the new National Board.
This year has been added the annual
meeting of the Alumni Council formed
last year under the new alumni con
stitution.

Fielding H. Yost recently celebrated
his twenty-fifth consecutive years as
football coach at the University of
Michigan.
"Writing about University Day is
like taking a correspondence course in
swimming—the piano stool may be a
great aid in practicing various strokes,
but with the parlor technique acquired
the real test comes when you hit the
water," says an old grad in writing
a report of the second celebration of
University Day.

April 18, 1925, will be the fifth time
that Stanford will celebrate University
Day as the real time for all alumni to
return to the campus. Four years ago
a group of San Francisco and Palo
Alto alumni decided that they should
come back to the campus at some
other time than at commencement, be
cause coming at that time there was
nothing to attract them, all the under
graduates were gone, and their stay
was a very dull and uneventful one.
As a result of their discussion and ef
forts, the University invited them
back to a mid-quarter home-coming.
First Celebration in 1921
Before this the Alumni Advisory
Board made an annual visit to the
University and with the establishment
of University Day this was adopted
as the date for their gathering. The
day set was May 14, 1921. With only
a month to prepare for the event it
was naturally impromptu. The gue«ts
were entertained much in the same
way as they are now, enjoying first a
luncheon at the President's home, fol
lowed by a student review which in
cluded swimming, water polo, and ten
nis. Charles K. Field, '95, presided at
the dinner held at Roble hall in the
evening. Tints the first University Day,
while an experiment, and started with
many misgivings, proved to be a suc
cess.
