### Aurelio Espinosa 
Phi Gamma Delta narrowed the bat
tle for the plaque in League V down
to a contest between two fraternities,
the Dekes and the Fijis, by eliminat
ing the strong Phi Kappa Sigma nine
yesterday, 7 to 0. Both teams have
two easy games apiece before they
tangle for the championship of the
league on May 6.

Other results were: Delta Kappa
Epsilon 4, Delta Chi 1; Sigma Alpha
Epsilon 10, Delta Tau Delta 8. Kappa
Sigma took its second straight vic
tory in League IV by winning by de
fault from the Independents; and Los
Arcos won by a forfeit from Encina
Basement which lost last week to the
Dekes.

Tight pitching by Grace and heavy
hitting by Adams and Broenkow en
abled the Fijis to defeat the Phi Kaps,
who had previously blanked Los Arcos.
Grace allowed the Phi Kaps one hit
and one walk, keeping them under
control at all times. He made the
strike-out record of the day by fanning
1G men. Wright,* Phi Kap hurler, tight
ened up the game by fanning 10 Fijis.

The Fijis took an early lead when
they clouted out two hits for two runs
in the second. Two more followed in

the fifth, and they put the game on ice
when Elliott, Blazier, and Adams
scored in the sixth. Broenkow, besides
playing a perfect game behind the bat,
â€¢won leading slugger honors by smash
ing out three safe blows in as many
trips to the plate.

The Dekes gave the most perfect
fielding exhibition of the intramural
Reason in defeating the Delta Chis
4 to 1. Every man on the nine accepted
fielding chances, and only one error
was chalked up against them.

Fuller pitched the first five innings
for the Dekes and allowed one run in
the fifth. He was relieved in the sixth
by McDonald who held the Delta Chis
hitless for the remainder of the game.

The S. A. E.'s defeated the Delta
Taus in a slugging contest, 10 to 8.
Collett for the Delta Taus was hit six
times, while Gibbons and Stevenson,
S. A. E. hurlers, were pounded for ten.

up an early lead of three runs in the j
first inning, when Keyes smashed out I
a home run with two men on base, j
Three more runs followed in the sec- |
ond, and another in the fourth, bring- !
ing the total up to 7.
The Delta Tau nine tied fhe count
seven all in the fourth, when Morrison i
smashed out a three-bagger with the j
bases full. The Delta Taus led in the i
seventh by one run, but Bledsoe of
