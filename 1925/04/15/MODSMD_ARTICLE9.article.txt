# "Cardinal Capers" Has Action For Grads On University Day
## 
### Wallace Knox 
Concentrated action will be the key
note of "Cardinal Capers" in the As
sembly hall Saturday night. The four
acts, as originally planned, have been
put together into three acts, which in
sures action and vivacity every min
ute. The fewer number of acts will
enable the audience to reach the
Alumni dance in'the pavilion consider
ably earlier than under the previous
arrangement.
"The Night of the Garter" is the
name of a feature skit in which Velma
Randall and Elizabeth Crebs will ap
pear in a song and dance act. This
number has been appealing to those
watching rehearsals during the week,
and it is expected 'hat it will go over
"big" with the audience.
Irving Anschutz will appear with the
chorus in a clever song number. Byron
i erstwhile "Classy Clancy,"

will attempt to again please the audi
ence as he did in the llam's Head
show with some of his Russian danc
ing. Allen Campbell is another who
has arranged an unusual stunt, his
being a female impersonation.
Baron Dawes has gathered an un
usual quarter of saxophone players
who will give several song hits. Be
sides Dawes, George Baker, J. Earle
May, and Philip Brooks will be in this
act.
Norris James has written a skit en
titled "Perpetual Motion," which has
been substituted for the parodical
satire on Paavo Nurmi, previously in
j eluded in the show. The theme is a
melodramatic rehearsal of a Broadway
! success, with frantic directors and
property men hectically trying to get
t'leif show organized. The cast includes
|Phil Umer, Grove Day, Dorothy Dahler,
William Pabst, David Mannoccir, and
j Charles Parks.
