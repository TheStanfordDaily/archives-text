# CAL GLEE CLUB HAS JAZZ BAND HUt SPECIALTIES
## Bear Singers' Program Will Have Vaudeville Acts Tomorrow Evening 
### Herbert Klein 
"As good as anything in vaudeville"
is one of the comments heard most
often concerning the "famous fourteen
features" that are to be part of the
recital in the Assembly hall tomorrow
night of the California Glee Club. The
same fourteen-act show that has tick
led audiences in Shanghai, made them
roar in Scotland, guffaw in Manila, and
split their sides in Hong Kong on for
eign tours of the club is expected to
make a hit here, to say the least. A
judicious mixture of club singing and
jazz band- playing, of comic skits and
instrumental solos, gives the Berkeley
program a universal and almost irre
sistible appeal.
The concert comes just at the right
time to put all those who attend in the
proper frame of mind for the festivi
ties of University Day. Jazz and popu
lar music are only a part of the reper
toire of the club. Their singing in
cludes everything from college songs
to operatic selections and the works
of such composers as Mendelssohn,
Offenbach, Gounod, Wagner, and Verdi
are presented by the singers.
Quality rather than mere size has
been the aim of C. R. "Brick" Morse,
director of the Glee Club. For (his
reason the membership is restricted to
twenty-five and the competition that
must be met in getting into the club is
extremely keen. The same group whom
last summer made a grand tour of the
United States and Europe will be heard
Friday night. Next summer in July
the same men will travel to Alaska
and the Pacific Northwest.
Next to the vocal chorus itself in
fame and popularity and dividing pro
gram honors with it is the jazz band
made up of ten musicians, each one
a soloist on his instrument and
through long experience fitting in per
fectly with the rest. Three of the
members of the bamt-appear in sepa
rate solos. They are Lawrence Lovett,
Chester Cluck, and Hal Rosenblum
who is possessed of the ability to make
the piano give out some fine syncopa
tion. Rosenblum is vice-president of
the Glee Club and director of the
band for which he makes special ar
rangements of the latest popular hits.
In his act he sings to his own accom
paniment with a cleverness that has
made his part of the program one of
the most popular.
Comic acts and monologues are the
specialties of A1 Payne and George
Dyer and they have the ability do put
their stunts across. Cris Quales' clever
toes have pleased the audiences be
fore whom he has done his dancing
act.
A few tickets are fctill available in
the Administration building.
