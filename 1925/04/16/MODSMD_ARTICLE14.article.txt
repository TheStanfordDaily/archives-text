# Storie Recovered From Illness; Will Compete In Big Meet Saturday
## 
### 
Bill Storie, Stanford's quarter-miler,
i has sufficiently recovered from his recent
i illness to be able to participate in either i
the 440 or the relay against California,:
' Saturday. Storie has been under the care
of a physician for several months, but
! yesterday was declared physically capable ;
: of competing in the big meet.
Last year his performance in taking a
| second in the 440 against California with
practically no training, liailed him as a
coming champion. Whether or not he 1
1 will be able to repeat this act is purely a i
i matter of conjecture, but his presence will ,
be looked forward to with great' expecta- 1
tion by all Stanford supporters.
