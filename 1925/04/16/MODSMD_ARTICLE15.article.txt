ers. should give Phi Delta Theta one
of the hardest battles yet for the
trophy. The Phi Psi team will be built |
largely around McCallister, Myers, and
Mack, all of whom are varsity swim-,

The Beta team, while lacking the
sure high point winners of the Phi Psi

relay team for the Betas as well as

has a good day, amass enough points
