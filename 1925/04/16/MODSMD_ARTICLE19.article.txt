# SIXTY ENTERED By CHRISTIE IN MEET SATURDAY
## Bears to Depend on Second, Third-Place Entries to Defeat Cards 
### Douglas Meservey 
Sixty men have been entered by
Coach Walter Christie of California
in the Big Meet Saturday. The Bear
mentor has conceded a number of
first places to the Cardinal tracksters
but believes that he has enough sec
ond and third place men to assure him
a victory.
Beyond Garner and Barber, Christie
has no one who can win him five
points without a struggle. A number of
possible firsts, however, in various
events for the Bruins are as follows:
-Ross in the mile. There is a chance
that Schwobeda may force his team
mate to step, but Christie will prob
ably save him foi' the two-mile. In
either case, Ross will have to stretch
out around 4:22 for both Smith and
Kerr of Stanford are not only deter
mined to do that time, but are capable
of it. ■
Schwobeda in TWo-Mil?
Schwobeda in the two-mile. Two
weeks ago even California followers
would hate given Charles this event
if they had seeft. his sprint and easy
finish in 9:54. His recent sickness,
however, gives the Bear distance man
a good chance to win unless Charleß
makes a phenomenal recovery.
Bondshu in the broad jump. With
Meeks, Macßae, and Crookslrank jump
ing around 22 feet 9 inches a supreme
effort by one may give him an addi
tional inch and first place. Bondshu
has won two meets this year at 22
feet 10 inches and is therefore quite
capable of going over that mark Sat
urday with good competition.
Hampton in High Jump
Hampton in the high jump. He was
beaten by a fraction of an inch last
year in the freshman meet by Work
and has not equalled the latter's marks
this season. Both men are capable of
6 feet 3 inches, however.
Glenn Dodson in the javelin. Evers
has thrown 190 feet in practice but
cannot get up to it in competition. He
is also suffering this week from a
strained becak which may handicap
him.
A review of the possible third place,
men in each event would be:
Gaspar against Clymer in the dashes
with the former favored because of
experience.
Doerr against Crane in the 440.
Smith against Chase in the #80, be
ing favored through his strength and
finish.
Wells and Dole against Ragan in
the hurdles. Wells has a good chance
in the lows since Ragan has been far
behind in most California meets.
Hoffman against Francis in the
weights.
Muhs and Kemnitzer against Mc-
Gowan in the high jump. McGowan
will do around 5 feet 11 »s will Kem
nitzer while Muhs is erratic and may
go over 6 feet if he $ases up.
Shipkey against V. Dodson in the
Javelin.

would hate given Charles this event
if they had seeft. his sprint and easy
finish in 9:54. His recent sickness,
however, gives the Bear distance man
a good chance to win unless Charleß
makes a phenomenal recovery.
Bondshu in the broad jump. With
Meeks, Macßae, and Crookslrank jump
ing around 22 feet 9 inches a supreme
effort by one may give him an addi
tional inch and first place. Bondshu
has won two meets this year at 22
feet 10 inches and is therefore quite
capable of going over that mark Sat
urday with good competition.
Hampton in High Jump
Hampton in the high jump. He was
beaten by a fraction of an inch last
year in the freshman meet by Work
and has not equalled the latter's marks
this season. Both men are capable of
6 feet 3 inches, however.
Glenn Dodson in the javelin. Evers
has thrown 190 feet in practice but
cannot get up to it in competition. He
is also suffering this week from a
strained becak which may handicap
him.
A review of the possible third place,
men in each event would be:
Gaspar against Clymer in the dashes
with the former favored because of
experience.
Doerr against Crane in the 440.
Smith against Chase in the #80, be
ing favored through his strength and
finish.
Wells and Dole against Ragan in
the hurdles. Wells has a good chance
in the lows since Ragan has been far
behind in most California meets.
Hoffman against Francis in the
weights.
Muhs and Kemnitzer against Mc-
Gowan in the high jump. McGowan
will do around 5 feet 11 »s will Kem
nitzer while Muhs is erratic and may
go over 6 feet if he $ases up.
Shipkey against V. Dodson in the
Javelin.
Sixty men have been entered by
Coach Walter Christie of California
in the Big Meet Saturday. The Bear
mentor has conceded a number of
first places to the Cardinal tracksters
but believes that he has enough sec
ond and third place men to assure him
a victory.
Beyond Garner and Barber, Christie
has no one who can win him five
points without a struggle. A number of
possible firsts, however, in various
events for the Bruins are as follows:
-Ross in the mile. There is a chance
that Schwobeda may force his team
mate to step, but Christie will prob
ably save him foi' the two-mile. In
either case, Ross will have to stretch
out around 4:22 for both Smith and
Kerr of Stanford are not only deter
mined to do that time, but are capable
of it. ■
Schwobeda in TWo-Mil?
Schwobeda in the two-mile. Two
weeks ago even California followers
would hate given Charles this event

makes a phenomenal recovery.
