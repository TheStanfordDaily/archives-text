# Rally

After two quarters of leading peeps, the cheer-leaders are making a
last desperate effort to induce Stanford to yell again. What has been
jestingly referred to as the Cardinal rooting section has utterly failed to
distinguish itself so far this year with any vocal achievement, in spite of
the best efforts of the leaders and of an excellent rally committee.
During both the football and basketball series the varsity hollerers
washed-out. When the teams were winning, the rooters were in pande
monium. When the others led, a more meek chorus could not have been
got together. What made the weakness even more obvious was that the
enemy kept up a desperate, fighting support no matter how the game went.
It is not a pleasant reflection on the courage of the Cardinal
The comparative smallness of the section, puts Stanford yippers at a
disadvantage. What should be obvious is that they must yell the harder.
Stanford's varsities deserve support. They give their best, win or lose.
So should the rest of us.
This evening the spring sports rally will be held on the shores of La
gunita. If ever there was a time for inspired yelling it will be at the track
meet Saturday. It will be a close test and the victory will go to the stoutest
hearts. It is entirely conceivable that men may be nosed out of points for
lack of backing. Let it not be the Cardinals. Stanford needs every ounce
of strength.
Everybody must help. The best way to discover how is to roar to the
skies at tonight's rally. Get behind it!
