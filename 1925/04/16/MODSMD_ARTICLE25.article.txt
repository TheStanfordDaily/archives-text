"The Swan" —Columbia. — Henry
Miller and a distinguished cast opened
their San Francisco season at the
Columbia theatre Tuesday evening
with Terence Malmar's brilliant com
edy, "The Swan." And before we for
get, let us place proper emphasis upon
the distinguished cast—not that Mr.
Miller wasn't first-rate, but because
the cast is so excellent —particularly
the younger members —that it is quite
a delightful surprise.
Margalo Gilmore in the role of the
Princess Alexandra was beautiful.
More than that, she was gorgeous. She
is an exceedingly charming young
lady and in her naive and poetic char
acterization proved a delight to every
one. Her reading was most inspiring.
Henry Miller has an unusually good
type—that of the genial and altogether
human Father Hyacinth and does more
than full justice to his part. He was
very strong and made his audience
"live with him," as some writers are
prone to remark.
The remainder of the company is
brilliant —even scintillating (this ad
jective is reserved for special occa
sions) at times —from Mr. Philip Mer
inate (he of the splendid voice) as
Prince Albert, to Knox Kincaid and
William Pearce as the sons of the
royal family. As this is not a San
Francisco newspaper, we may say that
we did not like Laura Hope Crews, ex
cept in the third act. She is an excel
lent actress, no doubt, but her efforts
to dominate the first and second acts
—particularly the second —were al
most pathetic, if they hadn't been so
obvious. Anyway, Miss Gilmore was
wonderful.
The play was staged with great
finesse and does credit to Mr. Miller
and his stage force. The second act
set (the supper room of the castle)
was superb, and was probably one of
the best, sets ever produced in San
Francisco. Anyway, Miss Gilmore was
lovely.—R. J. T.
