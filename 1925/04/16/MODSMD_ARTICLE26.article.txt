# PROFESSOR GILBERT WELL GO TO ALASKA FOR FISH RESEARCH
## 
### 
Professor C. H. Gilbert, executive
head of the Zoology department, is
leaving in May for a four months' stay
in Alaska where he will carry on ex
tensive research work in salmon con
servation under the United States Bu
reau of Fisheries.
Professor Gilbert has been inter
ested in salmon life for a long time,
having spent his summers in Alaska
for the past nine years. This summer
he is planning to spend most of his
time on Kodiak Island but will also
go to Bering sea and southeastern
Alaska.
One of the great problems of the
Bureau of Fisheries is to determine
the migration routes of salmon in the
sea and find their final destination.
This is accomplished by going out in
a small fishing boat to the fishing
grounds where the salmon enter the
sea after spawning in the inland
rivers, and attaching a numbered me
tallic tag to the tail of the fish.
Great numbers of salmon are caught
and tagged in this manner. After a
certain period of time the salmon are
re-caught and by the number on the
tag it is possible to figure out the
desired information.
Many salmon travel uncomprehend
able distances in their watery course.
Dr. Gilbert has in his office a tagged
tail of a salmon that had swum from
an island off the coast of Alaska across
the Pacific to Siberia which is a dis
tance of two thousand miles.

At the University of Oregon only
four entering freshmen passed the
English A test this quarter.
