And the ship sails on through the
stormy sea,
With a spray-covered lass at the
prow;
But the man at the stern keeps the
rudder's turn
Never the same—enow!
It is easy enough to criticize; but
for the sake of peace investigate be
fore you do it too vehemently.
Oliver Wendell Holmes once ob
served "There are heads that can't
wear hats." Yes, if it isn't one thing
one's head can't do it is bound to be
another.
In the soul of every man, alas, is
the constantly recurring conflict be
tween Great Moments and executive
plans. When the former win out the
result is ennui; when the latter hold
sway it is the feeling of having lost
something.
"What to do! What to do!"
"Any fellow," said a voice on the
Law Steps, "who knocks off the hat
of one girl and steps on another and
then says, 'Excuse me very much' isn't
fit to enter society—much less to
move in it."
So the ship sails on and on and on,
Blown like a maddened leaf;
But the engine is cool as a deep, deep
pool,
And —the Gods keep it off the reef.
