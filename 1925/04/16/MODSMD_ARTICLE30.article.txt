# CALIFORNIA UNABLE TO BOX STANFORD
## 
### 
The Bear boxing team will be un
able to meet Stanford in a match this
year, according to an anouncement
made today by Graduate Manager Cor
telyou of California.
The only dates which were available
for the matches were April 23 and 24,
and California was unable to box on
those nights, because of the nearness
of final examinations at Berkeley.

Recent research revealed that only
three out of ten freshmen at Ohio
State use tobacco.
