# CALIFORNIA HURDLER DECLARED INELIGIBLE
## 
### 
Arthur C. Alderette, California's star j
hurdler, was ruled ineligible by the execu
tive committee of the University of Cali
fornia last night. The reasons were
given by Dean Joel H. Hildebrand, as
follows:
"Arthur C. Alderette has been declared
ineligible for participation in the Stan
ford-California track meet this Saturday,
on account of having participated with an
outside organization during the spring se
mester, which is contrary to the Pacific
Coast Conference rules, in 1924, and also
because in transferring to the University
of California, he lost a year of participa
tion, which, with his two years of varsity
track participation at Washington and
Jefferson, used up the total of three years !
allowed to any varsity sport."
The ineligibility of Alderette is expected
to give Stanford two places in both of the
hurdle event's instead of the one place they
had been doped for. Alderette defeated
Bob Maxwell of Pomona last week.

Invitations to the annual gridiron
banquet at Michigan this year were in
the form of telegrams sent to each
guest. }
