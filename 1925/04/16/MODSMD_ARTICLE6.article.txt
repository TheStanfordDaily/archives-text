# JOHN C. DUNIWAY, STANFORD DEBATER, WINS JOFFRE MEDAL
## Justifies French Colonial Policy and Large Scale Military Training 
### 
John C. Duniway of Stanford was de
clared winner of the 1925 Joffre debate
with California in the close of the contest
held last evening in the Assembly hall.
Duniway spoke for the affirmative of the
question,' "Resolved, that the large scale
of military training and use of colored
coloniate in the French army is advanta
geous to civilization."
Taking the unpopular side of the ques
tion, the Stanford speaker briefly traced
the story of the ideals of the French peo
ple as voiced by their watchwords, "Lib
erty, equality, and fraternity," and em
phasized especially the attempt of France
to incorporate her possessions as an in
tegral part of her domains.
Duniway owed a large part of his suc
cess in the debate to his establishment of a
contact with the audience. His speech
was characterized .by a smoothness of de
h'very that conveyed an expression of sin
cerity and frankness.
The other Stanford speakers were
Robert E. Lewis and Victor H. Harding,
both of whom upheld the negative of the
question. The California speakers were
H. F. Cherniss and B. F. Witkin of the
negative, and R. G. Stanbury of the af
firmative.
Bernard E. Witkin and Harold F.
Cherniss of California also upheld the
negative of the question, while Raymond
Stanbury supported the affirmative.
Chester H. Rowell, associate editor of
"World's Work," was chairman of the
debate, which closes the year's forensic
activity. Colonel Allen G. Wright, Pro
fessor Robert T. Crane of Michigan, and
the Honorable Beverly L. Hodghead were
the judges. The question was chosen by
Professor Carlton Hayes of Columbia and
was announced two hours before the de
bate.
Duniway is a senior at Stanford, ma
joring in law. Last year he was a student
of Queen's College at Oxford and a mem
ber of the Oxford Union. He is a mem
ber of Los Arcos.
