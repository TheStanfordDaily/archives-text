IT'S THE CUT OF V OUR CLOTHES THAT COUNTS j
The College Four Piece Suit
This is a style that requires—and illustrates—the perfec
tion of the Society Brand cut. It is absolutely right for
the campus (with trousers) and out on the golf course
(with knickers).Thebroad,easy shoulders are looser than
they look. They're cut that way. We have a number of
patterns, specially selected, made up in this suit only.
$50
Others up to $75
