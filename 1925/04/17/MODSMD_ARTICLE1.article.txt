# STANFORD-CALIFORNIA TEAMS CLASH ON UNIVERSITY DAY
## ALUMNI RETURN FOR ANNUAL HOMECOMING REUNIONS TOMORROW Varied Program Including Sports, Barbecue, Show, Dance Planned For Returning Old Timers 
### 
SEVERAL thousand Stanford alumni and former students will return to the
campus tomorrow for their annual homecoming. This will be the fifth
time that Stanford celebrates University Day at this time of the year, the
first being in May, 1921.
Prior to 1921 University Day was held at the time of commencement. This
was unsuccessful because the undergraduates were not present on the campus.
The success resulting from this change was immediate. The first year
the number of alumni returning so far exceeded those expected that there was
not enough room at the regular reunion dinner at Roble hall, and it was

necessary to set a table for the over-'
flow in the Union.
This year ample provisions have
been made for the unusually large
number who are returning. Houses on
the row and the halls are co-operating
with the University in an effort to
house the guests for the week-end.
Entertainment Planned
Reunion banquets are scheduled for
this evening. These include English
Club, Cap and Gown, and Law Depart
ment dinners. At 8:30 p.m., Toyon hall
is holding a smoker for visiting alum

Hammer and Coffin Society will also
be held in San Francisco this evening.
The main events are scheduled for
tomorrow, University Day. In the
morning the alumni will have the op
portunity of attending varsity tennis
matches at 9:30 o'clock and polo at
10 o'clock. The annual business meeting
of the Alumni Association is set for
11 o'clock in Room 12 in the Law
