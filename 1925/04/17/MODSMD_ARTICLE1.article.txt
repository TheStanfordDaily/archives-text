# STANFORD-CALIFORNIA TEAMS CLASH ON UNIVERSITY DAY
## ALUMNI RETURN FOR ANNUAL HOMECOMING REUNIONS TOMORROW Varied Program Including Sports, Barbecue, Show, Dance Planned For Returning Old Timers 
### 
SEVERAL thousand Stanford alumni and former students will return to the
campus tomorrow for their annual homecoming. This will be the fifth
time that Stanford celebrates University Day at this time of the year, the
first being in May, 1921.
Prior to 1921 University Day was held at the time of commencement. This
was unsuccessful because the undergraduates were not present on the campus.
The success resulting from this change was immediate. The first year
the number of alumni returning so far exceeded those expected that there was
not enough room at the regular reunion dinner at Roble hall, and it was

necessary to set a table for the over-'
flow in the Union.
This year ample provisions have
been made for the unusually large
number who are returning. Houses on
the row and the halls are co-operating
with the University in an effort to
house the guests for the week-end.
Entertainment Planned
Reunion banquets are scheduled for
this evening. These include English
Club, Cap and Gown, and Law Depart
ment dinners. At 8:30 p.m., Toyon hall
is holding a smoker for visiting alum
ni. Celebration of the founding of
Hammer and Coffin Society will also
be held in San Francisco this evening.
The main events are scheduled for
tomorrow, University Day. In the
morning the alumni will have the op
portunity of attending varsity tennis
matches at 9:30 o'clock and polo at
10 o'clock. The annual business meeting
of the Alumni Association is set for
11 o'clock in Room 12 in the Law
building.
Luncheon will be served to the visi
tors at the fraternities, sororities, halls,
and eating clubs at noon. Classes of
'95 and '00 are holding special re-
infielders played soccer with Maillot's
roller.
Encina I Defeated
Delta Upsilon trounced Encina 1 by
the one-sided score of 9 to 2. The
D. U's played a good brand of ball and
led the freshman team without much
difficulty.
The Encina nine scored its only
markers in the second inning, getting
two runs on hits by Larson and Bigelow.
Delta Upsilon scored three runs in the
first, two' in the second, three in the
third, and one in the fourth.
Atwill pitched a good game for the
D. U's, letting the Encina batters down
with two hits. Quinn pitched for the
freshmen, but was unable to show much
class, being inclined to wildness.
Sequoia II Forfeits
Sequoia II forfeited its scheduler game
to Alpha Kappa Lambda, but a pick-up
team composed of Sequoia I and II
players engaged in a practice contest
with the A. K. L. nine. The row team
won by a 13 to 9 score. Cornell pitched
a good game for A. K. L.
Phi Kappa Psi forfeited its game to
the Alpha Delta Phi nine. This was the
fourth game to be forfeited this week.
The games scheduled for Monday are:

Encina I Defeated
Delta Upsilon trounced Encina 1 by
the one-sided score of 9 to 2. The
D. U's played a good brand of ball and
led the freshman team without much
difficulty.
The Encina nine scored its only
markers in the second inning, getting
two runs on hits by Larson and Bigelow.
Delta Upsilon scored three runs in the
first, two' in the second, three in the
third, and one in the fourth.
Atwill pitched a good game for the
D. U's, letting the Encina batters down
with two hits. Quinn pitched for the
freshmen, but was unable to show much
class, being inclined to wildness.
Sequoia II Forfeits
Sequoia II forfeited its scheduler game
to Alpha Kappa Lambda, but a pick-up
team composed of Sequoia I and II
players engaged in a practice contest
with the A. K. L. nine. The row team
won by a 13 to 9 score. Cornell pitched
a good game for A. K. L.
Phi Kappa Psi forfeited its game to
the Alpha Delta Phi nine. This was the
fourth game to be forfeited this week.
The games scheduled for Monday are:
Los Arcos vs. Phi Gamma Delta; Phi
Kappa Sigma vs. Delta Kappa Epsilon;
Encina Basement vs. Delta Chi; and
Theta Chi vs. Branner 11.
SEVERAL thousand Stanford alumni and former students will return to the
campus tomorrow for their annual homecoming. This will be the fifth
time that Stanford celebrates University Day at this time of the year, the
first being in May, 1921.
Prior to 1921 University Day was held at the time of commencement. This
was unsuccessful because the undergraduates were not present on the campus.
The success resulting from this change was immediate. The first year
the number of alumni returning so far exceeded those expected that there was
not enough room at the regular reunion dinner at Roble hall, and it was

necessary to set a table for the over-'
flow in the Union.
