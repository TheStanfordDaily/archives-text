# TEMPLETON'S STARS FINISH PREPARATORY TRAINING FOR MEET
## Cardinals, Bears Enter Tomorrow's Contest On Par; Both Squads Have Perfect Record 
### Douglas Meservey 
STANFORD'S track and field team has finished its preparatory training and
stands ready to meet the invading Bears from California tomorrow. The
contest will begin at 1:45 p.m., in the stadium.
Coach It. L. Templeton will enter the meet with an undefeated squad of
tracksters and one that is noted for its stars. Walter Christie, Bruin mentor,
is coming down from Berkeley with an undefeated team, but one that obtains
its strength from an even balance of first- and second-place men. It is upon

Pthese who will follow on the heels of
Templeton's stars that Christie pins
his hopes for a victory.
A review of the season's activity by
both squads reveals the following
facts:
Firsts are conceded Stanford in the
shot, discus, relay, 440, and 880—five
events out of fifteen.
First is conceded California in but
one pole vault.
As the battle of dope-guessing is
anybody's fight, we would submit the
following as the probable outcome of
the Big Meet:
Stanford 71; California 60
100 —Barber, Hartranft, Gaspar.
220 —Barber, Campbell, Gaspar.
440—Miller, Johnson, Storie.
880—Richardson, Boyden, Smith.
Mile —Smith, Kerr, Ross.
2-mile —Schwobeda, Jensen, Charles.
120 hurdles —Leistner, Becker, Wells.
220 hurdles—Leistner, Becker, Ragan.
Shot —Hartranft, Gerkin, Hoffman.
Discus—Hartranft, Francis, Hoffman.
Pole vault —Garner, Hill, Scofield.
Broad jump—Bondshu, Meeks; Mcßae
and Crookshank tie.
High jump—Work, Hampton; Muhs
and Kemnitzer tie.
Javelin—Dodson, Evers, Sliipkey.
Relay—Won by Stanford team of Bab
cock, Smith, Richardson, Miller.
Barber Steadier
Last year Barber was figured by
many to win the dashes but won only
one point for the Bears in the hun
dred—due probably to too much pub
licity and an inherent nervousness.
He is improved this season and has
shown good form in severe ocmpeti
tion, and unless Hartranft gets the
better start, he should win. Campbell
is put second in the 220 because he is
as capable of it as anyone entered.
Christie is bringing a circus of 53
men—although not a third of this
number can hope to place—which
means that those who place in the
quarter and half will have to "lead
off" fast. Miller is certain to win the
440 and Richardson the 880.
Storie is put in third place because
of the recent anonuncement that he
is fit and ready to run and may
