# "CARDINAL CAPERS" SHOWS TALENT AT DRESS REHEARSAL
## 
### Wallace Knox 
"Cardinal Capers," the track show
which will be given in the Assembly
hall at 8:30 tomorrow night, started off
with a bang at dress rehearsal last night,
kept getting hotter and hotter, until the
finale, when it was going like a whirl
wind. The audience tomorrow cannot
help but be taken with it.
One of the high lights is reached when
Irving Anschutz sings "Why Don't the
Pretty Girls Come to College?" An
schutz's interpretation of this song,
coupled with some clever steps, and the
presence of the freshman beauty chorus
is certain to draw a loud applause.
Velma Randall and Elizabeth Crebs,
as impersonators of men in a clever song
and dance act leave nothing to be asked
for. This pair will sing a series of popu
lar songs. Dorothy Dahler has arranged
a skit that is going to please the older
alumni. Making-up as an old lady, she
goes back to the period of 1895.
Byron Harvey, as a Russian dancer, is
just about as good as college specialty
dancers can be. Harvey is presenting
some dancing, along the type given in
the Ram's Head show, and which prom
ises to get by even better. Aileen Burks
and I'oresta Hodgson, a pair of unusual
dancers, will appear in a dancing num
ber verging on the classical. "My Queen
of Gasoline," with Gertrude and Gladys
McLeod and Gardner Lippincott went
smoothly last night at rehearsal and will
be one of the hits of the show.
Charles Simons, who introduces the
show and each act, has developed a line
of fast chatter that would startle even
A1 Jolson. The music which is of an
uncommon kind, is another of the attrac
tions of the "Cardinal Capers." Two
pianos, played by Huntley Castner and
Alice Dodds. give accompaniment to
every song.
