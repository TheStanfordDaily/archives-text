# University Day
## 
### 
Elaborate plans have been made to entertain former Stanford students
returning to the campus tomorrow. Social events, baseball, tennis, and
polo contests culminating in the big track spectacle are on the program.
But University Day will be remembered most fondly and for the longest
time insofar as the spirit of friendly welcome characterizes the celebrtaion.
In step with everything else, Stanford changes and grows as each suc
ceeding generation develops. Those who attended former University
Days can observe important physical differences from the Farm of yester
year. One thing has I>een handed down intact from class to class, Cardinal
spirit. On this common ground the old and new Stanford can always
reunite.
On University Day the scope of such an institution as this is most fully
realized. Something of the extent of Stanford is appreciated by under
graduates in meeting the returned alumni. The progressive march of
events here interests the former student. A renewed understanding of
the greatness of the Cardinal strengthens the enthusiasm of all.
The National Board, men from all parts of the United States, will
meet to plan for Stanford's future. The details of coordinating the Stan
ford groups all over the country to build the increased prestige of their
alma mater are difficult and important to arrange.
But far more vital to the well-being of the Cardinal scheme is the
friendly intercourse of student and alumni, refreshing the sympathies of
each.
University Day serves Stanford more than any other one event, ad
justing values and relations, and inspiring appreciation and friendship.
Of course the alumni are welcome. They always are. The very over
whelming number who are returning now, however, demands a heartier
greeting than ever before.
