## "ALUMNI HOP IN" 
### Steve O'Donnell 
The Alumni are looking for the guy
who put one of those windshield
stickers on Lugunitu.
• * *
He returned to Alma Mater,
One last fond look to take,
And he saw the luring sticker;
So he leaped into the lake.

Reports from the Peninsula Hospital
indicate that the man who worked
Wednesday will probably recover. That
is, everything but his standing on the
campus.

Think well of Gerald Boggins
(Class of *23)
'Twas he who worked on Labor Day.
A horse's neck was he.
