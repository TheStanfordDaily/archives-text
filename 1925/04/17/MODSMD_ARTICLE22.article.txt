Dear Billy:
Recently I went to a dance with a
friend of mine who is al6o a rough.
We sat in the windows and all during
the dance my friend kept shouting at
the dancers. Do you think this was
proper, Billy? —Anxious.
Dear Anxious:
It was proper, but a gross waste of
opportunity. You should have come
down from the window to the chairs
around the room, and then thrown
things at the dancers. —Billy.
Dear Billy:
I am traveling abroad next summer
on a cattle-boat, and I do not know
what to wear. Could you advise me?
—Worried.
Dear Worried:
I understand your situation, dear. I
have traveled on cattle-boats myself.
By all means wear a clothespin.
—Billy.
