The Slipper walked into his room,
threw his books at his roommate, Hal
Itosis, and sat down on the bed.
"Do you really love Sal?" said Hal,
while tearings the books into small
pieces.
"I know my socks sure need darn
ing," replied the Slipper, in a despair
ing tone.
That night he went to the Delta
Raw Deal house to call for Sal; they
were going to a dance. He asked for
Miss Hepatica, and the girl who came
to the door answered, "Of course, I'll
call Sal right away." This made the
Slipper mad, and so he said, "Hell!"
as she left.
At last Sal came and they went to
the dance.
Between dances he took her out
into the garden. He had determined
to pop the question. But as lie knelt
at her feet, it chanced that her slipper
slipped off, disclosing a large hole in
the heel of her stocking.
"God," he swore to himself. "The
Slipper almost slipped." Aloud he
said,
"I'm sorry, Sal, but I can never

marry you now."
"I don't give a damn," she answered.
So he hit her with an ax, and that
was settled.
Finis (needless to say).
