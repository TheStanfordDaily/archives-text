# CALIFORNIA SINGERS TO PRESENT NOVEL PROGRAM TONIGHT
## 
### Herbert Klein 
As a prelude to the activities of Uni-
I versity Day, the California Glee Club,
| with fourteen features on its program,
j will give a concert in the Assembly Hall
at 8:15 tonight, that is expected to be
j one of the most entertaining events seen
;on the campus in a long while. Origi
nality and variety have been the ends
that the club has successfully achieved in
getting together the best voices and the
most accomplished musicians of the Uni
versity of California.
The singers have everywhere received
praise from critics and press notices
from all parts of the world show that
their art has an appeal felt by audiences
in Europe and Asia as well as in this
country.
The club has made two tours of both
Europe and Asia and has acquired a
large amount of experience and finish
in rendering their numbers. Their trav
eling is by no means over for this sum
mer; they are to make a concert tour of
Alaska, returning by way of the Pacific
Northwest.
Harold Rosenblum's ten-piece jazz
band is coming with the singers to aid
them in making tonight's entertainment
a success in the line of instrumental as
well as vocal music. Rosenblum directs
the band from the keyboard and makes
his unique orchestrations of the latest
hits for it. His solo act consists of his
famous self-accompanicd popular songs
and ballads. His rich baritone voicc,
combined with syncopation, has made
him a favorite.
Other features of the program arc'
solos by Lawrence Lovctt and Chester
Gluck members of the band, clever danc
ing by Cris Quales and comic skits and
monologues by A1 Payne, Lawrence
Lovett, and George Dyer.
Though the club has made a large part
of its reputation on its singing of popu- i
lar and semi-popular music, its program
contains many musical classics which are
performed with a finish that only an or
ganization picked and trained as the-
California club has been can give them.
"Brick" Morse, the well-known sports
writer, is the director of the Glee Club.
Morse was a member of the organi
zation back in '92. In 1898 and '99 he
studied voice in New York and con
tinued his work in Paris in 1910. He
has composed string quartets and vocal
music and several of California's col
lege songs are his work, notably "Hail
to California," and "Sons of California."
The recital is California's part of an
exchange of Glee Clubs between the
Berkeley university and Stanford, whose
singers will return the visit at a date
to be set in the near future. Tickets for
the event are being sold in the Adminis
tration building. A few are still avail
able. â™¦
