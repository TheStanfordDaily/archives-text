# LAWS OF HEREDITY MAY BE UPSET BY RECENT DISCOVERY
## 
### 
Modern theories of heredity may be
refuted by experiments now being made
by Professor L. L. Burlingame on a
plant known as the Clarkia. On first in
vestigation this plant appeared to be
contrary to the accepted laws of hered
ity. However, experiments are being con
tinued to prove that it is merely an ex
plainable deviation.
The present theory is that in every
plant or animal there is a definite num
ber of units, known as chomosomes.
These units work in pairs. Man has
forty-eight of these pairs. These
chromosomes furnish the means for
transmission of hereditary character
istics.
The Clarkia appears to have a vary
ing number of pairs. The correct num
ber seems to be four, but there have
been counted from five to eight pairs in
the sex cells and from two to seven
in the body cells. This is in defiance of
all knowledge of heredity.
Professor Burlingame discovered this
wide variation while experimenting in
hybridization of tins plant in the garden.
Upon noticing the inconsistency of the
plant, he began a thorough study of its
properties, lie is attempting to prove
that it may be explained by the chro
mosomes having broken up into smaller
particles, but still remaining unchanged
in their original quantity. If this were
true, the smaller parts would be the
same size as the sum of the proper num
ber of full-sized chromosomes. Owing
to the irregularities in their shapes, how
ever, great difficulty is being found in
measuring them.
This is the only known case in which
the number of chromosomes vary,
though there may l:e others as yet undis
covered. Professor Burlingame is quite
confident that the explanation will be in
accordance with the laws as they are
now understood, and is spending a great
deal of time in attempting to confirm
his theory.

Oregon, members of an advertising

local stores for one week.
