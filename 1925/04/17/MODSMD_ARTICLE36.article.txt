# DR. JORDAN UPHOLDS COLLEGE LECTURES

### 
"A college lecture should not be con
sidered as a form of entertainment,
though it may often be so; its purpose
is either to impart new ideas or in
spiration," declared Dr. Jordan last
night in his lecture. "Too many lec
turers try to be merely amusing, and
they are encouraged in this course by
the following of those students who
want to be entertained, not taught or
inspired. The prime use of a univer
sity Is to teach students to think for
themselves; this end is partially de
feated by the gigantism of most mod
ern universities, where individualism
is stamped out and all the students
become of one pattern.
"A man may be very learned, but if
he is not a good lecturer he has no
place on a college faculty. There was
onoe a professor at Stanford who was
very well liked, but whose lectures
were particularly uninteresting. The
Quad that year had a little verse about
each professor in, the college; about
him it wound up with the couplet:
'But when it comes to lecturing,
Then chloroform's the proper thing.'
There may be other lecturers to
whom this might apply, but their most
striking fault of the present day is
their inclination to deal with their
subjects superficially. This is due in
great part to the large numbers in
the colleges who do not attend to
really learn anything, and who must
be amused."
