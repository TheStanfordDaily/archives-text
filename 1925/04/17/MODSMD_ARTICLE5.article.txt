# STUDENT BODY EXPRESSES CONFIDENCE AT SPRING RALLY ON LAGUNITA SHORE
## 
### M. D. Eaton 
! 4t come to bury California, not to praise her." This phrase, made over
from Mark Anthony to suit the occasion by Professor A. C. Whitaker
embodied the spirit of the spring sports rally held last night at Lagunita.
Before the bandstand, lighted by two powerful reflectors, a huge crowd
assembled on the shore of the lake, and as the outlines of the hills faded
away against the darkening sky, last rites were performed over California.
Just as the light vanished, so did California's hopes of victory.
Captain Hartranft of the track team was given an ovation when he arose
to speak. "The meet will be won by eight points without the relay, and
thirteen points with the relay," Hartranft predicted. He emphasized the fact
that California will not be easy to ride, but nevertheless we are going to
ride her.
Coach "Dink" Templeton seemed confident as to the result of the meet.
His speech was short and to the point. "I need not make any predictions of
the result of the meet," he said, "because I think the men on the team are
the finest group of competitive athletes I have ever seen."
Whitaker Talks
Professor Whitaker's talk was a masterpiece in humor. He demonstrated
a new use of classical literature by applying his knowledge of that subject
to his speech. He closed with, "I see a red ax splitting a golden bear in two.
I am an augur and that is my augury." Professor Whitaker was careful to
explain that an augur is not an article of hardware.
Captain C. H. Overfeldt of the tennis team pointed to the succession of
victories this season and asked the students for their support at the tourna
ment with California next Saturday morning.
The Back Alley Trio, composed of L. T. Browne, I). L. Daves, and G. R.
McDermont, sang from a boat on the lake. Their harmonies coming across
the water produced a charming effect. McCleave's Orchestra played several
selections.
The Stanford Band led the parade from the postoffice promptly at 7:15 and
marched down the shore of the lakcv to the bandstand.
The six tryoutees for assistant yell-leader put up some lively competition
for first honors. According to comments received by the Rally Committee on
the tryoutees, there is going to be a close race for the position. Their final
appearance before elections will be at the Big Meet.
The rally closed with the Hymn and the Varsity echoing across the lake.
