# SIGMA CHI NINE UPSETS DOPE BY DOWNING THETA XI
## 
### 
Sigma Chi scored a big dope upset yes
terday afternoon in the intramural base
ball league by defeating the strong Theta
Xi nine by a count of 6 to 4. The Theta
Xis made such good showings in their
previous games that they appeared to be
potential winners of their league, and
the Sigma Chis' unexpected victory came
as a complete surprise.
"Red" Maillot, former varsity base
ball player, and pitcher of the Theta Xi
team, wasÂ»not quite as bewildering to the
Sigma Chi batters as he was to the Alpha
Delts in the last game. Maillot let the
Alpha Delts down with three hits and
succeeded in fanning sixteen men. In
yesterday's game he was unable to con
trol the ball, allowing his opponents six
walks and seven hits. Adams pitchcd
a fair game for the victors, but was
helped out of some bad holes by excel
lent fielding on thd part of his team
mates.
Sigma Chi Takes Lead
Sigma Chi gained an early lead in the
firts inning when Maillot walked Tim
mons, Walker, and Clark, filling the
liases. King, the next batter, rose to the
occasion with a two-bagger, scoring two
runs. Theta Xi retaliated in the second
frame with a pair of tallies. Maillot
doubled, and then scored on Holbin's
hit. Casad connected for a three-bagger,
bringing Holbin in with the tieing run.
Sigma Chi chalked up another marker
in the third. Timmons singled and was
brought in when Walker smashed one of
Maillot's offerings for a two-base hit.
The winners enjoyed their big inning
in the fifth, making up three run and
bringing their total to six. Walker
rcachcd first on a single, advanced to
third on Clark's double, and scored on
Tremaine's hit. King walked, and then
both he and Trcmaine crossed the plate
when Aadm's grounder was booted
around the lot.
Theta Xi tried hard to even the count
but only succeeded in scoring two more
runs, one in the fourth, and the other
in the sixth. Scofield singled in the
fourth, took second on Maillot's sacri
fice, and scored when Holbin singled.
In the sixth frame, Lawrence singled,
and later scorcd when the Sigma Chi
unions at the President's home at 12
o'clock. The other classes of '05, '15,
'20, and '23, will hold their reunions
at the Union at the same time.
