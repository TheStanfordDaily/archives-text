Plans for the celebration of Junior
Week are going forward rapidly under
the direction of the committees taking
charge of the festivities.
The Junior Prom, supervised by P.
T. Meyers, on the night of May 8 will
be the chief event on the program.
Leslie Kiler and Chrysella Dunker are
arranging the decorations for the
pavilion, using a Japanese motif, and
promise something novel and beautiful
for the dance. Both Miss Dunker and
Kiler have done sets for many dra
matic productions on the campus.
With the filling of Lagunita this
year after a two-years' dry spell the
lake will again take a prominent posi
tion during the week. Each fraternity
and living group has been asked to
enter a float for the carnival to be
held Thursday night of Junior Week.
Prizes are being offered for the best
and most original floats. A series of
fireworks displays will be given, while
the band will furnish music through
out the evening. R. Hyland has charge
of the carnival.
The lake sports will be held the
afternoon before the Opera. Accord
ing to P. Shuinaker, besides swimming
and canoe races and a fancy diving
exhibition, several special events, in
cluding canoe fights and aquaplaning,
ha've been arranged.
The presentation of the Junior
Opera on Saturday night will close
the festivities of the week-end. Web
ster Street has put together a clever
plot and excellent dialogue in "Ace
High," while a good cast and pretty
chorus will add to the attraction.
At the present time programs are
being made which will contain the
full schedule of events. A limited num
ber will be printed, and these will be
sold for 75 cents each. The programs
will be in grey leather and will have
a cover scene depicting Lagunita.
