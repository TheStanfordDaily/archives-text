# CARD NINE EVENS SERIES WITH 4--3 WIN OVER BRUINS
## Johnston's Two-Bagger in Ninth Scores Winning Runs For Stanford Team 
### 
With scores again evened, the Stan
ford nine will meet the Bruin team
on the Cardinal diamond, Saturday, in
the deciding game of the 1925 series.
By defeating the Bears 4 to 3 last

and Nevers on bases, he knocked out
a two-bagger that scored them both.
Last year in the final game of the

After losing the first game of the

made twenty-seven runs off him last
week, to a mere three. Nevers did his
share of the hitting when in the sev
enth he clouted out the longest homer
ever seen in the Stanford ball park.
California was the first to score,

knocked a two-bagger and came in on
Dixon's single. In the fifth King sing
led and came in on Nounan's two

the sixth when Smith hit and scored
on Morse's blow.
The Cardinals went to bat for the
last time with California leading 3to 2.
It was then that Nevers walked and
went to third when Roberts bunted
and Nounan overthrew at first.
Johnston went to the plate and let
two fast ones pass for strikes and
slammed out the third, bringing in
