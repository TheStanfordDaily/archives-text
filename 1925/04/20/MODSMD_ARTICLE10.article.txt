The California Glee Club proved to be
entertainers of the first class as they
pleased their audience with a well-bal
anced program last Friday night. The
singing by the club was interspersed with
solos and novelty acts that kept the recital
at a high pitch of interest and the audience
in gales of laughter.
After a group of songs headed by "Hail
to California," Frank Dirkey played
Rachmanninoff's "Prelude in G Minor,"
exhibiting a very fine and powerful touch.
"My Haven," by Reginald DeKoven, the
composer of the popular light opera,
"Robin Hood," was rendered by the sing
ers. A number in this group which
pleased with its vivacity was "Desperado."
Some really clever work with crayons
was the feature of a novelty act put over
by Guy Street. Following this the clas
sical and majestic "Vesper Hymn" by
Beethoven, was sung by the glee club in a
way that showed their thorough training
under their director, "Brick" Morse, and
composer of many of California's college
songs. Harrison Colby delighted the au
dience by a whistling solo done in great
style. His selections were "Sally, Won't
You Come Back-" and "Memory Lane'.'
The proper way to sing California's
bear song "Our Sturdy Golden Bear" was
illustrated by the chorus. Frank Roberts
next displayed a very fine baritone voice
in two solos, "Bells of the Sea" and
When Irish Eyes Arc Smiling."
The hits of the evening as far as wit
and entertainment were concerned came at
the end. George Dyer's inimitable mono
logue, "Barnyard Chorus," was enthusi
astically received and made the audience
fairly rock with laughter.
