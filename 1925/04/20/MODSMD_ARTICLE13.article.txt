# Encina Hall Saved From Grave Danger
## 
### 
Amid cries of "Fireman, fireman, save
my child!" "Henry, get the canary!" and
screams of terror from rudely-awakened
sleepers, a band of shivering heroes
bravely defended Encina iu the dead of
night last Sunday when one of Henry
Ford's best jokes caught fire.
Scantily clad, the warriors swarmed
from everywhere and undaunted by raging
flames and icy air worked fiercely, assisted
by comrades above who, from myriads of
glasses and buckets, wetted the fire and
the enthusiasm of many of r the fighters.
A bucket brigade was formed and huge
quantities of water were thrown—from
one bucket—onto the turbulent tin mon
ster.
When finally the conflagration was got
ten into hand, a great ovation was given
the braves. At the close of the baptism
it was agreed by the onlookers that as a
volunteer fire department they were all
wet.
