## 
### 
Phi Sigma Kappa winners of League
IV last year, stepped alongside of Sigma
Nu in the lead of League 11, by defeating
Branner 5 to 4 in nine hard fought in
nings Friday. Chi Psi met El Campo in
a tilt which stood at 4-4 when time was
called at the end of the ninth inning. The
Union forfeited the other scheduled game
to Phi Delta Thcta.
The Phi Sig nine encountered unex
pected opposition from the Branner team,
led by Lefty May, but by slightly superior
pitching and fielding, emerged victorious.
May, the Branner moundsman, had good
control and fanned 10 men, and his heavy
hitting almost won the ball game. Haw
kins, the Phi Sig hurler, allowed but four
hits and whiffed 12 men.
Chi Psi, who shut out the Phi Psis last
week, had difficulty in holding the El
Campo sluggers down. Ditzler had good
control, and fanned eight men. He al
lowed but five scattered hits but his sup
port was poor. liritton, for El Campo
had a baffling slow ball, but he only
whiffed four men.
El Campo's big inning was the second
when they drove across three runs. Schoen
starred with the willow, getting three long
hits out of four trips to the plate.
