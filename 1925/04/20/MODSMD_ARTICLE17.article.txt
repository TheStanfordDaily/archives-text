a heavier vote cast than ever before.
Votes will be on sale tomorrow from
9 to 12 in front of the Romanic languages
building. The voting will continue
throughout the week. The cost of the
votes is one cent apiece, and it is possible
to cast as many votes for any candidate as
desired, the votes being sold in lots of
ten, a hundred, and a thousand. This
year, no one nominated will be allowed to
resign.
The 1925 Masque Ball will be different
from any other masque ball ever given on
the campus. There will be the usual varied
costumes and colors, the same carnival
spirit, and the same monarchial rule; hut
all suspicion of formality will vanish in
the setting of a children's playground
which will be the idea carried out in the
decorations. An effort will be made to
make this year's masque ball as informal
as possible. The King and Queen will
be the absolute rulers of a toy monarchy.
Tickets are now on sale at the Book
store. It was feared tliat the change in
the date of the dance might hinder the
sale but it is found that tickets are going
so rapidly that the limit of three hundred
will be sold long before the end of the
week. The cost of the tickets is $1.50
apiece. Rally committee reports that the
vaudeville acts alone will be worth the
price of admission.
Costumes will go on display this week
under the auspices of the Pacific Costum
ing Company. As there will be plenty of
costumes furnished, no one need stay
away because of the lack of proper attire.
The candidates are as follows:
King
W. H. Butler L. M. Enos
H. L. Noland J. D. Middleton
J. H. Sickler W. L. Hobro
S. Prentice J. H. Millage
D. P. Grunland C. C. Simons

Queen
