Fifty hours of labor were required
for the completion of the banner, the
string of letters spelling Stanford, the
four large S's, and the thirteen small
S's that were dropped by parachutes
from an aeroplane at the Track Meet
Saturday.
Due to a high wind which carried
the parachutes away from the sta
dium, the stunts were not as success
ful as had been anticipated. The un
usual entertainment was planned by
the Rally Committee with the aid of
the Varney Flying School. N. A. Rhine
suggested the idea of the stunts.
