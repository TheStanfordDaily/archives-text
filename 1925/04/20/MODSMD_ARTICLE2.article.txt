# JUNIOR OPERA CAST, CHORUS TO COMBINE IN FULL REHEARSAL
## 
### 
The cast and chorus of "Ace High,"
the 1926 opera, will work together on the
first act tonight, according to Delmer
Daves, the director. This will break all
records for Junior Operas, since it is
usually the custom to wait until the last
week before putting the cast and chorus
through the ; r paces in unison.
The chorus, under the direction of
Chrysella Dunker, will have had the
benefits of almost a month's preparation
by the time of the opera on May 7 and 9.
Both the cast and the chorus are striving
for a high peak of perfection in this
year's opera, and everyone is working at
top speed.
Les Kiler, in charge of stage settings
and design, has evolved a decoration
scheme for the Peruvian set in the second
act which will surpass his previous efforts
in stage design. The new drapes pur
chased by the Dramatic Council will en
able Kiler to secure the bizarre efforts
which feature the setting.
The music, under the direction of Fred
Tyroler, will include several pieces which
are destined to be campus hits after the
show. Over thirty compositions were
turned in to Tyroler in the competition
for song plots, and the result will be a
tuneful show.
Due to the fact that the Junior Opera
is almost always a "sell-out" production,
the Dramatic Council has arranged for a
performance on Thursday night, May 7.
This will be advertised as Faculty and
Palo Alto night, and most of the tickets
will be sold to those two groups. The
regular performance will be given on Sat
urday night, May 9.
