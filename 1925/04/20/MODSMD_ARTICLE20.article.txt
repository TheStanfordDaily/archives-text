# Athletes of Courage
## 
### 
Although the weather went back on the University last Saturday, the
track and baseball teams came to the rescue with sunshine enough to make
three alumni reunions successful. Stanford's athletes made new and fine
achievements well worth coming miles to witness.
Perhaps the most splendidly courageous things of the day were the
races of A1 Charles and Bill Storie and the performance of the baseball
team. The fine efforts of these men contributed a fresh value and deeper
meaning to the Cardinal.
The misfortune which has kept with Charles ever since he started run
ning the distances for Stanford handicapped him again. A short time
before the meet he was in the hospital quite sick. It was only a few
days before the Big Meet when Charles was able to leave his bed, and he
had to run before he had the opportunity to regain his strength.
On sheer nerve, Charles raced the two-mile event, sticking with the
leaders all of the way to the home stretch where he was unable to muster
strength enough to accomplish his famous sprint. That he was beaten
for third place by a California runner is unimportant beside the fact that
he spent his last ounce of energy fighting a handicapped fight for Stanford.
Two years ago Charles ran exactly this sort of race. Weakened from
an attack of influenza, Charles was unable to finish, collapsing on the track.
Shin splints kept him off the oval for two weeks before the Big Meet last
year and as a result he could not maintain training. He was again unable
to finish—behind a winner whose time he had beaten easily in early season
meets.
Through no fault of his own, Charles has never been able to win a
point in the Big Meet. He has tried now for the third time to overcome
the jinx by indomitable determination —without success. That is, he has
been without success as a point winner, but as a model of as fine a type
of athlete that Stanford ever had, he has set an example for generations.
Bill Storie ran for the first time this season in the Big Meet. On ac
count of serious trouble with his feet, he has been unable to train at all.
Yet with the same spirit that Charles raced, Storie fought himself into a
third place in the quarter mile.
Coach Templeton is to be complimented on training so successful a
track team. But he is to be congratulated on having men of fine courage
such as Storie and Charles.
Again, the baseball team distinguished itself in the same way. A week
before California won the first game from Stanford by a ridiculous score.
No team ever looked to be such a cinch to lose. But the discouragement
only lent fresh vigor to the game. Last Saturday, in as pretty a contest as
one could wish to see, the Cards turned the tables.
It is only fitting that such performances should be recognized and re
membered. These things ivill be remembered and often recalled. It re
mains for the Executive Committee to recognize them properly. When
the baseball team and the track team awards are granted, a varsity "S"
should certainly be given to A1 Charles, together with the others.

UNCLEANLINESS OUSTED Count Tagawa and his Stanford
Inn. For this reason, partly, the campus cigar store was made to dis
continue. It is the boast of the Administration that the reforms in the
eating and refreshment situtaion have been new models of sanitation and
cleanliness.
For the most part, the Administration is correct. The new dining
halls and the Union "Cellar" are above reproach. But it is hard to ex
plain just where the cigar and candy counter in the Union enters into so
tidy a scheme of things.
The place is downright dirty. Counters and tables are sticky and the
general appearance is a mess.
There is no excuse for it. The store has a monopoly. It certainly must
make money. Palo Alto stores, competing against each other, can keep
clean. There is no reason for the students having to stand for all this dirt
on the campus.
