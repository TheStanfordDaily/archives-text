# CABBAGES and THINGS
## THE 						SAGE 
### Steve O'Donnell 
He stroked his long and hoary beard,
He scratched his massive head,
He figured scientificallyâ€”
Then made a guess instead.
Next morn' he woke in great surprise,
And scanned the daily Call.
"Smart Boy! he called the turn again!"
He heard the newsies bawl.
