# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
As this is my first year on the Coast,
I've waited until after the final im
portant athletic contest before saying
anything about a matter in which I
have been interested from the begin
ning. This is the question of organized
cheering and singing.
As practically nothing is printed or
known in the East and Middlewest
about Coast universities and their con
tests, I came entirely ignorant of any
of the conditions here. This year I
have played in the Stanford band at
all the important football and basket
ball games and at the Big Meet yes
terday. The outstanding thing about
the rooting sections has been the
bleacher stunts. These have been a
huge success. But there are a few
things about the yelling and especially
the singing that could stand a lot of
improvement.
First the yelling itself. It seems to
me that it must be noticeable to any
one who has attended a big eastern
game that, while the rooting sections
of Stanford and California make a very
striking appearance, the noise they
make is very weak when compared
with that made at an Illinois-Chicago
game, for example. This, while prob
ably due in part to neglect on the part
of the rooters, also must of necessity
come from lack of display by the cheer
leaders. I don't mean to criticize the
Intentions of "Dutch" and his helpers,
but to object to the methods used by
all Pacific Coast yell leaders whom I
have seen. No doubt they try just aB
hard as do the Easterners, but the
very enthusiasm displayed by the lat
ter in their hand-springs and acrobatic
stunts serves to arouse a response in
the rooting section.
By simply listening to Cal sing, it is
evident that a band helps the singing
a lot. There is nothing so weak as a
chorus in which everyone is kinging
the melody (if there is a melody) with
no accompaniment. That Stanford
sings without her band is due to a
decision made by one of the cheer
leaders two years ago, I am told. This,
it seems, could best be remedied by
the selection this spring of a cheer
leader who understands music. He
would be able to co-operate with the
band and thus improve the singing
greatly. â€”Hughes Brewster.
