# "CARDINAL CAPERS" REMINDS OLD GRADS OF FORMER YEARS
## 
### 
Several hundred alumni and a
throng of student left the Assembly
hall Saturday evening after seeing
"Cardinal Capers" in a more or less
pleased state of mind—the alumni
more and the students less pleased.
A majority of the acts on the varied
program were well received although
a few fell somewhat flat. The waits
between numbers, with no entertain
ment, soured the audience for the acts
following a wait. However, consider
ing that the show was arranged, re
hearsed, and staged in two weeks, and
that the chorus was inexperienced the
production can be termed a distinct
success.
Gertrude and Gladys McLeod and
Gardner Lippincott left nothing to be
asked in their presentation of "Queen
of Gasoline." The McLeod sisters clog
danced their way into the hearts of
every member of the audience, and
aided by Lippincott this number re
ceived the most applause of the eve
ning.
Foresta Hodgson's dancing and
Aileen Burks' singing combined to
make "Celestina" one of the hits of
the evening. Miss Hodgson's interpre
tative dancing was perfect.
Irving Anschutz and the chorus in
''Why Don't the Pretty Girls Come to
College" was another pleasing num
ber. The chorus did its best work of
the evening in this song, and it was
helped along by Anschutz's voice.
Others who sang with the chorus were
Aileen Burks in "Cherry San;" Maria
Anderson and Charles Stratton in
"Orange Blossoms;" Elizabeth Clapp
and George Eardley in "Bungalow;"
Velma Randall in "Up on a Ladder;"
and William Pabst in the finale, "Foot
ball Song."
Chorus Is Good
The chorus behaved unusually well
for beginners, and mastered the vari
ety of steps in less than two weeks'
time. The credit for the work of the
chorus goes to Adelaide Kelly, who
worked out the steps and directed the
freshman girls. Good material for fu
ture Junior Opera choruses is found
in this group.
Delmer Daves and Sidney Lewis in
"Millie and Tillie" put "Pan-hell means
just what it says" across in great
style. This pair sang well, and enter
tained with some good humor. A1
Campbell made "A Maiden's Prayer"
sound real, while Byron Harvey as
"Clever Clancy" executed some hard
steps in a professional fashion.
Velma Randall and Elizabeth Crebs,
impersonating men, appeared in a skit
called "A Night of the Garter" and
drew their share of applause from the
audience by their rendition of several
popular numbers. Dorothy Dahler,
dressed in a costume of the vintage of
1895, reminded the alumni of old times
by her dress and manner in singing a
song designed for that purpose.
Other specialty numbers were "Saxo
sobbing" in which Baron Dawes, Phil
lip Brooks, and Earl May did their
stuff as a saxophone trio; Mah Jongg,
one of the 1924 Opera hits, with Mar
jorie Allen, Gladys McLeod, and Alice
Dodds; and a Riot in Russian, with
Jack Wiggin and Greg Williamson,
were well received. Bolton White dis
played unusual talent with the violin
in a solo.
"Perpetual Emotion" was the name
of an interlude concocted by Norris
James. Dave Mannoccir as the prop
erty man and William Pabst as a
plain clothes man drew a goodly num
ber of laughs from the audience. Man
noccir was a good clown as an over
grown Swede and Pabst seemed to
know how to burlesque heavy melo

drama. Others in the cast were Phil
Urner, as Frank; Grove Day, as Sid;
Dorothy Dahler, as Eve; and Charles
Parks, as the director.
Charles Simons made a jovial, good
natured master of ceremonies, who
entered through the front door and
glad-handed alumni all the way down
the aisle until he had the audience in
good humor.
The show was directed by Charles
Parks and Dave Mannoccir, who did
commendable work in organizing and
presenting the show in such a short
time. Music was by Alice Dodds and
Huntley Castner, who played a two
piano accompaniment for every num
ber.

Two hundred free bibles nave been
given to Columbia Universit students
in the last two das and four hundred
more are to be distributed. The bibles
are the gift of the New York Bible

and William Pabst in the finale, "Foot
ball Song."
Chorus Is Good
The chorus behaved unusually well
for beginners, and mastered the vari
ety of steps in less than two weeks'
time. The credit for the work of the
chorus goes to Adelaide Kelly, who
worked out the steps and directed the
freshman girls. Good material for fu
ture Junior Opera choruses is found
in this group.
Delmer Daves and Sidney Lewis in
"Millie and Tillie" put "Pan-hell means
just what it says" across in great
style. This pair sang well, and enter
tained with some good humor. A1
Campbell made "A Maiden's Prayer"
sound real, while Byron Harvey as
"Clever Clancy" executed some hard
steps in a professional fashion.
Velma Randall and Elizabeth Crebs,
impersonating men, appeared in a skit
called "A Night of the Garter" and
drew their share of applause from the
audience by their rendition of several
popular numbers. Dorothy Dahler,
dressed in a costume of the vintage of
1895, reminded the alumni of old times
by her dress and manner in singing a
song designed for that purpose.
Other specialty numbers were "Saxo
sobbing" in which Baron Dawes, Phil
lip Brooks, and Earl May did their
stuff as a saxophone trio; Mah Jongg,
one of the 1924 Opera hits, with Mar
jorie Allen, Gladys McLeod, and Alice
Dodds; and a Riot in Russian, with
Jack Wiggin and Greg Williamson,
were well received. Bolton White dis
played unusual talent with the violin
in a solo.
"Perpetual Emotion" was the name
of an interlude concocted by Norris
James. Dave Mannoccir as the prop
erty man and William Pabst as a
plain clothes man drew a goodly num
ber of laughs from the audience. Man
noccir was a good clown as an over
grown Swede and Pabst seemed to
know how to burlesque heavy melo

drama. Others in the cast were Phil
Urner, as Frank; Grove Day, as Sid;
Dorothy Dahler, as Eve; and Charles
Parks, as the director.
Charles Simons made a jovial, good
natured master of ceremonies, who
entered through the front door and
glad-handed alumni all the way down
the aisle until he had the audience in
good humor.
The show was directed by Charles
Parks and Dave Mannoccir, who did
commendable work in organizing and
presenting the show in such a short
time. Music was by Alice Dodds and
Huntley Castner, who played a two
piano accompaniment for every num
ber.

Two hundred free bibles nave been

Several hundred alumni and a
throng of student left the Assembly
hall Saturday evening after seeing
"Cardinal Capers" in a more or less
pleased state of mind—the alumni
more and the students less pleased.
A majority of the acts on the varied
program were well received although
a few fell somewhat flat. The waits
between numbers, with no entertain
ment, soured the audience for the acts
following a wait. However, consider
ing that the show was arranged, re
hearsed, and staged in two weeks, and
that the chorus was inexperienced the
production can be termed a distinct
success.
Gertrude and Gladys McLeod and
Gardner Lippincott left nothing to be
asked in their presentation of "Queen
of Gasoline." The McLeod sisters clog
danced their way into the hearts of
every member of the audience, and
aided by Lippincott this number re
ceived the most applause of the eve
ning.
Foresta Hodgson's dancing and
Aileen Burks' singing combined to
make "Celestina" one of the hits of
the evening. Miss Hodgson's interpre
tative dancing was perfect.
Irving Anschutz and the chorus in
''Why Don't the Pretty Girls Come to
College" was another pleasing num
ber. The chorus did its best work of
the evening in this song, and it was
helped along by Anschutz's voice.
Others who sang with the chorus were
Aileen Burks in "Cherry San;" Maria
Anderson and Charles Stratton in
"Orange Blossoms;" Elizabeth Clapp
and George Eardley in "Bungalow;"
Velma Randall in "Up on a Ladder;"
and William Pabst in the finale, "Foot

of an interlude concocted by Norris
James. Dave Mannoccir as the prop
erty man and William Pabst as a
plain clothes man drew a goodly num
ber of laughs from the audience. Man
noccir was a good clown as an over
grown Swede and Pabst seemed to
know how to burlesque heavy melo

drama. Others in the cast were Phil
Urner, as Frank; Grove Day, as Sid;
Dorothy Dahler, as Eve; and Charles
Parks, as the director.
Charles Simons made a jovial, good
natured master of ceremonies, who
entered through the front door and
glad-handed alumni all the way down
the aisle until he had the audience in
good humor.
The show was directed by Charles
Parks and Dave Mannoccir, who did
commendable work in organizing and
presenting the show in such a short
time. Music was by Alice Dodds and
Huntley Castner, who played a two
piano accompaniment for every num
ber.

more are to be distributed. The bibles
are the gift of the New York Bible
Society.
