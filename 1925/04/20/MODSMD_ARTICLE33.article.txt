## 
### 
Plans for the organization of a Ham
mer and Coffin alumni organization at a
banquet in San Francisco Friday night
and the holding of a convention of chap
ter representatives at Stanford yesterday
marked the Hammer and Coffin week-end
by which the society celebrated the nine
• tee-nth anniversary of its founding.
The banquet, with Chris Bradley, '00,
as toastmaster, was one of the most suc
cessful in the annals of the society. More
than 50 "Old Boys," representing classes
from '99 to '26, attended the affair, ar
ranged through the efforts of Henry R.
Harvey and Sam Briggs. Bradley, the
toastmaster, was associated with Bristow
.Adams, 00, in founding the Chaparral.
A bronze and silver honor roll plaque,
large enough to hold 50 names, was pre
sented to the society by D. M. Reynolds*
'05. On this plaque will be placed the
name of the man, not editor or business
manager of Chaparral, who. each year has
been of greatest service to the magazine.
In presenting the plaque Reynolds urged
an extension of Chaparral's activities for
Stanford, and promised the support of the
•alumni in this work.
The new coffin, built to contain Chap
. pie's famous silver hammer, was brought
out for the first time. Hammer and Cof
. fin lias possessed a hammer since the so
. cicty was formed; never before has it had
a corpse-box. The coffin was presented by
' the active chapter.
Committees for the formation of a
functioning alumni body were named by
Bradley, with one for the selection of
• names for the plaque.
, Representatives attending the conven
tion yesterday included Robert Jenkins,
* former editor of the Chicago Poetiix, and
•Frank Carroll, formerly of the Washing
ton Sundodger, now Columns. Petitions
•from magazines of the midwest and south
for Hammer and Coffin charters were
considered, while Jenkins reported the
early this month of a chapter
Jat Northwestern University, the Purple
Parrot chapter. A discussion of Hammer
l-and Coffin policy, particularly as regard
ing the relations of chapters with other
college comic organizations and with na
tional concerns, occupied the meeting.
