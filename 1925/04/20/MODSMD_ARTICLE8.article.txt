# WIN IN RELAY GIVES CARDS TRACK VICTORY IN ANNUAL BIG MEET
## Richardson, Miller Outrun California Men In Last Two Laps; Hartranft Defeated in Both Shot, Discus 
### Douglas Meservey 
Stanford 66'/ 2 ; California 64/ 2 —
was the score which tells nothing of the thrills that 25,000 spectators
witnessed last Saturday in the greatest dual meet ever held on the Pacific
: Coast. And the climax was the greatest event of the day—the relay which
I decided the victors. California led Stanford, 64y 2 to 61% as Babcoek and
| Barber began the first lap. Barber had already distinguished himself by
giving the Bears ten points in the dashes and threatened to give them five !
I more when he finished three yards ahead of his Card rival. Aggeler of
California ended the second lap ahead of Doerr, the Card quarter-miler, giving
Boyden a three-yard lead on Richardson. Thirty minutes before, Boyden had
upset all predictions by defeating Richardson in the 880. It was now

>Richardson's chance for revenge, and
he took advantage of it, sprinting
down the backstretcli of the third lap
two yards ahead of the Bruin.
The last lap was but a repetition
of the 440 a few minutes previous
when Miller led Johnson to the tape
by five yards—the Card quarter-miler I
taking the baton from Richardson and
finishing with a beautiful sprint to
win the relay and meet for Stanford.
Four Stanford-California records
were shattered and a king dethroned j
in the sixty minutes that led up to the
relay and climax.
Miller, Leistner Star
Miller paced the field in the quarter
mile to win in :49 1-5, breaking his
own mark of 49 5:10. Leistner of Stan
ford ran his best races of the season
by winning the low hurdles in :24 and!
the highs in :14 9-10 —the latter break
ing Lane Falk's time of :15 1-10'.
Stevens, an unheralded sophomore
who had not scored a point for Cali
fornia this season, won the two-mile
in 9:43 1-10 —a-new record. Charles of
Stanford evoked the sympathy of both j
Stanford and California supporters
when he attempted to run the eight j
laps after a week of grippe. He fin
ished fourth, and had to be carried ,
from the field on a stretcher.
Hartranft Beaten
Captain Hartranft of Stanford, in his
strenuous endeavor to beat Barber
in the hundred, suffered from over
exertion and was beaten in both shot
and discus. He fouled four out of six
throws in the shot and five out of six
in the discus —being beaten by Gerkin
and Carey rspectively—an unusual pro-.
cedure for him. His mark in the shot j
was 2-8 of an inch behind Gerkin's 48
feet 1-8 inch, although an unofficial
measurement after the meet made him
the winner by 3-8 of an inch.
The thrills of the contest consisted |
of upsets on both sides. Men who were
expected to be heroes failed, while
others came from more or less obscure
positions to garner points.
Gaspar of Stanford fulfilled the pre
dictions of a very few that he would
"come through" and took second in j
