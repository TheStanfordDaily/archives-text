# SETS FOR "ACE HIGH" SHOW PROMISE OF ORIGINALITY
## 
### 
I
An adaptation of the three-ring cir
cus act of Barnum and Bailey will be
one of the novel sets for the Junior
Opera, "Ace High," which will be pre
sented May 9.
In the second act of the opera, the
playwright and .designer have ar
ranged the settings so that the in
terior of a Peruvian hostelry will be
staged in double-decked system with
main floor and balcony visible. In this
way the audience will be treated to
the unique thrill of seeing two floors
of the hotel at the same time, with
rapid-fire action going on at both
levels. â€¢
Leslie Kiler, designer, has started
work upon the set which will soon
be completed. The interior of a pala
tial residence in Hollywood (incident
ally the home of a proXessor) is seen
in the first act with the veranda in j
the background. Something new will
be seen in the full-sized Grecian col
umns.
The ultimate in realism will be fur
nished by having an airplane motor j
located at a convenient point for the
duplication of the airplane action
which figures so prominently in the
plot. The hero is a devotee of aviation
and his arrivals and departures are
in downward and upward directions
respectively.
