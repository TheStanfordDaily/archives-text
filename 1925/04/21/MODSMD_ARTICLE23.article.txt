# WERRENRATH, NOTED BARITONE, TO GIVE CONCERT THURSDAY
## 
### H. A. Klein 
The concert of Reinald Werrenrath,
noted bariyjnp, next Thursday night
in the Assembly hall, will bring to a
close the annual serieÂ£* of the Penin
sula Music Association.
Werrenrath occupies a pre-eminent
position among American baritones,
combining a pleasing voice with a
noteworthy personality and artistic
taste. His intelligence and imagina
tion make his singing sympathetic.
Werrenrath is descended from a
family with a line of talented musi
cians extending back many genera
tions. His debut before the public was
made a comparatively few years ago
but he has become one of the recog
nized figures on the concert stage.
During the eight months' musical sea
son of 1922-23 he made 100' appear
ances and he traveled over sixty thou
sand miles.
Last night Werrenrath sang in the
Scottish Rite hall of San Francisco.
Tonight he will be in the Oakland
Auditorium Theatre, and Wednesday
at the Dominican College of San
Rafael.
Among the numbers included on the
program are songs by Mozart, Brahms,
and Grieg. The Prologue to "I Pagli
acci" by Leoncavallo, a popular oper
atic selection, is also one of the num
bers. Three of the poems of John
Masefield, set to music, two by East
hope Martin, and one by Deems Tay
lor, the well-known New York musical
critic, constitute one section of the
program.
A Kipling ballad, "Danny Deever,"
set to music by Walter Damrosch, the
American composer and conductor,
will be one of the songs of the recital
here.
Werrenrath's accompanist, Herbert
Carrick, will play two Chopin piano
solos, "Waltz in C sharp minor" and
"Polonaise in A flat."
