# Awards, Again
## 
### 
After several weeks of deliberation, the committee preparing the pro
posed new rules for the reduction of "S" awards has its recommendations
practically completed. The plan is being presented to representative or
ganizations this week and is scheduled to come before the Executive Com
mittee next week.
What this means is that the students had better commence considering
the reform seriously, for the plan is a lead-pipe cinch to be approved as a
constitutional amendment at the spring election.
Those who participated in the Daily Palo Alto straw voting on the
popularity of various sports know the kind of work which is cut out for
them. Men will organize to place their sports as advantageously as pos
sible. Any upset is to be expected.
It is the intention of the scheme to make football, track, basketball, and
baseball the four major sports. If this proposition is made without giving
the students the opportunity to select the most popular sports themselves,
the tennis players will be forced to organize to defeat the entire proposal.
Tennis, swimming, boxing, and soccer are suggested as the minor
sports. Yet, in the Daily ballot, polo supplanted boxing by two places.
Polo, being a military departmental activity, is not considered seriously as
a sport representing the entire University. However, if the army can
induce enough future officers to stand up for their own advantage, the
cause may easily be lost.
A great many political difficulties will arise on the Quad which are not
to be encountered in the Executive Committee. Besides the rivalry be
tween sports, there will be the general impression that in classifying the
sports in this manner—on basis of attendance —the backers of the reform
lay themselves open to a of professionalizing athletics, interest or
no interest.
Athletics are supposed to encourage bodily development and a healthy
sporting spirit. Many will properly contend that sports should be dif
ferentiated on some basis such as this and not on the attendance figure, or
gate receipts. The ideal is to encourage interest in sports, not to encourage
a certain sport because it is interesting.
Should this be satisfactorily explained there is the further question of
the advisability of grouping the second-class minor sports in the gymna
sium department, taking away their status as intercollegiate competition,
and refusing the participants any the "S" as an award.
As the proponents of reduction maintain, the difference is in the minds
of the students. As the present system stands, all sports are considered to
l>e within the responsibilities of the Board of Athletic Control. Although
the award grants would still be made through the Executive Committee,
and although the monies of the board might be budgeted to the support of
the various sports in the gymnasium department, under the new scheme,
there is a distinction in the minds of the students which is formed just as
soon as these sports are barred from "S" awards. It makes them appear
to be representing something besides Stanford—perhaps an economy pro
gram.
As the Daily has announced before, we believe that "S" awards should
be given to everybody. Let the awards be distinguished by further in
signia, if necessary. If a football letter is considered by some to be the
only award worth while, then let letters given to players in this sport be
designated by a smaller "F," track by a smaller "1," and so forth. It is
this system which is followed in other universities, notably at Yale, to dis
tinguish certain gradations. Harvard uses it. Princeton has a similar
system of distinction.
With this in effect, there would be no danger of slighting anything and
each award would have the distinction it deserves. I here could be no
complaints for the differences in appearance would insure the difference
of respect, each person rating the sport at the true value he, himself, at
taches to it. There could be no objections made by athletes that so many
others wear the same award that there is 110 use in his doing so —an argu
ment which is being used to promote the proposed reduction plan.
It is the student-body which must finally approve this plan. It is the
Daily's intention to present both sides. The recommendation of the com
mittee will be ready in a short time. Substantially, it has already been
presented here informally.
This question of the future of Stanford athletics is important and de
serves careful discussion. It may or may not be a dangerous step, for it is
only a step.
