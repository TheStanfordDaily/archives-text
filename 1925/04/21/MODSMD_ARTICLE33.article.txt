# THE 						AISLE SEAT
## 
### 
Artists and Models is a novelty revue
verging on the risque, but in all an un
usually well staged and worth-Kvhile
show.
The dancing by a talented group of |
artists is far above the average; the J
chorus has mastered its steps to perfec
tion, and satisfactorily supplements the
work of the specialty dancers. Veronica
appears in several toe dancing skits, and
appears to be charmingly enjoying her
self while she executes some difficult
dances—seemingly without effort. Those
who like acrobatic dancing will find Con
stance Evans a pleasure to watch, for
she adds some unusual steps to the usual
rigamarole of high kicking.
The sets and costumes were beauti
fully designed and surpass those of any
revue which we have seen in a long
time. They are enough to make any nor
mal young person sit on the edge of the
seat and hold his breath. The costumes
were delightfully simple.
Jack Pearl and Ben Bard form a com
edy team far out of the ordinary. Pearl,
with a decided German accent, keeps the
audience in good humor watching him
struggle to express his ideas in English,
and to understand the two-syllable words
his partner uses. He is especially good
in a scene in a Paris cafe which culmi
nates in an Apache dance and his learn
ing how to love as a Frenchman does.
Tableaux throughout the show are in
teresting and frequently striking in their
reality. Probably the best is one in
which the models appear on the covers
of popular magazines. Another ex
quisite tableau is a group depicting sev
eral Papanese prints. Arthur Hadley
does some excellent rapid-fire crtaoons
after the fashion of popular newspaper
artists.
George Rosener, impersonating Sadie
Thompson, an adventuress who charms
the "men on Pago Pago, an island in the
South Pacific, does a splendid burlesque
on Somerset Maugham's famous success,
'Rain." Mr. Davidson, a visiting mis
sionary, attempts to reform Sadie, but
succumbs.
