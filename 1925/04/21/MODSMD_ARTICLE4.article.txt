# SWIMMING RIVALS WILL RENEW FIGHT FOR A. A. U. CONTEST
## 
### 
This year's A. A. U. swimming cham
pionships to be held in San Francieco
April 23-26 will not only serve to
bring together old stars and renew
old duels, but also it will give some
younger swimmers their chances for
national glory.
From present indications Arne Borg
and Johnny Weissmuller, two of the
greatest swimmers of the day, will not
clash in these races unless the Illinois
Athletic Club sorely needs points.
Coach Bill Bachrach would then send
Weissmuller into the 220 where he
would meet Borg.
Bachrach's flash is concentrating his
training on the 50 and 100 yard events
ir anticipation of the keen competi
tion which he will meet next Thurs
day. Towering among his rivals is
Duke Kahanamoku who will, if any
one can, beat Weissmuller. Fans, how
ever, are conceding Weissmuller the
edge in these events.
Other stars racing in the short dis
tances will be the Duke's brother, Sam
Kahanamoku, Reg Harrison of the
Venice Athletic Club, Bryer of North
western University, and Smith of the
San Francisco Olympic Club. '
In the 220 Borg is a heavy favorite
for first honors, his main rival being
Wallace O'Connor, a former Stanford
star. Borg figures that he will swim
this event in approximately 2:17,
Wyatt of Pennsylvania, a close con
tender in the last Olympics, is favored
over Mila, I. A. C. man, in the 150-
yard backstroke. Both are in good
form for the event and it would be
one of the Closest races of the meet.
Ray Kegeris of Iledondo, a former
national title-holder, may swim the
