# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT
## 
### 
I The Editor, Sir:
A word of mention is necessary for
I the excellent manner in which the
j University police handled the crowd
jat the track meet Saturday. I have
j visited many other universities and
' attended many games, but I have
| never received such courtesy, help,
and friendliness as I did from the
men who helped me park my car Sat
urday.
It is frequently true that people who
are suddenly endowed with authority
tend to become obnoxious by their
superior airs.
The contact that I had with Stanford
men Saturday gave me the impression
that Stanford students are well quali
fied to handle authority with those
qualities which bespeak diplomacy and
true executive ability. As I said before,
they are well worthy of praise.

Dear Mr. McDowell:
Will you please thank the Student
Body, on behalf of the University Day
Committee, for their hearty and cor
dial co-operation last Saturday'.'
In particular please thank the band,
the Glee Club, the cast of the show,
and the committee members who gave
of their time and their talents so
freely. The success of University Day
depends upon the students, not upon
the alumni, and this year marks the
peak of undegraduate co-operation.
Sincerely,
DANIEL W. EVANS, '20. ,
—
Editor, Daily Palo Alto.
I desire to add my personal note to
the appreciation expressed by Mr. i
Evans.
The volunteer offering of individual
students and organizations was so
generous that the usual worries and
burdens of University Day were not
even in evidence.
Sincerely,
J. E. McDOWELL,
Alumni Secretary.
