The Editor, Sir:
Yesterday I read an article in the
Daily criticizing the lunch counter in
the Union for its uncleanllness. We
would all like to have it clean, hut if
a reform is planned, why not start it I
where it is most needed? In the En
cina dining halls, dirt is not confined j
to the floor and tables, but is divided
equally upon all the tableware. It is
often difficult to distinguish the food
from the dirt.
This is not a complaint against the
food. We can accustom ourselves to
that, and even derive a certain amount
of pleasure and nourishment from it. \
One of my most enjoyable occupations ,
is that of covering a quantity of puffed
wheat with milk, and watching the,
little weevils come gasping and chok- j
ing to the surface. The sport is really ,
fascinating. N
No, it is not the food. We can toler
ate the Friday noon salad, made up of j
odds and ends accumulated during the !
week, and even the occasional, tainted '
meat. But to have to drink from
glasses not even semi-transparent, and
to eat fiom spoons to which remnants
of former days are still clinging—that
is the limit. It is not only the limit, j
but it is an art. Only the most hardy I
specimens can do it.
If this filth could be eliminated, and |
I see no reason why it can't, I think
that it would make things much more
pleasant for those who have to eat in
the halls. As it is, the dishwashing
system is a total loss.
