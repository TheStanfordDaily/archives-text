# MUSICIAN WHO PLAYED BEFORE ROYALTY WILL PERFORM AT MASQUE
## COSTUMES ON DISPLAY Decorations to Have Kiddie Motif; Pavilion Becomes Child's Playground 
### 
F. A. Elizalde, whose orchestra has
been secured for the Masque Ball, has
played before the crowned heads of
England, and will play before the king
and queen of Stanford, Saturday eve
ning.
His eight-piece orchestra has been
playing in San Francisco for some
time, and he was recently engaged to
give weekly concerts over radio KPO.
He is noted for his piano specialties,
and for several popular pieces he has
written.
Costumes for the ball will go on dis
play tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock
in the freshman dressing room of the
pavilion. The Coast Costume Company,
which is handling them, promises good
costumes at reasonable rates.
A marble-shooting contest to decide
the championship of the University
will be held, as well as a kiddie-kar
race which anyone will be allowed to
enter.
The idea of a children's playground
will be carried out in the decorations,
which consist of various pieces of
playground apparatus placed along the
edge of the floor to offer diversion for
the dancers.
Two swings will be hung from the
ceiling, to be let down between
dances. The ceiling is to be a huge
black and white cobweb.
The Rally Committee wants to carry
out the spirit of the children's play
ground, and make everyone forget mid
quarters and return to his carefree
childhood.
Tickets are on sale at the Bookstore
at $1.50 apiece, and costumes may be
obtained at the pavilion tomorrow and
Friday.
