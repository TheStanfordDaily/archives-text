# PENINSULA CONCERT SINGER MADE FIRST APPEARANCE IN 1919
## Noted Baritone Has Long Record of Successes In Varied Roles 
### 
! The debut of Reinald Werrenrath,
| whose concert here tomorrow night is
the last feature of the Peninsula Music
1 Association concert series was made
|on February 1, 1919, in the role of
| Sylvio in "I Pagliacci." His success
| was complete, and the high place he
lias since held among American bari
j tones was firmly established. For his
I recital in the Assembly hall on Thurs
day Werrenrath has selected as one of
his main numbers, a part from the
; same opera that first brought him
fame. This will be the "Prologue" to
j "Pagliacci."
Werrenrath is an American by birth
and comes from a family of accom
plished musicians. Part of his voice
j training was received from his father.
; His home is in New York, but during
j the concert season his many engage
| ments take him all over the country.
With Werrenrath, as his accompan
ist, comes Mr. Herbert Carrick who
will play a solo group of two Chopin
j compositions, "Waltz in C sharp
i minor" and "Polonaise in A flat."
The program selected from the bari
tone's repertoire contains both classi
! cal and modern music in a balanced
i
J arrangement. Ballads of modern Eng
lish poets set to music are well repre
i sented for three of John Masefield's
i works and one of Kipling's are to be
rendered. Songs of American com
posers represented include Deems Tay
lor and Walter Damrosch, both noted
j in American musical circles, one as
| a critic the other as a conductor.
Old airs that will be interpreted by
Werrenrath are "Alma" by Mozart and
