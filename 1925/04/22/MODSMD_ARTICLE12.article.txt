# PENINSULA CONCERT SINGER MADE FIRST APPEARANCE IN 1919
## Noted Baritone Has Long Record of Successes In Varied Roles 
### 
! The debut of Reinald Werrenrath,
| whose concert here tomorrow night is
the last feature of the Peninsula Music
1 Association concert series was made
|on February 1, 1919, in the role of
| Sylvio in "I Pagliacci." His success
| was complete, and the high place he
lias since held among American bari
j tones was firmly established. For his
I recital in the Assembly hall on Thurs
day Werrenrath has selected as one of
his main numbers, a part from the
; same opera that first brought him
fame. This will be the "Prologue" to
j "Pagliacci."
Werrenrath is an American by birth
and comes from a family of accom
plished musicians. Part of his voice
j training was received from his father.
; His home is in New York, but during
j the concert season his many engage
| ments take him all over the country.
With Werrenrath, as his accompan
ist, comes Mr. Herbert Carrick who
will play a solo group of two Chopin
j compositions, "Waltz in C sharp
i minor" and "Polonaise in A flat."
The program selected from the bari
tone's repertoire contains both classi
! cal and modern music in a balanced
i
J arrangement. Ballads of modern Eng
lish poets set to music are well repre
i sented for three of John Masefield's
i works and one of Kipling's are to be
rendered. Songs of American com
posers represented include Deems Tay
lor and Walter Damrosch, both noted
j in American musical circles, one as
| a critic the other as a conductor.
Old airs that will be interpreted by
Werrenrath are "Alma" by Mozart and
"Would God I Were the Tender Apple
Blossom," an old Irish folk song.
Commenting on one of the singer's
Carnegie Hall concerts the New York
Tribune wrote, "Fine art, intelligence,
and good taste have always made his
programs occasions to look forward to
with relish and to be remembered with
gratitude." From the Mail, "As often
as we have heard Werrenrath sing,
we still think he is supreme."
Werrenrath is also known as a
writer of humor after the style of Ring
Lardner. After a concert which he gave
recently at. Louisville, Kentucky, he
wrote a review of his own efforts. Part
of it went as follows:
"You see I never would of gone to
hear this bird Werrenberg or what
ever his name is, he's a wop or some
thin, if lou liadent got stuck on a
record she bird last summer
she was to her folks in Guthrie only
God knows where they got the coin
to buy such tripe they always sponge
on me every time they get the chanct.
"Well, I coffs up four good iron men
plus a war tax although we goes to
the concert as it is called, Lou looking
like $1.00.000, and me all dressed up
like a plush . Well this guy comes
out at last tall and skinny like he
was proud or something followed by a
little red headed what there was of it
feller and the crowd begins to clap
and stomp before he opens his face.
After the crowd stops there noise Red
begins to tease the ivories and the big
bum starts in Was he good well yes
and no. The Ist song wasn't so rotten
it was bout a boy who wanted his
dame to get up and rush the growler
for him. He says he'll take cream and
if theres no cream he'll take beer.
He's foolish just like a fox only a
swell chanct he's got to get beer these
days after what them prohibition guys
did to us. Well to make a long story
short he sings or thinks he sings the
big stufft shirt and Red plays and the
crowd claps their hands and I says to
Lou I gotta smoke and she says it's
all right with me and stay as long as
you want Wasent it beartifull Lou
says and I says it may of bin but it
was over my head what does that,
burd get for his trouble. More than
you make in a month you poor click
Lou says. Pretty soft says I if I gotto
were tricks close and no vest and
come in my bare hack with a fork
like that poor wop I'll stick to the old
taxi."
