# NEW ARRANGEMENT BEING REHEARSED BY "ACE HIGH" CHORUSES
## 
### 
The new system adopted for the
1 choruses of "Ace High," the Junior
Opera now in rehearsal, according to
I Delmer Daves, director of the produc
tion, is proving so successful that it
will doubtless be used in all future
] productions of the- musical comedy
variety given on the campus. Instead
of having the usual two choruses of
, eight, the number has been extended
! to twelve in each chorus so that the
\ amount of work for the individual
! members is greatly lessened. New
j combinations of chorus men and girls
will be used for practically every nutn
j ber instead of having the same group
I in every song or dance as before and
each player appears in only two-thirds
! of the songs and dances given.
i The training of the choruses is in
j charge of Chrysella Dunker and re
hearsals are going on every night. In
a short time the cast and choruses
will be combined for rehearsals. This
is believed to be a record for speed
jin organization of a Junior Opera.
! Several weeks' experience will enable
the principals and "ladies and gentle
j men of the ensemble" to work to
| gether for greatest effectiveness rather
than separate training of the two parts
j and a hurried combination a few days
j before the final presentation.
