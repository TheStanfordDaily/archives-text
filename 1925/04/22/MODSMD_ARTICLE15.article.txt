# SHAKESPEARE LECTURE BY ELLSWORTH SHOWS CONDITIONS OF TIMES
## LANTERN SLIDES SHOWN Historical Background Given In Illustrated Talk Last Night on Campus 
### Hulda Hoover 
"Shakespeare left Stratford as an un
known youth; in a few years he had be
come a leading spirit in the new litera
ture" said William Webster Ellsworth in
his lecture last night in the Assembly
Hall. Ellsworth's lecture on "Sliakes
peare and Old London," took the form of
an imaginary personally conducted tour
through the London of the poet's time and
a visit to his famous theatres, illustrated
by lantern slides of pictures, plans, and
documents.
Ellsworth introduced his talk with a
quotation from William Archer, the well
known English critic, "If some enchanter
should offer to recover for me a single
hour of the irrevocable past, I think I
should choose to be placed among the au
dience at the Globe '1 heater, in or about
the year 1600, with liberty to run round
between the act's and interview the author
actor-manager, Master Sliakespeare, in
his retiring-room. For this I would give—
one can afford to be lavish in bidding for
the inconceivable—say a year of my life."
Ellsworth endeavored to do this for the
audience. He made the great dramatist
live. He portrayed Shakespeare's early
life at Stratford as a school boy, and a
young man, ventured some suggestions as
to what happened in the seven lost years
of his life, and pictured the poet's arrival
in London as he found it.
"Shakespeare made grave errors in
geography and in historical details, per
liaps the picture of Cleopatra playing bil
liards is the worst inconsistency in his
works, but he had a marvelous understand
ing of humanity. The appeal of the great
playwright's works is universal. His
plays and poetry have been interpreted
into every language. A recent production
of one of his plays in Yiddish in Jeru
salem drew a big audience," said Ells
worth.
"Shakespeare was not much of an actor.
A contemporary critic said of him that he
was 'a better poet than player' and cer
tainly any man who could supply his com
pany with plays such as Sliakespeare did
would have wasted his time in acting."
"Shakespeare was the only prominent
poet of the time who wrote no song in
Elizabeth's praise at her death, perhaps
the way that she had treated some of his
friends had something to do with it.
The streets and building, and the inter
esting nomenclature of places that the lec
turer brought out, set forth the surround
ings and conditions of the Elizabethan
stage. The maps showed where the poet
lived and the haunts that he was familiar
with, and the pictures and paintings gave
a historical background and the social life
of the day.

actor-manager, Master Sliakespeare, in
his retiring-room. For this I would give—
one can afford to be lavish in bidding for
the inconceivable—say a year of my life."
Ellsworth endeavored to do this for the
audience. He made the great dramatist
live. He portrayed Shakespeare's early
life at Stratford as a school boy, and a
young man, ventured some suggestions as
to what happened in the seven lost years
of his life, and pictured the poet's arrival
in London as he found it.
"Shakespeare made grave errors in
geography and in historical details, per
liaps the picture of Cleopatra playing bil
liards is the worst inconsistency in his
works, but he had a marvelous understand
ing of humanity. The appeal of the great
playwright's works is universal. His
plays and poetry have been interpreted
into every language. A recent production
of one of his plays in Yiddish in Jeru
salem drew a big audience," said Ells
worth.
"Shakespeare was not much of an actor.
A contemporary critic said of him that he
was 'a better poet than player' and cer
tainly any man who could supply his com
pany with plays such as Sliakespeare did
would have wasted his time in acting."
"Shakespeare was the only prominent
poet of the time who wrote no song in
Elizabeth's praise at her death, perhaps
the way that she had treated some of his
friends had something to do with it.
The streets and building, and the inter
esting nomenclature of places that the lec
turer brought out, set forth the surround
ings and conditions of the Elizabethan
stage. The maps showed where the poet
lived and the haunts that he was familiar
with, and the pictures and paintings gave
a historical background and the social life
of the day.
"Shakespeare left Stratford as an un
known youth; in a few years he had be
come a leading spirit in the new litera
ture" said William Webster Ellsworth in
his lecture last night in the Assembly
Hall. Ellsworth's lecture on "Sliakes
peare and Old London," took the form of
an imaginary personally conducted tour
through the London of the poet's time and
a visit to his famous theatres, illustrated
by lantern slides of pictures, plans, and
documents.
Ellsworth introduced his talk with a
quotation from William Archer, the well
known English critic, "If some enchanter
should offer to recover for me a single
hour of the irrevocable past, I think I
should choose to be placed among the au
dience at the Globe '1 heater, in or about
the year 1600, with liberty to run round

actor-manager, Master Sliakespeare, in
