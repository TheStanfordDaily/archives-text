Wednesday, November 17, 1920, the student-body voted to tax itself
$1 a quarter for the purpose of paying interest on the investment of
$75,000 which was to be put into the present basketball pavilion. To
finance the plan, $7,500 was promised yearly by the Board of Athletic
Control, $5,000 was promised from the University by Comptroller Roth,
and $2,500 was offered by President Wilbur from the President's budget.
It was presented to the students at an assembly that they tax them
selves $1 a quarter to pay the six per cent interest on the investment and
part of the principal. By a vote of 1.089 to 70 the proposition of the Board
of Athletic Control was accepted, and ever since the tax has been collected.
A bit of research in the files of the Daily Palo Alto brings to light a
statement which is bound to gladden the hearts of all. In the issue of
Monday, November 15, 1920, there appeared an article by Floyd Mc-
Elroy, president of the A. S. S. U. at that time, which made this assurance:
It will take the student body about four years and one-half to
pay their full share toward this building.
According to the accepted standards of counting, the last installment of
the students' contribution was collected at the beginning of the present
quarter. Next October should find the students paying the old rate. The
students have done their part.
Whoopee!
