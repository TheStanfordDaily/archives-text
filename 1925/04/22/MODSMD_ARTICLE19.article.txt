Not so long ago the Men's Council added fifteen hours to "a certain
student's" graduation requirement. The student was complained of for
conduct while intoxicated which was unbecoming to a Stanford gentleman.
It is very likely that he was guilty. In all probability, had the culprit
Ijeen arrested by the regular authorities, he would have spent the night in
jail and he would have been fined $25.
Instead, his case is dealt with by his fellow students who forced him
to the necessity of doing another quarter's work in the University. Pre
suming that the student in trouble lived in Los Angeles, which of course
is not true, an extra $50 in railroad transportation has to be spent on ac
count of the fine. Further, $96 additional tuition is paid the University
for the instruction. Syllabus fees bring the initial cost up to $150.
On top of this, the student is forced into three months more of idleness.
If he had been suspended, he could have been earning enough to support
himself. At least $200 a quarter is ordinarily spent by those who receive
this punishment. Conduct unbecoming a Stanford gentleman is expensive.
When the penalty is translated from hours into money, it is evident
that the unfortunate local drunks are often fined $350.
No matter what one's attitude toward intoxicants, no just person can
fail to recognize the difference between $350 and $25, which is the differ
ence between the University fine and the tax imposed by a regular court
of law.
It is excessive.
STAFF MEETING tomorrow at 1:15.
