"New Lives for Old" —Stanford —
George Jean Nathan has catalogued j
the sure-fire hits for the legitimate
stage. After viewing this production
we feel eminently qualified to start a
comprehensive list for the movies, but
we feel that it would repeat too many
of the age-old gags.
There is the method of having the
heroine unjustly suspected—that al
ways wins the greatest sympathy. The
showing of the words of a patriotic
song is sure to bring down the house.
And so on and oil.
We must confess that we were sur
prised to see another picture of the
great war, but we did. The plot is an
old stand-by. Beautiful woman loves
a soldier —spies to save her country—
is suspected of being an enemy by her
friends, but cannot break her oath of
secrecy—marries the upright hero —is
discovered —but is finally and triumph-1
antly cleared of all suspicion.
But the play is really not so bad as |
all that, for we found ourselves fre-1
quently enjoying bits of it in the I
course of the evening. A great deal 1
of this is due to Betty Compson, who
is quite charming in this picture. She
seems to be one of the few even half
way capable women now working in
♦he movies. There cannot possibly be
more than a score or so.
This Theodore Kosloff is good as the
villain. We rather like his style of I

being bold and bad. But for the, life of
us we cannot remember who the hero
was. He Is good and strong and all that
sort of thing. «—D. T. R.
