### 
Professor A. F. Rogers of the Geo- J
logy department has had published in 1
a recent number of the Bulletin of
the Geological Society of America an |
article on fossil bone. This is the first J
study ever made of the mineralogy of
fossil bone, and represents between
three and four years of research.
Bones for this study were collected j
from many parts of the United States |
and from foreign countries, some 300 !
specimens being used. It was found !
that the chief constituent of fossil
bones is collophane, an amorphous ;
mineral which makes up the bulk of j
phosphate rock, important as a ferti
lizer.
The refractive indices of 250 bones
and three chemical analysis were
determined by Professor Rogers, made i
during the course of the research. i
The Big Ten alumni committee on j
Western Football Schedules, in its an
nual report, states: "There is a vicious ,
tendency in modern football toward :
commercialism."
