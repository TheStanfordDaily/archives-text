HISTORY OF THE McCUBBINS
Hepsabob McCubbin
"In my early youth I was a famous
beauty, known all over the civilized
world and in parts of Berkeley. Early
in life I resided with my parents in
Beaver Dam, Wisconsin.
"When I was sixteen, father moved
to Kalamazoo because he had been

invited to visit there by the mayor—
of Beaver Dam.
"Father always believed in traveling
light, so when he moved from Beaver
Dam he carried nothing from our old
home except a rail off the fence. When
I think about it now, I cannot quite
remember whether father really car
ried that rail or whether it was the
other way around. However, I shall
alwayß think of Beaver Dam as a hos
pitable spot. How clear is my memory
of our kind neighbors helping father
the day we left for Kalamazoo.

Soap Box Stuff
Scene: The Quadrangle.
Time: Just preceding the election of
the King of the Masqued Ball.
(The anxious crowd is gathered in
tense postures around the soap box.
Suddenly there are cries of "Make
Way! Make Way! Here He Comes!
Here He Comes!)
(Enter Mr. Cabbages, borne on the
shoulders of sturdy engineers. He is
set upon the soap box.)
Cabs —Ladies, Gentlemen! I have a
message.
What I have to say concerns not
only myself, but the entire university.
In fact, it is in the interests of "dear
old Staffo'd," as we called it Saturday
night.
There is one among us who has the
qualities, or at least one quality, of a
great man. I refer to his nose, which
is the exact duplicate of the proboscis
of Cyrano de Bergerac. Furthermore,
ladies and gentlemen, my candidate
(Ah! now you know that this is politi
cal) as I was saying, my candidate
follows the advice of our friend Edgar
Allen Poe and follows that nose wher
ever he (or rather it) goes.
Purely by accident his nasal adorn
ment led him into this campaign. Now
that he is here, lie is here to stay,
come what may.
Ladies and Gentlemen, my candidate
is amply fitted to hold this office, King
of Frivolity, for he has never, at least
not in his better moments, done a
serious thing. As I have pointed out. he
has all the native characteristics of a
sovereign, and to cap the climax he
has parted his name in the middle.
It is with a noticeable swelling of
this magnificent head of mine that I
urge you to vote for J. Hatchet-Sickle!
