# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT

### 
The Editor, Sir:
Your short comment in Monday
night's paper, relative to the condi-!
tions of the Union lunch counter, was
right to the point, and I hope that in j
the future you will have some more
comments upon some of the other
results of the present monopolistic
tendencies hereabouts.
I partook of Count Tagawa's fare for
a year and made frequent visits to
the old cigar store, and yet I failed
to see as much evidence of uncleanli
ness as I do at present in one visit to
the Union store. It wasn't untidiness
that really deprived us of a place to
eat and buy lunches at a reasonable
price, but it sounded well as an excuse
for eliminating competition.
When private eating houses and
cigar stands can charge lower prices,
keep cleaner, give better service and
food than a large institution with a
much better buying power, something
is all wrong. At the Union lunch stand
prices are high enough to warrant
better service, at least to women cus
tomers, and a lot more cleanliness for
all. The service in the Cellar is about
as near a negative quantity as it can
be and still exist, but when the check
finally comes, it reminds one of Tait's
or the Golden Pheasant.
—Anti-Monopolist.
