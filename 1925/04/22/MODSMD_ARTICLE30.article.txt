# Postal Service Seizes Harvard Lampoon Copies
## 
### 
All copies in the mails of the Harvard
Lampoon, comic publication of Harvard
University, were seized in Boston last
night by the postal authorities on the
grounds that the issue contained indecent
and obscene literature. Other copies of
the magazine are being held by United
States District Attorney Harold P. Wil
liams and a recommendation has been
made that the responsible persons be
prosecuted for circulating indecent and
obscene literature through the mails.
