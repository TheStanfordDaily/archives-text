### 
At a recent dinner of Stanford high
school principals of California held in
Santa Barbara, a committee was appointed
to investigate means of securing an en
dowment fund of $250,000 for the Ap
pointment Office here at Stanford. This
committee has arranged to meet this sum
mer with President Wilbur, Comptroller
Roth, and Mr. Sellards, the endowment
secretary, to definitely map out a cam
paign to obtain the money for the fund.
M. J. Gossett, principal of Benicia
High School, is cliairman of the commit
tee which is composed of the following
high school principals: Homer Martin,
Santa Barbara; W. S. Glascock, San
Jose; W. L. Ewing, Pasadena; E. L. Van
Dellen, Salinas.
Mrs. Snell was made permanent secre
tary and treasurer of the Stanford prin
cipals organization in recognition of her
work as appointment secretary. This po
sition has heretofore been an annually ap
pointed one.
The Appointment Office is working to
capacity now, and is greatly handicapped
in necessary expansion by lack of funds.
The university allows a certain amount
for the office, but this is far from suffi
cient.
A school for cheer leaders has been
organized at the University of lowa,
under the direction of the Department
of Speech and Physical Training.
At the University of Oregon fresh
men are forbidden to appear in either
tuxedo or full dresa during their first
