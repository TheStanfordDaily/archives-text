# PECK, ENOS LEADING FOR MASQUE HONORS
## 
### 
Katheryn Peck announced at a
late hour today that she has with
drawn from the race for queen of
the Masque Ball. She stated that
she would not be on the campus
this week-end.

Katheryn Peck and L. M. Enos were
leading for King and Queen of the
Masque Ball when the polls closed at
noon today. Enos had established a
lead of 300 votes over his nearest op
ponent and Miss Peck had the large
majority of GOOi votes in her favor.
Both candidates had very considerably
increased their lead since yesterday.
It is believed that a strong political
organization in Sequoia hall is holding
Enos in the lead.
Elyse Braunschweiger and J. D. Mid
dleton are running a close race for
second. It is probable that no one has
yet established a sufficient lead to be
elected. The most spirited voting is
anticipated for tomorrow and Friday.
The candidates will be cut to four
each on tomorrow's ballot and the two
leading contestants for king and queen
will be entered in the finals Friday.
Polls will be opened at nine o'clock to
morrow morning and will be kept open
until three if voting is heavy enough.
.Votes cost one cent apiece.
