# REPAIRS ON ORGAN POSTPONE RECITALS
## 
### 
Organ recitals in the Memorial
Church will be resumed upon comple
tion of the improvements and exten
sion now being made to the instru
ment. Enlargements of the chambers
containing the pipes will make possi
ble room for all future additions. The
Skinner Organ Company, in charge of
the remodeling, is also installing an
entirely new manual with four banks
of keys, built on the same plan as that
supplied by them to the Legion of
Honor organ in San Francisco. The old
manual will be retained and later on
may be used to control the echo and
antiphonal divisions of the organ when
they are sufficiently enlarged. If this
is done the old manual will be in
stalled in the chancel and played by
a separate musician, making possible
many striking musical effects.
New actions are being supplied and
a new set of pipes installed. The organ
will be brought to perfect mechanical
condition and the way prepared for
all changes contemplated for many
years ahead. A definite program has
been mapped out for future additions
so that as quickly as funds become
available they can be put to use.
The new manual has stops for a
large number of sets of pipes that will
remain unused until the sets can be
installed. Effects approximating those
of orchestra music will then be possi
ble for the organ.
The recitals, held on Tuesday,
Thursday, and Sunday afternoons by
the University organist, Warren D.
Allen, will be resumed in the near fu
ture, and it is expected that the
changes made in the organ will add
greatly to its effectiveness as an in
strument.
