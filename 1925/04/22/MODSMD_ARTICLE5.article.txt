# D. U. NINE DEFEATS A. K. L. IN FREAK BASEBALL CONTEST
## Delta Tau Delta Team Wins From Kappa Alpha 4-0; Frosh Lose Twice 
### 
{ Delta Upsilon trounced Alpha Kappa
| Lambda yesterday afternoon in one
| of the most peculiar ball games played
j in the intramural league so far this
| season. The D. U.s won, 10 to 1,
! scoring all of their runs in the first
| inning. Other results yesterday were:
Delta Tau Delta 4, Kappa Alpha 0;
Sigma Alpha Epsilon 10, Encina IV 1;
| El Capitan 5, Encina I 2.
[ The D. U.s staged a regular merry
| go-round in the first inning, scoring
! ten runs and virtually cinching the
contest. Nearly every man on the D. TJ.
team counted for a tally. A. K. L.
scored its only run in the last inning,
Lewis crossing the plate with the
count that saved his team from a
shut-out.
Dick Hyland lived up to the prece
dent established by other intramural
; pitchers by striking out fifteen batters.
[ Cornell pitched good ball for the A.
K. L.s, with the exception of the dis
astrous first inning. He was not given
! good support, however, and this fact,
1 coupled with the six hits he allowed
in the initial frame, presented the win
ners with their ten runs.
Encina 1 lost to El Capitan in a
j loosely-played game, 5 to 2. The game
was more one-sided than the score
| indicates for El Capitan held the ad
vantage throughout. Max Marsh was
; the outstanding player in the game,
fanning twelve men in addition to con
necting for two hits, a home run, and
j a single.
El Capitan had its big inning in the
j third, accounting for three runs, the
last being Marsh's home run. The
| other two runs were made in the sixth
frame.
Both of Encina's runs were the re
| suit of clever base stealing. In the
i second inning, Dunn singled, stole sec
ond and third, and scored on an error,
j Ballard singled in the fifth, stole sec
j ond and third, and then surprised
! everyone by pilfering home. This is
j the only time this feat has been ac
complished this season.
Noack pitched an unsteady brand of
ball for the Encina nine and was
touched for a number of base hits. The
fielding of A1 Cass was the most
noticeable performance on the fresh
i man team. Whitney also played a good
! game and was responsible for several
j stellar plays.
Delta Tau Delta encountered little
difficulty in shutting out the Kappa
Alpha nine, 4 to 0. The winners were
never pressed and had things their
own way throughout the entire con
test.
The Delta Taus started the scoring
in the second frame. Alexander dou
bled and then scored on Tognazzini's
triple. Tognazzini connected for his
second hit in the fifth, reaching sec
ond, and finally scoring on Draper's
sacrifice hit. Two more tallies were
brought in in the last inning. O'Neal
smashed out a two-bagger, and scored
when Tognazzini drove, out a home
run.
Garthwaite pitched excellent ball for
the Kappa Alpha team. He was touched
for several costly hits, but succeeded
in fanning fourteen of his opponents.
Collett also twirled in a creditable
manner, being especially tight with
base hits. He disposed of eleven bat
ters by the strike-out route.
Tognazzini carried off batting hon
ors for the day. He made a perfect
record, three hits out of three times
up, one of his safeties being a home
run.
Sigma Alpha Epsilon humbled En
cina IV in a ragged game, 10 to 1. En
cina offered very little opposition and
allowed the S. A. E.s to score almost
at will.
The winners cinched the ball game
in the first inning when they marked
up four runs. From that time on the
fraternity nine scored runs in nearly
every inning.
"Red" Moore, the Encina pitcher,
was given terrible support by his team
mates. He pitched good ball in all the
seven innings, allowing his opponents
only six hits. Most of the S. A. E.'s
runs, with the exception of those
scored in the first inning, were the re
sult of errors by the freshmen.
Art Stevenson was robbed of a no

hit game by the last batter to oppose
him in the seventh canto. He pitched
air-tight ball during the entire con
test, and would have been given credit
for a complete shut-out if the last En
cina batter hadn't connected for a hit.
Stevenson struck out sixteen batters,
giving one of the best performances
seen on the mound this season.
Games scheduled for tomorrow aft
ernoon are: Alpha Delta Phi vs. Sigma
Chi, Theta Xi vs. Chi Psi, Phi Kappa
Psi vs. El Campo, and Phi Delta Theta
vs. Theta Delta Chi.

never pressed and had things their
own way throughout the entire con
test.
The Delta Taus started the scoring
in the second frame. Alexander dou
bled and then scored on Tognazzini's
triple. Tognazzini connected for his
second hit in the fifth, reaching sec
ond, and finally scoring on Draper's
sacrifice hit. Two more tallies were
brought in in the last inning. O'Neal
smashed out a two-bagger, and scored
when Tognazzini drove, out a home
run.
Garthwaite pitched excellent ball for
the Kappa Alpha team. He was touched
for several costly hits, but succeeded
in fanning fourteen of his opponents.
Collett also twirled in a creditable
manner, being especially tight with
base hits. He disposed of eleven bat
ters by the strike-out route.
Tognazzini carried off batting hon
ors for the day. He made a perfect
record, three hits out of three times
up, one of his safeties being a home
run.
Sigma Alpha Epsilon humbled En
cina IV in a ragged game, 10 to 1. En
cina offered very little opposition and
allowed the S. A. E.s to score almost
at will.
The winners cinched the ball game
in the first inning when they marked
up four runs. From that time on the
fraternity nine scored runs in nearly
every inning.
"Red" Moore, the Encina pitcher,
was given terrible support by his team
mates. He pitched good ball in all the
seven innings, allowing his opponents
only six hits. Most of the S. A. E.'s
runs, with the exception of those
scored in the first inning, were the re
sult of errors by the freshmen.
Art Stevenson was robbed of a no

hit game by the last batter to oppose
him in the seventh canto. He pitched
air-tight ball during the entire con
test, and would have been given credit
for a complete shut-out if the last En
cina batter hadn't connected for a hit.
Stevenson struck out sixteen batters,
giving one of the best performances
seen on the mound this season.
Games scheduled for tomorrow aft

| El Capitan 5, Encina I 2.
[ The D. U.s staged a regular merry
| go-round in the first inning, scoring
! ten runs and virtually cinching the
contest. Nearly every man on the D. TJ.
team counted for a tally. A. K. L.
scored its only run in the last inning,
Lewis crossing the plate with the
count that saved his team from a
shut-out.
Dick Hyland lived up to the prece
dent established by other intramural
; pitchers by striking out fifteen batters.
[ Cornell pitched good ball for the A.
K. L.s, with the exception of the dis
astrous first inning. He was not given
! good support, however, and this fact,
1 coupled with the six hits he allowed
in the initial frame, presented the win
ners with their ten runs.
Encina 1 lost to El Capitan in a
j loosely-played game, 5 to 2. The game
was more one-sided than the score
| indicates for El Capitan held the ad
vantage throughout. Max Marsh was
; the outstanding player in the game,
fanning twelve men in addition to con
necting for two hits, a home run, and
j a single.
El Capitan had its big inning in the
j third, accounting for three runs, the
last being Marsh's home run. The
| other two runs were made in the sixth
frame.
Both of Encina's runs were the re
| suit of clever base stealing. In the
i second inning, Dunn singled, stole sec
ond and third, and scored on an error,
j Ballard singled in the fifth, stole sec
j ond and third, and then surprised
! everyone by pilfering home. This is
j the only time this feat has been ac
complished this season.
Noack pitched an unsteady brand of
ball for the Encina nine and was
touched for a number of base hits. The
fielding of A1 Cass was the most
noticeable performance on the fresh
i man team. Whitney also played a good
! game and was responsible for several
j stellar plays.
Delta Tau Delta encountered little
difficulty in shutting out the Kappa
Alpha nine, 4 to 0. The winners were
never pressed and had things their
own way throughout the entire con
test.
The Delta Taus started the scoring
in the second frame. Alexander dou
bled and then scored on Tognazzini's
triple. Tognazzini connected for his
second hit in the fifth, reaching sec
ond, and finally scoring on Draper's
sacrifice hit. Two more tallies were
brought in in the last inning. O'Neal
smashed out a two-bagger, and scored
when Tognazzini drove, out a home
run.
Garthwaite pitched excellent ball for
the Kappa Alpha team. He was touched
for several costly hits, but succeeded
in fanning fourteen of his opponents.
Collett also twirled in a creditable
manner, being especially tight with
base hits. He disposed of eleven bat
ters by the strike-out route.
Tognazzini carried off batting hon
ors for the day. He made a perfect
record, three hits out of three times
up, one of his safeties being a home
run.
Sigma Alpha Epsilon humbled En
cina IV in a ragged game, 10 to 1. En
cina offered very little opposition and
allowed the S. A. E.s to score almost
at will.
The winners cinched the ball game
in the first inning when they marked
up four runs. From that time on the
fraternity nine scored runs in nearly
every inning.
"Red" Moore, the Encina pitcher,
was given terrible support by his team
mates. He pitched good ball in all the
seven innings, allowing his opponents
only six hits. Most of the S. A. E.'s
runs, with the exception of those
scored in the first inning, were the re
sult of errors by the freshmen.
Art Stevenson was robbed of a no

hit game by the last batter to oppose
him in the seventh canto. He pitched
air-tight ball during the entire con
test, and would have been given credit
for a complete shut-out if the last En
cina batter hadn't connected for a hit.
Stevenson struck out sixteen batters,
giving one of the best performances
seen on the mound this season.
Games scheduled for tomorrow aft
ernoon are: Alpha Delta Phi vs. Sigma
Chi, Theta Xi vs. Chi Psi, Phi Kappa
Psi vs. El Campo, and Phi Delta Theta
vs. Theta Delta Chi.
