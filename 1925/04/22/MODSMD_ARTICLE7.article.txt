The national A. A. U. events start
ing at Fleischacker pool tomorrow
noon will mark the culmination of
eight months of training for the Stan
ford water polo and swimming teams.
Though pitted against the pick of the
nation the Cardinals are doped to
make a creditable showing in the
swimming and diving competition, and

by some are given the edge in the
water polo championship.
Events tomorrow are as follows:
Event No. 1, -12 m. —Preliminary
flights, national low-board diving cham
pionship.
Event No. 2, 2 p.m.—220-yard free

medley race, finals.
Event No. G, 2:50 p.m.—Exhibition
high and fancy diving.
Event No. 7, 3 p.m.—Water polo, two
games.
The Cardinal seven took a light
workout last night in preparation for
, its game tomorrow' at 3 o'clock. Draw-

irigs have not yet been made for op
ponents, but the Stanford seven will
meet tomorrow in the first game of the
events.
Besides the water polo team Coach
Ernst Brandsten has entered eight
men. Divers are M. R. Gibbons, \V. A.
Mills, E. A. Smith, and J. E. Kenney.
The first three of these will handle
the low board diving and Kenney will
enter the high board competition. D.
A. Fall, who was rated as the best the
Cardinals had to offer this year, will
not compete because of sinus trouble.
C. B. Stevenson, swimming the 500-
yard free style race, will meet some
of the stiffest competition available.
Pyzel, swimming his last race under
Stanford colors, will compete in the
220 breaststroke.
"The water polo team, captain by
McCallister, has made great steps for
ward from the shape and condition it
was in during the tour south. Stiff
training since then has turned Brand
sten's seven form an average college
team to a redoutable contender for
national honors.
Two 1924 Olympic team players are
in the ranks of the Stanford seven,
Collett at goal guard, and Carson, one
of the forwards. Collett has been play
ing an erratic game during the prac
tice games of the past few weeks rang
ing from excellence to mediocrity.
Brandsten's forwards tomorrow will
probably be Myers, Carson, and Luster.
Myers, last year's flashy player, is ex
pected to return to form in the meet
this week. Carson is one of the few
Stanford men that can meet speed
with speed. He will therefore be in
valuable in the clashes with I. A. C.
or the Venice Athletic Club's team.
Backs for the game tomorrow will
probably be McCallister, Williams,
and Allen. Captain McCallister is the
most experienced of the three. Wil
liams stepped Into the hole left by
Schmeider and will play his first na
tionals game tomorrow. Allen is a
fast and clever player.
The other men who have been en
tered by Coach Brandsten are Wright,
Hubbard, Poulsen, Stewart, Morrison,
and Draper. Any one of these may be
called upon to substitute.
