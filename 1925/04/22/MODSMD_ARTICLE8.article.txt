THOUGH Borg and Weissmuller may not race together in the meet tomorrow
they will form the greatest crowd-drawing combine in the competition.
Borg was one of the stars in the last Olympic Games, placing fourth in the
100 meters, and second in the 400 and 1500 i meters. He finished six inches
behind WeissmuJler in the 400.
Kakanamoku, star of the 1912 Olympic Games, is back again in the best
of condition. Though he had every reason in the world to drop out of the
game in 1920, the Duke kept on training and in the 1924 Olympic Games
finished second to Weissmuller in the 100 meters. He and his brother will
meet the I. A. C. flash again this week-end.
