# PROFESSOR DOANE TALKS ON INSECTS
## 
### 
R. W. Doane, associate professor of
! entomology, will discuss "Injects and
Our Campus Trees" in an illustrated
lecture to be given before a meeting
of the Science Association at 8 o'clock
tomorrow evening in the Faculty Club
house.
In the early days the Stanford arbo
retum consisted mainly of pine trees.
Now there are comparatively few and
of these, more are being cut out every
year. This disappearance of the pines
has been caused by outbreaks of sev
eral different species of beetles, the
attacks of which cause the trees to
become diseased, and necessitate their
being cut out. During the last outbreak
: more than sixty pines were killed in
this manner. The Monterey Cyprus
i and oak trees are also subject to the
i
| attacks of these pests.
Professor Doane will discuss the
damages wrought by these insects and
| the measures that are being taken to
control them. All the trees in the
| arboretum have been examined, and
I those that are badly infested have
been ordered cut out. Once a tree has
been attacked by beetles there is no
I way of saving it. Removal will prevent
its serving as a breeding place for the
j insects.
Slides and specimens of beetles and
damaged trees will be shown at the
! lecture.
