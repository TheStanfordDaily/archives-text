# SIGMA CHI WINS 13-3 GAME FROM ALPHA DELI NINE
## Theta Xi, Phi Delts, El Campo Win in Other Third Round Intramural Tilts 
### 
Theta Xi, defeated last week, tangled
up the race for the plaque in League I
by trouncing the hitherto undefeated
Chi Psi nine, 6-3. El Campo downed
the Phi Psis, 13 to 0. Sigma Chi took
a 13 to 0 win from Alpha Delta Phi,
and Phi Delta Theta defeated Theta
Delta Chi 6 to 3.
Sigma Chi remained in the pennant
race by slugging out 13 runs against
the Alpha Delts. Jayred started in the
box for the losers, and before he was
taken out in the third, the Sigs had
piled up a six-run lead. Dennis, reliev
ing Jayred, held Sigma Chi for one
inning but he eventually proved as
easy as Jayred. Together, the Alpha
Delt hurlers were slammed for 18 hits.
The second was the Sigs' big inning,
when three walks, and two hits by
Clark and King counted four runs.
Two runs were scored in the first, fifth,
and seventh frames, and three more
in the sixth. Clark starred for the
Sigma Chis with three hits out of
three trips to the plate, one being a
three-base clout. King, Walker, and
Krogness also starred.
Chi Psi, hitherto considered the
