# SIGMA CHI WINS 13-3 GAME FROM ALPHA DELI NINE
## Theta Xi, Phi Delts, El Campo Win in Other Third Round Intramural Tilts 
### 
Theta Xi, defeated last week, tangled
up the race for the plaque in League I
by trouncing the hitherto undefeated
Chi Psi nine, 6-3. El Campo downed
the Phi Psis, 13 to 0. Sigma Chi took
a 13 to 0 win from Alpha Delta Phi,
and Phi Delta Theta defeated Theta
Delta Chi 6 to 3.
Sigma Chi remained in the pennant
race by slugging out 13 runs against
the Alpha Delts. Jayred started in the
box for the losers, and before he was
taken out in the third, the Sigs had
piled up a six-run lead. Dennis, reliev
ing Jayred, held Sigma Chi for one
inning but he eventually proved as
easy as Jayred. Together, the Alpha
Delt hurlers were slammed for 18 hits.
The second was the Sigs' big inning,
when three walks, and two hits by
Clark and King counted four runs.
Two runs were scored in the first, fifth,
and seventh frames, and three more
in the sixth. Clark starred for the
Sigma Chis with three hits out of
three trips to the plate, one being a
three-base clout. King, Walker, and
Krogness also starred.
Chi Psi, hitherto considered the
likely winner of League I, was easily
defeated by the Theta Xi nine. Mail
lot, after having been clouted heavily
last week, came back and fanned six
teen Chi Psis, while Ditzler fanned but
twelve. Maillot had a bad inning in
the second, when hits by Fassoth and
Hays, and two walks counted up three
runs for the Chi Psis, but after that
he held them.
Theta Xi's big inning was the sec
ond. Hits by both Scofield, Maillot,
and Freeman, and one walk chalked
up four runs for the victors. Two more
followed in the fifth, when hits by
Lawrence, Maillot, and Hotchkiss
brought in runs. Maillot starred at bat
for the winners and scored two runs
for the Theta Xis.
El Campo won its second victory of
the season, and blanked its second
opponent by trouncing the Phi Psis
13 to 0. In two starts, the Phi Psi nine
has failed to score one run.
Britton held the Phi Psis completely
in hand at all times, and though he
struck out but seven men. was never
in danger. Only twenty-six men faced
him in seven frames. Both teams were
scoreless the first inning, but three
runs in the second by Britton, For
sythe, and Lockhart started the El
Campo scoring. As the game pro
gressed the El Campo total increased.
Reem was leading hitter for the win
ners by clouting out three hits in four
times at bat.
Phi Delta Theta handed Theta Delta
Chi her third straight defeat of the
season, winning 6 to 3. Randolph, Phi
Delt hurler, held the Theta Delts score
less for five innings, allowing one run
in the second and two in the third.
He fanned ten men.
The Phi Delts piled up an early lead
of three runs in the first inning, when
a hit by McHose, one walk, and two
errors allowed three Phi Delts to cross
the plate. In the second the game was
cinched when hits by McHose and
Fletcher counted two runs for the vic
tors. After that the game tightened up
and was scoreless except for a lone
tally by the Phi Delts in the last
frame.
Games Friday are: Encina Third vs.
Breakers; Sequoia I vs. Encina II;
Alpha Sigma Phi vs. Independents;
Zeta Psi vs. Kappa Sigma.

the second, when hits by Fassoth and
Hays, and two walks counted up three
runs for the Chi Psis, but after that

Theta Xi's big inning was the sec

up four runs for the victors. Two more
followed in the fifth, when hits by
Lawrence, Maillot, and Hotchkiss
brought in runs. Maillot starred at bat
for the winners and scored two runs
for the Theta Xis.
El Campo won its second victory of
the season, and blanked its second
opponent by trouncing the Phi Psis
13 to 0. In two starts, the Phi Psi nine
has failed to score one run.
Britton held the Phi Psis completely
in hand at all times, and though he
struck out but seven men. was never
in danger. Only twenty-six men faced
him in seven frames. Both teams were
scoreless the first inning, but three
runs in the second by Britton, For
sythe, and Lockhart started the El
Campo scoring. As the game pro
gressed the El Campo total increased.
Reem was leading hitter for the win
ners by clouting out three hits in four
times at bat.
Phi Delta Theta handed Theta Delta
Chi her third straight defeat of the
season, winning 6 to 3. Randolph, Phi
Delt hurler, held the Theta Delts score
less for five innings, allowing one run
in the second and two in the third.
He fanned ten men.
The Phi Delts piled up an early lead
of three runs in the first inning, when
a hit by McHose, one walk, and two
errors allowed three Phi Delts to cross
the plate. In the second the game was
cinched when hits by McHose and
Fletcher counted two runs for the vic

and was scoreless except for a lone

Theta Xi, defeated last week, tangled
up the race for the plaque in League I
by trouncing the hitherto undefeated
Chi Psi nine, 6-3. El Campo downed
the Phi Psis, 13 to 0. Sigma Chi took
a 13 to 0 win from Alpha Delta Phi,
and Phi Delta Theta defeated Theta
Delta Chi 6 to 3.
Sigma Chi remained in the pennant
race by slugging out 13 runs against
the Alpha Delts. Jayred started in the
box for the losers, and before he was
taken out in the third, the Sigs had
piled up a six-run lead. Dennis, reliev
ing Jayred, held Sigma Chi for one
inning but he eventually proved as
easy as Jayred. Together, the Alpha
Delt hurlers were slammed for 18 hits.
The second was the Sigs' big inning,
when three walks, and two hits by
Clark and King counted four runs.
Two runs were scored in the first, fifth,
and seventh frames, and three more
in the sixth. Clark starred for the
Sigma Chis with three hits out of
three trips to the plate, one being a
three-base clout. King, Walker, and
Krogness also starred.
Chi Psi, hitherto considered the
likely winner of League I, was easily
defeated by the Theta Xi nine. Mail
lot, after having been clouted heavily
last week, came back and fanned six
teen Chi Psis, while Ditzler fanned but
twelve. Maillot had a bad inning in
