# FREAK CRAFT MAKES APPEARANCE ON LAKE; LOOKS LIKE GONDOLA
## 
### 
The latest gondola to make its ap
pearance on the lake is an ancient
rowboat, lean, long, and low, with the
seat and back of an old kitchen chair
as the throne for the campus queen—
if campus queen e'er dared set foot
in it.
One can easily imagine Cleopatra
sailing down the Nile ensconced in its
(then) regal splendor. Once it un
doubtedly shed water —now all that
can be said is that it holds water!
This patriarch of the waters still
justifies its existence, however, by giv
ing innocent and harmless pleasure to
some aquatic sheik and his lady. »
