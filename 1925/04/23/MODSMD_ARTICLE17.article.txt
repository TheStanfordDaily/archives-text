# WERRANRATH SINGS TONIGHT IN FINAL PENINSULA CONCERT
## 
### Herbert Klein 
Many competent critics would give
Reinald Werrenrath, who sings to
night in the Assembly hall, one of the
topmost places of the baritones. Practi
cally all would agree that he has no
peer among American singers.
Reviews from some of the many
musical crtics are unanimous in hearty
approval of the Werrenrath art. "Few
singers give better-rounded pleasure
than Mr. Werrenrath" says the Boston
Transcript. "One of America's leading
singers" adds the New York Evening
Telegram, while the critic of the Eve
ning Mail says, "As often as we have
heard him sing we still think he is,
supreme." Reasons for Werrenrath's
special appeal cited by the New York
Herald are, "A beautiful baritone
voice, a subtle, elegant, finished, and
richly-colored delivery, imagination,
communicative power, and a command
of the pronunciation of text."
The concert tonight will be the last
of a series of four given in the Stan
ford Assembly Hall under the auspices
of the Peninsula Music Association.
The others in the order of appearance
were Eva Gauthier, mezzo soprano;
Maier and Pattison, "pianistic twins;"
Ernest von Dohnanyi, Hungarian pian
ist and composer, appearing jointly
with the Chamber Music Society of
San Francisco, and now, last but far
from least, Werrenrath, whose vocal
powers have impressed all who have
heard him.
The successful career of Reinald
Werenrath seems to refute the popu
lar idea that a singer to achieve fame
and popularity in America must be
European born and raised. His birth
place was Brooklyn, New York; he
made his debut in the Metropolitan
Opera, and now makes his home in
New York City during the few months
lie is not going from city to city filling
his many concert engagements. Dur
ing the musical season of 1923-24 his
travels totalled over sixty thousand
miles and at that time the Pa'ciflc
coast was not included in his itinerary.
