# CARDINAL VARSITY TO MEET BRUINS IN DECIDING GAME
## Last-Minute Decision by U. C. Managers Permits Game Saturday 
### 
California will meet the Stanford
baseball nine in the final game of the
series on the Stanford diamond Satur
day at 3:30, as was originally planned,
according to an announcement from
the graduate manager's office late yes
terday. The Stanford officials refused
to play the deciding contest in the
California stadium, and the Berkeley
manager had cancelled the series. The
schedule originally called for the
match to be staged on the Stanford
field.
When the report came from Berke
ley that the contest was off, the Cardi
nal season was considered over and
the varsity men turned in their uni
forms. Many of the baseball players
had already reported for spring foot
ball when word was received that
California had reconsidered, and the
contest would be staged Saturday.
The series is now a tie and this
week's game will decide the 1925
honors. Two weeks ago California won
the first contest by the overwhelming
score of 27 to 5. Nevers started this
game but he was taken out of the
box after having walked seven men
in the first three innings. Oviatt, Col
lins, and Reese pitched, and each one
allowed his share of runs.
After this decisive defeat Stanford
was not conceded a chance against
the Bears. But the Redshirts came
back last Saturday and nosed Califor
nia out in the last inning. California
led 3 to 2 when Stanford came to bat
for the last time. Nevers started the
fireworks by walking. Roberts followed
with a bunt that landed him safely on
first base. Then Captain Johnson con
nected and drove in the two runs that
won the contest.
Nevers hit his stride in last week's
game. He was steady on the mound,
only allowing seven scattered hits. He
walked but one California player and
struck out six of the Bears. Nevers
will pitch again Saturday afternoon.
The final game is doped to be a
pitching battle between Nevers and
Nounan of California. Nounan was in
the box for the Berkeleyites last Sat
urday. He allowed one more hit than
did Nevers and he walked four men.
