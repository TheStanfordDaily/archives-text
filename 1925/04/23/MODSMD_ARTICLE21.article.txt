# Freshman Runner Attempts To Break Distance Record
## 
### 
Dick Witter, a freshman, was of
fered $25 if he ran to Sunnyvale and
back, a distance of 18 miles. Last
night at 10, swathed in sweaters, and
accompanied by a little band of boost
ers in autos, he started the long, gruel
ling run. For 2 hours and 10 minutes
he struggled along the route, but
shortly after passing the 14 mile posts
and with his goal almost in sight,
cramps attacked his weary muscles
and forced him to give up the attempt.
Witter says that he may try again in
the future.
