# Merry Monarchs
## 
### 
Long years ago when ready-made clothes for men came from a
foundry, any decent, self-respecting King had to get his job by pulling a
magic sword from an anvil, or by freeing at least one countryside of
dragons. And, at that, a man could never be sure that he would have
justice done. He was just as likely to be made a saint instead. All of
which led to grim business, as those who have heard about King Arthur
may know.
But democratic practice has eliminated the uncertainty by conspicu
ously printing on the ballot the name of the office. And in the current
election for King and Queen of the Masque Ball, moreover, such gory
qualifications as conflict and slaughter have been supplanted by those of
joviality and laughter. We're seeking merry monarchs.
It has ever been the custom here to select the best-natured King and
the most charming Queen for leaders in our annual festivity, who are to
be found throughout the length and breadth of the campus. What enthu
siasm the candidate lacks is further and commendable reason for voting
for him. Modesty is a splendid quality.
But the enthusiasm of the campaign managers makes up the deficiency.
On every side are mouthed the slogans, "Cut the bucks for Hatchet,"
"Salt your savings on Enos," "A vote for Tex's no tax," and other cash
collecting campaign crys.
The students are happy supporting their favorite. The Rally Commit
tee is happy at hearing the cash clink. The candidates are happy—there's
always a chance of losing (modesty again, mind you). Everybody else is
happy for no reason at all. Whoopee!
Long live the King and Queen !
