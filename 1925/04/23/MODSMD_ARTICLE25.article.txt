# The 						"Old-Fashioned" Nightshirt
## 
### 
Style-makers announce that the "old-fashioned nightshirt" is again in
vogue; that more nightshirts than pajamas were purchased by men during
the past year. They go on to describe the garment they term the "old
fashioned nightshirt."
The body is of a solid color, they say, with collar and cuffs of a vividly
contrasting hue. So this is the old-fashioned nightshirt! This the gar
ment worn by a modern breed, known by the same name given the creation
in which our paternal ancestors encased themselves at night!
What man who honors the memory of his father, who nightly donned
a plain and honest garment of flannelette or linen, could bring himself to
wear one of these parti-colored monstrosities which the style-makers
flaunt before us ? The wearing of pajamas embodied no such irreverence;
pajamas were frankly an exotic extravagance; but their wearing might be
defended on the grounds of utilitarianism and comfort.
The flamboyant vestments we are now asked to put on insult the very
name of nightshirt. Egad, 'tis shameful!
If nightshirts it is to be, let us by all means have nightshirts; but night
shirts that embody some regard for decency and the eternal fitness of
things. The American home is in danger. Gentlemen, do your duty !
