# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
In yesterday's editorial, under the
heading "Bad News," you criticized
a recent decision of the Men's Coun
cil. A contrast was made between this
decision, which added 15 hours to the
graduation requirements, as a penalty
for intoxication, and that which would
have been made by a court of law. By
an exaggerated method of figuring the
Stanford penalty was given a mone
tary value of 3350 and that of a law
court as $25.
There is gross error in the esti
mates because one spends almost as
much while not in the University as
while here. Besides, it is a privilege
to be able to stay at Stanford and
being compelled to stay one quarter
more is not a severe penalty, indeed.
If it were expulsion, it would be se
ven}, and such is the provision made
for continuous offense. Furthermore,
this decision, countersigned by Presi
dent Wilbur, did not disclose the name
of the offender.
If a court of law had handled this
case the punishment would have prob
ably been a night in jail nnd a $25
fine with publicity, our article rated
the penalties at the ratio of 350 to 25,
but it seems that the court method
would have been the severest.
I wish to say that I believe that the
Men's Council assessed the penalty
with due regard to all the circum-

stances and deserves commendation
rather than criticism. Presumably
they had evidence that was not public
and were certainly in a better position
to judge than one on the outside. It
is easy enough to criticize when one
does not have all the facts.
Let's stand with the Men's Council
—not against it. —Walter J. Nelson.
