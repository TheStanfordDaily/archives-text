HISTORY OF THE McCUBBIN CLAN
Maud McCubbin
"The oustanding incident in my life
is my great love. At the age of sixteen,
I was madly attracted to a young Dip
tera, named Horace Fly. Much as I
loved Horace, I could not attract him
to me.

"After weeks of pri
k vate grief, I finally de-
Icided to ask the ad
| vice of my mother.
Rushing to her, I flung
myself upon my knees
at her feet and sobbed
out my tale.
"Mother simply
smiled at me. "Daugh
ter," she said, "the
reason that Horace is
not attracted to you is
because your ears are
too long."
"Overjoyed to find
how simple my prob
lem really was, I

Maud McCubbin rushed out and had
my hair bobbed. The
next day horace did not recognize me
as the old Maud.
"He has been hanging around ever
since.
"It only goes to show that a girl
should never give up hope. With
mother's asistance, I fooled Horace
Fly, and any other clever girl can
do the same thing."—Harp and Fiddle.

STANFORD TWENTY YEARS AGO
By Anna Lumna
"Seeing this election of Queen of
the Carnival reminds me of the way
this sort of an affair was conducted
back in *05.
"Then there was none of this mer
cenary system. Instead, the queen was
discovered in the same manner used
in the old fairy tale. You no doubt re
member that tale—where the beauti
ful woman was made to sleep on a
small pea which was such an unwonted
discomfort that she was disturbed in
her sleep.
"Now in this election, my best
friend, Mary Ann McCarty, was nomi
nated. Mary was undoubtedly the dain
tiest girl on the campus and the best
bred in our sorority. I felt sure that
she would win in the trial. My heart
was positively fluttering as I put that
flat-iron in her bed.
"My misgivings were totally un
founded. Mary Ann had been in bed
barely an hour when the flat-iron be
gan to bother her. She was awarded
the prize.
"There was a great deal of talk at
the time to the effect that it was a
hot flat-iron that I put in Mary Ann's
bed. This is absolutely untrue. That
scar is where a horse kicked Mary
Ann. I had nothing to do with it."
