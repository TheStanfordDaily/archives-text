The inhabitants of Roble spend
twelve dollars per day at their branch
of the Union which is known as the
"Hole" and is situated in the Roble
basement. According to Mary Jane
Baldwin, who runs the store, 66 per
cent of this is spent for candy, 15 per
cent is invested in toilet articles, 14
per cent in fruit, and 5 per cent in
soup.
The Roble trade is heaviest on days
when the girls take gym, and very
light on other days. Practically noth
ing is sold right after vacation, due,
no doubt, to the fact that the girls
bring food from home.
Last quarter there was an extensive
supply of jewelry displayed in the
"Hole," but only men's jewelry was
sold. It has been suggested that the
Roble girls are preparing for Christ
mas.
