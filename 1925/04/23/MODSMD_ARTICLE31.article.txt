Perhaps you have noticed that the
present-day policy in advertising
seems to be to say as little as possible
about the commodity advertised. It
seems quite probable that pictures of
pretty girls with their hands resting
on an indiscriminate steering wheel
have sold more motor cars than all the
elaborate explanations of mechanical
advantages ever published.
So it is with Mr. and Mrs. Haddock
(to Bay nothing of little Mildred) in
their trip to Europe. If you would like
to wander aimlessly off on a series of
absurd tangents with a succession of
humorous climaxes, you would get an
enormous throb out of Mr. Stewart's
attempts at the ludicrous.
"Mr. and Mrs. Haddock Abroad,"
(not to mention little Mildred) is the
last of four parodies by Mr. Stewart.
The inimitable author seems to have
a marvelous supply of distorted situa
tions which he can supply at a mo
ment's notice, and even after three
highly humorous burlesques the result
is one of the funniest books on travel,
"with or without premeditation or de
sign on the part of the travelers," that
has ever been written.
No one but Herb Roth could have
furnished illustrations that so cleverly
catch the spirit, any more than an
other artist could satisfactorily replace
the Cruickshank pictures in "Pickwick
Papers."â€”K. D.

A movement has been started among
undergraduates at Princeton to abolish
compulsory chapel attendance.
