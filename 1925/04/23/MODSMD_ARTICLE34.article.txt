# FRENCH CLUB PLANS COMEDY BY FRANCE
## 
### 
"La Comedie de Celui qui Epousa
june Feninie Muette," by Anatole
j France, will be one of the plays pro
! duced by the Cercle Francaise, Friday
1 evening, May 15, at 8 o'clock in the
! Little Theatre, for the benefit of the
j French war orphans which the club
! adopted during the war.
This play was given by the Faculty
Club several years ago, in English.
The date of the ticket sale will be
announced shortly.
The subject of the farce is the mar
riage of a certain judge and 'a dumb
wife. The wife's speech is restored to
her through the intervention of Maitre
Simon Colline, a physician famed for
his unusual powers, and the husband
fondly believes that perfect happiness
is attained.
It is not long, however, before he
discovers an error in his calculation.*,
for the wife turns out to have been
dumb for merely physical reasons, and
all that was needed was for Maitre
Simon "to cut," as he himself ex
pressed it, "the thread withholding a
flood of words."

"La Comedie de Celui qui Epousa
june Feninie Muette," by Anatole
j France, will be one of the plays pro
! duced by the Cercle Francaise, Friday
1 evening, May 15, at 8 o'clock in the
! Little Theatre, for the benefit of the
j French war orphans which the club
! adopted during the war.
This play was given by the Faculty
Club several years ago, in English.
The date of the ticket sale will be
announced shortly.
The subject of the farce is the mar
riage of a certain judge and 'a dumb
wife. The wife's speech is restored to
her through the intervention of Maitre
Simon Colline, a physician famed for
his unusual powers, and the husband
fondly believes that perfect happiness
is attained.
It is not long, however, before he
discovers an error in his calculation.*,
for the wife turns out to have been
dumb for merely physical reasons, and
all that was needed was for Maitre
Simon "to cut," as he himself ex
pressed it, "the thread withholding a
flood of words."
The cast for the play, which will be
coached by Professor S. A. Smith, of
the French department, is as follows:
