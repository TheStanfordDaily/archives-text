# LAKE SPORTS WILL BE ON JUNIOR WEEK PROGRAM FOR MAY 9
## 
### 
Lake sports will be revived this year
at Lagunita on May 9, which is the
big day of Junior Week. The commit
tee under P. W. Shumaker has worked
o'lt an entertaining program that is
scheduled to start early in the after
noon and continue until G in the eve
ning.
A new swimming stunt will be put
on this year in the form of a 15-man
interclass relay race. It will be called
the Swedish Marathon and an attempt
will be made to make it an annual
event like the Irish Marathon on the
track. Each of the four classes are
entering teams and a trophy is being
offered to the winning outfit. The laps
will be 50 yards in length.
The cross-lake swim holds the cen
ter of interest. Only students are al
lowed to enter this event, and the best
swimmers in the University will be
competing for the title. Wallace O'Con
ner won the race in 1923 when he beat
Lester Smith of the Olympic Club.
Arne Borg has consented to give an
exhibition swim as a special event of
the afternoon. A picked relay team
will furnish competition for the cham
pion. Fancy diving is also a feature of
the entertainment.
Besides swimming, there are to be
canoe and skiff races. The canoe races
will be over a triangular course while
the skiff row will be across the lake.
Two men are allowed in each canoe,
but only one man will handle a skiff.
Canoe-tilting ends the lake fun. This
tilting contest will be run off in the
form of a championship and winners
will receive a cup for the honor. The
rules governing the canoe fight are
that the tilter must stand up in the
canoe, and when he has been shoved
into the water he is eliminated. The
paddlers who guidte the bjrch-bark
must remain seated.
The plans as they now stand call
for a dance at the boathouse during
the latter part of the afternoon. The
Stanford band will play throughout the
performance.
