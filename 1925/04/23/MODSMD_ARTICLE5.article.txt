# PARTIAL REPORT FROM INTRAMURAL SWIM FAVORS BETAS
## 
### 
Though final results of the inter
fraternity and intramural swimming
meet held last Friday have not yet
been obtained because the plunge and
diving events are yet on the program, ;
Beta Theta Pi is favored to capture J
one, if not both the meets. The remain- j
ing events will probably be held to-,
morrow or Monday.
In the intramural meet the Betas
tied for first with the Breakers with
18 points, while in the interfraternity
meet the Row team led with 23 points,
three points more than Phi Kappa Psi. j
The standings of the teams at pres-1
ent as given last night by P. W. i
Shumaker, who managed the meet, are
as follows:
Intramural —Beta Theta Pi, 18; j
Breakers, 18; Phi Kappa Psi, 13; Phi
Delta Theta, 10; Encina, 9; Independ-'
ents, 7.
Interfraternity—Beta Theta Pi, 23; j
Phi Kappa Psi, 20; Phi Delta Theta, I
19; Delta Chi, 5.
Partial results of the plunge thus
far give Encina, Alpha Sigma Phi, and j
the Breakers chances of being in the ;
lead. This may be changed by results
of plunging tomorrow.
