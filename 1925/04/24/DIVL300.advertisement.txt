"Dodson's Hints on Musical Hits"
"I Like Pie—l Like Cake—But I
Like You Best of All" commemorates
the appearance of another new Victor
dance orchestra. Edwin J. McEnelly's
Orchestra plays the aforementioned
little ditty with more stuff per needle
groove than you have ever heard
before, fts companion number, "Desert
Isle," is equally interesting. Both are
chipper, vibrant, thoroughly live fox
trots with all the requisites for the
most critical dancer or listener.
Jane Green, whom you may have
heard at the Orpheum last year, waxes
tearful over the joys of farming in a
song misnamed "A Minima Like You
and a Papa Like Me." She isn't at all
bashful, Jane isn't, and uses an unusu
ally husky feminine voice to good ad
vantage in illustrating the calls of the
beasts and birdies of the farm.
Three other sure-fire hits worth
listening to when you're down* our
way:
" H ot-H ot-H ottentot"
"It's the Blues"
"Cheatin' on Me"
