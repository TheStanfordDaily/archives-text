# singer RECEIVES OVATION IN LAST RECITAL OF YEAR
## Werrenrath, Noted Baritone; Accompanist Please in Peninsula Concert 
### Herbert Klein 
So well did the singing of Reinald
Werrenrath, noted baritone, please
the large audience in the concert given
in the Assembly hall last night that
time after time he was called back
for encores. His accompanist, Herbert
Carrick, was also accorded an enthu
siastic reception for his solo piano
numbers, and was obliged to encore
twice.
Werrenrath appeared to accomplish
with equal ease the most delicate
shadings of tone and the greatest de
gree of volume. His voice was rich
and vibrant and rose from a subdued
whisper to great tones that filled the
hall, with perfect smoothness.
Werrenrath has dramatic as well as
vocal capabilities. He is an artist who
needs to be seen as well as heard in !
order to understand why he is able
to capture his hearers so completely. !
His singing of "Danny Deever," Kip-;
ling's poem of the hanging of a Brit- j
ish soldier, was more a dramatic nar-1
rative than a song, and the "Prologue !
to Pagliacci" was also rendered with
the same expression of voice and man-1
ner. His easy stage presence and the
vital interest he seemed to take in
acli number as he sang it added to j
the effective way in which he used ,
his almost unequalled voice showed I
him to merit the high place he occu- j
pies in the world of singing.
The accompanist, Herbert Carrick, j
contributed much to the success of
the program by his careful and at
tentive following of fhe singer and his i
brilliant playing in solo numbers. He \
played "Waltz in C sharp minor" and j
"Polonaise in A flat," both by Chopin,
bringing out the delicacy of one and j
the martial rhythm of the other in a
style that showed him to be far above j
the usual run of singers' accompanists. j
He responded to encores with a weird ■
half-humorous "Juba Dance" by Na- 1
thaniel Dett and with a Rachmaninoff
"Prelude" in the same finished man
ner.
Last night's concert concluded the
season of the Peninsula Music Asso-'
ciation. Four concerts were given by
the association in the Stanford Assem
bly hall this year. Practically every 1
aeat was occupied for Werrenrath's;
recital.

Last night's concert concluded the
season of the Peninsula Music Asso-'
ciation. Four concerts were given by
the association in the Stanford Assem
bly hall this year. Practically every 1
aeat was occupied for Werrenrath's;
recital.
So well did the singing of Reinald
Werrenrath, noted baritone, please
the large audience in the concert given
in the Assembly hall last night that
time after time he was called back
for encores. His accompanist, Herbert
Carrick, was also accorded an enthu
siastic reception for his solo piano
numbers, and was obliged to encore
twice.
Werrenrath appeared to accomplish
with equal ease the most delicate
shadings of tone and the greatest de
gree of volume. His voice was rich
and vibrant and rose from a subdued
whisper to great tones that filled the
hall, with perfect smoothness.
Werrenrath has dramatic as well as
vocal capabilities. He is an artist who
needs to be seen as well as heard in !
order to understand why he is able
to capture his hearers so completely. !
His singing of "Danny Deever," Kip-;
ling's poem of the hanging of a Brit- j
ish soldier, was more a dramatic nar-1
rative than a song, and the "Prologue !
to Pagliacci" was also rendered with
the same expression of voice and man-1
ner. His easy stage presence and the
vital interest he seemed to take in
acli number as he sang it added to j
the effective way in which he used ,
his almost unequalled voice showed I
him to merit the high place he occu- j
pies in the world of singing.
The accompanist, Herbert Carrick, j
contributed much to the success of
the program by his careful and at
tentive following of fhe singer and his i
brilliant playing in solo numbers. He \
played "Waltz in C sharp minor" and j
"Polonaise in A flat," both by Chopin,
bringing out the delicacy of one and j
the martial rhythm of the other in a
style that showed him to be far above j
the usual run of singers' accompanists. j
He responded to encores with a weird ■
half-humorous "Juba Dance" by Na- 1
thaniel Dett and with a Rachmaninoff
"Prelude" in the same finished man
ner.
