# EL TIGRE NINE BEATS ALPHA TAU OMEGA IN FAST GAME
## 
### Cliff Moore 
El Tigre defeated Alpha Tau Omega
i yesterday afternoon in one of the best
' contests played in intramural baseball
competition this year by a score of
5 to 4. Sigma Nu severely trounced
! Branner, 21 to 1, El Toro took an easy
I win over El Cuadro, 12 to 1, and the
1 Union team forfeited to Phi Kappa
1 Sigma.
The El Tigre-A. T. O. encounter was
a pitcher's battle from the first to
1 the last. Woods, of the fraternity
team, and Newton, El Tigre's hurle"?,
battled for supremacy throughout the
i entire contest.
Woods maintained his enviable
strike-out record by fanning fourteen
batters. Newton succeeded in dispos
ing of twelve opponents by the same
method.
Pegram gave the A. T. O.'s a lead
j in the first inning when he connected
I with one of Newton's offerings for a
; home run with one runner on the
bases. El Tigre retalliated in their
half of the first, tying the count at
two-all. Both teams counted for one
run in the thfrd and the game re
mained a tie until the sixth.
El Tigre marked up two runs in the
sixth, giving them a two-run advan
tage over their opponents. A. T. O.
made a gallant effort to win the game
in the last inning but only succeeded
j in scoring two runs.
El Toro Wins
El Toro easily defeated El Cuadro
in one of the worst exhibitions of
baseball seen on the intramural dia
monds this year. The score, 12 to 1,
shows clearly the' superiority of the
El Toro nine. The game was marked
by poor fielding and free hitting, with
El Toro scoring almost at will.
The winners piled up a safe lead in
i the first frame with a total of four
1 runs. From that stage on the game was
I a regular fiasco with both teams play
ing a ragged brand of baseball.
Two home runs were made in the
I game, Harris of El Cuadro connecting
for a four-base hit in the sixth, and
Sherrill of El Toro for a similar crash
in the third canto. Incidentally, Har
ris' circuit clout was the only tally
made by the El Cuadro team.
Busch pitched a creditable game for
the winners and maintained the ad
vantage over his rival, Harris, for the
whole game. Harris was not given
very good support, however, and this
fact had a decided effect on the score.
Jack Sutro, star batter on the El Toro
team, mde a perfect record at bat,
smashing out five hits in five times up,
scoring three runs.
Branner Trounced
Sigma Nu established a large score
record when it defeated Branner by
the almost unbelievable Bcore of 21
to 1. The fraternity nine demonstrated
plenty of class, never once being
pressed by their decidedly inferior
opponents.
Branner's defeat in a large measure
was caused by the absence of its regu
lar pitcher, "Lefty" May, and the sub
stitute appearing in his place was un
able to control the ball with any
degree of success.
Sigma Nu connected for four runs
in the first, four more in the second,
three in the third, two in the fourth,
four in the fifth, and three in the
sixth. The row sluggers crashed out
a total of twenty-two hits, setting an
other mark for other intramural teams
to shoot at.
Branner had three men on bases at

two different times but were unable to
come through at the critical moments.
Their only run was scored in the sixth
inning.
Games scheduled for Monday are:
Alpha Kappa Lambda vs. Encina I,
Beta Theta Pi vs. Delta Upsilon, El
Capitan vs. Sequoia 11, Theta Xi vs.
El Campo, Alpha Delta Phi vs. Chi Psi.
