! Branner, 21 to 1, El Toro took an easy
I win over El Cuadro, 12 to 1, and the
1 Union team forfeited to Phi Kappa
1 Sigma.
The El Tigre-A. T. O. encounter was
a pitcher's battle from the first to
1 the last. Woods, of the fraternity
team, and Newton, El Tigre's hurle"?,
battled for supremacy throughout the

made a gallant effort to win the game
in the last inning but only succeeded

El Toro Wins
El Toro easily defeated El Cuadro
in one of the worst exhibitions of
baseball seen on the intramural dia
monds this year. The score, 12 to 1,
shows clearly the' superiority of the
El Toro nine. The game was marked
by poor fielding and free hitting, with
El Toro scoring almost at will.
The winners piled up a safe lead in
i the first frame with a total of four
1 runs. From that stage on the game was
I a regular fiasco with both teams play
ing a ragged brand of baseball.
Two home runs were made in the
I game, Harris of El Cuadro connecting
