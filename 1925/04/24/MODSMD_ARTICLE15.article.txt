center, received a broken nose in one
of the first plays of the season, in a
center buck.
Hertli and Moore wrenched their
shoulders so badly that they will be
out of practice for the rest of the
year. However, their injuries should
not prevent them from participating
next fall.
Eight full teams have been chosen,
and each afternoon the teams are
matched against.each other. In these
scrimmages the actual ability of the
players can be discovered.

up well on the various teams. Everett,
Davidson, Post, and Robesky are the
most likely candidates for line posi
tions. Hill and Young of the freshman
