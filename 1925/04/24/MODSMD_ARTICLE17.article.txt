San Jose Possible Victor
San Jose High looms as a possible
victor by virtue of its overwhelming
victory in the Peninsula Athletic
League meet last Saturday on the old
track. Palo Alto, Berkeley, Menlo, and
Alameda will also be in the running
for honors.
Several athletes on the peninsula
have turned in outstanding records the
past few weeks. Hulsman of San Jose
does 12 feet 6 inches consistently in
the pole vault and should break the
old record of 12 feet. Fleishacker of
j Menlo will be trying for records in the
shot and discus. He broke the shot
record last Saturday of the P. A. L.
when he tossed the weight 48 feet B*£
inches. This is two inches short of
! the mark of Weeks of Santa Rosa
[ made in 1916.
The discus record is 127 feet 1 3-8
| inches. Fleishacker has not done more
! than 120 this season, however.
I One of the best races of the day will
;be the duel between Earl Kenney of
! Alameda and Schmidt of San Jose in
j the 100-yard dash. Kenney won this
! event in the Alameda County meet
and has been doing :10 flat in almost
| every meet this year. Schmidt took
first place in this event in the Penin
| sula League meet. Wilson of Palo Alto
i High School has been a consistent
j performer this season and may give
j these stars a surprise. Garcia of Hol
: lister may also figure in this event.
The half-mile will be another close
