San Jose Possible Victor
San Jose High looms as a possible
victor by virtue of its overwhelming
victory in the Peninsula Athletic
League meet last Saturday on the old
track. Palo Alto, Berkeley, Menlo, and
Alameda will also be in the running
for honors.
Several athletes on the peninsula
have turned in outstanding records the
past few weeks. Hulsman of San Jose
does 12 feet 6 inches consistently in
the pole vault and should break the
old record of 12 feet. Fleishacker of
j Menlo will be trying for records in the
shot and discus. He broke the shot
record last Saturday of the P. A. L.
when he tossed the weight 48 feet B*£
inches. This is two inches short of
! the mark of Weeks of Santa Rosa
[ made in 1916.
The discus record is 127 feet 1 3-8
| inches. Fleishacker has not done more
! than 120 this season, however.
I One of the best races of the day will
;be the duel between Earl Kenney of
! Alameda and Schmidt of San Jose in
j the 100-yard dash. Kenney won this
! event in the Alameda County meet
and has been doing :10 flat in almost
| every meet this year. Schmidt took
first place in this event in the Penin
| sula League meet. Wilson of Palo Alto
i High School has been a consistent
j performer this season and may give
j these stars a surprise. Garcia of Hol
: lister may also figure in this event.
The half-mile will be another close
race, with Lawshe of Palo Alto and
Qoggs of Menlo Park picked to lead
the field.
Caldwell of Santa Cruz High School,
holder of both State and North Coast
section records in the javelin throw,
will try to better his mark of 100 feet
6 inches.
Last Saturday the Alameda County
Athletic League held their annual
meet in the California oval which was
won by Berkeley High School. Ala
meda High School was second. At the
same time the Peninsula Athletic
League and the Coast Counties League
held their meets. The Peninsula meet
was won by San Jose High School,
Palo Alto second, and Menlo Park
third. I-lollister won the Coast meet
with Santa Cruz, Salinas, and Watson
ville finishing in the order named.
The times made in the Alameda
County meet were the best of the
three meets. Xlameda and Berkeley
are both sending teams that will make
a strong bid for first-place honors.
Alameda High School won the North
Coast section meet last year but has
lost several of her point-winners
through graduation. Berkeley is said
to have the strongest team in five
years and is confident of winning the
meet.
Hollister is also figured to be one of
the strongest contenders tomorrow.
They won the Coast Counties meet
last Saturday with a margin of seven
ty-seven points. Garcia of Hollister
runs the century in 10:1-5, puts the
shot around 46 feet, and has been
clocked in the low hurdles at 25:3-5.
This equals the North Coast record set
by "Swede" Leistner in 1921. If Garcia
can repeat his performances tomor
row Hollister stands a good chance of
finishing in the first section. Thorn
ton, also of Hollister, is a steady high
jumper at 5 feet 6 inches, and set a
new Coast Counties record of 17 flat in
the high hurdles last Saturday.

The half-mile will be another close
race, with Lawshe of Palo Alto and

Last Saturday the Alameda County
Athletic League held their annual
meet in the California oval which was
won by Berkeley High School. Ala
meda High School was second. At the
same time the Peninsula Athletic
League and the Coast Counties League
held their meets. The Peninsula meet
was won by San Jose High School,
Palo Alto second, and Menlo Park
third. I-lollister won the Coast meet
with Santa Cruz, Salinas, and Watson
ville finishing in the order named.
The times made in the Alameda
County meet were the best of the
three meets. Xlameda and Berkeley
are both sending teams that will make

Alameda High School won the North
Coast section meet last year but has
lost several of her point-winners
through graduation. Berkeley is said
to have the strongest team in five
years and is confident of winning the
meet.
Hollister is also figured to be one of
the strongest contenders tomorrow.
They won the Coast Counties meet
last Saturday with a margin of seven
ty-seven points. Garcia of Hollister
runs the century in 10:1-5, puts the
shot around 46 feet, and has been
clocked in the low hurdles at 25:3-5.
This equals the North Coast record set
by "Swede" Leistner in 1921. If Garcia
can repeat his performances tomor
row Hollister stands a good chance of
finishing in the first section. Thorn
ton, also of Hollister, is a steady high
jumper at 5 feet 6 inches, and set a
new Coast Counties record of 17 flat in
the high hurdles last Saturday.

San Jose High looms as a possible
victor by virtue of its overwhelming
victory in the Peninsula Athletic
League meet last Saturday on the old
track. Palo Alto, Berkeley, Menlo, and
Alameda will also be in the running
for honors.
Several athletes on the peninsula
have turned in outstanding records the
past few weeks. Hulsman of San Jose
does 12 feet 6 inches consistently in
the pole vault and should break the
old record of 12 feet. Fleishacker of
j Menlo will be trying for records in the
shot and discus. He broke the shot
record last Saturday of the P. A. L.
when he tossed the weight 48 feet B*£
inches. This is two inches short of
! the mark of Weeks of Santa Rosa
[ made in 1916.
The discus record is 127 feet 1 3-8
