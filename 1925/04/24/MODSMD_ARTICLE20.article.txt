# The
						Women Pay
## 
### 
Ordinarily, we take great pains to explain such terrific situations as
come up for comment, before editorializing; but the job of discovering
reason behind the sorority pledging regulations, which will be in force to
night, has us at a loss On top of this, the Daily has been asked to take a
hand in the fatuity by assuming the ticklish task of urging gentlemen to
remember their manners.
The gossip is that the fate of the sororities depends upon the conduct
of Stanford men tonight. Why this should be, some better logician will
have to outline, but it is true, nevertheless. Should there be any demon
stration whatsoever, it is darkly hinted that the displeasure of the powers
will incur and all women will be incarcerated in some place combining the
characteristics of a convent and a day nursery.
Appealing stories are retailed elaborating the anguish of the pathetic
lass whose heart was broken in the lawyer's office and subsequently
trampled upon by the thoughtless rooting section outside. So this step has
been taken to protect such unfortunate misses. If the men offend, the
women pay.
It is unnecessary to point out that no Stanford gentleman, however
hearty, contemplates participation in tonight's pledging. However non
sensical he may think the order, none will violate it and cause innocents to
suffer. For the sororities are innocent. Theirs was not the leading part
in making the rule.
Like it or not, the only decent thing to do is to refrain from causing
trouble for the women by not attending the festivities.
