# Leniency

The Men's Council is again the burden of the chanty. Having been
brought up sharply for a bit of mathematical calculation, we stand by to
clear the decks for polemics. Last night's Viewpoint harpooned us.
Nobody has denied that an additional fifteen hours means an additional
quarter in the University. And nobody quibbles over the $100 fee and
the $50 transportation expenses. Yet it does not seem clear to one. at
least, that the $200 cost of living at college represents the difference be
tween what one would be earning if he were not studying, and what he
does not earn during the extra ten weeks.
At least $350 is the size of the penalty as it might be translated into
money. This, we still maintain, is considerably different from $25 and a
night in jail, the police court punishment for intoxication.
It should be made clear that neither the present Men's Council nor any
individual action is aimed at. Since the beginning, Men's Councils have
been inflicting this penalty on Stanford students. The present council has
to be guided by precedent. We criticize this precedent.
In their difficult positions, the members must be consistent. It is dis
agreeable business, punishing fellow-students, as any one of them will
testify. A group of men more sincere than the present judges could not
be found. They deserve campus interest.
Without doubt, the addition of fifteen hours to a graduation require
ment is one of the most lenient punishments in the repertoire. Yet it is
too severe. The precedents should be scaled down. The purpose of dis
cussing the matter is to interest the campus in this situation so that the
council will be in no danger of losing respect should they accept this sug
gestion.
To earn five hours is a lot of work. At the same time, it is not so
much work that it cannot be taken care of in the course of a college career.
It is a punishment, yet not an excessive one. Five hours is more nearly
the propor proportion.
It is often argued that the custom of not publishing the names of of
fenders is advantageous. Of course it is, but it is extremely jllogical.
When the Daily does not publish the names of offenders, the wrongdoer
has a chance in a thousand that possibly one person on the campus will not
know all about it. Such is human curiosity.
The Men's Council is doing its l>est and getting very small thanks for
it. Any discussion which leads students to a better appreciation of its
position will meet with approval, one may be sure.

COACH HARRY WOLTER'S baseball team finds itself in a critical
position. Stanford and California tied the football game. Stanford lost
in basketball, won in track and lost in tennis. Should the ball nine come
through, the major sport record for 1924-25 will be tied—for the first
time in some years.
After the exhibition put up by the Card varsity last Saturday, the team
will doubtless have a record rooting section. They have made an excep
tional rally. They have the stuff to win.
Support them!

does not earn during the extra ten weeks.
At least $350 is the size of the penalty as it might be translated into
money. This, we still maintain, is considerably different from $25 and a
night in jail, the police court punishment for intoxication.
It should be made clear that neither the present Men's Council nor any
individual action is aimed at. Since the beginning, Men's Councils have
been inflicting this penalty on Stanford students. The present council has
to be guided by precedent. We criticize this precedent.
In their difficult positions, the members must be consistent. It is dis
agreeable business, punishing fellow-students, as any one of them will
testify. A group of men more sincere than the present judges could not
be found. They deserve campus interest.
Without doubt, the addition of fifteen hours to a graduation require
ment is one of the most lenient punishments in the repertoire. Yet it is
too severe. The precedents should be scaled down. The purpose of dis
cussing the matter is to interest the campus in this situation so that the
council will be in no danger of losing respect should they accept this sug
gestion.
To earn five hours is a lot of work. At the same time, it is not so
much work that it cannot be taken care of in the course of a college career.
It is a punishment, yet not an excessive one. Five hours is more nearly
the propor proportion.
It is often argued that the custom of not publishing the names of of
fenders is advantageous. Of course it is, but it is extremely jllogical.
When the Daily does not publish the names of offenders, the wrongdoer
has a chance in a thousand that possibly one person on the campus will not
know all about it. Such is human curiosity.
The Men's Council is doing its l>est and getting very small thanks for
it. Any discussion which leads students to a better appreciation of its
position will meet with approval, one may be sure.

COACH HARRY WOLTER'S baseball team finds itself in a critical
position. Stanford and California tied the football game. Stanford lost
in basketball, won in track and lost in tennis. Should the ball nine come
through, the major sport record for 1924-25 will be tied—for the first
time in some years.
After the exhibition put up by the Card varsity last Saturday, the team
will doubtless have a record rooting section. They have made an excep
tional rally. They have the stuff to win.
Support them!
The Men's Council is again the burden of the chanty. Having been
brought up sharply for a bit of mathematical calculation, we stand by to
clear the decks for polemics. Last night's Viewpoint harpooned us.
Nobody has denied that an additional fifteen hours means an additional
quarter in the University. And nobody quibbles over the $100 fee and
the $50 transportation expenses. Yet it does not seem clear to one. at
least, that the $200 cost of living at college represents the difference be
tween what one would be earning if he were not studying, and what he
does not earn during the extra ten weeks.
