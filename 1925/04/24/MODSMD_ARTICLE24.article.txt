"In the days of my youth my
father, Honest John McCubbin, was
wont to sit met on his knee and sing
to me little ditties —largely ditties
about father.
"The one that appealed to me most
strongly was called 'The Brewing
Hymn of the McCubbins.' It ran some
thing like this:
Honest John McCubbin
He went out to brew some beer.
Honest John McCubbin,
He drank his whiskey clear.
Honest John McCubbin,
He went out to brew some beer,
And when the still exploded
He was scattered far and near."
—Harp and Fiddle.
