## "GOLF WITHOUT TEARS" 
### P. G. Wodehouse 
Golf and human nature are cleverly
combined in this series of humorous
short stories. The old plots, P. G.
Wodehouse style, are neatly subordi
nated to the dominant idea of golf.
Plenty of laughs, and still more de
lighted grins lurk in the pages of the
book. The Oldest Member of the club
tells yarns which show the effects of
insignificant events like business deals
and love affairs on that all-important
thing, a man's game, and puts his
characters in deliciously ludicrous
positions. The lengths to which men
will go for the sake of golf are de
lightfully exaggerated, and the influ
ence of love on a man's attitude to
ward the game is treated in the same
way. The book is worth reading, espe
cially on a lazy afternoon when you
are in the mood to visualize with
pleasure green fields, grassy hills, and
knickered individuals struggling with
refractory balls out in the "rough."
