The Editor, Sir:
In yesterday's editorial, criticism
was made of the action taken by the
Men's Council in the case of a "cer
tain student" charged with conduct
while intoxicated which was unbecom
ing to a Stanford gentleman.
Comparison was made to action that
would be taken by regular authorities
had the culprit been arrested by them.
I fail to see a comparison in the two
cases mentioned.
If the disturber had been arrested
by the regular authorities he would
have been considered as a peace dis
turber and his conduct would not have
reflected on Stanford and its student
body. Put when the case is brought
before the Men's Council cognizance
must be taken of the fact that his
misbehavior not only brings reproach
on himself but also the Stanford Stu
dent Body, for unfortunately he is a
representative of that organization and
his conduct is judged not as an indi
vidual but as a member of that body.
In reports of the case he is mentioned,
not as "John Jones" but as a certain
student, and his action cannot help
but bring discredit to Stanford Uni
versity.
Individual cases of drunkenness
often are not considered seriously.
But, if the practice were indulged in
by • a considerable number this same
column in the good old D. P. A. which
now speaks in behalf of the offender,
undoubtedly would be filled with black
type demanding the removal of the
offenders to a place where their ac
tions would not be considered as those
of Stanford Students. Does it make
the offense any less serious because
it is indulged in by a few instead of
many? I think not. The punishment
imposed by the Men's Council is not
to be considered as a price that one
can pay for the Privilege of becoming
intoxicated, but rather to deter others
from so conducting themselves.
I have only words of commendation
for the Men's Council and its judgment
in such cases.

I am not in accord with all the pro
visions ot' the eighteenth amendment
nor the actions of those enforcing it,
but as long as it remains a law I be
lieve it the duty of every Stanford
Student to support it and to look with
disfavor on anyone violating it, espe
cially when the violator is considered
as a Stanford Student.
Sincerely, Harry W. Call, '28.

The Editor, Sir:
In yesterday's editorial, criticism
was made of the action taken by the
Men's Council in the case of a "cer
tain student" charged with conduct
while intoxicated which was unbecom
ing to a Stanford gentleman.
Comparison was made to action that
would be taken by regular authorities
had the culprit been arrested by them.
I fail to see a comparison in the two
cases mentioned.
If the disturber had been arrested
by the regular authorities he would
have been considered as a peace dis
turber and his conduct would not have
reflected on Stanford and its student
body. Put when the case is brought
before the Men's Council cognizance
must be taken of the fact that his
misbehavior not only brings reproach
on himself but also the Stanford Stu
dent Body, for unfortunately he is a
representative of that organization and
his conduct is judged not as an indi
vidual but as a member of that body.
In reports of the case he is mentioned,
not as "John Jones" but as a certain
student, and his action cannot help
but bring discredit to Stanford Uni
versity.
Individual cases of drunkenness
often are not considered seriously.
But, if the practice were indulged in
by • a considerable number this same
column in the good old D. P. A. which
now speaks in behalf of the offender,
undoubtedly would be filled with black
type demanding the removal of the
offenders to a place where their ac
tions would not be considered as those
of Stanford Students. Does it make
the offense any less serious because
it is indulged in by a few instead of
many? I think not. The punishment
imposed by the Men's Council is not
to be considered as a price that one
can pay for the Privilege of becoming
intoxicated, but rather to deter others
from so conducting themselves.
I have only words of commendation
for the Men's Council and its judgment
in such cases.

I am not in accord with all the pro
visions ot' the eighteenth amendment
nor the actions of those enforcing it,
but as long as it remains a law I be
lieve it the duty of every Stanford
Student to support it and to look with
disfavor on anyone violating it, espe
cially when the violator is considered
as a Stanford Student.
Sincerely, Harry W. Call, '28.

In a recent yell contribution contest
held at the University of Southern
California none of the 300' yells turned j
