# STANFORD WATER POLO TEAM LOSES TO C. A. A., 4-0
## 
### 
Stanford's hopes of a national title
in the water polo event in the A. A. U. 1
meet were blasted yesterday by a 4
to 0 defeat at the hands of the Chicago
Athletic Club. The Cardinals will have
a chance to get three points out of
the meet by defeating the I. A. C.
team today.
Ragged playing and the appearance j
of staleness marked the Stanford
men's playing. The Cardinals started '
out well but could not keep going. Col
lett seemed off color at the goal guard j
position, but Myers at forward played !
the best game he has this year.
The score at half time was 1-0 in
favor of Chicago. Early in the second j
half Myers put through a goal just as !
the whistle for Luster's foul sounded,;
and the point didn't count. The East-!
erners held a tight defense while Todd,'
their forward, slipped down for trys :
at goal.
A batting game, different from the,
style generally confronted on the I
coast, bewildered the Stanford seven. ;
Williams, playing against the main
man of the C. A. A. offense, experi- j
enced difficulty in coping with this
style of play.
The lineup used by Brandsten yes-!
terday was Carson, Myers, Luster, for- j
wards; McCallister, Allen, Williams,
backs; Collett, goal guard.
The Olympic Club's 2-1 win over the
crack I. A. C. team was expected be
cause two of the regular Illinois men,
Grondona and Towne, were out of the
game on account of injuries.
The Chicago Athletic Association
and the Olympic Club will play tomor
row for the national title and fifteen
points in the regular A. A. U. meet.
Second and third places in the water
polo event get nine and three points !
respectively.
