# Juniors Have Pavilion Floor Polished for Ball
## 
### 
The Pavilion floor has been sand
papered and polished for the Masque
Ball and the Junior Prom through the
efforts of P. T. Meyers, general chair
man of the Junior Prom, and H. L.
Edmondson, chairman of the floor
committee.
Meyers and Edmondson succeeded
in getting the Board of Athletic Con
trol to pay for half of the $200 which
was necessary for the work and then
collected the remainder of the amount
from the Masque Ball committee, Jun
ior Class, Alumni secretary, and the
Sophomore Class.
