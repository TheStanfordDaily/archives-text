# "Dark Horse" Leading In Race for Crown
## 
### 
A "dark horse" appeared in the
race for King of the Masque Ball
today when John Graves was nomi
nated this morning and by noon had
piled up 2000 votes and a margin
of a scant 60i votes over his nearest
opponent, L. M. Enos. H. L. Noland
and J. H. Sickler are running a
neck-and-neck race in third place.
So close together are the two lead
ing candidates that the election of
King will probably remain unde
cided until the very last minute.
The polls close at 3 o'clock this
afternoon.
The standing of the candidates at
noon today was:
John Graves 2000
L. M. Enos 1940
H. L. Noland 1330
J. H. Sickler 1300
C. C. Simons ...1130
F. F. Solomon 1050
