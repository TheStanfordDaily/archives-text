# CHILDREN, MONARCH PLAY TOGETHER AT 1925 MASQUE BALL
## 
### M. D. Eaton 
The pavilion will scintillate with
life, color, and gaiety tomorrow night
when the doors are opened for Stan
ford's Annual Masque Ball. Prince and
pauper, clown and wise man, vampire
and wall flower will dance side by side,
their costumes blending to enliven the
playground with a medley of colors.
The rally committee is endeavoring
to make the Masque Ball as informal
as possible. In the surroundings of a
children's playground, everyone should
forget that they are grown-ups bound
by stiff rules of decorum; and, return
ing to their childhood, have a really
good time.
The pavilion floor is being sand
papered and polished at a cost of over
$200, and it will be in excellent condi
tion. Dancers need no longer worry
about getting their shoes dirty or trip
ping over the rough places.
There will be vaudeville entertain
ment and stunts between each dance.
W. R. Wilson and L. T. Brown will
present a song and dance number, and
Helen Stewart and Kate Clemens are
working out the other two vaudeville
acts. Besides, there will be several
stunts including the marble-shooting
championship and the child-chariot
race. If the entertainment is not
enough to keep everyone amused there
will be plenty of see-saws, swings, and
slides to while away the idle minutes.
F. I). Mannoccir will officially crown
the elected king and his chosen queen.
L. T. Brown will be floor manager and
"Hack" Sickler will be court jester
whether he is elected king or not.
Because it will take place on a Sat
urday night, the Masque Ball will be
gin at 8:30 and end equally as prompt
ly at 12. Sunday will begin at 12:01,
giving Elizalde and his eight-piece or
chestra one minute to stop playing.
Costumes are now on display in the
pavilion and will continue to be on
display until 8 o'clock this evening.
The costume booth will also be open
from 10 to 12 o'clock and 1 to 3 to
morrow. Those desiring to come to
dance must purchase tickets at the
Bookstore for one dollar and fifty
cents; anyone without the necessary
admission fee will be admitted as a
rough after the dance has started.

ford's Annual Masque Ball. Prince and
pauper, clown and wise man, vampire
and wall flower will dance side by side,
their costumes blending to enliven the
playground with a medley of colors.
The rally committee is endeavoring
to make the Masque Ball as informal
as possible. In the surroundings of a
children's playground, everyone should
forget that they are grown-ups bound
by stiff rules of decorum; and, return
ing to their childhood, have a really
good time.
The pavilion floor is being sand
papered and polished at a cost of over
$200, and it will be in excellent condi
tion. Dancers need no longer worry
about getting their shoes dirty or trip
ping over the rough places.
There will be vaudeville entertain
ment and stunts between each dance.
W. R. Wilson and L. T. Brown will
present a song and dance number, and
Helen Stewart and Kate Clemens are
working out the other two vaudeville
acts. Besides, there will be several
stunts including the marble-shooting
championship and the child-chariot
race. If the entertainment is not
enough to keep everyone amused there
will be plenty of see-saws, swings, and
slides to while away the idle minutes.
F. I). Mannoccir will officially crown
the elected king and his chosen queen.
L. T. Brown will be floor manager and
"Hack" Sickler will be court jester
whether he is elected king or not.
Because it will take place on a Sat
urday night, the Masque Ball will be
gin at 8:30 and end equally as prompt
ly at 12. Sunday will begin at 12:01,
giving Elizalde and his eight-piece or
chestra one minute to stop playing.
Costumes are now on display in the
pavilion and will continue to be on
display until 8 o'clock this evening.
The costume booth will also be open
from 10 to 12 o'clock and 1 to 3 to
morrow. Those desiring to come to
dance must purchase tickets at the
Bookstore for one dollar and fifty
cents; anyone without the necessary
admission fee will be admitted as a
rough after the dance has started.
