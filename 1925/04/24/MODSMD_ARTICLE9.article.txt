# CALIFORNIA-STANFORD NINES IN FINAL GAME
## Tomorrow's Diamond Contest Ends Year's Athletic Program of Rival Universities 
### 
lI7ITH more than the mere winning of a series at stake, the Stanford varsity
baseball team will meet the California nine on the varsity diamond at
3:45 o'clock tomorrow afternoon in the third and final game of the annual
competition. If the Stanford players can show the same prowess they ex
hibited last week it will mean that for the first time in a number of years
the season's victories in the major sports will be equally divided between
the two rival institutions.
Last week's game provided a real thrill for the spectators, for the Cardinals
were conceded little chance of winning after the 27-to-5 beating they had
taken in the first contest. However, a ninth-inning rally, such as one reads
about in books, accomplished the trick, and the final score stood 4 to 3 in
favor of the Redshirts.
California's indecision in regard to the playing of the final game may
somewhat have lessened Stanford's chances for victory tomorrow for with
the announcement from Berkeley that the game had been postponed Wolter's

$>men ceased training. Intesive prac
| tice yesterday and this afternoon
should materially aid in overcoming
I the handicap caused by the interrup
| tion.
On the basis of the showing he
last week Nevers will be Wolter's first
I choice for twirler with Nounan start
ing on the mound for California.
The Cardinal batsmen hit their
stride for the first time this season
last week. Previously hits had been
few and far between. Somewhat a
parallel condition existed last year
j when the Cards, after going through a
mediocre preliminary season, upset
the dope and took the series from the
I Blue and Gold.
