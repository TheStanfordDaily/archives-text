Architects
"Designing in Masses"
THE new architecture transcends detail and expresses
the component solids of the great buildings of today
and tomorrow. Gigantic profiles are reared against the
sky — true expression of structural facts has now come
into its own in architectural design, linking architect and
engineer ever more closely together.
Certainly modern invention — modern engineering skill
and organization, will prove more than equal to the
s demands of the architeaure of the future.
