### Harry Bennett 
Ernest Nevers, for the second time in us many years, pitched his way
successfully through the Stanford-California baseball series, when he won
the game last Saturday practically single-handed, with a score of 8 to 4.
Not only did he pitch an excellent game but lie scored two and knocked in
four more of the Cardinal runs. The third inning reads like a fairy tale for
him, for with three men on bases he stepped up to bat, let the umpire call
two strikes and three balls on him and then pounded out the homer that
scored the four winning runs.
In the same inning Johnston was safe on an error. McCandless pounded

out a three-bagger, scoring Johnston*
and making a total of five runs for
that inning.
California opened the game looking
like a sure winner. Sears, the first
man at bat, knocked out a single and
went home when Dixon tripled. A dou
ble to center field by Smith brought>
Dixon home. For a moment Nevers
was in a bad way, but the next two
men fanned, letting California have
but two runs for the first inning. Stan
ford retired In the first inning without
a hit.
The second inning Stanford came
back, scoring three runs. With Law-j
son on first, Nevers doubled to let
him score, a few moments later going
home when Roberts knocked a two
"bagger. Roberts scored on an error.
In the fourth inning Llyond doubled
to right and went to third ,on the
throw-in. Tate singled and the Bruin
score went up when Lloynd crossed
home. The other Bear run came in
the fifth inning when Smith, who had '
singled, romped home on an error.
Captain Johnston took heavy-liitting
honors for the day by smashing out
three hits in four trips to the plate.
The other time he was safe at first on
an error. Mulchay played a brilliant
game at short for the Cards, starring
on several occasions~with excellent
catches.
