# Victory!
## 
### 
Figuring in the freshman sport results, Stanford's athletic relations
with California during thq past season have left the balance of victory in
favor of the Cardinal.
On the football tally we have a coast championship and a tie with the
Bears, as well as a freshman victory to our credit. The 1928 class won in
basketball although the varsity lost, but in track, both squads cleaned up
for Stanford. Both tennis matches went to the Berkleyans and the fresh
men won in baseball. And while baseball is the topic, consider last Satur
day.
After listening to the Blue and Gold rooting .section, even an illiterate
could have told that California made twenty-seven runs while winning the
first game of the series, providing, of course, that the illiterate arrived at
the last game before the fourth inning in time to hear the Bruin bellow.
In a hard and courageously fought contest, the varsity came up from be
hind and won the second game by a close margin. With the predictions
against them, having broken training, the team entered the game Saturday.
How Nevers steadied down after a bad first inning and how the rest of
the players responded with perfect support, is by this time a well-worn
yarn. But his home run with the bases full, two out, and two strikes and
three balls, will always inspire a thrill when recalled.
The story of this year's baseball series is similar to Stanford's sport
history for the last few years. After the war things went to the dogs ath
letically. For six years the battle has been fought to establish the super
iority of the Cardinal. This year has been the best.
Just as the varsity came up from behind to win the baseball series, so
the march of Stanford athletics has been. This year we have the edge.
Next year should make it decisive.
APPRECIATION FOR THE COOPERATION of the men during
the recent women's pledging activities has been expressed by the sororities.
There has been no complaint as a result of an ungentlemanly demonstra
tion, but, instead, only praise for the self-restraint of the roughs.
A satisfactory precedent has been established, it appears.
COMMENDATION IS DUE the track team for its action in reviving
the custom of granting the Aupperle Medal to the most valuable man on
the track team. Aupperle, an ardent athlete, never won a first place for
Stanford in a Big Meet, yet he was chosen captain of the squad. Such
was the personality of this man who afterward gave up his life in Serbia
aiding the Red Cross during the war.
A medal commemorating such a character is fittingly conferred upon
Allan Charles.

INCIDENTAL FEES WILL STILL be $21 for some time. Addi-1
tional expense incurred in making improvements and additions to the
basketball pavilion which were uncontemplated at first but later approved
by the Executive Committee, has%iade it necessary and proper that the!
extra dollar tax be retained.
There is a prospect of universal woe as a result. It is not so much that
the students are downcast at the necessity of continuing to pay, but that
the pavilion must still be paid for. Practically every promoter on the cam
pus has figured out a way to use that dollar for one interest or another.
And so practically everybody feels badly.
