# CABBAGES and THINGS
## APOLOGIES 
### Steve O'Donnell 
Certain persons, thought to be ene
mies of the Cabbage Column, have
prevented the fulfillment of our prize
contest plan.
Much as Cabbages wanted to see
someone get the shoe, these unidenti
fied persons, by changing the time
and place of bidding, have rendered
this impossible. For those young men
who wished so badly to win the prize
we have nothing but sympathy, and
can only hope that sometime they may
get their just dues through some other
medium.
