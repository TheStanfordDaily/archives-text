# BEAR TENNIS TEAM WILL INVADE EAST
## 
### 
Four University of California varsity
tennis players will enter the national
intercollegiate tennis tournament to
be held in Philadelphia on JunÂ« 25.
The four Bear net men who will
travel East are Captain E. G. Chan
dler, P. A. Bettens, Gervais Hillis, and
G. D. Stratford. Stow was elected al
ternate in case anyone of the four
were unable to make the trip.
California recently defeated Stan
ford by a small margin in close
matches. Chandler, their best man,
was defeated by C. W. Holman of the
Cardinal squad.
A possible invasion of England has
been proposed by more enthusiastic
followers of the Bear tennis squad,
and the showing made by them in the
nationals will probably determine to a
large extent whether or not the trip
will be made.

Joie Ray, one of America's premier
distance runners, will appear in the
Washington stadium on May 9, and ef
forts are being made to secure Paavo
Nurmi, the Finnish world champion dis
tance man, for the same date. The An
nual Relay Carnival will be given at the
University stadium on that day.

A matrimonial agency has been estab
lished at Ottaway University. Two girls
in the sophomore class guarantee any
body a date for twenty-five cents.
