announces that the food will be good, J
and that a five-picce orchestra has al- !
rejidy been engaged.

A great deal of criticism has been i
placed against the student body at
Columbia University because of lack
of interest in student elections. Less
than a third of the students havo
registered for the spring elections and
not enough nominations have been re
ceived to fill all the vacant offices. Not
a single nomination as appeared for '
any of the six positions to be filled in
the senior class.
