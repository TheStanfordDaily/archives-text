Coming to town! Coming to town!
Big four ring circus, with two per
formances, rain or shine!
The A1 G. Barnes circus, arriving
in Palo Alto for a matinee and evening
performance tomorrow, is an event
scheduled to entice roughs and girls
alike. Men who want a pass to the
big show are invited to go down to
help put up the tent and water the
elephants. Girls will have to use the
regular method to get their tickets.
Because of the huge number of ani
mals no parade can be held. The
manager hates to hurt the feelings of
those who would have to be left out.
Pocahontas at the court of England,
a colorful historical pageant, assisted
by real Indians, will be only one of
the many thrilling features.
Peanuts, pink lemonade, and all the
usual what-nots, combined with aes
thetic hay-fever victims, promise to
make this the really big event of the j
year.

A race for "Campus Fords" is being
held by the University of Oregon. There
are three events listed, a four-mile race
for touring cars and roadsters, a two
mile race for bugs, and a one-mile free
for-all. Prizes will be awarded to the
winners, and spectators will have to pay
a nominal fee.
