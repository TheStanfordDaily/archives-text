# Bishop Thomas Will Talk About Indians
## 
### 
"The American Indian," is the general
j subject of the lecture to be given tomor
row night in the Little Theatre at 7 :30,
by Bishop Nathaniel S. Thomas, who will
speak especially about "A Social Experi
ment with the Arapahoe and Shoshone
Indians."
Bishop Thomas will sketch briefly the
history of the treatment of the American
Indians by the United States government
and by the church. He will point out
some of the errors that have been a funda
mental cause ofrtrouble in this connection.
One of the most difficult questions that
confronts the Indian service worker is
the problem of reversal to type. The
problem of the Indian is not the school
but what envelopes and follows the school.
"It is the lack of the background which
is largely responsible for the inevitable re
versal to type which has made all Indian
effort appear so little worth while," says
Bishop Thomas.
