## 
### A. M. Espinosa, Jr 
Heavy hitting featured the concluding
games of the third round of the intra- i
mural baseball series Friday, in which!
Sequoia trounced Encina 2nd, 22 to 7, and
Breakers downed Encina 3rd, 10 to 0.
Kappa Sigma took its third straight game :
by a default' from Zeta Psi, while Alpha 1
Sigma Phi won from the Independents j
by forfeit.
Breakers took its third victory in as |
many games by swamping the freshmenl
in the fifth inning. Previously, one run j
in the first, second and third frames, had
piled up a safe lead, but six hits in the
fifth broke up the ball game, and with
Breakers ten runs ahead, the game was
called.
Pabst, the freshman hurler, pitched for I
four innings against the hard hitting j
Breakers, but in the fifth he was relieved
by Christ, who proved just as easy. ;
Meiklejohn, for Breakers, allowed but
five hits, and his support was so perfect |
that three bunched singles in the fourth j
failed to bring in a freshman runner.
Breakers are now tied with El Tigre I
for the lead in League 111, each having j
won one game and lost none. They tangle
for the plaque Wednesday.
Easy for Sequoia
Sequoia held a batting practice at the
expense of two freshman pitchers to de
feat Encina 2nd. Every man on tbe Se- j
quoia nine made at least one trip to the
plate in the first inning in which Sequoia
piled up an eight run lead. Four more
followed in the second, and by the seventh,
22 Sequoia runners had crossed the plate.
for Sequoia pitched a fair game,;
but he was not forced to bear down to any |
great extent. Sequoia fieding was good, '
especially the outfielding. The freshmen j
fielding was also fair, the Sequoia hits all !
being clean.
Sequoia is now tied with Kappa Sigma,
university champions last year, for the
leadership in League IV. They meet for |
the championship of the league on May 5.
Sequoia's 22 to 5 victory over Encina 2nd
compares more than favorably with the
Kappa Sig's win over the same team in a
ragged game, 8 to 5.
Games tomorrow, with the probable
winners named first, are: Sigma Chi vs.
Phi Kappa Psi; Phi Sigma Kappa vs.
Sigma Nu; Branner vs. Phi Delta Theta;
Thcta Delta Chi vs. Union.

games of the third round of the intra- i
mural baseball series Friday, in which!
Sequoia trounced Encina 2nd, 22 to 7, and
Breakers downed Encina 3rd, 10 to 0.
Kappa Sigma took its third straight game :
by a default' from Zeta Psi, while Alpha 1
Sigma Phi won from the Independents j
by forfeit.
Breakers took its third victory in as |
many games by swamping the freshmenl
in the fifth inning. Previously, one run j
in the first, second and third frames, had
piled up a safe lead, but six hits in the
fifth broke up the ball game, and with
Breakers ten runs ahead, the game was
called.
Pabst, the freshman hurler, pitched for I
four innings against the hard hitting j
Breakers, but in the fifth he was relieved
by Christ, who proved just as easy. ;
Meiklejohn, for Breakers, allowed but
five hits, and his support was so perfect |
that three bunched singles in the fourth j
failed to bring in a freshman runner.
Breakers are now tied with El Tigre I
for the lead in League 111, each having j
won one game and lost none. They tangle
for the plaque Wednesday.
Easy for Sequoia
Sequoia held a batting practice at the
expense of two freshman pitchers to de
feat Encina 2nd. Every man on tbe Se- j
quoia nine made at least one trip to the
plate in the first inning in which Sequoia
piled up an eight run lead. Four more
followed in the second, and by the seventh,
22 Sequoia runners had crossed the plate.
for Sequoia pitched a fair game,;
but he was not forced to bear down to any |
great extent. Sequoia fieding was good, '
especially the outfielding. The freshmen j
fielding was also fair, the Sequoia hits all !
being clean.
Sequoia is now tied with Kappa Sigma,
university champions last year, for the
leadership in League IV. They meet for |
the championship of the league on May 5.
Sequoia's 22 to 5 victory over Encina 2nd
compares more than favorably with the
Kappa Sig's win over the same team in a
ragged game, 8 to 5.
Games tomorrow, with the probable
winners named first, are: Sigma Chi vs.
Phi Kappa Psi; Phi Sigma Kappa vs.
Sigma Nu; Branner vs. Phi Delta Theta;
Thcta Delta Chi vs. Union.
