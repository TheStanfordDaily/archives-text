# SEQUOIA, BREAKERS WIN THIRD STRAIGHT INTRAMURAL GAMES
## 
### A. M. Espinosa, Jr 
Heavy hitting featured the concluding
games of the third round of the intra-
mural baseball series Friday, in which
Sequoia trounced Encina 2nd, 22 to 7, and
Breakers downed Encina 3rd, 10 to 0.
Kappa Sigma took its third straight game
by a default from Zeta Psi, while Alpha
Sigma Phi won from the Independents
by forfeit.
Breakers took its third victory in as
many games by swamping the freshmen
in the fifth inning. Previously, one run
in the first, second and third frames, had
piled up a safe lead, but six hits in the
fifth broke up the ball game, and with
Breakers ten runs ahead, the game was
called.
Pabst, the freshman hurler, pitched for
four innings against the hard hitting
Breakers, but in the fifth he was relieved
by Christ, who proved just as easy.
Meiklejohn, for Breakers, allowed but
five hits, and his support was so perfect
that three bunched singles in the fourth
failed to bring in a freshman runner.
Breakers are now tied with El Tigre
for the lead in League III, each having
won one game and lost none. They tangle
for the plaque Wednesday.
Easy for Sequoia
Sequoia held a batting practice at the
expense of two freshman pitchers to de
feat Encina 2nd. Every man on the Se-
quoia nine made at least one trip to the
plate in the first inning in which Sequoia
piled up an eight run lead. Four more
followed in the second, and by the seventh,
22 Sequoia runners had crossed the plate.
Prior for Sequoia pitched a fair game,
but he was not forced to bear down to any
great extent. Sequoia fielding was good,
especially the outfielding. The freshmen
fielding was also fair, the Sequoia hits all
being clean.
Sequoia is now tied with Kappa Sigma,
university champions last year, for the
leadership in League IV. They meet for
the championship of the league on May 5.
Sequoia's 22 to 5 victory over Encina 2nd
compares more than favorably with the
Kappa Sig's win over the same team in a
ragged game, 8 to 5.
Games tomorrow, with the probable
winners named first, are: Sigma Chi vs.
Phi Kappa Psi; Phi Sigma Kappa vs.
Sigma Nu; Branner vs. Phi Delta Theta;
Theta Delta Chi vs. Union.

22 Sequoia runners had crossed the plate.
Prior for Sequoia pitched a fair game,
but he was not forced to bear down to any
great extent. Sequoia fielding was good,
especially the outfielding. The freshmen
fielding was also fair, the Sequoia hits all
being clean.
Sequoia is now tied with Kappa Sigma,
university champions last year, for the
leadership in League IV. They meet for
the championship of the league on May 5.
Sequoia's 22 to 5 victory over Encina 2nd
compares more than favorably with the
Kappa Sig's win over the same team in a
ragged game, 8 to 5.
Games tomorrow, with the probable
winners named first, are: Sigma Chi vs.
Phi Kappa Psi; Phi Sigma Kappa vs.
Sigma Nu; Branner vs. Phi Delta Theta;
Theta Delta Chi vs. Union.
Heavy hitting featured the concluding
games of the third round of the intra-
mural baseball series Friday, in which
Sequoia trounced Encina 2nd, 22 to 7, and
Breakers downed Encina 3rd, 10 to 0.
Kappa Sigma took its third straight game
by a default from Zeta Psi, while Alpha
Sigma Phi won from the Independents
by forfeit.
Breakers took its third victory in as
many games by swamping the freshmen
in the fifth inning. Previously, one run
in the first, second and third frames, had
piled up a safe lead, but six hits in the
fifth broke up the ball game, and with
Breakers ten runs ahead, the game was
called.
Pabst, the freshman hurler, pitched for
four innings against the hard hitting
Breakers, but in the fifth he was relieved
by Christ, who proved just as easy.
Meiklejohn, for Breakers, allowed but
five hits, and his support was so perfect
that three bunched singles in the fourth
failed to bring in a freshman runner.
Breakers are now tied with El Tigre
for the lead in League III, each having
won one game and lost none. They tangle
for the plaque Wednesday.
Easy for Sequoia
Sequoia held a batting practice at the
expense of two freshman pitchers to de
feat Encina 2nd. Every man on the Se-
quoia nine made at least one trip to the
plate in the first inning in which Sequoia
piled up an eight run lead. Four more
followed in the second, and by the seventh,
22 Sequoia runners had crossed the plate.
