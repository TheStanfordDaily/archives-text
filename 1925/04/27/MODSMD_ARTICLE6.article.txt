# RALLY COMMITTEE PROVIDES SPECIAL FEATURES AT BALL
## Sickler, Mason Are Crowned As King and Queen for Evening's Frolic 
### M. D. Eaton 
The 1925 Masque Ball more than ful-
I filled all expectations by turning out to be
I one of the gayest and most informal
campus dances of the year. Brilliant cos
| tumes, soft lights, entrancing music, with
I a spirit of good-fellowship and reckless
i frivolity made the pavilion a dazzling
, scene of joyousness. What the Rally
| Committee left undone towards turning
it into a children's playground with the
swings, see-saws and slides, the dancers
| finished by playing catch, leap-frog, and
snap-the-whip. Everyone was "just kids"
i in every sense of the word.
J. H. Sickler and Rowcna Mason were
I crowned King and Queen of the Masque
j Ball by F. D. Mannoccir amidst wild
I cheering and enthusiastic applause. Five
' minutes before the polls closed last Fri
: day, Sickler came from behind to defeat
! John Graves in a whirlwind finish, that
; left the supposed dark horse of the race
: nearly a thousand votes behind. Sickler
| polled 8000 votes and Graves approxi
mately 7000.
Lafe Brown played the double role of
court jester and floor manager. What'
| with making announcements, amusing the
king, and arranging the kiddie-kar race
and marble shooting contest, he was the
busiest person on the floor.
Something approaching a battle between
the roughs and those on the floor followed
the handing out, as favors, of hollow rub
ber balls. But the music of Elizalde's or
chestra finally soothed the fierceness of
the combat.
Two swings hung from the high girders
of the pavilion, took many people back to
their younger days. The only disappoint
ment of the evening was the fact that no j
one attempted to dive from the spring-1
board, which was on a tower about twenty j
feet above the floor, into the bathtub be
low, which had no water in it.
The entertainment was decidedly a sue- j
cess. Dorothy Dahler sang "Why i
Couldri"t It Be Poor Little Me," and was
encored enthusiastically. Helen Stewart
and Kate Clemans gave an interpretative
dance that was artistically beautiful. The
third number was a group dance inter
preting the popular song "Oh Katherina."
The chairmen of the committees in j
charge of the dance were, L. H. Peter, J.
R. White, E. L. Barnett, J. T. DeFrees,
and E. E.-Wells.

board, which was on a tower about twenty j
feet above the floor, into the bathtub be
low, which had no water in it.
The entertainment was decidedly a sue- j
cess. Dorothy Dahler sang "Why i
Couldri"t It Be Poor Little Me," and was
encored enthusiastically. Helen Stewart
and Kate Clemans gave an interpretative
dance that was artistically beautiful. The
third number was a group dance inter
preting the popular song "Oh Katherina."
The chairmen of the committees in j
charge of the dance were, L. H. Peter, J.
R. White, E. L. Barnett, J. T. DeFrees,
and E. E.-Wells.
The 1925 Masque Ball more than ful-
I filled all expectations by turning out to be
I one of the gayest and most informal
campus dances of the year. Brilliant cos
| tumes, soft lights, entrancing music, with
I a spirit of good-fellowship and reckless
i frivolity made the pavilion a dazzling
, scene of joyousness. What the Rally
| Committee left undone towards turning
it into a children's playground with the
swings, see-saws and slides, the dancers
| finished by playing catch, leap-frog, and
snap-the-whip. Everyone was "just kids"
i in every sense of the word.
J. H. Sickler and Rowcna Mason were
I crowned King and Queen of the Masque
j Ball by F. D. Mannoccir amidst wild
I cheering and enthusiastic applause. Five
' minutes before the polls closed last Fri
: day, Sickler came from behind to defeat
! John Graves in a whirlwind finish, that
; left the supposed dark horse of the race
: nearly a thousand votes behind. Sickler
| polled 8000 votes and Graves approxi
mately 7000.
Lafe Brown played the double role of
court jester and floor manager. What'
| with making announcements, amusing the
king, and arranging the kiddie-kar race
and marble shooting contest, he was the
busiest person on the floor.
Something approaching a battle between
the roughs and those on the floor followed
the handing out, as favors, of hollow rub
ber balls. But the music of Elizalde's or
chestra finally soothed the fierceness of
the combat.
Two swings hung from the high girders
of the pavilion, took many people back to
their younger days. The only disappoint
ment of the evening was the fact that no j
one attempted to dive from the spring-1
board, which was on a tower about twenty j
feet above the floor, into the bathtub be
low, which had no water in it.
