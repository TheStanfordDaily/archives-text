# GRADUATE STUDENT DROWNED IN LAKE WHILE SWIMMING
## Body of W. F. Vaniman Found By Professional Diver After Long Search 
### 
Tragedy threw its pall over Lagunita
] when Wilbur F. Vaniman, graduate
student of Biology, registered from
McPherson, Kansas, was drowned at
3:30 yesterday afternoon in the sight
of over five hundred people. The body
was not recovered until 1:15 o'clock
this morning.
Swimming towards the boathouse
from the second float, Vaniman sud
! denly disappeared from view with the
words, "Frank, help," which were
barely audible to his friend, Frank P.
Isensee, who had remained oh the
float. Frantic efforts on the part of
bathers and canoeists to reach the
spot where Vaniman went down were
of no avail, for despite attempts by
divers and the use of boathooks and
grappling irons, the body could not
be located.
F. W. Frehe was immediately called
and put in charge j)t the rescue work,
but the catastrophe occurred in six
teen feet of water, and the hooks and
irons had stirred up the sediment on
the bottom to such a degree that it
was impossible for the divers to ac
complish anything. Aeroplanes oper
ated by Joe Toft of Palo Alto and
Art Ayres of San Carlos flew over i
the lake but the pilots were unable to
see through the muddy water.
Professional Diver Secured
Frehe halted student attempts to
recover the body at 8:15 last night,
and sent to San Francisco for a pro-1
fessional diver. Jack Whitelaw, diver
for the Union Iron Works, was se- j
>; cured by Roy H. Button, and reached
Lagunita at 11:30. The diving appar
atus, consisting of air pump and signal
! lines, was put on the float anchored
' near the Roble side of the lake, and
1 rowboats it to the scene of the
catastrophe. Whitelaw searched the
bottom of the lake for almost two
hours, and finally, at 1:15, he came
up to report that he had found the
'; body.
Two theories have been advanced as
to the cause for his drowning. One is
that he was suddenly seized with
! cramps and the attack was so severe
that he did not come up after going
down the first time, and the other is
that the cold water affected his heart,
■ causing it to cease functioning. When
I the body was recovered from the
| water, the hands were tightly clasped
I against the stomach, seeming to prove
j the theory of cramps.
George B. Culver, Dean of Men, tele
graphed news of the tragedy to Vani
man's parents last night, and the body
will be held at the Roller and Hap
j good undertaking parlors until word
j is received from them. An ambulance
! took the remains to Palo Alto imme-
I diately after the body was taken from
i the water.
! Twenty student volunteers assisted
in the search, and automobile head
; lights were focused on the expanse
of water between the second float and :
the boathouse until the body was
found. Ernst Brandsten and his force
of life guards worked under the direc
tion of Whitelaw, towing the diving j
apparatus and pumping air to him as
he searched the bottom.
Roscoe C. Ingalls, brother-in-law of !
Vaniman, is coming up from his home
in Alhambra, and the coroner's inquest
will probably be held tomorrow after
noon.
Vaniman had applied for an assist
antship in the Biology department, and
because of his excellent work along j
that line, had every reason to believe j
that he would receive it.
Vaniman received his A.B. degree j
at McPherson Coirege, McPherson, i
McPherson, Kansas, in 1918, and made [
an excellent record there. In 1919-20 j
he attended the graduate School of i
Theology, Oberlin College, Oberlin,
Ohio, and during 1919-21 he was teach
ing at the McPherson Senior and Jun
ior High School. From 1921-24 Vani- j
man was principal of the Junior High ;
School there, teaching physical geogra-1
phy. While at Stanford he had made
an excellent scholastic record.
Vaniman was twenty-eight years I
old, and lived at 851 University avenue
in Palo Alto.

women of the University of North Da
kota will appear in the university's an

women were sent to James Montgomery
Flagg, famous magazine illustrator, who
will make the choice. Beauty of form
as well as beauty of face will be con
sidered. In order to do this full length
pictures were taken.

Tragedy threw its pall over Lagunita
] when Wilbur F. Vaniman, graduate
student of Biology, registered from
McPherson, Kansas, was drowned at
3:30 yesterday afternoon in the sight
of over five hundred people. The body
was not recovered until 1:15 o'clock
this morning.
Swimming towards the boathouse
from the second float, Vaniman sud
! denly disappeared from view with the
words, "Frank, help," which were
barely audible to his friend, Frank P.
Isensee, who had remained oh the
float. Frantic efforts on the part of
bathers and canoeists to reach the
spot where Vaniman went down were
of no avail, for despite attempts by
divers and the use of boathooks and
grappling irons, the body could not
be located.
F. W. Frehe was immediately called
and put in charge j)t the rescue work,
but the catastrophe occurred in six
teen feet of water, and the hooks and
irons had stirred up the sediment on
the bottom to such a degree that it
was impossible for the divers to ac
complish anything. Aeroplanes oper
ated by Joe Toft of Palo Alto and
Art Ayres of San Carlos flew over i
the lake but the pilots were unable to
see through the muddy water.
Professional Diver Secured
Frehe halted student attempts to
recover the body at 8:15 last night,
and sent to San Francisco for a pro-1
fessional diver. Jack Whitelaw, diver
for the Union Iron Works, was se- j
>; cured by Roy H. Button, and reached
Lagunita at 11:30. The diving appar
atus, consisting of air pump and signal
! lines, was put on the float anchored
' near the Roble side of the lake, and
1 rowboats it to the scene of the
catastrophe. Whitelaw searched the
bottom of the lake for almost two
hours, and finally, at 1:15, he came
up to report that he had found the
'; body.
Two theories have been advanced as
to the cause for his drowning. One is
that he was suddenly seized with
! cramps and the attack was so severe
that he did not come up after going
down the first time, and the other is
that the cold water affected his heart,
■ causing it to cease functioning. When
I the body was recovered from the
| water, the hands were tightly clasped
I against the stomach, seeming to prove
j the theory of cramps.
George B. Culver, Dean of Men, tele
graphed news of the tragedy to Vani
man's parents last night, and the body
will be held at the Roller and Hap
j good undertaking parlors until word
j is received from them. An ambulance
! took the remains to Palo Alto imme-
I diately after the body was taken from
i the water.
! Twenty student volunteers assisted
in the search, and automobile head
; lights were focused on the expanse
of water between the second float and :
the boathouse until the body was
found. Ernst Brandsten and his force
of life guards worked under the direc
tion of Whitelaw, towing the diving j
apparatus and pumping air to him as
he searched the bottom.
Roscoe C. Ingalls, brother-in-law of !
Vaniman, is coming up from his home
in Alhambra, and the coroner's inquest
will probably be held tomorrow after
noon.
Vaniman had applied for an assist
antship in the Biology department, and
because of his excellent work along j
that line, had every reason to believe j
that he would receive it.
Vaniman received his A.B. degree j
at McPherson Coirege, McPherson, i
McPherson, Kansas, in 1918, and made [
an excellent record there. In 1919-20 j
he attended the graduate School of i
Theology, Oberlin College, Oberlin,

at McPherson Coirege, McPherson, i
McPherson, Kansas, in 1918, and made [
an excellent record there. In 1919-20 j
he attended the graduate School of i
Theology, Oberlin College, Oberlin,
Ohio, and during 1919-21 he was teach
ing at the McPherson Senior and Jun
ior High School. From 1921-24 Vani- j
man was principal of the Junior High ;
School there, teaching physical geogra-1
phy. While at Stanford he had made
an excellent scholastic record.
Vaniman was twenty-eight years I
old, and lived at 851 University avenue

Tragedy threw its pall over Lagunita
] when Wilbur F. Vaniman, graduate
student of Biology, registered from
McPherson, Kansas, was drowned at
3:30 yesterday afternoon in the sight
of over five hundred people. The body
was not recovered until 1:15 o'clock
this morning.
Swimming towards the boathouse
from the second float, Vaniman sud
! denly disappeared from view with the
words, "Frank, help," which were
barely audible to his friend, Frank P.
Isensee, who had remained oh the
float. Frantic efforts on the part of
bathers and canoeists to reach the
spot where Vaniman went down were
of no avail, for despite attempts by
divers and the use of boathooks and
grappling irons, the body could not
be located.
F. W. Frehe was immediately called
and put in charge j)t the rescue work,
but the catastrophe occurred in six
teen feet of water, and the hooks and
irons had stirred up the sediment on
the bottom to such a degree that it
was impossible for the divers to ac
complish anything. Aeroplanes oper
ated by Joe Toft of Palo Alto and
Art Ayres of San Carlos flew over i
the lake but the pilots were unable to
see through the muddy water.
Professional Diver Secured
Frehe halted student attempts to
recover the body at 8:15 last night,
and sent to San Francisco for a pro-1
fessional diver. Jack Whitelaw, diver
for the Union Iron Works, was se- j
>; cured by Roy H. Button, and reached
Lagunita at 11:30. The diving appar
atus, consisting of air pump and signal
! lines, was put on the float anchored
' near the Roble side of the lake, and
1 rowboats it to the scene of the
catastrophe. Whitelaw searched the
bottom of the lake for almost two
hours, and finally, at 1:15, he came
up to report that he had found the
'; body.
Two theories have been advanced as
to the cause for his drowning. One is
that he was suddenly seized with
! cramps and the attack was so severe
that he did not come up after going
down the first time, and the other is
that the cold water affected his heart,
■ causing it to cease functioning. When
I the body was recovered from the
| water, the hands were tightly clasped
I against the stomach, seeming to prove
j the theory of cramps.
George B. Culver, Dean of Men, tele
graphed news of the tragedy to Vani
man's parents last night, and the body
will be held at the Roller and Hap
j good undertaking parlors until word
j is received from them. An ambulance
! took the remains to Palo Alto imme-
I diately after the body was taken from
i the water.
! Twenty student volunteers assisted
in the search, and automobile head
; lights were focused on the expanse
of water between the second float and :
the boathouse until the body was
found. Ernst Brandsten and his force
of life guards worked under the direc
tion of Whitelaw, towing the diving j
apparatus and pumping air to him as
he searched the bottom.
Roscoe C. Ingalls, brother-in-law of !
Vaniman, is coming up from his home
in Alhambra, and the coroner's inquest
will probably be held tomorrow after
noon.
Vaniman had applied for an assist
antship in the Biology department, and
because of his excellent work along j
that line, had every reason to believe j
that he would receive it.
