# BISHOP THOMAS TO SPEAK TONIGHT ON AMERICAN INDIANS
## Redmen Problems of Today Will Be Subject of Discussion 
### 
Bishop Nathaniel S. Thomas will
deliver a lecture on "The American
Indian" in the Little Theatre at 7:30
tonight. Bishop Thomas has had a
great deal of experience with the In
dians, especially of the Araphoe and
Shoshone tribes. He is bishop of the
state of Wyoming and director of the
Indian welfare work which is being
carried on by the Episcopal church in
that part of the country.
"Social experiment with the Ara
phoe and Shoshone Indians" will f)e
the topic of the lecture tonight. Bishop
Thomas will outline briefly the condi
tion of the Indian today, point out
the errors of policy of both the church
and state in regards to them, and dis
cuss the work which he and his staff
have been carrying on for the past
ten years.
"The problem of the Indian is not
the school, but what envelopes and
follows the school. It is a problem of
background which is the one thing so
far that neither the Government nor
the Church has sought to furnish,"
says Bishop Thomas.
The school, which is part of the ex
periment, is based on the psychologi
cal fact that there is an inevitable
reversal to type of the Indian when
he is out of the influence of the white
race. "It is hard, if not impossible, to
make the Indian think and desire as
does the white man. Our economic
ideals are unnatural to him. These
national and racial differences must
be taken into consideration when edu
cation is to be attempted."
The Indians are taught to keep the
best of their traditions and customs
and to make use of the best that
civilization can give them. They are
helped to be good Indians and it is
not assumed that they are ready for
an ideal curriculum that has been
evolved through centuries of civiliza
tion of the whitfi race.
