# NEW MATERIAL FOUND IN PIGSKIN PRATICE
## Pop Warner's Team Will Be Strengthened, Spring Practice Shows 
### 
The first two weeks oÂ£ spring football
practice has been spent in fitting each
player into his most suitable position.
Some of last year's stars have been
shifted to new places, and several new
candidates arc showing up well in early
practice.
For the last few years McCreery has
been starring on the Olympic Club foot
ball team at centar. This same McCreery
will be with the Stanford eleven next fall
and he will help to strengthen the center
of the line. The ex-club man is playing
particularly well on the defense in spring
practice. .
Natcher, Price, Hunt, and Van Hook
are fighting it out with McCreery for the
center job. Van Hook was substitute
to Baker last season, and Hunt was play
ing at guard. Hunt played center for the
1926 eleven. Both Natcher and Price
were members of the 1927 freshman
squad.
Everett and Robesky of this season's
victorious freshman team, and Paulson
and Raffeto, of last year's freshmen, are
being used at tackle. All four of these
men are big and fast. They should be
able to fill the hole left by the gradua
tion of Harry Shipkey and Johnson.
Coach Warner is working hard in an
effort to develop another pile-driving
back field, like he had last season. Bogue
has been shifted from fullback to half
back. Bogue wdighs in at over 200
pounds, and is one of the ''fastest men
on the guard. Warner realized that he
was too valuable a man to keep on the
bench as a substitute for Nevers. Hill,
1928 star, is another heavy ha'fback.
With Nevers at fullback and either Solo
man or Mitchell at quarter the backfield
will average over 190 pounds.
When Ted Shipkey finishes with track
and comes out for football he will be
tried at halfback.
Shipkey ran the ball on an end-around
play last season, and he was so shifty
that he will be given a chance in the
backfield this spring.
With Shipkey gone from end, it leaves
the wings of the line weak. Middleton,
Greisser, and Harris, all substitutes last
season, will be trying for a regular berth
next fall. Then Walker may be shifted
from the backfield to an end job. Wal
ker played at end before coming to Stan
ford. Davidson is the strongest end
candidate that the freshman squad sends
to the varsity. Davidson is new at foot
ball, but he is big, fast, and willing to
learn the game.
Captain Nevers and Soloman reported
for spring practice last night for the first
time this season, as baseball has kept
them busy up until last Saturday. Spring
practice will last for four more weeks,
at the end of which time Warner will
have a good line on the 1926 football
squad.
