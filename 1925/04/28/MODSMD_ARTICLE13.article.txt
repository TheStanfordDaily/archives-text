# KGO BROADCASTS GLEE CLUB PROGRAM AT COMMERCIAL CLUB
## 
### 
The Stanford Glee Club entertained
the Commercial club of San Francisco
at a luncheon today. The entire pro
gram was broadcasted over radio sta
tion KGO by remote control from the
Merchants Exchange building, where the
concert was given. In the morning a re
cital was given in the auditorium of the
Polytechnic High School of San Fran
cisco. The regular repertoire of the club
was sung with several numbers by
Charles Stratton, baritone, as soloist.
Leonard Dobson, president of the
Glee Club, announces that spring tryouts
for membership in the organization will
begin a week from tomorrow. Any one
with ability as an entertainer, as well as
those with vocal ability, are invited to
try out.
The number of those admitted to the
club is restricted only by the number
whose voice is sufficiently good, for there
is no definite membership limit. Those
who successfully pass the tryouts will
probably have the opportunity of going
with the club on the trip through the
Northwest, which is planned for next
autumn.
