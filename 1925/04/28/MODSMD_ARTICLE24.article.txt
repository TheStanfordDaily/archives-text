Rather unusual imaginary conversations may be conjectured when
faculty colleagues chance to confer, if a recent innovation at Antioch Col
lege gains much of a foothold elsewhere. "Yes, I was pretty lucky last
term. My class gave me aB in history 6 and I used the same old jokes on
them that I have been getting off for the last 15 years." And the answer
might well be, "Well, you were lucky. I renovated all of mine, rearranged
my series of lectures, and cut down on my assignments, and only got a C
in my Economics class. But then I had the handicap of working with a
class just before the lunch hour."
President Morgan of this Ohio educational institution which has broken
into the news columns so frequently of late, recently placed blanks in the
hands of all of the students, on which they will mark the individual mem
bers of the college's faculty. The students have been asked to submit their
opinions of the instructors as follows: Fairness in grading; ability to
present subject matter clearly; willingness to advise the students on per
sonal matters; religious and vocational matters; and the faculty member's
value to Antioch College.
Think of the golden opportunities which will be afforded the dis
gruntled student! What smoothly working cliques could not be formed
with the motto, "An A for all associate members or we will bust the pro
fessor! W r e control a busting majority of the class." Or, can you not
imagine sophomore Jones remarking as he vindictively scratches the mark
of failure down on his instructor's blank, "He did not present that ma
terial on the Renaissance properly to me and so I missed that on an exami
nation. If he can't make me pass, he's not worth much." But best of all
would be when the undergraduate came to grade his superior in the matter
of value to the college. "Old man Smithers has busted six football players
in two years and has never done a thing for the university. His value to
this place is negative."
Yes, indeed! We wish they would introduce this choice little system
here. We have several members of the faculty whom we would like to
grade. And we are oh, ever so sure that it would have considerable effect
on whether the salaries of the faculty were raised next year or not. —

AGAIN THE UNION STORE has been called to our attention. It
was when we were going some place and happened to pass nearby. While
it would never do to suggest that the experience is universally unpleasant,
what is to be smelled is to be smelled.
Certain charitable souls have mentioned that the place looks a trifle
cleaner. A trifle, perhaps, but there are several more layers to be removed
before it will bear close insptction.
If it is impossible for the management to keep the store ship-shape, the
"refrshment" counter should be discontinued. The business could be
handled sanitarily by the Cellar, where the facilities are better, and the
clerks upstairs could concentrate on distributing more antiseptic supplies.
As it is, the place is a mess.

sonal matters; religious and vocational matters; and the faculty member's
value to Antioch College.
Think of the golden opportunities which will be afforded the dis
gruntled student! What smoothly working cliques could not be formed
with the motto, "An A for all associate members or we will bust the pro
fessor! W r e control a busting majority of the class." Or, can you not
imagine sophomore Jones remarking as he vindictively scratches the mark
of failure down on his instructor's blank, "He did not present that ma
terial on the Renaissance properly to me and so I missed that on an exami
nation. If he can't make me pass, he's not worth much." But best of all
would be when the undergraduate came to grade his superior in the matter
of value to the college. "Old man Smithers has busted six football players
in two years and has never done a thing for the university. His value to
this place is negative."
Yes, indeed! We wish they would introduce this choice little system
here. We have several members of the faculty whom we would like to
grade. And we are oh, ever so sure that it would have considerable effect
on whether the salaries of the faculty were raised next year or not. —

AGAIN THE UNION STORE has been called to our attention. It
was when we were going some place and happened to pass nearby. While
it would never do to suggest that the experience is universally unpleasant,
what is to be smelled is to be smelled.
Certain charitable souls have mentioned that the place looks a trifle
cleaner. A trifle, perhaps, but there are several more layers to be removed
before it will bear close insptction.
If it is impossible for the management to keep the store ship-shape, the
"refrshment" counter should be discontinued. The business could be
handled sanitarily by the Cellar, where the facilities are better, and the
clerks upstairs could concentrate on distributing more antiseptic supplies.
As it is, the place is a mess.
Rather unusual imaginary conversations may be conjectured when
faculty colleagues chance to confer, if a recent innovation at Antioch Col
lege gains much of a foothold elsewhere. "Yes, I was pretty lucky last
term. My class gave me aB in history 6 and I used the same old jokes on
them that I have been getting off for the last 15 years." And the answer
might well be, "Well, you were lucky. I renovated all of mine, rearranged
my series of lectures, and cut down on my assignments, and only got a C
in my Economics class. But then I had the handicap of working with a
class just before the lunch hour."
President Morgan of this Ohio educational institution which has broken
into the news columns so frequently of late, recently placed blanks in the
hands of all of the students, on which they will mark the individual mem
bers of the college's faculty. The students have been asked to submit their
opinions of the instructors as follows: Fairness in grading; ability to
present subject matter clearly; willingness to advise the students on per
sonal matters; religious and vocational matters; and the faculty member's
value to Antioch College.
