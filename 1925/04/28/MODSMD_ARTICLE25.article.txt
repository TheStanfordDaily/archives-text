# INCOME TAXATION DIFFICULTIES ARE DISCUSSED BY LUTZ
## 
### 
That interpretation of '.'lncome" is the
greatest difficulty in income taxation, is
brought out in a paper written by Pro
fessor Harley L. Lutz of the Economics
department for the "Journal of Political
Economy."
This difficulty is due to the fact that {
the men who have drafted the laws have
dodged direct issue with many of the j
theoretical problems and haven't attempt
ed to actually define what the word/'in
come" means when speaking of taxes. J
The laws have dealt only with specific ;
types of income, naming some under this:
category and naming others as exemp-j
tions, thus allowing for a wide chance
of misinterpretation.
Professor Lutz makes comprehensive |
study of income-taxing and the difficul- j
tics involved in allowing individuals to
deduct dividends from a corporation !
whose profit has already been taxed. On
the basis of deduction in this manner, it
could be shown where no one should
pay the tax because one had already been
paid on the money lie received.
Looking at the questions from the
j)oint of view of the government, how-'
ever, in which it renders the corporation
certain aid and protection, the company
pays the tax on the basis of this help, j

whereas the individual pays oil the hasis
of his ability, judged by his income. The
latter viewpoint is that taken by the
"Model Plan of State and Local Tax
ation," in which "trades, professions, oc
cupations or employments," are all termed
as business. This term is applied to all
because an individual owner or partner
ship business receives just as much bene
fit, comparatively, from the government,
as docs a large corporation.
This would seem to be a double tax
ation on the individual, but if the plan
were adopted universally, its application
on a flat rate would tend to equalize the
burden on .all classes more evenly. To
sum up, "The ability-to-pay principle
forms the theoretical basis of the per
sonal tax, while the benefit serves in this
capacity for the business excise tax."
Income taxation is still very much in
its infancy and a great many difficulties,
such as the above, must be straightened
out before it will become a satisfactory
method of revenue, Professor Lutz says.

So many men at Harvard cut their
classes in a new term that it became
necessary for the faculty to pass a
ruling that those men cutting their
first class should be excluded from
further attendance.

Enrollment in the University of
Washington summer sessions has dou
bled in the last eight years.

That interpretation of '.'lncome" is the
greatest difficulty in income taxation, is
brought out in a paper written by Pro
fessor Harley L. Lutz of the Economics
department for the "Journal of Political
Economy."
This difficulty is due to the fact that {
the men who have drafted the laws have
dodged direct issue with many of the j
theoretical problems and haven't attempt
ed to actually define what the word/'in
come" means when speaking of taxes. J
The laws have dealt only with specific ;
types of income, naming some under this:
category and naming others as exemp-j
tions, thus allowing for a wide chance
of misinterpretation.
Professor Lutz makes comprehensive |
study of income-taxing and the difficul- j
tics involved in allowing individuals to
deduct dividends from a corporation !
whose profit has already been taxed. On
the basis of deduction in this manner, it
could be shown where no one should
pay the tax because one had already been
paid on the money lie received.
Looking at the questions from the
j)oint of view of the government, how-'
ever, in which it renders the corporation
certain aid and protection, the company
pays the tax on the basis of this help, j

whereas the individual pays oil the hasis
of his ability, judged by his income. The
latter viewpoint is that taken by the
"Model Plan of State and Local Tax
ation," in which "trades, professions, oc
cupations or employments," are all termed
as business. This term is applied to all
because an individual owner or partner
ship business receives just as much bene
fit, comparatively, from the government,
as docs a large corporation.
This would seem to be a double tax
ation on the individual, but if the plan
were adopted universally, its application
on a flat rate would tend to equalize the
burden on .all classes more evenly. To
sum up, "The ability-to-pay principle
forms the theoretical basis of the per
sonal tax, while the benefit serves in this
capacity for the business excise tax."
Income taxation is still very much in
its infancy and a great many difficulties,
such as the above, must be straightened
out before it will become a satisfactory
method of revenue, Professor Lutz says.

So many men at Harvard cut their
classes in a new term that it became
necessary for the faculty to pass a
ruling that those men cutting their
first class should be excluded from
further attendance.
