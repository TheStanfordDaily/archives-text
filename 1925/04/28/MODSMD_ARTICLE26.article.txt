I must respect the conscientious fel
low
Who, each night, spends his time upon
the books,
When weather's warm and wine is
very mellow
And lovely girls give "come you
hither" looks.
I must respect this conscientious
chappie,
Because, scholastically, he knows his
stuff,
And if. before an ex, he should forsake
me,
I fear I'd find the going awfully rough.
