Seth McCubbin
"My parents early determined that
my brother, Clem,_phould enter the
church. Clem rebelled so strongly at
this idea that he soon took to drinking
strenuously. He soon became so fond
of his liquor that he would drink any
thing—all this in open defiance of our
parents.
"Finally mother and father had their
way. How well do I remember the
scene. It was shortly after poor, dear
Clem had taken to formaldehyde. The
whole family was there at the time,
including Clem's other five brothers.
Each of us had a little silver handle to
help good old Clem."
