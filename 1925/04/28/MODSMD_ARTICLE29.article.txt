"SOUTH WlND"—Norman Douglas
Dodd Mead & Co. $2.50
This book was first published in the
year 1917. Since then some thirteen im
pressions have been made and this last
month it hafi been added to the Modern
Library edition of Boni Liveright Co.
The comment of Professor George
Saintsbury to the effect that Mr. Dogulas
was one of the two modern authors
whom he considered worth while reading
(that is, authors who had been writing
during the last decade or two) seems to
be taking effect—slower, it is true, but
nevertheless taking hold. Verily, this is
a book for the upper ten.
The plot is inconsequential; not that
it is of inferior quality but merely a
conveyance for the ideas of the author,
which is nothing new in the field of lit
erary endeavor. The point is that the
plot is not the first consideration. The
story deals with happenings and events
on that charming Mediterranean island
of Nepenthe. This island is so pleasing
that we immediately went to an atlas in
order to find the shortest route thereto.
Of course, Nepenthe is not to be found.
Seriously though, the value of the book
lies in the philosophical thought con
tained therein, and it is decidedly not of
the stuff that makes for textbooks on this
subject. The style used is light and airy
(not ethereal) and is most pleasing to
peruse; in fact South Wind and the ef'
feet of the sirocco is one which it is not
wise to forego.
The one who does not read this de
lightful novel is missing something good.
It is a book for the so-called younger
generation as well as one for our elder
companions. More books like South
Wind and more power to Norman
Douglas. —R. T.

Recently the cadets from the United
States Military, Academy at West
Point made one of their semi-annual
visits to Columbia University at New
York. Every spring the cadets attend
a vesper service in Saint Paul's Chapel
and the Cadet Choir gives a select
program during the service. The ser
vice is preceded by drill tactics, and
New Yorkers have the pleasure of
watching the famous line of gray as it
sweeps through its evolutions with
faultless precision upon the Columbia
Quadrangle.

during the last decade or two) seems to
be taking effect—slower, it is true, but
nevertheless taking hold. Verily, this is
a book for the upper ten.
The plot is inconsequential; not that
it is of inferior quality but merely a
conveyance for the ideas of the author,
which is nothing new in the field of lit
erary endeavor. The point is that the
plot is not the first consideration. The
story deals with happenings and events
on that charming Mediterranean island
of Nepenthe. This island is so pleasing
that we immediately went to an atlas in
order to find the shortest route thereto.
Of course, Nepenthe is not to be found.
Seriously though, the value of the book
lies in the philosophical thought con
tained therein, and it is decidedly not of
the stuff that makes for textbooks on this
subject. The style used is light and airy
(not ethereal) and is most pleasing to
peruse; in fact South Wind and the ef'
feet of the sirocco is one which it is not
wise to forego.
The one who does not read this de
lightful novel is missing something good.
It is a book for the so-called younger
generation as well as one for our elder
companions. More books like South
Wind and more power to Norman
Douglas. —R. T.

Recently the cadets from the United
States Military, Academy at West
Point made one of their semi-annual
visits to Columbia University at New
York. Every spring the cadets attend
a vesper service in Saint Paul's Chapel
and the Cadet Choir gives a select
program during the service. The ser
vice is preceded by drill tactics, and
New Yorkers have the pleasure of
watching the famous line of gray as it
sweeps through its evolutions with
faultless precision upon the Columbia
Quadrangle.
