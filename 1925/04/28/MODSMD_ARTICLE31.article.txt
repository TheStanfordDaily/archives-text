## 
### 
The Duke of Berwick and Alba has
sent a gift to the Stanford University
Library—a copy of the Biblia de la Casa
de Alba (Bible of the House of Alba),
recently published by him in Madrid
from the 15th century Codex, that has
been a patrimony of the House of Alba
since that time.
During his visit to Stanford last sum
mer, the Duke of Alba expressed him
self so pleased with the University build
ings and the work done in languages and
literature, that he promised J. A. Sel
lards, director of the summer quarter,
and Professor Aurelio M. Espinosa of
Romanic Languages, that he would send
the copy as a souvenir of his visit.
The gift is considered by Professor
Espinosa to be extraordinary in many
respects. The edition is so expensive
that it is necessarily limited and it has
not been put on sale. Stanford's copy
was autographed by the Duke of Alba.
"This famous Bible of the House of
Alba is a 15th century Codex that has
been for many years consulted in Madrid
by Biblical students and scholars from
all parts of the world. Its greater im
portance for Biblical studies lies in the
fact that it is one of the very few
Bible translations of the early 15th cen
tury published anywhere in Europe with
such a complete and extensive commen
tary.
"The work was a Spanish translation
from the Hebrew done by the famous
15th century Spanish Jew, Rabbi Mose
Arragel de Guadalajara. .The work of
Rabbi Mose Arragel was done in the
years 1422-1433 for the Marques de Men
doza of the Grand Order of Caltarava,
one of the ancestors of the House of
Alba.
"The 15th century Codex is printed in
a letter so small that the Duke of Alba
was aided in the interpretation of the
text by the Spanish paleographist, Don
Antonio Paz y Melia. The two volumes
constitute a distinct and important work
for Biblical studies and criticism."
