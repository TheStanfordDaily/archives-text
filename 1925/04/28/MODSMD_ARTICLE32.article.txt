# MISS BUNTING TALKS TO ROBLE GYM STAFF
## 
### 
At a meeting of the staff of the wom
en's physical education department held
this morning in Roble gymnasium, Miss
Helen Masters Bunting, director of the
department, reported on the results of
the conference of the . Western Society
of College Directors of Physical Edu
cation for Women, held at Pomona Col
lege April 7 to 9.
Round table discussions were held at
the conference, and Miss Bunting re
ported to the conference cyi international
hockey competitions. Because of the
commercialization of so many interna
tional sports, Miss Bunting thought that
the evil is liable to invade this athletic
field also, and she is therefore against
such competitions in this sport.
Because of her stand on this matter,
a clause was inserted in the resolutions
drawn up by the conference, to the ef
fect that:
"Whereas, certain grave problems are
involved in the question of international
athletic competition for women, we rec
ommend that a study of the situation be
carried on, and that the members of the
physical education profession be on the
alert.
(a) to prevent the evils of athletic
competition which inevitably creep
in unless forestalled, and
(b) to develop standards of wide par
ticipation for play's sake.
