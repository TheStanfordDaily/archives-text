# Library Exhibits Documents On History of World War; Potsdam Conspiracy a Myth
## 
### 
Documents and publications relative
to the compilation of an unprejudiced
and correct history of the world war
are now on exhibition in the down
stairs showcases of the Stanford li
brary.
Historians are working to revise un
reliable and biased accounts of the
war. Their method is to examine the
sources: documents, publications, and
archive materials from the interested
countries.
The Hoover war library has a large
collection of this source of material
from all over the world. At present it
contains over 150,000 pieces.
As an illustration of the unreliabil
ity of the first historians' account of
the conflict three sources bearing on
the so-called Potsdam Council are
shown.
The first is from the memoirs of Am
bassador Morgenthua, the American
Ambassador 'to Constantinople. The
second is the hearing before the com
missioner of Inquiry of the German
National Assembly. The third is. a
diplomatic document from the German
Foreign office. As a result of investiga
tion it is now known that the story of
the Potsdam conspiracy is a war myth.
In the other showcase there are ex
hibited some documents bearing upon
the controversy over the opening of
neutral mail by belligerent powers.
One of the papers on exhibit is a note
tg the United States government from
the British government justifying
opening United States mail as a war
measure. There is also a confidential
report of the use made of the informa
tion by the government.
