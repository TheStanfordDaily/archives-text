# JUNIOR OPERA TO HAVE NOVELTY IN SONGS AND DANCES
## 
### Herbert Klein 
Students of the psychic, excited by the
recent discussions over "the curse of
King Tut" and the mummy's revenge,
will have the opportunity of finding just
what it's all about when "Ace High," the
Junior Opera, is presented here May 9.
Imagine the lid of the great treasure
chest 'slowly opening and a troop of
Peruvian mummies and inca idols, dead
thousands of years and thousands of
miles from their burial place, slowly
filing out in the dim light. That is the
setting of one of the big dancing fea
tures of the fii*st act.
R. O. T. C. has been modified in the
production of the opera, resulting in
some snappy and original tniltary tactics
by the Peruvian army officers in their
dance in the second act.
Each of the two acts has six feature
dancing acts and several of the principals
have solo steps arranged for them, mak
ing a total of over a dozen terpsichorean
features.
Chrysella Dunker, who is directing the
chorus and dancing work of the show,
recently returned from New York, where
she obtained some of the ideas which are
being adapted for use in the opera.
Daily rehearsals of both chorus and
cast, the latter under the direction of
Delmer Daves, is making the production
ready for final polishing sooner than has
been the case with previous Junior
operas.
