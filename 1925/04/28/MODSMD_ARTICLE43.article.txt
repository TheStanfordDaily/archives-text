## 
### 
Results of a census taken by Stanford
students under the supervision of .the
city show Palo Alto to have 8640 in
habitants. According to Louis Olsen,
health officer, this total may reach 9000
when a check is made of the work, for
many of the non-resident students have
not been included in the census, and as
the student enumerators have pointed
outâ€”not all of the inhabitants in the dis
tricts visited were reached.
The census was under the direct su
pervision of Professor E. A. Cottrell,
and will now be used by the state health
department in estimating the death and
birth rate of the city.
The death rate for 1924 was made on
a basis of 7350 inhabitants, whereas, it
rightly should have been nearly 8450,
making the 1924 rate at 9.8, when it
should be 8.5 per 1000, an unusually low
death rate.

The girls at O. A. C. in Waldo hall

engagements. Whenever pie is served
in the dormitory, all recently engaged

table. In this way they announce that
they are not open for dates.
