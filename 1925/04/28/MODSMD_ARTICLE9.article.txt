# INTRAMURAL GAMES REACH FIFTH ROUND
## Alpha Kappa Lambda, Delta Upsilon, Theta Xi, Chi Psi Win Contests 
### 
Heavy hitting featured the opening
games of the fourth round of the intra
mural baseball series yesterday after
noon. Alpha Kappa Lambda defeated
Encina I by a score of 7 to 4, Delta
Upsilon trounced Beta Theta Pi, 10 to
2, Theta Xi took an easy game from
El Campo, 19 to 3, Chi Psi beat Alpha
Delta Phi, 9 to 3, and Sequoia forfeited
to El Capitan.
The Alpha Kappa Lambda-Encina I
encounter was the best game played
yesterday with both teams exhibiting
good ball. Cornell pitched an excellent
game for the fraternity team, allow
ing but seven scattered hits. His home
runs in the second inning was the
outstanding feature of the game.
The winners had one big inning—
the second —scoring seven runs on a
like number of hits. Norm Larson was
ineffective in this inning and his offer
ings were very much to the liking of
the A. K. L. sluggers. Pabst replaced
Larson in the third canto and made a
creditable showing for the rest of the
game.
The freshmen scored two runs in
the first inning, one in the third, and
one in the fourth. Cornell was steady
throughout the game, and kept the
hits well scattered.
Delta Upsilon kept up its string of
victories by taking an easy win over
Beta Theta Pi. The D. U.s started the
scoring in the first canto, chalking up
three runs on homers by Roberts, Hy
land, and Atwill. These players were
the first three men up and their ac
complishment of making three con
secutive home runs has not been
equalled this season.
The winners counted for five runs
in the fifth inning, and two in the
sixth. The Betas played a rather poor
game in the field and this accounts for
the large number of runs scored by
the D. U.s. The Betas' two runs were
made in the second inning on several
bunched hits.
Dick Hyland turned in his usual
good game for the D. U.s. He suc
ceeded in fanning fourteen of the op-
posing batters. Simons and Watt
pitched for the losers but were unable
to locate the plate with any degree of
regularity.
Theta Xi surprised intramural fans
by trouncing the undefeated El Campo
nine by the one-sided score of 19 to 3.
The game was as one-sided as the re
sult indicates, the fraternity team hold
ing a decided advantage during the
entire contest.
Maillot pitched good ball for the
winners in addition to starring at the
bat. He struck out fourteen batters
and allowed but three hits. Britten and
Smith hurled for the club team but
were not given support by their team
mates. Britten has been recognized as
one of the best pitchers in the league
but a sore arm prevented him from
giving his usual good performance yes
terday.
Theta Xi started out in the initial
frame by scoring two runs. The sec
ond inning was a track meet, the win
ners marking up eleven runs. Three
more were scored in the fourth, and
the total was brought to nineteen by
three more scored in the last inning.
El Campo broke into the scoring col
umn with runs in the second and
fourth cantos.
Ditzler, star Chi Psi hurler, won
another game for his team yesterday
afternoon by defeating the Alpha Delt
nine, 9 to 3. Ditzler, hailed by many
as the best moundsman in the league,
kept up his enviable strike-out record
by fanning fourteen batters. Dennis,
Alpha Delt pitcher, turned in a good
game but was unlucky in having the
Chi Pais bunch their hits.
The game was practically void of
features, neither team making any
spectacular plays. Both teams fielded
well, however, and the game was not
marred by a number of errors, as was
the case in the Theta Xi-El Campo con
test.
The fifth game on yesterday's sche
dule was between El Capitan and Se
quoia 11, buf the latter team gave the
club nine the game by default.

more were scored in the fourth, and
the total was brought to nineteen by
three more scored in the last inning.
El Campo broke into the scoring col
umn with runs in the second and
fourth cantos.
Ditzler, star Chi Psi hurler, won
another game for his team yesterday
afternoon by defeating the Alpha Delt
nine, 9 to 3. Ditzler, hailed by many
as the best moundsman in the league,
kept up his enviable strike-out record
by fanning fourteen batters. Dennis,
Alpha Delt pitcher, turned in a good
game but was unlucky in having the
Chi Pais bunch their hits.
The game was practically void of
features, neither team making any
spectacular plays. Both teams fielded
well, however, and the game was not
marred by a number of errors, as was
the case in the Theta Xi-El Campo con
test.
The fifth game on yesterday's sche
dule was between El Capitan and Se
quoia 11, buf the latter team gave the
club nine the game by default.

Heavy hitting featured the opening
games of the fourth round of the intra
mural baseball series yesterday after
noon. Alpha Kappa Lambda defeated
Encina I by a score of 7 to 4, Delta
Upsilon trounced Beta Theta Pi, 10 to
2, Theta Xi took an easy game from
El Campo, 19 to 3, Chi Psi beat Alpha
Delta Phi, 9 to 3, and Sequoia forfeited
to El Capitan.
The Alpha Kappa Lambda-Encina I
encounter was the best game played
yesterday with both teams exhibiting
good ball. Cornell pitched an excellent
game for the fraternity team, allow
ing but seven scattered hits. His home
runs in the second inning was the
outstanding feature of the game.
The winners had one big inning—
the second —scoring seven runs on a
like number of hits. Norm Larson was
ineffective in this inning and his offer
ings were very much to the liking of
the A. K. L. sluggers. Pabst replaced
Larson in the third canto and made a
creditable showing for the rest of the
game.
The freshmen scored two runs in
the first inning, one in the third, and
one in the fourth. Cornell was steady
throughout the game, and kept the
hits well scattered.
Delta Upsilon kept up its string of
victories by taking an easy win over
Beta Theta Pi. The D. U.s started the
scoring in the first canto, chalking up
three runs on homers by Roberts, Hy
land, and Atwill. These players were
the first three men up and their ac
complishment of making three con
secutive home runs has not been
equalled this season.
The winners counted for five runs
in the fifth inning, and two in the
sixth. The Betas played a rather poor
game in the field and this accounts for
the large number of runs scored by
the D. U.s. The Betas' two runs were
made in the second inning on several
bunched hits.
Dick Hyland turned in his usual
good game for the D. U.s. He suc
ceeded in fanning fourteen of the op-
posing batters. Simons and Watt
pitched for the losers but were unable
to locate the plate with any degree of
regularity.
Theta Xi surprised intramural fans
by trouncing the undefeated El Campo
nine by the one-sided score of 19 to 3.
The game was as one-sided as the re
sult indicates, the fraternity team hold
ing a decided advantage during the
entire contest.
Maillot pitched good ball for the
winners in addition to starring at the
bat. He struck out fourteen batters
and allowed but three hits. Britten and
Smith hurled for the club team but
were not given support by their team
mates. Britten has been recognized as
one of the best pitchers in the league
but a sore arm prevented him from
giving his usual good performance yes
terday.
Theta Xi started out in the initial
frame by scoring two runs. The sec
ond inning was a track meet, the win
