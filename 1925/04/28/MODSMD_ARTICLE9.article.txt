# INTRAMURAL GAMES REACH FIFTH ROUND
## Alpha Kappa Lambda, Delta Upsilon, Theta Xi, Chi Psi Win Contests 
### 
Heavy hitting featured the opening
games of the fourth round of the intra
mural baseball series yesterday after
noon. Alpha Kappa Lambda defeated
Encina I by a score of 7 to 4, Delta
Upsilon trounced Beta Theta Pi, 10 to
2, Theta Xi took an easy game from
El Campo, 19 to 3, Chi Psi beat Alpha
Delta Phi, 9 to 3, and Sequoia forfeited
to El Capitan.
The Alpha Kappa Lambda-Encina I
encounter was the best game played
yesterday with both teams exhibiting
good ball. Cornell pitched an excellent
game for the fraternity team, allow
ing but seven scattered hits. His home
runs in the second inning was the
outstanding feature of the game.
The winners had one big inning—
the second —scoring seven runs on a
like number of hits. Norm Larson was
ineffective in this inning and his offer
ings were very much to the liking of
the A. K. L. sluggers. Pabst replaced
Larson in the third canto and made a
creditable showing for the rest of the
game.
The freshmen scored two runs in
the first inning, one in the third, and
one in the fourth. Cornell was steady
throughout the game, and kept the
hits well scattered.
Delta Upsilon kept up its string of
victories by taking an easy win over
Beta Theta Pi. The D. U.s started the
scoring in the first canto, chalking up
three runs on homers by Roberts, Hy
land, and Atwill. These players were
the first three men up and their ac
complishment of making three con
secutive home runs has not been
equalled this season.
The winners counted for five runs
in the fifth inning, and two in the
sixth. The Betas played a rather poor
game in the field and this accounts for
the large number of runs scored by
the D. U.s. The Betas' two runs were
made in the second inning on several
bunched hits.
Dick Hyland turned in his usual
good game for the D. U.s. He suc
ceeded in fanning fourteen of the op-
