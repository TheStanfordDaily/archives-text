true economy in the
AUTOMATIC
THE! original cost of an Automatic, j
while no more than an ordinary
ice box, is not the big point of
economy. The true economy comes
with its use —the saving of food and i
ice—and with 110 extra consumption
gives an ever-ready cool drink of
water. Here are the reasons:
8 HONESTLY BUILT WALLS
PROTECT FOOD AND ICE
B Among the 8 walls of insulation is
Mineral wool —the best known heat j
resisting and cold retaining mate-;
rial. This keeps the air chilled with
out waste of ice and protects your
food.
TRAP KEEPS HEAT OUT
AND COLD IN
The trap is patented—found only in
the Automatic. Chilled air cannot
escape and warm air cannot enter
the chambers. In the ice chamber —
away from the food and easy to
clean.
COOL, REFRESHING WATER
NO EXTRA COST
The Automatic Water Cooling Sys
tem is built right into the center
wall where it takes no room and
consumes no extra ice. Outside
faucet. No more pitchers and bot
tles in your refrigerator.
