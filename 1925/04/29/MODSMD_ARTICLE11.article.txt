# AUSTRALIAN FILMS SHOWN ON CAMPUS
## 
### 
Moving pictures showing wheat-raising
and railroad systems in Australia were
shown in the Little Theater yesterday
afternoon under the auspices of the Food
Research department. The films also gave
an idea of the scenic beauty and natural
resources of the country.
This is the second showing of the films
on the campus, and will probably be the
last one. The first showing was for
engineering students.
