"Fundamentals cannot be changed
in a moment," said Bishop Thomas,
"and it is the problem of teaching
the Indian how to live , a life con
sistent with his nature that is the
question now. They must have ex
citement, in place of the hunt and the
war-path they' now have only the
gaming table and the other man's
wife. And yet we wonder at their
immorality!"
Bishop Thomas, in his lecture last
night in the Little Theatre, pointed
out that it was up to the white race
to make some small amend to the
people who had been as badly treated
as these have.
Indian Treaties Disregarded
"The problem of teaching the In
dians how to make use of what they
have learned and how to put into
practice the seemingly obvious laws
of civilization they have been taught
is the object of the social experiment
which is being carried on by the Epis
copal Mission in Wyoming among the
Araphoe and Shoshone Indians.
"Out of a great body of treaties that
the government has made with the
Indians not one has been kept. The
policy of the government towards this
race has been utterly inconsistent.
Thev have been treated, first as an
inferior race, then as a ward of the
government, and last as a subject
nation."
This was illustrated by the treat
ment of the Araphoe Indians. They
were removed from their own reserva
tion and placed on that of the Sho
shone Indians, their hereditary ene
mies. "They have lived, died, and been
educated together and so far there
has not been a single intermarriage.
There are strange differences between
the two peoples and they have become
a great problem on the reservation."
