### Herbert Klein 
Professor Lewis Madison Terman be
lieves that there are certain, very definite
things wrong with the curricula of the
average American university and he has
certain, very definite proposals to make
to remedy the situation. In an interview
Professor Terman explained the plan that
numerous educators, here and all over the
country, are advocating, a plan attracting
considerable attention and gaining a con
siderable degree of success.
Terman says, "The American Col
lege is a hybrid, combining, as it does,
two years of what amounts to ad

America has been that the student
has been handled all through his four
or five years of college in a manner
that is more suggestive of the high

school than of an institution of
higher learning.
"I favor the Lower Division system,
with its prescribed courses, for the
first two years, but after that time the
student who has shown himself excep
tionally capable should be allowed to
be released from the present 'spoon
feeding' system of taking prescribed
courses, adapted mainly to the average
and irksome and binding to those
with a desire and ability for original,
creative work. Even the most gifted
among the juniors and seniors are held
down by an order of things which
place too much emphasis on textbooks
and mastery of a routine and neither
greatly rewards nor encourages origi
nal study sufficiently.
"There has been a movement all
over the country to alter this situa

more nearly like that in those Euro
pean institutions where the student
has a stimulus to work 'on his own'
and not take his knowledge in pre
pared dosage like medicine. Some
