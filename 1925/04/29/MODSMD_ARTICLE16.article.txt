# PROFESSOR TERMAN TELLS OF EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM
## 
### Herbert Klein 
Professor Lewis Madison Terman be
lieves that there are certain, very definite
things wrong with the curricula of the
average American university and he has
certain, very definite proposals to make
to remedy the situation. In an interview
Professor Terman explained the plan that
numerous educators, here and all over the
country, are advocating, a plan attracting
considerable attention and gaining a con
siderable degree of success.
Terman says, "The American Col
lege is a hybrid, combining, as it does,
two years of what amounts to ad
vanced high school work and two
years of higher education. In Europe
the work now being done under our
Lower Division is incorporated in the
curriculum of the Gymnasium, the
school which takes the boy from sec
ond or third grade on until he is pre
pared for university. The result in
America has been that the student
has been handled all through his four
or five years of college in a manner
that is more suggestive of the high

school than of an institution of
higher learning.
"I favor the Lower Division system,
with its prescribed courses, for the
first two years, but after that time the
student who has shown himself excep
tionally capable should be allowed to
be released from the present 'spoon
feeding' system of taking prescribed
courses, adapted mainly to the average
and irksome and binding to those
with a desire and ability for original,
creative work. Even the most gifted
among the juniors and seniors are held
down by an order of things which
place too much emphasis on textbooks
and mastery of a routine and neither
greatly rewards nor encourages origi
nal study sufficiently.
"There has been a movement all
over the country to alter this situa
tion and bring about a state of affairs
more nearly like that in those Euro
pean institutions where the student
has a stimulus to work 'on his own'
and not take his knowledge in pre
pared dosage like medicine. Some
thirty or more American colleges have
already adopted the plan known as
| Honors Courses, or one similar, and
| many more will doubtless take it up
! in the near future. By this plan a
limited number of students compris
j ing the top 10 of 15 per cent of the
junior and senior classes, are freed
| from the customary routine of class
I attendance, lectures, recitations, final
j examinations, and all red tape, and
j instead, with the assistance of some
' faculty advisor, each takes a general
I field of knowledge to master during
his last two years. Conferences from
week to week with his advisor and
written reports and papers serve to
keep the student in constant touch
with his advisor but otherwise he is
free and dependent upon his own ef
forts to get all he can out of his chosen
work. At the end of his senior year
a general written examination serves
as a final check on his work.
"Mentally superior individuals are
likely to develop special interests and
initiative and it is for these that this
plan is especially needed. A study of
the early mental traits of 300 geniuses
shows many of them to have been mis
understood by their teachers, held
down and hampered in their develop
ment so that they often succeeded in
spit of, rather than because of, their
early education.
"In taking up this system the col
leges are falling in line with the gen
eral trend in education: to give the
unusual student unusual opportunities
and prevent study from becoming a
cut-and-dried affair designed solely to
fit a mythical 'average ability' by
adapting studies to fit the individual
ease whether above or below normal.
This tendency is seen in elementary
and high schools as well as in univer
sities and colleges. The prime reason
for making this system apply to a
relatively small percentage of each
class lies in its expense, for, owing to
the amount of individual attention re
quired, a greater number of capable
instructors are needed. This might
well be a system adaptable to the
majority of a class but until proper
facilities exist it can be used only for
those above-the-line scholars who are
able to derive the greatest benefit from
it. It ncourages and brings out super
ior talent and ability, things the world
needs above all else and can never
have in too great quantities."
