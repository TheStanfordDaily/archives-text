Sigma N U cinched the plaque in League
II Tuesday, by defeating the Phi Sigma
Kappa nine, favorites for the title, 2 to 0
in the fastest intramural game played this

hour and ten minutes.
Sigma Chi went into a tie with Theta
Xi for the lead in League I by winning
from the Phi Psis by default. Sigma
Alpha Epsilon took its third straight
game by trouncing Kappa Alpha 8 to 0.
in a postponed first round game. Phi
Delta Theta swamped Branner 27 to 9,
and Theta Delta Chi won from the
Union by forfeit.
Sigma Nu's airtight fielding, plus the
pitching of Wilson and the heavy hitting
of Kohler, defeated the Phi Kaps. In the
second, Kohler, Sigma Nu catcher, and
first man up, smashed a three base blow
over left fielder's head, and while the next
three men were striking out, drifted in
for the first Sigma Nu run. He dupli
cated this feat in the fourth, scoring the
only other run of. the game. Kohler's
two long hits were the only blows
Hawkins, the Phi Kap pitcher, allowed
during the seven frames.
Wilson, the Sigma Nu hurler struck
out 14 men and allowed three scattered
hits, one a three base clout by Hawkins.
Phi Delta Theta outslugged Branner
in a two hour game 27 to 9. Randolph
for the Phi Delts kept the Branner nine
helpless for four innings, but his suc
cessor, Fletcher was knocked all over the
lot. Fry, who hurled for Branner in the
absence of May, was easy for the Phi
Delts, and besides allowing four walks,
was clouted for 14 safe hits.
The Phi Delts piled up a big lead in
the first inning when 13 men made trips
to the plate, and 2 scored before Fry
retired the side. Eleven more runs were
scored in the third on four hits, and as
the game progressed, the Phi Delt total
increased. Branner rallied in the sixth
and scored four runs on three hits, but
with Phi Delta Theta 18Â»runs ahead, the
game was called in the seventh.

Alpha nine, 8 to 0. Stevenson, the S.

whiffed 11 men, while Garthwaite for
Kappa Alpha was clouted for eight. He
struck out nine more.
