Freshman enthusiasm, which heretofore has been so commendable, has
gone wrong. During the last two nights three haycocks have been burned,
each one a beacon to signal the start of a riot. These acts of destruction
seem to be entirely unjustifiable and wholly inconsistent with the attitude
which the campus is asked to take in regard to Encina.
Each year a horde of newcomers choose to become Stanford men.
They are welcomed with every consideration. The rest of the community
has felt that since they are sufficiently developed to be eligible for college
entrance, they should not be hazed or otherwise treated after the fashion
at other universities.
A group of upperclassmen, instead, are appointed to live in the dormi
tory and to assist in the amalgamation of the new class by giving advice.
Violent methods of expression are purposely avoided.
Yet, in return for a lot of fine treatment, the newcomers get cocky.
The brawls incited by the tiny spectacle of a heap of hot hay are disgrace
ful. For a sponsor to witness such a demonstration as was made by the
boys last night, is enough to urge him to propose more compelling means
of advising. It is a slight on the sponsor system and upon the respect due
the individual sponsors themselves.
The youngsters should appreciate one thing, and that is that if it were
not for the industry of the sponsors, certain groups would have made early
morning calls at Encina some time ago. Their defense of a dignified sys
tem of freshman control is in reality a defense of the freshmen themselves.
The destruction of University property, such as occurred during the
last two nights, is not to be countenanced. Such unreasoning waste must
stop. If it were the part of Stanford folk to support the University by
incendiarism, Roble gymnasium would have gone long ago.
We need the gymnasium, however, and we need the hay. Both are
expensive and tuition fees are high enough already. It is the part of a
Stanford student to help, not to hinder. Everybody would be much hap
pier to'treat the freshmen as members of the fellowship in good standing,
•if they only behaved in a manner more consistent with that impression.
STAFF MEETING tomorrow at 1:15 o'clock.
SINCE THE UNITED STATES NAVY has succeeded in captur
ing Hawaii, it appears that the opportunity to strike a telling blow at the
ukulele industry has arrived. And when that is done, it might steam on
over to China to investigate the source of that reed instrument which has
been introduced into American orchestras.
