"The Dark Angel"—Wilkes Theatre
Once upoi* a time there was a play
wright who, when he had an artistic
ending that wasn't obviously happy,
took advantage of it and niiide a good
play of Uie venture. "The Dark Angel"
lias such a possibility but the author,
one H. U. Trevelyan, is so imbued with
ihe idea that all audiences are com
posed of three parts sentimental idiots
and a like quota of high grade morons,
that he apparently lets his better
judgment suffer and "tacks" an in
terior ending on to a pretty good play.
Nevertheless, there are parts of the
play which make up for this unpleas
ant incident.
One epigram follows another and we
learn what we already know, namely:
that English society is not of the stuff
that makes for purity. Robert Ames
gives a very satisfactory performance
to a rather difficult part. The only
pity is that he fails to put in an
appearance, after the prologue (yes,
this is a well-behaved post-war plav),
until the third act. He does awfully
well and we were truly sorry to see
the play end so soon, if only for this
reason.
Marian Coakley is very beautiful to
look upon, but sad to say, her one big
climax seems to fall a bit short. It is
quite possible that she is not at fault.
Blame the direction. Her costumes,
however, are almost worth the price
of admission, and her acting through
the major portion of the piece is pleas
ing.
Joseph Kilgour as the none-too-heavy
father adds a good touch and certainly
is one of the mainstays. The balance
of the company is yes and no.
Let it not be thought that "The Dark

■Angel" is a non-essential production. |
We enjoyed it, which fact must of j
course be taken at Its face value (pun
not intended). The authorship of the
play has been ascribed by many to
that glib-tongued Armenian, Michael |
Arlen. We have our doubts.
