# CABBAGES and THINGS
## CURB MARKET 
### Steve O'Donnell 
It is a snappy Cadillac
And in it sit we three.
We pass a pair of snappy dames
That look
darned
good
to me.
Our boat draws up and nears the curb,
And me, I doffs my lid.
Convention's nothing in my life,
How's for
a ride,
ol' kid?"
t
The queen shoots me a snappy glance,'
Or so it would appear.
Then turns to ask her little friend,
"Well,
shall we,
Mothaw—
Deah?"
—11. R. G.

The sale of tandem bicycles has in
creased more than 300 per cent in the
last few weeks. It is rumored that
their introduction as the long-sought
for vehicle of co-operative dates by
students of a certain well-known uni
versity is responsible for this.
