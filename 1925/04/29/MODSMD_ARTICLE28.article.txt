# SPRING PRACTICE

### 
The football player gains my admira
tion,
When fifty thousand people pack the
bowl
And watch the silly ass, with conster
nation,
As recklessly he races toward the
goal.
I envy him when rooting sections
bellow.
And shout his fame unto the very sky.
I must admit that he's a lucky fellow,
For all the charming ladies rush the
guy.
All this, however, happens late in
autumn,
"When watching football games is quite
the rage,
And all the daily sheets, ''when you
have bought 'em,
Have football players' names on every
page.
But when, in early spring, I watch this
chappie,
As, with none there to cheer, he takes
a bump
That any normal man would render
sappy,
Why then—I think he is an awful
chump.
