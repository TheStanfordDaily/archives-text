# COLOR IN SPORTS
## 
### FEG MURRAY, 16 
They say in sport that a certain athlete
either has or lacks ."color." That he is
stolid, stoic, clam-like, like Edd Roush,
or Nurmi, for instance, or that he exudes
personality, hogs the limelight, and has a
popular appeal like Babe Ruth—or Fri
gerio. But there are also certain athletes
whose claim to "color" is a double one
—not only are their personalities colorful,
but so are their names.
Above we have not only a Black and

a white, but also a Red and a Blue and
a Browne. And there are others in sports,
too, some are Ivory, some are Black and
Blue, and some are Yellow. Of the six
colors shown in the drawing, all but John
Black and Lu Blue achieved great fame
in 1924. It is not impossible that they
of the six should jump into the most
prominence in the year 1925. John Black
was just one scant stroke behind Sarazen
in the open championship at Skokie in

1922, while Lu Blue has been the Detroit
first baseman for four years.
"Red" Grange is the most prominent
of the group, for the flaming meteor of
the University of Illinois was easily the
outstanding football player of the last
decade. Mary Browne comes next, for
no woman athlete has ever gone so far
in both the national tennis and national
golf tournaments. A1 White, of Stanford
University, won two Olympic and several

national championships at spring-board
diving, but probably more people have
heard of Black Gold, the fiery little
three-year-old that won the Golden
Jubilee Kentucky Derby.
Other athletes of color (question: is
a horse an athlete? )are Charley White
and Johnny Buff, boxers; Basil Gray,
Penn State's football captain; Eddie
Green, who carried the football 113 yards
in one play for Southern California last
year, and the late Ralph Rose, world's
record holder in the shot put.

Dr. Henry Pritchett, president of
the Carnegie Foundation for the Ad
vancement of Teaching, recently
stated that the outside activities of the
college overshadowed the intellectual
side. He scored the place of honor held
by athletics and athletes in institu
tions supposedly devoted to the pur- j
suit of knowledge.

The University of lowa is offering a '
three weeks' summer course for the
training of parents to their proper
duties to their children.
