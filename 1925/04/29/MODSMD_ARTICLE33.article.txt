# SENIORS WIN FROM JUNIOR SQUAD 2-0
## 
### 
Playing a strong defensive game, the
senior soccer team defeated the junior
squad by a 2-0 score yesterday in the
second game o fthe interclass soccer
series. Although the junior forwards
worked the ball to a good position for
a score, they failed to kick a goal.
Schocn, outside left, booted the ball
squarely into the net for the senior's
.goal in the first half after the backs had
J>rought the ball into the danger zone.
,The juniors outplayed the seniors through
out the rest of the first period but hard
luck seemed to follow them. Bing Moy
received a leg injury and his absence at
1 lie inside left position in the second half
weakened the junior offensive consider
ably.
By using a long passing attack the
seniors succeeded in scoring their second
goal of the game when Ta'am, center
forward, kicked the ball out of scrim
mage into the net. The senior backs were
mainly responsible for the winning of
the contest although Rogers, senior goal
keeper prevented several junior scores
by his heady playing, Ta'am and Howe
were the mainstays of the seniors while
Franklin, Cannon, and Miron showed up
well for the juniors.
The lineup:
Seniors— Juniors —
Hoover . O.R. Miron
.Tucker, Mum ford I.R. Hooker
Ta'am C.F. Espy
Quigley I.L. Moy
Schoen O.L. Hay
Smith R.H.B. Street
Howe C.H.B. Franklin
Polland * L.H.B. Cannon
Clark, Dave R.F. Campbell
Clark, Don L.F. Karr
Rogers Goal Tackabury
Referee: Harry Maloney.
The junior-freshmen game which is to
be played tomorrow afternoon at 4:20
\yill probably determine the class to win
second place in the series as the seniors
appear to be the interclass champions.
Unless Bitig Moy recovers from his in
jury, the junior offense will not be any
stronger than that of the freshmen.
Lack of dependable junior substitutes is
another factor which must be taken into
consideration.

Trojan mermen recently won a 53-24
victory over Pomona College in a dual
swimming meet held in Claremont.
