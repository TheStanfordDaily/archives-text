# FIFTY-FIFTY ON DATE EXPENSES TO BE FORUM TOPIC
## Euphronia Society Sponsors Debate on Subject of Campus Interest 
### 
"Shall the women pay half of the
dating expenses?" will be the subject
of the open forum discussion to be
held by the Euphronia Debating So
ciety next Wednesday. The forum is a
continuation of the series held during
the past quarter by the society.
The subject is one that has been
attracting much attention recently and
a debate on a similar question was
held recently at the University of
California. In that debate the affirma
tive side upheld the proposition that
the expenses should be on a 50-50 basis
with certain reservations.
The Euphronia meeting will attempt
to bring out the different sides of the
question rather than to bring about a
definite conclusion on a given side of
the question, though the affirmative
team will hold out for the 50-50 plan.
Hulda Hoover and Marietta Fry will
uphold the affirmative and the nega
tive side will be supported by T. F.
Baer and R. E. Stroup. The program
is being arranged by W. L. Gosslin
and Kathleen Woodward, women's de
bate manager.
