### Clifton Moore 
A twelve-inning contest between
Alpha Tau Omega and El Toro fea
tured yesterday afternoon's baseball
games when El Toro won by a 5 to 3
score, setting an intramural extra
inning record. Other results yesterday
were: Kappa Sigma defeated Alpha
Sigma Phi 10 to 1, El Tigre won from
the Breakers by a 4 to 1 count, and
the Independents forfeited to Sequoia.
The A. T. 0.-El Toro contest was
close from the start, developing into
a pitchers' battle between Woods and
Busch. Woods, the A. T. O. hurler, es
tablished a high strike-out record by
disposing of nineteen batters. Busch,
the El Toro pitcher, also made an
impressive showing with eighteen
strikeouts to his credit.
The fraternity team started the scor
ing in the second inning, marking up
two runs. El Toro counted for one in
the third, and tied the score with
; another tally in the fourth. The A. T.
| O.s scored a run in the sixth but El
: Toro pulled the game out of the fire
j in the seventh inning by scoring.
The contest continued tied until the
first half of the twelfth, when El Toro
chalked up the two runs that won
the game. Sutro led off with a single,
I scored on Patterson's three-base hit,
l and Hayden connected for a single
i which brought in the last run of the
I game.
Kappa bigma encountered little dif
ficulty in disposing of the Alpha
Sigma Phi team 10 to 1. The Kappa
Sigs demonstrated superior ball all
through the game, and the Alpha Sigs
were not given one chance to make
the game close.
Moore featured the game by pitch
ing nearly air-tight ball, allowing the
Alpha Sigs only two scattered hits. He
was given excellent support by his
teammates, and this was another big
factor that kept the Alpha Sig score
down.
The winners had a big inning in the
second, scoring four runs on five well
placed hits. Two more were made in
the fifth, one in the sixth, and two
more in the last inning, bringing the
total to ten. The Alpha Sig team
marked up its lone tally in the fifth
inning.
El Tigre took a well-earned victory
over the Breakers in a contest fea
tured by timely hitting and clever
fielding. The final score, 4 to 1, does

not show the closeness of the game.
Both pitchers, Meiklejohn for the
Breakers, and Newton, for the El
Tigre team, made creditable showings,
with the latter hurler holding a slight
advantage.
The Breakers scored their only run
in the first inning when George
walked, took second on Meiklejohn's
sacrifice, and went home on Baillard's
single. El Tigre was held scoreless
until the fifth frame. Loe singled, ad
vanced to second on Gardner's out,
made third when Newton sacrificed,
and then scored on Brown's hit.
Stillman led off in the sixth with a
walk, and crossed the plate when Tay
lor connected for a double. Another
run was made in this inning when
Taylor scored on Linneman's hit. El
Tigre counted for its last tally in the
seventh Stillman scored on New
ton's single after he had previously
reached first on a walk.
The Independents forfeited to Se
quoia, thereby losing the game by
default.
