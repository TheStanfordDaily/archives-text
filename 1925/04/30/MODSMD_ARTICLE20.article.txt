| Fuller and W. E. Licking, Phi Delta
Phi. will participate in the annual
legal debate between the two law fra
| ternities tonight at 8 o'clock in the
| Little Theatre. The question for argu
| ment will involve the validity of a
decree rendered on the basis of a sub
| stituted service summons.
The debate this evening will be the
fourth that has ben held between the
two legal fraternities. Phi Alpha Delta
was awarded the decision in the first
i held in 1722, while Phi Delta Phi has
won for the last two years. The debate
as a rule follows the form of an appeal
: case, with questions of law rather than
of fact being emphasized. The purpose
of the contest is to stimulate legal
I research and interest in the law school
| outside of the curriculum, and to
| familiarize the participants with the
| principles of legal argument and the
I method of preparing a brief.
I
Briefs have been submitted to the
I judges by the four contestants. In
' awarding a decision, the judges will
| consider both the briefs as prepared,
| and the oral argument in the debate
itself.

| tion to attend.
