# Dutch Treat for Women
## 
### 
Whether or not it is desirable for a woman to pay half of the expenses
incurred when she goes out with one of the fine, upstanding young men of
her acquaintance, will be considered from the Cardinal viewpoint. The
debate promises to be a formalized check-fumbling contest, with the
women asking to pay their half and the men saying "let me take it."
It has been vicariously contended that the person who starts things
should stand the treat, that such a system would bring women down from
their pedestals, that tax-sharing does not encourage the idea of the spiritual
superiority of women, a fancy which has been said by one woman to be
long to men generally, that the whole thing is uncalled for.
And on the other hand, these objections have been called nonsensical.
Certain specially sensitized souls will not approve of what they call
women's position as luxuries. They perfer to back their intelligences in
stead of their spiritualities, as merely persons with the status of anyone
else.
At any rate, they will argue it out. The only fathers who will be un
concerned are those with both a son and a daughter attending the Univer
sity. The results will have even greater financial significance than the
Dawes plan.
At 'em. boys and girls! Hew to the line and let the quips fall where
they mayâ€”and lay where they fall.
