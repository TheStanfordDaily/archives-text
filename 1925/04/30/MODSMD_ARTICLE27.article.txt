# What It's Worth

### 
The question, "Does a college education pay?" is often answered nega
tively. Those who say, "no," are usually ready to back up their state
ments with a fund of practical experience, personal and otherwise. They
point with illy concealed approbation to the "captains of industry" who
"started on a shoestring." The personal history of many commercial mam
moths is weighty with evidence that, while the poor presidents of the
United States, the professors of letters, the statesmen, along with the shoe
clerks, educated ribbon salesmen and penniless Beau Brummels were
plugging away at college, wasting the years of their youth, they, the suc
cessful members of society, the moneyed men, pitched into whatever they
were going to do and did it without any preliminary preparation or educa
tional fuss.
This visible proof that a college education is unnecessary is overrated.
Two things must be kept in mind. One is that the opportunities which
were open a hundred or fifty years ago to the man of integrity are no
longer open. Even in the wildest parts of the United States, water rights,
timber rights, and potential industrial sites have long since been gobbled
up. The other thing which must be remembered is that the knowledge—
even that accumulated by these non-college men—has been systematized
in scientific order. There is a saying that "opportunity is ever open to the
right man." It is no longer true in the sense that it used to be. Industry ■
has become solidified and conventionalized. The bulk of great opportu
nities depends upon taking advantage of natural resources, and these have
become swallowed up, so that the man of integrity today must confine
himself more to the enterprises which are already launched. He can no
longer start "at the bottom of the ladder" with a hope of eventually reach-.
ing the top unless he has a fair set of educational legs with which to climb.:
To get such a set of legs, he must go to college, or equip himself with the
equivalent of a college education.
A college education does not assure success. It merely makes it pos
sible for a man to climb easier and faster. He may enter almost any busi
ness and become proficient in a short time in one particular branch of his
profession, but when he gets out of that branch, he has to start all over
again. He has his nose too close to the cheese to see the color of it. He
cannot visualize the whole, because he is absorbed with the particular. A
college education will enable him to grasp the significance of a business in i
its entirety.
