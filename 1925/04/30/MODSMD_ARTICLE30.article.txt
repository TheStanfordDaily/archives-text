Lunk McCubbin
"Poor old Lunk McCubbin, what an
unfortunate lot was his. When he
was just twenty-once a nice man came
to our house and asked him if he
wouldn't like to come and see some
of the boys at the State Booby-hatch.
"We rarely saw Lunk after that,
but we heard a lot about him. He used
to make believe he was all different
kinds of machines.
"The attendants didn't mind it when
he made believe he was an automo
bile, or a steam engine, but they did
have a lot of trouble the day he
thought he was a concrete mixer. The
poor boy ate a handful of gravel and
drank a lot of water, and when the
attendants got there he was turning
somersaults."
