"The Spaniard"—Varsity.—lf this
picture is making an unconscious ef
fort to prove that American college
men are not the only ones who are
cocky, it should succeed admirably.
Not only is Richard Cortez over
whelmingly cocky, but he also has the
advantage of being handsomer than
the average high grade moron, and
quite as well dressed.
Supported by that mysterious wo
man, Jetta Goudal, they chase through
a hot picture, combining bull-fighters,
bandits, mind-readers, and narrow es
capes into a melodramatic picture of
Spain.
Noah Beery, as the servant who con
siders himself "just as good as his
master only not so lucky," does his
characteristically good performance.
If you like watching the "luckiest
man in Spain" get what he wants
under strenuous opposition, then bust
down to the Varsity and get your fill.
