# CONVINCING ACTION PUTS THRILLS INTO JUNIOR OPERA PLOT
## 
### Herbert Klein 
Action, of a thrilling and convincing
sort, carries the story of "Ace High,"
the Junior Opera to be produced May
9, along at a rate that makes the on
lookers who have seen it in rehearsal
wonder why it is all over so soon.
Although only one shot is fired during
the course of the play it is safe to
say that four or five characters are in
possession of a shooting iron at one
or more times during the course of the
last act. They point in the direction of
the rest with stern instructions to
"reach for the sky." Tension is re
lieved from time to time by the en
trance of a new person with instruc
tions for the previous bad man to
"stick 'em up."
All this happens in Peru and laws
against carrying dangerous weapons
do not seem to be enforced sufficiently
to spoil the fun when Willie, played
by Jack Wiggin, holds up the most
dangerous man west of the Rio Grande j
with a six-shooter entirely lacking in '
shells. Truman Dawes, in the role of j
Senor Moreno, the arch villain of the j
show, must be given the credit for j
handling his gun in the most noncha-!
lant and sinister manner, but Charles
Simons in his part of innkeeper's as- |
sistant, does it in the most comfort
able fashion, for he seats himself and
beguiles his victims with philosophical
dissertations. -
Sufficient progress has already been
made as a result of daily rehearsals.
Chrysella Dunker and Fred Tyroler
are directing the vocal and dancing
parts of the choruses work respec
tively.
Les Kiler's sets add much to the
sustained interest of the second act.
The lobby of the South American
hotel owned and operated by the
blackguardly Senor Moreno, has been
constructed so that the balcony and
stairs, as well as the first floor, are
visible, and the audience loses none
of the thrill of seeing the pursuit of
the villain and is aware before the
characters themselves of the approach
of a new actor on the scene.
The sets of the first act are also
noteworthy in that they show full-sized
columns of the porch through the open
door of the Hollywood home of the
brilliant archaeologist, Professor Win
dish, upon which the first curtain
rises.
Thirty-five students at the Univer
sity of Texas have had the honor of
Phi Beta Kappa bestowed upon them.

made as a result of daily rehearsals.
Chrysella Dunker and Fred Tyroler
are directing the vocal and dancing
parts of the choruses work respec
tively.
Les Kiler's sets add much to the
sustained interest of the second act.
The lobby of the South American
hotel owned and operated by the
blackguardly Senor Moreno, has been
constructed so that the balcony and
stairs, as well as the first floor, are
visible, and the audience loses none
of the thrill of seeing the pursuit of
the villain and is aware before the
characters themselves of the approach

noteworthy in that they show full-sized
columns of the porch through the open

Senor Moreno, the arch villain of the j
show, must be given the credit for j
handling his gun in the most noncha-!
lant and sinister manner, but Charles
Simons in his part of innkeeper's as- |
sistant, does it in the most comfort
able fashion, for he seats himself and
beguiles his victims with philosophical
