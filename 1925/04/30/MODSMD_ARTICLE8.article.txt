# E. S. DUVAL INJURED IN POLO PRACTICE
## 
### 
E. S. Duval, '24, suffered a fracture
of the left wrist yesterday when he
was thrown from his horse while en
gaging in a polo scrimmage. He also
sustained minor bruises about the face
and head.
Duval was expected to fill in as
first substitute for the Stanford polo
four in future games this season. It is
feared the injury will keep him out
of the game for several weeks.
