# STUDENTS RECEIVE FIRST CHOICE OF OPERA TICKETS
## New System Inaugurated to Dispose of "Ace High" Pasteboards 
### Herbert Klein 
Ticket sales for the Junior Opera,
"Ace High," will start at 1 p.m., Tues
day afternoon, in the Administration
building. For the first time half of the
Assembly hall will be reserved exclu
sively for students, and students only.
In this way no seats will be kept from
the sale, and the first man facing the
window of the ticket office when it
opens on Tuesday will have the pick
of the house.
Prices have been reduced from those
of last year's opera, the seats selling
at $1.00 and $1.25. This reduction has
been made possible by giving Iwo per
formances, one on Thursday, May 7,
for off-campus patrons only; and one
on Saturday, May 9, for men and
women of the University.
Two Love Plots
Two threads of heart interest run
through the story of "Ace High." The
love stories of Collins, the aviator,
and Gale, the professor's daughter, and
that of Willie and Catha, are the key
notes of the plot and provide some
of the biggest laughs and thrills of the
show.
The course of the love affairs can
not be said to run smoothly, least of
all that of Collins, played by P. A.
Barrett, and Gale, played by Marjorie
Allen. To save Gale from the designs
of the handsome and polished but
treacherous villain, Senor Moreno,
played by R. T. Dawes, Collins has to
borrow something from the technique
of the round-the-world flyers.
The troubles of Willie, portrayed by
J. L. Wiggin, and Catha, played by
Velma Randall, furnish some very
clever "comic relief." Willie isn't quite
red-blooded or two-fisted enough to
suit Catha and he has a decided aver
sion to strenuous athletic activities.
However, by curtain time he has be
come a changed man.
The love stories also furnish the
theme for many of the songs that
have been selected by P. N. Tyroler,
musical director.
