# COLLEGES SHOULD TEACH MEN RIGHT PATH-JORDAN

"The world turns aside to let a man
pass who knows where ho is going.
College is to teach men where they
are going," said Dr. Jordan in his
weekly lecture last night. "The men
who know where they are going are in
the minority, and they get ahead be
cause they have the ability not to go
with the others. What the others are
doing is usually not worth while, and
the problem is to get out of the crowd
when the crowd is headed the wrong
way; not that the crowd is traveling
a harmful path, but it is usually one
that is not worth while. Dr. Jordan
went on to illustrate his point by
applying it to moral problems as well
as the more tangible ones.
"The most important thing for a
student to take from college is a
fastidious morality. Men sometimes
learn morality at college, but it is
something that can not be taught in
set lectures. The world has far more
respect for those who stay out of

petting parties because 'the others'
are always in them.
"The first temptation of a college
student is idleness. There are few
who seem to realize that hard work
| never hurt any one; few men ever
died from excessive brain work.
"An ungovernable temper has been
the undoing of a great many college
men. There .are a great many in pris
ons who lost their temper over some
trivial affair and, blinded by anger,
did something they can never undo.
"Money is a source of evil in several
different ways. The desire for it leads
many a poor man to be dishonest, and
too much of it ruins the lives of many
because it leads to gambling.
According to Dr. Jordan's views it
is impossible for universities to make
rules to govern these things; the stu
dent. must learn them for himself, and
if he fails he must pay the penalty. A
college can not afford to keep those
who are not making good.
