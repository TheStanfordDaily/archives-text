# JUNIORS POSTPONE INTERCLASS CONTEST
## 
### 
Because of the many injuries which
the junior soccer team received during
the contest with the seniors, the in*
terclass game which was scheduled
for yesterday between the 1926 squad
and the freshmen has been postponed
until Monday.
With this extension of time the pros
pects for the juniors appear brighter.
The absence of Moy in the forward
line and Cannon in the backfield would
have seriously affected the junior of
fensive. An informal game was played
yesterday between the freshman squad
and a pick-up aggregation with a 3-2
score in favor of the latter. The fresh
men played a good game against their
veteran opponents.
