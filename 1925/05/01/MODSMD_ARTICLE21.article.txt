# PAAVO NURMI TO APPEAR IN P.A.A. MEET TOMORROW
## Twenty-Five Card Trackmen Entered in Annual Coast Event 
### Douglas Meservey 
The first appearance in northern
California of Paavo Nurrai, Willie
Ritola, Lloyd Hahn, and Willie Plant
a quartet of internationally known
athletesâ€”will be at the P. A. A. track
meet in San Francisco tomorrow and
Sunday.
The meet begins tomorrow in the
Kezar Stadium, Golden Gate Park, at
2:30' p.m. Trial heats and final races
will be run the first day in all regular
track events, and in addition a number
of special races are scheduled. Sunday
will see special races by Nurmi, Ritola,
and Huhn.
Cards Enter Most Men
Stanford leads the collegiate entry
list with twenty-five men. California
and smaller northern schools will also
send a few men to San Francisco, but
a majority of the Bear stars will not
attend.
It is probable that a number of the
Card tracksters will try for records
on the fast Kezar Stadium track. Cap
tain Hartranft will make one of his
last appearances in intercollegiate ath
letics and is out to set a record in
either the shot or discus.
Houser of U. S. C. holds the discus
mark with a toss of 156 feet, and the
late Ralph Rose of the Olympic Club
set the shot record of 51 feet.
Miller Out for Mark
Miller, Card 440 runner, will make
an attempt to lower his coast record
of :48 3-5, while Smith, running in the
special Hahn mile handicap, is out
to lower his mark in that event.
The appearance of Nurmi Saturday
in a special 2,000-yard exhibition run,
should be the main attraction. He will
not race his countryman, Ritola, at
that time, but will meet several Olym
pic Club athletes with a handicap im
posed upon him.
Sunday, Nurmi and Ritola are to
compete in what promises to be one
of the former's best races since his
arrival in the United States. The race
will consist of an attempt by both men
to break the record of 8 minutes 56
soconds made by Nurmi last month in
New York on an indoor track.
Plant, national champion walker, is
to compete in a special event of 2500
meters Saturday with two San Fran
cisco athletes.
Hahn, former Nebraska runner, who
has tied the world's record of 4:12 in
the mile, will attempt to break the
mark in a handicap race Sunday after
noon.
