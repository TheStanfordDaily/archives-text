# Mistaking a Facet for the Gem
## 
### 
Men of all ages and of all lands have announced panaceas for the some
what unfortunate plight of mankind, and it is not probable that all-inclusive
cures will fail to be proclaimed in the future. Some of the remedies have
been the invention of scurrilous quacksalvers, some have been the fruit of
honest study by scientific men, some have only added to human misery,
some have made the mundane dwelling-place more habitable, but no one
invention, discovery, theory, creed, event, or formula has brought about
the cosmic healing which its originator predicted. Confronted with this
realization, one must be pardoned more than a scintilla of skepticism at the
statement of Dr. Alexis Carrel, "Hope for the happiness of man rests upon
the development of a new science for understanding the brain." *
Without doubt, this eminent physician of the Rockefeller Institute for
Medical Research is entirely sincere. But he has fallen prey to the exag
geration born of too narrow scrutiny. The euphemistic predictions that
mankind would be saved in turn by the single tax, socialism, birth control,
psychoanalysis, vitamines, x-ray, Esperanto, radio, higher education, chem
ical warfare, international currency, and simplified spelling—where are
they now? They have gone the way of Villon's fair ladies and the snows
of yesteryear. For the learned men who have discovered these devices are
heir to the very human frailty of mistaking a part for the whole. They
are like one who, seeing one sparkling face of a diamond, thinks to have
seen the perfect gem. It is singular that scientists and philosophers should
persist in their extravagant statements in the light of history. We wonder
if they never become appalled at the thought of the happiness or the ex
istence of mankind depending on their single discovery.—Cornell Sun.
