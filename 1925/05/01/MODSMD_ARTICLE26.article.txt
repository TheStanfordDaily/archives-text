HISTORY OF THE McCUBBIN CLAN
Alexander McCubbin
"Dear old Alexander McCubbin was
a magician. He used to take rabbits
out of h£2ts and all that sort of thing.
He was a man of perfect habits, ex
cept for the fact that he had a pas
sion for playing poker. It was this one
vice which finally caused his downfall.
"I remember he called mother on
the phone and told her that he would
be a little late fpr dinner as he was
going to stop and see the boys.
"That night when they carried
father in the front door he was still
dressed in the robe he wore in his act.
'•One of 'the boys' told us that
father, dear old absent-minded soul,
had forgotten that he wasn't on the
staae and had pulled an ace out of his
sleeve."
