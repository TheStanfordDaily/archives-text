# S. F. PAPER REPRINTS GAG FROM CABBAGES
## 
### 
Along with a tale about the Justice
of the Peace of Hayward, and a favor
ite story told at the San Joaquin Light
and Power Company, appearing in
Eddie Boyden's column, "Tell It To
Eddie," in the San Francisco Chron
icle, yesterday morning, Steve O'Don
nell, Cabbages editor, received mention
for a joke based on a hunch supplied
by F. E. Hines. It appeared in the fol
lowing manner:
"But Where Does He Get
Tha£ Happy Task Stuff?
'No happier task these faded eyes
pursue;
To read and weep is all they now
can do.'
—Pope's 'Eloise to Abelard.'
" 'Who, pipes Steve O'Donnell, the
comedian at Stanford University,
'would have guessed they rolled the
bones in those days'?"
