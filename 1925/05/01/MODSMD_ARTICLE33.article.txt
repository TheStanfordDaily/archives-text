# SPORTS OF 1925
## Former Football Stars 
### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
The famous Wayne Munn created a sensation when he picked up world's
champion Strangler Lewis and dropped him out of a ring and into a hospital,
removing his wrestling crown during the procedure. The fact that "Big"
Munn is a former college student, who played guard on the University of
Nebraska football team, made the affair all the more interesting.
But it would be even more of a sensation if a college man should win the
heavyweight boxing championship, and such a thing is not outside the reilm
of possibility. Right now two other university football men —both of them
former linesmen —are hot on the trail of Jack Dempsey. "Sully" Montgomery,
of Centre College, and Ed Garvey, of Notre Dame, are boxers as well as
football stars, but Montgomery alone looks as though he would really get
anywhere as a heavyweight fighter.
"Sully" used to pal around with "Red" Weaver, the ail-American center
of the "Praying Colonels" back in 1919. "Red" used to get into plenty of

rows, and "Sully" sort of looked after him, with tho result that he became
very proficient with his fists.
The night that Berlenbach and Marullo fought in Madison Square Garden,
Montgomery showed a lot of class in knocking out Saavedra in two rounds.
Ed Garvey didn't fare so well, however, being knocked out in three.rounds by
Gordon Munroe. He was game and strong, but that was all. Montgomery had
speed and a good punch—and brains.
College boys li£e Munn, Montgomery, and Garvey ar.e putting culture into
"Physical Culture." Perhaps Phi Beta Kappa will replace "Tappa Bozo s
Beezer" in the world of pugilism.
