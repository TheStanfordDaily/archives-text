# 1926 OPERA TICKET RUSH STARTS TOMORROW NOON
## Best Seats Are Availailable For Students Under New System Of Selling 
### Herbert Klein 
TOMORROW at 1 p.m., the ticket office in the Administration building will
open and the ticket sale for "Ace High," the 1926 opera, will be officially
started. Coupled with this come two other announcements that will ryake
dramatic fans give an extra cheer. The first and foremost is that pi ices will
be reduced from those of last year and tickets will be disposed of at $1.25
and $1.00 for all seats. The other feature is that for the first time any
seat in the house will be available to students of the University. A block of

tickets representing an entire half of
the Assembly hall will go on sale and
every seat, without reservations, in
cluding the orchestra section, will be
available, according to Delmer Daves,
dramatic manager and director of
"Ace High."
Dialects in Show
Among the many features of the
opera one that will have a special at
traction for linguistic s.tudents is the
variety of accents and jargons to be
found in the second act. Truman
"Baron" Dawes has the part of Senor
Moreno, the Peruvian "heavy" whose
English is heavily flavored by a dash
â€¢of Castilian Spanish, or possibly it is
Mexican, accent. His assistant, Strin
berg, played by Charles Simons, has
strong traces of the tongue of his
fatherland, Germany, in his speech.
Professor Windish, the noted arche
ologist and explorer, portrayed by
John Truman, talks with the most cul
tured Bostonian accent imaginable.
Marjorie Allen and Fenton Barrett
are cast in the leading roles of the
lovers, Gale Windish and Collins, re
spectively. They talk nothing but
sartight "American," but it is what
they have to say that gives their lines
their appeal. The parts of the too
harmless Willie, and his lady-love,
Catha, are taken by Jack Wiggin and
Velma Randall, both skillful in bring
ing out the contagious humor of their
roles. Their love story forms a con
trasting background to that of Gale
and Collins and furnishes some of the
big laughs of the production.
Good Voices
The cast of this year's Junior Opera
is noteworthy in that it has some good
voices among the leads. Velma Ran
dall and Marjorie Allen will be re
membered for their singing in the
presentation of "Up on a Ladder,"
while Marjorie Allen rendered "Mah
Jongg." Fenton Barrett brings to the
leading role an exceptionally well
trained and pleasing voice. He is a
member of the Glee Club and his bari
tone is very effective throughout the
opera.
Fred Tyroler, musical director of
"Ace High," has arranged the songs
so that there will be no repeats and
each number sung throughout the
show will be a brand new one. Twelve
dancing scenes, six in each act, will
give the chorus a chance to show
its skill and demonstrate the new
steps arranged especially for the opera
by Chrysella Dunker in charge of all
the chorus work. The dance of the six
Peruvian generals is one of the most
unusual and at the same time one of
the cleverest of the many dance
groups.
