# PLAY BY PAILLERON TO BE PRODUCED BY FRENCH CLUB MAY 15
## 
### 
"Petite Pluie," by Edouard Pailleron,
will be produced by the French Club
Friday evening, May 15, at 8 o'clock in
the Little Theater for the benefit of the
French orphans which the club adopted
during the war.
The scene of the play is in the French
Alps, near the Italian frontier. The
story deals with the love affair between
Mme. de Thiais and Louis de Nohant,
third secretary of the embassy at Berne.
An elopement, with smugglers and police
add to the thrill of the story.
The play is also remarkahle for the
intensity of action, and for the apparent
indecision on the part of the author
whether to make the work a serious
treatment of a love affair or a satire
on love.
The cast of the production, which is
under the direction of Professor Fred
erick Anderson of the Romanic Lan
guages department, is as follows:
La Baronne Castelli Marian Nicholas
Jeanne de Thiais Carolyn Fromberg
Pulcherie : Helen Marburg
Louis de Nohant Maurice Rey
Batista#. John McClelland
Cabasse Joseph Brunet
