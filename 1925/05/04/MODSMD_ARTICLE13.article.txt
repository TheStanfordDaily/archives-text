# University Constructs Three Buildings to House Library
## 
### 
In 1892, when Leland Stanford Uni
j versity first opened its doors, the Stan
j ford Library comprised but 3,000 vol
i limes, which were kept in the building
j that is at present occupied by the Law
Library. Mr. Timothy Hopkins was a
most generous contributor to the shelves
of the fast-growing library, and it was
i he who gave the valuable collection of
10,000 books on railroads that now com
poses the Hopkins Railway Library.
By 1898 the old library quarters were
| outgrown and a new building was con
structed at a cost of $300,000, a gift of
: Thomas Wclton Stanford of Australia.
! At this time the library comprised 50,000 j
volumes and from then on until 1919 j
j the collection rapidly increased until it
' reached a total of 300,000 volumes.
Quake Destroys Building
In 1904, Mrs. Jane L. Stanford began
the construction of a new library build
j ing in front of the quadrangle buildings.

This building was completed but for a
few details when the earthquake of 1906
destroyed it beyond all liopes of re
construction.
Before leaving for Honolulu for her
health, Mrs. Stanford requested that her
jewels be sold after her death, and the
proceeds paid into a library fund to be
known as the "Jewel Fund," valued at
$500,000. Mrs. Stanford died while on
the trip.
Realizing that the old library building
was entirely too small, the Board of
Trustees authorized the construction of
a new building during 1913.
The builders of the new library have
looked far in the future and, according
to the present rate of increase, the li
brary should offer adequate accommoda
tion for fifty years to comf. The build
ing can shelve 700,000 volumes and is
built in such a manner that its capacity
may be doubled.
