# SIGMA NU GOLFERS BEAT D. U. TEAM FOR INTRAMURAL TITLE
## 
### Al Post 
Sigma Nu won the first annual intra
mural golf tournament held at the Bur
lingame Country Club Friday and Satur
! day by defeating the Delta Upsilon team
! one up in the final round.
As a pair the Delta Upsilon players,
Harley Hubbard and Franz Osthaus, had
lower best' ball score and aggregate than
the James Wilson-Claude Wakefield com
\ bination which represented Sigma Nu, but
the latter won out through the system of
i scoring which was used.
Each team played eighteen holes and
! turned in its card to T. A. Condit, tour
nament manager. The pairs were tTien
: bracketed as in match play and the cards
i compared to ascertain the best ball and
; aggregate made by each team on every
hole. Thus it was possible for the D. U.'s
to play more consistent golf on the entire
round without excelling the brilliant marks
made by the Sigma Nus on individual
j holes. In medal scores the D. U.'s had a
I decided edge, Hubbard tying Wilson's 84
J and Osthaus shooting an 86 in comparison
to the 96 of Wakefield, No. 2 man for
! Sigma Nu.
A mixed team composed of one man
from Toyon with a partner from Encina
turned in a card showing totals of 82 and
| .83, but the entfy was not allowed due to
I the fact that the participants were from
1 different organizations and that they
i played alone instead of in a foursome ac-
I cording to tournament regulations.
Fifteen teams made the round, which
| is considered a good tournout by Stanford
I Golf Club officials who managed the com
petition. As a whole the medal scores
were rather high because many of the con
testants were playing over the course for
the first' time and because varsity and
' freshman golf men were barred.
i *l"he prize to be awarded the winners
| will be decided upon at a meeting of the
I Stanford Golf Club tomorrow night,
j There is a possibility that the organiza
: tion may donate a perpetual trophy to be
| competed for annually by intramural
I players.
The best ball scores made by the teams
were as follows:
1. Delta Upsilon 78
2. Sigma Nu 79
I 3. Encina II 85
! 4. Branner I 87
5. El Tigre 89
