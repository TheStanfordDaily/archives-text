# HARTRANFT SETS WORLD'S RECORD IN DISCUS THROW
## Card Tracksters Place Second to Olympic Club Team In Annual P. A.A. Meet 
### Douglas Meservey 
fAPTAIN S. G. Hartranft of the Stanford tracksters, rather than Paavo
Nurmi the Finnish star, was the chief attraction of the P. A. A. meet in
San Francisco Saturday.
Competing in one of his last collegiate meets the Card captain broke the
world's record in the discus with a toss of 157 feet 1 5-8 inches. This bettered
the mark established a week ago by Clarence Houser of U .S. C. who tossed
the discus 156 feet 3 1-4 inches which had in turn bettered a record of

years' standing held by James
j Duncan. This was 156 feet 1 3-8 inches
made in 1912.
This was the second time that Hart
! ranft has thrown over 156 feet, the
first occasion being in the I. C. A. A.
A. A. meet last June when he made a
toss of 158 feet. It was with the wind,
| however, and not allowed. The throw
Saturday was a little against the wind
and in all probability will be allowed
: by the A. A. U., of which the Pacific
Association is a member.
Nurmi Slows Down
Nurmi failed to break the record of
6:42 5-10 for the mile and a half which
Ihe established in Los Angeles last
' week, but nevertheless satisfied thou
sands of spectators when he forced
1 Lloyd Hahn, the great miler from
Nebraska, to quit after a mile and a
quarter. Nurmi's time for the distance
was 6:56 7-10, which was probably due
to the poor condition of the new track.
The Olympic Club track team, for
several years winner of the P. A. A.
meets, again came out winner with a
total of 85 points. Stanford was second
with 59, Stanford freshmen third with
16, California 12, Humboldt Club 8,
University of California freshmen 4,
Italia Virtus Club 3, Unattached 1.
Although a majority of the Card
trackmen did not compete, a number
of those that did made good perform
ances. Crookshank bettered Macßae's
broad-jump mark made in the Cali
fornia meet when he leaped 23 feet
2 5-8 inches, beating out Merchant and
Boren of the Olympic Club —both for
mer California stars.
Nichols, of the Stanford freshmen,
surprised track followers when he led
Leistner, the varsity hurdler, to the
tape in the high hurdles with a time
of :15 2-5, which was good for the
track.
King, of the freshman team, was an
other surprise when he defeated Hamp
ton, Bear jumper, in the high jump,
by a leap of 6 feet 1 inch. Hampton
took second and Muhs of Stanford
