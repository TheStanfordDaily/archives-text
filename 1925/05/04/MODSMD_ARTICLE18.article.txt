# SWEDISH MARATHON TO FEATURE LAKE SPORTS SATURDAY
## 
### 
A "Swedish Marathon" will feature
the water sports program for Junior
Week-end next Saturday at Lagunita.
The Marathon will consist of an inter
class swimming race with fifteen men
on a team, each man swimming fifty
yards.
The traditional cross-the-lake swim
has been included in the program and
several of the varsity swimmers have
been training with this race in view.
Wallace O'Connor won the event two
years ago and A. J. Allen is expected to
take the laurels this year.
The cross-lake swimmers will finish
at the boathouse after the quarter-mile
grind.
Skiff, rowboat, and canoe races are
on the program and both doubles and
singles will probably be held. Canoe
tilting will furnish interest of a different
sort to the spectators.
Exhibition swimming and diving af
forded by Arne Borg and varsity divers
will round out the list of events.
Class captains for the Swedish Mara
thon, which if a success this year will
probably be placed in the intramural all
round championship, were selected re
cently. They are: A. C. Wright, '25,
A. J. Allen, '26, C. B. Stevenson, '27,
Kyme Vanden Akker, '28. All men in
terested in entering the event should re
port to their class captains immediately.
