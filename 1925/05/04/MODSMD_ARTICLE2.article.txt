# GRACE BORROUGHS GIVES INTERPRETIVE DANCES TOMORROW
## 
### 
Miss Gracc Borroughs, danseuse, will
give a program recital of interpretive
dances tomorrow night in the Assembly
Hall. This is in place of the regular
Tuesday lecture and will begin at 7 :30.
The program will consist of a review
of dance from the early seventeenth cen
tury to the present. Assisted by Miss
Betty McPherson and with Miss Louise
Marleau at the piano, Miss Borroughs
will illustrate the relation of dancing to
music.
This summer Miss Borroughs intends
to introduce her program of interpretive
period dances in the Ruth St. Denis
School in New York.
The program will contain fourteen
numbers. They will show a progression
in technique, costuming, and relationship
to music. For two centuries or more the
dances were based on slow, gliding steps,
and the feet scarcely left the floor. As
the dances progressed the technique be
came more difficult, the figures more
complicated, and the tempo more lively.
This progression is to be illustrated in
the dances tomorrow night. The music
for these dances was composed espe
cially for them. The last three on the
program will be modern interpretations.
