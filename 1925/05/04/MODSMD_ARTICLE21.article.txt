Living groups of the campus have received from the President's office
a copy of a letter written by a witness of the automobile accident in which
Professor and Mrs. Weymouth were so seriously injured. Reaction to
this has been varied. The fierce retribution which Dr. Anderson would
have fall upon drivers has provoked gales of laughter, disgusted despair,
and skeptical indifference, none of which are quite proper.
President Wilbur, one may be sure, has quite too much good sense to
be led to such fanatical extremities by one letter. He is probably quite as
philosophical about these communications as the editor is about View
points. All one can do is his best. What the President is trying to do,
most likely, is to present an indication of the general disapproval with
which outsiders view such catastrophes as the one referred to.
It has been pointed out that when people go swimming, in the course
of time somebody will drown. So will accidents occur as persons drive
cars. Every protection for swimmers and motorists and pedestrians should
l>e provided. The recent drowning was one against which careful vigi
lance was powerless. For the motor accident one cannot say so much.
Pedestrians were struck down in the street where pedestrians are not
supposed to be walking. At that part of the road, however, there is no
other place for them.
Reckless driving, that is, fast driving, prevails on the campus. At
tempts have been made to police the roads to prevent this. Apparently
the system is not adequate.
The suggestions of Dr. Anderson are ludicrously drastic. Something
should be done and something probably will be done, but ft will be some
thing different. If the county will not provide more patrols to enforce the
laws already ordered, a fee will probably be assessed to remedy the matter.
It will not be $50.
When Dr. Anderson says that his tax on motoring is as on a luxury,
he automatically throws the University into the same class. A substantial
proportion of the cars driven here cost no more than $96, which is the
quarterly tuition fee. Should an additional $50 be assessed monthly on
Stanford students by the state?
A reasonable fee might be asked and promises to be. Further discus
sion of that will follow. The letter of "Indignant Bystander" follows.
Don't worry, friends, we get them every day. It's just a form of ner
vousness.
Dear President Wilbur:
Will you permit a respectful word from a bystander, pertinent
to the recent automobile tragedy on the campus?
My suggestion is:
If opulent students are permitted to bring their death-dealing
machines to the University, tax them for the payment of police pro
tection to the community which tolerates their presence. A student
rich enough to afford a personal car should think little of paying
fifty dollars a month for the privilege of keeping such a luxury in
a place consecrated to plain living and high thinking.
In any case, I venture to express the hope that the present
laissez-faire policy of the University in regard to driving may
speedily cease. In your narrow winding lanes and alleys no one
should drive faster than fifteen miles an hour—in the district of*
dwelling houses not more than ten or twelve, perhaps.
Restriction of night driving should be enforced—not of course
upon the faculty members, who are at home. No student should be
allowed to move his car on the University grounds between nine in
the evening and dawn, except in a real emergency, and by special
permission.
There should be more than one or two policemen, both night
and day.
Pardon these few words from
Yours very sincerely,
MELVILLE B. ANDERSON.

FOUR YEARS OF PROMISING effort hasNxmi fruit. Captain

throw! Congratulations.
