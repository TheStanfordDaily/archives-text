Madame Sans-Gene
Varsity Theater
Just another proof of the fact that
two tilings can't be done at one and the
same time and particularly in the movies.
It seems impossible that both director and
star will be satisfied with either a dandy
/historical plot or a good romance-r-they
insist on mixing the two with the inevit
able result, just another picture. The ec
centric Gloria has managed (again) to
choose a mediocre director whose talent
in the line of his chosen profession is as
marked as ours would be were we to offer
a toe dance.
In spite of this immense handicap,
"Madame Sans-Gene" is worth going to
see. The beautiful palace at Fountaine
bleu is a gorgeous structure —very pos
sibly the most magnificent of the larger
palaces of France. The photography of
the exteriors is excellent and provides
compensation—in part, at least —for the
drivel and nonsense of the continuity.
One thing more to be said for this pic
ture without care, is that the minor char
acterizations were admirably handled. We
recall the corpulent washerwoman who
later became handmaiden of the dear
duchess, and also the sometime Minister
of Police who carried his snuffbox with
all the savior faire of a gentleman of the
court for Napoleon. La Swanson's left
shoulder takes quite a beating but manages
to come out of the melee with only a
battle scar (received in a real battle, mind
you) and a near kiss from the great Bona
parte. —R* T.
