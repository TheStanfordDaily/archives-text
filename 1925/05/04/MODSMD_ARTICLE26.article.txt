# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
After reading a copy of the letter
written by Professor Melville B. An- j
derson, and circulated by President
Wilbur, I wonder what mission the
President intended the letter to fulfill, i
The letter itself appears to be writ
ten by one highly prejudiced, abound
ing as it does, in gross exaggerations,
and suggestions so unreasonable as to ;
be ludicrous. It falls far short of the;
mark which we believe President Wil
bur intended it should strike. If the;
President wished to make an appeal j
to the students, and admonish them
against reckless driving, it seems that
this highly commendable purpose
would have been better served had;
the letter been written by his own
hand.
The professor refers to "opulent stu
dents, rich enough to afford the luxury
of a death-dealing machine," and sug
gests a tax of $50 a month upon each
car, to provide police protection
against the recklessness of auto own
ers. I submit for the professor's con
sideration that automobiles especially
Fords, are no longer thought of as
luxuries, and that all machines are
not "death-dealing." Further, that his
tax in some cases would be more than
j the worth of the car.
He further suggests that no student
be allowed the use of his car after
nine at night. If he has in mind that
night driving is dangerous, may I ask
why he did not set the time at dusk.
I might remind him that the recent
unfortunate accident referred to in his
j letter happened before nine in the
evening. If his idea is that a student
; becomes irresponsible, or should stay
indoors, after nine, I take exception
to his view, since we are all young
men, and not children, and should not
' be curbed by a curfew law.
The professor goes on to say that
faculty members should be exempt
from this rule, since this is their home.
I wish to say that most students are
at the University for as long a time
each year as the average professor.
I am heartily in favor of any fair
measures necessary to curb reckless
driving, but I feel that the whole stu
dent group certainly should not be de
prived of one of its privileges through

the misdemeanors of a scant few of its
number.
Let us handle this matter as any
modern community would, not by the
ridiculous method of forbidding all
traffic in motor vehicles at night., nor
by excessive taxation, but by fittingly
punishing those meriting it, and by
providing walk-ways for pedestrians
so that they may not be forced to
utilize streets intended for vehicles.

The professor refers to "opulent stu
dents, rich enough to afford the luxury
of a death-dealing machine," and sug
gests a tax of $50 a month upon each
car, to provide police protection
against the recklessness of auto own
ers. I submit for the professor's con
sideration that automobiles especially
Fords, are no longer thought of as
luxuries, and that all machines are
not "death-dealing." Further, that his
tax in some cases would be more than
j the worth of the car.
He further suggests that no student
be allowed the use of his car after
nine at night. If he has in mind that
night driving is dangerous, may I ask
why he did not set the time at dusk.
I might remind him that the recent
unfortunate accident referred to in his
j letter happened before nine in the
evening. If his idea is that a student
; becomes irresponsible, or should stay
indoors, after nine, I take exception
to his view, since we are all young
men, and not children, and should not
' be curbed by a curfew law.
The professor goes on to say that
faculty members should be exempt
from this rule, since this is their home.
I wish to say that most students are
at the University for as long a time
each year as the average professor.
I am heartily in favor of any fair
measures necessary to curb reckless
driving, but I feel that the whole stu
dent group certainly should not be de
prived of one of its privileges through

the misdemeanors of a scant few of its
number.
Let us handle this matter as any
modern community would, not by the
ridiculous method of forbidding all
traffic in motor vehicles at night., nor
by excessive taxation, but by fittingly
punishing those meriting it, and by
providing walk-ways for pedestrians
so that they may not be forced to
utilize streets intended for vehicles.

The Editor, Sir:
After reading a copy of the letter
written by Professor Melville B. An- j
derson, and circulated by President
Wilbur, I wonder what mission the
President intended the letter to fulfill, i
The letter itself appears to be writ
ten by one highly prejudiced, abound
ing as it does, in gross exaggerations,
and suggestions so unreasonable as to ;
be ludicrous. It falls far short of the;
mark which we believe President Wil
bur intended it should strike. If the;
President wished to make an appeal j
to the students, and admonish them
against reckless driving, it seems that
this highly commendable purpose
would have been better served had;
the letter been written by his own
hand.
