# Final Sale of Quads to Begin Tomorrow Morning
## 
### 
The final sale of Quads will begin to
morrow morning and last throughout
the week. A table will be stationed at
the cprner of the Engineer's corner and
salesmen will be on hand throughout the
day to sell the year books.
Only 330 Quads are left to be sold.
Last year many were unable to get their
books as a result of waiting too long.
All who have not yet purchased their
Quads advised to do so at the
earliest opportunity to avoid disappoint
ments.
