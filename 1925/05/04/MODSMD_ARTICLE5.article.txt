### W. F. Adams 
Junior Week activities start next Thurs
day afternoon, and there will be some
thing doing every minute from that time
until Saturday at midnight.
The first event on the program will be
the Corduroy Ball which is scheduled for
Thursday afternoon from 3 to 6. R. K.
Hubbard, chairman of the ball committee,
has secured Whitmer's orchestra to play
for the dance. The fact that every ticket
has been sold would indicate that the cur
tain raiser for the week's entertainment
will be a success.
Two hours after the Corduroy Ball is
over, the Lake Carnival starts. F. W.
Hyland has arranged the evening's enter
tainment, which will consist of an aquatic
parade, fireworks, and music. As an added
attraction, three will be a feature race be
tween the two motor boats on the lake.
The power boats are owned by the Beta
Theta Pi and Phi Gamma Delta fraterni
ties. There will also be some fancy
aquaplaning by several students.
Three prizes have been donated by Palo
Alto merchants for the winning floats. The
firm of Nielsen and Culver have presented
a seven-inch silver cup for the winner
in the men's group, while the Gotham
Shop lias given a silver fashion figure for
the winning women's organization.
Morey's Smokeshop donated 1000 cigar
ettes, which will be given for the most
novel float.

The 1926 Prom is the big event on Fri
day. A novel Japanese garden setting
has been arranged for the dance. The
Hotel Oakland orchestra will furnish
music for the evening. P. T. Meyers,
chairman of the Prom committee, also
promises some special entertainment', the
variety of which will be kept secret until
the night of the dance.
Saturday's program consists of Lake
sports all afternoon, and the Junior
Opera, "Ace High,' in the evening.
P. W. Shumakcr is in charge of the
lake sports. A cross-lake swim, the
Swedish marathon, canoe and skiff races,
and fancy diving will make up the after
noon's fun. There will be a short dance
