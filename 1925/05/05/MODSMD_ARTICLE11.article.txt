# GRACE HOUGHS TO GIVE PROGRAM RECITAL
## Interpretative Dances Will Show Development of Art Through Ages 
### 
A program recital of interpretive
l dancing is to be given tonight by Mrs.
j Grace Borroughs in the Assembly hall.
I A series of dances will be presented
; which will illustrate the development
; of the dance from early times.
Mrs. Borroughs will be assisted by
! Miss Betty McPherson in her dances
and by Miss Louise Marleau at the
1 piano.
Mrs. Borroughs has made a special
i study of the old court danceâ€”the
music, the manners, and the costumes
of the times, and recreates the gra
cious atmosphere of the 17th and ISth
century days.
I She has become widely known
' through her unusual programs. Her
j revival of the period dance especially
I distinguishes her work. As a result of
| the research, the pavane, the minuet,
; the gavotte, and the polka are pre
i sented in a fashion true to the period.
I The costumes and the music have
| been collected after long research.
