The Junior Week lake carnival will

the committee in charge of the carni

and they will not be allowed on the
lake again until the entertainment is
over.
A parade of decorated floats is the
first number on the program. All varie
ties of canoes, barges, and skiffs are
being rigged up with lanterns and
other forms of decorations for the
parade. Practically every fraternity,
sorority, and living group is planning
to enter a boat in this event.
The Gotham Shop of Palo Alto has
donated a silver fashion figure for the
most elaborate float that is entered
by a women's organization. The prize
for the winning boat in the men's
group is a seven-inch silver loving cup
that has been given by Nielsen & Cul
ver, a Palo Alto jewelry establishment.
Several other prizes will be presented
for novel ideas in the way of floats.
Morey's Smoke Shop has offered 1,000
cigarettes as one of these prizes.
After the prizes for the winners of
the aquatic parade have been awarded
there will be fancy aquaplaning behind
one of the power boats on the lake.
Spotlights will play on the surf-board
riders.
Music of all descriptions have been
obtained by the 1926 class for the
evening. The Stanford band will be
in the bandstand, a campus orchestra
will be playing in the boathouse, while
out on the lake itself will be a boat
filled with stringed instrument play
ers. A moon is also scheduled for
Thursday night.
An exhibit of fireworks will finish
the entertainment. An elaborate dis
play will be shot off by the Junior
Class. Some of the fireworks will be
shot from the center of the lake.
