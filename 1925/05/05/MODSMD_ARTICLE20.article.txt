# DRESS REHEARSAL OF 'ACE HIGH' INDICATES SUCCESS OF OPERA
## 
### 
Dress rehearsals for "Ace High," the
1926 Opera, started last night and will
continue the rest of the week, except
for Friday evening, the date of the
Junior Prom. A complete rehearsal
was held last night, with cast and
chorus going through their entire
parts.
Plot in Evidence
The plot of this year's opera will be
very much in evidence, a precedent in
Junior Opera productions. The play is
by W. F. Street, who is the author of
several one-act plays which have been
produced by high schools in the south
ern part of the state, and a play which
will be produced by the Palo Alto
High School next Saturday.
The action starts in Hollywood, and
from there it goes via the aeroplane
route to Peru. The setting for the
second act, a Peruvian hotel, will be
a feature of the play, since it will
show two floors of the hostelry at the
same time. Leslie Kiler designed the
two settings, the first of which will be
the palatial Hollywood home of a re
tired professor.
Ragged edges of the production
which were uncovered at the dress
rehearsal last night will be ironed out
in the next few days, and Delmer
Daves, director of the show, experts
to give Saturday night's audience a
fast-moving, tuneful, and interesting
musical comedy.
Seats left from the general sale held
this noon will be placed on sale at the
Alumni Secretary's office in the Ad
ministration building. Prices will lie
$1.00 and $1.25, with all seats reserved.
