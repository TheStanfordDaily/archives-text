# The 						Rushees Rush
## 
### 
Curiously enough, our freshman nuggets find themselves in the posi
tion of rushers before they have had the chance to enjoy that rushees. To
the high school track men who are to be our guests this week-end, the in
habitants of the hall will represent Stanford, and Stanford wants to con
tinue to account the best men as its students.
Professionally speaking, the impression is the important thing. It has
been requested that we lay bare our eminently successful experience in
order to instruct 1928 in the refinements of the system. And it has been
further suggested that, among other things, it should be mentioned that
riotous uproar, water-throwing, gang-scrimmaging, informal arson and
similar hell-raising are not particularly recommending. Professionally
speaking, the impression is the important thing.
Now, it is quite important to shun affectation. If it is impossible for
one of the freshman class to express his hospitality except by exploding a
sack full of water on a guest's neck, it is only right that he should do so.
The visitor, however, might not be in on the game. It is barely possible
that the high school runners will not understand that such treatment is only
a lot of fun.
One or another of the established amusements at Encina is likely to
prove offensive. What we would urge is that the perfect host consider
his guests. Everybody would be pleased to have the freshmen assume this
responsibility of seeing that the reputation of the University is properly
upheld.
