Again the "great metropolitan journals" of San Francisco have been
taken-in by the indomitable crew enthusiasts. Sporadically, the graduated
oarsmen bubble over at some meeting or other and a batch of exaggerated
fiction results.
There are real obstacles which must be overcome before the dream of
a Cardinal crew can be realized. First of all $30,000 must be conjured out
of vacancy. It will cost that much to re-establish the sport.
When that is accomplished, a place to practice which is nearer than
Redwood City must be provided. As it is, or was, the crew was forced to
waste considerable time in order to get to their equipment, The incon
venience will have to be remedied before rowing may be resumed.
The time required for practice under the old arrangment was too much.

California may be pointed to in answer to these last arguments, lliey
have even farther to go to reach the estuary. But the $30,000 still sticks.
It is more than a trophy that is needed to start the coxswains barking.
Stanford does want a crew. The students might possibly be induced
to make a considerable contribution. But a careful plan for financing the
proposition should be worked out.

"CONSTANT READER" INSISTS that something be said about
