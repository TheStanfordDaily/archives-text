### 
Programs for Junior Week will be sold
in the Bookstore for the rest of the
week. Sale will start tomorrow morning.
The price of the programs is 75c.
The programs are complete in 26 pages
bound in gray leather. They contain the
names of all the Junior Week commit
tees, the cast of the Junior Opera, and a
full program of all the events of the
week. The booklet has been arranged by
F. L. Matthay, chairman of the program
committee.
The programs were being sold in the
Administration building yesterday and
today. There were only a limited number
of the booklets made, and the sale for
the first two days was heavy.
