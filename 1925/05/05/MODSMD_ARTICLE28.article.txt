FABLES FOR FRESHMEN
Once upon a time there was a fresh
man who was very naughty and
wicked. He never wore his dink, he
never said hello, he queened on the
Quad (not to speak of the other
places!) And worst of all, he never
would key down: his favorite sport
was throwing water-bags at upper
classmen.
As this errant frosh went from bad
to worse, the upperclassmen who had
been excessively moistened felt that
way, too. So one night a group of
masked figures took the bad, bad fresh
man from his room. They were armed
with broad, flat pieces of wood —and
the frosh was never again seen on the
campus.
But, alas, that was a long time ago,
and this is only a fable.
MORAL: Spare the rod and spoil
the child. —F. E. H.
* * *
Mother —When I was your age,
young lady, a nice girl would never
think of holding a young man's hand.
Daughter—But, mother, nowadays a
nice girl has to hold a young man's
hand.—Yale Record.
* * *
We notice that bootleggers from San
Jose and nearby towns have been
warned to keep away from the cam
pus. Might be a pretty good idea. Any
further competition would certainly
ruin the business.
