The Little French Girl: Sedgwick.
(Courtesy Paul Elder)
This story is extremely well done. It
contrasts the French and English atti
tude toward life with simplicity and
understanding.
Alix, the heroine, is a bit too sweet
at lirst, but as she gets older she out
grows that, and develops into an ex
traordinarily charming woman, with
quite a sturdy character all her own.
A woman might honestly trust Giles,
the English hero. What more could
one ask?
Both the French and English char
acters are carefully worked out to
throw light on the diverse outlooks
which they typify. "Maraan," Alix's
mother, is especially fascinating. The
writer understands her field well, and
has a way of drawing the reader into
a receptive state, by her sheer skill
as a writer.
In her delicate appreciation of the
changes in nature, the author creates
a very appropriate atmosphere for her
story, and adds a great deal to the
more or less plotless form which it
takes.
You may object to Toppie. I hope
you do. Toppie has a skinny neck; I
know she had, although I was not
specifically told.
But it is a good book in spite of
Toppie. It is worth the price of admis
sion for Giles' sake alone.
