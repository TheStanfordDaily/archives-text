# BABE SOCCER SQUAD BEATEN BY JUNIORS IN RAGGED CONTEST
## 
### 
The junior soccer team defeated the
freshman soccer squad in the third

game of the interclass series yester

day by a 2-0 score. Both aggregations
displayed a noticeable lack of team
work throughout the contest.
For the first fifteen minutes of play
the freshmen outplayed the juniors,
but in the latter part of the period the
experienced third-year men held the
upper hand. Bing Moy, inside left, suc
ceeded in making the first goal for
the juniors after receiving a pass from
Miron, inside right, and kicking the
ball around the freshman fullback.
Offside Penalties Called
Offside penalties were called on both
teams and frequent dribbling down
the field by the forwards slowed up
the game. During the second half the
junior forward line repeatedly kept the
ball deep in the freshman territory.
Miron, inside right, scored the second
tally for the juniors early in the last
period.
Although the yearlings put up a stiff
battle, they were outclassed for the
remainder of the contest. The loss of
Rivero from the babe forward line con
siderably weakened the freshman de
fense. Sooy, regular goalkeeper, was
injured in practice and Rivero substi
tuted for him.
Franklin, Cannon, and Moy played
a great game for the juniors, while
Strowger, Hay, and Elizalde starred
for the freshmen.
