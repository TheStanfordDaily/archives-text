# ATHLETIC HEADS IN GOLF TOURNAMENT TO PICK 1925 CHAMPION
## 
### 
Stanford and California met again
today on the Held of battle, and the
prize was a big tin crown.

Football men out for spring practice
were startled last night by "Pop" War
ner's announcement that tliere would
be no practice today. Inquiries elicited
the information that the Stanford and
California Athletic departments were
to engage today in their annual golf
tournament on the San Jose Country
Club links.

Paul Davis, Stanford Graduate Man
ager, won the individual title in 1924,
and is favored to hole out in the lead
again this year, although "Tiny"
Thornhill has been holding secret prac
tice in his back yard for the last three
months, and is conceded a chance by
the experts. Andy Kerr will again play
the whole course with his favorite
putter.
