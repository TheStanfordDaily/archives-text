# BECKING, ROSS USE LIGHT TO ANALYZE NEW EXPERIMENTS
## 
### 
Experiments by which analysis of
cells by means of light instead of
chemicals are being made by Profes
sor L. B. Becking of the Biology de
partment and Professor P. A. Ross of
the Physics department.

By means of the application of these
new methods to biological problems
they hope to be able to analyze not
only colored cells, but white ones as
well. So far experiments have been
made only on colored specimensâ€”pur
ple bacteria, and green cells, by means
of ultra-violet light.

Chemical changes in salts can also
be studied in this way. Material need
be only twenty-five one-hundredths of
an inch long in order to photograph
successfully under this new method.

Doctor Becking commenced these
experiments last July at the Hopkins
Marine Station.
