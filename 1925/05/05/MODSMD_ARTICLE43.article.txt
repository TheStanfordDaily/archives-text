# INTERNATIONAL LAW SUBJECT OF MEETING
## 
### 
Extension of the general interest in
international law was the main pur
pose of the Conference of Professors
of International Law recently attended
by Professor G. H. Stuart, of the
Political Science department, and Pro
fessor J. H. Bingham, of the Law de
partment. The meeting was held in
Washington, D. C., under the auspices
of the Carnegie Endowment for Inter
national Peace.

Professor Stuart headed the com
mittee on publicity for the extension
of the study to summer schools and
says that much time was spent on
discussing methods of standardizing
the teaching of international law, as
well as extending it to the many col
leges which do not have it in their
regular curriculum.

Practically every college where this
subject is taught was represented.
This branch of law work has made
rapid growth lately because of the in
creasing importance of international
relations and the increased interest of
the public in general.

In conjunction with this meeting
was a convention of the American So
ciety of International Law. Both con
ventions were addressed by Secretary
Hughes and other men prominent in
the State Department.
