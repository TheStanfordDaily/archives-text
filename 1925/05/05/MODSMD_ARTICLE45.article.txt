# ROOS BROTHERS TO ERECT NEW STORE ON OLD LOCATION
## 
### 
Roos Brothers have started work on
the new building in Palo Alto, and will

make improvements costing over
$50,000. This amount will include the
new building, a larger stock, new de
partments, and all new fixtures, ac
cording to L. H. Riley, manager of the
Palo Alto store.

Roos Brothers' business among
Stanford students has increased over
fifty per cent in the last two years,
and enlargements have been contem
plated for some time. The new build
ing will be one story with a complete
mezzanine floor and basement. A sky
light of 300 square feet will provide
ample daylight during business hours.
The general plan of the store will be
similar to that of Roos Brothers' store
ing Oakland which is considered one
of the finest mercantile setablishments
on the Pacific Coast.

During the erection of the new
building, the complete stock of the
store will be available to purchasers
at 438 High street, just around the
corner from their old location.
