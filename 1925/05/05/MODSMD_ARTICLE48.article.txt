# STUDENT MAKES $712 IN 40 DAYS
## Unusual New Plan Used by A. G. Davis Devised by Successful Business Man Who Struggled Through College. 
### 
Every Stanford student is interested
in a good sound method of adding dol
lars to his bank account. Not only the
student earning his way through col
lege, but every one can use several
hundred extra dollars.

The same plan used by Albert G.
Davis is now open to students of Stan
ford. The St. Louis business man who
made it possible for Davis to earn
$712 in just 40 days knows the stu
dent's financial handicap. He earned
his way through college. Now that he
is in a position to do it, he is making it
easy for other students to earn the
money they need.
The unusual money making plan
that helped Davis is too lengthy to
cover in these columns, but he sug
gests that every student write Mr.
M. H. Rhodes, 1400 Pendleton, St.
Louis, Mo. Mr. Rhodes has offered
to outline the details of this digni
fied, business plan to students who
are sincere about wanting to earn good
money through conscientious effort.
The number of students to participate
in this opportunity is limited and you
should write Mr. Rhodes at once. Just
ask for his "College Student's Pro
posal."â€”Adv.
