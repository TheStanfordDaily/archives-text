## 
### 
Dr. Wilbur will attend the Pan-
Pacific Social and Economic Confer
ence in Honolulu, July 1 to 15. The
convention is to be held under the
auspices uf Punoliou College, assisted
by the University of Hawaii. President
Wilbur is chairman of the American
National Group.

"I am convinced that the stability
of International relations will hinge in
large part on the success of the na
tions on the Pacific to compose their
differences, not through the agency of
secret diplomacy of politicians, but by
open forums of practical business men
and research specialists, representing
the educational, civic, social, and eco
nomic interests of the seven nations
of this great Pacific area," says Dr.
Wilbur.

Approximately 150 influential men
from the seven countries of the Pa
cific, i.e., United States, China, Japan
Philippines, Canada, New Zealand, and
Australia, will attend the convention.
Specialists have been invited and
noted men in international relations,
history, law, "commerce, industry,
finance, race, religion, and culture will
be present.
Dr. Wilbur says that in spite of the
evident antiquity of the Orient the
present problems on the Pacific are of
modern origin and will be best worked
out by building universities and trade
routes instead of battleships and lines
of national defense. He says that,
though there is belief that this con
ference may be a source of embarass
ment to government officials he
feels this should not be the case
since the only satisfactory way of
dealing with the problems is in round
table and open forum discussion deal
ing frankly with the differences of
public opinion.
The idea of this convention is cred
ited to Roland B. Morris, former am
bassador to Japan, who headed a
group of Americans, well-informed on
Pacific affairs, when they met in the
Yale Club in New York City February
22. They outlined the convention on
the pattern of the Williamstown Insti
tute of Politics, which includes round
table committees and open forum dis
cussion.
