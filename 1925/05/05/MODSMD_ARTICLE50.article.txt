## 
### 
"The Relations of Latin America to
the League" was the topic on which
P. A. Martin addressed the Stanford
Eranch of the League of Nations Non
partisan Association last night in the
Little Theatre. This was one of a
series of lectures to be given on the
relation of the various countries of the
world to the League and the parts
they have played.
Professor Martin discussed the
Â«hare of the Latin-American powers
in the activities of the League, in the
creation of the world court, and the
post-war change in the relationship
between the North and South Ameri
can republics.
"There is a general disposition
among the southern republics to with
hold purely American problems from
the League, according to the United
States a certain moral leadership
which can only be maintained by con
vincing the South American republics
that there is room in this hemisphere
without danger of collision for com
plete recognition of the Monroe Doc
trine and the independent sovereignty
of the Latin American republics," de
clared Professor Martin in concluding
his address.
R. C. Littler spoke on "Present
Problems of the League," giving as
efxamples the adherence of Germany
to the League, disarmament, and the
control of the opium trade.
A business meeting of the Branch
followed the addresses. The next meet
ing was announced for Monday, May
11, in the Little Theatre.
