# SPORTS OF 1925
## The 						Indians Began It 
### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Indians were playing the game now known as "Lacrosse" when Columbus
discovered America! That's interesting and true, too. It. is the oldest sport
played in the new world, and the first intercollegiate athletic contest in
America was a game of lacrosse, played over 100 years ago. Now it is con
sidered, with ice hockey, as the national game of Canada, and is played
extensively in English-speaking countries. There are more than 800 organized
lacrosse teams in existence today.
When the Indians played the game in the seventeenth century, the goals
were anywhere from 500 yards to several miles apart. To them it was a war
game, and whole tribes played against each other, the contests often lasting
a week. History tells of Pontiac's luring the English garrison out of Fort
Mackinac to witness a game of lacrosse. When an Indian, as a signal,
threw the ball into the fort Pontiac's men suddenly fell upon the unsuspect
ing white men and slaughtered every one.
If you've never seen a game of modern intercollegiate lacrosse, you've
missed a thrilling sport. It is probably the fastest game played on two feet,
harder and rougher than football, and it has a great deal in common with
field and ice hockey and basketball. It is played on a field about like a
football field with twelve players to a side.
The U. S. Intercollegiate Lacrosse League consists of twelve schools, in
cluding Yale, Harvard, Cornell, Syracuse, and Pennsylvania. Princetoln, Army,
and Navy are non-league teams. In 1923 Syracuse sent a lacrosse team to
England, where it played nine games, winning six and losing three.
