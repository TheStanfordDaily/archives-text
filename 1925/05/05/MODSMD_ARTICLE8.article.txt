Hard hitting and loose fielding fea
| tured the opening games of the con-
I eluding week of intramural baseball,
j Branner defeated Theta Delta Chi, 9
j to 6, Phi Delta Theta beat Phi Sigma
! Kappa, 13 to 8, Breakers took a 15 to
!11 decision over El Toro, Delta Tau
| Delta trounced Encina IV, 13 to 2.
Branner started the scoring in the
first inning with one run. The winners
| counted for four runs in the third, and :
four more in the fifth. The Theta J
Delts .scored one in the first canto,
another in the fourth, three in the
sixth, and one in the last inning.
Lefty May proved highly effective
on the mound for the Branner team, j
allowing the Theta Delts five safeties. I
He is credited with eleven strikeouts
and three walks. Graves, the Theta |
Delt pitcher, was touched for nine j
hits, but if he had been given better |
support the score would have been,
much closer. Graves starred at the bat, j
annexing three hits in four attempts. j
The Phi Delt-Phi Sig contest was ]
marked by a large number of hits and j
an almost equally large number of
errors. The Phi Delts took an early i
lead by scoring three times in the
initial frame. In the second they |
marked up another run, and in the j
third enjoyed an old time batting I
spree, scoring five runs. Three more j
were added to the scorebook in the
fourth, and the last run was brought
in in the fifth.
Phi Delts Win
The Phi Sigs w«re unable to break
into the scoring until the third when
they succeeded in counting for one
tally.'They also staged a slug-feat in
the fifth when five runs were added
to their total. One more was added in
the sixth, and their last tally was
made in the seventh.
Randolph pitched a fairly good game
for the Phi Delts but had a bad inning
in the fifth. He fanned nine of the
opposing batters, and granted seven
hits. Hawkins, the Phi Sig twirler, was
in trouble in every inning and his con
dition was not helped by his team
mates' erratic fielding. He is credited
with eight strikeouts.
Breakers defeated El Toro in the
freest hitting exhibition of yester
day's games. The score, 15 to 11,
proves this conclusively. Neither team
scored in the first, but El Toro found
Bailard's offerings to their liking in
the second and piled up four runs.
They continued their heavy hitting in
the third, making six tallies.
Breakers Rally to Win
Breakers made one run in the sec
ond and two in the fifth. El Toro
scored their eleventh run in their half
of the fifth, giving them a safe lead
of 11 to 3. Breakers came through
with a bj£ rally in the sixth, adding
ten runs to their total, and also secur
ing a two-run lead. They cinched the
contest in the last frame with two
more runs.
Bailard pitched an unsteady game
for the Breakers, getting into plenty
of trouble in the second and third
innings, when he allow ; ed ten runs.
Busch did not make his usual good
showing on the hill for El Toro, being
touched for hits with great regularity
by the opposing batters.
Delts Easy Victors
The Delta Tau Delta-Encina IV con
test was called in the fifth because of
mutual expressions of hunger by the
opposing teams and Umpire Sypher.
Delta Tau won by the one-sided score
of 13 to 2.

"Red" Moore pitched an excellent
game for the Encina team, but was
given terrible support. He only allowed
ux scatered hits, and with a little real
ball playing on the part of his team
mates, the game might have developed
into a good game instead of a walk
iway for the Delta Taus. ,

Coleltt, pitching for the fraternity
team, made an impressive showing. He
fanned twelve freshman batters and
was touched for only four hits. Mc-
Gettigan connected for the only home
run of the game when he drove one
out of the lot in.the fifth inning with
two on.
