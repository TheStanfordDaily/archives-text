# GRADUATE MANAGER CLAIMS CREW WILL NOT BE REVIVED NOW
## 
### 
According to Paul M. Davis, gradu
ate manager, there is little chance;
that crew racing will be revived as a
major sport at Stanford, despite the
assertions recently made by the San j
Francisco press.
Davis stated that $30,000 would be
required to resump crew activities, ;
which amount could not possibly be j
spared from the funds of the Board
of Athletic Control at the present :
time. In addition with our present!
high scholarship standard and the in-!
accessibility of a practice course it
would be very difficult for a man to
retain his scholastic standing and still
participate in the sport.
The statements given out by the
press were that Samuel Scliwabacher,
a wealthy Stanford alumnus and as- J
sistant crew coach in 1908, along with j
other former Stanford crew devotees,
had formulated tenative plans to bring j
back the rowing game. Sc.hwabacher
is quoted as saying that a recent visit j
to the Stanford campus had convinced
him that the Stanford students would j
welcome the return of the sport, and !
that some of the students even went I
so far as to offer to pay their pro rata
of the amount necessary to purchase ;
equipment.
It seems as if Scliwabacher and his
associates conceived the idea of resur
recting crew while witnessing the re
cent boat race between Washington
and California, and immediately band
ed together to accomplish this end.
