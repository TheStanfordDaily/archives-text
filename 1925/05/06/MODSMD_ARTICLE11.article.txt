# UNIVERSITY TITLES AT STAKE IN TOURNAMENT
## Large Number Expected to Enter Boxing, Fencing, Wrestling Bouts 
### 
University championships in boxing,
fencing, and wrestling will be decided
at a tournament to be held in the
pavilion, Friday night, May 22, at 7:30
o'clock. According to Coach Harry
Maloney, only the semi-final and final
bouts will be held at that time, which
means that there will be fourteen box
ing and twelve wrestling bouts.
A large number of men have already
signified their intention of competing
in the championships and are working
out regularly in preparation for the
first-round bouts. This year two med
als will be awarded in each division,
a departure from the usual custom of
giving a medal only to the winners.
Several former Stanford boxers and
athletes have donated the medals for
the classes in which they were cham
pions. Entry lists for the three sports
are posted in Encina gym, and all men
intending to compete are urged by
Maloney to sign up as soon as pos
sible.
Preliminary bouts will be held
throughout the week previous to the
date of the final tournaments. This is
designed to make the night's program
shorter and to have only the best
men compete at that time.
The new fencing trophy, given by J.
Donovan Flint, a former Stanford
fencer and boxer, will be opened to
competition for the first time. It will
carry with it the University champion
ship and will become the permanent
possession of the first man to win the
cup for two years in succession. Med
als will also be awarded to the win
ners in the wrestling. Participation in
all three tournaments is open to all
students registered in the University
this quarter.
