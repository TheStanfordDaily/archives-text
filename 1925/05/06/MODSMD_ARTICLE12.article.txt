E. M. Kahn, Union; and D. H. James,
Independents, reached the semi-finals
of the spring quarter Intramural Hand
ball Tournament as a result of the
third round of play concluded yester
day.
Welch, No. 1 man on the varsity
handball team, easily defeated C. R.
McGettigan, Delta Tau Delta, 21-5,
21-9. Thomson, the dark horse of the
tournament, defeated D. R. Lawrence
in an easy match, and James reached
the semi-finals by a forfeit.
Kahn surprised by downing Rutter,
Delta Chi and No. 2 man on the var
sity, in a fast match, 21-13, 2-21, 21-15.
Rutter had been favored to meet the
winner the upper bracket in the
finals for the title Friday.
In the semi-finals, which will be
played tomorrow, Welch and James
are favored to win. Because of James'
weaker serve, however, Welch is fa
vored for the title.
