# Tests Prove Unsatisfactory In Selecting Palo Alto Police
## 
### Helen Chapman 
"Intelligence tests may be helpful
in selecting members of a police force,
but at the present time they can in
no way be considered sufficient," ac
cording to Chief Zink of the Palo Alto
police force.
The tests —the Army Alpha and spe
cial police tests —were first used in
Palo Alto during the month of August
1924. Thirteen men were selected from
about a hundred who had applied by
letter and were given the tests. Those
testing the highest were accepted; but
it was found that though a man might
be an "A" man from an intelligence
standpoint, bis lark of personality, loy
alty, and integrity might be such as

to make him utterly useless on a police
force.
When there were again vacancies
on the force, the candidates were in
terviewed personally and picked from
line. From among thirty men in San
Francisco who presented themselves
as applicants, only three were found
with the necessary qualifications. This
method was better than the former,
but was still imperfect. At present
Chief Zink picks his men personally,
and in addition gives them special
police tests devised by himself.
It is about as easy to find a good
policeman as it is to find gray-headed
Chinamen and white horses. A good
policeman must be courteous, loyal,
morally above reproach, and he must
be big. He must be largfe both because
strength and appearance of strength
are necessary and because a big man
angers less quickly than a small one,
according to Chief Zink. No man is
taken on the Palo Alto police force
unless he is at least five feet ten and
is between the agesjaf twenty-five and
thirty-five. Heavy build is preferable
but waist measurement must not ex
ceed that of chest.
Summing up the situation, Chief
Zink said that after all melodrama is
right and the most important thing
for an officer is to get his man.

Work was recently begun on the
new medical laboratories at the Uni
versity of lowa. The laboratories,
which will cost approximately $858,000
will be the first complete unit of the
new medical college to be built at the
university from a fund of $4,500,000.
