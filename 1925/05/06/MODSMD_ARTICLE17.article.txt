when they connected with Newton's of
ferings for a total of five runs.
The club team came back with two
m<»re in the fourth on hits by Stock
bridge, Taylor, and Loe. Encina scored

only allowed five hits and managed to
keep them well scattered. Harris
pitched an erratic game for the club
team and was touched for hits in each
inning.

to them by default.
