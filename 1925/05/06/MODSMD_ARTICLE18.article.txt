# FOOD EXPERIMENT OF RESEARCH INSTITUTE QUOTED IN N. Y. TIMES
## 
### 
That there is a scarcity of high-grade
i wheat, and a surplus of poorer, softer
wheat, giving rise to a food problem
| which is being solved by the Food
! Research Institute of Stanford, has
; been recognized by the New York
Times which, on Sunday, March 15,
! printed an article by Andrew R. Boone,
j excerpts of which are as follows:
"Bakers will have to undergo some
, sore of scientific training, not merely
; 'grow up in the trade.' They will have
jto learn how to utilize the poorer
' grades of wheat, and bake from them
! a bread of quality.
i "Strong flours will cease to be
' abundant and cheap, and rule-of-thumb
baking methods will pass.
Tariff Affecting Wheat
! "This is one phase of the investiga
tions of the Food Research Institute
which affects every bread user, wheth
| er in New York or San Francisco. We
I cannot import hard wheat economic
ally from Canada cfver a 42 cent tariff,
such as prevails today.
"We are approaching a deficiency of
j high-grade wheat, for which increased
' population is only a partial explana
i tion. The bakers continue to demand
stronger flours. When domestic wheat
no longer can supply this demand,
tariff walls will send the high cost of
j high-grade wheat mounting still higher.
"The Pacific Coast situation illus-
trates the point well: Baking is an
important part of the general wheat
industry. There is an overproduction
of soft wheats and underproduction of
nard wheats. In the Pacific Coast near
ly all wheats are soft and produce a
relatively weak flour.
Strong Wheat Demanded
"The most economical course for
bakers there to pursue would be to
grind wheats from near points. Yet the
millers, in order to provide strong
flour for the bakers, import hard wheat
freighted sometimes over several
thousand miles.
"These are not merely expensive
wheats, but the freight charges are
high and liable to become higher as
the years go on. The Pacific Coast
baker and the Pacific Coast consumer,
of course, pay the price. This repre
sents a-real economic waste and loss.
"American experience during the
war having driven home the import
ance of scientific food production and
distribution, President James Angell
of Yale University, and Elihu Root,
thought it worth while to carry out,
in 1921, the suggestion of Herbert
Hoover, then Food Administrator, that
an establishment of a foundation to
study significant food problems be
made.
Food Research Begun
"Co-operating with the trustees of
Stanford University, a Food Research
Institution was established. At Stan
ford was the Hoover war library, a
large and unique collection of docu
mentary material relating to the food
and other aspects of the World War,
founded by funds provided by Mr.
Hoover.
"The Carnegie Corporation guaran
teed funds to carry on the work of
the Food Research Institute for ten
years, and Stanford University pro
vided quarters in a building that was
for a long while the home of the Ger
man department.
"The institute will not try to evolve
a national agricultural policy, said Dr.
C. L. AJsberg, director of the institute.
This job rest√ü in the hands of Con
gress, the Secretary of Agriculture,
and the President.
"What the institute will do is to
prepare information from researches
which will aid in formulating a nation
al policy.
"The present study calls for a con
tinuation of wheat studies for some
time, and the next for concentrated
study will probably be selected from
among sugar, fat and oils, dairy prod
ucts, and meat products."

nese glee club under the direction of

Shantung.
