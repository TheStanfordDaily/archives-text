# REHEARSALS PREPARE FOR JUNIOR OPERA'S FIRST PRESENTATION
## 
### 
With two intensive rehearsals com-1
pleted, and the final dress rehearsal;
scheduled for tonight, the Junior
Opera, "Ace High," needs only a few;
finishing touches before its premier
presentation in the Assembly hall to-'
morrow night. The second performance j
will be held in the same place Satur- j
<lay evening.
The book is full of opportunities J
for a most effective show, and D. L.
Daves, director, and F. N. Tyroler, \
musical director, have welded together
a production that never loses interest
from beginning to end. Music that
carries the spirit of the plot with great
effectiveness has been composed and
several of the numbers have all the
melody and swing that makes for popu-1
lar hits. Between the snappy opening
selection and the tuneful finale are
about a dozen original musical num
bers .with plenty of variety and cath
ine catchiness to t.hem that probably
will be hummed, sung, and whistled
on the campus for a long time after;
""Ace High" is over.
The cast of "Ace High" is the larg
est ever used in any production on the
Stanford campus. Over sixty-five peo-i
pie appear on the stage at one time.
The twenty girls in the beauty chorus
were picked from two hundred con
testants and trained under the direc- j
lion of Chrysella Dunker who is in ;
charge of all the dancing in the show, j
Two of the dancers in feature num
bers arranged by Miss Dunker are for-!
mer members of Theodore Kosloff'si
Russian Ballet. They are Helen Stew
art, whose tango dance with Byron
Harvey opens the second act, and
Bert Harger, who stars in the weird
mummy dance in act one. Helen Stew
art has also a solo dance entitled
"Valse Bluette." Harger has a wide
experience in professional dancing,
having done the solo dance in the mo
tion picture, "Bluebeard's Eighth
Wife," and headed the feature ballet
of fifty girls at the Los Angeles Mo
tion Picture Exposition two years ago.
For two years he danced on the Or
pheum circuit and with Kosloff's bal
let. His Inca dance, in which the em
balmed Peruvian, brought all the way
to Hollywood, rises out of the great
treasure chest and begins to move in
a most life-like manner, is one of
the most sensational and thrilling
parts of the show.
The audience will probably have to
make use o.f its programs to identify
a considerable number of the cast, due
to the prevalence of plain and fancy
facial shrubbery on the actors. Senor
Moreno, "the despicable spic," has a
very elegant waxed moustache, and
Lee Flood as Pedro, "the most danger
ous man south of the Rio Grande," is
veritably hidden in the bushes. First
prize, however, must undoubtedly go
to Professor Windish, played by John
Truman. This eminent scholar and
relic hunter affects a set of beautiful
"mutton chop" whiskers that fit in
perfectly with his detached and cul
tured bearing.
