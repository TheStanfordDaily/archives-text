# REHEARSALS PREPARE FOR JUNIOR OPERA'S FIRST PRESENTATION
## 
### 
With two intensive rehearsals com-1
pleted, and the final dress rehearsal;
scheduled for tonight, the Junior
Opera, "Ace High," needs only a few;
finishing touches before its premier
presentation in the Assembly hall to-'

will be held in the same place Satur- j
<lay evening.
The book is full of opportunities J
for a most effective show, and D. L.
Daves, director, and F. N. Tyroler, \
musical director, have welded together
a production that never loses interest
from beginning to end. Music that
carries the spirit of the plot with great
effectiveness has been composed and
several of the numbers have all the
melody and swing that makes for popu-1

selection and the tuneful finale are
about a dozen original musical num
bers .with plenty of variety and cath
ine catchiness to t.hem that probably
will be hummed, sung, and whistled
on the campus for a long time after;
""Ace High" is over.
The cast of "Ace High" is the larg
est ever used in any production on the
Stanford campus. Over sixty-five peo-i
pie appear on the stage at one time.
The twenty girls in the beauty chorus
were picked from two hundred con
testants and trained under the direc- j
lion of Chrysella Dunker who is in ;
charge of all the dancing in the show, j
Two of the dancers in feature num
bers arranged by Miss Dunker are for-!
