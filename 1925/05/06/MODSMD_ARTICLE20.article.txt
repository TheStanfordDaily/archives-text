# County Chuck-Holes
## 
### 
Stanford University, an institution primarily intended for the purpose
of furthering education, maintains more miles of roads at its own expense
than perhaps any other similar organization. Yet, in keeping up the cam
pus pavements as a second&ry activity, the University manages to set an
example to the county, one of the few functions of which is to do this
very work.
About two years ago the road behind Lagunita was re-built and the
continuation of Lasuen street toward May field was repaired. Today these
much-traveled thproughfares are in a sad state and are rapidly getting
worse. Some pressure should be brought to bear to have these roads put
in proper condition.
It has always been difficult to get any service on this situation, for the
reason that the county authorities have held that the traffic over their local
chuck-holes is almost entirely from the campus. Work in this vicinity has
been of the lick-and-a-promise variety. Take a look at the lumps on the
two-year-old road behind Lagunita!
Yet, the University contributes much to the county. Aside from the
gasoline taxes which this community pays, the fines exacted from campus
drivers by county police total to a substantial sum. The Stanford Fire
Department answers calls to protect property in the foothills behind the
University. This community gives service as well as financial support. A
certain reciprocity is due.

Anybody who has jolted his way to Mayfield on Lasuen, or who has
listened to the anguished creaks of his springs as he suddenly has come to
the plowed-field stretch of tortured pavement on the back road, has definite
suggestions to make. Supervisor C. P. Cooley, of Palo Alto, represents
this district. He says that nothing can possibly be done before July, at
the earliest. It is doubtful that action will be taken at that time, since
other roads are said to be in poor shape, also.
If there are any other thoroughfares which have the traffic that these
two roads get and which are in such frightful condition, it would be inter
esting to tour out some Sunday merely to inspect such curiosities. The
proper place to make inquiries is the Board of Supervisors.
Universal interest in the roads is strong. Perhaps concerted action
may be necessary to get action. Repairs certainly should be made.

TOMORROW THE STUDENT BODY will honor those who have
achieved distinction in undergraduate activities. Classes have been ex
cused so that the entire campus may gather in the Assembly Hall at 10
o'clock to witness the awarding of Stanford's insignia upon these people.
A great many athletic and non-athletic activities will be represented
at these ceremonies. The exercises will be of particular as well as general
interest to everybody in the. University.
Every student owes it to his fellows to attend tomorrow's assembly.
The men and women to be recognized have worked for Stanford. It is
only fitting that adequate appreciation should be expressed.

THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE last night appointed Charles C.
Simons to the editorship of the weekly paper which is to be published here
during the summer. The selection was made from applying journalists
who will be on the campus this summer, Simmons being the only applicant
who is at present a member of the Daily staff.
In recognizing the summer editor's ability, although it has been evi
denced in a comparatively short time, the committee has not made a mis
take. Although Simons is just completing his sophomore year, he is the
veteran of the present news editors and is also a correspondent for a San
Francisco newspaper. In each of his journalistic capacities he has had
great success. Under his direction the summer paper promises to be quite
worth while.

STAFF MEETING TOMORROW afternoon at 1 o'clock
