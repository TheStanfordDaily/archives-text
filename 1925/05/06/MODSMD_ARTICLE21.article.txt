"BUNK," by w. E. WOODWARD
(Published by Harper & Bros.)
Here is a book that fits into none of
the ready-made classifications into
which most works of fiction can be
shoved. In fact there is considerable
ground for doubting that it is, properly
speaking a word of fiction at all. Its
jacket proudly proclaims it to be "a
novel, a romance, a story of big busi
ness, and a philosophical essay all
rolled into one," and the claim is justi
fied although these points seem to be
strung together rather than rolled into
a coherent whole.
A first impression is that Mr. Wood
ward sat down with a specimen of
each of the most popular types of fic
tion, and determined that he would
write a book that, had a little of each
â€”a sort of super best-seller that would
demonstrate the author's versatility
and give him an opportunity to have

some sport. He took the satirical point
of poking fun at present-day society,
and the big business epic and the ever
popular sex-appeal masterpiece, and
the society novel, and so on down the
line, even including the modern maga
zines dedicated to the great god "suc
cess." He has preserved something of
each of them in "Bunk" with a sort of
shorthand caricature but one which is
easily recognizable.
In the first place the reader feels
that the author has his tongue in
check during most of the story, that
he is not sticking it out at his public
in particular, and the whole system of
things in general. There are spots,
however, where there is a sudden and
unmistakable change to a serious and
determined sincerity of writing as
though the author had set. bis jaw
firmly and was out to destroy some
"Bunk" of his own without leaving it
to his chief character, Michael Webb,
cast In the interesting and novel role
of "de bunking expert," as he is titled
in the story. These are places in which

it is evident that the writer finds the
existing order just a bit too ridiculous
for him to handle with his usual cyni
cally-humorous, half-comic, half-seri
ous style and he dips his pen in bitter
sarcasm and proceeds to indicate to
mankind that in many ways it is show
ing that the birth rate has evidently
increased since Barnum made his fam
ous computation.
To come now to the story itself. In
the first place it is an obviously im
possibly kind of a plot, the sort in
which the author holds converse with
his own characters upon occasion.
There is just enough plot to connect in
a rough way the various adventures
and emotional experiences that Mi
chael Webb goes through and at the
end a love story, or rather a marriage,
has been tacked on so that the reader
who might otherwise loudly demand
some "heart interest" can be satisfied.
Woodward has succeeded in making
only the merest beginning in analyz
ing the many different varieties of
plain and fancy bunk extant today,
but it would take fifteen or twenty
volumes the size of this one, and much
more closely written, to attempt any
such survey. One of the particular
sub species that this book handles in
a masterly way is the bunk of big
business. I would prescribe "Bunk" as
an antidote for overdoses of reading
in magazines like the "American" and
"Success" whose pages are filled with
the moving stories of men, those big,
outstanding men, who began at the
bottom, amassed a pile, and now are
"substantial citizens" at the top. This
class is represented in the story by
Richard Ellerman, multimillionaire
motor car manufacturer. By the time
the last page is reached Mr. Ellerman
stands revealed without a shred of
dignity or even an excuse for his
faults. And yet he has not been un
sympathetically drawn, he is the not
uncommon sort of man who knows
the public's weaknesses and makes
use of them. He gets to the top by
climbing on the shoulders of others
and administering the soothing syrup
of bunk to quiet their protests.
