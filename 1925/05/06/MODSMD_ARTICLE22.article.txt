A TOAST!
Have a round on Lucy Green,
She's the noted campus queen.
With Working men she's seldom seen
Oh, Lucy uses that old bean.
So drink 'er down to Lucy Green.

EPITAPHS WE'D LIKE TO SEE
Here lies officer John Murray.
He hollered, "Hey there, what's your
hurry!"
Here lies Bootlegger Joseph Call.
He drank his own wood alcohol.
Tread softly on Prof. Harold Rex.
The blank, blank, blank —he sprang
an ex.
Here lies John Hemingway Sylvester.
He seminared me last semester.

FALSE ALARM
The stranger asked, "May I marry
you?"
The girl cried, "Niver, Niver."
And then she ran away from him,
And leaped into the river.
And what is the moral to this verse.
Is it "Death before Dishonor," maid?
No. The man was a minister
And simply whooping up his trade.
You say, "When he asked her this
simple thing,
Why was she afraid of him?"
She wasn't, you silly so-and-so.
She was merely going for a swim.
