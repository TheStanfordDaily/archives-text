# CORNELL PROFESSOR WRITING BOOK WHILE VISITING AT STANFORD
## 
### 
Professor 01. McCaskill, a member
of the Cornell legal department fac
ulty, is at present visiting at Stanford
for the purpose of gathering material
for a case book which he is writing on
"Pleading." He has been gathering
material on the subject for several
years, and the book is now nearing
completion.
The professor came to California
primarily for the health of his daugh
ter. Finding the library facilities in
Southern California inadequate, he
came to Stanford. He is taking his
sabbatical leave from Cornell this
year.
Plans New Method
The professor is working out an en
tirely new method for the teaching of
pleading. He says, "whatever jurisdic
tion a man expects to practice, he
must have at least a background of
common law and equity pleading. He
ought to know the code as well. Plead
ing changes almost from day to day,
so a man must know what ft; coming
as well as what is at the present time.
To be able to know this, he ought to
know the past history of pleading."
The book will give a comparative
treatment of common and equity
pleading, so as to enable one to form
deductions as to what is fundamental
and likely to persevere, as distinctive
from those things that are merely
temporal. When common law, equity,
and the codes, all concur on a prin
ciple, this indicates that it is funda
mental, and not merely temporal.
Teaching at Cornell
Professor McCaskill has been teach
ing pleading at Cornell for four years,
using this system for his teaching. He
is now compiling the book for the
benefit of other teachers and students
who prefer this system.
The work will probably be pub
lished in two volumes. The first will
contain Common Law and equitable
remedies, and civil action under codes,
including problems of enjoinder of
causes of action and parties. The sec
ond volume will include principles of
allegation and the formation of an
issue. The work will probably be
completed about the middle of next
year.
Commends Stanford
The professor is very much pleased
with conditions liete. He says that the
Stanford law school should take sec
ond place to none of the Eastern col
leges. He also said that the library is
very excellent as to completeness, but
owing to the lack of space, it is poorly
arranged.
The professor will be in California
until the first of September. Most of
this time will probably be spent at
Stanford.

Percy Marks author of "The Plastic
Age," in a recent address at Ohio
University, declared that fifty per cent
of the undergraduates should be put
out of college for their own good and
for the good of the college.

The University of California claims
to have the only woman sports writer
in the country.

Professor 01. McCaskill, a member
of the Cornell legal department fac
ulty, is at present visiting at Stanford
for the purpose of gathering material
for a case book which he is writing on
"Pleading." He has been gathering
material on the subject for several
years, and the book is now nearing
completion.
The professor came to California
primarily for the health of his daugh
ter. Finding the library facilities in
Southern California inadequate, he
came to Stanford. He is taking his
sabbatical leave from Cornell this
year.
Plans New Method
The professor is working out an en
tirely new method for the teaching of
pleading. He says, "whatever jurisdic
tion a man expects to practice, he
must have at least a background of
common law and equity pleading. He
ought to know the code as well. Plead
ing changes almost from day to day,
so a man must know what ft; coming
as well as what is at the present time.
To be able to know this, he ought to
know the past history of pleading."
The book will give a comparative
treatment of common and equity
pleading, so as to enable one to form
deductions as to what is fundamental
and likely to persevere, as distinctive
from those things that are merely
temporal. When common law, equity,
and the codes, all concur on a prin
ciple, this indicates that it is funda
mental, and not merely temporal.
Teaching at Cornell
Professor McCaskill has been teach
ing pleading at Cornell for four years,
using this system for his teaching. He
is now compiling the book for the
benefit of other teachers and students
who prefer this system.
The work will probably be pub
lished in two volumes. The first will
contain Common Law and equitable
remedies, and civil action under codes,
including problems of enjoinder of
causes of action and parties. The sec
ond volume will include principles of
allegation and the formation of an
issue. The work will probably be
completed about the middle of next
year.
