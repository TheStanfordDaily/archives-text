# SHEIBLEY LECTURES BEFORE M. E. CLUB
## 
### 
Accident prevention, its history and
practice, were discussed by E. G.
Sheibley, '08, at the meeting of the
Mechanical Engineering Society last
night. The lecture was illustrated by
lantern slides showing safety devices
and their application.
Mr. Sheibley, who is superintendent
of the State Industrial Accident Board,
told of Workingmen's Compensation
and its effect on industrial safety, and
traced the history of the movement.
He also explained the legislation con
cerning the installation of protective
devices in industry, and showed the
need for such protection.
One of the interesting points brought
out by Mr. Sheibley was the work
â€¢man's fatigue period in the afternoon
and its effect on accidents. It has been
found, he stated, that a rest of fifteen
minutes at this period lessens the
number of accidents.
