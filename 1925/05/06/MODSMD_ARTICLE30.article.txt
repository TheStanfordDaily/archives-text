# Dr. Lewis M. Terman Publishes Study of Child Mental Traits
## 
### Calvin Behle 
Intellectually superior children are
not puny, sickly freaks, "different"
from other boys and girls. Besides
being better equipped mentally than
their "average" or "normal" play
mates, young geniuses have also bet
ter bodies and better health as a class,
take a natural interest in play and
games, and in their school work ex
hibit nothing mysterious or strange.
They differ from their fellows by a
general superiority all along the line
and not by any alarming eccentricities
such as are commonly believed to ac
company precocity.
This is a rough and partial summary
of the findings of detailed and exten
sive studies of about 1,000 California
children who rank intellectually with
in the top 1 per cent of the unselected
school population of corresponding age
that have been carried on by Profes
sor Lewis M. Terman, head of the
Department of Psychology of Stanford
University. The results of these
studies have been published in a 648-
page volume entitled, "Genetic Studies
of Genius, Vol. 1," by Professor Ter
man and his fourteen associates, is
sued from the Stanford University
Press.
Work on the research was first be
gun during the years of Dr. Terman's
graduate study, 1902-1905. In 1911
more or less systematic work was
begun at Stanford University in the
collection of data on children who had
made exceptionally high scores in a
mental test. Work progressed until in
1919 a research fellowship for the
study of gifted children was estab
lished by Stanford. In 1921 the direc
tors of the Commonwealth Fund made
a grant of $20,300 for a continuation
of the study. The following year an
additional grant of $14,000 was re
ceived from the Commonwealth Fund
and was supplemented by a contribu
tion of $8,000 in money and $6,000 in
services from Stanford University. In
cluding services, the study has cost
approximately $50',000. *'
A second volume of the study of

"Genetic Studies of Genius" will be
published next fall, entitled "Early
Mental Traits of Three Hundred
Geniuses," by Dr. Catherine M. Cox.
Volume 1 of this study deals in the
particular field entitled "Mental and
Physical Traits of a Thousand Gifted
Children." A quarter of a million Cali
fornia school children were canvassed
to select the group which is being
closely followed In the effort to obtain
as definite knowledge as possible as to
the characteristics that distinguish
young geniuses, and to determine how
these children in maturity fulfill their
early promise.
The scientific studies recorded in
this volume have much new light on
the development of genius in the
scientific studies recorded in this
volume. Evidence seems to refute sev
eral opinions which scientists have
heretofore believed in this study.
The research seems to indicate that
"superior" children surpass their
schoolmates in all directions as a
group, displaying a wider range of
general information. Irregularities in
either habits or abilities do not seem
to be the marks of ability. It seems
that they differ in the general run in
degree rather than in any way that
sets them off as fundamentally differ
ent. Superiority displays itself at an
early age, though it is often over
looked by parents and teachers, and
as a result they are not given the op
portunity to display their ability in
school work, but are placed in the
same group as normal children.
These gifted children surpass others
of their age in character development
and in personality.
It is interesting to note that some
of the children who were subjects for
study fourteen or fifteen years ago at
the inception of the research investi
gations are now demonstrating that
the ability they showed as children
was fundamental and is working out
in adult brilliance. This is important
evidence in the theory that ability is
apparent at an early age, and is a
fundamental part of the human being.

This is a rough and partial summary
of the findings of detailed and exten
sive studies of about 1,000 California
children who rank intellectually with
in the top 1 per cent of the unselected
school population of corresponding age
that have been carried on by Profes
sor Lewis M. Terman, head of the
Department of Psychology of Stanford
University. The results of these
studies have been published in a 648-
page volume entitled, "Genetic Studies
of Genius, Vol. 1," by Professor Ter
man and his fourteen associates, is
sued from the Stanford University
Press.
Work on the research was first be
gun during the years of Dr. Terman's
graduate study, 1902-1905. In 1911
more or less systematic work was
begun at Stanford University in the
collection of data on children who had
made exceptionally high scores in a
mental test. Work progressed until in
1919 a research fellowship for the
study of gifted children was estab
lished by Stanford. In 1921 the direc
tors of the Commonwealth Fund made
a grant of $20,300 for a continuation
of the study. The following year an
additional grant of $14,000 was re
ceived from the Commonwealth Fund
and was supplemented by a contribu
tion of $8,000 in money and $6,000 in
services from Stanford University. In
cluding services, the study has cost
approximately $50',000. *'
A second volume of the study of

"Genetic Studies of Genius" will be
published next fall, entitled "Early
Mental Traits of Three Hundred
Geniuses," by Dr. Catherine M. Cox.
Volume 1 of this study deals in the
particular field entitled "Mental and
Physical Traits of a Thousand Gifted
Children." A quarter of a million Cali
fornia school children were canvassed
to select the group which is being
closely followed In the effort to obtain
as definite knowledge as possible as to
the characteristics that distinguish
young geniuses, and to determine how
these children in maturity fulfill their
early promise.
The scientific studies recorded in
this volume have much new light on
the development of genius in the
scientific studies recorded in this
volume. Evidence seems to refute sev
eral opinions which scientists have
heretofore believed in this study.
The research seems to indicate that
"superior" children surpass their
schoolmates in all directions as a
group, displaying a wider range of
general information. Irregularities in
either habits or abilities do not seem
to be the marks of ability. It seems
that they differ in the general run in
degree rather than in any way that
sets them off as fundamentally differ
ent. Superiority displays itself at an
early age, though it is often over
looked by parents and teachers, and
as a result they are not given the op
portunity to display their ability in
school work, but are placed in the
same group as normal children.
These gifted children surpass others
of their age in character development
and in personality.
It is interesting to note that some
of the children who were subjects for
study fourteen or fifteen years ago at
the inception of the research investi
gations are now demonstrating that
the ability they showed as children
was fundamental and is working out
in adult brilliance. This is important
evidence in the theory that ability is
apparent at an early age, and is a
fundamental part of the human being.
Intellectually superior children are
not puny, sickly freaks, "different"
from other boys and girls. Besides
being better equipped mentally than
their "average" or "normal" play
mates, young geniuses have also bet
ter bodies and better health as a class,
take a natural interest in play and
games, and in their school work ex
hibit nothing mysterious or strange.
They differ from their fellows by a
general superiority all along the line
and not by any alarming eccentricities
such as are commonly believed to ac
company precocity.
