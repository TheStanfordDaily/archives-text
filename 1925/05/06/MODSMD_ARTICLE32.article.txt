the subject chosen by Professor Tat-1
lock to discuss at the meeting of the j
Faculty Research Club this evening.!
It deals with an account of a marvel-!
ous and supernatural experience of a 1
twelfth century bishop told in differ
ent forms in several historical docu- 1
ments of the Middle Ages.
It is probable that the story origi
nated from an actual experience and
was re-written at various intervals for j
the purpose of stimulating piety. Dif-j
ferent manuscripts have been traced
from time contemporary with the 1
bishop's life, and reveal the growth of J
the story through exaggeration in
order to give a pious effect.
The other paper to be presented at

sion of "Hereditary factors in the Con-1
stitution."

Two students at the University of

ing in Lake Washington when their
canoe upset and threw them into the
icy water. The two men were taking a
1 a.m. paddle around the lake and in
trying to pass between a tug and a
scow that it was towing, were upset
by n towing cable. The scow passed
entirely over both canoeists and but
for the quick rescue made by two men
in a nearby houseboat the students
would have been drowned.
