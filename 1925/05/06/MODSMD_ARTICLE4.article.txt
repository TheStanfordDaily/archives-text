# BORG SWIMS IN CROSS-LAGUNITA RACE SATURDAY
## 
### 
Arne Borg, world's premier mid
dle-distance swimmer, will swim in
a special handicap trans-Lagunita
race as an attraction on the water
sports program for Junior Week
next Saturday.
Pitted against the pick of the var
sity swimmers who will be given a
forty second handicap against the
Swedish ace, Borg is expected to
uncork some speed. The varsity
men will be battling for the title
of cross-lake swimming champion.
The course is approximately a
quarter mile and the finish will be
at the boathouse pier. The present
intercollegiate record in the 440-
yard event is 5:18, held by Haw
kins of Princeton.
Entries for the Swedish Mara
thon have been pouring in to the
tour class captains. The relay will
be in the form of an interclass race,
each team swimming fifteen men
who will swim fifty yards apiece.
From the present list of entries
the sophomores and seniors are
given the edge in this race. The
majority of the entries from both
of these classes swim the fifty-yard
race under :30. The freshmen may
come in with a strong team con
sidering the number that have been
trying out for berths on the relay.
