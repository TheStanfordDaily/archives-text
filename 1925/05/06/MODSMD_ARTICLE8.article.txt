# GRACE BORROUGHS PRESENTS PROGRAM
## Assisted by Betty McPherson And Louise Marleau In Interpreation 
### Hulda Hoover 
The excellent work of Mrs. Grace
Borrouglis, Miss Betty McPherson, and
Miss Louise Marleau, combined to
make a thoroughly charming program
recital of interpretative dances last
night in the Assembly hall.
Mrs. Borrouglis is an artist of both
intellect and temperament. With her
refined dancing and beautiful cos
tumes she recreated the gracious at
mosphere of 17th and 18th century
days, while her modern interpretations
have the sophistication and vitality of
the modern composers whose works
she interprets.
An interesting progession in tech
nique, costuming, and relationship to
music was brought out throughout the
program. The stately grace and gor
geous costumes of the Pavane em
phasized the formality of the early
seventeenth century. The dainty and
lively gavotte showed a more playful
mood. The latent naughtiness of the
polka and the waltz were an interpre
tation of a lovely coquette.
The last three dances were oriental
impressions and were executed in a
phantastic mood made for beauty of
effect. The last dance in particular,
Dance Chinoise, was as oriental and
rich as the figures on Chinese brocade.
Miss Louise Marleau at the piano
played some pleasing numbers. The
contrasting moods of the dances were
brought out by the pieces alternated
with them.
