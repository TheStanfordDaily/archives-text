day afternoon. The result of this game
leaves Alpha Kappa Lambda, Delta
Upsilon, and El Capitan all tied for
the leadership in League VII.
Phi Gamma Delta beat Delta Kappa
Epsilon for the championship of
League V when it won its fifth straight
intramural contest by a count of 14
to 10. Delta Chi tied for second place
with the Dekes by trouncing Los
Arcos 5 to 2. Delta Tau Delta cinched
second position in League VI by tak
ing an 11 to 4 decision over Theta Chi.
A. K. L. entered the last half of
the seventh inning with the score
standing 9 to 6 against it. Cornell,
the A. K. L. pitcher, led his team in
the final winning rally by connecting
for two hits, both of which scored
runs. The fraternity team succeeded
in marking up five runs in the last
inning, thereby winning the game by
a two-run margin.
Farewell was the outstanding player
on the El Capitan team. He connected
for four hits in four attempts in addi
tion to playing an exceptionally fine
game in the field. Marsh pitched a
good game for the club team but was
given erratic support. Hardwicke and
Kellogg starred in the field for A. K. L.
Fijis Stage Rally
The Fiji-Deke contest was marked j
by free hitting and loose fielding. The
lead see-sawed throughout the game
with first one and then the other team
holding the advantage. With the count j
standing at 10 to 9 in favor of the j
Fijis in the sixth, the winners staged
a big rally in the last frame and won
the game by annexing four runs.
Grace pitched his usual good game
for the Fijis, but was a little more
liberal with base hits than is his
custom. McDonald pitched a fair brand
of ball for the Dekes but poor sup
port lost whatever chances he had to
win the game.
The game was featured by two home
runs, one for each team. Anderson
connected for one for the Dekes in
the second canto, and Grace retaliated
for the Fijis with a circuit clout in
the third. Both teams played a poor
game in the field.
Delta Chi Wins
Delta Chi took an early lead over
Los Arcos when Rutter smashed a
home run with two on in the first in
ning. The winners brought their total
to five in the fourth by annexing two
more runs. Los Arcos scored one run
in the first, and one in the third.
Hapgood pitched excellent ball for
the Delta Chis, being touched for only
three scattered hits. Hammon, the Los
Arcos hurler, was effective in every
inning but the first and fourth. Both
pitchers were given good support by
their teammates, making the game one
of the best-played contests in the
series.
Delts Are Easy Victors
Delta Tau Delta encountered little
difficulty in beating Theta Chi by an
11 to 4 count. The winners started out
with a three-run lead in the first,
added two more in the third, increased
their total by annexing five in the
fourth, and one in the fifth. Theta
Chi scored two tallies in the fourth,
and one each in the sixth and seventh.
Collett repeated his performance of
Tuesday by faninng fifteen batters.
He was effective throughout the game
with the exception of the fourth frame.
Collett also carried off batting honors
by annexing two hits out of three
times up. Housch did not exhibit much
class on the mound for the Theta Chis
and was furthermore handicapped by
inconsistent playing on the part of his
teammates.

offs for the intramural baseball cham

If A. K. L. wins from the Betas, as
is likely, the triple tie now existing
in League VII between Alpha Kappa

mine the team which will meet Sigma
Nu, winner of League 11, in the first

Capitan in a last inning rally yester
day afternoon. The result of this game

Epsilon for the championship of
League V when it won its fifth straight
intramural contest by a count of 14
to 10. Delta Chi tied for second place
with the Dekes by trouncing Los

on the El Capitan team. He connected
for four hits in four attempts in addi
tion to playing an exceptionally fine
game in the field. Marsh pitched a
good game for the club team but was
given erratic support. Hardwicke and
Kellogg starred in the field for A. K. L.
Fijis Stage Rally

by free hitting and loose fielding. The

with first one and then the other team
holding the advantage. With the count j
standing at 10 to 9 in favor of the j
Fijis in the sixth, the winners staged
a big rally in the last frame and won
the game by annexing four runs.
Grace pitched his usual good game
for the Fijis, but was a little more
liberal with base hits than is his
custom. McDonald pitched a fair brand
of ball for the Dekes but poor sup
port lost whatever chances he had to
win the game.
The game was featured by two home
runs, one for each team. Anderson
connected for one for the Dekes in
the second canto, and Grace retaliated
for the Fijis with a circuit clout in
the third. Both teams played a poor
game in the field.

A. K. L. entered the last half of
the seventh inning with the score
standing 9 to 6 against it. Cornell,
the A. K. L. pitcher, led his team in
the final winning rally by connecting
for two hits, both of which scored
runs. The fraternity team succeeded
in marking up five runs in the last
inning, thereby winning the game by
a two-run margin.
Farewell was the outstanding player
on the El Capitan team. He connected
for four hits in four attempts in addi
tion to playing an exceptionally fine
game in the field. Marsh pitched a
good game for the club team but was
given erratic support. Hardwicke and
Kellogg starred in the field for A. K. L.
Fijis Stage Rally
The Fiji-Deke contest was marked j
by free hitting and loose fielding. The
lead see-sawed throughout the game
with first one and then the other team
holding the advantage. With the count j
standing at 10 to 9 in favor of the j
Fijis in the sixth, the winners staged
a big rally in the last frame and won
the game by annexing four runs.
Grace pitched his usual good game
for the Fijis, but was a little more
liberal with base hits than is his
custom. McDonald pitched a fair brand
of ball for the Dekes but poor sup
port lost whatever chances he had to
win the game.
The game was featured by two home
runs, one for each team. Anderson
connected for one for the Dekes in
the second canto, and Grace retaliated
for the Fijis with a circuit clout in
the third. Both teams played a poor
game in the field.
Delta Chi Wins
Delta Chi took an early lead over
Los Arcos when Rutter smashed a
home run with two on in the first in
ning. The winners brought their total
to five in the fourth by annexing two
more runs. Los Arcos scored one run
in the first, and one in the third.
Hapgood pitched excellent ball for
the Delta Chis, being touched for only
three scattered hits. Hammon, the Los
Arcos hurler, was effective in every
inning but the first and fourth. Both
pitchers were given good support by
their teammates, making the game one
of the best-played contests in the
series.
Delts Are Easy Victors
Delta Tau Delta encountered little
difficulty in beating Theta Chi by an
11 to 4 count. The winners started out
with a three-run lead in the first,
added two more in the third, increased
their total by annexing five in the
fourth, and one in the fifth. Theta
Chi scored two tallies in the fourth,
and one each in the sixth and seventh.
Collett repeated his performance of
Tuesday by faninng fifteen batters.
He was effective throughout the game
with the exception of the fourth frame.
Collett also carried off batting honors
by annexing two hits out of three
times up. Housch did not exhibit much
class on the mound for the Theta Chis
and was furthermore handicapped by
inconsistent playing on the part of his
teammates.
