# JUNIOR WEEK MAKES INTERCLASS SOCCER CHANGES NECESSARY
## 
### 
The junior-sophomore interclass
game scheduled for this afternoon will
be postponed until next Tuesday on
account of the Corduroy Ball and
Junior Week festivities.
Because of the probable absence of
many of the seniors on Friday, the
day of the senior-freshman contest
has been changed to Monday. The sen
iors have not lost a game, while the
freshmen have been defeated by the
juniors. A victory for the yearlings
will mean a triple tie between the
juniors, freshmen, and seniors.
As the sophomores have not won a
game this season, the juniors are ex
pected to win Tuesday's game, and if
the freshmen win Monday they will
have a chance to win the series.
