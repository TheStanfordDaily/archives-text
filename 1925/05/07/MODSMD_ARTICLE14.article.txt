# EASTERN UNIVERSITIES USE VARYING AWARD SYSTEMS

### Fred Speers 
hi connection with the current agitation
for a reform in the present Stanford sys
tem for athletic aivards the "Daily" out
lines briefly in this article the systems
used by large universities in the East.
Distinction between major sports
either through the color scheme or by
means of small letters placed at either
side of the varsity block is a system
prevalent among eastern and middle
yestern universities.
Certain middlewestern universities
have done away with the distinction
and grant straight block "C" or "I"
as in the case of Chicago and Illinois.
The latter is an orange-colored block
"I" generally centered on a black
sweater. The University of Chicago,
Stagg's institution, uses a white block
"C" on a maroon sweater.
Distinctive Color Schemes
Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Dart
mouth all give distinctive awards for
their major sports. These institutions
have either four or five major sports:
football, basketball, baseball, track,
crew; and at Harvard, hockey. The
distinction is made in the color
scheme.
For example, at Harvard a red letter
on a black sweater is given for foot

ball, a black letter on a red sweater
for baseball, a red letter on a white
sweater for crew. The hockey "H" is
a red "H" with a narrow white border
along the edge of the felt letter. The
Crimson athletic officials make a
sharp distinction between major
awards with which a sweater is given,
and minor awards consisting only of
the felt insignia and the right to wear
them.
Block "H" Men Privileged
Block "H" men are privileged char
acters, being given choice seats at
campus performances, and extended
numerous courtesies of a similar char
acter. The major "H" may be granted
to an intercollegiate champion even
in a minor sport, as in the case of
Norria Williams in tennis and Robert
T. Jones in golf. Squash tennis is a
minor sport at Harvard.
The other extreme is a system used
generally in the Middlewest, notably
at the Universities of Chicago, Illinois,
Wisconsin, Notre Dame, and Michi
gan. This is the granting of major
sport awards to eligible participants
without distinction as to size, color, or
other arrangement.
Stagg, Maroon football mentor and
director of athletics at the University
of Chicago, reports that this system is
working out quite favorably. At a
meeting of all the members of the
coaching staff there recently all the
members of the board except two
voted that they were not in favor of
limiting awards. They expressed the
belief that the men were receiving so
little recognition for their hard work
and achievement that the awards
should be granted as liberally as pos
sible within the limits of common
sense.
Minor sports at a large number of
the eastern and middlewestern univer
sities are designated by small letters
placed to either side of the block
awards. Tennis sweaters at the Uni
versity of lowa are of the old gold
color with a black block "I" flanked
with small "T's." State tennis cham
pions are awarded the varsity block
letter. Minor sports are rewarded with
sweaters or jerseys.

The University of Oklahoma gave
a May Day celebration, having a
"Queen of the May" chosen from the
women of the uni'versity.
