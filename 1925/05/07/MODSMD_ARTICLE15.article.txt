# 1926 OPERA OPENS WITH TONIGHT'S PERFORMANCE
## 
### Herbert Klein 
A SPECIAL performance, for the benefit of off-campus patrons and others
unable to secure tickets for the Saturday night performance of "Ace
High" will be given at 8:00 tonight in the Assembly hall.
Contrast is offered not only in the chorus work, but the plot which shifts
from Hollywood to the Peruvian city of Cibola. In this town is the hostelry

Sincuidado, meaning "without care," owned by the cultured villain, Senor
Moreno. The name of the hotel, however, seems decidedly out of place,
when the five anxious Americans, headed by Fenton Barrett, in the role of
Collins, the hero, arive by airplane to save Marjorie Allen, in the role of

'Gale Windish, the lovely daughter of
the professor, from the clutches of
the dashing thief, Senor Moreno.
Jack Wiggin Is Hero
"Some are born brave, some acquire
bravery, and others have bravery
thrust upon them." The last is the
position in which Willie, played by
Jack Wiggin, finds himself at the end
of the second act, when he saves the
Americans, becomes a hero in the eyes
of the little comedienne, Velma Ran
dall, in the part of Catha.
It is in this act that campus dra
matic talent exhibits excellent man
agement in the training of villains, for
in addition to the characterization of
Moreno, made by Truman Dawes,
there are the dangerous parts of the
German Strindberg, played in his
usual convincing manner by Charles
Simons, and Pedro, a six-shooter wiz
ard, played by Lee Flood.
Dancing Costumes Brilliant
The costuming for the dances, espe
cially those of the Peruvian scenes, is
brilliant and colorful and combined
with the new and original dancing
gives a pageant-like effect. A real
tango is performed as an opener to
the South American scene by Byron
Harvey and Helen Stewart, assisted
by a large dancing chorus.
The dance of the six Peruvian gen
erals is another that has attracted
much favorable comment. The six
dancers keep together almost perfect
ly and their military antics are origi
nal, to say the least.
The mummy dance in act one fea
tures the work of Bert Harger, for
many years with Theodore Koslof's
Russian ballet. Harger is marvelously
agile, considering that he takes the
part of an Inca mummy embalmed a
thousand years at least.


An exciting moment in "Ace High," the Junior Opera to be presented tonight
and Saturday night in the Assembly hall. Left to right: Fenton Barrett,
Marjorie Allen, George Bogue, John Truman, Lafe Brown, Patrice Nauman,
Truman Dawes, Velma Randall, John Wiggin

usual convincing manner by Charles
Simons, and Pedro, a six-shooter wiz
ard, played by Lee Flood.
Dancing Costumes Brilliant
The costuming for the dances, espe
cially those of the Peruvian scenes, is
brilliant and colorful and combined
with the new and original dancing
gives a pageant-like effect. A real
tango is performed as an opener to
the South American scene by Byron
Harvey and Helen Stewart, assisted
by a large dancing chorus.
The dance of the six Peruvian gen
erals is another that has attracted
much favorable comment. The six
dancers keep together almost perfect
ly and their military antics are origi
nal, to say the least.
The mummy dance in act one fea
tures the work of Bert Harger, for
many years with Theodore Koslof's
Russian ballet. Harger is marvelously
agile, considering that he takes the
part of an Inca mummy embalmed a
thousand years at least.


An exciting moment in "Ace High," the Junior Opera to be presented tonight
and Saturday night in the Assembly hall. Left to right: Fenton Barrett,
Marjorie Allen, George Bogue, John Truman, Lafe Brown, Patrice Nauman,
Truman Dawes, Velma Randall, John Wiggin
A SPECIAL performance, for the benefit of off-campus patrons and others
unable to secure tickets for the Saturday night performance of "Ace
High" will be given at 8:00 tonight in the Assembly hall.
Contrast is offered not only in the chorus work, but the plot which shifts
from Hollywood to the Peruvian city of Cibola. In this town is the hostelry

Sincuidado, meaning "without care," owned by the cultured villain, Senor
Moreno. The name of the hotel, however, seems decidedly out of place,
when the five anxious Americans, headed by Fenton Barrett, in the role of
Collins, the hero, arive by airplane to save Marjorie Allen, in the role of

'Gale Windish, the lovely daughter of
the professor, from the clutches of
the dashing thief, Senor Moreno.
Jack Wiggin Is Hero
"Some are born brave, some acquire
bravery, and others have bravery
thrust upon them." The last is the
position in which Willie, played by
Jack Wiggin, finds himself at the end
of the second act, when he saves the
Americans, becomes a hero in the eyes
of the little comedienne, Velma Ran
dall, in the part of Catha.
It is in this act that campus dra
matic talent exhibits excellent man
agement in the training of villains, for
in addition to the characterization of
Moreno, made by Truman Dawes,
there are the dangerous parts of the
German Strindberg, played in his
usual convincing manner by Charles
Simons, and Pedro, a six-shooter wiz
ard, played by Lee Flood.
