# Rushing

### 
There seems to be a precedent which demands an editorial upon rush
ing about this time of the year. This advice ordinarily serves two pur
poses; that of giving the rushees one of the other viewpoints and that of
making the editor unpopular. Gather 'round promptly, therefore, and
let's go, friends.
Freshmen must determine whether or not they care to join a fraternity,
not any fraternity. Different fraternities appear to have different pur
poses. In considering the desirability of selefcting a definite fellowship
instead of remaining independent, the individual fraternity is important.
It's not entirely a question of fraternity versus non-fraternity.
It is quite conceivable and commendable that men will remain non
organization men for the reason that a particular group may not consider
itself so congenial as they think. What both the houses and the freshmen
decide each rushing season is who shall be happy living together. Opin
ion varies as to what this consists of.
One group may have a definite impression that the most desirable men
to live with are those who are athletically inclined. Another tong may
insist upon having a moral code in common. Dramatics flock together at
one place, debaters at another. Social beacons often find tastes in com
mon. Intelligences like contact with similar intelligences. This is the ideal
situation.
Some houses approach "type" more nearly than others. Certain
groups prefer to maintain a diversity of interest among members, consid
ering personalities before reputations, and will have no "type" at all. Few
fraternities, like artists, entirely realize their aims. But they have aims,
and a measure of success which concerns them and their rushees immedi
ately.
There is no sense in going to only one source for advice. It is only
by a combination of prejudices that the new men can make a respectable
decision. Fraternity men give one sort of information, non-organization
men give another, professors give another, barbers give another. Every
body except the University authorities definitely recommends. The Dean
of Men, who gets paid for advising, urges men to live where they will be
happiest.
The Dean of Men is right. Whatever the spellbinders say, a man has
to live with the companions he chooses. This involves contact with men
from other universities, for fraternities have a national significance.
Sometimes there is disagreement between chapters. This is not so serious,
however, as division in a house. There are more things than one which
make for pleasant concord.
Permanence of friendly reciprocity is the characteristic of fraternal
organization. Fluidity of fellowships, perhaps every bit as strong, is to
be found in "independence." Wherever one lives, he gives consideration
to others in exchange for similar consideration of his own wishes. What
ever one elects to do about joining a group, he may be sure that he has a
social duty in any case. Just as married life and bachelorhood have dis
tinct advantages, so have fraternity and non-fraternity lives. And, simi
larly, there are compensating influences to be weighed. A freshman
should be every bit as discriminating as a wooer in deciding on his taste.
The rushing system has been designed to allow all rushees a visit to as
many houses as possible in order that he may draw his conclusions from
prima facie evidence. The prospective pledge should make arrangements
to do this very thing. If dates conflict, adjust them.
Get around. Know what you're doing, whatever it is. And remember
that a friend is a friend, in any case.

poses; that of giving the rushees one of the other viewpoints and that of
making the editor unpopular. Gather 'round promptly, therefore, and
let's go, friends.
Freshmen must determine whether or not they care to join a fraternity,
not any fraternity. Different fraternities appear to have different pur
poses. In considering the desirability of selefcting a definite fellowship
instead of remaining independent, the individual fraternity is important.
It's not entirely a question of fraternity versus non-fraternity.
It is quite conceivable and commendable that men will remain non
organization men for the reason that a particular group may not consider
itself so congenial as they think. What both the houses and the freshmen
decide each rushing season is who shall be happy living together. Opin
ion varies as to what this consists of.
One group may have a definite impression that the most desirable men
to live with are those who are athletically inclined. Another tong may
insist upon having a moral code in common. Dramatics flock together at
one place, debaters at another. Social beacons often find tastes in com
mon. Intelligences like contact with similar intelligences. This is the ideal
situation.
Some houses approach "type" more nearly than others. Certain
groups prefer to maintain a diversity of interest among members, consid
ering personalities before reputations, and will have no "type" at all. Few
fraternities, like artists, entirely realize their aims. But they have aims,
and a measure of success which concerns them and their rushees immedi
ately.
There is no sense in going to only one source for advice. It is only
by a combination of prejudices that the new men can make a respectable
decision. Fraternity men give one sort of information, non-organization
men give another, professors give another, barbers give another. Every
body except the University authorities definitely recommends. The Dean
of Men, who gets paid for advising, urges men to live where they will be
happiest.
The Dean of Men is right. Whatever the spellbinders say, a man has
to live with the companions he chooses. This involves contact with men
from other universities, for fraternities have a national significance.
Sometimes there is disagreement between chapters. This is not so serious,
however, as division in a house. There are more things than one which
make for pleasant concord.
Permanence of friendly reciprocity is the characteristic of fraternal
organization. Fluidity of fellowships, perhaps every bit as strong, is to
be found in "independence." Wherever one lives, he gives consideration
to others in exchange for similar consideration of his own wishes. What
ever one elects to do about joining a group, he may be sure that he has a
social duty in any case. Just as married life and bachelorhood have dis
tinct advantages, so have fraternity and non-fraternity lives. And, simi
larly, there are compensating influences to be weighed. A freshman
should be every bit as discriminating as a wooer in deciding on his taste.
The rushing system has been designed to allow all rushees a visit to as
many houses as possible in order that he may draw his conclusions from
prima facie evidence. The prospective pledge should make arrangements
to do this very thing. If dates conflict, adjust them.
Get around. Know what you're doing, whatever it is. And remember
that a friend is a friend, in any case.
There seems to be a precedent which demands an editorial upon rush
ing about this time of the year. This advice ordinarily serves two pur
poses; that of giving the rushees one of the other viewpoints and that of
making the editor unpopular. Gather 'round promptly, therefore, and
let's go, friends.
