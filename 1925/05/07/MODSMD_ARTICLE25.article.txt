## A 						DISCONCERTION ON SYLLABUS FEES 
### Steve O'Donnell 
Syllabus fees are like cyclones; they
come when least expected, leaving
desolation and desperation in their
path.
How could we manage to get along
without our syllabus fees. If everyone
were not given the opportunity to
practice standing in line once in a
while, he would get out of training
before the next quarter.
First the administration shows stu
dents how little they have accom
plished by advertising it in the bawl
out; then two weeks later, they charge
them for it.
Cabbages suggests that a guessing
contest on the amount of syllabus fees
be held. Each one will be allowed to
guess the amount of his own fees or
anyone else's he wants to and any
person or persons coming nearer than
twenty dollars to the right amount
will be awarded a brussels sprout
pickled in turpentine.
Anyone having a syllabus fees of
less than one dollar should be admit
ted to the bar or sent to the poor
house.
Formula for paying syllabus fees:
1. Make check payable to Stanford
University.
2. Stand in line, first on left foot, then
on head.
3. Give cashier check. Be sure you
obtain receipt.
4. Take first car to your bank.
5. Absent-mindedly make out check
for your entire balance, including
syllabus fees.
6. Cash check. Be sure to get the
money.
7. Take first car back to University.
8. Assume blank expression, walk into
president's office and ask for Czar
of Russia, in a dramatic voice.
Hang by one toe from the railing
around the balcony in the Admin
istration building. Draw out all
the books in the library. Wear a
dink. (Other stunts optional.)
9. When the keepers come for you be
sure to have selected your blank
est expression beforehand.
10. Anyway, you don't have to pay
syllabus fees in an asylum.
Instead of "This notice must be pre
sented to the cashier, etc.," the fol
lowing should be placed at the top of
the syllabus fee statement:
"This notice must be cashed as a
present at the Accounting Department.
"Fees are due but not payable on
any day except Wednesday, May Bth
(7:30 p.m. to 5 a.m.) after which an
additional award of $2.00 will be made
(except in cases where the bottles
are empty the beer will be fine). Any
one who has not paid their fee by
May 13th will be given a diploma free
of charge.
"No questions will be asked or an
swered.' —M. D. E.

Students in carpentry at the Oregon
Agricultural College build model
houses as a part of their regular
work. When completed these mina
ture houses embody all the features of
a full-size dwelling and are sold as
plahouses for children.
Syllabus fees are like cyclones; they
come when least expected, leaving
desolation and desperation in their
path.
How could we manage to get along
without our syllabus fees. If everyone
were not given the opportunity to
practice standing in line once in a
while, he would get out of training
before the next quarter.
First the administration shows stu
dents how little they have accom
plished by advertising it in the bawl
out; then two weeks later, they charge
them for it.
Cabbages suggests that a guessing
contest on the amount of syllabus fees
be held. Each one will be allowed to
guess the amount of his own fees or
anyone else's he wants to and any
person or persons coming nearer than
twenty dollars to the right amount
will be awarded a brussels sprout
pickled in turpentine.
Anyone having a syllabus fees of
less than one dollar should be admit
ted to the bar or sent to the poor
house.
Formula for paying syllabus fees:
1. Make check payable to Stanford
University.
2. Stand in line, first on left foot, then

3. Give cashier check. Be sure you
obtain receipt.
4. Take first car to your bank.
5. Absent-mindedly make out check
for your entire balance, including
syllabus fees.
