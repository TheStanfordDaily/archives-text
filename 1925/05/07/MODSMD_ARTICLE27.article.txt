# IDEAS ON COURSE IN CITIZENSHIP ARE GIVEN BY ROBINSON

"To help In forming those habits of
mind and temper upon which, along
with the knowledge of right factors,
the soundness of opinion depends" is.
the duty of the university, according
to John Morley. This definition was
foremost in the minds of Stanford
authorities when the present course in
citizenship for freshmen was insti
tuted, and also in that of Professor E.
E. Robinson, by whom the course was
planned and outlined.
About 1920 it was attempted to give
a general introduction to college
courses and an idea of the needs of
citizenship, by requiring twelve units
of economic, social, and political prob
lems in the lower division. But this
did not prove satisfactory, so an actual
course in citizenship was outlined to
take in a hasty survey of past and
present problems in economics, politi
cal science, history, and law. Stanford
is not alone in this movement, as there
are thirty-one colleges and universi
ties, mostly in the East, which now
have a similar course. However, Stan
ford, Columbia, and Dartmouth are
given credit as the pioneers. Univer
sity of Chicago has a series of lec
tures on somewhat the same lines,
giving an introduction to many sub
jects and an idea of the requirements
of citizens, but these lectures are
given only to a group of sixty students,
selected out of the whole freshman
class; so that the great majority of
students do not benefit by it at all.
Dartmouth has taken up merely the
study of problems involved and Colum
bia makes a review of the history of
civilization. Stanford has combined
both the historical and present-day
problems into three divisions, one divi
sion given each quarter of the fresh
man year, as follows: the bases of
civilization; political equipment of the
citizen; and political, economical, and
social institutions and problems. Dis
cussion groups of thirty students each
are held, in addition to the lectures, in
order to develop original thought and
active discussion by the students
themselves.
Professor Robinson is in the History
department, and has been in charge
of the citizenship course since its
adoption. He considers that the col
lege graduate is the one to whom the
rest of the public look for carrying
the main weight of government and
that it is therefore necessary to give
him, as early as possible in his college
career, an idea of what a citizen's re
sponsibilities and duties are. He says,
"It is conceivable that we have a duty
to attempt to produce a larger social
asset, to widen the non-professional
and non-individual horizon of the stu
dent, on the theory that an enlarge
ment of view has an important part
in the preliminary steps in the educa
tion of mature men and women."
The purpose of the course is orienta
tion; not training. He outlines the
three factors to this end as: a definite
conception of the physical and histori
cal bases of present-day civilization;
a clear understanding of the funda
mentals of economic, social, and politi
cal structures; and finally, the realiza
tion of the opportunities and responsi
bilities of the educated man or woman
in the modern community.

the duty of the university, according
to John Morley. This definition was
foremost in the minds of Stanford
authorities when the present course in
citizenship for freshmen was insti
tuted, and also in that of Professor E.
E. Robinson, by whom the course was
planned and outlined.
About 1920 it was attempted to give
a general introduction to college
courses and an idea of the needs of
citizenship, by requiring twelve units
of economic, social, and political prob
lems in the lower division. But this
did not prove satisfactory, so an actual
course in citizenship was outlined to
take in a hasty survey of past and
present problems in economics, politi
cal science, history, and law. Stanford
is not alone in this movement, as there
are thirty-one colleges and universi
ties, mostly in the East, which now
have a similar course. However, Stan
ford, Columbia, and Dartmouth are
given credit as the pioneers. Univer
sity of Chicago has a series of lec
tures on somewhat the same lines,
giving an introduction to many sub
jects and an idea of the requirements
of citizens, but these lectures are
given only to a group of sixty students,
selected out of the whole freshman
class; so that the great majority of
students do not benefit by it at all.
Dartmouth has taken up merely the
study of problems involved and Colum
bia makes a review of the history of
civilization. Stanford has combined
both the historical and present-day
problems into three divisions, one divi
sion given each quarter of the fresh
man year, as follows: the bases of
civilization; political equipment of the
citizen; and political, economical, and
social institutions and problems. Dis
cussion groups of thirty students each
are held, in addition to the lectures, in
order to develop original thought and
active discussion by the students
themselves.
Professor Robinson is in the History
department, and has been in charge
of the citizenship course since its
adoption. He considers that the col
lege graduate is the one to whom the
rest of the public look for carrying
the main weight of government and
that it is therefore necessary to give
him, as early as possible in his college
career, an idea of what a citizen's re
sponsibilities and duties are. He says,
"It is conceivable that we have a duty
to attempt to produce a larger social
asset, to widen the non-professional
and non-individual horizon of the stu
dent, on the theory that an enlarge
ment of view has an important part
in the preliminary steps in the educa
tion of mature men and women."
The purpose of the course is orienta
tion; not training. He outlines the
three factors to this end as: a definite
conception of the physical and histori
cal bases of present-day civilization;
a clear understanding of the funda
mentals of economic, social, and politi
cal structures; and finally, the realiza
tion of the opportunities and responsi
bilities of the educated man or woman
