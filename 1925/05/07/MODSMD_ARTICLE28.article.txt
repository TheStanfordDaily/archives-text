# SWALLOW GROUP IS SUBJECT OF STUDY
## 
### 
A community of cliff swallows dwell
ing in the court behind the German
building is being made a subject of
study by a group of students in Pro
fessor Snyder's vertebrates class. This
group, headed by Harold H. Greene,
has banded some of the birds and is
investigating the structure of the mud
nests.
Some sixty nests have been built by
the swallows in this particular corner
of the Quad, and new ones are in pro
cess of construction under the eaves.
The nests are begun as mere gobs of
mud carried in the birds' beaks, but
are finally plastered together to form
a hollowed-out house of mud with a
small projecting opening.
Removable boards have been placed
against the wall just beneath the
eaves, and several nests have already
been built upon them. By this means
the nests may be taken down apd their
construction studied. Photographs of
the nests in different stages of con
struction have also been taken.
Numbered bands furnished by the
Government have been placed on a
number of the birds. Other birds
banded by the University have re
turned year after year. Then also it
is desired to find out where the swal
lows migrate in the winter. The cliff
swallow usually goes to Central or
South America during the cold
weather.
