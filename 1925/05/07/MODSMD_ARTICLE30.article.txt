# JEWEL FUND STORY SYMBOLIZED UPON LIBRARY BOOKPLATE
## 
### Marshall Somerville 
"The story of the Stanford Univer
sity bookplate, one of the most inter
esting tales concerning the University,
is probably known by fewer students
| than any other in annals'of the insti
j tution.
The Jewel Fund Bookplate, which is
the official title of the plate adorning
the Stanford volumes, occupies a high
place in American college bookplates
both in its beauty in design and in the
story seen in the graceful drawing by
i E. H. Blashfield. This beautiful design
j is familiar to every Stanford student,
j Athene, the goddess of learning, pano
j plied in her helmet and coat of mail,
I is seated to the left of the picture in
I a portico, her owl-escutcheoned shield
i at her side, scroll and laurel at her
I feet. Before her kneels Clio, muse of
I history, offering a casket of jewels in
return for which Athene is conferring
the winged statue palm and wreath,
emblematic of victory.
Jewel Fund Symbolized
The famous story of the jewels—
how Mrs. Stanford sacrificed the last
of her possessions, her jewels, to pro
mote the University when it was met
by reverses establishing the "Jewel
Fund" is also told by this famous
bookplate. This story of the jewels so
interested Blashfield that he made his
first attempt in this act of art, con
fining himself for the first time to the
small space offered by a bookplate.
Blashfield has woven into the old story
of struggle and sacrifice for knowledge
told by the jewels a new theme which
predominates his composition—that of
victory. The success of Mrs. Stanford's
unselfish devotion to the University
are pictured by the great painter in
the emblem of victory which knowl
edge is conferring upon Clio, the muse
of history.
Edwin Howland Blashfield is one of
the great mural painters of the twen
tieth century. His work upon the great
central dome of the congressional
library is one of America's great mural
works and it was the remarkable story
of the foundation of the Stanford li
brary alone that drew him away from
his colors and great wall paintings to
make the famous bookplate. The first
specifications for the plate called for
engraving, but Blashfield decided that
the severe black and white of an en
graving would be unsatisfactory and
chose the softer tones of a charcoal
drawing to give expression to the
work. His design was immediately ac
cepted by the board of trustees as the
bookplate of the newly created library
made possible by the Jewel Fund.
| The bookplate was accepted in 1910
' shortly after the fund of $500,000 had
been set aside for a permanent library
which has an annual income of $20,000.
All of the books in tHe University
which .have been purchased by this
fund bear this plate, as well as several
L ■ ■

others which were in possession of
the library at the time the fund was
created.
Another interesting bookplate is the
Syllabus Fund Library plate, a product
from the hand of Pedro Lemos, curator
of the University museum and art
gallery. This marker is of a simple
and dignified design having the stately
Palo Alto Tree as its central object.
This plate is placed upon all of the
books of the rapidly growing collec
tion in the reference room on the
lower floor particularly in the citizen
ship and history reference sections.
The Hoover War Library has an
adaptation of the Palo Alto Tree as a
part of its bookplate design, as did
one of the older'bookplates of the Uni
versity which was used previous to
the establishment of the Jewel Fund
bookplate.

Another interesting bookplate is the
Syllabus Fund Library plate, a product
from the hand of Pedro Lemos, curator
of the University museum and art

and dignified design having the stately
Palo Alto Tree as its central object.
This plate is placed upon all of the
books of the rapidly growing collec

lower floor particularly in the citizen
ship and history reference sections.

Jewel Fund Symbolized
The famous story of the jewels—
how Mrs. Stanford sacrificed the last
of her possessions, her jewels, to pro
mote the University when it was met
by reverses establishing the "Jewel
Fund" is also told by this famous
bookplate. This story of the jewels so
interested Blashfield that he made his
first attempt in this act of art, con
fining himself for the first time to the
small space offered by a bookplate.
Blashfield has woven into the old story
of struggle and sacrifice for knowledge
told by the jewels a new theme which
predominates his composition—that of
victory. The success of Mrs. Stanford's
unselfish devotion to the University
are pictured by the great painter in
the emblem of victory which knowl
edge is conferring upon Clio, the muse
of history.
Edwin Howland Blashfield is one of
the great mural painters of the twen
tieth century. His work upon the great
central dome of the congressional
library is one of America's great mural
works and it was the remarkable story
of the foundation of the Stanford li
brary alone that drew him away from
his colors and great wall paintings to
make the famous bookplate. The first
specifications for the plate called for
engraving, but Blashfield decided that
the severe black and white of an en
graving would be unsatisfactory and
chose the softer tones of a charcoal
drawing to give expression to the
work. His design was immediately ac
cepted by the board of trustees as the
bookplate of the newly created library
made possible by the Jewel Fund.
| The bookplate was accepted in 1910
' shortly after the fund of $500,000 had
been set aside for a permanent library
which has an annual income of $20,000.
