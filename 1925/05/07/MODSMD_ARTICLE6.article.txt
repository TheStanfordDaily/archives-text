# COMMITTEE SELECTS MIDDLETON-BOLTON PLAY AS 1925 FARCE
## 
### 
"Polly With a Past," a Clever com
edy drama, that has had a succesful
run of more than a year in New York
and London, will be staged in the
Assembly hall in June by the Senior
Farce committee, it was announced
yesterday.
The play is by George Middleton and
Guy Bolton, who are also responsible
for several well-known plays produced
in the past decade, among them being
"Adam and Eva."
Tryouts for places in the cast will
begin Monday. Those desiring parts
on the cast, which is especially well
balanced, may report for their trials in
the Assembly hall from 3 to 5 in the
afternoon, and from 7 to 10 o'clock in
the evening.
The play has a strong woman's lead,
but nevertheless there are such a
variety of characters that several
types will find excellent opportunity
to fit themselves to parts. The tryouts
will be under the direction of Charles
Parks, who is also the director of â€¢the
play, due to the fact that Gordon Davis
will be in New York at that time. The
members of the senior farce commit
tee, in addition to Parks, are Ellen
Callendar, Horace Allison, Lloyd
Davies, and Alan Robertson,
