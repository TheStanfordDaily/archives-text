Because of a conflict with the state
high school track meet scheduled for
tomorrow afternoon, the lake sports
will be held at 10 o'clock in the morn
ing, instead of at the time previously
announced.
The main event of the morning will
he the cross-lake swim in which only
Stanford students are eligible to com
pete. Wallace O'Connor now holds the
title over the quarter-mile course, but
his record may fall tomorrow. The
race ends at the boathouse where the
judges and timers will be stationed.
Next in importance to the cross-lake
swim is the Swedish Marathon, being
introduced for the first time. Each
class will enter a fifteen-man team
with each man swimming fifty yards.
A large loving cup will be presented to
the class winning the relay.
Arne Borg will try for a world's
record over a half-mile course. Borg's
competition will be a Stanford relay
team. There will also be some fancy
high diving by the best men in this
section.
The canoe races will be over a tri
angular course, and each canoe will
be handled by two men, but in the
skiff race only one person will be al
lowed in the rowboats. Canoe-tilting
I
contests will furnish some -amusement j
for the audience while an aquaplaning
stunt will give them a few thrills of a
new variety.
Palo Alto merchants have offered j
merchandise orders for the winner of
each event.
