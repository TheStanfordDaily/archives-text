# SECOND PRESENTATION OF OPERA TOMORROW
## Showing of "Ace High" Will End Program Arranged for Spring Celebration of Juniors 
### Herbert Klein 
((ACE HIGH" had its initial presentation in the Assembly hall last night
** before an appreciative audience drawn from Palo Alto and nearby cities,
and now lacks only a few touches before the final production Saturday night.
Over sixty-five people, the largest number ever assembled for a campus
show, appear in "Ace High."
Junior Opera is fortunate in having a plot that permits many specialty
numbers to be introduced. Webster Street has written a story that provides
about as many contrasts as can be gotten into two acts. When the setting

shifts from the Hollywood locale of the first act to the midst ot Peru in the
second, the interest of the story is greatly intensified by its brand new setting.
Three threads comprise the plot. Two of them are love stories and one the
tale of Professor Windish and his disappearing Inca relics. The main love
interest centers in Collins, the aviator and hero, from whom the opera draws
'its name, and Gale Windish, the professor's daughter. These parts are taken

I respectively. Marjorie Allen starred in
! last year's Junior Opera while Barrett
I is making his debut at Stanford. He
i has an excellent baritone voice and
j considerable dramatic ability.
The other couple is Willie and Catha,
played by J. L. Wiggin and Velma Ran
dall. Their adventures and troubles
furnish a large part of the comic re
lief of the production and provide
some of its heartiest laughs.
Perhaps the most indispensable
character in the entire story is R. T.

little or 110 action, for it is liis sinister
activities that mix up things and fur
nish the disturbing factor. For a while
it looks as though he would utterly
break up the peaceful Hollywood home.
The tables are turned when the Holly
wood dwellers hop down to his not-so
peaceful abode in Peru via airplane
and create a little disturbance there.
Moreno is the sort of villain that is
sure to get a little sympathy because
of his swagger and nonchalance. An
other bad man whose manner prevents
him from being too unpopular is
Strindberg, played by C. C. Simons.
His accent and lines are among the
funniest things in act two.
The part of a cross-word puzzle
maniac helps put surprises and thrills
into the first act and is taken by L. T.
Browne. This unfortunate has suc
cumbed to the pernicious puzzles to
such an extent that the theft of the
priceless Inca treasure, the abduction
of the professor's daughter, and the
robbery of Collin's airplane cannot
check his perpetual word hunting.
One of the most spectacular parts of
the production is the dancing. This
was entirely supervised and directed
by Clirysella Dunker, who recently re
turned from a visit to New York.
While there she studied practically
every production 011 the boards in
which there was dancing or chorus
work, so she has been able to arrange
the very latest in steps for the opera.
Music was chosen from the large
number of manuscribts submitted by
Fred Tyroler, musical director of the
show. Between the opening chorus and
the finale are many tuneful numbers.
