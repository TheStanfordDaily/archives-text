# SECOND PRESENTATION OF OPERA TOMORROW
## Showing of "Ace High" Will End Program Arranged for Spring Celebration of Juniors 
### Herbert Klein 
((ACE HIGH" had its initial presentation in the Assembly hall last night
** before an appreciative audience drawn from Palo Alto and nearby cities,
and now lacks only a few touches before the final production Saturday night.
Over sixty-five people, the largest number ever assembled for a campus
show, appear in "Ace High."
Junior Opera is fortunate in having a plot that permits many specialty
numbers to be introduced. Webster Street has written a story that provides
about as many contrasts as can be gotten into two acts. When the setting

shifts from the Hollywood locale of the first act to the midst ot Peru in the
second, the interest of the story is greatly intensified by its brand new setting.
Three threads comprise the plot. Two of them are love stories and one the
tale of Professor Windish and his disappearing Inca relics. The main love
interest centers in Collins, the aviator and hero, from whom the opera draws
'its name, and Gale Windish, the professor's daughter. These parts are taken

S>by F. A. Barrett and Marjorie Allen,
I respectively. Marjorie Allen starred in
! last year's Junior Opera while Barrett
I is making his debut at Stanford. He
i has an excellent baritone voice and
j considerable dramatic ability.
The other couple is Willie and Catha,
played by J. L. Wiggin and Velma Ran
dall. Their adventures and troubles
furnish a large part of the comic re
lief of the production and provide
some of its heartiest laughs.
Perhaps the most indispensable
character in the entire story is R. T.
j Dawes, taking the role of Senor
I Moreno, the polished Castilian "gentle
| man." Without him there would be
