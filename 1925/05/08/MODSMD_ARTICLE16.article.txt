# HIGH SCHOOL TRACK IN ASSEMBLE FOR STATE CHAMPIONSHIP
## Many Records Should Go by Boards in Tomorrow's Competition 
### Wallace Knox 
Some record-breaking performances
will be on the boards at the State
High School track and field meet in
j the Stanford stadium at 2 o'clock to
morrow afternoon. More than 100 ath
j letes from prep schools all over the
state have qualified for the California
classic and will be out to wii) places
j for themselves on the teams which go
J to the National Interscholastic meet
| at Chicago.
j Probably the most interesting com
| petition will be in the pole vault, when
j Hulsman of San Jose will be trying to
| out-vault Williams of Inglewood. The
| latter broke the world's interscholastic
record last week when he cleared the
bar at 13 feet 1 5-6 inches. Hulsman
has been supreme in the North Coast
section all year, and has never really
been tested. His teammates are confi
dent that he can also get over the 13-
foot marker if pressed.
Herbert Fleishhacker, Jr., of the
Menlo school, is a promising young
weight man. Fleishhacker tossed the
12-pound cannon ball more than 48 feet
two weeks ago for a uew North Coast
record. He can also heave the discus
out around the 120-foot line. It is ex
pected that he will win the shot with
out a great deal of difficulty. His most
dangerous competitors are Paten of
Riverside in the shot and Moeller of
San Diego in the discus. The former
did 46 feet 4 1-4 inches in the shot
and the latter did 125 feet 6 1-2 inches
in the discus at the southern section
meet last Saturday.
Two good middle-distance runners
will be on hand from the southern
section, and they are expected to set
new records in their events. Gloege
of Covina hung up a record of 1:59
4-10 in the half-mile in the southern
tryouts, while Unruh of El Monte
covered four laps in 4:29 6-10. Graff,
of Menlo, in the half, and Rosselle, of
Redwood, in the mile, are the two
best men in these races from the
North Coast section.
Ryan Strongest 440 Man
Ryan of San Mateo looks like the
money in the quarter-mile. No one in
this district has been abel to touch
him in this race all season. Hanford
of Manual Arts did :51 2-10 last week
and may be able to give Ryan a run
for his money. If he does, the boy
who wins is certain to set a new rec
ord for the "distance.
In the sprints the southern part of
the state appears to be a slight fa
vorite. Akers of Riverside is a : 10' flat
man in the century, while- Floyd of
Lincoln does around :22 1-5 in the
furlong. Schmidt of San Jose and Wil
son of Palo Alto are the North Sec
tion's hopes to outrun the southerners.
As yet no reports have been re
ceived of the entrants from the valley
district. A number of capable athletes
are certain to come from this section,
and some of these lads may be able
to upset the dope and put over a win
for their schools. Since so many men
are entered from a great number of
schools it is probable that from twenty
to twenty-five points will be sufficient
to win the meet. San Jose and Berke
ley high schools have the best chance
of the North Coast schools to place in
the big money.
Eades of Hollywood, Payne of Long
Beach, and Walker of Haramet are the
leading hurdlers from the South. The
first two named tied for first in the
low sticks last week and Eades just
nosed Walker out for first in the highs.
The times were 24 8-10 and 15 6-10.
The northern relay teams are going
to have to step. Alameda won the four
man event in the N. C. S. meet at 1:34.
Four teams were under that mark in
the South last Saturday and San
Diego made 1:30 6-10 to win and set
a new record.

The literary societies of the Univer
sity of Southern California are com
peting in debates. The prize is a silver
trophy.
