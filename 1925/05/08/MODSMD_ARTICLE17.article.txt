# LOS ARCOS GALLEY TAKES FIRST PRIZE AT LAKE CARNIVAL
## 
### 
Los Arcos, setting sail in its Span
ish galley equipped with slaves, slave
driver, king, and queen, took first
prize in the men's group of the float
processional of the Lake Carnival last
night. Delta Delta Delta won first in
the women's group with a float repre
senting a Castilian fan.
In a whaling boat, complete with the
spouting whale and Jonah, the Chi
Psis took the decision as the most
novel exhibit and were awarded the
second prize of 1000 cigarettes from
Morey's. The first prize for the men
was a silver cup given by Nielsen &
Culver, and for the women, a silver
fashion figure was donated by the
Gotham Shop.
Following the float parade, A. C.
White, world's champion diver, and
M. C. Gibbons, T. A. Smith, and San
derson Smith, a Palo Alto high school
athlete, gave an exhibition from the
second and top platforms of the boat
house. White did a one and a half, a
back dive, and back somersault from
the top, while Gibbons and Sanderson
Smith did some simultaneous swan
diving.
Music filled in intervals between the
events of the program. The Stanford
band opened the carnival with selec
tions played from the stand by the
lake. James Arthur, with his trio of
stringed instruments, serenaded the
crowd from a boat in the middle of
the lake, and a radio set in a skiff
gave music throughout the evening.
Rockets and Roman candles formed
the main part of fireworks, shooting
up from all sides of the lake and a
float in the middle. Pinwlieels, dis
played in the center of the lake,
showed up with the number "26" at
the close of the carnival.
The festivities of the week got under
way with the Corduroy Ball.
