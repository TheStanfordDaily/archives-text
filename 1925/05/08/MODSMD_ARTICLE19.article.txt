# Stanford and the High Schools
## 
### 
With the successes of the past athletic year to build upon, Stanford
has started on a constructive policy which promises great things for the
future. Students and faculty both are encouraging the program which
will place the University in front in this field as well as scholastically.
Stanford's Summer School of Physical Education has received a recog
nition which stamps the coaching staff as one of the best in the country.
Inquiries, followed by reservations, have come from coaches in all parts of
the country. Many mentors from so far a distance as the Atlantic Sea
board will travel west this summer to study the Warner method of coach
ing football, to discover the secret of Coach Templeton's success in track,
to learn the theories of such men as Maloney and Brandsten.
Many more from the Middle West and South have been drawn to
Stanford by the reputation of the Cardinal coaches. In fact, the men who
have registered from places out of the state far outnumber the instructors
situated nearby. â€¢
Yet, our prophets are not without honor in their own country. While
most of the reservations have been made by those living at a distance, hun
dreds of inquiries from local coaches have been received. Being so close
to the University, these men have delayed making their final arrangements.
Their reservations have just started to come in and the start of what prom
ises to be a huge invasion is in evidence.
The growing prominence of Stanford is attracting attention of high
school people everywhere. Competitors and coaches have visited us often
and they like to come back.
Today track athletes and coaches from all over the state are on the
campus getting ready for the most important high school meet of the year,
the California Interscholastic Federation Championships. Encina resi
dents are upholding the Stanford traditions of hospitality. The freshmen,
without doubt, will do their part, aided by the rest of the undergraduates.
