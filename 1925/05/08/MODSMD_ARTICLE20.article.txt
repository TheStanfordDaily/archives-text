## "O'MLLEY OF SHANGANAGH" 
### Donn Byrne 
The aching desolation of Ireland in
November, chill, misty, heavy with
rain, broods over the story of a love
that died because of a woman's sense
of duty. Even the happier portions of
the book, lovely, charming as they
are, carry a wistfulness and a sense
of swift-coming doom.
Ireland in summer, green and riotous
with roses, is happy, but with a hap
piness that is too great, so great that
it hurts, and it can not last. Monte
Carlo is gay, but its gaiety is hectic.
Venice is enchanting, but her enchant
ment is the fascination of the age
long, magic-bound sleep of a wizard
that has failed. Ireland in November
is dismally dreary. Her leaden skies
weep for Ireland's broken-hearted
failures. Doom is in the pounding of
the rain upon the sodden earth; doom
is in the dimness of the houses that
are sad and comfortless for lack of
care; doom is in the hearts of those
that sang and laughed in summer.
And what of the man and women in
the great house at Shanganagh? What
of the fierce old man that walked the
streets of Dublin, erect and clear of
mind, and he killing himself with the
drink the while? Did they not have a
story, a story that brings a smile with
tears rushing swiftly behind it? Yes,
and that is the story of O'Malley of
Shanganagh, but more than that, it
is the story of all of Ireland's failures,
of the soul of Ireland in her unliappi
ness. Who but an Irishman could have
told the tale; who but an Irishman
understood? Donn Bayne has told a
beautiful story, and even the vindici
tiveness of the great, grim O'Malley
that would have been noticed in any
city but in Dublin "called for no more
than a passing glance, so many are
there who seem exiled kings," carries
an Irish beauty in it.. Yes, Donn Byrne
has told a beautiful story, but more,
he has done what few men can ever
do: he has told in English what it
would have seemed could be told only
in Irish; in an alien tongue he has
expressed, truly and adequately, the
unhappy soul of Ireland, beautiful and
desolate. â€”A. H. A.
