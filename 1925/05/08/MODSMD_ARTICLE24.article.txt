# Lack of Interest Causes Union Dance Cancellation
## 
### 
Because of lack of interest and failure
of Jhe tickets to sell the Union Dance
scheduled for May 22 has been cancelled.
All who have already purchased tickets
and wish to have them refunded may do
so by seeing R. E. Herdman.
The Union will probably not hold a
dance this quarter.
