# FABLES FOR FRESHMEN
## 
### 
Once upon a time there was a Senior
who was not learned, egotistical, or ar
rogant. He didn't wear his sombrero
at an angle, nor did he survey the
mere underclassmen with a superior
smile. (No, no, my children, this isn't
all of the fable!)
Now there was also a Senior who
knew everything and knew he knew
everything. He hoped that the Univer
sity knew, too, what a great honor he
bestowed upon it by his presence. (The
University never did realize it, some
how.)
Soon these two seniors became
graduates. The years passed. Just
twenty summers after their gradua
tion these two men returned to a class
reunion. And now, of course, the gen
tle (or otherwise) reader will expect
the unobtrusive one to have received
his just desserts and risen to all pos
sible heigths, while the blustering bal
loon of a braggart will have been punc
tured by the needle of sharp experi
ence.
But, no, alas! The humble graduate
is a bookkeeper with a salary of $2000
a year, eight children, and a henpeck
ing wife. The egotistical one is head
of a large factory, has as many mil
lions as the henpecked husband has
children, and is regarded as a great
man by all those who don't know any
better, and they are greatly In the
majority.
MORAL: Great oaks from little pea
nuts grow; or, you never can tell.
