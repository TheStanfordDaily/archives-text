"Embers," now playing at the Colum
bia, shows what I-lenry Miller and
Margalo Gilmore can do with an emo
tional drama in spite of Laura Hope
Crews.
The second point of note is that
Miss Gilmore is the one actress in
every thousand who lives up to the
stock line, "When you came in that
(door, gate .skylight) you brought the
breath of (spring, summer, life) with
you." When Henry Miller tells her that
we felt like lifting our youthful voice
in a "You said it, Henry," for Henry
certainly had.
Ilka Chase, as Madame Claremont,
and Ffank Reicher as Martelet, pro
vided a delightful comedy touch.
Pierre Wolff and Henri Dyvernois
wrote the play, and now we aren't
quite sure but what the government is
being a trifle harsh with France in this
reparations business. The lines are
clever and replete with subtle humor.
And the story—ah yes, the story—it
deals with the unhappy marriage of
one Francois Laurent, portrayed by
Henry Miller, and his fine love affair
with a Parisian shop girl, played by
Margalo Gilmore.
We have neither space nor nerve
enough to sketch the plot here, but
must stop to relate a scene which oc
curs in the last act. By was of ex
planation, let it be understood that
the child of Laurent's great love is
exchanged at birth for his supposedly
legitimate son, whose father he knows
to be a philanderer named Fournier.
In the scene in question, Madame
Laurent, played by Miss Crews, is
looking offstage at the two children
(now aged six). In her ignorance of
the exchange, she says, concerning
what she supposes to be the offspring
of the shop girl, "One can see that he
is the child of a very ordinary woman."
The faint, cynical smile which
passes across the face of Monsieur
Laurent implys that it will simply be
a matter of time before he secretly
laughs himself to death over the way
in which his shallow spouse is going
to continue slandering herself.
The second and third acts are by
long odds the best in the performance.
The former is devoted largely to a
scene between Miss Gilmore and Mr.
Miller. In the third act Madame Lau
rent bears a child. This incident oc
curs offstage, and it must be admitted
that we hardly missed Miss Crews.

legitimate son, whose father he knows
to be a philanderer named Fournier.
In the scene in question, Madame
Laurent, played by Miss Crews, is
looking offstage at the two children
(now aged six). In her ignorance of
the exchange, she says, concerning
what she supposes to be the offspring
of the shop girl, "One can see that he
is the child of a very ordinary woman."
The faint, cynical smile which
passes across the face of Monsieur
Laurent implys that it will simply be
a matter of time before he secretly
laughs himself to death over the way
in which his shallow spouse is going
to continue slandering herself.
The second and third acts are by
long odds the best in the performance.
The former is devoted largely to a
scene between Miss Gilmore and Mr.
Miller. In the third act Madame Lau
rent bears a child. This incident oc
curs offstage, and it must be admitted
that we hardly missed Miss Crews.
"Embers," now playing at the Colum
bia, shows what I-lenry Miller and
Margalo Gilmore can do with an emo
tional drama in spite of Laura Hope
Crews.
The second point of note is that
Miss Gilmore is the one actress in
every thousand who lives up to the
stock line, "When you came in that
(door, gate .skylight) you brought the
breath of (spring, summer, life) with
you." When Henry Miller tells her that
we felt like lifting our youthful voice
in a "You said it, Henry," for Henry
certainly had.
Ilka Chase, as Madame Claremont,
and Ffank Reicher as Martelet, pro
vided a delightful comedy touch.
Pierre Wolff and Henri Dyvernois
wrote the play, and now we aren't
quite sure but what the government is
being a trifle harsh with France in this
reparations business. The lines are
clever and replete with subtle humor.
And the story—ah yes, the story—it
deals with the unhappy marriage of
one Francois Laurent, portrayed by
Henry Miller, and his fine love affair
with a Parisian shop girl, played by
Margalo Gilmore.
We have neither space nor nerve
enough to sketch the plot here, but
must stop to relate a scene which oc
curs in the last act. By was of ex
planation, let it be understood that
the child of Laurent's great love is
exchanged at birth for his supposedly
legitimate son, whose father he knows
to be a philanderer named Fournier.
