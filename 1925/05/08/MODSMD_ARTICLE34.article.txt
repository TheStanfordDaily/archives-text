# Aged Campus Gardener Faces Insanity Charge
## 
### 
Robert Stankovich, a gardener on the
campus, was taken to San Jose yesterday
to be tried for insanity. Stankovich has
been working at private residences and
fraternity and sorority houses on the
campus for the past four years. It is
said that he has been showing signs of
mental unbalance for sometime, but has
never reached the stage of dangerous
insanity.
The cause of Stankovich's insanity is
not definitely known; but it is believed
to be due to a blood clot on the brain.
