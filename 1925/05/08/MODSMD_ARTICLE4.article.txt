# Prom Decorations Finished Japanese Effect Secured Pavilion Becomes Garden
## 
### 
Decorations have been completed
and the stage is set for the Junior
Prom scheduled for tonight,.
The basketball pavilion has been
transformed itno an ancient Japa
nese garden. For music the Hotel
Oakland orchestra has been se
cured, and in order to make the
music audible to all, a platform has
been constructed in the middle of
the floor.
Program card cases of Oriental
brocade will be in perfect harmony
with the rest of the Prom. All that
the Prom is lacking for a perfect
Oriental atmosphere is jinrikisha
taxisâ€”but perhaps a few of these
will be located.
