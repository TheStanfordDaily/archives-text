# RETIRING ZOOLOGISTS HONORED AT DINNER GIVEN BY FRIENDS
## Banquet Held at Union for Dr. C. H. Gilbert and Professor G. C. Price 
### 
Dr. C. H. Gilbert and Professor G.
C. Price, professors of zoology, were
given a dinner in honor of their re
tirement last night at the Stan
ford Union. Dr. David Starr Jordan,
who presided, paid tribute to both men
and told of them as being hia first
students many years ago in high
school at Indianapolis. Dr. Gilbert and
Professor Price will quit active teach
ing at the end of the quarter.
Dr. Wilbur told of Dr. Gilbert's mod
esty and declared that many students
do not know of Dr. Gilbert's import
ance to the government through his
work with fish; he said Dr. Gilbert is
the foremost authority on salmon. He
praised Professor Price for his suc
cessful career as a teacher.
Professor Snyder said that it is the
"first break in a happy family."
In responding to requests for some
expression of his feelings upon retir
ing from active life, Dr. Price said
that if he had his life to live over
again, "I would choose to teach; and
to teach in Stanford; and to teach
zoology; and to teach the students I
have had. There is one thing I would
like to change and that is to teach
better. One of fhe pleasures of teach
ing, I think, is that you can do it a
little better next year."
Testimonials Received
Dr. Gilbert, in giving a similar ex
pression, said that retirement would
finally give him an opportunity to
work; that "it seems a fair and pleas
ant prospect."
