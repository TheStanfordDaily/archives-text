Freshmen Trounced
Moore pitched fair ball for the'fresh
man niite but poor support turned a
j close game into a walk-away for the
j Betas. The Betas piled up an early
lead in the first inning, when the first
three men up, Fullerton, Mannoccir,
and Andrews scored.
Three more runs were scored for
the Beta nine in the third, when An
drews, Kissinger, and Watt crossed
the plate. In the fifth, 12 men faced the
freshman hurler before the Betas were
retired, and three hits and five errors
contributed eight runs to the Beta
total.
Carlsmith scored for the Encina nine
in the first inning, but only three men
went before the Beta pitcher in each
of the next three innings. In the last
of the fifth, with two out after Silver
man had scored for Encina, the fresh
men conceded the contest to the
Betas.
