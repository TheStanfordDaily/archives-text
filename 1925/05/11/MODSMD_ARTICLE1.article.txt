# 1926 OPERA PLEASES CAPACITY AUDIENCE IN ASSEMBLY HALL
## Velma Randall, John Wiggin Stars of "Ace High;" Direction Is Good 
### Steve O'Donnell 
Peggy Randall's personal charm, John
Wiggin's affected insipidity, a lot of
really good music, and some first-rate
specialty numbers were, in large part, re
sponsilbe for the enthusiastic reception
which a campus audience accorded the
1926 Opera "Ace High" at Saturday
night's performance in the Assembly Hall.
The success of the show was aided and
abetted by the experienced direction of
Deliner Daves, the excellent musical ar
rangement of Frederic lyroler, and some
of those attractive sets which are get
ting to be expected of Leslie Kiler. Be
sides all this, some striking costumes,
designed by Chrysella Dunker, and good
lighting effects cleverly handled by Hume
West had something to do with it.
Marjorie Allen, as Gale Windish, made
a charming heroine to suffer the forced
advances of the villainous Senor Mo
reno, portrayed by Truman Dawes. Fen
ton Barrett, in the male lead, was sadly
miscast. This was not Barrett's fault.
The difficulty lay in the fact that the
character of Senor Moreno was essen
tially shown to be that of a strong and
powerful man, while Collins Mcßaine, a
young aviator was, according to Barrett's
interpretation, simply a nice boy. When
he got the better of Senor Moreno in
love, strategy, and f finally in hand-to
hand combat the trouble was that the
audience simply didn't believe it.
Randall, Wiggin Star
The book, which was written by Web
ster Street, was good as a whole, but
suffered somewhat from poor distribu
tion of the good lines. The reason why
Peggy Randall and John Wiggin stole
the spotlight from Marjorie Allen and
Fenton Barrett was that the former pair
were allotted by far the pick of the lines.
Catha and Willie Carter were both posi
tive characters, while Gale Windish and
Collins Mcßaine were just the ordinary
heroine and hero.
The specialties deserve an unusual
amount of praise. Heading the list was
Burt Harger's Mummy Dance, the fore
1 most terpsichorean effort seen in a
i campus production in late years. Run
| ning this number a close second was the
, Peruvian Generals' Military Dance, a
comedy number which well deserved its
i four encores.
Africa, a song and dance number by
, Gardner Lippincott and Byron Kis
singer, was extremely humorous, while
j the Dance of the Dolls, by Lydia Mur
] ray and Alberta Williamson was quite
' cute, liyron Harvey, with Helen Stew
art as a partner, presented a well exe
cuted Spanish Dance, while Elizabeth
Simmons did something of a similar na
ture all by herself, and what's more, she
did it quite well.
As for the musical numbers, they were
uniformly good. "We'll Settle Down,"
I by Chester Baker, was probably the hit
of the show, but it was only one step
j ahead of "Ask Me to Love You." The
former selection was probably the better
of the two, but the diminutive Peggy
Randall rendered the latter in such an
appealing manner as to unduly influence
sound, critical comparison.
"Fixin' Things," the opening number,
was written by Ruth Mcßride and Fred
eric Tyroler. It succeeded in establish
ing the proper peppy atmosphere of a
musical comedy. Other attractive songs
were "Nobody Else But You," Charles
Parks and Huntley Castncr; "My Girl's
a Walking Ad," Ruth Mcßride; "I Want
You Near," Ruth Mcßride and Frederic
Tyroler; "Don't Worry," George Bogue;
"Dumb and Devoted," Ruth Mcßride;
and the finale, "Back to California,"
Margaret Cosgrave and Alice Dodds.
0 To get on to the remaining characters,
John Truman, as Professor Windish,
showed a tendency to overact which
should have been stopped in rehearsals.
Patrice Nauman playing opposite him
as Mrs. Windish, did rather well. George
Bogue lent unexpected dignity to the
character of Mr. Langley, while Lee
I'lood was perfectly terrifying as Pedro.
Sad to relate, Lafe Brown had not the
slightest chance to be good. His part
was built around a number of obsolete
cross-word puzzle gags which were not
very good in the first place. Kenneth
Chantry became a trifle confused, while
Dorothy Dahler's part of Faustina was
unmercifully ruined by the faculty cen
sor, leaving little but a song number.
Charles Simons made a prosperous look
ing hotel keeper, one Strinberg by name,
but he should never have been allotted
the duty of sing'ng "Strinberg's Lament,"
for it had no part in the show.
The choruses showed good individual
work, but rather suffered from a lack of
co-operation in some numbers. In the
Mummy's Dance and in the Spanish
Daiy:e the chorus work was rather good.
By way of summary, the Junior Opera
was an enjoyable affair. It must be ad
mitted that the last dress rehearsal left
all who saw it in a mood of grave doubt
concerning the possibilities of success
of the final presentation. However, in
three days someone did something and
got wonderful results. It is suspected
that these fellows Daves and Tyroler
had something to do with this reviving
process.

lighting effects cleverly handled by Hume
West had something to do with it.
Marjorie Allen, as Gale Windish, made
a charming heroine to suffer the forced
advances of the villainous Senor Mo
reno, portrayed by Truman Dawes. Fen
ton Barrett, in the male lead, was sadly
miscast. This was not Barrett's fault.
The difficulty lay in the fact that the
character of Senor Moreno was essen
tially shown to be that of a strong and
powerful man, while Collins Mcßaine, a
young aviator was, according to Barrett's
interpretation, simply a nice boy. When
he got the better of Senor Moreno in
love, strategy, and f finally in hand-to
hand combat the trouble was that the
audience simply didn't believe it.
Randall, Wiggin Star
The book, which was written by Web
ster Street, was good as a whole, but
suffered somewhat from poor distribu
tion of the good lines. The reason why
Peggy Randall and John Wiggin stole
the spotlight from Marjorie Allen and
Fenton Barrett was that the former pair
were allotted by far the pick of the lines.
Catha and Willie Carter were both posi
tive characters, while Gale Windish and
Collins Mcßaine were just the ordinary
heroine and hero.
The specialties deserve an unusual
amount of praise. Heading the list was
Burt Harger's Mummy Dance, the fore
1 most terpsichorean effort seen in a
i campus production in late years. Run
| ning this number a close second was the
, Peruvian Generals' Military Dance, a
comedy number which well deserved its
i four encores.
Africa, a song and dance number by
, Gardner Lippincott and Byron Kis
singer, was extremely humorous, while
j the Dance of the Dolls, by Lydia Mur
] ray and Alberta Williamson was quite
' cute, liyron Harvey, with Helen Stew
art as a partner, presented a well exe
cuted Spanish Dance, while Elizabeth
Simmons did something of a similar na
ture all by herself, and what's more, she
did it quite well.
As for the musical numbers, they were
uniformly good. "We'll Settle Down,"
I by Chester Baker, was probably the hit
of the show, but it was only one step
j ahead of "Ask Me to Love You." The
former selection was probably the better
of the two, but the diminutive Peggy
Randall rendered the latter in such an
appealing manner as to unduly influence
sound, critical comparison.
"Fixin' Things," the opening number,
was written by Ruth Mcßride and Fred
eric Tyroler. It succeeded in establish
ing the proper peppy atmosphere of a
musical comedy. Other attractive songs
were "Nobody Else But You," Charles
Parks and Huntley Castncr; "My Girl's
a Walking Ad," Ruth Mcßride; "I Want
You Near," Ruth Mcßride and Frederic
Tyroler; "Don't Worry," George Bogue;
"Dumb and Devoted," Ruth Mcßride;
and the finale, "Back to California,"
Margaret Cosgrave and Alice Dodds.
0 To get on to the remaining characters,
John Truman, as Professor Windish,
showed a tendency to overact which
should have been stopped in rehearsals.
Patrice Nauman playing opposite him
as Mrs. Windish, did rather well. George
Bogue lent unexpected dignity to the
character of Mr. Langley, while Lee
I'lood was perfectly terrifying as Pedro.
Sad to relate, Lafe Brown had not the
slightest chance to be good. His part
was built around a number of obsolete
cross-word puzzle gags which were not
very good in the first place. Kenneth
Chantry became a trifle confused, while
Dorothy Dahler's part of Faustina was
unmercifully ruined by the faculty cen
sor, leaving little but a song number.
Charles Simons made a prosperous look
ing hotel keeper, one Strinberg by name,
but he should never have been allotted
the duty of sing'ng "Strinberg's Lament,"
for it had no part in the show.
The choruses showed good individual
work, but rather suffered from a lack of
co-operation in some numbers. In the
Mummy's Dance and in the Spanish
Daiy:e the chorus work was rather good.
By way of summary, the Junior Opera
was an enjoyable affair. It must be ad
mitted that the last dress rehearsal left
all who saw it in a mood of grave doubt
concerning the possibilities of success
of the final presentation. However, in
three days someone did something and
got wonderful results. It is suspected
that these fellows Daves and Tyroler
had something to do with this reviving
process.
Peggy Randall's personal charm, John
Wiggin's affected insipidity, a lot of
really good music, and some first-rate
specialty numbers were, in large part, re
sponsilbe for the enthusiastic reception
which a campus audience accorded the
1926 Opera "Ace High" at Saturday
night's performance in the Assembly Hall.
The success of the show was aided and
abetted by the experienced direction of
Deliner Daves, the excellent musical ar
rangement of Frederic lyroler, and some
of those attractive sets which are get
ting to be expected of Leslie Kiler. Be
sides all this, some striking costumes,

The book, which was written by Web
ster Street, was good as a whole, but
suffered somewhat from poor distribu
tion of the good lines. The reason why
Peggy Randall and John Wiggin stole
the spotlight from Marjorie Allen and
Fenton Barrett was that the former pair
were allotted by far the pick of the lines.
Catha and Willie Carter were both posi
tive characters, while Gale Windish and
Collins Mcßaine were just the ordinary
heroine and hero.
The specialties deserve an unusual
amount of praise. Heading the list was
Burt Harger's Mummy Dance, the fore
1 most terpsichorean effort seen in a
i campus production in late years. Run
| ning this number a close second was the
, Peruvian Generals' Military Dance, a
comedy number which well deserved its
i four encores.
Africa, a song and dance number by
, Gardner Lippincott and Byron Kis
singer, was extremely humorous, while
j the Dance of the Dolls, by Lydia Mur
] ray and Alberta Williamson was quite
' cute, liyron Harvey, with Helen Stew
art as a partner, presented a well exe
cuted Spanish Dance, while Elizabeth
Simmons did something of a similar na
ture all by herself, and what's more, she
did it quite well.
As for the musical numbers, they were
uniformly good. "We'll Settle Down,"
I by Chester Baker, was probably the hit
of the show, but it was only one step
j ahead of "Ask Me to Love You." The
former selection was probably the better
of the two, but the diminutive Peggy
Randall rendered the latter in such an
appealing manner as to unduly influence
sound, critical comparison.
"Fixin' Things," the opening number,
was written by Ruth Mcßride and Fred
eric Tyroler. It succeeded in establish
ing the proper peppy atmosphere of a
musical comedy. Other attractive songs
were "Nobody Else But You," Charles
Parks and Huntley Castncr; "My Girl's
a Walking Ad," Ruth Mcßride; "I Want
You Near," Ruth Mcßride and Frederic
Tyroler; "Don't Worry," George Bogue;
"Dumb and Devoted," Ruth Mcßride;
and the finale, "Back to California,"
Margaret Cosgrave and Alice Dodds.
0 To get on to the remaining characters,
John Truman, as Professor Windish,
showed a tendency to overact which
should have been stopped in rehearsals.
Patrice Nauman playing opposite him
as Mrs. Windish, did rather well. George
Bogue lent unexpected dignity to the
character of Mr. Langley, while Lee
I'lood was perfectly terrifying as Pedro.
Sad to relate, Lafe Brown had not the
slightest chance to be good. His part
was built around a number of obsolete
cross-word puzzle gags which were not
very good in the first place. Kenneth
Chantry became a trifle confused, while
Dorothy Dahler's part of Faustina was
unmercifully ruined by the faculty cen
sor, leaving little but a song number.
Charles Simons made a prosperous look
ing hotel keeper, one Strinberg by name,
but he should never have been allotted
the duty of sing'ng "Strinberg's Lament,"
for it had no part in the show.
The choruses showed good individual
work, but rather suffered from a lack of
co-operation in some numbers. In the
Mummy's Dance and in the Spanish
Daiy:e the chorus work was rather good.
By way of summary, the Junior Opera
was an enjoyable affair. It must be ad
mitted that the last dress rehearsal left
all who saw it in a mood of grave doubt
concerning the possibilities of success
of the final presentation. However, in
three days someone did something and
got wonderful results. It is suspected
that these fellows Daves and Tyroler
had something to do with this reviving
process.
Peggy Randall's personal charm, John
Wiggin's affected insipidity, a lot of
really good music, and some first-rate
specialty numbers were, in large part, re
sponsilbe for the enthusiastic reception
which a campus audience accorded the
1926 Opera "Ace High" at Saturday
night's performance in the Assembly Hall.
The success of the show was aided and
abetted by the experienced direction of
Deliner Daves, the excellent musical ar
rangement of Frederic lyroler, and some
of those attractive sets which are get
ting to be expected of Leslie Kiler. Be
sides all this, some striking costumes,
designed by Chrysella Dunker, and good
lighting effects cleverly handled by Hume
West had something to do with it.
Marjorie Allen, as Gale Windish, made
a charming heroine to suffer the forced
advances of the villainous Senor Mo
reno, portrayed by Truman Dawes. Fen
ton Barrett, in the male lead, was sadly
miscast. This was not Barrett's fault.
The difficulty lay in the fact that the
character of Senor Moreno was essen
tially shown to be that of a strong and
powerful man, while Collins Mcßaine, a
young aviator was, according to Barrett's
interpretation, simply a nice boy. When
he got the better of Senor Moreno in
love, strategy, and f finally in hand-to
hand combat the trouble was that the
audience simply didn't believe it.
