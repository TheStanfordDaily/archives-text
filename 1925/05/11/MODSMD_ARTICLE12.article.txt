## Graves of Senator Stanford's Thoroughbreds Marked By Monument, Headstones 
### 
It is well known that the Stanford
campus contains many monuments to
noted personages, hut it is perhaps less
well known that it also contains a monu
ment to some of the greatest racc horses
the world has ever seen. Near the old
Stanford stables in the northwestern cor
ner of the campus,, are buried fifteen of
Senator Stanford's famous race horses,
among them Palo Alto, Wild Flower, and
Manzanita, all world's champions, find
their sire, Electioneer, who possessed more
famous offspring than any other horse
known.
The horses are buried in a fenced in
closure beneath a grove of oaks. Their
graves are marked by a bronze statue of
a horse standing on a huge marble block,
and by a monument which bears the
names of the horses, their times, and the
names of their parents and noted off
spring.
Senator Stanford took a great interest
in breeding fine horses. Between 1880
1 and 1900 he produced some of the
world's best trotting horses. By breed
ing a thoroughbred marc with a trotting
horse, he endeavored to produce an ani

mal possessing the speed of the race
horse and the endurance of the standard
hrcd horse. The result was a few great
successes among many failures.
Because of these methods of breeding
Stanford's horses were noted for their
endurance. Palo Alto hrokc the world's
stallion record in 1891 in his fifth heat,
that is after lie already had trotted
four miles at racing spe'ed. Palo Alto's
time of 2 minutes seconds for a mile
was beaten the next year, when he died.
Wild Flower was the first Stanford
horse to hold a world's record. He set
the two-year-old champion time of
2:21:1 in 1881 and held this record until
1888, when it was beaten by Sunol, an
other Stanford horse. Arion,
whose dam, Manctte, is buried here, held
the two-year-old championship record
from 1891 to 1909. Thus the two-year
old world's championship was held by
Stanford horses practically continuously
for twenty-eight years.
Manzanita, 2:16, held the world's four
year-old record in 1886. Me was foaled
(born) in 1882 and died in l f T)4. Nor
lain, held the world's yearling
