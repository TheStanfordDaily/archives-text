# MANUAL ARTS SETS NEW RECORD, WINS TRACK CHAMPIONSHIP
## Two Hundred Track Men of Sixty Schools Battle for State Laurels 
### Douglas Meservey 
Manual Arts High School of Los An
geles won the California Interscholastic
Federation championship with a total of
sixteen points Saturday in the Stanford
stadium, but it had to establish a world's
interscholastic record to take the honor.
San Diego was second with
points; Hollywood had 12; lnglewood,
8; Lincoln High of Los Angeles, 8; El
Monte, 7; and Riverside, 6.
The other schools competing scored
five points each or less.
After all the events had been run, with
the exception of the half-mile relay, San
Diego led with 11 points, with Manual
Arts close behind with 11. Either could
win the meet by a victory in the relay,
and San Diego was given the edge be
cause of its defeat of Manual Arts in
the southern meet last Saturday.
Four teams looked to be possible win
ners up to the finish with Manual Arts,
San Diego, Hollywood, and Huntington
Beach fighting it out for the lead. Junior
Hanford, husky anchor man of the
Toilers, made himself the hero of the
meet , however, when he showed a
stronger sprint than his competitors and
ended the half-mile relay in the new
world's record time of 1:30 5-10.
Previous to this Hanford had taken
in the 440, after being doped to win it,
and had won his heat and final of the
100-yard dash—being largely responsible,
therefore, for his team's victory.
South Is Ahead
As in former meets, the southern sec
tion of the C. I. F. was far superior to
any of the northern groups. Of the lat
ter, but three first places were scored
and one did not count in the final score—
the javelin throw.
These were accounted for by Olsen of
Concord, who tossed the javelin for a
new state record of 171 feet 1 3-4 inches;
his teammate, Hanson, who won the
quarter-mile in 51 seconds; and Flelsh
hacker of Menlo, who easily won the 12-
pound shot by tossing it 49 feet 2 inches.
The quarter-mile was one of the up
sets of the day and the most thrilling
outside of the relay. Han ford of Man
uals Arts led Gail of Los Angeles High
by inches up to the last fifty yards and
was practically conceded the race by the
spectators when a red-headed flash by
the name of Hanson from Concord drew
up to him. He had been unnoticed until
then, but passed Hanford easily with the
long easy stride of Richardson and Mil
ler of Stanford and won by yards in 51
seconds flat.
Unruh of El Monte, who was the
favorite in the mile with his time of
4:29 last week, won the event but only
after Carnahan of Riverside led him un
til the last twenty-five yards and he was
forced into a desperate sprint, and fin
ished in 4:35 1-5.
Gleege of Covina was the favorite
in the half-mile, but fell by the wayside
for a second place when McKinnon of
Los Angeles Polytechnic beat him in the
last sprint. The time was 1:59 4-5.
Star Vaulter Wins
Williams of Inglewood, who set a new
world's interscholastic record of 13 feet
1 5-8 inches in the pole vault last week,
won from Hulsman of San Jose at 12
feet 9 5-8 inches. Hulsman cleared 12
feet 6 inches for a second.
Hollywood was placed in third posi
tion through the efforts of Eads, its
hurdler. He won the high sticks easily,
tying the interscholastic record of :15 2-5,
and followed Norris of Santa Maria in
the lows for a second place. Norris did
not make record time in the latter event,
but he led the field by yards, showing
wonderful form and speed in between the
barriers.
Bowen of Santa Monica won the high
jump at 5 feet 10 inches, but went out
for a new record and set a state mark
of & feet 1 1-2 inches, breaking the old
one by one-half an inch.
