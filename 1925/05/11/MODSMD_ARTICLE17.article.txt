## Two Hundred Track Men of Sixty Schools Battle for State Laurels 
### Douglas Meservey 
Manual Arts High School of Los An
geles won the California Interscholastic
Federation championship with a total of
sixteen points Saturday in the Stanford
stadium, but it had to establish a world's
interscholastic record to take the honor.
San Diego was second with
points; Hollywood had 12; lnglewood,
8; Lincoln High of Los Angeles, 8; El
Monte, 7; and Riverside, 6.
The other schools competing scored
five points each or less.
After all the events had been run, with
the exception of the half-mile relay, San
Diego led with 11 points, with Manual
Arts close behind with 11. Either could
win the meet by a victory in the relay,
and San Diego was given the edge be
cause of its defeat of Manual Arts in
the southern meet last Saturday.
Four teams looked to be possible win
ners up to the finish with Manual Arts,
San Diego, Hollywood, and Huntington
Beach fighting it out for the lead. Junior
Hanford, husky anchor man of the
Toilers, made himself the hero of the
meet , however, when he showed a
stronger sprint than his competitors and
ended the half-mile relay in the new
world's record time of 1:30 5-10.
Previous to this Hanford had taken
in the 440, after being doped to win it,
and had won his heat and final of the
100-yard dash—being largely responsible,
therefore, for his team's victory.
South Is Ahead
As in former meets, the southern sec
tion of the C. I. F. was far superior to
any of the northern groups. Of the lat
ter, but three first places were scored
and one did not count in the final score—
the javelin throw.
These were accounted for by Olsen of
