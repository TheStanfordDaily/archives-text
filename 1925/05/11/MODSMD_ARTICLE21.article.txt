# Honor Systems Elsewhere
## 
### 
Periodically, the discussion of Honor Systems is in order. No com
ment has been heard from Stanford students for some time. Ihe Cornell
Daily Sun is not so sure of the success of the arrangement so far as its
readers are concerned. Perhaps these sentiments will inspire a valuable
local discussion:
Four years have passed in which the Honor System has been in effect
at Cornell. Most students seem to be wholly satisfied with it, or at least
say that it is the best solution of the ever difficult problem of student-dis
honesty in the class room. Yet time and again we have heard its ad
vantages —or rather its practicability—questioned.
What are the supposed advantages of the Honor System? Why has
it ever been adopted anywhere? If it did not possess certain theoretical
advantages, obviously it would never have been seriously considered. Ihe
Honor Systm places the student on his own reliance. It removes the op
pressive and distasteful feeling that he is constantly under surveillance,
that he is constantly suspected of incipient dishonesty. It removes from
the faculty the necessity of spying. It treats both instructor and pupil as
open, honest individuals who have come to a mutual agreement so to meet
a problem as to eliminate the feeling that it is a game at which two parties
play in an attempt to beat one another.
In theory, no person could object to an Honor System unless his judg
ment were warped. It is a fine ideal. But what success has it had in
actual practice? One hears of a proposed Honor System ]?eing rejected at
one university or being dropped at another because it has not proved fea
ible. Frankly, the students fail to shoulder the full responsibility.
The great majority are entirely and unquestionably honest at all times.
But with the Honor System there is probably some increase in cheating.
For the man who would be dishonest when there are proctors in the room
but who would not cheat under the Honor System, truly has no honor at
all. This might be worth the price for the sake of having things carried
out on a basis which eliminated spying, if the students only reported vio
lations which they observe as they are supposed to do. But they don't.
This has been proved over and over again. It is incontrovertible. In
other words, the majority remain honest at all times, but the Honor System
adds the dishonesty of the weak-minded few. Students are invariably
treated more leniently by student honor committees at Cornell than they
would be if violations were passed upon by members of the faculty. This
is chiefly because student committees lack familiarity with details of the
violation and the course concerned which the instructor would possess.
The Honor System means participation by every student —not merely
refraining from dishonesty on one's own part.
