## "SAINT MARTIN'S SUMMER 
### Rafael Sabatini 
If you like Sabatini, you will like
"Saint Martin's Summer." If you don't
know Sabatini (we can't imagine
that!) but like clash of steel, the thud
of galloping hoofs, and the vicissitudes
of true- love in a romantic age—in
short, if you like adventure stories —
you will like this book. Sabatini, the
resourceful and imaginative, has set
his wits to work in the France of three
centuries ago, and he has produced a
tale replete with thrills and surprises,
the kind in which the reader rides
with the hero and in fact is, to all
intents and purposes, the hero.
The plot is simple enough. The vil
lains, step-mother and step-brother of
the true heir to Condillac, are trying
to force the latter's fianc6e to marry
the step-brother. Thg fiancee appeals
to the Queen, who sends an emissary
to rescue her. After all sorts of mis
haps and hairbreadth escapes, the
emissary foils the villains and frees
the maid. The true heir of Condillac
returns, and —well, who would be the
lucky man in a Sabatini story?
The hero, de Garnache, is a Gascon,
lie is the typical Sabatini hero, brave,
energetic, human. Somehow, though,
the abrupt Gascon de Garnache re
minds one strangely of another abrupt
Gascon —Rostand's Cyrano do Berge
rac. It is as if Sabatini had put Cyrano
in a (for him) new set of circum
stances and then let him make his
own story. We like Cyrano. He is one
of our enthusiasms. Perhaps that is
why we enjoyed Garnache so much.
The heroine is all that she should
be, plucky, pretty, and sweet. She
holds out beautifully against the vil
lains who, by the way, are admirable.
She quite satisfies as the heroine. For
ourseilf, however, we preferred the
lady-villainess. We realize that it's
outrageous, but we like fiery women
in books. —A. H. A.
