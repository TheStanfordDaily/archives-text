# FOOTBALL PRACTICE REBUILDING SQUAD FOR 1925 SCHEDULE
## 
### Don Liebendorfer 
With eighty-five men reporting daily
for spring football practice, "Pop"
Warner and his lieutenants are busily
engaged in rebuilding the Cardinal
grid machine for the 1925 season
which opens here September 26.
The Cards face one of their toughest
schedules in years with eight veteran
regulars missing from their lineup.
The line was hardest hit by gradua
tion and "Tiny" Thornhill is working
hard to instill the Warner system
into a bunch of promising youngsters.
George Baker, center; Bill Neill,
guard; Harry Shipkey and "Chuck"
Johnston, tackles; and Captain Law
son, end; have all played their allotted
three years and their loss leaves a
number of gaping holes in the forward
wall. Norman Cleaveland, Jim Kelly,
and Murray Cuddeback, regular half
backs last season, are also gone.
Tackles Missing
The places of Shipkey and Johnston,
at tackle, will probably be the hardest
to fill. These two boys played together
on their frosh eleven and went
through three years of varsity compe
tition together and were considered
among the best four or five tackles
on the Pacific Coast. Probably the
most promising of a lot of young can
didates for the tackle position is Ward
Poulson, who did some great work
as a substitute last year. He is a big
fellow who is improving right along
and should develop into a star. Sera
phim Post, and Rafetto, both of whom
played on the freshman team two
years ago, and Simmons, a transfer
who was ineligible last year, are ex
cellent prospects. Evefrett, Helmke,
and Morely, from the 1924 frosh team,
will be very much in the running.
There are five leading candidates for
the vacancy at center. McCreery, pivot
man for the Olympic Club during the
past two seasons, is registered and
has been doing good work in spring
practice. Van Hook, who has been a
sub for the last two years, has taken
on a lot of weight and looks better
than ever before. Natcher, another
substitute; Graham from the Gray
squad; and Mustain from the frosh
will have to be considered.
Fred Swan will be back to hold down
one guard position. Last year was
Swan's first of varsity competition and
he was considered one of the greatest
guards on the coast. Hunt, Armour,
Herth, and Simons, all substitutes, are
battling for the other job. They will
get plenty of competition from Eli
Post and Robesky of the frosh, Sholes
of the Grays, and Harris, who has been
shifted from end to guard.
Jim Lawson's place at end will be
a hard one to fill. Lawson has been
one of the West's greatest players for
three years and Thornhill will be hard
pressed to find another like him. Ted
Shipkey, who was the sensation of
the Cardinal line last year, will be
back to hold down one end and with
the experience he gained last season,
he should be a world-beater. "Dinty"
Moore, substitute quarterback, has
been shifted to end and looks like the
goods. Price, formerly a center, has
also be*n changed to end and may
develop. Middleton, Greisser, Adams,
and Stratton. substitutes; and David
son, Antonell, Vincenti, and Dennis,
from Hunt's freshman squad, will give
any of them a battle.
Both of last year's quarterbacks,
Solomon and Mitchell, will be back,
but neither of them can be considered
a cinch for the pilot job. Warner has
been working Ed Walker, who played
hal flast season, at quarter, and the
big boy has been doing well.

three years and Thornhill will be hard
pressed to find another like him. Ted
Shipkey, who was the sensation of
the Cardinal line last year, will be
back to hold down one end and with
the experience he gained last season,
he should be a world-beater. "Dinty"
Moore, substitute quarterback, has
been shifted to end and looks like the
goods. Price, formerly a center, has
also be*n changed to end and may
develop. Middleton, Greisser, Adams,
and Stratton. substitutes; and David
son, Antonell, Vincenti, and Dennis,
from Hunt's freshman squad, will give
any of them a battle.
Both of last year's quarterbacks,
Solomon and Mitchell, will be back,
but neither of them can be considered
a cinch for the pilot job. Warner has
been working Ed Walker, who played
hal flast season, at quarter, and the
big boy has been doing well.
With eighty-five men reporting daily
for spring football practice, "Pop"
Warner and his lieutenants are busily
engaged in rebuilding the Cardinal
grid machine for the 1925 season
which opens here September 26.
The Cards face one of their toughest
schedules in years with eight veteran
regulars missing from their lineup.
The line was hardest hit by gradua
tion and "Tiny" Thornhill is working
hard to instill the Warner system
into a bunch of promising youngsters.
George Baker, center; Bill Neill,
guard; Harry Shipkey and "Chuck"
Johnston, tackles; and Captain Law
son, end; have all played their allotted
three years and their loss leaves a
number of gaping holes in the forward
wall. Norman Cleaveland, Jim Kelly,
and Murray Cuddeback, regular half
backs last season, are also gone.
Tackles Missing
The places of Shipkey and Johnston,
at tackle, will probably be the hardest
to fill. These two boys played together
on their frosh eleven and went
through three years of varsity compe
tition together and were considered
among the best four or five tackles
on the Pacific Coast. Probably the
most promising of a lot of young can
didates for the tackle position is Ward
Poulson, who did some great work
as a substitute last year. He is a big
fellow who is improving right along
and should develop into a star. Sera
phim Post, and Rafetto, both of whom
played on the freshman team two
years ago, and Simmons, a transfer
who was ineligible last year, are ex
cellent prospects. Evefrett, Helmke,
and Morely, from the 1924 frosh team,
will be very much in the running.
There are five leading candidates for
the vacancy at center. McCreery, pivot
man for the Olympic Club during the
past two seasons, is registered and
has been doing good work in spring
practice. Van Hook, who has been a
sub for the last two years, has taken
on a lot of weight and looks better
than ever before. Natcher, another
substitute; Graham from the Gray
squad; and Mustain from the frosh
will have to be considered.
Fred Swan will be back to hold down
one guard position. Last year was
Swan's first of varsity competition and
he was considered one of the greatest
guards on the coast. Hunt, Armour,
Herth, and Simons, all substitutes, are
battling for the other job. They will
get plenty of competition from Eli
Post and Robesky of the frosh, Sholes
of the Grays, and Harris, who has been
shifted from end to guard.
Jim Lawson's place at end will be
a hard one to fill. Lawson has been
one of the West's greatest players for
three years and Thornhill will be hard
pressed to find another like him. Ted

the Cardinal line last year, will be
back to hold down one end and with
