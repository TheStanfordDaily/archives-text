# SPORTS OF 1925
## Three Great Horses 
### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
With the fifty-first run n ing of the Kentuck Derby drawing near, interest is
growing daily in that classic event. The names of former winners are brought
to mind, as well as that of Man-o'-War, the greatest horse of the Ameriacn
turf, who never won the Kentucky Derby.
It is interesting to note, however, that two of this famous champion's sons
are nominated for the 1925 race, and, because of the speed, courage, a d
stamina of their renowned sire, they are held in high favor in the early
bookings.
Man-o'-War's claim to the title of the greatest American racehorse is
backed up by his many record-breaking performances, and by the fact that
he was defeated only once in his career, and that in a race that he most
certainly would have wo n but for questionable riding by his jockey. American
Flag and By Hisself, both by Man-o'-War, have inherited some of the potential
strength of that super-horse, their sire.
When Man-o'-War retired he had won eleven out of twelve races, and set a
new record for total purses won with earnings of $249,265. Among the speed
records he set were marks for 1 3-8, 1 1-2, and 1 5-8 miles, all made at Belmont
Park in 1920.
Exterminator, know n as "Old Bones," is now ten years old, and won the
Kentucky Derby away back in 1918. He is the only horse of the present day
that can compare with those of a decade or more ago who often ran upward
of 100 times. Like the brook, Willis Sharpe Kilmer's horse seems to go on
forever. No two Derby winners have yet come from the same stable, but
Kilmer has a capable horse nominated for the 1925 race in Sunny Man, and
hopes that he will follow in the hoof-prints of "Old Bo n es."
Morvich was called the "million dollar freak." He had a record comparable
to Man-o'-War's as a two-year-old, but after winning the 1922 Derby, failed to
show anything like his best form and was a great disappointment.
