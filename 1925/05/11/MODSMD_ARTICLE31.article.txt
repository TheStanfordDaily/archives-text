"The greatest vice in American col
leges today is loafing," declared Pro
fessor Ralph W. Aigler, chairman of
the board of control of athletics at
the University of Michigan. "There is
no doubt that this far overshadows the
harm created by intercollegiate ath
letics," he said.

For each student admitted to Po
mona College, three are turned away
because of lack of room.
