# AWARDS PLAN GOES BEFORE COMMITTEE
## 
### 
Final discussion of the proposed set
of rules for athletic awards will be made
at a meeting tonight of the special com
mittee appointed by the Executive Com
mittee recently. Recommendations from
various coaches for changes in the first
draft will be considered.
The results of tonight's meeting will
probably be brought before the Execu
tive Committee tomorrow night.
Most important of the changes pro
posed in the draft as it stands at present
is the limitation of the number of major
sports and restriction of the minor sports
to four, with other sports classified as
belonging to the gymnasium department.
The four major sports mentioned at
present are football, basketball, track,
and baseball. Minor sports are tennis,
soccer, swimming, and boxing.
Not only docs the proposed system
reduce the number of major awards, but
it advocates the awarding of medals for
the auxiliary sports. These medals
would be gold and similar for all sports
under this department, but differing in
the engraving of the name of the sport
and the participant.
This system in general if it goes past
the Executive Committee tomorrow night
may be voted upon at the spring elec
tions on May 26.
