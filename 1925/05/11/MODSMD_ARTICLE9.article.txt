in League 1 as a result of Friday's

with El Campo to El Campo, thus re
tiring from the plaque race. The Chi
Psis finished in fourth place in League
I.
El Campo remained in the running
for the plaque in League I by winning
two games by default during the week
end. Friday, the Alpha Delt nine for
feited, while Saturday, the Chi Psi
nine conceded them their tie game.

position.
