I "Making a Customer" I
He gave a snort of deep disgust
And looked real mean at me—
"I know about these Bargain Sales,
You can't fool me," said he.
"I read the ads—of cheaper food, H
And then rush madly out,
But when I get down to the store
I find they've 'just sold out.'
"Some folks will look around a bit,
And then buy things they need,
But I just get so dawgoned mad,
I leave the place with speed."
"Old man," I said, "you've been abused,
And treated rather cruelly,
But Piggly Wiggly's ads all tell
The story well and truly.
"It's hard to gauge our needs sometimes,
But hearts and souls are in it,
And should a special sell clear out—
We get more in a minute.
"Our trucks are busy all the time
(You never see them standing)
To keep our Stores supplied with things
That people are demanding.
"We only ask a sporting chance
To prove our sales have merit, ; t
If you should find a thing that's wrong,
We really want to hear it."
And now, that man's a customer—
He found my statement true,
And if you drop into our stores
We'll make the same of you!
—The Piggly Wiggly Poet.
