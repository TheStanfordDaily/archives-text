# HIGH SCHOOL PRESS CONVENTION MEMBERS MEET NEXT FRIDAY
## Problems Affecting School Papers to Be Discussed; 240 Will Attend 
### 
Representatives from 40 high schools
from throughout California, with ap
proximately 240 delegates from these
schools, have to date signified their in
tentions of attending the Interscholas
tic Press Association convention,
which this year will be held at Stan
ford Friday and Saturday. Several
high schools have not been heard from
as yet. The convention, sponsored by
the Stanford chapter of Sigma Delta
Chi, journalistic fraternity, was at
tended last year by 38 high schools
with a delegation of 143 representa
tives.
A preliminary conference between
N. E. James, director of the conven
tion, Burnell Gould of University High,
Oakland, president of the association,
and other officials drew up a rough
draft of the constitution which will be
-presented at the two business meetings
of the delegates Friday afternoon and
Saturday morning. At the regular busi
ness meetings the officers for the com
ing year will be elected, the constitu
tion presented, and plans for enlarg
ing and improving the California In
terscholastic Press Association will be
discussed.
Work on journalistic problems will
"be done at ♦round-table discussion,
where the delegates will be divided
into seven groups instructed by ex
perts in the various fieids of journal
istic work. Among the problems for
•discussion at the roundtable will be
the selection of editors and mana
gers for the various high school pub
lications. Several schools, following
the recommendation of the convention
last year, have appointed rather than
■elected their editors and managers,
and definite reports as to the success j
of this plan will be presented.
A second field for discussion will be j
the financial problems encountered by
the various high school publications.
Another problem is in regard to the
editorial scope of the papers. Several
publications, among them those of !
Piedmont, and University high at Oak-1
land, are publishing papers which are
of influence on the surrounding com
munity.
Several changes in the humor col- '
umns of the various publications will
be advocated at the meetings, and es
pecially as to the use of jokes.

nitely announced their attendance at

of this plan will be presented.
A second field for discussion will be j
the financial problems encountered by
the various high school publications.
Another problem is in regard to the
editorial scope of the papers. Several

Piedmont, and University high at Oak-1
land, are publishing papers which are
of influence on the surrounding com
munity.
Several changes in the humor col- '
umns of the various publications will
be advocated at the meetings, and es
pecially as to the use of jokes.

nitely announced their attendance at

Representatives from 40 high schools
from throughout California, with ap
proximately 240 delegates from these
schools, have to date signified their in
tentions of attending the Interscholas
tic Press Association convention,
which this year will be held at Stan
ford Friday and Saturday. Several
high schools have not been heard from
as yet. The convention, sponsored by
the Stanford chapter of Sigma Delta
Chi, journalistic fraternity, was at
tended last year by 38 high schools
with a delegation of 143 representa
tives.
A preliminary conference between
N. E. James, director of the conven
tion, Burnell Gould of University High,
Oakland, president of the association,
and other officials drew up a rough
draft of the constitution which will be
-presented at the two business meetings
of the delegates Friday afternoon and
Saturday morning. At the regular busi
ness meetings the officers for the com
ing year will be elected, the constitu
tion presented, and plans for enlarg
ing and improving the California In
terscholastic Press Association will be
discussed.
Work on journalistic problems will
"be done at ♦round-table discussion,
where the delegates will be divided
into seven groups instructed by ex
perts in the various fieids of journal
istic work. Among the problems for
•discussion at the roundtable will be
the selection of editors and mana
gers for the various high school pub
lications. Several schools, following
the recommendation of the convention
last year, have appointed rather than
■elected their editors and managers,
and definite reports as to the success j
of this plan will be presented.

the financial problems encountered by
