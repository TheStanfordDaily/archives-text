# SWIMMERS TRAIN FOR THREE P. A. A. EVENTS ON CAMPUS SATURDAY
## 
### 
With three P. X. A. senior champion
ship swimming events scheduled for
next Saturday, the Stanford team has
returned to the racing events instead
of water polo. A 300-yard medley, 800-
foot relay with four men, and low
board diving events are on the pro
gram. Medals are offered to the win
ners.
M. R. Gibbons looms as a likely win-
I ner in the diving, while several other
Cardinal wearers will be in the run
ning. E. A. Smith and W. E. Mills, win
ner of the Stanford-California fresh
i man diving this spring, are the other
; possible Stanford winners.
The" relay race has attracted the at
' tention of all the sprinters in Brand
sten's team. Fletcher, McAllister, Ste
'venson, and Allen will probably make
up the Stanford quartet.
In the medley Stanford enters Allen,
who has been training lately with a
view to taking the laurels. The med
ley consists of 100 yards each of
breast, back, and crawl strokes. Allen
I specializes in the backstroke and pos
sesses enough endurance to make a
I strong bid in the final sprint.
Entry blanks for four events at the
j Olympic Club pool on May 24 were
received bV Coach Brandsten yester
day. The events on the program are
50-yard free style, 220-yard hack stroke.
440-yard breast stroke, and the pigeon
> race. The latter is in the form of an
: endurance race back and forth across
j the pool with the last man to touch
the rail at each lap eliminated. At. the
j finish of each lap the remaining swim
i mers are started even.
Brandsten has not yet decided
whether to enter any men in this meet.
The meet falls on a Sunday, hence
| his team would not be able to com
j pete under the Cardinal colors.
