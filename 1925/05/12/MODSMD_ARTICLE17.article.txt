## 
### 
The relations of the Far East with
the League of Nations was the subject
of a talk by Yamato Ichihashi, Profes
sor of the history of the Far East, at
a meeting of the Cosmopolitan Club
last evening in the Women's Club
house. An open discussion of the
League followed the talk by Professor
Ichihashi.
In discussing the question, Profes
sor Ichihashi stated that China and
Japan, who, with Siam, were the only
independent countries of the Orient,
derived their greatest benefit from the
protection of their territorial integrity
guaranteed by the League.
Japan has a very strong pro-league
organization represented in all classes.
A special branch of this organization
is for the students, an organization
which corresponds to that on the Stan
ford campus.
Professor Ichihashi stated that in
general the League was an organiza
tion for the spread of ideals of peace.
Among the advantages offered by the
League is a means whereby a safety
valve is provided for smaller nations
to complain of grievances, and a
means for forming the habit of inter
national conference.
An example of the work of the
League's subsidiary organizations is
the International Labor Council, which
is working to standardize the world's
labor conditions.
An open forum discussion of the
League of Nations followed the talk
by Professor Ichihashi.
