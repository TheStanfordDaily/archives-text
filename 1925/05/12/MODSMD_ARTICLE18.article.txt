Geological Survey, which is to be held |
from June 23 to August 21 under the i
direction of Professor C. F. Tolman.
The Stanford Geological Survey this I
summer will map geologically portions j
of the Bradley and San Miguel Quad-!
rangles. During the first half of the!
quarter the geology of the region |
reached from the camps is worked out J
and plotted upon topographic maps and
sections. Each student member of the
Stanford Geological Survey prepares a
detailed topographic and geologic map 1
of an assigned area controlled by accu-!
rate instrumental work during the sec
ond half of the summer quarter.
A meeting of the summer geology
students will be held in Room 334 at 4
o'clock Thursday to elect the camp man
ager and to discuss matters concerning
the summer's work. H. L. Drew and |
H. M. Kirk arc the candidates for the 1
position of manager of the summer j
camp.
