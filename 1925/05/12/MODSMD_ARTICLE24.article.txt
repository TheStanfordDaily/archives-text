# It is! It Is! It Is!

It won't be long now before the Daily will call attention to the near
ness of final examination with the comment that, after all, we are here to
improve our minds by studying. Perhaps the Daily, as a representative
student publication, has gone a little too far in asserting this proposition
in the past; but whether we are (after all,) here to study after all, it will
undoubtedly be necessary for us scholars to make some sacrifices for this
pursuit, presently.
Co-operation has ever been forthcoming from the faculty. Valuable
time is taken by professors each day to discourse to groups of the men and
women who will guide the nation's destinies anon. At no little trouble,
reading lists are prepared. Examinations are given and corrected, after
a fashion, all with the aim of encouraging the advancement of knowledge.
The professors, individually are doing their share. Collectively, as a
faculty, however, their support for a constructive and economic reform
movement is sought.
The Library is too hot.
That is not meant as a slang expression. The temperature is referred
to. There is too much of it. What we would advocate is a cut in the coal
budget and a little more briskness for the air in the reading rooms.
Why, just the other day, we read through two murders and a divorce
in a Russian novel without recognizing anything more than our duty. If
the librarian hadn't found it necessary to lock-up, we might be sleeping
there yet.
Some may find this example a trifle unconvincing, for some people
could rest on an iceberg if only there were enough Russian novels. Yet,
the same situation has embarrassed us when reading Supreme Court re
ports ! The Library is undeniably too warm.
It is not our intention to come out too strongly for a cooler Library.
Some time ago criticism was directed against the Union Store. Even as
another had what he cast upon the water returned a thousand-fold, so did
it happen to us.
A Viewpoint which accused the students of dirtying the store was over
looked, although some of the many comments supporting any movement
for a cleaner place were printed. It is not our intention to' be unfair.
There are some who think the place to be satisfactory. Any grammatical
expressions of this sentiment will be published, although skeptically.
And so will any communications which announce the Library tempera
ture as perfect. A lot of people are no doubt off-the-nut because they
cannot concentrate on anything besides the baking process. Our high
Christian principles, however, demand that we help these unfortunates.
The Library is too HOT ! That's our story and we'll stick to it.
