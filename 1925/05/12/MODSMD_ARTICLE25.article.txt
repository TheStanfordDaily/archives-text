The Editor, Sir:
The Daily is to be congratulated to
have upon its staff a reporter possess
ing such remarkable powers of clair
voyance as the writer of the review
of the Junior Opera. Considering the
fact that the esteemed Mr. Cabbages
et al had evidently not seen the Opera,
his divination is nothing short of mar
velous. However, even the greatest of
mediums may have an off day, and I
would have suggested, had I the op
portunity, that the reviewer obtain a
program to place beneath his head be
fore throwing himself intothat nearly
all revealing trance.

The Daily is the student publication
and as such its greatest function is to
give recognition to those whose ef
forts have given us the campus activi
ties in which we all take a natural
pride. This year's Opera was peculiarly
fortunate in the presence of real danc
ing talent upon the campus. To have
overlooked one of the best specialty
dancers on the program is inexcusable.
If the reviewer had only consulted his
own files, he would have been able
to carry on without the assistance of
the program I should have offered him.
The review is still more incomplete
for there is another specialty entirely
omitted. It was furthermore one of the
most enjoyed songs of the evening.
The 1926 Opera will undoubtedly
stand out as the best Opera in the
past many years. The action alone
would have made a play. The acting
was up to the high standard Mr. Davis
has set for Stanford productions. The
choruses were well chosen and
trained. For once an Opera had music
that was music. And .no other Opera
could boast of such an array of spe
cialties. To be reviewed in the usual
Cabbages style is a poor reward for
the efforts of Mr. Daves and his cast.
May I suggest that in the future Cab
bages confine himself to sauerkraut
and nonsense poetry?
Sincerely, Sterling S. Cramer.
