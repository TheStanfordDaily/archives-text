1 know a girl so dumb that —
She wants to know how you play
corduroy ball.
She thinks the life-guard is only a
"lake sport."
She asked me which one of Chopin's
Preludes was "Asia Minor."
She thinks that Mendel's law was
just declared unconstitutional.
She likes me! —F. E. H.

Dear Cabbage:
There's been a lot said and written
about this fraternity (tong, league), in
your editorial (cabbage, news, view
point) columns, and a great deal h/is
been (is being) said around the halls
(fraternities, sororities) about it, but
in my opinion (judgment) it has all
been exceedingly foolish (absurd, ridi
culous).
In my opinion the fraternities (halls,
sororites) are all the bunk (or what
you will), and the complicated (com
plex, involved) system of regulations
(rules, restrictions) are much worse
(more awful). I wish my mother (fa
ther, sister, uncle) were here to tell
this University, institution, dissemina
tor of intellect) what they thought of
it. Now at good old Yale (Harvard,
Princeton, Columbia, California) it is
done in a different way. The whole
thing is a big (large, enormous, ele
phantic) waste of time and energy
(vitamans, calories) anyway, and what
I want (desire, wish) to know, is why
I didn't get a big (invitation, tumble).

terests of his alma mater at heart.
