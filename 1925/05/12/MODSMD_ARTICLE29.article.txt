# LARGE PER CENT OF MEN PARTICIPATE IN STANFORD ATHLETICS
## 
### 
"With more than adequate facilities,
and favorable natural conditions, Stan
ford has been able to rival if not to
outclass any other American univer
sity in general participation in ath
letics," said Dr. W. H. Barrows in an
interview yesterday. It is estimated
that 85 per cent of the men registered
in the University are engaged in some
form of athletics. Furthermore, the
high place occupied by minor sports
and intramural athletics is a great
factor in Stanford's 100 per cent par
ticipation policy."
Idea! Atmosphere
"The athletic atmosphere at Stan
ford is ideal. Climatic conditions are
such that outdoor sports can be en
gaged in practically the entire year.
In but few universities can be found
a larger amount of land devoted to
athletic fields, better gymnasium
equipment, or a more sanitary and up
to-date swimming pool.

"One of the distinctive features of
Stanford's athletic system is the group
ing of all athletic activities under one
head. In most universities intercolle
giate sports are under separate con
trol, being apart from intramural ath
letics and compulsory physical train
ing. The result is a lack of co-opera
tion. At Stanford each form of ath
letics receives adequate support
through placing all of them in the
hands of the Board of Athletic Con
trol.

"Through the introduction of a
large variety of sports, participation
is greatly increased. Both minor and
the intramural sports give many the
chance to engage in athletic activity
who would otherwise be uninterested.
Though golf interests only a small
group, it is supported and offers those
few an opportunity to participate in
university athletics.
C. W. Davis, director of intramural
sports, points out that participation
in intercollegiate competition is di
rectly benefited by intramural ath
letics.
Sports Introduced
Harry Maloney, director of minor
sports, came to Stanford in 1908, and
introduced boxing, fencing, and soccer.
With the establishment of minor
sports came increased interest in ath
letics. In 1914 the swimming pool was
built. Through Maloney's efforts minor
sports at Stanford are on a stronger
basis than in any other university. In
tramural athletics were introduced in
1919.

authorities of the Harvard Lampoon,

"Through the introduction of a
large variety of sports, participation
is greatly increased. Both minor and
the intramural sports give many the
chance to engage in athletic activity
who would otherwise be uninterested.
Though golf interests only a small
group, it is supported and offers those
few an opportunity to participate in
university athletics.
C. W. Davis, director of intramural
sports, points out that participation
in intercollegiate competition is di
rectly benefited by intramural ath
letics.
Sports Introduced
Harry Maloney, director of minor
sports, came to Stanford in 1908, and
introduced boxing, fencing, and soccer.
With the establishment of minor
sports came increased interest in ath
letics. In 1914 the swimming pool was
built. Through Maloney's efforts minor
sports at Stanford are on a stronger
basis than in any other university. In
tramural athletics were introduced in
1919.

Following the recent suppression by
authorities of the Harvard Lampoon,
copies were "bootlegged" at. $8 each.
"With more than adequate facilities,
and favorable natural conditions, Stan
ford has been able to rival if not to
outclass any other American univer
sity in general participation in ath
letics," said Dr. W. H. Barrows in an
interview yesterday. It is estimated
that 85 per cent of the men registered
in the University are engaged in some
form of athletics. Furthermore, the
high place occupied by minor sports
and intramural athletics is a great
factor in Stanford's 100 per cent par
ticipation policy."
Idea! Atmosphere
"The athletic atmosphere at Stan
ford is ideal. Climatic conditions are
such that outdoor sports can be en
gaged in practically the entire year.
In but few universities can be found
a larger amount of land devoted to
athletic fields, better gymnasium
equipment, or a more sanitary and up
to-date swimming pool.

"One of the distinctive features of
Stanford's athletic system is the group
ing of all athletic activities under one
head. In most universities intercolle
giate sports are under separate con
trol, being apart from intramural ath
letics and compulsory physical train
ing. The result is a lack of co-opera
tion. At Stanford each form of ath
letics receives adequate support
through placing all of them in the
hands of the Board of Athletic Con
trol.
