To begin with, the Brox Sisters sing

and are decided hits.
The International Novelty Orchestra
obliges with two smooth, cool, musi
cianly fox trots —"Florida" and "Me
Neenyah."
For those who like lots of "stuff"
in their fox trots there is "Those
Panama Manias" played by George
Olsen and His Music and "Oh That
Sweet in Suite 16" played by Dorn
berger and his orchestra.
And to round out a well balanced
release sheet are two of the most beau
tiful waltzes you have heard since "All
Alone." The Troubadours play "The
Love Song You Will Forget" in a melo
dious manner which belies the title.
Dan Gregory's Orchestra soft pedals
trumpets, saxes, and strings so the net
result, "Take Me Back to Your Heart,"
is a splendid waltz.
