# YOUTH
## By FEG MURRAY, '15

Nineteen years ago, on April 18th,
1906, San Francisco was visited by
that famous earthquake and fire. The
connection between that and this sport
cartoon is—besides the date —the fact
that the current year is also the nine
teenth aniversary of the arival of half
a dozen or more champions in various
lines of athletic endeavor.
Old age used to gather in all the
honors, but nowadays when an old
timer like Tom Gibbons, Abel Kiviat,

| Norman Brookes, or Jim Thorpe hogs
! the limelight, it is the exception. In
! baseball and golf the old boys still
I hang on —witness the Cobbs, Speakers,
i Collinses, Adamses, Johnsons, etc., in
the national pastime, and the Duncans,
Mitchells, Taylors, and other 49ers in
the Scotch game.
Youth is the winning age—no doubt
of that. Freddie Lindstrom, 18 years
old, and the youngest player in a ma
jor league uniform last year, was one

of the outstanding heroes of the
world's series.
In boxing we have Slattery and
Stribling, two youngsters able to give
good accounts of themselves in any
light heavyweight company—both are
under 21.
Tennis fairly teems with players yet
in their teens. Helen Wills at 19 is
internationally known. George Lott, a
year younger, is ranked ninth, and beat
Dick Williams in the National Tourna

ment last year. Another Helen from
California —Helen Jacobs —is a possi
ble future women's tennis queen, and
she, at 16, is the present girls' national
champion.
The combined ages of Lee Barnes
and Frank Hussey, both Olympic win
ners, would just about equal that of
Steenroos, who won the 1924 Olympic
marathon race. The swimming cham
pions seem to get still younger, for
the latest, Eleanor Ganatti, is only 15.
