## 
### 
"The name of Herbert Hoover is the
■best known in Finland of any American,"
declared Axel Leonard Astrom, Minister
•from Finland to the United States, dur
ing his visit to the University yesterday.
"Anything Hoover does is sought as
news in Finland. We thank America for
the supply ships sent by Hoover as head
of the A. R. A. in 1918 and 1919 when
the crops had not been planted, due to
an internal war, and the people were
starving," was the tribute paid by Mr.
Astrom.
"Stanford impresses me as an ideal
place for study, although I have only
jteen here three hours," continued Mr.
Astrom. "They tell me that the climate
-liere is almost perpetual summer, never
too hot or too cold.
"In Finland we luive but one important
university, located at Helsingfors and
established in 1648," he continued.
"There are no dormitories or buildings
like your New Union at Helsingfors. It
is my impression that there are more
Kirls there than here at Stanford, too,
although I shouldn't say so without sta
tistics.
"The democratic, hearty, and friendly
spirit of the American people is what
has impressed me most during my three
years in the United States. The Finnish
people have a deep sympathy and ad
miration for the people of America."
A. L. Astrom left Washington May 4,
and came to Stanford from Los Angeles.
He will visit Seattle and travel through
the Northwest, finally returning to
Washington about June 2. He has vis
ited several universities in Washington
and Oregon.
