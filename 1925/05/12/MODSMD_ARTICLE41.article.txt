# FOREIGN TRAVELING ADVISED BY HULME
## 
### 
"You don't get anything for nothing
and mighty little for a dime." said Pro
fessor Hulme when interviewed as to the
value of travel for education.
"Like everything else in life, the more
you put into travel the more you get
out," continued Professor Hulme. "Of
course everything depends on the trav
eler, but everyone should have intelli
gent preparation for the things he is to
see. It will depend on what your object
is, but history is the broadest preparation
of all. It includes all the essential ac
tivities of many social and political insti
tutions, art, languages, and the peoples
themselves.
"Europe is by far the most interesting
place for us, because it is the home of
our civilization. Even our religion,
though originating in Asia, has become
modified by long dwelling in Europe.
"But it is impossible to tell someone
else how to travel. You must rlo it be
fore you will really know how."
