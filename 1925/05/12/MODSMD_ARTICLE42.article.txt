# FOOTBALL PRACTICE ENDS NEXT FRIDAY
## 
### 
Spring football will end Friday after
a six-week period of practice. The men
have been taught the fundamentals of
the game, and have been given actual
plays and signals. Plans are now under
way to have a game Friday afternoon as
the last practice of the year.

Certain freshmen are showing par
ticularly well in the spring practice sea
son. On the line Everett, Post, Vin
centi, Mustain, and Robesky are show
ing the most promise from the 1923
squad. Robesky has been laid up in the
hospital with a wrenched knee since the
first week of scrimmage. Robesky was
captain of the freshman team and was
one of the best tackles on the Meld this
spring. Everett is playing first string
tackle, while Post has been substituting
at the guard position. Mustain and Vin
centi are holding down substitute cen
ter and end places, respectively.

In the backfield Hill, Murphy, and
Young from the 1928 class are showing
to advantage. Hill is playing regular
at halfback, and his shifty running is one
of the features of the scrimmages. He
is a clever runner, accurate passer, and
a safe defense man. Murphy will make
a strong bid for the quarterback job next
fall, if he plays as well next September
as he is playing this spring.

Young is the big "find"' of the spring
practice. He is a 190-pound fullback,
and should be a worthy substitute for
Captain Nevers next season. Although
Young is a member of the freshman
class, lie did not play for the 1928 team.
Young last played football at the L.D.S.
High School in Salt Lake City, where he
placed on an all-state eleven, being rec
ognized as one of the best all-around
athletes participating in Utah interscho
lastic competition.
Some of the freshman stars have been
busy with other sports, and have not
been able to participate in spring foot
ball practice. These men will be in suits
on September 15, when the 1925 season
starts at Stanford.
