terday afternoon by a score of 4 to 3.

Theta Pi from the running in League

remained in a triple tie for the league
leadership. El Campo won the title in
League 1 by trouncing Sigma Chi, 15-11.
The Fiji-S.A.E. encounter was prob
ably one of the best games played in the 1
league this season. Both teams played ;
air-tight ball and all the runs scored
were the results of timely hitting. The j
S.A.E.'s started out by marking up two
runs in the first inning on hits by Har-j
rel, Beeman, and Keyes.
The Fijis took* the lead by scoring
three runs in the second. Colvin walked,
took second on an error, and scored i
when Elliott singled. Kirwan singled, j
bringing in Elliott, and Clark connected :
for the third hit of the inning, scoring
Kirwan.
Adams of the Fijis counted for the 1
winning run by some clever base-steal- j
ing in the fifth frame. He led off the
inning with a walk, stole second and
third, and crossed the plate on a sacri- 1
fice fly, beating the ball in by inches.
