# ATHLETIC AWARD PLAN PASSES AT MEETING OF EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
## WARNER OPPOSES SYSTEM New Proposition to Be Voted On at A. S. S. U. Election May 26

Voters at the spring A. S. S. U.
elections will reject or accept the plan
for reform in the athletic award sys

be put on the list by action of the
director of the gymnasium and the
coaching staff.
Awards for these sports are to be
