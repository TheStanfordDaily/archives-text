# ATHLETIC AWARD PLAN PASSES AT MEETING OF EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE
## WARNER OPPOSES SYSTEM New Proposition to Be Voted On at A. S. S. U. Election May 26 
### 
Voters at the spring A. S. S. U.
elections will reject or accept the plan
for reform in the athletic award sys
tem as a result of the new proposi
tion's sanction by the Executive Com
mittee at its meeting last night. The
plan was submitted by a special com
mittee appointed last month to investi
gate the present awards system.
By a vote of seven to four the spe
cial committee endorsed the plan Mon
day night and recommended it in its
present form to the Executive Com
mittee. Those on the coaching staff
favoring the plan were Andrew Kerr,
Harry Wolter, R. L. Templeton, E. P.
Hunt, H. W. Maloney, E. M. Brand
sten, C. M. Sprague, and those op
posed to the plan were G. S. Warner,
W. H. Barrow, P. H. Davis, H. M.
Davis.
The plan, which will be released for
publication Thursday or Friday, pro
vided for four major sports, football,
track, basketball, and baseball; four
sports, tennis, swimming, box
ing, and soccer; auxiliary sports as fol
lows: cross country, fencing, weight
basketball, wrestling, golf, gymnasium,
and handball. Any of these sports may
change in their classification by a ma
jority vote at the A. S. S. U. elections,
while additional auxiliary sports may
be put on the list by action of the
director of the gymnasium and the
coaching staff.
Awards for these sports are to be
the block "S" for the major sports,
circle block "S" for the minor sports,
and gold medals for the auxiliary
teams. This would do away with the
second class minor "S" now in vogue.
The type of awards in the same sport
would be a standard Cardinal sweater
of any style for the first award with a
white block "S," and for the second
major award the athlete would be
given the choice between any type of
standard sweater either cardinal or
white, or a gold block "S" medal, and
for the third award the choice be
tween a standard sweater, red or
white, with three stars, or a block "S"
medal, or a block "S" blanket with
three stars.
The minor awards would be the
same except for a circle block "S" in
stead of the block "S." Freshman
awards would be a standard V-neck
sweater with block numerals and any
freshman winning his numerals in
four major sports would receive a
white coat sweater with red block
numerals. Minor sports would be the
usual block circle numerals.
Any man winning a national cham
pionship in swimming, tennis, track, or
boxing, or competing in the Olympic
Games would receive a block "S."
Changes in the requirements for
awards were made in that five min
utes of play in the Stanford-California
football game would entitle a man to
a block "S," and several other quali
fications were outlined which will be
stated in the plan when published.
Minor sports awards, except for swim
ming, would be given merely for com
petition, while a swimmer must win a
point or fraction thereof in thp Stan
ford-California meet.

of any style for the first award with a
white block "S," and for the second
major award the athlete would be

usual block circle numerals.
Any man winning a national cham
pionship in swimming, tennis, track, or
boxing, or competing in the Olympic

Changes in the requirements for
awards were made in that five min

stated in the plan when published.
Minor sports awards, except for swim

point or fraction thereof in thp Stan
ford-California meet.
