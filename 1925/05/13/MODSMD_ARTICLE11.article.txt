## Marietta Fry, Hulda Hoover, Opposed by T. F. Baer And R. C. Stroup 
### 
That women should pay one-half of
all dating expenses is the assertion to
be defended by the Women's Debating
Society against Euphronia tonight at
7:30 o'clock in the lobby of the Old
Union.
Marietta Fry and Hulda Hoover wil!
uphold the affirmative and T. F. Baei
and R. C. Stroup will uphold the nega
tive. The speeches will be quite short
and an open forum discussion will be
conducted in Oxford style following
the debate.
The question is one that has at
tracted much attention recently, and
a debate on a question similar to that
of tonight was held last month at the J
University of California.
This is the second forum of the
quarter sponsored by Euphronia for
discussing problems of interest. The j
next open forum will be held next j
Wednesday, following the debate be-!
tween Euphronia and San Jose Teach
ers College.
