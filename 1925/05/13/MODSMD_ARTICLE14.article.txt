# MINOR SPORTS' SUCCESS DUE TO HARRY MALONEY
## 
### 
For sixteen years Stanford has been
fortunate in having as a member of
its athletic faculty, H. W. Maloney,
director of minor sports and associate
director of the Department of Physical
Education. He introduced minor
sports, which have since played an
important part in Stanford's athletic
activity.
Maloney has actively participated in
athletics and athletic coaching since
before 1899 at which time he was
physical instructor in the British army.;
Just previous to the Boer War, in
which Maloney served, he was light-1
weight boxing champion of the British
army. During the World War in 1917-
18 Malofley was a captain and athletic i
officer for the American Expeditionary j
Forces. He Was in charge of track and
field activities. In 1920 he was on the j
Olympic Commission in charge of
rugby for the United States in the'
Olympic Games.

Last summer Maloney accompanied j
a Stanford tennis squad of four men j
who played in competition at most of i
the important cities in Australia and ,
adjoining islands.
Maloney contributes athletic articles j
for a number of sporting and other.
magazines. An analysis of the sensa- j
tional demonstrations of Nurmi and:
his countrymen will soon appear in the
California Sports Magazine. He also
writes for the Referee, a leading Brit
ish sporting journal, and Lawn Tennis j
Life and Athletic Training, two Austra
lian magazines. In the Stanford Illus
trated Review to appear on May 15,
Maloney will have an article entitled ,
Stanford Men Across the Equator.
This summer at Stanford Maloney j
will be a member of the faculty of
the school of coaching as an instructor
in two courses: Development Athletics
for Boys, and the Theory and Practice
of Boxing.
