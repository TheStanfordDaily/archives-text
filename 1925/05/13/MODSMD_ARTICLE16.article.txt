# BOTH FINALISTS WILL GET MEDALS FOR BOXING BOUTS
## 
### 
Medals for the University champion
ship boxing tournament have already
been ordered by Harry Maloney. The
awards for both the champion and
runner-up in each division will be
identical except for the inscriptions.
Formerly but one medal was given
for the championship bouts, so that
the runner-up received no recognition
for his ability. This year the former
boxing champions who are donating
the medals are offering an extra I)rize
to encourage further participation in
boxing. All men students interested in
boxing as a collegiate sport are urged
by Harry Maloney to sign up for the
tournament, as they will be able to
receive valuable experience from par
ticipation in the bouts.
Maloney will be in the boxing room
next week to give pointers to those
intending to compete in the champion
ships. He expects to get a line on
material for next year's varsity team.
Under the new awards plan which will
be voted on at the spring elections
boxing is one of the four minor sports
which will receive a block circle "S."
The University championship fenc
ing tournament will be run off at the
same time as the boxing bouts. J.
Donovan Flint, former Stanford boxer
and fencer, has donated a cup for the
winner. The trophy will become the
permanent possession of the first man
to win it two years in succession. The
wrestling meet which was also sche
duled will probably not be held be
cause of the lack of interest shown
in it.
Medals for the winners of each divi
sion in the boxing, fencing, and wrest
[ ling tourneys of the novice champion
i ships held last quarter will be out at
| the same time as the University cham
i pionship awards.
