# GOLF TEAM ELECTS R. E. LANG CAPTAIN
## 
### 
The golf team at its meeting Monday
elected R. E. Lang to captain the squad
next year. Lang showed up well in his
match with California this year and
played a fine game in the Del Monte
matches. Prospects are bright for a
first class squad next year as the
freshman team has developed several
promising youngsters who should give
the varsity men a hard tussle for their
berths next season. Meyberg and Stan
ley, both members of the frosh squad,
have shown up unusually well in the
past season.
