# REFERENCE LIBRARY HAS FICTION BOOKS OVERLOOKED BY MANY
## 
### 
Many features of the library are not
generally known by the students. Miss
Hays, in the reference library, has
pointed out one particular shelf of
books that many have looked for and
never found.
Students have complained that there
is never any new popular fiction in
the library; this is true in that such
things as best sellers and yellow-back
fiction are not purchased. However,
stories that have been out just long
enough to get established and recog
nized by the best critics are received
every week. The first week these
books are put on one.side of the "New
Books" shelf and are there for inspec
tion purposes only, they are then
transferred to the stacks for general
distribution, there are quite a few of
the most interesting books kept by
Miss Hays for a longer time and placed
on the other side of the case. These
books may be taken out by students
in the regular manner, except that the
reference librarian checks them in and
out.
