# The 						Award Reform
## 
### 
Approval for the plan to reform the granting of athletic awards was
voted last night by the Executive Committee. The recommendation of
the committee which has promulgated the proposed change takes the form
of an amendment to the A. S. S. U. constitution and, as such, it will be
either accepted or rejected by the vote of the entire student-body.
At the very beginning of the agitation to do something or other about
the awards, an illuminating parallel was drawn. It was said that if the
Kimberley diamond mines dumped all of their products on the market,
the value of the jewel would be about that of cut glass. The value of the
block "S" was intimated to be of comparative value, and the trust methods
of the gem miners were suggested to restore the athletic awards to a de
sirable (?) value.
Just what is intended when an athlete is given a sweater has already
been discussed. It seems reasonable, however, that anybody who has
represented Stanford athletically should have the same right to the Uni
versity insignia as anybody else. To exclude participants in all but eight
sports from the right to wear any form of sweater "S" award, is unright
eous discrimination.
It is the announced policy of the University to encourage sport for all.
To discourage commensurate recognition for all would be outrageously in
consistent. Any such segregation of a group of sports is a definite slight
upon them. It seems that they have been found comparatively unpopular
—which has the same relation to profit that leprosy has to health.
In every discussion of athletics at Stanford, it is pointed out that an
extraordinarily large per cent of the student-body participates in athletics
of one sort or another. A large share of these men are found to be en
gaging in minor sports. Yet, money for additional equipment to properly
outfit the growing groups is harder and harder to get when the budget is
made out. Some of these sports, the foundations for so many proud
boasts, are to be set apart —the participants forbidden to wear the sweater
insignia of the University.
Tennis, a sport which has brought much recognition, is to be a minor
sport. Polo is not even included as an auxiliary activity. Weight basket
ball men need no longer worry about their letters if the plan goes through.
There won't be any, win or lose.
The Daily Palo Alto some time ago promoted a straw ballot to
demonstrate the difficulty which would be presented in deciding between
major and minor sports. Teams organized and campaigned to gain place.
Others, being squeezed out, retaliated. A fair sample of the unpleasant
ness of the proposed discrimination was had. Also, a fair sample senti
ment was had.
The committee has avoided the difficulty of having the student choose
between sports by selecting the groups themselves. Attendance figures are
the measures, not participation figures. Approval of the plan means ap
proval of the groups.
The substance of the proposition of the Executive Committee is to be
found in the news columns. The recommendation will be printed verbatim
as soon as it his been finally prepared.
Contrary or supporting opinions are sought.

—which has the same relation to profit that leprosy has to health.
In every discussion of athletics at Stanford, it is pointed out that an
extraordinarily large per cent of the student-body participates in athletics
of one sort or another. A large share of these men are found to be en
gaging in minor sports. Yet, money for additional equipment to properly
outfit the growing groups is harder and harder to get when the budget is
made out. Some of these sports, the foundations for so many proud
boasts, are to be set apart —the participants forbidden to wear the sweater
insignia of the University.
Tennis, a sport which has brought much recognition, is to be a minor
sport. Polo is not even included as an auxiliary activity. Weight basket
ball men need no longer worry about their letters if the plan goes through.
There won't be any, win or lose.
The Daily Palo Alto some time ago promoted a straw ballot to
demonstrate the difficulty which would be presented in deciding between
major and minor sports. Teams organized and campaigned to gain place.
Others, being squeezed out, retaliated. A fair sample of the unpleasant
ness of the proposed discrimination was had. Also, a fair sample senti
ment was had.
The committee has avoided the difficulty of having the student choose
between sports by selecting the groups themselves. Attendance figures are
the measures, not participation figures. Approval of the plan means ap
proval of the groups.
The substance of the proposition of the Executive Committee is to be
found in the news columns. The recommendation will be printed verbatim
as soon as it his been finally prepared.
Contrary or supporting opinions are sought.
Approval for the plan to reform the granting of athletic awards was
voted last night by the Executive Committee. The recommendation of
the committee which has promulgated the proposed change takes the form
of an amendment to the A. S. S. U. constitution and, as such, it will be
either accepted or rejected by the vote of the entire student-body.
At the very beginning of the agitation to do something or other about
the awards, an illuminating parallel was drawn. It was said that if the
Kimberley diamond mines dumped all of their products on the market,
the value of the jewel would be about that of cut glass. The value of the
block "S" was intimated to be of comparative value, and the trust methods
of the gem miners were suggested to restore the athletic awards to a de
sirable (?) value.
Just what is intended when an athlete is given a sweater has already
been discussed. It seems reasonable, however, that anybody who has
represented Stanford athletically should have the same right to the Uni
versity insignia as anybody else. To exclude participants in all but eight
sports from the right to wear any form of sweater "S" award, is unright
eous discrimination.
It is the announced policy of the University to encourage sport for all.
To discourage commensurate recognition for all would be outrageously in
consistent. Any such segregation of a group of sports is a definite slight
upon them. It seems that they have been found comparatively unpopular
—which has the same relation to profit that leprosy has to health.
