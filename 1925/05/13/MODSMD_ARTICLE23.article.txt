Stanford may take a passive attitude towards plans for a league which
would include some of the leading colleges in California. It is apparently
a question of what kind of company Stanford will be forced to keep, and,
perhaps, a question of feasibility. The plans are by no means mature and
the league is quite problematical! Probability and feasibility, however,
might be outweighed to a great extent by advisability.
There is some need for an organization which will sponsor more in
terest in baseball among college students. Competition with the more ex
pert professional clique is, of course, quite beyond reason. But something
which would elevate the sport among colleges to the extent where compe
tition would approach, to some degree, that engendered by fodtball,
basketball, and track, is striving for a suitable ideal. —D. C. M.
