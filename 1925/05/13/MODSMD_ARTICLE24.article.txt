# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT

The Editor, Sir:
The writer of the Viewpoint in Tues
day's issue sets forth a view of the
function of the Daily Palo Alto that
many will not accept, lie wrote: "Its
greatest function is to give recogni
tion to those whose efforts have given
us the campus activities in which we
nil take a natural pride." In other
words, the gentleman wishes the paper
to he a daily advertisement run in the
interest of certain groups on the cam
pus.
His general criticism seemed to be
that the Opera had not been reviewed
sufficiently well. An analysis of the
review shows that the reviewer favor
ably discusses 2!» items and comments
somewhat unfavorably upon 5 items.

One wonders what your critic expects.
Does he think it the work of a re
viewer to Rive honeyed words of praise
to every item in the program?
My own opinion of th function of
the Daily is that it should present stu
dent news without catering to the in
terests of cliques, reflect student
thought if there is any, and give a
moderate amount of attention to other
campuses and the rest of the world.
In my opinion the present editor is
the most independent editor for some
time. More power to him. •—D. M. C.

The Department of Architecture of
the University of Washington was ad
mitted to the national Association of
Collegiate Schools of Architecture last
week, a distinction which is shared by
only eighteen universities.
