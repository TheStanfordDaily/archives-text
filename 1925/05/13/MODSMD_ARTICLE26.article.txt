How to Break News
Some news is very fragile and con
sequently very easily broken. Other
news belongs to the same class of
unbreakables as cocoanuts, Ingersoll
watches, cannonballs, and face pow
der. Fragile news may be broken by
making many marks on a piece of
paper, and throwing it in the waste
basket or against the wall. The impact
of the marks against the wall will
usually shatter it to bits.
News that can not be broken in this
way may often be cracked by placing
it in a typewriter and pressing all the
keys at once. If this fails, fairly solid
news may be broken by giving it to a
news editor, but this method is quite
dangerous because news handled in
this way often explodes spontaneously.
If all methods prove ineffectual, try
hatchets, pile-drivers, or dynamite.
How to Break a Date
Blind dates are the easiest dates to
break; heavy dates are the most dif
ficult. Dates may be broken with a
telephone in the following manner:
Take receiver from hook, say various
things into mouthpiece, wax eloquent,
gently replace receiver on hook.
Sometimes many other things are
also broken along with the date.
Dates may be broken by throwing
various things at them such as bulls
and bouquets.
How to break rock:
Sneak up from behind and run over
a speed cop who is chasing somebody.
