# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
The somewhat benighted author of
the Viewpoint in yesterday's paper has
apparently a liking for the act known
as going in off the deep end. In more
appropriate words, he wrote before
he thought, which is in itself no griev
ous fault but still one to be avoided by
those who are, so to speak, A la mode.
Before we go on at length, let it be
known to the world at large that Mr.
Cabbages attended the Opera. We are
quite certain of this. So certain, that
our next month's allowance would be
cheerfully wagered. Mr. Cabbages had
the somewhat questionable honor of
occupying the seat adjoining ours.
Mr. S. S. C.is perhaps not well
acquainted with the art of reviewing.
Let it be brought to his attention that
the task of the critic lies solely in giv
ing his readers his own reactions to
ward the dramatic offering, or what
ever else it happens to be. If he liked
it. all well and good; if it so happened
that it was not to his taste, the same
trite expression may be employed. The
task of praising those who have worked
towards a successful production. If it
were, the profession of dramatic critic
would soon go the way of all evil
things.
Permit us to make a surmise at this
point. Mayhap Mr. Cabbages omitted
to mention "A Certain Specialty" be
cause he has an inborn sense of some
thing or other that forbids him saying
terrible and naughty things about
beautiful maidens. Now please don't
oecome enraged, noble knight, this is
only a surmise, and as such let it pass.
It was a darn good opera and every
one conected with the show should
receive the proper credit due —accord-
ing to the reviewer. —B. T.
