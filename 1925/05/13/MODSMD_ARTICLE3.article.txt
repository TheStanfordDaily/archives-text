## 
### 
Dr. William Austin Cannon, gradu
ate of Stanford and Columbia Univer
sities, research associate of the Car
negie Institute of Washington, has
come to Stanford to conduct experi
ments on root growth.
By research work the relation of
root growth to their different environ
ments is determined. Temperature,
soil, and supply of oxygen are taken
into consideration. Experiments show
ing the relationship of roots to plant
habit and growth are being conducted.
Various plants are used for botanical
research. Experimentation on the red
wood has been started. In regard to
the redwood, Dr. Cannon's special
work is leaf preservation.
Before coming to Stanford Dr. Can
non carried on extensive research
work in the general observation of
roots in the field. Traveling about dif
ferent parts of the United States,
northern and southern Africa, and cen
tral Australia, Dr. Cannon gathered
valuable material on root growth
which was published by the Carnegie
Institute.
