The budget of the 1926 Quad shows
that the $G paid l>y purchasers of the
book represents only about three-fifths
of the actual cost of the book. Each
completed Quad will have cost a total
of $10 for materials, printing, art work
and many other items. The difference
is borne chiefly by the advertising
which is bringing in about $4500 and
by organizations, fraternities, and
sororities who pay for their pages.
A complete summary of the Quad's
expenses given out by the managerial
staff shows how expenses are divided.
In each book the following items are
represented: printing, $3.50; engrav
ing, $2.25; paper, 75c; covers, 50c;
photography, 25c; art work, 50c; sal
aries, $1.00; students' fund, 25c; and
miscellaneous, $1. The students' fund
charge is the cost of the expert book
keeping and accounting demanded by
University regulations. Under the
heading of miscellaneous comes office
supplies, running expenses, staff and
tryoutee expenses, and a small excess
for purposes of a safety margin. This
totals $10i Of this $6 is paid by each
Quad purchaser, advertising brings in
approximately $2.25 per book, and the
remaining $1.75 comes from the pages
devoted to organizations and living
groups.
Over 2,000 Quads will be printed,
about 250 being distributed as compli
mentary copies. Engravers, printers,
other universities and their officials
get 150. About 100 reach high schools
throughout the country where they
serve to spread information about
Stanford and its activities. The Book
store gets 50 copies at reduced rates.
Only 300 copies remain to be sold
the student body, and these will all
be disposed of during the sale being
held daily this week at Engineer's Cor
ner.
The financing of a Quad represents
a considerable sum. The cost of put
ting out this issue will reach $20,000.
About $4500 worth of advertising has
been obtained. This is larger than the
advertising section in any other Quad.
Almost two-thirds of the student
body are represented in the sale of
between 1800 and 1900 books direct
on the campus. This is a much higher
ratio than is maintained at California
by sale of the "Blue and Gold" annual.
The finished Quad represents over a
year of work by two staffs, managerial
and business, and their tryoutees.
