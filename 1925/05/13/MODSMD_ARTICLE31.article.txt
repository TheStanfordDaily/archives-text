# RETURNS OF GOLF QUESTIONNAIRE ARE PUBLISHED BY KERR
## 
### 
Appearing in the April number of
the Athletic Journal is an article writ
ten by Andy Kerr, Stanford football
and basketball coach, concerning the
status of intercollegiate golf and its
further possibilities in American uni
versities.
The article contained the informa
tion gained from a questionnaire which
Kerr sent to approximately one hun
dred and fifty colleges throughout the
country for the purpose of finding out
how the question of intercollegiate
golf was being solved. Sixty-five an
swers were received, giving a concen
sus of opinion of the schools that are
interested in golf competition.
The first factor is that golf is no
longer being considered an old man's
game. The interest that is being taken
by the various colleges clearly indi
cates the fallacy of this belief. The
second fallacy about the game is that
a golfer must be the possessor of an
income far above the average. The
questionnaire shows that the colleges
at which golf is recognized either
have their own courses, or have made
satisfactory provision to play on the
greens of nearby clubs at a nominal
cost. From the data obtained an aver
age cost per year of approximately
?r>oo is sufficient to provide means of
support for the intercollegiate com
petitive teams representing the college.
Golf is recognized as a minor sport
at the various schools except at the
University of Chicago, where there is
no division of sports into major and
minor categories; at the University of
Colorado, and Northwestern Univer
sity. The latter two include golf as a
major sport. Various methods of
awarding participants in intercollegi
ate matches were advanced by the
questionnaire returns. In institutions
where golf is a minor sport, major
awards are given to representatives
making an'exceptional record in some
tournament.
The information derived by means
of the questionnaire wjfll be of special
value to Stanford, where there has
been a growing demand from the
golfers for a representative golf team.

Seniors at. the University of Colo
rado have heen excused from spring
final examinations.
