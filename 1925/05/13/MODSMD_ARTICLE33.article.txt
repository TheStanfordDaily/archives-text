DECLASSE—STANFORD
THEATER.
Some two or three years ago Miss
Ethel Barrymore came to Sail Francisco
and presented Zoe Akin's "Declase."
Hollywood has since taken a crack at
this play. We are not possessed of in
sight of particular keenness, yet' we can
notice some resemblance between the
two; not very much, it's true, but it's
there. Of course, there is no rule to the
effect that a movie should follow the
original script, but when the producers
have the nerve to use the original title
they should at least preserve a bit of
the play.
Now that we have thus relieved our
selves, we may proceed to the more seri
ous business of praising the pulchritude
of one Corinne Griffith. If a contest
were to be initiated in which the prize
would be awarded to the most beautiful
woman on the screen, Corinne Griffith
would come awfully close to snatching
the laurel—we should say she would be
medalist (this is not a sports now).
If one were to compare the acting of
La Barrymore with that of the fair
Corinne, it wouldn't take a mind reader
to tell us who would conic out on top.
However, no one but a confounded
moron would think of going to see this
damsel with the idea in mind that they
were going to sec some awfully good
acting. So much for an overworked
topic of conversation.
This chap who takes the part of the
evil husband is good. He's nearly the
worst looking husband of the year; and
he does some good stuff in the first part
of the picture which makes up more or
less for the terrible sub-titles. Oh,
they're fierce! Then there is the also
evil Mr. Solomon, who is so gentlemanly
that it's almost impossible to realize thac
we should hate him.
Now for Lloyd Hughes! This laddie

goes to good old South Africa shortly
after the opening of the show and
doesn't get back until a minute or so be
fore the final act. Every night here
after we shall offer a prayer of thank
fulness for this bit of our terrestial
sphere—please don't take us as commit
ting ourselves on the power of prayer.
And, by the by, do all the inhabitants of
South Africa wear cork helmets?
Maybe there is a municipal ordinance
making this article of dress compulsory.
