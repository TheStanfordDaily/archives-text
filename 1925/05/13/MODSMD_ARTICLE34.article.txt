## 
### 
Saturday evening at the Whitcomb
Hotel in San Francisco the School
masters Club of California gave a din
ner and had as guests members of Phi

ternity. Professor William M. Proctor,
with Elmer H. Staffelbaek D. L.
Zyve, C. E. Purviance, and A. B. Sias,
education graduates, attended from
the Stanford chapter.
The dinner was given so that the
members of the Schoolmasters Club
and Phi Delta Kappa might have the
opportunity of hearing reports made
by the committee which is now mak
ing a survey of the curricula in ele
mentary schools in the state of Cali
fornia.
The investigation was undertaken at
the request of Will C. Wood and is
being carried on as one of the studies
conducted by the Commonwealth
Foundation. Among the educational
leaders who spoke were Professor
Charles H. Judd, psychology professor
at the University of Chicago; W. W.
Charters, of the University of Chicago;
Joseph M. Gwinn, superintendent of
San Francisco schools; Henry W. Suz
zallo, Stanford graduate now at the
University of Washington; Meredith,
commissioner of public schools in Con
necticut; Dr. George C. Kyte, of the
University of California; Lotus D.
Coffman, president of the University
of Minnesota; and William C. Bag
gerly, professor of education at Teach
ers College, Columbia.
Dr. Judd, in speaking of this sur
vey in California, said it is but one
investigation to be studied under the
auspices of the Commonwealth Foun
dation, and that similar surveys would
be made in other states in the attempt
to standardize elementary curricula
throughout the country.
The work of the committee is at
present not ready for publication; but
as a direct result of this survey a bill
has been introduced which lowers the
number of required subjects in the
grammar grades from thirty-one to
twelve. This bill has been passed by
the legislature and is up for the gov
ernor's signature.
