# DEBATING FINANCES SHOW IMPROVEMENT BY BUDGET SAVING
## 
### 
Debating lias proved practically self
supporting for the first time in many
years, having spent a net amount of,
$3500, while the budget approved at the j
beginning of the year by the Executive
Committee allotted $500 for debating,
expenses. This is a net saving of $150
to the A. S. S. IT.
Expenditures for the current year
have amounted to approximately $825
dollars, including the expenses of the
trip taken south spring vacation, the i
Oxford debate, and contests with the
Kansas Agricultural College, the Utah
Agricultural College, and the Joffre de
bate with California. Expenses of the !
southern trip Avere guaranteed by the
southern opponents. Departing from
the custom of the past, admission this '
year was charged for the debate with !
Oxford, thus defraying the guarantee ;
advanced for expenses of the Oxford j
team. The total income from debating
from an activity heretofore exceeding j
budget sums to an activity that saves 1
the stpdent money, is due to Robert E.
Littler, debating manager, according
to O. H. Tucker, assistant to the gen
eral manager. Littler, winner of the
Joffre debate medal last year and a
member of the team to represent Stan- !
ford against the Oxford debaters, has ;
had charge of the finances this year,
managing them in such a way as to j
provide a maximum number of foren-!
sic contests at a minimum cost of ex-.
penditures.
