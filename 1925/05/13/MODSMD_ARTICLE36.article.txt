# JUNIOR SOCCER SQUAD BEATEN, TRIPLE TIE RESULTS
## 
### 
By unexpectedly defeating the jun
iors 3 to 2 yesterday on a slippery
field in the last interclass game, the
aophomore soccer team caused a triple
tie for second place. The seniors won
the championship without losing a
jsingle game, while the freshmen, jun
iors, and sophomores tied for second,
each winning a game.
Playing in a pouring rain, both
squads were at a great disadvantage,
and numerous penalties were called
as a result. The fast junior forward
line failed to show its usual speed,
and attempts to break through the
sophomore defense were repeatedly
blocked by the second-year backs.
Campbell, junior fullback, headed the
ball into his own goal for the sopho
mores' first tally.
Miron, inside right, succeeded in
making a goal when the sophomore
goalkeeper let the ball slip through.
Another score was made by the sopho
mores when Lewis, inside left, booted
the ball into the net after kicking it
while it was still in the air. After
kicking to within scoring distance,
Miron passed to Espy, inside left, who
made the juniors' second goal.
During the second half honors were
about even, although Wool, sophomore
outside right, kicked the winning goal
for the sophomores in this period. Both
aggregations fought desperately in the
last ten minutes of play.
McCarty, Wool, and Stollery starred
for the sophomores' while Miron, Hay,
-and Franklin were outstanding junior
players.
