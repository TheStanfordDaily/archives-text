# ALLEN RESUMES CONCERTS WITH RECITAL SUNDAY
## 
### 
Memorial Church organ recitals
by Warren D. Allen, University or
ganist, will be resumed with a con
cert Sunday afternoon after a lapse
of several months in which the in
strument has been undergoing ex
tensive remodeling and enlarge
ments.
The new console, which is similar
to the one supplied by the Skinner
Organ Company for the organ in
the San Francisco Palace of the
Legion of Honor, will be heard for
the first time. It has four keyboard
manuals and a complete set of
stops, which will allow for future
additions.
The chambers housing the pipes
have been enlarged so that new
sets of pipes may be installed as
soon as enough funds are had. The
action has been remodeled, and a
new high-pressure rotary blower
will be used to supply the air.
