# OUTLOOK FOR SPRING CROPS FAVORABLE SAYS WHEAT STUDIES
## 
### 
The early outlook for spring wheat
is unusually favorable and on the
whole the world outlook for 1925 crops
does not warrant expectations of a
repetition of the world shortage of
1924-25 nor of the abundance charac
teristic of 1923-24, according to Wheat
Studies just issued by the Food He
search Institute of Stanford Univer
sity.
Winter wheat acreage has increased
and larger spring wheat acreage is in
prospect, says Wheat Studies, and
present indications point to poor crops
of winter wheat in India, Russia, and
the United States, but good crops in
Europe and North Africa. Favorable
crops in Europe are declared to be
especially significant since import re
quirements are largely determined by
Europe's demand.
According to the report it may never
be possible to explain the course of
wheat prices in recent months which
practically doubled between May and
January, and fell in March to some 50
cents lower.
"However," they say, "the theory
that the break in prices injured the
farmers of the country has little basis
in current experience. There was little
merchantable wheat still in the
farmers' hands in March. Growers who
had retained wheat during the winter
marketed the bulk of it at $1,50 or
better. Speculation probably worked
to their benefit rather than to their
disadvantage. The trade, the flour mil
ler, and speculator suffered most."

of Washington is entering upon a
period of extensive training for the
national intercollegiate regatta to be
held on the Hudson, June 22. The
Washington crew won the national
regatta last year.
