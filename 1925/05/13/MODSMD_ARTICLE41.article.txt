A chessboard and chessmen showing
the moves in the correspondence
match with California will be placed
in the Bookstore window this week, it
was announced at the meeting of the
Cardinal Chess Club held last night in
the Trophy Room of the Old Union.
The match with Davis Agricultural
College, scheduled for last night, was
postponed until next fall, as circum
stances prevented the Davis team from
making the trip.
The chessboard and men to be dis
played are of painted cardboard and
were made by W. H. Jacobs. Anyone
interested in the match is urged to
offer suggestions.
