# PROBABILITY OF LIFE ON MARS EXPLAINED IN AITKEN LECTURE
## Less Dense Atmosphere in 1926 Expected to Favor New Observations 
### 
"The balance of evidence favors
some form of life on Mars," said Pro
fessor Robert G. Aitken, director of
Lick Observatory, in his lecture, "Our
Neighbor Planet, Mars," last night in
the Little Theatre.
"The dark patches on Mars show a
distinctly green tint. This is taken by
many astronomers to denote the pres
ence of vegetation on the planet. If
any vegetation is there it is probably
a low form of animal life. But there is
no evidence on Mars or any other
planet of the existence of our system
of intelligent life."
Aitken said that observations made
in August, 1924, can only be considered
as preliminary to those which will be
made in 1926, when Mars, although
further from the earth, will be in a
more favorable position because of
less dense atmosphere.
Aitken began his lecture by giving
statistics and facts that are accepted
as beyond dispute by all astronomers.
He then showed pictures of the celes
tial bodies made by both cameras and
hand drawings and pointed out the
basis for the conclusions drawn by
eminent astronomers.
He also showed diagrams and photo
graphs of the planet Mars, pointing
out that the various drawings, al
though totally different, were the hon
est representations of what various
men saw. The straight lines on the
surface of the planet were the particu
lar point of difference.
"It is now considered by practically
all astronomers that the lines on Mars
are natural and not artificial mark
ings," said Professor Aitken.
