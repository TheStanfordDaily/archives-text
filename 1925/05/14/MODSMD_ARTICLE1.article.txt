# CARDINAL, OLYMPIC TRACK IN MEET SECOND TIME
## Templeton, Hunter to Point Teams for Coast, A.A.U. Championships 
### Douglas Meservey 
Stanford and the Olympic Club are
staging a mutual "benefit" Saturday
when the track teams of the two meet
for the second time on the stadium
track.
The first contest between the club
men and Coach R. L. Templeton's
tracksters was just two months ago,
March 14, and was a complete victory
for the Cards, 82 to 49.
Saturday, in the return meet, both
squads will incidentally be out again
for the long end of the score, but their
real purpose will be to engage in
practice competition before the crucial
meets that are in store for each. Coach
Hunter of the Olympic Club is point
ing his men for the National A. A. U.
track championships to be held in
Golden Gate Park July 4 and 5 while
ference meet ahead.
Templeton has the Pacific Coast Con-
Olympic Chances Good
As far as the actual results are con
cerned, Hunter has a good chance to
secure revenge for his defeat in
March. He has added a number of
stars to his list in the past month
while Templeton, on the other hand,
having no Big Meet to look forward
to; has lost several of his men. Conse
quently, the Card strength should be
less than for some time, even though
it will probably be those who show
good work Saturday who will make
the trip north to Seattle.
As in the first meet, individual bat
tles between rivals of long standing
should be the order of the day. Chief
among these will be the triangular
fight between Lockart of the Club and
Kerr and Smith of Stanford in the
mile.
Charles, veteran two-miler of Tem
pleton's squad, will probably not run
against the clubmen under the orders
of both Templeton and Charles' physi
cian.
