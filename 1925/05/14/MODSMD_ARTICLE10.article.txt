With a 208-pound handicap, C. W. !

deavor to smash all existing bicycling
records between San Francisco and
Palo Alto Wednesday.
Rosenbaum, when eluded on his atli-;
letic prowess, made the statement that j
he could cover the distance between j
the metropolis and the farm in seven j
hours. A few small bets were laid on I
the outcome, and he is now in hard j
