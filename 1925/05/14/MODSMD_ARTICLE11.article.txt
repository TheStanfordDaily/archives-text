President R. L. Wilbur presented j
j Stanford to the Board of Trustees and
I the Academic Counqil," as a Univer
| sity which must keep abreast a chang- :
ing world, which must maintain a j
spirit of willingness to experiment," j
at a dinner given by the Board of !
Trustees to the Academic Council at j
the Stanford Union last night.
"In ten years as president," he told i
them, "I have learned to be skeptical j
of courses and to value men more and '
more." President Wilbur said he wants !
to get teachers of originality and lead-!
ership.
Approximately 150 members of the i
faculty and the Board of Trustees were
present at dinner, an annual gathering I
to give both bodies an opportunity to '
talk over the University from a com- j
mon point of view.
William Mayo Newhall, president of j
the Board of Trustees, presided. He j
presented each of the five other speak- |
ers, and during the evening remarked
that it is fine to be a trustee and "get !
credit for what the faculty do."
Professor Douglas H. Campbell of
the Botany department, representing
the old guard, told the gathering that j
at Stanford he has had an opportunity i
in his own sciences not available any
where else in the world; that if he;
had his life to live again, he would j
choose to live it in his immediate sur- j
roundings.
T. T. C. Gregory, also a Stanford
graduate and treasurer of the Univer
sity, in speaking as a member of the
Board of Trustees, told of the new !
policy of converting the University's |
low-interest-bearing securities for high
interest-bearing securities. In one year
the University's income has been in
creased $40,000, he said.
An international flavor was added
to the dinner when Dr. Alexander i
Findlay, visiting professor of chemis
try from the University of Aberdeen,
Scotland, gave his impressions of Stan
ford as compared with the University
of Aberdeen. He said he had been im
pressed with the spaciousness of the
Stanford campus and the spirit of co
operation, sometimes expressed as the
"family spirit" of the campus.
