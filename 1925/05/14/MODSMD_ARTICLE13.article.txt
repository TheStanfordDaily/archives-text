## 
### Hulda Hoover 
The cornerstone of the Leland Stan-i
ford Jr. Museum which contains many
valuable exhibits was laid on May 14,
| 1891. It was opened to visitors in 1898
i but was not finally completed until
some years later. Additions and altera
tions have been made from time to
time since then.
When the museum was first opened
in 1894 all the exhibits were arranged
i under the personal supervision of Mrs.
| Stanford and many were labeled and

j conceived in 1880 when Leland Stan
! ford Jr., then eleven years old, accom
panied his parents to Europe. The col
lection in Room 10 is the result of
, this trip and is in itself the nucleus
of the museum. After this Leland kept
! adding to his collection with the aid
1 of his parents. The memorial collec
tion includes objects from all over
| the world*
