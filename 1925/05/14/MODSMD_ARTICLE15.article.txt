team but was also accorded poor sup
port.

tan came back in its half of the inning

championship of League I by a score
of 8 to 5. El Capitan won the right to
meet Alpha Kappa Lambda today for
the title in League VII by eliminating
Delta Upsilon 5 to 3, yesterday after
noon.
The El Campo-Theta Xi affair was a
rather listless game, both teams play
ing a ragged game in the field. Theta
Xi started off with the intention of
sewing the contest up in the early
innings by scoring three runs in the
first frame. El Campo came back with
one run in its half of the first, and
evened the count in the second by
tallying two runs.
Both teams counted one run in the
third, and El Campo cinched the con
test in the fifth by annexing three
tallies. Theta Xi attempted to stage
a rally in the sixth but only succeeded
in scoring one run.

nine, had his first off day of the sea
son yesterday afternoon. He got him
self into several bad holes and erratic
fielding on the part of his teammates
only made matters worse. Britton
pitched a fairly good game for the club
team but was also accorded poor sup
port.
