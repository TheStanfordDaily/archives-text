# C. E. CLASSES VISIT HETCHY AQUEDUCT
## 
### 
Professor L. B. Reynold's water sup
ply class and Professor W. R. Eckart's
hydraulic machinery class made a trip
this morning to inspect the bay cross
ing of the Hetch-Hetchy aqueduct, ac
cording to plans made on the invita
tionof C. R. Rankin, chief field engi
neer of the Hetch-Hetchy project.
The underwater line is of very un
usual and interesting construction.
Two 42-inch cast iron pipe lines with
a flexible ball-joint construction are
being laid in a dredged channel across
the bay. Just before the pipe is laid,
molten lead is poured around the
joints. This allows the pipe to conform
with the irregularities of the bay floor
before the lead hardens.
The apparatus used in this construc
tion was brought from New York,
where it was employed in laying the
Catskill aqueduct. At the bay crossing
there is also a rivieted steel pipe
which is laid across a bridge.
