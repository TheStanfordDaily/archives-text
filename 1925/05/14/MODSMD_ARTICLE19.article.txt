# Who Owes Who!

As far back as most of us can remember we have been hearing that
"the woman pays." But, all it has meant in the past was that the house
wife handed a dime to the milkman or a dollar to the butcher's boy. Since
Euphronia in an open forum last night approved the suggested plan of
allowing women to pay half of the expenses incurred while on a "date"
we begin to see some light on the meaning of the trite remark "the woman
pays."
If the women can't find anything else to spend their money for, good
ness knows no one is going to stop them from buying their own food,
transportation, and entertainment. Of course, it will mean that those who
habitually go places every night will find themselves becoming manicurists,
hair dressers, bootblacks, and seamstresses before the end of the month.
In the past, the system now used in polite society, of allowing the poor
man to hook on his white Santa Claus beard and to pay for everything
worked fine, because milady used her allowance on clothing, which we
must admit is essential in this day and age. Eddie, Joe, or whoever it
might be, has managed to struggle through on his roommate's clothes (pro
vided the roommate wasn't using them) and spend the rest of his money
on Clara Lou.
But, advantages appear on every side for the new system. The poor
men will now be able to appear in public at one-half the expense which
will make it possible for everyone to have his own toothpaste and shaving
cream. On the other hand, if women will still go out as much, it will result
in the aforementioned home-product manicuring, etc. This practical
training will prove useful if the boys with rich papas decide to remain
bachelors, thereby causing Clara Lou to marry one of the struggling young
professional men who, with remarkable frequence, find themselves out in
the cruel world with nothing but a sheepskin, which won't even start a
fire, although it makes a nice patch for pants.
Probably the biggest argument for the new idea is that it will make
conversation 100 per cent easier. If the party of the first part and the
party of the second part have been out on a bang the night before, they can
have a wonderful time figuring up who spent the most and who cheated
the other. As any two men who have done this know, it takes an aston
ishing length of time to decide who owes the other for a party. And
when it is finally decided who paid the most, the pair won't be friends, and
then neither will have a date the next night and can catch up on lost sleep.
Verily, it's great stuff. â€”W. W. K.
