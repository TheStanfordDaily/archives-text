# Friendly Faculty
## 
### 
That the members of the present administration at Stanford are main
taining the traditional spirit of personal contact and friendliness with the
Board of Trustees was shown last night when 710 trustees and professors
met at an informal banquet in the Stanford Union. The spirit of coopera
tion and helpfulness which prevailed disproves the* statement common
about the campus that increasing rules and red tape have done much to
cause the old idea of personal contact to disappear.
When Stanford was founded, and when the student body and faculty
were both small, it was customary for undergraduates to be more or less
chummy with their professors. And, likewise, the trustees were in con
stant, close communication with the Academic Council. As the enrollment
increased, and with it the number of faculty members, the general cry was
that the unity of trustees, professors and students was no more, and that
rules and regulations laid down by the "higher ups" robbed the Stanford
group of its air of informality, and made relationships strained.
When the Board of Trustees and the faculty can get together in the
way in which they did last night, to discuss mutual problems so agreeably
and so informally, it is a certain indication that those who guide the policies
of the University are earnestly trying to carry out their work in an amic
able way, and one which will prove of ultimate satisfaction to the student.
The efforts being made to retain a closer relationship are very worth
while, because they are certain to smooth out petty difficulties. For this
the administrative group is to be congratulated. —W. W. K.

STUDENTS SHOULD NOT FAIL to hear Chester H. Rowell, who
will discuss "Newspaper Making and Newspaper Reading in a Republic"
at the University assembly tomorrow. Rowell is one of the most outstand
ing editors developed on the Pacific Coast, and brought the Fresno Repub
lican from nonenity into a position where its influence was felt throughout
the country. Because of his wide experience as an editor he is certain to
have a worth while message tomorrow.
Rowell retired from the Republican in 1920 and since that time has
been engaged in syndicating his point-of-view from his home in Berkeley,
lie is a meml>er of the Board of Regents of the University of California.
In a generation of great journals rather than great editors, Rowell's
position is all the more noteworthy. —W. VV. K.
