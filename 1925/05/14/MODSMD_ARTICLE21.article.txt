## ETIQUETTE 
### Steve O'Donnell 
James bought a book of etiquette
That seemed stuffed full of fact.
At dinner, dance, and hop and ball
It told him how to act.
Just how to bow and how to shake,
At midnight and at noon,
How also he should ask for dance,
And how to use a spoon.
"Just curl your finger round one end
And squeeze it with another.
If this you do they'll take you for
Lord Chesterfield's own brother."
James went in to a high class ball,
But there despite the text,
He said when asking for a dance,
"Say kid, yours is the next."
Though very shocked and sore sur
prised,
Our hero thought that soon
Ice cream would come and then he'd
shine
In using fo a spoon.
But when the eats were passed around
He gazed with great surprise
For on each plate he only saw
Ice Cold Eskeemo Pies.
James had a fit and said at home,
"No more at parties will I roam."
But ere he then this vow did utter,
He dropped that book deep down the
gutter. —J. p.
