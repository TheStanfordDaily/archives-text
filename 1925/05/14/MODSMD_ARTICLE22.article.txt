My, but I am honored,
As honored as can be.
I live upon the campus
Of this University.
I've talked to Dr. Jordan,
To Kellogg's house I go.
I've eaten with Will Irwin,
And Charlie Field I know.
I've gone by the Wilbur house
In spite of rain and fog.
The same applies to Terman's.
I've been bitten by Hoover's dog!
