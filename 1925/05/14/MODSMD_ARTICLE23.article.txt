# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT

### 
The Editor, Sir:
As an uninterested observer of the
Open Forum discussion on the ques
tion of dating expenses and the proba
bility of the ladies (God bless 'em)
paying one-half the holdup, we were
exceedingly amused. The arguments
were pert and quite to the point. More
than that they were clever, particularly
those of the charming supporters of
the plan.
One point arose that was neither
conclusive nor satisfactorily settled.
It was a point, moreover, that worried
one of the contestants, which fact is
in itself worthy of consideration. To be
specific, the question of a possible
motive as to why the discussion was
ever called; and then ny such an au
gust body as the Euphronia Debating
Society.
We would be so bold as to suggest
a possible motive —this at the risk of
never having another date on this
jolly campus; which may or may not
turn out to be the proverbial blessing
in disguise. In the first place we sug
gest that the fair ladies so bribed,
cajoled, or bullied the honorable presi
dent that he had no alternative left
but to call the meeting.
Then we suggest that the final mo
tive behind the gracious ladies was
that it might, by dangling additional
lucre before the eyes of the eligibles,
make it easier for them (the ladies)
to procure or otherwise snatch a hus
band. Otherwise how could one ac
count for such a silly idea?
—"Anxious."

The honor system at Union College,
Schenectady, was recently suspended
for the rest of the school year.
