# SENIOR CLASS PLANS SPANISH PROMENADE
## 
### 
Moonlight falling on vivid senoritas
and gallant dons, guitars, and the click
of castanets â€”all these and more will
be featured in the Senior Promenade j
which will take place in little less
than a month.
No definite date has yet been set
and no details have been given out,
but it is expected that the class of '25
will put on a Promenade which will
rival those of early days when the
event was a notable one 011 the penin
sula and spectators came from miles
around.
Martin D'Andrea heads the decora
tions and music committee, and he has
as assistants R. L. Rothschild, C. R.
Walling, and r>. C. McKay.
Students at the University of Spo
kane who took part in a sneak day on
April first will suffer a deduction
from final grades of six per cent for
old students and three per cent for
new students, in addition to two un
excused absences.
