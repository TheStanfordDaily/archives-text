# FRENCH CLUB WILL GIVE TWO BENEFIT PLAYS TOMORROW
## 
### 
"La Comedie de Celui qui Epousa
line Femme Muette," by Anatole
France, and "Petite Pluie," by Edouard
Pailleron, will be presented by mem
bers of the Cercle Francais at 8
o'clock tomorrow evening in the Little
Theatre.
The money obtained from these pro
ductions is devoted exclusively to the
support of two French children, made
orphans during the war, who hereto
fore have been provided for through
the activities of the Stanford French
Club.
"Petite Pluie" has a touch of the
old-fashioned melodrama about it that
gives it a unique place in the history
of French Club productions. Rs stage
effects include wind, rain, thunder,
lightning, while the carrying off of
beautiful women and a police pursuit
will add thrills to the plot.
The other play, by Anatole France,
is chiefly remarkable for the fine hu
mor of its lines, and is rather rough

and ready medieval atmosphere.
Tickets for the productions are on
sale for $1 at the Stanford Bookstore.
