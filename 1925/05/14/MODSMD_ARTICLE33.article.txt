# HISTORY OF QUADS SHOWS PERIODS OF ANNUAL'S PROGRESS
## Athletics Take Back Seat in Early Issues; Poems and Stories Featured 
### Herbert Klein 
The 1926 Quad, to come out In June,
has a long and interesting ancestry
extending back to volume number one
►in 1895. A review of the annuals pub
lished since that time shows that many
of the features now thought essential
to every yearbook are of comparative
ly recent origin.
The 1895 Quad had a surprising
number of pictures of all sorts. The J
sequence of sections and the amount |
of space devoted to each is significant
in showing what was considered im
portant at that time. Faculty history,
classes, poems, and literary efforts of
various sorts received the greatest
amount of space. Athletics brought up
at the rear, being preceded even by
write-ups of lecturers and preachers, j
The section openers closely resembled
valentines and had little or no relation
to college life.
The next book, in 1896, had correc
tions and additions pasted on a small
sheet of paper on the title page. All
the first three books held a "Rah, Rah.
Rah! Rah, Rah, Rah, Rah, Rah, Stan
ford!" on the first page.
Not until 1901 was a table of con
tents and pictures of sorority houses
introduced. At that time is was not
considered quite modest for young
ladies' pictures to appear in such a
fashion.. The 1902 Quad pioneered with
action pictures of athletics and also
had the first index. The following year
color plates of the Memorial Church
appeared and an elaborate plan of sec
tion openers. Things became pretty
well systematized in the '04 produc
tion with complete pictures of class
presidents, fraternity, and sorority
houses, and a logical arrangement.
This book started a new size of Quads
with 375 pages.
The now indispensible Razz Section
I made its bow in 1906. '
With everything in readiness for;
starting production in 1907, the earth
quake destroyed every vestige of the
book, but the staff did some record
breaking work and in three weeks
gathered material for a 235-page book.
Athletics were moved up to their"!
present high place of honor in 1915. i
A new size of Quad was started in
1925 with a book notable for elaborate i
decorations. During all these years an
almost uninterrupted improvement!
took place in photography, ararnge
ment, and art work of all sorts.
With such a background the editors ;
of the 1926 Quad have worked to pro-;
duce a book which will represent the I
climax of the evolution in quality and
one which will possess everything that j
goes to make a complete book.

►in 1895. A review of the annuals pub
lished since that time shows that many
of the features now thought essential
to every yearbook are of comparative
ly recent origin.
The 1895 Quad had a surprising
number of pictures of all sorts. The J
sequence of sections and the amount |
of space devoted to each is significant
in showing what was considered im
portant at that time. Faculty history,
classes, poems, and literary efforts of
various sorts received the greatest
amount of space. Athletics brought up
at the rear, being preceded even by
write-ups of lecturers and preachers, j
The section openers closely resembled
valentines and had little or no relation
to college life.
The next book, in 1896, had correc
tions and additions pasted on a small
sheet of paper on the title page. All
the first three books held a "Rah, Rah.
Rah! Rah, Rah, Rah, Rah, Rah, Stan
ford!" on the first page.
Not until 1901 was a table of con
tents and pictures of sorority houses
introduced. At that time is was not
considered quite modest for young
ladies' pictures to appear in such a
fashion.. The 1902 Quad pioneered with
action pictures of athletics and also
had the first index. The following year
color plates of the Memorial Church
appeared and an elaborate plan of sec
tion openers. Things became pretty
well systematized in the '04 produc
tion with complete pictures of class
presidents, fraternity, and sorority
houses, and a logical arrangement.
This book started a new size of Quads
with 375 pages.

With everything in readiness for;
starting production in 1907, the earth
quake destroyed every vestige of the
book, but the staff did some record
breaking work and in three weeks
gathered material for a 235-page book.
Athletics were moved up to their"!
present high place of honor in 1915. i
A new size of Quad was started in
1925 with a book notable for elaborate i
decorations. During all these years an
almost uninterrupted improvement!
took place in photography, ararnge
ment, and art work of all sorts.
With such a background the editors ;
of the 1926 Quad have worked to pro-;
duce a book which will represent the I
climax of the evolution in quality and
one which will possess everything that j
goes to make a complete book.
