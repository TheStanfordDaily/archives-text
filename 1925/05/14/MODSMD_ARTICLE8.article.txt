# WOMEN WIN FORUM ON QUESTION OF DATE EXPENSE
## Feminine Debating Team Wins Audience Decision From Euphronia 
### 
Upholding the assertion that the
"fifty-fifty" proposition is practical and
applicable, the Women's Debating So
ciety won the debate last night with
Euphronia by an audience decision.
Hulda Hoover, first speaker for the
affirmative, stressed the point that
the "fifty-fifty" proposition was not
necessarily synonymous with "dutch"
treating.
The first speaker for the negative,
R. C. Stroup, made a short speech
showing the man's side of the ques
tion and pointing out the obvious dif
ficulties that would ensue.
Marietta Fry, speaking for the Wo
men's Debating Society, said that there
was no longer the need for the custom
as it now stands and that it had been
originated at a time when a woman
was economically dependent on men
for her recreation.
T. F. Baer concluded the debate and
defended the present custom.
After the debate the meeting was
thrown open for discussion and ques
tions were asked the original speak
ers. At the conclusion of the argument
a vote was taken and the meeting was
adjourned by the President of Euphro
nia, W. L. Gosslin, who presided at j
the forum.
