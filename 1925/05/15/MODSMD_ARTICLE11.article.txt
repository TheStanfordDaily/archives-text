UII7HAT the people in America need is leadership, for a democracy without
leadership is worse than an autocracy —it is nothing but a mob. 1 lie
organ to furnish this leadership is the American newspaper," declared Chester
H. Rowell in his address before the University assembly this morning on the
i subject of "Newspaper Making and Newspaper Reading in a Republic,' which
| was the opening event of the second convention of the California State Inter
scholastic Press Association, which is being held at Stanford today and tomor
; row and which is being attended by approximately 250 high school editors
and newspaper managers.
President Wilbur presided at the assembly. C. E. Beardsley, student body
i president, welcomed the high school journalists to the Stanford campus.
In reviewing the development of the American newspaper, Rowell empha-
I sized the improvement in the editorials, the news writing, and the advertising
|in the papers today. Many things have become news which were formerly
i entirely disregarded. Scientific news has become very popular. Through a
-I\ i: „„ * „ 1 "Cnjantifirt Corvipo "

called Scientific Service,
started a few years ago by C. H.
Rowell and President Wilbur, better
standards of scientific articles are ob
| tained. Great interest lias been shown
j in archaeology and paleontology, and
the most popular of scientific news is
astronomical. This indicates the ideal
ism of the American people—they are
more interested in anything that hap
pens beyond the boundaries of the uni
verse than anything else.
Rowell stressed the great responsi
bility which a newspaper has as a
unifying organ. The newspaper and
the public schools together unify Amer
ica more than any other one thing, and
| this uniformity is one of the striking
things about the American nation.
People throughout the continent have
the same standards, the same man
ners, speak the same language, and
read the same news.
The greatest responsibility of the
American newspaper is as an educator
of the people. In closing, Rowell ad
vised the amateur journalists if they
entered the profession not to lose the
idealism of it, nor the practicability,
and to try to feel the great responsi
j bility that belongs to the journalistic
| profession.
