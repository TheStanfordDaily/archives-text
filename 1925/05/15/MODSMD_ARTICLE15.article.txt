# PLAY WITH JUNIOR OPERA STARS GIVEN IN LITTLE THEATRE
## 
### Isabel Schanck 
With Velma Randall as the young j
wife, and F. A. Barrett playing the j
part of the husband, Christopher Mor- j
ley's "Thursday Evening," a one-act i
comedy of married life, was presented ,
last night in the Little Theatre by j
Miss Buckingham's drama class.
"The Little Stone House," a heavier j
and more difficult play, was less fin-:
ished, and dragged a little, in spite i
of the good interpretations which j
Grace Reade and Guy Holliday gave
to their parts.
"Thursday Evening," the maid's!
night off, when both mother-in-laws j
rlrop in to dinner, is a situation to give
any young couple a good excuse for a
quarrel.
Katholeen Hillis and Kathryn Peck
in the parts of the mother-in-laws, con
trary to precedent, are a sensible pair,
who show wit and humor in their atti
tude toward their children.
Long Russian names, and the rather
obvious didacticism of ,4 The Little
Stone House" inhibited its success.
Grace Reade, in the part of the mother
who is devoted to the ideal of her
dead son, had a difficult part which
she did well.
Guy Holliday, as the son who re
turns from Siberia after twenty years,
was good; his interpretation of a
starving man who gets food was espe
cially realistic.
The minor parts were taken by Mar
jorie Allen, T. E. Drake, J. V. Mans
field, and J. W. Shoup. D. H. Alden
spoiled a rather good part by not
knowing his lines.
These two plays are the first of a
series of one-act plays to be presented
this quarter* by Miss Buckingham's
drama class.
