# STANFORD RUNNERS HOLD BETURN MEET WITH OLYMPIC CLUB
## CLOSE RACES PREDICTED S. G. Hartranft Will Make Assault on World's Mark in Shot 
### Douglas Meservey 
Stanford meets the Olympic Club
tracksters in the stadium tomorrow at
2:30 p.m. for a return meet between
the two teams. The first meeting of
the squads on March 14 resulted in
a 82 to 49 win for the Cardinals.
Of the individual appearances, that
of Captain S. G. Hartranft will be
watched the closest for he will make
one of his last attempts to set a
world's record. Two weeks ago he suc
ceeded in a similar trial and estab
lished a new mark of 157 feet 1 5-8
inches in the discus, breaking former
record set by Clarence Houser of U.
S. C. a month ago.
Hartranft is hoping to set his name
after another in the record books —a
new mark in the shot put. The present
distance is 51 feet which was estab
lished by the giant farmer boy, Ralph
Rose, who competed under the Olym
pic Club colors in 1909.
Has Neared Record
Once Hartranft has neared the rec
ord, having tossed the shot 50 feet
11 1-2 inches in the U. S. C. meet in
Los Angeles last year. But he beat
the mark by putting the pellet out
52 feet 1 inch in practice and on a
fair throw last week.
The Stanford captain has spent more
time on this weight event than on
the discus recently. The question is,
therefore, whether specialization on it
will enable him to put it out for a
world's record tomorrow.
Another even battle should be on
the track with the renewal of the
Miller-Cochran rivalry in the' quarter
mile run. Cochran, a runner older in
experience, had the edge on the Card
sprinter last year, but gradual im
provement enabled the latter to clip
off :49 in the first Olympic Club meet
March 14 and beat Cochran by yards.
Miller May Equal Record
Miller is still in good condition, de
spite the steady practice he has had
for months, and on a good hard track
may equal his coast mark of :48 3-5.
The sprints should see a fight be
tween two diminutive runners —Gas-
par of Stanford and O'Brien of the
Club. Gaspar is capable of 0:10 1-5 in
the century, while O'Brien, a new ad
dition to Coach Hunter's ranks, has
won several dashes in :10 2-5. It is
doubtful if either Hartranft or Camp
bell will enter.
Richardson of Stanford will be run
ning against Macintosh, formerly
under Templeton but now running for
the clubmen, for the first time in real
competition. He beat him out by one
place in two meets last year—the Big
Meet, in which they finished one-two,
and the I. C. A. A. A. A. in which
Richardson took third and Macintosh
fourth. Both are capable of 1:56 for
the two laps.
