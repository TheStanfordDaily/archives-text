# Hello!

### 
Stanford is host today and tomorrow to delegates from high schools
all over the state who have come for the second annual convention of the
California Inter scholastic Press Association.
School and college journalism has advanced in a marked degree in the
past few years, and it is a privilege for Stanford to be able to entertain
this group of writers and managers of high school publications. Benefits
will be obtained by both parties, for the high school editors and business
managers of today will be the leaders in college journalistic circles of the
future.
The Daily Palo Alto, as a representative journalistic organ at Stan
ford, extends to the delegates a hearty welcome, with a hope that their
stay here will be not only pleasurable but also instructive. â€”C. C. S.
