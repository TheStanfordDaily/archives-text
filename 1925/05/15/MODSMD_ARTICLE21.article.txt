# Party Politics
## 
### 
What appears to be a respectable effort at organizing a permanent and
responsible political party has been made. Of all the things which might
be started on the campus, this party is perhaps as constructive as any
could be.
With the purpose announced as encouraging efficiency in student ad
ministration, this body has drawn away from living-group cleavage. A
strong support from all parts of the campus has been gathered. It re
mains to be seen whether the die-hards of the Hall-Row factions will hang
on as divided opposition or whether a second party will be established.
Any sort of permanent organization is better than the informal political
free-for-all that has characterized past elections. With permanence comes
responsibility. Should the new party gain control at the coming elections
and govern poorly next year, it will probably go out of office. Should it
govern well, it deserves to retain the confidence of the students.
But since this group does more than that, since it disregards the fatuous
factions of living-groups, the movement is all the more to be commended.
Under a universal party the unpleasantness of social distrusts will be elimi
nated from politics.
There is bound to be an opposition formed to combat this organization.
It is not only inevitable, but highly desirable, for there can be no success
ful opposition formed that doesn't combine Hall and Row forces.
Whichever party carries the field at the coming election, the victory
will mark the end of the old order of nonsense.
TWO EXPENSIVE CHINESE DRAPERIES which were bor
rowed by the Junior Prom Committee as decorations for the recent dance,
have disappeared. The hangings together with two others, were discov- I
ered to be missing the morning following the party. It is reported that of
the four, two were returned shortly after they were taken.
These decorations are valued at more than $100. The theft of articles
of such value is scarcely to be considered a "college prank."
Whatever the intent, however, it is necessary that the prom committee
regain possession of their borrowed drapes. It has been promised that no
action will be taken against the offenders in case the hangings are returned.
Any information leading to the recovery of these decorations will be
greatly appreciated and no questions will be asked.
It seems that the only decent thing for the rough who plundered the
prom to do is to consider the position of the committee and to return the
draperies.
