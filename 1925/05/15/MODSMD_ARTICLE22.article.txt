The Editor, Sir:
The humorous, rather than the real
ly fundamental aspects, of the 50-50
dating proposition were discussed in
the open forum of the Wednesday eve
ning debate.
May I suggest that traditions are
often based upon economic laws? In
the past, men have always paid wo
men's dating expenses. Why? Because
men were the wage-earners, and wo
men were economically dependent
upon them, both before and after mar
riage. Hut the situation has changed
Bomewhat, for now a far larger pro
portion of women are self-supporting.
Obviously, the tradition of woman's
dependence upon man must tend to
break down when its financial basis is
removed. The process is a gradual one,
but it seems inevitable in view of the
present development of society.
Romantic prejudices against such an
Innovation seems very real to us, but
we should remember that they were
built up around a social institution
which is fast disappearing, and that
they do not apply to the new situation
of feminine independence. It is basic
ally a question, not of sentiment, but
of economic effect. —G. H.
