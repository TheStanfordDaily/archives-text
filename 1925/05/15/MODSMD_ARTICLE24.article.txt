Archimedes: Eureka!
Echo: Well, keep it, you big stiff!

Our sympathy is with the freshman
who was worried because he didn't
get a bid from Phi Beta Kappa.

MODERN VERSIONS
Curly Locks, Curly Locks,
Wilt you be mine?
You'll not have to keep house.
Instead, all the time
You'll sit on a cushion,
A jazz record play,
And chew at your chewing gum
All through the day. —J. P.

(Stanford University, 1955) —Formal
Rushing began at twelve o'clock, noon,
today. A blast- of the power house
whistle announced open season.
The chosen freshmen, heavily
masked, were marched from Encina
under heavy armed guard. Upon arri
val at the postoffice, a chaperone was
detailed to go with each freshman
(two for freshmen from Long Beach),
then the journey up the row began.
When the freshmen reached the
houses to which they had been in
vited, they were lined up on the lawn.
Fraternity men were not allowed to
leave their houses, but they were per
mitted to open their windows and look
at the freshmen as the first year men
removed their masks. After ten min
utes of intensive gazing it was thought
that the row men had become suffi
ciently acquainted with the rushees,
and the trip back to Encina was begun.
Formal pledging will be held tomor
row. It is rumored that Rip McHorse,
president of the Interfraternity Coun
cil, has a scheme to prevent the un
necessary gazing by arranging for
brief phone calls as the media of be
coming acquainted with the new men.

At that, we are in favor of a closed
season on freshmen. Say what one
may to the contrary, they deserve as
much consideration as fish.
