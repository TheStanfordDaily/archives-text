# ABOUT BOOKS
## "THE CREATIVE SPIRIT" 
###

At the outset let it be known that the
task of reviewing this book was ap
proached with no small amount of trepi
dation. We've seen titles like this before
and after a hurried reading wished that
said books had been consigned to limbo
at some time prior to birth. But now it
must be admitted that the title has noth
ing to do with the book—well, very little
at any rate. Mr. Brown has given us a
good one (book, not title), a fine criti
cism of American life with a goodly
dash of constructive thinking.
The thesis is that there is a something
in all of us, a very intangible and un
definable something, which, if given the
proper proving ground, will flower, blos
som into a beautiful thing-a-majig, as it
were. We are given to understand that
one of the many reasons why this
metamorphosis refuses to function—in
fact, the most important reason, is that
our institutions exercise a leveling in
fluence that partakes of standardization.
The book divides itself into two sections,
to the last of which is devoted the major
portion. The first is the creative spirit
in relation to conduct; the second, the
ways in which institutions relate them
selves to a normal expression of the
creative spirit.
The institutions are as follows: the
I church, education, the industrial scheme,
science, art, and the American public.
Mr. Brown's criticisms are particularly
pregnant in the fields of education and
art. In education, the young professor
is cited as an example—or rather a re
sult—of our system. Education as prac
ticed in America, is a whooping success
as a stifler of any sort of progress. Stu
dents "have the drove habit forced upon
them by the official college—they are
made to adopt the tone of their own arti
ficial world —and any chance eargerness
that may remain is constantly discour
aged and often misrepresented by their
elders." As a suggestion is offered the
Oxford system of colleges—no new sug
gestion it must be admitted—but one
which has not lost its effectiveness.
There are two things wrong with
American art; the cult of degradation
and what is referred to as the museum
habit. The paragraph referring to the
first fault begins like this: "Now a
man's desire to explore a sewer may be
greatly to his credit." The rest is equally
enlightening. The quarrel with the
museum habit is well taken and excel
lently propounded.
"The Creative Spirit" may be recom
mended to one who wants to think. The
style—which must always be mentioned
in any well-behaved review—is almost
too easy to read. As we said at the be
ginning, don't be misled by the title.

I church, education, the industrial scheme,
science, art, and the American public.
Mr. Brown's criticisms are particularly
pregnant in the fields of education and
art. In education, the young professor
is cited as an example—or rather a re
sult—of our system. Education as prac
ticed in America, is a whooping success
as a stifler of any sort of progress. Stu
dents "have the drove habit forced upon
them by the official college—they are
made to adopt the tone of their own arti
ficial world —and any chance eargerness
that may remain is constantly discour
aged and often misrepresented by their
elders." As a suggestion is offered the
Oxford system of colleges—no new sug
gestion it must be admitted—but one
which has not lost its effectiveness.
There are two things wrong with
American art; the cult of degradation
and what is referred to as the museum
habit. The paragraph referring to the
first fault begins like this: "Now a
man's desire to explore a sewer may be
greatly to his credit." The rest is equally
enlightening. The quarrel with the
museum habit is well taken and excel
lently propounded.
"The Creative Spirit" may be recom
mended to one who wants to think. The
style—which must always be mentioned
in any well-behaved review—is almost
too easy to read. As we said at the be
ginning, don't be misled by the title.

At the outset let it be known that the
task of reviewing this book was ap
proached with no small amount of trepi
dation. We've seen titles like this before
and after a hurried reading wished that
said books had been consigned to limbo
at some time prior to birth. But now it
must be admitted that the title has noth
ing to do with the book—well, very little
at any rate. Mr. Brown has given us a
good one (book, not title), a fine criti
cism of American life with a goodly
dash of constructive thinking.
The thesis is that there is a something
in all of us, a very intangible and un
definable something, which, if given the
proper proving ground, will flower, blos
som into a beautiful thing-a-majig, as it
were. We are given to understand that
one of the many reasons why this
metamorphosis refuses to function—in
fact, the most important reason, is that
our institutions exercise a leveling in
fluence that partakes of standardization.
The book divides itself into two sections,
to the last of which is devoted the major
portion. The first is the creative spirit
in relation to conduct; the second, the
ways in which institutions relate them
selves to a normal expression of the
creative spirit.
The institutions are as follows: the
I church, education, the industrial scheme,
science, art, and the American public.
