# SPORTS OF 1925
## It's Marathon Time 
### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
When Pheidippides ran the 26 miles and 285 yards to Athens after fighting
in the baule of Marathon, and fell dead as he cried out to his fellow citizens
that the Greeks had been victorious over the invading Persians, he started
something—more than he ever dreamed of.
For years the Marathon race has been the feature of the Olympic games.
The names of Loues the Greek, Teato of France, Slierring of Canada, Hayes
of America, McArthur of South Africa, and that wonderful Finn, Kolehmainen,
will always live in athletic history because they won the Olympic Marathon
race.
But Pheidippides started more than that —in Boston they have an annual

Marathon, too, and the staid New Englanders make quite a fuss over it. This
event, which is the American classic of these strange, romantic races, is held
on Patriot's Day, April 19th, Last year Clarence De Mar won it for the fifth
time, and in doing so set a new world's marathon record of 2 hours, 29 min
utes, and 40 1-5 seconds.
At the Olympic games last year in Paris, Albin Oscar Steenroos, of Finland,
won the marathon race, with De Mar third. These two athletes —Steenroos
and De Mar —are alike in many ways. Both are 37 years old. Both started
running nearly twenty years ago, and both gave up the marathon for years
after their first attempts. Each ran in the 1912 Olympics, and then not again
internationally until 1924. Steenroos sells sewing machines, and De Mar is
a printer. Both are deeply religious, and each one believes in giving up the
many pleasures of life to build up stamina by continuous training.
