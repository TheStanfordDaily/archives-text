# CADINALS LOOM AS STRONG CONTENDERS FOR 1925 GRID TITLE
## Coach Warner Ends Six-Week Spring Practice Period This Afternoon 
### W. F. Adams 
With the six weeks' spring football
practice period coining to a close this
afternoon with a practice game in the
stadium, Stanford looms as a strong
contender for the 1925 Pacific Coast
Conference grid title. There are a num
ber of good men fighting for each posi
tion, and from all indications scarcely
a man on the squad will be absolutely
sure of a position next fall.
In the line but two regulars will be
back—Swan at guard, and Shipkey at
end. Baker, Neill, H. H. Shipkey,
Johnston, and Lawson have graduated,
but to take their places are last season's
substitutes, transfers, and members of
the 1928 freshman eleven.
Van Hook and Natcher are making
the strongest bid for the center job that
was left vacant by Baker. Both of these
men have had experience as substitutes
on the squad, which should make them
valuable this season. Along with these
two centers there are McCrery, Mus
tain, and Haight to be considered. Mc-
Crcery has played regular for the
Olympic Club for the last two seasons,
while Mustain and Haight helped to beat
the California Bears in the freshman
contest this year.
Hunt Going Good
Hunt, who is the heaviest man on the
field, and who has been a substitute in
the Big Game for the last two years,
will most probably be Swan's running
mate at guard. The two Post brothers
will also be fighting for the guard jobs.
The younger Post played for Hunt's
freshmen this year, while the older of
the two was a member of the 1927 team.
At tackle Stanford has lost Johnston
and Shipkey, who have played regularly
during the last three seasons. Everett
of the 1928 class and Raffeto, a sopho
more, are putting in strong bids for
these vacancies. Both of these boys are
over six feet tall, and weigh in at 200
pounds, but they lack varsity experience.
Simmons, a transfer from U. S. C., is
another prospect for track, along with
Robesky, captain of the 1928 squad, and
Poulson, last season's first string sub
stitute. Simmons is not in college this
quarter, but he will be registered next
fall.
Several Ends Out
T. E. Shipkey, regular 1924 end, is
back, and along with him there are two
other experienced players — Middleton
and Greisser. Dennis, Vincenti, and
Davidson of the freshman class are also
showing up strong. Price has been
switched from center to end, and Moore
has been taken out of the backfield for
a trial at the end position. Tf Middle
ton is not troubled with his injured
shoulder he should make the strongest
bid for the place. Davidson has every
qualification for an end. He is big and
fast, but he lacks experience. Last sea
son was Davidson's first trial at football I
and he broke his leg in practice, which ,
put him out of the California game.
In the backfield Solomon and Mitchell,
regular quarterbacks of 1924, and Nev
crs, fullback, are eligible for another
year. Walker, who held down halfback
last season, has been working out at
quarterback. Murphy, 1928 signal caller,
will give the varsity quarterbacks some
thing to think about.
New Fullbacks Found
As substitutes for Captain Nevers are
Young and Millage from the freshman
class. Millage was one of the most con
sistent line buckers on the 1928 team.
Young lias not played football since his
high school days in Salt Lake City,
where he was rated as the best fullback
in that section of the country.
Halfbacks are Coach Warner's main J
worry, but with Bogue, Hill, Hyland,
Trombetta, Wright, and Garthwaite to
work with, two good backs should be de
veloped. Bogue was substitute fullback
last year, but his speed has made him
eligible for a halfback position. Hill
is the only 1928 halfback that is showing
tip well in spring practice. Trombetta,
Garthwaite, and Wright substituted in
the 1924 varsity. With one year of ex
jperience they should prove vauable.
