# POSITION DROPS OUT OF SKY FOR SWAYNE ON SOUTHERN TRIP
## 
### 
Opportunity more than knocked at
the door of W. W. Swayne, '24/ on his
trip to Los Angeles last week made
for the purpose of finding a position.
As he was nearing Los Angeles he
noticed an abandoned airplane by the
wayside and a little farther along
came upon two unfortunate aviators
tramping in the direction of the city.
He gave them a lift the rest of the
way in.
They turned out to be none other
than Reginald Denny and his mechanic
who had been aloft in Denny's air
plane but were forced down by engine
trouble. Before the city was reached
Denny had offered Swayne an excel
lent position in his studio and had
been accepted. Swayne's opportunity
had literally fallen from the sky.
While attending Stanford Swayne
was a varsity 880 runner.
