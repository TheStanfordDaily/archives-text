# BEARS AND TROJANS WILL HAVE HARD GOING IN I. C. 4-A.
## 
### D. T. Ross 
California and U. S. C. will have
hard going in the I. C. A. A. A. A. meet
to be held at Franklin Field, Univer
sity of Pennsylvania, the last of the
month, but may amass enough points
to bring the title to the West.
Both teams have strong dual meet
combinations with a number of possi
ble point winners in each event, but
they lack a sufficiency of stars to win
the twenty-five or thirty points neces
sary to win the big eastern meet. In
some cases the two western teams will
probably cut each other's throats by
having good men in the same event.
On the other hand, either of them
may catch the Easterners off their
guard and bring back the title to the
coast. California has Barber, Boyden,
Bondshu, Gerkin, the Dodson brothers.
Hampton, Stevens, Schwobeda, Upson,
Hill, Garner, and Becker to gather in
counters. U. S. C. will not have as
many strong contenders, but Houser is
almost certain to get ten points for
the southern school. House, Dye, Niers
back, may all score, but unless some
of the other star performers become ,
eligible, U. S. C. will not have enough
men to lengthen its point column suf
ficiently.
Houser Favorite
With the exception of Houser, nei
ther university has a man who can be
counted on for a first place. Barber,
California dash man, will run up j
against Hill and Norton, both mem- i
hers of last year's Olympic team, and I
several other crack sprinters. He will
be doing well to get a third in either j
event.
Boyden, who made startling time in j
the Big Meet, also will run up against!
some of the best lialf-milers in thej
country. Georgetown has four men !
who at the Penn Relays lowered the !
former world's two-mile relay mark !
by 5 3-5 seconds to 7 min. 42 sec. !
Three of these, Holden, Sullivan, and j
Marsters, covered the distance under !
1 min. 55 sec., with the latter doing it j
from a running start in 1 min. 53 sec. [
the day before.
In the hurdles. Dye, U. S. C., has an ;
excellent chance to take a first, though j
Moore, Penn State, will probably have j
a slight edge. Becker will not have as ;
good an opportunity to get points as
two years ago, when he was able to
place third.
In the field events, outside of Hou
ser, the West will not be able to make
as much a clean up as two years ago,
when California won the title. Gerkin
should not get better than third in
the shot, as Hills, Princeton, will push
Houser all the way. The discus will
prove better, as the Penn Relay marks
were below 140 feet. But in the javelin
the East has developed some notable
performers, headed by Bench who, in
early season, has already thrown the
spear 18G feet. The Dodsons, however,
should have little difficulty in placing.
California may possibly get a few
points in the pole vault and high jump,
but the field will be very excellent in
these events. The West will lose out
in the hammer, which is not used on
the coast.

The two-mile will give the Bears an- j
other chance to do some heavy scoring j
when Stevens and Schwobeda are pit- j
ted against Smith of Yale, intercolle-j
giate cross-country champion, and Tib
betts, of Harvard.
From his performances this year,
Martz, U. S. C., should not be able to
place in the quarter, while chances
are slim for the West in the mile.
Bondshu Will Be Pressed
In the broad jump Bondshu will have
a hard time placing, as the field will
be strong. Comins, last year's winner, I
can jump well over 24 feet and should ,
repeat this spring if he is in right j
form.
In the East, Pensylvania, George
town, Yale, and Princeton will prob- j
ably present the strongest teams. Penn '
has several exceptionally strong per
formers, while Yale has lost few of
its squad which won the title last
year. Georgetown has good men for
the track events and Norton and
Plansky, who may be able to score
in the field.
California and U. S. C. will enter
under the disadvantage of competing
in foreign territory, which will work
against them. But either will give the
best Eastern teams a close battle
under any conditions.

form.
In the East, Pensylvania, George
town, Yale, and Princeton will prob- j
ably present the strongest teams. Penn '
has several exceptionally strong per
formers, while Yale has lost few of
its squad which won the title last
year. Georgetown has good men for
the track events and Norton and
Plansky, who may be able to score
in the field.
California and U. S. C. will enter
under the disadvantage of competing
in foreign territory, which will work
against them. But either will give the
best Eastern teams a close battle
under any conditions.
California and U. S. C. will have
hard going in the I. C. A. A. A. A. meet
to be held at Franklin Field, Univer
sity of Pennsylvania, the last of the
month, but may amass enough points
to bring the title to the West.
Both teams have strong dual meet
combinations with a number of possi
ble point winners in each event, but
they lack a sufficiency of stars to win
the twenty-five or thirty points neces
sary to win the big eastern meet. In
some cases the two western teams will
probably cut each other's throats by
having good men in the same event.
On the other hand, either of them
may catch the Easterners off their
guard and bring back the title to the
coast. California has Barber, Boyden,
Bondshu, Gerkin, the Dodson brothers.
Hampton, Stevens, Schwobeda, Upson,
Hill, Garner, and Becker to gather in
counters. U. S. C. will not have as
many strong contenders, but Houser is
almost certain to get ten points for
the southern school. House, Dye, Niers
back, may all score, but unless some
of the other star performers become ,
eligible, U. S. C. will not have enough
men to lengthen its point column suf
ficiently.
Houser Favorite
With the exception of Houser, nei
ther university has a man who can be
counted on for a first place. Barber,
California dash man, will run up j
against Hill and Norton, both mem- i
hers of last year's Olympic team, and I
several other crack sprinters. He will
be doing well to get a third in either j
event.
Boyden, who made startling time in j
the Big Meet, also will run up against!
some of the best lialf-milers in thej
country. Georgetown has four men !
who at the Penn Relays lowered the !
former world's two-mile relay mark !
by 5 3-5 seconds to 7 min. 42 sec. !
Three of these, Holden, Sullivan, and j
Marsters, covered the distance under !
1 min. 55 sec., with the latter doing it j
from a running start in 1 min. 53 sec. [
the day before.
In the hurdles. Dye, U. S. C., has an ;
excellent chance to take a first, though j
Moore, Penn State, will probably have j
a slight edge. Becker will not have as ;
good an opportunity to get points as
two years ago, when he was able to
place third.
In the field events, outside of Hou
ser, the West will not be able to make
as much a clean up as two years ago,
when California won the title. Gerkin
should not get better than third in
the shot, as Hills, Princeton, will push
Houser all the way. The discus will
prove better, as the Penn Relay marks
were below 140 feet. But in the javelin
the East has developed some notable
performers, headed by Bench who, in
early season, has already thrown the
spear 18G feet. The Dodsons, however,
should have little difficulty in placing.
California may possibly get a few
points in the pole vault and high jump,
but the field will be very excellent in
these events. The West will lose out
in the hammer, which is not used on
the coast.

The two-mile will give the Bears an- j
other chance to do some heavy scoring j
when Stevens and Schwobeda are pit- j
ted against Smith of Yale, intercolle-j
giate cross-country champion, and Tib
betts, of Harvard.
From his performances this year,
Martz, U. S. C., should not be able to
place in the quarter, while chances
are slim for the West in the mile.
Bondshu Will Be Pressed
In the broad jump Bondshu will have
a hard time placing, as the field will
be strong. Comins, last year's winner, I
can jump well over 24 feet and should ,

ted against Smith of Yale, intercolle-j
giate cross-country champion, and Tib
betts, of Harvard.
From his performances this year,
Martz, U. S. C., should not be able to
place in the quarter, while chances
are slim for the West in the mile.
Bondshu Will Be Pressed
In the broad jump Bondshu will have
a hard time placing, as the field will
be strong. Comins, last year's winner, I
can jump well over 24 feet and should ,
repeat this spring if he is in right j
form.
In the East, Pensylvania, George
town, Yale, and Princeton will prob- j
ably present the strongest teams. Penn '
has several exceptionally strong per
formers, while Yale has lost few of
its squad which won the title last
year. Georgetown has good men for
the track events and Norton and
Plansky, who may be able to score
in the field.
California and U. S. C. will enter
under the disadvantage of competing
in foreign territory, which will work
against them. But either will give the
best Eastern teams a close battle
under any conditions.
California and U. S. C. will have
hard going in the I. C. A. A. A. A. meet
to be held at Franklin Field, Univer
sity of Pennsylvania, the last of the
month, but may amass enough points
to bring the title to the West.
Both teams have strong dual meet
combinations with a number of possi
ble point winners in each event, but
they lack a sufficiency of stars to win
the twenty-five or thirty points neces
sary to win the big eastern meet. In
some cases the two western teams will
probably cut each other's throats by
having good men in the same event.
On the other hand, either of them
may catch the Easterners off their
guard and bring back the title to the
coast. California has Barber, Boyden,
Bondshu, Gerkin, the Dodson brothers.
Hampton, Stevens, Schwobeda, Upson,
Hill, Garner, and Becker to gather in
counters. U. S. C. will not have as
many strong contenders, but Houser is
almost certain to get ten points for
the southern school. House, Dye, Niers
back, may all score, but unless some
of the other star performers become ,
eligible, U. S. C. will not have enough
men to lengthen its point column suf
ficiently.
Houser Favorite
With the exception of Houser, nei
ther university has a man who can be
counted on for a first place. Barber,
California dash man, will run up j
against Hill and Norton, both mem- i
hers of last year's Olympic team, and I
several other crack sprinters. He will
be doing well to get a third in either j
event.
Boyden, who made startling time in j
the Big Meet, also will run up against!
some of the best lialf-milers in thej
country. Georgetown has four men !
who at the Penn Relays lowered the !
former world's two-mile relay mark !
by 5 3-5 seconds to 7 min. 42 sec. !
Three of these, Holden, Sullivan, and j
Marsters, covered the distance under !
1 min. 55 sec., with the latter doing it j
from a running start in 1 min. 53 sec. [
the day before.
In the hurdles. Dye, U. S. C., has an ;
excellent chance to take a first, though j
Moore, Penn State, will probably have j
a slight edge. Becker will not have as ;
good an opportunity to get points as
two years ago, when he was able to
place third.
In the field events, outside of Hou
ser, the West will not be able to make
as much a clean up as two years ago,
when California won the title. Gerkin
should not get better than third in
the shot, as Hills, Princeton, will push
Houser all the way. The discus will
prove better, as the Penn Relay marks
were below 140 feet. But in the javelin
the East has developed some notable
performers, headed by Bench who, in
early season, has already thrown the
spear 18G feet. The Dodsons, however,
should have little difficulty in placing.
California may possibly get a few
points in the pole vault and high jump,
but the field will be very excellent in
these events. The West will lose out
in the hammer, which is not used on
the coast.

The two-mile will give the Bears an- j
other chance to do some heavy scoring j
when Stevens and Schwobeda are pit- j
ted against Smith of Yale, intercolle-j
giate cross-country champion, and Tib
betts, of Harvard.
From his performances this year,
Martz, U. S. C., should not be able to
place in the quarter, while chances
are slim for the West in the mile.
