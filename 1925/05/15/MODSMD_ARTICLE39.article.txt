# THREE P. A. A. SENIOR SWIMMING TITLES AT STAKE IN CARD POOL
## Besides Championship Events Borg, White Will Appear In Exhibitions 
### F. W. Speers 
Three P. A. A. senior swimming titles
will be at stake Saturday in the meet
to be held in the Encina pool at 1:30.
! j Exhibition performances by White,
_ | Olympic diving champion, and Arne
1 Borg, Swedish ace, will round off the
' | program.
The three P. A. A. events are the 300-
11 yard medley; 800-foot relay (4 men);
! and low-board diving competition. The
medley consists of a hundrey yards each
| of breast, back, and free style swimming.
Besides Coach Ernie Brandsten's
Cardinal swimmers men from the Olym
pic Club and the Neptune Club will be
the main contenders for the honors.
Several unattached men of ability in
the bay region have sent in their entries
and may uncover some unexpected
ability.
. Allen Good in Medley
, j A. J. Allen, winner of the 100-yard
] backstroke race in the Stanford-Cali
; fornia dual meet this spring, is the lead-
I ing contender for the medley race. Allen
! is one of the best men on the coast in
the medley event,"-and with the endurance
he possesses is a heavy favorite for the
j first place medal.
Three Winged "O" men, Hanley,
; Mitchell, and Howell, together with
j Goldwater of Neptune, are those who
> will be on hand to press or pass Allen,
j Stanford's other entry in this event is
; R. E. Williams, who is a strong running
; mate for Allen.
The 800-foot relay, won last year by
the Olympic Club men, should be one
; of the most hotly contested events on
the program. Brandsten has been hold
ing tryouts for the team berths during
the past week and from eight men will
select his team tomorrow. The eight
; from whom Brandsten will pick the
team are J. G. Carson. A. J. Allen, R. E.
Williams, C. H. McCallister, C. B.
Stevenson, P. G. Brooks, L. S. Fletcher,
and A. C. Wright.
j Almost any four of these men can
| make up a team that will do 2 :28 or bet
ter for the distance. Stanford nabbed a
national junior championship in a 200-
1 yard relay event held in April in San
| Francisco, but Brandsten will probably
i change the line-up for the longer race.
The low-board diving event, won last
year by A1 White, former Stanford star,
who will not compete in this event this
year, will be fought for by Patterson
| and Carrol, of the Olympic Club and
| several Stanford men. The Cardinals
j competing in this event are J. E. Ken
: ney, C. M. Bean, E. A. Smith, W. T.
Mills, and M. R. Gibbons. D. A. Fall,
j Cardinal ace, is still out of competition
! because of illness.
The two exhibition events scheduled
! for tomorrow are a special 500-yard
; event, with Arne Borg swimming against
| a picked team of five freshmen, and ex
hibition diving by A1 White. The fresh
| men who will probably swim in the relay
; arc Kyrne Vanden Akker, C. H. Moore,
| H. A. Klein, R. F. Sims, and W. H. Dan
! ford.
