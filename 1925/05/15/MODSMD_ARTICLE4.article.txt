# FRESHMAN RUSHING RULES ALTERED FOR NEXT WEEK'S DATES
## 
### 
Two days of grace will be allowed
the fraternities and freshmen to
morrow and Sunday as tonight at 8
o'clock the first week of rushing
ends. There will be no rushing for
the next two days, but on Monday
the freshmen are again allowed at
the houses.

Rushing the first part of next
week will be the same as this week,
but on Friday dates will last until
1 a.m. and on Saturday the 1928
men are allowed to stay at the fra
ternities all day. The freshmen may
accept as many dates as they wish
during the next two weeks, but they
are compelled to attend the house
that they sign up for on the cards
sent out yesterday.
