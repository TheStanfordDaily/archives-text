# PERU GOVERNMENT TITLE OF BOOK BY PROFESSOR STUART
## 
### 
"Governmental System of Peru" is
the name of a book which Professor
G. H. Stuart, of the Political Science
department, has just finished writing,
and which will be published in the
near future.
Professor Stuart was sent to Peru
under the auspices of the Carnegie
Institute of Washington to make a
study of the government. His book
comprises comparisons in theory and
practice of the former and present
constitutions there: makes a study of
the executive, legislative, and judicial
systems. He says that, though the gov
ernment appears on the face to be
parliamentary, it is really presidential.
In fact, the president has almost dicta
torial powers. The Carnegie Institute
is a non-political organization, so the
book, being written for it, does not
deal in political theorizing, but con
fines itself to facts and actual practice.
Travels in Interior
In getting material for the book,
Professor Stuart found it necessary to
travel extensively in the interior of
Peru. He discussed the problems with
political men, lawyers, merchants, and
foreigners, spending six months in
South America.
American influence is found to a
very great extent, he discovered. The
naval policy is practically made by
United States men, and the customs
offices, school systems, and irrigation
projects are all handled by American
people. Practically all of the public
works are being done by an American
corporation, the Foundation Company,
of New York and San Francisco. He
also states that the universities are
inferior to those of Europe and Amer
ica. Law is the favorite subject with
the Peruvian students.
