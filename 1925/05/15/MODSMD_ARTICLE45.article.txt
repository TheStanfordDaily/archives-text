# ELECTRIC LINES FOR PENINSULA URGED IN MEETING AT REDWOOD
## 
### 
Proposals for electric communication
on the peninsula were drawn up at a
meeting of the Chambers of Commerce
of the various cities of the south bay
region held at Redwood City Tuesday
evening.
The plan advocated by the meeting
of the business men drew up a plan
which, if adopted by the Southern
Pacific railroad, will furnish electric
car service from San Jose to San Fran
cisco. The plan was not one for the
mere electrification of the regular line
but calls for a new line to be built
paralleling the highway and present
road. The problem of.distributing pas
sengers in San Francisco would be fa
cilitated by running the line on streets
parallel to Market.
The findings of the meeting will be
submitted to San Francisco's city engi
neer, O'Shaughnessy, who will decide
upon their feasibility before the move
is brought to the attention of the
Southern Pacific Company.
