"Startng upon a journalistic career |
in a small town is superior to begin
ning newspaper work in a large city," j
is the declaration of Buford O. Brown,
assistant professor of journalism at
Stanford and past editor of various
Texas publications. "Opportunity
knocks as insistently and as loudly
in the small communities as in the;
cities.
"The country newspaper offers a
salary at the' start which compares
favorably with that offered by the
metropolitan daily and the chances for i
advancement (even if there are no
$25,000 jobs in the small towns) com
pare favorably with those of the city. !
Work is hard and hours long, but it is I
a much more liesurely task than writ-1
ingon a city paper.
