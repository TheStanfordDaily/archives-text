# FOUR-FIFTHS OF MEN APPLICANTS ADMITTED TO STANFORD YEARLY
## 
### 
While only one woman in five can
hope to gain admittance to Stanford
University, four out of five men mak
ing application can expect to become
students here, according to O. L. Eliot,
Registrar. Last Fall 450 men were ad
mitted and 150 were refused.
As with women, priority of applica
tion no longer counts, and men are ad
mitted solely on the basis of intelli
gence and preparatory records. Quite
often a man with a high intelligence
score may be admitted with a scholas
tic standing below that generally re
quired, for the intelligence score tal
lies very closely with the college rec
ord made by the student after taking
the test.

The University of Michigan includes
"barnyard golf" in its intramural
games.
