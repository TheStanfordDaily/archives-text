# EL CAPITAN TAKES TITLE IN LEAGUE VII FROM A. K. L. NINE 7-6
## LAST INNING RALLY WINS Two Playoffs for University Baseball Championship Take Place Monday 
### A. M. Espinosa, Jr 
i El Capitan took the title in League
j VII yesterday by defeating Alpha
Kappa Lambda 7 to 6. El Capitan was
[ successful in both its playoffs for the
I title, defeating the Delta Upsilon nine
Wednesday, 5 to 3.
Alpha Kappa Lambda led until the
last inning, but in the last of the sev
enth, three hits and two errors over
came a three-run lead and gave the
contest to El Capitan.
Each nine scored one run in each;
of the first three innings, but air-tight;
fielding in the fifth and sixth frames
on the part of the A. K. L. nine, kept j
El Capitan scoreless until the last of;
the seventh. In the first of the sixth, j
Marsh, El Capitan pitcher, assisted
three successive putouts.
When El Capitan came up to bat in !
the last of the seventh, Alpha Kappa j
Lambda was leading, 6 to 3. The first!
two El Capitan men singled, and a 1
walk filled the bases. Another hit ;
brought in a run. With the bases full,!
no outs, and the A. K. L. nine two
runs ahead, the Alpha Kappa Lambda j
infield blew up and two errors allowed
three more El Capitan runners to cross !
the plate.
Both pitchÂ«rs hurled steady ball, fan-j
ning five batters apiece. Both sides!
clouted the ball hard and often, but
only two smashes, both by Barnett, j
A. K. L. catcher, went out for more!
than two bases.
Rouse, at second base for the win
ners, starred for El Capitan, keeping j
the A. K. L. total down by a number j
of clever catches. Kellogg played his j
usual steady game at first base for:
Alpha Kappa Lambda.
Monday's games will be playoffs for
the University championship, between
the winners of League I and IV, and II
vs. VII. El Campo will play Kappa |
Sigma, with the latter slightly favored, j
while El Capitan will tangle with j
Sigma Nu. Wilson, Sigma Nu pitcher, j
is good enough to give the Sigma Nus!
the contest. I
