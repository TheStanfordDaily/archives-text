# EIGHT MEN REPORT FOR FIRST MEETING OF QUAD TRYOUTEES
## 
### 
The first call for tryoutees for the
next year's Quad, a meeting held yes
terday afternoon, was responded to by
a tournout of but eight men. The work
!of the sophomore tryoutees was ex-
I plained and a summary of the Quad
work given the men by B. L. McGann,
editor of the Quad of next year.
From now until the close of school
j tryoutees are encouraged to sign up
for the competition which will start
j the last week of May of this quarter
I and continue during the whole of next
| year. The tryoutee period under the
new system, which will be fully estab
lished next year, will end at the close
! of the sophomore year when the edi
; tor, manager, and women's editor of
the 1928 Quad will be chosen. The
I oditor, manager, and women's editor
then chosen will spend the following
year in planning their book and will
take active control of the Quad in their
! senior year.
It will be noted that this year will
: be the last time that the Quad will
appear with a title which will classify
it as a Junior publication. Next year's
book will not be called the 1927 Quad
but will be known simply as "The
I Quad, Volume XXXV," the following
year the title will either be the "1027
I Quad" or some other title which will
be up to the discretion of the editor.
H. Devlin has been placed in charge
of the tryoutees for next year and
those wishing to try out this spring
are urged to communicate with either
him or 13. L. McGann at the Phi Kappa
Sigma house or to the Quad office in
i the Administration building.
