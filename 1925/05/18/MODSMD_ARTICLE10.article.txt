# MURPHY, PATCHETT, AND HYLAND STAR IN FOOTBALL GAME
## 
### 
The playing of several new men was
the outstanding feature of the foot
ball game that ended the spring prac
tice season last Friday afternoon. The
contest was a close fight between a
team composed of red-shirted players
and one wearing white jerseys. Reds
won when Freeman made the only
touchdown of the afternoon in the
third quarter with a short run around
end.
Murphy, Patchett, and Hyland were
the outstanding stars in the backfield,
while Poulson, Van Hook and Graves
played the best on the line. Murphy
was the most consistent yard-gainer
on the field, besides being the de
fensive star of the afternoon. Time
after time Murphy broke away on end
runs and off tackle bucks for first
downs for the redshirts.
By using rugby tactics, Hyland was
able to gain practically every time he
was given the ball. Hyland was a mem
ber of the American rugby team and
his clever ability to run open field will
make him a valuable man for the var
sity next fall.
Patchett, playing at fullback, proved
the big surprise of the afternoon when
he made ground consistently through
the center of the opponents' line.
Patchett was a substitute on Hunt's
freshman team this year.
The linemen played well on the de
fense, but this may have been due to
the fact that both teams used the
same plays with different signals.
Graves, at end, did some clever tack
ling to stop end runs.
Substitutions were made at the end
of each quarter which gave every man
out for spring practice a chance to
show his ability.
The starting lineup was as follows:
Vincenti RE Graves
Raffetto RT E. Pott?
Harris RG Hertti
Van Hook C Natchei
E. Post LG Stevenson
Poulson LT S. Post
Price LE Davidson
Walker Q Baxtei
Rogue RH Murphj
Hyland LH Hil!
Young F Patchett
Referee â€”Charles Davis.
