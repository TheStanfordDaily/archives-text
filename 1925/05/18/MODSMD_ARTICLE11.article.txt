Britton's pitching won for El Campo.
This was Britton's third straight win
in five consecutive days. Monday he
pulled the Sigma Chi game out of the
fire when he relieved Smith; Tuesday
he downed Theta Xi, 8-5; and Friday
he pitched his best game of the sea
son, and would have shut out the hard
hitting Kappa Sigs if he had had bet
ter support. Three errors were chalked
up against his teammates.
El Campo piled up a lead of two
runs in the first inning, when Schoen
singled, Smith got on on an error,
and Bigelow singled, bringing in
Schoen and Smith. Another run fol
lowed in the fifth when Bigelow, after j
hitting safely, scored.
Kappa Sigma was scoreless until,
the third, when two errors and a hit |
by Shipkey, scored two runs. From |
then on the El Campo support light
ened up, and Britton kept the Kappa
Sigs scoreless.
Moore pitched fair ball for the
losers, and his support was perfect.
The Kappa Sig infield was about the
best seen in intramural competition j
this year. Bigelow starred at bat for j
the winners, obtaining three hits, one I
a three-base blow, out of four times j
at bat. T. E. Shipkey starred for the!
Kappa Sigs.
