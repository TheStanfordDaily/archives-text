# "EMERSON AND HIS FRIENDS" SUBJECT OF TUESDAY TALK
## 
### 
"Emerson and His Friends" is the
topic of the lecture to be delivered to
morrow night at 7 :30 in the Little The
ater. Charles J. Woodbury, who will
give the talk, is the only author and lec
turer now living who knew Ralph Waldo
Emerson, Thoreau, and the great Con
cord personalities. He was a student of
Emerson and was made a companion of
that group for years.
Woodbury has written a book about
these experiences which was published
in London and New York. His mission
for years has been to go among our in
stitutions of education giving a vivid
picture of these leaders as they lived at
home.
"Most undergraduates think that Em
erson is an academic 'heavy' and so
avoid him," said Woodbury. "To many
students he is little more than a curi
osity."
The lecture that is to be given to
morrow night is the first of a series of
talks that Woodbury has prepared on the
subject of Emerson. No feature of them
is to be found in any biography or litera
ture. They arc the impress that Emer
son and the other great personalities
made upon Woodbury. They are called
"Lecture Talks" because they are in
formal, without notes, and colloquial.
