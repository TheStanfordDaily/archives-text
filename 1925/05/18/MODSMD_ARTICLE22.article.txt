# Fair Athletic Recognitions
## 
### 
The world premier showing of the reformed Athletic Award Plan is
to be seen in the paper tonight. After weeks of effort, the committee has
promulgated the recommendation, as was predicted. And there are parts
of the proposal which are constructive.
For example, the proposal does away with the victory clauses and the
"distinction" clauses in the requirements for letters. Any team which
represents Stanford will get recognized, win or lose. And that is as it;
should be. The minimum accomplishment to entitle one to an award is
definitely and fairly defined. If it were not that the students would have
to accept the rest of the plan to gain these benefits, it might be a good idea
to accept the proposition.
Four major and four minor sports are proposed. Football, track,
basketball, baseball; tennis, swimming, boxing, and soccer are listed in the
order named. In spite of the results of the straw ballot, polo is not listed
either as a respectable sport or as an outcast auxiliary.
Approval of the plan means approval of these groupings.
Disapproval means voting. Whatever one's sentiments on the pro
posal are, they don't make any difference unless they are indicated on a
ballot.
Too much weight should not be given the Board of Athletic Control
statement that if the number of awards is not cut, the appropriation for
buying them will be limited. It is the right to wear the letter that is imr
portant, not the charity.
Then there are the activities which lose the most money to be consid
ered. The group which is shoved into the "Auxiliary Sport" corner are
recognized, not distinctively but discriminately. It is said the medals
which they are to be given are hot stuff. If medals are so desirable, why
didn't somebody suggest letting these auxiliary athletes get along the best
way possible with a letter and give the others medals ?
This suggestion would have everybody against it. As the plan stands,
only the auxiliary athletes are slighted. Carrying out the policy of equal
opportunity for all in athletics, certainly should involve similar insignias
of recognition for all.
Interest should be encouraged in sport. One sport should not be en
couraged particularly because it is interesting. It is the participation
which counts, not the non-participant gallery.
No objections have yet been made to the distinctive letter plan which
was announced in the Daily recently. Nothing but fault has been found
with the proposed plan.
There are two systems better than the one suggested. They are: the
present arrangement, for one, and secondly and better, the system which is
in practice in the important eastern universities.
The eastern plan of distinguishable awards has already been explained.
In the following letter a further idea of the counter proposal may be had.
Mr. Hal Rorke,, Editor,
The Daily Palo Alto, Campus.
My Dear Mr. Rorke:
For your information in following up your ideas in regard to athletic awards as
expressed in your editorials I am glad to submit to you the following details of the
award system at' other institutions.
As I explained to you Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Dartmouth, give distinctive
awards for each sport. The varsity letter is given in tlie four or five major sports
football, baseball, track, and crew and, at Harvard, hockey. The distinction between
the sports is indicated by the color scheme.
For example, at Harvard a red letter on a black sweater is given for football, a
black letter on a red sweater for baseball, a red letter on a white swetaer for crew
and a white letter on a red sweater for track. The hockey "H" is a red "H" with a
narrow white border along the edge of the "H."
"T. H. T." is given for tennis and similar distinctive insignia arc given for the
other minor sports.
At Harvard there is an important distinction' made between the granting of in
signia and the granting of sweaters, sweaters being given only to major sport partici
pants.
In this connection, and as an example of the other extreme, the University of
Chicago has for several years done away with all distinctions in athletic awards.
The varsity letter is given to participants in ten sports without distinction of size,
color, or other arrangement.
Mr. Stagg, tl)e Director of Athletics at the University of Chicago, reports that
this plan is working out very satisfactorily.
It will be of interest to you to know that at the staff meeting held recently all
of the members of the staff, with the exception of two men, voted that they were not
in favor at this time of limiting athletic awards. They expressed the belief that men
received but little recognition for their hard work and achievement and that we should
be as liberal with our awards as possible within the limits of common sense.
Five of us made the suggestion to the Executive Committee that the awards in
minor sports be in the nature of insignia for sweaters, such insignia to be distinctive
for each sport as at the Eastern college mentioned above.
Sincerely yours, W. H. BARROW.

THE STAFF OF THE DAILY will meet tomorrow at 1 o'clock for j
the purpose of selecting an editor for next year.
