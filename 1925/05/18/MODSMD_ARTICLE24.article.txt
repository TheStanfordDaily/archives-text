Oh, the lads that, get "B's" And the
' girls that get "A's,"
And never get "C's," are deserving
of praise;
And I must admit when to high school
I went
I liked them O. K. —we were marked
by per cent.
But the ones that do flunk, or at most
get a "D,"
So their records are punk, now look
better to me.
For here at the college they take us
en masse
To discover an average for grading
the class. —J. B. P., '28.
