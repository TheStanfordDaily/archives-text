# CAPELLA CHOIR GIVES RELIGIOUS PROGRAM IN MEMORIAL CHURCH
## 
### Herbert Klein 
The atmosphere of the Memoria
Church rrnde an appropriate setting foi
the concert of the A. Capella Choir oi
the College of the Pacific given there
yesterday afternoon at 4 o'clock. Th<
choir showed training as well as experi
ence and were well able to do justict
to the difficult pieces in their program
Although singing entirely without am
sort of accompaniment they never los'
pitch or sang off key.
Dean Charles M. Dennis, director oi
the choir, although restricting himsell
to music of religious nature, made fron
that a program with variety and con
trast. Three groups of songs, classed
according to the school under which the\!
were composed, were presented. Each
section had certain appealing qualities
and interest of its own so that the same
ness and monotony, often a part of pro
grams confined exclusively to sacred
music, was entirely avoided.
The choir was one of mixed voices
and an excellent balance was kept be
tween the men's and women's part. The
black robes worn by the singers gave the
group a uniform and dignified appear
ance that emphasized the impressiveness
of their music.
The first group was devoted to two
composers of the 16th century, the great
Palestrina, whose 400 th birthday is be
ing widely celebrated, and his contem
porary, Vittoria. The mystical and har
monic beauty of this school was well
brought out. Slavic religious music,
mainly that of Rachmaninoff and Tchai
kowsky, made up the next section. This
had more of energy and abruptness than
the songs of the old Italian masters. The
recital closed with five songs drawn
from various sources, some modern and
with English words. The clear and
careful ennunciation of the singers made
them clearly understandable.
A Latin hymn adapted from Bach, by
Dean Charles Dennis, was the closing
number.
