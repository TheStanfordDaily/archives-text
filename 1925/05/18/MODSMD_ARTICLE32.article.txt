# MINING PROFESSOR INVESTIGATES ALLOY
## 
### 
Welton J. Crook, associate professor
of Mining and Metallurgy, has been
named by a prominent group of business
men connected with the Scliwerin iron
and steel interests in San Francisco to
make a complete investigation of a new
aluminum alloy which it is believed may
in time replace steel as a material for
engineering construction purposes.
The alloy is found to be particularly
suited for tbe construction of automotive
engines, aeroplanes, and hydroplanes. It
may be easily cast into intricate shapes
and it is said to be highly resistent to
corosion by salt water.
Professor Crook will make an exhaus
tive study of the characteristics of the
metal in tbe laboratories of the Mining
and Metallurgy department.

Fifteen thousand persons from all
parts of California are expected to at
tend the dedication of the first group
of home buildings at St. Vincent's
school for boys at San Rafael on Sun
day, May 10. Construction on the sec
ond unit of the $500,000 building pro
gram will be opened with the laying
of the corner stone by Archbishop
Hanna.
