The cast of "Polly With a Past," as
announced today by Charles Parks,
chairman of the Senior Farce Commit
tee, contains many names familiar to
campus theatergoers.
Aileen Burks, playing the lead, Polly,
will be remembered for her characteriza
tions in "Captain Applejack" and the
Junior Opera of last year. Leonard
Schwartz, playing opposite her in the
role of Rex Van Zile, made his reputa
tion in "Dulcy," and added to his fame
with the part of "Rickey" 'in "You
and I."
Alan Robertson, leading man of
"R.U.R." and "You and I," has the ap
pealing role of Harry Richardson, a
bachelor, who is intrigued with the
vivacious Polly. William Pabst,, who
appeared in the recent Ram's Head
show, and sang one of the numbers in
the Track Show, will play the other
bachelor role, Clay Collum.
Other members of the cast who have
appeared in Assembly hall productions
are David Lamson, in "Milestones" last
year; Norris James, in "The Dover
Road;" and Ross Smith, in "The Devil's
Daughter."
Rehearsals will start tonight in the
Assembly hall at 7 o'clock, under the
direction of Charles Parks, who will be
in charge until Gordon Davis returns
from the East the first of next month â€¢
