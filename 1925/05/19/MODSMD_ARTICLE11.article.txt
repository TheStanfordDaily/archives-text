# Donation of Books Asked By Appointment Office
## 
### 
The University appointment office re
quests all people possessing used books to
donate them, if possible, to the Robert F.
Stever loan library of text books for the
use of self-supporting' students.
The library has been used extensively
this year by students working their way
through the university, and as a result
more books are needed each year to supply
the demand.
The appointment' office has recently se
cured a large assortment of men's cloth
ing, and any self-supporting student de
siring help in this way may procure
clothes by seeing Mr. Barker in the ap
pointment office.
