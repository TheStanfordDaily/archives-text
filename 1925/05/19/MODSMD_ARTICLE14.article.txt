# LACROSSE MAY BE INTRODUCED HERE; WARNER TO COACH
## 
### 
Glenn S. Warner, football coach, is in
favor of starting the game lacrosse on
the coast. He has coached it at Carlyle.
The season for the game is from
March until June, which is the time of
the year when all sports have been fin
ished at Stanford.
Lacrosse originated among the Indian
tribes of North America. A big match
was almost as big an event' as a war. The
Indians spent the night before a contest
in celebration, and bets of panics, beads
or firewater were made on the game.
Sometimes as many as 1000 men played
on a side, and the game ended when one
tribe had collected 100 goals. This us
ually occupied the entire day. The play
ers pounded each other on the head with
the playing sticks, and the squaws fol
lowed their chiefs about the field of play
with a whip to keep him playing as hard
as possible.
Today lacrosse is the national game of
Canada, and a popular contest in most
eastern colleges. Yale, Harvard, Prince
ton, Johns Hopkins, Lehigh, Pennsyl
vania, Columbia, Cornell, and Swarth
morc all play lacrosse as one of the main
sports during the spring time.
It is played on a field 125 feet long and
from 50 to 75 feet wide, with a goal at
each eild. A rubber ball about the size of
a tennis ball is bated about by a four-foot
stick which has a net at the end of it.
Twelve men usually constitute a side, al
though any even number of men can play
the game. The contest is played in thirty
or forty-five minute halves.
Although the game appears to be some
what dangerous, it is quite safe, as the
sticks thta are used are light and almost
harmless. It is an interesting game to
watch, and it is quickly understood.
