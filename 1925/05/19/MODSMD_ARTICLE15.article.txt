# Valuable Material Contained In Hoover Library Collection
## 
### 
The gathering of materials for a
special collection of publications con-,
cerning the Great War has now been
in progress six years. The result is
the Hoover War library.
Work was started on this collection
in 1919 when Herbert Hoover financed I
a commission for the purpose of gath-i
ering a historical collection on the
Great War.
Looking over the field of work, it |
was seen that the immediate problem j
was not the war, but the Peace Con- j
ference then being held. The first work
at Paris, then, was the collection of
delegation propaganda.
Work on governmental documents
was not undertaken until that for dele
gation propaganda was nearly finished.
For the United States documentary
material an arrangement was made
with the Library of Congress. The
total number of items received in the
government document classification is
twenty-seven thousand.
The problem of buying war books is
not easy. Purchases are being made
only after examination of analytical
catalogs or lists, or upon dependable
advice.
No special efforts have been made

to secure private or unusual collec- j
tions of war materials, but some few i
purchases have been made, the more
important of which are as follows: j
Gazette des Ardennes, Libre Belgique, j
Documents of the Moments, Belgium
newspapers, the Smith collection, the
"War Book Club" collection, and the
United States National War Labor
Board Docket.
In the matter of large posters and
proclamations, the decision was not |
to attempt any comprehensive collec- j
tion. Nevertheless the Iloover War
Collection has several thousand post
ers from all countries at war. These
have usually been gifts or miscellane
ous material included in other pur
chases.
Special opportunities have occasion
ally arisen to secure newspaper flies,
and these have been taken. The inten
tion of the libray is to secure merely
two or three files from each country.
A remarkably complete collection of j
German and Austrian newspapers for,
the period of the war are now in the'
collection.
