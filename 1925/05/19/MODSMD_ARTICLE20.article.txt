# BOXING TOURNEY ENTRIES WILL CLOSE TOMORROW
## 
### 
Entries for the boxing and fencing
tournament to he held in the pavilion
Friday night will close at 6 o'clock to
morrow afternoon. All men who wish
to compete are urged to sign up before
that time.
"Unless more men," said Harry Mo
loney this morning, "sign up in all
classes other than the lightweight, the
bouts will have to be allied off. The
medals for the champion and runner
up are expensive, and it would not be
fair to those donating the medals if
more men do not compete in each di
vision. Several men have signified
their intention to compete but have not
as yet signed up for the tournament."
