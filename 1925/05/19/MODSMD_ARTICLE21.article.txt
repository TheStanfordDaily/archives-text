# FOURTEEN NAMED AS STANFORD ENTRANTS IN CONFERENCE MEET
## Eight Track Athletes, Six Field Men Will Make Trip to Seattle 
### 
Eight track and six field event' men
were named by W. H. Barrows this morn
ing as the Stanford representatives in the
Pacific Coast Conference Championship
meet which will he held in Seattle on
May 30. The track men who will make
the trip are: Caspar, Leistner, Dole,
Storie, Miller, Richardson, Smith, and
Kerr; the field event men are: Captain
Hartranft, Hoffman, Evers, Crookshank,
Mcßae, and Work.
The Cardinal should lie able to figure
for first places in all events with the ex
ception of the two-mile run and the pole
vault in which no Stanford men are being
entered, and the two sprint races which
are being run by Sweet of Montana in
times that nearly approximate the world's
records.
Hartranft Not in Sprints
Leistner will be the busiest man on the
field for he is scheduled to appear in both
hurdle races and possibly the 100 and 220.
It has been decided that Hartranft will
enter only the weight events, leaving the
sprints to Gaspar and Leistner. The
Stanford captain will be making his final
effort under the Cardinal to smash the ex
isting record in the shot put.
Dole lias been chosen largely because
of his versatility and his competitive abil
ity. Tentative plans call for him enter
ing the hurdles, the half-mile and if nec
essary the relay. Richardson, the fore
most Cardinal entry in the half-mile, will
have for his closest competitor Char
teris, a University of Washington sopho
more who covers the 880 yards consist
ently around 1:57. Richardson will also
be used in the relay, and there is a bare
chance that he will be called upon to be
the running mate of Storie and Miller in
the 440.
Hoffman in Weights
Hoffman will be assisting Hartranft to
garner points in the discus and shot, while
Evers will uphold the Cardinal unassisted
in the javelin. Smith and Kerr will run
the mile with the possibility of the former
also being entered in the half-mile. Mc-
Rae and Work will be Stanford's best
bets in the broad and high jumps respect
ively. Crookshank will be a utility man
in both events. Past performances mark
him as being stronger in the broad jump,
but as the height of the high jump in
northern regions throughout the entire
season has been unusually poor he is al
most sure to take points in both events.
As California and U. S. C. will not be
•represented at' the Seattle meet, and the
northern teams have shown but little
strength, the Cardinal should experience
little difficulty in coming out on top.

Eight track and six field event' men
were named by W. H. Barrows this morn
ing as the Stanford representatives in the
Pacific Coast Conference Championship
meet which will he held in Seattle on
May 30. The track men who will make
the trip are: Caspar, Leistner, Dole,
Storie, Miller, Richardson, Smith, and
Kerr; the field event men are: Captain
Hartranft, Hoffman, Evers, Crookshank,
Mcßae, and Work.
The Cardinal should lie able to figure
for first places in all events with the ex
ception of the two-mile run and the pole
vault in which no Stanford men are being
entered, and the two sprint races which
are being run by Sweet of Montana in
times that nearly approximate the world's
records.
Hartranft Not in Sprints
Leistner will be the busiest man on the
field for he is scheduled to appear in both
hurdle races and possibly the 100 and 220.
It has been decided that Hartranft will
enter only the weight events, leaving the
sprints to Gaspar and Leistner. The
Stanford captain will be making his final
effort under the Cardinal to smash the ex
isting record in the shot put.
Dole lias been chosen largely because
of his versatility and his competitive abil
ity. Tentative plans call for him enter
ing the hurdles, the half-mile and if nec
essary the relay. Richardson, the fore
most Cardinal entry in the half-mile, will
have for his closest competitor Char
teris, a University of Washington sopho
more who covers the 880 yards consist
ently around 1:57. Richardson will also
be used in the relay, and there is a bare
chance that he will be called upon to be
the running mate of Storie and Miller in
the 440.
Hoffman in Weights
Hoffman will be assisting Hartranft to
garner points in the discus and shot, while
Evers will uphold the Cardinal unassisted
in the javelin. Smith and Kerr will run
the mile with the possibility of the former
also being entered in the half-mile. Mc-
Rae and Work will be Stanford's best
bets in the broad and high jumps respect
ively. Crookshank will be a utility man
in both events. Past performances mark
him as being stronger in the broad jump,
but as the height of the high jump in
northern regions throughout the entire
season has been unusually poor he is al
most sure to take points in both events.
As California and U. S. C. will not be
•represented at' the Seattle meet, and the
northern teams have shown but little
strength, the Cardinal should experience
little difficulty in coming out on top.
