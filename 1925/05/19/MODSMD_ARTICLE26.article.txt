According to a nationwide vote cast recently by several hundred
scholars, Harvard leads all other colleges of the United States in the excel
lence of nine of its departments of instruction, and it is judged second in
five other departments. The University of Chicago is rated second, and
Columbia University, third, these three institutions receiving a surprising
majority of the votes cast, while many other prominent colleges were con
spicuously missing from the ballots cast.
Each man who voted was conspicuous in the field in which he named
the leading institutions. Thus a fairly accurate result might be expected
from a comparison of ballots submitted by numbers of men prominent in
a variety of fields throughout the country. The concentration of votes
upon the three universities mentioned is therefore surprising and signifi
cant, and an examination of what leads to this general appreciation of ex
cellence should be made, using the results of the present poll as a basis of
further investigation. That comparatively few colleges lead in a great
number of fields is certainly not generally realized, nor the coincidence
appreciated even in the selection of an institution in which to undertake
graduate work. The vote was understood to refer primarily to the grad
uate departments, but as President Hughes points out, there is little dis
tinction between the undergraduate and the graduate facilities in most
American colleges.
There is an eternal danger in statistics. They are often inhuman, and
they seldom give full indication of true values, merely presenting a cold,
worldly intimation of fact. In the present poll the same peril is obviously
existent, for while this or that college may lead in the field, some other,
perhaps hardly known, institution, may be giving a type of instruction
which far excels in real worth to the individual student that which may be
given the individual student in the larger institution whose facilities are
more generally appreciated. Thus, while the figures are valuable and sig
nificant, the aspiring student need not go to Harvard for chemistry or
English, merely because the vote indicated that the departments there are
the best, nor to Chicago for sociology or geography for a similar reason.
