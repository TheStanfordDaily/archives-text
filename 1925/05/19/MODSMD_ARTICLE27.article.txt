# The
						New Editor

### 
Wallace W. Knox was selected as next year's editor of the Daily
Palo Alto this afternoon when the staff approved of his candidacy by
more than two-thirds majority, so failing to nominate any other.
Knox has been on the staff since his freshman year, serving in every
capacity. This term he has performed the duties of Managing Editor
with exceptional efficiency as well as acting as campus correspondent for
an international press service. Knox is also a member of the 1926 Quad
staff, and he is further known to the campus for the news stories and edi
torials which have appeared in the Daily over his signature.
Combined with the abiities of the excellent staff which will return next
year, Knox's editorial direction should develop the paper enormously.
