## "MADAME CLAIRE" 
### Susan Ertz 
"Madame Claire not only faced facts
squarely, but she had a way of seeing
under and around them as well, which
greatly endeared her to the more dis
criminating of her children and grand
children." Her son and two of her
grandchildren (not his children, how
ever), were not only kinfolk but
friends to her. They confided in her.
Noel and Judy, of whose mother Ma
dame Claire had said, "I have never
outgrown a feeling of amazement at
having achieved anything as correct
as Millicent," told her practically
everything.
Since Claire had three children,
three grandchildren, and a love affair
of her own, there are plenty of inter
twining plots. This, however, does not
injure the lucidity of the story in the
least. Eric, Claire's brilliant son, had
married a woman to whom he was
superior; Connie had run away with a
musician, and afterward made a mess
of her life in a series of marriages
and separations; Millicent was unsuc
cessfully trying to force her daughter,
Judy, to marry some eligible young
man.. Gordon, Millicent's eldest son,
married an Ottway, and discovered
that she had an iron will; Judy fell in
love with a "nobody" whom she had
knocked down once while riding in a
motor car; Noel undertook to save
Connie from her weakness. All of these
things came to Claire, and in all of
them she had a part.
Clairo herself was the widow of a
splendid diplomat, Robert Gregory. All
her life she had had another lover,
Stephen de Lisle. Stephen had been
abroad since Robert's death twenty
years ago. Now Stephen wrote to

Claire, and a friendly correspondence
began. In all their letters was the same
frankness that held between Claire and
her grandchildren, Noel and Judy.
These letters were to both of them
the most important things in their old
age, uhtil Stephen came home to Eng
land.
