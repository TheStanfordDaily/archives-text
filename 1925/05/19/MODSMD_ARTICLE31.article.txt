## TOAST 
### Steve O'Donnell 
Down a shot to Mary Rose,
She doesn't dance in freakish pose,
Or publicly dab at her nose
With powder puff, or role her hose;
So have a horn on Mary Rose.
Or should we toast young Mabel
Haight?
She always takes her liquor straight,
And stays out very, very late.
With the men, does Mabel rate?
I hope to shout. She's quite the date.
All right, let's drink to Mabel Haight!
