# STANFORD COACHING SCHOOL FORERUNNER OF NEW DEPARTMENT
## 
### 
The Stanford Summer School of Phy
sical Education and Coaching, which the
university will conduct for the first time
this quarter, will be the forerunner of a
•permanent department-of Physical Educa
tion in which men may major, if the pres
ent plans of W. H. Barrow, director of
Encina gymnasium, materialize.
" 1 he present staff of the Physical Edu
cation department is engaged in working
with undergraduates, and in applying their
principles of Physical Education, but if
it were a department' of academic recog
nition, it could give the proper foundation
to others to apply those principles."
The Stanford idea of sports is that of
unbeatable intercollegiate teams, backed
by the support' of the undergraduates with
the proper attitude toward athletics be
cause of general participation by all.
General Participation
"There is no place in the country where
the general participation in sports and all
types of sport are more emphasized than
at Stanford. The training of teachers in
this idea would spread the Stanford spirit
of sport throughout the country.
"The need for a school of physical edu
cation has arisen from the great demand
for teachers of Physical Education. A
graduate from the school would go out
qualified to do school work in physical
education and coaching.. All the states
require educational qualifications other
tlian athletic ability to handle athletics in
schools. In California, before a man
handles the subject, he must be specially
trained in Biology, Physiology, Educa
tion, theories of leadership and in other
subjects required in other teaching posi
tions.
"In addition, the teacher must be trained
in gymnasium work, its proper application
to the work of boys at different ages, in
corrective gymnastics, and in all kinds of
athletics, since the big factor in physical
education is the giving of all a chance to
participate in some sport.
"The present gymnasium plant, and its
staff arc the beginnings of facilities for a
workshop for such a school. In addition,
two or three more staff members trained
in physical education lines, proper quar
ters for the officers, a small library, and
academic recognition as an academic de
partment for majoring must be obtained.
"In the last need, most of the opposition
against the plan is encountered. The ob
jection of the faculty is based on the mis
conception that the man handling athletics
is an athlete merely teaching games. Phy
sical education proper includes all the
physical welfare work for growing boys."

"In addition, the teacher must be trained
in gymnasium work, its proper application
to the work of boys at different ages, in
corrective gymnastics, and in all kinds of
athletics, since the big factor in physical
education is the giving of all a chance to
participate in some sport.
"The present gymnasium plant, and its
staff arc the beginnings of facilities for a
workshop for such a school. In addition,
two or three more staff members trained
in physical education lines, proper quar
ters for the officers, a small library, and
academic recognition as an academic de
partment for majoring must be obtained.
"In the last need, most of the opposition
against the plan is encountered. The ob
jection of the faculty is based on the mis
conception that the man handling athletics
is an athlete merely teaching games. Phy
sical education proper includes all the
physical welfare work for growing boys."
The Stanford Summer School of Phy
sical Education and Coaching, which the
university will conduct for the first time
this quarter, will be the forerunner of a
•permanent department-of Physical Educa
tion in which men may major, if the pres
ent plans of W. H. Barrow, director of
Encina gymnasium, materialize.
" 1 he present staff of the Physical Edu
cation department is engaged in working
with undergraduates, and in applying their
principles of Physical Education, but if
it were a department' of academic recog
nition, it could give the proper foundation
to others to apply those principles."
The Stanford idea of sports is that of
unbeatable intercollegiate teams, backed
by the support' of the undergraduates with
the proper attitude toward athletics be
cause of general participation by all.
General Participation
"There is no place in the country where
the general participation in sports and all
types of sport are more emphasized than
at Stanford. The training of teachers in
this idea would spread the Stanford spirit
of sport throughout the country.
"The need for a school of physical edu
cation has arisen from the great demand
for teachers of Physical Education. A
graduate from the school would go out
qualified to do school work in physical
education and coaching.. All the states
require educational qualifications other
tlian athletic ability to handle athletics in
schools. In California, before a man
handles the subject, he must be specially
trained in Biology, Physiology, Educa
tion, theories of leadership and in other
subjects required in other teaching posi
tions.
"In addition, the teacher must be trained
