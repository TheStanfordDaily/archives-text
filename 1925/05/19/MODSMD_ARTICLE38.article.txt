The Editor, Sir:
There seems to be at least one mem
ber of our newly acquired and newly
uniformed Palo Alto police who has
chosen a new way to become officious.
Many students upon going to the Stan
ford Theatre Sunday night found they
were able to purchase only one ticket.
One of our loyal policemen stood by
the window to see that no one student
bought more than one ticket. The rea
son for such action was not explained.
If the management ordered such ac
tion let it explain to us their reasons.
If they must station a policeman at the
window to see that the money does
not roll in too fast then let them get
one who is not so officious and insult
ing. It was embarrassing for some of
us who had invited friends to go to
the show to find when we got there
that the representatives of the law
would not permit us to buy more than
one ticket. It was necessary for us to
give our guests thirty cents apiece and
send them to the end of the line. The
writer did not stay to see what would
happen if some one brought his girl,
but from all appearances it would be
necessary for her, too, to get in line
and buy a ticket. Will the students
tolerate such insults? —H. L. N.
