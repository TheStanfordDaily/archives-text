# When It Rains It Pours In Engineering Buildings

### 
Serious property damage has been
threatened to equipment in the Engi- i
neering building and laboratory by the
recent rains, due to defects in the tiled
roofs. Drawing tables, machinery, and
plastering have suffered from leaks,
while pools of water stand about the
floor.
Wraterproof coverings have been
placed over the electrical equipment
in the laboratory, but floors and plas
tering cannot be protected. This leak-'
age has been more or less severe for
several years, and repairs have been
made. According to Professor G. H.;
Marx, extensive remodeling will be
necessary to put the roofs in good
shape. |
