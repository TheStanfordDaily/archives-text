# Original Slow Motion Pictures Were Made On Stanford Farm

### 
Slow motion pictures for the study
of rapidly moving objects are supposed
to be a fairly recent invention, but
Senator Stanford used this device, or
one very much like it, to study the
paces of his trotting horses over fifty
years ago.
Stanford had for a long time be
lieved that the prevailing theories of
animal motion were wrong. Among
other things in contradiction to the
theories then existing, he believed
that a trotting horse raises all four
feet from the ground during the cycle
of its motion. A friend of his placed a
bet of $25,000 against him that this
was not so.

Senator Stanford persuaded E. J.
Muybridge, a noted photographer in
motion picture work, to take a series
of instantaneous pictures of horses in
motion to determine if his theories
were true.
The series of experiments which
followed resulted in important changes
in the theories of animal motion. The
existing laws were proved to be wrong
and many pictures and statues depict
ing horses in motion were shown to
be erroneous. A book written in con
nection with these experiments by Dr.
A. P. B. Stillman, brother of the late
Dr. Stillman, head of the chemistry
department, set forth a statement of
the true principles of animal motion.
Stanford won his bet, but only after
he had paid about $12,000 for appa
ratus. Another fact, however, of equal
importance, was that the pictures
taken enabled Stanford to study the
paces of his horses so minutely that
he was able to train and balance them
so as to attain the maximum speed.
The results were astonishing. Stanford
horses held world's championships for
many years. So fast were his trotting
horses that cases have been reported
where they were ruled off of southern
tracks because they spoiled the compe
tition.
The first experiments were conduct
ed by Muybridge in 1872. In the begin
ning only a single camera was used.

! A great number of instantaneous pic
; tures were taken of Occident, a fam
ous trotting horse. Several of these
showed the horse with all four feet
off the ground while trotting. These
pictures proved that a fast trotting
horse has all four feet off the ground
twice during a complete set of motion.
They were received throughout the
world with astonishment and incredu
lity.
So successful were these first ex
periments that when Muybridge re
turned to California in 1878, Senator
Stanford determined to carry out a
more extensive series of experiments.
J This time, instead of one camera, a
I row of twelve cameras was used. The
j cameras were placed along the track
at a distance of twenty-one inches
apart. Numbers were placed along the
track at the same interval so that each
picture had a definite number. The
shutters were released one after the
other in rapid succession by a clock
work. The pictures were taken against
a white background so that the mov
ing horses appeared as silhouettes.
The method of making the exposures
was later changed. Wires conected
with each shutter were stretched
across a groove in the track. The sulky
wheel passing through the groove over
these wires released the shutters in
succession as the horse passed before
them. Later the shutters were opened
by a series of threads, stretched at a
height of four feet across the track
which, when the horse touched them,
pulled an electrical contact closed
thus causing an electromagnet to re
lease the shutter. The threads were
thin enough so that they broke without
wounding the horse. The number of
cameras was also increased to twenty
four and the distance between them
decreased to twelve inches.
The whole series of pictures was
taken in less than a second, and be
cause they show successive stages of
motion they are exactly similar to
modern motion picture films. The only
difference was that twenty-four fixed
cameras were used instead of one
camera with a moving film. Muybridge
later applied the idea obtained from
these pictures to the invention of the
motion picture machine.
The copy of the book by Stillman
entitled "The Horse in Motion" and
a complete collection of the photo
graphs by Muybridge are to be found
among the personal belongings of the
Stanford family in the museum.
