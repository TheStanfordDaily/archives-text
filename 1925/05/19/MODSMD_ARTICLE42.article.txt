A collection of paintings of Cali
fornia wild flowers, by Ethel Wicks,
San Francisco artist, will go on dis
play at the Stanford Art Gallery next
week. The collection is v&lued at

Besides being of artistic value, these
paintings have been favorably com
mented upon by botanists on account
of the exact reproduction of the
flowers.

Australian, and Italian. These prints
are made in the different processes of
etchings, dry points, block prints, litho
graphs, mezzotints, aquatints, and
