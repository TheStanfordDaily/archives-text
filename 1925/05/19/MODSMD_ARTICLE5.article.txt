## 
### 
C. W. Davis, director of intramural
I athletics, stated yesterday that he did
; not favor the proposed system for ath
letic awards as it is at present.
Davis believes that an athlete would
prefer a letter to a medal in one of
the sports such as fencing, cross-coun
try, or gym, which would be termed
"auxiliary" sports if the proposed
amendment to the A. S. S. U. constitu
tion is accepted in the election May 26.
Any system which would tend to
reduce the number of awards was not
in accord with Davis' views because
of a danger that this might tend to
keep potential stars away from the
University. But, on the other hand, he
declared, letters should be hard to se
cure, and then only given after a sea
son of intensive training.
As a solution of the difficulties,
Davis favors the adoption of a system
of markings designating the sport in
which the letter is made. This plan is
one used in the East with success.
Davis expressed the belief that the
medal plan might suggest commercial
izing the award for a given sport.
