# GORDON DA VIS DESCRIBES YEAR'S PRODUCTIONS IN NEW YORK CITY
## 
### 
Gordon Davis, University dramatic
coach, who is now in New York City,
has written the following letter to a
j friend, which gives a graphic descrip
! tion of some of the noteworthy plays
J of the season.
Davis expects to return to the cam
i pus about the first of June, when he
! will take over the direction of the
| Senior Farce, "Polly With a Past," re
hearsals for which have been started
under the direction of Charles Parks,
Chairman of the Senior Farce Com
mittee.
Davis' letter is as follows:
I haven't forgotten that I promised
you a letter about the plays in New
York. I must begin by saying that I
found this spring's crop a bit of a
disappointment. A year ago I saw a
number of plays which were so good
that I was eager to get them into my
clutches so that I could show them to
our Stanford audiences. I don't think
that I have encountered one such play
on this visit. At least not among the
new plays. The best things in town
i are the revivals of the work of older
dramatists. Ibsen has been rediscov
ered and Shaw still holds his own.
Right here I must eliminate "What
Price Glory" from any generalization
I may make. It has been the season's
outstanding success —a play that is at
once challenging, though provocative,
and "good theatre" besides. But I have
not yet seen it. I could not get a seat.
I tried a second and a third time with
no better success. Hard on me but
wonderful for the authors. As you
know, one of the two authors of the
piece is Maxwell Anderson, a former
Stanford man. I hope that all future
Stanford dramatists will turn me away
for just the same reason. Then they
| will grow so rich that they may pre
j sent us with a new Assembly hall.
What has made so many plays im
| possible this year is the sex theme
mania. While I am not in favor of
j lowering the threshhold of dramatic
I consciousness to that of the hypo
tlietical young female offspring of the
j "can-I-take my daughter" theatregoer,
j still I can see no excuse for the sen
! sationalism of this past season. It is
! interesting to note that among those
who led the revolt against such plays
were actors and people of the theatre.
Fortunately common sense and a ra
tional censorship prevailed in the nick
of time or the situation might have
precipitated a stupid and stultifying
political censorship. But the attendant
publicity has had the effect of making
the audiences so sex skittish and alert
that some fine and moving plays have
| their best moments ruined by demon
stration from the audience. It is
enough to make one lose faith in the
intelligence of the American theatre
audience to hear the yells of delight
that greet some of the lines in Eugene
O'Neill's sincere and powerful tragedy,
"Desire Under the Elms."
Unique Presentation
By the way, this play liafe the most
unique method of presentation. When
the curtain rises you see before you
the exterior of a two-story frame farm
house in New England. The first scene
takes place in the yard which lies be
tween the house and the footlights.
When the characters disappear into
the house at the end of the scene the
stage goes dark for a moment. During
the interval a segment of the front of
the house is removed and when the 1
lights -go up you see right into one of j
the rooms of the house. By the same
process of exposure you follow the |
action of the play from room to room i
—sitting room and kitchen downstairs
and two bedrooms upstairs. Sometimes ;
the drama is unfolding in two or three j
of the rooms and the yard outside the |
house simultaneously. It gives you the I
uncanny and uncomfortable effect of (
being an eavesdropper and a Peeping
Tom—you feel that you are doing
wrong but so fascinated that you can't
tear yourself away. Mary Morris, who
plays the heroine, does some extra-!
ordinary fine acting. Perhaps you may '
remember her as the leading woman
for a time at the little Maitland Play- !
house in San Francisco, or as a mem-'
her of the Stage Guild at the Plaza, j
two or three years ago.
'I'llis brings me to the redeeming fea- 1
tures of this season's offerings. And I
these are fine acting, adroit direction,!
and novelty and invention in produc- 1

j tion methods. It is hard to imagine the
j eight or ten really good plays now run
ning in New York better acted or bet-
I ter directed anywhere else in the
! world. The same can be said in regard
|to stage scene and costume design.
Our American theatre has today a rap
i idly increasing group of players, direc
! tors, and stage designers of intelli
gence and unusual ability. But we
j must have the dramatists worthy of
, their metal. The universities are be
, ginning to do their share in the devel
, opment of the native playwright by
not only offering courses in dramatic
construction but by building theatre
S laboratories where the best of modern
: and classic plays can be acted and pro
duced, thus giving the embryo writer
that very necessary practical contact
. with his medium.
"Green Hat" Impressive
While en route to New York I was
fortunate enough to see the opening
performance of Michael Arlen's play,
"The Green Hat," dramatized by Arlen
; from his novel of the same name. The
J play will not go into New York till
; next season. I sat but a few feet away
from Mr. Arlen and it was interesting
to watch the most-talked-of English
novelist of the day react to the very
first performance of his very first play.
The cting of Katherine Cornell, Ann
Harding, and Leslie Howard was a
treat. These three are nicely repre
sentative of the younger generation in
our theatre—young people who bring
to their art not talent alone but those
qualities of intelligence, character, and
good breeding which are a bit indefin
able perhaps, but which "get over" the
footlights quite definitely. Miss Cor
nell's equally young husband directed
the play, and Michael Arlen.is said to
be under thirty. Truly this is at once
a dramatic age and an age of youth.
"Wild Duck" Is Best
The best production I've seen is that
of Ibsen's "Wild Duck." As an exam
ple of distinguished acting and perfect
ensemble work I think that we can
compare it with the work of the fam
ous Moscow Art Theatre under the di
rection of Stanislawsky whose plays
I witnessed last year in New York. It is
interesting to note that this play and
its theatre is operated by an associa
tion of actors called the Actors Thea
tre. and that the play was directed by
Dudely Digges and Clare Eames, both
of them players who were acting in
other New York productions at the
time they were staging this play.
"They Knew What They Wanted" is
a play by a Californian, Sidney How
ard, who makes dramatic use of the
California of today. The scene is laid
at Napa and when the heroine said'
that she went to school at Mountain
View I felt quite homesick. The play
has just been awarded the Pullitzer
prize for 1925. It shows what can be
done with fine acting and a native
playwright of great promise and sin- !
ceritv. Pauline Lord, Richard Bennett,'
and Glen Anders give superb perform- j
antes. The latter is a young man of 1
grit as well as ability. He told me that
he finished his university course at
Columbia and received his degree
while he supported himself by acting
at night.
I am wofking to secure the rights !
for Stanford production of a number |
of plays, most of which I saw last!
year. I hope that we can have as j
well-rounded and representative a se
lection as we had this past year. But'
the problem of plays is becoming more |
difficult. Managers are waking up to!
the amateur theatre and its following;
and they are tying up the amateur j
rights as well as the professional. This !
is rather hard on a community like
ours away from a real producing cen- j
tre because we like to see in addition
to standard and classic plays the best
of what the modern dramatists are
doing both in this country and Europe.

"They Knew What They Wanted" is

California of today. The scene is laid
at Napa and when the heroine said'
that she went to school at Mountain

has just been awarded the Pullitzer

Gordon Davis, University dramatic

mittee.
Davis' letter is as follows:
I haven't forgotten that I promised
you a letter about the plays in New
York. I must begin by saying that I
found this spring's crop a bit of a
disappointment. A year ago I saw a
number of plays which were so good
that I was eager to get them into my
clutches so that I could show them to
our Stanford audiences. I don't think
that I have encountered one such play
on this visit. At least not among the
new plays. The best things in town
i are the revivals of the work of older
dramatists. Ibsen has been rediscov
ered and Shaw still holds his own.
Right here I must eliminate "What
Price Glory" from any generalization
I may make. It has been the season's
outstanding success —a play that is at
once challenging, though provocative,
and "good theatre" besides. But I have
not yet seen it. I could not get a seat.
I tried a second and a third time with
no better success. Hard on me but
wonderful for the authors. As you
know, one of the two authors of the
piece is Maxwell Anderson, a former
Stanford man. I hope that all future
Stanford dramatists will turn me away
for just the same reason. Then they
| will grow so rich that they may pre
j sent us with a new Assembly hall.
What has made so many plays im
| possible this year is the sex theme
mania. While I am not in favor of
j lowering the threshhold of dramatic
I consciousness to that of the hypo
tlietical young female offspring of the
j "can-I-take my daughter" theatregoer,
j still I can see no excuse for the sen
! sationalism of this past season. It is
! interesting to note that among those
who led the revolt against such plays
were actors and people of the theatre.
Fortunately common sense and a ra
tional censorship prevailed in the nick
of time or the situation might have
precipitated a stupid and stultifying
political censorship. But the attendant
publicity has had the effect of making
the audiences so sex skittish and alert
that some fine and moving plays have
| their best moments ruined by demon
stration from the audience. It is
enough to make one lose faith in the
intelligence of the American theatre
audience to hear the yells of delight
that greet some of the lines in Eugene
O'Neill's sincere and powerful tragedy,
"Desire Under the Elms."
Unique Presentation
By the way, this play liafe the most
unique method of presentation. When
the curtain rises you see before you
the exterior of a two-story frame farm
house in New England. The first scene
takes place in the yard which lies be
tween the house and the footlights.
When the characters disappear into
the house at the end of the scene the
stage goes dark for a moment. During
the interval a segment of the front of
the house is removed and when the 1
lights -go up you see right into one of j
the rooms of the house. By the same
process of exposure you follow the |
action of the play from room to room i
—sitting room and kitchen downstairs
and two bedrooms upstairs. Sometimes ;
the drama is unfolding in two or three j
of the rooms and the yard outside the |
house simultaneously. It gives you the I
uncanny and uncomfortable effect of (
being an eavesdropper and a Peeping
Tom—you feel that you are doing
wrong but so fascinated that you can't
tear yourself away. Mary Morris, who
plays the heroine, does some extra-!
ordinary fine acting. Perhaps you may '
remember her as the leading woman
for a time at the little Maitland Play- !
house in San Francisco, or as a mem-'
her of the Stage Guild at the Plaza, j
two or three years ago.
'I'llis brings me to the redeeming fea- 1
tures of this season's offerings. And I
these are fine acting, adroit direction,!
and novelty and invention in produc- 1

j tion methods. It is hard to imagine the
j eight or ten really good plays now run
ning in New York better acted or bet-
I ter directed anywhere else in the
! world. The same can be said in regard
|to stage scene and costume design.
Our American theatre has today a rap
i idly increasing group of players, direc
! tors, and stage designers of intelli
gence and unusual ability. But we
j must have the dramatists worthy of
, their metal. The universities are be
, ginning to do their share in the devel
, opment of the native playwright by
not only offering courses in dramatic
construction but by building theatre
S laboratories where the best of modern
: and classic plays can be acted and pro
duced, thus giving the embryo writer
that very necessary practical contact

"Green Hat" Impressive
While en route to New York I was
fortunate enough to see the opening
performance of Michael Arlen's play,
"The Green Hat," dramatized by Arlen
; from his novel of the same name. The
J play will not go into New York till
; next season. I sat but a few feet away
from Mr. Arlen and it was interesting
to watch the most-talked-of English
novelist of the day react to the very
first performance of his very first play.
The cting of Katherine Cornell, Ann
Harding, and Leslie Howard was a
treat. These three are nicely repre
sentative of the younger generation in
our theatre—young people who bring
to their art not talent alone but those
qualities of intelligence, character, and
good breeding which are a bit indefin
able perhaps, but which "get over" the
footlights quite definitely. Miss Cor
nell's equally young husband directed
the play, and Michael Arlen.is said to
be under thirty. Truly this is at once
a dramatic age and an age of youth.
"Wild Duck" Is Best
The best production I've seen is that
of Ibsen's "Wild Duck." As an exam
ple of distinguished acting and perfect
ensemble work I think that we can
compare it with the work of the fam
ous Moscow Art Theatre under the di
rection of Stanislawsky whose plays
I witnessed last year in New York. It is
interesting to note that this play and
its theatre is operated by an associa
tion of actors called the Actors Thea
tre. and that the play was directed by
Dudely Digges and Clare Eames, both
of them players who were acting in
other New York productions at the
time they were staging this play.

footlights quite definitely. Miss Cor

a dramatic age and an age of youth.
"Wild Duck" Is Best
The best production I've seen is that
of Ibsen's "Wild Duck." As an exam
ple of distinguished acting and perfect
ensemble work I think that we can
compare it with the work of the fam
ous Moscow Art Theatre under the di
rection of Stanislawsky whose plays
I witnessed last year in New York. It is
interesting to note that this play and
its theatre is operated by an associa
tion of actors called the Actors Thea
tre. and that the play was directed by
Dudely Digges and Clare Eames, both
of them players who were acting in
other New York productions at the
time they were staging this play.
"They Knew What They Wanted" is
a play by a Californian, Sidney How
ard, who makes dramatic use of the
California of today. The scene is laid
at Napa and when the heroine said'
that she went to school at Mountain
View I felt quite homesick. The play
has just been awarded the Pullitzer
prize for 1925. It shows what can be
done with fine acting and a native
playwright of great promise and sin- !
ceritv. Pauline Lord, Richard Bennett,'
and Glen Anders give superb perform- j
antes. The latter is a young man of 1
grit as well as ability. He told me that
he finished his university course at
Columbia and received his degree
while he supported himself by acting
at night.
I am wofking to secure the rights !
for Stanford production of a number |
of plays, most of which I saw last!
year. I hope that we can have as j
well-rounded and representative a se
lection as we had this past year. But'
the problem of plays is becoming more |
difficult. Managers are waking up to!
the amateur theatre and its following;
and they are tying up the amateur j
rights as well as the professional. This !
is rather hard on a community like
ours away from a real producing cen- j
tre because we like to see in addition
to standard and classic plays the best
of what the modern dramatists are
doing both in this country and Europe.
Gordon Davis, University dramatic
coach, who is now in New York City,
has written the following letter to a
j friend, which gives a graphic descrip
! tion of some of the noteworthy plays
J of the season.
Davis expects to return to the cam
i pus about the first of June, when he
! will take over the direction of the
| Senior Farce, "Polly With a Past," re
hearsals for which have been started
under the direction of Charles Parks,
Chairman of the Senior Farce Com
mittee.
Davis' letter is as follows:
I haven't forgotten that I promised
you a letter about the plays in New
York. I must begin by saying that I
found this spring's crop a bit of a
disappointment. A year ago I saw a
number of plays which were so good
that I was eager to get them into my
clutches so that I could show them to
our Stanford audiences. I don't think
that I have encountered one such play
on this visit. At least not among the
new plays. The best things in town
i are the revivals of the work of older
dramatists. Ibsen has been rediscov
ered and Shaw still holds his own.
Right here I must eliminate "What
Price Glory" from any generalization
I may make. It has been the season's
outstanding success —a play that is at
once challenging, though provocative,
and "good theatre" besides. But I have
not yet seen it. I could not get a seat.
I tried a second and a third time with
no better success. Hard on me but
wonderful for the authors. As you
know, one of the two authors of the
piece is Maxwell Anderson, a former
Stanford man. I hope that all future
Stanford dramatists will turn me away
for just the same reason. Then they
| will grow so rich that they may pre
j sent us with a new Assembly hall.
What has made so many plays im
| possible this year is the sex theme
mania. While I am not in favor of
j lowering the threshhold of dramatic
I consciousness to that of the hypo
tlietical young female offspring of the
j "can-I-take my daughter" theatregoer,
j still I can see no excuse for the sen
! sationalism of this past season. It is
! interesting to note that among those
who led the revolt against such plays
were actors and people of the theatre.
Fortunately common sense and a ra
tional censorship prevailed in the nick
of time or the situation might have
precipitated a stupid and stultifying
political censorship. But the attendant
publicity has had the effect of making
the audiences so sex skittish and alert
that some fine and moving plays have
| their best moments ruined by demon
stration from the audience. It is
enough to make one lose faith in the
intelligence of the American theatre
audience to hear the yells of delight
that greet some of the lines in Eugene
O'Neill's sincere and powerful tragedy,
"Desire Under the Elms."
Unique Presentation
By the way, this play liafe the most
unique method of presentation. When
the curtain rises you see before you
the exterior of a two-story frame farm
house in New England. The first scene
takes place in the yard which lies be
tween the house and the footlights.
When the characters disappear into
the house at the end of the scene the
stage goes dark for a moment. During
the interval a segment of the front of
the house is removed and when the 1
lights -go up you see right into one of j
the rooms of the house. By the same
process of exposure you follow the |
action of the play from room to room i
—sitting room and kitchen downstairs
and two bedrooms upstairs. Sometimes ;
the drama is unfolding in two or three j
of the rooms and the yard outside the |
house simultaneously. It gives you the I
uncanny and uncomfortable effect of (
being an eavesdropper and a Peeping
Tom—you feel that you are doing
wrong but so fascinated that you can't
tear yourself away. Mary Morris, who
plays the heroine, does some extra-!
ordinary fine acting. Perhaps you may '
remember her as the leading woman
for a time at the little Maitland Play- !
house in San Francisco, or as a mem-'
her of the Stage Guild at the Plaza, j
two or three years ago.
'I'llis brings me to the redeeming fea- 1
tures of this season's offerings. And I
these are fine acting, adroit direction,!
and novelty and invention in produc- 1

j tion methods. It is hard to imagine the
j eight or ten really good plays now run
ning in New York better acted or bet-
I ter directed anywhere else in the
! world. The same can be said in regard
|to stage scene and costume design.
Our American theatre has today a rap
i idly increasing group of players, direc
! tors, and stage designers of intelli
gence and unusual ability. But we
j must have the dramatists worthy of
, their metal. The universities are be
, ginning to do their share in the devel
, opment of the native playwright by
not only offering courses in dramatic
construction but by building theatre
S laboratories where the best of modern
: and classic plays can be acted and pro
duced, thus giving the embryo writer
that very necessary practical contact
. with his medium.

fortunate enough to see the opening

"Green Hat" Impressive
While en route to New York I was
fortunate enough to see the opening
performance of Michael Arlen's play,
"The Green Hat," dramatized by Arlen
; from his novel of the same name. The
J play will not go into New York till
; next season. I sat but a few feet away
from Mr. Arlen and it was interesting
to watch the most-talked-of English
novelist of the day react to the very
first performance of his very first play.
The cting of Katherine Cornell, Ann
Harding, and Leslie Howard was a
treat. These three are nicely repre
sentative of the younger generation in
our theatre—young people who bring
to their art not talent alone but those
qualities of intelligence, character, and
good breeding which are a bit indefin
able perhaps, but which "get over" the
footlights quite definitely. Miss Cor
nell's equally young husband directed
the play, and Michael Arlen.is said to
be under thirty. Truly this is at once
a dramatic age and an age of youth.
"Wild Duck" Is Best
The best production I've seen is that
of Ibsen's "Wild Duck." As an exam
ple of distinguished acting and perfect
ensemble work I think that we can
compare it with the work of the fam
ous Moscow Art Theatre under the di
rection of Stanislawsky whose plays
I witnessed last year in New York. It is
interesting to note that this play and
its theatre is operated by an associa
tion of actors called the Actors Thea
tre. and that the play was directed by
Dudely Digges and Clare Eames, both
of them players who were acting in
other New York productions at the
time they were staging this play.
"They Knew What They Wanted" is
a play by a Californian, Sidney How
ard, who makes dramatic use of the
California of today. The scene is laid
at Napa and when the heroine said'
that she went to school at Mountain
View I felt quite homesick. The play
has just been awarded the Pullitzer
prize for 1925. It shows what can be
done with fine acting and a native
playwright of great promise and sin- !
ceritv. Pauline Lord, Richard Bennett,'
and Glen Anders give superb perform- j
antes. The latter is a young man of 1
grit as well as ability. He told me that
he finished his university course at
Columbia and received his degree
while he supported himself by acting
at night.
I am wofking to secure the rights !
for Stanford production of a number |
of plays, most of which I saw last!
year. I hope that we can have as j
well-rounded and representative a se
lection as we had this past year. But'
the problem of plays is becoming more |
difficult. Managers are waking up to!
the amateur theatre and its following;
and they are tying up the amateur j
rights as well as the professional. This !
is rather hard on a community like
ours away from a real producing cen- j
tre because we like to see in addition
to standard and classic plays the best
of what the modern dramatists are
doing both in this country and Europe.
Gordon Davis, University dramatic
coach, who is now in New York City,
has written the following letter to a
j friend, which gives a graphic descrip
! tion of some of the noteworthy plays
J of the season.
Davis expects to return to the cam
i pus about the first of June, when he
! will take over the direction of the
| Senior Farce, "Polly With a Past," re
hearsals for which have been started
under the direction of Charles Parks,
Chairman of the Senior Farce Com
mittee.
Davis' letter is as follows:
I haven't forgotten that I promised
you a letter about the plays in New
York. I must begin by saying that I
found this spring's crop a bit of a
disappointment. A year ago I saw a
number of plays which were so good
that I was eager to get them into my
clutches so that I could show them to
our Stanford audiences. I don't think
that I have encountered one such play
on this visit. At least not among the
new plays. The best things in town
i are the revivals of the work of older
dramatists. Ibsen has been rediscov
ered and Shaw still holds his own.
Right here I must eliminate "What
Price Glory" from any generalization
I may make. It has been the season's
outstanding success —a play that is at
once challenging, though provocative,
and "good theatre" besides. But I have
not yet seen it. I could not get a seat.
I tried a second and a third time with
no better success. Hard on me but
wonderful for the authors. As you
know, one of the two authors of the
piece is Maxwell Anderson, a former
Stanford man. I hope that all future
Stanford dramatists will turn me away
for just the same reason. Then they
| will grow so rich that they may pre
j sent us with a new Assembly hall.
What has made so many plays im
| possible this year is the sex theme
mania. While I am not in favor of
j lowering the threshhold of dramatic
I consciousness to that of the hypo
tlietical young female offspring of the
j "can-I-take my daughter" theatregoer,
j still I can see no excuse for the sen
! sationalism of this past season. It is
! interesting to note that among those
who led the revolt against such plays
were actors and people of the theatre.
Fortunately common sense and a ra
tional censorship prevailed in the nick
of time or the situation might have
precipitated a stupid and stultifying
political censorship. But the attendant
publicity has had the effect of making
the audiences so sex skittish and alert
that some fine and moving plays have
| their best moments ruined by demon
stration from the audience. It is
enough to make one lose faith in the
intelligence of the American theatre
audience to hear the yells of delight
that greet some of the lines in Eugene
O'Neill's sincere and powerful tragedy,
"Desire Under the Elms."
Unique Presentation
By the way, this play liafe the most
unique method of presentation. When
the curtain rises you see before you
the exterior of a two-story frame farm
house in New England. The first scene
takes place in the yard which lies be
tween the house and the footlights.
When the characters disappear into
the house at the end of the scene the
stage goes dark for a moment. During
the interval a segment of the front of
the house is removed and when the 1
lights -go up you see right into one of j
the rooms of the house. By the same
process of exposure you follow the |
action of the play from room to room i
—sitting room and kitchen downstairs
and two bedrooms upstairs. Sometimes ;
the drama is unfolding in two or three j
of the rooms and the yard outside the |
house simultaneously. It gives you the I
uncanny and uncomfortable effect of (
being an eavesdropper and a Peeping
Tom—you feel that you are doing
wrong but so fascinated that you can't
tear yourself away. Mary Morris, who
plays the heroine, does some extra-!
ordinary fine acting. Perhaps you may '
remember her as the leading woman
for a time at the little Maitland Play- !
house in San Francisco, or as a mem-'
her of the Stage Guild at the Plaza, j
two or three years ago.
'I'llis brings me to the redeeming fea- 1
