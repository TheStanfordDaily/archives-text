# Free Rides on Campus Trolley Curbed at Last
## 
### 
The free taxi service furnished by
the Peninsular Railway between the
Bookstore and Encina hall has finally
been blocked effectively. A new plan
to prevent the freshmen from taking
advantage of the "Toonerville" was
adopted Wednesday when a guard ap
peared on the rear platform of every
car. The guard effectively prevents
free rides and is often used in the
evenings to keep the tired rough from
obtaining his transportation free, but
Wednesday a guard accompanied the
car on every trip. The solution was
found when it was noticed that the
guard boarded the car at the gymna
sium, rode to the end of the car line
past Encina to keep the roughs off
here, rode back to the gymnasium
again preventing free rides at the gym
he waited for the next car.
