# A. S. KLAUBER TO EDIT 1927 QUAD
## Manager to Be Selected by Quad Board in Second Meeting Tonight 
### 
Allan Salz Klauber, '27, was selected
as editor of the 1927 Quad at a meet
ing of the Quad board held last night.
The board meets again tonight to se
lect a manager for the book.
Klauber and his closest rival, R. S.
Rood, were tied in points earned as
tryoutees during the past year but the
board voted unanimously for Klauber's
appointment.
The Quad board which fills all posi
tions on the annual to which salaries
are attached consists of C. E. Beardsley,
O. H. Tucker, D. C. McKay, Lillian
F. Bid well, R. M. Kay, and L. B. Brown,
manager and editor respectively of
this year's Quad, B. L. McGann and
F. L. Matthay, editor and manager of
the annual for next year.
Leading candidates for the position
of manager are R. E. Paradise, K. L.
Starling, and J. T. DeFrees. The fol
lowing salaried positions will be
filled by the board next Tuesday eve
ning: assistant editor, women's editor,
photographic editor, in the editorial
department. In the managerial depart
ment a circulation manager, an adver
tising manager, and a women's mana
ger will be appointed.
Members of both managerial and
editorial staffs of the Stanford Quad j
are now recommended by a system j
of tryouts based on points earned by
tryoutees in doing the actual work of
the annual. <A definite number of
points is given for a definite amount
of work, and the relative standing of
those trying out can be checked at
any time. The point system is the out
growth of many years of experience in
organizing Quad work and serves as a
basis for selecting editor and manager.
A total of forty-five appeared at the
beginning of the year for editorial
tryouts. Seventeen were men and l
twenty-eight women. There were five ;
men and twelve women left in the j
race when it was decided last night. [
The editorial point system gives credit j
for time spent, for personal qualifica- i
tions applied to the work, and for spe-1
eial assignments such as stories or |
plans for Quad arrangements.
Seventeen tryoutees came out for
the managerial department at the first
of the year with six now remaining.
The managerial department gives j
points for selling Quads, securing ads, j
making contracts with organizations, j
collecting bills, office work, personal
qualifications, and general attitude to
ward work.
A photographic staff, introduced this ,
year, also has several tryoutees. Cer
tain pictures are assigned to each man
under the direction of the photogra
phic editor and the rating made upon \
the quality of work done. The recom- j
mendation is made by the photogra-!
phic editor through the Quad editor to
the Quad Board.
