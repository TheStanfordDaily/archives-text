## 
### 
The Rally Committee has inaugurated
a new plan whereby the names of the
candidates for yell leader in the coming
election may be put before the student
body without the political inequalities of
individual campaigns. By the new plan
the Rally Committee does the campaign
ing for all candidates on an equal footing
thus acquainting the student body with
them, and at the same time excluding the
necessity of combines which might give
certain candidates political advantages
over others.
Posters are being made by the commit
tee bearing the pictures of all the can
didates with their names below them, and
a plea to the student body to vote ac
cording to their actual opinion as to the
merits of the candidates, not according
«to any political prejudices.
Previously each candidate conducted
his own campaign. This led to political
combines that often prevented the best
candidate's election. Since such com
bines are no longer necessary, L. H.
Peter, chairman of the Rally Committee,
asks that students refuse to make any
affiliations either political or friendly.
The six candidates for assistant yell
leader from which two will be chosen
are J. L. Adams, J. G. Allen, B. C.
Craft, R. M. Frascr, H. B. Farr, R. W.
Grigg.
The Rally Committee will give a dance
for members of the committee on June 3
at which time the chairman of next year's
committee will be elected.
