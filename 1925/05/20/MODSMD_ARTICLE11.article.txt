# EMERSON'S CHARACTER IS LECTURE SUBJECT
## 
### 
"Serenity characterized the appear
ance of Emerson," said Charles J.
I Woodbury last night in his lecture on
: "Emerson and His Friends" in the
Little Theatre.
Woodbury talked about Emerson and
his friends, making them living per
sonalities for the audience. He gave
an intimate description of the charac
ter and appearance of the t great philo
sopher and word sketches of Louisa
Alcott, Frances Hodgson Burnett, and
Thoreau.
"Emerson always spoke to a person
j as if he were a large intelligent audi
l ence. He had a great power of stimu
j lating the interest of his listeners and
| constantly buoyed up his hearers to
| say things that they were not for
merly capable of," said Woodbury.
Had Awkward Figure
Some of Emerson's friends employed
a stenographer to take down his con
versations, but this was unsuccessful.
His voice was always in a low tone,
as one accustomed to be listened to.
He did not move or gesture when he
Rpoke, he always read his lectures,
and he never lowered his voice at a
period.
"He had an awkward figure with
long arms and legs, and large hands
and feet. He wore a stiff stock and ill
fitting coat," declared Woodbury,
speaking of his appearances.
Thoreau's Gems Unprinted
"The best thing that Thoreau ever
said never got into print. 'Could any
thing be sadder than to be taken for
more than you are worth'?" quoted
Woodbury. "He died like a stoic, re
fusing opiates. When asked if he had
made his peace with God, Thoreau
answered, 'I don't think we ever quar
reled'."
Woodbury spoke briefly of Frances
Hodgson Burnett. "At seven years of
age she could tell fascinating tales."
The friendship of Emerson and
Thoreau and the contrast in their char
acters were brought out in the lec
ture. Emerson, with his serene and
beautiful character, was the antithesis
of Thoreau's with his eccentric per
sonality.
