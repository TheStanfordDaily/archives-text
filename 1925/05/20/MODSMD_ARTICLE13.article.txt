# NEW TOUCHING SYSTEM OF TYPING PROVES SUCCESS

The Wiese-Coover Kinesthetic meth
od of learning touch typewriting, re
sulting from the collaboration of Dr.
John Edgar Coover, associate profes
sor of psychology, and E. G. Wiese,
speed demonstrator, and supervisor of
typing at the Behnke-Walker Business
College of Portland, Oregon, is at the
present time adapted for use in high
schools throughout the country.
In 1915, Wiese, speed demonstrator
for the Remington Typewriter Com
pany at the P. P. I. E. in San Fran
cisco, met Coover through the late Mr.
Clarke, academic secretary. At the
time Wiese was unable to enter pro
fessional typing tests because of the
fact that after forty-five minutes or so
of work at top speed, his fingers be
came numb and his speed decreased.
He asked Coover's aid in discovering
what caused the fatigue. The latter
took about forty tests of Wiese's typ
ing.
While carrying on a conversation in
French, Wiese was able to type Ger
man at the rate of 120 words per min
ute. The tests were of a very delicate,

complicated, and minute nature, and j
the matter was so involved that it was j
over two years before Coover was able '
to get results. He found that Wiese's
typing suffered because he had a men- j
tal picture of the keyboard, and under
distraction this picture became con-!
fused. Coover here saw the clue which
led to the kinesthetic system of typ
ing, so he abandoned the "fatigue i
search" and commenced to evolve an
entirely new and revolutionary system
of touch typewriting.
Method Tried at Stanford
In the summer of 1920 a few stu-1
dents in the typing classes at Stanford [
were instructed by the kinesthetic
method, and they progressed so much 1
more quickly than students learning j
by the old system, that the latter was
discarded and the new method put in ]
its place. A little later Wieste intro-!
duced the newly discovered system
with the Behnke-Walker Business Col
lege, Portland, Oregon, with amazing
success.
