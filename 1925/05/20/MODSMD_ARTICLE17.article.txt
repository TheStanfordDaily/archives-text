# D.P.A. STAFF VOTE IS RENDERED VALID
## D. C. Meiklejohn Withdraws Petition for A. S. S. U. Election of Editor 
### 
D. C. Meiklejohn today withdrew the
petition presented at the Executive
Oommitee last night to have his name
placed on the ballots Tuesday for the
editorship of the Daily Palo Alto. The
petition, signed by fifty qualified
voters, was granted at the meeting of
the Executive Committee last night.
W. W. Knox in the regular staff elec
tion yesterday defeated Meiklejohn
and the petition, had Meiklejohn al
lowed it, would have put the choice for
next year's D. P. A. editor to the
student body as a whole.
Varsity baseball awards for the
1924-25 season were granted last night
by the committee. Though J. S. Collins
and G. T. Oviatt had not played the
full three quarters in the Stanford-
California series they were granted
the block "S" on the recommendation
of Coach Harry Wolter. They had done
all of the pitching for the varsity team
in the preliminary season and each
pitched two and two-thirds innings in
the California series.
