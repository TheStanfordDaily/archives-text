# The
						Daily Merit System
## 
### 
In the constitution of the Associated Students of Stanford University
there is the recognition of an organization morale about the Daily Palo
Alto which is based upon a merit system of advancement. After a period
of competition, tryoutees are selected for staff positions on the basis of
the comparative excellence of their work. As staff members, these men
and women learn and improve, and find their ways finally to the top of
the staff when they become eligible for advancement to the position of
news editor.
Further competition ensues among the news editors, and those of them
whose experience and ability appear to warrant it most are made managing
editors. In every promotion, the service and merit of the individual is the
important consideration. And there is a good reason for this.
When freshmen come to college, they are neither required nor expected
to have any knowledge of newspaper work. Upon their aptitude and in
dustry depends the speed with which they become proficient in this field.
With each year of practice the staff members learn more of what they are
about. This ability which comes of experience is valuable and as the
knowledge of the staff is great or small, so the paper is, largely, better or
worse.
This merit system of competition deserves to be expanded in other
student fields. C. M.
