Stanford loses so many men in major sports next year that the list is
almost appalling and disheartening. Football gets the biggest slap with
eight men; basketball loses but two men; six will graduate from baselxill
competition; track loses eight, possibly ten, athletes, and tennis but one.
Sentimentality regarding the virtues of these men is out of place. Their
contribution to the advancement of Stanford in sports was faithfully and
unselfishly given; their capable performances emphasized by the string of
victories credited to Stanford against the University of California. Their
work is done, but it will be long before it is forgotten.
Due recognition is due therefore to: Lawson, Shipkey, Baker, Neill,
Cuddeback, Kelley, Cleaveland, Thomas, Johnston, Oliva, Solomon, Rob
erts, Mulchay, McCandless, Brown, Campbell, Swayne, Hartranft, Smith,
Charles Bell Leistner, Kemnitzer, Crookshank, Mcßae, and Overfeldt.
