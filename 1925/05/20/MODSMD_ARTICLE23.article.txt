# STUDENT REPORTERS HAVE INCOMES FROM OFF-CAMPUS PAPERS
## 
### 
Correspondents' positions with news
papers of the bay region and nearby dis
tricts are serving to give many students
interested in journalism an opportunity
to earn spare money.
By obtaining one of these positions
either on past experience or recommenda
tion from preceding correspondents, to
gether with the necessary qualification of
ability, students may obtain a fair income.
Not only do these positions serve as
sources of pay, but also the experience
in practical journalism and the con
tracts made with active newspapermen
are invaluable in the years after col
lege life.
Many students have used these posi
tions as stepping stones to large openings
in the field of journalism.
Five San Francisco papers have cor

items. Experience on the staff of the
Daily Palo Alto often serves as sufficient
recommendation for one of these offices.
Various news services such as the In
ternational, Universal Press, the Asso
ciated Press, and the United Press pay
their correspondents by stories, the writers
averaging from fifteen to twenty dollars
a month.

Small cities in the bay region such as San
Jose, Fresno, and Palo Alto in particular
have their staff correspondents at the Uni-1
vcrsity. The Daily Palo Alto Times
