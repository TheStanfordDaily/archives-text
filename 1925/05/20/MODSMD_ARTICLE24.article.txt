# F. T. CUTLER TELLS STORY OF CARVING MAUSOLEUM BLOCKS
## 
### 
An interesting side-light on the con
struction of the Stanford Mausoleum
is given in an article written by Allan
Harding for the April issue of the
American Magazine. Harding's article
on Vermont quarries tells of an inci
dent told by F. T. Cutler, who has been
employed in the granite business for
many years.
About forty years ago Cutler was in
charge of the biggest job of the time â€”
getting out the huge blocks for the
Stanford mausoleum. The great slab
quarried for the roof weighed over
fifty tons. Over two weeks were re
quired to move the roof-stone from the
quarries from which the mausoleum
blocks were taken to the town where
it was trimmed and polished before
shipment, a distance of only four miles.
The block was placed on heavy
wooden rollers, which rested on the
ground. Encountering great difficulties
the slab was slowly moved along the
road. A great part of the time the
horses were hitched behind to hold it
back as it went down hill.
One of the numerous difficulties en
countered was a soft spot in the
ground, where the rollers were use
less. After much planning and vain
attempts to pass the barrier of Nature,
finally one night the ground was frozen
and the caravan continued on its way.
After weeks of trimming and polish
ing, the huge slab was placed so that
it now forms the roof of the mauso
leum.

Women at the University of the City
of Toledo took an overnight hike rcccnt
ly. Although it was the first such hike
ever taken by university women there,
it was voted a huge success.
