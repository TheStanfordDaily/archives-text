"BEETHOVEN"—By Romain Rolland
This is the story of the life of an
artist written by one who himself is an
artist. Romain Rolland is not so much
a biographer as an epic poet in this short
volume. The same things that caused
him to write a life of Mahatma Ghandi
probably led him to set down the story
of tragedy of the existence of Ludwig
Beethoven, namely, the desire to tell the
world of one of its greatest spiritual
figures.
No one could accuse Rolland of taking
a too abstract and impersonal view in this
biography. He is strongly pro-Bee
thoven in all respects and does not dis
guise it a jot. This, of course, takes
away somewhat the historical accuracy
of the work but adds immensely to its
value as a sentimental human document.
Rolland may be accused of thinking with
his heart instead of his head in analyzing
the character of the great musician, but
Rolland is not and could not be the cold
impartial report recorder of facts and
documents. He has seen the tragic suf
ferings and struggles of one of the great
spirits of the world, a kindred artist and
the greatest among musicians. How can
he refrain from writing the story of the
man as he believes within his sympa
thetic consciousness that it must have
been lived?
And yet a remarkable restraint has
been shown, for the entire biography is
very short. It occupies only fifty-four
pages, the rest of the book being given
over to extracts from Beethoven's letters
that throw light upon the soul of the
genius. There is also included an
analytical discussion of his musical com
positions, including all nine symphonies,
as well as piano and instrumental music.
There is also a complete list of all Bee
thoven's musical compositions.
It is a book which every music lover
will appreciate. Romain Rolland knows
and understands the very essence of
music and his greatest work of fiction,
the epical "Jean Cristophe," is the story
of a musician's life. Ludwig Beethoven,
"the old grouch of Vienna," will have a
new significance for those who read this
short work. No longer will he be the
gloomy, introspective misanthrope and
crank, but instead he will become the
symbol of an indomitable spirit, refus
ing to bow to circumstance and fate. It
is shown that he had a love of nature
and of his fellow-men that was almost

j boundless and that he fought bravely to
prevent his heart from becoming em
j bittercd by his great misfortune, the
J greatest that can befall a musician, utter
i deafness.

will appreciate. Romain Rolland knows
and understands the very essence of
music and his greatest work of fiction,
the epical "Jean Cristophe," is the story
of a musician's life. Ludwig Beethoven,
"the old grouch of Vienna," will have a

short work. No longer will he be the
gloomy, introspective misanthrope and

symbol of an indomitable spirit, refus
ing to bow to circumstance and fate. It
is shown that he had a love of nature
and of his fellow-men that was almost

J greatest that can befall a musician, utter

"BEETHOVEN"—By Romain Rolland
This is the story of the life of an
artist written by one who himself is an
artist. Romain Rolland is not so much
a biographer as an epic poet in this short
volume. The same things that caused
him to write a life of Mahatma Ghandi
probably led him to set down the story
of tragedy of the existence of Ludwig
Beethoven, namely, the desire to tell the
world of one of its greatest spiritual
figures.
No one could accuse Rolland of taking
a too abstract and impersonal view in this
biography. He is strongly pro-Bee
thoven in all respects and does not dis
guise it a jot. This, of course, takes
away somewhat the historical accuracy
of the work but adds immensely to its
value as a sentimental human document.
Rolland may be accused of thinking with
his heart instead of his head in analyzing
the character of the great musician, but
Rolland is not and could not be the cold
impartial report recorder of facts and
documents. He has seen the tragic suf
ferings and struggles of one of the great
spirits of the world, a kindred artist and
the greatest among musicians. How can
he refrain from writing the story of the
man as he believes within his sympa
thetic consciousness that it must have
been lived?
And yet a remarkable restraint has
been shown, for the entire biography is
very short. It occupies only fifty-four
pages, the rest of the book being given
over to extracts from Beethoven's letters
that throw light upon the soul of the
genius. There is also included an
analytical discussion of his musical com
positions, including all nine symphonies,
as well as piano and instrumental music.
There is also a complete list of all Bee
thoven's musical compositions.
It is a book which every music lover
will appreciate. Romain Rolland knows
