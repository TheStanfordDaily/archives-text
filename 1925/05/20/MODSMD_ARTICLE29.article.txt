## "Dodson's Hints on Musical Hits" 
### 
Victor record 19575 was terribly slow
in coming but it was worth waiting
for. The best dance orchestras of Los
Angeles and San Francisco (you've
probably stepped to both) contribute
hits on oposite sides of this record
which will undoubtedly have a big
local sale.
Earl Burnett of Hotel Biltmore
fame, known on the records as Art
Hickman's Orchestra, makes the fox
trot most of a very beautiful song—
"Twilight."
Henry Halsted records "Playmates"
with true Halsted verve.
"Twilight" is all the name implies—
soft, melodious, smooth, gliding. "Play
mates" is lively, loud, and features
splendid rhythm.
