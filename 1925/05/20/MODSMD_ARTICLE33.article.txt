# Professor G. D. Shafer Will Discuss Growth of Insects
## 
### 
"Some Peculiarities of the Growth
of Insects, particularly of Dragon
Flies," will be the topic which Profes
sor G. D. Shafer of the Physiology de
partment will discuss before the Sci
ence Association at 8 o'clock tonight
in the Faculty Clubhouse.
It is not commonly known that in
sects have a hard outer skin which is
not elastic and does not permit growth.
This skin is shed and a new one
taken on within the short space of an
hour or two. How the insect manages
to expand within that time so that the
new skin will be large enough to per
mit growth will be explained in this
lecture.
