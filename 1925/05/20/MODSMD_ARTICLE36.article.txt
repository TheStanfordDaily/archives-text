## More Holes in One 
### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Is a hole in one at golf merely luck, or is it due to skill? Gene Sarazen is
both lucky and skillful, and, no matter which causes holes in one —accident
or accuracy—Gene certainly picked the time and place to make such a shot.
Last October, night golf was tested on the course at Briarcliff Lodge, where
Sarazen is the professional.
By the aid of powerful searchlights, and with nearly 10,000 people looking on,
the former United States Open Champion made the first hole in one stroke.
The flight of the ball was plainly visible from tee to hole, and never was the
stage so well set for a remarkable golf achievement.
There have been holes made in one stroke in important tournaments. Jock
Hutchison's ace at the eighth hole at St. Andrews in 1921 has been discussed
in these columns. The year before, Abe Mitchell did the eighth hole in one in
the British Open Championship at Deal. Jock won, due to his ace at the
eighth, but Abe was not so lucky.
