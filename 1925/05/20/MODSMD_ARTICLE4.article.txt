# Golf Club Will Oppose Proposed Awards Plan
## 
### 
i Organized opposition to the proposed
athletic awards plan will be planned by
! the Stanford Golf Club at a meeting in
| the Trophy Room of the Old Union at
[8:15 tonight.
I Other business that will come before
: the meeting will be the donations of the
j award to be given the winner of the
I intramural golf tournament which was
j held a few weeks ago. In all probability
I the club will furnish a perpetual trophy.
I A constitution is to be adopted, and
j officers for next year will be nominated.
As this will probably be the last meet
| ing of the year President Dorsey urges
all members to attend. The session will
be short, but important.
