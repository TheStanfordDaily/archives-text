# HOOVER LIBRARY IS FERTILE FIELD FOR ECONOMIC RESEARCH
## 
### 
"The Hoover War Library is an un
usually rich field for economic research,"
said Professor M. S. Wildman, head of
the Economics department.
"The library has often been thought
of as being only for the History depart
ment, but many other departments use
it," he continued. "Most of the work is
in graduate study, however the Eco
nomics Department lias .students working
on the various economic problems of the
war."
Three people who have obtained their
Ph.D. degrees in the Political Science
department, working in the Hoover Li
brary, are now professors; Miss Frances
Willis, at Vassar, Professor Frank Rus
sell, at the University of California, and
Professor Malvo Graham, at the Uni
versity of California, Southern Branch.
These people wrote theses on "The Gov
ernment of Belgium," "The Government
of the Saar Valley," and "The Develop
ment of the Law of Neutrality," respec
tively. The studies were made in refer
ence to the World War.
Other departments have been using the
library extensively. Dr. Lanz, professor
of Slavic Languages, has had students
doing graduate work; Economic students
are studying the reconstruction after the
war, and German students have been
studying war literature and German
"Self-help." The Food Research Insti
tute has had a number of books placed
in its own library.
The History department has used the
library more than the other departments.
There are a number of men now work
ing for degrees. Ph.D. theses are being
written by W. H. Cooke and Oswald
Wedel, instructors in Citizenship.
Mr. Cooke is outlining the activities
of Joseph Caillaux, who has just been
released from prison, and is adminis
trator of financial affairs of France. Mr.
Wedel is studying the relation of Aus
tria-Hungary and Germany during the
war.
Robert C. Binkley, librarian in the
Hoover Library, is studying the "Euro
pean Opinion of Woodrow Wilson dur
ing the Peace Conference."
The Hoover War Library is second to
none in its particular scope. It is larger
than the war section in the Congressional
Library in Washington and has much
material that the war library of Paris
d<ses not contain.
