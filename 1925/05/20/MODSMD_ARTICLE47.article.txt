# University Station Broadcasts Standard Wave Length Signals
## 
### Monroe Eaton 
Stanford University has a radio
broadcasting station that i 3 the only
one in the United States besides that
of the Bureau of Standards at Wash
ington which broadcasts telegraph sig
nals of standard wave lengths.
The work was started in October,
1923, when the Electrical Engineering
department was asked by the Bureau
of Standards to broadcast wave-length
signals for the Pacific Coast. The
broadcasting is carried on under the
direction of H. H. Henline, associate
professor of electrical engineering.
The wave-length range covered by
the station is from 50 to 2400 meters.
This includes practically all radio sta
tions of any wave length. Eight differ
ent wave lengths are broadcast at each
transmission.
Broadcasting on Schedule
The broadcasting is done by a sche
dule sent out by the Bureau of Stand
ards. Eight minutes is required.for the
transmission of each set of signals of
a standard wave length. For instance,
a set of signals on 100 meters lasting
eight minutes is sent out. The appar
atus is then changed, and a set on 91
meters is broadcast during the next
eight minutes, and so on through the
schedule. The broadcasting is done
twice a month between the hours of
10 p.m. and 11:30 p.m. The station's
schedule is as follows: April 20, 100
to 50 meters; May 5, 2400 to 952
meters; May 20, 1000 to 450 meters;
June 5, 545 to 200 meters; June 20,
200 to 100 meters. The signals are sent
in telegraphic code.
The standard waves sent out are used
by radio broadcasting and wireless
telegraph stations, to test the accuracy
of their instruments for measuring
wave lengths so that they may keep

their apparatus accurately adjusted. By
use of the signals they can check up
on their equipment twice a month. The
waves are also used by many experi
mental and amateur radio stations.
Wave Lengths Are Accurate
The Bureau of Standards requires
an accuracy of 3-10 of one per cent in
the wave length. The waves sent out
are measured accurately by a Bureau
of Standards meter and a record is
kept of the settings of the apparatus
during the transmission. From these
the operator can tell exactly what
wave length is being sent out.
The apparatus required for such ac
curate work is rather elaborate. Two
transmiting sets, one for low fre
quencies and one for high frequencies,
and two cage antennae 150 feet and
25 feet long are used. The power of
each set is 250 watts.
The range covered by the station is
500 to 1000 miles. This is not great
enough to reach to the area covered
by the Bureau of Standards station in
Washington. Radio stations in the
Middle West are unable to get stand
ard signals from either station. Conse
quently plans for the installation of a
station, similar to Stanford's, at the
University of Minnesota are under
way.
