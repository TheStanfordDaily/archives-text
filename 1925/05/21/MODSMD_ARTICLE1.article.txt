# AUDIENCE ENDORSES WOMEN SMOKERS AT OPEN FORUM
## Euphronia Society Debaters Defeat San Jose State Teachers College 
### 
The proposition that each woman
should have the right to decide for her
self whether she desires to smoke or not,
was upheld by the audience decision at
the open forum debate held last night in
the Lobby of the Old Union, between the
San Jose State Teachers College and the
Euphronia Society.
The Teachers College team, consisting
of Muss Esther Brooks, and Miss Rose
Brecker, maintained that smoking was
injurious to women, and that it had an
injurious effect on the coming generation.
Their second point was that women did
jiot want the right to smoke, basing their
-argument on the results of a recent vote
at the San Jose State Teachers College,
in which 6 women out of one hundred
•voted for women's smoking.
The Euphronia team granted that
smoking had equally injurious effects on
both men and women, and centered their
arguments on whether women should
have the right to choose for themselves
whether they wish to smoke or not.
The affirmative pointed out that since
-women have cast off limitations in other
fields, and that since the various moral
prejudices as regards the distinctions
between men and women have been done
away with, there is no reason why women
should not be considered capable of de
ciding for themselves whether they wish
to smoke or not.
Dean Yost, in explaining the position
of the University in regard to women's
smoking, stated that the policy of "no
smoking" by Stanford women was
originated by Mrs. Leland Stanford and
confirmed various times by conventions
of Stanford women; so consequently the
Women's Council has enforced the policy.
