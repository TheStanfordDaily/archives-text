# QUAD BOARD FAILS TO NAME MANAGER FOR 1928 ANNUAL
## Two Candidates Placed on A. S. S. U. Ballot for Tuesday Election 
### 
By reason of its failure to secure a
unanimous endorsement of any one
candidate for the managership of the
1928 Quad, the Quad Board last night
selected two candidates, Robert Para
dise and Kenyon Starling, whose
names will appear on the ballot next
Tuesday. This action was taken in
accordance with the provision in the
constitution which provides for the
election by the student body of Quad
officers in case the board fails to reach
a unanimous decision. The nomina
tions above, which do not require
unanimity of the board, were made by
a vote of five to two.
Both candidates have been mem
bers of the tryout staff of this year's
Quad, and the point rating of their
work is based on work over the period
since last October. The total number
of points, based on sales, advertising,
office work, organization
collections of bills, special bonuses,
and miscellaneous work, follows:
Paradise 4623
Starling 4584
The distribution of the points by de
partments is as follows:
Sales Advert'g. Office Wk.
Paradise ....868 1323 1969
