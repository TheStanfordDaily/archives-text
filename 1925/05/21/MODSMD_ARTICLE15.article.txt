# STUDENTS, COACHES GIVE VIEWS ON AWARDS PLAN
## Majority of Students Favor New Athletic System When Interviewed 
### 
When interviewed by the Daily Palo
Alto, the majority of the prominent
students expressed favor for the new
system of athletic awards that has
been proposed, and will be voted upon
by the student body next Tuesday.
Some of the men picked out certain
flaws in the plan, and a great many
were against having tennis reduced to
a minor sport. The interviews are as
follows:
T. F. MILLER
T. F. Miller, who has broken the
California-Stanford track record In the
quarter mile race twice in the last
two years, is in favor of the new sys
tem of athletic awards. Miller con
tends that the new system will only
cut about six men out of their block
"S" each year, and it will increase
the value of the "S" a great many
times.
Making the system unbreakable is
another point that Miller approves. In j
the same way that the new plan will ;
increase the value of the block letter, ;
it will make the circle "S" worth more
to the wearers.
C. E. BEARDSLEY
The president of the associated stu
dents, C. E. Beardsley, makes the fol
lowing statement in regards to the new j
plan for giving athletic awards:
"Since the two athletic organiza
tions —Skull and Snakes, and Circle S
Society—favor the new award system;
and since it has the approval of the
majority of the coaching staff, the
graduate manager, and the executive
committee of the A. S. S. U., it seems
to me wise to give the system a trial.
"In systematizing and making ab
solutely iron-clad, the requirements
for earning an award, and in standard
izing awards, the plan proposed Is
superior to our present set of rules,
and to the suggested distinctive award
system."
F. V. PRICE
Next season's basketball captain, F.
V. Price, is in favor of most of the
new system, but he thinks that some
changes could be made to improve
upon the new plan. Price believes that
tennis should* be kept a major sport.
He also is against having the award
system too iron-clad. He is in favor
of having a coach's recommendation

enough to give an "S" to a man who
! did not make his letter according to
the rules laid down.
* V. L. MARTIN
"I am all for half of the new award
| system, but all against the other half,"
was the statement made by V. L. Mar
tin, varsity boxing captain. Martin is
in favor of systematizing the rules,
but he is against reducing the awards.;
To reduce the number of "S's" would
mean J hat many would be kept out of
athletics, was the opinion of Martin,
j Martin believes that the large ma
; jority of men go out for sports merely;
; for the "S."
J. W. LAWSON
Last season's football captain is in
| favor of the new plan of athletic
awards with one exception. Lawson
believes that tennis should be a major
sport along with football, baseball,
track, and basketball.
A. E. CHARLES
"As far as I can see the award sys
|
| tem that "is to be voted on Tuesday is
I ;*> good a plan as can be made," were
' the words of A. E. Charles, president
of the Men's Council. Charles admits
that there may be a few flaws in the 1
j system, but it is as good as can be
drawn up at present.
L. E. OGDEN
Captain-elect of the tennis team, L.!
E. Ogden, points out why tennis j
should not be made a minor sport. He
1 shows where California has nationally j

> known tennis players, and will probably
> continue to have them, but he points
out that Stanford will not get her
share of these players if tennis is re
[ duced to a minor sport. Tennis is a
• sport that can be played after men
. are through college, and therefore it
. should be encouraged.
J. W. KERR
Kerr is all enthused over the new
plan. It is his opinion that the new
system is the very best that could be
arranged for Stanford.
Kerr is one of the varsity milers,
r and is a member of the class of 192C.
