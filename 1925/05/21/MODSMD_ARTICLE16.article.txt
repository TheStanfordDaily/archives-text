# Athletic Director Agrees With General Outline of Proposal
## 
### 
Coach Harry Wolter of the Cardinal
baseball nine yesterday expressed his
opinion of the recent agitation for reform
in the athletic awards.
Though Wolter favors liberal distri
bution of awards he believes in trying
the system of designating awards in va
rious sports on those lines of athletic
endeavor now rewarded with the second
class circle "S". Thus fencers would re
ceive a minor sport insignia with "FST"
or crossed foils as the design of the
award.
Coach Wolter believed that the matter
was one for the students to decide and
that whatever system is adopted should
'be popular with the student body at large.
It was Wolter's influence that made the
requirements for a block "S" for pitchers \
to be three innings in the Stanford-Cali- i
fornia series under the proposed system.
C. M. Sprague, assistant director of !
intramural sports, is in favor of the sug- j
gested changes. Though he said he be
lieved that things were going along al
right before the new plan was proposed.
Sprague endorses the idea of four
major and four minor sports and thinks
that those chosen were corrcct. He fa
vors a restrictive and conservative policy
in the making of awards so that there
can be no danger of cheapening the "S".
The medal plan for the "auxiliary"
sports, cross country, fencing, weight,
basketball, wrestling, golf, gym, and
handball, receives Sprague's support as
does any proposition which will elevate
the status of the circle block "S".
"Yet," added Sprague, "I do not think
that too many awards are being made
under the present system."
Harry Maloney, associate director of
Encina gymnasium, in regards to the
second class minor sports says: "I feel
that as far as awards are concerned these
sports will not under the new plan re
ceive just recognition. A gold medal is
after all but a medal just as a sweater
or say a snake "S" is; simply an athletic
recognition of services rendered. Still
the sweater or "S" is symbolic of Stan
ford athletics. I feel then that the aux
iliary sports should be given an award in
keeping with the sport, such as to be in
the nature of a sweater, snake "S", letter
or letters signifying the sport, for in
stance "CCT" signifying cross country
team, even if the Executive Committee
only allow, as in the past, all men entitled
to an award for participation in a second
class minor sport permission to wear a
letter or letters in keeping with the sport.
I feel that the athlete would be more
than willisg to purchase his own sweater.
"As a member of the committee on
awards I voted for the medals as I felt
that such was the better of two evils,
namely, the cutting off of second class
minor awards from tne jurisdiction of
the student body proper and placing
such sports under the auspices of the
gymnasium, or calling such sports aux
iliary sports, the award for participation
in such being a medal and not anything
pertaining to an "S", snake "S" or other
wise."

that as far as awards are concerned these
sports will not under the new plan re
ceive just recognition. A gold medal is
after all but a medal just as a sweater
or say a snake "S" is; simply an athletic
recognition of services rendered. Still
the sweater or "S" is symbolic of Stan
ford athletics. I feel then that the aux
iliary sports should be given an award in
keeping with the sport, such as to be in
the nature of a sweater, snake "S", letter
or letters signifying the sport, for in
stance "CCT" signifying cross country
team, even if the Executive Committee
only allow, as in the past, all men entitled
to an award for participation in a second
class minor sport permission to wear a
letter or letters in keeping with the sport.
I feel that the athlete would be more
than willisg to purchase his own sweater.
"As a member of the committee on
awards I voted for the medals as I felt
that such was the better of two evils,
namely, the cutting off of second class
minor awards from tne jurisdiction of
the student body proper and placing
such sports under the auspices of the
gymnasium, or calling such sports aux
iliary sports, the award for participation
in such being a medal and not anything
pertaining to an "S", snake "S" or other
wise."
Coach Harry Wolter of the Cardinal
baseball nine yesterday expressed his
opinion of the recent agitation for reform
in the athletic awards.
Though Wolter favors liberal distri
bution of awards he believes in trying
the system of designating awards in va
rious sports on those lines of athletic
endeavor now rewarded with the second
class circle "S". Thus fencers would re
ceive a minor sport insignia with "FST"
or crossed foils as the design of the
award.
Coach Wolter believed that the matter
was one for the students to decide and
that whatever system is adopted should
'be popular with the student body at large.
It was Wolter's influence that made the
requirements for a block "S" for pitchers \
to be three innings in the Stanford-Cali- i
fornia series under the proposed system.
C. M. Sprague, assistant director of !
intramural sports, is in favor of the sug- j
gested changes. Though he said he be
lieved that things were going along al
right before the new plan was proposed.
Sprague endorses the idea of four
major and four minor sports and thinks
that those chosen were corrcct. He fa
vors a restrictive and conservative policy
in the making of awards so that there
can be no danger of cheapening the "S".
The medal plan for the "auxiliary"
sports, cross country, fencing, weight,
basketball, wrestling, golf, gym, and
handball, receives Sprague's support as
does any proposition which will elevate
the status of the circle block "S".
"Yet," added Sprague, "I do not think
that too many awards are being made
under the present system."
Harry Maloney, associate director of
Encina gymnasium, in regards to the
second class minor sports says: "I feel
