Nobody is quite sure about the Liberal Party and what it is supposed
to represent. It has announced principles and presented candidates, but
the idea behind these operations is still vague in the minds of many stu
dents. In order that these Liberals may have as fair a chance as possible,
those who doubt the sincerity of the organizers should attend the open
meeting in the Women's Clubhouse tonight.
What the party is trying to accomplish is the democratic leveling of
living group differences. It is inviting no encouragement from organiza
tions, but only from individuals. It announces that it has selected its can
didates on the basis of their abilities, not on the basis of their social af
filiations.
The party idea is a good one. Whether or not one favors the purpose
of a certain party, the advantages of a two-party system are obvious.
There is a permanent organization to the party which is responsible. If
the group does not do well it can be attacked. When unorganized officers
fumble the job, the men behind them, the persons responsible for their
election, cannot be restrained.
So far the organization of only one party has been announced. It is
rumored that the opposition host is gathering to do battle. Next to the
formation of the first party, the organizing of the second group is the
most desirable thing which could happen. A spirited rivalry between these
two parties will keep each alive and, what is more important, will keep the
Hall-Row unpleasantness dead.
