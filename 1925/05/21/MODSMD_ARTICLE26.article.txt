It often occurs that when a team finishes a season, whether it has won
or lost, there are a lot of critics who are not entirely satisfied. The im
portant thing about their dissatisfaction is that they often go so far as to
say, "I could have done better myself."
Now, take the boxing team f'rinstance. While it cannot be denied that
the boxers have fought to victories, some of their opponents still live.
This may or may not be taken as a sound basis for criticism. It is un
doubtedly a downright shame, in any case.
Did somebody say, "I could have done better than that guy, myself!"
If he did, there is only one course open to him. Try it! Harry Maloney
is putting on a three-ring circus tomorrow night and there is still room
for a willing scrapper to fight for the University Championship in his
weight.
Attractive gold medals are being offered to the winners of each divis
ion and, besides, smaller gold medals are to be awarded the runners-up in
each event. It is worth while, win or lose, if you get to the fi'nals.
We would like to see a large entry list so that this supremacy matter
could be settled once and for all.
