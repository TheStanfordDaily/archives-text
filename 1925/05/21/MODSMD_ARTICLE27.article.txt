# LIBRARY EXHIBITION SHOWS FACSIMILES OF FAMOUS BIBLES
## 
### Hulda Hoover 
Commemorating the four hundredth
anniversary of the publication of the
Tyndale bible there is a Tyndale ex
hibit in the showcases at the head of
the stair 3 in the library. The upper
part of the left hand showcase holds
pictures and books showing the politi
cal background of the times so far
as they influenced the work of Tyn
dale. Â«
In the lower half of the case there
are facsimiles of the bibles of Erasmus,
Luther, and Tyndale. Both Erasmus
and Luther exerted a great influence
in the life of Tyndale. It was through
the work of Erasmus that Tyndale be
came interested in Greek, and his
translation of the New Testament was
the foundation of Tyndale's work. The
translation of Martin Luther was also
used.
When Tyndale's Vork was completed
it became very popular, but the Pope
objected to the translation and most
of the copies were burned. Only one
complete copy remains. This is in the
possession of Bristol, England. Tyn
dale was forced to leave the country
and lived for a time in Antwerp. His
hiding place was finally betrayed and
he was burned as a heretic.
In the right hand case are facsimiles
of other famous bibles. These are re
markable for the beauty of their bind

ings and illuminated text. The famous
Alba bible is here on exhibit. This was
a recent gift of the Duke of Alba who
visited the campus a short time ago.
Junior week-end at the University of
Oregon is to be featured by an elaborate
canoc fete. An extensive lighting system
is to be used which will be beneath the
water, while a number of powerful col
ored spotlights will play upon the floats.
The thirty-third meeting of the Kansas
Editorial Association was held in Topeka
last week.
