"THE CHARMER"—VARSITY
When we left the show last night,
we felt like throwing our hats in the !
aiy and raising a loud cheer —the vil-1
lain didn't attack the hero when virtue j
finally triumphed. Of course, the vil
lain still wore a moustache in the usual
movie fashion, but improvement couid
be seen.
The play itself was not so much, a
mere excuse to* Pola Negri to fulfill
her contract, but that fact was lost in
the ruck. But this Pola is not so bad,
and we should like to see her some
day in a movie which had really .good
possibilities.
But we really could not see why
everybody went wild in the specialty
number by "The Charmer," Mariposa,
a find from the wilds of Spain. It just
didn't seem possible. As usual, the j
villain was a rich young loafer and j
the hero, poor but honest, and as it i
happened, the r. y. l's chauffeur, Rob
ert Frazer, was not quite so good as
the hero chap.
"The Grand Duchess and the Floor- '
Waiter"—Columbia.
With Elsie Ferguson as the star, a
comedy so charming and original can- j
not but be a success, in spite of cer- j
tain limitations in Miss Ferguson's act-!
ing. Beautiful, and as perfectly gowned
as ever, she is prevented from making
the most of her part by over-acting,
due either to the influence of the j
movies, or her own unfamiliarity with
the part.
The comedy, written by Alfred Sa
voir and directed by Henry Miller, pre
sents a delightfully trivial bit of auda
city, wherein the situation—a waiter
in love with a duchess—is aided and
abetted by somewhat risque, but en
tirely aimiable dialogue. Basil Rath
bone, as the waiter who wasn't a !
waiter, but what was far worse in the |
eyes of the aristocratic duchess, a son
of liberty, uses just the amount of
burlesque necessary to keep the play
from becoming a farce.
Life in Russia not being too attrac
tive for the aristocrats, the Grand
Duchess and her cortege, including |
Alison Skipworth as the Countess Ava- !
loff, Leonard Mudie as the Grand Duke I
Peter, stay at. the Palace in
Montreux, Switzerland, whence the
pouring of melted butter down the
back of the Grand Duchess by the |
waiter starts the train of events which '
such a catastrophe would naturally;
precipitate.
Russian dancing, including a skillful i
specialty act by Burt Harger, a Stan-1
ford student, saVes the otherwise su
perfluous third act from utter ruin.
Harger's strut alone makes the rest of
the act bearable. The author appar
ently had an idea which he forced him
self to carry out, regardless of the fact
that his waiter had run away with the
show in the second act, and should
have been allowed to continue to do so,
even if it had necessitated doing away
with Miss Ferguson's wonderful red
boots.
This is the first appearance of the
play in America; if it can live on a
diet of dialogue, spicily seasoned, it
may live to get to New York—l. S. i
