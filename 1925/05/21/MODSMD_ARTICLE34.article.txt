# PROFESSOR DANFORTH FINDS NEW SPECIES
## 
### 
A new worxjer of Nature has been dis
covered by Professor Charles 11. Dan
forth ot the Stanford Anatomy Depart
ment. A 1 <>i:t a year ago Professor Dan
forth came across a six-legged mouse by
accident. C< mmunications with leading
scientists have led him to believe that
this variation has not been brought under
scientific notice before.
The front legs of this animal were
normal, but there were four legs in the
hind region. Professor Dariforth has
been breeding this variation with closely
related species for over a year, and has
obtained some very interesting results.
It was found that although many of the
animals had six limbs in the earliest
stages of development, in none of them
had there been enough room for the four
hind legs to grow to full size. Conse
quently the living animals showed un
developed useless limbs, and in many
cases the growth was so inhibited that
only three hind legs were visible at all,
while a few luckless individuals hopped
about on only three legs all together.
A large number of the. offspring turned
out to be perfectly normal four-legged
mice.
