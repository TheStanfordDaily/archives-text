# University's Hay Crop Ruined by Recent Rain
## 
### 
The University's hay crop was com
pletely ruined by the recent rain. The
crop, which is harvested by Sam Mc-
Donald under contract, is usually sold
by the University.
Comptroller Roth says that this loss
is made up by an unusually heavy crop
of grain in Jordan field, back of the
Museum. This crop was not planted
until late, and little was expected from
it, but it developed just at the right
time to get the full benefit of his rain.
