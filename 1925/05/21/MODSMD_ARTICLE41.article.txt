# E. M. Brandsten Plans Diving Course During Summer Session
## 
### Herbert Klein 
The summer coaching school will have
a course in instruction of diving given by
Ernst Brandsten, well known coach of
water sports and the greatest authority
on diving in the country. He was*selected
to go to the Olympic Games at Paris
last year as coach of America's divers.
Brandsten has himself been a diver of
note and held several championships in
Sweden, his birthplace. In 1909 he won
the Swedish National plain diving title
and was second in international diving
competition held at Helsingfors, Finland.
In 1912 he was national champion of
Finland in both the fancy high and
springboard diving events. At that time
he defeated Johanssen, who later won
the fancy high diving at the 1912 Olym
piad. Brandsten again defeated Johans
sen in competition after the Olympic
Games were over. Mrs. Brandsten was
one of the foremost among women
divers, winning the Olympic champion
ship in 1912.
Learned Diving at Stockholm
Brandsten learned swimming and div
ing at the Stockholm Municipal Baths,
where instruction was given to large
numbers. Those that showed promise
were advanced to receive more individual
attention. 1 he Municipal Baths gave the
teaching and training that in America is
done by high school and college coach
ing. Brandsten was a capable swimmer
t as well as diver. He specialized in the
.breast stroke, and was among the first

to successfully swim the Golden Gate
when he came to America.
Brandsten visited America in 1903 and
1907, finally coming to remain in 1909.
He coached swimming and diving for
several years at the University of Cali
fornia before coming to Stanford in 1916.
Produces Winning Teams
To understand what he has been able
to do for swimming and diving at Stan
ford it is only necessary to compare con
ditions before 1916 with those at present.
At that time even the most optimistic
could scarcely claim that Stanford had
anything even approaching a team, in
fact, there were no meets with California
because of insufficient competition at this
end. Under Brandsten's coaching Cardi
nal swimming and water polo teams
began to meet those of California with
increasing success. After a few defeats
they began to be victorious and it has
been become almost a tradition that the
California-Stanford aquatic meet results
in a Cardinal victory.

Students at the University of Colorado
are holding a beard growing contest, the
winners in the different style classes to
receive handsome prizes.
The summer coaching school will have
a course in instruction of diving given by
Ernst Brandsten, well known coach of
water sports and the greatest authority
on diving in the country. He was*selected
to go to the Olympic Games at Paris
last year as coach of America's divers.
Brandsten has himself been a diver of
note and held several championships in
Sweden, his birthplace. In 1909 he won
the Swedish National plain diving title
and was second in international diving
competition held at Helsingfors, Finland.
In 1912 he was national champion of
Finland in both the fancy high and
springboard diving events. At that time
he defeated Johanssen, who later won
the fancy high diving at the 1912 Olym
piad. Brandsten again defeated Johans
sen in competition after the Olympic
Games were over. Mrs. Brandsten was
one of the foremost among women
divers, winning the Olympic champion
ship in 1912.
Learned Diving at Stockholm
Brandsten learned swimming and div
ing at the Stockholm Municipal Baths,
where instruction was given to large
numbers. Those that showed promise
were advanced to receive more individual
attention. 1 he Municipal Baths gave the
teaching and training that in America is
done by high school and college coach
ing. Brandsten was a capable swimmer
t as well as diver. He specialized in the
.breast stroke, and was among the first

to successfully swim the Golden Gate
when he came to America.
Brandsten visited America in 1903 and
1907, finally coming to remain in 1909.
He coached swimming and diving for
several years at the University of Cali
fornia before coming to Stanford in 1916.
Produces Winning Teams
To understand what he has been able
to do for swimming and diving at Stan
ford it is only necessary to compare con
ditions before 1916 with those at present.
At that time even the most optimistic
could scarcely claim that Stanford had
anything even approaching a team, in
fact, there were no meets with California
because of insufficient competition at this
end. Under Brandsten's coaching Cardi
nal swimming and water polo teams
began to meet those of California with
increasing success. After a few defeats
they began to be victorious and it has
been become almost a tradition that the
California-Stanford aquatic meet results
in a Cardinal victory.
