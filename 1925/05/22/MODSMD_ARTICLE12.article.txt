## 
### Dudley Ross 
PRELIMINARY bouts in the lightweight, welterweight, and middleweight;
divisions yesterday afternoon eliminated all but the semi-finalists in each
weight of Harry Maloney's championship boxing tournament to be held in the;
pavilion tonight at 8 o'clock. The University fencing title will also be at stake.
As a result of the eliminations twelve bouts will be fought tonight. In the
heavyweight division there are only two entrants, James Arthur and Floyd
Tull, who have developed greatly during the year. Arthur boxed this winter
in the first meet with the Davis Farm Aggies.
In the preliminaries A. T. Ross defeated G. if. Offerman in the lightweight
class after a hard bout which went an extra round when the judges, Myron
Schall and J. C. Irwin, were unable to agree. Due to the withdrawal of C. L. j

'Freedman from the tournament, how-,
ever, Offerman will probably box in !
the semi-finals tonight.
In the best fight of the afternoon
A. E. Heston eliminated L. L. Sullivan !
from the middleweight class by a close
margin. Heston's cleverness, combined
with hitting ability, won him the deci
sion after an extra round of hard fight-!
ing. D. F. Foster, middleweight, "won
the decision over F. P. Isensee while j
J. E. Raaf will enter the semi-finals of j
the welterweight through his victory!
over A. P. Hahn. Neither man was j
able to hit the other at all consistently, j
All the varsity men with the excep
tion of M. C. Collins, bantamweight,
and G. D. Feely, lightweight, are en
tered in the championships. Feely in
tended to fight tonight, but a slight
attack of a cold early in the week
caused his withdrawal from the tourna
ment.
The varsity fighters should have lit
tle difficulty in gaining the champion
ships in all divisions as the outside;
entrants have not shown enough abil- ]
ity to approach them. N. W. Fain, I
freshman light-heavyweight, has shown
good form in practice, but as yet he
wilT not be able to give Rollin Farmin
a close battle.
Harry Maloney has secured Harry
Smith, sporting editor of the San Fran
cisco Chronicle, to present the medals'
to the champions and runners-up fol
lowing the bouts. Maloney will have
direction of the entire show, while

for the fighters.

class after a hard bout which went an extra round when the judges, Myron
Schall and J. C. Irwin, were unable to agree. Due to the withdrawal of C. L. j

ever, Offerman will probably box in !
the semi-finals tonight.

from the middleweight class by a close
margin. Heston's cleverness, combined
with hitting ability, won him the deci
sion after an extra round of hard fight-!
ing. D. F. Foster, middleweight, "won
the decision over F. P. Isensee while j
J. E. Raaf will enter the semi-finals of j
the welterweight through his victory!

able to hit the other at all consistently, j

tion of M. C. Collins, bantamweight,

caused his withdrawal from the tourna
ment.

tle difficulty in gaining the champion
ships in all divisions as the outside;
entrants have not shown enough abil- ]
ity to approach them. N. W. Fain, I
freshman light-heavyweight, has shown
good form in practice, but as yet he
wilT not be able to give Rollin Farmin
a close battle.
