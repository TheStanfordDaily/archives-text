# CARD TRACKSTERS WILL ENTER N. C. A. MEET AT CHICAGO
## ANNOUNCED YESTERDAY Stanford Men to Leave for East Following P. C. C. Competition 
### 
Stanford is to be represented at the
National Collegiate Track and Field
championships at Chicago, June 12 and
13, by a six-man team.
This was decided yesterday after a
week's review of the matter by the
Board of Athletic Control co-operating
with Paul Davis, Graduate Manager,
and the Faculty Athletic Committee.
Led by Captain Hartranft, the team
will include Miller, Leistner, Work,
Richardson, Hoffman, and Coach R. L.
Templeton.
The six men and Templeton will ac
company the rest of the entries for
the Pacific Coast meet, to Seattle, and
will leave for Chicago immediately
following the northern contest, May
30.
Important Meet
Out of eight intersectional track and
field meets held yearly, the one con
ducted by the National Collegiate Ath
letic Association is considered one of
the largest and most important. Being
near the close of the track season and
not conflicting with other meets, the
N. C. A. brings together the greatest
collection of track athletes gathered
at a single collegiate meet.
No N. C. A. contest was held last
year due to the nearness of the Olym
pic tryouts. Stanford was entered the
year before, however, and finished
near the top.
Bears, U. S. C. May Enter
California and U. S. C. are also ex
pected to enter the Chicago meet fol
lowing their competition in the I. C.
A. A. A. A. on May 30. Occidental col
lege will probably enter, as will a num
ber of individual athletes from large
and small colleges throughout the
country.
Following their work at Chicago, it
is probable that the Stanford track
sters will return to San Francisco for
the National A. A. U. meet on July 4.
A heave of 47 feet 10 inches in the
shot yesterday influenced Coach Tem
pleton to include Hoffman with the
men chosen to participate in the N. C.
A. meet. As very few puts made in
eastern competition this year have
compared with Hoffman's record, the
chance for additional points in this
event are good.
