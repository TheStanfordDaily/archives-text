# POSTMASTER NEW TO BROADCAST MONDAY
## 
### 
Postmaster General New will speak
over radio WCAP from Washington,
Monday, at 9 p.m., as the first event
of a better mailing and better addres
sing campaign that is to be run all
over the United States. Moving pic
ture shows throughout the country are
co-operating with the postoffice depart
ment, and will give special pictures of
the U. S. mailing service.
The campaign is mainly against
carelessness, and a real effort will be
made during the week of June 1 to 7,
to correct some of the faults made by
the public. The Stanford postoffice is
making a special effort to eliminate
the use of nicknames in the addresses.
