It is interesting to observe the comment on the awards plan which is
made by members of the coaching staff and student-body. Each one of
them favors part of the plan and almost all disapprove of the rest. Most
amazing of all is that there is no agreement of opinion on exactly what
part of the plan is the worst.
One man says he likes most of the plan, all, in fact, except iron-clad
rules and making tennis a minor sport. If he dislikes this, he dislikes two
thirds of the plan. All that is left is the auxiliary sport idea.
Another favors the suggestion because Skull and Snakes and the Circle
"S" Society approved of it. Too much weight should not be given such a
statement. Although the majority of the members who attended the meet
ings were favorably inclined, many others, both present and absent, de
cidedly disapprove of the proposal.
Tennis men rightly point out that a minor sport team from Stanford
competing against a major tennis team at California would become de
cidedly outclassed in a few years. Although the present players are of
high quality, future players would be dissuaded from attending an insti
tution which so slights its tennis men.
Perhaps the best discussion of the plan is to be found in the opinions
of Coach Harry Maloney. His complete statement, which appeared yes
terday somewhat abridged, follows:
I was told that the purpose of appointing a committee on awards was in
the main due to the desire on the part of the Executive Committee to re-stand
ardize the award system. Furthermore, the Executive Committee together
with others felt that there were too many, or at least too large a variety of
sweaters. With this before them the members of the committee on awards
went about trying to fulfill the desires of those responsible for the committee
above mentioned coming into existence. After several long sessions the plan
as outlined in the Daily Palo Alto was formulated. As to the merits of the
plan submitted, I feel as a member of the committee that at least some con
structive work was done, that is as far as both major and first-class minor
sports ard concerned, both from the standpoint of standardization and uni
formity of awards, as such relate to these particular sports.
Relative to the so-called second class minor sports, which according to the
new plan are to be known as auxiliary sports, I feel that as far as awards are
concerned these sports will not under the plan submitted receive just recog
nition. A gold medal is after all but a medal just as a sweater or say a snake
"S" is simply an athletic recognition of services rendered. Still the sweater
or "S" form of award is symbolic of Standard athletics. I feel then that the
auxiliary sports should be given an award in keeping with the sport, such to
be in the nature of a sweater, snake "S," letter or letters signifying the sport,
for instance, "CCT" signifying cross-country team; even if the Executive
Committee only allow, as in the past, all men entitled to an award for par
ticipation in a second class minor sport permission to wear a letter or letters
in keeping with the sport, I feel that the athlete would be more than willing
to purchase his own sweater.
As a member of the committee on awards I voted for the medals as I felt
such was the better of two evils, namely, the cutting off of second class
minor sports from the jurisdiction of the student body proper and placing
such sports under the auspices of the gymnasium, or calling such sports
auxiliary sports, the award for participation in such being a medal and not
anything pertaining to an "S," snake "S" or otherwise.
The plan has constructive points. The definite provisions for win
ning a letter are highly desirable. The division of sports is even more
undesirable.
There is no doubt that the constructive parts of the suggestion should
be kept in mind when an acceptable plan is being drawn up. It is our
contention, however, that the undesirable'parts of the new awards scheme
would never be incorporated in the constitution. The plan should be re
vised before it is passed, not afterwards.
Defeat the plan at this election and revamp it! That is the sensible
course. It is not entirely satisfactory. Remedy the weakness and accept
it. But until the injustices are corrected, the plan should be disapproved.
THE PARTY IDEA IS ATTACKED on the ground that it cannot
have anv opposition, since it expresses principles favored by all. The
benefits of the party plan are to be found in the permanence of its organi
zation.
There is room for a permanent opposition coalition. The party is the
men in it.
