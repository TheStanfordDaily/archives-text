# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
According to your editorial in last
night's paper, the latest idea is to
have competition between two parties
in student body elections. One party
is to be your Liberal Party, and the
other, I suppose, would be in opposi
tion to it. The aims and ideals of the
Liberal Party can hardly be im
peached ; they sound all right, and are
apparently altruistic. But what, pray,
could another "party" advocate? We
have no questions of party or legis
lative policies to wrangle about here
on the campus. If the students were
to express opinions on such questions
as prohibition, reduction of income
tax, protective tariff, or oil leases,
your suggestion might have some
merit. But they don't. And any party
organized on this campus would neces
sarily subscribe to the same lofty
opinions as the Liberal Party ex
presses.
I think it would be a good idea if we
would forget about this "party" busi
ness, and consider those running for
office solely from the point of view of
personal qualifications. Students aren't
going to be interested in what party
a candidate belongs to; they are going
to be interested in the candidate him
self. Take the president of the student
body, for instance: we consider what
candidate will be better capable of
representing the students of this Uni
versity, of being their spokesman. A
group of students got together and
formed a party, then selected the can
didates, and now talk of formulating
a platform.. Call it anything you want,
it merely was a caucus. Another group
of students held a caucus, and also se
lected candidates, but didn't see the
necessity or desirability of creating a
party. Two caucuses, two sets of can
didates; there is nothing new in that.
But it does seem putting it on pretty
thick for those backing the Liberal
ticket to try to get a corner on all the
altruism and brotherly feeling extant,
claiming their candidates as the true
representatives of those holding the
same or similar ideas, and then to
invite opposition through the editorial
columns of the Daily Palo Alto.

The Editor, Sir:
This is written to give you a wo
man's viewpoint; however, in it I do
not claim to represent the opinion of
the "500."
I am very much opposed to the new
award system, as suggested. Awards
are supposed to be granted for the
athletic merit of the individual when
it is expended in the service of the
University. The champion tennis player
whose championship lies in self-devel
oped skill is just as much a hero as
the machine-like football player, whose
glory so often belongs to his coach.
It's the service that counts, and each
man in his own sports gives as much.
Tennis is now recognized by the
world. Consider the list of world-fam
ous players. Bill Tilden, Bill Johnston,
Kinsey brothers, Vincent Richards,
and Helen Wills and Suzanne Lenglen
are just a few at the top. If we put
tennis among our minor sports, do
you think we will continue to draw
men like Jim Davies, Phil Neer, Cran
ston Holman, and Alan Herrington?
I think not. Thye will go to the Uni
versity of California.
It is the gym department's boast that
it has a 90 per cent enrollment. This
is a splendid record because it means
good health for the student body. Most
of these men are out to earn sweaters.
It stands to reason that if the most
a man can show after four years of
unselfish work —hard work—is a medal
to be treasured along with his high
school diploma in mother's top bureau
drawer, he, if he is the average man,
will look ahead first, and then will
direct his energies to some other place
than the Stanford gymnasium.
I realize there is a problem in the
possibility of giving out too many
awards. We have met it in the Wo
men's Athletic Association. Our sys
tem is somewhat complicated. Our
sweaters are agarded on the point
basis, 1000 points being necessary to
win a sweater, and beginning with
next year in all probability the addi
tional requirements of scholarship,
service to the University, and general
personal carriage. However, our ob
jection to awarding Sweaters too free
ly lies in the possibility of some of the
winners being unworthy of wearing

the symbol of the University, and not
by any means for financial reasons.
I approve thoroughly of making
sweaters more difficult to win, thus
assuring the student body that their
representatives will be deserving. I
am as firmly convinced that the man
who spends the same amount of time
in a less popular sport is entitled to
recognition in the form of an equal
award with the man who competes in
sports with a bigger box-office appeal.
Let the Board of Athletic Control
make up its debt in a larger and more
worthy way. —Jean Ward.

It's the service that counts, and each
man in his own sports gives as much.
Tennis is now recognized by the
world. Consider the list of world-fam
ous players. Bill Tilden, Bill Johnston,
Kinsey brothers, Vincent Richards,
and Helen Wills and Suzanne Lenglen
are just a few at the top. If we put
tennis among our minor sports, do
you think we will continue to draw
men like Jim Davies, Phil Neer, Cran
ston Holman, and Alan Herrington?
I think not. Thye will go to the Uni
versity of California.
It is the gym department's boast that
it has a 90 per cent enrollment. This
is a splendid record because it means
good health for the student body. Most
of these men are out to earn sweaters.
It stands to reason that if the most
a man can show after four years of
unselfish work —hard work—is a medal
to be treasured along with his high
school diploma in mother's top bureau
drawer, he, if he is the average man,
will look ahead first, and then will
direct his energies to some other place
than the Stanford gymnasium.
I realize there is a problem in the
possibility of giving out too many
awards. We have met it in the Wo
men's Athletic Association. Our sys
tem is somewhat complicated. Our
sweaters are agarded on the point
basis, 1000 points being necessary to
win a sweater, and beginning with
next year in all probability the addi
tional requirements of scholarship,
service to the University, and general
personal carriage. However, our ob
jection to awarding Sweaters too free
ly lies in the possibility of some of the
winners being unworthy of wearing

the symbol of the University, and not
by any means for financial reasons.
I approve thoroughly of making
sweaters more difficult to win, thus
assuring the student body that their
representatives will be deserving. I
am as firmly convinced that the man
who spends the same amount of time
in a less popular sport is entitled to
recognition in the form of an equal
award with the man who competes in
sports with a bigger box-office appeal.
Let the Board of Athletic Control
make up its debt in a larger and more

The Editor, Sir:
According to your editorial in last
night's paper, the latest idea is to
have competition between two parties
in student body elections. One party
is to be your Liberal Party, and the
other, I suppose, would be in opposi
tion to it. The aims and ideals of the
Liberal Party can hardly be im
peached ; they sound all right, and are
apparently altruistic. But what, pray,
could another "party" advocate? We
have no questions of party or legis
lative policies to wrangle about here
on the campus. If the students were
to express opinions on such questions
as prohibition, reduction of income
tax, protective tariff, or oil leases,
your suggestion might have some
merit. But they don't. And any party
organized on this campus would neces
sarily subscribe to the same lofty
opinions as the Liberal Party ex
presses.
I think it would be a good idea if we
would forget about this "party" busi
ness, and consider those running for
office solely from the point of view of
personal qualifications. Students aren't
going to be interested in what party
a candidate belongs to; they are going
to be interested in the candidate him
self. Take the president of the student
body, for instance: we consider what
candidate will be better capable of
representing the students of this Uni
versity, of being their spokesman. A
group of students got together and
formed a party, then selected the can
didates, and now talk of formulating
a platform.. Call it anything you want,
it merely was a caucus. Another group
of students held a caucus, and also se
lected candidates, but didn't see the
necessity or desirability of creating a
party. Two caucuses, two sets of can
didates; there is nothing new in that.
But it does seem putting it on pretty
thick for those backing the Liberal
ticket to try to get a corner on all the
altruism and brotherly feeling extant,
claiming their candidates as the true
representatives of those holding the
same or similar ideas, and then to
invite opposition through the editorial
columns of the Daily Palo Alto.

have no questions of party or legis
lative policies to wrangle about here
on the campus. If the students were
to express opinions on such questions
as prohibition, reduction of income
tax, protective tariff, or oil leases,
your suggestion might have some
merit. But they don't. And any party
organized on this campus would neces
sarily subscribe to the same lofty
opinions as the Liberal Party ex
presses.
I think it would be a good idea if we
would forget about this "party" busi
ness, and consider those running for
office solely from the point of view of
personal qualifications. Students aren't
going to be interested in what party
a candidate belongs to; they are going
to be interested in the candidate him
self. Take the president of the student
body, for instance: we consider what
candidate will be better capable of
representing the students of this Uni
versity, of being their spokesman. A
group of students got together and
formed a party, then selected the can
didates, and now talk of formulating
a platform.. Call it anything you want,
it merely was a caucus. Another group
of students held a caucus, and also se
lected candidates, but didn't see the
necessity or desirability of creating a
party. Two caucuses, two sets of can
didates; there is nothing new in that.
But it does seem putting it on pretty
thick for those backing the Liberal
ticket to try to get a corner on all the
altruism and brotherly feeling extant,
claiming their candidates as the true
representatives of those holding the
same or similar ideas, and then to
invite opposition through the editorial
columns of the Daily Palo Alto.

The Editor, Sir:
This is written to give you a wo
man's viewpoint; however, in it I do
not claim to represent the opinion of
the "500."
I am very much opposed to the new
award system, as suggested. Awards
are supposed to be granted for the
athletic merit of the individual when
it is expended in the service of the
University. The champion tennis player
whose championship lies in self-devel
oped skill is just as much a hero as
the machine-like football player, whose
glory so often belongs to his coach.
It's the service that counts, and each
man in his own sports gives as much.
Tennis is now recognized by the
world. Consider the list of world-fam
ous players. Bill Tilden, Bill Johnston,
Kinsey brothers, Vincent Richards,
and Helen Wills and Suzanne Lenglen
are just a few at the top. If we put
tennis among our minor sports, do
you think we will continue to draw
men like Jim Davies, Phil Neer, Cran
ston Holman, and Alan Herrington?
I think not. Thye will go to the Uni
versity of California.
It is the gym department's boast that
it has a 90 per cent enrollment. This
is a splendid record because it means
good health for the student body. Most
of these men are out to earn sweaters.
It stands to reason that if the most
a man can show after four years of
unselfish work —hard work—is a medal
to be treasured along with his high
school diploma in mother's top bureau
drawer, he, if he is the average man,
will look ahead first, and then will
direct his energies to some other place
than the Stanford gymnasium.
I realize there is a problem in the
possibility of giving out too many
awards. We have met it in the Wo
men's Athletic Association. Our sys
tem is somewhat complicated. Our
sweaters are agarded on the point
basis, 1000 points being necessary to
win a sweater, and beginning with
next year in all probability the addi
tional requirements of scholarship,
service to the University, and general
personal carriage. However, our ob
jection to awarding Sweaters too free
ly lies in the possibility of some of the
winners being unworthy of wearing

the symbol of the University, and not
by any means for financial reasons.
I approve thoroughly of making
sweaters more difficult to win, thus
assuring the student body that their
representatives will be deserving. I
am as firmly convinced that the man
who spends the same amount of time
in a less popular sport is entitled to
recognition in the form of an equal
award with the man who competes in
sports with a bigger box-office appeal.
Let the Board of Athletic Control
make up its debt in a larger and more
worthy way. —Jean Ward.
The Editor, Sir:
According to your editorial in last
night's paper, the latest idea is to
have competition between two parties
in student body elections. One party
is to be your Liberal Party, and the
other, I suppose, would be in opposi
tion to it. The aims and ideals of the
Liberal Party can hardly be im
peached ; they sound all right, and are
apparently altruistic. But what, pray,
could another "party" advocate? We
have no questions of party or legis
lative policies to wrangle about here
on the campus. If the students were
to express opinions on such questions
as prohibition, reduction of income
tax, protective tariff, or oil leases,
your suggestion might have some
merit. But they don't. And any party
organized on this campus would neces
sarily subscribe to the same lofty
