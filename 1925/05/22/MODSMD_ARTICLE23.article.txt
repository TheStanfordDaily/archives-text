# AWARDS COMMITTEE GIVES REASONS FOR PROPOSED CHANGES
## 
### Harry Noland 
(Secretary Awards Committee)
Since considerable comment, both
pro and con, has arisen following the
approval by the Executive Committee
of the work done by the Awards Com
mittee in revising the present plan of
athletic awards, the following explana
tion is offered in order that the stu
dent body can clearly understand the
motives which prompted the commit
tee in its decision.
Pirst, the proposed system is not an
effort on the part of the University to
nave money. Instead, the costs of the
auxiliary sports medals and sweaters
will greatly exceed that of the sweater
awards as now granted. The commit
tee in adopting the plan looked more
lo fairness than to cost.
Coaches Consulted
In changing the number of major
;tnd minor sports every athletic coach
was consulted, and in most cases
where drastic changes were made the
coach of that particular sport favored
them. For changing tennis to a minor
sport the following fact was material:
At present the captain of the tennis
team has no award of any kind for his
services. Under the new system he
would already have two sweaters and
a medal. The new rule allows him to
obtain a letter for participation against
California, and does not make victory
an essential element.
The committee feels that the chief
advantage of the new system is its
uniformity. Definite requirements are
laid down in each sport, and a man
Will never be in doubt as to whether
he has made a letter. In some sports
it is made harder to earn a letter and
in certain cases easier. In football,
under the new plan, one needs play
in the California game for only five
minutes, where before ten were re

quired. To counterbalance this it is
made harder to get a letter in con
ference games. It is also definitely
stated how letters may be obtained
in post-season games. The proposed
plan will cut out a number of "S"
awards, and so attach more prestige
to the block "S."
Harder in Track
Coach R. L. Templeton favored the
insertion of the clause making it neces
sary for a man to take first in the
conference meet to win a letter. This
eliminates the possibility of men get
ting letters in this meet through the
failure of the leading Stanford athletes
to enter.
The awards for swimming, boxing,
and soccer remain practically as they
were, except that rules are laid down
whereby men winning national cham
pionships, or placing at the Olympic
Games will be granted a Block "S."
Perhaps the most objection to the
system has come from those desiring
letter awards for what are claimed to
be classed as "Auxiliary sports." At
present this group includes cross
country, fencing, golf, weight basket
ball, wrestling, handball, and gymna
sium. Men who compete against Cali
fornia in these sports are to receive
medals. The outstanding advantage
here is that mere competition is
enough, and victory is unnecessary.
Another fact which prompted the com
mittee to make this arrangement is
that the second class or "snake" "S"
awarded at present is really unessen
tial. It is decidedly different from the
Block "S" in appearance, and carries
with it less honor than a medal would
under the circumstances.
No Polo Jurisdiction
As for horse polo, the committee
felt that it would be going out of its
jurisdiction to allow an award for that
because it is controlled by the Mili
tary department, and does not come
under the direction of the Associated
Students.
To summarize then, the benefits of
the new system are: the prestige of
the Block "S" will be increased; ten
nis players can get letters without de
feating California; a participant in the
Big Game can get a letter after five
minutes' play; more awards will be
given than at the present time; auxil
iary sports men will not have to de
feat California.
