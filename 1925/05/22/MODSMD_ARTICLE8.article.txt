# GORDON DAVIS WILL TAKE OVER SENIOR FARCE REHEARSALS
## 
### 
Rehearsals for the 1924 Senior Farce,
"Polly With a Past," which have been
progressing under the direction of
Charles Parks during the past two
weeks, will be taken over by Gordon
Davis, University dramatic coach,
when he returns from New York the
first of next week. Davis is now en
route from the eastern metropolis,
where he has spent the past two
months in reviewing the current pro
ductions and lining up plays to be
presented at Stanford next year.
"Polly With a Past" is one of the
outstanding hits of recent years and
served as a vehicle for lita Claire,
Proadway star, for several seasons. It
is a fast-moving farce with a wealth
of comedy situations.
