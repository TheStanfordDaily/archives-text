# STADIUM PLANS CALL FOR IMPROVEMENTS. ADDITION OF SEATS
## Team Rooms, Ball Diamond To Be Built—Total Cost $200,000 
### 
Carrying out of the plans announced
Friday for an increase of 10,200> seats
in the stadium began Saturday morn
ing. Dr. T, M. Williams, chairman of
the Board of Athletic Control, stated
that the enlarging of the stadium
would be completed before the Stan
ford-California football game next
November. The cost will be $200,000.
The 10,200 seats will be added on
the south end, thus completing the
bowl, and it is probable that a thou
sand box seats will be placed between
the base of the bleachers and the field,
thereby raising the total seating
capacity to approximately 71,000.
The west embankment will be ex
tended around the south end almost
to the straightaway track. A new sec
tion of seats will be continued on the
east embankment.
Two houses to accommodate forty
men each will be placed near the
straightaway track and six rest rooms
will be built at points near the sta
dium.
Dirt for the south banks of seats
will be taken from a plot of ground
430 square feet from a depth of six
feet. A sunken baseball diamond will
be constructed from the excavation
near the present south entrance of the
stadium.
The drainage system of this sunken
diamond will compare with that of
the football field which has been very
satisfactory. Bleachers with outside
ground level entrances will be built
part way around the diamond.
Relandscaping of the banks and the
addition of a fifteen-foot border around
the stadium are included in the plans.
A shifting of the road to the north
from the stadium will be made.
Palmer and Mcßride, who construct
ed the present stadium at a cost of
$240,000', will handle the improvement
work, and Shirley Baker is the engi
neer in charge. The contract calls for
the completion of all the work before
November 21, the date of the Big
Game.
Plans considered by the board of
control in January called for 30,000
seats which together with certain im
provements would have cost approxi
mately half a million dollars. The
board did not favor the assumption of
such a debt, and decided upon the
present plan.

Friday for an increase of 10,200> seats
in the stadium began Saturday morn
ing. Dr. T, M. Williams, chairman of
the Board of Athletic Control, stated
that the enlarging of the stadium
would be completed before the Stan
ford-California football game next
November. The cost will be $200,000.
The 10,200 seats will be added on
the south end, thus completing the
bowl, and it is probable that a thou
sand box seats will be placed between
the base of the bleachers and the field,
thereby raising the total seating
capacity to approximately 71,000.
The west embankment will be ex
tended around the south end almost
to the straightaway track. A new sec
tion of seats will be continued on the
east embankment.
Two houses to accommodate forty
men each will be placed near the
straightaway track and six rest rooms
will be built at points near the sta
dium.
Dirt for the south banks of seats
will be taken from a plot of ground
430 square feet from a depth of six
feet. A sunken baseball diamond will
be constructed from the excavation
near the present south entrance of the
stadium.
The drainage system of this sunken
diamond will compare with that of
the football field which has been very
satisfactory. Bleachers with outside
ground level entrances will be built
part way around the diamond.
Relandscaping of the banks and the
addition of a fifteen-foot border around
the stadium are included in the plans.
A shifting of the road to the north
from the stadium will be made.
Palmer and Mcßride, who construct
ed the present stadium at a cost of
$240,000', will handle the improvement
work, and Shirley Baker is the engi
neer in charge. The contract calls for
the completion of all the work before
November 21, the date of the Big
Game.
Plans considered by the board of
control in January called for 30,000
seats which together with certain im
provements would have cost approxi
mately half a million dollars. The
board did not favor the assumption of
such a debt, and decided upon the
present plan.
