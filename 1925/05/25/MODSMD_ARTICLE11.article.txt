Charles Papc, tlic world's greatest liv
ing artist, is on the Stanford campus.
He has made portraits of practically
every college man and woman in the
east, not to mention countless numbers
of Kings, Queens, moving picture actors
and actresses and milionaires that he has
drawn. He is "the man with the golden
hand," he says.
The artist has toured through Asia,
Europe, and Africa where he was lion- i
' ored by the nobility of the various coun
j tries. While in Asia, the King of China
I crawled three miles in the mud through
a tunnel to get Pape to make a drawing
of him. The Pope at Rome took eight of '
Rembrandt's and three of Michael An-
I gelo's pictures down from the wall, so as
to make room for one of Papc's master
pieces. Pape admits it.
"I concede that Rembrandt was a fair
ly good artist," said Pape, "but it took
( him six years to make a drawing that I
I can do in six minutes. And that is the
1 acid test of a genius. People did not
I find out how good Rembrandt was until
he was dead 200 years. I'm not taking
; any chances. I'm an artist, pure and
simple."
Although he admits his drawings arc
worth over $10,000, Pape is sketching the

men and women of Stanford for the
special price of $1 a sitting. This is his
first trip to the Western Universities,
and he plans to spend several years along
the coast, advertising his skill so that
when the future presidents arrive, lie
shall be in demand.
This genius was born in Chicago, and
during the twenty-five years that lie has
been drawing he has made the presidents
of twenty-two pencil companies so rich
that they have retired. He claims to have
done 200,000 portraits from life.
Pape has always been a wanderer. It
was only last year that certain wealthy
people in New York wanted to tear down
the Woolworth Building so as to make
room for a studio for Pape, but he
wouldn't stand for being cooped up, so
he roams about from one university to
another.
"I believe that an artist should train
as conscientiously as an athlete," said
Pape. "All my life I have retired early
in order to keep fit. I seldom eat meat.
My diet consists chiefly of fish, nuts,
carrots, and celery.
Pape has a diverse genius. He has also
achieved an invention, and he has paid
his $100 patent fee. It is a tin plate that
when worn in the back of the shoe will
prevent the oxford from wearing holes in
socks. Pape would finance this himself,
but he doesn't want to knock the hoops
from any of his barrels of cash.
Papc is working on another invention
which consists of a porcelain inner lining
for the shoe to prevent the poisonous
dyes from the socks entering the body.
"This porcelain will be hinged in the
middle to prevent breaking," said Pape,
"and will be absolutely sanitary."
At one time in his life, Pape was on
the stage with Ben Turpin. Pape's part
of the act consisted in some rapid-fire
sketching. "Years ago I had a fine man
sion," murmured Pape as he sketched a
prominent and handsome Stanford stu
dent, "but one day an engine backed up
and took it away."
Pape will be doing the rounds at Stan
ford until the end of the quarter, when
he will leave for Berkeley to offer ad
vantage of his genius to the students
at the summer session of the University
of California.

Pape has a diverse genius. He has also
achieved an invention, and he has paid
his $100 patent fee. It is a tin plate that
when worn in the back of the shoe will
prevent the oxford from wearing holes in
socks. Pape would finance this himself,
but he doesn't want to knock the hoops
from any of his barrels of cash.
Papc is working on another invention
which consists of a porcelain inner lining
for the shoe to prevent the poisonous
dyes from the socks entering the body.
"This porcelain will be hinged in the
middle to prevent breaking," said Pape,
"and will be absolutely sanitary."
At one time in his life, Pape was on
the stage with Ben Turpin. Pape's part
of the act consisted in some rapid-fire
sketching. "Years ago I had a fine man
sion," murmured Pape as he sketched a
prominent and handsome Stanford stu
dent, "but one day an engine backed up
and took it away."
Pape will be doing the rounds at Stan
ford until the end of the quarter, when
he will leave for Berkeley to offer ad
vantage of his genius to the students
at the summer session of the University
of California.

Charles Papc, tlic world's greatest liv
ing artist, is on the Stanford campus.
He has made portraits of practically
every college man and woman in the
east, not to mention countless numbers
of Kings, Queens, moving picture actors
and actresses and milionaires that he has
drawn. He is "the man with the golden
hand," he says.
The artist has toured through Asia,
Europe, and Africa where he was lion- i
' ored by the nobility of the various coun
j tries. While in Asia, the King of China
I crawled three miles in the mud through
a tunnel to get Pape to make a drawing
of him. The Pope at Rome took eight of '
Rembrandt's and three of Michael An-
I gelo's pictures down from the wall, so as
to make room for one of Papc's master
pieces. Pape admits it.
"I concede that Rembrandt was a fair
ly good artist," said Pape, "but it took
( him six years to make a drawing that I
I can do in six minutes. And that is the
1 acid test of a genius. People did not
I find out how good Rembrandt was until
he was dead 200 years. I'm not taking
; any chances. I'm an artist, pure and
simple."
Although he admits his drawings arc
worth over $10,000, Pape is sketching the

men and women of Stanford for the
special price of $1 a sitting. This is his
first trip to the Western Universities,
and he plans to spend several years along
the coast, advertising his skill so that
when the future presidents arrive, lie
shall be in demand.
This genius was born in Chicago, and
during the twenty-five years that lie has
been drawing he has made the presidents
of twenty-two pencil companies so rich
that they have retired. He claims to have
done 200,000 portraits from life.
Pape has always been a wanderer. It
was only last year that certain wealthy
people in New York wanted to tear down
the Woolworth Building so as to make
room for a studio for Pape, but he
wouldn't stand for being cooped up, so
he roams about from one university to
another.
"I believe that an artist should train
as conscientiously as an athlete," said
Pape. "All my life I have retired early
in order to keep fit. I seldom eat meat.
My diet consists chiefly of fish, nuts,
carrots, and celery.
