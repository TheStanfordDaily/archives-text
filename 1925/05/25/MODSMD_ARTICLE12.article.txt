# CARD TRACKMEN START NORTHERN TRIP TOMORROW
## 
### Douglas Meservey 
Fourteen men, with Coach It. L.
Templeton, will leave at 8 o'clock to
morrow night from San Francisco for
Seattle where they are to compete
Saturday in the Pacific Coast Confer
ence track meet.
The men making the trip are; Gas
par, Leistner, Dole, Storie, Miller,
Richardson, Smith, Kerr, Hartranft,
Hoffman, Evers, Crookshank, Macßae,
and Work.
Following the P. C. C. contest, Tem
pleton and six of the men named above
will go to Chicago to enter the Na
tional Collegiate meet on June 13.
The P. C. C. meet this year will be
the first for two seasons that the
stars of the Card track team have en
tered. Last year the second squad was
sent north while thirteen of the out
standing men were competing in the
I. C. A. A. A. A. meet at Philadelphia.
The Cards took third in the East and
tied for third in the northern contest.
With the best of his squad, Temple
ton should have better than an even
chance to annex the coast champion
ship. It is probably the strongest all
around team entered at Seattle, al
though all of the northern universities
have several men apiece who have
chalked up good records this year.
Sweet Is Star
Sweet of Montana appears to be the
outstanding sprinter of the entire con
ference this season, including the
southern members. Once he has
clipped off the hundred in 0:9 4-5 and
has been caught at even time in sev
eral meets. He was timed at 0:21 3-10
in the 220 against Washington State.
Sweet is also a high and broad-jumper
of quality, taking first in both events
in the same meet at 5 feet 7 inches
and 21 feet 2 inches respectively.
The 440 will have several good en
trants, among them being Applegate
of Washington and Ritter of Montana,
who have both made :50 in dual meets
this season. With the late starts that
both men had this season, they should
get under that marks and give Storie
and Miller of Stanford a good race.
The mile relay is a weak race in the
north, however, indicating that there
are a few good quarter-milers. A mark
of 3:29 made by Washington is the
best this year but it can be shaded
several seconds by the Card four-man
team.
