# FIFTY-FOUR NAMES ON SPRING ELECTION BALLOTS TOMORROW
## Ted Shipkey Ineligible for Vice-Presidency, Says Dean Kirkwood 
### 
Ted Shipkey was declared ineligible
as A. S. S. U. vice-presidential candi
date in the general election tomorrow
by an action yesterday of the lSlection
Board. Dean Kirkwood of the Law
School interpreted a clause in the A.
S. S. U. constitution to mean that a
candidate for the office must be an
upperclassman.
Shipkey is in his sixth quarter and
has seventy-five hours and is therefore
not an upperclassman. The Election
Board and Dean Kirkwood's action
practically give the A. S. S. U. vice
presidency to Jake Irwin, as there are
no other candidates for the office.
Two men are left in the running for
president of the student body, these
being Delmer Daves and Bob Lewis.
Bob Myers was nominated for the of*
floe but declined the nomination.
Robert Lewis is a member of the
class of 1924 majoring in law, and is
a member of El Capitan, Delta Sigma
Rlio, Delta Theta Phi, and Nestoria.
He was debating manager in his sen
ior year, and has been a varsity de
bater for four years.
Delmer JDaves is a member of the
class of *26, majoring in law, and is
a member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon,
Quadrangle Club, Sword and Sandals,
Ram's Head, and Delta Epsilon. He
has been Dramatic Manager since
January, 1923, is Art Editor of the
1926 Quad, director of this year's Jun
ior Opera, and has been prominent
in dramatics.
For the chief yell leader, the voters
will choose between the present assist
ants, Raitt Boren and "Chubby" Ty
roler.
Fifty-four names will appear on the
ballots for A. S. S. U. and class officer
positions. Five cheer leaders from
