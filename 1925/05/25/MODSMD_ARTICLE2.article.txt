# ARBIE STEWART GETS ROLE IN SENIOR PRODUCTION
## 
### 
The part of Myrtle Davis in "Polly
With a Past," the 1924 Senior farce,
will be taken by Arbie Stewart who is
replacing Rowena Mason owing to the
ilness of the latter. Rehearsals of the
play will enter their third week under
the direction of Charles Parks tomorrow.
The return of Gordon Davis is expected
during the earlier part of this week and
he may take over the supervision of the
production.
Davis has been in the east for two
months seeing the New \ork plays and
making arrangements for securing rights
to those to be presented at Stanford
during next year's dramatic season.
"Polly With a Past" enjoyed a long
run in the east. With Ina ( laire in the
leading role it ran for several seasons
and was one of the most successful
farcical comedies ever produced.
