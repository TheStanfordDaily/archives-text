# WHY CALL 'EM "MINOR" SPORTS?
## 
### 
Stanford undergrads cheered on Friday night as their fellows
who participate in boxing competed in the Stanford championships.
As these clean-cut looking young athletes were going through their
contests in the ring, that less well-known sport —fencing—was hav
ing its inning, also for a Stanford title.
It was more by way of being a family party than anything else
and yet those boys boxed as heartily as if it had happened to be
Stanford against California.
I don't know of any sport that is more of a game for a he-man
or any sport that is more calculated to fit the individual for the nec
essary later contact with the outside world than amateur boxing
properly supervised as I know it is by Harry Maloney at Stanford.
They call boxing, fencing, soccer, and kindred competition
"minor" sports. Probably because these sports do not attract as
many entrants or interest and the victors are not as liberally re
warded from the standpoint of block letters and the like.
Seems as if another term than "minor," which rather tends to
discredit these sports, could be applied, if indeed there is any oc
casion to differentiate between college sports.
