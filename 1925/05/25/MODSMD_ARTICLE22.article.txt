# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
There has been but little comment
in regard to the proposed amendment
revolutionizing major and minor sport
awards, to be voted on by the student
body at the election on May 26, 1925.
Is this an indication that the amend
ment will go through without much
difficulty in accordance with the well
laid plans of those who drew it up?
Perhaps. However, I am of the opinion
that the amendment should not go
through and I have several reasons for
feeling as I do about the matter.
In the first place what if it does cost
money to buy sweaters for those who
win them by excelling in the different
sports? It would also cost money to
buy medals for those same sports, and
I am sure that, the athletes who win
these awards would prefer to take the
money for the medals and put it into
a sweater and pay the balance out
of their own pockets if the University
does not see fit to reward them by
giving them sweaters.
But if the proposed amendment goes
through, as I understand it, a man in
order to show that he has excelled in
any one of these so-called auxiliary
sports would have to go around with
a gold medals on his sweater or coat,
which would be more or less of a dis
tasteful procedure. He might possibly
be taken for a veteran of the Spanish-
American War or a convention dele
gate.
Also, if an amendment of this nature
does not tend to discourage partici
pation in these secondary sports, it is
hard to tell what would. It might be
argued that a person should go out for
the love of a sport even though no
awards for the particular are given.
This is great as far as theory is con
cerned but it will never work in prac
tice.
Another defect in the amendment is
making tennis a minor sport. Why
should tennis be relegated to the dis
card simply because the amendment
calls for four major and four minor
sports? Tennis takes its place along
with football and baseball as one of
the leading sports in the United States,
and therefore what good reason is
there in not placing it on an equal
footing here at Stanford?
The amendment says that any Stan
ford man who wins a National Cham
pionship in tennis shall be awarded a
block "S." But the very nature of the
amendment precludes the possibility
of any National Championship pros
pect coming to Stanford. Why? Be
cause he will say, "Why should I go
to Stanford where I will be awarded
a mere circle 'S' for my hard work,
when I can go to 'Cal' and get a, big
*C' for the same amount of work?"
Tf Stanford lias any hopes in the
future of getting possible National

[Champions to enter her folds, she must
I offer them some inducements. It is my
, opinion that the passing of this amend
ment will be the death knell to those
j inducements. —H. O. W., '25.

The Editor, Sir:
There has been but little comment
in regard to the proposed amendment
revolutionizing major and minor sport
awards, to be voted on by the student
body at the election on May 26, 1925.
Is this an indication that the amend
ment will go through without much
difficulty in accordance with the well
laid plans of those who drew it up?
Perhaps. However, I am of the opinion
that the amendment should not go
through and I have several reasons for
feeling as I do about the matter.
In the first place what if it does cost
money to buy sweaters for those who
win them by excelling in the different
sports? It would also cost money to
buy medals for those same sports, and
I am sure that, the athletes who win
these awards would prefer to take the
money for the medals and put it into
a sweater and pay the balance out
of their own pockets if the University
does not see fit to reward them by
giving them sweaters.
But if the proposed amendment goes
through, as I understand it, a man in
order to show that he has excelled in
any one of these so-called auxiliary
sports would have to go around with
a gold medals on his sweater or coat,
which would be more or less of a dis
tasteful procedure. He might possibly
be taken for a veteran of the Spanish-
American War or a convention dele
gate.
Also, if an amendment of this nature
does not tend to discourage partici
pation in these secondary sports, it is
hard to tell what would. It might be
argued that a person should go out for
the love of a sport even though no
awards for the particular are given.
This is great as far as theory is con
cerned but it will never work in prac
tice.
Another defect in the amendment is
making tennis a minor sport. Why
should tennis be relegated to the dis
card simply because the amendment
calls for four major and four minor
sports? Tennis takes its place along
with football and baseball as one of
the leading sports in the United States,
and therefore what good reason is
there in not placing it on an equal
footing here at Stanford?
The amendment says that any Stan
ford man who wins a National Cham
pionship in tennis shall be awarded a
block "S." But the very nature of the
amendment precludes the possibility
of any National Championship pros
pect coming to Stanford. Why? Be
cause he will say, "Why should I go
to Stanford where I will be awarded
a mere circle 'S' for my hard work,
when I can go to 'Cal' and get a, big
*C' for the same amount of work?"
