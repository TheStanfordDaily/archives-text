'"Teodoro the Sage"—Luigi Lucatelli,
translated by Morris Bishop.—Boni
and Liveright, Publishers.
Fifty-seven sketches of life are con
tained in the notebook of Teodoro the
Sage. Luigi Lucatelli was only thirty
i eight years old when he died during
; the Great War, but in this book we
j have the irony of laughter of all the
I ages. The stories are flashes from
i the humor of life as it is seen through
the eyes of young Italy; their appeal
is universal in truth and caustic wis-
Uom.
Lucatelli does not exactly make fun
of our ideals, we would resent him if
I he did that, but he shows us the irony
of practice, and paints it with a sar
castic grin.
Some of the stories contain all the
| esentials of a long novel, some are
merely a description of a mood, others
draw a character or caricature so real
that it seems like an intimate friend.
None of the stories are more than
three or four pages long.
It is hard to decide which one is the
most delightful or the most pointed.
Perhaps "Sentiment" and "The Virtu
ous Spinster" are two of the most per
tinent. Lucatelli says things about that
special kind of virtue and sentiment
that we would like to have said if we
had known how.
"Out of the World" and "The Daugh
| ter of the House" are two of the
sketches that contain miniature novels.
They ar3 told with such completeness
and cameo clearness that it seems im
possible that so few words could be
, the agent.
