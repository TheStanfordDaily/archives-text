# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
I have been quite a bit interested in
the discussion which has come up in
regard to the new award plan. I have
heard a lot of arguments for and
against the plan. To date I have not.
heard any one mention the real values
of Physical Education, and when I
mention Physical Education I include
athletics, which is a major division.
I have heard: that there are too many
letters on the campus, therefore they
are not valuable; that four sports in ;
the major and minor divisions of ath
letics are all that the student body can
take part in because of the size of the
student body; that these sports are
arranged according to their value in
gate returns; that these are in thesej
divisions because of their interest to
outside interest, and also that the new
plan gives every one a chance at a
letter whether they WIN or LOSE as
if winning should ever be considered.
How should these sports be valu-j
ated? Not be using gate receipts as a 1
guage, nor by the number of people;
who come to see these sports. For if'
these guages are used then athletics >
are doomed as part of the high school
and college curriculum. They must be
guaged by the value to the individual |
student who participates in them and
through him to the student body as a j
whole. I think these sports should be
valuated accordingly as the way in
which they fulfill their aims. And since
Physical Education is but a part of!
Education then the aims of education
should and can be used for the aims
of athletics. And these aims as out
lined by the National Education Com
mittee are: health, command of funda
mentals, vocation for a living, worthy j
home membership, worthy use of lei
sure time, the development of ethical
character and civic ideals. Now ar-'
range your sports to the above meas
urements and see where they are
classified.
I do not offer the above as a solu
tion for the problem, but rather as ma
terial for discussion. After all has been
said, "The Play (idea) is the Thing."!
Why limit sports? Whenever there is
a limit put on any thing doesn't pro
gression in that thing stop? Why put a
limit to Stanford's advancement and j
chances for advancement in any line 1
of athletics when she is just starting
on her way to supremacy in all lines J
of sports?
The University can only give one
thing that is to be cherished by every!
one who represents in an inter
collegiate sport and that is a letter, j
It represents an ideal and that ideal is, i
that whoever wears one has gone :
through that period of training and
sacrifice which is necessary to repre-j
sent their university in any line of
sport and that letter should be given |
to every one who has satisfied her
standards regardles of winning or los-'
ing. —Faculty Member.

The Editor, Sir:
I have been quite a bit interested in
the discussion which has come up in
regard to the new award plan. I have
heard a lot of arguments for and
against the plan. To date I have not.
heard any one mention the real values
of Physical Education, and when I
mention Physical Education I include
athletics, which is a major division.
I have heard: that there are too many
letters on the campus, therefore they
are not valuable; that four sports in ;
the major and minor divisions of ath
letics are all that the student body can
take part in because of the size of the
student body; that these sports are
arranged according to their value in
gate returns; that these are in thesej
divisions because of their interest to
outside interest, and also that the new
plan gives every one a chance at a
letter whether they WIN or LOSE as
if winning should ever be considered.
How should these sports be valu-j
ated? Not be using gate receipts as a 1
guage, nor by the number of people;
who come to see these sports. For if'
these guages are used then athletics >
are doomed as part of the high school
and college curriculum. They must be
guaged by the value to the individual |
student who participates in them and
through him to the student body as a j
whole. I think these sports should be
valuated accordingly as the way in
which they fulfill their aims. And since
Physical Education is but a part of!
Education then the aims of education
should and can be used for the aims
of athletics. And these aims as out
lined by the National Education Com
mittee are: health, command of funda
mentals, vocation for a living, worthy j
home membership, worthy use of lei
sure time, the development of ethical
character and civic ideals. Now ar-'
range your sports to the above meas
urements and see where they are
classified.
I do not offer the above as a solu
tion for the problem, but rather as ma
terial for discussion. After all has been
said, "The Play (idea) is the Thing."!
