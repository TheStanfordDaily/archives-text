"THE NIGHT CLUB" — Raymond
Griffith, deserted at the altar, becomes
obsessed with a hatred for women, in-;
herits a fortune on the condition he'll
marry a certain one of the hated sex, ■
flies the country, meets his affinity, 1
goes through all the conventional con-!
tortions, and of course the girl turns
out to be the requisite for the fortune.
Just where "the night cluD" as an
essential ingredient of the pfcture i
conies in, we don't know, but even
with the old standard comedy gags!
worked over again the picture con-i
tained a decided kick and we, at least, !
felt that we got our money's worth — 1
and, perhaps, more.
