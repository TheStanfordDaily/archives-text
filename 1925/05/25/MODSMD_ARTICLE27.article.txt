# CAILLAUX'S CAREER CHOSEN TOPIC FOR DOCTOR'S THESIS
## 
### 
"Joseph Caillaux, who is now han
dling the financial affairs of France,
is (with the exception of von Hinden
burg) probably the most talked-of man
in international circles at the present
time," says W. Henry Cooke, Instruc
tor in Citizenship, who has been mak
ing a very detailed study of Caillaux's
complete career, with a view of writ
ing a doctor's thesis on the subject.
Cooke says that all of France is
waiting to see just what Caillaux will
do. France, as we know, is in the most
critical state financially, and just what
measure he will take to set the
finances of the country back on a ra
tional basis is still unknown. It is said
that when he sat before the Chamber
of Deputies, his enemies hurled such
language as had never before been
heard in that body, the reason for the
attack being that because of what
many thought was treason, he was put
in prison from 1917 to 1920.
According to Cooke, however, all
Frenchmen do not hate him. By many
he is hailed as the soundest financier
in France and is expected to bring
things back to normal if anyone can.
It is certain, at any rate, that he is
not trying anything very radical or
mysterious so far, in upsetting the
established order. Caillaux, it is true,
is an idealist and an optimist, but he
believes in building up gradually and
soundly and not taking any chances.
What he intends to do mainly is to
enforce the income tax, which h§
proudly calls his own. He claims that
"knowing people" such as those in the
government and in large business un
dertakings can get around the tax
easily and consistently. Depreciation
of currency is an obvious failure, be
cause it is merely stimulating bank
ruptcy. He does not believe in high
tariffs, because in the long run it will
not be conducive to the general good,
although it might bring advantageous
revenue for a short time. So, his pro
gram is to tighten up on the income
tax, adding to it other forms of direct
taxation and discarding some of the
present indirect taxes.
