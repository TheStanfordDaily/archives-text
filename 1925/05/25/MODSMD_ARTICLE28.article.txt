# WEALTH OF MATERIAL UNCOVERED BY SPRING BASKETBALL PRACTICE
## 
### Wilbur Adams 
Andrew Kerr, head basketball coach,
will have a wealth of material from
which to pick his 1926 varsity, from
the indications of the first week of
spring practice. Three basketball cap
tains—McHose, Oliva, and Price—are
in charge of the training season in
the absence of Kerr who at present
is not on the campus.
With the exception of Oliva, last
season's captain and standing guard,
the whole of the 1925 team is intact.
To take Oliva's place are two particu
larly strong candidates —Newliouse
and Young. Newhouse was a substitute
l!ist season. He weighs in at 220
pounds, and is consequently a hard
man to get around. Young, although a
member of the 1928 class, was unable
to play freshman basketball this year.
Biaggini is another possibility from
the freshman class, but lack of weight
handicaps him to some extent.
At running guard, Sliipkey, Mitchell,
and Harris from last year's varsity are
back for another year's competition.
Clark, captain of the freshman squad,
will also be out for the running guard
job.
When Steele was declared ineligible
for last season, Stanford's hopes drop
ped, but Kerr was successful in devel
oping Jayred and Anderson, from the
1927 squad, into first-rate centers. Next
season will see Steele back in the
game again, and along with him both
Jayred and Anderson. Probably all
three men will be used in the games
with California next winter. The 1928
class offers Dennis and King for the
same position, so there will b'e no lack
of centers next year.
Price, Nevers, and David, who did
most of the playing at forward during
1925, will all be on deck next year. All
three should see plenty of action un
less some newcomers appear. Price,
who was elected captain at the end of
his sophomore year, is one of the
cleverest of basketball players. Nevers
was somewhat handicapped with in
jured ankles the past season, but they
are normal again and, unless he is
hurt in football, he should be going
better than ever next winter. David
was high point man last year.
The freshmen had only two forwards
—Vincent! and Crist. Both of them are
light, but fast, and so should go well
for a few minutes in the important
contests of next season.
Spring practice is scheduled to con
tinue for two more weeks.
—Vote "No" on Awards—
The women champion swimmers of
the Pacific Coast are to band together
and stage a women's athletic day at
Lake Arrowhead to which mere man
will be taUooed —except, of course, as
spectators.
