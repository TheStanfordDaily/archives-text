# MINING GRADUATES RECEIVE POSITIONS
## 
### 
Several graduate students in the
Mining and Metallurgy department
have secured positions for the summer
with large mining companies. Among
these are: E. E. Maillot, '23; Albert
Forster, '23; P. D. Hanson, '24, and
L. R. Moretti, '23.
Maillot, who will receive an engi
neer's degree in mining and metal
lurgy in June, is leaving on the first
of that month for Nome, Alaska. He
will be employed there by the U. S.
Smelting, Mining & Refining Co. to
assist in making a thorough investiga
tion of the thawing of frozen gravels
with cold water. Before the gravel can
be dredged for gold it must be thawed.
Formerly the thawing was done with
steam, but it is expected that this can
be done more thoroughly with cold
water and with a great saving of fuel.
The work, which will take five months,
is under the direction of P. S. Mulock,
'14, who is superintendent of the re
search department of that company.
Albert Forster, who receives his en
gineer's degree from the department
this June, has been engaged by the
Hercules Powder Co. as an engineer to
supervise experimental blasting. J. B.
Rice, '97, is the manager of the com
pany.
F. D. Hanson and L. R. Moretti will
spend the summer at Virginia City,
Nevada, in the employ of the Com
stock Merger Mines Co., of which T.
C. Baker, '10, is the general manager.
