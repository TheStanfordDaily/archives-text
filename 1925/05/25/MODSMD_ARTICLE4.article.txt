bouts Martin was always in a posi
ti onto score and was never pressed.

last round.

from Fain by decision at the close of
the fourth round. Fain, a freshman,
showed greatly improved form over
his early season work. In every round
he carried the fight to Farmin, and the
judges' decision for a draw at the end
of the third round forced the fight to
an extra round, which F'armin won
by a close margin.
Previous to the final round Fain had
fought against A. Reich in a bout
which went to extra time when the
judges were unable to agree. In the
fourth round of the final Fain was
appreciably tired and was unable to
stay with Farmin.
After losing the first round and
tying the second, Tull came back and
gained the third from Arthur by a
clear margin. In the exetra period Tull
was able to score consistently over
Arthur and won the decision.
Schall defeated Heston for the mid
dleweight title, as Heston's speed was
unable to match against the superior
hitting and boxing ability of Schall.
In the welterweight division Captain
Martin won easily over his two op
ponents, H. L. Dulin and Raaf. Tn both
bouts Martin was always in a posi
ti onto score and was never pressed.
Raaf took the runner-up medal by
winning in the semi-final from W. B.
Wells.
Miron took the featherweight title
by gaining a technical knockout over
McCall when the referee stopped the
bout in the third round. Miron was
clearly superior throughout the bout,
and McCall was unable to cope with
the varsity boxer.
In the lightweight final Parsons de
feated Ross in a bout which went to
an extra round. Parsons was the more
clever, but Ross' gameness put the
outcome in doubt until the end of the
last round.
