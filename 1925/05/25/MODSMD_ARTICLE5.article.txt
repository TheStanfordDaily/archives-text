were held on the Stanford oval Friday

for the plaque at 4:15 Wednesday aft
ernoon.
By taking an early lead of twenty

but the fifth lap when the Encina runner
cut down the lead to ten yards, the
Breakers easily won the first heat in \
3:17. The winning squad consisted of
Wood, Nichols, Bailard, Wool, Meikle
john, Bell, and Busch.
El Toro led Sigma Nu in the early
laps of the relay, but was later forced to
take second position. The clubmen caused
Sigma Nu to run the mile relay in 3 :15,
which was the fastest time made in the
preliminaries. Harrison, Kohler, Ely,
Hale, Bragg, Herrington, Briggs, and
Macintosh comprised the Sigma Nu team.
Breakers hold the relay record at 3 :14 2-5.
The race between the Theta Xi and
Kappa Sigma teams was the closest of
the afternoon. Kappa Sigma led during
the first and second laps, but Theta Xi
took the pole during the third lap. Sco
field was only two paces ahead of the
Kappa Sigma runner when he broke the
tape. The time for the heat was 3:18.
Casad, Hotchkiss, Porterfield, Freeman,
Butler, Forster, and Scofield ran for
Theta Xi.
Although Crookshank failed to pass
Wells in the last lap of the Delta Upsi
lon-Sigma Alpha Epsilon race, the time,
3:19, was very slow. Stevenson succeeded
in taking the pole for S. A. E. in the
fourth lap after Delta Upsilon had led
from the start. S. A. E. runners were
Hamlin, Mclnness, Todd, Stevenson,
Harrell, McDermont, Bledsoe, and Wells.
Tomorrow afternoon the 120-yard low
hurdle and shot put events will be held
