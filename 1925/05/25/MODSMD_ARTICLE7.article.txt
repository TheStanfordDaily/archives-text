# Revise Awards Plan First!
## 
### 
Students will be asked tomorrow to vote upon an amendment
to the A. S. S. U. constitution which combines certain desirable
changes of the award rules with other highly undesirable proposi
tions. Before coming to any decision in the matter, voters should
consider the proposal as a whole, realizing that approval of the
awards plan means acceptance of its defects while rejection of the
plan leaves a chance for revising it, for saving the good parts and
discarding the bad ones.
Modification should come before acceptance, not afterwards.
There are decided improvements over the present system in the
new plan, as well as important injustices. The setting up of definite
requirements for the winning of a letter is a good idea. Better than
that is the elimination of the victory clauses in these regulations.
A team should be recognized for representing Stanford, not for
winning for the Cardinal.
But, furthermore, all teams which represent the University
should be similarly rewarded. The suggestion to offer the four
major and four minor sports a sweater insignia, while the others
receive only a medal, is a discriminating slight to the "auxiliary"
group. It is as though the weight basketball men; the golfers; the
wrestlers, fencers and gymnasts; the cross-country runners and
handball players were just little brothers —we big boys like to see
you around, but we won't let you play with us.
If this group gets medals, all should have medals. If one sport
receives letters, all should receive letters in one form or another.
There are the additional disadvantages of having tennis a minor
sport competing against major interest in other universities; the
relegating of polo to an unknown limbo where the players may pre
sumably be eligible to receive any sort of award, sweater or other
wise, that the military department sees fit to give; and the general
retrenching of the announced policy of the Board of Athletic Con
trol that it is encouraging sport for all. Whatever the board may
be doing, if this plan goes through, the students will be decidedly
encouraging sport for only a few.
These provisions lay themselves open to attack from every
angle. Amateur enthusiasts may strongly argue professionalism.
Whether it is true or not, it appears to be.
Students should not permit this proposed amendment to be in
corporated in the constitution. There is no way to prevent this
except by defeating the measure and calling for a revision by a
second committee.
The weaknesses should be corrected first.
Vote "NO" tomorrow! And be sure to vote.

changes of the award rules with other highly undesirable proposi
tions. Before coming to any decision in the matter, voters should
consider the proposal as a whole, realizing that approval of the
awards plan means acceptance of its defects while rejection of the
plan leaves a chance for revising it, for saving the good parts and
discarding the bad ones.
Modification should come before acceptance, not afterwards.
There are decided improvements over the present system in the
new plan, as well as important injustices. The setting up of definite
requirements for the winning of a letter is a good idea. Better than
that is the elimination of the victory clauses in these regulations.
A team should be recognized for representing Stanford, not for
winning for the Cardinal.
But, furthermore, all teams which represent the University
should be similarly rewarded. The suggestion to offer the four
major and four minor sports a sweater insignia, while the others
receive only a medal, is a discriminating slight to the "auxiliary"
group. It is as though the weight basketball men; the golfers; the
wrestlers, fencers and gymnasts; the cross-country runners and
handball players were just little brothers —we big boys like to see
you around, but we won't let you play with us.
If this group gets medals, all should have medals. If one sport
receives letters, all should receive letters in one form or another.
There are the additional disadvantages of having tennis a minor
sport competing against major interest in other universities; the
relegating of polo to an unknown limbo where the players may pre
sumably be eligible to receive any sort of award, sweater or other
wise, that the military department sees fit to give; and the general
retrenching of the announced policy of the Board of Athletic Con
trol that it is encouraging sport for all. Whatever the board may
be doing, if this plan goes through, the students will be decidedly
encouraging sport for only a few.
These provisions lay themselves open to attack from every
angle. Amateur enthusiasts may strongly argue professionalism.
Whether it is true or not, it appears to be.
Students should not permit this proposed amendment to be in
corporated in the constitution. There is no way to prevent this
except by defeating the measure and calling for a revision by a
second committee.
The weaknesses should be corrected first.
Vote "NO" tomorrow! And be sure to vote.
