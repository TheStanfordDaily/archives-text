# El CAPITAN DEFEATS SIGMA NU BALL TEAM IN SEMI-FINAL GAME
## El Campo Nine Takes Second Contest of Day From Phi Gamma Delta 
### Cliff Moore 
El Capitan defeated Sigma Nu in
one of the most exciting games played
in the intramural baseball league this
season. The contest decided the win
ner of the semi-final round of play, the
club team taking the long end of a
$ to 6 score. El Campo had little diffi
culty disposing of Phi Gamma Delta
by an 11 to 1 count in the other semi
final contest played yesterday.
The El Capitan-Sigma Nu encounter
looked like a walkaway for the fra
ternity team until the sixth inning.
Both teams succeeded in making one
run each in the first inning. Sigma Nu
counted for two more in the second,
one in the third, one in the fourth, and
one in the fifth, meanwhile keeping El
Capitan scoreless.
Sixth Inning Rally
El Capitan came up in the sixth
frame with the score 6 to 1 against
them, and with timely hitting aided by
several errors, managed to tally eight
runs. El Capitan tightened in the sev
enth and didn't give the Row nine a
chance to score a run.
Wilson pitched a good game for the
Sigma Nu team with the exception of
the disastrous sixth inning when his
entire team went up in the air. Marsh
was effective on the mound for El
Capitan, and was furthermore aided
in keeping the Sigma Nu score down
by steady support from his team
mates.
Fijis Lose
El Campo clearly outclassed Phi
Gamma Delta, winning by the one
aided score of 11 to 1. The Fijis scored
their only tally in the first frame, and
from then on were prevented from
scoring, because of inability to connect
with the ball when hits were most
needed.
El Campo scored runs in every in
ning, assisted by numerous errors on
the part of the fraternity players.
Grace, the Fiji hurler, did not pitch
his usual steady game, and the El
Campo batters had little difficulty con
necting with his offerings. Britton :
pitched a very creditable game for the j
winners, being successful throughout;
the contest in keeping the Fijis off j
the bases.
