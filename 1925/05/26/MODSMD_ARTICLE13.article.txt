# SYLLABI ARE PRINTED BY MIMEOGRAPH DEPAR DEPARTMENT
## 
### 
The job of keeping syllabus fees
down to as low a figure as possible
rests with Mrs. Ramsey, who runs the
University's own mimeograph office.
It is located in the basement of the
Administration building almost direct
ly under the registrar's office.
It is here that syllabi, instructions,
and anouncements for practically
every course in the University have
been prepared for the last fifteen years
and here is located the motor-driven
duplicator which runs almost con
stantly, printing material for some
professor or other.
With the exception of the depart
ments of history, psychology, econo
mics, chemistry, and physics, who
have their own machines, the office
does the work of every department,
besides much for the administration
and its various commitees. It has the
only motor-driven machine and can
run off large quantities of printed mat
ter of all sorts upon demand. Under
pressure as many as 2000 sheets an
hour, or 16,000 per day, can be turned
out.
The office was established in 1911
under the direction of Mrs. Ramsey,

who is still in charge and who, with
the assistance for 'four hours a day
of a student helper, does all the work.
For some time after the office began
the duplicator was a hand-run affair
which involved steady turning of a
crank and the feeding of paper by
hand. As at present equipped, the ma
chine can be set to print any pre
determined number of . copies of a
form up to 100 and will go on auto
matically feeding and printing until
the correct total is reached whereupon
a bell rings—to -notify the attendant.
Professors bring their syllabus notes
to the office in manuscript form and
from these stencils of the necessary
pages are cut by Mrs. Ramsey on a
typewriter. Making a stencil consists
in partially perforating a sheet of spe
cially prepared paper and demands a
sharp staccato touch on the typewriter
and very clear type. Almost any num
ber of sheets can be run off from the
stencils which, when once made, can
be used again and again. In the office
files are stencils for syllabi of courses
given fifteen or sixteen years back and
still usable.
All the way from ten copies for
some small classes up to 700 for Citi
zenship classes and 800 for commence
ment announcements are made. The
office has its busiest time during the
early part of each quarter and at the
close when final examinations are
printed. October is the heaviest month
of the year although almost every
month 500 reams of 50*0 sheets each
are used. This means that 25,000 blank
pieces of paper are transformed into
so many printed copies bearing print
ing, diagrams, or drawings. Many of
the textbooks written by Stanford pro
fessors have been used for several
years in the form of these mimeo
graphed sheets in order that they
could get the final test of actual use
with classes. •
Stencil Is Used
The stencil permits almost any sort
of a design to be printed, and geo
metrical and architectural drawings
may be made by cutting the stencils
by hand. In order to keep the machine
from blurring or blotting the type as it
prints, it is cleaned each day and com
pletely torn down and reassembled
each week.
The type of paper used must be se
lected with care in order that it can
be written in ink without blurring by
students taking lecture notes and still
it must take the printing clearly.
After each job is finished an extra
copy is filed in the University library
in which is kept a record of all the
syllabi made during each year. The
total cost of the work is then figured,
taking into account paper, ink, labor,
and all other expenses, and upon this
basis the student pays a syllabus fee
for the course it covers which covers
only the actual cost, for the office is
only self-supporting and makes no
profit upon its work.
