# Last Chaparral to Come Out Thursday
## 
### 
At 8 o'clock next Thursday, Chappie
will make its last appearance on the
campus this year. The event is being
commemorated with a No! number.
The cover illustrates a Stanford wo
man of 1776 or thereabout, in the act
of offering a determined and emphatic
"No!" accompanied by appropriate
gestures to a Stanford rough of the
same period. It is decidedly an action
picture, although not slow motion.
This issue will be of a size equal to
that put out for the Big Game and not
being confined to any special theme
other than No! it has a wide variety
of wit and humor. Not until the first
of next October will -Chappie again
entertain the campus.
As a special favor it has been an
nounced that Mexican money and
Chinese currency will all be accepted
in payment for the magazine. The sale
will end promptly at 1 p.m.
Chappie says, "Vote Yes! on the No!
number!"
