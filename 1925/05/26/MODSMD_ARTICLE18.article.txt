# CARD TRACKSTERS LEAVE TODAY FOR P.C.C. TRACK MEET
## Muhs, Shipkey Added to List Of Stanford Entries; Hoffman Improves 
### Douglas Meservey 
Stanford's representatives to the
Pacific Coast Conference track and
field meet left this afternoon for San
Francisco where they are to board the
Shasta Limited tonight for Seattle.
A last-minute change in the person
nel of the team was announced yes
terday by Coach R. L. Templeton.
Fourteen men will go with him as
planned, but Caspar and Kerr are to be
replaced by Shipkey and Muhs. Both
of the latter are certain to place in
the north so that the relative strength
of the Cards remains unchanged.
Oregon won the conference meet
last year with a total of but thirty
seven points. As the six-man team
which is to journey to Chicago later
is itself capable of thirty-six points
the Card aggregation should have little
trouble in piling up a large score.
Weak in Field Events
In the field events the northern
members of the Conference seem to be
comparativly weak. Captain Hartranft
and Hoffman, the Stanford entries in
the shot and discus, will have little
competition if latest reports as to win
ning distances in northern meets are
true.
Captain Egtvet of Washington will
be the outstanding competitor of the
two Cards in both shot and discus. His
marks of 44 feet and 132 feet are the
best in the North this season although
neither compare to those of Hartranft
and Hoffman.
The latter is coming to be a worthy
successor to the Stanford captain and
is another of that line of weight
throwers who begin their names with
"H"—Hartranft, Houser, and Hills. In
practice Thursday he put the shot 47
feet 10 inches and the discus 149 feet,
gaining himself a place on the team
going east.
Macßae and Crookshank may meet
unexpected opposition in Flanagan of
Oregon in the broad jump. He was at
a disadvantage in the Stanford meet
here April 11 through lack of practice,'
but has improved rapidly. He set a
new northern record last week of 23
feet 4 5-10 inches when Washington
defeated Oregon.
