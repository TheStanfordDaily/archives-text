# M'DOWELL TALKS ON STANFORD 'GRAD' AT FORUM TOMORROW
## 
### 
John E. McDowell, alumni secretary,
will speak on "What Happens to a
Stanford Grad" at an open meeting of
Euphronia Society at 7:30 o'clock to
morrow evening in the Trophy Room
of the Old Union.
This subject is pertinent because of
the nearness of graduation. Mr. Mc-
Dowejl is especially competent to
speak on the problem, since as alumni
secretary, he keeps in close touch with
graduates.
An open forum on the general ques
tion of a college education will be held
following the talk.
This will be the fourth of the five
open forums being sponsored by Eu
phronia this quarter. The next will be
held Wednesday, June 3, on the place
of the Y. M. C. A. and Y. W. C. A.
on the Stanford campus.
Following the discussion, tryouts
will be held for membership in Eu
phronia. Those desiring to try out
should communicate with W. L. Goss
lin, president, or H. W. Peterson, sec
retary of the society.
Students graduating this year, and
all interested in the question are urged
to attend the meeting.
