# Eliminating Loafing
## 
### 
Rather too soon after the recent senior balloting at Dartmouth for us
to suspect a relation between the two, comes the announcement of a plan to
eliminate loafing at that institution. Yet it is interesting that the seniors
in their balloting and the faculty in its action recognize the same evil of
loafing through college. How long, we wonder, will it be before other
faculties will admit this same evil and take such reasonable action to
eliminate it?
Each man at Dartmouth in order to receive a degree must henceforth
pass a comprehensive examination at the end of his course. In connec
tion with this plan, unusual freedom is to be allowed students in the selec
tion of their studies, and it is hoped that in this way the all-night cram
will be eliminated as a method of passing courses and ultimately receiving
a degree.
The plan of a comprehensive examination is a good one which prima
facie demands attention, and to which neither faculty nor students can
offer legitimate objections, always providing it is conducted with care.
This care would be insured by a properly composed, rather heterogeneous,
and fairly large examining committee. All that would be lost would be a
little time in examination, and there would be gained much time which is
now lost in the amazingly common art of loafing, of spending time doing
nothing.
This plan does not mean the elimination of the bull session, of campus
activities, of recreative or social pursuits, or even of idling; it does mean
the elimination of the practice of doing nothing, of drifting and of rest
lessness. ;
The plan will not accomplish this immediately; it takes time for an at
titude to be changed, yet it may eventually be done by bringing proper in
fluence to bear upon the right spot, and to our minds the plan does do this.
Any American undergraduate of today knows that he has passed many
courses through a mere cramming for examinations, and a sliding, slip
pery attitude at other times during the progress of the work. He knows
also that he has wasted much time (witness the vote of the Dartmouth
seniors which showed a markedly general appreciation of how much time
they had wasted during their college courses). With the plan in opera
tion, the student would necessarily take courses which he knew he would
enjoy and study in, not the ones, as he now does, which he can most easily
slide through with the least study. It seems that the average Stanford
student now takes about three hours of work a term in which he is inter
ested, six which he thinks will be especially useful to him in later life or
which his parents require him to take, and six which he thinks he can slide
through most easily. Such a practice is to be expected under the present
system.
' To accompany this plan there must be an unusually elastic set of re
quired studies. No educator can expect a man to study diligently a sub
ject in which he is uninterested, even though he might study it diligently
enough to pass it under the present plan. The undergraduate must not
only be allowed the utmost freedom in selection of courses, but even more
he must be allowed great liberties within each individual course. His re
port topics must be his personal choice, and his outside reading as well
must be only arbitrarily assigned. Increased interest and increased study
may thus be secured, and the comprehensive examination will become the
aim of the whole course, which will, through it, be unified to an extent un
known under the present system of "passing the course."

Rather too soon after the recent senior balloting at Dartmouth for us
to suspect a relation between the two, comes the announcement of a plan to
eliminate loafing at that institution. Yet it is interesting that the seniors
in their balloting and the faculty in its action recognize the same evil of
loafing through college. How long, we wonder, will it be before other
faculties will admit this same evil and take such reasonable action to
eliminate it?
Each man at Dartmouth in order to receive a degree must henceforth
pass a comprehensive examination at the end of his course. In connec
tion with this plan, unusual freedom is to be allowed students in the selec
tion of their studies, and it is hoped that in this way the all-night cram
will be eliminated as a method of passing courses and ultimately receiving
a degree.
The plan of a comprehensive examination is a good one which prima
facie demands attention, and to which neither faculty nor students can
offer legitimate objections, always providing it is conducted with care.
This care would be insured by a properly composed, rather heterogeneous,
and fairly large examining committee. All that would be lost would be a
little time in examination, and there would be gained much time which is
now lost in the amazingly common art of loafing, of spending time doing
nothing.
This plan does not mean the elimination of the bull session, of campus
activities, of recreative or social pursuits, or even of idling; it does mean
the elimination of the practice of doing nothing, of drifting and of rest
lessness. ;
The plan will not accomplish this immediately; it takes time for an at
titude to be changed, yet it may eventually be done by bringing proper in
fluence to bear upon the right spot, and to our minds the plan does do this.
Any American undergraduate of today knows that he has passed many
courses through a mere cramming for examinations, and a sliding, slip
pery attitude at other times during the progress of the work. He knows
also that he has wasted much time (witness the vote of the Dartmouth
seniors which showed a markedly general appreciation of how much time
they had wasted during their college courses). With the plan in opera
tion, the student would necessarily take courses which he knew he would
enjoy and study in, not the ones, as he now does, which he can most easily
slide through with the least study. It seems that the average Stanford
student now takes about three hours of work a term in which he is inter
ested, six which he thinks will be especially useful to him in later life or
which his parents require him to take, and six which he thinks he can slide
through most easily. Such a practice is to be expected under the present
system.
' To accompany this plan there must be an unusually elastic set of re
quired studies. No educator can expect a man to study diligently a sub
ject in which he is uninterested, even though he might study it diligently
enough to pass it under the present plan. The undergraduate must not
only be allowed the utmost freedom in selection of courses, but even more
he must be allowed great liberties within each individual course. His re
port topics must be his personal choice, and his outside reading as well
must be only arbitrarily assigned. Increased interest and increased study
may thus be secured, and the comprehensive examination will become the
aim of the whole course, which will, through it, be unified to an extent un
known under the present system of "passing the course."
