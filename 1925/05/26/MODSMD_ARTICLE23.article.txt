# GENIUSES DISCOVERED TO BE DISTINGUISHED EVEN AS CHILDREN
## 
### 
That eminent men are distinguished
even in childhood days is one of the
conclusions drawn by the psychology
department as a result of research
into the lives of three hundred gen
iuses. Miss Catherine M. Cox, a gradu
ate in the psychology department and
Director of the California Bureau of
Juvenile Research, has been working
on this subject for three years.
Fifteen thousand biographical works
were consulted and 3,000 of these were
selected for detailed use as source
material. Case studies of each of the
300 geniuses (the most eminent, men
and women living between 1450 1 and
1850) were prepared from the bio
graphical sources.
Goethe had the highest 1.Q.; he
rated nearly 210. There has only been
one person ever recorded with a

higher I.Q. than this. Wolsey, Leib
nitz, and Grotius were near 190. Bacon,
Erasmus, Descartes, and Pope were
among those near 180.
If the records were more complete
it is quite probable that the ratings
would be even higher, according to
the belief of Miss Cox.

Students at Syracuse University are
accused of appropriating $2000 worth
of souvenirs from one of the hotels in
Syracuse. The missing articles in
cluded two four-point pails, two ice
cream stands, seven bread trays, 18
soup tureens,, 13 serving trays 11 cof
fee pots, six thermos bottles, 104 sil
ver pepper shakers, two mustard
dishes, 67 sugar tongs, 45 dozen tea
spoons, and 51 dozen forks. Ash-trays,
curtain tassels, table covers, and signs
were also taken from the ballroom.

By vote of the faculty, Union Col
lege (N. Y.), the honor system has
been "indefinitely suspended."
