# CABBAGES and THINGS

### Steve O'Donnell 
Since spring picnics are now being
indulged in by young and old, Cab
bages wishes to suggest the following
rules of conduct in regard to them:
(1) Don't let a bee sit on you. If he
insists upon ajighting, make him
stand on his head.
(2) Don't put a live water-dog in your
friend's sandwich. If you do, you
will become known as the "life of
the picnic," and this is distinctly
to be avoided.
(3) Don't make any wise crack about
. the wood-ticks in the clocks on
your friend's hosiery.
(4) Don't offer to carry anybody
across the stream.
(5) Never start a forest fire.
(6) If you're wise, don't go on any
picnics. —J. S.

week.
