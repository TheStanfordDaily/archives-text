"DICK TURPIN"—STANFORD.
In this picture Tom Mix's horse,
Black Bess, starred, and Tom —well,
he also ran.
""And now, ladies and gentlemen, if
you wish to see Romance as it used
to be, superhuman efforts, gallantry,
and all that sort of thing, just hop
upon the tin lizzie and go galloping
down the street.
This Tom Mix has quite a flare for
riding a horse, but we have failed and
failed utterly to detect any other
ability from his screen performances.
As for the horse —it certainly takes
some horse to keep going for three
whole days and nights, and we did not
notice any rest by the wayside. To be
sure, those were the days when the
men were men.
The picture had flashes of interest
and a few clever turns, but it was
filled too much with sentimental gush
and bombast to appeal for very long.
The only true note was struck when
the horse was shot down after the
three-day journey (mentioned above).
That at least was something, but the
remainder was just one escape after
another and the beautiful girl at the
end of the trail.
Costumes and settings were quite
charming, but one had rather see a
scenic picture, beastly as they are, for
that. As we said before, the horse is
the thing.
In the first act we see Dick Turpin,
the handsome gallant highwayman.
Strange that those old days had a
corner on gallant highwaymen. From
then on poor Dick doesn't have a
peaceful moment until the final fade
out is flashed on the screen (five min
utes ahead of time). Robbery-meeting
and rescuing beautiful girl from more
normal members of the profession—
rescuing her a second time —from an
obnoxious fiance — lurid intervals —
third rescue —and perspective scene
with Dick, Dick's mother, and beauti
ful girl in the foreground. We forgot
to mention that the girl had only one
relative, a hard-hearted uncle in ca
hoots with the obnoxious lord, and
that Mr. Turpin stole from the rich
and gave to the poor.
Really, what more could one ask for
in the way of romance —beautiful,
squishy romance. (We refrain from
mentioning Dick's prodigious fight for
fear that you would not believe.)
