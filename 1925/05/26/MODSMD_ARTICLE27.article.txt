## "Dodson's Hints on Musical Hits"

Of interest among the new Victor
record releases:

John McCormack sings "Moonlight
and Roses." The dance record enjoyed
a larger local sale than the famous
"Yes, We Have No Bananas."
♦ * *
Paul Whiteman's first record in
some time has "Pozzo" on one side
and "Whoa! Nellie" on the other.
• * •
Jack Shilkret's Orchestra plays
"Isn't She the Sweetest Thing" and
"No One."
