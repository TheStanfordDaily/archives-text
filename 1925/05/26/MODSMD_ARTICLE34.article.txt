those given at the University. There
are also courses in marine inverte
brates and zoology research.
In the summer quarter twelve cours
es in zoology, biology, and botany will
be given. The present courses will be
repeated and three courses on marine
organisms, one in botany, and one in
heredity will be added.
Several noted physiologists and zool- j
ogists will be included in the faculty i
of the station. Among these will be
Professor H. S. Jennings of Johns
Hopkins University, a celebrated com
parative anatomist. Professor Jen
nings' specialty is the behavior and
genetics of the lower organisms. Pro

versity of Toronto will spend his third

good, and the registration limit of j
twenty-five students has already been i

The Hopkins Marine Station, which
is a department of Stanford University,
is located on Cabrillo Point between
the towns of Monterey and Pacific
Grove. It was founded in 1891 by David
Starr Jordan and endowed principally
by Timothy Hopkins. The present;
three-story reinforced concrete build- ]
ing was erected in 1917 a half mile |
from the site of the original building.
It contains five large laboratories for
classes, eight private laboratories, a
library, and numerous storerooms and
specimen rooms.
The station is open the entire year
to investigators and special students.
The departments of zoology and physi
ology schedule most of their summer
courses at the station instead of the
University. The use of the station is
tendered free of charge to investi
gators prepared to carry out research
work. A general registration fee of
seventy-five dollars per quarter is
charged for undergraduates.
