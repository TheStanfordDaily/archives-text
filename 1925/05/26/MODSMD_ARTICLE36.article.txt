# DEAN CULVER TELLS RADIO AUDIENCE OF UNIVERSITY HOUSING
## 
### 
"The public is too prone to judge
tlie entire life of the college student
by the few glimpses it catches of its
lighter sides at football games and
athletic events," said George B. Cul
ver, dean of men, in his ten-minute
talk on the Stanford housing system
given last night over radio KPO. The
address was in conjunction with the
9 to 10 o'clock program given by the
Stanford band.
Seventy-two pieces made the trip to
the city and gave a program of ten
selections under the direction of Pro
fessor E. Martin of the Department of
Classical Literature.
Dean Culver went on to say, "I have
dealt with college men for many years
and know that they are, for the most
part, a group of earnest and serious
minded students and by no means oc
cupied all the time with the lighter
diversions with which the public asso
ciates them."
The Dean told of the division of the
academic year into four parts and the
proportions of students who entered
during each quarter. He then gave
reasons for the University's policy of
having freshmen live and eat together
during their entire freshman year. He
stated, "The benefits of this system

have been even greater than was at I
i first anticipated. It has been the main
! factor in the formation of many firm j
| friendships.
This idea, combined with the spon
sor system, credit for the adoption of
which must be given to Tom Irwin,
has resulted in a better set of living
J conditions for freshmen that has mani-
J fested itself in the decided improve
ment. made in both athletic and schol
astic records of the first year men
i since they no longer need fear any
form of hazing."
The fraternity rushing system was
also explained.
