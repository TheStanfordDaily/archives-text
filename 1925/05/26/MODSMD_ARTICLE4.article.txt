# Band Acquires Own Rehearsal Quarters
## 
### 
For the first time in its thirty-year
existence the Stanford University band
has a building exclusively for its own
use. At a cost of $1800 the old struc
ture used as training quarters has
been remodeled and painted to serve
as a band clubhouse, and moved next
to the varsity tennis courts.
Painted green outside, gray inside,
and equipped with electric lights, the
building has been made both service
able and presentable in appearance.
A large auditorium for rehearsals and
smaller rooms for equipment, library,
and office have been built in.
Next year the band expects to join
the national musical fraternity that is
now established at Princeton, Purdue,
Chicago, and other eastern universi
ties.
