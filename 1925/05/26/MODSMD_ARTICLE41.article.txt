# Romanic Language Oral Examination Abolished
## 
### 
By recent departmental action the
Department of Romanic Languages
abolished the oral examination for a
master's degree. Under the new rul
ing, besides handing in an acceptable
thesis, the candidate must pass an
examination consisting of two parts:
first, a two-hour examination on the
history of the literature of the lan
guage; second, a one-hour examina
tion on the ability to write and speak
the language.
