# FOUR RELAY TEAMS CLASH TOMORROW IN INTRAMURAL RACE
## 
### 
Breakers, Sigma Nu, Theta Xi, and
Sigma Alpha Epsilon will run in the
final intramural race for the relay
plaque tomorrow afternoon at 4:15 on
the Stanford oval.
Judging from the times made in the
preliminary heats, any- one of the four
teams may equal the record made last
year by the Breakers when they cov
ered the distance in 3:14 2-5. The finish
of the relay will no doubt be close
with the Breakers and Sigma Nu de
pending upon their anchor men to
win the event.
Although Sigma Nu ran the relay in
3:15 Friday afternoon, the Breakers
have made change in their lineup and
with Carlsmith and Brown running
expect to cut down their time by two
seconds. Theta Xi won the right to
enter the finals by winning the third
heat Friday in 3:18, while Sigma
Alpha Epsilon won the fourth heat
in 3:19.
Eight men will comprise the relay
team and each man will run a lap of
220 yards. The standing of the various
teams entered in the intramural meet
will not be affected by the results of
the relay as only the score of the
highest ten men itt each of the events
will count towards the plaque. On
Thursday the 880-yard run and discus
events will be held.
