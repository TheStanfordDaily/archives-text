# TWO ONE-ACT PLAYS TO BE PRESENTED BY BUCKINGHAM'S CLASS
## 
### 
Two one-act plays will be presented
by Mrs. Elizabeth Buckingham's class
in Dramatic Interpretation at the Little
Theatre at 8:15 Thursday evening.
The plays to be given are "Mary's
Wedding," by Gilbert Cannon, and
"The Eternal Girl" by Bruce Bliven.
Student talent has been used ex
clusively in the acting, direction, and
scenery design of the plays. This is
the second group of plays that have
been given public presentation by the
class, the others having been given
May 14. "The Little Stone House," a
Russian tragedy, and "Thursday Eve
ning," a domestic comedy, were played
at that time.
"Mary's Wedding" is a Celtic trag
edy of disillusionment and disappoint
ment. "The Eternal Girl" is in a de
cidedly lighter vein and was written
by Bruce Bliven, well-known ( 'as a maga
zine writer and journalist evqn while
he was still a student at Stanford. It
is fantastically and amusingly impos
sible and is laid inside the Pearly
Gates and introduces Saint Peter and
other well-known celestial characters.
The fact that the heroine has suddenly
become an angel and is unable to curb
her romantic tendencies results in
Heaven becoming somewhat upset.
The presentation is open to the
public.
