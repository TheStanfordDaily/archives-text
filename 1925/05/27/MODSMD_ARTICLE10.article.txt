# COMMITTEE CONSIDERING PLAN FOR HONOR COURSES
## Special Opportunity Offered Exceptional Students by Study Grouping 
### Marietta Fry 
A new plan of study for exceptional
students is being considered by the
special commitete of student ability.
In every ordinary college course the
professor must consider primarily the
average student. But the members of
every class vary greatly in ability. This
difficulty has been lessened by the di
vision of the curriculum into Upper
and Lower Divisions, but it is still a
great problem. The student above the
average is usually content with doing
average \\ork because it does not pay
him to do better. At present the gifted
student who realizes his abilities and
wishes to make the best of them is
merely turned loose without the guid
ance and direction necessary to him at
this stage of his development.

Tried in Other Universities

Honor courses, or fields of concen
tration, have been instituted in some
universities to attempt to solve this
problem. According to the report,
1 the idea is to free the superior student
i from the obligation of attendance upon
classes, set papers, and examinations,
from learning things which he already
knows to the end that he may enter
upon a more intensive study of a larger

field where initiative, self-direction, and
a higher type of thinking will be de
veloped.
Harvard, Minnesota, Swathmorc,
Cincinnati, Buffalo, Wellesley, Smith, i
and many other institutions have in- j
stalled the system of Honor Courses, i
Chancellor Capen of the University of 1
Buffalo says that the effects have been
remarkable, and that the development j
of great individuality is one of the most;
notable results. It is also noteworthy j
that none of the students have abused it.
