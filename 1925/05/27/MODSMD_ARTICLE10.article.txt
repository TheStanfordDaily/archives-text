# COMMITTEE CONSIDERING PLAN FOR HONOR COURSES
## Special Opportunity Offered Exceptional Students by Study Grouping 
### Marietta Fry 
A new plan of study for exceptional
students is being considered by the
special commitete of student ability.
In every ordinary college course the
professor must consider primarily the
average student. But the members of
every class vary greatly in ability. This
difficulty has been lessened by the di
vision of the curriculum into Upper
and Lower Divisions, but it is still a
great problem. The student above the
average is usually content with doing
average \\ork because it does not pay
him to do better. At present the gifted
student who realizes his abilities and
wishes to make the best of them is
merely turned loose without the guid
ance and direction necessary to him at
this stage of his development.

Tried in Other Universities

Honor courses, or fields of concen
tration, have been instituted in some
universities to attempt to solve this
problem. According to the report,
1 the idea is to free the superior student
i from the obligation of attendance upon
classes, set papers, and examinations,
from learning things which he already
knows to the end that he may enter
upon a more intensive study of a larger

field where initiative, self-direction, and
a higher type of thinking will be de
veloped.
Harvard, Minnesota, Swathmorc,
Cincinnati, Buffalo, Wellesley, Smith, i
and many other institutions have in- j
stalled the system of Honor Courses, i
Chancellor Capen of the University of 1
Buffalo says that the effects have been
remarkable, and that the development j
of great individuality is one of the most;
notable results. It is also noteworthy j
that none of the students have abused it.

Details of Plan

The Independent Study Plan is as :
follows:
(1) A standing academic committee
of five is hereby created which shall be '
charged with the administration of the j
Independent Study Plan for Upper Di-j
vision students under such rules and
regulations as may be approved by the !
Executive Committee and the Academic |
Council.
(2) The various schools and depart
ments are authorized to outline general
fields open to independent study. A
field of study shall, for purposes of reg-1
Istration, be held as accounting for
cither ten or fifteen units per quarter
according to the extent of the work to
he pursued.
For purposes of record, and in ful
fillment of the one hundred and eighty
units required for graduation, a field of
study completed with a grade lower
than "B" shall count as either ten or
fifteen units per quarter as the case may
he; completed with a grade of "B" as
either eleven or seventeen units; com
pleted with a grade of "A" as either
thirteen or twenty units.
(3) Students who have completed
two or more years of work (at least one
>-ear of which must ordinarily have
been done at Stanford) with an average
grade not lower than "B," or who are
recommended by three or more in
structors as especially qualified to do
independent work, may apply to the
standing academic committee for the
privilege of working under the inde
pendent study plan.
Number of Students Restricted
For the present the number of stu
dents permitted to enroll under the in
dependent study plan shall be limited
to a small percentage of the Upper Di
vision students registered as majors in
the schools and departments con
cerned. (From sto 10 per cent is sug
gested as an initial maximum).
(4) Students who enroll under the
independent study plan shall be free
from the usual requirement of class at
tendance. class examinations, and the
like, in the fields of study covered.
(But if University credit is desired in a
particular course, all of the regular re
quirements of the course must be met.)
(5) Each student enrolled under the
independent study plan shall, with the
approval of the committee and of the
school or department concerned, choose
as his adviser a member of the faculty,
whose duty it shall be to assist him in
the organization of the plan of study
and to direct and supervise his work in
accordance with the plan of study duly
approved.
(6) Students enrolled under the inde
pendent study plan who do not show
the ability to profit from the work un
dertaken may be required by the com
mittee to withdraw at any time. Any
students may at the end of the junior
year voluntarily change to the regular
program by giving notice to that effect.

that none of the students have abused it.

Details of Plan

The Independent Study Plan is as :
follows:
(1) A standing academic committee
of five is hereby created which shall be '
charged with the administration of the j
Independent Study Plan for Upper Di-j
vision students under such rules and
regulations as may be approved by the !
Executive Committee and the Academic |
Council.
(2) The various schools and depart
ments are authorized to outline general
fields open to independent study. A
field of study shall, for purposes of reg-1
Istration, be held as accounting for
cither ten or fifteen units per quarter
according to the extent of the work to
he pursued.
For purposes of record, and in ful
fillment of the one hundred and eighty
units required for graduation, a field of
study completed with a grade lower
than "B" shall count as either ten or
fifteen units per quarter as the case may
he; completed with a grade of "B" as
either eleven or seventeen units; com
pleted with a grade of "A" as either
thirteen or twenty units.
(3) Students who have completed
two or more years of work (at least one
>-ear of which must ordinarily have
been done at Stanford) with an average
grade not lower than "B," or who are
recommended by three or more in
structors as especially qualified to do
independent work, may apply to the
standing academic committee for the
privilege of working under the inde
pendent study plan.
Number of Students Restricted
For the present the number of stu
dents permitted to enroll under the in
dependent study plan shall be limited
to a small percentage of the Upper Di
vision students registered as majors in
the schools and departments con
cerned. (From sto 10 per cent is sug
gested as an initial maximum).
(4) Students who enroll under the
independent study plan shall be free
from the usual requirement of class at
tendance. class examinations, and the
like, in the fields of study covered.
(But if University credit is desired in a
particular course, all of the regular re
quirements of the course must be met.)
(5) Each student enrolled under the
independent study plan shall, with the
approval of the committee and of the
school or department concerned, choose
as his adviser a member of the faculty,
whose duty it shall be to assist him in
the organization of the plan of study
and to direct and supervise his work in
accordance with the plan of study duly
approved.
(6) Students enrolled under the inde
pendent study plan who do not show
the ability to profit from the work un
dertaken may be required by the com
mittee to withdraw at any time. Any
students may at the end of the junior
year voluntarily change to the regular
program by giving notice to that effect.
A thousand women turn out for ath
letics at the University of Washington.
A new plan of study for exceptional
students is being considered by the
special commitete of student ability.
In every ordinary college course the
professor must consider primarily the
average student. But the members of
every class vary greatly in ability. This
difficulty has been lessened by the di
vision of the curriculum into Upper
and Lower Divisions, but it is still a
great problem. The student above the
average is usually content with doing
average \\ork because it does not pay
him to do better. At present the gifted
student who realizes his abilities and
wishes to make the best of them is
merely turned loose without the guid
ance and direction necessary to him at
this stage of his development.

Tried in Other Universities

Honor courses, or fields of concen
tration, have been instituted in some
universities to attempt to solve this
problem. According to the report,
1 the idea is to free the superior student
i from the obligation of attendance upon
classes, set papers, and examinations,
from learning things which he already
knows to the end that he may enter
upon a more intensive study of a larger

field where initiative, self-direction, and
a higher type of thinking will be de
veloped.
