# SONGS, DANCES, SKIT IN TWELVE-ACT SCOUT JINX THIS EVENING
## 
### 
Feature headliners of "Cardinal
Capers," the track show, and "Ace
High," the Junior Opera, will repeat
their past successes tonight when they
combine with several off-campus art
ists in the twelve-act Scout Jinx en
tertainment to be given in the Assem

The original Six Peruvian Generals,
the hits of the Opera, will be present

medals, uniforms, and boots. Their
stunt for tonight will be known as
"The Hobos' Parade."

Domestic Comedy Scheduled

The Christopher Morley comedy of
domestic life, "Thursday Evening,"
will be repeated for the Jinx by Mrs.
Buckingham's class in dramatic in
terpretation. The skit is set in the
home of a young married couple on
Thursday evening, the maid's night
off. The two mothers-in-law drop in
for dinner and they are able to recon
cile the newlyweds who, being tired
and irritable, engage in a number of
petty quarrels. The mothers-in-law re
verse tradition and comic stories by
being the most sensible and tolerant
ones.
The parts of husband and wife are
played by Fenton Barrett and Velma
Tenor Will Sing

Randall, who took leading parts in
the Junior Opera. Kathleen Hillis and
Kathryn Peck play the mothers-in-law.
The play was directed by Marjorie
Allen, who will sing her "Mah Jongg"
number from the Junior Opera of a
year ago, assisted by Gladys McLeod
and Alice Dodds.

Elizabeth Crebs and Velma Randall
will be seen in "Two of a Kind," a
song and dance number.
Charles Bulloti, tenor, who often
sings in radio programs and is the
maker of many Victor records, will
sing several numbers, accompanied by
the Morris Club of Palo Alto, a trained
vocal organization. The Morris Club
will also be heard in songs. James G.
Swinnerton, known for his comic strip
of "Little Jimmie," offers a quarter
hour of sketches and humor. Winifred
Estabrook, who has previously ap
peared at Stanford, will have a group
of songs.
Another singing and dancing feature
is "The Queen of Gasoline," from the
track show, with Gardiner Lippincott
and Gerlrurle and Gladys McLeod.
Lippincott will appear again with
Byron Kissinger in the novelty num
ber, "Africa."
Truman Dawns, Phil Brooks, and
Earl May, saxaphone kings, will play
a trio with some close harmony.
All but four of the features are by
campus talent. Tickets are priced at
$1 and may be obtained from the box
office, from Crandall's, or from any
Boy Scout. Profits from the affair are
to be dfvided equally between the
Boy and Girl Scout troops.
