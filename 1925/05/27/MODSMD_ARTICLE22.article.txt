To fulfill a promise of long standing, we are about to write an editorial
on final examinations. The theory of applied principles as well as discreet
industry should be worth a couple of hundred words in any column. And,
as you may know, there are only 179 shopping days left before Christmas.
College is commonly referred to as an opportunity. It is figuratively
spoken of as a banquet board of knowledge. Having banqueted for an
other quarter, it becomes us to take the pills known as Final Examinations
to prove that we have digested our courses.
Wherefore, this column of constructive suggestion offers an editorial
conception of applied economics for the saving of pain. Students have
perhaps noticed that during every lecture there are considerable numbers
of others taking notes at a feverish rate. Although there is a required
economics course which emphasizes the theory of conservation of labor and
recommends expert specialization, the habitual note-takers have failed
to grasp the idea. They simply wrote it down, we guess.
This, in itself, is an indictment against the present system of studying.
Quite by accident, a man once happened to lose his notebook and was forced
to attend the banquet unarmed. He discovered after it was all over that
he understood what was important about the instruction much better for
having associated the professor's comments as they were made. He
learned the principles of conservation of note-taking, at least, and com
menced developing an expert specialization in understanding what pro
fessors consider tasty.

As finals approach, we have a suggestion to make which will be of
mutual benefit to note-takers and specialists. Get together! The special
ists can refresh their memories in about two hours and they can save the
others considerable toil in the same length of time by revealing to them
what it is well to remember and what it is better to cut clear and forget.
Now, the success of any banquet depends upon how interesting and
pleasant the thing is. There are those who insist upon taking their knowl
edge under a sauce of notes. And there are others who like it straight.
We advocate cooperation for the common good.
