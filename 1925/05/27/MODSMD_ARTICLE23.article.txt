No matter how badly the English Department would like to know who
wrote the hand-bill which appeared yesterday, the faculty must remain in
ignorance. On the other hand, whoever the comedian is, he shall probably
never know better than to compose such sentences as, "Do you realize that
today you must pick the man to represent you in the eyes of the world and
at all other social functions."

A canvass of printers on the peninsula brought to light the fact that
the work was done at the plant of the Redwood City Standard at a cost of
$6.50. The identity of the wastrel who is so prodigal with his language
and his money could not be learned definitely.
Don McKay, in whose behalf the leaflet purported to have been printed,
denies any knowledge of the propaganda which he brands as false. He
refers those who believe that he wears no man's collar to his room
mate. Those who were induced by the anonymous bulletin to vote for
McKay he invites to interview him in order that he may set them straight
in time for the next election, a request which seems only fair.

THE ANONYMOUS POSTER author must have been counting
votes yesterday. Thirty votes which had been marked in pencil were
found to have been changed by the eraser method. Since nobody has
been found to who will either take the praise or blame for this, the Elec
tion Board has been forced to rule that all ballots in the second voting be
marked in ink.

Jt seems a shame to have to take all this extra trouble when the elimi
nation of one influence would solve the problem.
