Down a shot to fair Babette.
A clever girl? You needn't fret!
While in my Hup it's something lierce'
To hear how she prefers a Pierce —
And then she eats a ton of chuck
And leaves me flat and out of luck —'
So toss it off to fair Babette.
(And calm down, boy—she'll get hers
yet!) —L. A. B.

A young undergrad named DeLay
Grew wearier day after day—
He said, "Let me sleep,
"Ambition will keep—
"I'd much rather hit than cut hay!"
—L. A. B.
