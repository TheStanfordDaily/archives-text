# THE 						AISLE SEAT
## "BROADWAY BUTTERFLY"â€”STANFORD- 
### 
Ample evidence of the scarcity of
material for moving picture plot is
afforded the innocent spectator by "A
Broadway Butterfly," supposedly fea
turing Cullen Landis and Dorothy
Devore.
Based on the web of stories usually
round around the spectacular rise and
fall of a "Sally," this picture seems to
combine all the faults of the "Unspeak
able Drama" in such a way as to make
one wonder why people wish to sleep
in theatre seats rather than at home.
Cullen Landis, really a talented ac
tor, very efficiently portrays the idle
son of wealth, who, with a couple of
polished and super-duplex "Stage-door
Johnnies" run the local follies. Dorothy
Devore takes the usual cut-and-dried
character of the innocent young girl
who has left Hickville, lured by Broad
way lights. She portrays her part in
the usual manner.
Love at first sight is the result, with
no possible alternative offered the
imagination of the spectator. Of course
there are the usual hindrances of past
loves, jealous chorus girls; but all ends
well, even though the solution taxes
the credulity of the most gullible on
looker.
A couple of wild beer fests staged
by a Bachelors Club enlivens the scene
once in a while, but one leaves the
show with the impression that the
directors and scenario writers would
have done far better if they had ap
propriated the tales of Boccacio, which
are at least humorous.
