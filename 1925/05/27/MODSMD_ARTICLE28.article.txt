Wallace Beery and Raymond Hat
ton make a comedy team that is hard
to beat, and we should like to see them
co-starred in a production. As it is,
they managed to carry away this show
without much difficulty.
As Morgan and Raff, the villainous
traders, they make villainy tremen
dously humorous—Beery with his "I
alius was a ladies' man," and Hatton
as his monkey-faced partner. Perhaps
their villainy seems less treacherous
because they are so stupid as to think
the ability to play poker depends on
the knowledge that three of a kind
beats two pair.
Outside of these two the cast was
not particularly brilliant, though both
Tom Moore and Pauline Starks give
the ordinary sort of performance. But
we do hate to see a girl try to act
hard-boiled when she looks far from
being so. Again, the promiscuous fir
ing of revolvers is both wasteful and
foolish.
Jack London's story, which is used
as the basis of the picture, iB enter
taining, though at times rather far
fetched. Notwithstanding, one likes it.
Sickness on South Sea plantation
(we have yet to discover what they
planted), arival of beautiful girl out
for adventure, saving of owner from
fever, entertaining purchase of half
interest in plantation by girl, hero
signs agreement not to mention love
to girl, arrival of gentleman-adven
turer, mix-up general, and the grand
finale when the girl returns the prom
ise to the hero.
All this might not be much without
Beery and Hatton. But we enjoyed the
picture. —D. T. R.
