# Red Tower On Page Mill Road Is Relic In University History
## 
### Monroe Eaton 
A local landmark that arouses prob
ably more wonder and conjecture than
any other is the strange red brick
round tower on the Page Mill road
near the southern boundary of the
campus. A closer scrutiny of this part
of the campus will also reveal several
other interesting structures. Among
these are three or four low-roofed red
shanties in College Terrace between
the University and Mayfield, the Es
condite Cottage with its peculiar
tower, and a brick footbridge with
apparently no stream to cross.
All of these structures were built
by the same person, a Frenchman
whose name was Peter Coutts. This
romantic character of the days before
the University was founded, came to
Mayfield in 1874. He bought a large
tract of land near the Stanford farm
and set about to make elaborate im
provements. He built the Escondite
Cottage for a temporary home and
also several huge red barns which
have been destroyed. His wife and
family joined him shortly after his ar
rival.

Coutts Eccentric Character

Peter Coutts was a strange man. He
was handsome, rich, and well edu
cated, but somewhat eccentric. The
fact that he had a huge black bull
which he delighted to address as
"Monsieur le Curate" indicates that
he was athcistic. His military bearing
hinted of service in an army, probably
in the Franco-Prussian war.
Just why he came to California is
not definitely known. It is believed,
however, that he had absconded with
a large amount of money from the
French treasury, and was seeking
refuge in this distant part of the
world. The fact that a shortage of
$5,000,000 in the treasury funds oc
curred simultaneously with his disap
pearance from France would point to
his guilt, but it was never definitely
proven that he took the money. He
transacted all his business and held
all his property in the name of his
governess. His chief concern seemed
to be to spend money as rapidly as
possible. It is estimated that he spent
$40,000 a year for improvements.

Tower Built as Refuge

In 1880 he went to London, and,
since the French government stopped
all efforts to capture him, he was
seemingly pardoned. In 1882 he went
with his family to France for a visit
and never returned. Little is known
of his later life except that he died in
1894 and was buried in France. His
estate was sold to Senator Stanford
soon after he left in 1882.
The tower on the Page Mill road is
the most striking reminder of the
Frenchman. It is about fifty feet high,
fifteen feet in diameter, built of red
brick with three gothic windows. It is
said that it supported a water tank
but it is also suspected that Coutts'
ulterior motive in building the tower
was for a sronghold against his perse
cutors. The only entrance is by an
underground passage, now partly
caved in, whose mouth is a hundred
and fifty yards from the tower. The
loop-holded parapet at the top of the
tower indicates that it was intended
for a fortress.
Escondite Cottage, which stands in

College Terrace, about three blocks
past Branner hall, is still used as a
private residence. The tower on the
house seems to have been intended
as a lookout.

Peter Coutts evidently planned to
erect a chateau on the double hill at
the end of Lasuen street. The outline
of the road winding up the side of
the knoll may still be perceived. At
the top, a row of cypress marks the
location of his intended castle.

Made Artificial Lake

At the base of the hill was an arti
ficial lake. The miniature islands and
terraces are now in ruins, and the
dry bed of the lake is used for a
dumping ground. Only the arched
bridge over the inlet stream stands
to mark the position of the once beau
tiful lake.
Peter Coutts searched several years
for a source of water for his lake. He
drove tunnels in six directions before
he finally struck water. The mouth of
the last tunnel may still be seen fifty
yards beyond the lake.
A book in the reference room of the
library entitled "First Days at Stan
ford" contains the life history of Peter
Coutts and his strange projects.
