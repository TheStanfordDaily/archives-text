### 
Shaw's comedy of the American Revo
lution, "The Devil's Disciple," originally
written for the late Richard Mansfield,
will be presented under the auspices of
the Palo Alto Community Players, by
the actors and actresses of the Berkeley
Playhouse, on Friday evening, May 29.
at the Stanford Assembly Hall. Irving
Pichel is cast in the leading role as the
hero, Dick Dudgeon.
Aside from its rapid, almost melo
dramatic action, "The Devil's Disciple"
is highly entertaining, as are all of
Shaw's comedies, and presents a more
than casual picture of Puritan New Eng
land. Mrs. Dudgeon, played by Minctta
Ellen, is so completely of her time and
environment that she seems the creation
of one who has lived in and intimately
known her New England.
