# POLO ORGANIZATION SHOWS GROWTH OF SPORT AT STANFORD
## Card Four Ends Successful Season With Western Collegiate Title 
### Douglas Meservey 
Polo, of little interest at Stanford
until last year, has now taken its place
with any of the other minor sports in
prominence.
A criterion of the interest it now
holds is the rapid growth of the newly
formed Stanford Polo Association, to
gether with the size of the varsity
squad . During the spring of 1924, but
twelve men were practicing for the
Card team. Two weeks ago, when the
O. A. C. contest at Corvallis officially
closed the season, 57 men were on the
squad.

Jenkins Stimulates Interest

Captain J. M. Jenkins, coach of the
Card four, was largely responsible for
the greater interest shown and has in
corporated a number of changes in the
Stanford method of play.
As an example of the success of the
Cardinal team, it has been pointed out
that they have played fifteen games,
winning eight and losing sevenâ€”a per
centage of .533. Ninety-two goals were
scored by Stanford and ninety by the
apposing teams.

Cards Coast Champions

By three victories over the O. A. C.
four, the Cards won the Pacific Coast
championship besides wins over Ari
zona, San Mateo Polo Club, Santa Cruz
Polo Club, and the Thirtieth Infantry.
An attempt was also made by Captain
Jenkins to form an intercollegiate sec
tion in the annual Del Monte tourna
ment but the university polo move
ment on the coast is yet too young for
such a section.
Thirty horses were used this season
although only twelve were trained well
enough for constant use. Fifteen more
of better" caliber are expected for the
squad next season, which fact Captain
jenkins believes will improve the play
ing ability of his men.

Trotter Is Star

Utah and Arizona are the only south
ern colleges recognizing polo, but be
ing so far distant, Stanford has had no
competition with the former and little
with Arizona.
Captain Laub led the Stanford team
during the 1924-25 season. Captain
elect Trotter, who has a bne-goal handi
cap in the American Polo Association,
was the star of the year with thirty
three goals while Thomas was second
with eighteen.
Freshman material was abundant
this season and Captain Jenkins be
lieves that it will form the nucleus of a
fast second team next year with a num
ber of 1927 men on the first string.
Among those showing promise were
Duval, Hollinsworth, Smith, Connolly,
Kenaston, and Collins.

A chapter of Hammer and Coffin
honorary society of publications men
was established at Cornell.
