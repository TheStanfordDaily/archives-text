# H. H. BLEE DESCRIBES PAST AND PRESENT OF BALLOON DESIGN

"Dirigible balloons are today a safe,
reliable, time-saving means for long,
non-stop flights. They and the airplane
will divide between them the field of
commercial aviation," said Colonel H.
H. Wee in a talk on "The Development
of Balloons and Dirigibles and Their
Place in Commercial Aeronautics"
given in the Little Theatre yesterday
afternoon.
Blee holds a- lieutenant-colonelcy in
the Air Service Reserve and is a li
censed spherical balloon and dirigible
pilot.
His lecture was illustrated through
out with slides which showed the his
tory of lighter-than-air craft from the
days of the first construction by the
Montgolfler brothers in France in 1753
of a huge paper bag filled with hot
uir to the latest rigid motor-driven
monster with a gas capacity of 5,000,-
000 cubic feet and a cruising radius
of several thousand miles.
Blee stated: "Much of the present
knowledge of meteorological condi
(ions have been gained from the use
of free or motorless balloons which
ascend to great heights, carrying with
them recording instruments of all
borts. The weather man and the bal
loon pilot work hand in hand, for the
ballonist must have a complete knowl
edge of conditions at various altitudes
before attempting an ascent."

Dirigibles built on the order of the
"Shenandoah" and the "Los Angeles"
represent the type along which future
developments will almost certainly be
made. England is at present building
two such ships, each with a capacity
of 5,000,000 cubic feet of gas.

It is planned to start a service from
England to Australia, going by way of
England and India. Spain has plans
for a line to South America, and it is

proposed to have an organization oper
ating dirigibles between San Francisco
and the Philippines via Hawaii. Pas
sengers will be able to travel with
comfort and even luxury. More space
is provided for them than in the avei'-
age Pullman car or ocean liner.
