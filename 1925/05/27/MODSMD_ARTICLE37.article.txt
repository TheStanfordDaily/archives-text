# ELECTRIC COMPANIES GIVE STANFORD HIGH VOLTAGE LABORATORY
## 
### 
A new high-voltage laboratory is to
be donated to Stanford University by
prominent electric companies of the
country in appreciation of the work
which Dr. Harris J. Ryan, head of the
Deaprtment of Electrical Engineering,
has done for the electrical industry.
A two-million volt testing set valued
at $105,000 has been contributed al
ready by the General Electric Com
pany, while the Pacific Gas & Electric
Company has presented a check for
$50,000. Other gifts are expected to
bring the total up to half a million
dollars.
The new laboratory, to be known as
"The Harris J. Ryan Laboratory," will
be built in the valley between Pine
Hill and the Mayfield reservoir, near
Frenchman's Dam. The equipment of
the present laboratory near the wo
men's gymnasium will be moved to
the new site.
The testing set for the new labora
tory is the largest ever made, and in
cludes six transformers, two motor
generator sets, and a switchboard. It
will enable the solution of high vol
tage transmission problems which are
of importance in power development.
Dr. Ryan has been a leader in the
field of high voltage experiment and
discovery for more than twenty years.
The development of the present type
of insulator for high-power lines, per
fection of a high-voltage wattmeter
being carried on at present, with an
electron jet recorder are some of the
achievements of Dr. Ryan in this line.
Joseph C. Carroll has co-operated with
Dr. Ryan in some of the work.
