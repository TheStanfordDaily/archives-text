# M'DOWELL LECTURES ON "STANFORD GRAD"
## 
### 
j "What Happens to a Stanford Grad" j
| will be the subject of a talk to be 1
'given tonight at 7:30 in the Trophy
Room of the Old Union by J. E. Mc
! Dowell, Alumni Secretary, at an open
i meeting of the Euphronia Society.
Mr. McDowell is especially compe- j
tent to speak on this subject, since as
Alumni Secretary he keeps in close
touch with all Stanford graduates. The
question is pertinent because of the
nearness of graduation.
Following his talk, an open forum '
discussion will be held on the general
problem. It is expected that the dis-j
cussion will be held on the general \
problem. It is expected that the dis-!
cussion will resolve into one concern
ing the purpose of a college education,
and how Stanford graduates compare
with those of other institutions.
A business meeting and tryouts for
membership will be held following the
discussion. All those desiring to be- ;
come members of the Euphronia So- !
ciety must attend two meetings of the
organization, and at one of these speak
| for five minutes or under on any sub
ject they wish.
Those desiring to try out are re-
I quested to communicate as soon as j
I possible with the secretary of the so-
I ciety, H. W. Peterson, or with the j1
president, W. L. Gosslin.
This is the fourth of a series of five
open forums being sponsored this i
quarter by the Euphronia Society for
discusing problems of interest. The
next and last will be held June 3, on
the subject of the place of the Y. M.
C. A. and Y. W. C. A. on the Stanford
campus.
The meeting tonight is open to all.
