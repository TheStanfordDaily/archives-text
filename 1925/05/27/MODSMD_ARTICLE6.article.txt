# VIOLIN, PIANO SOLOS GIVEN IN PROGRAM BY STANFORD MUSICIANS
## 
### 
Stanford students of musical talent
gave a pleasing recital under the aus'
pices of the Stanford Music Club last
night in the Assembly Hall.
The piano solos were especially good.
"Fantasie Impromptu" by Chopin,
played by Miss Viva Drew at the open
ing of the program, was charmingly
executed, as was "Chanson Hongroise"
by Dupont which was played by Miss
Helen Carpenter. "Polonaise Ameri
caine" by Carpenter, was interesting in
its unusual mood. This was also played
by Miss Carpenter.
Of the songs "Roses in June" which
was sung by Miss Margery Black
welder accompanied by Miss Pierce on
a violin and Miss Maria Anderson at
the piano, was perhaps the most enthu
siastically received.
"The Viking Song" by Coleridge-
Taylor was sung by W. E. e√üach ac
son. This song was particluarly well
suited to Beach's voice and was well
companied at the piano by Miss Ander
received.
R. A. Hefner played "Viennese Pop
ular Song" by Kricsler, and "From the
Canbrake" by Gardner. The latter was
an old Indian melody and was particu
larly effective.
