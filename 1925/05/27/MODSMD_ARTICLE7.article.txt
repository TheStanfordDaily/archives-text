# SIXTH HORSE SHOW PLANNED FOR JUNE 6
## 
### 
Drawings for horses to be used for
the sixth annual military horse show
and tournament sponsored by the
Stanford R. O. T. C. were made this
afternoon. Intensive training for the
various events on the program for
Saturday, June 6, will now begin. Ac
cording to P. R. Hurley, chairman of
the committee, every effort will be
made to afford the public one of the
most interesting displays of horseman
ship ever offered on the campus.
Although seventy horses are used
by the military department, not all of
these are suitable as mounts for the
special events scheduled on the pro
gram. As a result, further eliminations
in the contestants will be made in the
near future.
Arrangements have been made so
that representatives from the Mon
day and Thursday classes will oppose
each other in the mounted wrestling
and tug of war. Considerable rivalry
has been shown by these two classes.
The field will be put into condition
this week, thus enabling the partici
pants to practice their events. Judges
and prizes for the horse show have
not been selected.
The committee appointed is as fol
lows: P. R. Ilurley, chairman; H. L.
Hjelm, H. W. Schmid, H. K. Dom
baugh, A. F. Weaver, W. R. Noack,
H. B. Price, G. C. Barnes, G. C. Baker,
F. E. Trotter, W. C. Wolf, E. W. Laub,
E. Adams, J. B. Cooper, J. B. Dorcy,
G. A. Burton.
