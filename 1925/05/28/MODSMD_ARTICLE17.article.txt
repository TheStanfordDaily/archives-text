# North Weak on Field
## 
### 
In the field events the northern
members of the Conference seem to
be comparatively weak. Captain Hart
ranft, and Hoffman, the Stanford en- 1
tries in the shot and discus will prob
ably have little competition as they
are by far the best on the coast. Cap
tain Egtvet of Washington will be the
outstanding competitor of the Cards in
these two events, although his marks |
of 44 feet and 132 feet cannot com- i
pare to those of Hartranft and Hoff
man. In practice, Thursday, Hoffman
put the shot 47 feet 10 inches and the
discus 149 feet. Hartranft's record in
the shotput is 50 feet 11% inches, and
157 feet 3 1-8 inches in the discus
throw.
Miller and Richardson of Stanford
will probably have it easy in both the
440- and 880-yard runs. Applegate of
Washington and Ritter of Montana
will give them a good race in the 440.
The northern entrants in the mile
relay are weak, with the exception of
a few good quarter-milers from Wash
ington.
