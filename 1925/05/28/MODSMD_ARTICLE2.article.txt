# Aileene Burks in Play
## 
### 
The entire cast for the latter play
was as follows: Mary Davis, Aileene

Burks; Tom Davis, Harold Harvey;
Ann Davis, Eleanor Davidson; Mrs.
Airy, Gwendoyn Mac-Govern; Bill Airy,
Fenton Barrett.
"The Eternal Girl," an amusing bit
of comedy, takes place in heaven
where, in spite of the length of St.
Peter's whiskers, business is very
regular until the entrance of Bernice.
The eternal girl, evidently quite a
flapper if one may believe Katheryn
Peck's interpretation of the part, turns
St. Peter out of his place to interview
her two suitors.
J. W. Shoup, as the ardent poet,
wore his maroon jacket as if he were
used to it, to say nothing of the in
triguing curls on his noble brow. But
the other suitor, Jack Bernard, played
by Harold Harvey, is ready to follow
Bernice to the nether regions. All of
which proves, or at least insinuates,
that college men may have some good
intentions after all.
Barbara Probasco, as the haughty
Mrs. Smythe ("Smythe, not Smith, if
you please!") handled her lorgnette
very gracefully.
The play was directed by Grace
Reade and the stage manager was F.
E. Drake.
"Mary's Wedding," although it is a
well-constructed drama, was rendered
difficult by its dialect and tragedy.
Mr. and Mrs. Davis, the parents of
Mary, are very realistically portrayed.
Aileene Burks, as usual, carries her
part well.
Evelyn Van Horn was the stage
manager, and D. H. Alden the pro
ducer.
