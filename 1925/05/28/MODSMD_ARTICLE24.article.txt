# The 						Pink
## 
### 
The old story that "men must work, and women must weep," has been
reversed again. After the pitiful howl which our brother journalists let
forth yesterday when relinquishing their work and titles (especially titles),
the women arrived on the scene, and following the ideal of saying it "with
flowers," sat down at typewriters, produced long-suppressed ideas, strained
capabilities to the utmost, and brought forth The Pink of Perfection.
That is the name of our edition, not a slogan. We dislike slogans, but we
had to decide on the variety of the blossoms scattered throughout these
pages. Part of what we have written is serious, and the rest is natural.
W ; ith this warning, we leave you to your discrimination. "Take each man's
censure, but reserve thy judgment."
