Women of the University are gathering in preparation for Field Day,
the one big event for the feminine athlete. Tomorrow's program includes
about one-third of the five hundred, and under the influence of such de
lightful factors as awards and barbecue food, we gain just one more pleas
ant memory of Stanford.
With the old Roble gymnasium as a background that is taken for
granted, we will thoroughly enjoy the day. But casting aside our blind,
accustomed stupor, we see that the gymnasium directors need new equip
ment, and new buildings. We realize that strangers looking coldly at our
training grounds must think, "H'm, earthquake?" and then we recall that
woodpeckers have as much use from the frame structures as we have, and
we really are entitled to more. Who will pay attention to the women's
needs? We're getting an enlargement of the stadium, and in the first place,
we have a stadium —let us provide for women's equipment half as well.
May the next endowment be dedicated to our cause.
