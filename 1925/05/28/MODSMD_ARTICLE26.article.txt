# One at a Time

### 
Sending our first string track men to the Pacific Coast Conference is
just another indication that we believe in doing things well. Last year,
Stanford was represented in two meets, and took third place in each. This
year, the Cardinal is expending all efforts on Pacific Coast championships
before going forth to other fields, and with our stars united for victory,
and the cheers of the student body sent in one direction, our team should
gain fame and bring home more distinction than ever before.
