# That Reserved Book
## 
### 
Finals are approaching. Suddenly we remember term papers and ex
aminations. But if we want a book reserved for a large class, we haven't
the privilege of using it on Sunday, if someone else takes it out Saturday
and chooses to keep it the allotted time. This day of peace may easily be
come a time of torture, if we reflect on the disadvantages of not studying
what others already have available. Let us regard Sunday as another day
in the Library, as long as it is open for study. If a student has foresight
enough to take out his book Saturday at 5 o'clock, let him have the privilege
of keeping it until Sunday at 2. Why should he have it until Monday at
9? We object: we have too many books to read, and not enough money
to buy them.
