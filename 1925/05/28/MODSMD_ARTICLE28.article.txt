# Summer Quarter
##

v
Get University credit for attending a summer resort. That is, accord
ing to all reports, the joy of attending summer school this year. With
promises of sports, good times â€”and the best of professors, we are enticed
to remain here for the next three months. For those who want to finish
college as soon as possible, for those to whom the leisure of vacation is a
ghastly bore, and for those who need less than the allotted three months to
recuperate from a year of study, there is no better way of spending the
time.
