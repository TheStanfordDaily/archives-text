The Editor, Sir:
At Stanford this year a new system is
being tried out as to the care and treat
ment of the freshman students. We all
know what the system is, so there is no
need of explaining it here.
The system may be all right as far as
the caring for the freshman goes, but
what is happening to the wonderful Stan
ford traditions that have taken years to
build up? They are not being respected
and obeyed, and consequently many of
them are dying.
How many freshmen are seen wearing
"dinks" these days? Very few. It has
even come to the point where some fresh
men look down upon their loyal class
mate who docs wear his "dink." The
freshmen cannot be blamed, for it is in
evitable that this will happen if the
upperclassmen do not have the power to
enforce the traditions. It is the same
with the other traditions that freshmen
are supposed to uphold—such as saying
"hello," and smoking corn-cob pipes.
Today freshmen at Stanford think they
are just as good as any other student of
the school. This is the wrong attitude,
because freshmen should be made to re- .
spect the upperclassmen. It is only nat-1

Ural that they feel this way, however,
because the administration, by its new
system of caring for the freshmen, has
taken away from the uppcrclassmen
every possible means possessed of mak
ing freshmen appreciate coming to Stan
ford.
Why have such a radical system? The
freshmen do not want it. They would
much rather have the good old times
the freshmen of former years had in
fighting with the sophomores, and being
under the discipline laid down by the
uppcrclassmen. The uppcrclassmen do not
I approve of it, because it makes the fresh-
I men too "cocky." We have it because it
j is imposed upon us by the administration.
Students of Stanford, let's endeavor to
| have this system changed.
A Frosh.
