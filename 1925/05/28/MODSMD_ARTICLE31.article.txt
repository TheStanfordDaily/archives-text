No longer do we write the word \
"homely" before the name of Cabbages.
Cabbage is a royal vegetable whether it
wears the rough or not.
* * *
Interfraternity Council has an
nounced that all women will be pro
hibited from interfering with men's
pledging.
• * *
At any rate men's rushing has some
advantages over women's when they
can play ball, and throw things at the
rushees —and the rushees can play ball
too!
♦ * *
This awful rush- We wish it would
last longer. We like these week-end
dates. *
♦ * *
The younger generation, though !
they may imitate the "diamond in the
rough," are strict in showing their ;
seniors the road to virtue —otherwise, j
why did some of our best rushees sud
denly leave "a certain" well-laden din-1
ner table last Sunday?
* * *
A word to the Kappa Sigs: Don't be j
congenial to the extent of allowing the,
freshmen to take your best pictures l
from the wall. Proof of your Block "S"
men is a strong point.
* * *
We find the manly quality of solici
tude for the weaker sex one of the
traits in the Phi Delt house. These i
young men worry over the kind of,
dessert their neighbors are treated to,'
even more than Cabbages worried
about Encina hall and, more than that
—they fear for themselves.
* * *
The Betas have taken up ping-pong.
Freshmen, you're being under-rated.
* * *
Join the navy, or be a Fiji. It's all
the same with the new aquaplane.
* * *
It is better to have one friend than
lots of freshman relatives —ask the i
Delta Taus.
♦ * *
Dedicated to the rest of the rushing
houses —"We knew too much!"
* * <¥
Just a bit of publicity for our modest
office violet —ho is quiet, unassuming,
smokes big cigars unobtrusively, and
sings all songs with a Swedish accent
he learned a year ago.
* * *
Our "tennis dancers" have started
working out by one good preliminary
round in the hills.
* * *
Our Old Boy in all of his queries,
of Why a chicken crosses a road, and
Why a man's wife is not a lady, has
forgotten to inquire Why men go to
the city at least twice a week. But
maybe he thinks we know her.

Will the title of "Student Manager"
always fit so well, and so literally?
* * «
Place: Roughs' Roost.
Time: 8 a.m.
The baron enters, attired in tuxedo.
Waiter —Breakfast, sir?
Baron —No, just Lavoris.
The above scene was reproduced to
prove to the public that the baron
still guards his voice with care. He
continues to sing for the prominent
patrons of the Cardinal hotel on Sat
urday nights. All of which shows what
Junior Opera training will do for one.
But must he keep Moreno's accent?
* * *
"Lessons in Grace," title of the new
book to be published jointly by the
men's chorus of the Junior Opera.
♦ * *
Our king of the Masque Ball proved
a sad exception to a rule, and was
dignified.
* * *
We wish that the business manager
of a humorous magazine would not
take the privilege of attempting humor
himself.
* * *
It is rumored that the Theta Delta
have angelic visions at night.
* * *
Our last year's editor has finally be
stowed on a woman the honor of
being the first to tell him something
he did not already know. To lose char
acter and position so completely seems
a pity to us who knew him in his
glory.
* * *
Men divide girls into two classes:
those who wear large hats to the Cardi
nal, and those who don't.
* * *
"Hold that line!" is advice that has

| been accepted by others than athletes.
* * #
We offer our sincere sympathies to
| Charles Pape, the eminent artist, who
expects to roll logs with future Presi
dents of the United States, by sticking
j around college campuses. Let us sug
! gest that he choose another locality,
1 if he is serious in his project.

Golf knickers are getting so com
: mon, that they don't even deserve
' mention.
