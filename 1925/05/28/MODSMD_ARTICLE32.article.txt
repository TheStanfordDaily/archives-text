# Pink Trousers Reported Latest Whim of Fickle Sex in European Cities

Men are displaying pink trousers
on the boulevards of Paris, and in
London, the Earl of Westmoreland
sponsoring the wearing of red and
brown for men, according to a re
cent dispatch from abroad.
The above dispatches were fol
lowed immediately by notes in
"modes and models" stating that
women were to wear light colors
this spring.
It appears that the predominance
of light colors this spring can thus
be directly traced to the influence
of men who, realizing that with wo
men's imitation of their clothes,
they must meditate deeply on their
every prediction, gave out the fol
lowing information:
"Never before has color entered
so largely into the masculine sar
torial scheme but today it is a vital
factor in the development of cur
rent styles, and is recognized as an
integral part of the correct clothes
of this season."
