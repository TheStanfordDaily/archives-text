## THE 						MOTHER'S RECOMPENSE 
### Edith Wharton 
(Courtesy of Paul Elder)
In spite of the fact that this is Edith
Wharton, there is very little to be said
about the book. And the less said the
better. It is difficult to believe that the
author of such fine studies in cliarac-i
ter as "Ethan Frome," "The House of
Mirth," or even "Fruit of the Tree,";
is degenerating into melodrama and
sentimentality.
Rut she is. "The Mother's Recom
pense" contains a powerful situation,!
but one that must be treated too dra
matically. There is no way out of it;
one realizes that from the beginning,
but it is not worthy of Edith Wharton.
As always, she moves only in the
upper classes, and whatever ill fortune!
may overtake her characters, nothing i
so bourgeois as mere finances ham
pers them.
Kate Clephane, the mother, returns
to her daughter after almost twenty
years' absence from her, and by a
strange coincidence, finds her former
lover courting her daughter. Yes, the
movies will undoubtedly purchase the
rights for "The Mother's Recompense," 1
if they have not done so already.
