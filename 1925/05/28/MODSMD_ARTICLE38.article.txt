## Women Expected to Shatter Some University Track Records Tomorrow 
### 
Results of the women's preliminary
track meets and work-outs predict a fast
Field Day meet tomorrow morning. The j
women have shown promise of good
work, and some University rccords will

week. Juniors and seniors made creditable |
showings, although their small numbers :
prevented their having practice meets.
Bernice Chase, sophomore captain, and
Dorothy Fordyce, freshman runner, have
made the best times on the track. Miss I
Fordyce ran the 50-yard dash in 6 4/5
seconds in the freshman practice meet,
and is cxpected to better this mark to
morrow. Elizabeth Bakewell, captain of
the freshmen, docs well in the 50, and
Fay Hamilton, another first-year woman,
gave Miss Fordyce a good fight for the
75 in the preliminary meet. Nellie Shep
herd, of the sophomore team is another
fast runner.
Two sophomores, Marie Manchee and
Frances Gooden, arc possible winners in
the low hurdles. Both have beaten Miss
Fordyce in practice. Lois Wilbur, junior,
and Carol Davis, senior, will also have
to be reckoned with in both the low and
