# WOMEN HAVE MORE SPECIALS THAN MEN
## 
### 
Women receive more special deliv
eries and packages than do men, ac- j
cording to officials in the campus post
office. At the beginning of the month
the number of special delivery letters
received by the women is very large.
The number drops as the month goes
on, then rises suddenly at the end of
the month. Women are slower because
no matter what day it is they always
have letters to mail after the mails !
have closed.

Freshman women receive and send
as many letters as the other three
classes put together. As they go on
through college their correspondence
drops until in their last year they re
ceive very little mail, according to the
postoffice authorities.
