# POINT SYSTEM WILL BE CONSIDERED BY WOMEN NEXT YEAR
## New Plan to Be Submitted at Assembly Combines Desired Features 
### 
Consideration of the point system
for women will be one of the problems
to be taken up by Associated Women
next year, according to Mildred Wors
wick, president for the coming year.

Although the point system was tried
out at Stanford for men's activities,
and was discarded as unsuccessful, a
new plan, combining various desirable
features which have already been
tried in other universities, will be sub
mitted to the women for consideration
at an assembly to be held early in the
fall quarter.

The point system has for its purpose
the encouragement of a greater num
ber of women taking part in the ac
tivities of the University.

According to the general conception
of the plan, each woman is allotted a
certain number of points at the begin
ning of the quarter, and she must con
fine her major positions and member
ship in various organizations to the
limits of the points she is allowed.

For example: each woman might be
allotted thirty points for a quarter.
Major offices, such as president of a
large organization, would count twen
ty points, thus leaving her ten points
to allow membership in other activi
ties.

The exact system which is to be
proposed at Stanford has not yet been
entirely worked out, but it will be com
pleted during the summer in order to
be ready for submission to Associated
Women in the fall.
