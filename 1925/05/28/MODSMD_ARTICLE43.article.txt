# DEAN LAUDS WOMEN'S SPONSOR SYSTEM AS SUCCESS
## 
### 
"The outstanding feature of the year
has been the real success of the sponsor
system," said Miss Mary Yost, dean of
women in an interview yesterday.
"Made up of university women who
consider the university as a whole, rather
than any small group, the sponsors did
splendid work with the newcomers," she
continued.
"They were a great help at the first
of the year, not only to the new women,
but as an aid to the new social director
in the re-organization of Roble, and they
have continued in this capacity all year.
"A scientific report of the work of the
year, with interesting and valuable sug
gestions for the new sponsors, was sub
mitted by them at the end of their term,"
she said.
The success of the sponsor system for
women has been demonstrated in the one
year of experimentation at Roble. Spon
sors for men at Encina have been used
for two years.
Women's sponsors are nominated by
the living groups, selected by Council,
and confirmed by Miss Yost and Presi
dent Wilbur.
For the past year the sponsors were:
Doris Swayze, head sponsor, Pauline
Hoffmann, Mary Hull, Meribeth Camer
on, Margaret Watson, Mabel McKibbin,
Ellen Callander, Anna Fitzhugh, Jennie
Petersen, Alice Dodds, Beatrice Brails
ford, and Helen Lewis.
Carolan Strouse, president of Associ
ated Women for the past year, also at
tributed the success of the year to the
sponsor system, and characterized it as
a "howling success."
