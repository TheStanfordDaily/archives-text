# Thick, Juicy Steaks Find Favor of Stanfordites; Fish Is Unpopular Dish
## 
### 
Stanford men are red-blooded meat
eaters â€”if statistics from the dining hall
management can be considered proof.
While a six-ounce steak is more than
sufficient for a Roble woman, men in the
halls are scarcely satisfied with one
weighing eight ounces. Women are
served chicken twice a week; men have
it but once. The reason is that men eat
twice as much at one meal. Men also
cat twice the amount of potatoes con
sumed by women.
Artichokes are unpopular becausc men
haven't the patience to eat them, and men
refuse to consider salad as the main
course for a meal. Both men and women
are very fond of milk and cocoa, and
prefer them to tea and coffee. Brown
and raisin breads are liked better than
white bread by both men and women.
Fish is an unpopular food on the Stan
ford campus.
