# DEBT ON CLUBHOUSE SHRINKS TO $15,000
## 
### 
Twenty-five thousand dollars of the
original debt on the Women's Club
house will have been paid off by the
end of next month. This leaves $15,000
yet to be paid.
Payment of the debt is being con
ducted by the women of the Univer
sity working through their organiza
tions.
Cap and Gown has charge of a box
in the Bookstore in which certificates
from purchases are placed. The an
nual rebate from these is paid into the
Clubhouse Fund. Gifts from the Y. W.
C. A., Faculty Club, Alumni, and other
women's organizations form a large
part of the total. The University trus
tees have agreed to turn over to the
Clubhouse one dollar from the fees
collected from women students. This
brings in about $1650 a year. The in
come from other sources â€”life mem
bership, rents, donations, benefits,
piano rents, etc., bring almost this
much more. This income is used for
running expenses of the Clubhouse.
The care and management of the
building and grounds are in the hands
of the Stanford Women's Club, an
organization incorporated in 1910 by
a group of alumnae. Membership in
the club is open to all women.
The service rendered by the Club
house to the University community
is extensive. All women's organiza
tions connected with the University
are given free use of the building. At
the present time practically all student
organizations having a membership of
both men and women hold meetings
there.
