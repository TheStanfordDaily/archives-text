# TWENTY YEARS AFTER in the DAILY PALO ALTO

Professor E. Z. Lightweight, of the
' Research department, in starting his
class work concerning food consumed by
Stanford students in 1925, finds that the
average person weighed between 100 and
200 pounds.
This, according to Professor Light
weight, was the last year that there were
such heavy people to be seen anywhere
except in circuses. The diet in 1925 was
already being reduced to normal, for it
was in that year that the great saviour,
Dr. Lulu Hunt Peters, published her
book for the salvation of mankind.
In comparison with the ordinary daily
meals consisting of a potato, some cauli
flower, and a chop, now sufficient for the
ordinary man in a day, the idea that the
former diets included a combination of
such foods all in one meal is indeed a
significant discovery.
Bouillon cubes and other forms of con
centrated food were discovered to be an
efficient diet for the people who were
reducing weight, but it was soon found
that the more solid foods above de
scribed were necessary for the proper
jaw action of the normal human being.
Professor Lightweight points with
pleasure to the statistics which show the
dainty figures of the present day man
and woman in comparison with the un
gainly shapes of those in 1925. The
maximum weight of 75 pounds, which is
the average today indicates a greater
ability to move about than the corpulent
figures weighing at least one hundred
pounds in former days.
