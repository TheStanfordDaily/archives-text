# SENIOR BALL DATE CHANGED TO FRIDAY EVENING, JUNE 19
## 
### 
The date of the Senior Ball has been
changed from Monday, June 22, to Fri
day, June 19, because of the plans for
housing the parents of Roble seniors
during Commencement Week, and be
cause registration for the summer
quarter begins on Tuesday, June 23.
These two considerations have been
deemed sufficient to overweight the
desire of the seniors to have the Ball
a climax to Commencement Week,
It has always been the custom to en
tertain the mothers and fathers of
Roble seniors at the hall during the
festivities. This year they will be
housed in C wing of Roble.
