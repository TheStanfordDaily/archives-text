# LUNATIC FRINGE OF MEDICINE DISCUSSED IN JORDAN LECTURE
## 
### 
"There is more money now squan
dered in the United States on foolish
or criminal drugs than on regular
physicians," said Dr. David Starr Jor
dan in his lecture on "The Lunatic
Fringe of Medicine," at his home last
night.
Dr. Jordan traced the development
of medicine from the earliest times
to the present scientific state.
"There are three types of disorders
that can happn to the human ma
chine," said Dr. Jordan. "First, acci
dents, such as falling out of a tree or
breaking a leg; second, poisons of
more or less severity, rattlesnakes,
whiskey, Coca-Cola; and third, infec
tions. This last division includes most
of the diseases.

First Tried to Lose Symptoms

"Tn the early days the practitioners
of medicine tried to get rid of the
disease by getting rid of the symp
toms. The idea of attacking the causes
had not yet occurred to them.
"All through the ages men and wo
men have tried to do their best for
humanity but in ancient times and in
the middle ages it was not easy to
carry on scientific investigation of
any sort."
After the theory of curing disease ;
by getting rid of the symptoms had
gone out another erroneous idea
sprung up. Dr. Jordan said that for a
time it was thought every disease had
its cure. He pointed out that this was
not true in many cases.

Homeopathic Studies Fallacious

Homeopathic medicine started with
the idea of curing by using medicines
which produced like symptoms to the
disease. Although the fallacy of this j
theory has been proved it gave rise
to a branch of the study of medicine
which has much good.
The history of medicine was traced
further in its evolution and Dr. Jordan
concluded his lecture by showing some
of the present-day frauds.
"The government has been diligent;
in tracing down and suppressing these 1
fraudulent patent medicines and cure
alls but they often spring up under
another disguise. Some of them are
perfectly harmless and rather foolish,
but others are criminal in their intent
and result."
Next week Dr. Jordan will talk on
the subject of his career in medicine, i
