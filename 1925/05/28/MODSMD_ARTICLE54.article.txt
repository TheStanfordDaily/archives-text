## 
### 
Of the 2787 men enrolled in the Uni
versity this quarter, 1211 earned a
part or all of their college expenses.
| Of the 500 women enr.) led 109 were
able to help themselÂ»es financially
through employment gained from the
Stanford employment office.
At the present time 128 undergrade
; ate men still have applications on file,
and forty-one undergraduate women
are still seeking employment. Some of
these have received temporary work
earlier in the quarter.
More students seek employment dur
ing the Fall quarter than in either or
the other two, the reason being that
they have plenty of enthusiasm at the
beginning of the year, and also they

learn how to find employment without
the aid of the office. It is true also
that both men and women try to carry
a heavy program during the first two
quarters so that they may "queen"
and go in for activities during the
spring.
