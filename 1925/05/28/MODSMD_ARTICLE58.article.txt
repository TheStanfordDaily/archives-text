Four class championships have now
been decided, and play in the round robin
tournament which was to follow is well
under way. Yesterday the freshmen and
sophomore champions, Lida Rittler and
Laura Gardiner respectively, were deter
mined.
In the semi-finals of the freshman
play, Lida Rittler defeated Carolyn
Shepherd 6-3, 6-2, and Edith Mattson
defeated Evalyn Brown 10-8, 6-1. In the
finals Lida Rittler defeated Edith Matt
son 6-3, 6-1. The sophomore finals were
won by Laura Gardinar when she de
feated Charlotte Lovekin 6-4, 7-5.
The round robin now in play between
the four class winners furnished some
exciting matches. The biggest upset of
the year was the defeat of Jean Ward,
junior champion, by Laura Gardiner,
sophomore, 6-2, 9-7. Lida Rittler gave
Carolan Strouse, senior champion, a good
battle, winning the first set 6-4 and then
dropping the other two 6-2, 6-3. Miss
Strouse also defeated Jean Ward 6-3, 6-1.
Two matches will be played on Field
Day at 10 o'clock. These will be un
doubtedly very good sets, since all four
women are tennis players of no little
ability.
