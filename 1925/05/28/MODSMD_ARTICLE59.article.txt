# WRANGLERS INITIATE FOUR NEW MEMBERS
## 
### 
Wranglers Society initiated Martha
Keller, honorary member, and Beatrice
Flesher, Doris Swayze, Eleanor David
son, active members, at the meeting held
Wednesday evening at the Chi Omega
house.
With the initiation of new members
the society closes its activities for this
year. Since the reformation of the club
last year, when it ceased to be a debating
society and became literary, its object
has been to stimulate interest in current
literature.
Reviews of contemporary fiction have
been the nucleus of the programs. The
program committee is beginning next
year's work early by preparing a book
list for each woman to read during the
summer, in order that in the fall, pro
grams will have a sure basis.
Various speakers, both in the Univer
sity and outside, are being arranged for
by the program committee.

Only three out of every ten fresh
men at the Ohio State University use
tobacco.

Freshmen at Cornell University burn
their class caps on a funeral pyre at the
end of the year.
