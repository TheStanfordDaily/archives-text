# BERKELEY PLAYERS GIVE SHAW DRAMA IN ASSEMBLY HALL
## "Devil s Disciple," Melodama In Ironic Vein, Directed By Irving Pichel 
### 
"The Devil's Disciple," by Shaw, directed
j by Irving Pichel, will be presented by
the Berkeley Players, this evening at
,8:15 in the Assembly Hall.
A melodrama with an ironic vein, the
drama promises to please those who ad
mit the retention of romantic tendencies
j and can overlook the irony. Those who
! don't admit their weakness can pretend
that they are concentrating on the satire.
No less authority than Shaw himself
i acknowledged only a short time ago that
he is "the smartest man in England."
! The long run of "Saint Joan" in New
i York last year is favorable evidence to
back up his statement.
Every element for a D. W. Griffith
â–  heart throb movie is present in "The
! Devil's Disciple," but the treatment of
j the idea will make it worth waiting until
! Saturday to attend the local picture show.
Tickets are on sale at Crandall's.
