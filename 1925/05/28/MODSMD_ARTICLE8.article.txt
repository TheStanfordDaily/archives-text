To the man who started the following custom in the Daily office, a hearty
vote of thanks is due, especially if smoking ever becomes 100 per cent:
Approach anyone. Put one hand softly but steadily on the victim's back,
in order to get the effect of patting. Outstretch the other hand, and murmur
gently, "Have you a cigarette." No question, just a statement. If he hasn't,
go to the next person, and so on, throughout the day, carefully distributing
the favor.
