The association, which is composed of
student presidents and presidents-elect of
Pacific Coast colleges and universities,
meets annually at some university. The
convention was held this year at Stan
ford, where the delegates, twenty in num
ber, were entertained. Meetings were
held during the three days at which ques
tions of import to college students and
student government were discussed.
The following resolution was passed by
the association:
"Investigation of moral conditions of
all major college institutions of the Pa
cific Coast, made by this association, dis
closes the fact that moral laxity in our
universities is in every case dealt with se
verely by both faculty and student com
mittees.
"This association hereby goes on record
as heartily endorsing every move made for
better moral conditions upon the various
campuses. We deplore the undue \nib
licity which is accorded the few instances
of moral laxity which occur. We sin
cerely believe that the press will greatly
aid the cause of education by treating
cases of moral delinquency in accordance
with their relative importance to college
life. We believe that in most cases these
instances of delinquency are the excep
tion and not the rule."
