It has long been the policy of the Daily Palo Alto, as of every other
newspaper, to disregard anonymous utterances. No opinions are worth
more than the persons holding them and their reasons. It is correctly
maintained that when one will not take the responsibility for an expres
sion, his purpose is likely to be contemptible.
The thing about these handbills which sticks in the craw is the fact
that nobody will stand behind the ballyhoo. Whoever has had them
printed has adopted a sneaking method of attack. What has been done
has been done openly. Any debate on the matter should be conducted
similarly.
The Daily does not control the off-campus correspondents. Ihe story
of the election which appeared in the city papers after the Palo Alto Times
had printed it, the Daily reporters could not verify. There was no news
to suppress. The official announcement was presented.
No news has been suppressed, and none will be. If there is any news,
we want it. But we want news, not rumors. If there are any facts which
the staff has overlooked, to inform us of them will be a service greatly
appreciated.
But don't forget to sign your name. Don't send us any more anony
mous handbills.
