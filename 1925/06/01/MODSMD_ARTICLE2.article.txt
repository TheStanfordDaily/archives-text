a total of 33 points.
Yale, last year's winner and the favor
ite this season, finished third with
points while Princeton forced her way to
second place with 29 points.
A well-balanced team gace U. S. C. its
victory. Out of the fourteen men who
qualified, nine men placed in seven events
with four first places.
It was the unexpected victory of Grum
bles of U. S. C. over Scattcrgood of
Princeton that' was largely responsible for
the Trojan win. A change in places
would have made a tie between Princeton
and the southern California'university.

spectacular race of the day with eight of
the best half-milers in the country com
peting. In winning, Marsters of George
town, chalked up the best time of the sea
son with 1:53 5-10 from a standing start.

pected to win the 440, came close to Ted
Meredith's old mark of :47 2-5 with a
•finish in :47 9-10.
Houser of U. S. C. set a new intercol
legiate record in the discus of 150 feet'
2•inches. He was beaten in the shot by
his old rival, Hills, Princeton captain, with
a mark of 49 feet 5 5-6 inches.
