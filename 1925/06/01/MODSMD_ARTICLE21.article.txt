# STUDENTS OFFERED CHANCE TO OBSERVE INDUSTRIAL WORK
## 
### 
An organization in Los Angeles
which is sponsoring a plan known as
the Student Industrial Experience
Group is, through the Y. M. C. A. here,
sending out a call for college students
interested in industrial problems. This
organization is aiming to give college
students a chance to study these prob
lems at first hand, with a view to work
ing out solutions and remedies. The
students will work in various indus
trial plants in Los Angeles, and meet
two or three evenings a week in a
seminar on industrial problems and re
lationships.
All applicants must have had a suf
ficient number of courses on Econo
mics and Sociology so that they are
prepared to make an intelligent study
of the conditions. The students will be
expected to remain on the job until
August 22 and to attend all the semi
nar meetings.
The only expense for each student
will be the two dollars enrollment fee,
and whatever he receives in wages
will be his own. After he has been
accepted he will be directed how to
seek for his job. Students here at
Stanford who are interested in this
plan and wish to enroll apply to Ed
Vail at the Y. M. C. A. offices, or to
Sterling Beckwith, student chairman
of the local enrollment committee for
the group, at 250 Toyon.

In the last half dozen years, notably
at Portland, Denver, Wichita, Omaha,
and Worcester, groups of college stu
dents have worked under this indus
trial group plan, and marked success
and interest has been shown. The com
mittee at Los Angeles which has this
group in hand consists of 24 prominent
business men, professors, and Y. M.
C. A. secretaries of that vicinity. Watt
L. Moreland, president of the More
land Truck Co., is chairman of the
committee. Some of the men on the
committee are Arthur Bent, of Bent
Brothers, contractors; J. W. Buzzell,
president of the Central Labor Coun
cil; Capt. Charles T. Leeds, prominent
engineer; and R. W. Pridham, presi
dent of the Los Angeles Chamber of
Commerce.

An innovation in football coaching was
introduced at Princcton this year when
Fielding H. Yost', football mentor at the
University of Michigan, took complete
charge of spring practice at the New Jer
sey institution. Bill Roper, the regular
Princeton coach, acted as assistant to
Yost.
When the practice is completed at
Princeton, Yost and Roper will go to the
University of Michigan, where Roper
will be in cliarge with Yost as assistant.
It is thought that in this way an ex
change of eastern and western styles of
football will be beneficial to both teams.
A summer school on the American plan
will be conducted at Trinity College, Dub
lin, in 1926.
