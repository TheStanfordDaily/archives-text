MEN WHO HAVE KNOWN ME
There was Arthur —he was what you
might call extreme. He was cold most
of the time; only gat hot when I came
around —that's what he said. So we
called him Arthurmometer. But he got
broke.
Algie was a nice boy. Had sweet
curly hair, big quiquid eyes, and wore
the most delicate clothes. He was
really too nice—never got the least bit
rough, you know. So I dropped him.
He wasted away soon after.
The cave-man —that was Jim. Called
me his "woman" —rolled his own. He
did have a delicious masterfulness,
though. When he said, "Come on, kid,
cuddle down," it gave one a feeling of
being so well-protected. But he didn't
shave often enough, and nearly ruined
my complexion.
The man I have now is—well, just
perfect. I can't imagine anyone more
wonderful. Still, that's just what I
thought about all the others, so maybe
he'll start wearing white socks or
something. F. E. H.
