# CHOIR REGISTRATION FOR FALL QUARTER WILL BE WEDNESDAY
## 
### 
Reistration for choir for the autumn
quarter of next year will be in progress
during the coming week. On Wednes
day, Thursday, and Friday, Mr. Allen
will be in Room 84 from 8:30 a.m. until
noon, to try voices of those who wish
to sing in the choir and oratorio
classes next fall.
Among the works under considera
tion for oratorio study are Horatio
Parker's mystery play and cantata,
"The Dream of Mary," which was
given so successfully several years
ago, and Dvorak's "Stabiit Mater," one
of the greatest masterpieces of choral
literature.
A large number of sopranos and
altos will be necessary to fill the va
cancies made by graduation of many
now singing In the choir, and as the
policy is to have a larger chorus for
the Sunday morning services than
ever before, candidates will be wel
come.
Registration for the summer choir is
also in progress, and if a sufficient
number of capable singers present
themselves, one unit of University
credit will be allowed, as during the
year.
Those unable to come during office
hours should report at the rehearsal
in the Memorial Church, Thursday
evening at 7:30.
