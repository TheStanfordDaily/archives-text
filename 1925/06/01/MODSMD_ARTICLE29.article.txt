# NEW CHURCH ORGAN PLAYED IN SACRED CONCERT YESTERDAY
## 
### 
The first organ recital in several
months was given yesterday afternoon
when a sacred concert was presented
by Warren D. Allen at the new organ
console, assisted by Mrs. Violet Cow
ger, soprano, of San Jose, Mrs. Es
ther H. Allen, contralto, and the Uni
versity choir.
The organ has been thoroughly re
modeled and brought to date mechani
cally. An entirely new console, equip
ped to take care of all future addi
tions, is now in use, as well as a new
high-pressure rotary blower for feeding
air to the pipes. The organ chambers
were enlarged and are now big enough
to hold any sets of pipes which may
be installed as funds become available.
Yesterday's concert showed that the
tone of the instrument had been im
proved by the changes and renovation.
The objectionable squeak sometimes
caused by the old air compressor was
entirely absent due to the sound-proof
chamber in which the new one is
housed.
The program opened with "Festal
Commemoration" by Roland Diggle,
organist of St. John's Episcopal
Church of Los Angeles. This number
was selected as a suitable opener as
it was dedicated to Mr. Allen by its
composer. Selections from Handel's
famous oratorio, "The Messiah," were
next rendered by the chorus, assisted
and accompanied by the organ. FrescÂ®-
baldi's "Toccata per l'elevazione" fol
lowed. As a postlude "Carillon" by
Louis Vierne, one of the greatest of
contemporary French writers for the
organ, was played.
One of the largest audiences ever
assembled in the church for an organ
recital heard the program.
