"They say Stanford University typi
fies the American spirit, a statement
that is not hard to believe as one
looks into the friendly, understanding
eyes of its president, Dr. Ray Lyman
Wilbur," declared a Michigan news
paper in an interview story on the oc
casion of President Wilbur's recent
visit to Grand Rapids, where he par
ticipated in the dedication of the
500,000 Butterworth hospital.
The Grand Rapids Herald describes
President Wilbur as "a typical Ameri
can" and "a staunch advocate of the
American boy."
"Human life today is longer by twen
ty-five to thirty years than it was in
Washington's time, but it could be
lengthened still more if we took advan
tage of all the knowledge that medi
cine brings to us," said President Wil
bur in his address at the dedication.
Speaking of medical science and hos
pitals, President Wilbur is quoted in
the Grand Rapids Herald as saying,
"The hospital used to be a place to
die in; now it is a place of mercy and
refuge. We have got down to funda
mentals and can guide human beings
back to health. It is a place where
science and the heart are at their best.
When we combine science and good
sentiment, the brain and the heart, we
have something of which we can be
proud."
