# EL CAMPO NINE WINS BASEBALL TITLE 10-8
## El Tigre Leads Till Seventh When Winners Run Wild For Six Tallies 
### Aurelio Espinosa, Jr 
True to dope, and playing its usual
brand of erratic ball, the El Campo nine
won the University Intramural Baseball
Championship from El Tigre, 10 to 8 last
Friday.
Six runs in the seventh inning overcame
a four-run lead and sewed up the contest
for El Campo. Newton of El Tigre had
previously held El Campo to six hit's, but
he and his support cracked in the seventh,
in which he allowed four hits, and hit
one man, while two other El Campo bat-
I , . 1
ters got on base by errors.
Britton, El Campo pitcher, had the edge
over Newton, allowing seven hits, strik
ing out ten, and walking but one. His
support, however, was the worst seen this
season. Eight errors out of twenty-four
chances were chalked up against his team
mates.
El Tigre started like a winner and an
nexed four runs in the second inning,
while Newton was holding the El Campo
nine hitless. McKechnie doubled and
scored while Taylor was getting on base
on an error. Brown and Stockbridge
filled the bags with an error and a hit,
then Newton, El Tigre pitcher, cleared
the bases with a timely double.
Both nines scored in the third, El
Campo making two runs when Reem and
Britton were brought in by Smith's single.
McKechnie, getting on by an error, was
brought in by Taylor's double, for the El
Tigre score.

In the last of the fifth, El Tigre in
creased her lead to five runs, when a hit
by Stillman, and three consecutive errors
allowed two runners to cross the plate.
El Campo was ktfit scoreless during the
fourth and fifth^nings.

triple by Monroe scored two runs, but El
