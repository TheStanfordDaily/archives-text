# EAST LEADS IN TRACK HONORS COMPARED WITH WEST
## SHOWN BY P. C. C., I. C. 4A Pacific Coast Boasts of Most Stars; Easterners Have Second, Third Men 
### Douglas Meservey 
A comparison of the two foremost
i track meets in the country, both held
| last Saturday, shows a decided advan
l tage in favor of the East over tjie
| West in the matter of results of the
| two contests —irrespective of indivi
| dual winners. This is only to be ex
pected, however, since but nine entries
competed in the Pacific Coast—with
only one outstanding team—as against
sixty in the I. C. A. A. A. A. There is
also the fact that four firsts were
taken in the East by western athletes.
Greater Competition in East
Competition is always greater, how-
I ever, in the East and great credit is
| due U. S. C.for its victory over the
former. A few outstanding athletes in
| each event compose the bid of the
j West while over 200 schools in the
| Atlantic section produce many.
Of both meets, perhaps the most in
teresting result was the performance
of the Georgetown team of half-milers
—the Four Horsement of the track. A
month ago they set a new world's rec
ord in the two-mile relay, all four
qualified under 1:58 for the I. C. 4A
half-mile, and Marsters won in 1:53
5-10 with Holden close behind. Rich
ardson, in his present condition, would
have stood little chance in such com
pany.
Work, of Stanford, with his leap of
6 feet 5 7-20 inches, places himself as
among the best in the country and
possibly second. Ahead of him must
be put Poor of Kansas who cleared
C feet 5 7-8 at the Kansas relays and
who will probably meet Work at the
N. C. A. A.
Russell Best Sprinter
Sprinters, since Paddock, have been :
scarce on the Coast, and Sweet of
Montana seems the only one to com
pare with the galaxy of dash stars in
the East. Russell of Cornell seems to j
be the premier of the latter with his
time of 0:20 4-5, tying the world's
record, which he made three weeks
ago.
Hartranft and Houser will meet for:
the last time at the N. C. A. A. June!
13. The Card captain's stock as a com
petitive athlete wavers in value, but
at the present it is high above Hou
ser's —Hartranft having beaten both
of the latter's marks Saturday.
Tierny of Holy Cross stands as the
best 440 man in the country at pres
ent on a record basis He was far
ahead of the field at Philadelphia and
it is doubtful if even Miller df Stan
ford could have beaten him. The lat
ter will have it fairly easy at Chicago
since none of the Big Ten marks are
under :50.

also the fact that four firsts were
taken in the East by western athletes.
Greater Competition in East
Competition is always greater, how-
I ever, in the East and great credit is
| due U. S. C.for its victory over the
former. A few outstanding athletes in
| each event compose the bid of the
j West while over 200 schools in the
| Atlantic section produce many.
Of both meets, perhaps the most in
teresting result was the performance
of the Georgetown team of half-milers
—the Four Horsement of the track. A
month ago they set a new world's rec
ord in the two-mile relay, all four
qualified under 1:58 for the I. C. 4A
half-mile, and Marsters won in 1:53
5-10 with Holden close behind. Rich
ardson, in his present condition, would
have stood little chance in such com
pany.
Work, of Stanford, with his leap of
6 feet 5 7-20 inches, places himself as
among the best in the country and
possibly second. Ahead of him must
be put Poor of Kansas who cleared
C feet 5 7-8 at the Kansas relays and
who will probably meet Work at the
N. C. A. A.
Russell Best Sprinter
Sprinters, since Paddock, have been :
scarce on the Coast, and Sweet of
Montana seems the only one to com
pare with the galaxy of dash stars in
the East. Russell of Cornell seems to j
be the premier of the latter with his
time of 0:20 4-5, tying the world's
record, which he made three weeks
ago.
Hartranft and Houser will meet for:
the last time at the N. C. A. A. June!
13. The Card captain's stock as a com
petitive athlete wavers in value, but
at the present it is high above Hou
ser's —Hartranft having beaten both
of the latter's marks Saturday.
Tierny of Holy Cross stands as the
best 440 man in the country at pres
ent on a record basis He was far
ahead of the field at Philadelphia and
it is doubtful if even Miller df Stan
ford could have beaten him. The lat
ter will have it fairly easy at Chicago
since none of the Big Ten marks are
under :50.
A comparison of the two foremost
i track meets in the country, both held
| last Saturday, shows a decided advan
l tage in favor of the East over tjie
| West in the matter of results of the
| two contests —irrespective of indivi
| dual winners. This is only to be ex
pected, however, since but nine entries
competed in the Pacific Coast—with
only one outstanding team—as against
sixty in the I. C. A. A. A. A. There is
also the fact that four firsts were
taken in the East by western athletes.
