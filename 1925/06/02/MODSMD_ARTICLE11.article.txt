# AYDELOTTE MAY GO TO BOSTON BRAVES
## 
### 
If negotiations now in progress be
tween Jimmy Richardson of Spalding's
and the Boston Braves are completed,
James Aydelotte, former Stanford pitch
er, may leave next week to join the Bos-1
ton club.
Aydelotte's work on the Stanford team |
won him a trial with the San Francisco j
Seals this spring, but he was released a
short time ago. Since that time he has j
been playing with semi-pro teams and has
made a good record, scoring fifty-one j
i strikeouts in his last four games.
