# PROFESSOR FERRIS PLANS TRIP TO SOUTH AFRICA
## 
### 
Professor G. F. Ferris, of the Ento- j
mology department, plans to sail to
South America this summer in a 55-
foot auxiliary schooner. Accompanying
Ferris on the trip will be L. F. Finne
ran, *26, and W. G. Clark, '25, mem
bers of Theta Delta Chi; William Bur
nett, a former Stanford student, and
J. L. Langdon, graduate of the Uni
versity of Michigan and geologist.
In the Central and South American
countries which Ferris expects to visit
there has been no research made in
regard to certain small and obscure
scale insects. As this is a new field in
entymological study, he hopes to make
many important discoveries. Speci
mens collected by Ferris will be
brought back and deposited in the
biological museum at Stanford to be

used as a basis for future study.
To obtain material for short story
writing is Burnett's reason for going
on the trip. Clark intends studying
foreign conditions in order to give him
a background for consular work which
he will enter after leaving Stanford.
Finneran will assist Langdon in his
geological work.
The amateur sailors expect to leave
San Pedro on July 15, and sail down
the west, coast of Mexico. After leav
ing Mexico they will go through the
Panama Canal to Venezuela and
Columbia. Returning through the canal
they intend going to Chile and then
back to Mexico, where Professor Fer
ris will leave the party and spend
some time in Mexico City, returning
to Stanford in time to resume instruc
tion for summer quarter 1926.
