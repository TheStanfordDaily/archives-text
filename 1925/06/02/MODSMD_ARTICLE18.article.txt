# PRENTICE TALKS ON SUBJECT OF NYACK MOVEMENT TONIGHT
## PLAN IS CONSTRUCTIVE Morality Essential to Cement Modern Civilization Says Tuesday Lecturer 
### 
Dr. Sartell Prentice, lecturer for the
j Nyack movement, will speak this eve
ning on "The Economics of Morality"
in the Assembly hall at 7:30 o'clock.
Dr. Prentice will show that a sense
of moral responsibility is necessary in
j the civilization of the country. It is
the economic cement that holds every
j thing together.
"For the last hundred years, ever
j since the beginning of our nation, we
j have concentrated on the material side
| of civilization. Now we are waking up
to realize that this civilization is
dissolving. Something is lacking in
! our formula of prosperity and every
where business men are beginning to
realize this," says Prentice.
The Nyack movement is planned to
remedy the situation in America. A
group of men in Nyack, New York,
saw the need of moral and religious
feeling in their community and pro
posed the plan.
It is a significant thing that where,
ten years ago, a movement like this
one would have had no hearers, busi
ness men and women all over the coun
try are now willing and anxious to get
behind anything that holds the prom
ise of moral stability.
Dr. Prentice has lectured on the
Nyack movement and has organized
the plan in cities all over the United
States
