# The 						Masculin Monopoly on Genius
## 
### 
"A hen is no bird, a woman —no human," says a Russian proverb.
But if the Thorndyke intelligence tests have any significance whatever,
there is sufficient reason to believe that the Russians were a bit "off."
A comparison of the scores made by first year men and women who
entered Stanford last year shows the women to be "humaner" by 1.3 in
the I. Q. scores. The women's score was 79.8 and the men's was 78.5.
Do these figures dispute the so-called "law of the greater variability of
the male" which maintains that among 1000 men and 1000 women there
will be 10 male idiots for 3 female idiots, but also 10 male geniuses to no
female geniuses at all ? Hardly.
There is much mistaken opinion on intelligence tests. While they
cover a great field and are instrumental in discovering mental aptitude,
what possible light could they throw upon the artistic ability of an artist
such as Rachmaninoff, Heifetz, Elman, or Kreisler? None of these is
interested in plowshares, kitchen implements, the gregariousness of apes,
algebra, or the federal zoning system. Perhaps they have very high I. Q.'s,
but what's the difference if they have? Their general knowledge, or their
promptness in putting a small star in circle No. 4 certainly has very little
to do with the way they move their fingers.
In spite of all conflicting evidence, genius continues to appear, in the
creative fields at least, among men. The intelligence test is like any other
examination. It gives a hint of what is in the mind, but determines not at
all the ability of the individual to put his mental equipment into action.
Women consistently go from our colleges with higher honors than
their masculine classmates. What happens to them after they get out of
college? Here and there one is heard from, but the bulk of them get mar
ried, and that's the end of that. A few whose husbands die in office are
elected to fill their places, and oftdn make fairer records than their de
ceased partners, but what female kinswoman will fill the shoes of Anatole
France and Joseph Conrad ? What chance had Jane Welsh Carlyle in her
husband's boots? None at all, nor has hardly another woman so far as
the present field of female writers is concerned.
The secret of the whole matter is that women are occupied -frith much
higher ideals and much nobler conceptions than their genius-burdened
husbands, brothers, fathers and uncles. They are more important than
geniuses because they feed genius. —W. S.
