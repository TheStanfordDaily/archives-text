In the realm of business, when sgmeone makes a mistake in policy, or
the heads of an organization make a move which is soon seen to be im
practicable or impossible of effectual execution, a rescinding order is im
mediately issued. But the executives of the United States, when a trial of
some law has clearly proved its impracticability, are either sound asleep
or entirely negligent in the administration affairs, for they make no con
structive effort to either modify or repeal that law.
The Volstead Act, since its enactment in 1918, has proved itself to be
the most impossible and impractical law which has been passed fa the last
decade. When millions are being spent annually for enforcement, and
when statistics prove that drunkenness and disorderly conduct have in
creased materially in many sections of the country, to an unbiased mind it
would seem that the Volstead Act is anything but a success. In countless
ways the morale of the country has been undermined by bootleggers and
patrons from every walk of life, and yet nothing has been done by Con
gress except to urge observance of a generally disliked law, and to vote
millions for useless enforcement.
The Volstead law is, a detrimental influence to the morale of the United
States, and should be either repealed or modified at once. â€”C. C. S.
