# Union Cafeteria Reflects Campus Weather Conditions
## 
### 
The spring weather is affecting the
whole campus. Even the Union has
begun to be blue. This morning the
waitresses in the cafeteria appeared
with caps and aprons of the royal
color. According to Miss Handy, the
new garments were made by the
wearers, and if proven popular will
continue to be worn.

Two dormitory rooms at the University
of Columbia arc awarded annually to the
two juniors showing the best college
spirit. The men to occupy these rooms arc
chosen by vote of the junior class during
the spring quarter of each year. The two
rooms were presented to the school in
1917 by the class of 1892.
