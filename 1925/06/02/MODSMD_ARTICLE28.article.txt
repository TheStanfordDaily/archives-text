Ho! Bring me some fish
That "unpopular" dish,
Thick, juicy steaks find no favor.
Those pinkish editions
Just foster seditions;
Away with the red-blooded flavor!

From the Women's Edition: Stan
ford men are red-blooded meat eaters
â€”if statistics from the dining hall
management can be considered proof.
While a six-ounce steak is more than
sufficient for a Roble woman, men in
the halls are scarcely satisfied with
one.
