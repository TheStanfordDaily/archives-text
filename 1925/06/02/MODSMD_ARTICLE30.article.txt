The Editor, Sir:
We were pleasantly surprised to see
in Monday's D. P. A. an editorial in
forming us that the Interfraternity
Coiyicil was about to rush the eating
clubs, known familiarly as "local fra
ternities," to get them into their or
ganization. The editor seems to think
that the "local fraternities are anxious
to secure pledges and jealous of keep
ing them." We were formerly tinder
the impressions that fraternities also
pursued this policy, but evidently they
have been so far purified by the new
system that such things are totally
unthought of.
It is absolutely ridiculous to think
that the fraternities could be so fool
ish as to form an organization for ex
clusive purposes and then make a tre
mendous kick because it is not in
clusive. So far, however, the club and
hall men seem to be satisfied without
any self-imposed limitations. They are
pretty well fed, manage to keep up in
their scholarship, and get along pretty
well in athletics. Cheerio, fraternities,
how would you like to join the Inter-
Hall Association?
Personally, we think that the fresh
men are just as eager and gullible for
bright, at tractive jewelry in the spring
as in th(#fall, or even in the winter.
How about an open season on fresh
men, including summer quarter?
