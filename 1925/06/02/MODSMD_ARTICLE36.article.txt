"The Crowded Hour"—Varsity Theatre
Someone, somewhere, sometime —
but it's awfully vague somehow —men-
tioned that perhaps the war was over.
This was only a presumption (or per
haps it was a suggestion) but never
theless it was announced amid con
fetti and pre-prohibition stimulant that
the so-called "big show" was over,
ended, done, finis. Now, some seven
teen thousand years after comes this
picture — omigosh, won't somebody
please do humanity as a whole an
enormous favor and write to these
somewhat bemuddled and befuddled
producers to advise them of the afore
mentioned fact? Some fellow wasted
an awful lot of perfectly good virgin
film. —R. T.
