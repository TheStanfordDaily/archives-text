## Aged Base Stealers 
### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
If base stealing is a lost art because of the lively ball, it isn't because the
best base runners are getting any less livelier with age. Ty Cobb, who Is
going on 39 yars old, holds the major league record for the most stolen bases
with 843 to his credit. Ty stole 23 bases last year, more than he had pilfered
in any year since he was 31 years old:
In the older circuit, Max Carey, who is a youngster of 35 summers, has been
the leading base stealer for several years, and last season stole 49 sacks as
against 51 in the two seasons before.
And Carey and Cobb aren't the only Old Men who shake a mean leg on the
paths. Another veteran whose last name also begins with "C" seems to grow
younger and faster and more daring with added years. You've guesesd it â€”I
mean Eddie Collins.
Born in 1887, he stole 12 bases when he was 34 years old, the smallest
number he'd swiped in thirteen years. "Eddie's getting old and slow," the
when he was 35, and 49 when he was 36! Last year at the age of 37, he had
critics agreed. Then poor decrepit Mr. Collins proceeded to steal 20 bases
to be content with only 42, leading the American League by almost 20 bases.
Carey's best year was 1916, when he stole 63 bases. Max has averaged 45
bases a year for fourteen years, and is regarded as baseball's greatest base
stealer In 1922 he stole 51 bases out of 53 attempts! Ty Cobb holds the
American League record for most stolen bases in one Beason with 96, made
in 1915. He has averaged over 42 bases a year for twenty years!
Eddie Collins' best year was 1910, when he pilfered 81 sacks. The White
Sox manager has stolen 705 .bases in nineteen seasons, and holds 4he league
record for stealing six bases in one game. Eddie has stolen scond, third, and
home in succession, but Ty has done it on three successive pitches. '
