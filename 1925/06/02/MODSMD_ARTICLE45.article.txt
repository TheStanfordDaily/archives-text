# DESIGNS FOR 1926 QUAD DONE BY NOTED ARTISTS
## 
### 
The 1926 Quad, the distribution of
which begins next Monday, will be
the largest Stanford yearbook ever put
out. There are 404 pages in the volume
which is of the shape begun last year.
Three commercial artists of nation
wide reputation have contributed to
the art work and photography. W. R.
Rauschnabel of San Francisco has
done all. borders, color plates, intro
ductory pages, section closers, and end
sheets. His style is distinctive and is
resembled by that of no other artist.
His pen-and-ink drawings give the ef
fect of woodcuts. Rauschnabel has
done five oil paintings, illustrative of
the book's theme, â€¢which are repro
duced in full page size by the four
color process. The residence of each
living group has been illustrated, espe
cially for the Quad, in a'series of line
drawings by Cleveland McDonald, a
young artist, also of San Francisco.
These drawings are a special feature
of the fraternity section.
Besides the regular year section
with its illustrated calendar of annual
events there is a pictorial section of
art photographs of campus scenes done
in full page designs. Lagunita, the
Chappie office, Engineers Corner, and
the Law Steps have all been taken
in Moulin's characteristic style.
The page designs for the sections
devoted to living groups, classes, and
the senior class are entirely new and
have never appeared before in ftny
yearbook.
The art of the book has not been
kept to any limited style but has been
made as free and informal as con
sistent with a unified whole.
Other features deserve special men
tion. The athletic section has been ar
ranged in strictly chronological order
and has a large number of action
photos. A traditions section, for which
considerable research and preparation
was necessary, shows rare pictures of
the days when the University still was
young.
The Razz section, edited by A. Grove
Day, is the most extensive yet to ap
pear in a Quad. In addition to the
usual razzes on organizations there
will be a number on events and fea
tures of campus life. The advertising
section has the first group of colored
ads to appear in the Quad for many
years. They add much to the attrac
tiveness of this part of the book.
Last of all, although the first to at
tract attention is the cover, also the
work of Rauschnabel. It is an entirely
new departure in design as the deco
rations is not concentrated at one end
or in one corner of the front but
forms an integral part of the cover.
San Francisco ranks high among
cities in regard to typographical and
commercial art work, and several of
the leading authorities there have
aided and advised in the preparation J

of the Quad, notably John Henry Nash,
foremost among typographers, who
laid out two pages and gave invaluable
advice as to the typography in general.
The Quad now exchanges with prac
tically all of the best annuals of the
country and is constantly receiving
requests for further exchanges.
The annuals, numbering over 2,000,
were printed and bound at the Uni
versity Press.
