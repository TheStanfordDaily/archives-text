On the way to a |
bald-headed alumnus
You Stanford fellows have been talking about
falling hair and excessive dandruff. Perhaps
the hardness of the water is the cause.
We know that -washing the hair correctly and
applying a good tonic does stop dandruff and
falling hair.
By having your hair shampooed carefully and
treated with our tonic you can get these trou
bles out of your head. Try it out for a while.
See for yourself.
