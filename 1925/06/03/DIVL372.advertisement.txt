Ml ' Caius Julius Caesar has been dead 1,967 years, two months and
[§I , an d eighteen days. And yet, after all that time, Caesar is considered
ra • • a great military genius. We have his word for it that he was.

H ' • It is only by examining contemporary historians and then put
|Bj , ting two and two together that we are able to determine that as a
g] • military commander C. J. was considerable of a washout.
H [< For an example of his military prowess, when he attempted an
M . invasion of Britain, he anchored his fleet off the cliffs when a safe
HQ ' harbor was just around the corner, and after great-sacrifices finally
E ' succeeded in landing an army through the surf. But the storm came
ral » up and pounded his fleet to pieces and the invasion failed.

mr Never at any time did Caesar exercise more than a nominal
jSI|, authority over the Gauls. The minute his back was turned to make
h a triumphal return to Rome, the Gauls promptly forgot all about him. ,
Ikffl i
El 1° fact, the net result of his Gallic wars was only to irritate them
, to such an extent that they later swept down on Rome and made an
rg ' awful mess of things.
ft ! .
H | Yet, Caius Julius Caesar is still considered a great military
gc . ' genius, because all through his writings he stressed the fact that
m ' he wa such.
