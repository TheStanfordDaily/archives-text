# CARDINAL TRACKMEN ARRIVE IN CHICAGO FOR NATIONAL MEET
## Templeton to Watch Big Ten Conference Meet for Competition 
### Douglas Meservey 
Stanford's track t'cam arrived in Chi
cago yesterday as the Big Ten teams were
putting on the finishing touches of the
Conference meet tomorrow and Saturday.
Intermittent rains have spoiled the mid
western tracks for recent meets but it is
reported that Stagg Field oval is now in
good condition and the Card tracksters
are to train on it for the next two days.
It is possible that Coach R. L. Temple
ton and his six athletes will he permitted
to enter the Conference meet Saturday
unofficially but rules on this subject are
not available at the present time. If they
are permitted to do so, it will mean much
needed competition for the Stanford
trackstcrs and a first-hand view of their
chief opponents in the N. C. A. meet
June 12 and 13.
Big Ten Meet Watched
Results of the Big Ten meet will be
closely watched over the country and par
ticularly by the California and Stanford
teams. Most of the latter's competition
will come from members of the Big Ten
with a few individuals entered from the
Missouri Valley Conference.
Captain Hartranft and his teammate,
Hoffman, will have it all their own way
in the discus—both having thrown it over
148 feet. Sclnvarze, the 260-pound giant
from Wisconsin has set 146 feet 7J4
inches as his best mark this year but it
was at' the beginning of the Season and
his records in meets lately have averaged
around 140 feet.
Schwarze Stars in Shot
Schwarze has been picked by Middle
West experts as a 'new champion in the
shot put, however, and it is in that event
that he lias specialized of late. His best
mark was set in the Kansas Relays on
April 4 and was 49 feet 10% inches. Since
then he has put it out around 48 feet
twice and will give Hoffman, if not Hart
ranft, a close race for points.
McGinnis, the sophomore jumper from
j Wisconsin, and Russell of Chicago will
i provide strong competition for Work of
| Stanford. Although the latter has the
; better season's record—6 feet inches—
with McGinnis close behind with 6 feet 4
| inches, the Badger sophomore is the most
consistent. He has been steadily improv
ing and does around 6 feet 3 inches in
every meet. Work's best' mark is 6 feet
5 7-20 inches made in the Pacific Coast
Conference meet last Saturday.
Reinke Opposes Richardson
Poor of Kansas is undoubtedly the best
college jumper in the country and he may
be entered in the N. C. A. as one of the
Missouri Valley Conference representa
tives. He won the Kansas Relays high
jump with a leap of 6 feet' 5% and is a
consistent jumper at 6 feet 5 inches.
Richardson of Stanford has a capable
opponent in Reinke of Michigan, who will
run his last race in the N. C. A. meet.
I He has been consistently improving for
three years and has run 1:55 twice and
J 1:54 once this season as his best mark,
j Richardson is also capable of that time,
however, when in good condition and will
| give the Michigan runner a close fight.
I With the two will be Martin of North
[ western, a premier 440 and 880 man. His
time of :49 2-5 is the best in the confer
i ence this year and although running in a
sea of mud against Chicago, Wisconsin,
and Ohio State two weeks ago, he clipped
| off :50 1-5 for the quarter and was the
winner by five yards. Martin has also
; been clocked at 1:55 4-5, a second behind
I Reinke's record, in the 880.

mark was set in the Kansas Relays on
April 4 and was 49 feet 10% inches. Since
then he has put it out around 48 feet
twice and will give Hoffman, if not Hart
ranft, a close race for points.
McGinnis, the sophomore jumper from
j Wisconsin, and Russell of Chicago will
i provide strong competition for Work of
| Stanford. Although the latter has the
; better season's record—6 feet inches—
with McGinnis close behind with 6 feet 4
| inches, the Badger sophomore is the most
consistent. He has been steadily improv
ing and does around 6 feet 3 inches in
every meet. Work's best' mark is 6 feet
5 7-20 inches made in the Pacific Coast
Conference meet last Saturday.
Reinke Opposes Richardson
Poor of Kansas is undoubtedly the best
college jumper in the country and he may
be entered in the N. C. A. as one of the
Missouri Valley Conference representa
tives. He won the Kansas Relays high
jump with a leap of 6 feet' 5% and is a
consistent jumper at 6 feet 5 inches.
Richardson of Stanford has a capable
opponent in Reinke of Michigan, who will
run his last race in the N. C. A. meet.
I He has been consistently improving for
three years and has run 1:55 twice and
J 1:54 once this season as his best mark,
j Richardson is also capable of that time,
however, when in good condition and will
| give the Michigan runner a close fight.
I With the two will be Martin of North
[ western, a premier 440 and 880 man. His
time of :49 2-5 is the best in the confer
i ence this year and although running in a
sea of mud against Chicago, Wisconsin,
and Ohio State two weeks ago, he clipped
| off :50 1-5 for the quarter and was the
winner by five yards. Martin has also
; been clocked at 1:55 4-5, a second behind
I Reinke's record, in the 880.
Stanford's track t'cam arrived in Chi

putting on the finishing touches of the
Conference meet tomorrow and Saturday.
Intermittent rains have spoiled the mid
western tracks for recent meets but it is
reported that Stagg Field oval is now in
good condition and the Card tracksters
are to train on it for the next two days.
It is possible that Coach R. L. Temple
ton and his six athletes will he permitted
to enter the Conference meet Saturday
unofficially but rules on this subject are
not available at the present time. If they
are permitted to do so, it will mean much
needed competition for the Stanford
trackstcrs and a first-hand view of their
chief opponents in the N. C. A. meet
June 12 and 13.
Big Ten Meet Watched
Results of the Big Ten meet will be
closely watched over the country and par

will come from members of the Big Ten
with a few individuals entered from the
Missouri Valley Conference.
Captain Hartranft and his teammate,
Hoffman, will have it all their own way
in the discus—both having thrown it over

inches as his best mark this year but it
was at' the beginning of the Season and
his records in meets lately have averaged
around 140 feet.
