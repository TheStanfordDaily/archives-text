### Douglas Meservey 
Stanford's track t'cam arrived in Chi
cago yesterday as the Big Ten teams were
putting on the finishing touches of the
Conference meet tomorrow and Saturday.
Intermittent rains have spoiled the mid
western tracks for recent meets but it is
reported that Stagg Field oval is now in

are to train on it for the next two days.

his records in meets lately have averaged
around 140 feet.
Schwarze Stars in Shot
Schwarze has been picked by Middle
West experts as a 'new champion in the
shot put, however, and it is in that event
that he lias specialized of late. His best
mark was set in the Kansas Relays on
April 4 and was 49 feet 10% inches. Since
then he has put it out around 48 feet
twice and will give Hoffman, if not Hart
ranft, a close race for points.
