# Fire Chief Requests Campus Rubbish Clean-up
## 
### 
Fire Chief Dugan has asked that all
campus residents, especially fraterni
ty and sorority members, clean out
all rubbish in cellars, attics, and
closets, before the close of the spring
quarter. This should be done, he says,
to avoid large accumulations of waste
which are fire hazards on account of
the possibility of spontaneous combus
tion. An inspection will be made very
soon to see that this request has been
carried out.
