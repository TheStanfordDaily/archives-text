### 
"What is the place of the Y. M. C.
A. and Y. W. C. A. on the Stanford
campus" is the subject of the open
forum to be sponsored this evening by
the Euphronia Debating Society in the
lobby of the Old Union at 7:30.
Continuing their policy of holding
open forums on subjects of campus
interest, Euphronia has chosen this

As a basis for discussion, representa
tives of the two groups will speak on
the work as now carried on, and the
plans of the two the future. H. S.
Laughlin, Anna Fitzhugh, R. W. Tay
lor, and Esther Greenacre will give
five-minute talks in the order named.
Following the talks, the meeting will
be opened for discussion. Questions
from the floor are invited, and it is
hoped tjhat support and opposition to
wards the organizations will be
brought out in discussion.
This will be the last of the ten open
forums, sponsored by the Euphronia
Society during the past five months.
It will depend upon the next adminis
tration whether they will be con
tinued next year or not.
All students interested in the work
of the Y. M. and Y. W. C. A , and
all those who want to know what these
organizations are doing on the campus
are urged to take part in the discus
