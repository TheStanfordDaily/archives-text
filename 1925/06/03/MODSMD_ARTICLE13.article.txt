# M. E. DEPARTMENT RECEIVES RECORDS
## 
### 
The Department of Mechanical En
gineering has recently been presented
by Professor Emeritus W, F. Durand
with a complete set of the transactions
of the American Society of Mechanical
Engineers.
The volumes are of considerable
value to the department not only be
cause of their pecuniary worth,' but
because of their sentimental value,
stated Professor G. H. Marx, head of
the department.
The set consists of forty-five vol
umes, and includes records from 1880
to the present. Professor Durand, who
is now president of the A. S. M. E.,
became a member in 1883.
The transactions contain technical
papers submitted to the society, many
of which were written bj' Stanford pro
fessors or graduates. These records
form a valuable source of information
to serve as a basis of research.
