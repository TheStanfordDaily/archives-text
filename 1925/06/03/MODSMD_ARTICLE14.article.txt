# FARCE HAS UNUSUAL PLOT
## Small Town Girl Successfully Poses As Alluring Vampire In Love Mix-Up 
### Herbert Klein 
"Can a girl from a small town parson
age successfully masquerade as the most
dangerous and alluring siren of Europe?"
This is the problem around which the
story of "Polly With a Past," the 1925
Senior Farce now being rehearsed, hinges.
According to the plot of that very success
ful Broadway production, she can, and
docs it with results that are as surprising
as they arc amusing.
Aileenc Burk is cast in the role of
Polly Shannon who is later metamor
phosed into the fascinating vampire "with
a past," Paulctte Bady. Ailecne Burks
appeared in the sophomore play last year
and also in the junior opera as Cclestina.
She has had several months of study in
an off-campus dramatic school. This will
be her first appearance in a University
production since her return. The part
of Rex Van Zile, the male lead, is taken
by Leonard Schwartz, also well known in
campus dramatics.
Abie Stewart takes the role of Myrtle
Davis, whose desire to save or heljl any
body makes her lose Rex's affection to

the "woman with a past," who had as-1
sumed her role only in order to help bring i
about the marriage of Rex and Myrtle.
Pabst, Robertson Experienced
Alan Robertson and William Pabst
play the parts of Richardson and
Clay Collum respectively. Rex's bachelor
friends who, in an effort to help his love i
affair, give Polly her great chance to put
to good use her excellent French accent
and her ability to wear stunning clothes!
stunningly. .This is the last appearance!
of Alan Fobertson in a campus produc
tion. He has played many important roles j
during his stage career here, notably the
lead in "R. U. R." Pabst' is a first-year
man with experience in the Ram's Head
show and the Track Show.
D. A. Lamson and N. E. James arc j
also members of the cast.
Rehearsals Held Nightly
Nightly rehearsals arc being held in
the Assembly Hall under the direction of
Charles Parks who has been in charge
since selection of the cast. With the re
turn of Gordon Davis from his trip to
New York, which is expected Friday, it
is*probable that' Davis will take over the
supervision of the play and brfng it to
final completion.
One of the funniest of the many em
barrassing situations in the play occurs
when Petrowski, the noted pianist whom
the bachelors have been declaring to have
"killed himself as a result of coming
under Paulette Bady's influence" pops up
very much alive and decidedly irritated.
The play is the joint product of George
Middleton and Guy Bolton, the same two
dramatists who collaborated in writing
the comedy "Adam and Eva." The ini
tial production of "Polly With a Past"
was staged in New York by David Belasco
and opened September 6, 1917. It starred
Ina Claire in the role of Polly and en
joyed the remarkable run of 362 perform
ances. it was taken to England and pro
duced in London on March 2, 1921. Its
.success there was also remarkable.
