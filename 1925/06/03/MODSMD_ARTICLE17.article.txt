# UNIVERSITY ORGANIST GIVES RECITAL TOMORROW
## 
### 
An organ recital will be given in the
Memorial Church at 4 o'clock tomorrow
afternoon by Warren D. Allen, Univer
sity organist. Regular recitals are now
being held three times a week as was done
before the repairs and enlargement just
completed on the instrument were com
menced. The first recital was given yes
terday.
"Festal Commemoration," closing num
ber on tomorrow's program, composed by
the organist of St. John's Episcopal
Church of Los Angeles, Roland Diggle,
and dedicated to Mr. Allen, will be played.
"A Song of Gratitude" by Rosseter G.
Cole is a number expressive of exuber
ance and joy of life. "Pastorale," by
Ernest Douglas is a country idyll in the
style of the days of "shepherds and
maidens."
Pipes Being Installed
Sets of pipes are still being put in the
organ loft. The new console installed by
the Skinner Organ Company of San Fran
cisco is similar to the one made by them
for the Palace of the Legion of Honor
organ in Lincoln Park, San Francisco.
It cost $7000 and has many of the latest
features of design. Fifty-two sets of
pipes are now controlled from the console
and stops are provided to take care of
several more sets.
The repairs which have been made in
clude enlargement of the organ chambers,
installation of improved swell boxes,
which control the volume of sound, and
two large new sets of pipes, namely a
Trumpet and a Diapason on the great
organ. Air pressure is now supplied by
a newly installed rotary blower in a sound
proof chamber.
The complete program of future addi
tions has been mapped out and will be
fulfilled as fast as funds become avail
able. It is hoped to be able to enlarge
the Echo Organ to the proportions of a
two manual. When this is done the old
console may be used in an auxiliary role,
that of playing the Echo and Antiphonal
Organs. It may be placed in the chancel
where it can be played by a second or
ganist to obtain echo effects.
