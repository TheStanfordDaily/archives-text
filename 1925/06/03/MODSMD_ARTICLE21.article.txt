# NEXT QUAD WILL BE "BOOK THIRTY-THREE"
## 
### 
An interesting situation has devel
oped in regard to the naming of the
yearly Quads. In order to avoid having
two successive annuals known as "The
1927 Quad" the next year's issue will
be called simply as "Volume Thirty-
Three." The following year the num
ber system will again be resumed with
the 1927 Quad.
This shift is a result of the changing,
last year by student body vote, of the
Quad from a Junior Class to a student
body publication. The Quads will
henceforth be dated according to the
year of the graduating class and not
according to that of the Junior Class.
The title date will then correspond to
the year in which the book was pub
lished.
Another resulf of the change has
been to give the class of 1926 two
editors and two managers, Leon Brown
and Raymond Kay, editor and manager
respectively of the recently completed
1926 Quad, and Basil McGann and
Lowell Matthay, at the head of "Vol
ume Thirty-Three," all being in that
class. The new system provides for
tryouts during the sophomore year,
the entire junior year can be given
over to laying plans for the books and
the actual work comes during the
senior year. Allan Klauber and Robert
Paradise will be the editor and mana
ger of the 1927 Quad to be published
in that year.
