# Yes- and No

A bigger and better cinema palace will presently open in Palo Alto, to
the movie magnates' combined pride and mistrust. The owners are right
eously elated at the appearance of the new fireproof structure, for, in truth,
it is a honey. And on the other hand, the management is dubious about
the success of the venture if the hooters continue to yawp at the offerings.
Successive editors have turned their attention to this problem with the
idea of banishing an evil. However, it has been a light season for com
plimentary tickets this year, and if the proposed programs in the new
shi ftie coliseum depend to any extent on the gallery comments, there is no
reason to deny that perhaps the yellers serve a purpose.
With considerable pride, Palo Altans have assured us that in case
everything is quiet and we are good little boys and girls, there will be
vaudeville treats for us! And that's as far as that goes. Whether it will
be presented in the form of "amateur nights," from ham-and-egg profes
sionals or whether the Orpheum will be asked to co-operate, is not told.
Before guaranteeing anything on this hooting matter, the truth should be
known.
There is a limit to the capacity and profit of every show. Posters on
smaller buildings invite patrons to cheaper shows. The size of the new
place indicates that it can afford to show top-hole pictures. But if the
management starts vaudeville, it will probably not be very good vaudeville.
In that case it will probably get hooted.
