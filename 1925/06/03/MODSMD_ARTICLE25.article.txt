# Summer Quarter
## 
### 
Have you made your summer plans? If not, why not stay on the
Farm for another two months? It's the best quarter of the year in many
respects —and you have enough quiet to make up a deficient scholarship
record.
As for the matter of summer jobs, if there are no prospects at home,
Mrs. Snell can help. She has more part-time jobs reported to the Ap
pointment Office in the surfimer than she can fill.
Aside from the academic —think of swimming at Searsville and on the
campus, horsfe-backing, tennis, work-outs in the gymnasium. With no
forced diversions, only such as you voluntarily choose, the Summer Quar
ter is an ideal time for pleasant study.
IT REMAINS FOR somebody to prove that there are appreciable
differences between eating clubs and local fraternities as they are found
in other universities.
Men are rushed. Men are pledged. Men take an oath of fealty which
they are expected to live up to. National fraternities are petitioned to
consider clubs as new chapters.
It is contended that there is some exclusive privilege exercised in be
longing to the interfraternity council. This is a false notion. After the
eating clubs have belonged to that brilliant body for a while, they will
understand.
There would be a certain advantage to the University in establishing
this condition as a step toward a truer Democracy.
