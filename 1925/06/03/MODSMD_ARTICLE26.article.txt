# COURT PROSPECTS BRIGHT AS SPRING PRACTICE CLOSES
## 
### Wilbur Adams 
Prospects for a winning basketball
team next season looked bright yester- j
(lay afternoon when spring training
ended. For the last two weeks the
candidates have been practicing in the j
pavilion under the supervision of three i
basketball captainsâ€”Price, Oliva, and
McHose, and the results of the prac
tice are very encouraging.
This season's varsity was composed
mainly of sophomores, and with a year !
of experience behind them, they should !
show marked improvement over last
year's playing. The only man that will ;
be missing from the 1925 quintet will ;
be Captain Oliva at standing guard,
and to take his place is Newhouse
from the 1927 squad. Newhouse sub
stituted for the captain in many of j
this season's contests.
f Three Centers Available
When Steele was declared ineligible j
for this year's series, Stanford was
without a center, but Coach Andy
Kerr developed two centers of varsity
caliber. Anderson and Jayred alter

nated at the position during the whole
season. Next year will see Steele eli
gible again, and out fighting for his
old position. To add to these three
men, there are Dennis and King com
ing up from the freshman five, who
should make strong bids for places.
Nevers will be playing for the last
time next season, and after two years
at forward on the varsity he should
have a record year. Captain Price will
probably hold down the other forward
job .with the help of David from the
1927 quintet, and Vincenti and Crist
from the freshman team. Where Stan
ford has been weak in the past few
years is through the lack of substi
tutes, but next season Kerr will have
a number of good men out for every
position on the team.
Running Guard Popular Job
Running guard is one of the most
popular places on the floor. Shipkey
and Mitchell, varsity men, will fight
it out with Clark, Young, and Biaggini
from the 1928 team. Clark, especially,
should give the varsity men a struggle
for the position, for he was captain
of this year's freshmen and was the
outstanding star on the team. Clark
can play at center and forward as well
as at guard.
