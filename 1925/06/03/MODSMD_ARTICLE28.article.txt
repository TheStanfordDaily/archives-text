Here's fusel oil to Prudence Snough
The girl who never gets enough
Of Psych and Zoo and sundry bores
While other students smile in snores.
She wears her pencil down to naught
In taking notes with knowledge fraught
And so I rave on Prudence Snough
(I dated her—and got enough!!)

Yo-ho! For the boozer that drinks,
Oaring not how his pocketbook shrinks.
He's a tearing good fellow.
Come, now raise a bellow.
Yo-ho! For the boozer that drinks!

The Executive Committee was able
to carry on regular business last night
despite the absence of any Daily Palo
Alto reporters.
