"Confessions of a Queen" —Stanford.
We expected something far different
from this picture than what was actu
ally shown. Perhaps it was only dis
appointment, but the least we can say
is that it was hardly what can be
called exciting. We feel sure that Dau
det's story must have been murdered.
Incidentally, the idea of changing
the title of the book to something
which may possibly attract more peo
ple of a lurid trend of mind, is all wet.
In nine cases out of ten the heading
of the picture is misleading and goes
to show that movie-title writers have
yet to attain the excellence of the
best authors. And this time it was no
exception.
The redeeming phase of the whole
matter was the acting of Lewis Stone,
in particular, and Alice Terry in a
more general fashion. It would seem
that Stone improves more as time goes
on —which is unusual in the movies.
As the king who cared little about his
throne, his exhibition is as good as we
have seen in a long while; kings al
most seem attractive under such cir
cumstances.
The plot itself was nothing, rather
a drawback. A worldly-wise king mar
ries a beautiful queen; the queen is
cold, and the king goes back to the
wild tear; but all is made when
they go into exile. Alexei the virtuous
becomes ruler in his stead, and —well,
we wish no bad luck, but
—D. T. R.
