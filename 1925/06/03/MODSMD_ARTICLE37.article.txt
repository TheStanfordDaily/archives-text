# NEW THEATRE WILL HAVE ELABORATELY CONSTRUCTED ORGAN
## 
### 
Work is being rushed on the New
Stanford Theatre which will open on
June 9. The carpets will be laid down
and the furniture installed this week.
Music for the new playhouse will be
furnished by the $20,000 Leatherbury-
Smith orchestral organ which was in
stalled last week. All of the tonal
wealth of the modern symphony or
chestra is reproduced among the vari
ous stops which are similarly used,
namely first violins, 'cellos, basses,
trumpets, flutes, and clarinets.
In addition to these some weird and
beautiful stops of very unique char
acter are used. A clownish or bur
lesque tone is produced by the Kinura
stop which can imitate the braying of
a donkey, the quacking of a duck, and
the mewing of a cat. The saxophone
stop is one of the unusual appliances
which will be used.
Tibia Plena is a full rich flute stop
which is used often in combination
with the human voice stop. The per
cussion section of the organ embodies
all of the drums, tambourines, casti
nets, Chinese block, tympani, orches
tral bells, xylophone, cathedral chimes,
marimba, and harp. The pipes range
in size from that of the smallest which
is the size of a toothpick, to the larg
est, which is a 32-foot pipe and easily
big enough for a man to crawl into.
The theatre will accommodate 1500
people with four rows of loges on both
floors. Smoking will be permitted in
the balcony where 500 seats will be
available. Drinking fountains have
been installed in the foyer and on the
second floor of the building. A tele
phone for the use of patrons is located
on the first flT)or.
Hidden spotlights placed in various
parts of the building can be used for
specialtyftcts, and room for three ma
chines has been provided in the oper
ating room. All backstage technical
equipment will be run on the counter
weight system.
A. W. Gillis is to be the manager
of the New Stanford Theatre, succeed
ing R. E. Charles. Gillis is an experi
enced theatrical manager who comes
to the Palo Alto theatre from Madison,
Wisconsin, where he managed a play
house similar to the New Stanford. He
also was manager of the St. Louis
Junior Orpheum.
This new theatre will give the Ellis
J. Arkush Company five houses â€”Bur-
lingame, San Mateo, Redwood City,
and two in Palo Alto. Daily matinees
and evening performances will be held.
