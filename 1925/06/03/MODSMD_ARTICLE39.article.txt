# POSTOFFICE SENDS 4,000 LETTERS DAILY
## 
### 
An average of 4000 letters is sent
out from the University each day,
according to Mr. L. Wheeler, who has
charge of all outgoing mail. Twelve
and one-half per cent of this is local,
while the rest goes to distant points.
Ten unaddressed letters are mailed on
the campus every day and have to be
sent to the dead-letter office.
Since the new postage rate has been
in effect, the amount of second-class
mail insufficiently stamped has been
steadily increasing. An average of
twenty-five pieces must be held each
day for correction, according to Mr.
Wheeler. Five unstamped letters are
mailed by Stanford students every
day.
At the beginning of the quarter the
outgoing mail is nearly twice as heavy
as it is at the end of the quarter. The
highest point is reached a few days
after registration; then a gradual de
cline commences, and continues until
after finals.
The Saturday Evening Post is the
most popular weekly, fifty copies a
week being received through the mails.
The National Geographic is the most
widely read monthly on the campus, if
mail subscriptions indicate popularity,
as one hundred and fifty copies of it
go through the Stanford postoffice
each month.
