Due to the recent rains and the
present cool weather, Lagunita will
not be emptied until after Commence
ment, according to the foreman of
grounds.
Though this will bring joy to aquatic
queeners and campus swimmers, it is
sad news for those who have valuables
at the bottom of the lake. Summer
School student√ü will fall heir to all
articles "cast upon the waters" dur
ing the last year.
