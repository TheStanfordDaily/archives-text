## It Can Happen in Golf 
### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
There is 110 game in the world where so many tilings can happen as in golf.
And, strangely enough, many things that "can't possibly happen" do happen.
Take a shot that Oswald Kirkby made, for instance.
It was at the ninth hole at Siwanoy in the Victory Tournament several
years ago. Kirkby was in a deep trap, 150 yards from the green, with his
ball lying in a heel print. He lammed away at the pill with his trusty niblick,
hoping to get out of the trap.
He got out all right. The ball cleared the bunker like a shot, went whizzing
over the ninth green, and stopped 011 the upper veranda of the club house,
at last 170 yards from the heel print in the trap!
Chee D'Arey told this one while rowing me around in his glass bottomed
boat at Catalina Island. Chee is quite a golfer, second only in skill to his
famous brother "Squirrel" 011 the course made famous by the annual spring
visit of the Chicago Cubs.
It was at the ninth hole again—the same as Kirkby's—that "it happened."
Chee's drive was straight enough, but had too much steam. It would have
gone a mile beyond the green, but hit a horse that had wandered onto the
Hcene. The ball bounced back to within two feet of the cup, Chee getting a
birdie two, as well as a horse "So I credited the horse with an assist," said
Chee, who is also quite a ball player.
Dave Shade, most prominent contender for Mickey Walker's welterweight
crown, wrote me this, in answef to a question about his golf game. "I drove
a ball 175 yards. It hit a tree and bounced around, and when I came up I
found it in a spider's web six inches from the ground in the hollow trunk of
the tree."
Yea, verily—anything can happen in golf!
