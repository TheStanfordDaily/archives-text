"Americans have a peculiar reluc
tance to face facts," said Dr. Sartell
Prentice last night in his lecture on
"The Economics of Morality" in the
Assembly hall.
"The economic and moral side of
civilization canont he separated," con
tinued Prentice. "If conditions con
tinue as they are at present our coun
try faces a bleak future."
Dr. Prentice gave facts and figures
that cannot be ignored. Statistics for
1925 show that there has been a sixty
per cent increase in juvenile crime.
The people of the country are paying
in economic wealth for lack of moral
stability. Fourteen per cent of the an
nual income of the United States is
spent in paying for it.
Development of Science Traced
Prentice traced briefly the develop
ment of science and the industrial
revolution and showed how moral and
spiritual things had been forgotten for
material advantages of success.
"There is something lacking in our
civilization," said Prentice. "The peo
ple must develop a sense of moral re
sponsibility. There must be a more
universal religion or there will be a
more universal war.
Religious Teaching an Asset
"Any organization which teaches
morality and religion is a fundamental
economic asset. Recent research has
revealed that less than ten per cent
of the delinquent children have ever
had any religious training. Ninety per
cent have never had any religious in
struction at all.
"No civilization has ever survived
without a religious faith, and no civili
zation has completely died, although
with economic forces against it, that
has kept a religious faith."
Younger Generation Scored
"That the predominant feeling of
the youth of the country is that "every
thing is all right if you can get away
with it' and that 'it is getting caught
that is wrong!' has been proyed by
questionnaires given to students."
Prentice concluded his lecture by
pointing out that the state of the coun
try cannot be improved by passivity
and that action on the part of the
business men and the citizens of the
United States is needed to avert a
calamity in the near future.
