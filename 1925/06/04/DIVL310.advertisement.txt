Good accessories add greatly to your summer
footwear comfort —in many cases add longer
wear also.
It's well known that Properts Saddle Soap (60c)
softens and preserves good leather
—that Good Shoes hold their shape better if,
when not being worn, they are kept on properly
fitted shoe trees ($1.25 to $1.75)
—that Good Polish, the right kind for each
leather, will preserve the color and finish or
the leather—thereby prolonging the good ap
pearance of your shoes (Cinderella polishes 50c)
—that properly matched shoe laces add to the
appearances (silk 25c, mercerized 10c)
—and we suggest before your summer vacation
that you outfit yourself here—"Where Quality
Predominates."
