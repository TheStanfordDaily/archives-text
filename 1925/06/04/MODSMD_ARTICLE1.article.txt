# COAST REPRESENTED BY THREE TEAMS IN N. C. A. TRACK MEET
## University of Washington to Enter Four Men With Stanford, U. C. 
### Douglas Meservey 
Three Pacific Coast universities are
to be represented at the National Col
legiate Association track meet in Chi
cago, June 12 and 13.
Stanford, Washington, and Califor
nia will send squadsâ€”the latter com
peting in the N. C. A. contest after
its entry in the I. C. A. A. A. A. at
Philadelphia last Saturday.
The Washington team, consisting of
four men, will be Captain Egtvet in
tire shot, discus, broad-jump, and high
jump; Charteris in the S80; Wilde in
the mile; and McGinnis, two-miler.
With the exception of Egtvet, every
one of the Washington men took a
first in the Pacific Coast Conference
meet against strong competition.
Egtvet, however, was responsible for
five and one-half points by placing in
the four events he entered. His most
notable performance was a tie with
Muhs of Stanford for second place in
the high-jump at 6 feet 2 inches. He
had cleared 6 feet 3 inches previous
to the meet.
Charteris, the sophomore half-miler,
will make a strong bid against a large
field of Big Ten runners, Richardson
of Stanford, and Boyden of California.
His best mark before the conference
meet was 1:58 but, by catching the
Stanford runner napping on the home
stretch. Charteris beat him to the
tape by a few yards in 1:56 5-10.
Reinke of Michigan, Boyden of Cali
fornia, Richardson of Stanford, and
Martin of Northwestern have all done
1:55 or under and will give the north
ern runner a hard fight. The Big Ten
results at Columbus, Ohio, tomorrow
and Saturday will show exactly what
competition he will have.
Wilde of Washington is entered in
the mile run and should be the surest
point-winner that the northerners
have. He won his event in the P. C. C.
meet last Saturday in 4:24 5-10, which
eclipsed the I. C. A. A. A. A. time by
one and two-tenths seconds. His
strongest competition will come from
Arnold of Ohio State, Vallely of Wis
consin, and Makeever of Illinois, who
have all done 4:25 this season.
McGinnis of Washington broke the
coast two-mile record last Saturday
with his time of 9:37 5-10 ; This com
pares quite favorably with all of the
Big Ten and Missouri Valley distance
men with the exception of Phelps of
lowa State. The latter, with Hubbard
and Northrup of Michigan, was the
Middlewest's representative at the
Penn Relays last month and took first
in the two-mile with the fast time of
9:27. It is the best in the country this
year and if the lowan does near it
in the N. C. A. meet he should be an
easy winner.
