# WHITE TO HEAD RALLY COMMITTEE OF NEXT YEAR
## Nine Members Selected for 1925-26; Peter Gives Report of Work 
### 
J. R. White will head the Rally
Committee for next year as a result
of the Rally Committee elections held
yesterday at the Sigma Chi house.
Members of this year's committee also
selected nine members of the commit
tee who will continue to serve, form
ing the nucleus of. the new Rally Com
mittee next year. The remaining
eleven members will be chosen next
year. R. P. Myers, F. N. Tyroler, J. T.
DeFrees, E. L, Barnett, A. C. Sehoen,
G. C. Baker, C. H. Conron, and Mildred
Worswick were the others selected
to serve with White.
Leslie H. Peter, present chairman,
gave a report of the activities of the
committee. Although the Rally Com
mittee has been in existence but two
years, it has to its credit the conduct
ing of several rallies, dances, and
among its most noteworthy perform
ances, the bleacher stunts used during
the Big Game.
Part of the report is as follows:
"During the autumn quarter a strong
football squad offered most of the op
portunities for this body to function.
Members of the Rally Committee were
at every game in time to usher all
students to a definite rooting section.
Rallies were numerous, well attended,
and in general carried off with marked
precision. The speakers of the season
represented prominent alumni and in
terested faculty men. The Big Game
rally capped the climax with over four
thousand persons jammed within the
walls of the basketball pavilion. The
game at Berkeley saw the results of
the new system of plotting bleacher
stunts in advance on paper. Even those
loyal to the Blue and Gold were heard
to admit that no stunts, put on by
either institution, had ever equalled
those of this year."
The two hundred dollars which the
Rally Committee had voted to make
possible the presence of the Stanford
band at Los Angeles for the University
of Southern California game was
given to the band for new uniforms
when the game was cancelled. In spite
of this financial load, the committee
completed the year with only a small
deficit.
During the winter and spring quar
ters other rallies were held, notably
the Spring Sport Rally on the shore
of Lake Lagunita. For the first time
the Rally Committee instituted stunts
at the Big Meet. As a close to the
day's activities the members mater
ially assisted the alumni banquet.
The season was brought to a conclu
sion by the Masque Ball. The installa
tion of slides, swings, and other forms
of amusement aided in making this
dance a success.
