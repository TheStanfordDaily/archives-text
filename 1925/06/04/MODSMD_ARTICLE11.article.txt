# EDITOR DISCUSSES POLICIES OF TIMES
## 
### 
"The Policies of the Palo Alto
Times" was t{ie subject of a talk given
by D. E. Wood, editor of the Palo Alto
Times, at an open meeting of the
Stanford Journalists Club held last
night at the home of Professor E. W.
Smith.
"News is not played up in a sensa
tional way that creates neurotic stimu
lation," stated Wood. "Instead, infor
mal news is given more attention. To
respect individual privacy, the person
al element is left out of the articles
as much as possible. Juveniles are pro
tected from the stigma of unscrupu
lous publicity.
"The character of the town is re
flected through its newspaper. Palo
Alto is fundamentally an educational
center, so the Times devotes much of
its space to lectures, art reviews, and
educational gatherings.
"Associated Press news is stressed
because of the large number residing
in Palo Alto who have outside inter
ests. There is not a literary section in
the Times since only news that is com
prehendable to all is printed.
"To serve the public is the aim of
the Palo Alto Times. It is run as if
there was another newspaper in town
offering competition."
