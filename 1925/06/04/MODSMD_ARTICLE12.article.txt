# COLLEGE HEAD UPHOLDS WORTH OF HONOR SYSTEM
## 
### Fred Speers 
Vindication of and utmost faith in the |
efficacy of the honor system as it now
exists in American colleges and univer
sities was expressed recently in an ad
dress in the cast by Dr. Henry Louis
Smith, president of Washington and
Lee University, Lexington, Va.
He declares that the honor system to
him does not mean necessarily the re
moval of faculty supervision and the
"putting of every student on his own
honor whether he has any or not."
Dr. Smith points out that the system
is a â€¢ potent factor in the building of
character. He realizes the responsibili
ties entailed in the introduction of the
system. He defines its essentials as
follows:
"That the honor system may he a
working reality and not, as is often the
case, a mere pretense two things arc
essential: First that the whole student
body must be organized to enforce it,
and must accept willingly and courag
eously its heavy responsibilities. In
matters embraced by the accepted code
the faculty, while reserving its ultimate

control, relinquishes its disciplinary
function not to the individual student
but to an organized, sympathetic, and
willing student body.
"Secondly, campus favor must be
overwhelmingly in favor of a rigid and
impartial enforcement."
The honor system idea has been car
ried out as fully as possible at Wash
ington and Lee University. Not only
arc all notes, written papers, formal ex
aminations, and daily work done under
the honor system, which requires only
a signed statement on each paper by the
student that the work has been per
formed without any outside aid, but
"co-op" stores are used extensively
there.
Cases of the "selling without a sales
man" system were cited. At the an
nual football game with the University
of Virginia, celluloid lapel buttons
priced at 20 and 25 cents were placed in
an open box under a campus tree. Be
fore night the box was so overflowing
with bills that a passerby placed a
weight on them to keep the wind from
blowing them away. Over $125 was
in the open unguarded box at nightfall.
