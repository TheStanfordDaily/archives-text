# EUPHRONIA FORUM DISCUSSES WORK OF STANFORD Y. M. C. A.
## 
### 
"Resolved, That the Y. M. and Y. W.
C. A. have an important place on the
Stanford campus" was the concensus
of opinion at the open forum spon
sored yesterday by the Euphronia. de
bating society.
H. S. Laughlin, director of the
Freshman Cabinet of the Stanford as
sociation, and Anna Fitzhugh, last
year's president of the Y. W. C. A.,
spoke on the activities of the associa
tion.
Both pointed out that "students
themselves constitute the college Y.
M. C. A. with the avowed purpose of
leavening the campus with the highest
ideals, rendering service wherever
possible, and prompting specifically
Christian ideals."
Among their activities and services
to the community are: issuing of
freshman handbooks, sponsoring of
discussion groups, encouragement of
daily chapel and church attendance,
the bringing of men for addresses on
important topics, deputations to near
by schools, hospital visitation, Ameri
canization, missions, co-operation with
Palo Alto churches, collection of dis
carded clothes, and interviews with
students on personal problems.
R. W. Taylor and Esther Greenacre
spoke on the plans of the Y. M. C. A.
and Y. W. C. A. for the future. Rex
Bell, the state student secretary, will
be general secretary of the Y. M. C. A.
next year.
The most important plan for the
Y. M. C. A. for next year is the obtain
ing of greater campus support for
their services. When this is obtained,
improvements in the Y. M. C. A. build
ing will be undertaken. It was pointed
out that the success of the Y. W. C. A.
was largely due to the support of
sorority women.
This was the last of the open forums
sponsored by Euphronia during the
last five months. They were held
merely as an experiment by Euphronia,
and their continuance will depend
upon the next administration.
