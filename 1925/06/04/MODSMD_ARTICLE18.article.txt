# FINAL ENTRIES MADE IN TEN EVENTS FOR ANNUAL HORSE SHOW
## Sixth Tournament Schedule For Saturday Afternoon On Encina Field 
### 
Nine entries survived the final elimi
nations in the half-mile fiat race, while
final entries were made for the ten
events in the sixth annual Horse
Show and Tournament which will be
held at the Encina polo field at 1:30
o'clock Saturday. The horse show,
which is given yearly by the Stanford
R. O. T. C., sponsored by the local
chapter of Scabbard and Blade, nation
al military fraternity, will be the last
important event on the military calen
dar of the year.
Of the ten events scheduled for the
program Saturday, the greatest inter
est is being shown in the flat race.
The large list of entries made the run
ning of trial h<jats necessary, D. M.
Ersliam and T. B. Criley winning the
two heats. These two men are favored
for places in the finals of the event.,
due to.their win yesterday in the elimi
nations. Other surviving entries in the
flat race are: A. F. Scheidecker, C. O.
Thompson, K. G. Krohn, B. L. Davis,
J. Sherrard, B. L. Brockway, W. I.
Hollingsworth. This race depends
upon both the physical condition of
the mounts as well as the horseman
ship of the riders.
The first event on the program Sat
urday will be the Cossack race, in
which the stirrups of the mounts are
crossed so as to place the riders' feet
near the top of the saddle. Eight men
will participate in the finals of this
event.
Twelve men are entered in the
steeplechase, which will be over a
mile course with six jumps, the high
est to be three fet six inches. C. O.
Thompson, M. T. Johnson, and A. F.
Sheidecker are the three favorites.
R. W. Mossman, riding horses 23
and 66, has an edge over his competi
tors in the Roman Race, as his two
horses have won the event every year
that the tournament has been held.
His advantage will be somewhat di
minished by a ten-yard handicap. In
this race the two horses are held to
gether by a surcingle, while the rider
rides with one foot on each mount.
Nine members of the women's equi
tation class have entered in the Ladies
Musical Chair. In competing for this
event, the riders circle a ring of chairs,
at a given signal dismounting. As the
number of chairs is always one less
than the number of riders, one partici
pant is eliminated each time.
A number of horses are available for
more entries in the potato and spoon
race. Several members of the women's
equitation class have signified their
willingness to compete. Anyone inter
ested may enter by consulting with
the military authorities in charge of
the races. This race is probably the
most novel on the program. Couples,
each riding their own mounts, will
race for 200 yards, the lady carrying a
potato balanced in a spoon. Whenever
the potato falls, it is the duty of the
man to dismount and pick it up before
proceeding towards the finish.
Nine entries survived the final elimi

for places in the finals of the event.,
due to.their win yesterday in the elimi
nations. Other surviving entries in the
flat race are: A. F. Scheidecker, C. O.
Thompson, K. G. Krohn, B. L. Davis,
J. Sherrard, B. L. Brockway, W. I.
Hollingsworth. This race depends
upon both the physical condition of
the mounts as well as the horseman
ship of the riders.
The first event on the program Sat
urday will be the Cossack race, in
which the stirrups of the mounts are
crossed so as to place the riders' feet
near the top of the saddle. Eight men
will participate in the finals of this
event.
Twelve men are entered in the
steeplechase, which will be over a
mile course with six jumps, the high
est to be three fet six inches. C. O.
Thompson, M. T. Johnson, and A. F.
Sheidecker are the three favorites.
R. W. Mossman, riding horses 23
and 66, has an edge over his competi
tors in the Roman Race, as his two
horses have won the event every year
that the tournament has been held.
His advantage will be somewhat di
minished by a ten-yard handicap. In
this race the two horses are held to
gether by a surcingle, while the rider
rides with one foot on each mount.
Nine members of the women's equi
tation class have entered in the Ladies
Musical Chair. In competing for this
event, the riders circle a ring of chairs,
at a given signal dismounting. As the
number of chairs is always one less
than the number of riders, one partici
pant is eliminated each time.
A number of horses are available for
more entries in the potato and spoon
race. Several members of the women's
equitation class have signified their
willingness to compete. Anyone inter
ested may enter by consulting with
the military authorities in charge of
the races. This race is probably the
most novel on the program. Couples,
each riding their own mounts, will
race for 200 yards, the lady carrying a
potato balanced in a spoon. Whenever
the potato falls, it is the duty of the
man to dismount and pick it up before
proceeding towards the finish.
Nine entries survived the final elimi
nations in the half-mile fiat race, while
final entries were made for the ten
events in the sixth annual Horse
Show and Tournament which will be
held at the Encina polo field at 1:30
o'clock Saturday. The horse show,
which is given yearly by the Stanford
R. O. T. C., sponsored by the local
chapter of Scabbard and Blade, nation
al military fraternity, will be the last
important event on the military calen
dar of the year.
Of the ten events scheduled for the
program Saturday, the greatest inter
est is being shown in the flat race.
The large list of entries made the run
ning of trial h<jats necessary, D. M.
Ersliam and T. B. Criley winning the
two heats. These two men are favored
for places in the finals of the event.,
due to.their win yesterday in the elimi
nations. Other surviving entries in the
flat race are: A. F. Scheidecker, C. O.
