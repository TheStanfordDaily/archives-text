# DRAMATICS CLASS PRESENTS PROGRAM OF PLAYS TONIGHT
## 
### 
Two one-act plays will be presented
by Miss Elizabeth Buckingham's class
in dramatic interpretation in the Lit
tle Theatre at 8:15 tonight. "He Said
and She Said" and "The Flattering
Word" will be put on as acted, di
rected, and produced by the members
of the class.
By "The Flattering Word" is meant
the statement to anyone that he should
have been an actor. It is shown to be
a declaration irresistible in its effects.
All accept it as an indisputable fact,
and some humorous situations are
thereby created. The play was directed
by Lida Rittler. In the cast are Elea
nor Davidson, Baylor Brooks, Aileene
Burks, and Barbara Probasco. A vari
ety of types are represented by the
characters of the piece with an actor,
a minister and his wife, a typical wo
man of the "Main Street" type, and
her little daughter in pigtails.
"He Said and She Said," directed
by Aileene Burks, has a cast with
Marjorie Allen as the wife, Edmund
Spellacy as the husband, Grace Reade
as Mrs. Packard, and Lida Rittler as
the gossiping busybody. The plot
shows how an apparently innocent
story can be told and retold until it
bears no resemblance to its original
version and nearly succeeds in break
ing up a family.
This is the third group of plays to
me publicly presented by the class. So
j far "The Stone House," "Thursday
| Evening," "Mary's Wedding," and "The
| Eternal Girl" have been played. The
j public is cordially invited by the class
I to attend the presentation.
