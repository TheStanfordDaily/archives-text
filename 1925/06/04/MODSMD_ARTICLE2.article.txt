# ORDNANCE UNIT WILL INCREASE SCOPE OF MILITARY ACTIVITIES
## 
### 
An ordnance unit will be added to
the field artillery unit of the Depart- j
ment of Military Science and Tactics
next fall, according to an announce
ment made yesterday by Major Wil
liam D. Geary, head of the department.
The technical courses to be given
are not yet definitely decided, but will
be arranged this summer, when a tech
nical ordnance officer will be detailed
here. The ordnance department has to
do with the manufacture and supply
of guns and ammunition. Subjects in
connection with this will be taught in
lectures and practical courses.
For some time the War Department
has wished to establish an ordnance
department at Stanford because of the
excellent laboratory facilities and staff
of technical instructors here. Major
Geary believes the department will re
quire fully a year to become complete
ly established. Candidates for the ord
nance course are required to have had
two years of field artillery training or
its equivalent.
