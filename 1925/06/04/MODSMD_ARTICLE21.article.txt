The eating clubs object to being known as local fraternities and they
do not want to join any inter fraternity group. We must confess to having
foolishly scared up a hornet's nest of trivial objections. As a matter of
fact, it leaves us quite unperturbed whatever the clubs and the conference
are called. Call the clubs sewing-circles, if you will, and call the inter
fraternity conference the Society for the Uplift of Morals Among Fossil
Clams. Call them anything. But get them together.
It is important that club rushing and fraternity rushing, such as it is,
be on the same basis. It is only fair that there should be no regulation
without representation. Maybe the new members will solve the problem
of making a satisfactory rushing system. At any rate* they should have
the chance.
