# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT

### 
The Editor, Sir:
In yesterday's editorial regarding
eating clubs and fraternities you say
men in eating clubs are "pledged."
This is not true. When a man signi
fies his willingness to become a mem
ber, he is either rejected or voted in,
and if voted in becomes immediately a
member with the same rights as all
other members of the club. You say
that men take an oath of fealty which
they are expected to live up to. Certain
ly if a man took such an oath he
would be expected to live up to it;
for that reason we have no oath and
there again we differ, because we do
not seek to hold men in our club who
are dissatisfied and who do not enjoy
themselves in our company. We take
no oaths, sign no pledges, or bind our
selves with any bond except the bond
of friendship.
You say national fraternities are pe
titioned to consider clubs as new chap
ters. Strange if true. The only instance
of that kind on record was an instance
of a well-known national fraternity pe
titioning a local club to accept a char
ter; representatives of said fraternity
were repelled with a barrage of baked
potatoes. '
We wear no pins or insignia of our J
organization. We have no mystic grip
or handshake. We have no absurd initi-1
ations. We charge no initiation fee.
We live an independent life and are !
satisfied. We don't want to and will
not join the interfraternity conference.
We do not wish to disturb the fine
peace and tranquility that has always i
reigned in said conference. Let well
enough alone.
Respitefully,

The Editor, Sir:
Having of late read so many biased
nd uncalled-for articles in the edi
orial and news columns of your (our)
taper, and said articles having so
ankled the better nature of many who
lo not agree with you in policy, prac
.ice, or propaganda, and having been
particularly touched by your manifest
ignorance of the difference between
an eating club and a local fraternity,
I see that it does remain as you stated
in last night's editorial, "for somebody
to prove that there are appreciable dif
ferences between eating clubs and
local fraternities as they are found in
other universities."
In the first place you say that men
are "rushed." This is not true if you
mean it in the same sense as fraternity
"rushing." Men are invited to meals,
said meals being the same as those
served when freshmen are not present.
All bonaflde members are present and
meet the guests. We have no cellar j
or attic and no members are asked to
eat in the kitchen. Outside of the fact

I that the freshmen join us as guests
I and see us as we live every day no
> attempt at rushing is made.
We never take a man out and get
him drunk to secure his consent to
join us. We never take into the club a
man whom we have never met before
and keep him there for thirty-six
hours without a minute to himself,
while various members of the club
cross-question and brow-beat him into
membership. We never keep a man in
the club over night against rules we
have made ourselves or against Uni
versity regulations. We never hold off
campus entertainments for freshmen
—nor do the alumni of our organiza
! tions. We do not entertain or annoy
high school athletes. These things have
been done by local fraternities and
constitute the main differences in our
"rushing" systems.

The Editor, Sir:
"It remains for somebody to prove
that there are appreciable differences
between eating clubs and local fra
ternities as they are found in other
universities."
So starts an editorial in yesterday's
D. P. A. Well, why should anyone
prove it? When a person is brought
before a jury, he is presumed innocent
j until proven guilty. The eating clubs
, are assumed to be different from the
I fraternities until shown to be like
j them. Everything with two eyes and
! four legs isn't a cow. It is the similar
ity that must be proven, not the dif
ference.
However, demonstrable differences
! do exist between fraternities, local or
national, and eating clubs. In the first
place, eating clubs do not live to
gether. Men are rushed —yes. But they
are not slobbered over, and they are
not gotten drunk and then tagged with
a pledge pin. And incidentally, eating
clubs do not use pledge pins. Most of
them do not hold initiations. None of
them find necessity for mysterious
rites and secret ceremonies. There are
no "oaths of fealty." If a man is con
genial with the gang, he is invited to
join. If he decides to quit, he is free to.
And as for fraternities and Demo
cracy—ho hum.

satiated with debate on the prohibition
question (if not satiated with the fer

least say that the writer of the recent

most sweeping nature and a deplorable
blindness to fact. I must point out to

him that only recently has enforce
ment been undertaken seriously and
thoroughly; yet, in spite of sporadic
enforcement in the past, the results
are by no means as discouraging as he
would have us believe. The glitter and
glare of the bootlegging industry have
merely cast a shadow upon the bene
fits that have resulted; the impartial
investigator cannot fail to discover
those benefits. Enforcement is costly,
no doubt; but, with our huge national
treasury surplus, we can hardly be
said to be near the poverty line as a
result of our war against lawbreakers.

generally unpopular. Rut if the alleged
unpopularity is so obvious as to be

ties last fall, men whose business it is
to "know the public" and to put forth
bait to please the public's fancy.

The Editor, Sir:
In yesterday's editorial regarding
eating clubs and fraternities you say
men in eating clubs are "pledged."
This is not true. When a man signi
fies his willingness to become a mem
ber, he is either rejected or voted in,
and if voted in becomes immediately a
member with the same rights as all
other members of the club. You say
that men take an oath of fealty which
they are expected to live up to. Certain
ly if a man took such an oath he
would be expected to live up to it;
for that reason we have no oath and
there again we differ, because we do
not seek to hold men in our club who
are dissatisfied and who do not enjoy
themselves in our company. We take
no oaths, sign no pledges, or bind our
selves with any bond except the bond
of friendship.
You say national fraternities are pe
titioned to consider clubs as new chap
ters. Strange if true. The only instance
of that kind on record was an instance
of a well-known national fraternity pe
titioning a local club to accept a char
ter; representatives of said fraternity
were repelled with a barrage of baked
potatoes. '
We wear no pins or insignia of our J
organization. We have no mystic grip
or handshake. We have no absurd initi-1
ations. We charge no initiation fee.
We live an independent life and are !
satisfied. We don't want to and will
not join the interfraternity conference.
We do not wish to disturb the fine
peace and tranquility that has always i
reigned in said conference. Let well
enough alone.

.ice, or propaganda, and having been
particularly touched by your manifest
ignorance of the difference between
an eating club and a local fraternity,
I see that it does remain as you stated
in last night's editorial, "for somebody
to prove that there are appreciable dif
ferences between eating clubs and
local fraternities as they are found in
other universities."
In the first place you say that men
are "rushed." This is not true if you
mean it in the same sense as fraternity
"rushing." Men are invited to meals,
said meals being the same as those
served when freshmen are not present.
All bonaflde members are present and
meet the guests. We have no cellar j
or attic and no members are asked to
eat in the kitchen. Outside of the fact

I that the freshmen join us as guests
I and see us as we live every day no

We never take a man out and get
him drunk to secure his consent to
join us. We never take into the club a
man whom we have never met before
and keep him there for thirty-six
hours without a minute to himself,
while various members of the club
cross-question and brow-beat him into
membership. We never keep a man in
the club over night against rules we
have made ourselves or against Uni
versity regulations. We never hold off
campus entertainments for freshmen

high school athletes. These things have
been done by local fraternities and

The Editor, Sir:
In yesterday's editorial regarding
eating clubs and fraternities you say
men in eating clubs are "pledged."
This is not true. When a man signi
fies his willingness to become a mem
ber, he is either rejected or voted in,
and if voted in becomes immediately a
member with the same rights as all
other members of the club. You say
that men take an oath of fealty which
they are expected to live up to. Certain
ly if a man took such an oath he
would be expected to live up to it;
for that reason we have no oath and
there again we differ, because we do
not seek to hold men in our club who
are dissatisfied and who do not enjoy
themselves in our company. We take
no oaths, sign no pledges, or bind our
selves with any bond except the bond
of friendship.
You say national fraternities are pe
titioned to consider clubs as new chap
ters. Strange if true. The only instance
of that kind on record was an instance
of a well-known national fraternity pe
titioning a local club to accept a char
ter; representatives of said fraternity
were repelled with a barrage of baked
potatoes. '
We wear no pins or insignia of our J
organization. We have no mystic grip
or handshake. We have no absurd initi-1
ations. We charge no initiation fee.
We live an independent life and are !
satisfied. We don't want to and will
not join the interfraternity conference.
We do not wish to disturb the fine
peace and tranquility that has always i
reigned in said conference. Let well
enough alone.

Having of late read so many biased

orial and news columns of your (our)
taper, and said articles having so
ankled the better nature of many who
lo not agree with you in policy, prac
.ice, or propaganda, and having been
particularly touched by your manifest
ignorance of the difference between
an eating club and a local fraternity,
I see that it does remain as you stated
in last night's editorial, "for somebody
to prove that there are appreciable dif
ferences between eating clubs and
local fraternities as they are found in
other universities."
In the first place you say that men
are "rushed." This is not true if you
mean it in the same sense as fraternity
"rushing." Men are invited to meals,
said meals being the same as those
served when freshmen are not present.
All bonaflde members are present and
meet the guests. We have no cellar j
or attic and no members are asked to
eat in the kitchen. Outside of the fact

I that the freshmen join us as guests
I and see us as we live every day no
> attempt at rushing is made.
We never take a man out and get
him drunk to secure his consent to
join us. We never take into the club a
man whom we have never met before
and keep him there for thirty-six
hours without a minute to himself,
while various members of the club
cross-question and brow-beat him into
membership. We never keep a man in
the club over night against rules we
have made ourselves or against Uni
versity regulations. We never hold off
campus entertainments for freshmen
—nor do the alumni of our organiza
! tions. We do not entertain or annoy
high school athletes. These things have
been done by local fraternities and

! four legs isn't a cow. It is the similar
ity that must be proven, not the dif
ference.
However, demonstrable differences
! do exist between fraternities, local or
national, and eating clubs. In the first
place, eating clubs do not live to
gether. Men are rushed —yes. But they
are not slobbered over, and they are
not gotten drunk and then tagged with
a pledge pin. And incidentally, eating
clubs do not use pledge pins. Most of
them do not hold initiations. None of
them find necessity for mysterious
rites and secret ceremonies. There are
no "oaths of fealty." If a man is con
genial with the gang, he is invited to
join. If he decides to quit, he is free to.
And as for fraternities and Demo

The Editor, Sir:
I read in the editorial section of the
Daily Palo Alto that the Volstead Act
has proved itself to be the most im
has been passed in the last decade,
practical and impossible law which
Now, while I realize that we are rather
satiated with debate on the prohibition
question (if not satiated with the fer
mented beverage itself), I must at
least say that the writer of the recent
editorial has exhibited a marked ten
dency toward generalizations of the
most sweeping nature and a deplorable
blindness to fact. I must point out to

him that only recently has enforce
ment been undertaken seriously and
thoroughly; yet, in spite of sporadic
enforcement in the past, the results
are by no means as discouraging as he
would have us believe. The glitter and
glare of the bootlegging industry have
merely cast a shadow upon the bene
fits that have resulted; the impartial
investigator cannot fail to discover
those benefits. Enforcement is costly,
no doubt; but, with our huge national
treasury surplus, we can hardly be
said to be near the poverty line as a
result of our war against lawbreakers.
Then it is said the prohibition law is
generally unpopular. Rut if the alleged
unpopularity is so obvious as to be
perceived by the gentleman referred
to above, I am at a loss to explain
how it ever escaped the ken of the
astute leaders of three political par
ties last fall, men whose business it is
to "know the public" and to put forth
bait to please the public's fancy.
Sincerely—G. N. C.
