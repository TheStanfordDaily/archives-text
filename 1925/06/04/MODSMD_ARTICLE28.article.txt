"I won't do it, Buz. I tell you I
won't di' it. I'll be damned if I'll ever
play the fool again." Skipper Mowon
rose from the edge of the bed on which
he had been sitting and started toward
the door.
"No you don't!" said Buz Brockway
as he blocked the exit. An All-Ameri
can end and an All-American quarter
faced each other in silence for a brief
instant.
"The hell I don't," snarled Skipper,
grasping Buz's shoulder.
The smaller man made no move, but
cast a contemptuous glance at the
other's sign of aggression. Skipper's
hand dropped to his side, and Buz
seized upon the psychological moment.
"Listen, you poor fish, don't let this
Valentine Nierle business get you
down. All water is wet. Therefore, all
water quenches thirst. Wrong! One
co-ed lies to you—at least, you say
she did —therefore, all co-eds lie.
Wrong again!"
"I don't want to listen to it. I tell
you I'm through. T-h-r-x-q (Spelled).
Through."
"Well, don't admit it."
"It didn't happen to you."
"Yes, I know, but just because you
thought she was in love with you "
"I didn't," objected Skipper.
"Well, then, just because you acted
like you thought she was in love with
you, and you imagined that it was
going to hurt her when you gave her
the gate "
"I never did, you're crazy. She was
engaged to some other bird all the
time and didn't tell me about it."
"Well, weren't you in the same
boat?"
"Yes, but I Well, I never pro
posed to her."
"No, but you might just as well
have done it."
"Why?"
"Why, because your own cleverness
got the best of you and you know it.
Every time you started to desert her
you began it like a proposal. Serious
stuff, and all that! She just took the
bull by the horns and beat you to it.
Admit it now, you egg! Wasn't it
your own fault?"
"Buz, we hashed this all over before.
What's the use. If I stay around here
I'll be sure to make a fool of myself."
"That's too darn bad. Well, you're
a fool for sure if you beat it now,
though. A guy with your reputation
running away from a woman!"
"I'm not running away. I'm just
going."
"Bunk! Pure and unadulterated
bunk! Here we've had one wonderful
time these last three days on the stag
party. Mack treats us like nobility.
Then he decides to enlarge the party,
call in some more men and get girls
for everybody. You ask him not to get
one for you. He O. K.'s your idea with
out question. Then Herb Herblin "
"Don't tell me the rest," objected
Skipper. "Don't bother! I've heard the
damn thing fifty times. He telegraphs
that he can't come. The girl is on her
way. Presto bunko! I become a goat.
Not unless my I. Q.'s 101, or less!"
"But she's a snappy blonde and
as "
"Just the kind I don't want."
"Well, suppose then, you change
with Joe. Alfreda Amelia Clinton is a
nice girl. Nice! Very nice! Such a
sweet face!"
"Nothing doing!"
"There you are! You'd have a won
derful time with this Mitzi Mayerle,
and you'd be as safe as a bootlegger
in Chicago. Don't worry, these en
gaged women "

"Engaged!"
"Yes, didn't you know she was en
gaged to Herb?"
"No! Damn peculiar the rest of the
crowd never said anything about it."
"Well, you see Mitzi has per
haps . She's been . Perhaps you
thought she wouldn't like it."
"Like it! What could be better? This
is just . Aw, the devil. I don't think
I'd better."
"Well, I'm not gonna start this all
over again. Oughta be a wow of a
party. You don't want to be out of it,
Skipper."
"I know it but . Well, I'll be
watching little me. I may have been
green once, but no woman can make
a fool out of me now."
"Atta boy! I'll say they can't. Not
even a knock-out like Mitzi."
*»* • •
"And so after all, Mitzi," Skipper
said as the two viewed the picturesque
Bubble Beach from a high and isolated
cliff, "we have something in common.
You're engaged, and so am I."
"Oh that really isn'tall we have in
common, Skipper. I like real big men
like you. Just look at the way you
won that foursome this morning. So
easily."
"Now, Mitzi, you know that my part
ner had a lot to do with that. You did
some wonderful playing. You know,
I really wish Caroline could play golf.
I'll have to teach her."
"Does she smoke?"
"No, she never does any of those
things. Just a sweet, pretty girl, and
very good to me."
"She's mighty lucky."
"Now I'll tell one."
"You don't believe me, Skipper."
"I didn't say that, but "
"It's too hot here in the sun," Mitzi
interrupted. "Let's go over there in
the shade of that cypress tree and sit
on the nice flat rock?"
"I think we'd better go back with
the rest of the bunch."
"Not yet, I'm too tired."
"But Mitzi . Oh, well, I suppose
it's all right."
"Now," she began emphatically,
when they had made themselves com
fortable, "tell me some more about
your very interesting self. Tell me all
about football."
"I'd rather not."
"Aw, come on, please? I know the
brave are modest, but you can do it
just for me, can't you, Skipper?"
"But I couldn't tell you anything you
haven't seen in the papers."
"Perhaps you couldn't, but I'd just
love to hear it all over again from
you, personally. Just from you."
"No, I've had enough of that stuff.
Every time I talk about athletics, it
gets into print. Why, even that golf
game this morning might be in the
paper tomorrow."
"Wouldn't that be wonderful? Do
you suppose they took a picture of
us?"
"I saw a man with a camera."
"You did? Oh, I hope he got one of
you fixing a tee for me. I wish I'd
worn my pink hat."
"Can't we talk about something
else?"
"Why should we? I think this is
wonderful!"
"I don't! I don't like it. Perhaps you
won't like it so much tomorrow, your
self."
"Why?"
"I think your back was turned when
he took the picture."
"Rats! Gee, that's the bunk. I'm
awfully sorry."
"Yes, of course."
"But it'll be an honor even to have
my name at the bottom of the picture
with —y-o-u-."
"Yes . Mitzi, please stop this
nonsense."
"All right, Skipper, but don't forget
I'll always, always, always, ALWAYS
—think you're wonderful —just won
derful."

"I won't do it, Buz. I tell you I
won't di' it. I'll be damned if I'll ever
play the fool again." Skipper Mowon
rose from the edge of the bed on which
he had been sitting and started toward
the door.
"No you don't!" said Buz Brockway
as he blocked the exit. An All-Ameri
can end and an All-American quarter
faced each other in silence for a brief
instant.
"The hell I don't," snarled Skipper,
grasping Buz's shoulder.
The smaller man made no move, but
cast a contemptuous glance at the
other's sign of aggression. Skipper's
hand dropped to his side, and Buz
seized upon the psychological moment.
"Listen, you poor fish, don't let this
Valentine Nierle business get you
down. All water is wet. Therefore, all
water quenches thirst. Wrong! One
co-ed lies to you—at least, you say
she did —therefore, all co-eds lie.
Wrong again!"
"I don't want to listen to it. I tell
you I'm through. T-h-r-x-q (Spelled).
Through."
"Well, don't admit it."
"It didn't happen to you."
"Yes, I know, but just because you
thought she was in love with you "
"I didn't," objected Skipper.
"Well, then, just because you acted
like you thought she was in love with
you, and you imagined that it was
going to hurt her when you gave her
the gate "
"I never did, you're crazy. She was
engaged to some other bird all the
time and didn't tell me about it."
"Well, weren't you in the same
boat?"
"Yes, but I Well, I never pro
posed to her."
"No, but you might just as well
have done it."
"Why?"
"Why, because your own cleverness
got the best of you and you know it.
Every time you started to desert her
you began it like a proposal. Serious
stuff, and all that! She just took the
bull by the horns and beat you to it.
Admit it now, you egg! Wasn't it
your own fault?"
"Buz, we hashed this all over before.
What's the use. If I stay around here
I'll be sure to make a fool of myself."
"That's too darn bad. Well, you're
a fool for sure if you beat it now,
though. A guy with your reputation
running away from a woman!"
"I'm not running away. I'm just
going."
"Bunk! Pure and unadulterated
bunk! Here we've had one wonderful
time these last three days on the stag
party. Mack treats us like nobility.
Then he decides to enlarge the party,
call in some more men and get girls
for everybody. You ask him not to get
one for you. He O. K.'s your idea with
out question. Then Herb Herblin "
"Don't tell me the rest," objected
Skipper. "Don't bother! I've heard the
damn thing fifty times. He telegraphs
that he can't come. The girl is on her
way. Presto bunko! I become a goat.
Not unless my I. Q.'s 101, or less!"
"But she's a snappy blonde and
as "
"Just the kind I don't want."
"Well, suppose then, you change
with Joe. Alfreda Amelia Clinton is a
nice girl. Nice! Very nice! Such a
sweet face!"
"Nothing doing!"
"There you are! You'd have a won
derful time with this Mitzi Mayerle,
and you'd be as safe as a bootlegger
in Chicago. Don't worry, these en
gaged women "

"Engaged!"
"Yes, didn't you know she was en
gaged to Herb?"
"No! Damn peculiar the rest of the
crowd never said anything about it."
"Well, you see Mitzi has per
haps . She's been . Perhaps you
thought she wouldn't like it."
"Like it! What could be better? This
is just . Aw, the devil. I don't think
I'd better."
"Well, I'm not gonna start this all
over again. Oughta be a wow of a
party. You don't want to be out of it,
Skipper."
"I know it but . Well, I'll be
watching little me. I may have been
green once, but no woman can make
a fool out of me now."
"Atta boy! I'll say they can't. Not
even a knock-out like Mitzi."
*»* • •
"And so after all, Mitzi," Skipper
said as the two viewed the picturesque
Bubble Beach from a high and isolated
cliff, "we have something in common.
You're engaged, and so am I."
"Oh that really isn'tall we have in
common, Skipper. I like real big men
like you. Just look at the way you
won that foursome this morning. So
easily."
"Now, Mitzi, you know that my part
ner had a lot to do with that. You did
some wonderful playing. You know,
I really wish Caroline could play golf.
I'll have to teach her."
"Does she smoke?"
"No, she never does any of those
things. Just a sweet, pretty girl, and
very good to me."
"She's mighty lucky."
"Now I'll tell one."
"You don't believe me, Skipper."
"I didn't say that, but "
"It's too hot here in the sun," Mitzi
interrupted. "Let's go over there in
the shade of that cypress tree and sit
on the nice flat rock?"
"I think we'd better go back with
the rest of the bunch."
"Not yet, I'm too tired."
"But Mitzi . Oh, well, I suppose
it's all right."
"Now," she began emphatically,
when they had made themselves com
fortable, "tell me some more about
your very interesting self. Tell me all
about football."
"I'd rather not."
"Aw, come on, please? I know the
brave are modest, but you can do it
just for me, can't you, Skipper?"
"But I couldn't tell you anything you
haven't seen in the papers."
"Perhaps you couldn't, but I'd just
love to hear it all over again from
you, personally. Just from you."
"No, I've had enough of that stuff.
Every time I talk about athletics, it
gets into print. Why, even that golf
game this morning might be in the
paper tomorrow."
"Wouldn't that be wonderful? Do
you suppose they took a picture of
us?"
"I saw a man with a camera."
"You did? Oh, I hope he got one of
you fixing a tee for me. I wish I'd
worn my pink hat."
"Can't we talk about something
else?"
"Why should we? I think this is
wonderful!"
"I don't! I don't like it. Perhaps you
won't like it so much tomorrow, your
self."
"Why?"
"I think your back was turned when
he took the picture."
"Rats! Gee, that's the bunk. I'm
awfully sorry."
"Yes, of course."
"But it'll be an honor even to have
my name at the bottom of the picture
with —y-o-u-."
"Yes . Mitzi, please stop this

"I won't do it, Buz. I tell you I
won't di' it. I'll be damned if I'll ever
play the fool again." Skipper Mowon
rose from the edge of the bed on which
he had been sitting and started toward
the door.
"No you don't!" said Buz Brockway
as he blocked the exit. An All-Ameri
can end and an All-American quarter
faced each other in silence for a brief
instant.
"The hell I don't," snarled Skipper,
grasping Buz's shoulder.
The smaller man made no move, but
cast a contemptuous glance at the
other's sign of aggression. Skipper's
hand dropped to his side, and Buz
seized upon the psychological moment.
"Listen, you poor fish, don't let this
Valentine Nierle business get you
down. All water is wet. Therefore, all
water quenches thirst. Wrong! One
co-ed lies to you—at least, you say
she did —therefore, all co-eds lie.
Wrong again!"
"I don't want to listen to it. I tell
you I'm through. T-h-r-x-q (Spelled).
Through."
"Well, don't admit it."
"It didn't happen to you."
"Yes, I know, but just because you
thought she was in love with you "
"I didn't," objected Skipper.
"Well, then, just because you acted
like you thought she was in love with
you, and you imagined that it was
going to hurt her when you gave her
the gate "
"I never did, you're crazy. She was
engaged to some other bird all the
time and didn't tell me about it."
"Well, weren't you in the same
boat?"
"Yes, but I Well, I never pro
posed to her."
"No, but you might just as well
have done it."
"Why?"
"Why, because your own cleverness
got the best of you and you know it.
Every time you started to desert her
you began it like a proposal. Serious
stuff, and all that! She just took the
bull by the horns and beat you to it.
Admit it now, you egg! Wasn't it
your own fault?"
"Buz, we hashed this all over before.
What's the use. If I stay around here
I'll be sure to make a fool of myself."
"That's too darn bad. Well, you're
a fool for sure if you beat it now,
though. A guy with your reputation
running away from a woman!"
"I'm not running away. I'm just
going."
"Bunk! Pure and unadulterated
bunk! Here we've had one wonderful
time these last three days on the stag
party. Mack treats us like nobility.
Then he decides to enlarge the party,
call in some more men and get girls
for everybody. You ask him not to get
one for you. He O. K.'s your idea with
out question. Then Herb Herblin "
"Don't tell me the rest," objected
Skipper. "Don't bother! I've heard the
damn thing fifty times. He telegraphs
that he can't come. The girl is on her
way. Presto bunko! I become a goat.
Not unless my I. Q.'s 101, or less!"
"But she's a snappy blonde and
as "
"Just the kind I don't want."
"Well, suppose then, you change
with Joe. Alfreda Amelia Clinton is a
nice girl. Nice! Very nice! Such a
sweet face!"
"Nothing doing!"
"There you are! You'd have a won
derful time with this Mitzi Mayerle,
and you'd be as safe as a bootlegger
in Chicago. Don't worry, these en
gaged women "

"Engaged!"
"Yes, didn't you know she was en
gaged to Herb?"
"No! Damn peculiar the rest of the
crowd never said anything about it."
"Well, you see Mitzi has per
haps . She's been . Perhaps you
thought she wouldn't like it."
"Like it! What could be better? This
is just . Aw, the devil. I don't think
I'd better."
"Well, I'm not gonna start this all
over again. Oughta be a wow of a
party. You don't want to be out of it,
Skipper."
"I know it but . Well, I'll be
watching little me. I may have been
green once, but no woman can make
a fool out of me now."
"Atta boy! I'll say they can't. Not
even a knock-out like Mitzi."
*»* • •
"And so after all, Mitzi," Skipper
said as the two viewed the picturesque
Bubble Beach from a high and isolated
cliff, "we have something in common.
You're engaged, and so am I."
"Oh that really isn'tall we have in
common, Skipper. I like real big men
like you. Just look at the way you
won that foursome this morning. So
easily."
"Now, Mitzi, you know that my part
ner had a lot to do with that. You did
some wonderful playing. You know,
I really wish Caroline could play golf.
I'll have to teach her."
"Does she smoke?"
"No, she never does any of those
things. Just a sweet, pretty girl, and
very good to me."
"She's mighty lucky."
"Now I'll tell one."
"You don't believe me, Skipper."
"I didn't say that, but "
"It's too hot here in the sun," Mitzi
interrupted. "Let's go over there in
the shade of that cypress tree and sit
on the nice flat rock?"
"I think we'd better go back with
the rest of the bunch."
"Not yet, I'm too tired."
"But Mitzi . Oh, well, I suppose
it's all right."
"Now," she began emphatically,
when they had made themselves com
fortable, "tell me some more about
your very interesting self. Tell me all
about football."
"I'd rather not."
"Aw, come on, please? I know the
brave are modest, but you can do it
just for me, can't you, Skipper?"
"But I couldn't tell you anything you
haven't seen in the papers."
"Perhaps you couldn't, but I'd just
love to hear it all over again from
you, personally. Just from you."
"No, I've had enough of that stuff.
Every time I talk about athletics, it
gets into print. Why, even that golf
game this morning might be in the
paper tomorrow."
"Wouldn't that be wonderful? Do
you suppose they took a picture of
us?"
"I saw a man with a camera."
"You did? Oh, I hope he got one of
you fixing a tee for me. I wish I'd
worn my pink hat."
"Can't we talk about something
else?"
"Why should we? I think this is
wonderful!"
"I don't! I don't like it. Perhaps you
won't like it so much tomorrow, your
self."
"Why?"
"I think your back was turned when
he took the picture."
"Rats! Gee, that's the bunk. I'm
awfully sorry."
"Yes, of course."
"But it'll be an honor even to have
my name at the bottom of the picture

"I think your back was turned when
he took the picture."
"Rats! Gee, that's the bunk. I'm
awfully sorry."
"Yes, of course."
"But it'll be an honor even to have
my name at the bottom of the picture
with —y-o-u-."
"Yes . Mitzi, please stop this
nonsense."
"All right, Skipper, but don't forget

"I won't do it, Buz. I tell you I
won't di' it. I'll be damned if I'll ever
play the fool again." Skipper Mowon
rose from the edge of the bed on which
he had been sitting and started toward
the door.
"No you don't!" said Buz Brockway
as he blocked the exit. An All-Ameri
can end and an All-American quarter
faced each other in silence for a brief
instant.
"The hell I don't," snarled Skipper,
grasping Buz's shoulder.
The smaller man made no move, but
cast a contemptuous glance at the
other's sign of aggression. Skipper's
hand dropped to his side, and Buz
seized upon the psychological moment.
"Listen, you poor fish, don't let this
Valentine Nierle business get you
down. All water is wet. Therefore, all
water quenches thirst. Wrong! One
co-ed lies to you—at least, you say
she did —therefore, all co-eds lie.
Wrong again!"
"I don't want to listen to it. I tell
you I'm through. T-h-r-x-q (Spelled).
Through."
"Well, don't admit it."
"It didn't happen to you."
"Yes, I know, but just because you
thought she was in love with you "
"I didn't," objected Skipper.
"Well, then, just because you acted
like you thought she was in love with
you, and you imagined that it was
going to hurt her when you gave her
the gate "
"I never did, you're crazy. She was
engaged to some other bird all the
time and didn't tell me about it."
"Well, weren't you in the same
boat?"
"Yes, but I Well, I never pro
posed to her."
"No, but you might just as well
have done it."
"Why?"
"Why, because your own cleverness
got the best of you and you know it.
Every time you started to desert her
you began it like a proposal. Serious
stuff, and all that! She just took the
bull by the horns and beat you to it.
Admit it now, you egg! Wasn't it
your own fault?"
"Buz, we hashed this all over before.
What's the use. If I stay around here
I'll be sure to make a fool of myself."
"That's too darn bad. Well, you're
a fool for sure if you beat it now,
though. A guy with your reputation
running away from a woman!"
"I'm not running away. I'm just
going."
"Bunk! Pure and unadulterated
bunk! Here we've had one wonderful
time these last three days on the stag
party. Mack treats us like nobility.
Then he decides to enlarge the party,
call in some more men and get girls
for everybody. You ask him not to get
one for you. He O. K.'s your idea with
out question. Then Herb Herblin "
"Don't tell me the rest," objected
Skipper. "Don't bother! I've heard the
damn thing fifty times. He telegraphs
that he can't come. The girl is on her
way. Presto bunko! I become a goat.
Not unless my I. Q.'s 101, or less!"
"But she's a snappy blonde and
as "
"Just the kind I don't want."
"Well, suppose then, you change
with Joe. Alfreda Amelia Clinton is a
nice girl. Nice! Very nice! Such a
sweet face!"
"Nothing doing!"
"There you are! You'd have a won
derful time with this Mitzi Mayerle,
and you'd be as safe as a bootlegger
in Chicago. Don't worry, these en
gaged women "

"Engaged!"
"Yes, didn't you know she was en
gaged to Herb?"
"No! Damn peculiar the rest of the
crowd never said anything about it."
"Well, you see Mitzi has per
haps . She's been . Perhaps you
thought she wouldn't like it."
"Like it! What could be better? This
is just . Aw, the devil. I don't think
I'd better."
"Well, I'm not gonna start this all
over again. Oughta be a wow of a
party. You don't want to be out of it,
Skipper."
"I know it but . Well, I'll be
watching little me. I may have been
green once, but no woman can make
a fool out of me now."
"Atta boy! I'll say they can't. Not
even a knock-out like Mitzi."
*»* • •
"And so after all, Mitzi," Skipper
said as the two viewed the picturesque
Bubble Beach from a high and isolated
cliff, "we have something in common.
You're engaged, and so am I."
"Oh that really isn'tall we have in
common, Skipper. I like real big men
like you. Just look at the way you
won that foursome this morning. So
easily."
"Now, Mitzi, you know that my part
ner had a lot to do with that. You did
some wonderful playing. You know,
I really wish Caroline could play golf.
I'll have to teach her."
"Does she smoke?"
"No, she never does any of those
things. Just a sweet, pretty girl, and
very good to me."
"She's mighty lucky."
"Now I'll tell one."
"You don't believe me, Skipper."
"I didn't say that, but "
"It's too hot here in the sun," Mitzi
interrupted. "Let's go over there in
the shade of that cypress tree and sit
on the nice flat rock?"
"I think we'd better go back with
the rest of the bunch."
"Not yet, I'm too tired."
"But Mitzi . Oh, well, I suppose
it's all right."
"Now," she began emphatically,
when they had made themselves com
fortable, "tell me some more about
your very interesting self. Tell me all
about football."
"I'd rather not."
"Aw, come on, please? I know the
brave are modest, but you can do it
just for me, can't you, Skipper?"
"But I couldn't tell you anything you
haven't seen in the papers."
"Perhaps you couldn't, but I'd just
love to hear it all over again from
you, personally. Just from you."
"No, I've had enough of that stuff.
Every time I talk about athletics, it
gets into print. Why, even that golf
game this morning might be in the
paper tomorrow."
"Wouldn't that be wonderful? Do
you suppose they took a picture of
us?"
"I saw a man with a camera."
"You did? Oh, I hope he got one of
you fixing a tee for me. I wish I'd
worn my pink hat."
"Can't we talk about something
else?"
"Why should we? I think this is
wonderful!"
"I don't! I don't like it. Perhaps you
won't like it so much tomorrow, your
self."
"Why?"
"I think your back was turned when
he took the picture."
"Rats! Gee, that's the bunk. I'm
awfully sorry."
"Yes, of course."
"But it'll be an honor even to have
my name at the bottom of the picture
with —y-o-u-."
"Yes . Mitzi, please stop this
