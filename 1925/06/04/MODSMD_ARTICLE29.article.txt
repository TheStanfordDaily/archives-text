# LIBBY GIVES SPEECH ON WAR PREVENTION
## 
### 
"If we prepare thoroughly and effi
ciently for war, we will get war," de
clared Frederick J. Libby, executive
secretary of the National Council for
Prevention of War, in an address yes
terday afternoon in the Little Theatre.
Dr. Jordan introduced the speaker and
spoke briefly on the subject of peace.
Two philosophies of national secur
ity are contending for the control of
the foreign policy in America and Eu
rope, believes Libby. One of these is
the development of military strength
—this is peace by preparedness. "A
race in armaments leads to war. The
more furiously we build, the more
furiously they build, then comes the
crash and another world conflict.- It
has been the history of the world from
the beginning."
The other alternative for security is
organization and co-operation with the
rest of the world. Libby advocates
building a machinery adequate to set
tle all international disputes that
might cause war, and creating behind
this machinery a world opinion so
strong that no nation will defy it. For
this purpose he favors the existing
World Court with the Hughes reserva
tions, and the League of Nations with
reservations on Articles X and XVI.
"International understanding and
goodwill must be consistently culti
vated in the schools from the kinder
garten up," asserted Libby, in closing.

tary of *the National Council, spoke
