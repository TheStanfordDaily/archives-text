# High School Students Take Entrance Tests
## 
### 
Eight hundred and thirty-five new
students applying for undergraduate
standing at Stanford University took
the intelligence test given by Howard
R. Taylor, education graduate, and K.
M. Cowdrey, psychology graduate, in
their recent tour of the high schools
of California.
Members of the psychology depart
ment are scoring the papers at the
present time. No definite results have
yet been obtained, but one applicant,
a fifteen-year-old boy, graduate of a
Peninsula high school, made a score
of 113. According to Mr. Cowdrey, only
one in 700 persons has the ability to
make such a record, the average of
those admitted to Stanford last year
being 74.
The same test for admission will be
given in Portland this month.
