# DAVIS WILL TARE OVER FARCE DIRECTION ON RETURN
## "Polly With a Past" Makes Headway Under Charles Parks' Supervision 
### Herbert Klein 
The return of Gordon Davis to the
University is expected tomorrow. Dur
ing his trip lie has been seeing the
most important dramatic productions
in the East. One of his first official
acts after arriving will be to start
personal direction of the cast of "Polly
With a Past," the Senior Farce, now
being rehearsed for presentation on
June 17. Charles Parks has been di
recting the play and has brought the
production to a point that begins to
show the full possibilities of the com
edy when played by a group of actors
a§ carefully chosen for their parts as
those selected for the Farce.
Burks, Schwartz in Leads
The leads are taken by Aileene
Burks as Polly Shannon, alias Paulette
Bady, "the woman who made several
thrones totter and blazed a trail of
broken hearts across Europe," and
Leonard Schwartz as Rex van Zile,
the wealthy young bachelor who man
ages to fall in actual love with Polly
while merely playing at love to at
tract the attention of his fiancee, a
social-service worker.
The fiancee is Myrtle Davis, played
by Arbie Stewart. Her only desire is
to help others and, if possible, to lift
some poor derelict out of the gutter.
This does not work out very satisfac
torily for Rex, who receives notice
only when someone is needed to buy a
benefit ticket or to contribute to some
charity.
Rex is advised and aided in his love
troubles by his two bachelor friends,
Clay Collum, interior decorator and
artist, and Harry Richardson, played
by Alan Robertson and William Pabst
respectively. Together with the help
of their maid, Polly, recently arrived
from her home in a very small town,
they concoct a scheme that appears to
be a world-beater, namely to make it
appear that Rex is going the down
ward path himself so that Myrtle will
be inspired to try to redeem him. It
doesn't work out quite that way, how
ever, which is one of the main reasons,
why it all becomes so interesting.
"Polly With a Past" yas written by
George Middleton and Guy Bolton in
collaboration. It was. staged for Broad
way by David Belasco with Ina Claire
in the leading role in 1917.

tract the attention of his fiancee, a
social-service worker.
The fiancee is Myrtle Davis, played
by Arbie Stewart. Her only desire is
to help others and, if possible, to lift
some poor derelict out of the gutter.
This does not work out very satisfac
torily for Rex, who receives notice
only when someone is needed to buy a
benefit ticket or to contribute to some
charity.
Rex is advised and aided in his love
troubles by his two bachelor friends,
Clay Collum, interior decorator and
artist, and Harry Richardson, played
by Alan Robertson and William Pabst
respectively. Together with the help
of their maid, Polly, recently arrived
from her home in a very small town,
they concoct a scheme that appears to
be a world-beater, namely to make it
appear that Rex is going the down
ward path himself so that Myrtle will
be inspired to try to redeem him. It
doesn't work out quite that way, how
ever, which is one of the main reasons,
why it all becomes so interesting.
"Polly With a Past" yas written by
George Middleton and Guy Bolton in
collaboration. It was. staged for Broad
way by David Belasco with Ina Claire
in the leading role in 1917.
