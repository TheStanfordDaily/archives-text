# SENIORS DELAY PASSING ENDOWMENT FUND PLAN
## Insurance Idea Suggested for Distributing Cost of 1925 Gift 
### 
Decision to adopt a plan for estab
lishing a fund for the University was
made last night at a meeting of the
senior class. Two plans were sug
gested, a straight life insurance plan
making the University the beneficiary,
and an endowment insurance plan. The
class decided to wait for further in
vestigation before taking definite ac
tion.

The Endowment Insurance Plan as
suggested by W. J. Dickey and out
lined at the meeting by A. T. Conover
provides that each member of the
graduating class take out a small in
surance policy, $150 being suggested
as the approximate amount. Ihe policy
is to be paid the University at the
twentieth anniversary of the class.
Those favoring the plan argued that
by such a plan the burden of contribut
ing to the University would be distri
buted equally among members of the
class, whereas under conditions which
have formerly existed, the endowment
drive on the twentieth anniversary of
a class usually allows the burden to
fall on comparatively few members.
The supporters of the idea also said
that some such plan undoubtedly
would be adopted in the future at
Stanford, and it was hoped that the
class of *25 might establish the prece
dent. It was pointed out that a smilar
system is at present being used at
several Eastern institutions, including
Princeton and Harvard.
Professor E. G. Robinson outlined
the program for the exercises and
Baccalaureate Services in the Chapel
Sunday. He also told of the arrange
ments for Commencement exercises
on Monday.
Reports were given to the class by
the chairman of the various commit
tees. L. T. Browne told of the Senior j
Ball, Friday, June 19. A ticket sale
was held after the meeting at which
practically all the tickets were dis
tributed. W. J. Dickey told of the plans
for Senior Day, H. S. Chase of the
Promenade, and Harry Noland report
ed on the finances of the class.
An assessment of $2 apiece, payable
at the Alumni Secretary's offices at
the time when members sign the class
roll was approved by the class. The
Class Roll may be signed at the
Alumni Secretary's office next week.
Invitations may be secured at that
time at a cost of ten cents apiece.
The class also decided that a motto'
on the fountain which is to be the
Commemoration Gift of the Class of
1925 would be inappropriate. The foun
tain will be installed in the Law cor
ner of the Inner Quad under the direc
tion of the Commemoration Commit
tee, headed by E. G. Kahn.

Reports were given to the class by
the chairman of the various commit
tees. L. T. Browne told of the Senior j
Ball, Friday, June 19. A ticket sale
was held after the meeting at which
practically all the tickets were dis
tributed. W. J. Dickey told of the plans
for Senior Day, H. S. Chase of the
Promenade, and Harry Noland report
ed on the finances of the class.
An assessment of $2 apiece, payable
at the Alumni Secretary's offices at
the time when members sign the class
roll was approved by the class. The
Class Roll may be signed at the
Alumni Secretary's office next week.
Invitations may be secured at that
time at a cost of ten cents apiece.
The class also decided that a motto'
on the fountain which is to be the
Commemoration Gift of the Class of
1925 would be inappropriate. The foun
tain will be installed in the Law cor
ner of the Inner Quad under the direc
tion of the Commemoration Commit
tee, headed by E. G. Kahn.
Decision to adopt a plan for estab
lishing a fund for the University was
made last night at a meeting of the
senior class. Two plans were sug
gested, a straight life insurance plan
making the University the beneficiary,
and an endowment insurance plan. The
class decided to wait for further in
vestigation before taking definite ac
tion.

The Endowment Insurance Plan as
suggested by W. J. Dickey and out
lined at the meeting by A. T. Conover
provides that each member of the
graduating class take out a small in
surance policy, $150 being suggested
as the approximate amount. Ihe policy
is to be paid the University at the
twentieth anniversary of the class.
Those favoring the plan argued that
by such a plan the burden of contribut
ing to the University would be distri
buted equally among members of the
class, whereas under conditions which
have formerly existed, the endowment
drive on the twentieth anniversary of
a class usually allows the burden to
fall on comparatively few members.
The supporters of the idea also said
that some such plan undoubtedly
would be adopted in the future at
Stanford, and it was hoped that the
class of *25 might establish the prece
dent. It was pointed out that a smilar
system is at present being used at
several Eastern institutions, including
Princeton and Harvard.
Professor E. G. Robinson outlined
the program for the exercises and
Baccalaureate Services in the Chapel
Sunday. He also told of the arrange
ments for Commencement exercises
on Monday.
