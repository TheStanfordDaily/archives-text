# DAVIS WELL PLEASED BY CAST OF FARCE AT FIRST REVIEW
## Charles Parks to Relinquish Direction of "Polly With a Past" 
### 
Gordon Davis, after watching the re
liearsal of the Senior Farce lust night
1 for the first time since his return to
the campus, expressed himself well
pleased with the cast, and commented
i favorably on the effectiveness of
j "Polly With a Past."
The part of Polly, after whom the
play is named, is taken by Aileene
Burks, who has had experience in nu
merous campus plays. Leonard
Schwartz, known for his work in "You
and I," plays Rex Van Zile, the
wealthy young bachelor who tries so
hard to win the love of Myrtle Davis,
played by Arbie Stewart. To do this
he submits to a scheme by which it is
to appear that he is in the clutches of
Paulette Bady, "the wickedest woman
in Europe."
Polly Shannon, from a country par
sonage, is persuaded to masquerade
as the Mile. Bady, which she does with
great effectiveness and a remarkably
good French accent. The result is that
Rex actually falls in love with Polly
and Myrtle is left to continue her
chosen job of rescuing human dere
licts and aiding unfortunates.
One of Myrtle's poor unfortunates is
Stiles, "a brandied peach" who owed
his downfall to Demon Rum, and who
was "willing to do any sort of work
provided it didn't involve any effort."
Charles Burgess takes this part.
Harry Richardson and Clay Collum
are Rex's two friends who endeavor
to help him in his "affair of the heart"
and who are responsible for the trans
formation of Polly from their maid
into a brilliant French butterfly. Wil
liam Pabst takes the role of Collum
and Alan Robertson, of Richardson.
Other characters of the cast are j
Prentice Van Zile, Rex's rich uncle,
played by Norris James. Mrs.
Clementina Davis is interpreted by
Elsa Jean Barber and Commodore
"Bob" Barker by Dave Lamson. Others I
in the play are Margaret Stebbins, j
Ross Smith, and Hulda Hoover.
