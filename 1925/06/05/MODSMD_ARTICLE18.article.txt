# CARDINAL TRACKMEN TO WATCH RESULTS OF BIG TEN MEET
## 
### Douglas Meservey 
Ten teams will battle tomorrow at
Columbus, Ohio, for the track cham
pionship of the Big Ten Conference.
The results will be of interest to
the Pacific Coast since the majority
of the men who place are to be en
tered in the National Collegiate Asso
ciation meet at Chicago, June 12 and
13. As Stanford, California, and Wash
ington are also entering Competitors,
the western tracksters will have an
opportunity to contemplate the pos
sible competition in store for them
next week.
Michigan, with strong contenders in
every event, is favored to win. but
Illinois and Wisconsin are the "dark
horses." Michigan defeated the Illinois
tracksters 69 to 67 two weeks ago but,
as the meet was run in the rain, the
results are only partly indicative of
the comparative strergtli.
Illinois has been handicapped this
year by injuries to Kinsey, the Olym
pic hurdle champion; Brownell, the
indoor pole-vaulting champion; Make
ever, miler, who has nevertheless done
4:25 this season; and Evans and
Hughes, sprinters. All are said to be
improving, however, and it is possible
that Kinsey will give Leistner of Stan
ford a hard race.

0:49 2-5; Feinsinger of Michigan, :50
1-5; Wallace of Indiana, :50 2-5.
880 yards—Reinke of Michigan, 1:54
4-5; Martin of Northwestern, 1:55 4-5;
Ponzer of Illinois and Spradling of
Purdue, 1:56 4-5.
Other good marks made this season
in the Rig Ten include: 200 feet 5
inches by Northrup of Michigan in the
javelin; 0:9 3-5 (tying world's record)
in the hundred yard dash, by Hubbard
of Michigan; 25 feet 1 1-4 inches in
the broad jump, by Hubbard; 9:27 in
the two-mile by Phelps of Iowa; and
13 feet 1-2 Inch in the pole vault, by
Brooker of Michigan.
Ten teams will battle tomorrow at
Columbus, Ohio, for the track cham
pionship of the Big Ten Conference.
The results will be of interest to
the Pacific Coast since the majority
of the men who place are to be en
tered in the National Collegiate Asso
ciation meet at Chicago, June 12 and
13. As Stanford, California, and Wash
ington are also entering Competitors,
the western tracksters will have an
opportunity to contemplate the pos
sible competition in store for them
next week.
Michigan, with strong contenders in
every event, is favored to win. but
Illinois and Wisconsin are the "dark
horses." Michigan defeated the Illinois
tracksters 69 to 67 two weeks ago but,
as the meet was run in the rain, the
results are only partly indicative of
the comparative strergtli.
Illinois has been handicapped this
year by injuries to Kinsey, the Olym
pic hurdle champion; Brownell, the
indoor pole-vaulting champion; Make
ever, miler, who has nevertheless done
4:25 this season; and Evans and
Hughes, sprinters. All are said to be
improving, however, and it is possible
that Kinsey will give Leistner of Stan
ford a hard race.
