# HORSE SHOW OPENS WITH COSSACK RACE TOMORROW
## Silver Trophy Offered to Winner of Contest in Horsemanship 
### 
Final preparations have been made
; f° r the sixth annual Horse Show and
Tournament, which will open with the
Cossack race at 1:30 tomorrow at the
Encina Polo field. The field has been
put in condition by the Military de
partment for the ten events listed on
the program.
M. L. Brockway is favored for first
in the Cossack race, in which the stir
rups are crossed so as to bring the
rider on a level with the mount's back.
R. W. Mossman and K. C. Brown both
have fast horses and should push
Brockway hard for first.
1). M. Ersliam, riding 17, the fastest
horse entered, should make a strong
bid in the flat race, which depends
solely on the ability of horses and
riders. T. B. Criley is a good rider and
should place second.
Of the four entries in the Roman
race, in which the rider stands on the
backs of two horses, a ten-yard handi
cap will make hard riding necessary
for R. W. Mossman, riding last year's
winning team, 23 and 66, if he is to
come in first. L.' S. Tuttle should be
his chief competitor for first in this
event, with Criley and Brockway rid
ing hard for third.
No predictions can be made concern
ing the outcome of the steeplechase,
for the uncertainty as to the results
of the six jumps throughout the mile
course will allow any of the twelve
competitors a chance for first. Several
spills occurred in this event last year,
although no injuries resulted.
Even chances for success are given
any of the entries in the military
jumping contest.
H. L. Hjelm is given the edge over
the six competitors in the big event
of the day, the horsemanship contest.
Hjelm placed second in this event last
year. The winner will be awarded the
loving cup symbolic of Stanford's best
horseman.
Physical strength, speed, and endur
ance, together with practice, will de
cide the outcome of the Ladies' Musi
cal Chair, in which nine members of
the Women's Equitation Class are en
tered.

cap will make hard riding necessary
for R. W. Mossman, riding last year's
winning team, 23 and 66, if he is to

ing the outcome of the steeplechase,
for the uncertainty as to the results
of the six jumps throughout the mile

Wrestling—Monday Battery vs. Thurs
day Battery.
Final preparations have been made
; f° r the sixth annual Horse Show and
Tournament, which will open with the
Cossack race at 1:30 tomorrow at the
Encina Polo field. The field has been
put in condition by the Military de
partment for the ten events listed on
the program.
M. L. Brockway is favored for first
in the Cossack race, in which the stir
rups are crossed so as to bring the
rider on a level with the mount's back.
R. W. Mossman and K. C. Brown both
have fast horses and should push
Brockway hard for first.
1). M. Ersliam, riding 17, the fastest
horse entered, should make a strong
bid in the flat race, which depends
solely on the ability of horses and
riders. T. B. Criley is a good rider and
should place second.
Of the four entries in the Roman
race, in which the rider stands on the
backs of two horses, a ten-yard handi
cap will make hard riding necessary
for R. W. Mossman, riding last year's
winning team, 23 and 66, if he is to
come in first. L.' S. Tuttle should be
his chief competitor for first in this
event, with Criley and Brockway rid
ing hard for third.
No predictions can be made concern
ing the outcome of the steeplechase,
for the uncertainty as to the results
of the six jumps throughout the mile
course will allow any of the twelve
competitors a chance for first. Several
spills occurred in this event last year,
although no injuries resulted.
Even chances for success are given
any of the entries in the military
jumping contest.
H. L. Hjelm is given the edge over
the six competitors in the big event
of the day, the horsemanship contest.
Hjelm placed second in this event last
year. The winner will be awarded the
loving cup symbolic of Stanford's best
horseman.

ance, together with practice, will de
