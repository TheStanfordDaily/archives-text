"The longest that an audience can
laugh enjoyably is two hours and fif
teen minutes —'The Rivals' lasts just
that long," declared Clayton Hamil
ton, who spoke on "Sheridan, His
Plays and Place in the Theatre," yes
terday afternoon in the Little Theatre.
Hamilton, a dramatic critic, an
nounced the production of "The Ri
vals" in San Francisco next week, this
performance being the one hundred
and fiftieth anniversary of the play.
Sheridan's success as a playwright
was attributed to his method of being
thoroughly conventional, doing every
thing that everybody else did, but
•doing it better than everybody else did.
"He was endowed with a front page
personality," said Hamilton.
"The Rivals," Sheridan's first and
greatest play, is considered by Ham
ilton to be the funniest play in the
English language.
