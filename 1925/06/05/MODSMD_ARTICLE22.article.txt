President Wilbur recently said in discussing objections which were
raised against a plan of his, that if there were no opposition he would be
greatly disappointed, for then he would be forced to believe his idea to be
at least five years behind the times. We would have ourselves on record
as entirely agreeing with the President. Furthermore, we cordially invite
anybody who likes to be ahead of the time to stand with the Daily in this,
our hour of need, for there is at present objection enough to keep 75,892
adults and a kindergarten full of children at least 25 years ahead of the
next war.
A paper-full of viewpoints came from the eating clubs yesterday inti
mating that unholy things had been perpetrated, and today we are hon
ored by the W. C. T. U. resolution that the editor is a heinous rascal on
another count. Judging from the remarks about drinking which were
presented yesterday, there seems to be a bond in common between these
two, although the supposition yet remains to be substantiated.
It deeply grieves us to have to deny the allegations of these worthy
allies. To our best knowledge, there is not much to choose between cam
pus organizations, wherever located, in considering the drinking matter.
One is as dry as the other, a condition which, fortunately or unfortunately,
is entirely due to the efficiency of local enforcement. We refuse to dis
cuss a question about which there is such a paucity of facts.
What we are chiefly interested in pointing out is the fact that our bad
ness is not unmixed. If we refuse to lose our temper, it is not for want
of arguments.
