The decision of the senior class last night to make the University
beneficiary of an insurance fund has set a w6rthwhile precedent for other
classes. By this arrangement which is now being used in many eastern
universities Stanford will be assured of a definite amount; the cost will
be more evenly distributed among the individuals than heretofore; and the
way will be open for similar contributions from other classes.
Though the definite plan to be adopted has not yet been determined it is
assured that one plan will be selected in the near future. All bookkeping
and handling of the money will be taken care of by the Alumni Secretary
and thus members of the class will not be obligated to serve on committees
for these details.
The Class of Nineteen Twenty-five is to be congratulated on making
the most of such an opportunity. —F. S.
