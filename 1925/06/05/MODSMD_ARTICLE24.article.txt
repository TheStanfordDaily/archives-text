# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
This is a copy of the resolution
passed unanimously at the meeting
today of our organization.
Yours,
LOUISE JAMES,
President Palo Alto Women's
Christian Temperance Union.
Resolved:
By the W. C. T. U. of Palo Alto,
June 4,
That attention be directed to
the editorial in the Daily Palo
Alto, June 2, which declares the
dry law to be impossible of exe
cution and which rcommends its
modification or repeal;
That it would be as reasonable
to insist that the laws against
murder be modified or repealed
because there are more murders
in the U. S.- in proportion to the
population than in any other civi
lized country;
Or that the law of marriage be
modified or abolished because
there were 165,000 divorces in one
year, in 1923;
Or that laws against theft be
modified or abolished because the
prisons are full of thieves.
We declare that it is articles
such as the editorial in the Daily
Palo Alto that discourage enforce
ment and encourage infraction of
the dry law.
The W. C. T. U. especially de
plores the printing of an editorial
which is illogical and immoral in
the semi-official organ of a great
university.
