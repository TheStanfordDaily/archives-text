## EVOLUTION 
### Dy Steve O'Donnell 
Two hundred million years ago
In Asia where the fossils grow
The Deedods and the Feedlejees
Disported 'mongst the ferny trees.
They gobbled nuts and guzzled fruits
And wore for clothes their birthday
suits.
And now that deserts have encroached
And squigee eggs are daily broached,
The children of the Feedlejees
Live somberly where are no trees;
They swallow sand and alkali
And wonder what's beyond the sky.
But other places on the ground
The Deedods children run around
And ride in Fords and tinny cars
And oggle moons and sun and stars.
How come they life so differently?
Just blame it on heredity.
â€”L. A. B.
