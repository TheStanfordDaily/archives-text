The Editor, Sir:
Once a man got up in the United
States Senate and made a speech. An
other man replied, "Did the honorable
gentleman speak for the purpose or
against the purpose, or if not, for what
purpose did he speak?"
Of course it is true that an eating
club man may leave his organization
if he so pleases, but God help him
if he does; and that isn't the question
anyhow. The point is that if an or
ganization can do the same things as
another organization, it should fall
under the same laws; and fair play is
the law at Stanford University.
—X. Y. Z.

The seventy-fifth anniversary of the
admission of California into the Union
will be celebrated September 9, by a
state-wide jubilee.
