# SKIPPER SKIPPED
## Second Installment 
### T. E. Connolly 
Skipper stared very earnestly out
over the Pacific at nothing. "Mitzi, you
mustn't talk like this. It isn't right."
"But it's what's nearest my heart,
Skipper."
"No, not your heart —your mind.
I've heard it all before."
"Oh Dod, what have I dune now?"
"Forgotten Herb."
"Did you ever forget Caroline?"
"Why ! What's that got to do
with it? I mean this flattery of yours.
It's no way for -a girl like you to talk.
I think we'd better go.
"I think you're awfully mean to me,
Skipper."
"Not mean, Mitzi, just consider
ate. Let's go."
"I won't go with you thinking this
way of me."
"What way?"
"Oh you know what you said."
"Then I'll leave you here."
"Just try and do it. What'll the
bunch say when you return alone?"
"I believe you're a a
a dangerous!"
"Oh !"
"I didn't mean that. I'm sorry. Sorry
that the whole thing is going to end
this way. I knew I shouldn't have
stayed."
"Skipper, it can't end this way. I'm
sorry, too, for anything I said. I didn't
mean it. I won't do it any more."
"I should be saying that. It's my
fault."
"Your fault. I don't understand, Skip
per." ,
"Yes, mine."
"Won't you explain it, Skipper. I
thought "
"No, I'd rather not. It involves more
talk about myself. Let's just forget it
and be friends —frank friends."
"Do you think you will like me bet
ter that way, Skipper?"
"I know I will."
******
"You know, I hate to ask you to do
this, but I just can't help it. I bruised
my foot on a stone this afternoon, and
I must sit out the next dance. You
don't mind, do you?"
"No, it's too crowded to dance in
here, anyhow. I'd just as soon. Where
to?"
"You know that little bench at the
end of the path through the lawn. I'm
just wild about that spot."
"But the path is graveled, and you'll
hurt your foot worse than ever."
"No I won't. I can manage/'
"All right, but remember what you
promised?"
"Of course, Friend Skipper."
"Then we're on our way."
He found the bench she had desig
nated with some difficulty, but the
search was in no way hindered by
Mitzi's injured foot. "Mitzi," he began,
"it's darker here than I thought it
would be."
"Nice and dark," she assured him.
"Well!"
"Yes, Skipper, it is darker. Darker,
just like life. Darker and blacker than
I thought it ever could be."
"Mitzi, remember "
"I am, Skipper. That's just what I'm
doing. It's my heart that's bruised; not
my foot."
"I expected as much."
"Why?"
"I didn't think you could live up to
your agreement."
"Skipper, please don't be unreason
able! Please don't! I'm awfully blue
tonight."
"Cut it out!"
"That's no way to talk to a friend.
You're perfectly brutal!"
"But you're engaged."
"That's just what I want to talk
about. Talk about it to you, my friend."
"Well, go ahead. Proceed. I'll listen,
but that's all."
"You know I've been engaged to
Herb for about two months."
"Isn't that pretty long for a co-ed?"
"And," she continued, "he isn't treat
ing me right."
"In what way?"
"Well, he goes to one college, and I
to another, and and, well he's
always going out with other girls. Al
ways."
"He shouldn't do that. I don't be
lieve in it."
"I didn't think you would."
"Well, you're in love with him, aren't
you ?"
"I I suppose so."
"How does he treat you otherwise?"
"Wonderful! He writes every day,
the most wonderful letters. At first he
came down once a week, but last
month I only saw him once. Just once."
"I don't like to get into this. Herb
is a very good friend of mine, and he's
a fine boy. Have you any idea who
your rival is?"
"Not definitely, but that isn't all."
"It's bad enough, if you love him
as "
"Oh, there's something still far
worse. I think I'm in love with some
body else."
"Think?"
"Yes, but I'm not exactly certain.
You see, I haven't known him very
long."
"That's too bad. I was in the same
boat once. In fact. I'm not quite out
of it yet."
"You mean that you were in love
with somebody else?"
"Yes, and engaged to another girl."
"Then you can appreciate how I
feel."
"But you said you were in love with
Herb."
"I said I supposed I was, Skipper."
"Well, then why did you become en
gaged to him?"
"Why, he just rushed me to death.

! He was so nice, and he gave me every
thing I wanted. I don't know just how
it happened."
"Slightly temperamental, aren't
you?"
"Slightly."
"I feel sorry for you, Mitzi."
"I'm so glad. It feels so good to
know that you understand."
"I'm sorry you feel so bafd."
"Do you still love the other girl,
Skipper?"
"I can't say. All I know is that I'm
| still engaged to Caroline."
"And are you happy?"
"I don't know. Sometimes I think I
am, and then again . Oh, hell!
Caroline's so different. So very, very
different, and yet she-s so nice and
works so hard, and I don't treat her
right."
"Do you love her?"
"I did when I left home. I guess I
still do."
"Oh Oh !"
"Mitzi, as friend to friend, what are
we going to do?"
"Just sit and suffer in silence, I sup
pose. Sit and suffer for ever and ever.
I could cry. Oh, Skipper!"
He jumped to his feet. "Mitzi, get up
quickly!"
"What's the matter?"
"They're all coming out here."
"I don't care. I wish I were dead."
"But it would never do for us to be
seen out here like this. Both of us "
"They won't find us."
"Get up, Mitzi! They will if Mack
turns on all those Japanese lanterns
he had strung up this afternoon. I'll
bet that's just what they're going to
do."
"Do you think anyone would dare to
[criticize you, Skipper?"
"Don't be foolish. Get up. If you
don't I'll make you."
"Stop, Skipper, stop! You're muss
ing me all up."
"I'm not mussing you half as much
as you are yourself. Don't be foolish.
Joe left his roadster down there at the
end of the path. Let's go."
"Where?"
"Anywhere!"
"Lovely! Hurry before they come."
"Let's try and forget everything,"
she suggested as the roadster crept
quietly along in the pale moonlight,
"Everything, everything that makes us
unhappy."
"Do you think we can without ?"
"Of course we can. We agreed."
"I know that but . Say, I won
der if Joe will miss his car."
"Don't worry; he'll never think of
taking Alfreda Amelia riding."
"Guess you're right."
"Poor Joe."
"How come she's here, anyhow?"
"Mack's cousin and Mrs. Blair said
it had to be."
Skipper slouched down behind the
wheel and let the trim little roadster
wander along the. broad drive. The
speedometer added another mile to the
total before he spoke again. "He's a
regular martyr, Joe is. After all, I
guess I haven't so much to kick about.
A girl, full of life, and oh so very, very
easy to look at. Why! I'm lucky, lucky
—even if she is engaged."
"Do you really think so, Skipper?"
"Sure I do."
"I'm . Then why . What kind
of a girl do you like, Skipper?"
(To Be Continued)
Skipper stared very earnestly out

"But it's what's nearest my heart,

"I I suppose so."
"How does he treat you otherwise?"
"Wonderful! He writes every day,
the most wonderful letters. At first he
came down once a week, but last
month I only saw him once. Just once."
"I don't like to get into this. Herb
is a very good friend of mine, and he's
a fine boy. Have you any idea who
your rival is?"
"Not definitely, but that isn't all."
"It's bad enough, if you love him
as "
"Oh, there's something still far
worse. I think I'm in love with some
body else."
"Think?"
"Yes, but I'm not exactly certain.
You see, I haven't known him very
long."
"That's too bad. I was in the same
boat once. In fact. I'm not quite out
of it yet."
"You mean that you were in love
with somebody else?"
"Yes, and engaged to another girl."
"Then you can appreciate how I
feel."
"But you said you were in love with
Herb."
"I said I supposed I was, Skipper."
"Well, then why did you become en
gaged to him?"
"Why, he just rushed me to death.

! He was so nice, and he gave me every
thing I wanted. I don't know just how
it happened."
"Slightly temperamental, aren't
you?"
"Slightly."
"I feel sorry for you, Mitzi."
"I'm so glad. It feels so good to
know that you understand."
"I'm sorry you feel so bafd."
"Do you still love the other girl,
Skipper?"
"I can't say. All I know is that I'm
| still engaged to Caroline."
"And are you happy?"
"I don't know. Sometimes I think I
am, and then again . Oh, hell!
Caroline's so different. So very, very
different, and yet she-s so nice and
works so hard, and I don't treat her
right."
"Do you love her?"
"I did when I left home. I guess I
still do."
"Oh Oh !"
"Mitzi, as friend to friend, what are
we going to do?"
"Just sit and suffer in silence, I sup
pose. Sit and suffer for ever and ever.
I could cry. Oh, Skipper!"
He jumped to his feet. "Mitzi, get up
quickly!"
"What's the matter?"
"They're all coming out here."
"I don't care. I wish I were dead."
"But it would never do for us to be
seen out here like this. Both of us "
"They won't find us."
"Get up, Mitzi! They will if Mack
turns on all those Japanese lanterns
he had strung up this afternoon. I'll
bet that's just what they're going to
do."
"Do you think anyone would dare to
[criticize you, Skipper?"
"Don't be foolish. Get up. If you
don't I'll make you."
"Stop, Skipper, stop! You're muss
ing me all up."
"I'm not mussing you half as much
as you are yourself. Don't be foolish.
Joe left his roadster down there at the
end of the path. Let's go."
"Where?"
"Anywhere!"
"Lovely! Hurry before they come."
"Let's try and forget everything,"
she suggested as the roadster crept
quietly along in the pale moonlight,
"Everything, everything that makes us
unhappy."
"Do you think we can without ?"
"Of course we can. We agreed."
"I know that but . Say, I won
der if Joe will miss his car."
"Don't worry; he'll never think of
taking Alfreda Amelia riding."
"Guess you're right."
"Poor Joe."
"How come she's here, anyhow?"
"Mack's cousin and Mrs. Blair said
it had to be."
Skipper slouched down behind the
wheel and let the trim little roadster
wander along the. broad drive. The
speedometer added another mile to the
total before he spoke again. "He's a
regular martyr, Joe is. After all, I
guess I haven't so much to kick about.
A girl, full of life, and oh so very, very
easy to look at. Why! I'm lucky, lucky
—even if she is engaged."
"Do you really think so, Skipper?"
"Sure I do."
"I'm . Then why . What kind
of a girl do you like, Skipper?"
(To Be Continued)
Skipper stared very earnestly out
over the Pacific at nothing. "Mitzi, you
mustn't talk like this. It isn't right."
"But it's what's nearest my heart,
Skipper."
"No, not your heart —your mind.
I've heard it all before."
"Oh Dod, what have I dune now?"
"Forgotten Herb."
"Did you ever forget Caroline?"
"Why ! What's that got to do
with it? I mean this flattery of yours.
It's no way for -a girl like you to talk.
I think we'd better go.
"I think you're awfully mean to me,
Skipper."
"Not mean, Mitzi, just consider
ate. Let's go."
"I won't go with you thinking this
way of me."
"What way?"
"Oh you know what you said."
"Then I'll leave you here."
"Just try and do it. What'll the
bunch say when you return alone?"
"I believe you're a a
a dangerous!"
"Oh !"
"I didn't mean that. I'm sorry. Sorry
that the whole thing is going to end
this way. I knew I shouldn't have
stayed."
"Skipper, it can't end this way. I'm
sorry, too, for anything I said. I didn't
mean it. I won't do it any more."
"I should be saying that. It's my
fault."
"Your fault. I don't understand, Skip
per." ,
"Yes, mine."
"Won't you explain it, Skipper. I
thought "
"No, I'd rather not. It involves more
talk about myself. Let's just forget it
and be friends —frank friends."
"Do you think you will like me bet
ter that way, Skipper?"
"I know I will."
******
"You know, I hate to ask you to do
this, but I just can't help it. I bruised
my foot on a stone this afternoon, and
I must sit out the next dance. You
don't mind, do you?"
"No, it's too crowded to dance in
here, anyhow. I'd just as soon. Where
to?"
"You know that little bench at the
end of the path through the lawn. I'm
just wild about that spot."
"But the path is graveled, and you'll
hurt your foot worse than ever."
"No I won't. I can manage/'
"All right, but remember what you
promised?"
"Of course, Friend Skipper."
"Then we're on our way."
He found the bench she had desig
nated with some difficulty, but the
search was in no way hindered by
Mitzi's injured foot. "Mitzi," he began,
"it's darker here than I thought it
would be."
"Nice and dark," she assured him.
"Well!"
"Yes, Skipper, it is darker. Darker,
just like life. Darker and blacker than
I thought it ever could be."
"Mitzi, remember "
"I am, Skipper. That's just what I'm
doing. It's my heart that's bruised; not
my foot."
"I expected as much."
"Why?"
"I didn't think you could live up to
your agreement."
"Skipper, please don't be unreason
able! Please don't! I'm awfully blue
tonight."
"Cut it out!"
"That's no way to talk to a friend.
You're perfectly brutal!"
"But you're engaged."
"That's just what I want to talk
about. Talk about it to you, my friend."
"Well, go ahead. Proceed. I'll listen,
but that's all."
"You know I've been engaged to
Herb for about two months."
"Isn't that pretty long for a co-ed?"
"And," she continued, "he isn't treat
ing me right."
"In what way?"
"Well, he goes to one college, and I
to another, and and, well he's
always going out with other girls. Al
ways."
"He shouldn't do that. I don't be
lieve in it."
"I didn't think you would."
"Well, you're in love with him, aren't
you ?"
"I I suppose so."
"How does he treat you otherwise?"

easy to look at. Why! I'm lucky, lucky
—even if she is engaged."
"Do you really think so, Skipper?"
"Sure I do."
"I'm . Then why . What kind
of a girl do you like, Skipper?"
(To Be Continued)
Skipper stared very earnestly out
over the Pacific at nothing. "Mitzi, you
mustn't talk like this. It isn't right."
"But it's what's nearest my heart,
Skipper."
"No, not your heart —your mind.
I've heard it all before."
"Oh Dod, what have I dune now?"
"Forgotten Herb."
"Did you ever forget Caroline?"
"Why ! What's that got to do
with it? I mean this flattery of yours.
It's no way for -a girl like you to talk.
I think we'd better go.
"I think you're awfully mean to me,
Skipper."
"Not mean, Mitzi, just consider
ate. Let's go."
"I won't go with you thinking this
way of me."
"What way?"
"Oh you know what you said."
"Then I'll leave you here."
"Just try and do it. What'll the
bunch say when you return alone?"
"I believe you're a a
a dangerous!"
"Oh !"
"I didn't mean that. I'm sorry. Sorry
that the whole thing is going to end
this way. I knew I shouldn't have
stayed."
"Skipper, it can't end this way. I'm
sorry, too, for anything I said. I didn't
mean it. I won't do it any more."
"I should be saying that. It's my
fault."
"Your fault. I don't understand, Skip
per." ,
"Yes, mine."
"Won't you explain it, Skipper. I
thought "
"No, I'd rather not. It involves more
talk about myself. Let's just forget it
and be friends —frank friends."
"Do you think you will like me bet
ter that way, Skipper?"
"I know I will."
******
"You know, I hate to ask you to do
this, but I just can't help it. I bruised
my foot on a stone this afternoon, and
I must sit out the next dance. You
don't mind, do you?"
"No, it's too crowded to dance in
here, anyhow. I'd just as soon. Where
to?"
"You know that little bench at the
end of the path through the lawn. I'm
just wild about that spot."
"But the path is graveled, and you'll
hurt your foot worse than ever."
"No I won't. I can manage/'
"All right, but remember what you
promised?"
"Of course, Friend Skipper."
"Then we're on our way."
He found the bench she had desig
nated with some difficulty, but the
search was in no way hindered by
Mitzi's injured foot. "Mitzi," he began,
"it's darker here than I thought it
would be."
"Nice and dark," she assured him.
"Well!"
"Yes, Skipper, it is darker. Darker,
just like life. Darker and blacker than
I thought it ever could be."
"Mitzi, remember "
"I am, Skipper. That's just what I'm
doing. It's my heart that's bruised; not
my foot."
"I expected as much."
"Why?"
"I didn't think you could live up to
your agreement."
"Skipper, please don't be unreason
able! Please don't! I'm awfully blue
tonight."
"Cut it out!"
"That's no way to talk to a friend.
You're perfectly brutal!"
"But you're engaged."
"That's just what I want to talk
about. Talk about it to you, my friend."
"Well, go ahead. Proceed. I'll listen,
but that's all."
"You know I've been engaged to
Herb for about two months."
"Isn't that pretty long for a co-ed?"
"And," she continued, "he isn't treat
ing me right."
"In what way?"
"Well, he goes to one college, and I
to another, and and, well he's
always going out with other girls. Al
ways."
"He shouldn't do that. I don't be
lieve in it."
"I didn't think you would."
"Well, you're in love with him, aren't
you ?"
"I I suppose so."
"How does he treat you otherwise?"
"Wonderful! He writes every day,
the most wonderful letters. At first he
came down once a week, but last
month I only saw him once. Just once."
"I don't like to get into this. Herb
is a very good friend of mine, and he's
a fine boy. Have you any idea who
your rival is?"
"Not definitely, but that isn't all."
"It's bad enough, if you love him
as "
"Oh, there's something still far
worse. I think I'm in love with some
body else."
"Think?"
"Yes, but I'm not exactly certain.
You see, I haven't known him very
long."
"That's too bad. I was in the same
boat once. In fact. I'm not quite out
of it yet."
"You mean that you were in love
with somebody else?"
"Yes, and engaged to another girl."
"Then you can appreciate how I
feel."
"But you said you were in love with
Herb."
"I said I supposed I was, Skipper."
"Well, then why did you become en
gaged to him?"
"Why, he just rushed me to death.

! He was so nice, and he gave me every
thing I wanted. I don't know just how
it happened."
"Slightly temperamental, aren't
you?"
"Slightly."
"I feel sorry for you, Mitzi."
"I'm so glad. It feels so good to
know that you understand."
"I'm sorry you feel so bafd."
"Do you still love the other girl,
Skipper?"
"I can't say. All I know is that I'm
| still engaged to Caroline."
"And are you happy?"
"I don't know. Sometimes I think I
am, and then again . Oh, hell!
Caroline's so different. So very, very
different, and yet she-s so nice and
works so hard, and I don't treat her
right."
"Do you love her?"
"I did when I left home. I guess I
still do."
"Oh Oh !"
"Mitzi, as friend to friend, what are
we going to do?"
"Just sit and suffer in silence, I sup
pose. Sit and suffer for ever and ever.
I could cry. Oh, Skipper!"
He jumped to his feet. "Mitzi, get up
quickly!"
"What's the matter?"
"They're all coming out here."
"I don't care. I wish I were dead."
"But it would never do for us to be
seen out here like this. Both of us "
"They won't find us."
"Get up, Mitzi! They will if Mack
turns on all those Japanese lanterns
he had strung up this afternoon. I'll
bet that's just what they're going to
do."
"Do you think anyone would dare to
[criticize you, Skipper?"
"Don't be foolish. Get up. If you
don't I'll make you."
"Stop, Skipper, stop! You're muss
ing me all up."
"I'm not mussing you half as much
as you are yourself. Don't be foolish.
Joe left his roadster down there at the
end of the path. Let's go."
"Where?"
"Anywhere!"
"Lovely! Hurry before they come."
"Let's try and forget everything,"
she suggested as the roadster crept
quietly along in the pale moonlight,
"Everything, everything that makes us
unhappy."
"Do you think we can without ?"
"Of course we can. We agreed."
"I know that but . Say, I won
der if Joe will miss his car."
"Don't worry; he'll never think of
taking Alfreda Amelia riding."
"Guess you're right."
"Poor Joe."
"How come she's here, anyhow?"
"Mack's cousin and Mrs. Blair said
it had to be."
Skipper slouched down behind the
wheel and let the trim little roadster
wander along the. broad drive. The
speedometer added another mile to the
total before he spoke again. "He's a
regular martyr, Joe is. After all, I
guess I haven't so much to kick about.

to another, and and, well he's
always going out with other girls. Al
ways."
"He shouldn't do that. I don't be
lieve in it."
"I didn't think you would."
"Well, you're in love with him, aren't
you ?"
"I I suppose so."
"How does he treat you otherwise?"
"Wonderful! He writes every day,
the most wonderful letters. At first he
came down once a week, but last
month I only saw him once. Just once."
"I don't like to get into this. Herb
is a very good friend of mine, and he's
a fine boy. Have you any idea who
your rival is?"
"Not definitely, but that isn't all."
"It's bad enough, if you love him
as "
"Oh, there's something still far
worse. I think I'm in love with some
body else."
"Think?"
"Yes, but I'm not exactly certain.
You see, I haven't known him very
long."
"That's too bad. I was in the same
boat once. In fact. I'm not quite out
of it yet."
"You mean that you were in love
with somebody else?"
"Yes, and engaged to another girl."
"Then you can appreciate how I
feel."
"But you said you were in love with
Herb."
"I said I supposed I was, Skipper."
"Well, then why did you become en
gaged to him?"
"Why, he just rushed me to death.

! He was so nice, and he gave me every
thing I wanted. I don't know just how
it happened."
"Slightly temperamental, aren't
you?"
"Slightly."
"I feel sorry for you, Mitzi."
"I'm so glad. It feels so good to
know that you understand."
"I'm sorry you feel so bafd."
"Do you still love the other girl,
Skipper?"
"I can't say. All I know is that I'm
| still engaged to Caroline."
"And are you happy?"
"I don't know. Sometimes I think I
am, and then again . Oh, hell!
Caroline's so different. So very, very
different, and yet she-s so nice and
works so hard, and I don't treat her
right."
"Do you love her?"
"I did when I left home. I guess I
still do."
"Oh Oh !"
"Mitzi, as friend to friend, what are
we going to do?"
"Just sit and suffer in silence, I sup
pose. Sit and suffer for ever and ever.
I could cry. Oh, Skipper!"
He jumped to his feet. "Mitzi, get up
quickly!"
"What's the matter?"
"They're all coming out here."
"I don't care. I wish I were dead."
"But it would never do for us to be
seen out here like this. Both of us "
"They won't find us."
"Get up, Mitzi! They will if Mack
turns on all those Japanese lanterns
he had strung up this afternoon. I'll
bet that's just what they're going to
do."
"Do you think anyone would dare to
[criticize you, Skipper?"
"Don't be foolish. Get up. If you
don't I'll make you."
"Stop, Skipper, stop! You're muss
ing me all up."
"I'm not mussing you half as much
as you are yourself. Don't be foolish.
Joe left his roadster down there at the
end of the path. Let's go."
"Where?"
"Anywhere!"
"Lovely! Hurry before they come."
"Let's try and forget everything,"
she suggested as the roadster crept
quietly along in the pale moonlight,
"Everything, everything that makes us
unhappy."
"Do you think we can without ?"
"Of course we can. We agreed."
"I know that but . Say, I won
der if Joe will miss his car."
"Don't worry; he'll never think of
taking Alfreda Amelia riding."
"Guess you're right."
"Poor Joe."
"How come she's here, anyhow?"
"Mack's cousin and Mrs. Blair said
it had to be."
Skipper slouched down behind the
wheel and let the trim little roadster
wander along the. broad drive. The
speedometer added another mile to the
total before he spoke again. "He's a
regular martyr, Joe is. After all, I
guess I haven't so much to kick about.
A girl, full of life, and oh so very, very
easy to look at. Why! I'm lucky, lucky
—even if she is engaged."
"Do you really think so, Skipper?"
"Sure I do."
"I'm . Then why . What kind
of a girl do you like, Skipper?"
(To Be Continued)
Skipper stared very earnestly out
over the Pacific at nothing. "Mitzi, you
mustn't talk like this. It isn't right."
"But it's what's nearest my heart,
Skipper."
"No, not your heart —your mind.
I've heard it all before."
"Oh Dod, what have I dune now?"
"Forgotten Herb."
"Did you ever forget Caroline?"
"Why ! What's that got to do
with it? I mean this flattery of yours.
It's no way for -a girl like you to talk.
I think we'd better go.
"I think you're awfully mean to me,
Skipper."
"Not mean, Mitzi, just consider
ate. Let's go."
"I won't go with you thinking this
way of me."
"What way?"
"Oh you know what you said."
"Then I'll leave you here."
"Just try and do it. What'll the
bunch say when you return alone?"
"I believe you're a a
a dangerous!"
"Oh !"
"I didn't mean that. I'm sorry. Sorry
that the whole thing is going to end
this way. I knew I shouldn't have
stayed."
"Skipper, it can't end this way. I'm
sorry, too, for anything I said. I didn't
mean it. I won't do it any more."
"I should be saying that. It's my
fault."
"Your fault. I don't understand, Skip
per." ,
"Yes, mine."
"Won't you explain it, Skipper. I
thought "
"No, I'd rather not. It involves more
talk about myself. Let's just forget it
and be friends —frank friends."
"Do you think you will like me bet
ter that way, Skipper?"
"I know I will."
******
"You know, I hate to ask you to do
this, but I just can't help it. I bruised
my foot on a stone this afternoon, and
I must sit out the next dance. You
don't mind, do you?"
"No, it's too crowded to dance in
here, anyhow. I'd just as soon. Where
to?"
"You know that little bench at the
end of the path through the lawn. I'm
just wild about that spot."
"But the path is graveled, and you'll
hurt your foot worse than ever."
"No I won't. I can manage/'
"All right, but remember what you
promised?"
"Of course, Friend Skipper."
"Then we're on our way."
He found the bench she had desig
nated with some difficulty, but the
search was in no way hindered by
Mitzi's injured foot. "Mitzi," he began,
"it's darker here than I thought it
would be."
"Nice and dark," she assured him.
"Well!"
"Yes, Skipper, it is darker. Darker,
just like life. Darker and blacker than
I thought it ever could be."
"Mitzi, remember "
"I am, Skipper. That's just what I'm
doing. It's my heart that's bruised; not
my foot."
"I expected as much."
"Why?"
"I didn't think you could live up to
your agreement."
"Skipper, please don't be unreason
able! Please don't! I'm awfully blue
tonight."
"Cut it out!"
"That's no way to talk to a friend.
You're perfectly brutal!"
"But you're engaged."
"That's just what I want to talk
about. Talk about it to you, my friend."
"Well, go ahead. Proceed. I'll listen,
but that's all."
"You know I've been engaged to
Herb for about two months."
"Isn't that pretty long for a co-ed?"
"And," she continued, "he isn't treat
ing me right."
"In what way?"
"Well, he goes to one college, and I
to another, and and, well he's
always going out with other girls. Al

"He shouldn't do that. I don't be

wheel and let the trim little roadster
wander along the. broad drive. The
speedometer added another mile to the
total before he spoke again. "He's a
regular martyr, Joe is. After all, I
guess I haven't so much to kick about.
A girl, full of life, and oh so very, very
easy to look at. Why! I'm lucky, lucky
—even if she is engaged."
"Do you really think so, Skipper?"
"Sure I do."
"I'm . Then why . What kind
of a girl do you like, Skipper?"
(To Be Continued)
Skipper stared very earnestly out
over the Pacific at nothing. "Mitzi, you
mustn't talk like this. It isn't right."
"But it's what's nearest my heart,
Skipper."
"No, not your heart —your mind.
I've heard it all before."
"Oh Dod, what have I dune now?"
"Forgotten Herb."
"Did you ever forget Caroline?"
"Why ! What's that got to do
with it? I mean this flattery of yours.
It's no way for -a girl like you to talk.
I think we'd better go.
"I think you're awfully mean to me,
Skipper."
"Not mean, Mitzi, just consider
ate. Let's go."
"I won't go with you thinking this
way of me."
"What way?"
"Oh you know what you said."
"Then I'll leave you here."
"Just try and do it. What'll the
bunch say when you return alone?"
"I believe you're a a
a dangerous!"
"Oh !"
"I didn't mean that. I'm sorry. Sorry
that the whole thing is going to end
this way. I knew I shouldn't have
stayed."
"Skipper, it can't end this way. I'm
sorry, too, for anything I said. I didn't
mean it. I won't do it any more."
"I should be saying that. It's my
fault."
"Your fault. I don't understand, Skip
per." ,
"Yes, mine."
"Won't you explain it, Skipper. I
thought "
"No, I'd rather not. It involves more
talk about myself. Let's just forget it
and be friends —frank friends."
"Do you think you will like me bet
ter that way, Skipper?"
"I know I will."
******
"You know, I hate to ask you to do
this, but I just can't help it. I bruised
my foot on a stone this afternoon, and
I must sit out the next dance. You
don't mind, do you?"
"No, it's too crowded to dance in
here, anyhow. I'd just as soon. Where
to?"
"You know that little bench at the
end of the path through the lawn. I'm
just wild about that spot."
"But the path is graveled, and you'll
hurt your foot worse than ever."
"No I won't. I can manage/'
"All right, but remember what you
promised?"
"Of course, Friend Skipper."
"Then we're on our way."
He found the bench she had desig
nated with some difficulty, but the
search was in no way hindered by
Mitzi's injured foot. "Mitzi," he began,
"it's darker here than I thought it
would be."
"Nice and dark," she assured him.
"Well!"
"Yes, Skipper, it is darker. Darker,
just like life. Darker and blacker than
I thought it ever could be."
"Mitzi, remember "
"I am, Skipper. That's just what I'm
doing. It's my heart that's bruised; not
my foot."
"I expected as much."
"Why?"
"I didn't think you could live up to
your agreement."
"Skipper, please don't be unreason
able! Please don't! I'm awfully blue
tonight."
"Cut it out!"
"That's no way to talk to a friend.
You're perfectly brutal!"
"But you're engaged."
"That's just what I want to talk
about. Talk about it to you, my friend."
"Well, go ahead. Proceed. I'll listen,
but that's all."
"You know I've been engaged to
Herb for about two months."
"Isn't that pretty long for a co-ed?"
"And," she continued, "he isn't treat
ing me right."
"In what way?"
"Well, he goes to one college, and I
to another, and and, well he's
always going out with other girls. Al
ways."
"He shouldn't do that. I don't be
lieve in it."
"I didn't think you would."
"Well, you're in love with him, aren't
you ?"
"I I suppose so."
"How does he treat you otherwise?"
"Wonderful! He writes every day,
the most wonderful letters. At first he
came down once a week, but last
month I only saw him once. Just once."
"I don't like to get into this. Herb
is a very good friend of mine, and he's
a fine boy. Have you any idea who
your rival is?"
"Not definitely, but that isn't all."
"It's bad enough, if you love him
as "
"Oh, there's something still far
worse. I think I'm in love with some
body else."
"Think?"
"Yes, but I'm not exactly certain.
You see, I haven't known him very
long."
"That's too bad. I was in the same
boat once. In fact. I'm not quite out
of it yet."
"You mean that you were in love
with somebody else?"
"Yes, and engaged to another girl."
"Then you can appreciate how I
feel."
"But you said you were in love with
Herb."
"I said I supposed I was, Skipper."
"Well, then why did you become en
gaged to him?"
"Why, he just rushed me to death.

! He was so nice, and he gave me every
thing I wanted. I don't know just how
it happened."
"Slightly temperamental, aren't
you?"
"Slightly."
"I feel sorry for you, Mitzi."
"I'm so glad. It feels so good to
know that you understand."
"I'm sorry you feel so bafd."
"Do you still love the other girl,
Skipper?"
"I can't say. All I know is that I'm
| still engaged to Caroline."
"And are you happy?"
"I don't know. Sometimes I think I
am, and then again . Oh, hell!
Caroline's so different. So very, very
different, and yet she-s so nice and
works so hard, and I don't treat her
right."
"Do you love her?"
"I did when I left home. I guess I
still do."
"Oh Oh !"
"Mitzi, as friend to friend, what are
we going to do?"
"Just sit and suffer in silence, I sup
pose. Sit and suffer for ever and ever.
I could cry. Oh, Skipper!"
He jumped to his feet. "Mitzi, get up
quickly!"
"What's the matter?"
"They're all coming out here."
"I don't care. I wish I were dead."
"But it would never do for us to be
seen out here like this. Both of us "
"They won't find us."
"Get up, Mitzi! They will if Mack
turns on all those Japanese lanterns
he had strung up this afternoon. I'll
bet that's just what they're going to
do."
"Do you think anyone would dare to
[criticize you, Skipper?"
"Don't be foolish. Get up. If you
don't I'll make you."
"Stop, Skipper, stop! You're muss
ing me all up."
"I'm not mussing you half as much
as you are yourself. Don't be foolish.
Joe left his roadster down there at the
end of the path. Let's go."
"Where?"
"Anywhere!"
"Lovely! Hurry before they come."
"Let's try and forget everything,"
she suggested as the roadster crept
quietly along in the pale moonlight,
"Everything, everything that makes us
unhappy."
"Do you think we can without ?"
"Of course we can. We agreed."
"I know that but . Say, I won
der if Joe will miss his car."
"Don't worry; he'll never think of
taking Alfreda Amelia riding."
"Guess you're right."
"Poor Joe."
"How come she's here, anyhow?"
"Mack's cousin and Mrs. Blair said
it had to be."
Skipper slouched down behind the
wheel and let the trim little roadster
wander along the. broad drive. The
speedometer added another mile to the
total before he spoke again. "He's a
regular martyr, Joe is. After all, I
guess I haven't so much to kick about.
