# DR. ELLIOT APPOINTED FACULTY MEMBER BY DR. JORDAN IN 1891
## 
### 
Dr. O. L. Elliot, who is retiring as j
registrar on September 1, to be sue-;
ceeded by Professor Mitchell, was the '
first faculty member appointed by Dr. |
Jordan for Stanford University. He!
came here to Stanford June 25, 1891,
to take charge of the correspondence,
circulars, and applications which were
coming in to the new University, and
to take charge of the registration. He
has been with Stanford since that
time, acting as chief registrar through
out all the years of the University's
expansion and growth.
Dr. Elliot was born in Centerville,
New York, on March 8, 1860. He spent
his boyhood there, and then went to
Cornell, where he graduated in 18S5.
Thd next year he held a fellowship
there, and following that was made in
structor in English.
In the fall of 1890 the registrar at
Cornell suddenly resigned, and the
president of the university appointed
Professor Griffin, lately head of the
German department at Stanford, as
registrar temporarily, with Dr. Elliot
as his assistant.
Dr. Jordan, then president of Indi
ana University, came to Cornell in
January to attend a meeting of the
Board of Trustees of Cornell, of which
he was a member, and while there he
talked with Dr. Elliot regarding a po
sition as professor of economics at
Indiana. Three months later Dr. Jor
dan accepted the position offered him
by Mrs. Stanford to be president of
Stanford University. He immediately
sent for Dr. Elliot to come to Bloom
ington, Indiana, to take charge of all
the correspondence and preliminary
business prior to the opening, while
Dr. Jordan was busy gathering the
faculty, and getting the University
started. Both of them came to Stan
ford in June, 1891, and Dr. Elliot says
they spent a busy summer getting
ready for the fall quarter, which
opened October 1. It had been planned
to enroll about 300 students for the
first year, but when college did open,
540> students were registered, nearly a
hundred more than were at the Uni
versity of California the same year.
As Dr. Jordan had not procured a
professor of economics for the first
year, Dr. Elliot, besides his duties as
registrar, gave two courses in eco
nomics.
Dr. Elliot says he remembers the
first commencement at Stanford, which
was held in the old gymnasium since
the auditorium was not being used for
commencement exercises until 1899,
and the church not until later.
