# Firemen Rush to "Hot" Blaze in Cactus Garden
## 
### 
The early morning horseshoe game
at the fire department was interrupted
at 10 o'clock today by a small brush
fire north of the cactus gardens. Three
firemen and Chief Dugan rushed to the
conflagration with the small fire wagon
and Dugan's red coupe.
Several members of the Men's Coun
cil and Daily Palo Alto reporters were
on the spot to see the extinguishing
of what might have been a serious
fire in the Queener's domain.
Immediate cause of the blaze is un
known though it is believed that a hot
party late last night started the fire,
according to one of the reporters.
