# MARINE STATION TO GIVE EMBRYOLOGY COURSES IN SUMMER
## 
### 
Certain spring quarter courses being
given this quarter for the first time
at the Hopkins Marine Station at
Pacific Grove, will be continued
through the summer quarter. Other
new courses will be started to accom
modate summer quarter students.
The number of students who can
find accommodation in the Marine
laboratories varies with the registra
tion in the different courses. At pres
ent the following places are vacant:
Marine Zoology, 5 places; Element
ary Physiology of Marine Organisms,
2 places; Field Botany, 6 places; Com
parative Anatomy, 1 place; Advanced
Physiology, 7 places; Heredity and
Environment, no limit; Advanced Bot
any, no limit; Zoology Research (for
graduates), 8 or 10 places.
Courses on Marine Invertebrates and
Comparative Embryology are full.
In the summer quarter the courses
mentioned will be given by Professor
W. K. Fisher, Director of the Station,
and other regular members of the fac
ulty, and several visitors.
Among the noted physiologists and
zoologists to be included in the faculty
of the station will be Professor H. S.
Jennings of Johns Hopkins University,
a celebrated comparative anatomist;
Professor J. M. D. Olmstead of the
University of Toronto, who will spend
his third summer at the station; and
John S. Kingsley, Professor Emeritus
of Zoology at the University of Illinois.
The Hopkins Marine Station, which
is a department of Stanford Univer
sity, is located on Cabrillo Point be
tween the towns of Monterey and
Pacific Grove. It was founded in 1891
by David Starr Jordan and endowed
principally by Timothy Hopkins. The
present three-story reinforced con
crete building was erected in 1917 a
half mile from the site of the original
building. It contains five large labora
tories for classes, eight private labora
tories, a library, and numerous store-

rooms and specimen rooms

The station is open the entire year
to investigators and special students.
The departments of zoology and physi
ology schedule most of their summer
courses at the station instead of the
University. The use of the station is
tendered free of charge to investi
gators prepared to carry out research
work. A general registration fee of
$75 per quarter is charged for under
graduates.

The Hopkins Marine Station, which
is a department of Stanford Univer
sity, is located on Cabrillo Point be
tween the towns of Monterey and
Pacific Grove. It was founded in 1891
by David Starr Jordan and endowed
principally by Timothy Hopkins. The
present three-story reinforced con
crete building was erected in 1917 a
half mile from the site of the original
building. It contains five large labora
tories for classes, eight private labora
tories, a library, and numerous store-

rooms and specimen rooms

The station is open the entire year
to investigators and special students.
The departments of zoology and physi
ology schedule most of their summer
courses at the station instead of the
University. The use of the station is
tendered free of charge to investi
gators prepared to carry out research
work. A general registration fee of
$75 per quarter is charged for under
graduates.
