# "FLATTERING WORD" PLEASES AUDIENCE OF ONE-ACT PLAYS
## Grace Reade Makes Hit in "He Said and She Said" Last Evening 
### Herbert Klein 
j "The Flattering Word," one of the
two plays presented by Miss Elizabeth
Buckingham's class in dramatic inter
pretation, through its appealing clever
ness and humor, made "He Said and
She Said" seem slightly stilted by con
trast.
"Tell any man, woman, or child that
he should be on the stage and he will,
fall for it as a cat does for catnip," is
the "flattering word." The promised
effects on the various characters had
amusing results. Guy Holliday, who
was forceful in the part of the re
turned son in "The Little Stone
House," given several weeks ago, made
an effective minister.
Baylor Brooks showed polish in his
interpretation of a modern actor. Elea
nor Davidson did creditably as the
minister's wife.
Honors for successful comic effect
should go to Marjorie Allen, seen for
the first time in a juvenile role.
Aileene Burks, as her mother, made a
typical small-town mother, with all the
reputed ways.
"He Said and She Said" had many
clever lines, bnt the action was uncon
vincing, due more to the plot than
the presentation.
Grace Reade as the gossip whose*
active tongue causes trouble, was the
star in the play. Lida Rittler took the
part of Diana Esterbrook, but Edmund
Spellacy lacked forcefulness iti his
picture of the husband. The play dealt
with the way in which Dame Rumor
can warp an innocent story into a tale
of decidedly dangerous possibilities.
The last presentation of plays will
be given by the dramatics class on
Thursday of next week.
Aileene Burks directed "He Said and
She Said" and Lida Rittler directed
"The Flattering Word."
