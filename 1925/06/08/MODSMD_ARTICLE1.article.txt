Rauschnabel Is Artist
W. R. Rauschnabel of San Francis
co, one of the West's most noted com
mercial artists, did all borders, color
plates, section openers and end sheets.
His pen and ink style bears a marked
resemblance to woodcuts. Especially
distinctive are the five original oil
paintings used to carry the theme of
the book. These are reproduced in full
page size with a four color process.
Living group residences were sketched
in line drawings by Cleveland Mc-
Donald, also of San Francisco.
The cover, one of the book's finest
features, is Rauschnabel's design.
John Henry Nash of San Francisco
advised with the typography of the
volume and laid out two pages. Print
ing and binding of the lot of over 2,000
volumes was done at the university
press.
