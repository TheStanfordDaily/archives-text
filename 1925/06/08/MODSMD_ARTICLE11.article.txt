# TRAINING KINDERGARTEN RELIC ON STOCK FARM
## 
### M. D. Eaton 
Among the many interesting relics
on the Stanford stock farm is a curi
ous enclosure once known as the Kin
dergarten because it was there that
Senator Stanford taught his colts to
j trot. The structure is located about
I fifty yards from the large red barn
, which stands at the head of Lagunita.
The kindergarten has been made
over into a stable, but the outlines of
the original building are still in evi
dence. It was an oval track about 100
1 yards in circumference and eight feet
wide. The track itself was. covered,
but the central space was open. This
made it possible to train the colts even
during the rainy season and at the
same time retain the advantages of
| out-door work. The outside edge of
the track was enclosed by a wall and
| the inside by a low fence.
Tho original kiindergarten which
stood on the other side of the barn
was torn down a few years ago. This
structure like the one Just described,
consisted of a roofed track, which was

| surrounded by stalls where the colts
were kept. In the center of the en
closure was a covered stand from
which Senator Stanford and his
friends watched the young thorougli
j breds perform.
Colts Trained
At the age of about eight months,
or as soon as the colts had been
weaned, they were brought to the
kindergarten. Here they were kept,
two in a stall so that they would not
get lonesome, until they had learned
i to trot at racing speed.
The first step in the process was
breaking the colts to the halter. As
soon as this was accomplished and
the colts had become gentle, they were
i taken onto the kindergarten track and
made to trot.
Two men with long whips were sta
tioned inside the two curves of the
track. The colts were kept trotting
around as fast as possible, but. as soon
; as one broke and startad to run it was
! headed off and made to trot again.
In order to prevent the short curve*
causing an uneven pace, the colts
were sent in one direction for a time
and then in the other. By commenc
ing with a slow trot and gradually
increasing the speed from day to day,
the colts were finally taught to go
around the track trotting at a good
speed.
Colts Were Booted
Several colts were always kept
booted and tied near the track while
the others were being taught to trot.
Boots are necessary on a trotting
horse because the feet often interfere
when the horse trots fast.
When the colts had learned to trot,
they were taken into a larger track
and trained for racing. The remains
of an open track where colts and un
ruly horses were trained still stands
near the kindergarten. This track has
an especially high rail on the curves to
make the horse go around them prop
erly.

1 yards in circumference and eight feet
wide. The track itself was. covered,
but the central space was open. This
made it possible to train the colts even
during the rainy season and at the
same time retain the advantages of
| out-door work. The outside edge of
the track was enclosed by a wall and
| the inside by a low fence.
Tho original kiindergarten which
stood on the other side of the barn
was torn down a few years ago. This
structure like the one Just described,
consisted of a roofed track, which was

| surrounded by stalls where the colts
were kept. In the center of the en
closure was a covered stand from
which Senator Stanford and his
friends watched the young thorougli
j breds perform.
Colts Trained
At the age of about eight months,
or as soon as the colts had been
weaned, they were brought to the
kindergarten. Here they were kept,
two in a stall so that they would not
get lonesome, until they had learned
i to trot at racing speed.
The first step in the process was
breaking the colts to the halter. As
soon as this was accomplished and
the colts had become gentle, they were
i taken onto the kindergarten track and
made to trot.
Two men with long whips were sta
tioned inside the two curves of the
track. The colts were kept trotting
around as fast as possible, but. as soon
; as one broke and startad to run it was
! headed off and made to trot again.
In order to prevent the short curve*
causing an uneven pace, the colts
were sent in one direction for a time
and then in the other. By commenc
ing with a slow trot and gradually
increasing the speed from day to day,
the colts were finally taught to go
around the track trotting at a good
speed.
Colts Were Booted
Several colts were always kept
booted and tied near the track while
the others were being taught to trot.
Boots are necessary on a trotting
horse because the feet often interfere
when the horse trots fast.
When the colts had learned to trot,
they were taken into a larger track
and trained for racing. The remains
of an open track where colts and un
ruly horses were trained still stands
near the kindergarten. This track has
an especially high rail on the curves to
make the horse go around them prop
erly.
Among the many interesting relics
on the Stanford stock farm is a curi
ous enclosure once known as the Kin
dergarten because it was there that
Senator Stanford taught his colts to
j trot. The structure is located about
I fifty yards from the large red barn
, which stands at the head of Lagunita.
The kindergarten has been made
over into a stable, but the outlines of
the original building are still in evi
dence. It was an oval track about 100
1 yards in circumference and eight feet
wide. The track itself was. covered,
but the central space was open. This
made it possible to train the colts even
during the rainy season and at the
same time retain the advantages of
| out-door work. The outside edge of
