The two were accompanied by four j
University of California racquet men who
will play with them in a number of east
ern contests. The Bruin team consists of
Captain Chandler, Hillis, Stratford, and
Stowe.
Holman is expected to make the best
showing of the six men leaving from the
state of California because of his im
provement during the season. His first
important test will come on June 22 when l
he and Ogden enter the national intercol-1
legiates at Haverford, near Philadelphia, |

lace Scott, of Washington University, j
1924 champion who is not favored to win I
this year, Carl Fisher, 1923 champion,!
Jones of Yale, of Leigh, and,
Whitback of Harvard.
After a number of invitational meets j
011 the eastern coast, Ogden will leave for j
Newport, Rhode Island, while Holman
is to enter the national junior singles and:
doubles tournament at the South Side j
Tennis club, Chicago.
Holman was runner-up in 1924 to j
George Lottc, 1923 champion, but since
the latter is ineligible this season because
of the age limit, the former is favored to
win the 1925 crown. His only competition j
will come from Johnson of Boston, ranked
seventh last year; and Pare, ranked fifth
nationally.
■ Herrington, of Stanford, ranked sixth
nationally is ineligible to compete this:
year as arc Sullivan and Orser, ranked I
third and fourth respectively.
