I. C. A. A. A. A. championships one ;
week ago while one, the pole vault, i

high hurdles, javelin, 220-yard low j

events in the I. C. A. A. A. A. meet, j
however, bettered the same ones at |
Columbus, namely, the shot put, 330,
880, discus, two-mile, and hammer-1
throw.
Chicago Star Surprises
One of the surprises of the Big Ten
meet is of vital interest to Stanford j
track followers. It was the remarkable j
performance of Russel of Chicago in
the high jump with his leap of 6 feet
6 inches. He had been a slight favor
ite to win the event from McGinnis
of Wisconsin although both had made
6 feet 4 inches previously this season, i
Reinke, for several months the fa-!
vorite to win the 880, fulfilled expec-'
tations by breaking the tape in |
1;54 84-100. lie has been consistent at I
that time most of the season and i
should finish around 1:54 next Satur-,

Chicago Star Surprises
One of the surprises of the Big Ten
meet is of vital interest to Stanford j
track followers. It was the remarkable j
performance of Russel of Chicago in
the high jump with his leap of 6 feet
6 inches. He had been a slight favor
ite to win the event from McGinnis
of Wisconsin although both had made
6 feet 4 inches previously this season, i
Reinke, for several months the fa-!
vorite to win the 880, fulfilled expec-'
tations by breaking the tape in |
1;54 84-100. lie has been consistent at I
that time most of the season and i
should finish around 1:54 next Satur-,

Michigan who have both done 1:55. j
Michigan athletes won the annual j
■outdoor track championship held by
the Big Ten Conference at Columbus,
Ohio, Saturday, with a total of 45%

tracksters wearing the Cardinal of j
Stanford will be matched against the j
same great team from Michigan and
the others of the Big Ten Conference
in the annual National Collegiate As
sociation track meet at Chicago.
A comparison of the results last 1
Saturday with the performances dur- j
ing the season of Coach R. L. Tem-<
pleton's small squad shows that the I
latter will have plenty of competition !
In its race for national honors.
It is also interesting to note that'
out of the fifteen events Saturday, the
results of eight bettered those of the
I. C. A. A. A. A. championships one ;
week ago while one, the pole vault, i
was a tie at 13 feet. The Big Ten meet
came out ahead in the 100-yard dash, j
220-yard dash, broad jump, 120-yard j
high hurdles, javelin, 220-yard low j
