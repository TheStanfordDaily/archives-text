Indignation simply boils over in a communication to the Safety Valve
column conducted by our metropolitan colleagues. Some self-righteous
soul who signs himself "Fair Play" announces to all who may be worried
about it, that if he were on the Stanford University board, he would
promptly order off the campus all those members of the Chinese Club who
had a hand in the sending of a cablegram of sympathy to the Shanghai
anti-foreign strikers.
However, there are no gentlemen of such constricted vision on the
"Stanford University board." It should be obvious that it is every bit as
bad taste to make anti-Oriental demonstrations in this country as it is for
the Chinese Club to publicly go contrary to the sentiments of their foreign
hosts. .
Granting that the Chinese are sincere and that they would be pleased
to see their country again in a proud position, they have adopted a stupid
means of assisting. What we are afraid of is that a stupid means of re
taliating will be used. The shoe has been on the other foot.
Some time ago one of our co-students broke into print on the subject
of profesisonalism in athletics. His charges were proven to be false and
when he again reiterated his position, he was universally considered a rum
duni.

Presently, however, a group of precipitous patriots adopted Klan
methods and lashed him to a tree where a sign was hung around his neck
to proclaim his shame. And everybody who witnessed the demonstration
felt sorry about it; so, finally, instead of being generally considered an un
fortunate ass, he became an unfortunate martyr.
The members of the Chinese Club are undoubtedly very badly-behaved
boys and they deserve some rebuke for their poor manners. But a lot of
narrow-minded, rah-rah, intolerant violence will misguided and will
hurt whatever effective means of accomplishing this chiding may be had. ,

Whether the club meant to meddle with what it should not have al
lowed to concern it, has not been proven. It seems to have, however.
And so long as it has created the bad impression, the members should
know that we do not esteem them more highly for it.
The rebuke is the business of the Men's Council or the University or
some other officials. The rest of us can learn a lesson from the Chinese
Club members' mistake and mind our own business.
