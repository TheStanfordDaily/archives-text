# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
The "Viewpoint" in your columns
last week on the subject of Prohibition
cannot be read with entirely unmixed
emotions, —especially by one inter
ested in that local side show tent of
the Greatest Show on Earth, the W. C.
T. U. It is, of course, regrettable that
these eminently respectable ladies
should have been shocked by the bald
implication that, while God is in His
Heaven, all is not entirely right with
the world. And this, I understand, is
what your previous editorial did ac
tually imply when it says that an un
enforced Prohibition law is worse than
no law at all. It is, however, much
more regrettable that these same emi
nently respectable ladies should have
taken it upon themselves to reply to
this implication, and that, having
thrown reason to the winds, they
» should have disguised their ponderous
platitudes under clumsy sarcasm,
which, while perhaps intended to have
been biting, can best be described as
"Teething."
The ladies of the W. C. T. U., having
juggled copiously with nice, important
sounding words like "resolved" and
"deplored." go on to say that the laws
of homicide are occasionally shattered
and therefore should as reasonably be
repealed; that the same is true of the
marriage laws because several people
got divorced in 1923; and lastly, that
such an editorial is immoral, encour
ages law-breaking, is inimical to dem
ocratic government, and that such an
editorial should not appear in a col
lege paper.
And now, brushing away the salt
tears that obscure my vision after
reading that, I will consider the afore
mentioned points.
First —that there is as close an
analogy between the murder laws and
the Eighteenth Amendment as there
is between the Law of Gravitation and
the Mann Act; that the Eighteenth
Amendment is not only un-enforced
but unenforceable; that this Is true
because a law which prohibits drink
ing among many to prevent drunken- j
ness among a few is contrary to the

jprinciples of liberty; and that, while
it cannot be proven or disproven by
i statistics, it is a tenable theory that
the increased number of murders is a
I direct result of Prohibition (see
; Freud).
Secondly—that marriage is alike
i founded on other than legal grounds
i (see Darwin); and that ror every mar
riage wrecked by pre-Prohibition
drinking there are two wrecked by
the new "lets-kill-the-bottle" spirit re
sulting from Prohibition.
Thirdly—that the principle of dem
ocratic government allows the minor
ity no rights, except one, the right of
objecting, by word and by ballot, to
those features of law or policy which
are incompatible with their political
views; that the functioning of demo
j cratic government depends on each
citizen praising or objecting as intel
ligently as possible; and that any hon
! est attempt at criticism, right or
i wrong, is infinitely better than the
I Pollv-Ananias attitude of Puritanical
bigotry, recently displayed in that
I product of the small-town, feminine
i mob-psychology, the W. C. T. U. reso
lution.
