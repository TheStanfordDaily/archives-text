# ONE WOMAN SAYS TO ANOTHER
## 
### 
Jeremiah's wife and Lot's wife had al
ways been great pals, even before they
had gone away to boarding school they
liad played with dolls together and each
had trusted the other with her confidence
in matters of the greatest secrecy.
Lot's wife had always been a healthy
girl, with the bloom of radiant youth on
her check, she had always received the at
tention of her little boy friends and was
popular even among her closest girl as
sociates.
Jeremiah's wife on the other hand,
though she was the nicest kind of a girl,
could never hold the attentions of boys
that came to visit her. Among her own
.girl friends she was liked, but seemed to
be always left out of their parties. She
lacked the vitality and the freshness of
young girlhood that her friend Lot's wife
had.
One day when the two girls were sitting
alone together, Jeremiah's wife lay her
hand on the arm of her friend and said,
"How do you do it dear, when I cannot ?"
"It's just that I have the pep when other
girls are tired," Lot's wife replied cor
dially, "I can still dance when other girls
have passed out. I attribute my endur
ance to Kidia Linkums Assorted Veget
ables (adv.), they satisfy, you know."
And so the years passed and the two
girls traveled together the path leading
from girlhood to womanhood. Lot's wife
married Lot, Jeremiah's wife married
Jeremiah, and then Lot's wife with all the
assurance that her vibrant personality
gave her, spoiled all by changing to a
pillar of salt, which stands to this day
as a fitting memorial to that great bene
factor of womankind, Kidia Linkum.
