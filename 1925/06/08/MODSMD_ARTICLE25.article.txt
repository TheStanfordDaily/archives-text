THE EARLY BlßD—Stanford
This is a really funny comedy if you
like to see trick stuff, and Johnny
Hines can pull that to perfection.
Acting and plot are mere details in the
picture, and one is glad that they are
not present to take away from the
humor of the situations.
The milk-wagon is the best thing we
have seen in a long while and when
with the spare wheel it is converted
into a sporty buggy with a patent
and milk r shaker it is
even better. We are also glad to know
how to get two cups of coffee at the
automat.
Altogether, it certainly is a good
picture to interrupt the grinding for
exes —no mental labor and a bunch of
laughs.—D. T. R.
