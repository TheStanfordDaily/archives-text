# SKIPPER SKIPPED

### T. E. Connolly 
"Why! One just like yourself,
Mitzi."
"But I'm not like Caroline."
"Yes, but "
"And still you're engaged to her."
"But you "
"Why?"
"Sometimes I ask myself that ques
tion, too."
"And how do you answer it?"
"How do you answer yours?"
"Skipper, I don't know. I don't know
what to say. I'm getting unhappier and
unhappier all the time. Life is such a
disappointment."
"But you shouldn't be. I've heard
that you've always had lots of men
around."
"Yes, but what satisfaction is there
in that?"
"Well, you got the one you wanted,
didn't you?"
"Oh, but Skipper, you don't know
how it feels! I don't believe any of
them. I'm not sure of Herb. I could
almost cry!"
"Please don't; it isn't good for the
complexion."
"Oh, don't talk like that! You sound
just as cruel as the rest."
"I am."
"Mitzi, you're getting just what's
coming to you. Co-eds collect all the
fraternity pins they can, or all the
rings they can. They revel in their
duplicity. They don't care what be
comes of the man, but some day they
wake up and then "
"Skipper, you ARE cruel. I'm in no
condition to listen to that kind of talk
tonight."
"I know how you feel, Mitzi. I'm
sorry. Please forgive me. I hate to
hurt anybody's feelings."
"Oh, Skipper, no man can ever know
how blue I really am." Mitzi began to
wipe the sides of her nose with a
handkerchief.
"I'm sure I can, lyiitzi."
The girl other way for
several seconds before she spoke.
"Why, Skipper?"
Because because I've been in
the same position myself."
"Oh, I knew that somewhere in this
world there would be a man to under
stand —somebody to give me just a
little sympathy. I've been so lone
some."
"There, there, now, don't cry," said
Skipper, putting his arm around her
and petting her shoulder tenderly.
"It'll be all right. Would it do any
good if I spoke to Herb?"
"Oh, no, no, Skipper. He's got an
awful temper."
"Well, I'm not greatly worried about
men with tempers."
"It's awfully kind of you, dear, but J
want the man I marry to love me," and
she looked up at him.
"I see," he replied, "and you don't
want is to be just because he's en
gaged to you, and somebody "
"How understanding you are. How
truly you speak. What difference does
an engagement make, if you don't love

j the man or the girl? What are en
gagements for if they aren't so one
can change their mind. Once they're
made they stick for quite a while just
because of of of custom."
"They're easy enough to make all
' right. You know I'm beginning to be
lieve you're sincere."
"I'm glad."
"Does Herb know you feel like
this?"
"I don't know."
"Why don't you tell him?"
"I don't know."
"What do you know?"
"Oh, I'm so glad to have found you,
Skipper. I feel so much happier when
.I'm with you."
I "Now Mitzi "
"Would you think it horribly wrong
to be in love with anybody who was
engaged?"
"That isn't for me to say under
J the "
The girl carefully laid her head
upon his shoulder. "Skipper, I'll never
tell anybody but you, but Herb is just
terrible to me. He's not only lying to
me, but last time he came to see me
he was was was DRUNK!"
"I never knew Herb did that. I
thought "
"That's just it. Nobody knows what
| I have to put up with."
"I guess you've had a hard time all
right."
"But what's worse, everybody'll say
that I was cut out by that other girl,
whoever she is, and I've never been
thrown down before."
"I can see why you've never been
deserted, all right."
"Can you, Skipper?"
"I think so, Mitzi."
"Stop here, will you, Skipper?" she
said, and pushed the car out of gear
with her free hand. Skipper let the
road coast to one side of the road and
then shut off the switch.
"Why stop here, Mitzi? Better scen
ery further on."
"Why! Why because you were just
telling me you could see why I always
had plenty of attention."
"I know, but "
"Please don't try to find some ob
jection. I'm tired of objections. Can't
you just say something nice to me,
yourself? Just some little thing to
make me feel better? Something to
make life worth living? Please?"
"You're awfully pretty?"
"Oh, Skipper, that's the same old
thing. What good does it do me to be
pretty when the man I love ?" She
nestled snugly on his shoulder and
grasped his arm with two dainty
hands.
"But I've told you," he interrupted,
"that I'd fix things up with Herb if
you wanted me to."
"Skipper, you're the most wonderful
man I ever knew."
(To Be Continued)
"Why! One just like yourself,
Mitzi."
"But I'm not like Caroline."
"Yes, but "
"And still you're engaged to her."

truly you speak. What difference does
an engagement make, if you don't love

j the man or the girl? What are en
gagements for if they aren't so one
can change their mind. Once they're
made they stick for quite a while just
because of of of custom."
"They're easy enough to make all
' right. You know I'm beginning to be
lieve you're sincere."
"I'm glad."
"Does Herb know you feel like
this?"
"I don't know."
"Why don't you tell him?"
"I don't know."
"What do you know?"
"Oh, I'm so glad to have found you,
Skipper. I feel so much happier when
.I'm with you."
I "Now Mitzi "
"Would you think it horribly wrong
to be in love with anybody who was
engaged?"
"That isn't for me to say under
J the "
The girl carefully laid her head
upon his shoulder. "Skipper, I'll never
tell anybody but you, but Herb is just
terrible to me. He's not only lying to
me, but last time he came to see me
he was was was DRUNK!"
"I never knew Herb did that. I
thought "
"That's just it. Nobody knows what
| I have to put up with."
"I guess you've had a hard time all
right."
"But what's worse, everybody'll say
that I was cut out by that other girl,
whoever she is, and I've never been
thrown down before."
"I can see why you've never been
deserted, all right."
"Can you, Skipper?"
"I think so, Mitzi."
"Stop here, will you, Skipper?" she
said, and pushed the car out of gear
with her free hand. Skipper let the
road coast to one side of the road and
then shut off the switch.
"Why stop here, Mitzi? Better scen
ery further on."
"Why! Why because you were just
telling me you could see why I always
had plenty of attention."
"I know, but "
"Please don't try to find some ob
jection. I'm tired of objections. Can't
you just say something nice to me,
yourself? Just some little thing to
make me feel better? Something to
make life worth living? Please?"
"You're awfully pretty?"
"Oh, Skipper, that's the same old
thing. What good does it do me to be
pretty when the man I love ?" She
nestled snugly on his shoulder and
grasped his arm with two dainty
hands.
"But I've told you," he interrupted,
"that I'd fix things up with Herb if
you wanted me to."
"Skipper, you're the most wonderful
man I ever knew."
(To Be Continued)
"Why! One just like yourself,
Mitzi."
"But I'm not like Caroline."
"Yes, but "
"And still you're engaged to her."
"But you "
"Why?"
"Sometimes I ask myself that ques
tion, too."
"And how do you answer it?"
"How do you answer yours?"
"Skipper, I don't know. I don't know
what to say. I'm getting unhappier and
unhappier all the time. Life is such a
disappointment."
"But you shouldn't be. I've heard
that you've always had lots of men
around."
"Yes, but what satisfaction is there
in that?"
"Well, you got the one you wanted,
didn't you?"
"Oh, but Skipper, you don't know
how it feels! I don't believe any of
them. I'm not sure of Herb. I could
almost cry!"
"Please don't; it isn't good for the
complexion."
"Oh, don't talk like that! You sound
just as cruel as the rest."
"I am."
"Mitzi, you're getting just what's
coming to you. Co-eds collect all the
fraternity pins they can, or all the
rings they can. They revel in their
duplicity. They don't care what be
comes of the man, but some day they
wake up and then "
"Skipper, you ARE cruel. I'm in no
condition to listen to that kind of talk
tonight."
"I know how you feel, Mitzi. I'm
sorry. Please forgive me. I hate to
hurt anybody's feelings."
"Oh, Skipper, no man can ever know
how blue I really am." Mitzi began to
wipe the sides of her nose with a
handkerchief.
"I'm sure I can, lyiitzi."
The girl other way for
several seconds before she spoke.
"Why, Skipper?"
Because because I've been in
the same position myself."
"Oh, I knew that somewhere in this
world there would be a man to under
stand —somebody to give me just a
little sympathy. I've been so lone
some."
"There, there, now, don't cry," said
Skipper, putting his arm around her
and petting her shoulder tenderly.
"It'll be all right. Would it do any
good if I spoke to Herb?"
"Oh, no, no, Skipper. He's got an
awful temper."
"Well, I'm not greatly worried about
men with tempers."
"It's awfully kind of you, dear, but J
want the man I marry to love me," and
she looked up at him.
"I see," he replied, "and you don't
want is to be just because he's en
gaged to you, and somebody "

"Why! One just like yourself,
Mitzi."
"But I'm not like Caroline."
"Yes, but "
"And still you're engaged to her."
"But you "
"Why?"
"Sometimes I ask myself that ques
tion, too."
"And how do you answer it?"
"How do you answer yours?"
"Skipper, I don't know. I don't know
what to say. I'm getting unhappier and
unhappier all the time. Life is such a
disappointment."
"But you shouldn't be. I've heard
that you've always had lots of men
around."
"Yes, but what satisfaction is there
in that?"
"Well, you got the one you wanted,
didn't you?"
"Oh, but Skipper, you don't know
how it feels! I don't believe any of
them. I'm not sure of Herb. I could
almost cry!"
"Please don't; it isn't good for the
complexion."
"Oh, don't talk like that! You sound
just as cruel as the rest."
"I am."
"Mitzi, you're getting just what's
coming to you. Co-eds collect all the
fraternity pins they can, or all the
rings they can. They revel in their
duplicity. They don't care what be
comes of the man, but some day they
wake up and then "
"Skipper, you ARE cruel. I'm in no
condition to listen to that kind of talk
tonight."
"I know how you feel, Mitzi. I'm
sorry. Please forgive me. I hate to
hurt anybody's feelings."
"Oh, Skipper, no man can ever know
how blue I really am." Mitzi began to
wipe the sides of her nose with a
handkerchief.
"I'm sure I can, lyiitzi."
The girl other way for
several seconds before she spoke.
"Why, Skipper?"
Because because I've been in
the same position myself."
"Oh, I knew that somewhere in this
world there would be a man to under
stand —somebody to give me just a
little sympathy. I've been so lone
some."
"There, there, now, don't cry," said
Skipper, putting his arm around her
and petting her shoulder tenderly.
"It'll be all right. Would it do any
good if I spoke to Herb?"
"Oh, no, no, Skipper. He's got an
awful temper."
"Well, I'm not greatly worried about
men with tempers."
"It's awfully kind of you, dear, but J
want the man I marry to love me," and
she looked up at him.
"I see," he replied, "and you don't
want is to be just because he's en
gaged to you, and somebody "
"How understanding you are. How
truly you speak. What difference does
an engagement make, if you don't love

j the man or the girl? What are en
gagements for if they aren't so one
can change their mind. Once they're
made they stick for quite a while just
because of of of custom."
"They're easy enough to make all
' right. You know I'm beginning to be
lieve you're sincere."
"I'm glad."
"Does Herb know you feel like
this?"
"I don't know."
"Why don't you tell him?"
"I don't know."
"What do you know?"
"Oh, I'm so glad to have found you,
Skipper. I feel so much happier when
.I'm with you."
I "Now Mitzi "
"Would you think it horribly wrong
to be in love with anybody who was
engaged?"
"That isn't for me to say under
J the "
The girl carefully laid her head
upon his shoulder. "Skipper, I'll never
tell anybody but you, but Herb is just
terrible to me. He's not only lying to
me, but last time he came to see me
he was was was DRUNK!"
"I never knew Herb did that. I
thought "
"That's just it. Nobody knows what
| I have to put up with."
"I guess you've had a hard time all
right."
"But what's worse, everybody'll say
that I was cut out by that other girl,
whoever she is, and I've never been
thrown down before."
"I can see why you've never been
deserted, all right."
"Can you, Skipper?"
"I think so, Mitzi."
"Stop here, will you, Skipper?" she
said, and pushed the car out of gear
with her free hand. Skipper let the
road coast to one side of the road and
then shut off the switch.
"Why stop here, Mitzi? Better scen
ery further on."
"Why! Why because you were just
telling me you could see why I always
had plenty of attention."
"I know, but "
"Please don't try to find some ob
jection. I'm tired of objections. Can't
you just say something nice to me,
yourself? Just some little thing to
make me feel better? Something to
make life worth living? Please?"
"You're awfully pretty?"
"Oh, Skipper, that's the same old
thing. What good does it do me to be
pretty when the man I love ?" She
nestled snugly on his shoulder and
grasped his arm with two dainty
hands.
"But I've told you," he interrupted,
"that I'd fix things up with Herb if
you wanted me to."
"Skipper, you're the most wonderful
man I ever knew."
(To Be Continued)
"Why! One just like yourself,
Mitzi."
"But I'm not like Caroline."
"Yes, but "
"And still you're engaged to her."
