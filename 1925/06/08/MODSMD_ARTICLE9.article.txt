# FARCE REHEARSALS PROGRESS RAPIDLY WITH GORDON DAVIS
## "Polly With a Past" Premier Produced on Broadway By Belasco in 1917 
### Herbert Klein 
Intensive rehearsing is being done
011 "Polly With a Past," the Senior
farce, under the direction of Gordon
Davis and it is expected that the pro
duction will be in good shape for its
presentation on June 17 as the open
ing event of Senior Week.
"Polly With a Past" was a David
Belasco production and received its
Broadway premier in 1917. The part
of Polly was taken by Ina Claire.
The leads for the Stanford presenta
tion are taken by Aileene Burks as
Polly Shannon and Leonard Schwartz
as Rex Van Zile. Both are well known
on the campus for successful work in
previous dramatic productions.
Sale of tickets begins at 1 o'clock
Wednesday in the Administration
building. Those desiring good seats
are advised to be on hand early. Low
prices will prevail for all sections of
the house. Any seat may be pur
chased for seventy-five cents or a
dollar.
"Polly With a Past" is a true com
edy farce of the best sort, with a plot
that is not too impossible to remain
plausible and is replete with clever
lines and novel situations. Although
the chief interest lies in someone pos
ing as another person it is handled in
an entirely new manner.
The authors, George Middleton and
Guy Bolton, are dramatists experi
enced in writing what the public
wants in the way that it wants. They
also wrote "Adam and Eva," another
comedy success. "Polly With a Past"
was given an introduction in England
when it ran in London not long after
its opening in New York.
Prominent parts are also taken by
Alan Robertson as Harry Richardson
and William Pabst as Clay Collum.
They play the roles of Rex's bachelor
friends who engage a maid, Polly by
name. She turns out to be decidedly
different from the usual type of ser
vants and is able when Rex's trouble
some love affairs make it necessary, to
masquerade as Paulette Bady, the
charming French woman who num
bers kings, dukes, counts, and earls
among her European victims. The idea
is that Rex is to appear in grave
danger of becoming one of her Amer
ican victims and thereby attract the
attention of Myrtle Davis, played by
Arbie Stewart for whom he has an
unrequited affection. She is interested
in saving human wrecks and in ar
ranging Life Savers Benefits.
