It's been a great year
for the Red
Memories of the big game â€”a team that didn't know
defeat, coming through in the last minute; a sub bas
ketball team that nosed out the third game with a
hfeart-breaking finish; Bill Richardson running Boyden
to the ground to give Ted the lead; and good old Ernie
winning his own game with a homer.
And when we get Andy Smith down here next fall. . .
Most of you fellows will be back then. To those who
are leaving, we wish our very best. When back for a
game, poke your head in the door for a few words of
the days gone by.
