Over thirteen hundred Quads were
j distributed to their purchasers in the
j Administration building yesterday,
i Only about five hundred books still
| remain to be given out today.
The few books which had not been
i sold previous to distribution are al
j most all gone. According to W. O.
i Wideman, circulation manager of the
; Quad, less than thirty books remain
i unsold. Those who are unable to call
j for their Quads at the Administration
J building today are notified that their
books will be held for them at the
, Quad office on the balcony of the
I building and may be called for during
j the remainder of the week during the
; following hours: 10-12, 1-2, and 4-5
i o'clock.
Althougn it is the largest Quad ever
I printed the book does not appear
bulky due to its proportioning. The
! cover with its panel of the Palo Alto
I Tree is the work of W. R. Rauschnabel
| of San Francisco who did most of the
I art work, notably the five original oil
! paintings illustrating the theme: uni
versities of the world. Oxford, Paris,
Tokio, and Cairo, were chosen after
much research by a staff appointed for
that purpose as the most truly repre
sentative group of institutions of
learning. The frontispiece is a paint
ing of the early caveman giving in
structions in the art of making a fire
to a young savage. It is entitled "The
First Lesson."
