Several comparative discussions of
western and eastern universities are
included in the current number of the
Zeta Beta Tau quarterly, official organ
of that national fraternity. President
Ray Lyman Wilbur wrote on "The
Place of the Western University," and
Irwin Fullop, graduate of the Univer
sity of California, 011 "The Decline of
Eastern Domination" in sports.
Dr. Wilbur gave the value of the
lack of traditions in western colleges
as an asset, for "they have been able
to grow from the center outward, in
stead of having new departments de
posited 011 an encysted central nucleus
kept so intact by sentimental alumni
ism and faculty myopia that every
change brought 011 a seismic disturb
ance."
Fullop pointed out the rise of the
West in athletic activities, especially
in view of the victories of University
of California and University of South
ern California over Eastern opponents,
and the fight made by Stanford in the
game against Notre Dame. The show
ing of such men as Paddock, Houser,
Hartranft, Richardson, Kerr, Neufelt,
Merchant, and Muller, all students of
Western Universities, in the Olympic
Games was also given as proof of the
decline of Eastern Supremacy.
