# "POLLY WITH PAST" SEAT SALE WILL SET NEW PRICE RECORD
## Charles Parks Called Upon to Substitute for Alan Robertson 
### 
Seats for "Polly With a Past," the
Senior farce, to be given the evening
of Wednesday, May 17, will go on sale
tomorrow afternoon at 1 p. m. in the
Administration building. A low price
record for the quarter will be estab
lished by selling the seats for $1
downstairs and 75 cents upstairs. The
farce is to be the opening event of
Senior Week activities and comes on
the last day of finals.
Gordon Davis, who has been direct
ing the play since his return from the
east, last night made an important
announcement in regard to a change
of cast. Charles Parks will play the
role of Harry Richardson in place of
Alan Robertson who has been taken
sick and is now in the Palo Alto hos
pital. Parks is already perfectly ac
quainted with the lines of the part
as he directed the play for several
weeks before Davis took charge.
Aileene Burks Has Lead
The leads of the play are Aileene
Burks, as Polly after whom the play
is named; and Leonard Schwartz, as
Rex van Zile, a wealthy young bache
lor. William Pabst plays Clay Collum.
who teams up with Harry Richardson
in an endeavor to "fix" Rex's affair
of the heart. Rex is finally fixed but
not with the girl that he started out
to win.
Myrtle Davis, played by Arbie Stew
art, is the girl he started out to win.
Instead, Polly, a simple country girl
(although you'd never think it from
the way she masquerades as a French
heartbreaker), is the one that Rex
finds he loves.
