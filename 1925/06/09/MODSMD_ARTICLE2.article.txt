# STANFORD PROFESSOR WRITES BIBLIOGRAPHY ON ENGLISH LANGUAGE
## 
### 
Professor A. G. Kennedy of the Eng
lish department has just turned over to
the publishers an elaborate work on
the English language that is the fruit
of more than six years of labor. This
volume is entitled "A Bibliography of
"Writings On the English Language
from the Beginning of Printing Until
the End of 1922," and is the first of its
kind ever printed. Never before has
a complete bibliography of the English
language been compiled under one
cover and this work will fill a want
long felt by students and scholars of
English.
In the course of compiling his
data, Professor Kennedy has worked
in the great libraries at Yale and
Harvard, the Congressional Library,
various others in the East, and
a great many in England. He has per
sonally reviewed over 18,000 American
periodicals, and a great number of
English magazines, besides the labor
spent on an immense mass of miscel
laneous information.
Fourteen thousand titles, including
cross references, are listed in chrono
logical order in the volume. Great
care has been taken and whenever
possible all authorities have been cor
roborated. The name of the author
or editor appears at the beginning of
each notation, followed by the title,
place, date, succeeding editions, and
all references to important interviews.
As a reference book for English stu
dents, this volume has been lauded by
critics all over the country.
