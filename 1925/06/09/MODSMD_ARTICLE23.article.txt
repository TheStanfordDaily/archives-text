# And, In the Next Tent
## 
### 
Tomorrow's issue will be positively the last appearance of the Daily
Palo Alto, under the present organization, on this or any other campus.
This stupendous collection of all-star performers will, at this time, desert
their typewriters for their freinds' note-books in order to be able to reas
semble again next year as part of an even greater galaxy of word-wizards,
then to present a revised and elegantly perfect model of journalistic effort.
New faces, new costumes, new lines.
This situation, ladies and gentlemen, we offer as our reason for nego
tiating peace amongst viewpointers. In answer to protests we would point
out that both sides of every disputed question have been presented and it
only remains for individual opinions to be formed, an operation which we
foreswear influencing further.
Instead, fond friends, we direct your attention to the farewell spectacle
which will presently take place in the main tent. Here you will see hun
dreds of trained thinkers perform their final exercises before formally
hurling their challenges at a waiting world. Here you will see a small army
of men and women finally observing the completion of the highest training
for parts in the Greatest Show 011 Earth.
We have observed the particular quite along enough. Let us draw back
and regard the gorgeous whole.
