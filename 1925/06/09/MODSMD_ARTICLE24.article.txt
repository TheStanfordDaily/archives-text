# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT
## 
### 
Editor, Daily Palo Alto:
I have read your article on prohibi
tion in Tuesday's paper and lament its
publication, and the spirit that prompt
ed you to write it. Cannot prohibit?
Then legislation does not legislate and
restriction does not restrict.
You are a disloyal citizen of the
United States. Instead of taking the
word of men who like liquor and re
gent being deprived of it, go to the
wives and mothers who have more
money to spend for their children and
their home. Go to the courts who used
to say nine cases out of ten, where
they tried men for murder, arson,
many other crimes, were caused by
liquor. Now they are dealing with
bootleggers trying to outwit the law
for the money there is in it.
Will you accept this fact in simple
justice? Where formerly people
hushed up disgraceful drunks, wife
beatings, etc., now every little in
stance is published from the house
tops to show how "crime has in
creased." It is not increased; it is
simply shouted from the housetops.
In Seattle, where I lived after the law
was passed the "owl car," run at three
in the morning to pick up drunken
men and women, was discontinued in
a few weeks. The saloon corners,
where workmen bought beer for lunch
and where women were afraid to
loiter, were supplanted by milk sta
tions, and quiet reigned. The business
men who feared prohibition would
hurt trade, were interviewed in three
months by the editor of the Seattle
Times, and almost to a man reported
increased sales, especially in women's
and children's clothes, and in gro
ceries. None of them wanted the sa
loon returned.
Will you publish these facts for
truth's sake? Will you publish this
letter for the sake of the hundreds of
young men and women in your great
university who may be misled? At all
events, give them your own careful
consideration, and do not let the howls
of liquor men carry you away.
They shout "personal liberty" when
not one should have liberty to hurt
anyone else. What they mean is
Anarchy.
Very truly,
Mrs. Jessie W. Morton.

The Editor, Sir:
Although you are well able to defend
your editorial utterances alone, permit
me a few words anent the resolution
of the W. C. T. U. printed in your
columns Friday.
The stern rebuke administered you
by the august sisterhood was surely a
priceless bit of evidence of the mental
aberration and lack of moral perspec
tive of those who seek to abridge the
liberties of the American people and
to substitute Blue Laws for the Bill of
Rights.
The argument of the W. C. T. U.
seems to be: (1) Laws against mur
der arc broken; (2) The Dry Law is
broken; (3) Laws against murder are

necessary; THEREFORE (4) The Dry
Law is necessary. This is not even a
false syllogism—lt i 8 no syllogism at
all.
Any imbecile knows that laws
against violence are indispensible to
the security of the nation. But the
Prohibition law seeks to remedy prob
lems of a purely personal nature. The
state has no more legitimate interest
in what I drink than in what I eat or
how long I sleep. While every sane
person realizes it is wrong to murder,
most people break the Volstead Act
quite casually, and frequently boast of
the infraction.
The point is that where a law is
persistently and conspicuously vio
lated, not only by the criminal class
and mental defectives, but also by the
majority of reputable citizens, anyone
but a blue fanatic would conclude that
such a law was unreasonable and
wholly undeserving of being retained.
And speaking of murder, just where
does the responsibility ultimately lie
for the killing of innocent people by
inferior liquor?
Yours Sincerely,

In Seattle, where I lived after the law
was passed the "owl car," run at three
in the morning to pick up drunken
men and women, was discontinued in
a few weeks. The saloon corners,
where workmen bought beer for lunch
and where women were afraid to
loiter, were supplanted by milk sta
tions, and quiet reigned. The business
men who feared prohibition would
hurt trade, were interviewed in three
months by the editor of the Seattle
Times, and almost to a man reported
increased sales, especially in women's
and children's clothes, and in gro
ceries. None of them wanted the sa

Will you publish these facts for
truth's sake? Will you publish this
letter for the sake of the hundreds of
young men and women in your great
university who may be misled? At all
events, give them your own careful
consideration, and do not let the howls
of liquor men carry you away.
They shout "personal liberty" when
not one should have liberty to hurt
anyone else. What they mean is
Anarchy.

The Editor, Sir:
Although you are well able to defend
your editorial utterances alone, permit
me a few words anent the resolution
of the W. C. T. U. printed in your
columns Friday.
The stern rebuke administered you
by the august sisterhood was surely a
priceless bit of evidence of the mental
aberration and lack of moral perspec
tive of those who seek to abridge the
liberties of the American people and
to substitute Blue Laws for the Bill of
Rights.
The argument of the W. C. T. U.
seems to be: (1) Laws against mur
der arc broken; (2) The Dry Law is
broken; (3) Laws against murder are

necessary; THEREFORE (4) The Dry
Law is necessary. This is not even a
false syllogism—lt i 8 no syllogism at
all.
Any imbecile knows that laws
against violence are indispensible to
the security of the nation. But the
Prohibition law seeks to remedy prob
lems of a purely personal nature. The
state has no more legitimate interest
in what I drink than in what I eat or
how long I sleep. While every sane
person realizes it is wrong to murder,
most people break the Volstead Act
quite casually, and frequently boast of
the infraction.
The point is that where a law is
persistently and conspicuously vio
lated, not only by the criminal class
and mental defectives, but also by the
majority of reputable citizens, anyone
but a blue fanatic would conclude that
such a law was unreasonable and
wholly undeserving of being retained.
And speaking of murder, just where
does the responsibility ultimately lie
for the killing of innocent people by
inferior liquor?
Yours Sincerely,
J. D.
Editor, Daily Palo Alto:
I have read your article on prohibi
tion in Tuesday's paper and lament its
publication, and the spirit that prompt
ed you to write it. Cannot prohibit?
Then legislation does not legislate and
restriction does not restrict.
You are a disloyal citizen of the
United States. Instead of taking the
word of men who like liquor and re
gent being deprived of it, go to the
wives and mothers who have more
money to spend for their children and
their home. Go to the courts who used
to say nine cases out of ten, where
they tried men for murder, arson,
many other crimes, were caused by
liquor. Now they are dealing with
bootleggers trying to outwit the law
for the money there is in it.
Will you accept this fact in simple
justice? Where formerly people
hushed up disgraceful drunks, wife
beatings, etc., now every little in
stance is published from the house
tops to show how "crime has in
creased." It is not increased; it is
simply shouted from the housetops.
