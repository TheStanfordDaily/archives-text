## "BILL THE CONQUEROR" 
### P. G. Wodehouse 
Bill is lovely, because Bill is human.
Not one thing does Bill do for him
self, and yet he is successful. He does
not lack energy, and hee's willing
enough, but he simply hasn't the abil
ity to make sweeping successes of all
his enterprises. He falls in love in
spite of himself. Flickie, the charm
ing and quite natural heroine, com
bines with his pal Juddy, and with the
large Miss Stryker to give Bill won
derful achievement in his uncle'|
cherished books from the clutches of
a gang of crooks. He achieves every
thing that a melodrama hero achieves,
but not, as does the other, by his own
powers. Circumstance governs his ac
complishment.
Uncle Sinclair Hammond is a char
acter to be known and gloated over.
His unruffled calm, his undemonstra
tive insight, endear him to the reader.
We like him, and we like his calm
acceptance of life as it comes.
P. G. Wodehouse has produced an
other mirth-provoking book. Almost
every chapter ends with a delicately
humorous line, to say nothing of the
"cracks" scattered throughout the
other pages of the book. Somewhat
milder than some of Wodehouse's
other work, it is yet an interesting and
worth-while book. It might be good
to read during "exes." We think, at
least, that it would relieve the tension
considerably. —A. H. A.
