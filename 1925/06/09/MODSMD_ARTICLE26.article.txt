# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
From yesterday's editorial there ap
pears to be a little misunderstanding
on the campus regarding the attitude
of the Chinese Club toward the so
called anti-foreign movement in China.
We wish to point out that the move
ment is merely a protest against the
authorities of the Shanghai Interna
tional Concessions, who were respon
sible for the firing upon students in a
demonstration against inhuman treat
ment of workers in certain cotton
mills. It is far from a general anti
foreign movement, as sometimes re
ported. While opinions and actions of
irresponsible individuals may have oc
casioned unfortunate incidents, it is
needless to say that such have not the
least of our sympathies.
A careful perusal of newspapers
among big-lettered "Bolshevism," So
viet influence," and "Anti-foreign
riots" will reveal the fact that the
movement is not at all without dis
crimination. Citizens of countries
known for their fair play in relations
with China can be assured of the
good-will of the Chinese people. Fur
ther, our Club wishes to assure the
campus of its good feeling and grati
tude toward the University public and
regrets very much that a cablegram
expressing sympathy for those suffer
ers at home should have caused this
misunderstanding among our Ameri
can friends.
Permit us to thank you for inserting
this letter in the Daily.
Very sincerely yours,"*
C. C. Wu, Chairman.
