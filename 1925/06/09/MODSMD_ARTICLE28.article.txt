"Dodson'B Hint« on Musical Hits"

"Collegiate" is the name of a new
dance record played by Waring's Penn
sylvanians which you'll want to own.
Three unusually clever vocal choruses,
catchy melody, and splendid rhythm
promise to make this particular Victor
record the best seller of the summer
season.

And here's hoping that you hit finals
for a straight A or thereabouts —and
be sure to have a darn fine vacation
after it's all over.
