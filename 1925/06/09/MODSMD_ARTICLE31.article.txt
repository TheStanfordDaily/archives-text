"No, I'm not. I may give that ap
pearance, but I'm just as much a beast
as Herb. 1 don't stick by Caroline any
better than he does by you."
"Skipper a-— man like
you was never meant for
a girl like Caroline. You're
wonderful!"
"No, I'm not, Mitzi. I'm just as bad
as Herb. Worse, perhaps."
"No you're not."
"But I tell you I am. Why I "
"Then how could you speak to Herb
for me?" she interrupted.
"That's different. You, a wonderful
girl, being treated like that."
"But Skipper, you treat me so much
nicer."
"And still, I'm no better than Herb."
"But if a woman loves, why, she'll
stand anything."
"And in the second place, you're en
gaged."
"Kiss me just once, Skipper. Just
once to make me feel better."
"Do you think that would make you
any happier?"
"Yes, Skipper."
"Why?"
"Because because . Oh! Skip
per! You should say it!"
"But I can't!"
She held a dainty hand full in the
feeble incandescent glow of the dash
light. A platinum ring, faced with a
large black stones in which, by the
side of a small diamond, was an en
graved crest hung loosely between her
thumb and forefinger. The ring glis
tened thus for a brief instant and then
slipped from her hand. "What a
chance?" she murmured.
"What did you say, Mitzi?" he asked
as though someone were close enough
to listen.
"I said, now. Now, Skipper, now you
can tell me."
"But Herb "
"Is forgotten," she inserted. "Now, ]
Skipper, won't you say won't you
tell me ?"
"Are you sure you really love me,
Mitzi?"
"Don't you love me, Skipper?"
"I'm . Yes I guess j
but "
"Herb's in China, for all that mat-j
ters."
"In China!"
"Yes, some place far, far away."
"In China!"
"Yes, out of my life forever."
"In China! So is Val."
"So is who?"
"Mitzi, you never would understand.
I just can't believe another girl. Not
another one. I'll be damned if I can."
"Skipper, you don't know how that i
hurts me."
"I guess it does, but "
"Why are you starting the car, Skip
per?"
"Because she said, 'In China!'"
"Who said?"
"Val!"
"Don't open the muffler, Skipper!
It makes too much noise!"
"I want noise! Soft words make
fools outa men. I gotta have noise."
"You aren't angry, are you, Skip
per?"
"No, Mitzi, sorry!" he shouted.
The roadster's metallic throat con
tinued an unbroken line of harsh vibra- j
tions for the next twenty minutes. As !
they approached the Blair place, Skip- j

per closed the muffler and finally
parked the car near where he had
f found it.
"I think you're " she began as
he opened the door of the car for her.
"Don't make bad matters worse,
i Mitzi."
"But you don't "
"I didn't say I didn't love you," he
interrupted again.
"No, but you drove back and made
more noise than a fire engine!"
"But Mitzi if you'd only "
"So here's my wagon," broke in Joe's
voice. "Hey! Everybody! Stop looking!
I've found it!" In answer to his call,
■ several couples gathered about.
"I didn't think you'd mind," Skipper
began. "I we we we ."
He paused in confusion as he noticed
I Mritzi was missing.
Buz, who was about to consume a
glass of suspiciously red punch, stop-
I ped the goblet half way to his lips,
when Skipper presented himself.
"Karoo!" exclaimed the drinker.
"What now?"
"Gotta se you alone. Pronto!"
"And so you see," Skipper explained
as they paused in a secluded spot, "I
I didn't fall. I didn't! Not this time!"
"What did you do?"
"Hardly anything."
"Karoo! You didn't do enough."
"What?"
"Herb's going to lose her anyhow."
"Whadda ya mean? How do you
! know?"
"Been the general topic of conversa
j tion," answered Buz with the majestic
air of a Magus.
"Well , I'm I'm sorry for
him."
"Yes, and Mit?i, too."
"Why Mitzi? She can get all "
"Because she loves you."
"I said she loves you. Anybody can
see that."
"Oh God! And here I treated her
j like "
"Well, you've still got Caroline."
I "Shut up! What would you do, Buz?
What ?"
"You're in love with her?"
"Kinda weak from the start."
"Really!" Skipper answered with a
nod of his read as if he were saying
the very "I do."
"Well, go tell her then. Get it out
o' your system."
Five minutes later Skipper faced
Buz again. "Turned you down! I'm
sorry ," began Buz in a quiet voice.
"She did not," objected Skipper. "It's
worse than that."
"Well?"
"She's mad! Says she's sick and
won't see me."
in love all right. Better wait
until morning."
"But I want to see her now!"

"Say, what about Caroline?"
"She isn't , Ah, hell!"
Skipper Mowen traversed the length
of the dining room many times be
tween 7:30 and 8:30 the next morning.
He halted in the middle of one of
these restless journeys as Mrs. Blair
entered. "Good morning, Skipper!" she
greeted him. "Are you waiting for
breakfast?"
"Good morning, Mrs. Blair. Seen
Mitzi this morning?"
"Oh, yes! I certainly have. She left
on the five o'clock "*
"On the five o'clock."
"Yes, and there's a note for you on
the hall table."
"Begin at the beginning," insisted
Buz after listening to several of Skip
per's explosive epithets. "What does
the note say?"
"It says: 'Mr. Mowen. I hope you do
not think from the distasteful episode
which took place last night I am in
love with you. In fact I never knew
any person I detested more in my life.
I presume that you are not sportsman
enough to remain silent on this affair,
but I assure you that I am. But above
all things, remember that you didn't
fool me and I am not, never was, and
hope I never will be. I am not leaving
because I fear you or anything like
that, but because I have an urgent mis
sion to perform in San Francisco,'
and then she signs it 'M. M.' and puts
a 'P. S.' on, 'Don't you dare follow me.
If you do* I'll tell Herb'."
"Good Lord! Skipper, she certainly
had it bad."
"Hell!"
"If she had the upper hand she'd
tell the whole place about it. Probably
call you a love pirate and all-that."
"What am I gonna do?"
"Sit tight and say nothing."
"But Buz !"
"Anything you do now is going to
cause trouble."
"I guess you're right, but "
"Why did you do it, Skipper?"
"You know! I thought it was just
another one like Val. I didn't want to
play the fool."
