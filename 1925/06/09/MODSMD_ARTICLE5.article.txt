# DRAMATICS CLASS TO GIVE LAST PROGRAM THURSDAY EVENING
## 
### 
! Miss Buckingham's class in dramatic
| interpretation will put on its fourth
i and last program of one-act plays for
the quarter at 8:15 o'clock Thursday
evening In the Little Theater. But one
play, "Poor Madelena" by Louise
j Saunders will be given. It is some
j what longer and more ambitious than
| anything so far produced by the group,
i and is being directed and supervised
I by Grace Reade and Tom Drake.
The cast consists of Evelyn Van
j Horn, Fenton Barrett, and Baylor
I Brooks. Barrett will be remembered
|as Collins, the lead of the Junior
! Opera. He has also taken parts in
previous plays given by the class,
notably as the husband In "Thursday
Evening" by Christopher Morley, which
was later given as a part of the Scout
Jinx, and also in "Mary's Wedding"
an Irish tragedy. Brooks took the
role of the polished actor in "The
Flattering Word" given by the class
last Thursday.
"Poor Madelena" is a one-act play
but has three scenes. It is an alle
gorical and fantastical work. The pub
lic is invited to attend.
