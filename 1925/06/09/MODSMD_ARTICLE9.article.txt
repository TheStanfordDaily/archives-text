# WARREN D. ALLEN TO GIVE ORGAN RECITAL
## 
### 
Warren D. Allen, university organ
ist, will give a recital Thursday after
noon at 4:15 o'clock. His program
will be headed by "Piece Heroique"
by Cesar Franck, the French musician,
whose work has laid the foundation
for much of modern music.
"Piect Heroique" is a very effective
number written in the "grand style."
Mendelssohn's "Spring Song," with the
simple and pleasing tune, has become
one of the most popular of melodies.
It will be especially appropriate to
the spring season. "The Shepherd
Boy" by Edward Grieg is a rustic
music-picture by the Norwegian com
poser, greatest of the Scandinavian
Other numbers are the "Andante
school of music.
Cantabile" from Widor's Fourth Sym
phony, and a "Nuptial March" by
Guilmant.
Alterations are now completed on
the organ and all sets of pipes that
are to be put in for some time have
been installed. The new console, built
by the Skinner Organ Company of
San Francisco, has four keyboard
manuals and stops for controlling
fifty-four sets of pipes. A few of these
stops will remain unused until funds
for installing the required pipes be
come available. The complete console
cost seven thousand dollars, and is
one of the most modern and complete
ly equipped, in California. Air pres
sure is now supplied by a rotary
blower in a sound proof case. It has
a capacity sufficient to take care of
practically any volume which may be
required. The swell shutters, regulat
ing the loudness of the sound, were
remodeled and the pipe chambers in
the organ loft were enlarged to a size
large enough to hold sets of pipes
which are planned to be installed in
the future.
The complete program for Thursday
is as follows:
Piece Heroique Cesar Franck
Andante Cantabile from the Fourth
Symphony Widor
Spring Song Mendelssohn
Shepherd Boy Grieg
Nuptial March Guilmant
