The Magnitude of
the Bond Business
OVER $6,300,000,000 is the estimate, by a
leading authority, of the amount of financ
ing done in this country during 1924 for the
account of corporations, domestic municipali
ties and states, farm loan banks, foreign govern
ments and other borrowers.
This figure compares as follows with totals
of the four preceding years:
1924 over $6,300,000,000
1923 over 4,900,000,000
1922 over 5,200,000,000
192 1 over 4,200,000,000
1920 over 4,000,000,000
Over 80Â°/o of this financing took the form
of bond and note issues. Most of these issues
were offered to the public through investment
houses and banks.
These figures indicate the extent and impor
tance of the investment banking business. They
show why it offers broad opportunities to college
trained men.
Our booklet, "The Bond Business as an
Occupation for College Men," deals with the
subject in an interesting and informative way.
A copy of it will be sent upon request.
