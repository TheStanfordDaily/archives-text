# CARD TRACKMEN READY FOR N. C. A. A. MEET AT STAGG FIELD SATURDAY
## STANFORD CHANCES GOOD Michigan Athletes to Give Coast Teams Hardest Race for Honors 
### Douglas Meservey 
While the satisfied East rests upon
| its second-place laurels, Stanford and
i fifty of the larger track teams of the
j West will compete Saturday for the
j National Collegiate Athletic Associa
| tion championship at Stagg Field, Chi
| cago. A number of smaller eastern
j teams are also entered in the hope
j of picking-up a few points.
Michigan, winner or the Big Ten
j conference meet last week, looks to
j be the winner, but the Cards will be
lin the running at all times and will
1 finish near the top. They should score
j about 33 points.
Coach R. L. Templeton is at present
in Chicago with his six Cardinal ath
letes who will train this week at Stagg
Field in preparation for the meet.
The Card tracksters are: Captain
Hartranft, Miller. Richardson, Work,
Hoffman, and Leistner.
Large Eastern Teams Absent
The meet promises to be repre
sentative of the country except for
the East, whose greatest teams were
entered in the I. C. A. A. A. A. As
eight out of fifteen events at the Big
Ten meet eclipsed the same in the
I. C. A. A. A. A., it will be seen that
the N. C. A. A. meet promises to be
not only the most representative con
test of the year but also the greatest.
The Pacific Coast will be interested
in the showings of six athletes from
the University of Washington; six
from Stanford, about ten from the
University of California, one from
Occidental College, four from Pomona
College, and possibly a few from
U. S. C.
Leistner in Fact Company
A glance at the store
for the six Stanford tracksters shows
that, of that number, Leistner will be
in the fastest company.
Against him will be pitted four and
possibly six of the greatest hurdlers
In the country—omitting only Scat
tergood of Princeton, Moore of Penn
State, and Haas of Georgetown. The
six are: Kinsey of Illinois, Guthrie
and Snyder of Ohio State, Werner of
Illinois, Weir of Nebraska, and Max
well of Pomona. The entry of Weir
and Dye of U. S. C.is doubtful.
Out of this Leistner should take a
second place in the high hurdles and
a third ill the lows —a total of seven
points. With the exception of Guthrie
of Ohio State, Leistner is the greatest
competitive hurdler of the entries and
may surprise with even better times.
Reinke Richardson's Rival
Richardson of Stanford will find his
greatest trouble with Reinke of Mich
igan, winner of the Big Ten meet in
1:54 84-100. The latter, however, ac
cording to reports from the Middle
West, having won the conference 880,
may experience a let-down and have
trouble in making as fast time Satur
day. Although beaten by both Boyden
of California and Charteris of Wash
ington, Richardson is a better half
miler than either, and having learned
several lessons from both defeats, has
better than an even chance of beating
both men.
Card Weight Men Best
Hartranft and Hoffman are the lead
ing weight-men entered in the N. C.
A. A. Their greatest competition will
come from Schwarze of Wisconsin and
Gerkin of California in the shot, but
at the rate that Hoffman has been
improving and Hartranft has been
performing, a conservative estimate
would give the two of them a total
of sixteen points. Both men have
made better discus records this season
than any entries in the N. C. A. A.
Work of Stanford will have to ful
fill all of Templeton's expectations
concerning him to win the high-jump.
Russell of Chicago and Poor of Kansas
have both done 6 feet 6 inches and
McGinnis of Wisconsin has cleared
<i feet 4 inchees. Work's best leap
has been 6 feet 5 7-20 inches.
Fast 440 Expected
Miller of Stanford will meet Phillips
of Butler, Johnson of California, and
Martin of Northwestern as his tough
est opponents in the 440. All have
done under :50, with Miller's best
time :48 3-5, early in the season. Since
then he has not had to step out and
It is entirely nossible that with a great
field rur j/A'ith he will do under
:49 this Saturday. On a good track,
the winning time should be that fast,
judging from past Middle Western
records.

Freshmen at Princeton are taller,
heavier, and physically more efficient
than any of the other classes in the
university.
