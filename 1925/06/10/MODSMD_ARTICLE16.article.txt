# CARD TRACKMEN READY FOR N. C. A. A. MEET AT STAGG FIELD SATURDAY
## STANFORD CHANCES GOOD Michigan Athletes to Give Coast Teams Hardest Race for Honors 
### Douglas Meservey 
While the satisfied East rests upon
| its second-place laurels, Stanford and
i fifty of the larger track teams of the
j West will compete Saturday for the
j National Collegiate Athletic Associa
| tion championship at Stagg Field, Chi
| cago. A number of smaller eastern
j teams are also entered in the hope
j of picking-up a few points.
Michigan, winner or the Big Ten
j conference meet last week, looks to
j be the winner, but the Cards will be
lin the running at all times and will
1 finish near the top. They should score
j about 33 points.
Coach R. L. Templeton is at present
in Chicago with his six Cardinal ath
letes who will train this week at Stagg
Field in preparation for the meet.
The Card tracksters are: Captain
Hartranft, Miller. Richardson, Work,
Hoffman, and Leistner.
Large Eastern Teams Absent
The meet promises to be repre
sentative of the country except for
the East, whose greatest teams were
entered in the I. C. A. A. A. A. As
eight out of fifteen events at the Big
Ten meet eclipsed the same in the
I. C. A. A. A. A., it will be seen that
the N. C. A. A. meet promises to be
not only the most representative con
test of the year but also the greatest.
The Pacific Coast will be interested
in the showings of six athletes from
the University of Washington; six
from Stanford, about ten from the
University of California, one from
Occidental College, four from Pomona
College, and possibly a few from
U. S. C.
