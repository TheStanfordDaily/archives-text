# UNIVERSITY GROUNDS MADE GAME PRESERVE BY STATE LEGISLATURE
## 
### 
Stanford university has been made
a state game preserve by an act of the
last state legislature. This action has
come after nearly five years of con
stant effort on the part of the Zoology
club, with the help of Comptroller
Roth, co-operating with the Fish and
Game Commission, to bring it about.
A bill sponsored by the Fish and
Game Commission in 1923 had an
amendment in it making Stanford a
game refuge, but the bill was vetoed
by Governor Richardson.
All the surrounding university prop
erty has been included in the refuge,
and takes in Searsville, and Felt lakes.
Under the provisions of this bill it
will be unlawful to "hunt, pursue,
take, kill or destroy or have in one's
possession any species of bird or
mammal, except under written permit
from the board of fish and game com
missioners." It will also be unlawful
to carry any firearms.
Making Stanford a game refuge will
make it possible for the wild life on
the grounds to develop and flourish,
and give the Zoology Department a
chance to make first hand observa
tions which it has hitherto been un
able to do. The lakes afford a suit
able refuge for water fowl, and the
brush and timber at the rear of the
tract afford refuge for many species
of wild birds and small animals, in
cluding deer. This refuge will be
unique inasmuch as it will probably
be the only state game preserve in
the country with a fully equipped
Zoology department within its con
fines.
