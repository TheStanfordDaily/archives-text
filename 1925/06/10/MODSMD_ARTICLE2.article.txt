# W. D. ALLEN PLAYS IN RECITAL ON ORGAN OF MEMORIAL CHURCH
## 
### 
An organ recital will be given to
morrow afternoon at 4 o'clock in the
Memorial Church, with Warren D.
Allen at the keyboard ol the newly
installed consfble. His program will
feature especially the compositions of
French musicians, as selections from
Widor, Cesar Franck, and Guilmant
are to be played.
Most imposing of the numbers to
be given in conception and tonal struc
ture is Piece Heroique by Cesar
Franck, France's greatest organist.
Franck is quite generally regarded as
the father of the French music of the
present day. In his biography, written
by Vincent d'lndy, himself a noted
â– musician, the life and artistic pur
poses of Franck are discussed.
Nobility and sincerity which Franck
believed should fill music are found
in his own works, which have artistic
craftsmanship as well as inspiration.
Although he has written for the piano
orchestral compositions, most of his
best work is for the organ, at which
he felt esepecially at home.
Grieg Represented
The work of Edward Grieg, the most
famous of Scandinavian composers,
will be represented with his rustic
"Shepherd Boy." In a different and
more delicate style is Mendelssohn's
well known "Spring Song," the popu
larity of which never seems to dimin
ish.
A movement from Widor's Fourth
Symphony, the Andante Cantabile, to
gether with Guilmant's Nuptial March,
will complete the recital.
The program in the order in which
it will be played is as follows:
Piece Heroique Cesar Franck
Andante Cantabile from the Fourth
Symphony Widor
Spring Song Mendelssohn
Shepherd 80y...... Grieg
Nuptial Marcli Guilmant
