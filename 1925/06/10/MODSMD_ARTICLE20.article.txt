# That's All There Is

With final examinations causing plenty of commotion by themselves,
it is with personal sorrow rather than public-spirited regret that we an
nounce the last issue of Volume 67. The temporary panic explodes in the
face of general catastrophe.
All of which calls for what has been cleverly nick-named a "swan
song," this time to herald a vigorous and capable cygnet, as much as any
thing else. Nor is it an empty heritage which will be left to Wallace Knox
as editor of Volume 68. Besides an efficient and congenial staff, we be
queath that other assistance to incoming editors, the list of editorial
sources which has made possible this gripping column.
With thanks for past favors and urging continued cooperation with
the Daily, we commend to his attention the Precinct System and Politics
in General; Prohibition; the Union Store; the Library; the Academic
Method; Rushing and Who Rushes; the Awards Reform; Women's De
bates ; Athletics; the Glee Club; the Men's Council; the Cornell Daily Sun ;
the Auto on the Campus; Rooting, at Games and at Theaters; the Younger
Generation; and the many, many other deathless topics of contention.
While some of our lustier viewpointers may deny it, we prefer to remain
pleased with the exciting polemics these things have inspired. Lots of fun
â€”no additional expense. And full many an idea has found itself, we
hope, where no such flower bloomed before.
We find ourselves indebted to Miss Edith Mirrielees for the permis
sion to publish the short stories written for her class by T. E. Connolly
and Philip Biddison, to all of whom we are deeply grateful. The experi
ence and wisdom of Professor E. W. Smith has been responsible for many
suggestions which have improved the paper and which have assisted us in
avoiding many mistakes. Professor B. O. Brown and the members of his
editorial writing class also have assisted materially. Robert Triest de
serves great credit for the reviews which have appeared over his initials
this term. The work of Miss Beatrice Flesher as Women's Editor, and
of David Meiklejohn and Wallace Knox as Managing Editors, cannot be
praised too highly. The kindness of these people and others who have
aided so much this year, together with the capabilities of the corps of re
porters and news editors, is no inconsiderable testament.
And having sung the song, this swan prepares to take his last dose of
Finals and to finally pass on from this collegiate existence. No flowers,
please.
