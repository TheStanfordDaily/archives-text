# THE 						AISLE SEAT

I'LL SHOW YOU THE TOWN-
Aftcr months spent in expectation of
having more room in which to find our
aisle scat, we were greatly disappointed
to be caught in a wholly unnecessary
crush. Needless to say, our enthusiasm
suffered a great loss.
Now the new theater is probaby all
right and all that, but in the old one
things weren't quite so goofed up. The
reels were run off without any painful
intermissions, and the curtain functioned
in time with the music. But perhaps the
new theater will learn in time—when we
drop in to give it the once-over some other
time.
The program was rcaly quite enjoy
able. Allen White's Collegians brought
down the house, and wc are most sure that
they are the best that has ever struck the
sticks of Palo Alto —pretty trick. At any
rate, it put us in good humor for the final
event on the program. We hope that
things like that will appear rather often.
They serve to spice up the evening quite
appreciably, and wc yelled for more with
the rest of them.
We are not quite sure whether it should
be named the big drag of the evening or
not, hut the feature picture was enjoyable
(perhaps because of the orchestra). And
oh yes, Mr. Denny himself appeared on
the stage, a great pleasure to those who
enjoy that sort of thing.
"I'll Show You the Town" is an enter
taining comedy—light, but rather fast
and furious. Incidentally, we must give
a big cheer for Marion Nixon, who is a
most capitivating heroine. And Denny
himself served to furnish a goodly number
of laughs. On the whole, a good picture,

though without any particular brilliance,
but amusing. All that puts it distinctly
among the best movies we have seen
lately. It was a great relief to be thor
oughly amused with no particular effort
and drag on a cigarettc. —D. T. R.
