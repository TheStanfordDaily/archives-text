Robert M. C. Littler, a graduate of
this year, will assume the forensic
, coaching duties of Professor James
Gordon Emerson, present faculty de
luding advisor, who will be 011 leave
the autumn and winter quarters of
next year.
Littler, debating manager this year,
1 who lias been one of the mainstays
!of Slanford debating teams for the
j past.two years, transferred from Wil
! lamette University In 1923. Previous
lo transferring to Stanford, he had
! debated for the northern institution,
and as a sophomore led the team
1 which won five of six debates on a
( trip through the Mississippi valley, de
-1 bating on the League of Nations.
Coming to Stanford as a junior,
in the fall of 1923, Littler placed sec
ond in the Pacific Coast Extemporane
j ous Speaking Contest. In January,
j 1924, he led the Stanford team which
i debated the University of Southern
I California at Los Angeles on the
j Criminal Syndicalism Law.
Wins Joffre Medal
In 1924 he won the Medaille Joffre
j
in the annual contest with California,
j Littler has this year taken part in the
Oxford-Stanford contest, and also in
: flie debate between representatives of
I Stanford, California, and Oxford in
San Francisco on the prohibition ques
tion.
Littler is a member of Los Arcos,
Delta Sigma Rlio debating fraternity,
and Phi Beta Kappa.
i Among the forensic aT-
I ranged for next year are a dual debate
to take place in November with the
University of California on some
phase of the Evolution question, and
a dual debate with U. S. C. in the win
ter quarter. A representative will also
be sent to the Pacific Coast Extem
poraneous Contest at Washington
State College. The season will close
with the annual Joffre debate with
California.
Eastern Trip Planned
Included in the tentative plans is a
trip by two graduates which will tour
the East, participating in about ten
debates, among them contests with
Yale, Princeton, and Harvard. It is
also probable that Stanford will co
operate with other coast institutions
in bringing west a team from either
Yale, Harvard, Princeton, or Cam
bridge.
In addition, the plan this year used
in scheduling several debates for men
of less experience will be continued.
Among the contests contemplated
for the women's debating teams are
debates with California and Mills, and
probably a trip to Southern California.
Freshmen Debates Probable
Tentative plans for freshmen debat
ing call for contests with California
frosh and two other freshmen teams.
Although Littler, R. F. Lewis, J. C.
Duniway, H. M. Lindsay, V. H. Hard
ing, and W. L. Gosslin will be lost to
the debating activity next year, sev
eral members of this year's team will
■ return. Chief of these is Stanley Wei
_

gel, while G. N. Crocker, C. C. Scott,
R. R. Brice, T. F. Baer, and D. F.
Parker will also be eligible for debat
ing. Among the members of this
year's freshmen team are Floyd Hol
dren, Jack Shoup, Garth Winslow, and
Philip Cavalero. With these men as
a nucleus several strong teams will in
all probability represent Stanford in
debating.
Oxford and Princeton will hold a
debate next October.
