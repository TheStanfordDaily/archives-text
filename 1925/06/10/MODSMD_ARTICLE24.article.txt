## "THE BANNER OF THE BULL" 
### Rafael Sabatini 
Sabatini has combined his own fer
tile imagination with the great possi
bilities of Cesare Borgia's traditional
character to produce a rather inter
esting series of tales showing the cun
ning of Renaissance princes. Truly,
he has made excellent use of the tra
dition of the Borgia. The magnificent,
all-powerful Cesare plots warily, and
no one knows his ends, even when
they are attained; that is, no one
except the historian, our own omni
scient Sabatini. When Cesare creates
a love affair, which seems distinctly
opposed to his own aims, do you sup
pose he fools our author? He cer
tainly does not, and when the whole
thing turns out to have been a master
stroke, bringing him the loyalty of a
bitter enemy, our Sabatini points with
pride to the fact that he knew it all
the time.
The book is brilliantly imagined,
and the fine irony of Cesare is well
portrayed. We congratulate Signor
Sabatini on his successful combination
of historical probability with the
workings of his own inventive brain.
