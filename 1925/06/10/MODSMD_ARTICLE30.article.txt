# HOOVER LIBRARY OF WAR DOCUMENTS IS TOPIC OF PAMPHLET
## 
### 
The ninth issue of "Concerning Stan
ford," a pamphlet issued by the Univer
j sity, is now available at the President's
office. A brief outline of the material to
be found in the Hoover War Library and
I a short history of its formation forms the
| subject of the pamphlet.
The Hoover War Library, founded in
1919 by Herbert Hoover, '95, is nationally
famous for its research material and the
nature of the works, manuscripts, and
documents included in its archives. In
its first five years it acquired 125,000 vol
umes, half of which are either out of
print, imprinted, or irreplacable.
Under the direction of Professor E. D.
Adams, a board of directors handles all
the work of the library and administers
the permanent endowment given it in 1924
by Hoover.
The material has been divided into var
ious sections in order that it may be bet
ter handled by graduate students and
others. One part of the program of the
library cals for the obtaining of all im
tion in the world during the war period
portant official documents of every 11a
and the subsequent reconstruction period.
Three-fourths of this material is already
here at the university.
The policy of the library in obtaining
material differs from other libraries in
that the others are more antiquarian or
national in their interests, but the Hoover
library seeks works of any sort that have
historical interest, regardless of the lang
uage, time, or where printed.
In collecting newspapers the library has
used the policy of securing for each
country a file of the pro and con papers,
one paper that favored the government
policy and two that were not in favor of it.
Another activity of the library is the
securing of society publications, organs
of any groups that either favored or op
posed the governmental policies. No

j American society, however small, should
I lose its records made during the war,
I stated Professor Adams.
Documents concerning the Washington
Conference, the League of Nations, the
Paris Peace Conference, and a number of
other international bodies are especially
desired by the library. The collection of
"Delegation Propaganda," as this matter
is termed, now numbers about two thou
sand titles.
The manuscript collection of the library
numbers now about sixty-five thousand re
ports and communications bearing on
the war. Personal memorablilia of per
sons prominent in public life are being
acquired. Diaries and samples of corre
spondence which have bearing on the
events of the world war are especially
sought.
The book and pamphlet collection now
numbers about forty-four thousand.
