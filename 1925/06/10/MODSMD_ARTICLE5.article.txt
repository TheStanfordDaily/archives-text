# STUDENT ACTIVITIES REPORTS SUBMITTED TO EX COMMITTEE
## Organizations Fund Deposits Show 20 Per Cent Gain Over 1923-24 
### 
Reports on student activities and
affairs connected with the General
Manager's office of the A. S. S. U.
were given in the annual report of the
General Manager of the A. S. S. U.
for the year 1924-25 which was read
to the Executive Committee last night.
Chief among the duties that were
acquired by the General Manager's
Office this year were those in connec
tion with the Students' Organizations'
Fund. In the report the work done
on the fund, which has this year in
creased its deposits to $110,000.00, ap
proximately 20 per cent above the
deposits of last year, was given.
Methods of procedure as contrasted
with the old method were given, and
ols several changes advocated to
eliminate present detriments.
The second item in the report was
in regard to the late Spectator. The
debit incurred by this magazine has
now been fully paid by the collection
of accounts due the publication, and
by the payment of .$1563.66 from the
A. S. S. U. treasury.
Debating Kept Within Budpet
Debating, handled directly by the.
Debating Manager, has this year been
kept strictly within its budget of five
hundred dollars. This is the first time
in several years that it has done so.
Several changes were advocated by
the General Manager's report in re
gard to dramatics. It was recom
mended that the Dramatic Manager be
dropped from regular membership in
the Dramatic Council and be made
'bnly an ex-officio member; that the
member who is supposed to represent
the society sponsoring the play be
dropped; and that in place of these,
two members be appointed or elected
to serve on the Council. This view is
also supported by Professor Bassett.
A second recommendation was in re
gard to the salary of the Dramatic
Business Manager. Praise was given
to the work of Delmer Daves for his
work of the past year, especially in
the publicity line.
Class Balancees Increase
Reports from the classes indicate
that the plan adopted by the classes
of selecting one man as class man
ager and making him responsible for
all of the finances for the entire year
was in the whole successful. Finan
cial reports indicated that each class
has considerably increased their bal
ance during the last year.
Mention was made of the plan of
having the Quad edited by the A. S.
S. U. instead of by the Junior Class
as formerly done.
The report on the Rally Committee
shows that under the financial man
agement of the General Manager's
Office, the net debit to the A. S. S. U.
has amounted to but seventy dollars
rather than several hundred dollars
last year's figure.
Dance Reports Complete
An effort has been made this year
to have a full and complete financial
report be turned in to the General
Manager's by the managers of campus
dances, thus affording a means for
managers of 1926 dancees to make
their estimate. Full reports of dra
matic productions were also received.
As the Military Ball was the only
social affair accruing a debt, it was
recommended that no date be granted
next year unless members of the Mili
tary department guarantee that they
will sell 150 non-transferable tickets
in their own department. The failure
of the Military department to support
the affair was believed to be one rea
son for its financial failure.
A. S. S. U. Surplus Grows
Report on the A. S. S. U. showed
that there was a balance of $1226.18
June 7 as against $865.16 September 1,
1924. The A. S. S. U. this year paid
off the Spectator indebtedness and
helped Sigma Delta Chi to finance the
journalistic convention for high school
editors, in addition to the usual ex
penditures.
The report was submitted by O. H.
Tucker, assistant to General Manager
Paul M. Davis.

Manager's office of the A. S. S. U.
were given in the annual report of the
General Manager of the A. S. S. U.
for the year 1924-25 which was read
to the Executive Committee last night.
Chief among the duties that were
acquired by the General Manager's
Office this year were those in connec
tion with the Students' Organizations'
Fund. In the report the work done
on the fund, which has this year in
creased its deposits to $110,000.00, ap
proximately 20 per cent above the
deposits of last year, was given.
Methods of procedure as contrasted
with the old method were given, and
ols several changes advocated to
eliminate present detriments.
The second item in the report was
in regard to the late Spectator. The
debit incurred by this magazine has
now been fully paid by the collection
of accounts due the publication, and
by the payment of .$1563.66 from the
A. S. S. U. treasury.
Debating Kept Within Budpet
Debating, handled directly by the.
Debating Manager, has this year been
kept strictly within its budget of five
hundred dollars. This is the first time
in several years that it has done so.
Several changes were advocated by
the General Manager's report in re
gard to dramatics. It was recom
mended that the Dramatic Manager be
dropped from regular membership in
the Dramatic Council and be made
'bnly an ex-officio member; that the
member who is supposed to represent
the society sponsoring the play be
dropped; and that in place of these,
two members be appointed or elected
to serve on the Council. This view is
also supported by Professor Bassett.
A second recommendation was in re
gard to the salary of the Dramatic
Business Manager. Praise was given
to the work of Delmer Daves for his
work of the past year, especially in
the publicity line.
Class Balancees Increase
Reports from the classes indicate
that the plan adopted by the classes
of selecting one man as class man
ager and making him responsible for
all of the finances for the entire year
was in the whole successful. Finan
cial reports indicated that each class
has considerably increased their bal
ance during the last year.
Mention was made of the plan of
having the Quad edited by the A. S.
S. U. instead of by the Junior Class
as formerly done.
The report on the Rally Committee
shows that under the financial man
agement of the General Manager's
Office, the net debit to the A. S. S. U.
has amounted to but seventy dollars
rather than several hundred dollars
last year's figure.
Dance Reports Complete
An effort has been made this year
to have a full and complete financial
report be turned in to the General
Manager's by the managers of campus
dances, thus affording a means for
managers of 1926 dancees to make
their estimate. Full reports of dra
matic productions were also received.
As the Military Ball was the only
social affair accruing a debt, it was
recommended that no date be granted
next year unless members of the Mili
tary department guarantee that they
will sell 150 non-transferable tickets
in their own department. The failure
of the Military department to support
the affair was believed to be one rea
son for its financial failure.
A. S. S. U. Surplus Grows
Report on the A. S. S. U. showed
that there was a balance of $1226.18
June 7 as against $865.16 September 1,
1924. The A. S. S. U. this year paid
off the Spectator indebtedness and
helped Sigma Delta Chi to finance the
journalistic convention for high school
editors, in addition to the usual ex
penditures.
The report was submitted by O. H.
Tucker, assistant to General Manager
Paul M. Davis.
