### 
Reports on student activities and
affairs connected with the General
Manager's office of the A. S. S. U.
were given in the annual report of the
General Manager of the A. S. S. U.
for the year 1924-25 which was read
to the Executive Committee last night.
Chief among the duties that were
acquired by the General Manager's
Office this year were those in connec
tion with the Students' Organizations'
Fund. In the report the work done
on the fund, which has this year in
creased its deposits to $110,000.00, ap
proximately 20 per cent above the
deposits of last year, was given.
Methods of procedure as contrasted
with the old method were given, and
ols several changes advocated to
eliminate present detriments.
The second item in the report was
in regard to the late Spectator. The
debit incurred by this magazine has
now been fully paid by the collection
of accounts due the publication, and
by the payment of .$1563.66 from the
A. S. S. U. treasury.
Debating Kept Within Budpet
Debating, handled directly by the.
Debating Manager, has this year been
kept strictly within its budget of five
hundred dollars. This is the first time
in several years that it has done so.
Several changes were advocated by
the General Manager's report in re
gard to dramatics. It was recom
mended that the Dramatic Manager be
dropped from regular membership in
the Dramatic Council and be made
'bnly an ex-officio member; that the
member who is supposed to represent
the society sponsoring the play be
dropped; and that in place of these,
two members be appointed or elected
to serve on the Council. This view is
also supported by Professor Bassett.
A second recommendation was in re
gard to the salary of the Dramatic
Business Manager. Praise was given
