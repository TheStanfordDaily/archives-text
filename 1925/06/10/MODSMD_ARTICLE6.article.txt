# Women Favor Swimming Over Other Athletics
## 
### 
Swimming is the most popular sport
| among Stanford women this quarter,
according to unofficial figures recently
compiled at Roble Gymnasium. There
l are 129 women registered in swim
| ming. Tennis is next with an enroll
â–  ment of 74. After these follow, in or
der, dancing, archery, track, and div
ing.
Formal gymnastics, being required
of all Lower Division women, has the
largest enrollment of all, but among
| the electives swimming seems to at-
I tract the most. Perhaps the Lagunita
| canoe test has some connection with
j that.
