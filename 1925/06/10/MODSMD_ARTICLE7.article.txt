# DAVIS PLACES FINISHING TOUCHES ON SENIOR FARCE
## Marjory Tussing Takes Role of Mrs. Van Zile in Place of Margaret Stebbins 
### 
A change in the < ast of "Polly With
a Past," which is tp be presented
June 17, was announced lust night by
Gordon Davis, who has since last
week been directing the production.
Marjory Tussing will take the role of
Mrs. Van Zile in place of Margaret
Stebbins, who was obliged to give up
the part because of pressure of
studies. Davis is pleased with the
progress made by th(* actors in the
past few rehearsals.
The cast now consists of Aileene

Burks and Leonard Schwartz in the
leading roles of Polly Shannon and
Rex Van Zile, respectively; Clay Col
lum, William Pabst; Harry Richard
son, Charles Parks; Stiles, Charles
Burgess; Prentice Van Zile, Norris
James; Mrs. Clementina Davis, Elsa
Jean Barber; Commodore "Bob"
Barker, Dave Lamson; Petrowski,
Ross Smith; Mrs. Van Zile, Marjory
Tussing; and Maid, Hulda Hoover.
Plot Is Absorbing
The story of "Polly With a Past" \
starts right off with a bang, and ac- j
cumlatees interest as it goes along
until it becomes as absorbing as a
typical "Who did it?" mystery melo
drama, because there are many dif- j
ferent things that might possibly hap-1
pen any minute. Polly Shannon, alias
(for the time being) Paulette Bady, ,
the wickedest or rather the most dan- j
gerous woman in Europe, has a rather j
difficult time in her adopted role to j
keep from having her identity dis
covered, or from having someone be- j

' sides Rex, for whose benefit the mas
! querade was arranged, falling in love
1 with her.
Paulette Bady was created as a
scheme to draw the attention of Myrtle
Davis, played by Arbie Stewart, whom
Rex loves In vain, away from her
human wrecks and social service to
Rex, who is, after all, only a poor
millionaire. To do this it is necessary
for Rex to begin somehow treading the
downward path. He won't drink, it
has to be "another woman," prefer-

ably of doubtful reputation with whom
his name is to be scandalously con
nected.
Bachelor Friends Launch Hoax
The "Paulette Bady" myth is
launched and fostered by Rex's two
bachelor friends, Clay Collum, interior
decorator and artist, and Harry Rich
ardson. Their maid, Polly Shannon,
who is merely a country girl from an
Ohio parsonage with ambitions to
cultivate her voice in Paris, is per
suaded to take the role. She is widely
rumored to have loved "not wisely but
too well," and among her victims it
is said that the great pianist Petrov
sky is numbered. He is supposed to
have shot himself, but when he tuins
up unexpectedly and demands "Why?"
there is a tense but humorous mo
ment.
Instead of Myrtle saving Rex from
Paulette, it is Polly who saves him
from Myrtle, but that is the big heart
interest and must be reserved for the
evening of the last day of finals.

Scene from "Polly With a Past." From left to right: Aileene Burks, Norris
James, Charles Burgess, Charles Parks, and Arbie Stewart.
A change in the < ast of "Polly With
a Past," which is tp be presented
June 17, was announced lust night by
Gordon Davis, who has since last
week been directing the production.
Marjory Tussing will take the role of
Mrs. Van Zile in place of Margaret
Stebbins, who was obliged to give up
the part because of pressure of
studies. Davis is pleased with the
progress made by th(* actors in the
past few rehearsals.
The cast now consists of Aileene

Burks and Leonard Schwartz in the
leading roles of Polly Shannon and
Rex Van Zile, respectively; Clay Col
lum, William Pabst; Harry Richard
son, Charles Parks; Stiles, Charles
Burgess; Prentice Van Zile, Norris
James; Mrs. Clementina Davis, Elsa
Jean Barber; Commodore "Bob"
Barker, Dave Lamson; Petrowski,
Ross Smith; Mrs. Van Zile, Marjory
Tussing; and Maid, Hulda Hoover.
Plot Is Absorbing
The story of "Polly With a Past" \
starts right off with a bang, and ac- j
cumlatees interest as it goes along
until it becomes as absorbing as a
typical "Who did it?" mystery melo
drama, because there are many dif- j
ferent things that might possibly hap-1
pen any minute. Polly Shannon, alias
(for the time being) Paulette Bady, ,
the wickedest or rather the most dan- j
gerous woman in Europe, has a rather j
difficult time in her adopted role to j
keep from having her identity dis
covered, or from having someone be- j

' sides Rex, for whose benefit the mas
! querade was arranged, falling in love
1 with her.
Paulette Bady was created as a
scheme to draw the attention of Myrtle
Davis, played by Arbie Stewart, whom
Rex loves In vain, away from her
human wrecks and social service to
Rex, who is, after all, only a poor
millionaire. To do this it is necessary
for Rex to begin somehow treading the
downward path. He won't drink, it
has to be "another woman," prefer-

ably of doubtful reputation with whom
his name is to be scandalously con
nected.
Bachelor Friends Launch Hoax
The "Paulette Bady" myth is
launched and fostered by Rex's two
bachelor friends, Clay Collum, interior
decorator and artist, and Harry Rich
ardson. Their maid, Polly Shannon,
who is merely a country girl from an
Ohio parsonage with ambitions to
cultivate her voice in Paris, is per
suaded to take the role. She is widely
rumored to have loved "not wisely but
too well," and among her victims it
is said that the great pianist Petrov
sky is numbered. He is supposed to
have shot himself, but when he tuins
up unexpectedly and demands "Why?"
there is a tense but humorous mo
ment.
Instead of Myrtle saving Rex from
Paulette, it is Polly who saves him
from Myrtle, but that is the big heart
interest and must be reserved for the
evening of the last day of finals.
