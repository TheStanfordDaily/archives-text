# GRADUATE SCHOOL OF BUSINESS OPENS IN FALL QUARTER
## Willard E. Hotchkiss Comes to Stanford as Head of New Department 
### 
To train selected students for busi
ness leadership, particularly to meet
the conditions of the Pacific Coast and
the special problems of the rapidly
developing West, Stanford University
has established a Graduate School of
Business. The school will open at the
beginning of the college year in Octo
ber, President Wilbur announces, with
Willard E. Hotchkiss, pioneer in this
field of education and industrial coun
sel to a number of the country's in
dustrial enterprises, as dean and with
support of $40,000 a year for five
years, contributed by a group of pro
gressive business men of California
who feel the need of the kind of train
ing the Stanford school proposes to
offer.
Dean Hotchkiss in 1907-08 organized
the School of Commerce at North
western University in Chicago and
served as its dean until 1917, when
lie was called to the University of
Minnesota to organize the School of
Business there. He is now giving
graduate courses in industrial man
agement and personnel at Northwest
ern, but for several years has been
devoting most of his time to the prac
tical application of his expert knowl
edge, having among his clients in this
capacity such enterprises as the Na
tional Industrial Federation of Cloth
ing Manufacturers, the Institute of
American Meat Packers, and the
United States Coal Commission.
Dr. Hotchkiss is well known among
business men and educators of the
Pacific Coast. He was a visiting pro
fessor at Stanford in 1915-16, and at
the University of California in the
summer session of 1916, where he also
delivered that year the lectures on the
Weinstock Morals of Trade Founda
tion. The substance of these lectures
lie later embodied in a book, "Higher
Education and Business Standards."
Another book of his that attracted at
tention is "Judicial Work of the
Comptroller of the Currency, Com
pared with Similar Functions in the
Governments of France and Germany,"
a study of administrative law.
He has recently developed a course
of study for men employed by the
American Meat Packers, constituting
a college course upon its completion
and administered by the University of
Chicago and the Meat Packers in co
operation.
The Stanford School of Business
will be a purely graduate school, ac
cepting only a selected group of col
lege graduates for a training course
which will occupy a full two years,
including a half year of observation
or employment in some actual busi
ness concern. In its work it will par
ticularly stress preparation to meet
the present and future needs of busi
ness on the Pacific Coast.
"Stanford proposes to build a grad
uate school of business of the first
rank," said President Ray Lyman
Wilbur in making the announcement
of the acceptance by the University
Board of Trustees of the pledge of a
group of business men of the state to
pledge the financial support of the
school and the preparations to open
it next fall.
"The growth of every form of com
merce and industry in the Western
part of the United States calls for a
corresponding development of broadly
trained ability and comprehensive out
look to direct it wisely. This coast
especially, with its rapidly growing
population and expansion of varied
enterprises and with the increasing
prominence in world affairs which its
situation on the eastern shore of the
Pacific ocean entails, demands care
ful and expert attention to the devel
opment of capable and broad-minded
business leadership. Stanford Univer
sity, we believe, is in a peculiarly for
tunate situation, geographically and in
the intellectual field, to aid in the
training of these leaders."
In preparation for admission stu
dents are advised to include in their
undergraduate courses a considerable
amount of biological and physical
laboratory study, history, literature,
social sciences, and mathematics,
these branches being regarded as fur
nishing a more desirable foundation
for the sort of graduate training pro
posed than too much preliminary spe
cialization, although it is recommended
that some work in statistics and ele
mentary accounting be included, if
that can be done without sacrificing
general educational aims. Stanford al
ready has in operation a course that
meets these requirements.
In the first year of the School of
Business as much as a quarter of the
student's time may be devoted to ad
justment of his previous training, fill
ing in gaps either in his knowledge of
subjects especially required for his
profession education or in his breadth
of general education. The remainder
of that year will be occupied with
such subjects as the bases of business,
in geographical and other natural con
ditions, human relations, scientific and
engineering features of administra
tion,, law and public policy, and some
more technical subjects. The second
year will take up more specialized
subjects, and a third of the time will
be devoted to the development of a
particular specialty of the student's
choice.
