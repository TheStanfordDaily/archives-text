# DR. JONES STRESSES FAITH IN SERMON
## 
### 
Dr. Rufus M. Jones, professor of
philosophy at Haverford College,
Penna., delivered the baccalaureate
sermon in Memorial Church last Sun
day, taking as his text the subject of
"Faith."
Stressing the importance of faith in
aiding men to accomplish the seem
ingly impossible, Dr. Jones told the
eight hundred graduates that "Faith
is a way of doing the impossible, of
doing what you can't â€”finding a way
forward when there seems to be none.
It is 'doing the things no man can
do.'"
