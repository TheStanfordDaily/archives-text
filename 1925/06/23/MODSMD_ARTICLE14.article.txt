# COOPERATION TOPIC OF HOOVER'S SPEECH TO GRADUATING CLASS
## 
### 
Herbert C. Hoover, secretary of
commerce, and a member of the
Stanford University Board of Trus
tees, delivered an address, without
previous announcement, at the com
mencement exercises in the Memorial
Church yesterday.
Hoover's theme, in addressing the
800 graduates, was the need of build
ing up a spirit of co-operation between
the great organizations that have
grown up in the industrial, business
and agricultural life of the nation, and
of preserving the forces of initiative
and individual enterprise upon which
the national prosperity has been
founded.
"The dominating force of this last
century has been economic develop
ment," he declared. "And it continues
today as the force which dominates
the whole spiritual, social and polit
ical life of our country and the world.
But today it is taking new forms which
promise either greater progress to
ward happiness or equally rapid prog
ress toward destruction —just as its
leadership may determine.
"This vast era of material progress
has been builded upon great liberty of
individual action. But its very liber
ties presented us a thousand difficul
ties, for individuals were using these
great instruments of science to dom- (
inate our people.
"Slowly but surely we have been
turning from extreme individualism to
larger organized action.
"The growth of organized associ
ations is not necessarily bad in itself.
We must extend common action. Our
industrial transformation to a national
scale requires national thinking and
planning.
"If we can summon the responsibil
ities of these groups to the nation as
a whole and toward each other, if
they will represent the spirit of our
forefathers, of intelligent self-interest
and neighborly co-operation, they will
enable us to master the cumulated
difficulties of our century of industrial
complexity instead of having these
difficulties master us.
"It is idle to argue that there are at
times no conflicts of interest between
groups. But the areas of common in
terest are infinitely greater and it is
the part of statesmanship on all sides
to organize this identity of interest in
order to limit the area of conflict.
"These groups must learn that
progress will not come from crushing
the individual into a shapeless mass,
but in giving him enlarged opportu
nity. They must learn to understand
each other and not to fight.
"They must realize that long-view
intelligent self-interest implies their
close partnership in endeavor, and in
telligent self-interest is a sufficiently
close approach to altruism.
"In fact, all these economic groups
represent but parts of a co-operative
society, for one group must produce
the food, another conduct the trans
portation, another the banking and
another move the coal.
"There can be no contentment and
no assurance of security or progress
until every group shall be relieved of
all justified feeling of injustice or
oppression, whether the group be
labor, farmer, railway or merchant.
"None of these great problems of
ours will ever be rightly solved unless
we first obtain an understanding of
intelligent self-interest and establish
and maintain the spirit and leadership
in co-operation and the sense of neigh
borly service among these groups."
If the present civilization is to be
kept on an even keel and steered to
its "glorious purpose" of economic se
curity and progress if democracy is to
be sustained and if an equality of op
portunity is to be maintained, said
Secretary Hoover, "it must be directed
by the good will of good neighbors."
Solutions will not be found in eco
nomic patent medicines of government
action, he declared.
"We cannot cure foolishness by
legislation," he said. "We cannot catch
economic forces with a bureau. Yet

we can influence economic forces by
co-operation in the community.
"The national and local governments
must cure abuse and fraud and they
can act as umpires. They can do
many other things. But, above all,
they can best serve the community >
by bringing about co-operation in the j
large sense between groups.
"It is the failure of groups to re
spond to their responsibilities to others I
that drives government more and I
more into the lives of the people.'
And every time a government is forced
to act we lose something in self-re- i
liance, character and initiative.
"Every time we find solution out-1
side of government we have not only j
strengthened character but we have j
preserved our sense of real self-gov
ernment.
"The test of our generation will be '
whether we maintain the character
that can overcome economic frontiers j
and unexplored plains as forbidding, 1
as romantic, and as pregnant of added
happiness as our fathers ever knew, 1
whether we can master the forces we ;
have created, whether we can hold
ourselves a nation dedicated to equal !
opportunity for all."

by the good will of good neighbors."
Solutions will not be found in eco
nomic patent medicines of government
action, he declared.
"We cannot cure foolishness by
legislation," he said. "We cannot catch
economic forces with a bureau. Yet

we can influence economic forces by
co-operation in the community.
"The national and local governments
must cure abuse and fraud and they
can act as umpires. They can do
many other things. But, above all,
they can best serve the community >
by bringing about co-operation in the j
large sense between groups.
"It is the failure of groups to re
spond to their responsibilities to others I
that drives government more and I
more into the lives of the people.'
And every time a government is forced
to act we lose something in self-re- i
liance, character and initiative.
"Every time we find solution out-1
side of government we have not only j
strengthened character but we have j
preserved our sense of real self-gov
ernment.
"The test of our generation will be '
whether we maintain the character
that can overcome economic frontiers j
and unexplored plains as forbidding, 1
as romantic, and as pregnant of added
happiness as our fathers ever knew, 1
whether we can master the forces we ;
have created, whether we can hold
ourselves a nation dedicated to equal !
opportunity for all."
Herbert C. Hoover, secretary of
commerce, and a member of the
Stanford University Board of Trus
tees, delivered an address, without
previous announcement, at the com
mencement exercises in the Memorial
Church yesterday.
Hoover's theme, in addressing the
800 graduates, was the need of build
ing up a spirit of co-operation between
the great organizations that have
grown up in the industrial, business
and agricultural life of the nation, and
of preserving the forces of initiative
and individual enterprise upon which
the national prosperity has been
founded.
"The dominating force of this last
century has been economic develop
ment," he declared. "And it continues
today as the force which dominates
the whole spiritual, social and polit
ical life of our country and the world.
But today it is taking new forms which
promise either greater progress to
ward happiness or equally rapid prog
ress toward destruction —just as its
leadership may determine.
"This vast era of material progress
has been builded upon great liberty of
individual action. But its very liber
ties presented us a thousand difficul
ties, for individuals were using these
great instruments of science to dom- (
inate our people.
"Slowly but surely we have been
turning from extreme individualism to
larger organized action.
"The growth of organized associ
ations is not necessarily bad in itself.
We must extend common action. Our
industrial transformation to a national
scale requires national thinking and
planning.
"If we can summon the responsibil
ities of these groups to the nation as
a whole and toward each other, if
they will represent the spirit of our
forefathers, of intelligent self-interest
and neighborly co-operation, they will
enable us to master the cumulated
difficulties of our century of industrial
complexity instead of having these
difficulties master us.
"It is idle to argue that there are at
times no conflicts of interest between
groups. But the areas of common in
terest are infinitely greater and it is
the part of statesmanship on all sides
to organize this identity of interest in
order to limit the area of conflict.
"These groups must learn that
progress will not come from crushing
the individual into a shapeless mass,
but in giving him enlarged opportu
nity. They must learn to understand
each other and not to fight.
"They must realize that long-view
intelligent self-interest implies their
close partnership in endeavor, and in
telligent self-interest is a sufficiently
close approach to altruism.
"In fact, all these economic groups
represent but parts of a co-operative
society, for one group must produce
the food, another conduct the trans
portation, another the banking and
another move the coal.
"There can be no contentment and
no assurance of security or progress
until every group shall be relieved of
all justified feeling of injustice or
oppression, whether the group be
labor, farmer, railway or merchant.
"None of these great problems of
ours will ever be rightly solved unless
we first obtain an understanding of
intelligent self-interest and establish
and maintain the spirit and leadership
in co-operation and the sense of neigh
borly service among these groups."
If the present civilization is to be
kept on an even keel and steered to
its "glorious purpose" of economic se
curity and progress if democracy is to
be sustained and if an equality of op
portunity is to be maintained, said
Secretary Hoover, "it must be directed

"These groups must learn that
progress will not come from crushing
the individual into a shapeless mass,
but in giving him enlarged opportu

each other and not to fight.

intelligent self-interest implies their
close partnership in endeavor, and in
telligent self-interest is a sufficiently
close approach to altruism.
"In fact, all these economic groups
represent but parts of a co-operative
society, for one group must produce

portation, another the banking and

"There can be no contentment and
no assurance of security or progress
until every group shall be relieved of
all justified feeling of injustice or
oppression, whether the group be
labor, farmer, railway or merchant.
"None of these great problems of
ours will ever be rightly solved unless
we first obtain an understanding of
intelligent self-interest and establish
and maintain the spirit and leadership
in co-operation and the sense of neigh
borly service among these groups."
If the present civilization is to be
kept on an even keel and steered to

curity and progress if democracy is to

Secretary Hoover, "it must be directed
by the good will of good neighbors."

"We cannot cure foolishness by

many other things. But, above all,

"The test of our generation will be '
whether we maintain the character

Herbert C. Hoover, secretary of
commerce, and a member of the
Stanford University Board of Trus
tees, delivered an address, without
previous announcement, at the com
mencement exercises in the Memorial
Church yesterday.
Hoover's theme, in addressing the
800 graduates, was the need of build
ing up a spirit of co-operation between
the great organizations that have
grown up in the industrial, business
and agricultural life of the nation, and
of preserving the forces of initiative
and individual enterprise upon which
the national prosperity has been
founded.
"The dominating force of this last
century has been economic develop
ment," he declared. "And it continues
today as the force which dominates
the whole spiritual, social and polit
ical life of our country and the world.
But today it is taking new forms which
promise either greater progress to
ward happiness or equally rapid prog
ress toward destruction —just as its
leadership may determine.
"This vast era of material progress
has been builded upon great liberty of
individual action. But its very liber
ties presented us a thousand difficul
ties, for individuals were using these
great instruments of science to dom- (
inate our people.
"Slowly but surely we have been
turning from extreme individualism to
larger organized action.
"The growth of organized associ
ations is not necessarily bad in itself.
We must extend common action. Our
industrial transformation to a national
scale requires national thinking and
planning.
"If we can summon the responsibil
ities of these groups to the nation as
a whole and toward each other, if
they will represent the spirit of our
forefathers, of intelligent self-interest
and neighborly co-operation, they will
enable us to master the cumulated
difficulties of our century of industrial
complexity instead of having these
difficulties master us.
"It is idle to argue that there are at
times no conflicts of interest between
groups. But the areas of common in
terest are infinitely greater and it is
the part of statesmanship on all sides
to organize this identity of interest in
order to limit the area of conflict.
"These groups must learn that
progress will not come from crushing
the individual into a shapeless mass,
but in giving him enlarged opportu
nity. They must learn to understand
each other and not to fight.
"They must realize that long-view
intelligent self-interest implies their
