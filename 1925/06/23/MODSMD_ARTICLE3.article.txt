# SENIOR FARCE HAS RECORD AUDIENCE; AILEEN BURKS STARS
## 
### Stanley A. Weigel 
"Polly With a Past" concluded an emi
nently successful Stanford dramatic sea
son last Wednesday night by tickling,
often and forcibly, the sensibilities of one
of the largest Senior Farce audiences on
record.
As a whole, the play was exceptionally
well cast, the handling of comedy situa
tions was excellent and the costumes and
settings were effectively beautiful. Gor
don Davis merits great praise for making
"Polly" a really finished production with
in the short and hectic week of his direc
tion.
Among the players, Aileene Burks was
outstanding in the name role. To change
from Polly Shannon, a sweet and guile
less minister's daughter, to Mme. Paulette
Baudet, a wicked and dangerous Parisian
siren is, you'll agree, no slight undertak
ing. Miss Burks not only did the trick
but did it convincingly. Ask Norris James
who played Uncle Prentice Van Zile who
"knew all about women."
Aileene Burks Stars
Miss Burks used a colorfully flexible
voice to good advantage. Her stage
presence bordered the professional. The
combination was, well—it was Polly
Shannon and Mme. Baudet about as near
real life as those two lovely ladies will
ever come. Pity the poor reviewer who
has to find superlatives for Miss Burks'
future work.
While dispensing the high-powered ad
jectivesv, it won't do at all not to speak of
Charles Parks' finished characterization
of Harry Richardson, the resourceful
young bachelor who did his best to aid a
fellow man in distress, that is, love. On
Parks turned many of the comedy lines
and to him must be credited a goodly num
ber of the laughs produced.
Parks stepped into the role at the last
minute after he had handled the prelimi
nary directing prior to Gordon Davis' re
turn from the East.
Leonard Schwartz as young Rex Van
Zile had the thankless job of burlesquing
love-sick youth. His splendid work in
the second and third acts completely over
shadowed some few first act flaws. Par
ticularly fine was his acting in the climax
of the second act which, literally, stopped
the show.
Arbie Stewart as Myrtle Davis was a
very beautiful young "salvager of human
wrecks." Her performance was capable
throughout and although she was terribly
cruel to poor Rex at the beginning, we
rather hoped that someone—Clay Collum
or Harry Richardson—would fall in love
with her before the final curtain. But it
was not to be.
Action Is in 1919 B. P.
The action of the play transpired about
the year 1919 B. P. (before prohibition).
We mention this in order that you may
understand Stiles, one of Myrtle's sal
vaged wrecks. After some weeks of
Myrtle's reformation,. Stiles disclosed the
I fact that his idea of the higher and more
J spiritual was a fifteen-cent drink. Charles
Burgess as Stiles won merited applause.
Bill Pabst as Clay Collum had a lot of
fun as chief diplomat tangling and un
tangling the bonds between Rex and
i Myrtle. Clay, with Harry Richardson,
proposed to Myrtle for Rex. She ac
cepted. Then Rex found he was in love
with Polly. Clay Collum, sad to relate,
j was sent off stage to explain to Myrtle
I and if his explanation was anything like
j his part in the proposal, the audience was
| deprived of some choice humor.
Norris James did the how-much-do
: you-want experienced man stuff with the
! efficiency one would expect of a real
Prentice Van Zile. Dave Lamson as Com
modore "Bob" Barker made brave but
fruitless attempts to date Mme. Baudet
and proved himself a capable actor in the
process.
Elsa Barber and Marjory Tussing as
Mrs. Davis and Mrs. Van Zile, respect
ively, carried mature parts maturely.
Which is to say that they did nobly.
Ross Smith as the supposedly dead
Russian pianist and Hulda Hoover as a
maid rounded out what may very well be
termed an all-star cast.

student dramatics.

Elsa Barber and Marjory Tussing as
Mrs. Davis and Mrs. Van Zile, respect

"Polly With a Past" concluded an emi
nently successful Stanford dramatic sea
son last Wednesday night by tickling,
often and forcibly, the sensibilities of one
of the largest Senior Farce audiences on
record.
As a whole, the play was exceptionally
well cast, the handling of comedy situa
tions was excellent and the costumes and
settings were effectively beautiful. Gor
don Davis merits great praise for making
"Polly" a really finished production with
in the short and hectic week of his direc
tion.
Among the players, Aileene Burks was
outstanding in the name role. To change
from Polly Shannon, a sweet and guile
less minister's daughter, to Mme. Paulette
Baudet, a wicked and dangerous Parisian
siren is, you'll agree, no slight undertak
ing. Miss Burks not only did the trick
but did it convincingly. Ask Norris James
who played Uncle Prentice Van Zile who
"knew all about women."
Aileene Burks Stars
Miss Burks used a colorfully flexible
voice to good advantage. Her stage
presence bordered the professional. The
combination was, well—it was Polly
Shannon and Mme. Baudet about as near
real life as those two lovely ladies will
ever come. Pity the poor reviewer who
has to find superlatives for Miss Burks'
future work.
While dispensing the high-powered ad
jectivesv, it won't do at all not to speak of
Charles Parks' finished characterization
of Harry Richardson, the resourceful
young bachelor who did his best to aid a
fellow man in distress, that is, love. On
Parks turned many of the comedy lines
and to him must be credited a goodly num
ber of the laughs produced.
Parks stepped into the role at the last
minute after he had handled the prelimi
nary directing prior to Gordon Davis' re
turn from the East.
Leonard Schwartz as young Rex Van
Zile had the thankless job of burlesquing
love-sick youth. His splendid work in
the second and third acts completely over
shadowed some few first act flaws. Par
ticularly fine was his acting in the climax
of the second act which, literally, stopped
the show.
Arbie Stewart as Myrtle Davis was a
very beautiful young "salvager of human
wrecks." Her performance was capable
throughout and although she was terribly
cruel to poor Rex at the beginning, we
rather hoped that someone—Clay Collum
or Harry Richardson—would fall in love
with her before the final curtain. But it
was not to be.
Action Is in 1919 B. P.
The action of the play transpired about
the year 1919 B. P. (before prohibition).
We mention this in order that you may
understand Stiles, one of Myrtle's sal
vaged wrecks. After some weeks of
Myrtle's reformation,. Stiles disclosed the
I fact that his idea of the higher and more
J spiritual was a fifteen-cent drink. Charles
Burgess as Stiles won merited applause.
Bill Pabst as Clay Collum had a lot of
fun as chief diplomat tangling and un
tangling the bonds between Rex and
i Myrtle. Clay, with Harry Richardson,
proposed to Myrtle for Rex. She ac
cepted. Then Rex found he was in love
with Polly. Clay Collum, sad to relate,
j was sent off stage to explain to Myrtle
I and if his explanation was anything like
j his part in the proposal, the audience was
| deprived of some choice humor.
