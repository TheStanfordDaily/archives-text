# BLINDERS FATAL TO PROGRESS-WILBUR
## "Face Facts" Is Key-note of Commencement Address to Class of 1925 
### 
Superstitions, taboos, dogmas, folk-lore
and old wives' tales are blinders "put on
us, or by others for us, to keep us from
seeing in all directions, to force us to see
only a part and a chosen part of our sur
roundings," President Ray Lyman Wil
bur told members of the Class of 1925 in
Memorial Church yesterday at Stanford's
thirty-fourth annual commencement.
"To put on such blinders is a favorite
way the old have for bringing up the
young," he said. "It is easier to teach a
prejudice than to urge fairness. It is
easier to beat a drum or squirt th blood of
a black cat killed in the dark of the moon
on a sick man than it is to use the micro
scope and the test tube in studying him
with the result perhaps of changing the
water supply for his neighbors to keep
them from the same illness.
"It is easier to pull down the sliades to
new and disquieting light than to face it
unafraid."
President Wilbur, in developing his sub
ject, "Blinders," said that "our eyes are
directed backward more than forward in
much of the educational process which we
use to train men and women for the days
ahead.
No Change in Bodies
"Our records are crowded with much
human experience, and we know a great
deal about ourselves and the world. It
seems clear that man's body is pretty
much that of many centurics ago.
"While we live longer, have fewer epi
demics and less days of illness, no one
would seriously claim that Nurmi could
run better than some of the Marathon
runners of Greece, or that John L. Sulli
van or Jack Dempsey had finer bodies than
Samson or Goliath or some of the gladi
ators of Rome.
"There is no evidence that the quality
of man's mind has improved in spite of
centuries of training. Solomon, Solon,
Hippocratcs, Leonardo da Vinci, Pascal,
Shakespeare, Lincoln, would be hard for
us to match even in these days of hun
dreds of universities.
Christ's Code Is Best
"Great moral teachers developed under
living conditions which would affront a
modern sheepherder. Confucius pictured
man's relationship to his neighbor in a
way that has been an ideal for hundreds
of millions. Christ knew the heart and
spirit of man and in his short life built a
code of living on the basis laid down by
the Jews which is perfect in its relation
ship to love, happiness and human co
operation.
"Man's body, man's mind, man's moral
conceptions, show no greater capacities
than in the past centuries of which we
have knowledge. The fundamental ele
ments in man's environment have not
changed, and yet he has so changed this
environment that we. have a new world.
