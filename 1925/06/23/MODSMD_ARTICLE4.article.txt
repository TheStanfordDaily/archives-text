# BLINDERS FATAL TO PROGRESS-WILBUR
## "Face Facts" Is Key-note of Commencement Address to Class of 1925 
### 
Superstitions, taboos, dogmas, folk-lore
and old wives' tales are blinders "put on
us, or by others for us, to keep us from
seeing in all directions, to force us to see
only a part and a chosen part of our sur
roundings," President Ray Lyman Wil
bur told members of the Class of 1925 in
Memorial Church yesterday at Stanford's
thirty-fourth annual commencement.
"To put on such blinders is a favorite
way the old have for bringing up the
young," he said. "It is easier to teach a
prejudice than to urge fairness. It is
easier to beat a drum or squirt th blood of
a black cat killed in the dark of the moon
on a sick man than it is to use the micro
scope and the test tube in studying him
with the result perhaps of changing the
water supply for his neighbors to keep
them from the same illness.
"It is easier to pull down the sliades to
new and disquieting light than to face it
unafraid."
President Wilbur, in developing his sub
ject, "Blinders," said that "our eyes are
directed backward more than forward in
much of the educational process which we
use to train men and women for the days
ahead.
No Change in Bodies
"Our records are crowded with much
human experience, and we know a great
deal about ourselves and the world. It
seems clear that man's body is pretty
much that of many centurics ago.
"While we live longer, have fewer epi
demics and less days of illness, no one
would seriously claim that Nurmi could
run better than some of the Marathon
runners of Greece, or that John L. Sulli
van or Jack Dempsey had finer bodies than
Samson or Goliath or some of the gladi
ators of Rome.
"There is no evidence that the quality
of man's mind has improved in spite of
centuries of training. Solomon, Solon,
Hippocratcs, Leonardo da Vinci, Pascal,
Shakespeare, Lincoln, would be hard for
us to match even in these days of hun
dreds of universities.
Christ's Code Is Best
"Great moral teachers developed under
living conditions which would affront a
modern sheepherder. Confucius pictured
man's relationship to his neighbor in a
way that has been an ideal for hundreds
of millions. Christ knew the heart and
spirit of man and in his short life built a
code of living on the basis laid down by
the Jews which is perfect in its relation
ship to love, happiness and human co
operation.
"Man's body, man's mind, man's moral
conceptions, show no greater capacities
than in the past centuries of which we
have knowledge. The fundamental ele
ments in man's environment have not
changed, and yet he has so changed this
environment that we. have a new world.
"Man is man because he has learned to
use his brain in guiding his body in strug
gling against his enemies and in conquer
ing many of the forces in his surround
ings. He has advanced by using experi
ence and the experimental method as his
two great tools. His couriosity, his un
quenchable fighting qualities, his coopera
tive spirit, combined with the use of
thought, have given him such success as
is his.
Courage Is Necessary
"Above all there have always been dar
ing men who could and would not be
baffled by the unknown. They were de
termined to explore unknown lands and
were willing to try and be beaten and yet
unknown domains open only to those who
never fail to keep on trying. Electricity
has always been in the world. All our dis
coverers and inventors have done is to ar
range metal, rubber, cloth, the flow of
water from a height, in such a way as to
permit it to follow the unchangeable laws
controlling its action.
"Caesar could have seen the fractured
bones of his soldiers just as readily as our
army surgeons'did in France had someone
worked out a proper mechanical contriv
ance to send the Roentgen rays through
the body.
"There is undoubtedly a host of con
cealed facts just as significant as those
now known, and we are certainly piling up
fact on fact in the last two generations
in a way which shows that man's advance
has come from learning to understand and
control an environment which has been
his all of the time.
Observation Is Important
"lust as the telescoped forced upon him
the idea of a universe orderly and yet in
finite, so has the microscope brought into
vision his minute living enemies capable
of destroying his unseen. A few observa
tions through the telescope, a look at the
past records, and a few dark scratches on
a piece of paper, made by the right man,
permits us all to know the exact second
when one big round ball will get in be
tween us and a still larger one and cause
what we call an eclipse. Some one brings
together substances always available, and
in that process we have the explosion of
dynamite. Another brings an electric
spark into contact with gasoline in a con
trivance with wings and we fly around
"It is a marvelous story, this use of
this sphere.
man's mind to reveal his environment, this
mastery by him of forcesâ€”and apparently
it is just begun. Will it go forward or
will the savage again have his day? Our
years of enlightenment have been but few,
our years of savagery many. Each of us
is a blend in different measure of deep

seated emotions, fears, prejudices, coming
out of the past. . . .
Know Facts First
"If there was any real object in giving
you a university education it was to make
it possible for you to know something of
facts and their significance, of forces and
their inevitable consequences, of our or
derly universe with its dependable rules.
"There is no good way to dodge the
truth. In meeting facts it is well to keep
in mind the warning of the darky about
mules, 'When I has any thing to say to a
mule I sez it to his face.'
"To meet facts square on without blind
ers is a sign of education. It is equally
as important to know where the limita
tions of our senses begin, and to recognize
the differences of approach due to heredity
and upbringing. The old proverb, 'To
know all is to forgive all,' makes a good
approach to your neighbor's problem, par
ticularly if religion or spots of pigment
in the skin separate you.
"In spite of research work and much
honest thinking we blunder because of pre
conceptions and partial knowledge. The
horizon is still dim and confused. We are
getting a clearer vision as we get clearer
lenses to see through and more willing
ness to look at everything in our field of
vision. The experimental method has
revolutionized man's environment and
combined with reason and freedom of
thought will still further mould and
change it. These changes cannot make
the body or mind of man of better fiber,
but they can by changing his morals and
religion make him a prey to his own
achievement just as they can set him free
from savagry and its accompaniments if
he is willing to lift himself out of the
morass and accept the guidance of truth.
Society Is Complex
"Individuals have value insofar as they
see clearly. When they fall back on pre
judices they join the crowd. Our social
structure is becoming more and more com
plex. It needs those who know what is
known to be the guides. It needs, too,
those who are trying to know more. Too
many, confused by the intricacies of the
new knowledge, want to turn back to the
apparent security of the past. There is no
turning back, except to failure, and lead
ership is forced on university trained men
and women. Russia shows that they can
not be spared.
"You now join with those already in the
game of life. You will fit into all sorts of
places in this stream of human living.
You will add your part either in pulling

or holding hack, or merely sliding along.
What you add will be iticreased if you can
keep off the blinders and fight ignorance
and all of its progeny.
"You can hardly fail to maintain a high
level of service, character and moral
force. Stanford has given you the chance
to see what they mean. Respect tlie old
when it lias proven itself. You cannot
hope to defy human experience. The
rules you violate will get you as they get
those who met them before.
"The young man who learns by obser
vation of the fool who is learning by ex
perience things known for centuries, gets
farthest ahead. You need no one to tell
you the things that are wrong. You
learned that years ago.
"Our student self-government shows us
that the real problem is to know what is
wise and to have emotional control enough
through reason to do it. Your satisfac
tions will come from what you do, not
from what you plan to do. Your dreams
can be made realities by work and more
work, and knowing how and where to
work is this university's greatest contri
bution to your welfare."

years of enlightenment have been but few,

out of the past. . . .
Know Facts First
"If there was any real object in giving
you a university education it was to make
it possible for you to know something of
facts and their significance, of forces and
their inevitable consequences, of our or
derly universe with its dependable rules.
"There is no good way to dodge the
truth. In meeting facts it is well to keep
in mind the warning of the darky about
mules, 'When I has any thing to say to a
mule I sez it to his face.'
"To meet facts square on without blind
ers is a sign of education. It is equally
as important to know where the limita
tions of our senses begin, and to recognize
the differences of approach due to heredity
and upbringing. The old proverb, 'To
know all is to forgive all,' makes a good
approach to your neighbor's problem, par
ticularly if religion or spots of pigment
in the skin separate you.
"In spite of research work and much
honest thinking we blunder because of pre
conceptions and partial knowledge. The
horizon is still dim and confused. We are
getting a clearer vision as we get clearer
lenses to see through and more willing
ness to look at everything in our field of
vision. The experimental method has
revolutionized man's environment and
combined with reason and freedom of
thought will still further mould and
change it. These changes cannot make
the body or mind of man of better fiber,
but they can by changing his morals and
religion make him a prey to his own
achievement just as they can set him free
from savagry and its accompaniments if
he is willing to lift himself out of the
morass and accept the guidance of truth.
Society Is Complex
"Individuals have value insofar as they
see clearly. When they fall back on pre
judices they join the crowd. Our social
structure is becoming more and more com
plex. It needs those who know what is
known to be the guides. It needs, too,
those who are trying to know more. Too
many, confused by the intricacies of the
new knowledge, want to turn back to the
apparent security of the past. There is no
turning back, except to failure, and lead
ership is forced on university trained men
and women. Russia shows that they can
not be spared.
"You now join with those already in the
game of life. You will fit into all sorts of
places in this stream of human living.
You will add your part either in pulling

or holding hack, or merely sliding along.
What you add will be iticreased if you can
keep off the blinders and fight ignorance
and all of its progeny.
"You can hardly fail to maintain a high
level of service, character and moral
force. Stanford has given you the chance
to see what they mean. Respect tlie old
when it lias proven itself. You cannot
hope to defy human experience. The
rules you violate will get you as they get
those who met them before.
"The young man who learns by obser
vation of the fool who is learning by ex
perience things known for centuries, gets
farthest ahead. You need no one to tell
you the things that are wrong. You
learned that years ago.
"Our student self-government shows us
that the real problem is to know what is
wise and to have emotional control enough
through reason to do it. Your satisfac
tions will come from what you do, not
from what you plan to do. Your dreams
can be made realities by work and more
work, and knowing how and where to
work is this university's greatest contri
bution to your welfare."
Superstitions, taboos, dogmas, folk-lore
and old wives' tales are blinders "put on
us, or by others for us, to keep us from
seeing in all directions, to force us to see
only a part and a chosen part of our sur
roundings," President Ray Lyman Wil
bur told members of the Class of 1925 in
Memorial Church yesterday at Stanford's
thirty-fourth annual commencement.
"To put on such blinders is a favorite
way the old have for bringing up the
young," he said. "It is easier to teach a
prejudice than to urge fairness. It is
easier to beat a drum or squirt th blood of
a black cat killed in the dark of the moon
on a sick man than it is to use the micro
scope and the test tube in studying him
with the result perhaps of changing the
water supply for his neighbors to keep
them from the same illness.
"It is easier to pull down the sliades to
new and disquieting light than to face it
unafraid."
President Wilbur, in developing his sub
ject, "Blinders," said that "our eyes are
directed backward more than forward in
much of the educational process which we
use to train men and women for the days
ahead.
No Change in Bodies
"Our records are crowded with much
human experience, and we know a great
deal about ourselves and the world. It
seems clear that man's body is pretty
much that of many centurics ago.
"While we live longer, have fewer epi
demics and less days of illness, no one
would seriously claim that Nurmi could
run better than some of the Marathon
runners of Greece, or that John L. Sulli
van or Jack Dempsey had finer bodies than
Samson or Goliath or some of the gladi
ators of Rome.
"There is no evidence that the quality
of man's mind has improved in spite of
centuries of training. Solomon, Solon,
Hippocratcs, Leonardo da Vinci, Pascal,
Shakespeare, Lincoln, would be hard for
us to match even in these days of hun
dreds of universities.
Christ's Code Is Best
"Great moral teachers developed under
living conditions which would affront a
modern sheepherder. Confucius pictured
man's relationship to his neighbor in a
way that has been an ideal for hundreds
of millions. Christ knew the heart and
spirit of man and in his short life built a
code of living on the basis laid down by
the Jews which is perfect in its relation
ship to love, happiness and human co
operation.
"Man's body, man's mind, man's moral
conceptions, show no greater capacities
than in the past centuries of which we
have knowledge. The fundamental ele
ments in man's environment have not
changed, and yet he has so changed this
environment that we. have a new world.
"Man is man because he has learned to
use his brain in guiding his body in strug
gling against his enemies and in conquer
ing many of the forces in his surround
ings. He has advanced by using experi
ence and the experimental method as his
two great tools. His couriosity, his un
quenchable fighting qualities, his coopera
tive spirit, combined with the use of
thought, have given him such success as
is his.
Courage Is Necessary
"Above all there have always been dar
ing men who could and would not be
baffled by the unknown. They were de
termined to explore unknown lands and
were willing to try and be beaten and yet
unknown domains open only to those who
never fail to keep on trying. Electricity
has always been in the world. All our dis
coverers and inventors have done is to ar
range metal, rubber, cloth, the flow of
water from a height, in such a way as to
permit it to follow the unchangeable laws
controlling its action.
"Caesar could have seen the fractured
bones of his soldiers just as readily as our
army surgeons'did in France had someone
worked out a proper mechanical contriv
ance to send the Roentgen rays through
the body.
"There is undoubtedly a host of con
cealed facts just as significant as those
now known, and we are certainly piling up
fact on fact in the last two generations
in a way which shows that man's advance
has come from learning to understand and
control an environment which has been
his all of the time.
Observation Is Important
"lust as the telescoped forced upon him
the idea of a universe orderly and yet in
finite, so has the microscope brought into
vision his minute living enemies capable
of destroying his unseen. A few observa
tions through the telescope, a look at the
past records, and a few dark scratches on
a piece of paper, made by the right man,
permits us all to know the exact second
when one big round ball will get in be
tween us and a still larger one and cause
what we call an eclipse. Some one brings

"Individuals have value insofar as they

way the old have for bringing up the

"There is no evidence that the quality

as important to know where the limita

know all is to forgive all,' makes a good
approach to your neighbor's problem, par

"In spite of research work and much
honest thinking we blunder because of pre
conceptions and partial knowledge. The
horizon is still dim and confused. We are
getting a clearer vision as we get clearer
lenses to see through and more willing

vision. The experimental method has
revolutionized man's environment and
combined with reason and freedom of
thought will still further mould and
change it. These changes cannot make
the body or mind of man of better fiber,

baffled by the unknown. They were de
termined to explore unknown lands and
were willing to try and be beaten and yet
unknown domains open only to those who
never fail to keep on trying. Electricity
has always been in the world. All our dis
coverers and inventors have done is to ar
range metal, rubber, cloth, the flow of
water from a height, in such a way as to
permit it to follow the unchangeable laws
controlling its action.
"Caesar could have seen the fractured
bones of his soldiers just as readily as our
army surgeons'did in France had someone
worked out a proper mechanical contriv
ance to send the Roentgen rays through
the body.
"There is undoubtedly a host of con
cealed facts just as significant as those
now known, and we are certainly piling up
fact on fact in the last two generations
in a way which shows that man's advance
has come from learning to understand and
control an environment which has been
his all of the time.
Observation Is Important
"lust as the telescoped forced upon him
the idea of a universe orderly and yet in
finite, so has the microscope brought into
vision his minute living enemies capable
of destroying his unseen. A few observa
tions through the telescope, a look at the
past records, and a few dark scratches on
a piece of paper, made by the right man,
permits us all to know the exact second
when one big round ball will get in be
tween us and a still larger one and cause
what we call an eclipse. Some one brings
together substances always available, and
in that process we have the explosion of
dynamite. Another brings an electric
spark into contact with gasoline in a con
trivance with wings and we fly around
"It is a marvelous story, this use of
this sphere.
man's mind to reveal his environment, this
mastery by him of forcesâ€”and apparently
it is just begun. Will it go forward or
will the savage again have his day? Our
years of enlightenment have been but few,
our years of savagery many. Each of us
is a blend in different measure of deep

seated emotions, fears, prejudices, coming
out of the past. . . .
Know Facts First
"If there was any real object in giving
you a university education it was to make
it possible for you to know something of
facts and their significance, of forces and
their inevitable consequences, of our or
derly universe with its dependable rules.
"There is no good way to dodge the
truth. In meeting facts it is well to keep
in mind the warning of the darky about
mules, 'When I has any thing to say to a
mule I sez it to his face.'
"To meet facts square on without blind
ers is a sign of education. It is equally
as important to know where the limita
tions of our senses begin, and to recognize
the differences of approach due to heredity
and upbringing. The old proverb, 'To
know all is to forgive all,' makes a good
approach to your neighbor's problem, par
ticularly if religion or spots of pigment
in the skin separate you.
"In spite of research work and much
honest thinking we blunder because of pre
conceptions and partial knowledge. The
horizon is still dim and confused. We are
getting a clearer vision as we get clearer
lenses to see through and more willing
ness to look at everything in our field of
vision. The experimental method has
revolutionized man's environment and
combined with reason and freedom of
thought will still further mould and
change it. These changes cannot make
the body or mind of man of better fiber,
but they can by changing his morals and
religion make him a prey to his own
achievement just as they can set him free
from savagry and its accompaniments if
he is willing to lift himself out of the
morass and accept the guidance of truth.
Society Is Complex
"Individuals have value insofar as they
see clearly. When they fall back on pre
judices they join the crowd. Our social
structure is becoming more and more com
plex. It needs those who know what is
known to be the guides. It needs, too,
those who are trying to know more. Too
many, confused by the intricacies of the
new knowledge, want to turn back to the
apparent security of the past. There is no
turning back, except to failure, and lead
ership is forced on university trained men
and women. Russia shows that they can
not be spared.
"You now join with those already in the
game of life. You will fit into all sorts of
places in this stream of human living.
You will add your part either in pulling

or holding hack, or merely sliding along.
What you add will be iticreased if you can
keep off the blinders and fight ignorance
and all of its progeny.
"You can hardly fail to maintain a high
level of service, character and moral
force. Stanford has given you the chance
to see what they mean. Respect tlie old
when it lias proven itself. You cannot
hope to defy human experience. The
rules you violate will get you as they get
those who met them before.
"The young man who learns by obser
vation of the fool who is learning by ex
perience things known for centuries, gets
farthest ahead. You need no one to tell
you the things that are wrong. You
learned that years ago.
"Our student self-government shows us
that the real problem is to know what is
wise and to have emotional control enough
through reason to do it. Your satisfac
tions will come from what you do, not
from what you plan to do. Your dreams
can be made realities by work and more
work, and knowing how and where to
work is this university's greatest contri
bution to your welfare."
