# CELLAR OPEN LAST TIME TONIGHT; TO CLOSE FOR SUMMER
## 
### 
The Cellar, Stanford's famous under
ground soda-fountain, will be open to
night for the last time until the fall
quarter. Although originally scheduled
to close last night, the management
decided to have it remain open in hon
or of the first social function of the
summer quarter, the Registration
dance which will be given in the
Women's Clubhouse tonight.
Since its establishment two years
ago the Cellar has become a ren
dezvous for Stanford men and women,
and has increased its patronage many
fold, especially during the past year.
Cross-word puzzle contests, special
sundaes and drinks in honor of Stan
ford's star athletes and other features
have raised the Cellar's status from a
mere soda-fountain to that of a Uni
versity institution.
