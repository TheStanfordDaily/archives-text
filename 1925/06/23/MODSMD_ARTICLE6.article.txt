# PLAY TRYOUTS START TOMORROW IN ASSEMBLY HALL
## 
### 
Tryouts for two of the plays to be
given this summer will start tomorrow
afternoon in the Assembly Hall, under
the direction of Gordon Davis. The
plays for which casts will be picked
this week are "Hell Bent fer Heaven,"
to be presented 011 July 10, and "Dear
Brutus," scheduled for July 31.
Tryouts will be held from three to
five in the afternoon and from seven
thirty to ten in the evening, tomorrow
and Thursday. Both casts are large,
and everyone interested in dramatics
is urged to come out.
"Hell Bent fer Heaven," by Hatcher
Hughes, is a stirring melodrama of
the North Carolina mountain folk,
which is still creating a sensation in
New York. Gordon Davis was for
tunate enough to secure the rights to
a Stanford production during his re
cent trip East, and this will be its
first appearance on the Pacific Coast.
"Dear Brutus," by Sir James Barrie,
is one of the famous Englishman's
most popular plays, and is a fantasy
which will be an excellent contrast
to "Hell Bent fer Heaven."
The Summer Season of 1924 was
unusually successful, and drew audi
ences which were larger than many of
those during the regular college year.
The season this summer will offer
three types of plays which should
please everyone who is interested in
dramatics. After the production of
"Hell Bent fer Heaven" and "Dear
Brutus," the final play will be "Aga
memnon," which will be presented on
the steps of the Stanford Museum.
"Oedipus Rex," the Greek play which
ended the summer season last year,
drew an enthusiastic audience of over
two thousand people, and created an
impression that has brought the name
of Stanford dramatics up to a very
high level.
Rehearsals will start immediately
for "Hell Bent fer Heaven" and the
cast of "Dear Brutus" will begin actual
work in a week, giving them time to
learn the lines.
The names of successful tryoutees
will be posted as usual outside the
Green Room in the English building.
Those who are unable to attend the
first tryouts tomorrow afternoon or
evening will have an opportunity to
try for one of the two casts at the
second tryouts on Thujrsday after
noon and evening.
Those who do not make either of
the casts are requested to try out for
the Greek play, "Agamemnon."
