### T. E. Connolly 
When President Wilbur granted de
grees to over eight hundred candi
dates in Memorial Church yesterday,
Senior Week was officially over. Since
last Wednesday night wearers of the
"mortar boards" have been engaged in
a continual round of festivities which
ended their careers as students in
Stanford University.
Wednesday night the Senior Farce,
"Polly With a Past" was presented to
the largest audience on record. It
was an excellent production, due to
the energetic work of Charles Parks,
who casted, directed, and played a
heavy role, and to Gordon Davis, who
returned from the East In time for
the last week of rehearsals.
Thursday evening the Senior men's
and women's dinners given by the
Executive Committee of the Alumni
Association were held in the Stanford
Union. Immediately following the
dinners the annual Senior Promenade
took place in the Union courtyard.
Colored lights played upon the court
and fountain made a picturesque set
ting for this farewell function of the
graduating class. After the prome
nade, a program was given, and a
dance was tendered the seniors by the
Women's Clubhouse Board.
Friday morning the Class Day exer
cises were held in Memorial Church,
followed by the laying of the 1925
Class plate. The Class of 1925 also
presented to the University a drink
ing fountain which is being erected
on a corner of the inner Quad.
In the afternoon. President and Mrs.
Wilbur gave their annual reception
to the graduates and their families at
the President's house.
Senior Ball Friday
Friday night was the occasion of
the Senior Ball, and under the chair
manship of Lafe Brown it was one of
the most successful dances in recent
years. A myriad of ferns and flowers
from the West Coast Nurseries pro
vided a beautiful background for the
excellent lighting effects conceived by
Hume West. Breakfast was served in
Encina Dining Hall when the dance
ended at three o'clock Saturday morn
ing.
Phi Beta Kappa held their annual
open meeting Saturday morning, and
gave a reception in the evening to its
initiates and their friends.
Sunday morning the seniors
marched in a body to Memorial
Church, where Dr. Rufus M. Jones
delivered the baccalaureate sermon.
In the afternoon members of the fac
ulty were at home to students and
their families.
Yesterday Stanford's thirty-fourth
annual commencement was held in
Memorial Church, before an audience
which completely filled every avail
able bit of space in the building.
President Wilbur delivered the Com
mencement address, and conferred the
degrees. An unscheduled surprise oc
curred when Herbert Hoover, Stan
ford's most distinguished graduate,
gave a short talk to the outgoing
class. Although it was known that he
was here to see his son Herbert
Hoover Junior, receive his degree, it
was not anticipated that he would
talk.
Dr. D. Charles Gardner offered the
benediction, and another Stanford
class was officially through with their
University work.
