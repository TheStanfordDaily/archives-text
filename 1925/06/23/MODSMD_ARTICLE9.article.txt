# Summer
## 
### 
Another summer quarter lias started, the
eighth to be exact, and advance reports
indicate that the enrollment will be larger
than ever before.
And this is as it should be. The sum
mer quarter at Stanford has in the past
been on a par with, and sometimes even
better, than the so-called "regular" quar
ters of the college year. The weather is
always ideal, there are fewer distractions
to keep one from hitting the books with
regularity, and yet there is enough doing
to make it far from dull. Hikes and auto
trips are sponsored by the University;
Gordon Davis presents a series of excel
lent plays; Warren D. Allen gives two
organ recitals a week; and there are lec
tures and entertainments provided by the
director for those who enjoy that sort of
thing.
To those of you who are registering at
Stanford for the first time, the Daily
Palo Alto extends a hearty welcome, and
to those others who are not strangers in
our midst, we give the regular Stanford
greeting, "Hello!"

THE DAILY PALO ALTO WILL be
published at least once a week, on Thurs
days, with several special editions to be
announced later. There are several repor
torial positions open at the present time,
owing to the fact that few of the regular
staff members are registered this quarter.
Any who are intreested in journalistic
work are invited to report at the Daily
office or to the editor in person any time
this week.

AS USUAL, COMMUNICATIONS
from students or faculty members will be
printed in the Daily Pai.o Alto. Of nec
essity, because of the smaller edition dur
ing the summer quarter, they must not be
too long, but if you have anything you
want to speak your mind on, whether it be
praise or blame, the columns of this paper
are open to you.

STANFORD IS FORTUNATE in
having a musician of the caliber of War
ren D. Allen as its University organist.
Mr. Allen lias attained a wide reputation
for his musicianship, and the weekly re
citals which he gives in the Memorial
Church are always well attended.
If you like music of the very highest
order, attend the recitals, and if you want
to meet a "regular" fellow, go up to the
choir loft afterwards and get acquainted
with Mr. Allen.

GORDON DAVIS IS SELECTING
two casts for plays to be produced this
summer. "Hell Bent fer Heaven" will bg
presented on July 10, with "Dear Brutus"
following it on July 31.
Dramatics at Stanford has established
a reputation that is seldom found in con
nection with college efforts along that
line, and most of the credit can be traced
directly to Gordon Davis. By a wise
choice of plays and excellent casting,
Davis has scored heavily with every pro
duction in the last two years. Trying out
for a play will not only be a lot of fun,
hut if you are lucky enough to make one
of the casts it will be excellent training.

Another summer quarter lias started, the
eighth to be exact, and advance reports
indicate that the enrollment will be larger
than ever before.
And this is as it should be. The sum
mer quarter at Stanford has in the past
been on a par with, and sometimes even
better, than the so-called "regular" quar
ters of the college year. The weather is
always ideal, there are fewer distractions
to keep one from hitting the books with
regularity, and yet there is enough doing
to make it far from dull. Hikes and auto
trips are sponsored by the University;
Gordon Davis presents a series of excel
lent plays; Warren D. Allen gives two
organ recitals a week; and there are lec
tures and entertainments provided by the
director for those who enjoy that sort of
thing.
To those of you who are registering at
Stanford for the first time, the Daily
Palo Alto extends a hearty welcome, and
to those others who are not strangers in
our midst, we give the regular Stanford
greeting, "Hello!"

THE DAILY PALO ALTO WILL be
published at least once a week, on Thurs
days, with several special editions to be
announced later. There are several repor
torial positions open at the present time,
owing to the fact that few of the regular
staff members are registered this quarter.
Any who are intreested in journalistic
work are invited to report at the Daily
office or to the editor in person any time
this week.

AS USUAL, COMMUNICATIONS
from students or faculty members will be
printed in the Daily Pai.o Alto. Of nec
essity, because of the smaller edition dur
ing the summer quarter, they must not be
too long, but if you have anything you
want to speak your mind on, whether it be
praise or blame, the columns of this paper
are open to you.

STANFORD IS FORTUNATE in
having a musician of the caliber of War
ren D. Allen as its University organist.
Mr. Allen lias attained a wide reputation
for his musicianship, and the weekly re
citals which he gives in the Memorial
Church are always well attended.
If you like music of the very highest
order, attend the recitals, and if you want
to meet a "regular" fellow, go up to the
choir loft afterwards and get acquainted
with Mr. Allen.

GORDON DAVIS IS SELECTING
two casts for plays to be produced this
summer. "Hell Bent fer Heaven" will bg
presented on July 10, with "Dear Brutus"
following it on July 31.
Dramatics at Stanford has established
a reputation that is seldom found in con
nection with college efforts along that
line, and most of the credit can be traced
directly to Gordon Davis. By a wise
choice of plays and excellent casting,
Davis has scored heavily with every pro
duction in the last two years. Trying out
for a play will not only be a lot of fun,
hut if you are lucky enough to make one
of the casts it will be excellent training.
