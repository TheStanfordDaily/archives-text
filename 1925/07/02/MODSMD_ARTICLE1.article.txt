# INDEPEDENT STUDY PLAN FOR SUPERIOR STUDENTS ADOPTED
## 
### 
By an action of the Academic Coun
cil on June 15, beginning next year
Junior and Senior students who are
especially qualified will be given the
"run" of the university. Classroom
attendance will be optional, and aside
from conferences and reports ad
visory professors, and a final examina
tion, no restraint is placed on the
methods which any student may adopt
in pursuing his studies.
This "Independent Study" plan is
the outgrowth of much discussion re
garding the exceptionally gifted stu
dent being held back by his more or
less dull fellow-students. Under the
new plan, Junior or Senior students
whose work is B grade or above, may,
subject to the approval of his major
department, enroll under the Indepen
dent Study Plan, and receive univer
sity credit for original and self
directed study.
The salient features of the new plan
are as follows:
"Any student whose University rec
ord is of a 'B' average or above, or
who is deemed by his school or de
partment as specially qualified may,
with the consent of the school or de
partment, enroll under the Indepen
dent Study Plan at the beginning of
the junior year, or at the beginning
of any quarter thereafter. The plan
of study shall be arranged with the
intention of providing a program of
work both more comprehensive and
more intensive than that of the aver
age student, calling for greater initia
tive, more self-direction, a higher type
of thinking, and leading to a compre
hensive final examination or examina
tions. Some faculty member of the
school or department shall be the spe
cial adviser of the student. The stu
dent shall be checked up in his work
through reports, theses, discussions,
and conferences with the adviser, or,
and to the extent that may be deter
mined, through meeting the regular
tests in particular courses. The degree
credit for the period of study under
the Independent Study Plan shall be
determined and awarded on the basis
of the final examination or examina
tions."
