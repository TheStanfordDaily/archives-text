# T. J. HOOVER HEADS NEW ENGINEERING SCHOOL NEXT YEAR
## 
### 
A new School of Engineering, with
Professor Theodore J. Hoover as Dean,
will begin functioning at the opening
of the college year next October. A
four year undergraduate course in all
branches of engineering will prepare
students for a two year post-graduate
course leading to the professional de
gree of Engineer.
The organization of the School of
Engineering is the outcome of a series
of studies, and follows closely the
recommendations of a committee of
seven, representing the present de
partments of engineering in the Uni
versity. The decision for a broad
undergraduate course and specialized
professional post-graduate training is
based on the conviction that for his
most effective usefulness the engineer
needs not only the technical equip
ment for his specialized profession,
but a broad foundation of a liberal
education. This idea is in line, also,
with the University's requirement that
all students in the Lower Division,
which includes the first two years of
their course, shall have a spread of
subjects of study that brings them
into contact with the chief branches
of knowledge. The students in the
school of engineering will meet all
these Lower Division requirements.
Stresses Professional Training
The organization of the school will
also facilitate the transfer of students
from the increasing number of junior
colleges for the two upperclass years
in the university, without loss of time
in preparation for their professional
careers, and the concentration of the
bulk of the specialized engineering
work in the graduate school will en
able graduates of other colleges to
gain their professional training there.
One of the reasons impelling the
Stanford authorities to place all the
courses for a professional engineering
degree on a six-year basis is that not
only are engineers more and more
called on for participation in general
public affairs which call for education
covering a broad field, but that there
is a growing need within the profes
sion itself for men equipped for a
wide variety of executive and mana
gerial activities which demand more
than the strictly technical knowledge
of their profession.
