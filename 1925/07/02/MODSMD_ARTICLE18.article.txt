# Traditions
## 
### 
It seems necessary every summer
for the Daily Palo Alto to call atten
tion to the fact that many traditions
which are a part of Stanford Univer
sity are not being observed by the sum
mer quarter students.
This may be, and probably is, be
cause those who are here for the first
time do not know just what these tra
ditions are. During the other three
quarters of the college year there are
practically 110 violations of the two
outstanding traditions connected with
the Quad, traditions which have been
broken several times this quarter.
They are as follows:
1. Stanford men do not smoke on
the quad.
2. Stanford women do not walk
down the law steps.
The smoking tradition applies to
every section of the Quad, which
means the buildings bounded by the
Engineering, English, Physics, and
Geology corners. The law steps are lo
cated at the end of the walk which
passes the law school, and can be
recognized by the iron plate at the
foot.
On behalf of the student body the
Daily Palo Alto urges that those regis
tered at Stanford for the first time
observe these traditions which we like
to think of as being an integral part of
Stanford University.
