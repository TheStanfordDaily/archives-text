# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT

The Cellar is closed! When it is
most needed, this underground soda
fountain ceases operations. If a stu
dent is hot and thirsty, there are at
least four drinking places on the cam
pus. At these he can refresh himself,
and project his imagination in an at
tempt to make luke-warm water taste ;
like a fresh strawberry sundae. It is ■
true that one fountain has a slightly !
oily taste, and that a second gasps fit
fully and produces no water. But what
of it? Beggars—and Stanford students
—cannot be choosers.
During this quarter the Cellar, more
important now than at any other time,
is closed. To those fortunate ones who
are "never hot" and "never hungry
between meals" this fact is of no inter
est. To the rest of us there comes a
great thirst, an undying thirst, and an
unsatisfied longing.
Is Sticky's shut down in warm
weather for lack of business? Well,
rather not! There is a demand for
cold things that depletes the supply
daily.
The only logical reason we see for
closing the Cellar is the fear of finan
cial loss, and the large enrollment this
summer insures patronage.
We want the Cellar opened. —XYZ.

pictures of all important collegiate
events of the year. A review is then
held at the commencement exercises.
