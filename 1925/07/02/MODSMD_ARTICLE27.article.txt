# HOPKINS MARINE STATION RECEIVES $50,000 ENDOWMENT
## 
### 
The Hopkins Marine Station of
Stanford University, at Pacific Grove,
has received a $50,000 addition to its
endowment from the Rockefeller
Foundation for the enlargement of its
building equipment and work. This
gift, according to President Ray
Lyman Wilbur, who announced it yes
terday, wfll not only promote the
science of marine biology and general
physiology, but will furnish a very
practical aid in the protection and
development of the important sea
food resources of the Pacific Coast.
The Hopkins Marine Station of
Stanford ranks as a center of study
of ocean life with that of Naples in
Raly and Wood's Holl on the Massa
chusetts shore of the Atlantic. The
protection of the sea food supplies
depends upon knowledge not only of
the fishes, bivalves and crustaceans
which furnish human food, but also
of the sources of food supply for these
fishes. At the Hopkins Station re
search work is carried on in both
these branches. Stanford scientists for
several years have been carrying on
investigations there and elsewhere of
salmon, clams and other important
sea foods with a view to checking the
serious depletion that is taking place.
The Rockefeller Foundation gift
will be used to erect a second labora
tory building at Pacific Grove and to

purchase much needed equipment. The
present station Is named in honor of
Timothy Hopkins, who has been a
member of the Board of Trustees of
the University since its opening, and
who was the donor of the original
plot and wooden buildings which con
stituted the station in the early years

The Daily Trojan of the University
of Southern California predicts that
pink trousers and brown coats from
Paris may be worn by college students
of that University next year.
