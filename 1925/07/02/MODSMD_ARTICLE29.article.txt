## "Dodson's Hints on Musical Hits" 
### 
All Summer Quarter students are
cordially invited to make our store
downtown headquarters. For some
years now we have been supplying the
musical wants of Stanfordites and it
has been one of the most pleasant
sides of our business.
In this column we hope you will find
a fairly reliable guide to new develop
ments in music and, particularly, to
the newest and best in dance records.
Among those holding the spotlight
today:
"Collegiate," played by Waring's
Pennsylvanians, still leads the list of
best sellers, and deservedly so.
Paul Whiteman has at last recorded
"Ukelele Lady." It contains many
characteristic Whiteman touches — a
vocal chorus, for instance, led by a
man who booms "If you like a ukelele
lady, a ukelele lady lika you" in the
deepest bass voice you have ever
heard. On first blush the record is a
disappointment but the more you listen
to it the better you'll like it.
Art Landry, who recently appeared
at the New Stanford theatre, plays his
own composition, "It'll Get You," with
all the pep ten inches of pressed rub
ber disk could possibly contain.
P. S. The ideal phonograph for
summer is the new, sturdy, portable
little Victrola which sells for only $15!
It's the most inexpensive phonograph
the Victor people have ever made but
its quality warrants the Victor trade
mark.
