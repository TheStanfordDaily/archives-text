# Registration Breaks Previous Records
## 
### 
Registration figures for the summer
quarter have reached a total of 1128
students, the largest number to attend a
summer quarter at Stanford. The next
highest figure was in 1921 when 1068
students were registered.
Of those registered, seven hundred are
graduates or former Stanford students,
while the rest are here for the first
time.
