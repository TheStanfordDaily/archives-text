# WORK ON STADIUM NEARS COMPLETION; ADDS 10,000 SEATS
## Ventilation Tunnels to Be Used as Entrances; Ball Diamond Planned 
### 
Over half of the sixty feet required
to bring the new addition to the Stan
lord Stadium on a level with the rest
of the bowl has been filled in. The
work on the east end of the stadium
is progressing rapidly and will be com
pleted for the 1926 Big Game.

Two ventilation tunnels have just
been completed in the new end. These
tunnels will also be used as entrances
by the crowds sitting in this section.
The 220-yard straightaway is not to be
covered. Two team houses will be
erected on the southern side. A road
is being constructed along this slope
to permit autos to go upon the field.

The addition will increase the seat
ing capacity by 10,000 and will place
Stanford's stadium on a par with Cali
fornia's. The earth used for this addi
tion is being taken from the site of
the new baseball diamond directly east
of the stadium. At present the work is
chiefly that of filling the cavity with
earth, but as soon as the required
height is reached it will be graded and
the temporary wooden seats con
structed.
