# "HELL-BENT FER HEAVEN" CAST READY FOR CURTAIN
## Gordon Davis Has Lead In Stirring Drama of Northern Carolina Mountaineers 
### Andrew Boone 
Â«lIELL-BENT FER HEAVEN," Hatcher Hughes' prize-winning Pulitzer play
of 1923, will make its bow to a Pacific Coast audience for the first time on
the Assembly Hall stage tomorrow night, with Gordon Davis, Stanford dramatic
director, playing the part of Rufe Pryor, male lead.
The play will be the most daring, in some respects, Stanford students will

have attempted. The characters speak rather plainly on certain phases of
general religious subjects.
In preparation, the theatrical assistants have procured from San Francisco
machinery to produce a rainstorm, a dam-break, and five tones of thunder.
The mountain cabin, in which the action takes place, has been built Bolidly

on the Assembly Hall stage; no canvas'
drops, but solid wood.
Davis went to New York during the
spring to select summer quarter plays
and through a fortuitous combination
of circumstances, secured "Hell-Bent
fer Heaven" as the first.
Davis, as Rufe Pryor, a mountain
half-wit, is a character who demands
plenty of sympathy from the audience.
He has his own decided religious
views, wrong coming from v anyone
else, yet correct coming from himself.
He expounds them at length in no un
certain words.
June Clemmons, as Meg Hunt, a
mountain girl, is a lovely character,
who should elicit plenty of admiration
from the hearers.
The cast is as follows:
David Hunt Leonard Bowman
Meg Hunt June Clemmons
Sid Hunt Wayne Newcomb
Rufe Pryor Gordon A. Davis
Matt Hunt Guy Holliday
Andy Lowery Phil Urner
Jude Lowery Marian Henshall
Following the play a dance will be
held in the Women's Clubhouse, to
which everyone is invited, at 75 cents
a couple.


A dramatic moment iq "Hell-Bent fer Heaven," to be presented in the
Assembly Hall at 8115 tomorrow night. Left to right: June Clemmons,
Guy Holliday, Marian Henshall, Gordon Davis, Leonard Bowman.
