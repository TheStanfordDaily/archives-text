During the other three quarters of
the college year one of the most in
teresting features of the Daily Palo
Alto is the column of allegedly humor
ous material called "Cabbages." In the
summertime, however, cabbages seem
hardly appropriate, so we are offering
today for your approval our weekly
"comic strip" which we have called
"Summer Squash." The conductor is
an oldtimer at the game of laughter,
his latest crime being the Razz Sec
tion of the 1926 Quad.
Mr. A. Grove Day, chief perpetrator
of "Summer Squash," will be glad to
receive contributions for his column,
which may be sent to him in care of
the Daily Palo Alto.
