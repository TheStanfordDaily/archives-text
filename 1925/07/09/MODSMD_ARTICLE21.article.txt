# Look Out!

Several automobiles have been
stripped of all detachable parts in the
last few days, and a warning has been
issued by Fred Frehe, University proc
tor, advising motorists to be careful
where they leave their machines.
Every once in a while sneak thieves
seem to organize for a campaign of
stealing, and the only way to defeat
their purpose is to lock everything up.
If you have to leave your car out all
night, try to put it under some light,
Where the night watchmen will notice
anyone prowling around.
