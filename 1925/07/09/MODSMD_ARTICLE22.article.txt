# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT

How come no flags? Lots and lots of
lovely flagpoles that the flagpole sales
man sold the University many years
ago, and not a single flag up on the
Stanford Campus to celebrate the
Glorious Fourth!
Is there some justification in the
jibes at collegiate communities for
lack of patriotism, or was it just care
lessness on the part of somebody?
Anyway, we think it a bit remiss not
to have one single bit of red-white-and
blue floating in the breeze on the anni
versary of the Declaration of Indepen
dence.—E. J. B.

"The most inspiring entertainment
ever offered to mankind," such are the
words of Mr. DeMille's press agents
in describing the "Ten Command
ments." Although we dislike to differ
with these estimable gentlemen, from
our balcony seat it seemed to be a
very third-rate line of hokum produced
at a decidedly unnecessary expense.
By this we do not mean that the
Egyptian "prolog" (as Mr. DeMJlle
phonetically spells it) is not impres
sive, it is, but even the splendid sets
and the great number of extras can
not save the utter futility of the re
mainder of the plot.
There are some individually fine per
formances, notably those of Charles
Roche as Rameses, Rod Laßoque as
Dan MacTavish, and Robert Edeson
as the Contractor's assistant, but these
are seeds sown on barren ground. As
has been said, the Egyptian prologue
is beautiful and impressive, but the
modern story rarely rises from the
rank of good old-fashioned "meller
drammer." Altogether we would not
advise the weary rough to waste his
portion of father's hard-earned money
in paying the advanced prices neces
sary to see this production. —C. E.
