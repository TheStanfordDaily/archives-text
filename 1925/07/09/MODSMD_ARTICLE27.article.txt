### 
Today we will cast a critical eye
upon the playwrights of the modern
school who believe in calling a spade
a blank-blanked, dirty old muck-stick.
Their creed seems to be that every
d is drama and every his art.
Never before in history has the cuss
word so fully come into its own as in
the modern play.
Let ub take for instance a charming
little scene from the Broadway suc
cess, "What Price Profanity?," where
in two boon companions, Sergeant
O'Elle and Private "Cuss" McSwear
are passing compliments back and
forth.
O'Elle—What d'ye mean by that, you
■ lying dog?
McSwear (throwing rocks) —D
you, you top-sergeant!
O'Elle (knocking him down) —You
d liar! You subcretaceous amoeba!
McSwear (shoots him) —There, you
• you!
O'Elle (getting angry)—So's your
brother!
McSwear —D , h !
O'Elle— H , d !
And so it goes. Note the tremendous
power of the non-profane words as con
trasted with the main vernacular of
this truly moving asparagus-casting
tournament.
Or take another example, the suc
cessful mountain drama, "Dash Blank
fer Asterisk." In the following scene
the question of religion has come up
in the course of family conversation:
Grandpap—Don't you go a-sayin' I
haint no C n! I'm just as holy
as you, you you!
Pap—Why you old
Methodist, you!
Mammy—Now, boy 6, that hain't the
way ter pass the time, when them ther
■ revenuers air a-comin'!
Where's that brat, Bud?
Pap—l spose he's out shootin' craps
with the hired man. Th' boy's bound
fer h sure 'nuf!
Bud (entering)— Why you
! You're the sinner what's bound
fer h ! I'm a C n and I'm
a-goin' up to H !
Grandpap—You haint the right brand
of C n, you ———; you'll
never 'tain to H ; the only place
fer sinners like you is h !
All (in unison) —G , C ■ , h !
This new tendency, as we see, is
no doubt very powerful, but it neces
sarily decreases dramatic vocabulary
until someone works out a few new
cusses. > ,

The students of the University ap
pear to be supporting themselves by
taking each other's cleaning and laun
dry.
Today we will cast a critical eye
upon the playwrights of the modern
school who believe in calling a spade
a blank-blanked, dirty old muck-stick.
Their creed seems to be that every
d is drama and every his art.
Never before in history has the cuss
word so fully come into its own as in
the modern play.
Let ub take for instance a charming
little scene from the Broadway suc
cess, "What Price Profanity?," where
in two boon companions, Sergeant
O'Elle and Private "Cuss" McSwear
are passing compliments back and
forth.
O'Elle—What d'ye mean by that, you
■ lying dog?
McSwear (throwing rocks) —D
you, you top-sergeant!
O'Elle (knocking him down) —You
d liar! You subcretaceous amoeba!
McSwear (shoots him) —There, you
• you!
O'Elle (getting angry)—So's your
brother!
McSwear —D , h !
O'Elle— H , d !
And so it goes. Note the tremendous
power of the non-profane words as con
trasted with the main vernacular of
this truly moving asparagus-casting
tournament.
Or take another example, the suc
cessful mountain drama, "Dash Blank
fer Asterisk." In the following scene
the question of religion has come up
in the course of family conversation:
Grandpap—Don't you go a-sayin' I
haint no C n! I'm just as holy
as you, you you!
Pap—Why you old
Methodist, you!
Mammy—Now, boy 6, that hain't the
way ter pass the time, when them ther
■ revenuers air a-comin'!
Where's that brat, Bud?
Pap—l spose he's out shootin' craps
with the hired man. Th' boy's bound
fer h sure 'nuf!
Bud (entering)— Why you
! You're the sinner what's bound
fer h ! I'm a C n and I'm
a-goin' up to H !
Grandpap—You haint the right brand
of C n, you ———; you'll
never 'tain to H ; the only place
fer sinners like you is h !
All (in unison) —G , C ■ , h !
This new tendency, as we see, is
no doubt very powerful, but it neces
sarily decreases dramatic vocabulary
until someone works out a few new
cusses. > ,
