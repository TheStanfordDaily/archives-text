# PAN IN THE LECTURE ROOM
## 
### 
Great Pan one summer day forsakes
the hills
Where graze the herds, and passes
down alone
Unseen to where arcades of yellow
stone
Sprawl in the sunshine that their
shadow chills.
Pan lingers where the peace of sum
mer fills ' •
A drowsy room; he hearkens to the
drone
Of Paedagogus, and the overtone
Of youths and maidens plying thirsty
quills.
"Pan is a myth; the gods are dead
and low;"
Smoothly and glibly drops the
pedant's word.
The goat-god smiles. Even as long ago
From an oasis trills a tinted bird;
The sun gilds every leaf; the blossoms
blow;
And through the, reeds the wind's
low note is heard.
