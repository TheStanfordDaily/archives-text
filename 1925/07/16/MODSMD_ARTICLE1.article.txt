# UNKNOWN PLOTTER ATTEMPTS TO POISON STANFORD JANITORS
## Mess House Waitress Finds Arsenic in Sugar Ready For Evening Meal 
### 
Fingerprints were taken this week
of all the janitors of the campus, in an
effort to And the person who placed
arsenic in the sugar that was to be
served in the workmen's mess-house
last Friday evening. These fingerprints
may have among them some that cor
respond to those on a partially empty
arsenic bottle in the Chemistry depart
ment. The bottle was found, after the
discovery of the poisoned sugar, to
have been tampered with by someone
who was not an expert, as shown by
the careless way in which the arsenic
had been removed. The Palo Alto Po
lice department took the fingerprints,
but has no other connection with the
search for the plotter or plotters.
Ina Adkins, waitress at the mess
hall and wife of Claude Adkins, cook
tor the workmen, made the discovery
of the poison at about 3 o'clock Friday
afternoon. She explained to the officers
that she had filled the sugar-bowls
earlier in the afternoon, and replaced
them on the table. Returning later on
to the dining room, she noticed several
things out of place, and some white
powder on the table. William Hamil
ton, one of the janitors, volunteered
to take the sugar to the Chemistry
department, where it was found to
contain sufficient arsenic to kill at
least 50 men. A later report said that
there was enough of the poison to kill
100.
Any fingerprints that may have been
on the sugar bowls were lost when
the bowls were washed that afternoon,
and refilled for use at the evening
meal. The sheriff was not notified un
til too late to make investigations that
night, but word was sent to him Satur
day morning.

No explanations have been advanced
for the attempt on the janitors' lives.
Whether an outsider placed the poison
in the sugar, or some disgruntled work
man was responsible is not known.
John Brown, forman for the American
Building Maintenance Company, a San
Francisco concern that supplies Stan
ford with janitors on a three-year con
tract, could offer no tentative solution,
■especially since the company makes
every effort to avoid retaining men
who prove offensive. Brown eats at a
table apart from the workmen, and his
sugar had not been touched.
The attempt was the work of an
amateur, according to the investiga
tors, who were sent to the campus by
Sheriff George T. Lyle of San Jose.
The would-be murderer evidently did
not try to mix the poison with the
sugar, or to cover up his traces.
Whether or not the arsenic came
from the bottle in the Chemistry labor
atory has not as yet been ascertained.
Although the evidence seems to be
strong for this explanation, the au
thorities have pointed out that arsenic
is easy to obtain, being one of the few
poisons that are sold freely in drug
stores. It may have come from some
place off the campus, or even outside
of Palo Alto. The sheriff's men say
that if the source of the poison could
he discovered their work would be
much easier in this case. They hope
finally to establish the bottle from the
Chemistry laboratory as a factor, or
definitely to eliminate it from the
search.

them on the table. Returning later on
to the dining room, she noticed several
things out of place, and some white
powder on the table. William Hamil
ton, one of the janitors, volunteered
to take the sugar to the Chemistry
department, where it was found to
contain sufficient arsenic to kill at
least 50 men. A later report said that
there was enough of the poison to kill
100.
Any fingerprints that may have been
on the sugar bowls were lost when
the bowls were washed that afternoon,
and refilled for use at the evening
meal. The sheriff was not notified un
til too late to make investigations that
night, but word was sent to him Satur
day morning.

No explanations have been advanced
for the attempt on the janitors' lives.
Whether an outsider placed the poison
in the sugar, or some disgruntled work
man was responsible is not known.
John Brown, forman for the American
Building Maintenance Company, a San
Francisco concern that supplies Stan
ford with janitors on a three-year con
tract, could offer no tentative solution,
■especially since the company makes
every effort to avoid retaining men
who prove offensive. Brown eats at a
table apart from the workmen, and his
sugar had not been touched.
The attempt was the work of an
amateur, according to the investiga
tors, who were sent to the campus by
Sheriff George T. Lyle of San Jose.
The would-be murderer evidently did
not try to mix the poison with the
sugar, or to cover up his traces.
Whether or not the arsenic came
from the bottle in the Chemistry labor
atory has not as yet been ascertained.
Although the evidence seems to be
strong for this explanation, the au
thorities have pointed out that arsenic
is easy to obtain, being one of the few
poisons that are sold freely in drug
stores. It may have come from some
place off the campus, or even outside
of Palo Alto. The sheriff's men say
that if the source of the poison could
he discovered their work would be
much easier in this case. They hope
finally to establish the bottle from the
Chemistry laboratory as a factor, or
definitely to eliminate it from the
search.
Fingerprints were taken this week
of all the janitors of the campus, in an
effort to And the person who placed
arsenic in the sugar that was to be
served in the workmen's mess-house
last Friday evening. These fingerprints
may have among them some that cor
respond to those on a partially empty
arsenic bottle in the Chemistry depart
ment. The bottle was found, after the
discovery of the poisoned sugar, to
have been tampered with by someone
who was not an expert, as shown by
the careless way in which the arsenic
had been removed. The Palo Alto Po
lice department took the fingerprints,
but has no other connection with the
search for the plotter or plotters.
Ina Adkins, waitress at the mess
hall and wife of Claude Adkins, cook
tor the workmen, made the discovery
of the poison at about 3 o'clock Friday
afternoon. She explained to the officers
that she had filled the sugar-bowls
earlier in the afternoon, and replaced
them on the table. Returning later on
