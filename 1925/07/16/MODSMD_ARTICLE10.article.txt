# DIVING EXHIBITION AT GYM TOMORROW
## 
### 
A1 White, Dave Fall, and Pete Des
Jardines, three of the foremost divers
in the world, will appear in a series
of exhibition events In Encina Gymna
sium Pool tomorrow afternoon at 5
o'clock.
White, who has been developed by
Ernst Brandsten, Cardinal aquatic
coach, is the holder of the Olympic
Games title in both the high fancy
and springboard events. He has also
been the national champion in the
high and low springboard since 1922.
Fall, also a pupil of Brandsten's, has
come to the front recently. He finished
a close second to White in the high
fancy diving at the Olympic Games
and has given his teammate close
races on other occasions. Des Jardines
hails from Florida and is considered
one of the best divers in the East. He
took second to White in the spring
board diving at the Games.
In addition to the diving, there will
be several swimming exhibitions. Ar
den Allen, captain-elect of the 1925-26
Stanford varsity swimming team, will
swim the gruelling medley race â€”a
combination of breast-stroke, back
stroke, and free-style. Carl Stevenson
will swim 220 yards.
The exhibitions will offer local swim
ming fans their last opportunity to see
these men in action before they leave
for Seattle to take part in the National
Championships. Admission will be free.
