# DAVIS MAKES HIT IN CAMPUS PRODUCTION OF CAROLINA DRAMA
## Reviewer Finds it Difficult to Criticize Play by Hatcher Hughes 
### Stanley A. weigel 
Mr. Charles Simons,
Editor, the Daily Palo Alto.
Dear Charlie:
It has long been a cherished dream
of mine to become a dramatic critic.
Very kindly you gave me an oppor
tunity for practice by inviting me to
review "Hell-Bent Fer Heaven." And
I've failed down on the job, miserably.
The first, requisite of a satisfactory
review (as it would appear from the
work of the nation's foremost critics)
is to say mean, supercilious, cynical,
biting things, and say them often.
Frankly, Charlie, I'm stumped. The
most biting criticism I can think to
write of "Hell-Bent Fer Heaven" is
that Grandfather David's make-up re
minded me of Santa Claus.
My review follows. I apologize for it,
sincerely. Please ship my remains to
George Jean Nathan and H. L.
Mencken.
Regretfully yours,
Stanley A. Weigel.
"Hell-Bent Fer Heaven," Hatcher
Hughes' 1923 Pulitzer prize play, had
its Pacific Coast premier last Friday

pretentious and effective ever seen on
the Stanford stage. A specially con

to forget the balmy summer night out
side. Howling winds made window cur
tains fly and children shudder. The
roar of a flood chilled spectators al
most as much as it was supposed to
have chilled the actor caught in it.
Some fifty well-executed off'stage cues
brought professional realism to the
Carolina thunder storm. All these
things transpired back of Les Kiler's
very effective log cabin setting.
Out in front there played as capable
and well-rounded a cast as Hatcher
Hughes or George M. Cohan could ask
for. Gordon Davis—well, he deserves
two paragraphs all his own.
First of all, there was Gordon Davis
—Actor. Always a favorite on the
Stanford stage, he probably has never
been more Varmly received. Playing
the difficult part of Rufe Pryor, reli
gious fanatic, Davis made the most of
its humor possibilities. Yet his Rufe
Fryor was just what the author had in
mind —a bitterly tragic, pitifully hu
morous, deadly serious, hatefully
scheming religious crank. And if the
audience liked Rufe Pryor where they
j should have hated him, it was only
because Gordon Davis was too dear to
