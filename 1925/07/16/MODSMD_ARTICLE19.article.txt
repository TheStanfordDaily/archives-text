# DAVIS MAKES HIT IN CAMPUS PRODUCTION OF CAROLINA DRAMA
## Reviewer Finds it Difficult to Criticize Play by Hatcher Hughes 
### Stanley A. weigel 
Mr. Charles Simons,
Editor, the Daily Palo Alto.
Dear Charlie:
It has long been a cherished dream
of mine to become a dramatic critic.
Very kindly you gave me an oppor
tunity for practice by inviting me to
review "Hell-Bent Fer Heaven." And
I've failed down on the job, miserably.
The first, requisite of a satisfactory
review (as it would appear from the
work of the nation's foremost critics)
is to say mean, supercilious, cynical,
biting things, and say them often.
Frankly, Charlie, I'm stumped. The
most biting criticism I can think to
write of "Hell-Bent Fer Heaven" is
that Grandfather David's make-up re
minded me of Santa Claus.
My review follows. I apologize for it,
sincerely. Please ship my remains to
George Jean Nathan and H. L.
Mencken.
Regretfully yours,
Stanley A. Weigel.
"Hell-Bent Fer Heaven," Hatcher
Hughes' 1923 Pulitzer prize play, had
its Pacific Coast premier last Friday
night in the Stanford Assembly Hnll
before an audience of over a thousand
people.
The off-stage effects were the most
pretentious and effective ever seen on
the Stanford stage. A specially con
structed plumbing system produced
rain that made one reach to turn up
his coat collar. Various kinds of thun
der and lightning caused the audience
to forget the balmy summer night out
side. Howling winds made window cur
tains fly and children shudder. The
roar of a flood chilled spectators al
most as much as it was supposed to
have chilled the actor caught in it.
Some fifty well-executed off'stage cues
brought professional realism to the
Carolina thunder storm. All these
things transpired back of Les Kiler's
very effective log cabin setting.
Out in front there played as capable
and well-rounded a cast as Hatcher
Hughes or George M. Cohan could ask
for. Gordon Davis—well, he deserves
two paragraphs all his own.
First of all, there was Gordon Davis
—Actor. Always a favorite on the
Stanford stage, he probably has never
been more Varmly received. Playing
the difficult part of Rufe Pryor, reli
gious fanatic, Davis made the most of
its humor possibilities. Yet his Rufe
Fryor was just what the author had in
mind —a bitterly tragic, pitifully hu
morous, deadly serious, hatefully
scheming religious crank. And if the
audience liked Rufe Pryor where they
j should have hated him, it was only
because Gordon Davis was too dear to
their hearts to be hated no matter how
villainous his role.
Then there was Gordon Davis—Di
rector. To play Rufe Pryor as Gordon
Davis did is a distinct achievement.
To direct "Hell-Bent Fer Heaven," a
play calling for the most meticulous
attention to detail of action, lines,
grouping, and off-stage problems—to
direct such a play successfully, as Gor
don Davis did, is also a distinct
achievement. To do both, as did Gor
don Davis in a short ten nights of re
hearsal, is nothing short of a triumph.
And now that we've said so many
nice things of the actor-dire<itor it's
going to be hard to do the rest of the
cast justice without boring repetition.
\\%yne Newcomb as Sid Hunt and
Phil Urner as Andy Lowry, the two
young men who so nearly revived the
ancient Hunt-Lowry feud, gave sterling
performances. Newcomb was one of
the most likable juvenile leads we have
seen in a long time. His dancing for
Andy, his Damnation of Rufe, his love
scenes with Jude, all bore the stamp
of real sincerity and ability.
Andy Lowry, according to the play,
was a hard-drinking, impressionable
young mountaineer. That's just what
Phil Urner made him. Urner's work as
a drunk was effective enough to sug
gest long practice (please don't mis
interpret) and one of the finest bits in
the whole performance centered
around his making Sid dance to the
tune of his own pointed pistol and
Rufe's banjo.
•Leonard Bowman, who played
Grandfather David Hunt, overcame the
handicap of his Santa Claus make-up
to win merited applause. His religion
was the Christianity of practical com
mon sense. When Rufe intimated that
the old man wasn't a Christian he dou
bled his fists and threatened to show
Rufe if he was or not. Bowman gave a
consistently genuine performance.
Guy Holliday as Sid's father, Matt

Hunt, was a grizzled old mountaineer j
whose quick temper manifested itself
In an itch to pull the trigger of a
wicked-looking shotgun with various
persons at the business end.
Miss June Clemmons played the part
of Meg Hunt, Sid's mother, with an i
intensity that was contagious. Her j
work would credit a much more experi- j
enced actress. Largely upon her shotil- j
ders fell the task of conveying that
sense of portending disaster which
was quite essential to the success of
the melodrama.
Miss Marian Henshall brought grace,
beauty, and a rich vibrant voice to the
part of Jude Lowry, Sid's betrothed.
You couldn't help liking Jude, as wo- I
manly when she threatened to put i
spiders in dumplings as when she |
murmured frenzied "Hallelujahs" to 1
Rufe's ravings. Miss Henshall, if she I
stays, will be a welcome figure on the;
Assembly Hall stage.
Paul Bissinger, dramatic manager,
deserves credit for the largest house
yet to witness a Summer Quarter play.

A passing mark in five hours of work
is the requirement to remain in school
at the University of Oregon.
