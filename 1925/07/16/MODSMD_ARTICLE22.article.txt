Stanford can ill afford to lose Harry
Maloney for even the one year's leave
of absence which he is taking in order
to study medicine at Lane Hospital.
Harry Maloney has made a remark
able record since his appointment as
Director of Minor Sports, not only in
the number of titles and champion
ships which his men have won, but
also in the number of University stu
dents? whom he has interested in the
various sports under his care. *
He has always been an advocate of
"sport for sport's sake," and has at
tained an international reputation for
his ideals of sportemanship, and his
ability to lead and teach men.
We are sorry to see you leave,
Harry, and come back as soon as you
can. Stanford needs you.
