# THE 						FALL OF ROME
## 
### 
Sooner or later, in every Course that
I have Been in around this university,
no Matter whether it's Clay modelling
1 or Functions of Double-jointed Peri
meters, the Prof always gets around
to giving his own Private explanation
of why did Rome fall? Now this sub
ject Never did concern me none before,
but they Make so much Fuss about it
that they may be something To it
after all.
In the Bugs dept. they claim that
Rome Fell because of mosquitoes
which Bit them and give them ma
laria. In history they say it had to
Fall sometime or it would still be
Standing. In Math they lay the blame
onto the Romans having Lost their
faith in hyperbolic Paraboloids and
forgot their duty to Ellipsoidal asymp
totes.
Various others has got their own
Pet ideas of why did it Fall. After giv
ing it some Thought, I would say that
Rome fell because it Slipped on some
thing, probably a banana Peel.

A Job I Would Like to Have
