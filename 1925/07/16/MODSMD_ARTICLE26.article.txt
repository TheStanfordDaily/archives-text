# BALLADE OF DISILLUSINMENT
## 
### 
Alas! my woe is like the sea!
Misfortune comes quite unforeseen.
My life is filled with misery;
Calamity is all I glean.
The fat years pass and leave the
lean;
The wolf of Doubt my bosom gnaws.
I'll tell you plainly what I mean
There isn't any Santa Claus!

My luck is at its apogee;
My joy is now in quarantine;
There is no balm in Gilead's lea;
All butter is oleomargarine;
The cat gets chestnuts all unseen —
The monkey only burns his paws.
Go tell this to a horse-marine —
There isn't any Santa Claus!

The gates of Fortune have no key;
A whale is just a big sardine;
There is no "open sesame";
I wish I still were sweet sixteen;
An old broom does not sweep so
clean;
There ain't no Justice, only Laws;
There even ain't no Santa Claus!
