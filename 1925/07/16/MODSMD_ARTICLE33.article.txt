# UNIVERSAL RELGION SUBJECT FOR BAHAI
## 
### 
"The Universal Religion" will be the
subject for the discussion following
the regular meeting of Bahai to be
held at 7 p.m. on Wednesday, July 22,
at the Women's Clubhouse. All stu
dents are invited.
The Bahais believe that there is one
reality that underlies all religions. "It
needs must be reality, and reality is
one, not multiple. Therefore the foun
dation of the divine religions is one.
If we seek the reality of the founda
tion we shall all agree, because reli
gion is one and not multiple," they
say.
