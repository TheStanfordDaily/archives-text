# WARNER EXPLAINS LINE PLAY STRATEGY
## 
### 
Coach Glenn Warner, in answering
some of the questions put to him by
the men in his football coaching
course, explained why and how the
I Stanford line outplayed the much
touted Notre Dame line in the 1925
New Year's game.
By inverting the usual positions of
i the ends and tackles, that is by play
! '"g the ends in and the tackles back,
Ihe entirely disorganized the Irish at
tack. The fact that Notre Dame made
no first downs after the first quarter
sufficienetly substantiates this. Rockne
j had evidently been expecting a regula
tion type of defense, and so Warner's
| slight variation from the usual form
j successfully checked him.
He also demonstrated how a little
: careful forethought may spell the dif
ference between defeat and victory.
During the entire 1924 season Stan
ford had no kicks blocked although
â–  the end-over-end pass used and the oc
(casionally unbalanced punt formation,
j had subjected Warner to a good deal
I of adverse criticism. He impressed on
| his men the necessity of holding the
line during punts longer in the second
half than in the first as the kicker
would then be more fatigued. The
aforementioned record shows how ne
cessary and how successful was this
advice.
