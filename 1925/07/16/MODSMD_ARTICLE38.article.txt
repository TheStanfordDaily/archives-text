Malaby, a graduate of the class of
'23, has made many contributions to
musical affairs on the campus. During
the past winter he has been studying
in Boston with Heinrich Gebhard (en
semble playing particularly). Malaby
is spending the summer in Palo Alto
and will return to Boston in the fall
to continue his study. Miss Estabrook
graduated from Stanford last year and
has since been teaching music in the
San Jose schools.

A professor at the University of
Wisconsin has invited members of his
class to send anonymous letters to him
criticizing him.
