# ATHLETES ESCAPE SCHOLARSHIP CUT
## 
### 
Dean George B. Culver is authority
for the statement that to his knowl
edge no veteran athlete failed to make
passing grades during the spring quar
ter. Nevers, Swan, Ted Shipkey, and
most of the other big football stars
came through with comparatively high
scholarships, while several freshman
athletes who were in danger ended
well within the margin of safety.
