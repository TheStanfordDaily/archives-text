Here's Comfort for You
Men who wear crepe-rubber soled sport shoes say
they're the finest ever for comfort, especially since
the "spreading" difficulty has been overcome, and
the soles- and heels no longer push out as they did
sometimes when the idea first originated.
We have seven styles—ranging from
a brown elk moccasin at $5 to an
English Pigskin at $12.
