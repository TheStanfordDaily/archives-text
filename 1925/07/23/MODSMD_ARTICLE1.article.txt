# FIRST MEMBER OF BUSINESS SCHOOL FACULTY ARRIVES
## V. H. Pelz Believes Conditions At Stanford Favorable To New Plan 
### 
"Stanford is an ideal place for the
establishment of a graduate school of
business administration because your
very excellent Economics Department
builds a firm foundation for the con
tinuance of advanced work," said Mr.
V. H. Pelz, who arrived Tuesday
and is the first member of the new
School of Business Administration to
make his residence here.
"The undergraduate department
should prepare the student for the
more advanced work," explained Pelz.
"There is, no necessity for the conflict
between graduate and elementary
studies which many people believe
exists. The function of the graduate
school is to go thoroughly into the
field of business administration in
stead of merely enlarging on the pre
vious courses. The study of finance and
accounting is the keystone for a sound
elementary business education. Stan
ford has and does cover these subjects
in a manner which is highly desirable
as an introduction for a graduate
school of business administration.
"Dr. Wildman has been working for
ten years towards the foundation of
this new school and deserves great
credit for its ultimate realization."
Pelz, who is a former student of Mr.
Willard E. Hotchkiss, dean of the new
school, received his A.B. degree and
his M.A. degree from Northwestern
University in 1916 and 1917, respec
tively.
He has been teaching in the College
of Commerce at Tulane University for
two years. Previous to this he was on
the faculty at University of Minnesota.
At Stanford he will unite with Dean
Hotchkiss in giving two courses: Basic
Business Concepts and Business Prob
lems and Policies.
