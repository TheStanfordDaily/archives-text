# SUMMER SQUASH
## ODE TO OLE 
### A. G. D 
The Linotyper
I love thee, gentle Ole, thou serene
Tobacco-scented Muse of the Machine.
I love thy bleary eye, thy waving hair,
I love each charming grace which isn't
there.
Thou once did hand to me a red-hot
slug,
Yet I forgave and kissed thy ugly mug.
In gratitude then from me didst thou
swipe
Edgeworth enow to smoke thy grubby
pipe
For seven thousand ems of 6 point
bold—
And still I love thee as I loved of old.
They tell me, darling, that thou canst
not spell,
Thy punctuation is as poor as Well,
I send thee daily many billets doux
Writ on copy sheets so clear and true,
And thou dost ruin, with a careless
eye, ,
My well-turned phrases with a line
of pi.
They tell me that thou thinkest it
no sin
To insert "shrdlu" or "etaoin"
In place of polished terms with which
I sought
To change the course of every reader's
thought;
And oft thou dost not hesitate to cut
Whole paragraphs, ye lazy, idle scut!
Yet still my love for thee is even riper
Than writer ever held for linotyper,
And so to prove to thee that I am loyal,
Here is more copy, just for thee to
spoil.
