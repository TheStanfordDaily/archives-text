# Price of Hair Cuts Goes Up August 1
## 
### 
Hair cuts will be 65 cents on and
after August 1 on the campus and in
Palo Alto, Menlo, and Mayfleld. Shaves
will be 35 cents. The raise was ordered
by the International Journeyman Bar
bers Union and will probably affect all
of the Western Coast. Oakland and the
East Bay have already adopted the
new schedule.
