# VELVA DARLING STARS AS REPORTER
## 
### 
Miss Velva Darling, '25, has been
given a position on the San Francisco
Bulletin as a result of her write-up of
the Santa Barbara disaster. A hurry
message was sent to her home in San
Luis Obispo, asking if she could cover
the events as they took place. Miss
Darling motored to Santa Barbara and
spent the night typing on a box on the
curb.
Miss Darling was a graduate of the
Journalism department and belonged
to Theta Sigma Phi, and the American
Journalists Association. She is also a
member of Kappa Alpha Theta.
