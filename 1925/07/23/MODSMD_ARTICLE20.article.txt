# Music Notes
## "Dodson's Hints on Musical Hits" 
### 
Outstanding among the Victor re
leases for the week is Whiteman's re
cording of "Gigolette." This latest fox
trot, which is already famous in Eu
rope and Latin-America, was written
by the composer of the "Merry Widow"
waltz. Claim your copy at our store
tomorrow. "Southern Rose," charming
as its name, is on the other side of
the record.
The Benson Orchestra of Chicago
plays "Because You" and "The
Whole World is Dreaming of Love."
The first is liquid, smooth flowing, and
features some excellent piano work.
The second is chipper. Careful listen
ing will reveal some interesting new
tricks of dance orchestration.
Tremendous price reductions on
Victrolas and Sonoras —all new, genu
ine, and guaranteed—make this the
ideal time to buy your phonograph.
You can get, for example, a splendid
Sonora console model for as little as
$65. Terms, too.
