# BIG GAME SCRIP SALE TO SUMMER QUARTER STUDENTS
## Entitles Holder to Seats for Next Ten California-Stanford Battles 
### 
Stanford Football Scrip, each book
of which entitles the holder to pre
ferred seats at the next ten big foot
ball games with the University of
California, will be available to students
registered at Stanford during the sum

office of the General Manager of Ath

The sale of football scrip to date has
been restricted to regular students,
alumni, faculty members, and stadium
subscribers, all of whom have been

holder to a preferred Big Game ticket
each year for ten years. Any ticket
coupon not used in the year for which
it is originally intended may be used
in a following year.

capacity at Berkeley, which in turn is
greater by 5,000 than will be the ca
