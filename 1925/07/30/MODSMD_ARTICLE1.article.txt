# STANFORD PEOPLE BACK INTERNATIONAL PLAYHOUSE SCHEME
## Jordan Endorses Movement For Bringing European Drama to America 
### 
Among the supporters of the new
International Playhouse in New York,
which is under the direction of Irma
Kraft, are Dr. David Starr Jordan, Dr.
Ray Lyman Wilbur, and Holbrook
Blinn, actor, who attended Stanford
for a time. The aim of the new play
house is to introduce in the United
States plays typical of all countries.
According to the pamphlets sent out
by Miss Kraft, all plays will be pro
duced in English, but directed by na
tives of the countries to which the
plays belong. Thus, the committee
states, it. is hoped that the original
atmosphere will remain, but the plays
■will be intelligible to the American
public.
Plans have been outlined for giving
«acli play a run of not more than six
weeks at the International Playhouse
in New York City, and then sending it
on to another theatre or out on the
road. If "!
The repertoire to be produced in
cludes the work of unknown authors,
as well as plays by Rolland, Gals
worthy, Benavente, Fabricius, and
other prominent writers. A subscrip
tion plan is being used to support the
season's schedule.
Other Stanford graduates who have
lent their support to the movement,
are Miss Maude Howell, '10, stage
manager for George Arliss, and Miss
Florence Mason, '18.
