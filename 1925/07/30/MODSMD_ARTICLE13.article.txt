# WEST COAST NEEDS BUSINESS SCHOOL SAYS DR. HOTCHKISS
## 
### 
"Stanford has demonstrated that
j there is a demand for a school of busi
ness administration on the Pacific.
Coast by sending more people to the
i Harvard School of Business than any
other institution. Once in the East,
many of these young people remain
there and the West loses their ser
vices. From this single angle—saving
the Pacific Coast talent for the Pacific
j Coast —the graduation school of busi-

ness justifies its establishment." This
is the statement of Dr. Willard E.
Hotchkiss, dean of Stanford's new
School of Business Administration,
who arrived on the campus Tuesday.
Coast Needs Talent
"Pacific Coast business men," ex
plained Hotchkiss, "need the type of
men and women who have the* intellect
and ambition to complete the kind of
course which the new school offers,
and nowhere in the United States are
the graduates of this school of busi
ness likely to find better and more
expanding opportunity for real achieve
ment and success than here on the
Pacific Coast."
Dr. Hotchkiss has already organized
two graduate schools of business ad
ministration, one at Northwestern Uni
versity and the other at the University
of Nebraska. He came to Stanford
from Northwestern University. He is
at present executive director of the
National Industrial Federation of
Clothing Manufacturers.
