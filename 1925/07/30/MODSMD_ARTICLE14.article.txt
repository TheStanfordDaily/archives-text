# AMERICANS MUST APPRECIATE WORLD PROBLEMS--WILBUR
## President Delivers Address on Meeting of Pacific Relations Institute 
### 
"We are the problem of the Pacific.
It was the United States which used
its power and wealth to open Japan
and China. We have presented our
ideals to them and they have adopted
many, but they are coming into their
own self-consciousness; they have
realized the problems with which they
must deal, and they will seek these
solutions for their-own benefit. These
things they are going to do with all
the great resources and energy in their
possession. We may as well make up
our minds to the fact that they are
going to do it. The only way that these
vital questions can be settled to the
advantage of those concerned is by a
clear and thorough understanding of
each other's ideals and problems."
This is the statement made by Presi
dent Ray Lyman Wilbur, who has just
returned from the first meeting of the
Pacific Relations Institute which was
held in Honolulu from June 30 to
July 15.
"We are the most self-satisfied fool
ish folk in the world," continued Dr.
Wilbur. "We do not stop to consider
how we look as world citizens. The
education of the bulk of our popula
tion consists of a few magazines and
the motion pictures. This is not good
education.
"If you are interested in America
you will be interested in international
problems. Get interested in interna
tional affairs and forget the ideas and
propaganda with which politicians are
elected in America. The history of the
Pacific is yet to be written. In the fu
ture the racial problem is going to
come before us constantly and must
be settled sometime.
Institute of Pacific Relations
"There were certain outstanding
features brought out at the Institute
of Pacific Relations. Most significant
of all was the great movement of mass
education in China. With the simplifi
cation adopted it has been possible to
give a reading knowledge to Chinese
of all ages and both sexes within a
comparatively short period of training.
The four hundred millions of Chinese
are now undergoing one of the greatest
ferments in all history. The character
and extent of this mass education will
be one of the dominant features in the
future of the Pacific. The new spirit of
nationality and the new and unusually
vigorous attitude of Young China to
ward foreign encroachment, past and
prjesent, is symbolic of the changes
going on.
"It is quite clear that there is a very
definite need for a better basis for the
understanding of immigration prob
lems and that the legislation on this
subject in all the Pacific countries
should be carefully studied. One of the
greatest needs of all is that there shall
be developed more adequate avenues
for publicity from one country to the
other. Great barriers are provided by
the distance, the cable tolls, and par
ticularly the indifference of the people
of one country toward the problems of
the other. Ma#iy of the difficulties that
have arisen have been due to scare
head contacts serving as irritants.
"All over the world, particularly in
the Pacific Basin, there is marked
growth in racial consciousness. This,
combined as it is, with the national
istic spirit in many quarters, is a most
potent factor. It is quite clear that
with the increase in the opportunity
for transportation of goods and people j
from one country to the other race is

to be one of the dominating questions
of the future.
"At the conference it was brought
out that there are a number of experi
ments upon this subject of race set up
and going on. This is particularly true
in the Hawaiian and some of the other
islands of the Pacific. It is imperative
that a most careful study from every
standpoint, biological, social, economic,
and governmental, should be made of
these situations by the scientist and
the scientifically-minded sociologist.
"The whole spirit of the recent In
stitute was one of willingness to meet
these frankly and unafraid.
It became quite clear that the deci
sions of any one country had marked
significance for every other country in
the Pacific.
"One of the most important points
of the conference," said Dr. Wilbur,
"was the fact that we could get repre
sentatives together from various coun
tries concerned and discuss in infor
mal conference and have a frank,
thorough debate of problems—without
rancor—and consider them together."
Organization of the Institute
At the closing of the meeting he
was appointed a member of a tem
porary organization committee, con
sisting of Frank C. Atherton, S. T.
Wen, Y. Tsurmi, and John Nelson.
Dr. Wilbur explained that the insti
tute passed no resolutions, for the
ultimate purpose of the meeting was
to study the problems presenting them
selves on the Pacific and not to tell
the world what it may or may not do.
Australia, Korea, China, New Zea
land, the Philippines, Japan, Canada,
and the United States were repre
sented. The meeting was entirely un
official, being sponsored by interested
parties and not by the different gov
ernments.
