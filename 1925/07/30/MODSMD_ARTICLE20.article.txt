# Leading Again
## 
### 
Stanford has attained a world-wide
reputation for leadership in practically
every field of human endeavor. Her
graduates and her faculty are con
tributing in great measure to the
scientific and moral progress of the
world. It is only fitting that President
Wilbur should be one of the first to
denounce in no uncertain terms the
apathy and self-satisfaction which
characterizes America's attitude to
ward international problems.
The Pacific Relations Institute
passed no wordy "resolutions;" there
were no flamboyant oratorical out
bursts to arouse the emotions and hin
der keen, analytical thinkingâ€”and the
result of the two weeks' conference,
as outlined by President Wilbur last
Tuesday, was a fearless indictment of
not only America, but the other Pacific
powers as well.
The time has come when self-cen
tered, hysterical, flag-waving stupidity
must give way to careful thinking and
a serious consideration of our position
among the nations of the world, and
of what we are doing to merit the
leadership which we have assumed.
Stanford men and women should be
proud of the fact that our President
is a leader in the movement to get
away from false prejudice and selfish
ness in a scientific endeavor to solve
international problems with brains in
stead of brawn.
