BALLADE OF THE ANCIENT JEST
Far above this doleful sphere,
Somewhere beyond the Milky Way,
Revel the Jesters of Yesteryear,
Cracking gags till the Judgment Day.
Sly Casanova and Rabelais,
Dan Chaucer and Baudelaire alike
Grin as they hear Bocaccio say,
"It seemß two Irishmen, Pat and
Mike "
For still the Jests of Yesteryear
Are common coin when men are gay:
"Boss, dey's only us chickens here!"
"What did you do with last week's
pay?"
"He sat on a pitchfork in the hay—"
"Two coons came running up the
pike—"
"He got the job." "No ice today!"
"It seems two Irishmen, Pat and
Mike "
The canny Scot, the stein of beer,
The stranded Ham, the rural jay,
The baby on the chandelier,
The mother-in-law who "came to
stay,"
Cannot compare in any way
With one I heard when just a tike,
(I'll hear it when I'm old and gray)
"It sterns two Irishmen, Pat and
Mike "
ENVOI
Prince, if the old jokes were taken
away,
Your royal jester would go on strike.
I heard a good one pulled today:
"It seems two Irishmen, Pat and
Mike- 5 "
