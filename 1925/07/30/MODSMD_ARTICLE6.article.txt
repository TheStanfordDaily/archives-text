# "DEAR BRUTUS" READY FOR PUBLIC TOMORROW
## Second Chance in Life Theme of Barrie's Comedy---Experienced Cast 
### 
By Mildred Dannenbaum
1 S varied as the personalities in the play of "Dear Brutus," the coming
** campus production of July 31, are the stage experiences of the actors who
will take part in Barrie's charming comedy. The members., of the cast range
from those who have played in many University presentations to new dramatic
finds on the campus.
Will Dearth, the painter who has lost his ambition and hold on life because
of a disinterested wife, will be played by Paul Hays. This characterization
Will be added to a long list of roles which Hays has taken in the last few
years. Before he went East to study he took the leads in dramatic per
formances given by the San Mateo Players Guild. Later, while working for
his B.A. degree at Columbia University, he was with the Irvine Players in

New York City. Among some of the plays in which he has taken part are:
•"Dulcy," "Excuse Me," "Sam Average," "Getting Married," and "The Pillars
of Society."
Marjorie Allen, who will portray Margaret, the daughter who "might have
been," has been a dramatic favorite on the campus for some time. When she
first appeared on the University stage, campus dramatic critics announced,
that she was the best ingenue that Stanford has seen for many years. Always
graceful and vivacious, Marjorie Allen's)

takes the role of Margaret with all the
winsomeness of a Peter Pan. Some of
the productions in which she has been
seen are: "Captain Applejack," "Mile
stones," "You and I," and "Ace High."
Student directors will be represented
in the cast of "Dear Brutus" by
Charles Parks, who plays Jack Purdie,
the inconstant and inconsistent hus- j
band. Parks directed the last senior
farce, "Polly With a Past," until Gor- !
don Davis returned from the East, j


The Butler arrives with the Aristocratic.Lady on his arm, one way in which
Barrie proves his point that, "the fault, Dear Brutus, lies not in our stars,
but in ourselves, that we are underlings." Left to right: Adelaide Mack,
Charles Parks, Barbara Eubanks, Jake Irwin, Marian Roberts.
He has taken parts in many of the
plays for the last three years, some
of which are: "If I Were King," "He
Who Gets Slapped," "Androcles and
the Lion," and "The Hottentot."
Lob, the "dear, funny old man" of
the comedy, will be played by A. Grove
Day. Lob is an understanding sort of
an old fellow who knows what every
one wants in life, and better than that,
knows what is best for people. As A.
Grove Day himself says, "This is the
first time I've ever played anything
but a servant's part." But the ser
vant's parts that Day has played are
not the sort in which the butler says,
"Very good, sir," or, "Breakfast is
served," or, "Who shall I say called?"
The roles have been characterizations
that require an appreciation of human
nature in order to put over a clear-cut,
convincing portrayal. Day took the
part of the porter in "Macbeth," which
is one of the most difficult bits of
Shakespearean comedy. The part was
put into the tragedy to relieve a tense
situation and heighten a dramatic ef
fect.
Jacob Irwin is one member of the
"Dear Brutus" cast who is appearing
for the first time in a dramatic produc
tion. Irwin is the butler, Matey, of
the comedy, who cherishes a secret de
sire to be a wealthy influential man
of the world.
Claire Dawes, who is Mrs. Coade in

"Dear Brutus," has had experience on
the amateur stages of England and
America. She has played in "Psyche,"
"The Nut Brown Maid," and "Eager
Heart." Miss Dawes is a teacher in
Los Angeles.
The sophisticated, well-poised. Mrs.
Dearth will be portrayed by Lucie
Bently, who gives an easy, graceful
interpretation of the part. She was in
"Oedipus Rex" and also took part in
"Antigone," which was presented at
the Southern Branch of the University
of California.
Marian Roberts from the San Jose
Teachers College will be seen as Mabel
Purdie, a wife who is very much in
love with her husband. She belongs to
the dramatic society, the San Jose
Players, and lias taken part in "The
Drums of Oude."
Barbara Eubanks is Lady Caroline,
the blue-blood aristocrat of the play.
This role offers some excellent oppor
tunities for broad comic interpreta
tions. Barbara Eubanks has appeared
several times in campus productions

and is well known as an aesthetic
dancer.
The coquette of the comedy is played
by Adelaide Mack from the Southern
Branch of the University of California.
She is appearing for the first time in
dramatics but gives a vivid impersona
tion of a flirt who carries out her
theory of "Flattery is the best policy."
The role of Mr. Coade* who takes
orders from his wife, is taken by Louis
Gordou Hitchcock. He has played in
"If I Were King" and "Will Shakes
peare."

The Butler arrives with the Aristocratic.Lady on his arm, one way in which
Barrie proves his point that, "the fault, Dear Brutus, lies not in our stars,
but in ourselves, that we are underlings." Left to right: Adelaide Mack,
Charles Parks, Barbara Eubanks, Jake Irwin, Marian Roberts.
He has taken parts in many of the
plays for the last three years, some
of which are: "If I Were King," "He
Who Gets Slapped," "Androcles and
the Lion," and "The Hottentot."
Lob, the "dear, funny old man" of
the comedy, will be played by A. Grove
Day. Lob is an understanding sort of
an old fellow who knows what every
one wants in life, and better than that,
knows what is best for people. As A.
Grove Day himself says, "This is the
first time I've ever played anything
but a servant's part." But the ser
vant's parts that Day has played are
not the sort in which the butler says,
"Very good, sir," or, "Breakfast is
served," or, "Who shall I say called?"
The roles have been characterizations
that require an appreciation of human
nature in order to put over a clear-cut,
convincing portrayal. Day took the
part of the porter in "Macbeth," which
is one of the most difficult bits of
Shakespearean comedy. The part was
put into the tragedy to relieve a tense
situation and heighten a dramatic ef
fect.
Jacob Irwin is one member of the
"Dear Brutus" cast who is appearing
for the first time in a dramatic produc
tion. Irwin is the butler, Matey, of
the comedy, who cherishes a secret de
sire to be a wealthy influential man
of the world.
Claire Dawes, who is Mrs. Coade in

"Dear Brutus," has had experience on
the amateur stages of England and
America. She has played in "Psyche,"
"The Nut Brown Maid," and "Eager
Heart." Miss Dawes is a teacher in
Los Angeles.
The sophisticated, well-poised. Mrs.
Dearth will be portrayed by Lucie
Bently, who gives an easy, graceful
interpretation of the part. She was in
"Oedipus Rex" and also took part in
"Antigone," which was presented at
the Southern Branch of the University
of California.
Marian Roberts from the San Jose
Teachers College will be seen as Mabel
Purdie, a wife who is very much in
love with her husband. She belongs to
the dramatic society, the San Jose
Players, and lias taken part in "The
Drums of Oude."
Barbara Eubanks is Lady Caroline,
the blue-blood aristocrat of the play.
This role offers some excellent oppor
tunities for broad comic interpreta
tions. Barbara Eubanks has appeared
several times in campus productions

and is well known as an aesthetic
dancer.
The coquette of the comedy is played
by Adelaide Mack from the Southern
Branch of the University of California.
She is appearing for the first time in
dramatics but gives a vivid impersona
tion of a flirt who carries out her
theory of "Flattery is the best policy."
The role of Mr. Coade* who takes
orders from his wife, is taken by Louis
Gordou Hitchcock. He has played in
"If I Were King" and "Will Shakes
peare."

his B.A. degree at Columbia University, he was with the Irvine Players in

New York City. Among some of the plays in which he has taken part are:
•"Dulcy," "Excuse Me," "Sam Average," "Getting Married," and "The Pillars
of Society."
Marjorie Allen, who will portray Margaret, the daughter who "might have
been," has been a dramatic favorite on the campus for some time. When she
first appeared on the University stage, campus dramatic critics announced,
that she was the best ingenue that Stanford has seen for many years. Always
graceful and vivacious, Marjorie Allen's)

takes the role of Margaret with all the
winsomeness of a Peter Pan. Some of
the productions in which she has been
seen are: "Captain Applejack," "Mile
stones," "You and I," and "Ace High."

1 S varied as the personalities in the play of "Dear Brutus," the coming
** campus production of July 31, are the stage experiences of the actors who
will take part in Barrie's charming comedy. The members., of the cast range
from those who have played in many University presentations to new dramatic
finds on the campus.
Will Dearth, the painter who has lost his ambition and hold on life because
of a disinterested wife, will be played by Paul Hays. This characterization
Will be added to a long list of roles which Hays has taken in the last few
years. Before he went East to study he took the leads in dramatic per
formances given by the San Mateo Players Guild. Later, while working for
his B.A. degree at Columbia University, he was with the Irvine Players in

New York City. Among some of the plays in which he has taken part are:
•"Dulcy," "Excuse Me," "Sam Average," "Getting Married," and "The Pillars
of Society."
Marjorie Allen, who will portray Margaret, the daughter who "might have
been," has been a dramatic favorite on the campus for some time. When she
first appeared on the University stage, campus dramatic critics announced,
that she was the best ingenue that Stanford has seen for many years. Always
graceful and vivacious, Marjorie Allen's)

takes the role of Margaret with all the
winsomeness of a Peter Pan. Some of
the productions in which she has been
seen are: "Captain Applejack," "Mile
stones," "You and I," and "Ace High."
Student directors will be represented
in the cast of "Dear Brutus" by
Charles Parks, who plays Jack Purdie,
the inconstant and inconsistent hus- j
band. Parks directed the last senior
farce, "Polly With a Past," until Gor- !
don Davis returned from the East, j


The Butler arrives with the Aristocratic.Lady on his arm, one way in which
Barrie proves his point that, "the fault, Dear Brutus, lies not in our stars,
but in ourselves, that we are underlings." Left to right: Adelaide Mack,
Charles Parks, Barbara Eubanks, Jake Irwin, Marian Roberts.
He has taken parts in many of the
plays for the last three years, some
of which are: "If I Were King," "He
Who Gets Slapped," "Androcles and
the Lion," and "The Hottentot."
Lob, the "dear, funny old man" of
the comedy, will be played by A. Grove
Day. Lob is an understanding sort of
an old fellow who knows what every
one wants in life, and better than that,
knows what is best for people. As A.
Grove Day himself says, "This is the
first time I've ever played anything
but a servant's part." But the ser
vant's parts that Day has played are
not the sort in which the butler says,
"Very good, sir," or, "Breakfast is
served," or, "Who shall I say called?"
The roles have been characterizations
that require an appreciation of human
nature in order to put over a clear-cut,
convincing portrayal. Day took the
part of the porter in "Macbeth," which
is one of the most difficult bits of
Shakespearean comedy. The part was
put into the tragedy to relieve a tense
situation and heighten a dramatic ef
fect.
Jacob Irwin is one member of the
"Dear Brutus" cast who is appearing
for the first time in a dramatic produc
tion. Irwin is the butler, Matey, of
the comedy, who cherishes a secret de
sire to be a wealthy influential man
of the world.
