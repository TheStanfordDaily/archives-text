### 
By Mildred Dannenbaum
1 S varied as the personalities in the play of "Dear Brutus," the coming
** campus production of July 31, are the stage experiences of the actors who
will take part in Barrie's charming comedy. The members., of the cast range
from those who have played in many University presentations to new dramatic
finds on the campus.
Will Dearth, the painter who has lost his ambition and hold on life because
of a disinterested wife, will be played by Paul Hays. This characterization
Will be added to a long list of roles which Hays has taken in the last few
years. Before he went East to study he took the leads in dramatic per
formances given by the San Mateo Players Guild. Later, while working for
his B.A. degree at Columbia University, he was with the Irvine Players in

New York City. Among some of the plays in which he has taken part are:
•"Dulcy," "Excuse Me," "Sam Average," "Getting Married," and "The Pillars
of Society."
Marjorie Allen, who will portray Margaret, the daughter who "might have
been," has been a dramatic favorite on the campus for some time. When she
first appeared on the University stage, campus dramatic critics announced,
that she was the best ingenue that Stanford has seen for many years. Always
graceful and vivacious, Marjorie Allen's)

takes the role of Margaret with all the
winsomeness of a Peter Pan. Some of
the productions in which she has been
seen are: "Captain Applejack," "Mile
stones," "You and I," and "Ace High."
Student directors will be represented
in the cast of "Dear Brutus" by
Charles Parks, who plays Jack Purdie,
the inconstant and inconsistent hus- j
band. Parks directed the last senior
farce, "Polly With a Past," until Gor- !
don Davis returned from the East, j


The Butler arrives with the Aristocratic.Lady on his arm, one way in which
Barrie proves his point that, "the fault, Dear Brutus, lies not in our stars,
but in ourselves, that we are underlings." Left to right: Adelaide Mack,
Charles Parks, Barbara Eubanks, Jake Irwin, Marian Roberts.
