# "DEAR BRUTUS" IS RECEIVED CORDIALLY BY LARGE AUDIENCE

### Alan Porter 
"Dear Brutus," a comedy in three
acts by Sir James M. Barrie. The ac
tion takes place in Lob's house and
a wood. The cast follows:

Probably in 110 other of his plays j
las Barrie made a more profound im-1

pression than in 'Dear Brutus," which
was presented Friday night in the
Assembly Hall before an audience that
made no effort to conceal its cordiality.
This whimsical fantasy, which mirrors
the author's land of "might-have-been,"
struck its note of appeal to all in the
house and set the minds of the elders
back to the beginning of a certain
turn in the road of life.
Play Pleases in New York
The play, which was received with
«lelight when presented several sea
sons ago in New York witli a select
cast including William Gillette, Hilda
Spong. Marie Wainwright, Helen
Hayes, Violet Kemble Cooper, Louis
-Calvert, and J. H. Brewer, has today
in no way lost its message or de
stroyed Barrie's protest against fatal
ism, which he so well expressed in
the words of Shakespeare's Cassius:
"Men at some time are masters of
their fates; the fault, dear Brutus, is
not in our stars, but in ourselves, that
we are underlings."
That what we are we have made
ourselves is the keynote of the com
edy. Its tender and sympathetic expo
sition is to ease the vain yearnings
of those who would turn back, and to
strengthen and stimulate the future
we all must face. And in all, the aim
of the author has not been to draw his
picture with but a glimpse of one, but
to embrace universal mankind and re
kindle a latent spark of desire for
better things which may yet exist.
To describe the witcheries of the
play seems futile; it is to be seen, not
described. Barrie has chosen for his
locale an imaginary estate in old Eng
land. The host, Lob, a Puck grown
gray but still his elfish, frolicsome
self, has gathered about him on Mid
summer's Eve a representative body
of mortals. At a moment tense with
suspense a magic wood, the Forest of
Might Have Been, appears and into it
the party wanders. What happens
there, and its lesson, creates the play.
Hays Shows Understanding
In the local presentation of the play,
Dearth, the middle-aged artist, bowed
with disappointment and excesses, lost
to the affections and interest of his
beautiful wife, was excellently por
trayed by Paul Hays. His picture of
the artist rejuvenated through his ex
perience with his make-believe daugh
ter showed a clear understanding of
the part, and as the play ended, re
vealing the hero filled with the glow
of a better life, standing against a
background fo sunlight and pointing
ahead, Hays left with us a feeling that
we are to hear more of him.
Barrie's forest scene is the finest
thing of the play but it lost much of
its effect through the hideous crea
tions supposed to be trees. Here Miss i
Allen failed to live up to the require
ments of her part and instead of por- ;
traying the joyful and elf-like daugh- !
ter who "might have been," so much
desired by the artist and into whom
Barrie seems almost to have breathed
a soul, offered a shrill and at times ;
noisy characterization. To have failed j
to grasp all the possibilities of the ;

part seems a pity. Miss Allen was at
her best in lier closing lines where
her appealing cry "corne back, come
back, daddy! I don't wailt to be a
might-have-been!" struck a note of
genuine artistry.
The eternal triangle, which was set
in motion by Lob's warning, "two's
company, three's none," was a touch
of the true Barrie and gave Charles
Parks, as the self-justified and addle
brained Mr. Purdie who was proprie
tor of a wife and an extra, an oppor
tunity for some of the best acting of
the evening and he lost nothing in his
opportunity. In this part he was ably
assisted by the excellent work of
Marian Roberts, as the wife who frank
ly and scornfully acknowledged that
she could not see how splendid was
her unfaithful husband, and Adelaide
Mack, as a woman of hypocritical emo
tions.
Lucie Bentley Good
The best among the women was
Lucie Bentley. As Mrs. Dearth, wife of
the besotted artist, she showed in the
beginning a carefully poised indiffer
ence toward him which was delight
fully contrasted by her work in the
subsequent acts.
A. Grove Day, as Lob, was unfor
tunately cast but worked hard to over
come this difficulty. Puck, if we re
member correctly, was "the merry
wanderer of the night" and Barrie's
original selection was certainly a
small, babbling, old and elfish person.
The ghastly, satanical impersonation
by Mr. Day, even though his acting
was very good, seemed scarcely fair
to the little cherub or to fhe part.
Others in the cast were acceptable,

with the exception that the character
of Lady Caroline Lancy was quite
overdrawn. Mr. Davis and those who

| gave their efforts so splendidly to pro
| vide their patrons with the best ob
■ tainable are to be complimented. The

audience, as we have remarked before,
enjoyed the play, and, after all—that's
the thing that counts.
