# Walter Powell on Memorial Committee
## 
### 
Walter Powell, former Stanford ath
letic director and coach of the 1017
football team, has been named a mem
ber of the committee which will se
lect a suitable memorial for the late
Walter Camp. Powell Is now in At
lanta, Ga., and has given up football
for the insurance business.

i Elizabeth Wilbur will be the Clytem
-1 nestra of the drama. She was in the
chorus in "Agamemnon" two years ago
when it was given in Los Angeles. She
j also had a part in "Oedipus Rex," the
Greek drama produced here last sum
mer. In speaking of Miss Wilbur's
work, Miss Thomas says she shows
| great promise.
Most critics agree that Clytemnestra,
■ the unfaithful wife of Agamemnon, is
(lie most human character of the play.
She is created on the Aeschylean
scale, outrivals Lady Macbeth, and is
kin to Brunhilde. There is 110 approach
to a love scene in the drama. Clytem
nestra dares not show her real feelings
until Agamemnon is dead; then she
becomes a mad woman.
Cassandra Scene Best
Cassandra, a slave to Agamemnon,
and a daughter of the King of Troy,
will be played by Beatrice Myers, who
took the role two years ago at the
University of Southern California. She
is planning to make the stage her pro-
J fession. Last spring Miss Myers played
j the lead in "Antigone," which was
j given at the Southern Branch. Clayton
i Hamilton, who was in the audience at
I this performance, told her that he
j would see tiiat she was placed in Wal
| ter Hampden's company after she had
1 graduated from the university.
According to dramatic critics, the
Cassandra scene is above praise or
! criticism. Cassandra was at one time
1 beloved by Apollo, who gave her the
power of prophecy. For some reason
she broke her promise to Apollo.
Angered and revengeful, he placed
this curse upon her: from that time
' on, although she was able to foretell
i the truth, none would believe her.
