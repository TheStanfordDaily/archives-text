## 
### 
Walter Powell, former Stanford ath
letic director and coach of the 1017
football team, has been named a mem
ber of the committee which will se
lect a suitable memorial for the late
Walter Camp. Powell Is now in At
lanta, Ga., and has given up football
for the insurance business.

i Elizabeth Wilbur will be the Clytem
-1 nestra of the drama. She was in the
chorus in "Agamemnon" two years ago
when it was given in Los Angeles. She
j also had a part in "Oedipus Rex," the
Greek drama produced here last sum
mer. In speaking of Miss Wilbur's
work, Miss Thomas says she shows
| great promise.
Most critics agree that Clytemnestra,
â–  the unfaithful wife of Agamemnon, is
(lie most human character of the play.
She is created on the Aeschylean
scale, outrivals Lady Macbeth, and is
kin to Brunhilde. There is 110 approach
to a love scene in the drama. Clytem
nestra dares not show her real feelings
until Agamemnon is dead; then she
becomes a mad woman.
Cassandra Scene Best
Cassandra, a slave to Agamemnon,
and a daughter of the King of Troy,
will be played by Beatrice Myers, who
took the role two years ago at the
University of Southern California. She
is planning to make the stage her pro-
J fession. Last spring Miss Myers played
j the lead in "Antigone," which was
j given at the Southern Branch. Clayton
i Hamilton, who was in the audience at
I this performance, told her that he
j would see tiiat she was placed in Wal
| ter Hampden's company after she had
1 graduated from the university.
According to dramatic critics, the
Cassandra scene is above praise or
! criticism. Cassandra was at one time
1 beloved by Apollo, who gave her the
power of prophecy. For some reason
she broke her promise to Apollo.
Angered and revengeful, he placed
this curse upon her: from that time
' on, although she was able to foretell
i the truth, none would believe her.
Stanley Weigel will be seen as
Aigisthos, the lover of Clytemnestra.
He is appearing for the first time in a
dramatic presentation, but is well
known on the campus as a debater.
William Thornton is the herald in
the tragedy. Miss Thomas thinks that
he has talent for the classic drama
and would be successful in Shakes
pearean roles.
Leslie Gosslin is the leader of the
chorus. This part is essential in hold
ing the play together. The director of
the drama says that Gosslin's work is
excellent and that his study of the
Greek tragedy has enabled him to give
an inspiring interpretation of his part.
Chorus Forms Background
The elders, who make up the chorus,
form the background and the spirit
of the drama. According to Miss
Thomas the chorus has to undergo as
much training and practice as the
principals. Besides studying the tra
gedy to get the correct interpretation
of the lines, members of the chorus
have to do a great deal of work in
voice culture in order to get the proper
intonations for their parts.
The watchman has not been se
lected, because there has been keener
competition for this role than for any
of the others. This character, who
gives the speech which is the key to
the entire drama, has aroused the in
terest of a great many of the students.
The performance on the night of
August 14 will represent seven weeks
of study and careful voice training of
the actors under the direction of Miss
Thomas.
Special Theatre Built
The entire audience will be enclosed

with the stage by a green background,
which will represent the wall of an
ancient Greek city. The improvised 1
theatre for this occasion will seat an i
audience of 1500. According to Paul
Bissinger, student dramatic manager,
the real capacity of the theatre is 2000, ;

but 500 seats have been sacrificed in
order to give every one in the audi
' ence a complete view of the^tage.
The stage background will be a mag
nificent Greek temple, which will en
hance the religious theme of the
| tragedy. The color scheme has been

worked out to further the emotion of
the drama.
Costumes will be furnished by con
cerns in San Francisco and Los An
geles.
