# ANOTHER VIEWPOINT

Gross favoritism we call it, and noth
ing less —that Sequoia and Encina
should have such lovely shady ap
proaches from the Quad, while Roble
stands out in the field, and Robleites
swelter for the whole stretch from the
P. O. and the gym, as well as from
Quad direct.
Do we really have to wait till those
li'l oak trees, now supported in their
infancy by stakes and string, grow up
to be historic monuments before we
get any relief? There's a nice clump
of young pepper trees out in the field
in front of Roble —why not distribute
them along the walk and path for the
enjoyment of the weary co-ed panting
home to lunch?
Toyon and Branner are being beau
tified with flowers and shrubs; even
the corporation yard has trees all
around it, but the paths to Roble,
dusty, hot, and bare, still confront the
majority of the selected female popu
lation of the University.
Go on, put us in the shade! See if
we care. —E. J. B.
All freshmen will be barred from
