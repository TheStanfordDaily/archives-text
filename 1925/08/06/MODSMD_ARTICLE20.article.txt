# FOOD RESEARCH MEN INVESTIGATE WHEAT
## 
### 
"Wheat is the study under investiga
tion at present in the Stanford Pood
Research Institute. The results, issued
in a series of volumes, will constitute
about three hundred pages. Volume 8
of the series now on the press is on
"Canada as a Producer and Exporter
of Wheat," and will probably appear
about the end of the month.
Mr. M. K. Benentt, a member of the
staff, has recently published an article
in the July issue of the "Journal of
Parm Economics" on "A Method of
Measuring Managerial Ability in
Parming."
