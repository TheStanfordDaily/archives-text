Mrs. Stanford called
the Museum "her
building." The idea of
such a structure was
conceived by Leland
Stanford, Jr., when he
was 11 years old. Dur
ing a trip to Europe
he acquired objects of
interest from each
place at which he
visited, carefully cata
loguing them. When
he died in 1881, his
mother took up the
work where he left off.

The classic portals
of the Stanford Mu
seum make possible
the production of the
Greek drama, "Aga
memnon" in a setting
which truly conveys
the atmosphere of an
cient Argos. The play,
a masterpiece of the
tragedian Aeschylus,
will be presented Fri
day evening, August
14.
