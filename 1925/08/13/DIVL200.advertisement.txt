WHEN WE SAY
The "U"
WE HAVE SAID IT ALL
The "U" declares the definite *
character of fall style. Smart
sensible style expressed with
consummate skill by
KUPPENHEIMER
Note the lines of the
short 3-button coat—free assertive
shoulders, trimly suppressed at the
hips. The trousers—full and long.
A suit that step-ahead
fellows are wearing.
