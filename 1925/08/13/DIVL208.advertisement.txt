An Important Study
IS that of the right kind of hand bag to buy,
and the size that will be the most convenient
to carry for all-round use while at college or
on week-end trips home or elsewhere. A new
hand bag is extremely important with the
autumn costume, but from the many we have
in stock, you will find yourself tempted to
choose one, perhaps better than you intend to
get, because they are so reasonable and good
looking that they are hard to resist.
Extremely popular are the black cobra-grained
1 .eatheroid, with the gold color locks, and the
silk moire linings. One of the most interesting
features about these wonderfully constructed
cases are the new steel frames with the steel lip
to eliminate breaking. The next most import
ant are the rounded corners, the imported locks,
and the processed covering called Leatheroid,
which will not scratch like leather does. Of
course we have others less expensive. Don't
think that our whole stock consists of this kind,
for we have them from $1.75 up to $25.00.
18-in black patent on Vodette steel frame, $6.00
20-in. black patent with leather edging, $8.50
22-in. patent leather, $9.00
