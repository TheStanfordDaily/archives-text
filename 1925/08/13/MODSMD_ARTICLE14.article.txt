# AUSTRALIAN WANTS NEW INTERNATIONAL ATHLETIC AGREEMENT
## 
### 
If the plan proposed by Dr. Leslie
Utz of Sidney, Australia, who visited
the campus last week, is realized, there
may be in the future an athletic union
on the Pacific coast resembling that
between Yale, Harvard, Oxford, and
Cambridge, which plays so important
a part in the sporting events of the
Atlantic seaboard. The importance of
such a union from the point of view
of bringing about a closer and more
understanding relationship between
American institutions and those of
Australia cannot be overemphasized.
At present it is planned to have the
union consist of three Californian and
four Australian universities: Stanford,
California, Southern California, and
Melbourne, Sidney, Wellington, and
Queensland.
The Australians can offer competi
tion in two of the major sports and in
all the minor sports. They have no
basketball nor American football
teams. That there could be keen com
petition in the minor is shown by the
recent tour of the Stanford tennis
team through the Southern Pacific.
The only difficulty which might pre
vent the ultimate realization of the
plan, according to Paul Davis and
Harry Malony, is the necessarily high
expense of transportation across the
Pacific. In Australia a sinking fund
has been started to defray any losses
which may be occurred upon the trips.
If a similar effort were made in Cali
fornia there fould be little doubt that
there would be no danger of financial
loss.
President Ray Lyman Wilbur ex
pressed himself as being highly in
fator of any plan which would bring
about a closer relationship between
Australian and American universities.
The only difficulty, according to Presi
dent Wilbur, would be in having the
trips at such a time that they would
interfere with the studies of the re
spective teams as little as possible.
