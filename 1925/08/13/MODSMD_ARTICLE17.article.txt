# Paul Davis

Oftentimes it is hard for a laboring
scribe to adequately express how much
a certain individual has meant to Stan
ford. Changes are continually going on
which cause the retirement or resigna
tion of people who have been intimate
ly connected with Stanford's progress,
and in most instances an appreciative
journalist is stumped on the problem
of how to express our sense of loss.
The case of Paul Davis is decidedly
different. One merely has to enumerate
the most outstanding of his achieve
ments in his two years of service to
convey the thought that in losing him,
Stanford is losing the best Graduate
Manager we have ever had, and one of
the most promising men who have won
a degree from this University.
Cast your eye on this record: a com
plete reorganization of the Graduate
Manager's office, with a resultant in
crease of efficiency which has not only
made money for the Board of Athletic
Control, but also has created a strong
feeling of respect among students and
others for the business-like methods of
that office; the renovation of and ad
dition of two new wings to Encina
Gymnasium, and the beautification of
the adjacent grounds; the expert han
dling of all arrangements for the Pasa
dena New Year's game, which set a
precedent for speed and thoroughness
which astounded the officials of for
mer contests; occupation of the office
of President of the Pacific Coast Con
ference Managers Association, and
whose administration was remarkable
for its accomplishments; the assump
tion of supervisory control over the
Students Organization Fund, which
practically revolutionized that office,
and made paying propositions out of
activities which everyone thought
were destined to be perpetual drains
on the Associated Students income;
and the most important accomplish
ment of all —the enlargement of the
stadium, together with the building of
two team houses, several rest rooms,
and a new baseball diamond.
How's that for a record? If anything
more need be said, it is that those who
have known and been associated with
Paul Davis wish him the best of luck
in his new job with the Community
Chest, for in spite of the fact that he
is Old Man Efficiency himself, he is
what is known in the parlance as a
"good Joe."

ference Managers Association, and
whose administration was remarkable
for its accomplishments; the assump
tion of supervisory control over the
Students Organization Fund, which
practically revolutionized that office,
and made paying propositions out of
activities which everyone thought
were destined to be perpetual drains
on the Associated Students income;
and the most important accomplish
ment of all —the enlargement of the
stadium, together with the building of
two team houses, several rest rooms,
and a new baseball diamond.
How's that for a record? If anything
more need be said, it is that those who
have known and been associated with
Paul Davis wish him the best of luck
in his new job with the Community
Chest, for in spite of the fact that he
is Old Man Efficiency himself, he is
what is known in the parlance as a
"good Joe."
