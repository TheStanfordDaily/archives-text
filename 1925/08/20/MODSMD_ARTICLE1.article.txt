# "AGAMEMNON" WINS FAVOR OF CRITIC, DIRECTOR PRAISED
## 
### D. L. P 
The grand tragic "Agamemnon" of
Aeschylus, presented last Friday eve
ning by Stanford students under the
direction of Miss Evalyn Thomas
achieved deserved success. The great
difficulties surrounding modern pre
sentations of Greek drama were for
the most part successfully overcome.
Stanford is fortunate in that her single
building of Greek architecture affords
so attractive a setting, and fortunate,
too, in securing the skillful and intelli
gent direction of Miss Thomas.
The most was made of what meagre
action the play contains —so much, in
fact, that at times the meaning under
lying it suffered eclipse. That those of
the audience who were not previously
acquainted with the drama really
grasped its intention is much to be
doubted. But comprehending the thing
or not, everyone must have had admi
ration for the beauty of the setting,
the rich costuming of the people, the
grouping of the choruses, and the ap
propriate accompaniment of music.
Beatrice Meyers as Cassandra was
satisfactory. Her voice was rich and
clear with unquestionable dramatic
power. In her acting the artifice was so
perfect as to appear as absence of it.
And it is in this respect that the work
of Elizabeth Wilbur as Clytemnestra
fell somewhat short. In it one detected
the elocutionist. This quality, however,
was less apparent as the play pro
gressed, and in her final scene she was
genuinely effective. Herbert Abbott
was an impressive Agamemnon. A dif
ficult part was that of the leader of
the chorus played by William Gosslin.
His voice and manner were good, oc
casionally inaudible, especially when
he turned his back. Mr. Gosslin had
that fault in a less degree than others
of the cast. Stanley Weigel played the
vain and cowardly Aigisthos. Finlay
McDermid and William Thornton in
their respective parts of Watchman
and Herald gave creditable perfor
mances.
The charm of maidens, decorative
enough at times, helped to confuse the
utterance of the necessary chorus of
elders, and their presence frequently
caused a crowded stage. Yet the vol
ume of their chant was undeniably ef
fective. Miss Laura Peacock and her
assistants must be complimented on
the beautiful Dance of Victory. Light
ing effects were varied and colorful.
(The buzzing of arcs might have been
avoided.)
Unfavorable critcism of so worth
while an attempt is ungracious. The
wonder is not that Greek drama should
be well presented, but that it should
be presented at all. Miss Thomas has
performed no mean feat in making
this early drama live again. We hope
that next summer will see the produc
tion of another Greek play. To Miss
Thomas. Gordon Davis, and the large
cast we owe a great debt.

performed no mean feat in making
this early drama live again. We hope
that next summer will see the produc

The grand tragic "Agamemnon" of
Aeschylus, presented last Friday eve
ning by Stanford students under the
direction of Miss Evalyn Thomas
achieved deserved success. The great
difficulties surrounding modern pre
sentations of Greek drama were for
the most part successfully overcome.
Stanford is fortunate in that her single
building of Greek architecture affords
so attractive a setting, and fortunate,
too, in securing the skillful and intelli
gent direction of Miss Thomas.
The most was made of what meagre
action the play contains —so much, in
fact, that at times the meaning under
lying it suffered eclipse. That those of
the audience who were not previously
acquainted with the drama really
grasped its intention is much to be
doubted. But comprehending the thing
or not, everyone must have had admi
ration for the beauty of the setting,
the rich costuming of the people, the
grouping of the choruses, and the ap
propriate accompaniment of music.
Beatrice Meyers as Cassandra was
satisfactory. Her voice was rich and
clear with unquestionable dramatic
power. In her acting the artifice was so
perfect as to appear as absence of it.
And it is in this respect that the work
of Elizabeth Wilbur as Clytemnestra
fell somewhat short. In it one detected
the elocutionist. This quality, however,
was less apparent as the play pro
gressed, and in her final scene she was
genuinely effective. Herbert Abbott
was an impressive Agamemnon. A dif
ficult part was that of the leader of
the chorus played by William Gosslin.
His voice and manner were good, oc
casionally inaudible, especially when
he turned his back. Mr. Gosslin had
that fault in a less degree than others
of the cast. Stanley Weigel played the
vain and cowardly Aigisthos. Finlay
McDermid and William Thornton in
their respective parts of Watchman
and Herald gave creditable perfor
mances.
The charm of maidens, decorative
enough at times, helped to confuse the
utterance of the necessary chorus of
elders, and their presence frequently
caused a crowded stage. Yet the vol
ume of their chant was undeniably ef
fective. Miss Laura Peacock and her
assistants must be complimented on
the beautiful Dance of Victory. Light
ing effects were varied and colorful.
(The buzzing of arcs might have been
avoided.)
Unfavorable critcism of so worth
while an attempt is ungracious. The
wonder is not that Greek drama should
be well presented, but that it should
be presented at all. Miss Thomas has
performed no mean feat in making
this early drama live again. We hope
that next summer will see the produc
tion of another Greek play. To Miss
