# LIGHT WINES, BEERS TOPIC OF DEBATE FRIDAY EVENING
## 
### 
"Should the government legalize the
sale of light wines and beers" will be
the question of a debate to be held in
the Little Theatre tomorrow night at
7:30 under the auspices of Mr. J. G.
Emerson's class in debating. The meet
ing will be open to the public and no
admission will be charged.
According to Emerson, the class has
been gathering material on the ques
tion since the beginning of the last
half of the quarter.
The question, explained Emerson,
arose because of the present break
down of prohibition enforcement and
the belief on the part of such men as
Franklin D. Roosevelt, Secretary
Weeks, and Nicholas Murray-Butler
that light wines and beers offer a pos
sible solution.
Darrell Parker, Thelma Lani, Guy
Holliday, and William Aitken will be
the affirmative speakers, while the
negative will be upheld by C. H. Bab
cock, L. H. Brownstone, Leta Edington,
John McDermott, Herbert Steidley,
and Wilmot Crozier.
At the close of the debate the audi
ence will be invited to participate in
an open discussion and their vote will
decide the debate.
