# Dramatics
## 
### 
The second summer season of dra
matics, concluded last Friday night,
maintained the high standard of excel
lence which Gordon Davis has been
setting for his plays of recent years.
Starting with "Androcles and the
Lion" in the fall of 1923, every produc
tion under the direction of Gordon
Davis has achieved deserved success.
The offerings have been well varied
as to dramatic treatment, ranging from
Shakespeare to pure comedy, and each
presentation has evidenced skillful di
rection and careful attention to detail
which is usually found only in profes
sional efforts.
The program this summer was espe
cially ambitious, and while it may not
have been a complete success from the
financial standpoint, due principally to
the heavy expenditures necessary to
produce "Agamemnon," artistically it
left nothing to be desired. We await
with interest and anticipation the of
ferings for next year.
