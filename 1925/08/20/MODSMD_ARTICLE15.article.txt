The Editor, Daily Palo Alto:
Permit me to offer my congratula
tions to Miss Evalyn Thomas and her
co-workers for the beautiful and im
pressive performance of the Agamem
non given last Friday evening. The
facade of the Museum furnishes a very
appropriate setting for the staging of
a Greek play, and the several parts
were done so faithfully and effectively
that at the close the large audience
seemed loth to go back to the realities
of their modern world.
Yet it may be questioned whether
the Agamemnon is a very suitable play
to select for such a performance, and
whether, for all its greatness, it is not
a play to be read rather than acted.
In the first place it is in itself incom
plete, being really only the first act
in a larger drama. It closes amid un
certainty and confusion and one natur
ally asks what is to follow, for the
problems of the play are left unsolved.
In the second place, it includes such
lengthy speeches and choral odes that
only great professional skill in rendi
tion can possibly prevent their becom
ing monotonous.
The hardest role in the whole per
formance is that of the chorus-leader.
Mr. Gosslin played his part admirably,
but the chorus was handicapped by not
having a level space for concerted
mfivements and by being limited
through lack of appropriate music, to
a form of recitative, which, while dig
nified, proved nevertheless monoton
ous. It was doubtless for this reason
that certain devices were resorted to,
such as participation in the choral part
by the women of the palace, and the
performance of a special victory dance.
On the whole, however, it was a
beautiful and remarkable rendition,
and I can hope that some day we may
have the whole trilogy of the Oresteia
presented, with more adequate staging
and with special music composed to
suit the splendid and varied lyrics.
—Henry Rushton Fairclough.

The University of Texas will con
duct a novel form of practice teaching
during the summer. Experts will teach
grammar grades in one of the Univer
sity buildings and student teachers
will witness the proceedure from
seats in the back of the room.
