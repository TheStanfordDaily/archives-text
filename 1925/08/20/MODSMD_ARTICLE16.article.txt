# SUMMER SQUASH
## 
### A. G. D 
Tragedy reared its gory head on the
quiet Stanford campus last Friday
night when a double murder stained
the steps of the Stanford Museum. The
deed of passion, replte with the most
unsavory details, was committed with
in the doors of the building while a
gang of accomplices disguised as old
men and young girls held at bay the
crowd which gathered at the sound
of the alarm.
The victims of this sordid domestic
triangle—or rather quadrangle, for
four persons were implicated—are
Agamemnon P. McAtreus and a woman
clairvoyant giving her name as Cas
sandra. The Cassandra woman is "the
woman in the case" and the whole
cause of the trouble, according to Mrs.
Clytemnestra McAtreus, the wife and
slayer of the murdered pair. This con
dition would seem common enough in
the general run of domestic murders
in these days, but there is an added
complication in the person of a man
going by the name of Aegisthos J.
O'Thyestes, who is being sought on a
charge of complicity.
After committing the deed, the mur
deress and her accomplice calmly es
caped without pursuit, although it is
said that several officers of the police
j force were in the crowd which gath
ered at the spot.
All the principals in this odious af
fair are of Greek nationality, and it is
believed that their home is in Argos
in that country. No arrests have yet
been made.

Our Carnival of Crime
The shocking affray of last Friday
night is one of the most calculated and
cruel conspiracies ever witnessed in
the annals of our fair city. Yet still
more shocking is the absolute incom
petency and cool disregard of duty
displayed;by our grossly inefficient
police force. The murder was commit
ted early in the evening and within
earshot of a large crowd of people.
The criminals were permitted to es
cape and are still at large. No Ameri
can home is safe. A precedent of dis
regard for law and order is thus
created; criminals do not fear the re
sults of their most atrocious acts. How
can we expect our wives to abstain
from wielding the lethal butcher-knife
upon us when such a crime is allowed
to go unpunished by society? Just what
all this has to do, however, with Pro
hibition, the Mellon Plan, the Chinese
situation, or the Republican Party, we
really don't know.

"Give a sentence with the word —"
Sequoia. "Sequoia will, you won't
find me."
Union. "I spoke to Union ever no

Toyon. "Hitch up this rope and I'll
Toyon home."
Encina. "We watched her Encina
do it."
Roble. "I'd hate to live on the Roble
've me!"
Branner. "My horse won't eat Bran
ner corn."
Kingscote. "The Kingscote had egg
stains on the front."
Tragedy reared its gory head on the
quiet Stanford campus last Friday
night when a double murder stained
the steps of the Stanford Museum. The
deed of passion, replte with the most
unsavory details, was committed with
in the doors of the building while a
gang of accomplices disguised as old
men and young girls held at bay the
crowd which gathered at the sound
of the alarm.
The victims of this sordid domestic
triangle—or rather quadrangle, for
four persons were implicated—are
Agamemnon P. McAtreus and a woman
clairvoyant giving her name as Cas
sandra. The Cassandra woman is "the
woman in the case" and the whole
cause of the trouble, according to Mrs.
Clytemnestra McAtreus, the wife and
slayer of the murdered pair. This con
dition would seem common enough in
the general run of domestic murders
in these days, but there is an added
complication in the person of a man
going by the name of Aegisthos J.
O'Thyestes, who is being sought on a
charge of complicity.
After committing the deed, the mur
deress and her accomplice calmly es
caped without pursuit, although it is
said that several officers of the police
j force were in the crowd which gath
ered at the spot.
All the principals in this odious af
fair are of Greek nationality, and it is
believed that their home is in Argos
in that country. No arrests have yet
been made.

Our Carnival of Crime
The shocking affray of last Friday
night is one of the most calculated and
cruel conspiracies ever witnessed in
the annals of our fair city. Yet still
more shocking is the absolute incom
petency and cool disregard of duty
displayed;by our grossly inefficient
police force. The murder was commit
ted early in the evening and within
earshot of a large crowd of people.
The criminals were permitted to es
cape and are still at large. No Ameri
can home is safe. A precedent of dis
regard for law and order is thus
created; criminals do not fear the re
sults of their most atrocious acts. How
can we expect our wives to abstain
from wielding the lethal butcher-knife
upon us when such a crime is allowed
to go unpunished by society? Just what
all this has to do, however, with Pro
