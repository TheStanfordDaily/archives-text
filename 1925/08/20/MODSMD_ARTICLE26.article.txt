# NEW RULE DECREASES LAW ENROLLMENT
## 
### 
Stanford's Law School is already be
ginning to feel the pinch of the "gradu
ate rule" which will not be in full ef
fect for three years, according to a
statement issued by Dean R. M. Kirk
wood this week. The Law School, while
showing a small gain in students this
summer over the previous period, has
not maintained a proportionate growth
with the rest of the University depart
ments.
The "graduate rule" passed by the
Board of Trustees in June last year
provides that an A.B. degree should
thereafter be required for admission.
Those students who were registered in
the University prior to October 1,
1925, can enter the law school as
juniors.
