Present plans made by the editorial
staff call for a book of not less than
480 pages, with the major art work by
Pedro J. Lemos, director of the Stan
ford Art Gallery, Delmer L. Daves,
and Bertrand Langton, a San Fran
cisco artist. Better paper is being
used than that in last year's Quad,
•while the style of printing will also
be changed. The aggregate cost of the
entire book will probably be around
$20,000.
At the present time all the contracts
for the book have been let except the
contract for printing. The engraving,
which will cost over $5,000, will be
handled by the Sierra Art and Engrav
ing Co., while the covers are being
done by the Weber, McCrea Co. of
Los Angeles.
Tryouts for the editorial staff of the
Quad will be opened with a meeting
of all prospective tryoutees Monday
afternoon at 2:00 in the Quad office in
the Administration building, according
t.o an announcement made today by
Basil L. McGann, the editor.
Several salaried positions on the
Quad are open each year. Tryoutees
for the photographic department are
especially needed. The Quad will fur
nish the use of its own cameras to
competitors.
Prizes will be offered this year for
the best camera study, best poetry,
the best idea for a feature, and other
subjects to be announced later. Compe
tition for these will be open to all
students in the University, whether or
not they are trying out for the Quad.
The editorial staff of the Quad is
so far composed of Basil L. McGann,
editor; Wallace W. Knox and Marjorie
Allen, associate editors; Allene
Thorpe, women's editor; John N. Levi,
athletic editor; Delmer L. Daves, art
editor; and William Winn, photogra
phic editor.
The Quad this year will be called
the Stanford Quad, Volume 33, as this
is the first year in which the annual
is published by the Associated Stu
dents. Heretofore the year book has
been owned by the junior class, and
has been known by the numeral of the
class which publishes it. In order that
two annuals will not be called the
1926 Quad, the book this year is to be
known by the volume number.
