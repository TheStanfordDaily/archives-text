# STANFORD TENNIS MEN RETURN WITH NATIONAL HONORS
## 
### 
Stanford tennis players figured
prominently in tournaments of nation
al importance during the summer
months and returned with a state and
a national title to their credit.
Cranston Holman, vanquisher of Wil
liam Tilden, world's champion, in an
exhibition match held in the middle
west, proved himself to be the best
of the junior players, winning the na
lonal junior singles title, in a tourna
ment held in Chicago in August.
Earlier in the summer he lost the na
tional intercollegiate singles champion
ship to Edward Chandler of the Uni
versity of California in a brilliant
match. Holman defeated Chandler in
the California-Stanford matches earlier
in the spring.
The National Tennis Association in
vited him to try out for the Davis Cup
team, and due to his showing, he now
looms as one of the nation's first ten
ranking players. Among other tourna
ments won by Holman is the Massa
chusetts invitational tournament when,
paired with Lewis White of Texas, he
defeated Arnold Jones of Yale and
William Ingraham of Harvard in the
finals, 6-2, 4-6, 7-5, 6-0.
Another outstanding performer was
Ralph McElvenny of last year's fresh
man team who won the Colorado state
singles championship. McElvenny
figured prominently in a number of
Rocky Mountain States tournaments.
Alan Herrington won a Los Angeles
city title, and was a prominent par
ticipant in Southern California and
Bay City tourneys.
Lionel Ogden, captain of the 1926
varsity tennis team, accompanied Hol
man on his eastern trip, and the two
were paired in the national intercolle
! giate doubles matches.
