# HEALTH INSURANCE PLAN WILL BENEFIT STUDENTS
## 
### 
(Editor's note â€”The following ex
planatlon of the new regulations for
the Student's Hospital Fund was pre
pared by Dr. W. H. Barrow, director
of Encina gymnasium).

There will be a substantial increase
in the benefits to students during the
coming year from the Students' Hos
pital Fund. This fund is in the nature
of health insurance to which each stu
dent pays two dollars a quarter, this
amount being included in the inci
dental fee. In the event that a student
is taken ill and is admitted to the hos
pital, four dollars a day of the usual
five dollar ward hospital charge will
be paid for the first week, instead of
the two dollars a day, that has been
paid in the past. In addition to this,
the cost of the physician's routine
visits for the first week >1 a patient in
the hospital, not to exceed *15, is paid
from the fund, so that the expense to
the student for the ward rate will be
only one dollar a day, which is ordi
narily what he would pay for his board
outside. Since nine out of ten students
admitted to the hospital are there for

less than a week, this will completely
protect the average student from the
usual severe expense of hospitaliza
tion.
This increase in benefits has been
made possible by the fact that health
conditions on the campus have been
unusually good during the past few
years, so that the consequent drain
on the fund has been less. If there is
no great increase in the number of
admissions to the hospital from an
epidemic or increased sick rate, the
schedule of benefits as noted can be
continued.
For the present the following
charges will be paid by the Student
Hospital Fund:
1. Four dollars a day toward the
regular hospital fee for the first seven
days, and two dollars a day there
after.
2. Charges for doctor's visits for one
week, this charge not to exceed fifteen
dollars. (Charges for calls at a doc
tor's office or for visits by a doctor to
the patient's home are not paid from
the fund.)
3. Twenty-five per cent of the charge
for an operation (this amount not to
exceed twenty-five dollars).
4. X-ray and laboratory fees for pur
poses of diagnosis, charges for the
use of the operating room and for
anaesthetics, and charges for the ap
plication of casts.
The above charges are paid only in
the event of a student's being admitted
to a hospital. Students are reminded
that they may be admitted to the hos
pital only on the order of the Medical
Adviser, or of one of the local physi
cians.
