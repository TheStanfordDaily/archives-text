# DR. JORDAN ATTENDS PAN-PACIFIC UNION CONCLAVE IN HAWAII
## 
### 
Dr. Jordan is in the Hawaiian
Islands for a six weeks' stay in con
nection with his work in the Pan-
Pacific union. He is attending the con
vention of the Pacific Fisheries Asso
ciation and assisting in the work of
organizing the Pan-Pacific Research
Institution. These two movements are
sponsored by the Pan-Pacific Union,
an organization supported in part by
government appropriations which are
directed by representatives of all Pa
cific races. It has for its purpose the
friendly co-operation of all Pacific na
tions in matters of common interest.
As honorary president of the Pacific
Fisheries Association, Dr. Jordan has
taken an active part in furthering the
work of this body. Some years ago,
when the Hawaiian Islands were thick
ly infested by mosquitos, he introduced
a species of mosquito feeding fish into
the afflicted regions. So well did this
experiment succeed that the islands
are now practically devoid of mosqui
tos. Through the work of the Fisheries
Association in the protection of sea
animals and fish the herds of seals in
the Pacific ocean have increased since
1910 from 140,000 to 700,000.
Dr. Jordan, accompanied by his wife
and Dr. and Mrs. Everman of San
Francisco, left the United States in
the middle of last month on the liner
"Maui," and will probably return late
in November.
