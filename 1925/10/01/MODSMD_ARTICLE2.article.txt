# New Students Number 661
## Lower Total Than Year Ago Six Frosh Report at 5 a. m. 
### 
A total of 948 old and new students
completed their registration by 5 p.m.
yesterday. Six hundred and sixty-one
students registered between 8 a.m. and
3 p.m. From that time on registration
was given over to old students. This
is less than the registration for the
first day last year, which came to 1227.
The application lists were full, how
ever, for lower division men and
women.
Several freshmen took to heart the
adage that the early bird gets the
worm, six appearing at 5 a.m. in front
of the Administration building. The
compassionate janitor let them in, but
when they still kept flocking in from
six o'clock on, he decided to close
the doors. The lines were pretty Well
thinned out by nine o'clock, with the
exception of the citizenship line, which
was still gathering this morning. Regis
tration of old students will continue
today.
