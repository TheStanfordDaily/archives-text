The Stanford football team met a 9 'to 0 defeat in its first clash of
the season. To those who saw the game last Saturday no explanation
is necessary. The varsity bit off more than it could swallow after only
nine days of practice. While most of the conference teams were trampling
over small college aggregations the Cards were trying to hold off the
strongest team the Olympic Club has had in years. It just couldn't be
done, that's all. Weight, brains, and experience must always win from
weight, brains, and inexperience.
Norman Cleaveland, Harry Shipkey, "Scotchy" Campbell, Jack Pat
rick, "Moose" Fawke, "Rabbit" Bradshaw, "Buck" Bailey, and the
others on that Olympic Club team, have been stars for many years.
They are not old yet and they still have the zealous enthusiasm for the
game that made them dreaded when they were college satellites. The
Stanford squad had only three veteran regulars—the others have the
latent ability but they lack the experience to make early-season winners
against men of recognized power. Neither team showed much offensive
drive, and the score should have been 0 to o—a few Stanford mistakes
that can be attached to inexperience gave the Olympians their touchdown
and place kick.
The Olympic Club defeat is a bitter dish in a way —it removes the
possibility of Stanford going undefeated this year. But having a hard
game to begin with is of untold value, because it shows the coaches
exactly what is necessary to strengthen the squad. Little flaws that
would lie unnoticeable against a weak team stand out in glaring boldness
when made against a combination like the Olympic Club. "Pop" Warner
now has his work clear-cut before him.
We can consider the Olympic Club game as a lesson learned without
cost. Stanford's standing in the conference is by no means impaired by
the loss. Victories over U. S. C., Washington, and California, plus the
■coast title, are the things that really count —and they are by no means
impossible.
The present varsity has a world of strength, requiring hard work and
experience to bring it to the light. After a defeat the hard work is
bound to come easier, and there are eight games remaining before the
California clash during which the experience can be gained. Stanford
will beat California. And that is no klle boast. The Redshirts tackle
U. S. C. on the third Saturday—that is hardly time for the players to
evolve into a smooth-working machine. Still, Warner's men are bound
to make a creditable showing even at that early date.
With capable material, a coaching staff that is of the best, and a few
weeks of practice, the 1924 varsity is going to l>e dangerous and a
powerful contender for the Pacific Coast Conference championship.
Let's put the Olympic Club defeat behind as a lesson learned, and then
start watching the Stanford varsity become dangerous.

impossible.
The present varsity has a world of strength, requiring hard work and
experience to bring it to the light. After a defeat the hard work is
bound to come easier, and there are eight games remaining before the
California clash during which the experience can be gained. Stanford
will beat California. And that is no klle boast. The Redshirts tackle
U. S. C. on the third Saturday—that is hardly time for the players to
evolve into a smooth-working machine. Still, Warner's men are bound
to make a creditable showing even at that early date.
With capable material, a coaching staff that is of the best, and a few
weeks of practice, the 1924 varsity is going to l>e dangerous and a
powerful contender for the Pacific Coast Conference championship.
Let's put the Olympic Club defeat behind as a lesson learned, and then
start watching the Stanford varsity become dangerous.
The season isn't over yet.
The Stanford football team met a 9 'to 0 defeat in its first clash of
the season. To those who saw the game last Saturday no explanation
is necessary. The varsity bit off more than it could swallow after only
nine days of practice. While most of the conference teams were trampling
over small college aggregations the Cards were trying to hold off the
strongest team the Olympic Club has had in years. It just couldn't be
done, that's all. Weight, brains, and experience must always win from
weight, brains, and inexperience.
Norman Cleaveland, Harry Shipkey, "Scotchy" Campbell, Jack Pat
rick, "Moose" Fawke, "Rabbit" Bradshaw, "Buck" Bailey, and the
others on that Olympic Club team, have been stars for many years.
They are not old yet and they still have the zealous enthusiasm for the
game that made them dreaded when they were college satellites. The
Stanford squad had only three veteran regulars—the others have the
latent ability but they lack the experience to make early-season winners
against men of recognized power. Neither team showed much offensive
drive, and the score should have been 0 to o—a few Stanford mistakes
that can be attached to inexperience gave the Olympians their touchdown
and place kick.
The Olympic Club defeat is a bitter dish in a way —it removes the
possibility of Stanford going undefeated this year. But having a hard
game to begin with is of untold value, because it shows the coaches
exactly what is necessary to strengthen the squad. Little flaws that
would lie unnoticeable against a weak team stand out in glaring boldness
when made against a combination like the Olympic Club. "Pop" Warner
now has his work clear-cut before him.
We can consider the Olympic Club game as a lesson learned without
cost. Stanford's standing in the conference is by no means impaired by
the loss. Victories over U. S. C., Washington, and California, plus the
■coast title, are the things that really count —and they are by no means
impossible.
