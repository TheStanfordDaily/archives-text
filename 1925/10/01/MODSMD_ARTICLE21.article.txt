John Levi today becomes Managing Editor of the Daily Palo Alto.
He has been a member of the staff for two years, has served in all
positions on the paper, and leaves his place as news editor to assume his
new duties. His time will be devoted chiefly to the mechanical part of
the paper, although he will also supervise the news gathering and write
some editorials. In addition to his work at Stanford, Levi 'has been
editor of the University of California Southern Branch Grizzly, a posi
tion which he held last summer.
Allene Thorpe has been appointed Women's Editor. Miss Thorpe is
undoubtedly the most outstanding woman journalist on the campus and
the DaiHy is fortunate to have her in this role. Besides holding the
highest woman's position on the Daily, Miss Thorpe is Women's Editor
of the Quad, and an honorary member of Hammer and Coffin. She was
publicity director for the U. C. S. B. during the summer.
Stanford sports will be capably directed by Wilbur Adams, who today
becomes Sporting Editor. Adams has been on the Daily staff for three
quarters, during which period he has had wide experience in the different
branches of the reportorial field. His intimate knowledge of sports is
shown by his record while at Stanford. He starred at end on the 1927
freshman grid team, and was a crack sprinter, winning the 220-yard
dash and tying for first in the century in the meet with the California
freshmen.
Adams and three others have been named to rank as news editors.
The others are Dudley Ross, Douglas Meservey, and Fred Speers. These
men were given their positions entirely on a basis of seniority and merit.
Their work as reporters last year was unexcelled.
A West Virginia Wesleyan professor has discovered a new method
of cribbing employed by co-eds. Girls wearing thin, flesh-colored stock
ings had written on their ankles notes which were legible when the
fabric was drawn tight. At least that is one thing the Stanford five hun
dred does not have to do.
"Four persons, overcome by fumes of wine, met death today by
drowning in a wine vat here," says a dispatch from Avignon, France.
Lucky Frenchmen! Even Omar Khayyam would have enjoyed a death
like that. And the poor Americans must have their epithets like this:
"Four persons killed by wood alcohol in bootleg whiskey."
