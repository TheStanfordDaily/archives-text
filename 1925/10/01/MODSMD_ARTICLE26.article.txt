# NEW ORDNANCE UNIT ADDED TO STANFORD MILITARY DIVISION
## 
### 
The Department of Military Science
and Tactics at Stanford has been en
larged by the addition of an Ordnance
Unit for the training of engineering
and chemistry students for commis
sions as second lieutenants in Ord
nance Reserve Corps. This important
department of the army requires men
with considerable technical knowledge
in these sciences. Captain Frank J.
Atwood, who has been detailed to take
charge of the new unit, is exception
ally qualified by training and experi
ence for the work.
Engineering and chemistry students
are eligible for the Ordnance Unit of
the Stanford R. O. T. C., but for them
the work required to win a commis
sion is only a slight addition to their
regular courses, since a considerable
part of it is either practically the same
as required subjects or somewhat spe
cialized application of those subjects.
All the special courses have a prac
tical value in civilian as well as mili
tary practice.
For admission to the advanced
course Ordnance students must take
the basic military course during their
lirst two years in the University. This
course is identical with that of the
Field Artillery unit which has been
in operation at Stanford for several
years with increasing enrollment. Stu
dents who have taken four years of
It. O. T. C. work in high school or who
have had the basic course in some
other university may offer this train
ing as a substitute for the basic course
from the physical training work other
wise required of every student in his
lirst two years.
The Ordnance Unit courses are di
vided into two general groups: one
for engineering students and one for
chemistry students, with some courses
required of all.
The Ordnance Department is the
manufacturing branch of the army and
calls for men with engineering or
chemical ability. It has charge of the
"various arsenals of the service where
a wide variety of instruments and
material is designed and manufactured
and where experimental work in ex
plosives and other material is carried
on. The work of the Ordnance Depart
ment deals not only with guns, fire
arms and ammunition, as is popularly
supposed, but includes also the design
and manufacture of gun carriages, in
cluding the railroad mounts of great
siege guns and of heavy cost defense
guns, tractors, and tanks, even the
harness used for horses and mules, as
"well as all sorts of optical instruments
such as binoculars, range-finders, and

other intricate mechanisms connected
with artillery practice.
Captain Atwood has been detailed at
several arsenals and comes to Stan
ford from the great Frankford Arsenal
in Philadelphia, where for two years I
he has been engaged in fire control .
design work. He received most of his |
university training at the University
of Michigan, where he received his B.S.
degree. In addition to this Captain [
Atwood was granted an A.B. degree j
at Washington State College and has j
also taken a special ordnance course j
at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. He entered the army from j
civilian life in 1916 upon examination:
for a commission. During the World :
j War he saw service overseas with the I
artillery.
Details of the courses in the Ord- ;
j nance Unit have been posted in the!
I Engineering and Chemistry buildings j
! and are available at Captain Atwood's '
] office, which is temporarily in Room
551 of the Mining and Metallurgy
| building.

For the first time since its adoption j
three years ago, all classes of Dart- !
mouth are products of the selective j
process of admission. The present j
seniors are the, first ones to enter
under the new system.
