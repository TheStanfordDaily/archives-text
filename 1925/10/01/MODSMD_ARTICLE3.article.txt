# STRICT ADHERENCE TO RUSHING RULES ORDERED BY BOARD
## List of Transfers Eligible for Pledging Will Be Issued Monday 
### 
Although no definite rushing rules
for the coming year have yet been
adopted by the Interfraternity Council,
President Frank A. Frye announced
today that there is to be no rushing of
new students during the coming week
end. A list of eligible junior and senior
transfers will be given out at the
Interfraternity Council meeting Mon
day night at 9 o'clock in the Old
Union.
Regular rushing and pledging of
freshmen will again be held in the
spring quarter as was done last year
though the date will be about two
weeks earlier. The season may be
shortened by a few days. The card
system used last year will be again
used although details will be deter
mined early in the spring.
Fraternity men must get permission
from either sponsors or the president
of the Interfraternity Council to go
into Encina hall.
Junior and senior transfers to be
eligible for rushing at a date to be
announced Monday night must have
ninety hours or more. Any violations
of the rushing rules should be re
ported by mail to Professor William
B. Owen.
Two nominations for the board of
control are to be made at Monday's
meeting.
