## WEAKNESS OF CARDS SHOWN IN FIRST TILT Coach Warner Shifts Several New Men To First String Squad In Practice This Week 
### Wilbur Adams 
LAST Saturday a brand new Stanford team, after only ten days' practice, met
eleven veteran football men, who had already played three contests this
year. The result was a 9 to 0 victory for the Olympic Club, and a practice
for Stanford which has helped the Cardinal coaching staff more than any
number of easy games could have done.
In previous years, the seasons were opened against navy teams that
neither possessed the material nor the condition to give Stanford a real fight.
The college men naturally appeared good against their weak opponents, but
the only ones to receive a workout from these matches were the referees and
the scorekeepers. The coaches could learn nothing about the quality of their
plays or players from such games.
The Olympic Club was probably the strongest combination that the Stanford
varsity will meet all season. A line made up of men such as Bailey, Daley,

Harry Shipkey, Stanley, and Locey
could not be bettered by any college
team in the country. Campbell, Cleave
land, Fawke, Patrick, and Bradsliaw
are backfleld men that have but few
equals. And yet Stanford would have
played these stars to a scoreless tie if
it had not been for a few unfortunate
passes from center, plus some costly
fumbles with several penalties thrown
in.
Weak Spots Found Early
By playing a team like the Olympic
Club for the first contest, Pop Warner
is able to find out the weak points
right at the start, and before it is too
late to correct them. As it is now, the
coaches have three weeks to smooth
out the rough places before meeting
U. S. C. in the first Conference game.
Santa Clara and Occidental will make
up the opposition for the next two
weeks, and each succeeding Saturday
will be marked by a decided improve
ment in Stanford's football machine.
Freeman Looks Good
The game against the clubmen
brought out several new men of worth,
The playing of Freeman at tackle was
the most noticeable thing in the line
Saturday. Freeman is a new man at
Stanford, having transferred from
Bakersfleld Junior College this fall. He
is heavy and fast, but most of all, he
has the football fight which is so
necessary a quality in a lineman. Last
Saturday he was used as a substitute,
but this week Warner has placed him
in the right tackle position where he
will start the game against Santa
Clara. Eli Post of last year's freshman
eleven played good football when he
was used against the clubmen. Post
started the season at guard but be
cause of the need of tackftes he was
shifted out a notch on the line.
McCreery Offense Weak
On the defense McCreery looked like
a find at center, coming out of the line
time after time to break up the
Olympic Club plays. One time in par
ticular last Saturday McCreery pulled
out of the line to run back just in time
to break up one of the Club's forward
passes. McCreery's passing on the of
fense was not accurate and poor cen
tering was one of the reasons that the
Stanford backfleld did not show better
in the contest Saturday. McCreery
was given an ovation by the clubmen
when he was sent into the game, for
he has been the Olympic's center for
