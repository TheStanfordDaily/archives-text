# AUSTRALIA WANTS NEW INTERNATIONAL ATHLETIC AGREEMENT
## 
### 
Suggestion of an athletic union be
tween several Australian and Pacific
Coast universities was made recently
by Dr. Leslie Utz of Sidney, Australia,
who visited the campus last August.
His plan was to have the following
universities in the conference: Stan
ford, California, Southern California,
Melbourne, Sidney, Wellington, and
Queensland.
Harry Maloney expressed the opin
ion that the greatest difficulty in the
path of such a union is the great ex
pense of sending teams across the
Pacific. In Australia a sinking fund has
already been started to defray possible
losses on the trips.
President Wilbur, while favoring the
plan for the closer relationship it
would bring between the universities
of the two continents, feared that the
length of the trips would interfere too
greatly with studies.
The Australian universities do not
have basketball nor American foot
ball teams but could offer competition
in all the minor sports.
