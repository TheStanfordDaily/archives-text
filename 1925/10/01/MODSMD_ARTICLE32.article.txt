# HANK MILLAGE OUT OF GAME FOR YEAR
## 
### 
An injury sustained last year has
forced Hank Millage, star fullback of
the 1928 babe football squad, from this
season's varsity squad. Millage re
ported for practice the first day, and
until scrimmage was held his old in
jury did not seem to trouble him in
the least.
However, after a few days of line
bucking his knee, which is the source
of his trouble, went back on him. Had
Millage been able to keep up with his
work he no doubt would have been
first substitute fullback.
