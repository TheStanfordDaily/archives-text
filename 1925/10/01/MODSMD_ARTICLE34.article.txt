# HONEY ON YEAR LEAVE OF ABSENCE
## Former Minor Sports Head Will Study Medicine At Lane Hospital 
### 
Harry W. Maloney, associate athletic
director of Stanford and also coach of
many of the minor sports, who is now
on a year's leave of absence to study
medicine at the Lane Medical School,
was chosen president of the Pacific
division of the A. A. U. at a recent
election of the organization. Maloney,
who is also head of the California
Football Association, has long been a
popular figure in Coast amateur ath
letics.
At Stanford, Maloney has done much
to promote international amateur ath
letics. Last year he took the tennis
team to Australia for a series of
matches. He has a nation-wide reputa
tion for his various coaching abilities.
Arrangements have recently been
completed between Maloney and R. H.
Woodward, official of the Vancouver
Rugby Union, for a team of picked
Stanford men to go to Vancouver dur
ing the Christmas holidays. The team
will be coached by Maloney, and will
play the various teams of the Van
couver union. It will be composed
largely of members of the 1924 Olym
pic team. Patrick, Campbell, and De-
Groot, three former Stanford football
captains, will probably be among those
to make the trip.
What Maloney intends to do upon
the expiration of his leave is unknown,
and no one has been appointed to fill
his place during his leave. Student
coaches will probably take charge of
the many sports which were under his
coaching.
