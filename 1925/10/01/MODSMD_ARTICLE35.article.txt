# Myrra Breaks World's Javelin Throw Record
## 
### 
Jonni Myrra broke his own world's
record in the javelin throw Sunday
when he hurled the spear 224 feet 11
inches at the Finnish Brotherhood
games in San Francisco.
The former record of 216 feet 10 3-4
inches was made in 1919. Myrra has
been competing for the Olympic Club
this year and gave an exhibition at
Stanford. The new record throw will
probably be allowed, as Pacific Athletic
Association officials were in charge of
the meet.
