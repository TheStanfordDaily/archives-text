# NINE LETTER MEN RETURN FOR FIRST SOCCER PRACTICE
## 
### 
With practice now well under way,
Stanford soccer men are prophesying
a successful year for the Cardinal
eleven. Nine letter men and three
strong' men from the '28 frosli team
are fighting hard for permanent berths
on the varsity team.
Franklin, varsity captain, Rogers,
Schoen, Miron, Baillard, Bushnell,
Richardson, Forest, and Moy are the
veterans who have returned for an
other year of play. Holmes, Strowger,
and Rivero are the three '28 men who
are at present making the best show
ing on the field.
The loss of Howe and Clark from
the backfield is one which is difficult
to fill, but Clark is carrying on his
work by coaching the squad in the
absence of Harry Maloney. Schoen
seems to be making the strongest bid
for Clark's old position.
At present, Miron, Baillard, Moy, and
Strowger appear to have the call on
the forward positions, and would form
an exceptionally fast line. The halves
will probably be Bushnell, Cannon,
and Franklin. Holmes and Schoen are
the two who seem most sure of back
field positions.
Stanford's first game in the Univer
sity and Club League will be played
against the Teutonics Saturday. Cali
fornia boasts of a very strong team
this year, having many veterans. The
Olympic Club, winners last year, will
also have a strong team. Despite this
opposition the Stanford men are con
fident that they will be able to make
a respectable showing in the league.
The Cardinals, although not as heavy
as some of their opponents, have an
unusually fast team, which should
overcome the handicap in weight.
