## 
### Harry Frishman 
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA,
Sept. 30. â€”Injuries sustained by Cup
tain "Tut" lmlay last Saturday in the
California-Santa Clara game are not
as serious as was first suspected.
There is a possibility that he will be
! in the starting lineup when the Bruins
i take the field against Nevada on Octo-
I her 3.
While returning a punt in the last
; few minutes of the second quarter,
lmlay was tackled and Injured to such
; an extent as to necessitate his being
! carried from the field. An ambulanue
| was called and he was taken to the
i Berkeley hospital where an X-ray
showed that no bones had been broken.
! Muscles in his back and hip were se-
I verely wrenched and proved to be very
' painful but not serious.
The doctor in charge stated that he
will be able to resume his work on the
field within a week or ten days, with a
possibility of entering next Saturday's
tilt. Unless he is in the best of condi
| tion lmlay will watch the game from
j the bench, as Andy Smith is taking
| no chances of his returning to the field
until his injuries have been thoroughly
j cured.
Captain Imlay's injury gave several
|of the second varsity a chance to get
into the game, some of whom demon
strated exceptional ability. Paul Per
rin, who won fame at Lodi High
School, was the most outstanding of
the substitutes. Intercepting a pass in
the third quarter, Perrin, by brilliant
1 open field running, raced forty yards
to a touchdown. Once again in the
fourth quarter he all but got away
on a short end run for another touch
down. Charles Willi and "Brick" Mar
cuz, two new men, also proved their
I worth.
