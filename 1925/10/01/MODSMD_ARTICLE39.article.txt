# SAN MATEO NEXT ON BABE SCHEDULE
## U. S. S. Idaho Defeated 6 to 0 In Opening Game of 1925 Season 
### Fred Speers 
With a 6-0 victory over the U. S. S.
Idaho team tucked behind it the fresh
man eleven is pointing to Saturday's
game with the San Mateo Junior Col
lege team. The freshmen went well in
their initial game but lacked an effec
tive offense.
Wilton, Cardinal babe halfback, tear
ing off a 48-yard run around right end,
gave Sims the opportunity to go over
for the first touchdown of the season.
The line played a consistently good
game and, if Coach Hunt wisheß to
have an average of 200 pounds per
man on his primary defense, the ma
terial is waiting for him.
Two games face the freshman squad
next Saturday when Potter Tech
meets the frosh second team at 10*
a.m., and San Mateo Junior College
the first eleven at 1 p.m. The Califor
nia freshmen defeated San Mateo last
Saturday, 20 to 10.
Linemen looking well for the fresh
men are Doyle of Berkeley, who tips
the scales at 230, Ingram of Palo Alto,
registering 218 and out for a guard
berth, Artman, of Long Beach, a 215-
pound tackle, and Vermilya at center.
Hunt has not yet determined his
regular ends though the wingmen who
started last Saturday's game, Harder
and Lewis, worked well together.
When the offensive power of the backs
reaches its highest point the fresh
men will have a fast end-running set
of men with a possible heavy fullback.
probably either Marks or Smalling for
line smuslies.
Ray Hulen, playing tackle, was cap
tain of the Long Beach High team
last season and has had plenty of
football experience. During the time
he was in last Saturday he showed to
good advantage. Simms, also of Long
Beach, played most of the game at half
and went through the left side of the
line consistently for five or six yards.
San Mateo Junior College has an ex
ceptionally good team this year,
though it was weakened two weeks
ago when Altaft'er of last year's fresh
men, took out a leave. In the game
with the California freshmen last week
they really expected to win, but the
Bruins proved too much for them in
the last few moments, winning 20 to
10. Nevertheless, they are conceded
a good chance to defeat the Cardinal
babes this week.
The freshman second team has some
likely prospects and is working under
the direction of Coach Myron Sprague.
The squad is rather light but fairly
experienced. On the other hand Potter
Tech rates as a good high school team,
and the babe goofs will have plenty of
work on hand to defeat them.

the University of Missouri, was

Tigers have carried off honors in this
competition.
With a 6-0 victory over the U. S. S.
Idaho team tucked behind it the fresh
man eleven is pointing to Saturday's
game with the San Mateo Junior Col
lege team. The freshmen went well in
their initial game but lacked an effec
tive offense.
Wilton, Cardinal babe halfback, tear
ing off a 48-yard run around right end,
gave Sims the opportunity to go over
for the first touchdown of the season.
The line played a consistently good
game and, if Coach Hunt wisheß to
have an average of 200 pounds per
man on his primary defense, the ma
terial is waiting for him.
Two games face the freshman squad
next Saturday when Potter Tech
meets the frosh second team at 10*
a.m., and San Mateo Junior College
the first eleven at 1 p.m. The Califor
nia freshmen defeated San Mateo last
Saturday, 20 to 10.
Linemen looking well for the fresh
men are Doyle of Berkeley, who tips
the scales at 230, Ingram of Palo Alto,
registering 218 and out for a guard
berth, Artman, of Long Beach, a 215-
pound tackle, and Vermilya at center.
Hunt has not yet determined his
regular ends though the wingmen who
started last Saturday's game, Harder
and Lewis, worked well together.
When the offensive power of the backs
reaches its highest point the fresh
men will have a fast end-running set
of men with a possible heavy fullback.
probably either Marks or Smalling for
line smuslies.
Ray Hulen, playing tackle, was cap
tain of the Long Beach High team
last season and has had plenty of
football experience. During the time
he was in last Saturday he showed to
good advantage. Simms, also of Long
Beach, played most of the game at half
and went through the left side of the
line consistently for five or six yards.
San Mateo Junior College has an ex
ceptionally good team this year,
though it was weakened two weeks
ago when Altaft'er of last year's fresh
men, took out a leave. In the game
with the California freshmen last week
they really expected to win, but the
Bruins proved too much for them in
the last few moments, winning 20 to
10. Nevertheless, they are conceded
a good chance to defeat the Cardinal
babes this week.
The freshman second team has some
likely prospects and is working under
the direction of Coach Myron Sprague.
The squad is rather light but fairly
experienced. On the other hand Potter
Tech rates as a good high school team,
and the babe goofs will have plenty of
work on hand to defeat them.

"The Savitar," annual publication of
the University of Missouri, was
awarded first place in the national
contest for college annuals during the
past summer. It is the third time the
Tigers have carried off honors in this
competition.
