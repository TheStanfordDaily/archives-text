# SAN MATEO NEXT ON BABE SCHEDULE
## U. S. S. Idaho Defeated 6 to 0 In Opening Game of 1925 Season 
### Fred Speers 
With a 6-0 victory over the U. S. S.
Idaho team tucked behind it the fresh
man eleven is pointing to Saturday's
game with the San Mateo Junior Col
lege team. The freshmen went well in
their initial game but lacked an effec
tive offense.
Wilton, Cardinal babe halfback, tear
ing off a 48-yard run around right end,
gave Sims the opportunity to go over
for the first touchdown of the season.
The line played a consistently good
game and, if Coach Hunt wisheß to
have an average of 200 pounds per
man on his primary defense, the ma
terial is waiting for him.
Two games face the freshman squad
next Saturday when Potter Tech
meets the frosh second team at 10*
a.m., and San Mateo Junior College
the first eleven at 1 p.m. The Califor
nia freshmen defeated San Mateo last
Saturday, 20 to 10.
Linemen looking well for the fresh
men are Doyle of Berkeley, who tips
the scales at 230, Ingram of Palo Alto,
registering 218 and out for a guard
berth, Artman, of Long Beach, a 215-
pound tackle, and Vermilya at center.
Hunt has not yet determined his
regular ends though the wingmen who
started last Saturday's game, Harder
and Lewis, worked well together.
When the offensive power of the backs
reaches its highest point the fresh
men will have a fast end-running set
of men with a possible heavy fullback.
