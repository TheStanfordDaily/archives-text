### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
As the 1925 world series approaches at a rapid pace, let us pry into the
past, where the busts of former world series heroes lay covered with dust, and
exhume for the moment, the smiling countenances of "Home Run" Baker and
"Casey" Stengel.
In the 1911 world series between the Athletics and the Giants, Rube Mar
quard, one of McGraw's aces, was pitching against Connie Mack's stars in the
second game, on October 1(5. J. Franklin Baker, Philadelphia third baseman,
hit a home run which helped the Athletics win, 3 to 1. Christy Mathewson,
in his daily article in a New York paper, said that Marquard should never have
pitched that kind of a ball to Baker.
The next day it was Matty's turn to pitch and this time Baker won the
game, 3to 2, with another home run. Marquard, who was also writing news
paper accounts of the series, said that Christy evidently knew what he was
writing about the day before, as he had pitched the same kind of a ball to
Baker. Baker won another game from the Giants with a home run in the
1913 series.
The veteran "Casey" Stengel, Giant centerfielder, jumped into fame on
October 10, 1923, when, with two out in the ninth inning and two strikes on
him, he hit a home run inside the Yankee Stadium, which won the first
game of the world series for the Giants. Old Casey barely staggered across
the plate in time. Then in the third game, two days later, he again won for
his team with a wallop that sailed over the right field fence in the same
park. As he trotted around the bases, he gave the well known "Cuban
President Salute" to Pitcher "Sad Sam" Jones.
