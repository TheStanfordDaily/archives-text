Maybe you remember Uncle John?
He drove a 'bus from "Paly" to the
campus back in post-earthquake days
and regaled wide-eared freshmen with
certain indelicate reminiscences of the
days when he went to high school with
Dr. Jordan. And if you doubted the
details of this friendship he would
flaunt the fact that Dr. Jordan kept
automobiles off the campus so all the
'bus drivers wouldn't starve to death!
Well, Uncle John used to say that
when his sabbatical year's leave of
absence came around he was going to
devote it to writing a history of Palo
Alto. Then Joe Larkin named a cigar
after him and the necessity for seeking
fame as an author no longer existed.
But Uncle John had a theory that
the history of a community need be
nothing more than a recital of styles—
the dates were fixed by the convention
in whiskers and the custom in clothes.
As he used to say: "They don't need
to date none of these Quads. If you
just look at the pants that the seniors
are wearing you can tell the year it is."
History Written in Pants
And Uncle John was right. We can
go 'way back to the late years of the
last century when Palo Alto was
young, when there was a hitching post
in front of every house, when the
ownership of a tandem bicycle proved
a man to be what has variously been
termed a "sport," "queener," and
"sheik," and the absence of a
tache proved that the owner wasn't
old enough to grow one. Show any
oldtimer a group picture taken in that
era and it will at once take him back
to the days when there was only one
house on the corner of Waverley and
University avenue, and the Hyde man
sion out on Lincoln avenue was in the
suburbs. Those were the days when
stalwart men played tennis, croquet,
and ping-pong, wearing a jaunty,
fringed sash about their middles; when
a dinky cap was the sign of sporting
tendencies; when a man without a
derby was undressed; when coats were
proudly worn flung wide to boastfully
show a wide expanse of single-breasted
lapel vests cut squarely across at the
bottom; when applicants for jobs were
adjured to wear "a starched collar and
modest tie."
Of course Palo Alto had no Roos
store in those days, but it must be
admitted that the same outlandish
garb would have ruled if such had been
the case, for the Roos store in San
Francisco was even then selling Iron
Cloth Alpaca shirtwaists to the debu
tantes of the period and $5.00 over
coats to their escorts.
In those days Palo Alto was pretty
conservative and rather a sleepy vil
lage. Innovations were frowned upon
by undergraduates, by professors, and
by townspeople.
In the days when Herbert Hoover
and President Wilbur were roistering
undergraduates, trousers came back to
normalcy, four-button jackets (similar
to the Brooks model of today) came
into existence and the only extremes
were enormously high collars which
not only hid the Adam's apple, but
often concealed a weak chin —and the
padded shoulders which made every
man look like a Bull Montana or a
Swobeda. Men parted their hair in the
middle —just as they did a couple of
years ago when the same styles were
popular.
The Era of Motors and Movies
Then came the automobile; then
came the moving picture; then came
the "rah! rah! boy." Conventions tot
tered. Shortly after the automobile
began to be manufactured it was found
they were useful for other purposes
than providing transportation. Chape
rones began to be looked upon as ex
cess baggage. The lithographed varsity
man made his appearance. Peg top
trousers were violently enlarged" at
the top—cuffs were three and even
four inches high—and the trousers
were so immodestly short that they
showed a full two-inches of gaudy
hose. Coats were still wide at the
shoulders; lapels were high and shari>-
ly notched. Very light-colored tan ox
fords were all the rage; and they were
invariably tied with wide, silk laces.
Felt hats were turned up in front and
down at the rear and were eloquent
with multi-colored bands. Jewelry was
worn wherever it showed to the best
advantage, usually in the scarf. A cala
bash pipe, a college pennant, a bull dog
and a foaming stein completed the pic
ture. Not even the jolt of the earth
quake upset these styles; they even
lasted beyond the coming of the street
car line which put Uncle John and his
confreres out of business.
In those days San Francisco was six
months behind New York in its styles;
and Palo Alto was either two months
behind San Francisco or a year ahead

of New York, whichever way you
figured. College people thought they
were very daring in the styles they
wore. As a matter of fact there was
neither a man nor a woman daring
enough to wear anything different from
what others were wearing—college
styles are sometimes bizarre but col
lege men and women seldom dare to
become conspicuous among their fel
lows. No man in a last year's suit or
a next year's hat ever received a bid
to a fraternity.
From Village to City
'Long about 1915 the World's Fair
had a far-reaching effect on the dress
of the West. Eastern college men met
Western college men and the differ
ence in time between the styles of the
East and the styles of the West was
cut in two. Progressive merchandising
methods of Roos Bros.' and other big
stores brought the latest from eastern
mills and foreign looms to the Pacific
Coast almost as soon as they reached
the Atlantic Coast.
Extremes in campus fashions began
to go out of date. Young men every
where began to wear about the same
kind of clothes and older men who re
fused to admit that they were old,
began to dress like younger men.
Metropolitan fashions began to reach
Palo Alto; Palo Alto began to grow;
there were new subdivisions, new
streets, new homes, and new business
buildings. San Francisco business men
saw Its sunny warmth as a welcome
clime in which to build their homes.
The country entered the war. The
young fellows who made Camp Fre
mont such a seething center of activity
were appreciative of Roos styles and
Roos service in San Francisco and, to
better the service, a small military
store was opened at Menlo Park.
An amazing business rewarded this
step of progress and an opportunity
was seen for the development of a
modern, up-to-date clothing store down
the peninsula. In August 1918 Roos
Bros, took over the business of "The
Regent" in Palo Alto.
New Dress for Old Firm
For the last seven years a Roos
store has been part of Palo Alto and
has had its influence on the styles
about town and on the campus. No
longer is it necessary to go "to the
City" to shop.
The man of today dresses for com
fort and cleanliness —far more than
his brothers of older days. There was
a time when the campus thought it
smart to wear corduroys that couldn't
have been cleaned by anything but a
smelter. The boys in Encina Hall,
when they undressed, stood their trou
sers up in the middle of the floor and
hung the rest of their clothes upon
them. There was the period of the
"semester shirt" —it was considered
an act of disloyalty to patronize the
laundry more than once a term. Rag
ged and dirty jerseys were looked on
as the signs of virility and athletic
prowess. Palo Alto townspeople were
occasionally shocked by visits of engi
neering students from the campus.
But comfort and cleanliness have
been developed in these recent years.
Even in formal wear, comfort has been
regarded. Evening functions used to
call for full dress; now there has come
a let-down in formality. First gloves
were discarded; then shoes replaced
dancing pumps; now dinner coats are
accepted at most evening gatherings.
There was a tendency to wear lighter
garments. Men favored athletic under
wear. Underskirts have vanished with
the goggles, gauntlets, and duster of

the automobilist of 1907. The clean
shave has replaced the Arkansaw
Climbers and mustachios of older
days.
Roos buyers prophesy new styles.
New York can give a forecast of the
next chapter of Palo Alto's history in
terms of clothes. Comfort is to rule.
Styles in Palo Alto will be influenced
by the fact that it is a college town
and that collegiate styles are always
"different." Color is rampant. Suits
will be green, tan, or a decided blue.
Ties will be gaudy, even though they
may be neat. Socks—no limit! Hats in
definite color-shades that last year you
would have only seen on the Orpheum
circuit.
Silhouette Cycle of Styles
It is a matter of history that men's
silhouettes go through a regular course
of evolution. Wide shoulders and peg
top trousers form a triangle with the

point at the bottom —then comes a
conservative coat and straight hang
ing trousers to form a rectangle—
then extremes follow the law of grav
ity and we have a pinch shoulder coat
with a wide flare and balloon trousers
to form a reverse triangle.
Roos buyers prophecy new styles.
"Broad shoulders are coming back—
perhaps they will be extreme," declares
one of the Roos buyers, newly returned
from his semi-annual trip to eastern
markets. Color is to find expression in
suits in the new "London light"—blue
with a decided sheen to it. Then there
are Granite grays and Bark browns.
A new chapter in Palo Alto's history
is about to be written. When college
opens the campus and the town will
be gay with the sportiest of sport wear
and the gaudiest of garb—and the new
Roos store is prepared to play its part
in giving to men, women, and children
the merchandise they want —merchan-
dise that is exactly the same as is
being spread before the sophisticated
New Yorker over the counters of Fifth
Avenue shops. The man of Manhattan
who wants to buy the finest overcoat
made is shown the camel's hair Wor
umbo —and Worumbo coats are stocked
in Palo Alto in the popular shades.
Scotch mills turn out the finest golf
hose in the world—and the Roos store
shows the latest patterns almost at
the same time they first make their
appearance on Long Island golf
courses. There are few cities the size
of Palo Alto that can boast so fine a

stock of merchandise as the spacious
floor of the new Roos store will permit
to be displayed.
Palo Alto's people have certain
tastes and habits of their own. There's
the matter of the Dutchess corduroys
that are worn by Stanford juniors and
seniors. It was recently announced by
the manufacturers that Roos stores
were the largest users of their product
in the world. There are Senior som
breros and other class regalia—some
of which varies from year to year. And
as for the women, they are found of
sport garb and lean to color and youth
ful accent. The summer season begins
early in Palo Alto and continues well
into the fall.
So, to the secluded liomeiness of
this peninsula city, come the bright
and jaunty and modish apparel selected
from foreign looms and eastern mills.
Colorful as no other campus in archi
tecture and surroundings, it likewise

reflects the up-to-the-minute fashions
of the day.
And how long before the swing of
the cycle shall once more bring back
the stove-pipe pants and high, stiff
collar? How long before the derby
shall again hold a dignified place in
the sun? How long before strong men
will part their hair in the middle? May
we not expect that feminine millinery
will again repeat the wide Merry
Widow of post-earthquake months — j
when, large as the track oval, it was
"two laps to the hat;" when hatpins
were two feet long? Mustachios —sure-
ly they will again be the fashion? So
surely as Roos Bros, have been in

business for 59 years the time will
come when they will again be selling
clothes that have a full flavor of the
days of '95 —though, doubtless, to stu
dents that fly to their classes in the
steel monoplanes of tomorrow!
