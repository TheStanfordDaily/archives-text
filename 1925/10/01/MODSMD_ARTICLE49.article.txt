# OUTLOOK FOR GOLF SEASON IS BRIGHT
## 
### Al Post 
With last year's varsity left practi
cally intact and with a number of
freshmen of known ability in college,
prospects for a banner golf season are
brighter than they have been for sev
eral years.
Nick Carter, 1924 golf manager, is
the only regular varsity man who is
missing from the fold.
Captain Dick Lang and Manager
Tom Condit, old standbys of the links
game at Stanford, will in all likelihood
be able to pick a six-man team from
the following squad of veterans: Eddie
Meyberg, Ashton Stanley, Fritz Ditz
ler, Horace Hindry, Jim Wilson, Ru
pert Quinn, and Neal Miller.
Babes Good
Wilson and Quinn are a pair of
steady players with two years of var
sity experience behind them. Meyberg
aud Stanley starred in the 1928 squad's
sweeping victory over the California
babes last spring, and have been doing
considerable playing this summer.
Hindry is another '28 man who showed
promise last year. Wilson has repre
sented the Cardinal on the links for
two years. He did not play in the last
) match against the Bears, but did some
nice work in the Pacific Coast inter
collegiate at Del Monte last February.
Neal Miller transferred to Stanford
this quarter from U. S. C., where he
performed brilliantly, winning the
southpaw championship.
Then there are at least four good
men in the class of '29 who will form
a nucleus for an aggregation which
will attempt to hand the Berkeley
yearlings a third straight setback â€”
Bobby Syer of San Jose, George Force
of Oakland, Herb Fleishhacker of San
Francisco, and Bob Vermillya, a spring
quarter frosh who is eligible for the
babe squad this year.
Syer, the present champion of the
San Jose Country Club, shoots in the
70's consistently. He was runner-up
for the California junior amateur title
three years ago. Fleishhacker, better
known as interscholastic shot put
champion, is above average with the
golf sticks, and should have no trouble
in making the squad. Vermillya showed
up well in the intramural tourney held
last spring. Manager Condit is confi
dent that there are plenty of other
| good linksmen in the frosh class, and
i asks that all players with any degree
lof ability get in touch with him at
I once at the Phi Gamma Delta house.

He also wants more candidates for
the varsity squad.
Full Schedule Planned
Condit is mapping a more ambitious
schedule for his brassie wielders than
has ever been attempted before, and
as soon as he gets a definite line on
available material he will pick a squad
of ten or twelve and arrange matches.
