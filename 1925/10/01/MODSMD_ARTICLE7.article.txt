# ANNUAL MUD ROW SLATED TUESDAY
## Freshmen, Sophomores Will Clash in Only Class Battle of Year 
### 
Freshmen and sophomores will be
given their first and last chance to
settle once and for all the question of
class superiority when the annual mud
fight is staged in the Lagunita bottom
at 3 o'clock next Tuesday afternoon.
This was determined at a sponsors'
meeting held in Encina yesterday
afternoon.
The general plan of attack will be
the same as that followed in the past
two years. All able-bodied men of the
two classes will line up between two
capacious mud holes, and at a given
signal will rush toward the opposing
line and try to capture as many of
their rivals as possible and give them
a baptism of mud and water.
Only one important change has been
made. The freshmen and sophomores
will keep the pits from which they
start as reception rooms for their op
ponents, instead of rushing the length
of the field and using the pit opposite
them. For example, the first year men
will leave pit "A'.' when the signal is
given, rush out and meet the sopho
mores in the middle of the field, and
return with their captives to pit "A."
Adjoining each pit will be roped-off
squares where the battlers will be
herded as they emerge from the water.
Picked squads of upperclassmen will
act as guards to prevent the captives
from returning to the fray, and to see
that all the rules of the fight are fol
lowed. The battle will continue until
all the members of one of the two
classes have been thrown into the
pits.
Both 1928 and 1929 men will hold
meetings in the near future to draw
up plans of attack. Complete rules for
the fight will be announced in tomor
row's issue.
