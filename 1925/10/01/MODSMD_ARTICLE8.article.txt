"Hell-Bent fer Heaven," the 1923
Pulitzer prize play which was pro

Coast at Stanford this summer, will be
repeated on Friday evening, October 9,
in the Assembly hall.
Gordon Davis, dramatic coach, will
again play the leading role in the part
of Rufe Pryor, his first appearance
since the presentation of "The Dover
Road" last year.
With the exception of Delmer Daves
in the part of David Hunt, in place of
Leonard Bowman, who was in the sum
mer production, the cast will remain
unchanged throughout.
The entire cast is as follows: Rufe
Pryor, Gordon Davis; David Hunt, Del
mer Daves; Meg Hunt, June Clem
mons; Sid Hunt, Wayne Newcomb;
Matt Hunt, Guy Holliday; Andy Dow
ry, Phil Uraer; Jude Lowry, Marian
Henshall.
The second performance of this un
usual melodrama of southern moun
taineers comes in response to many
requests from local playgoers who
were unable to witness the original
production.
