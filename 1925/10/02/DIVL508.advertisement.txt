REGINALD DENNY in
California Straight Ahead
Seeing Denny is just like put
ting Old Man Gloom in moth
balls. Here he is in his maddest,
merriest comedy-dramaâ€”in the
rollicking, laughing sensation of
the season. Come, get a taste of
rea lpre-war laughter. Denny has
no peer in the light-comedy field.
Mack Sennett presents "Cupid's
Boots," featuring Ralph Graves.
See him as a shoe clerk Romeo.
