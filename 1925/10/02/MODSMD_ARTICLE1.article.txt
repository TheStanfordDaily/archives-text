# BABE ELEVEN PLAYS SAN MATEO, POTTER TEAMS TOMORROW
## PREPS ARE FORMIDABLE Freshmen Have Weighty Line But Inexperienced, Light Backfield

With one scalp already at their belts,
Coach Husky Hunt's freshman grid
ders will endeavor to add two more
when they meet Potter Tech and San
LVlatoo Junior College tomorrow. Pot
ter will furnish opposition on the
freshman field at 10 a.m. and San
Mateo as a preliminary to the Varsity-
Santa Clara game in the afternoon.
In order to get a line on all his

bis first string men in the morning
game, although the majority of the
first squad will see action in the after

at Long Beach, has received injuries
to the leg which will put bim out of
the game for the rest of the season.
.Hulen promised to be one of the
strongest tackles, and his loss will be
felt keenly.
Any worries that Hunt may have
will not be found in the center of the
line. Bob Vermilya, a third-quarter
freshman, and A1 Cook, of Lick-Wil
merding, both look good in the pivot
position. The two have been playing
nip and tuck in practice, putting up
a great scrap for the job. Vermilya,
who looks slightly better on the of
'x'ense, will probably start the afternoon
game. Cook, who shines on the de
fensive, will be given a chance to show
his wares, however.
Welton and Marks have been doing
most of the kicking and are booting
the pigskin well into the forties most I
of the time. "Spud" Lewis, at quarter-1
back, is expected to show few more j
plays in the afternoon game than were j
•shown last Saturday, as the yearlings j
have been working hard on new forma
tions all week.
The forward wall of the team aver
ages heavier than the varsity regulars
and promises to whip into a very dan-
