# BABE ELEVEN PLAYS SAN MATEO, POTTER TEAMS TOMORROW
## PREPS ARE FORMIDABLE Freshmen Have Weighty Line But Inexperienced, Light Backfield 
### Frank Baker 
With one scalp already at their belts,
Coach Husky Hunt's freshman grid
ders will endeavor to add two more
when they meet Potter Tech and San
LVlatoo Junior College tomorrow. Pot
ter will furnish opposition on the
freshman field at 10 a.m. and San
Mateo as a preliminary to the Varsity-
Santa Clara game in the afternoon.
In order to get a line on all his
material, Hunt will use a number of
bis first string men in the morning
game, although the majority of the
first squad will see action in the after
noon.
Ray Hulen, last year's grid captain
at Long Beach, has received injuries
to the leg which will put bim out of
the game for the rest of the season.
.Hulen promised to be one of the
strongest tackles, and his loss will be
felt keenly.
Any worries that Hunt may have
will not be found in the center of the
line. Bob Vermilya, a third-quarter
freshman, and A1 Cook, of Lick-Wil
merding, both look good in the pivot
position. The two have been playing
nip and tuck in practice, putting up
a great scrap for the job. Vermilya,
who looks slightly better on the of
'x'ense, will probably start the afternoon
game. Cook, who shines on the de
fensive, will be given a chance to show
his wares, however.
Welton and Marks have been doing
most of the kicking and are booting
the pigskin well into the forties most I
of the time. "Spud" Lewis, at quarter-1
back, is expected to show few more j
plays in the afternoon game than were j
•shown last Saturday, as the yearlings j
have been working hard on new forma
tions all week.
The forward wall of the team aver
ages heavier than the varsity regulars
and promises to whip into a very dan-
J gerous line. The backfield is not as
! heavy, but is fast. The backs, in the
| main, are inexperienced, and a lot of
work is necessary before they will at
j tain the smoothness and precision that
characterizes Hunt's teams.
Johnny Altaffer, a former Stanford
freshman football player, left a big
hole in the San Mateo Junior College
team when he quit that school to go
East. However, this loss has been over
come by the stellar work of McCleary
at left half. The San Mateans appear
[ strong and are given a slight edge
| over the babes in tomorrow's game.
The U. of C. freshmen were fortunate
j to beat the Junior College 20 to 10
last Saturday and it is certain to be
} a tough job for the Card frosh to show
: a similar score.
Potter Tech, from previous experi
j ence, is bound to have a strong high
i school aggregation and will make the
: morning game an interesting one.
The probable lineup will be as fol
lows:

With one scalp already at their belts,
Coach Husky Hunt's freshman grid
ders will endeavor to add two more
when they meet Potter Tech and San
LVlatoo Junior College tomorrow. Pot
ter will furnish opposition on the
freshman field at 10 a.m. and San
Mateo as a preliminary to the Varsity-
Santa Clara game in the afternoon.
In order to get a line on all his
material, Hunt will use a number of
bis first string men in the morning
game, although the majority of the
first squad will see action in the after
noon.
Ray Hulen, last year's grid captain
at Long Beach, has received injuries
to the leg which will put bim out of
the game for the rest of the season.
.Hulen promised to be one of the
strongest tackles, and his loss will be
felt keenly.
Any worries that Hunt may have
will not be found in the center of the
line. Bob Vermilya, a third-quarter
freshman, and A1 Cook, of Lick-Wil
merding, both look good in the pivot
position. The two have been playing
nip and tuck in practice, putting up
a great scrap for the job. Vermilya,
who looks slightly better on the of
'x'ense, will probably start the afternoon
game. Cook, who shines on the de
fensive, will be given a chance to show
his wares, however.
Welton and Marks have been doing
most of the kicking and are booting
the pigskin well into the forties most I
of the time. "Spud" Lewis, at quarter-1
back, is expected to show few more j
plays in the afternoon game than were j
•shown last Saturday, as the yearlings j
have been working hard on new forma
tions all week.
The forward wall of the team aver
ages heavier than the varsity regulars
and promises to whip into a very dan-
J gerous line. The backfield is not as
! heavy, but is fast. The backs, in the
| main, are inexperienced, and a lot of
work is necessary before they will at
j tain the smoothness and precision that
characterizes Hunt's teams.
Johnny Altaffer, a former Stanford
freshman football player, left a big
hole in the San Mateo Junior College
team when he quit that school to go
East. However, this loss has been over
come by the stellar work of McCleary
at left half. The San Mateans appear
[ strong and are given a slight edge
| over the babes in tomorrow's game.
The U. of C. freshmen were fortunate
j to beat the Junior College 20 to 10
last Saturday and it is certain to be
} a tough job for the Card frosh to show
: a similar score.
Potter Tech, from previous experi
j ence, is bound to have a strong high
i school aggregation and will make the
: morning game an interesting one.
The probable lineup will be as fol
lows:
San Mateo — Stanford —
