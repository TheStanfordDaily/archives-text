# BRONCOS BATTLE CARDS IN STADIUM TOMORROW
## Weak Spots In Stanford Lineup Worked On During Intensive Practice Period 
### Wilbur Adams 
PACIFIC COAST fans will have their eyes focused on the Stanford Stadium
i tomorrow when Stanford meets Santa Clara, and the dopesters will have
i their first chance to match the varsities of California and Stanford by the use
i of comparative scores. The Golde% Bears outplayed the Broncos last Saturday

i to the tune of 28 to 0. The question is, can the inexperienced Cardinal eleven
come back, after their defeat by the Olympic Club, and top the score made
| by the California machine?
Coaches Warner, Kerr, and Thornhill have been working with the Stanford
j squad at the rate of two practices a day this week so as to correct the
j mistakes that were found in the contest with the clubmen. Stanford appeared
| weak on the rudiments of the game in last Saturday's contest, so time ha 3
I fceen spent this week on tackling, clipping, and running interference. The
i freshmen furnished the varsity — —

! some opposition in a scrimmage in j
the middle of the week. The 1928 men j
held their older brothers for the first j
1 few plays, but after that the varsity's J
i backfield tore off yards at will.
First Eleven Unselected
! The first team is still unpicked, and
j "Pop" Warner will be watching every
j player tomorrow in an effort to pick
j the eleven most dependable men. The
' men that show the best tomorrow will
! undoubtedly start the U. S. C. game on
j October 17. and probably the California 1
! contest on November 21. Warner's plan |
is to work eleven men until they can |
play together perfectly. With one ex-1
ception, the men who started the first j
I game for Stanford last season also I
j started the Big Game against Cali- j
jfornia.
Ward Poulson and Leo Harris are
' starting tomorrow's game at the tackle
j positions, with Chris Freeman, Eli!
j Post, and Bert Simmons on the bench !
! awaiting the call. Last Saturday Harris j
I substituted for Hunt at guard, and I
! proved himself to be a valuable man. ;

j Since Wednesday he has been playing
j right tackle with the first eleven. Poul
j son is the one substitute tackle to
make his block "S" last year, being
! r v'ef man for both Harry Shipkey and
iChuck Johnston.
Hunt at Guard
Although Bob Hunt has been suffer
! ing from a wrenched back since Mon
| day, he is expected to start at guard
opposite Fred Swan. In case Hunt's
j injury keeps him out of the lineup
! against the Mission team, Merrill Ar
-1 mour will be used, with Don Robeski
as first string substitute. At center
Warner is starting Harold McCreerv
: instead of Stuart Van Hook. Van Hook
will probably see as much action to
morrow as McCreery because the
coaches are still trying to decide which
is the better center.

The latest change in the line is the
shifting of Fred Price to right end.
Although Link Moore started the first
game of the season at that position,
Art Greisser has been practicing with
the first eleven most of the week. On
Thursday, Price received the first call,
however, and will, therefore, probably
start the Santa Clara game at tli« op
posite end to Ted Shipkey. Moore has
been troubled with a sprained ankle,
and may not be used at all tomorrow.
If a substitute is used for Shipkey, it
will probably be Tex Middleton, who
is now playing his third year on the
varsity. Middleton is a clever defensive
player, and looks like the logical man
for the position left vacant by Jim
Lawson.
Mitchell, Solomon at Quarter
Both Muggs Mitchell and Fred Solo
mon will be playing quarterback
against the Broncs, but it is still un
decided which one of the two will start
the contest. Mitchell ran the first team
Thursday afternoon for the first time
this week. When Solomon is in the
game the average weight of the back
field is raised to 190 pounds a man,
and a heavy backfield is needed with
Warner's style of play. Mitchell, al
though lighter, is a good field general
and is dependable on the defense.
Mike Murphy and George Bogue are
in the starting lineup at halves, but
Don Hill, Dick Hyland, and maybe
Nick Kirwan, will see action before
the final gun is shot tomorrow after
noon. Murphy is to be the safety man
while he is in the game, and Hyland
or Solomon can take his place when he
is on the bench. In Wednesday's prac
tice John Garthwaite received a badly
sprained ankle which will keep him
out of the game for some time. Garth
waite plays halfback and is recognized
as being the fastest man on the Stan
ford squad.
Captain Ernie Nevers enters the bat
tle tomorrow in perfect condition.
There was some doubt in the minds
of many as to whether the two broken
ankles that he sustained last year

would hold up this season. Nevers has
his ankles carefully wrapped before
every practice, but the injured parts
have caused him no trouble in "the
first three weeks of the season, and
the big captain was used often to buck
the Olympic Club's line last Saturday.
Patchett, of the 1928 freshman team,
or Bob Wright will replace Nevers if
a substitute is used at fullback.
The game tomorrow startes at 3
o'clock, immediately after the fresh
man game with San Mateo Junior Col
lege. The starting lineup will probably
be:
Stanford— Santa Clara—
Shipkey LER Storm (c)
Poulson LTR Gallagher
Swan LGR Sumner
McCreery C Granucci
Hunt RGL Valline
Harris RTL Leonard
Price , REL Malley
Mitchell Q Dagley
