The Stanford Glee Club will hold its
first meeting of the quarter on Monday
afternoon at 4:15 in Room 84.

Warren D. Allen, director, and a com
mittee from the club have selected the
repertoire for this year. An effort has
been made to keep the same quality pro

the past and at the same time lighten the
repertoire by adding more humorous
numbers.
Among the heavy selections to be pre
sented by the club are two compositions
by Gustav Hoist, "Hymn to Soma," and
"A Dirge for Two Veterans." It is an
ticipated that a group of negro spirituals,
"Travelin' to de Grave," "Walkin' in de
Gahden," and "Swing Low Sweet
Chariot," will be one of the most popu
lar groups presented by the club. Two
humorous numbers, "The Cerebral Di
nosaur," and "ldylle Mongolienne,"
should prove very popular. It is even
possible that the "Cerebral Dinosaur"
will take the place of the old favorite of
the campus, "Old Man Noah."
Officers elected last spring for this
year are: Leonard Dobson, president:
Delmer Daves, manager; Kenneth
Thompson, vice-president; Don Aldcn
and Lynn Wintcrbotham, assistant man
agers; Thomas McClellan, librarian.
