# As to Policy
## 
### 
The Daily Palo Alto will ivnk itself with the conservatives for the
next four and a half montjis. The present editorial policy, if it can be
called such, will call attention to existing conditions at Stanford, both
good and bad, and will praise or condemn as the case may demand.
Criticism will be constructive rather than destructive; and whenever a
situation is presented to the readers of the Daily Palo Aj.to it will be
the Editor's sincere hope that it will start someone thinking. Mere
calling attention to a fault will not correct it, unless a ball of student
opinion is set in motion which gains momentum as it travels, resulting
finally in a popular demand for a change. Mere editorials cannot mould
student opinion. If the comment in the Daily makes students think, the
Editor will be satisfied.

Stanford is a pretty good place. Still, here and there we can find a
flaw, and whenever such a shortcoming is brought to the attention of
the Daily it will be placed before the readers in a fair, accurate, and
truthful fashion. Then let come what may.

This year every editorial appearing in the Daily will be unsigned.
Some will be written by the Editor, some by members of the staffs of
different campus publications, and some by informed persons—yet all of
them will go without the initials of their author, thereby expressing the
paper gnd not an individual. Let it be understood that every such
editorial will be heartily endorsed and supported by the Editor who has
charge of the destinies of the Daily.

Attention is called to the "Campus Opinion" column. Faculty mem
bers and students are urged to express themselves through this medium.
The "opinions" usually serve as a guide to the popularity of the editorial
columns—when the editorials clash with campus belief, then there is a
gerat influx of opinions from agitated persons. This is a healthy condi
tion and the Editor will look forward to periodic outbursts. Communica
tions should not be longer than 300 words and should be on matters of
general interest. They will be signed only by the author's initials, or by
his full name if he prefers.
