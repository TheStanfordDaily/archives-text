						Wise Move

I>r. W. H. Barrow has announced that the swimming' pools in Encina
and Roble gymnasiums wijl be closed until it is evident that no cases
of poliomyelitis, or infantile paralysis, will develop among- the incoming
students. This is purely a precautionary measure. The forethought of
the medical authorities in making this move for the protection of the
Stanford colony is indeed commendable, and it is hoped the students will
do their part in co-operating to stop this disease before it appears at
Stan ford.
The poliomyelitis situation in California at this time is encouraging.
The greatest number of cases usually occur during September and
October, but the reports for the past few weeks have shown a decided
decrease in the number of new cases. It is expected that the epidemic in
California and other parts of the country will soon be well under control.
The disease is transmitted by "carriers," that is healthy individuals
who harbor the organism and may spread it without contracting the
disease themselves. Students are urged at this time ,even though there
are no known cases in the vicinity, to avoid the use of drinking cups and
towels that are used by others. It is also a good plan to wash the hands
before eating, since poliomyelitis is a "hand to mouth" disease and the
organism causing it is found primarily in the nose and throat.

TWENTY PER CENT of the freshmen registering yesterday walked
around the Administration building during the procedure wearing Dinks.
Probably another 20 per cent hadn't troubled themselves to purchase the
regulation headgear.
In the olden days when Stanford was Stanford it was as much a
breach of conduct to wear a Dink in a Quad building as it was to l>e
seen without one. Freshmen are more or less on their own hook now,
but if they want to uphold rtaditions they will wear Dinks and will not
wear them in Quad buildings.
