# TIME OUT!
## 
### 
"Pop" Warner tells the following story about one of the hard-boiled
football teams in Pennsylvania a number of years ago.
This he-man organization lined up for the first play after the kickoff. The
Quarterback on the opposing aggregation happened to be a delicate little
fellow who talked like this:
"A'ab we all he'ah, fellahs? Fo'ahty, th'ahty, th'ahty-foah, fo'ahteen
"Time out! Time out!" roared the defensive back on the other team. "Hey,
referee, time out!"
"What da ya want time out for?"
"So I can kiss that deah quarterback!"
And this is the emotion that all of the upperclassmen feel when a freshman
appears on the Qnad in knickers.
