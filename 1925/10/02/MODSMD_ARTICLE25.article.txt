Helen Wills, a junior at the University of California, has been elected to
Phi Beta Kappa. This is an honor usually given only to seniors, but because
of her remarkable tennis ability and high scholastic standing she was deemed
eligible for membership to the honorary society in her third year.
Miss Wills' election furnishes another proof that athletic prowess and
study can successfully mix. Her election is a good boost for the cause of
college athletics, which have always received severe criticism. It is only
when one activity is rushed to the oblivion of every other that the crash
comes, and it is no more fair to censor athletics in general because of indi
vidual excess than to blame food en masse for one invalid's indigestion.
