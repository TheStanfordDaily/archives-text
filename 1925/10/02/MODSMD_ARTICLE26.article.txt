# CABBAGES and THINGS

### 
RETURN
A vision floats within the darkness of
my closed eyes—
A maiden fair, yet shy as youngest
youth should be —
Wise, but with a modest bashful air.
A comrade —true and understanding.
Three moons have come and gone
Since last I looked upon her face,
In peace, with blissful auguries.
Her heart —has it been touched
With fiery finger of some ardent swain.
Or calm and world-wise hand of older
wooer?
Or will the frank, quick look
Of unspoiled comradeship—yea, love —
Gaze out from her deep eyes to mine?
• * * *
The villain plunged his hand into
the torn flesh and plucked out the
heart —dripping, red. "I shall eat thee
—for my own satisfaction shall I eat
he growled through his mus
tache as he took the heart in his
reddened hands, placed it in his
thirsty mouth, and devoured it —a
fresh, red, oozing morsel.
"Ah, now I am satiated," quoth he.
"That sure is good watermelon."
* * *
"Freshmen this year are youngei"
than ever before, many of them being
only fourteen or fifteen years old."—
News Item.
"That Charleston Baby of Mine"
and "Yes, Sir, HE'S My Baby" will be
more appropriate for sophomore sirens
this year, it seems. Also we can expect
to hear conversations like this:
"Perthie, John thtole my beßtest rat
tle from off my desthk. I thall go right
over and poke him with a thafety pin."
Or— ,
"Come over to my room this after
noon, will you, James; we're going to
have a tea party, with animal crackers
and maybe ice cream!"

LETTERS FROM THE LOVELORN
Dear Cabbages—
I used to have lots of admirers, and
went to all the dances. But now no
boy will even speak to me, and Char
lie, who used to ask me out every
week, says that all the dates I'll get
now I'll have to buy at the grocery
store. What shall I do about it?
A Worried Freshman.
My dear worried one—
That's the insidious thing about it.
But save your money—DON'T buy
Listerine. Ask Cabs, he knows.
At arm's length,
Cabbages.

Dear Cabbages—
My girl is beginning to act real un
friendly and cold towards me. She al
ways wants to go straight home after
a show now, except, of course, unfor
tunately, for a visit to the candy shop.
I think she likes another fellow who
has a big car better than me, though
I can't imagine why. What would you
advise me to do in order to regain her
affection? Noah Count.
Dear Noah—
You might try striking oil in the
back yard. If so, remember you know,
Your Cabbages.

A Worried Freshman.
My dear worried one—
That's the insidious thing about it.
But save your money—DON'T buy
Listerine. Ask Cabs, he knows.

Dear Cabbages—
My girl is beginning to act real un
friendly and cold towards me. She al
ways wants to go straight home after
a show now, except, of course, unfor
tunately, for a visit to the candy shop.
I think she likes another fellow who
has a big car better than me, though
I can't imagine why. What would you
advise me to do in order to regain her
affection? Noah Count.
Dear Noah—
You might try striking oil in the
back yard. If so, remember you know,
Your Cabbages.
RETURN
A vision floats within the darkness of
my closed eyes—
A maiden fair, yet shy as youngest
youth should be —
Wise, but with a modest bashful air.
A comrade —true and understanding.
Three moons have come and gone
Since last I looked upon her face,
In peace, with blissful auguries.
Her heart —has it been touched
With fiery finger of some ardent swain.
Or calm and world-wise hand of older
wooer?
Or will the frank, quick look
Of unspoiled comradeship—yea, love —
Gaze out from her deep eyes to mine?

The villain plunged his hand into
the torn flesh and plucked out the
heart —dripping, red. "I shall eat thee

he growled through his mus
tache as he took the heart in his
reddened hands, placed it in his
thirsty mouth, and devoured it —a
fresh, red, oozing morsel.
"Ah, now I am satiated," quoth he.
"That sure is good watermelon."

"That Charleston Baby of Mine"
and "Yes, Sir, HE'S My Baby" will be
more appropriate for sophomore sirens
this year, it seems. Also we can expect
to hear conversations like this:
"Perthie, John thtole my beßtest rat
tle from off my desthk. I thall go right
over and poke him with a thafety pin."
Or— ,
"Come over to my room this after
noon, will you, James; we're going to
have a tea party, with animal crackers
and maybe ice cream!"
