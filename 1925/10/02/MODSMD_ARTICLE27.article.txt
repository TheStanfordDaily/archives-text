# THE 						AISLE SEAT

Tin.- New Stanford Theater opened the
college year with a very athletic evening,
with a very, very sporting movie and tre
mendously active vaudevillians, particu
larly the xylophonists. In addition, the
audience did its bit.

Now, in our time we have seen a few
shows, some good and some bad, but last
night's in toto was among the worst. It
might not have been so bad, but for the
most superb exhibition of Stanford man
ners. Lemons are all right for some
purposes, but as missiles of Stanford
good-will—oh, well. We are rather glad
that the third act stopped the show.

But as far as everything goes, the
vaudeville was reallly quite marvelous—
after what we have seen on the two
previous Thursday nights. But, oh, the
xylophonists! Really, the wrist motion
was just tremendous. The other acts
were not quite so bad, but there still is
room for improvement. We hope to see
better before the quarter is out.
The movie! We never realized how
dull a picture could be made. Fairy tales
are all right—we don't expect to believe
everything we see could actually happen
—but there has to be something interest
ing about them.
