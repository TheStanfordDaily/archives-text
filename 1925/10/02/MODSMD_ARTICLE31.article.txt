## 
### 
Emphasizing the need for "seeing
things as they really are," President
Wilbur is quoted in a recent bulletin
issued by the California State Board
of Health as urging the public to
search for the truth and apply it to
the promotion of human welfare.
"A considerable part of our so-called
education is about as genuine as Santa
Claus," President Wilbur declares.
"Science and learning have outpaced
our populacc. Astronomy is accom
panied by its popular imitation, astro
logy. Medicine has its great shadow
land of buncombe, deceit, and plausible
chicanery.
"Graveyards still give moonlight
visitors the shudders. Even the wife
of a university president has to be
careful not to seat thirteen at the
table, and Friday is a day of sinister
import if used for initiation of journeys
or new enterprises.
"One would think that a sense of
humor alone would keep our fellow
citizens from thinking it possible that
the stars in their courses were inter
ested in the welfare of their lives and
the success of their love affairs, but
it takes time and much education to
cultivate more than the surface of the
ordinary mind."
