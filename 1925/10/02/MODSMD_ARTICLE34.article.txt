men to conform to Stanford traditions.
Robert A. Hefner, of the Y. M. C. A.
cabinet, announced that a meeting of

Encina Dining Halls on Tuesday night
to form a freshman council.
The election of the freshman class
officers will be held on Monday night,
according to an announcement made
by the sponsors last night.
