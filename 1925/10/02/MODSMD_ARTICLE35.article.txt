# PROSPECTS BRIGHT FOR CARD SWIMMING, WATER POLO SQUADS
## O'Connors' Return Aids Team Allen, Stevenson Gain Summer Victories 
### 
Swimming and water polo prospects
have never been so so bright at Stan
ford as this year, according to Ernst
Brandsten, mentor of aquatic sports
who has consistently coached Stan
ford water polo and swimming teams
to victory during the last ten years.

That he has more than ample cause
to expect a successful season will be
seen by a summary of the grade A
material which will be on hand from
.which to build a team which, on paper
at least, will be the equal of any col
lege team in the country.

Events for which Bransten will start
to train his men are the Golden Gate
Swim to be held Sunday, Ostober 11,
in San Francisco, and the P. A. A.
championships which must be held
during this year. The Golden Gate
Swim will offer both individual and
team prizes for the organization send
ing the five men who place nearest
the front. The Cardinal swimmers
should make a strong bid for this
trophy in the gruelling seven-eighths
mile race across the Gate.

The return of Wallace O'Connor
after a year's absence again gives
Stanford one of the greatest swimmers
ever developed on the Pacific coast.
O'Connor, who was a member of the
American Olympic relay swimming and
water polo teams, has been practicing
constantly during the past year and
has improved his times in most events.
During the summer he won the cup
offered to the swimmer gaining the
most victories in Southern California
outdoor competition and has made 55
seconds for the century. He also re
cently defeated Lester Smith, Olympic
Club ace, at the 220 in the excellent
time of 2:22.

Arden Allen and Carl Stevenson,
both first place men of last year's
team, have been successful during the
summer and are ranked among the
foremost western swimmers. Allen,
•who will captain the 1925-26 water polo
team, is among the greatest of all
around swimmers as shown by his win
of third place in the national medley
the early part of the summer. Harry
Glancy, of Cincinnati, placed first with
Stubby Kruger, for many years na
tional medley champion, second, and
Allen a close third.
In this same meet Stevenson took a
fast third in the senior national 880
and a fourth in the mile. Later in the
summer he won the mile at Healsburg,
unexpectedly defeating Lester Smith.
He has made 2:28 in the 220 and
around 58 in the 100-yard dash.
Allen has developed his breaststroke
since the spring quarter until he now
turns in 1:16 in the century, an im
provement of about ten seconds in
four months. He still retains his ability
to do 1:10 or under in the lOfcyard
backstroke, so should be good for at
least two firsts in the California meet.
In the sprints there is a wealth of
material and competition should be
keen. Bob Williams, who swam during
the summer season for Pasadena, and
Phil Brooks, Len Schwartz, and Dutch
Fletcher all have the ability to do well
under a minute for the 100. Bob
Ackerman has returned to school and,
if he is eligible as is expected, his
speed in both 50 and 100 should be
a valuable asset.

He has made 2:28 in the 220 and
around 58 in the 100-yard dash.
Allen has developed his breaststroke
since the spring quarter until he now
turns in 1:16 in the century, an im
provement of about ten seconds in
four months. He still retains his ability
to do 1:10 or under in the lOfcyard
backstroke, so should be good for at
least two firsts in the California meet.
In the sprints there is a wealth of
material and competition should be
keen. Bob Williams, who swam during
the summer season for Pasadena, and
Phil Brooks, Len Schwartz, and Dutch
Fletcher all have the ability to do well
under a minute for the 100. Bob
Ackerman has returned to school and,
if he is eligible as is expected, his
speed in both 50 and 100 should be
a valuable asset.
Swimming and water polo prospects
have never been so so bright at Stan
ford as this year, according to Ernst
Brandsten, mentor of aquatic sports
who has consistently coached Stan
ford water polo and swimming teams
to victory during the last ten years.

That he has more than ample cause
to expect a successful season will be
seen by a summary of the grade A
material which will be on hand from
.which to build a team which, on paper
at least, will be the equal of any col
lege team in the country.

Events for which Bransten will start
to train his men are the Golden Gate
Swim to be held Sunday, Ostober 11,
in San Francisco, and the P. A. A.
championships which must be held
during this year. The Golden Gate
Swim will offer both individual and
team prizes for the organization send
ing the five men who place nearest
the front. The Cardinal swimmers
should make a strong bid for this
trophy in the gruelling seven-eighths
mile race across the Gate.

The return of Wallace O'Connor
after a year's absence again gives
Stanford one of the greatest swimmers
ever developed on the Pacific coast.
O'Connor, who was a member of the
American Olympic relay swimming and
water polo teams, has been practicing
constantly during the past year and
has improved his times in most events.
During the summer he won the cup
offered to the swimmer gaining the
most victories in Southern California
outdoor competition and has made 55
seconds for the century. He also re
cently defeated Lester Smith, Olympic
Club ace, at the 220 in the excellent
time of 2:22.

Arden Allen and Carl Stevenson,
both first place men of last year's
team, have been successful during the
summer and are ranked among the
foremost western swimmers. Allen,
•who will captain the 1925-26 water polo
team, is among the greatest of all
around swimmers as shown by his win
of third place in the national medley
the early part of the summer. Harry
Glancy, of Cincinnati, placed first with
Stubby Kruger, for many years na
tional medley champion, second, and
Allen a close third.
In this same meet Stevenson took a
fast third in the senior national 880
and a fourth in the mile. Later in the
summer he won the mile at Healsburg,
unexpectedly defeating Lester Smith.
He has made 2:28 in the 220 and
around 58 in the 100-yard dash.
