# RAYMOND KAY SAYS QUAD MANAGER GAINS VALUABLE EXPERIENCE
## 
### 
"It is not often that a man can
handle $20,000 in one year, even when
he has been out of college five or ten
years, much less before he graduates,"
says Raymond Kay, manager of the
1926 Quad, which was published last
June. "That is the great feature of the
managership of the Quad."
Not only the manager, but the men
and women who try out for the mana
gerial positions gain valuable experi
ence, according to Kay. Tryoutees do
a great deal of routine work such as
all business relations require, and
come into contact with many people,
so that later they "know the ropes."
Besides the experience gained, there
is a financial advantage. There are
four salaried positions in the mana
gerial department of the Quad, and all
are granted on the basis of ability as
shown during the tryout period. They
are therefore open to anyone who will
work hard for them.
Work, however, is not the only fea
ture of a connection with the Quad.
The staff holds get-togethers from
time to time, and in the spring, after
the work is all done, gives a dinner
dance for the entire staff. Moreover,
the men and women on the staff are
people with common interests, and
have so far proved very congenial, ac
cording to Kay.
Sophomores are eligible to try out
for managerial positions for their sen*
ior year. The first tryoutee meeting
is to be held Monday afternoon at 4
o'clock in the Quad office. Lowell Mat
thay, manager of this year's book, will
then outline the work and begin mak
ing assignments.

Oklahoma University has an organi
zation called the Jazz Hounds, whose
official pledge button is a rope about
the neck.
