# NEVADA WOLFPACK WILL BRING STRONG ONE AGAINST BEARS
##

UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA,
Oct. I.â€”California vs. Nevada in their
annual football contest of the season,
to be played in the Memorial Stadium,
Berkeley, will bring a fast, hard driv
ing team, represented by the Bears,
up against a strong defensive team
that probably will resort to straight
football tactics.
As the Nevada Wolfpack plays a
standing line formation, Coach Andy
Smith has chosen his heaviest line
plungers to solve their system. There
fore Young will undoubtedly play full
back and Griffin will be shifted to
halfback. With such men as Griffin,
Young, and Dixon, Coach Andy Smith's
men should give Buck Shaw's line
plenty to worry about.
Practice this week has been going
on at stiff pace. Coach Smith has been
drilling his cohorts mainly upon the
kicking game. Andy Smith, in many of
his hardest encounters, will undoubt
edly rely upon his "bootingame."
Coach "Buck" Shaw is indeed for
tunate in having nine veterans return
ing who played against the University
of California last season. The veterans
consist of the following: Captain Tom
Roach, the fighting tackle, and Wal
thers and Larson, ends. Glancing at
the backfield, we find the elusive quar
terback, Gutterson, and Allen, full
back, one the chief ground-gainers of
last year's aggregation.
Ever since the Nevada team has
been playing the University of Cali
fornia they have pointed their team
for the Bruin game. Two years ago the
Wolfpack journeyed to the lair of the
Bears, and held the Bruin eleven to
0-0 tie. Encouraged by their unexpected
tie, they have been spurred on ever
since in an effort to again surprise the
California varsity.
