# ORGAN, HARP, VOICE UNITE FOR RECITAL IN CHURCH TUESDAY
## 
### 
The Committee on Public Exercises
offers the first of the evening series
of events next Tuesday at 7:150 p.m.,
when Organist Warren I). Allen, as
sisted by Robert Leitch, soprano, and
Kathryn July 6, harpist, will be heard
in a sacred concert given in the Me
morial Church.
The combination of two such widely
different instruments as the harp and
organ gives an opportunity for a pro
gram with contrasting instrumental
music, while Miss Leitch's lyric so
prano voice will be he#.rd in works of
a devotional nature such as the Ward
Stephens' "I Will Lift Up Mine Eyes
Unto the Hills."
Miss July 6 will play one of her own
compositions, a harp "Prelude." Her
ability as composer gained her a schol
arship in the Juillard Foundation for
which she also gained a scholarship in
harp playing.
The recital will open with an organ
arrangement of the Sinfonia from the
oratorio "Saul" by G. F. Handel.
Roberta Leitch will sing the aria,
"With Verdure Green the Hills
Appear."
The harp will then be heard in a
version of two dances of the classical
school, a "Courante" and a "Minuet,"
both by John Sebastian Bach. Two
Hebrew songs will be played, the first
a work of ancient traditional melodies,
the "Kol Nedrel," played as part of
the religious service on the holiday
of Repentance. The other is a song
"Kaddisch" or "Hymn for hte Dead,"
by Maurice Ravel, a modern French
composer.
Following the "Prelude for Harp"
by Miss July 6, Mr. Allen will play the
Adagio and Finale from Felix Mendels
sohn's first Sonata.
Other Tuesday events will be an
nounced later.
