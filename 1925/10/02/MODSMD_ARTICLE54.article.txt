# DR. GRAY TEACHES OUTDOOR CLASSES AT BRIGHAM YOUNG
## 
### 
Classes were held under tents at
the outdoor summer session of Brig
ham Young University, in Aspen
Grove, Utah, where Professor Henry
D. Gray of the English department was
a temporary member of the faculty.
"Although the outdoor session is
still in the experimental stage it
seemed very successful," said Dr. Gray.
"The students were extremely earnest
and serious-minded, yet a friendly,
democratic atmosphere prevailed. The
general spirit was reminiscent of Stan
ford twenty years ago in its pleasant
informality.
"For the Mormon people I came to
have a very genuine admiration and
regard. They are scholarly. liberal
minded. and have a very high standard
of morality. Since 1890' anyone in the
church found guilty of polygamy has
been excommunicated, so the present
generation has grown up largely ignor
ant of this feature which outsiders
generally associate with Mormonism,"
Dr. Gray continued.
"The location of Aspen Grove, 7,500
feet up the slope of Mt. Timpanogas,
offered special opportunities in field
work for science students. Classes in
geology, agronomy, entomology, and
botany were held, and Dr. Vasco M.
Tanner, who was awarded his Ph.D.
degree at Stanford last year, was also
a member of the faculty."
Dr. Gray was the orator at the
Fourth of July celebration held in
Provo, Utah, where Brigham Young
University is located.
