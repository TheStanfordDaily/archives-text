three or four paragraphs to welcome
Stanfordites back to school and to |

New students are cordially invited to
become acquainted with this firm. We;
feature Victor records, Victrola and j
Sonora phonographs, leading lines of >
radio receivers, and the various other'
things you would expect to find at ;
Palo Alto's largest and finest music !
store.
We are sorry that University Avenue
is undergoing repair, making automo
bile access to our store somewhat dif- i
ficult, but we hope our hospitality and
service will repay the few extra steps i
reaching us may entail.
This year, as every year, we have
on hand many cheap phonographs
which are just the thing for college.
Prices begin $7.50 and $15.00 will
bring a really good instrument to your
room. No matter what price you pay,
a phonograph purchased here carries 1
a year's guarantee.
And you may have termsâ€”even on j
the cheapest phonograph in the store. |
Here are five sure-fire hits:
Cecilia
The Promenade Walk
