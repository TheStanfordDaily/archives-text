# MUSICAL SEASON TO OPEN WITH CONCERT IN CHURCH SUNDAY
## CLASSICS ON PROGRAM Warren D. Allen Will Play Tri-Weekly Recitals Throughout Year 
### Herbert Klein 
I The first organ recital of the autumn
! quarter will be given in the Memorial
| Church Sunday afternoon at 4 o'clock
| with Warren D. Allen, University or-
I ganist, at the console of the recently
I remodeled organ.
Four compositions are on the pro
gram, representative of the best in
musical literature. A fitting opener for
: the series of recitals is the "Prelude
and Fugue" in I) Major," by John
Sebastian Bach whose contributions to
music, and especially to organ music,
can hardly be overestimated. The Pre
lude and Fugue is one of his greatest
works. On the Rugal section many
melodies are heard at once, all blend
ing to give an impression of harmony
and power. Bach lived in the early
18th century but no one since has ever
equalled him for sincerity and inspira
tion in organ composition.
Based on a quotation from the poetry
I of Alfred Tennyson is the next selec
-1 tion, "The Swan," by Charles Albert
Stebbins. "With an inner voice the
river ran, and down it floated a dying
swan," is the selection given by the
composer as the motif of the piece.
The Allegro Cantabile movement from
the Fifth symphony of C. M. Widor,
i one of the greatest of recent French
organist-composers, will follow. It is
one of the most popular compositions
of this artist who is over eighty years
of age and a national figure. He has
written ten symphonies for the organ,
many selections from which have been
played here.
""A Song of Triumph" from a group
of compositions bv Alec Rowley known
as "A Heroic Suite" will end the re
cital. The next will be on Tuesday
afternoon.
