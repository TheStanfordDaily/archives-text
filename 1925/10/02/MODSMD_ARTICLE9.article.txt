### 
Charles W. Dickenson, temporary
chairman if the freshman sponsors, will

soph mud fight at 3 o'clock in Lagunita

I mour, Wilbur Bailey, George C. Baker,
Hershey Rogers, Robert Hunt, Clark
Cypher, John Worden, Ernest Nevers,
Jacob Irwin, Stanley Weigel, Kenneth
! Thompson, Fred R. Muhs, Arden Allen,

i The idea of fighting until all the mem
; bers of one class have been given a
muddy baptism is an innovation. In
previous years a strict time limit has
been set, but no hindrances have been
! placed in the way of men who wanted
to come back for more after having
been thrown in once. This year the bat
tlers will be driven into roped-ofif squares
as they come out of the pits, and will
be guarded by upper classmen to prevent
them from again becoming belligerents.
Sophomores will meet at Sequoia and
freshmen at Encina tq line up for the
march to the lake. The two squads will
station themselves behind their respec
! tive pits and at a given signal will rush
j toward the enemy, capture as many as
| possible and drag them back to the
water holes for treatment.
According to tradition, the 1928 men
should walk off the field the victors, but
the yearlings must be conceded a chance
to upset the dope. The babes have the
advantage of superior numbers, but the
second-year men have been seasoned by
participation in last year's melee and will
be better organized. Freshman football
men will not be allowed to enter the
fight, coaches fearing possible injury.
