Just What Is
An Automobile?
An automobile is transportation —not
merely a mechanism capable of loco
motion.
When you buy an automobile you
really want transportation, though
sometimes you get only a machine.
The manufacturer makes the machine.
The local dealer enables it to deliver
transportation.
Keep your eye on the main value when
you buy a car. And get it from a dealer
who will not lose interest after you take
possession.

Just What Is
An Automobile?
An automobile is transportation —not
merely a mechanism capable of loco
motion.
When you buy an automobile you
really want transportation, though
sometimes you get only a machine.
The manufacturer makes the machine.
The local dealer enables it to deliver
transportation.
Keep your eye on the main value when
you buy a car. And get it from a dealer
who will not lose interest after you take
possession.
