# CARDS SHOW FLASHES OF CHAMPIONSHIP FORM IN DEFEATING BRONCOS
## IMPROVEMENT IN LINE "Notre Dame Shift" Fails to Aid Santa Clara in Saturday's Game 
### Wlibur Adams 
Playing like Coast champions for about
half of the time, and like cellar champs
the rest of the game, the Stanford varsity
conquered the Santa Clara football team
last Saturday in the stadium by the score
of 20 to 3. Hut those who saw the Stan
ford-Olympic Club disaster on Septem
ber 26, noticed a hundred per cent im
provement in both the Cards line and
backfield. In one week's time Fop War
ner has taught the Stanford squad how
to tackle, how to clip, and, in short, how
to play football.
The center of Stanford's line was like
a stone wall, and not once during the
whole afternoon did the Broncos make
first down through the line. Only once
were the boys from Santa Clara able to
make an appreciable gain through the
line, and that was in the first quarter
when McCormick bucked seven yards
through right guard, but the next two
plays netted only one yard and Casanova
was forced*to kick on the fourth down.
Only twice during the whole game was
Santa Clara able to make first downs,
and both times it was around Stanford's
right end. Pop Warner s men made lirst
downs sixteen times in three quarters,
for not once during the first period was
Stanford able to make the required ten
yards in four downs,
Nevers Gains
Captain Ernie Nevers was the out
standing figure on the field Saturday,
gaining 95 yards on straight bucks for
Stanford. Nevers was never thrown for
a lose, and only twice was he held on the
line of scrimmage. Nevers' consistency
at bucking, kicking, forward passing and
defensive playing should give the coast
an All-American fullback at the end of
this season. Casanova was the star for
the Mission team, making most of their
gains and doing the majority of the
punting. McKee's drop kick from the
40-yard line in the first quarter gave his
team its first and only score of the game.
The longest run of the day was made
by Mike Murphy in the second quarter,
when lie skirted right end for 33 yards.
Shortly after this, he got away again for
a 14-yard run. George Bogue had 46
yards credited to him in four criss-cross
plays. In the last quarter Dick Hyland
took to rugby tactics and ran a punt back
25 yards to the center of the field, lie
sides it was Hyland's well directed for
ward pass to Don Hill, two plays later,
that gave Stanford her last score.
Tackles Work Well
The combination of Ward Poulson and
Leo Harris at tackles was a big improve
ment over last week. On the defense
they were breaking up the end runs bet
ter, and trick plays failed to work against
them. Chris Freeman also did some real
playing at tackle in the few minutes he
played. It was Fred Swan coming out
of the line and running interference for
Bogue on the criss-cross play, that made
that particular play work so well. Both
Swan and Hunt were the material that
made up the stone wall on the defense.
Five ends were used against Santa
Clara, and an improvement was seen in
the working of the wings. Ted Shipkey
played his usual heady game at left end,
and it took the Santa Clara quarterback
only a few minutes to realize that there
was no gain around the left side of
Stanford's line. Fred Price started the
game at right end, but was injured in
the first quarter. Moore and Middleton
finished in his place in the order named.
Greisser replaced Shipkey in the last
period, and although he lacks speed and
weight, he makes up for # this in nerve.
His playing Saturday was of varsity
standing.
Looks Bad at First
The first quarter Saturday resembled
the contest with the clubmen. A fifteen
yard penalty was inflicted on Stanford in
the lirst two minutes of play, and shortly
after this a low pass from ccnter caused
Walker to fumble the ball on his own
30-yard line. The ball was in Stanford's
territory most of the lirst period.
When Stanford finally got started in
the second quarter it took her just live
minutes to go from her own 26-yard line
to a touchdown—the lirst of the season.
The quarter started with Santa Clara
kicking out of bounds on Stanford's 26-
yard line, and then the march to a
touchdown started. Nevcrs made first
downs in two bucks. Murphy and Nev
crs again made lirst downs. This was
followed by a 18-yard run by Bogue, and
another first down by Nevers. Bogue
was good for nine yards and on the next
play Nevers put the pigskin on the 8-yard
line. Murphy went around end for the
touchdown, and then kicked the goal.
The third quarter was scoreless, but

Stanford was pressing the fight into
Santa Clara's ground. Soon after the
last period opened the Cards scoring ma
chine began to work again. Bucks by
Nevers, a 14-yard run by Murphy, and
two passes—Murphy to Bogue, and Nev
ers to Shipkey—put the ball on the two
yard line. The Stanford captain plunged
over for the second touchdown, and
Murphy again added a point *by kicking
the goal.

the rest of the game, the Stanford varsity
conquered the Santa Clara football team
last Saturday in the stadium by the score
of 20 to 3. Hut those who saw the Stan
ford-Olympic Club disaster on Septem
ber 26, noticed a hundred per cent im
provement in both the Cards line and
backfield. In one week's time Fop War
ner has taught the Stanford squad how
to tackle, how to clip, and, in short, how
to play football.
The center of Stanford's line was like
a stone wall, and not once during the
whole afternoon did the Broncos make
first down through the line. Only once
were the boys from Santa Clara able to
make an appreciable gain through the
line, and that was in the first quarter
when McCormick bucked seven yards
through right guard, but the next two
plays netted only one yard and Casanova
was forced*to kick on the fourth down.
Only twice during the whole game was
Santa Clara able to make first downs,
and both times it was around Stanford's
right end. Pop Warner s men made lirst
downs sixteen times in three quarters,
for not once during the first period was
Stanford able to make the required ten
yards in four downs,
Nevers Gains
Captain Ernie Nevers was the out
standing figure on the field Saturday,
gaining 95 yards on straight bucks for
Stanford. Nevers was never thrown for
a lose, and only twice was he held on the
line of scrimmage. Nevers' consistency
at bucking, kicking, forward passing and
defensive playing should give the coast
an All-American fullback at the end of
this season. Casanova was the star for
the Mission team, making most of their
gains and doing the majority of the
punting. McKee's drop kick from the
40-yard line in the first quarter gave his
team its first and only score of the game.
The longest run of the day was made
by Mike Murphy in the second quarter,
when lie skirted right end for 33 yards.
Shortly after this, he got away again for
a 14-yard run. George Bogue had 46
yards credited to him in four criss-cross
plays. In the last quarter Dick Hyland
took to rugby tactics and ran a punt back
25 yards to the center of the field, lie
sides it was Hyland's well directed for
ward pass to Don Hill, two plays later,
that gave Stanford her last score.
Tackles Work Well
The combination of Ward Poulson and
Leo Harris at tackles was a big improve
ment over last week. On the defense
they were breaking up the end runs bet
ter, and trick plays failed to work against
them. Chris Freeman also did some real
playing at tackle in the few minutes he
played. It was Fred Swan coming out
of the line and running interference for
Bogue on the criss-cross play, that made
that particular play work so well. Both
Swan and Hunt were the material that
made up the stone wall on the defense.
Five ends were used against Santa
Clara, and an improvement was seen in
the working of the wings. Ted Shipkey
played his usual heady game at left end,
and it took the Santa Clara quarterback
only a few minutes to realize that there
was no gain around the left side of
Stanford's line. Fred Price started the
game at right end, but was injured in
the first quarter. Moore and Middleton
finished in his place in the order named.
Greisser replaced Shipkey in the last
period, and although he lacks speed and
weight, he makes up for # this in nerve.
His playing Saturday was of varsity
standing.
Looks Bad at First
The first quarter Saturday resembled
the contest with the clubmen. A fifteen
yard penalty was inflicted on Stanford in
the lirst two minutes of play, and shortly
after this a low pass from ccnter caused
Walker to fumble the ball on his own
30-yard line. The ball was in Stanford's
territory most of the lirst period.
When Stanford finally got started in
the second quarter it took her just live
minutes to go from her own 26-yard line
to a touchdown—the lirst of the season.
The quarter started with Santa Clara
kicking out of bounds on Stanford's 26-
yard line, and then the march to a
touchdown started. Nevcrs made first
downs in two bucks. Murphy and Nev
crs again made lirst downs. This was
followed by a 18-yard run by Bogue, and
another first down by Nevers. Bogue
was good for nine yards and on the next
play Nevers put the pigskin on the 8-yard
line. Murphy went around end for the
touchdown, and then kicked the goal.
The third quarter was scoreless, but

Stanford was pressing the fight into
Santa Clara's ground. Soon after the
last period opened the Cards scoring ma
chine began to work again. Bucks by
Nevers, a 14-yard run by Murphy, and
two passes—Murphy to Bogue, and Nev
ers to Shipkey—put the ball on the two
yard line. The Stanford captain plunged
over for the second touchdown, and
Murphy again added a point *by kicking
the goal.

ber 26, noticed a hundred per cent im
provement in both the Cards line and
backfield. In one week's time Fop War
ner has taught the Stanford squad how
to tackle, how to clip, and, in short, how
to play football.
The center of Stanford's line was like
a stone wall, and not once during the
whole afternoon did the Broncos make
first down through the line. Only once
were the boys from Santa Clara able to
make an appreciable gain through the
line, and that was in the first quarter
when McCormick bucked seven yards
through right guard, but the next two
plays netted only one yard and Casanova
was forced*to kick on the fourth down.
Only twice during the whole game was
Santa Clara able to make first downs,
and both times it was around Stanford's
right end. Pop Warner s men made lirst
downs sixteen times in three quarters,
for not once during the first period was
Stanford able to make the required ten
yards in four downs,
Nevers Gains
Captain Ernie Nevers was the out
standing figure on the field Saturday,
gaining 95 yards on straight bucks for
Stanford. Nevers was never thrown for
a lose, and only twice was he held on the
line of scrimmage. Nevers' consistency
at bucking, kicking, forward passing and
defensive playing should give the coast
an All-American fullback at the end of
this season. Casanova was the star for
the Mission team, making most of their
gains and doing the majority of the
punting. McKee's drop kick from the
40-yard line in the first quarter gave his
team its first and only score of the game.
The longest run of the day was made
by Mike Murphy in the second quarter,
when lie skirted right end for 33 yards.
Shortly after this, he got away again for
a 14-yard run. George Bogue had 46
yards credited to him in four criss-cross
plays. In the last quarter Dick Hyland
took to rugby tactics and ran a punt back
25 yards to the center of the field, lie
sides it was Hyland's well directed for
ward pass to Don Hill, two plays later,
that gave Stanford her last score.
Tackles Work Well
The combination of Ward Poulson and
Leo Harris at tackles was a big improve
ment over last week. On the defense
they were breaking up the end runs bet
ter, and trick plays failed to work against
them. Chris Freeman also did some real
playing at tackle in the few minutes he
played. It was Fred Swan coming out
of the line and running interference for
Bogue on the criss-cross play, that made
that particular play work so well. Both
Swan and Hunt were the material that
made up the stone wall on the defense.
Five ends were used against Santa
Clara, and an improvement was seen in
the working of the wings. Ted Shipkey
played his usual heady game at left end,
and it took the Santa Clara quarterback
only a few minutes to realize that there
was no gain around the left side of
Stanford's line. Fred Price started the
game at right end, but was injured in
the first quarter. Moore and Middleton
finished in his place in the order named.
Greisser replaced Shipkey in the last
period, and although he lacks speed and
weight, he makes up for # this in nerve.
His playing Saturday was of varsity
standing.
Looks Bad at First
The first quarter Saturday resembled
the contest with the clubmen. A fifteen
yard penalty was inflicted on Stanford in
the lirst two minutes of play, and shortly
after this a low pass from ccnter caused
Walker to fumble the ball on his own
30-yard line. The ball was in Stanford's
territory most of the lirst period.
When Stanford finally got started in
the second quarter it took her just live
minutes to go from her own 26-yard line
to a touchdown—the lirst of the season.
The quarter started with Santa Clara
kicking out of bounds on Stanford's 26-
yard line, and then the march to a
touchdown started. Nevcrs made first
downs in two bucks. Murphy and Nev
crs again made lirst downs. This was
followed by a 18-yard run by Bogue, and
another first down by Nevers. Bogue
was good for nine yards and on the next
play Nevers put the pigskin on the 8-yard
line. Murphy went around end for the
touchdown, and then kicked the goal.
The third quarter was scoreless, but

Stanford was pressing the fight into
Santa Clara's ground. Soon after the
last period opened the Cards scoring ma
chine began to work again. Bucks by
Nevers, a 14-yard run by Murphy, and
two passes—Murphy to Bogue, and Nev
ers to Shipkey—put the ball on the two
yard line. The Stanford captain plunged
over for the second touchdown, and
Murphy again added a point *by kicking
the goal.
