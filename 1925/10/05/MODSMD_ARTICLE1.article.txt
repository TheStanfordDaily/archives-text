# CARDS SHOW FLASHES OF CHAMPIONSHIP FORM IN DEFEATING BRONCOS
## IMPROVEMENT IN LINE "Notre Dame Shift" Fails to Aid Santa Clara in Saturday's Game 
### Wlibur Adams 
Playing like Coast champions for about
half of the time, and like cellar champs
the rest of the game, the Stanford varsity
conquered the Santa Clara football team
last Saturday in the stadium by the score
of 20 to 3. Hut those who saw the Stan
ford-Olympic Club disaster on Septem
ber 26, noticed a hundred per cent im
provement in both the Cards line and
backfield. In one week's time Fop War
ner has taught the Stanford squad how
to tackle, how to clip, and, in short, how
to play football.
The center of Stanford's line was like
a stone wall, and not once during the
whole afternoon did the Broncos make
first down through the line. Only once
were the boys from Santa Clara able to
make an appreciable gain through the
line, and that was in the first quarter
when McCormick bucked seven yards
through right guard, but the next two
plays netted only one yard and Casanova
was forced*to kick on the fourth down.
Only twice during the whole game was
Santa Clara able to make first downs,
and both times it was around Stanford's
right end. Pop Warner s men made lirst
downs sixteen times in three quarters,
for not once during the first period was
Stanford able to make the required ten
yards in four downs,
Nevers Gains
Captain Ernie Nevers was the out
standing figure on the field Saturday,
gaining 95 yards on straight bucks for
Stanford. Nevers was never thrown for
a lose, and only twice was he held on the
line of scrimmage. Nevers' consistency
at bucking, kicking, forward passing and
defensive playing should give the coast
an All-American fullback at the end of
this season. Casanova was the star for
the Mission team, making most of their
gains and doing the majority of the
punting. McKee's drop kick from the
40-yard line in the first quarter gave his
team its first and only score of the game.
The longest run of the day was made
