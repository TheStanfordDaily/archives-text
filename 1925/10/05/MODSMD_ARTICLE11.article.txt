# BABES MEET SOPHS IN MUD SCRIMMAGE AT LAGUNITA
## WILL BE FINISH FIGHT Contestants to Be Barred From Battling After First Baptism 
### 
Prepared to fight to a finish to settle
| the disputed question of class supre
macy, freshman and sophomore men
will meet on the dry Lagunita bottom
at 3 tomorrow afternoon in the annual
mud battle.
Fortified by the victorious records of
the two previous sophomore classes
and by experience and organization,
the sophs are predicted to win. But the
freshmen, with superior numbers and
advice from the sponsors, may spring
a surprise. Coach Husky Hunt's edict
banning all 1929 football men from
participation in the clash because of
possible injuries which might result
therefrom robs the yearlings of their
brawniest members.
The mud fight is one of the few re
maining Stanford traditions of this
type. Adopted in the fall of 1923 at the
time senior control and the sponsor
system were substituted for sophomore
discipline, it was intended to provide
a method of expression of class rivalry
without serious injury to any of the
combatants. Nothing worse than minor
scratches and bruises have been suf
fered in the two previous fights.
The sponsors feel that there is no
cause for hard feeling or slugging. To
insure fair play and to provide as ex
citing a tussle as possible they have,
through their chairman, Charles W.
Dickenson, drawn up the following
rules:
