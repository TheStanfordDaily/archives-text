# Wife's Cooking May Bring Tiny's Luck
## 
### 
The secret of the athletic prowess of
S. Glenn (Tiny) Hartranft may at last
have been discovered, for Mrs. Glenn
Hartranft was a prize winner in a pie
baking contest held at Gilroy October 2.
While this does not mean that "Tiny"
adopts pie as his sole training ration, the
indication is that Mrs. Hartranft's cook
ing has something to do with his phe
nomenal ability on the field and track.
Mrs. Hartranft took third prize among
a hundred entrants in a contest held by
the Gilroy Evening Dispatch Free Elec
tric Cooking School.
"Tiny" is at present working at the
San Juan cement plant, a few miles south
of Gilroy, where the couple are living.
