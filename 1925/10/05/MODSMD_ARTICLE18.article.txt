# Harpist, Singer to Join Church Organist Allen In First Fall Program
## 
### 
Warren D. Allen, University organist,
will be joined by Roberta Leitch, lyric
soprano of Carrnel-by-the-Sea, and
Kathryn Julye, solo harpist of San
Francisco, in a concert Tuesday evening
at 7:30 in the Memorial Church. This is
the first musical event of the quarter in
which off-campus performers have taken
part. The compositions are arranged to
give each musician a part of prominence.
Kathryn Julye has the distinction of
being a finished composer for the harp.
Her own work, "Prelude for Harp," will
l>e one of the selections. Besides this
she will play two of the formal dances
of the classical school by John Sebastian
Bach arranged for the harp.
Oratorios will be well represented on
the program with a selection from "The
Creation," Joseph Haydn, and one from
"Saul," by George Frederick Handel,
who developed the oratorio as a musical
form. The entire program is in keeping
with the setting of the Memorial Church
and the name of Sacred Concert.
Of interest, musically, should be the
Hebrew song composed by Maurice
Ravel, one of the most noted of con
temporary French composers. It is
placed alongside an authentic and tra
ditional Hebrew melody, the noted "Kol
Nedrei," which should furnish an inter
esting comparison.
