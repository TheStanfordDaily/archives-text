# Cornering Campus Honors

### 
Tomorrow students must select a yell leader for the coming year at
a general Quad election. One of the candidates is a man who has
already held this honor for the regular term of one year. His standing for
reelection is unprecedented at Stanford, and if the tryoutee system means
anything, is unreasonable, to say the least. What will become of the try-out
system which is doing so much good in filling positions of importance at
the University if men are allowed to come back after a year's absence and
regain positions they have previously held, thereby barring candidates who
have t>een striving for two years to overcome the normal competition of
their classmates ?
Burt Lapp was yell leader year before last. Undoubtedly he was a
good one, and no fault can be found with his ability. But he has had his
day and it is his duty to step back to let another well-qualified and
deserving man have the chance which is rightfully his. Evert H. Young
and Raitt Boren won the right to be assistant yell leaders last year.
Young left school in April to conduct an orchestra on a Dollar round
the-world steamship. His position was taken by Frederic Tyroler who
opposed Boren at the spring election. Boren won the election, but has
since left the University. Young and Tyroler are the only men who are
really eligible for this election, and in all fairness one or the other of
them should be elected. Tyroler has withdrawn from the race, leaving
Young the only qualified candidate under the provisions of the tryoutee
system.
Lapp is eligible because of constitutional discrepancies which fail to
strictly construe such a condition. One of the fundamental principles of
a democracy is that no one man should retain unjustly honors to the
detriment of others. This rule has been followed at Stanford, for
no Stanford man has ever twice made a decided stand for a position of
this kind. Voters should uphold the just and fair traditions of their
school, and should elect the man who has won the right for his position
by successfully winning the tryoutee competition.
The Daily Palo Alto will not go into the merits of the two candi
dates. Both of them are well qualified for the position. The real question
at issue is of the permanence of the tryoutee system. If Lapp is elected
there will be less incentive for a freshman or sophomore to try out for a
position, because he will never be sure that that position will become
vacant, if it becomes possible for a man. to go on holding the job year
after vear.
