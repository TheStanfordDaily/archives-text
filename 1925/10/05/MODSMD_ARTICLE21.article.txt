# Freshman Scholarship
## 
### 
Now that the initial hubbub and scurry of registration has passed it
is high time that tlie freshmen seriously consider their position at Stan- <
ford. Every year some of the most promising" of the incoming students j
fail to do this until it is too late, and at the end of the first quarter find
themselves among the "flunk-outs."
Stanford is known as a hard school into which to gain admission. j
Many declare that it is a terror to stay in after you have gotten over the
first hump. These students have but a single reason for such a statement i
—they failed to apply themselves during the quarters when they might
have been piling up honor points. Probably the movie mania, or the ■
poker bug, or the love curse got the best of them. At least something ;
entered into the field of study and won a decisive battle.
A very few hours a day of intelligent application will work wonders
with your grades. College is different from high school in that professors ]
do not pass students on their reputations. If the student has done the
work he gets the grade. If he doesn't rate it—well it's just too bad,
that's all. |
Freshmen owe themselves and their parents who are sending them!
here a duty to apply themselves faithfully. No one wants you to be a j
perverted student. The man who gets straight A's without tasting of a i
single outside activity or amusement is to be condemned and pitied rather j
than praised. By far the greater side of college is the friendships yon
will make and the broadening influences you encounter. A head crammed .
with facts and scholastic theories will be of little avail if you have not
developed the personality, the poise, and the physique to go with it.
Therefore, to get the most out of college an intelligent division of the |
twenty-four hours in a day must be made. A certain time should be
devoted to study, and classes should always be attended. Don't get in j
the habit of class-cutting. It doesn't pay in the end. \\ hen the classcs j
are over and the assignments for the next day are completed, the student j
should get out and mix with the members of the University colony. But <
first, be sure and go to classes and get your work for the next day. No
use developing into a bookworm or a drudge. A happy medium is found
bv getting the daily assignments, and then seeking outside amusement.
Men who have been out of college in business life for many years
frequently come back to take professional courses. These men have
l»een out exchanging hard knocks with the world and know what is
necessary in the fight of life. They, almost without exception, apply
business principles to their study, and their grades are correspondingly
good. As an example, one man spends from 1 to 4 o'clock in the library
every day—not sleeping or in a bull session, but in good, hard, concen
trated study. At 4 o'clock he leaves the library, and the rest of the day
is his to use as he pleases. Isn't that a better system than to keep
putting off until the last minute —the tnauafia habit of the Spaniard?
Freshmen who take their work seriously will find that by attending
classes regularly and by keeping regular "office hours for study every
day, their grades will be satisfactory, their work will be done, and they
will never be cramped for time, but will always have plenty of time in
which to go out and get the other benefits of college. Apply business
principles to your work and watch the results.

necessary in the fight of life. They, almost without exception, apply
business principles to their study, and their grades are correspondingly
good. As an example, one man spends from 1 to 4 o'clock in the library
every day—not sleeping or in a bull session, but in good, hard, concen
trated study. At 4 o'clock he leaves the library, and the rest of the day
is his to use as he pleases. Isn't that a better system than to keep
putting off until the last minute —the tnauafia habit of the Spaniard?
Freshmen who take their work seriously will find that by attending
classes regularly and by keeping regular "office hours for study every
day, their grades will be satisfactory, their work will be done, and they
will never be cramped for time, but will always have plenty of time in
which to go out and get the other benefits of college. Apply business
principles to your work and watch the results.
Now that the initial hubbub and scurry of registration has passed it
is high time that tlie freshmen seriously consider their position at Stan- <
ford. Every year some of the most promising" of the incoming students j
fail to do this until it is too late, and at the end of the first quarter find
themselves among the "flunk-outs."
Stanford is known as a hard school into which to gain admission. j
Many declare that it is a terror to stay in after you have gotten over the
first hump. These students have but a single reason for such a statement i
—they failed to apply themselves during the quarters when they might
have been piling up honor points. Probably the movie mania, or the ■
poker bug, or the love curse got the best of them. At least something ;
entered into the field of study and won a decisive battle.
A very few hours a day of intelligent application will work wonders
with your grades. College is different from high school in that professors ]
do not pass students on their reputations. If the student has done the
work he gets the grade. If he doesn't rate it—well it's just too bad,
that's all. |
Freshmen owe themselves and their parents who are sending them!
here a duty to apply themselves faithfully. No one wants you to be a j
perverted student. The man who gets straight A's without tasting of a i
single outside activity or amusement is to be condemned and pitied rather j
than praised. By far the greater side of college is the friendships yon
will make and the broadening influences you encounter. A head crammed .
with facts and scholastic theories will be of little avail if you have not
developed the personality, the poise, and the physique to go with it.
Therefore, to get the most out of college an intelligent division of the |
twenty-four hours in a day must be made. A certain time should be
devoted to study, and classes should always be attended. Don't get in j
the habit of class-cutting. It doesn't pay in the end. \\ hen the classcs j
are over and the assignments for the next day are completed, the student j
should get out and mix with the members of the University colony. But <
first, be sure and go to classes and get your work for the next day. No
use developing into a bookworm or a drudge. A happy medium is found
bv getting the daily assignments, and then seeking outside amusement.
Men who have been out of college in business life for many years
frequently come back to take professional courses. These men have
