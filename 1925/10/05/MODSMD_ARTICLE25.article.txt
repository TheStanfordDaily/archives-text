## 
### 
College students arc not frivolous, im
j moral or lacking in ambition, says Dr.
| W. L. Howard, director of the branch of
i the College of Agriculture, University of
â€¢ California, at Davis. Dr. Howard vig
j orously defends the young men and
| women students of the university, saying:
"We hear much talk these days about
; the alleged frivolity of college students,
their godlessness, immorality, and lack
| of purpose, but I am convinced that most
I of this criticism is dyspeptic. My faith
! in the average student and his reliability
I and integrity of purpose is greater today
i than ever before."
