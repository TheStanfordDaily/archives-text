# CLASS TIE-UPS, POSTER FIGHTS BELONG TO PAST
## 
### Monroe Eaton 
The history of the annual autumn
hostilities between the freshman and
sophomore classes is as old as that
of the university. It was not until the
fall of 1904, however, that anything
like an organized class battle took
place. At that time a band of about
seventy-five freshmen succeeded in
submerging fifty sophomores in the
showers and bath tubs in Encina hall.
This was the only class rush in the
history of the university in which the
lreshmen won the laurels.
The first class rush to be held under
the supervision of upper-classmen took
place in 190 G. In that year the sopho
mores challenged the freshmen to a
game of rugby football. About a
hundred representatives from each
class spent an hour trying to carry a
touchdown. Superior organization en
abled the sophomores to defeat the
freshmen by two touchdowns. Dur
ing this contest the air was so filled
with dust that spectators were scarcely
iible to see the fray.
First Tie-up in '07
The first of the annual freshman
sophomore tie-ups was held in the
fall of 1907. This fight lived the
longest of any of the class encounters
at Stanford. It was repeated with
almost the same rules every autumn
for fifteen years. The two classes
lined up at either end of the football
field, and at a gun-shot rushed together
and attempted to tie up as many mem
bers of the opposing class as was pos
sible.
After the captives had been bound
they were painted with red or green
paint and placed in the "morgue."
Once there they were supposedly out
of the contest, but escaped prisoners
often returned to the fight. Needless
to say, the sophomores always won,
either by their own numbers and or
ganization or with the assistance of
the upper-classmen. The tie-up was
supposed to end all class hostilities.
Hazing, was usually contin
ued throughout the year.
The poster fight had its beginning
in 1910 when a party of freshmen
held up an auto in which the sopho
more posters were being transported
from San Jose, capturing and destroy
ing the whole set of posters. The soph
omores returned to San Jose and, by
getting the printer out of bed at three
o'clock in the morning, succeeded in
having a new batch of posters run off.
These were rushed to the campus in
time to be pasted up before morning
classes.
Sophs Guard Posters
In later years guards of sophomores
were placed around the campus while
the posters were being put up. Not in
frequently the freshmen sallied forth
in a body and attempted to destroy
the paper threats of the sophomores
before the light of day could disclose
them. The result was that every year
a fierce battle took place on the Row.
The weapons used principally were
garden liofees, ropes and bandages. A
great many freshmen and sophomores
had their internal anatomy filled with
Searsville water, and the lawns of the
fraternity houses were left strewn
with bloody and tattered garments.
The huge loss of clothing and de
struction of property in the poster fight
finally made it necessary that the
contest be placed under the supervi
sion of the upper-classmen. In this
way the poster fight, took on a definite
form.
Pitched Battles
The two opposing classes went into
camp in the hills the evening before
the fight and scouts were sent out to
watch the maneuvers of the enemy. At
two o'clock in the morning the two
classes lined up on the lawns of the
fraternity houses at the end of the
How and at a gunshot the fight began.
While the fight was going on the
poster committee was doing its work.
If the freshmen won they could tear
down the posters; if the sophomores
won. as they usually did, the posters

| stayed up. The class tie-up always
i took place the afternoon following the
! poster fight.
Last Poster Fight in '22
The last poster fight and tie-up took
place in 1922. This combat was so
ferocious, and the hazing and class
hostility continued for so long a time
! after the tie-up, that a committee of
upper-classmen was formed to regu
; late class fights. The result of the
taming was the mud fight which has
taken the place of the poster fight and
tie-up for the last three years.

paint and placed in the "morgue."
Once there they were supposedly out

often returned to the fight. Needless

either by their own numbers and or
ganization or with the assistance of
the upper-classmen. The tie-up was

The poster fight had its beginning
in 1910 when a party of freshmen
held up an auto in which the sopho
more posters were being transported
from San Jose, capturing and destroy
ing the whole set of posters. The soph
omores returned to San Jose and, by
getting the printer out of bed at three
o'clock in the morning, succeeded in
having a new batch of posters run off.
These were rushed to the campus in
time to be pasted up before morning
classes.
Sophs Guard Posters
In later years guards of sophomores
were placed around the campus while
the posters were being put up. Not in
frequently the freshmen sallied forth
in a body and attempted to destroy
the paper threats of the sophomores
before the light of day could disclose
them. The result was that every year
a fierce battle took place on the Row.
The weapons used principally were
garden liofees, ropes and bandages. A
great many freshmen and sophomores
had their internal anatomy filled with
Searsville water, and the lawns of the
fraternity houses were left strewn
with bloody and tattered garments.
The huge loss of clothing and de
struction of property in the poster fight
finally made it necessary that the
contest be placed under the supervi
sion of the upper-classmen. In this
way the poster fight, took on a definite
form.
Pitched Battles
The two opposing classes went into
camp in the hills the evening before
the fight and scouts were sent out to
watch the maneuvers of the enemy. At
two o'clock in the morning the two
classes lined up on the lawns of the
fraternity houses at the end of the
How and at a gunshot the fight began.
While the fight was going on the
poster committee was doing its work.
If the freshmen won they could tear
down the posters; if the sophomores
won. as they usually did, the posters

| stayed up. The class tie-up always
i took place the afternoon following the
! poster fight.
Last Poster Fight in '22
The last poster fight and tie-up took
place in 1922. This combat was so
ferocious, and the hazing and class
hostility continued for so long a time
! after the tie-up, that a committee of
upper-classmen was formed to regu
; late class fights. The result of the
taming was the mud fight which has
taken the place of the poster fight and
tie-up for the last three years.

The history of the annual autumn
hostilities between the freshman and
sophomore classes is as old as that
of the university. It was not until the
fall of 1904, however, that anything
like an organized class battle took
place. At that time a band of about
seventy-five freshmen succeeded in
submerging fifty sophomores in the
showers and bath tubs in Encina hall.
This was the only class rush in the
history of the university in which the
lreshmen won the laurels.
The first class rush to be held under
the supervision of upper-classmen took
place in 190 G. In that year the sopho
mores challenged the freshmen to a
game of rugby football. About a
hundred representatives from each
class spent an hour trying to carry a
touchdown. Superior organization en
abled the sophomores to defeat the

lined up at either end of the football
field, and at a gun-shot rushed together

Pitched Battles
The two opposing classes went into

Last Poster Fight in '22
The last poster fight and tie-up took
place in 1922. This combat was so
ferocious, and the hazing and class
hostility continued for so long a time
! after the tie-up, that a committee of
upper-classmen was formed to regu

taming was the mud fight which has
taken the place of the poster fight and
tie-up for the last three years.

The history of the annual autumn
hostilities between the freshman and
sophomore classes is as old as that
of the university. It was not until the
fall of 1904, however, that anything
like an organized class battle took
place. At that time a band of about
seventy-five freshmen succeeded in
submerging fifty sophomores in the
showers and bath tubs in Encina hall.
This was the only class rush in the
history of the university in which the
lreshmen won the laurels.
The first class rush to be held under
the supervision of upper-classmen took
place in 190 G. In that year the sopho
mores challenged the freshmen to a
game of rugby football. About a
hundred representatives from each
class spent an hour trying to carry a
touchdown. Superior organization en
abled the sophomores to defeat the
freshmen by two touchdowns. Dur
ing this contest the air was so filled
with dust that spectators were scarcely
iible to see the fray.
First Tie-up in '07
The first of the annual freshman
sophomore tie-ups was held in the
fall of 1907. This fight lived the
longest of any of the class encounters
at Stanford. It was repeated with
almost the same rules every autumn
for fifteen years. The two classes
lined up at either end of the football
field, and at a gun-shot rushed together
and attempted to tie up as many mem
bers of the opposing class as was pos
sible.
After the captives had been bound
they were painted with red or green
paint and placed in the "morgue."
Once there they were supposedly out
of the contest, but escaped prisoners
often returned to the fight. Needless
to say, the sophomores always won,
either by their own numbers and or
ganization or with the assistance of
the upper-classmen. The tie-up was
supposed to end all class hostilities.
Hazing, was usually contin
ued throughout the year.
The poster fight had its beginning
in 1910 when a party of freshmen
held up an auto in which the sopho
more posters were being transported
from San Jose, capturing and destroy
ing the whole set of posters. The soph
omores returned to San Jose and, by
getting the printer out of bed at three
o'clock in the morning, succeeded in
having a new batch of posters run off.
These were rushed to the campus in
time to be pasted up before morning
classes.
Sophs Guard Posters
In later years guards of sophomores
were placed around the campus while
the posters were being put up. Not in
frequently the freshmen sallied forth
in a body and attempted to destroy
the paper threats of the sophomores
before the light of day could disclose
them. The result was that every year
a fierce battle took place on the Row.
The weapons used principally were
garden liofees, ropes and bandages. A
great many freshmen and sophomores
had their internal anatomy filled with
Searsville water, and the lawns of the
fraternity houses were left strewn
with bloody and tattered garments.
The huge loss of clothing and de
struction of property in the poster fight
finally made it necessary that the
contest be placed under the supervi
sion of the upper-classmen. In this
way the poster fight, took on a definite
form.
