# NEW GRID RATE SYSTEM DEVISED BY ILLINOIS MAN
## 
### 
Frank G. Dickinson of the University of Illinois Economics department has
devised a new system for rating the football teams in a given conference. Accord
ing to Dickinson, the percentage system is inadequate, while the new system gives
it reliable rating by considering the relative merit of the teams defeated and
awarding points accordingly.
The teams in the conference under discussion are divided into two divisions
al the end of the season, one for the teams with a percentage average of more than
.500, the other for those who fall below this mark. When a team in the first
division defeats a team in the first division it receives more points thart if it had
defeated u team in the second division. Likewise when a team in the lower bracket
vanquishes one from the upper it receives more points than if it had won a game
from a team in its own division. A provision is made whereby the aggregate
points allotted the teams are evenly divided in case of a tie.
Dickinson writes as follows:
"The 1 Pacific Coast championship was full of thrills and uncertainty.
Stanford and California had the best records for the season. But neither of them
lost a game, thus leaving them tied with 1.000 per cent when the season ended—a
lrcquent occurrence whenever the percentage system is used. Furthermore, Stan
ford finished her game in whirlwind style and tied California, 20-20. Some sports
writers on the Pacific Coast recognized Stanford as champion because her team had
won three games and tied only one game; whereas California had two victories
and two ties. The only difference between their records is that the Golden Bears
were held to a tie, while the Cardinals were gaining a victory.
But the wide awake gridiron fan wants to know something about the caliber
of the opponents. The Dickinson Football Rating System has gained most of its
supporters because U. refuses to give any team the conference championship until
due consideration has been given to the weakness or strength of the opposing
teams. California is given lirst place in this system because she tied the strong
Washington eleven (counting 22.5 points), while Stanford was defeating the cellar
team of the Conference, Montana (counting 20.00 points). Below is given the
Dickinson Rating for the Pacific Coast Conference in 1924:

"The 1 Pacific Coast championship was full of thrills and uncertainty.
Stanford and California had the best records for the season. But neither of them
lost a game, thus leaving them tied with 1.000 per cent when the season ended—a
lrcquent occurrence whenever the percentage system is used. Furthermore, Stan
ford finished her game in whirlwind style and tied California, 20-20. Some sports
writers on the Pacific Coast recognized Stanford as champion because her team had
won three games and tied only one game; whereas California had two victories
and two ties. The only difference between their records is that the Golden Bears
were held to a tie, while the Cardinals were gaining a victory.
But the wide awake gridiron fan wants to know something about the caliber
of the opponents. The Dickinson Football Rating System has gained most of its
supporters because U. refuses to give any team the conference championship until
due consideration has been given to the weakness or strength of the opposing
teams. California is given lirst place in this system because she tied the strong
Washington eleven (counting 22.5 points), while Stanford was defeating the cellar
team of the Conference, Montana (counting 20.00 points). Below is given the
Dickinson Rating for the Pacific Coast Conference in 1924:

Frank G. Dickinson of the University of Illinois Economics department has
devised a new system for rating the football teams in a given conference. Accord
ing to Dickinson, the percentage system is inadequate, while the new system gives
it reliable rating by considering the relative merit of the teams defeated and
awarding points accordingly.
The teams in the conference under discussion are divided into two divisions
al the end of the season, one for the teams with a percentage average of more than
.500, the other for those who fall below this mark. When a team in the first
division defeats a team in the first division it receives more points thart if it had
defeated u team in the second division. Likewise when a team in the lower bracket
vanquishes one from the upper it receives more points than if it had won a game
from a team in its own division. A provision is made whereby the aggregate
points allotted the teams are evenly divided in case of a tie.
