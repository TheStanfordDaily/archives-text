# CARD WATER POLO TEAM SHOWS GREAT POSSIBLE STRENGTH
## Wally O'Connor, Seasoned Player, Balances Loss Of Elmer Collett 
### llerb Klein 
Stanford's water polo team this year
will be one of possible great power, ac
cording to all present indications. Al
though the Cardinal team which made a
very satisfactory showing in the nationals
last year will he hard to surpass the ma
terial, both new and old, from which
Ernst Brandsten, coach of aquatic sports,
has to draw, is exceptionally strong.
To counterbalance the loss of Elmer
Collett, star goaltender, whose long*
reach and uncanny accuracy kept many
a shot from scoring, is the return of
Wally O'Connor, one of the greatest
forwards in the game, as shown by his
selection for the last Olympic team. To
replace Collett, Poulsen, Le Feber, or
Morrison should be able to develop suffi
cient ability in keeping the ball- away
from the goal net.
Making bids for forward positions
alongside O'Connor will be Art Stewart,
a consistent player of last year's team,
and Andrews and Vanden Akker, ex
freshmen. Ed Luster was counted upon
to fill a forward's betrh this year and
will be missed, but there will be more
than enough talent to rcplace him.
Bob Meyers and Jim Carson, both sea
soned veterans, will probably be able to
work out with the team and, though in
eligible for further intercollegiate com
petition, may play against non-college
teams.
An inventory of the backfield promises
a team as strong on the defense as the
offense and one that should be able to
keep the ball hovering close to the op
ponents' goal than their own. Arden
Allen, team captain, has talent as either
forward or back, but it is probable that
his ability at getting the ball away from
the other man and his long throws will
make him most valuable in the defensive
line.
Allen has guarded some of the great
est players in the game but has seldom
been scored against.
Bob Williams showed great promise
at the end rff last season «and should
make a guard. Bob Sims, now playing
freshman football, will be eligible for
the varsity water polo team. As guard
on the last freshman team he proved to
be a hard man to shake off or to keep
the hall from. Bill Hollingsworth is also
a capable guard. Both Allen and Wil
liams have lots of speed in the water
and can dribble the ball up when called
upon to within shooting distance so that
the backfield will carry the double threat
of dangerous passing and swimming
attacks.

terial, both new and old, from which
Ernst Brandsten, coach of aquatic sports,
has to draw, is exceptionally strong.
To counterbalance the loss of Elmer
Collett, star goaltender, whose long*
reach and uncanny accuracy kept many
a shot from scoring, is the return of
Wally O'Connor, one of the greatest
forwards in the game, as shown by his
selection for the last Olympic team. To
replace Collett, Poulsen, Le Feber, or
Morrison should be able to develop suffi
cient ability in keeping the ball- away
from the goal net.
Making bids for forward positions
alongside O'Connor will be Art Stewart,
a consistent player of last year's team,
and Andrews and Vanden Akker, ex
freshmen. Ed Luster was counted upon
to fill a forward's betrh this year and
will be missed, but there will be more
than enough talent to rcplace him.
Bob Meyers and Jim Carson, both sea
soned veterans, will probably be able to
work out with the team and, though in
eligible for further intercollegiate com
petition, may play against non-college
teams.
An inventory of the backfield promises
a team as strong on the defense as the
offense and one that should be able to
keep the ball hovering close to the op
ponents' goal than their own. Arden
Allen, team captain, has talent as either
forward or back, but it is probable that
his ability at getting the ball away from
the other man and his long throws will
make him most valuable in the defensive
line.
Allen has guarded some of the great
est players in the game but has seldom
been scored against.
Bob Williams showed great promise
at the end rff last season «and should
make a guard. Bob Sims, now playing
freshman football, will be eligible for
the varsity water polo team. As guard
on the last freshman team he proved to
be a hard man to shake off or to keep
the hall from. Bill Hollingsworth is also
a capable guard. Both Allen and Wil
liams have lots of speed in the water
and can dribble the ball up when called
upon to within shooting distance so that
the backfield will carry the double threat
of dangerous passing and swimming
attacks.
Stanford's water polo team this year
will be one of possible great power, ac
cording to all present indications. Al
though the Cardinal team which made a
very satisfactory showing in the nationals
last year will he hard to surpass the ma
terial, both new and old, from which
Ernst Brandsten, coach of aquatic sports,
has to draw, is exceptionally strong.
