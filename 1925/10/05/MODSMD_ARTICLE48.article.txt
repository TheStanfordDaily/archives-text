# BONES OF HOG, DEER PROGENITORS FOUND IN EASTERN OREGON
## 
### 
Peculiar hoofed animals, showing a
distant relationship to the deer and the ;
hog of today, roamed the Pacific slope in
ages past, according to scientists who
have unearthed fossils of mammals called 1
orodons in the John Day Basin of east
ern Oregon.
Entombed in the rock deposits of the |
region of the John Day river, remains of
huge boar-like creatures, measuring seven
or eight feet in height and ten feet in
length, have. enabled paleontologists to j
read the life record in the rocks, declared
Chester Stock, professor of paleontology
at the University of California, who
recently discussed the fossils found in
Oregon at a meeting of Sigma XI, 11a- '
tional scientific honor society.
Fossils have been taken from Oregon 1
rock deposits since the first discoveries j
by army officers in 1861, which are now
part of the Marsh collections at Yale.
I11 1899 the University of California sent
out its first expedition under Dr. John
Merriam, formerly head of the paleon
tology department at Berkeley, now of j
the Carnegie Institute in Washington, j
D. C. Much of the ancient life of eastern j
Oregon would be a closed book without j
the John Day river, explained Professor 1
Stock, who said that the river bed strata !
had preserved more than 100 different
species of long extinct mammals.
Flesh-eating dogs of more than a
dozen varieties, as well as numerous
kinds of sabre-toothed cats, ancestors of
the modern opossum, have been found
among the different species of fossils of
j this region. The oredons had grinding
! teeth like the deer and large tusks like
I wild hogs for defense. They ranged in
i size from a dog to a small cow, and
were of .gregarious nature, scientists be
1 lieve, as they were accustomed to live in
I bands, feeding along streams and lakes.
"The collecting of fossils, while the
discoveries in themselves are interesting,"
| said Professor Stock, "possesses a tre
1 mendous fascination when viewed from
its significance to our lyiderstanding of
; life now entirely extinct. One needs
1 optimism and the keen sight of the pros
1 pector along with the enthusiasm to dis
cover something which is new and of
value to science in order to do field work
in paleontology."
