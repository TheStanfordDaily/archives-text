# FRESHMEN TROUNCE SAN MATEO JUNIOR COLLEGE, 25 TO 0
## Hunt's Men Loose Brilliant Attack; Reserves Beat Potter High 13-0 
### Frank Baker 
Showing mid-season form and a de
cided improvement from the previous
week, the Cardinal freshman football
eleven easily trounced San Mateo Junior
College, 25 to 0, in the preliminary to the
Stanford-Santa Clara game Saturday.
Coach "Husky" Hunt has developed
an overwhelming offense to supplement
the sturdy defense shown last week.
The second frosh team defeated Potter
Tech, 13 to 0, in the morning game. The
Tech team exhibited a strong defense
that was hard for the Babes to solve; but
once the combination was found, the re
sult was never in doubt.
Against San Mateo, the freshmen came
through in great fashion. Although be
fore the game it was freely predicted
that the frosh would be in for a tough
afternoon, their power was demonstrated
at the outset, when Bob Sims broke over
the line for the first touchdown four
minutes after the kick-off. From then
on the Junior College never had a chance,
for the freshmen raged up and down the
field at will. Numerous substitutions
seemed to have no effect toward weaken
ing the power of the team.
Although using but a scant half-dozen
plays, the freshman backlield demon
strated great potentialities. With the
possible exception of running interfer
ence, the backs showed good co-ordina
tion. The work of Wilton and Sims was
speedy and shows promise, as does also
that of Lewis, Smalling, Harder. Ver
milya, and Artman; the last three being
on the line. Wilton and Marks showed
ability to kick and will hold up that end
of the game in any competition.
Score Each Quarter
One touchdown was made in each
quarter against San Mateo. The first
was carried over by Bob Sims in the first
four minutes of play. In the second
quarter Jones, playing guard, intercepted
a pass and made a sprint for the second
touchdown. WUton had been replaced at
right half by Marks, who kicked goal,
thus making the score 13 to 0 at the end
of the half. About the middle of the
third period, Sims got away for a sen- j
sational 35-yard run and placed the ball
within scoring distance; then Wilton, in
two short bucks, made the touchdown.
Lewis failed to kick the goal. Near the j
close of the game another San Mateo
pass was intercepted by Fleishhacker,
substitute guard, who made the final
touchdown.

contested battle. The game was played

the kicking being about equal, and the'
scrimmage slightly in favor of the
frosh. At the end of the first quarter
j Potter attempted a field goal, but it
j was blocked, and from then on the

The two touchdowns were made just
j before the ends of the third and fourth
: quarters. In both cases, Harris, at right

; within scoring distance, then Cohn, at
j full, scored. Cohn failed to kick the

eleven easily trounced San Mateo Junior

Coach "Husky" Hunt has developed

The second frosh team defeated Potter
Tech, 13 to 0, in the morning game. The
Tech team exhibited a strong defense
that was hard for the Babes to solve; but
once the combination was found, the re
sult was never in doubt.
Against San Mateo, the freshmen came
through in great fashion. Although be
fore the game it was freely predicted
that the frosh would be in for a tough
afternoon, their power was demonstrated
at the outset, when Bob Sims broke over
the line for the first touchdown four
minutes after the kick-off. From then
on the Junior College never had a chance,
for the freshmen raged up and down the
field at will. Numerous substitutions
seemed to have no effect toward weaken
ing the power of the team.
Although using but a scant half-dozen
plays, the freshman backlield demon
strated great potentialities. With the
possible exception of running interfer
ence, the backs showed good co-ordina
tion. The work of Wilton and Sims was
speedy and shows promise, as does also
that of Lewis, Smalling, Harder. Ver
milya, and Artman; the last three being
on the line. Wilton and Marks showed
ability to kick and will hold up that end
of the game in any competition.
Score Each Quarter
One touchdown was made in each
quarter against San Mateo. The first
was carried over by Bob Sims in the first
four minutes of play. In the second
quarter Jones, playing guard, intercepted
a pass and made a sprint for the second
touchdown. WUton had been replaced at
right half by Marks, who kicked goal,
thus making the score 13 to 0 at the end
of the half. About the middle of the
third period, Sims got away for a sen- j
sational 35-yard run and placed the ball
within scoring distance; then Wilton, in
two short bucks, made the touchdown.
Lewis failed to kick the goal. Near the j
close of the game another San Mateo
pass was intercepted by Fleishhacker,
substitute guard, who made the final
touchdown.
