## John T. Lemos Says America Needs Better Trainng In Craftsmanship 
### Astrid Arnoldson 
"The average shool child of F.uropc
takes art work much more seriously than j
the American," said John T. Lemos, in |
speaking of the exhibition of German (
children's art work, which opened Satur-,
day at the Art Gallery.
The collection which was sent to Dr. i
August C. Mahr of the German depart-,
ment by the Smithsonian Institute at J
"Washington, which acts as agent for the |
German government, includes almost j
every kind of painting, drawing, print
ing, engraving, and weaving. All the l
paintings are the work of children be
tween the ages of eleven and eighteen, j
Among the pictures arc two made by j
colored strips of paper pasted on a large j
sheet. One of these shows a harbor with
sailing yachts, which at a little distance j
looks like a smooth painting or print.
The other, which is rougher, is a picture
of a group of children at play in front
of a building, presumably a schoolhouse.
Of these Lemos said, "They contain the J
basic principle of all futuristic art, es- J
pecially in the so-called vibration pic-1
tures." The pictures, however, are en- j
tirely recognizable, and seem more like I
mosaic work than futuristic studies in j
three dimensions. j
Silhouettes Shown
Allied to these pictures are some j
silhouettes, made by cutting out the fig
ures and pasting them on sheets of paper j
of a contrasting color. Some of these |
are in black on white, and one is in wihtc j
I
on black. Frank Lemos said they were |
made without models, and commented j
favorably on the life-like figures and j
convincing action. Then he pointed out j
some posters of fairy-tale subjects, also j
purely imaginary work. Most of these j
were in colors. . J
German schools are suffering from I
lack of finances, according to John j
Lemos, and the art departments are the j
lirst to feel it because many people con- |
sider them unnecessary. The present j
collection is designed to arouse interest |
in art. It will go to South America from j
the United States.
America Lacks Art
America, says John Lemos, has no dis- j
tinctive art. Her best art work has so j
far been done mostly by Europeans or |
Americans trained in Europe. With this |
in mind, leading educators are trying to ,
stimulate interest in establishing a na
tional school of industrial art. In this
school the European plan would be fol- j
lowed. That is, each student should j
have a chance to do the work he most I
needs, whether the class has to be main- !
tained for him alone or for a hundred.
German professors have said, when j
they were asked why they maintained a :
class of only two, that they did not want j
to risk losing a Steinmetz or a Durer by
refusing to hold a class because too few
enrolled. The new American school
would provide such instruction at cost.
The Ladies' 5-lotne Journal, Lemos
said, will soon publish a scries of twenty
six articles on the need for a typically
American art. The Metropolitan Mu-!
seum in New York endeavors to do the [
same thing in its American wing, where j
only the work of Americans is shown, j
Educators are trying to enlist the help i
of wealthy men in the East.
The German collection will remain at j
the Art Gallery until November 1.
