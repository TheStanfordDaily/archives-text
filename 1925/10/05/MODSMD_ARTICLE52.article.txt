"Religion has a primary place in the
thought and action of the educated
man or woman," stated President Wil
bur in the Sunday Matriculation ad
dress.
President Wilbur then went on to
say that science, rather than opposing
religion, really emphasizes it, as it is
through science that we come to a full
appreciation of the facts associated
■with the universe. "Science, to religion,
is simply one mode of revealing the
divine will. Religion, science, and the
moral order must inevitably go along
together if man is to be successful and
happy."
