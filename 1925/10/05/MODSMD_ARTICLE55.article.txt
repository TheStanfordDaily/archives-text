# NEW WOMEN URGED TO JOIN DEBATERS
## 
### 
The hour of the women's debate
meeting which is to be held tonight in
the Women's Clubhouse has been
changed from 7 to 7:45 o'clock.
The Women's Debating Society,
which was organized last year, espe
cially urges freshman women and
transfers to attend the meeting. This
meeting has been called to discuss
plans for the triangular debate
between Mills, California, and Stan
ford. A choice will be made of two
subjects declared eligible by the Cali
fornia and Mills representatives, and
steps will be taken toward the selec
tion of the debating teams.
Oliver E. Norton will take the place
of Henry A. Shinn as debating coach
for two quarters.
