# New York, Boston, Frisco Audiences Entertained By Four Anderson Plays
## 
### 
Maxwell Anderson, formerly con
nected with the English department at
Stanford, now has four plays running,
of which he is author. "What Price
Glory," the war drama which caused a
sensation in New York, was closed
down for a time, but is now running
again both in New York and San Fran
cisco.
"Outside Looking In" and "The First
Flight" are also playing in New York,
and "The Buccaneer" is in Boston.
Lawrence Stallings is the co-author of
"What Price Glory" with Anderson.
Anderson received his M.A. degree
in English at Stanford in 1914. He was
also an assistant in the English depart
ment and a member of Dr. Gray's class
in dramatic composition.
A volume of his verse is to be pub
lished this winter by Macmillan and
Company.
