### 
(Editor's Noteâ€”All voters should
read the editorial appearing on page
two captioned "Cornering Campus
Honors" before forming an opinion
regarding the yell leader election.)

A special Quad election will be held
tomorrow to choose between Evert H.
Young and Burton L. Lapp, candidates
for head yell leader.
Raitt Boren, who was elected head
yell leader last year, is not registered
in the University this quarter, and
consequently another election is neces
sary.
At the Stanford-Santa Clara football
game Saturday Young and Lapp acted
alternately as head yell leaders. They
were assisted by Robert M. Fraser and
James Farr, the junior cheer leaders.
Young was junior cheer leader with
Raitt Boren until last spring quarter,
but was forced to resign when he left
with his orchestra for a world tour.
Lapp was head yell leader two years
ago.
Voters will not be allowed i/j write
in names on the ballots. Lapp and
Young are the only ones eligible for
yell leader. Student body cards must
be brought to the polls as the d'rec tory
for this quarter has not yet been
printed.
