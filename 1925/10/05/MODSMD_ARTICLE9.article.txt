## 
### 
All campus golfers arc invited to at
tend the Stanford Golf club's first meet
ing of the quarter at 7:15 o'clock tomor
row night in the trophy room of the Old
Union. The question of securing play
ing privileges for Stanford men at
near-by country clubs will be discussed,
and Tom Condit, varsity golf manager,
will talk on the present situation.
During the past several years campus
players have had privileges at Burlin
game, but Condit is negotiating with offi
cials of the Los Altos Country Club to
secure the use of that course for stu
dents. Los Altos may be reached by /uito
from the campus in about fifteen minutes,
and electric cars stop a short distance
from the clubhouse. No monthly green
fees are to be paid by students at Bur
lingame or at Los Altos, if that course is
secured. The Stanford Golf club will
collect the fees from its members and
will turn the money over to the club, so
only members of the campus organization
will be able to avail themselves of any
special rates which may be offered. All
men who desire playing privileges are
urged by Condit to attend tomorrow
night's meeting.
Any Stanford golfer is eligible for
membership, regardless of his ability. All
members of the varsity squad belong to
this club, which was established last year
to work for the welfare of the links
game on the campus. The club pro
moted a successful intramural tourna
ment last spring, and plans many com
petitions during the coming year.
The following officers were elected at
the close of the spring quarter to hold
office during the coming year: Eli Dur
sey, president, Eddie Meyberg, secretary,
Robert Clendening, treasurer. Since Dor
sey is not in school this quarter, it will
be necessary to elect a president tomor
row night.
