# $1500 DAMAGE DONE BY SOPHOMORES IN ENCINA HALL RAID
## WINDOWS, DOORS BROKEN Authorities Declare That Second Year Men Will Be Held Liable 
### 
Nearly $1500 damage was done by
the sophomore raiding party last night
when it swooped down on the fresh
men in Encina at about midnight, ac
'cording to the earliest estimates.
University authorities announced
this morning that the sophomore class
would be held responsible for all dam
age resulting from the depredations.
Comptroller Roth declared, "Raiding
of Encina will be absolutely prohibited
in the future. This is one tradition that
â– will have to stop right now."
At 11:30 the class of '28 gathered
in front of Sequoia, armed with pad
dles, and from there proceeded to the
first year hall. At Encina all stray
freshmen were given impromptu soak
ings and were paddled on the front
lawn. When the supply of stragglers
gave out the sophomores mobbed the
hall, breaking in doors and overturn
ing all furniture in sight.
In an hour things quieted down, but
only the threat that the mud light
would be called off prevented the
freshmen from raiding Toyon and
Branner, where most thought the
sophomores lived.
