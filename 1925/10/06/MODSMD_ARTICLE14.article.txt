# DR. GRAY DENIES BACON AUTHOR OF SHAKESPEARE
## Nagel's Cryptogram Theory Called "Silly" By English Department Head 
### 
"The cryptogram theory that Paeon |
wrote the plays of Shakespeare is!
silly," says Dr. H. D. Gray, of the \
English department.
Dr. Gray's statement refutes a now
version of this theory recently ex
pounded by J. J. Nagel of Los Altos !
Nagel believes that he has found a new \
pillar to uphold the Baconian idea of 1
tho authorship of Shakespeare's
dramas in his development of a key
to a cipher which he has made by use
of certain italicized words in copies of
the first folio of Shakespeare's works.
Nagel is continuing a research be
gun many years ago by the late Igna
tius Donnelly of Minnesota.
"Bacon, of all the men of Shakes
peare's time, is the one who is least
likely to have written his plays," said i
! Dr. Gray. "We know that Bacon was |
not an actor, and it is quite impossible
j that anyone not an actor could have j
written them.
"In his well-known works paeon j
shows a completely undramatic mind.
The fact that many of Shakespeare's
contemporaries were of high intelli
gence, and were so intimately asso
ciated with one another, renders it un
, believable that another man could have
posed as Shakespeare, author of plays,
i the most popular dramatist of his

| time. He could not fail to have been
! detected in such a fraud.

"Although it is beyond question that i
cryptograms were used in Bacon's
time and by Bacon himself, it has been!
shown by various writers who have
i given serious attention to the subject, !
i that a cryptogram to which one in- J
1 vents the key can be made to prove;
almost anything.
"By the cryptogram theory it can
be easily proved that Bacon wrote not!
only all of Shakespeare's plays, but!
most of the other literature of his age, ■
together with various works of our i
own time," continued Dr. Gray. "With
very little difficulty all of Browning
may be attributed to the pen of Bacon.
With just such a formula as the
Baconians use, I have seen a crypto
i gram prove that Kipling wrote Shakes
peare.
"I have not examined the pages
of the folio on which the italicized !
words referred to by Mr. Nagel appear,
but italicized words of the same sort,
apparently without reason to the un-j
initiated, appear on other pages.
"Bacon must have had a job as com
positor with Heming and Condell. edi
tors of the first folio in order to have
arranged all the italicized words cor-;
