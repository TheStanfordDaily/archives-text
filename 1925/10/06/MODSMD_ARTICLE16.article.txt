# SACRED CONCERT STARTS STANFORD MUSICAL SEASON
## 
### Herbert Klein 
Corning as the first regular event in
what promises to be a big musical sea
j son for Stanford is the Sacred Concert
which will take place in the Memorial
I Church at 7: SO o'clock tonight, barren
| D. Allen will be at the console of the
organ and assisting him will be Kath
ryn Jul6, harpist, and Roberta Arnold,
lyric soprano.
Mrs. Arnold has appeared in recitals
at Carmel-by-the-Sea, her home, and
has received very favorable criticism
for her singing. Miss July 6 has won
scholarships for both composition and
harp at the Juillard Foundation and
also received the Alov harp scholar
ship. She will play her "Prelude for
Harp."
Several pieces of a religious nature
will keep the program in harmony with
the church and the central idea of a
sacred concert. The rest are chosen
from the best in the classics of music.
"Pastorale" from the First Sonata" by
Ward Stephens and two movements,
"Adagio" and "Finale" from the "First
Organ Sonata, in F minor" by Felix
Mendelssohn, should be very effective.
"Kol Nidrei," an ancient Hebrew mel
ody of dirge-like strain, was played
here last year as a solo for cello and
orchestra when Alfred Hertz came
with the San Francisco Symphony
Orchestra. Tonight it will be heard in
an organ adaptation from the cello and
orchestra version.
Two oratorio selections are also
scheduled. The "Sinfonia" from "Saul"
by G. F. Handel will be an organ solo.
The aria, "With Verdure Clad the
Hills Appear," is from "The Creation"
by Joseph Haydn, and will be sung by
Mrs. Arnold.
