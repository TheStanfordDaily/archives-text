# B. L. LAPP ELECTED HEAD YELL LEADER TO REPLACE BOREN
## ONLY 460 VOTES CAST Majority Is Overwhelming In Favor of Former Cheer Leader 
### 
Burton L. Lapp was elected head
j cheer leader over Evert H. Young
1 in a special Quad election today by a
vote of 401 to 239. Lapp is a member
of the class of '24 and belongs to El
I Toro. He was head yell leader two
years ago.
Raitt Boren, who was elected head
cheer leader last year, is not registered
in the University this fall, consequent
ly a special election was necessary.
This is the first time the student body
has been forced to face a situation of
this kind. The action of the Executive
Committee in holding an election has
set a precedent as there is no provi
sion in the constitution or by-laws
covering a case of this type.
For the past year Lapp has been
out of school working for a San Fran
cisco firm. He will take charge imme
diately and will be assisted by Robert
M. Fraser and James Farr, junior yell
leaders.
The total number of votes cast was
640, distributed as follows:
Lapp— Young—
Men. 374 Men 209
Women 27 Women 30
