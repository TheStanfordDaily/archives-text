# INTENSIVE PRACTICE SLATED FOR GRAYS
## 
### 
Stanford Grays started intensive
practice yesterday when three teams
under the direction of Coach Hal Davis
ran through their signals.
Until yesterday the reserves had
only played defensively in scrimmages
with the varsity and freshman squads.
Prospects for a strong team this year
are good as many of the veterans of
last year's squad have returned. With
Kenny Graham back 011 the eleven,
the pivot position is well taken care of.
The first game for the Grays has
been scheduled with San Luis Obispo
here on October 17. Iled Clark seems
to be the leading candidate for quar
ter, while Wolf and Morrison will prob
ably fill the halfback positions. So
bieski and Montgomery of last year's
freshman team appear to be excellent
men at tackle and end.
