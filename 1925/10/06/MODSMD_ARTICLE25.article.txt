# Campus Speed Regulations
## 
### 
A. E. Roth, comptroller of the University, has announced that traffic
regulations will be strictly enforced on the campus. To carry out these i
plans he has appointed a full-time motor policeman, who will be aided by j
regular state traffic cops. Under this plan the campus will be patrolled]
night and day.
Students will be arrested on University-owned highways, but they!
will be forced to go to Santa Clara for their trials and subsequent punish
ment. The Daily Palo Alto does not sympathize with the idea of hav- j
ing the funds go to the county, but it heartily agrees with Comptroller'
Roth that something must be done to stop reckless driving on the campus.
We will be pleasantly surprised if the new rules work out satisfactorily]
to all of the parties concerned.
Following is the statement sent to the Daily by Comptroller Roth: j
"For the information of students and others operating automobiles i
on the University campus, attention is Called to the fact that under the
provisions of the California Motor Vehicles act as amended in 1919, the!
grounds of private educational institutions are included within the defini- j
tion of highways subject' to the act. All of the provisions of this act i
therefore apply to the Stanford campus.
"This act provides the following speed limits:
"Twenty miles per hour on the row and the circle in front of the
quadrangle.
"Fifteen miles per hour on the areas adjoining the quadrangles.
"Fifteen miles per hour at dangerous crossings.
"Thirty-five miles per hour on University avenue (except at cross-'
ings) in day time.
"Twenty-five miles per hour on University avenue (except at cross- !
ings) at night.
"Driving with open mufflers, on any part of the University grounds, :
is prohibited.
"Attention is especially called to the fact that fast driving on the row ,
and at the postoffice corner is extremely dangerous. In order to protect
pedestrians and prevent accidents the University has deemed it advisable!
to employ a full-time traffic officer for duty on the campus in addition to
the service rendered by state and county traffic officers, and he has there
tore been employed for this year.
"The provisions of the Motor Vehicle act will be strictly enforced
on the Stanford campus, and students and others who fail to observe the
same will be denied the privileges of driving automobiles thereon without
further warning."

We will be pleasantly surprised if the new rules work out satisfactorily]
to all of the parties concerned.
Following is the statement sent to the Daily by Comptroller Roth: j
"For the information of students and others operating automobiles i
on the University campus, attention is Called to the fact that under the
provisions of the California Motor Vehicles act as amended in 1919, the!
grounds of private educational institutions are included within the defini- j
tion of highways subject' to the act. All of the provisions of this act i
therefore apply to the Stanford campus.
"This act provides the following speed limits:
"Twenty miles per hour on the row and the circle in front of the
quadrangle.
"Fifteen miles per hour on the areas adjoining the quadrangles.
"Fifteen miles per hour at dangerous crossings.
"Thirty-five miles per hour on University avenue (except at cross-'
ings) in day time.
"Twenty-five miles per hour on University avenue (except at cross- !
ings) at night.
"Driving with open mufflers, on any part of the University grounds, :
is prohibited.
"Attention is especially called to the fact that fast driving on the row ,
and at the postoffice corner is extremely dangerous. In order to protect
pedestrians and prevent accidents the University has deemed it advisable!
to employ a full-time traffic officer for duty on the campus in addition to
the service rendered by state and county traffic officers, and he has there
tore been employed for this year.
"The provisions of the Motor Vehicle act will be strictly enforced
on the Stanford campus, and students and others who fail to observe the
same will be denied the privileges of driving automobiles thereon without
further warning."
