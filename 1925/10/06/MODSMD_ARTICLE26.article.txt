# The 						Daily Tryouts
## 
### 
Freshmen and sophomores will be.given an opportunity to tryout for
positions on the Daily Palo Alto staff at the initial tryout meeting j
tomorrow afternoon. This is one of the most profitable activities on the
campus in which to participate, and underclassmen with spare time will
do well to be on hand at this meeting.
No activity gives a better opportunity to make valuable acquaint- i
ances, nor to learn of the inner workings of the University. The reporter j
must meet and interview prominent men who are visiting; he talks daily
with the leaders in campus activities and learns of their plans, and at the I
same time he is doing himself some good by learning the journalism pro-j
fession. Many graduates of college who have been trained on the campus I
papers are able to step into good jobs 011 metropolitan journals.
And in addition to the chance of getting an insight into affairs of the I
University and to meet its leaders, the Daily reporter is in line for pro-j
motion and scholastic credit. The Division of Journalism gives credit to
certain students for their work on the Daily Palo Alto staff. Reporters !
who show the ability and faithfulness are promoted to positions as News !
Editors, and the more deserving news editors become Managing Editors;
and Editors.
Work 011 the Daily PalO Alto staff is an activity worth the con-!
sideration of every underclassman in the University. Alfred B. Post has
charge of the tryouts. lie will explain additional details of the system
to all interested.
Woman, step by step, has impertinently encroached upon the sacred
boundaries of manhood —adopting cigarettes, knickers, haircuts —and even !
barber shops. Poor man has been left sorrowing over his lost shreds of j
self-respect.
Rut at last comes news of a light through the darkness of despair. A man 1
lias been found who is resisting the onslaughts of the shaggy-haired Amazons.
Ted Housh has announced that his "Block S" barber shop will remain a "he
man shop for he-men only. Women will be taboo —barred and prohibited as
unnecessary. The barber will no longer have to fawn and labor upon the
tresses of a miss with a boyish bob while twelve strong men squirm uneasily
in their chairs. No longer need man glance guiltily to right and left before
launching into the latest escapade of the traveling salesman. Hooray!
All is not gold that glitters—nor is every glandhander that knows the grip 1
and countersign a fraternity brother. Witness the pledge in a Stanford !
fraternity house who lent his car to a visiting brother from the "Rhode Island
Epsilon" chapter, and who is still looking for both the car and the brother. !
Gallantry Is the spirit which prompts a man to offer his seat in a street '
car to a woman —a block before he reaches his destination.
