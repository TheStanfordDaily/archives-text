NEW YORK, Oct. 2.—Miss Fay Lan
phier of California, "Miss America" of
the Atlantic City beauty pageant, is
recovering rapidly at her apartment
from a slight attack of pneumonia.—

This ought to teach those bathing
I beauties not to go so near the water.

Why is the freshman-sophomore
tangle like a political campaign? No,
not because they get all plastered with

comes out except a few wire-pullers.

ADVENTURES OF NICK THE
NASTY KNICKERED NECKER.
The President's Reception.
Nick awoke, stretched, looked at his
j watch, which said ten o'clock, and
| reached for his pipe. "I'm goin' to be
| real temperate to start with," he told
; himself, so he only smoked one pipe
| before donning his wicked plus twelve
outfit (makes misses' hearts miss, the
! ad said).
After a cup of coffee and a snail, he
jset about the day's work with his usual
I industriousness. First, as was his
habit, he summed up the previous day's
j achievements—it always gave him a
| comfortable feeling. "I guess I got
j those profs figured out all right after
' just one day," he thought. "It's onlv a
j question of a little bull and bluff, after
■ all"—this with a perspicacious wag
1 of his head. "And I'm in right jvith that
little dame I had last night, too—'s
I keen looker, all right." So we see that
I our young hero had not been com
pletely idle during his first few days
j in the great university.
! "Guess I'll go get acquainted with
Prexy tonight—see he's giving a big
reception for us new fellers," Nick
ruminated. And sure enough, after a
i morning of tinkering with the car and
|an afternoon of bridge and pool, the
; evening found him at the doorstep of
the President's modest domicile. Nick
didn't bother to ring, but walked right
j in. It just happened that the President
| was still at dinner, so Nick decided
! that maybe he'd better wait awhile.
He sat down in the hall and threw
; hats at the rack until put out bv a
servant.
An hour later Nick appeared at the
door again, and this time was admitted
j to the drawing room. He walked for
ward with a confident air, until he saw
; the receiving line, which consisted of
the President, his wife, the Dean of
Men, the Dean of Women, secretaries
lof five organizations, and other men
and women, more or less formidable in
appearance. "Aw, shucks, I don't want
■to shake hands with all that gang.
| Think I'll go to a show instead," he
; decided, with one of his characteristic
j lightning decisions, and left as soon as
he could get out. Thus it was that the
faculty was spared a direct meeting
with Nick, the Nasty Knickered Neck
er, so early in his college career.
