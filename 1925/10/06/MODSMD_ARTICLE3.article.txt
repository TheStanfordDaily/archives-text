# Quad Tryoutees Gather Tonight for Instructions
## 
### 
An important meeting of all Quad
tryoutees will be held this evening at
7:30 o'clock in the Quad office. The
general plan of the new Quad will be
outlined by staff members, and any
people who have not yet signed up to
try out may do so at this time.
This year, for the first time, the
Quad will be an all-Stanford book,
with every class included. Quality and
efficiency will be the basis for tryouts
rather than the actual quantity of work
done.
