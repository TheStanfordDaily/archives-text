# Fraternity House Is Picked "Brother" Muldeen Leaves Automobile Does Likewise
## 
### 
Last Friday night a cultured looking
gentleman with horn-rimmed specta
cles presented himself as Mr. Muldeen
at a certain fraternity house and .said
he was a brother from a chapter in
the East, which he named. He was
taken in. fed, and given a bed for the
night. The next morning he borrowed
k Special Six Studebaker to go to
Palo Alto.
The morning passed and the after
noon waned, and Mr. Muldeen did not
return; sq the brothers began to check
up 011 him. One of them remembered
suddenly that he had named a chapter
in the East which was not in existence.
This seemed a little out of the ordi
nary, and investigation revealed sev
eral interesting facts. He had come up
from the Southern Branch of the Uni
versity of California where he had
called himself Morse and worn a mus
tache; before that he had been at the
U. C. chapter house during jubilee
week. None of his stories hung to
gether that he had told in his travels
up and down the state.
Descriptions of him and the car were
sent to the police.
