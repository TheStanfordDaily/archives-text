# WALKER SHIFTED FROM QUARTER TO END IN PRACTICE
## GOES WELL IN NEW JOB Kirwan Used to Call Signals In First Scrimmage After Santa Clara Game 
### Wilbur Adams 
Ed Walker was shifted from quarter
| back to end, and Nick Kirwan was
| calling signals instead of playing at
his usual halfback position in yester
| day's scrimmages. These two changes
were the only noticeable results com
! ing from the Santa Clara game.
Walker started the contest last Sat
urday at quarter, but Solomon re
placed him early in the second quar
ter. Solomon's playing at quarterback
during the second and third quarters,
and at fullback for a few minutes in
the last period, has given him a regu
lar berth... on the first eleven. Unless
another change is made, Solomon will
start the U. S. C. game on October 17.
Pop Warner cut his squad to 40 men
yesterday afternoon when Kenny Gra
ham was dismissed from the varsity
field. Graham plays center, but he is
too light for the pivot job. The three
varsity centers are McCreery, Van
Hook, and Natcher. Four or five more
men are expected to be cut from the
squad this week.
Yesterday's practice was held in the
rain. This gave the team some good
training in holding onto a slippery bail.
Murray Cuddeback, last season's half
back, was in a suit yesterday afternoon
helping the place-kickers.
The game with the Occidental Tigers
Saturday will give the coaches time
to get a line on the best combination
to use against U. S. C. the week fol
lowing. Occidental should not prove to
be too hard a contest, though Oxy is
rated to be among the best of the
southern teams, but it should give the
varsity the necessary work-out to
smooth out the rough places before
going to Los Angeles.
