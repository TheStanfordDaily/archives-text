# SOPHS TRIUMPH IN THIRD ANNUAL MUD FIGHT WITH FROSH
## REINFORCEMENTS TURN TIDE AS FRESHMEN FIGHT OLDER OPPONENTS EVENLY SPONSORS STOP STRUGGLE WHEN YEARLING PIT IS FILLED BY RIVALS' BODIES 
### 
Iu keeping with the custom of the
"last two years, the sophomore class
emerged victorious from the third an
nual mudfight with the freshmen, held
yesterday afternoon on the dry lake
bottom of Lagunita. Although outnum
bered by the incoming class, the
veterans of last year were able to sub
merge more victims in the fighting
mixture than their youthful opponents.
After lining up for the fight 011 op
posite sides of the arena, the two
classes rushed each other as Charles
W. Dickenson, chairman of the fight
committee, fired the starting gun. Ac
cording to the rules, captured victims
to be carried and deposited in
the mud-pit at the opposite end of the
field. Remembering the example of
their last year's opponents, the sophs,
greased to the waist, were not both
ered by any scruples as to which pit
was the designated one.
During the first few minutes of the
battle the freshmen, goaded on by the
raid of the previous night, and by the
soph posters appearing yesterday
morning, were able to hold their op
ponents even. The appearance of a
reserve array of 100 sophomores at
tacking from the flank turned the tide.
The bodies of the victims of both
•classes clogging the pits and prevent
ing submersion according to rules, the
sponsors fired the gun, although the
battle had only progressed for ten
minutes. After several minutes of vain
attempts to form a snake dance, the
members of each class turned home
wards to begin the task of cleansing
and soothing their bodies.
An unusual number of spectators
were present at the fight, which will
close the class rivalry for th,e year
under the system of senior control
instituted in 1923.
No injuries other than scratches
from the burrs on the field or bruises
trom struggling captives marred the
fight. '
Evidently not firmly convinced of
their defeat, the frosh early this morn
ing plastered the campus and quad
-with posters bearing the words: "Frosh
Win! Sophs Lose! '29 Cleans '28 in
Mud Fight." As soon as it learned,
a half hour later, of this gesture of
independence on the part of the year
lings, a small band of sophomores re
moved the offensive handbills before
they could be read by students going
to S o'clock classes.

were present at the fight, which will
close the class rivalry for th,e year

instituted in 1923.
No injuries other than scratches
from the burrs on the field or bruises
trom struggling captives marred the
fight. '
Evidently not firmly convinced of
their defeat, the frosh early this morn
ing plastered the campus and quad
-with posters bearing the words: "Frosh
Win! Sophs Lose! '29 Cleans '28 in
Mud Fight." As soon as it learned,
a half hour later, of this gesture of
independence on the part of the year
lings, a small band of sophomores re
moved the offensive handbills before
they could be read by students going
to S o'clock classes.
Iu keeping with the custom of the
"last two years, the sophomore class
emerged victorious from the third an
nual mudfight with the freshmen, held
yesterday afternoon on the dry lake
bottom of Lagunita. Although outnum
bered by the incoming class, the
veterans of last year were able to sub
merge more victims in the fighting
mixture than their youthful opponents.
After lining up for the fight 011 op
posite sides of the arena, the two
classes rushed each other as Charles
W. Dickenson, chairman of the fight
committee, fired the starting gun. Ac
cording to the rules, captured victims
to be carried and deposited in
the mud-pit at the opposite end of the
field. Remembering the example of
their last year's opponents, the sophs,
greased to the waist, were not both
ered by any scruples as to which pit
was the designated one.
During the first few minutes of the
battle the freshmen, goaded on by the
raid of the previous night, and by the
soph posters appearing yesterday
morning, were able to hold their op
ponents even. The appearance of a
reserve array of 100 sophomores at
tacking from the flank turned the tide.
The bodies of the victims of both
•classes clogging the pits and prevent
ing submersion according to rules, the
sponsors fired the gun, although the
battle had only progressed for ten
minutes. After several minutes of vain
attempts to form a snake dance, the
members of each class turned home
wards to begin the task of cleansing
and soothing their bodies.
