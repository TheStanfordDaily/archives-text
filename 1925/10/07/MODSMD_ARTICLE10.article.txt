# "THUNDERING HERD" DOPED TO WIN OVER WARNER'S VARSITY
## SOUTHERN BOOSTERS COMPARE TROJAN BACKFIELD TO "FOUR HORSEMEN" CARD ELEVEN IMPROVING FAST; PRICE SHIFTED FROM END TO CENTER 
### Wilbur F. Adams 
Stanford football fans have seen a
"wonder team," and "four horsemen"
In the last few years, but on October
17 they will receive the greatest treat
of all. They will have the opportunity
of viewing the "thundering herd" in
action in the Los Angeles Coliseum.
The U. S. C. varsity has been given
this high-sounding name by some of
the proverbial Southern boosters, after
the herd had run up 187 points without
allowing its opponents to cross its goal
line, in the first three contests this
season.
Match 187 points against 20 tallies
and the difference between Warner's
varsity and Jones's aggregation will
be obtained, according to the Los An
geles critics. U. S. C.is not that much
better than the Cards, but it is doped
to have the edge on the game next
week. The fact that the contest is
being played on the Trojan's own field
is considered an advantage to the
Southerners, too.
But the Stanford football machine is
just beginning to function. Warner is
running a new eleven this year, and
like an auto, he doesn't dare drive it
too fast for the first few weeks. Stan
ford has been gradually improving in
the last two weeks, and in ten more
days it should be going at its best.
Stanford is warned to look out for
Kaer, Cook, Elliott, and Lee. U. S. C.
should be warned to beware of Nevers,
Murphy, Hyland, Bogue, and Hill.
There is no doubt that on October 17
the two best backfields on the Pacific
Coast will clash. The U. S. C. combi
nation is compared to the Notre Dame
backfield, because of its work in the
early-season games, but such schools
as Whittier, California Tech. and Po
mona can hardly be expected to give
clever backs much trouble. After Stan
ford has visited the Southland there
will be plenty of time to decide wheth
er U. S. C. has stolen Notre Dame's
backfield.
Both Stanford and U. S. C. play com
paratively easy games next Saturday.
The University of Utah will meet the
Trojans, while Occidental travels to
Stanford to battle the Cards.
The latest change in the Stanford
squad is the shifting of Fred Price
from end to center. Price has always
played center before this year when
he was shifted to the wing of the line
because of his lack of weight, and
also because of the need for a right
end. Yesterday Dinty Moore was in
the end job, with Art Greisser chang
ing off with him. Ed Walker and Tex
Middleton were playing the wings on
the second team.
