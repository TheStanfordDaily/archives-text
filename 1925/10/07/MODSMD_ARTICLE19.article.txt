# STONE'S WILL TAKE QUAD PHOTOGRAPHS
## 
### 
Senior pictures for the Quad this
year will be taken at Stone's, on the
Circle. This plan is being used, accord
in gto Manager Lowell Matthay, be
cause Stone's has special lighting ar
rangements which can not be moved,
and with which much better pictures
can be obtained than otherwise. Last,
year the Quad had a temporary studio
in the basketball pavilion.
Sittings will begin Monday. Matthay
has a new plan for making appoint
ments, which he says will save much
work for the Quad. Seniors will be
i notified beforehand on what day their
picture is to he taken. They are ex
pected to make their appointment with
the photographer themselves, for some
hour that day. That appointment will
be final
As many sittings will be taken as
are necessary to obtain a good picture.
