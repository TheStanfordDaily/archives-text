Two members of the Stanford faculty,
Professor G. F. Ferris of the Ento
mology department and Professor E.

ment, have received the John Simon
Guggenheim Memorial Fellowship.
About forty are granted in the United
States.
The fellowship, which was estab
lished last year by Simon Guggenheim,
former senator from Colorado, provides
for advanced study abroad under the
freest possible conditions, and while no
age limits arc made, ordinarily the ap
pointees are not younger than 25 or
older than 35.
Professor Ferris is on a year's leave
of absence from the University and
plans to collect specimens of insccts in
Central South America and Mcxico.
Professor Schultz will leave the first of
the year for Egypt, where he will work
with Dr. d'Herclle, director of the In
ternational Quarantine.
