# Starting the Rooters
## 
### 
Last night the Rally committee decided to inaugurate immediate plans
for the reorganization of the Stanford rooting section. Preparations for
a pavilion rally tomorrow night to be followed by the annual Encina
pajamarino were made.
Saturday's game does not promise to be a close one, and many may feel
that a rally at this early date is unnecessary. However, the Cards meet
U. S. C the week following Occidental and it is toward the Trojan game
that the rooters must be pointing, rather than toward Occidental. The
Southern California game is going to tax the ability and endurance of the
football players to the limit, and the rooters must be prepared to do their
share by having a smooth working cheer section.
From all indications enough students will be making the southern trip
to form an organized rooting section. For the past few years the residents
of Los Angeles county have been owr severest critics, and it is very essen
tial that Stanford show them an unexcelled rooting section as well as an
unbeatable football team on October 17 in the Los Angeles coliseum.
There is probably nothing more condemning to college spirit than an unsure
group of rooters.
Inducements in the form of entertainment by campus talent are being
made to insure a large turnout at the rally. This is all well and good as
far as entertainment goes, but all wrong when taken from the inducement
angle. Every Stanford man and woman should want to attend the rally
and the Rally committee will have a right to feel disappointed if 2,500
students are not on hand. And once there students should get into the
spirit of the thing and cooperate with the yell leaders in the rehearsal of
songs and yells. A rooting section is the power behind the guns and Stan
ford will need an exceptional one to carry the team through a schedule in
cluding five hard conference games.
