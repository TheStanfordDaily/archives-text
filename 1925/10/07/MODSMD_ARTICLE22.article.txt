# A 						Stanford Literary Magazine
## 
### 
Plans are being formulated by an interested group of students for
the formation of a Stanford Literary Magazine. It is felt by the sponsors
of the idea that there is a crying need for such a publication on the
campus, and an effort will be made to satisfy this need in the new
magazine. ,
At present the plan is briefly this: the magazine will be patterned
closely after the American Mcrcury in page size, material, and make-up.
It will include exceptional poems and stories written by Stanford talent,
and in addition will carry a theater and library section written by the best
of the campus critics. The board of editors will conduct an open forum
discussion section and will also discuss important campus questions edi
torially. If present plans materialize the first issue will appear on Decem
ber 1, and there will be two numbers a quarter thereafter.
The project is being launched by some of the editors and managers
of campus publications, with whom are associated a number of experi
enced journalists. As important steps are made in the progress of this
venture announcements will be made through the Daily Palo Alto.
In the meantime-it is hoped that Stanford people in sympathy with the
idea will communicate with the Literary Magazine editors, care The
Daily Palo Alto. Communications regarding this matter will be printed
in the "Campus Opinion" department of the Daily.
