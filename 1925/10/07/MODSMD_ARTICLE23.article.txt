# Childish Freshmen

"Paddles for sale. 10 for 45c. Letts Box Co." says an advertisement
in the Oklahonui Daily. What a pity it is that there are rules against the
sale of such a commodity at Stanford! But if freshmen are going to re
peat their unexcusable prank of laying down posters within the arcades of
the Quad, a movement will have to be started for the return of the old
fashioned methods of discipline.
A definite code of procedure has been laid down for freshman-sopho
more tussles. Traditionally and technically everything is over at the com
pletion of the Mud fight. First year men should realize this and should
get over their childish pranks, like the action last night. When the game
is over it is time to quit. %
Sophomore control has given way to senior control and the freshmen
do not need to fear actual bodily chastisement in the nature of paddling
and tubbing. Since they are allowed to be their own judges they should
play the game fair and abide by its rules. Laying down posters after the
gun has ended the play is bad, but laying them on the Inner Quad is sac
rilege. The arcades of the Quad are held sacred by Stanford men and
must never become the scenes of rah-rah stunts.

Fate plays queer pranks on these helpless chequers we call humans. A
woman recently died in England who had kept candles burning for seventy
years in memory of her husband, who died five years after the marriage.
During this constant mourning she made weekly visits to her husband's grave.
Persons like this, who have nothing to live for, seem to last a long time,
while those of us who are intensely happy and intoxicated with the joys of
life are frequently taken away almost before our day of pleasure begins.

Twenty-five per cent of the men students at the University of Nevada are
said to participate in football. This explains why the Wolfpack frequently
develops a dangerous aggregation, and one that can hold California to a 0 to 0
tie as was the case last year. It must be true that success is dependent upon
interest.

The only place a speed demon can drive in front of a train and get away
with it is In the movies.
