NOTES ON THE MUD FIGHT
From the results of yesterday's nnul
fight, we should judge that afterward aj
gasoline fight, followed by a water fight i
and supplemented by a towel fight
would be in order.
Speaking of fighfs, what about these,
fraternity and sorority rushes?
Should registration day be opened
and closed by a gun shot?
We see that the class of 1928 is to be
assessed only $1,500 for damage done
to Encina Hall. It serves the Univer
sity right for using such poor glass in
their windows.
Now that this campus has become so
lawless that the sophomores use crude |
oil for mud, why not substitute kilts for j
golf knickers.
HOW TO SELECT THE WIN-!
NER OF A MUD FIGHT:
1. Count the number of blue-eyed j
sophomores and the number of brown
eyed freshmen as they march into the
field.
2. Count the number of red-haired
freshmen and the number of cross-eyed:
sophomores that are thrown into the
mud.
3. Divide the number of cross-eyed
sophomores into the number of blue
eyed freshmen and subtract this from 1
the square root of the product of the
brown-eyed sophomores times the red- j
haired freshmen.
4. Find out how long it takes to walk j
from Palo Alto to the freshman mud pit. I
5. Flip a coin, and if it comes heads
multiply the date on it by the time!
taken in (4). Add the results of (3) j
and (5).
Final result: If the number comes out
zero exactly the freshmen win
