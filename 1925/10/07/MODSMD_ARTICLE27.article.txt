# CHAPPIE SEEKS COPY FOR NOVEMBER ISSUE
## 
### 
Realizing the difficulty that strug
gling young writers and artists may en
counter in bringing their works before
the public, Chappie has opened his
great big warm heart to the future Ca
bells, Lardners, and Parrishcs. An
nouncement is made by the Ancient
One that his columns will be thrown
open to all writers and artists among
the student body, whether or not they
have already established a name and
reputation for themselves.
"Humorous material submitted to
Chaparral will be judged for itself
alone, and not by the name of the man
or woman who contributes," the Old
Boy stated today. "A freshman has as
good a chance as Will Rogers of get
ting his stuff accepted by us. In fact,
we expert more of the material used
this year to come from freshmen than
from Rogers, Leacock, Cobb, or any
other of the professionals."
Material for the November issue of
Chaparral is acceptable at once. The
deadline for art material has been set
for October 11, and for literary contri
butions, October 13. Short jokes and
verses of a light or humorous turn are
especially desired.
Since the football number of Chappie
must be out on November 21, the day
of the Big Game, work of preparation
will begin earlier than usual. "Hunches"
for drawings reflecting the funny side
of the game are desired, and should be
sent in as soon as possible. All con
tributions should be mailed to Box 15,
Campus.
Hammer and Coffin members will
dine, or at least cat, Thursday night at
the Sigma Nu house. At this time the
society will make provision to fill the
position of editor of Chaparral, left va
cant when Art Bragg, '24, failed to re
turn to the campus this fall.
