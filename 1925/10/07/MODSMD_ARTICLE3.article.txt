# Hotelling Will Give New Statistics Course
## 
### 
Dr. Harold Hotelling of the Food
Research Institute will give a new
course in the mathematical theory of
probability and statistics this quarter.
Recent discoveries by Karl Pearson,
R. A. Fisher, and others will be taken
up. The central problem to be con
sidered is that of measuring the proba
bility of statistical inferences. Statisti
cal methods will be taken up with a
view to investigating the degree of
probability attaching to inferences.
(•lass meetings will be held on Mon
days, Wednesdays, and Fridays at 10
o'clock, in Room 76 in the Mathematics
building. Both differential and integral
calculus are necessary prerequisites.
