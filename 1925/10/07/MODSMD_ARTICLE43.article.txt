# MATERIAL FOR WING POSITIONS ON FROSH SQUAD IS PROMISING
## 
### Frank Baker 
In the freshman grid squad there is,
as usual, an abundance of end ma
terial. Since last Saturday's games
there have been about eight ends of
somewhat promising caliber.
Harder, so far, has appeared to the
best advantage. He is a good offense
man and an even better defense
player. The chances are he will have
a permanent berth on the first team,
but he will need to keep going at the
same pace he showed in the game with
San Mateo to do it, because there are
other men ready to step right in. Wor
den and Way both showed up well in
the San Mateo game. Way was par
ticularly good in getting down under
punts, but needs to tight a little harder.
Worden can improve most on defense.
Rherig and Preston, who played in
the morning game with Potter, made
a lot of good plays, but they also
showed a great deal of greenness at
times. However, both seemed to come
through in the pinches and may work
into good ends. There are three other
men who have not had much of a
chance to show their wares as yet, but
look good; Milton, Snido, and Johnson.
Snido has just come out this week, and
has shown up well for the short time
he has been out. Johnson is a light
man, but is scrappy.
There seems to be an unwillingness
on the part of almost all of the ends
to use their hands. They do not seem
to realize the worry that an end can
cause if he is always shoving his
opponent's head around, and taking up
his time worrying about that instead
of letting him get the jump on them.
Husky Hunt has been looking his
ends over to see if he can find one to
play halfback, but so far has met with
no success. He dops not have any
abundance in this position and would
be very short if any of them were laid
up. Harris, who starred in the morning
game with Potter, is appearing well,
and also Marks, who substituted for
Wilton in the afternoon game. Marks,
however, does not seem to have the
right attitude; he doesn't seem to be
interested in the rest of the team.
This is something that usually works
out, however, after things are going
more smoothly, and the season is still
young.
