## 
### 
Two Stanford graduates were in the
original cast of "Hell-Bent fer Heaven"
when it opened for a long run in New
York two years ago.
Earl House, 'IT), took the part of Sid
Hunt, the role to be played by Wayne
Newcomb in the performance to be
given here Friday evening. Margaret
Burrough, '15, was the leading woman,
Meg Hunt. Miss Burrough is now play
ing the leading role in a new produc
tion directed by James Gleason, called
"The Sheeperherder," which just
opened in New York.
Both Miss Burrough and House were
active in dramatics during their Stan
ford days, and were in the perform
ance of "Sherwood" produced here in
1915.
