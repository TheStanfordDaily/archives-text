I Christians, One and All," by John
j Sebastian Bach, great master of the
j organ.
An organ arrangement of the "Pre
i lude" to Wagner's famous opera "Lo
i hengrin" will open the recital. Wag
j ner's preludes are designed to put the
; hearer in the mood of the opera that

popular concert numbers in them
