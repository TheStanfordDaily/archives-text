# Musicians Please In Sacred Concert At Memorial Church
## 
### Herbert A. Klein 
Featuring two musicians new to the
campus, a Sacred Concert was given
in the Memorial Church last night
under the auspices of the Committee
on Public Exercises. Roberta Leitch
and Kathryn July 6 both proved to be
finished and capable artists without a
trace of carelessnes sor effort in their
renditions.
Mrs. Leitch's singing was distin
guished by an ease and lack of effort
that made it most restful to listen.
She was perfectly natural and without
striving for artificial effects in her
rendering of the Aria "With Verdure
Clad the Hills Appear" from the ora
torio "The Creation."
In her "Prelude for Harp" Kathryn
July 6 showed her ability as a com
poser. The piece was spirited and had
individuality, besides showing an un
derstanding of the peculiar demands
and capabilities of the harp as an in
strument. Her other solo number, a
pair of dances by J. S. Bach, gave an
opportunity for a display of technique.
It sounded as though a more solid and
sustained tone than the harp could
give was required to bring out their
full value. Miss July 6 put into her in
terpretation something of the mingled
spirit of formality and power that

| seems to pervade all Bach's dances.
In "Ivaddisch," a Hebrew hymn for
| the dead by Maurice Ravel, organ,
harp, and voice were heard together.
The words, sung by Mrs. Leitch. were
in Hebrew. The melody and harmoniza
tion was unconventional as in all of
works, and against the back
ground of organ music the harp kept
up an accompaniment of icy, glittering
I chords that added to the strangeness
of the effect.
For emotional effect and stirring
rendition "Kol Nedrei," played as an
iorgan solo, stood in a class by \tself.
It was almost gripping at times. The
j organ seemed well adapted to give it
|an effective rendition due to the vol
ume and tone contrast possible.
"Pastorale" from Guilmant's First
Sonata was a sort of glorification and
expansion of the customary pastorale
jtype. The "Adagio" and "Finale" move
ments from Mendelssohn's First Organ
; Sonata vliich, played as an organ solo,
j closed the program, providing a con
trasting effect when the spirited and
j rushing "Finale" followed the slow and
introspective "Adagio."
A large audience heard the concert
which is the first of the Tuesday eve
ning series of events. Others will be
announced later.
