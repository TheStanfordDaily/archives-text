## 
### 
Thomas A. Condit, varsity golf man
ager, was elected president of the Stan- i
ford Golf clu!) at an enthusiastic meet- 1
ing held in the trophy room of the old
union last night. Condit replaces Eli K.
Dorsey, who was chosen head of the
club last spring but who is not regis
tered in the University this quarter, j
Approximately fifty students attended
the gathering which is the largest turn
out ever recorded at a golf meeting on
the campus.
Men desiring to play at either Los
Altos or Burlingame were asked to pay
their monthly green fees through the
Stanford Golf club. Daily green fees
of $2 are to be paid at courses where I
the students play. Condit announced
that he will know definitely Thursday
whether the Los Altos golf course will
be available for the campus tourna
ments. If privileges of this course can
be obtained, it will be a great boon to
campus golf, as the course is only
twenty minutes distant by street car.
Many tournaments have been planned
this quarter. A team match with San ;
Jose is scheduled Sunday, October 18,
but owing to the fact that Stanford ath-:
letic teams cannot compete on Sunday, I
the date will probably be changed to j
October 17. The club is also planning
matches with faculty and alumni teams j
and with California. There is also a
possibility of playing tourneys with U.
S. C. and Oregon. No dates have yet
been set.
The University tournament, which i
will be played during, the latter part of
October, will not have handicapped;
flights. Each flight will play from j
scratch. The first flight will have eight |
freshmen and eight men from other
classes. The winner among the first-1
year men will play the victor of the
second group for the championship.'
This tournament is more to get a line!
on the material for the team than to j
decide the championship, as the real I
championship tournament is to be'
played during spring quarter.
