# JUNIORS SUGGEST NOVEL SUBSTITUTE FOR ROUGHS' DAY
## 
### 
A suggestion for the establishment
j of a substitute for "Roughs' Day" was
made at the Junior Class meeting this j
noon. The plan under consideration is j
! to have a day to be known as "Derby i
i Day."
On this occasion the juniors will ap-j
j pear on Quad arrayed in derbies of
various sizes, conditions, and types. At
; noon there will be a Lasuen derby
race in which each living group will.
! be asked to enter a rig. These rigs will i
be driven by juniors and pulled by
; underclassmen; a lady of choice may
accompany each rig. The race, which
: will be run off in heats, will take place
down the row. The winner will be pre
' sented with a gilded derby with suit
| able inscriptions, while the lady of the
winning chariot would be crowned
i "Queen of the Derby."
During the afternoon a mardi-gras 1
: Derby Ball will be held. This will last
| until time for the rally. Acocrding to a j
! statement made at the meeting this i
plan combines all the best features of I
j a gala day and omits the objectionable \
ones. There will be absolutely no haz-1
ing of the freshmen. It will serve as J
a means to celebrate the Big Game
; Rally Day and to satisfy the hilarious
! spirits of the student body which is
rapidly reaching a climax at that time.
Kenneth Graham has been appointed
chairman of a committee for the con
| sideration of this plan and others
which may be turned in.
