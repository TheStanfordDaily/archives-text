# SMOOTH PRODUCTION OF "HELL-BENT FER HEAVEN" PROMISED
## DELMER DAVES HAS CHARACTER ROLE; OTHER MEMBERS OF SUMMER CAST BACK WOMEN'S PARTS TAKEN BY JUNE CLEMENS, MARIAN HENSHALL, NEW STUDENT ACTORS 
### Isabel Schanck 
Last night's rehearsal for Friday's
performance of "Hell-Bent fer Heaven"
showed promise of a finished produc
tion. Ah members of the original cast
of the summer performance were pres
ent with the exception of Leonard
Bowman, whose part as Davhl Hunt
will be taken by Delmer Daves. Gordon
Davis, dramatic coach, has the leading
role and is also directing the play.
David Hunt is the old man whose
dry philosophy furnishes most of the
humor in an otherwise intensely dra
matic play. Daves' part gives him an
opportunity to repeat lite evident apt
ness for characterization which he
showed last year in "R. U. R." He
has been connected with campus dra
matics for several years, and his last
appearance was in the title role of
"Macbeth" last winter.
Phil Urner, best remembered for his
fine work in "Icebound" given here
two years ago, is again well cast as
Andy Lowry. He made a big hit this
summer as the happy-go-lucky South
ern boy, showing himself one of the
best actors of his type on the campus.
Guy Holliday aud Wayne Newcombe
take the other male roles. Holliday
was in "R. U. R." Newcomb is not
registered in the University this quar
ter, and is making a special trip from
Idaho to take part in Friday's produc
tion.
June Clemens and Marian Henshall,
both newcomers to the Stanford stage,
take the two women's roles. In the
play both are inhabitants of the South
Carolina mountains where the action
of the production takes place, and have
fallen under the Influence of Rufe
Pryor, the religious fanatic, when the
play opens. Miss Clemens ia registered
in the University this quarter.
