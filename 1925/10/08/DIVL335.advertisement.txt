DON'T DISREGARD
CONVENTION
Some do and "get by"; others try it and appear ridiculous.
But Why Do It?
It's Good Sense and it may be Economy, too, to have a
pair of Dlack Shoes ready to wear any evening—formal
or informal, and it is certainly Good Taste to wear them.
There are just as good reasons for this as for having your
Tuxedo made of Black Cloth—not the least of which is
that it adds to your personal appearance.
When you're in Paly—come in and we will fit a pair to
you, and your outlay need be no more than $8.50.
Black Dress Hosiery at $1.
