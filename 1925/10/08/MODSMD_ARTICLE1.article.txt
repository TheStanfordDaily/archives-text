# CARDINAL MERMEN ENTER TWO P. A. A. SENIOR TITLE RACES
## SQUAD OUT OF CONDITION Stanford Swimmers Leading Olympic Club Team By Ten Points 
### 
Stanford will be represented in both
P. A. A. senior events to be held at the
San Francisco Elks Club tonight as
the main event of the 13. P. O. E. swim
ming meet.
The championship races will be a
220-yard free style and a 200-yard relay
for four-man teams. In the P. A. A.
events held in the Encina pool last
spring Stanford swimmers established
a good lead for the year over the
Olympic Club team by taking a total
of 14 points to the Olympics' 4.
Odds Against Stanford
The Cardinals will enter the meet
tomorrow night with odds decidedly
against them. Due to the early season
and the present bone-dry condition of
the Encina tank, none of the men are
in their best shape. Carl Stevenson,
Stanford's sole representative in the
220 free style, is the only man on the
squad in good condition. He has been
training in Lake Searsville for the
Golden Gate swim to be held next Sun
day.
The swimming squad mode a trip
yesterday to the Palo Alto Military
Academy, which has the only pool in
the vicinity now open. The relay squad
picked as a result of trial heats there
consists of Arden Allen, water polo
Bob Williams, Congo Carl
smith, Jim Carson, and Doug Acker
man. Four of these men will swim in
the race tonight against a team of
Olymic swimmers who are in the best
of condition.
O'Connor, Smith Ineligible
Wally O'Connor and Colin Smith,
both of whom made good times in yes
terday's trials, are not eligible to com
pete, as thev are from Southern Cali
fornia and have not resided in the
P. A. A. district the three months re
quired for competition in a district
event.
Stevenson will be competing against
Lester Smith and Ralph Hargraves.
Smith is practically conceded the race
as he has done the 220 in close to
2:22, but Stevenson should give Har
graves a good scrap for second place.
Seven P. A. A. events remain to
take place before the year is over. The
Olympic Club will hold the 50- and
100-yard free styles, the high spring
board diving, and the 400-yard relay
in the near future. Stanford was
awarded the breast stroke, back stroke
and pentathlon events,.
Although the results of the events
tonight may cut down Stanford's point
lead to almost nothing, it is possible
that enough of the linal events will be
taken to give the Cardinal swimmers
the P. A. A. team championship for the
year.
