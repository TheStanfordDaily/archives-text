# STANFORD TACKLES OCCIDENTAL IN LAST PRELIMINARY GAME
## 
### Wilbur Adams 
The Ocrident.il Tigers will form the
I opposition for the Stanford varsity this
I week-end in the last practice game be
! fore the Pacific Coast Conference sea
j son opens. Saturday, football fans will
i have their last opportunity of viewing
[ the Cardinal eleven in action until it
runs on the field in the Coliseum at
Los Angeles, October 17.
Last year Occidental was rated as
poor competition for the Redshirts, but
before the game was over the fans
rated the Tigers as plenty good enough
competition for any team on the coast.
Stanford won by the score of 20 to 6,
after an hour of strenuous football. The
year before Stanford had beaten Occi
dental 40 to 0.
Oxy Watches Stanford
When Stanford and Santa Clara were
battling in the stadium, up in the
stand sat nine of Occidental's first
string players. All of Stanford's plays
were noted, and this week has been
spent by the Tigers in figuring out
ways of stopping the Cards' offense.
The weak places in Stanford's defense
last Saturday will be the strong points
on the Occidentals' offense this week
end.
Very little is known of Occidental's
strength except that it opened its sea
son last Friday in Fresno, with the
Fresno State Teachers College as their
opposition. The Tigers ran up 33
points, but they also allowed the
Teachers to make 10 tallies with a
touchdown and a place kick. Occidental
was not playing up to form in this
game, and the Oxy coach kept the
score down by using a large number
of substitutes. The Tigers have an
extremely light backfield, with only
one man in it weighing over 170
pounds, but they are all fast and
clever open-field runners.
Varsity Scrimmages Frosh
Pop Warner scrimmaged his men
against the freshmen yesterday after
noon. The first-string line was given
a rest, and in their places were Van
Hook at center, Robesky and Sholes at
guards. Freeman and Raffetto at
tackles, and Walker and Middleton
at ends. All of the backfield men were
used in the course of the scrimmage,
and in addition, Stan Natcher, center,
was given a try at fullback. Tom Work,
of track fame, was playing creditable
ball at halfback during the latter part
of the afternoon. The varsity scored
4 touchdowns, while the freshmen got
away with one score on a fluke play.
Ted Shipkey has been suffering from
a severe cold, and was not in a suit
yesterday. Shipkey may be given a
rest this week-end, and in such a case
either Middleton or Walker will start
at left end Saturday.
