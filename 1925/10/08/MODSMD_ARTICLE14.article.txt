# FINAL TOUCHES ADDED TO "HELL-BENT FOR HEAVEN"
## Dramatic Season Opens Tomorrow Evening With Play of Southern Mountains 
### Isabel Schanck 
rpiilS evening's linal dress rehearsal will complete preparations for "Hell-Bent
*â€¢ fer Heaven," to be given in the Assembly hall tomorrow evening at 8:15.
The play is a melodrama, full of action from the opening scene, when Sid
Hunt returns from war to find his mother under the influence of Rufe Pryor.
llufe is a coward whose distorted religious outlook makes him justify to
himself his action in stirring up an old feud between the Hunts and the
Lowrys, two families who have been friendly for the last generation.
The entire action of the play takes place in the mountain cabin home of
the Hunts, and to carry out the setting to the best advantage, a real wooden
<s>set has been constructed on the stage.

A mountain thunderstorm takes
place in the play, with stage effects
which are among the best ever seen
j on the Stanford stage. No effort has
I been spared to make the scene as near
j like that of the original production
which had a long successful run in
New York two years ago.
Although every person in the cast
is of the South Carolina mountain re
gion where the play takes place, there
is no lack of variety in the types of
characters. Everyone is a vital per
sonality in the development of the
plot, and has fallen into his part with
out allowing himself to be submerged
by the melodramatic quality of the
play as a whole.
Gordon Davis' versatility as an in
terpreter of unusual characters is well
known to Stanford playgoers. He has
been associated with dramatics here
for several years, both as a student
and dramatic coach. His polished per
formance in "The Dover Road," in
which he took the lead last year, was
one of his best characterizations. As
Rufe Pryor he has a difficult part, one
which calls for understanding and sym
pathy in its interpretation.
Phil Urner as Andy Lowry is perfect
ly cast. His best performances, in "Ice
Bound" and the first production of
"Hell-Bent fer Heaven," were both
given to summer audiences, so this
will be his opportunity to show his
capabilities to a campus audience.
Delmer Daves is the only new mem
ber of the cast, taking the part of
David Hunt, played by Leonard Bow
man in the summer performance. He
is the old man whose reminiscences
over the past tell much of the history
of the mountain family. Guy Holliday
and Wayne Newcomb play the son and
grandson of the old man. Newcomb,
as Sid Hunt, and Marian Henshall as
Jude Lowry, are the couple about
which the love interest centers.
June Clemens, who takes the part of
Meg Hunt, the mother of Sid, is also
a newcomer to Stanford. Miss Clemens
shows her capability as an actress in
her role of a simple mountain woman.
