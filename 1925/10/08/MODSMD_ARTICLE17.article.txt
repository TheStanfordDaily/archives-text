# CHARLESTON MAKES CAMPUS DEBUT AT BIG PAVILION RALLY
## ORCHESTRA WILL PLAY Burt Lapp to Lead Yells and Songs in Preparation For Saturday 
### 
"Hot Puppies! Behave yo'self! The
! Charleston has come to town!"
The famous southern dance step
that has swept the country from end
to end will make its official debut at
Stanford tonight. Contestants, skilled
in the latest twists and tricks of intri
cate step, will entertain the students
at 7 o'clock when they meet in the
basketball pavilion for the big Occi
dental game rally. No inkling ct* the
identities of the performers has been
released by the Rally Committee mem
bers, but it is whispered about on the
campus that talent has been imported
for the occasion.
Late song hits will be sung by such
campus celebrities as Dorothy Dahler,
Charles Stratton and Kenneth Graham,
who will be supported by the jazz
strains of "Chub" Tyroler's orchestra.
A saxophone quartette will close the
entertainment.
Interspersed between the numbers
Burt Lapp and his assistants will lead
a few snappy yells and songs.
The Rally Committee requests stu
dents to wear rooters' caps tonight and
to all games hereafter. Hats may be
purchased at Wideman's in Palo Alto.
The Pajamarino, which was origi
nally scheduled for tonight, has been
indefinitely postponed.
