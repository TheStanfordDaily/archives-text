# Board Attempts to Pay Women's Clubhouse Debt
## 
### 
An effort to pay off the remaining
$1500 debt remaining on the Women's
Clubhouse will be made this year
through various dances and benefits,
according to an announcement made
by the Clubhouse board. One dance
will be held this quarter.
The total cost of the Clubhouse was
over $40,000. Of this sum, nearly half
has been paid off since the building
was officially opened in March, 1915,
and the board is anxious to clear the
entire debt during the present aca
demic year.
Arrangements are being made for a
number of benefits by which it is hoped
the amount necessary can be raised.
Later in the season a special drive will
be made to get Bookstore coupons from
students. In January a supper is
planned for the winter quarter Con
ference party.
