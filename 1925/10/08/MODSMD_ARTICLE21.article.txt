# A 						Substitute for Roughs' Day
## 
### 
Since the earliest days of Stanford it has been traditional to have some
sort of impromptu celebration a day or two before the Big Game and
thereby give vent to the spirit of restless enthusiasm that always prevails
as the day of the annual classic draws near. In years gone by this annual
celebration has been known as "Roughs' Day." It had a number of ob
jectionable features mixed in with its worth-while entertainment and be
cause of this it was deemed advisable last year by the Men's Council to
abolish it, and this action was accordingly taken.
"In an attempt to find a suitable substitute for the old Roughs' Day the
junior class has hit upon the idea of inaugurating a "Derby Day." Plans
for this celebration are still rather hazy, but the class of 1927 has ap
pointed a committee to work upon them, and it is confidentially expected
that this committee can hit upon some worth-while scheme.
Some of the features of the spirit-rousing event would include a
"Lasuen Derby," the wearing of derby hats by the juniors, a Mardi Gras
ball, a monstrous rally, and to top things off, the burning of California's
pyre on the bonfire.
The bare plans seem to contain nothing offensive. The wearing of
derbies should not mean a return of the "Plug-ugly" days, nor should
derby races down the row necessitate a duplication of the offensive Wash
ington Birthday parade. If properly managed the program should furnish
wholesome fun for everyone, and the events early in the day should give
everyone an edge for the rally. Here's hoping the juniors can sponsor
something worth while that will replace Roughs' Day.
