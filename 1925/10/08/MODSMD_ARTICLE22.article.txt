# Competing With Actors
## 
### 
Thursday night is "Big Time Vaudeville Night" at the local motion
picture palace, and alleged humorists come from miles around to let loose
at the visiting entertainers a supply of abuse that has been conserved since
the previous Thursday night.
The jeers have proven to be obnoxious to everyone in the audience—
except the perpetrators. These hoodlums, in characteristic hoodlum fash
ion, seem to enjoy their own cracks immensely, while the rest of the au
dience optimistically waits out the show endeavoring to pick up a few
words from the stage. However weak the bill may be, a contrast is af
forded that insures the performers at least one or two laughs.
As for the throwing of edibles; the Daily suggests that the amount
usually spent for these plus the admission tax, would purchase a splendid
impersonal target and copious quantities of ammunition. A great deal of
satisfaction can be derived, especially by one with a childish mind, from
seeing a nice, juicy, overripe tomato slush over an immaculate white board,
and the board hasn't any feelings.
The rah-rah boys should either attend the show prepared to listen, or
should stay away entirely, and give others who have parted with fifty cents
a chance.
But tonight a more suitable remedy can be recommended—the rally.
Plenty of noise will be welcomed, and one's own judgment can be used
al>out jeering and target practice.
