A story printed in the Daily Palo Alto 011 Tuesday contained this
line "All stray freshmen were given an impromptu soaking and were pad
dled on the front lawn." Two freshmen, who are probably withholding
their names because of fear of subsequent paddlings, have written to the
Daily inquiring as to the exact location of a freshman's front lawn.
Our only comment to this is that even though the freshman class may
contain nothing else, it does have a couple of humorists. Personally, Ave
prefer the orthodox method of applying paddles for all who send in
anonymous contributions—but then that is neither here nor there. Ex
tracts from the letters follow :
" 1 wish to state that they were not paddled on the front lawn, but
upon that part of the body which Nature has provided for the reception of
all chastisement."
" and we are wondering as to the exact location of a frosh's front
lawn and the procedure necessary to paddle him in that spot."
