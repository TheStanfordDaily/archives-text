# THE 						FRESHMAN PAYS
## 
### 
Comptroller Roth has declared his intention of sending the sophomore class
a bill for the damages alleged to have been done by raiding second year men
in Encina hall Monday night. Maybe the hall was damaged to the extent of
$300 and maybe it wasn't. The Daily Palo Alto doesn't know and doesn't
particularly care. As long as someone must pay, the damages should be
assessed 011 the freshman class â€”if they hadn't locked their doors it wouldn't
have been necessary for the sophomores to go to the rouble of breaking things
up to get in.
And then we can think up another reason why the freshmen should pay.
The sophomores have had their day of fun, and will no longer concern them
selves with playful raids. As matters now stand the freshmen are looking
forward eagerly to next year when they will be sophomores and can be the
start actors in a similar reign of terror. If they have to pay for this raid,
it's a cinch they won't be anxious to conduct anything destructive next year.
And by bringing in a few additional premises we can prove that the juniors
should pay because they failed to take all the fight out of the sophomores in
the mud tussle last year. But what's the use?
