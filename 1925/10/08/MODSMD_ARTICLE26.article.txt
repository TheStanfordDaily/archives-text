Nick Begins to Learn About Women
Nick was studying in the Library- -
and incidentally wondering who he'd
get for his next date, with an occa
sional glance around to spot any "hot
looking women," as' he quaintly called
them, though goodness knows they all
had the normal temperature of 98.6
degrees.
Presently he saw a "hot-looking wo
li
man; so he took his books and went
to look up a mythical word in the en
cyclopedia. After this little strategy he
went over to the table where the
caloric appearing female was sitting,
and took the adjacent chair.
"Pardon me," he murmured, as he
let his books fall on the table. The
starry eyes rose, taking in the equally
caloric knickers and sweaters. A rather
cold look marred the starriness as she
said (somewhat too audibly)—" Ce
rtainly." Nick, nothing daunted, opened
a book. Soon, after several sidelong
glances of the type usually accom
panied by a low whistle, he remarked,
"Whatcha studyin'?" "I'm trying to
study psychology," she replied. The
accent on "trying" made Nick wonder
if his knickers had begun to register
yet. And that was just it. They had.
He waited; then tried again. Still no
luck. She started to go, and three men
in cords —one with a block-letter
sweater—arose simultaneously and
started for the dobr. A fourth started
for Nick; so he likewise arose and
went out the other door. And thus he
began to learn about women from her.
The question is, should this be la
beled a fable?
