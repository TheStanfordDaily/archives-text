The Editor, Sir;
The cause of the abrupt ending of
the freshman-sophomore annual mud
fight at the expiration of ten minutes
should have more careful analysis than
that which was outlined in yesterday's
"Dippy." The fight was supposed to be
conducted fairly. The fight rules were
presented to the sophomore class by
Stanley Weigle of ' the Men's
Council. All parties concerned agreed
to the rules, and as an additional pre
caution to see that the rules were en
forced, members of Skull and Snakes,
letter-men, and various upperclassmen
were asked to be present.
The freshmen were warned that it
was as much their duty to carry on
the fight in the prescribed manner as
it was to conform to the Honor System
during examinations. They were as
sured by their sponsors that no undue
advantage would be taken against
them. The freshmen bore all the ex
pense of the fight, which included, in
addition to monetary expense, a good
lot of manual labor in preparing the

field for action.
The prospects were good for a very
thrilling and exciting fight; hut the j
hopes of the committee in charge be
gan to darken somewhat from the mo
ment they observed the fine array of
spic-and-span block-S sweaters, clean
cords, and immaculate sombreros take
their stations around the pens into
which tlie unfortunates were to be held ,
captive.
To make a long story short, the
sophomores obeyed none of the rules. ,
The freshmen obeyed all the rules. The
sophomores would not leave the pit
into which they were thrown, but stood
by to throw the freshmen in as they
came near; this resulted in the fresh
men being thrown into both pits. By
all moral right the freshmen were vic
torious. And furthermore, it is the firm
belief of the sponsors that if the Uni
versity wants to acquire a lot of
"cocky" freshmen it can acquire the
same by letting the freshmen feel that
the student-body is against their get
ting a square deal. A new tradition
has been instituted with the class of
*29, no explanation thereof need be
mentioned. â€”Charles Dickenson.
