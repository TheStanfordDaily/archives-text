# "WHAT PRICE GLORY" DECLARED BEST WAR DRAMA BY CRITICS
## 
### C. H. P 
Accepted by leading critics as the
best war play of all times, "What
Price Glory," now playing at the Cur
ran, fails in no degree to live up to its
reputation. As a story it is tremen
dously interesting, as an accurate por
trayal of war experiences it is un
beatable, as an entertainment it is
superb, and as a play it is faultless.
The play is appreciated most by those
who are able to tolerate and appreciate
realism in its most naked state.
"What Price Glory" was written by
Maxwell Anderson, a former Stanford
man, in collaboration with Laurence
Stallings. It is a war story centered
about a hard-boiled captain and his
top-sergeant, so much alike that they
are constantly at swords' points both
in love and war. They look on war as
it actually is, from a practical, unro
mantic, and more or less cynical point
of view, completely stripped of senti
ment and inspired patriotism. The play
portrays impressions as they actually
were, in the most realistic manner pos
sible; it is chucked full of cynicism
and satire, bubbling over with the
rarest humor, and endowed with a re
markable vocabulary of profanity, so
cleverly used that none of it appears
obscene.
The action of the play is exception
al; it moves along with snap and pre
cision, and at no time does one feel
a lack of interest, lull, or monotony.
The lines are smooth and natural and
every important point is well empha
sized.
The notable Einmett Corrigan plays
the leading part, that of Captain Flagg.
He gives a wonderful performance, his
interpretation of the role being so
good that one constantly feels that he
must have actually been through simi
lar experiences in order to be able to
take advantage of the part the way
he does. Corrigan is well supported,
especially by William Davidson, as
Sergeant Quirt, and Miss Ingeborg
Torrup as Chairmain de la Cognac, the
only woman in the cast. Miss Torrup is
in a very difficult role, and her por
trayal of the promiscuous demoiselle
is exceptionally good, while Davidson
does well as the top-sergeant, and is a
perfect foil for Corrigan.
"What Price Glory" is all it is re
puted to be. It is a powerful comedy
of war which is able, by its pathos,
humor, satire, and realism, to bring
to the surface every possible human
emotion; it can change its audience
from laughter to tears in an instant
without once making use of the usual
sentimental bosh which is so preva
lent in most plays or stories of war.
It is a masterpiece of dramatic con- j
struction, ably written, ably directed, i
and ably acted. It's a damn good show.'

lar experiences in order to be able to
take advantage of the part the way
he does. Corrigan is well supported,
especially by William Davidson, as
Sergeant Quirt, and Miss Ingeborg
Torrup as Chairmain de la Cognac, the
only woman in the cast. Miss Torrup is
in a very difficult role, and her por
trayal of the promiscuous demoiselle
is exceptionally good, while Davidson
does well as the top-sergeant, and is a
perfect foil for Corrigan.
"What Price Glory" is all it is re
puted to be. It is a powerful comedy
of war which is able, by its pathos,
humor, satire, and realism, to bring
to the surface every possible human
emotion; it can change its audience
from laughter to tears in an instant
without once making use of the usual
sentimental bosh which is so preva
lent in most plays or stories of war.
It is a masterpiece of dramatic con- j
struction, ably written, ably directed, i
and ably acted. It's a damn good show.'
Accepted by leading critics as the
best war play of all times, "What
Price Glory," now playing at the Cur
ran, fails in no degree to live up to its
reputation. As a story it is tremen
dously interesting, as an accurate por
trayal of war experiences it is un
beatable, as an entertainment it is
superb, and as a play it is faultless.
The play is appreciated most by those
who are able to tolerate and appreciate
realism in its most naked state.
"What Price Glory" was written by
Maxwell Anderson, a former Stanford
man, in collaboration with Laurence
Stallings. It is a war story centered
about a hard-boiled captain and his
top-sergeant, so much alike that they
are constantly at swords' points both
in love and war. They look on war as
it actually is, from a practical, unro
mantic, and more or less cynical point
of view, completely stripped of senti
ment and inspired patriotism. The play
portrays impressions as they actually
were, in the most realistic manner pos
sible; it is chucked full of cynicism
and satire, bubbling over with the
rarest humor, and endowed with a re
markable vocabulary of profanity, so
cleverly used that none of it appears
obscene.
The action of the play is exception
al; it moves along with snap and pre
cision, and at no time does one feel
a lack of interest, lull, or monotony.
The lines are smooth and natural and
every important point is well empha
sized.
The notable Einmett Corrigan plays
the leading part, that of Captain Flagg.
He gives a wonderful performance, his
interpretation of the role being so
good that one constantly feels that he
must have actually been through simi
lar experiences in order to be able to
take advantage of the part the way
he does. Corrigan is well supported,
especially by William Davidson, as
Sergeant Quirt, and Miss Ingeborg
Torrup as Chairmain de la Cognac, the
only woman in the cast. Miss Torrup is
in a very difficult role, and her por
trayal of the promiscuous demoiselle
