# DEBATERS TOUR U. S.
## 
### 
A debate team composed of graduate
students from Oxford university is
again touring the United States and
Canada, evidently with the intention
of repeating last year's success. Cor
nell will be the first university in this
country to meet the Englishmen.
The subject of this debate will be:
"Resolved, That the principle of self
determination is a wholesome one."
The English system, by which two
Oxford men and one Cornell man will
uphold the affirmative and two Cor
nell men and one Oxford man the
negative, will be used. The decision
will be determined by vote of the audi
ence.

WILL OPEN SOON—We hope you
will like our New Smoke and Spe
cialty Shop which will be opened
soon, next to the New Stanford
Theatre. Yours, Morey.—Adv.
