# PLUG UGLIES FIRST WORN BY JUNIORS IN WEIRD CEREMONY
## 
### Monte Eaton 
The Plug Ugly, one of the most an- â– 
eient of Stanford traditions, has been i
dead ten years this autumn. Plug Ugly
was the name given to the plug hats
that the juniors once used as a class
emblem. Out of the donning of the i
plug hats by the juniors each fall grew i
the traditional Plug Ugly faice and :
Plug Ugly rush.
First Ceremony in 1898
The first Plug Ugly ceremony was \
given by the juniors in 1898. It was a I
farce which formally introduced the
wearing of the plug. In this same year,
the sombrero was adopted by the sen
iors. The plug was installed in the
autumn by a weird ceremony \yhich j
took place place on the football field.
After the play the seniors rushed
from the bleachers and attempted to
smash the new plug hats. The fighting
was carried to the Quad, where a mob
of seniors harassed the procession of
juniors and attempted properly to
christen the junior hats. In the years
that followed, the play lost much of
its early grandeur, while the fight
gradually rose to importance and be
came installed as a tradition.
Farce Out-of-Doors
The first Plug Ugly farces were held
out-of-doors and combined original
songs and dances with clever dialogue
and weird costumes and stage effects.
In later years the constant harassing
of the actors by the seniors made it |
impossible for the audience to hear the
performance. For a few years the
farce was given in the assembly, but
it finally dwindled to almost nothing.
The last farces served only as a pre
liminary to the fight.
The Plug Ugly fight finally took the
form of an upperclass rush. The jun
iors congregated in front of the Li
brary and the seniors formed a barrier
around the entrances to the quad.
The juniors usually formed a compact
phalanx and rushed at the senior bar
rier, while the seniors attempted to
smash as many of the plug hats as
possible before the juniors could break
through their ranks into the inner i
Quad. Once on the Quad the juniors
rushed madly around the square of
arcades, while the seniors threw rocks
at the plug uglies and tried to smash
them with their fists.
Fierce Upperclass Fights
Many fierce battles between the two
upperclasses were fought for the pos-;
session of the postoffice steps or the j
law steps. With no one to regulate:
them, the fights often became danger- !
ous. Once the juniors had reached the |
inner Quad the fight was considered
won. Not infrequently, however, the j
seniors succeeded in turning back the I
juniors.
Plug Ugly posters advertising the
farce came out the day before the j
rush. In time as much controversy over
these posters grew up between the
upperclassmen as recently existed be-,
tween the freshmen and sophomores.'

The seniors sometimes succeeded iu
tearing down the junior posters and
put come-back posters up in their
place. The night before the last Plug
Ugly in 1914 the seniors caught and
tied up over eighty juniors who were
putting out the Plug Ugly posters. The
next morning only the senior posters
were in evidence.
The Plug Ugly rush was abolished
in 1915 by an overwhelming majority
of votes by both the junior and senior
classes. In 1916 the Men's Conference
voted to re-establish the Plug Ugly
tradition in some form, but other wars
in Europe soon caused it to be forgot
ten l'orever.
