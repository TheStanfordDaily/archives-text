# Senior Quad Sales Will Continue Until Tomorrow
## 
### 
The senior sale of the Quad will be
continued today and tomorrow to en
able all seniors who have not yet pur
chased their copy to do so during these
days.
Lowell Matthay, manager of the
Quad, urges all members of the class
of '26, whether they graduate this year
or not, to purchase their copy at once
so that their pictures may appear in
the senior section of the Quad.
According to the special system
used, seniors who are unable to pay
at this time may do so later.
Each senior will be notified of the
date for his picture sitting, and this
date must be kept unless special ar
rangements are made beforehand.
