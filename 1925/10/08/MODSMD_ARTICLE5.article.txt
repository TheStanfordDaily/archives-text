# GLEE CLUB TO HOLD TRYOUTS IN SEARCH OF NEW MATERIAL
## 
### 
Tryouts for the Stanford Glee Club
will be held next Monday afternoon at
4 o'clock in Room 84, Inner Quad.
Membership is open to all men regis
tered in the University and an invita
tion is extended to all interested in
glee club singing. Besides new voices
the club will require the services of a
student accompanist for rehearsal and
concert work throughout the year.
Pianists are requested to see Warren
D. Allen.
The club offers anyone with ability
as an entertainer or stunt performer
an opportunity to be put on their pro
gram for all concerts and take trips
with the club when it fills" off-campus
engagements. It is planned to include
several acts and comedy stunts in the
program if some of sufficient merit
can be found.
Delmer Daves is managing the club
singers and, besides the big trip
through the Pacific Northwest to be
taken the next spring quarter, expects
shortly to have several engagements
scheduled for this quarter. The singers
may give a concert in Sacramento dur
ing the Thanksgiving vacation besides
probable engagements in San Fran
cisco high schools and theatres of the
vicinity.
Those successful in the tryouts next
Monday will learn the new songs on
the repertoire of the club at the same
time as the older members. Many note
worthy vocal numbers have been se
lected by Allen, aided by a committee
of the singers. Next Monday morning
the Glee Club will be heard in the
Assembly singing the modified version
of the Stanford hymn.
