# NEW POINT SYSTEM FORMED TO CONTROL WOMEN'S ACTIVITIES
## 
### 
Two tentative systems of points for
activities have been made out for the
women of the University by the Wo
men's Council. Investigations were
made into these systems on the ad
vice of last year's Council.
Under the point system, each wo
man's extra-curriculum activities would
be limited. For each activity she would
receive a certain number of points,
and when she exceeded the maximum
number allowed, she would be required
to drop some of her outside work.
Check on women's activities would be
kept by a committee which would have
on file every woman's activity record.
The aim of these systems, according
to the Women's Council, is not to make
restrictions so much as to give every
woman a chance to participate in
some activity.
The systems as now drawn up will
be submitted to the women of the
University at some near date. If the
women decide to adopt a point sys
tem, a committee will draw up a re
vised plan, and submit it to them
