# WILBUR ADVOCATES USEFUL OCCUPATION OF STUDENTS' TIME
## SPEAKS TO EUPHRONIA Coach Andrew Kerr Talks at Open Meeting of Debating Society 
### 
Three hours may be allotted by the
average student for useful occupation
outside of the curriculum, according to
a statement made by Dr. Wilbur in an
' address before the open meeting of
the Euphronia Debating Society held
last evening. Speaking on "The Place
of Outside Activities," Dr. Wilbur
showed how a student could reason
ably conserve three hours after devot
ing, for example, nine hours to sleep,
nine to study and physical work, and
three hours to meals.
"Of the 450 freshmen entering Stan
ford this year, approximately 250 will
not graduate," continued President
Wlibur. Of those not graduating, vari
ous causes ranging from economic
trouble or poor health, to plain lazi
ness, inefficiency, or excessive diver
sion, are given.
Dr. Wilbur declared that, while un
doubted advantages lie in participation
in debating, journalism, and other ac
tivities, the danger lies in one of two
conditions, either in devoting too much
time to an activity, resulting in the
sidetracking of study, or in taking part
in a great many activities with a sub
sequent failure in everything. He
closed by offering encouragement to
the freshmen, urging them to avoid
procrastination, and to form habits of
usefulness. Thus they build a record
instead of continually making excuses.
The first speaker on the program
was Andrew Kerr, who discussed the
advantages offered at Stanford for pro
viding physical training for all stu
dents, based on the spirit of play in
stead of the old customs of compul
sion. He particularly emphasized the
lessons of loyalty, obedience, dependa
bility, and self-control that are to be
gained in athletic participation, in ad
dition to physical benefits.
Professor Henry A. Shinn, coach of
debate, spoke on this activity and its
advantages to those taking part. "The
progress of the world is held back, not
because of lack of ideas, but because
of the lack of initiative in their use,"
said Mr. Shinn. He continued by show
ing how debating calls upon original
thinking to assemble material from
different sources into conclusions.
Tryouts for Euphronia will he held
next Wednesday, according to George
N. Crocker, president of the society.
Five-minute speeches will be required
from all participating in the tryouts.

ably conserve three hours after devot
ing, for example, nine hours to sleep,
nine to study and physical work, and
three hours to meals.
"Of the 450 freshmen entering Stan
ford this year, approximately 250 will
not graduate," continued President
Wlibur. Of those not graduating, vari
ous causes ranging from economic
trouble or poor health, to plain lazi
ness, inefficiency, or excessive diver
sion, are given.
Dr. Wilbur declared that, while un
doubted advantages lie in participation
in debating, journalism, and other ac
tivities, the danger lies in one of two
conditions, either in devoting too much
time to an activity, resulting in the
sidetracking of study, or in taking part
in a great many activities with a sub
sequent failure in everything. He
closed by offering encouragement to
the freshmen, urging them to avoid
procrastination, and to form habits of
usefulness. Thus they build a record
instead of continually making excuses.
The first speaker on the program
was Andrew Kerr, who discussed the
advantages offered at Stanford for pro
viding physical training for all stu
dents, based on the spirit of play in
stead of the old customs of compul
sion. He particularly emphasized the
lessons of loyalty, obedience, dependa
bility, and self-control that are to be
gained in athletic participation, in ad
dition to physical benefits.
Professor Henry A. Shinn, coach of
debate, spoke on this activity and its
advantages to those taking part. "The
progress of the world is held back, not
because of lack of ideas, but because
of the lack of initiative in their use,"
said Mr. Shinn. He continued by show
ing how debating calls upon original
thinking to assemble material from
different sources into conclusions.
Tryouts for Euphronia will he held
next Wednesday, according to George
N. Crocker, president of the society.
Five-minute speeches will be required
from all participating in the tryouts.
