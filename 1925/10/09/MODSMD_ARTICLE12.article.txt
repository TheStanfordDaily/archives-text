# CARDS HEAVY FAVORITES TO CONQUER OCCIDENTAL
## Tigers, In Fine Shape, Doped To Furnish Hard Fight; Shipkey Out With Cold 
### Wilbur Adams 
The Occidental College football varsity arrived in Palo Alto this morning
on the Lark. The varsity squad, composed of thirty-three players, is accom
panied by coaches, trainers, and five managers, all of whom are staying at
the Cardinal Hotel. The visitors will indulge in a light workout in the
stadium at 3:30 o'clock this afternoon.
Stanford's football schedule calls for a game with the Occidental College
of Los Angeles tomorrow afternoon at 3 o'clock in the stadiunu. Although
the Cards are expected to win, with several touchdowns to spare, they are
not doped to have a set-up. This is the third consecutive year that Stanford

s>has met Occidental, and in the two
previous matches the Cards learned
that the Tigers fight until the final
gun is shot.
The Oxy team came out of the con
! test with the Fresno State Teachers
j College last Friday without a scratch,
I and with a 33 to 10 victory to their
j credit.
In signal practice last night, Stan
■ ford's first line team was somewhat
| changed. Merrill Armour was in Bob
I Hunt's right guard position, while
Chris Freeman was playing at right
! tackle in Leo Harris' place. The ends
• were Tex Middleton and Ed Walker.
I The rest of the line remained the same
as last week with Ward Poulson play
i ing his regular tackle, Fred Swan in
[ left guard, and McCreery at center.
Pop Warner is still trying to find the
seven men that will make the best
combination in the forward wall. Ted
Shipkey has spent the latter part of
the week in the hospital wtih a cold
and may not even don a suit tomorrow.
Solomon Starts
The backfield will be the same to
morrow as it was against Santa Clara,
except that Fred Solomon will start
at quarterback. In last week's game
Solomon proved himself to be the best
signal caller on the Stanford squad,
besides being Warner's best defensive
quarter. George Bogue and Mike Mur
phy will start at the halfback positions
against the Tigers, and Captain Ernie
Nevers will be seen at fullback as
usual. The Cardinal backfield averages
185 pounds to a man, while Occidental
has but one backfield player that can
tip the scales over 170 pounds.
Hyland Fastest
Dick Hyland proved himself to be 1
the fastest man on the squad yester- j
day afternoon when the whole squad
competed in a 100-yard dash. Hyland
will see action tomorrow, and his run- '■
ning back of punts will bear watching. ;
Don Hill is one more halfback that will
be used against Occidental.
Interest in tomorrow's game rests :
largely in how fast Stanford is im-!
proving, and whether they are improv-1
ing fast enough to beat U. S. C. when ■
the two teams meet in Los Angeles'
one week from tomorrow. If the Cards i
show as much improvement tomorrow '
over Occidental as they did in the 1
Santa Clara games, a real battle can |
be anticipated in the Southland on j
October 17.

and may not even don a suit tomorrow.
Solomon Starts
The backfield will be the same to
morrow as it was against Santa Clara,
except that Fred Solomon will start
at quarterback. In last week's game
Solomon proved himself to be the best
signal caller on the Stanford squad,
besides being Warner's best defensive
quarter. George Bogue and Mike Mur
phy will start at the halfback positions
against the Tigers, and Captain Ernie
Nevers will be seen at fullback as
usual. The Cardinal backfield averages
185 pounds to a man, while Occidental
has but one backfield player that can
tip the scales over 170 pounds.
Hyland Fastest
Dick Hyland proved himself to be 1
the fastest man on the squad yester- j
day afternoon when the whole squad
competed in a 100-yard dash. Hyland
will see action tomorrow, and his run- '■
ning back of punts will bear watching. ;
Don Hill is one more halfback that will
be used against Occidental.
Interest in tomorrow's game rests :
largely in how fast Stanford is im-!
proving, and whether they are improv-1
ing fast enough to beat U. S. C. when ■
the two teams meet in Los Angeles'
one week from tomorrow. If the Cards i
show as much improvement tomorrow '
over Occidental as they did in the 1
Santa Clara games, a real battle can |
be anticipated in the Southland on j
October 17.
The Occidental College football varsity arrived in Palo Alto this morning
on the Lark. The varsity squad, composed of thirty-three players, is accom
panied by coaches, trainers, and five managers, all of whom are staying at
the Cardinal Hotel. The visitors will indulge in a light workout in the
stadium at 3:30 o'clock this afternoon.
Stanford's football schedule calls for a game with the Occidental College
of Los Angeles tomorrow afternoon at 3 o'clock in the stadiunu. Although
the Cards are expected to win, with several touchdowns to spare, they are
not doped to have a set-up. This is the third consecutive year that Stanford

s>has met Occidental, and in the two
previous matches the Cards learned
that the Tigers fight until the final
gun is shot.
The Oxy team came out of the con
! test with the Fresno State Teachers
j College last Friday without a scratch,
I and with a 33 to 10 victory to their
j credit.
In signal practice last night, Stan
■ ford's first line team was somewhat
| changed. Merrill Armour was in Bob
I Hunt's right guard position, while
Chris Freeman was playing at right
! tackle in Leo Harris' place. The ends
• were Tex Middleton and Ed Walker.
I The rest of the line remained the same
as last week with Ward Poulson play
i ing his regular tackle, Fred Swan in
[ left guard, and McCreery at center.
Pop Warner is still trying to find the
seven men that will make the best
combination in the forward wall. Ted
Shipkey has spent the latter part of
the week in the hospital wtih a cold
and may not even don a suit tomorrow.
