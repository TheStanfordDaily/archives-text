# SHINN SETS TUESDAY FOR DEBATE TRYOUTS
## 
### 
Tryouts for the dual debate sche
duled with the University of California
for November 10 will be held Tuesday,
October 13. Judges selected from the
Law and Political Science depart
ments, in addition to Professor Henry
A. Shinn, debating coach, will choose
two men to form the team, together
with two alternates.
The question as tentatively arranged
by representatives of the two schools
is: "Resolved, That the democratic
ideal is a mistaken sentiment." Owing
to the objection that too many issues
are involved, it is possible that
changes, or even an entire revision of
the question, will be made.
All wishing to try out for the debate
should see Professor Shinn as soon
as possible in order to prepare for the
tryouts.
