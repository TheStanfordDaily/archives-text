# QUAD EDITOR TELLS BOARD OF CHANGES
## 
### 
Plans for the next Quad were out- i
lined by Basil L. McGann, editor, at a
Quad Board meeting held last night.
H. S. Crocker Company has the con- i
tract for publishing, while covers for 1
the book will be supplied by the Web
ber-McCrea company of Los Angeles, j
Although some campus amateur art
work will be used, most of the art for
the yearbook will be done by Pedro
Lemos and Delmer Daves.
According to McGann, the Quad will !
be "pure Stanford" throughout. He has
reorganized the staff for a new distri
bution of responsibility, appointing
four assistant heads who are responsi
ble to the editor for certain sections
of the book.
In a week the Quad editorial staff
will move to its new offices on the
top floor of the Press building, but the
managerial offices will remain in the
Administration building.
