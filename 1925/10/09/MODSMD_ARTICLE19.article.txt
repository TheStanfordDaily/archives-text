# VARSITY SWIMMERS LOSE TO OLYMPICS BY NARROW MARGIN
## STEVENSON THIRD IN 220 Cardinals, Out of Condition, Make Excellent Showing For Early Season 
### 
Stanford swimmers forced the fast
Olympic relay team to the limit, but
I were defeated by six inches in the
P. A. A. 200-yard relay held last night
at the San Francisco Elks' Club.
Although out of condition due to the
waterless state of the Enclna pool, the
Cardinal mermen were able to average
2G seconds per man. The race was one
of the most exciting and hotly con
tested that has been seen in a long
time and furnished many thrills to
visiting Elks who were the chief spec
tators.
At the end of the third lap the two
teams were neck-and-neck but Georgo
Schroth, giant Olympic Club star, man
aged to make the touch a split second
faster than his rival. The excellent
showing made by the Stanford swim
mers so early and without any train
ing is evidence they will be hard
to beat later in the season.
Swimming for Stanford were: Arden
Allen, Doug Ackerman, Bob Williams,
and Congo Carlsmith. The Olympians
were Lester Smith, Frank Mooney,
George Broplin and George Schroth.
Carl Stevenson, varsity distance
star, took third place in the P. A. A.
220-yard free style, in which the win
ner, Lester Smith, made the fast time
of 2:20 2-5, setting a new P. A. A.
record. Second place was taken by
George Schroth, who defeated Steven
son by faster turns. Schroth, who is
well over six feet and strongly built,
got a tremendous shove-off every time
he reached the wall, while Stevenson,
who has been training lately in the
open water of Lake Searsville, missed
many fast turns.
