# The
						Women's Clubhouse Debt
## 
### 
The Women's Clubhouse is in debt to the sum of $1500. It is impera
tive that this be paid off before the end of the current year, according
to an announcement made by Mrs. G. J. Thomas, president of the
clubhouse board. A vigorous money-raising campaign is in order and
it is essential to have the whole-hearted support of every Stanford man
and woman if the debt is to be paid.
The program for money raising hinges upon a number of benefits
which will be given during the year. Most of these entertainments will
be in the nature of dances and bridge parties. Every possible effort will
be made to bring Stanford students together and thereby provide means
'for paying off the debt on this $40,000 building which is the center of
the social life of both men and women on the campus.
An easy method to aid in the fund raising will be to deposit Bookstore
purchase slips for the Women's Clubhouse fund in the special box pro
vided for that purpose by the Bookstore door. The rebate from each
slip approximates 10 per cent, and if everyone remembers to leave his
slips for the Clubhouse fund it will mean many dollars before the end
of the vear.
