# Rooters
## 
### 
At the Santa Clara game last week it was very noticeable that three
fourths of the Stanford rooting section was made up of freshmen. When
one figures that there are 2500 men in the University and that only 450
or so of them are freshmen, it becomes quite evident that most of the
upperclassmen were some place where they shouldn't have been.
If Stanford is to make the proper showing at Los Angeles next week
it must have a winning football team and it must also have a rooting
section that excels that of the Trojans. It will be impossible to do this
unless the upperclassmen get off their high horses and join the plebian
throng of rooters. This should not be a hard thing to do, since the
rooters' seats are the best in the coliseum.
And after the U. S. C. game the Cards have four contests intervening
before the Big Game. All but one of these games are in the Stanford
stadium, and at each of them a compact, large rooting section is going
to be a necessity if Stanford is to win. Upperclassmen must show as
much interest as the freshmen and sit in the proper section, so that they
can lend their organized support to the team.
