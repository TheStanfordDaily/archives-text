In yesterday's edition of the Daily Palo Alto there appeared an
editorial calling attention to the rowdyism that has prevailed at the

An unprecedented atmosphere of calm and quiet prevailed at the show
last night. Perhaps this should be attributed to the fact that most of the
roughs were at the rally, but the Daily prefers to believe that Stanford
men have at last gotten .wise to themselves. It is to be hoped that
future programs at the New Stanford will be as quiet as the one last night.
