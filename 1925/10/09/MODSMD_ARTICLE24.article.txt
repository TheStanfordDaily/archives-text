						Quiet Vaudeville

In yesterday's edition of the Daily Palo Alto there appeared an
editorial calling attention to the rowdyism that has prevailed at the
Thursday night vaudeville entertainments at the New Stanford theatre
for the past few weeks and urging that students who must throw things
use white boards instead of poor actors for targets.
An unprecedented atmosphere of calm and quiet prevailed at the show
last night. Perhaps this should be attributed to the fact that most of the
roughs were at the rally, but the Daily prefers to believe that Stanford
men have at last gotten .wise to themselves. It is to be hoped that
future programs at the New Stanford will be as quiet as the one last night.
