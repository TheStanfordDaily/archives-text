# Petty Thievery
## 
### 
Ever since football practice started on September 15 men around the
gymnasium have been bothered by petty thievery. Scarcely a day passes
by during which someone does not come back to his locker to find that
his change, or a fountain pen, or a trinket of some kind has been taken
from his pockets.
This is a condition which under no circumstances should exist at
Stanford. Stanford men have always held the reputation of being a
pretty straight-shooting bunch and for a very few students to continue
to steal small articles likens Stanford to a high school where such things
will always happen with more or less regularity. Tubbing is too good
for men who resort to this type of acquiring spending money.

The Southern Pacific Railroad Company is giving Stanford students an
unusual opportunity to witness the game* in Los Angeles on October 17, by
offering a $16.00 round trip fare. With such low transportation costs every
student should pjan on going South.

Although active preparations not begin for several weeks toward
building the freshman bonfire, first-year men may save themselves a lot of
work later if they will make, arrangements for obtaining the old ties being
taken up along University avenue. At present the San Jose Teachers College
seems to be getting away with most of them.

To overcome masculine bashfulness at lowa University co-eds have
organized a date bureau which caters to timid Romeos and girls who go on a
date for the mere fun involved. It isn't hard to figure out what rare combina
tions must come from such an arrangement. Protect us from anything similar
at Stanford!

Out of 4790 students registered at the University of Texas last year only
twelve were foreign students. By comparing this number with a typical
Stanford class we at once realize what a cosmopolitan atmosphere surrounds
the Farm.
