' the half-tone dot.,
who would be a full-tone
but isn't.
What position in the line should the
center play?
Answer! ! ! !
The center should play between the
right guard and the left guard and
should always face the opposing team.
Centers who do not face the opposing
team often make the mistake of pass
ing the ball to the backfleld men on
the other team. The center should
never try to throw the ball over his
shoulder. The best centers usually pass
the ball so that the backfield men can
catch it on the first or second bounce.
A direct pass is dangerous because the
backfleld men may not see it coming.
The center should always shout "ball"
immediately before passing it.
A small man should always be used
as center so that the backfield can see
over him. On punts the safest proce
dure is for the center to firmly grasp
the ball in both hands and at a signal
walk back and hand it to the man who
is to kick it. This makes it certain
that the ball will not be fumbled and
also puts another man in a position to
protect the kicker. Roving centers
should never rove outside the football
field.

Seeing as how posters have become
so popular in the last few days Cab
bages wants to make a few sugges
tions.
We suggest that the sophomores
tear up their posters before pasting
them down so as to save the freshmen
the trouble.
The freshmen should always arrange
to have rain on the night the sopho
more posters are to be put out.
We suggest that the next sophomore
class get out two heavy linoleum pos
ters instead of two hundred paper ones.
In the future freshmen will not be
allowed to place their posters on the
inner walls of the chapel.
We suggest that the class of 1930 be
told to go to somewhere than heh.
Judging from the number of classes
that have been told to go there, hell
must be quite overcrowded and stuffy
by now.
We suggest that in the future sopho
more posters be used for advertising
purposes only.
