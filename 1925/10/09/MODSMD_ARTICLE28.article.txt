Editor Daily Palo Alto, Sir:
In yesterday's paper you spoke of
the sacrilege of laying posters in the
Inner Quad. As a loyal Stanford stu
dent, I agree with you that it is a
horrible breach. There is, perhaps, a
little excuse, in the fact that the of
fenders were freshmen, since they can
not be expected to assimilate all the
traditions and rules in a few days.
In the paper the day before appeared
a story on the sophomore raid 011 Ell
- containing the statement that the
1928 men had destroyed property to
the value of $1500. Isn't that rather
more than Stanford tradition permits
to hazing? Yet it seems that not one
of the upperclassmen ventured to in
terfere. Is it possible that the destruc
tion of University property makes 110
impression, other than to produce a
shrug and a "Rotten thing to do?"
That is ihe attitude of the upperclass
men, it would seem.
The Class of 1928 should be deeply
ashamed of its action Monday night,
but the upperclassmen should feel that
their passivity is a blot on their name
as representatives of Stanford.
—X. Y. Z.

THE HUGE VOLUME of business
handled by the French Cleaners on
the campus may seem spectacular, but
the one-day service is the answer to
the doubters. —Adv.
