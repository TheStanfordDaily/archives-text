# ROOTERS RECEIVE FIRST INSTRUCTIONS OF YEAR AT RALLY
## 
### 
The first football rally of the year
was held in the pavilion last night to
arouse enthusiasm for the Occidental
game next Saturday and for the pur
pose of rehearsing songs and yells. By
stressing different parts of a yell, Bur
ton L. Lapp, newly elected cheer
leader, showed how the yelling could
be made more effective.
Lapp also urged the students to prac
tice Stanford songs, asking that each
living group sing at least two a day.
Robert E. Lewis, president of the
A. S. S. U., gave a short talk in which
he brought to the front the fact that
many of the students, including the
upperclassmen, were not occupying the
rooting section at football games.
As a part of the evening's entertain
ment the campus was introduced to
the famous southern step known as
the Charleston by several freshmen
and upperclassmen dancing to the
tune of "Yes Sir, She's My Baby"
played by Tyroler's orchestra.
Dorothy Dahler, Charles C. Stratton,
and Kenneth W. Hess entertained the
rooters with a group of songs, while a
freshman number imitated Harold
Lloyd in "The Freshman."
