Major Geary requests that all men
of the Monday practical class of the
R. O. T. C. report to the stables in
uniform promptly at 1:15 Monday
afternoon, October 12. The Pathe News
operator will take moving pictures of
the activities of the R. O. T. C. at this
time. Any upperclassmen from other
classes, who can come out Monday
without cutting classes, will be of
great assistance.
