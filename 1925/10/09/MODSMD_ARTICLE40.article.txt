# ALLEN WILL REPEAT THURSDAY'S ORGAN RECITAL ON SUNDAY
## 
### Herbert Klein 
An organ recital will be given in
the Memorial Church Sunday afternoon
at 4 o'clock by Warren D. Allen. Uni
versity organist. The program will be
identical with the effective one played
in yesterday's concert.
Opening the recital is the noted
"Prelude to Lohengrin," by Richard
Wagner, creator of the "music drama"
and master of the use of music for
depicting emotional states. The "Pre
lude" is made up of themes taken from
the opera itself, and is designed to
put the listener in the proper mood
for the drama which is to follow im
mediately after. The next group of
selections is being played for the first
time at a Stanford organ recital. They
are two Chorale-Preludes from the
works of the immortal Jon Sebastian
Bach.
Bach lived at the time of the
Protestant Reformation in Germany
and was the greatest musician of that
movement. He was devout and his
simple faith and strong religious fer
vor found* its greatest expression in
the hymns and chorales which he com
posed. His music brings out the spirit
of the hymn to which it is set.
The two played will be "Have Mercy
on Me, O Lord My God," and "Rejoice
.Now, Christians One and All," which
has a note of jubilation and triumph.
An Idyl entitled "From the South"
follows with a dreamy and delicate
melody moving peacefully along. In
sharp contrast to its restfulness is the
final number, "Heroic Piece," by Ros
seter G. Cole, a contemporary Ameri
can composer. In this the entire might
of the organ seems to be unloosed in
great floods of sound. It has an abun
dance of force and vigor but also a
very simple and pleasing melodic back
ground throughout.
