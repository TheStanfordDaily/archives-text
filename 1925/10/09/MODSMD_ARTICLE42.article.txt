The Editor, Sir:
I am not criticizing Charles W. Dick
enson for firing the finish gun when
he did. He was chairman of the Mud
ight committee, or whatever it was,
and he had a right to end the fight
whenever he felt like it. What I do
object to is the impression given to
the campus ol the destitute freshman
and the pampered sophomore. I was in
the fight myself, and I saw many
things Dickenson does not mention.
I saw a number ot sophomores in the
hole that they should not have been
in. I saw a sponsor try to pull a sopho
more out of the hole by the hair and,
in spite of the witty '29 men, we ali
know which part of the anatomy a
man's hair is, and that it hurts like
the devil to use it as a tow rope.
It would seem that the freshmen
broke the rules a tiny bit, at least. I
can t say that the sophomores were
favored by the student body. In fact,
it seems that the sponsors favored the
freshmen both at the fight and during
the raid the night before. I should say
that their favor took the form of none
too gentle persuasion, as certain '28
men present on both occasions can
testify, not only verbally but by the
exhibition of bodily injuries.
I think there is no freshman who
could come forward and truthfully say
he was maltreated by the sponsors
either Monday night or Tuesday after
noon. The class of '28 knows that cer
tain of its number were hurt. The class
of 29 has no such evidence.

Putting two and two together, how
can Dickenson say the frosh will get
cocky' from not getting a square
deal? The sophomores are not com
plaining, but if it is a question as to
who did not get the square deal, I
think both sides of the case might be
presented. —John R. Golden, '28.
