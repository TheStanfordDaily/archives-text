# STRONG OPPONENTS FACE FRESHMEN IN TOMORROW'S GAMES
## 
### Frank Baker 
With two tough games slated for to
morrow, the freshman grid teams are
in for a severe test. The U. S. Army
eleven from the Presidio will come
down for the preliminary to the
Varsity-Occidental classic, while Ala
meda High will furnish competition at
10 o'clock in the morning.
The army game, which will begin at
1 o'clock in the stadium, bears the ear
marks of a hard struggle. Last Satur
day, although beaten 10 to 1 by the
California frosh, the army team
knocked four of the Bruin babe stars
out of the game with injuries. Most
critics agreed that the Berkeley lads
showed great improvement from their
form of two weeks ago, when they
came through with this victory, which
indicates that Coach Hunt will need
his full strength on the field tomorrow.
Husky Hunt will make but two
changes in his starting lineup of last
week. Bob Vermilya, who has been
nursing two cracked ribs received last
Saturday, will be replaced by A1 Cook,
whose playing is on a par with that
of Vermilya. Rherig will start at left
end, in place of Worden.
Lewis, at quarter, with Sims, Wil
ton, and Smalling, will comprise the
first string backfield. This combination,
which was used last week, seems to
be the class of the backfield choices
on the quad. Two backs in particular.
Frost and Eaton, will bear watching,
as it will be their first game on the
first squad. The fight these two have
put up in practice has merited their j
promotion from the second string.
The work of Fleishacker, at right j
guard, will be watched critically if he |
is sent into the game. He is big and
has considerable ability, but to date
has lacked aggressiveness.
The Alameda High eleven, which
faces the second team at 10 o'clock
on the freshman field, will be no easy
opponent. When the high school lads
scored a victory over last year's year
ling second team they received a sen
sation they would like to repeat. The
second babe eleven must show more
drive on the offense than last week if
they hope to leave the field on the
long end of the score.
