# GLEE CLUB TRYOUTS WILL BEGIN MONDAY
## 
### 
Men wishing to try out for a place
in the Stanford Glee Club will have
their only opportunity next Monday
afternoon at 4 o'clock in Room 84.
Singers are not the only ones invited
as the Glee Club this year wants men
with ability as entertainers.
The Glee Club accompanist this year
will be chosen from pianists on the
campus. He will travel with the club
on all trips as well as playing for re
hearsals and local engagements. Any
pianist is eligible to try out for this
place and can do so by calling Warren
D. Allen as soon as possible.
The main event on the Glee Club's
program for the year is the tour of
the northern part of the Pacific Coast,
through the states of Washington and
Oregon. Delmer Daves, manager of the
Glee Club, spent part of the summer
in the north arranging for these dates
for the trip. Thanksgiving vacation will
probably see the club in Sacramento
filling a concert engagement there.
Several engagements will be made in
San Francisco and on the Peninsula
for this and the winter quarter, giving
the club a more active year than it
has ever had before.
