# BREAKAGE LOSS FEE FOR FRESHMAN HALL RAISED BY A. E. ROTH
## 
### 
A raise of twenty-five cents in the
Encina Hall breakage loss fee for next
quarter was promised the freshman
class by A. E. Roth, University comp
troller, when he addressed a meeting
of the first-year men in Encina last
night.
It will be necessary to charge $1.25
the winter quarter because of the $540
deficit which was not covered by the
men living in Encina last year Roth
suggested that the Encina house com
mittee stop all unnecessary breakage
losses in the hall, and with the money
saved from the breakage fund pro
vide scholarships for members of the
class of 1929.
"Throwing of food in the Encina
dining hall is another act that can not
be tolerated by either the University
or the Student board of control," de
clared Roth. "After spending $280,000
to build the Encina dining halls, the
University receives less than five per
cent interest on its investment."
