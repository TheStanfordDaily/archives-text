# COUNCIL TO LIMIT PARTICIPATION IN WOMEN'S ACTIVITIES
## Draws Up Point Systems to Allow More Students to Do Outside Work 
### 
Two tentative point systems, both
providing means for limiting participa
tion by the women students in outside
activities and thus giving more women
opportunity to take part in extra-cur
ricular work, have been drawn up by
the Women's Council. These point sys
tems will serve as a basis for a later
system if the women decide to make
further investigations in the matter at
their assembly October 19. The sec
ond plan when drawn up will be voted
on by the women.
The Women's Council has stated the
purpose of the point system in any
form as follows:
"The point system is not a means of
giving honorable recognition to stu
dents for activities, and it is not a
means of rewarding merit. It is a sys
tem devised to prevent a small group
of women from being overburdened
with activities by distributing the of
fices and committee work more evenly
among the women. By restricting the
number of University activities in
which one person may take part, the
point system aims at three things—

"First: to spread among the many
students those privileges, pleasures,
and honors which have previously
been monopolized by a few.
"Second: to benefit the organiza
tions of activities by assuring each
position or office an officer whose in
terests are concentrated rather than
so scattered that her efforts become
Inefficient.
"Third: to protect prominent indi
viduals from being burdened with more
outside work than is safe for their
studies or their health."
The two point systems as outlined
by the Women's Council are as fol
lows:
Number I
\Jo woman may carry over a total of
30' points during a quarter. Floating
points shall be considered as tempor
ary points and lasting only as long as
there is participation in the activity.
