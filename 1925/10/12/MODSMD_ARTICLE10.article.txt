"We want student body participa
tion in extra-curricula activities rather
than participation by a few," declared
Robert E. Lewis, president of the As
sociated Students, at the general as
sembly this morning. Lewis said that
the majority of the students in the Uni
versity should take an interest in ac
tivities rather than leave the responsi
bility on the shoulders of a few. He
extended a welcome to new students
on behalf of the student body.

"Too few people are doing too much
of the work," said Dean Mary Yost in
urging the greater distribution of ac
tivities among the students. "The dis
couraging tiling 111 administration of
student affairs is indifference, not op
position," she declared in making the
plea that all students co-operate with
the leaders in making the coming
year a successful one.
"Failure to study, to learn how to
study, to appreciate the value of
money, are all causes of 'improper in
stallation'," declared Dean Culver in
discussing the freshmen as viewed
from his office.
Robert P. Myers explained the work
of Men's Council as a judiciary body
entirely apart from the executive side
of student government. Miss Mildred
Worsvvick explained why the women
of the University have need of a sepa
rate organization which is known as
Associated Women Students and
which includes the two divisions of
Women's Council and Conference. Miss
Worswick asserted that even though
separately organized, the women are
still loyal student body supporters.
