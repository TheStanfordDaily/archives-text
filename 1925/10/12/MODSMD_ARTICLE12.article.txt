# "HELL-BENT FER HEAVEN" PROVES TRUE MELODRAMA
## Stanford Dramatic Season Opens When Play Given Summer Quarter Is Repeated 
### Isabel Schanck 
Although the melodrama is not the j
highest form of dramatic art., Hatcher
Hughes' "Hell-Bent fer Heaven" has
some inimitable characterizations
which were probably the basis for its
claim to the 1923 Pulitzer prize. Camp
meeting religion, a drunken moun
taineer, an ancient family feud (be
tween the families of the leading man
and woman, of course), and a dyna
mited dam contributed to the situa
tion around which the play was built,
but were not sufficiently realistic to
make a college audience take too seri
ously the pitiful figure of the ignorant
fanatic, Rufe Pryor. |
In this part Gordon Davis, director
of the play, showed his usual aptitude
for characterization, and his versatil
ity in adapting himself to contrasting
roles. Rufe is a very difficult part be
cause it is one with which the audi

of camp-meeting religion which he
represented is so obviously appealing
only to the uneducated that it cannot
be convincing. A revival convert, Rufe

knows his "scripture" enough to quote
assidiously, and to interpret according
to his distorted outlook. The whole
play showed very realistically the ef
fect a half-baked religion can have on
a person who is converted through
emotional appeal. If Davis overplayed
his part a little it was excusable on
the grounds that it is almost impos
sible to sustain such tensity through
out three acts without overdoing.

Daves Well Cast

Delmer Daves, as David Hunt, the
old grandfather whose lifetime of ex
perience has given him a mellowed
security in his philosophy, had the
! best lines in the play. Daves was the
only member of the cast not in the
original summer production of "Hell-
Bent fer Heaven," but he fitted into
his part admirably, and is remembered
for his fine work in a similar role in
"R. U. R." His wise comments fur
nished most of the humor, and he
, represented a temperate attitude to-
I ward religion between the extremes
of Rufe and the women, on the one
