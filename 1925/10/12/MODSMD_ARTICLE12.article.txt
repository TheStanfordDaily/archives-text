# "HELL-BENT FER HEAVEN" PROVES TRUE MELODRAMA
## Stanford Dramatic Season Opens When Play Given Summer Quarter Is Repeated 
### Isabel Schanck 
Although the melodrama is not the j
highest form of dramatic art., Hatcher
Hughes' "Hell-Bent fer Heaven" has
some inimitable characterizations
which were probably the basis for its
claim to the 1923 Pulitzer prize. Camp
meeting religion, a drunken moun
taineer, an ancient family feud (be
tween the families of the leading man
and woman, of course), and a dyna
mited dam contributed to the situa
tion around which the play was built,
but were not sufficiently realistic to
make a college audience take too seri
ously the pitiful figure of the ignorant
fanatic, Rufe Pryor. |
In this part Gordon Davis, director
of the play, showed his usual aptitude
for characterization, and his versatil
ity in adapting himself to contrasting
roles. Rufe is a very difficult part be
cause it is one with which the audi
ence is not sympathetic, and the sort
of camp-meeting religion which he
represented is so obviously appealing
only to the uneducated that it cannot
be convincing. A revival convert, Rufe

knows his "scripture" enough to quote
assidiously, and to interpret according
to his distorted outlook. The whole
play showed very realistically the ef
fect a half-baked religion can have on
a person who is converted through
emotional appeal. If Davis overplayed
his part a little it was excusable on
the grounds that it is almost impos
sible to sustain such tensity through
out three acts without overdoing.

Daves Well Cast

Delmer Daves, as David Hunt, the
old grandfather whose lifetime of ex
perience has given him a mellowed
security in his philosophy, had the
! best lines in the play. Daves was the
only member of the cast not in the
original summer production of "Hell-
Bent fer Heaven," but he fitted into
his part admirably, and is remembered
for his fine work in a similar role in
"R. U. R." His wise comments fur
nished most of the humor, and he
, represented a temperate attitude to-
I ward religion between the extremes
of Rufe and the women, on the one
the second quarter opened, the Cards
gaineu possession ot' the ball in mid
lield. auu then the match started.
Novel's went over right guard for
seven yaids; then he hit the same
hole lor nine more yards. Nevers made
another lirst uown In three bucks.
Bogue carried the ball, but tailed 10
gain. On a delayed buck the Stanford
captain made eigut more yards, and
followed this with seven more over
right guard. The ball rested on the
six-yard line and it took Nevers just
two plays to make the score 13 to 0.

Third Touchdown Solomon's

The third touchdown was Solomon's.
With the aid of Don Hill and Dick
Hyland, and a long pass to Walker, the
ball was on the 20-yard line; then Solo
mon carried the ball six times until
the touchdown was made. The last
score came early in the fourth quar
ter, when Mitchell intercepted an Oc
cidental pass on the 35-yard line. Hill
carried the ball to the one-foot line,
and Solomon again bucked it over.
Murphy converted the first two touch
downs and Hyland added two more
points to the Stanford total in the
second half.
Ted Shipkey was in the lineup Sat
urday despite his recent sickness. Ed
Walker, at the other end, seemed to
be an able working mate ror Shipkey.
Walker's defensive game still needs
some practice, but it was only last
Monday that he was shifted out of the
backfield and into the line. Ward Poul
son's playing at left tackle was one
of the features in the line work. Mugs
Mitchell was in most of the game at
quarterback, and his choice of plays
showed good headwork at all times.
Less fumbling was evident in Satur
day's contest, and only once did the
center pass the ball back so poorly
that the Stanford backfield missed the
hall. There were several fumbles on
punts and kickoffs, but each time the
Stanford man was able to recover.

Although the melodrama is not the j
highest form of dramatic art., Hatcher
Hughes' "Hell-Bent fer Heaven" has
some inimitable characterizations
which were probably the basis for its
claim to the 1923 Pulitzer prize. Camp
meeting religion, a drunken moun
taineer, an ancient family feud (be
tween the families of the leading man
and woman, of course), and a dyna
mited dam contributed to the situa
tion around which the play was built,
but were not sufficiently realistic to
make a college audience take too seri
ously the pitiful figure of the ignorant
fanatic, Rufe Pryor. |
In this part Gordon Davis, director
of the play, showed his usual aptitude
for characterization, and his versatil
ity in adapting himself to contrasting
roles. Rufe is a very difficult part be
cause it is one with which the audi
ence is not sympathetic, and the sort
of camp-meeting religion which he
represented is so obviously appealing
only to the uneducated that it cannot
be convincing. A revival convert, Rufe

knows his "scripture" enough to quote
assidiously, and to interpret according
to his distorted outlook. The whole
play showed very realistically the ef
fect a half-baked religion can have on
a person who is converted through
emotional appeal. If Davis overplayed
his part a little it was excusable on
the grounds that it is almost impos
sible to sustain such tensity through
out three acts without overdoing.

Daves Well Cast

Delmer Daves, as David Hunt, the
old grandfather whose lifetime of ex
perience has given him a mellowed
security in his philosophy, had the
! best lines in the play. Daves was the
only member of the cast not in the
original summer production of "Hell-
Bent fer Heaven," but he fitted into
his part admirably, and is remembered
for his fine work in a similar role in
"R. U. R." His wise comments fur
nished most of the humor, and he
, represented a temperate attitude to-
I ward religion between the extremes
of Rufe and the women, on the one
the second quarter opened, the Cards
gaineu possession ot' the ball in mid
lield. auu then the match started.
Novel's went over right guard for
seven yaids; then he hit the same
hole lor nine more yards. Nevers made
another lirst uown In three bucks.
Bogue carried the ball, but tailed 10
gain. On a delayed buck the Stanford
captain made eigut more yards, and
followed this with seven more over
right guard. The ball rested on the
six-yard line and it took Nevers just
two plays to make the score 13 to 0.

Third Touchdown Solomon's

The third touchdown was Solomon's.
With the aid of Don Hill and Dick
Hyland, and a long pass to Walker, the
ball was on the 20-yard line; then Solo
mon carried the ball six times until
the touchdown was made. The last
score came early in the fourth quar
ter, when Mitchell intercepted an Oc
cidental pass on the 35-yard line. Hill
carried the ball to the one-foot line,
and Solomon again bucked it over.
Murphy converted the first two touch
downs and Hyland added two more
points to the Stanford total in the
second half.
Ted Shipkey was in the lineup Sat
urday despite his recent sickness. Ed
Walker, at the other end, seemed to
be an able working mate ror Shipkey.
Walker's defensive game still needs
some practice, but it was only last
Monday that he was shifted out of the
backfield and into the line. Ward Poul
son's playing at left tackle was one
of the features in the line work. Mugs
Mitchell was in most of the game at
quarterback, and his choice of plays
showed good headwork at all times.
Less fumbling was evident in Satur
day's contest, and only once did the
center pass the ball back so poorly
that the Stanford backfield missed the
hall. There were several fumbles on
punts and kickoffs, but each time the
Stanford man was able to recover.

urday despite his recent sickness. Ed
Walker, at the other end, seemed to
be an able working mate ror Shipkey.
Walker's defensive game still needs
some practice, but it was only last
Monday that he was shifted out of the
backfield and into the line. Ward Poul
son's playing at left tackle was one
of the features in the line work. Mugs
Mitchell was in most of the game at
quarterback, and his choice of plays
showed good headwork at all times.
Less fumbling was evident in Satur
day's contest, and only once did the
center pass the ball back so poorly
that the Stanford backfield missed the
hall. There were several fumbles on
punts and kickoffs, but each time the
Stanford man was able to recover.

Although the melodrama is not the j
highest form of dramatic art., Hatcher
Hughes' "Hell-Bent fer Heaven" has
some inimitable characterizations
which were probably the basis for its
claim to the 1923 Pulitzer prize. Camp
meeting religion, a drunken moun
taineer, an ancient family feud (be
tween the families of the leading man
and woman, of course), and a dyna
mited dam contributed to the situa
tion around which the play was built,
but were not sufficiently realistic to
make a college audience take too seri
ously the pitiful figure of the ignorant
fanatic, Rufe Pryor. |
In this part Gordon Davis, director
of the play, showed his usual aptitude
for characterization, and his versatil
ity in adapting himself to contrasting
roles. Rufe is a very difficult part be
cause it is one with which the audi
ence is not sympathetic, and the sort
of camp-meeting religion which he
represented is so obviously appealing
only to the uneducated that it cannot
be convincing. A revival convert, Rufe

knows his "scripture" enough to quote
assidiously, and to interpret according
to his distorted outlook. The whole
play showed very realistically the ef
fect a half-baked religion can have on
a person who is converted through
emotional appeal. If Davis overplayed
his part a little it was excusable on
the grounds that it is almost impos
sible to sustain such tensity through
out three acts without overdoing.

Daves Well Cast

Delmer Daves, as David Hunt, the
old grandfather whose lifetime of ex
perience has given him a mellowed
security in his philosophy, had the
! best lines in the play. Daves was the
only member of the cast not in the
original summer production of "Hell-
Bent fer Heaven," but he fitted into
his part admirably, and is remembered
for his fine work in a similar role in
"R. U. R." His wise comments fur
nished most of the humor, and he
, represented a temperate attitude to-
I ward religion between the extremes
of Rufe and the women, on the one
the second quarter opened, the Cards
gaineu possession ot' the ball in mid
lield. auu then the match started.
Novel's went over right guard for
seven yaids; then he hit the same
hole lor nine more yards. Nevers made
another lirst uown In three bucks.
Bogue carried the ball, but tailed 10
gain. On a delayed buck the Stanford
captain made eigut more yards, and
followed this with seven more over
right guard. The ball rested on the
six-yard line and it took Nevers just
two plays to make the score 13 to 0.

Third Touchdown Solomon's

The third touchdown was Solomon's.
With the aid of Don Hill and Dick
Hyland, and a long pass to Walker, the
ball was on the 20-yard line; then Solo
mon carried the ball six times until
the touchdown was made. The last
score came early in the fourth quar
ter, when Mitchell intercepted an Oc
cidental pass on the 35-yard line. Hill
carried the ball to the one-foot line,
and Solomon again bucked it over.
Murphy converted the first two touch
downs and Hyland added two more
points to the Stanford total in the
second half.
Ted Shipkey was in the lineup Sat
urday despite his recent sickness. Ed
Walker, at the other end, seemed to
be an able working mate ror Shipkey.
