# CARD SOCCER ELEVEN SCORES 5-3 VICTORY OVER BARBARIANS
## Quick Scoring in Last Half Shows Speedy Offense Of Stanford Team 
### 
Showing considerable improvement
over its performance of last week, the
Stanford soccer team defeated the Bar
barian Club eleven by a score of 5 to
3 in the second game of the year
Saturday.

The score at the end of the first half
was 1 to 0, in favor of the Barbarians.

Stanford had many opportunities to j
score but failed to register.
In the beginning of the second half j
the Stanford men proved their superi- j
ority. Four goals were scored in the j
first five minutes. These were followed :
by two for the Barbarians, one of;
which was made on a penalty kick.
The final score was brought in by the
Cards.
Most of the Cardinals' goals resulted i
from center by Miron. One was made j
by pushing the Barbarian goal-keeper j
through his goal with the ball in his !
hands. Stroeger, Baillard, Quigley, and |
Miron each scored goals.
Next Saturday the Cards play the !
Marin County Club on the ivfarin club's I
home field. Marin will probably offer'
more competition than the Barbarians
gave Saturday.
