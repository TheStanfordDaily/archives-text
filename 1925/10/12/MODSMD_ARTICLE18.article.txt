# STANFORD OUTPLAYS OCCIDENTAL TO WIN FAST CONTEST 28-0
## Nevers, Solomon Account for Two Touchdowns Each; Trojans Next Foe 
### Wilbur Adams 
j By piling up a score of 28 to 0,
Stanford conquered Occidental foot
ball team last Saturday and proved
i themselves to be ready for the Uni
versity of Southern California this
week-end. The Tigers were completely
outplayed, making first downs but
; twice during the whole contest. Stan
j ford made first downs 21 times dur
! ing the course of the afternoon.
It was Andy Kerr's football team
j Saturday, for Pop Warner was in Los
J Angeles looking over the Trojans. The
j Southern school also sent a scout to
j see the Occidental game, but Stanford
, was ready for him. They greeted Cliff
, Herd, assistant coach of U. S. C., with
j the huddle system of calling signals,
| so Cliff returned to his band of Tro
! Jans minus any real information. What
j Cliff Herd did see Saturday was a real
j football team playing one hour of win
j ning football.
During the first half of the Occi
j dental game Ernie Nevers carried the
j ball nineteen times for a gain of an
i even 100 yards, which is an average of
| more than five yards a play. The first
j time that Nevers was given the ball at
j the start of the game was the only
time throughout the half that he was
held at the line of scrimmage. Solomon
j replaced Nevers at fullback during the
' second half, and Solly bucked the
I Tigers' line for fifty-five yards during
j the third and fourth quarters.

Nevers Scores Twice

Stanford scored its twenty-eight
j points at the rate of a touchdown a
I quarter. Nevers and Solomon divided
honors in the scoring of the day, with
i twelve points apiece. But it was Mike
Murphy's 50-vard run in the first period
: that was largely responsible for the
! first touchdown. After Murphy had

! skirted right end for half the length
of the field in the prettiest play of the
j day, Stanford's captain was called
i upon four times in succession to buck
j the line. In the four times that Nevers
j carried the ball he gained the required
, 22 yards, and the opening score of the
day.
The credit of the second touchdown
! goes altogether to Nevers. Soon after
hand, and Sid and Andy, 011 the other.
As Andy Lowry, Phil Urner showed
himself one of the best campus actors
of his type, and made the most of his
opportunity to show his ability when
he is well cast. Through Rufe's influ
ence he tries to begin again the old
feul between the Hunts and the
Lowrys, and might have succeeded
with the aid of Rufe's twenty-year-old
whiskey had Sid not been in love with
his sister, Jude Lowry, and the play
not a melodrama wherein poetic jus
tice holds sway.

Henshall New to Stage

About Wayne Newcomb and Marion
Henshall, as Sid Hunt and Jude
Lowry, centered the love interest. Sid
returns from war to find Jude and his
mother under the influence of Rufe, a
slacker, whom they believe to be the
victim of undeserved reproach from
the men of the family because of his
laziness. Both June Clemens, in the
rol" of ]\leg Hunt, Sid's mother, and
Miss Henshall are newcomers to the
Stanford stage. Miss Henshall made
a charming mountaineer girl,
Miss demons and Guy Holliday, as
Matt Hunt, Sid's father, took the sub
ordinate roles.
The first act dragged a little but,
with the advent of a storm, action be
came more dramatic. The work o!
Richard Fullerton of the technical
staff, who was responsible for the
wonderful lighting effects, had much
to do with the success of the produc
tion. The gradual approach of the
storm with the accompanying darkness
was done very effectively. The cabin
interior, designed by Leslie Kiler,
served for the scene of the entire
play, and looked properly stained with
age.
