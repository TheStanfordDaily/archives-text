### Wilbur Adams 
j By piling up a score of 28 to 0,
Stanford conquered Occidental foot
ball team last Saturday and proved
i themselves to be ready for the Uni
versity of Southern California this
week-end. The Tigers were completely
outplayed, making first downs but
; twice during the whole contest. Stan
j ford made first downs 21 times dur
! ing the course of the afternoon.
It was Andy Kerr's football team
j Saturday, for Pop Warner was in Los
J Angeles looking over the Trojans. The
j Southern school also sent a scout to
j see the Occidental game, but Stanford
, was ready for him. They greeted Cliff
, Herd, assistant coach of U. S. C., with
j the huddle system of calling signals,
| so Cliff returned to his band of Tro
! Jans minus any real information. What
j Cliff Herd did see Saturday was a real
j football team playing one hour of win
j ning football.
During the first half of the Occi
j dental game Ernie Nevers carried the
j ball nineteen times for a gain of an
i even 100 yards, which is an average of
| more than five yards a play. The first
j time that Nevers was given the ball at
j the start of the game was the only
time throughout the half that he was
held at the line of scrimmage. Solomon
j replaced Nevers at fullback during the
' second half, and Solly bucked the
I Tigers' line for fifty-five yards during
j the third and fourth quarters.

Nevers Scores Twice

Stanford scored its twenty-eight
j points at the rate of a touchdown a
I quarter. Nevers and Solomon divided
honors in the scoring of the day, with
i twelve points apiece. But it was Mike
Murphy's 50-vard run in the first period
: that was largely responsible for the
! first touchdown. After Murphy had

! skirted right end for half the length
of the field in the prettiest play of the
j day, Stanford's captain was called
i upon four times in succession to buck
j the line. In the four times that Nevers
j carried the ball he gained the required
, 22 yards, and the opening score of the
day.
The credit of the second touchdown
! goes altogether to Nevers. Soon after
