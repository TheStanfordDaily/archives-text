# CARDINALS STAR IN PALO ALTO TENNIS DOUBLES TOURNEY
## 
### 
Semi-finals of the invitational tennis
doubles tournament were held yester
day on the courts of the Peninsular
Club. A1 Herrington, Gomer Thomas,
Phil Neer, and Ford Tussing are the
Stanford men who competed in the
tournament.
A1 Herrington, captain and first man
on last year's freshman team, is at
present holder of a Los Angeles city
title, which he won this summer.
Gomer Thomas and Joe Castellanos
were also members of last year's fresh
man team.
Tussing and Neer are former Stan
ford block "S" men. Phil Neer held
the nationaMntercollegiate tennis title
in '21.
Playing a splendid game in the fea
ture match of the day, Neer and Lans
dale of Palo Alto, defeated Herrington
and Thomas 8-6, 6-4. Sensational play
ing by Neer, which demonstrated that
he has lost none of his former ac
curacy and speed, enabled the more
seasoned players to carry the match.
Herrington and Thomas, although rag
ged in spots, played fine tennis for an
early-season match.
In the other semi-final bracket, Cas
tellanos and Jerry Smith of Palo Alto
dropped a hotly-contested match to
Tussing and Plvmire, a Palo Alto high
school boy, 61-, 4-6, 8-6.
Cranston Holman, first man on the
Stanford varsity and holder of the na
tional junior title for '25, played in an
exhibition match with some local
racquet-wielders, but was unable to
participate in the tournament because
of a previous engagement.
In the finals, which will probably be
held next Saturday, Tussing and Ply
mire will play Neer and Lansdale for
the cup which has been donated by
Nielsen & Culver, Palo Alto jewelers,
for the winning team.
