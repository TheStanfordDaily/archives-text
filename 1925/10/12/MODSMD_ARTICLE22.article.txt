# The 						Tumbling Bear

### 
On October 1 the statement was made in this column that Stanford
would defeat California in the Big Game this year. Nine-tenths of the
people who read that opinion got a huge laugh out of it and strengthened
their idea that the Daily Palo Alto is usually wrong.
'During the past few years it has been frequently said that with the
first defeat California's ten-thousand-odd rooting section would crumble
and fall, meaning of course that the football team was the medium for
retaining school spirit at that institution. Now that Andy Smith has
tasted defeat many of us will be watching expectantly for the fulfillment
of the prophecy. And if the rooting section loses heart, it's goodbye
California championships.
The Daily Palo Alto expresses pleasure that it was the Olympic
Club which won the honor of handing the Bears their first defeat in
almost six years. Norman Cleaveland, Harry Shipkey, "Scotchy"
Campbell, Jack Patrick, and the other Stanford graduates on the club
eleven have it coming to them. All of them gave their best to humble
the Bear while they were at Stanford, and none of them succeeded. They
should feel immense satisfaction in their belated victory over the old-time
rival of their Alma Mater.

Cardinal stock has taken a sudden rise after the Blue and Gold defeat
until now it is almost an impossibility to place money on the game at
even odds—should anyone be sinful enough to wager good cold cash
on a football game. Now that it no longer seems an impossibility to
stop the Golden Bear we see no reason why Pacific Coast Conference
teams should not begin doing it regularly. Tilly will be able to enter
the fray with a mental advantage, where before California forced the
other teams to overcome a great psychological handicap.
At the same time, Saturday, Stanford warmed the hearts of even the
most skeptical by downing Occidental 28 to 0 and by displaying machine
like precision in the execution of all its plays. At the picnic held in honor
of the freshman football players the Sunday before registration "Pop"
Warner said that Stanford and the Olympic Club would be on a par by
October 10. If this is true, Stanford and the Olympic Club should be
able to fight it out on equal terms should the teams clash today. The
Olympic Club was probably fighting considerably harder against Cali
fornia than it was against Stanford, but this could not possibly have
meant more than two touchdowns, and so if "Pop's'' supposition is
correct, Stanford should have a slight edge over California even at the
present time.
Stanford has improved, as promised, with each succeeding game, and
rooters have a right to expect that this will continue. One of the ends
looked weak Saturday, but with that exception every man on the squad
acted* like a veteran. U. S. C.is very likely to have a surprise next
week, and if "Pop" manages to strengthen the wing positions until they
are on a par with the rest of the team, the Trojans are not even going to
come near making a score. And then it will lie time for California to
watch out. The highly touted Golden Bear is getting ready for a tumble.

Campbell, Jack Patrick, and the other Stanford graduates on the club
eleven have it coming to them. All of them gave their best to humble
the Bear while they were at Stanford, and none of them succeeded. They
should feel immense satisfaction in their belated victory over the old-time
rival of their Alma Mater.

Cardinal stock has taken a sudden rise after the Blue and Gold defeat
until now it is almost an impossibility to place money on the game at
even odds—should anyone be sinful enough to wager good cold cash
on a football game. Now that it no longer seems an impossibility to
stop the Golden Bear we see no reason why Pacific Coast Conference
teams should not begin doing it regularly. Tilly will be able to enter
the fray with a mental advantage, where before California forced the
other teams to overcome a great psychological handicap.
At the same time, Saturday, Stanford warmed the hearts of even the
most skeptical by downing Occidental 28 to 0 and by displaying machine
like precision in the execution of all its plays. At the picnic held in honor
of the freshman football players the Sunday before registration "Pop"
Warner said that Stanford and the Olympic Club would be on a par by
October 10. If this is true, Stanford and the Olympic Club should be
able to fight it out on equal terms should the teams clash today. The
Olympic Club was probably fighting considerably harder against Cali
fornia than it was against Stanford, but this could not possibly have
meant more than two touchdowns, and so if "Pop's'' supposition is
correct, Stanford should have a slight edge over California even at the
present time.
Stanford has improved, as promised, with each succeeding game, and
rooters have a right to expect that this will continue. One of the ends
looked weak Saturday, but with that exception every man on the squad
acted* like a veteran. U. S. C.is very likely to have a surprise next
week, and if "Pop" manages to strengthen the wing positions until they
are on a par with the rest of the team, the Trojans are not even going to
come near making a score. And then it will lie time for California to
watch out. The highly touted Golden Bear is getting ready for a tumble.
On October 1 the statement was made in this column that Stanford
would defeat California in the Big Game this year. Nine-tenths of the
people who read that opinion got a huge laugh out of it and strengthened
their idea that the Daily Palo Alto is usually wrong.
'During the past few years it has been frequently said that with the
first defeat California's ten-thousand-odd rooting section would crumble
and fall, meaning of course that the football team was the medium for
retaining school spirit at that institution. Now that Andy Smith has
tasted defeat many of us will be watching expectantly for the fulfillment
of the prophecy. And if the rooting section loses heart, it's goodbye
California championships.
The Daily Palo Alto expresses pleasure that it was the Olympic
Club which won the honor of handing the Bears their first defeat in
almost six years. Norman Cleaveland, Harry Shipkey, "Scotchy"
Campbell, Jack Patrick, and the other Stanford graduates on the club
eleven have it coming to them. All of them gave their best to humble
the Bear while they were at Stanford, and none of them succeeded. They
