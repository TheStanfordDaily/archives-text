# Upperclassman Interest
## 
### 
Saturday morning l the Rally Committee spent a good deal of time
marking out an "S" in the rooting section in preparation for the Occi
dental contest. How well the effort was rewarded was observed by all
who attended the game.
The stunts had been blocked off in an area suited for 900 men with
rooters' caps, less than 50 per cent of the total undergraduate male
enrollment. A fair estimate would be that 450 men came to the game
with hats. More than 450 additional undergraduates, enough to fill the
section, were present at the game, but were without rooters' caps.
Disgustingly, the majority of the uncapped men wore cords, while
only a few dinks were in evidence. Had the whole freshman class been
minus rooters's caps, it would have been excused on the grounds of
ignorance. However, the upperclassmen's indifference is unpardonable.
One hundred and fifty dates a year with one hundred and fifty different
■women is the aim of a club recently organized by the men of the University
of Michigan. A man is eligible for membership only after he has been seen by
all the members in the company of a good-looking girl, and ho must give her
name and address upon initiation. These boys certainly believe that variety
is the spice of life —but let them read Kipling's well-known poem and learn
about women from him.
Only 575 rooters' tickets had been sold at the end of the two-day sale last
week. Unless 325 rooters are obtained from some source, as yet unknown,
Stanford will not have an organized rooting section at the U. S. C. game. It
will be unfortunate if the yell leaders are forced to hire outside men and
former students living in Los Angeles to fill the cheer section in the Coliseum.
A fat man once said that the reason he managed to accomplish things was
this: he made the initial effort of getting out of his chair, and then it was
easy to finish the job. If we replace the fat man with ourselves and his
getting out of an easy chair with our getting into campus activities, by all
geometric principles, the results should be the same.
There are always two ways of looking at things even if you aren't cross
eyed.
