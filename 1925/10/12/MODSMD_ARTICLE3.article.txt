# Mining Engineer Talks on Scientific Prospecting
## 
### 
Augustus Locke, mining engineer of
San Francisco, spoke on scientific pros
pecting this morning to the class in
Mining 211.
Locke has developed a special meth
od of prospecting by which it is pos
sible from a study of the chemical
and physical properties and geological
relations of the rocks on the surface
of the ground to predict quite accurate
ly the value and extent of ore beneath
the surface. His method has been ap
plied with considerable success in the
copper fields of the Southwest.
