# "Dodson's Hints on Musical Hits"
## 
### 
"Freshie," played by Waring's Penn
sylvanians exclusively for Victor rec
ords. is the successor to "Collegiate,"
which owes fame to the same inimita
ble orchestra.
Stanford frosh can learn some good
lessons from "Freshie" and Stanford
sophomores can learn how their pre
decessors of several student genera
tions ago taught those lessons.
You'll like the record. "Mighty
Blue." on the other side, is a worthy
companion.
Aileen Stanley sings "Want a Little
Lovin' " and "You're in Wrong with
the Right Baby." Both songs are
"blues 1 ' of the highest order sung by
an artist of the same rank.
Paul Whiteman's newest record,
"The Farmer Took Another Load
Away! Hay! Hay!" and "Manhattan,"
is distinctly disappointing. But we all
fall down on the job once in a while
and Whiteman's Orchestra is composed
of human beings.

We still have some mighty attrac
tive buys in cheap used phonographs
which will bring you many an hour of
joy during your college years.
Prices begin at $7.50 with terms!
Come in tomorrow morning and pick
yours out.
