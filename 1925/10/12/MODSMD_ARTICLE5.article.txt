# FRESHMAN ELEVEN DEFEATS U. S. ARMY BY 14 TO 0 SCORE
## Launch Fast Offensive in First Half; Alameda High Beaten 28 to 7 
### Frank Baker 
With steam roller tactics the fresh
men defeated the U. S. Army team 14
to Oi in the preliminary football game
Saturday afternoon. Wilton, Sims, and
Smalling, frosh stars, broke the Army
line to pieces during the first half, and
the soldiers were never able to launch
a successful attack thereafter. In the
morning, the second yearling squad
beat Alameda High 28 to 7 in a poorly
played game. Fumbles and penalties
made the game slow.

Most observers' of Coach Hunt's
team have figured that he had only
one set of backs, but the play yester
day proved that this is not the case.
When the substitutes went in, the
game continued in nearly as good a
manner as when the first set were
tearing their way down the field. To
offset the shortness of the kicking the
ends got down under the punts and
nabbed their man with great ease.
The high points in the game oc
curred when Wilton ran back a kickoff
40 yards through a broken field, and
several long gains around end by Sims.
Marks, substituting for Wilton, being
unable to kick, ran four yards from
behind the goal, showing both speed
and shiftiness.

Alameda High and the second squad
played an extremely erratic game in
the morning. Two weeks ago it looked
as if, the yearling Grays were quite
masters of the rudimentary rules, but
Saturday they did about everything
wrong that is possible. Fumbles and
penalties of all sorts were scattered
throughout the game.
The score of 28 to 0 was much better
than last year, when Alameda High
triumphed by one touchdown in the
last two minutes of play.
