# OLYMPIC CLUB WINS FROM CALIFORNIA BY SCORE OF 15 TO 0
## 
### 
The University of California foot
ball team was knocked from its pedes
tal Saturday by the Olympic Club of
San Francisco, falling to the tune of
15 to 0. Not since 1919, when Washing
ton defeated the Bears 7 to 0, has Cali
fornia been beaten by any team in the
country, and the number of times that
the Berkeley aggregation has been tied
can be counted on the fingers of one
hand!
Seven ex-Stanford players were in
Olympic Club suits, and it seemed al
most like a game between Stanford
and California. The red and white out
fits of the clubmen made the illusion
even more realistic. "Come on, Stan
ford," was the yell of the Olympic Club
supporters.
Harry Shipkey, Stanford's tackle for
the last three years, broke through the
California line to block Dixon's kick
in the second quarter. Daly was there
to fall on the ball, and California went
into a hole that it never got out of.
Cleaveland, ruled out of the Big
Game the night before the battle last
year, got some sweet revenge Satur
day. His long punts aided materially
in downing the Bruins.
