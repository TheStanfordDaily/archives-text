# FRATERNITY COUNCIL ELECTS M'DERMOTT, POULSON TO BOARD
## FRYE NAMED DELEGATE Suggestions for Revision of Present Rush Rules Are Submitted 
### 
Wardle Poulson and Gilbert McDer
mott were elected to the Interfrater
nity Board of Control at the meeting
of the Interfraternity Council last
night. These two men, together with
Clarence M. Fraziler, Dave Graves,
Homer Oatman, secretary, and Frank
Frye, chairman, will make up the board
for the coming quarter.
Frank Frye, president of the Inter
fraternity Council, was selected to
represent the Stanford Conference at
the National Interfraternity Council.
Frye plans to leave for New York City
early in December.
Suggestions upon the revision of
Spring Quarter rushing rules were pre
sented at the meeting and may inaugu
rate new changes in the present sys
tem. Rushing may start two weeks
earlier than before, if a suggestion
that was well received should pass.
This suggestion calls for rushing to
commence immediately after the Stan
ford-California meet and continue but
two and one-half weeks instead of the
former three weeks. The system will
enable all rushing to be completed
some time before finals and save all
concerned from heavy last-minute
cramming.
