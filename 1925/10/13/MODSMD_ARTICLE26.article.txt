# CARD-TROJAN TILT CALLED "BIG GAME" OF YEAR IN SOUTH

Stanford plays University of South
: ern California this week-end in what
!is considered the Big Game of the
i Southland. No other contest that is
j to be played in Los Angeles this year
will draw the crowd or attract the in
i terest that the Card-Trojan battle will,
i Since September 15 Howard Jones has
! been aiming his varsity at Stanford,
j and Saturday will tell how good a
j shot the new Trojan coach really is.
U. S. C. defeated the University of
! Utah 28 to 2, but this act, in itself,
is not so noteworthy, for Stanford
| conquered Utah last year 30 to 0 in
1 a pouring rain. Not once during the
jU. S. C.-Utah game, Saturday, was
I the Trojan's backfield men able to
break away for the long runs that
were so characteristic in the three
other games that U. S. C. has played
this year, and the Utah line was not
! outplayed. Pop Warner's presence in
the Coliseum may have had something
to do with the slump taken by the
; Southern warriors last week-end. At
j any rate Jones was not pointing at
| Utah, and the game was played merely
| because it was on the schedule.
The Southern California aggregation
: has not been bragging much about
: their line this year for some reason.
T- -»y do claim to have a clever end in
| riobbs Adams, and compare him to
| Ted Shipkey for ability. One Southern
I paper says: "Hobbs is one of the
' greatest ends ever to play at U. S. C.
j and at present ranks with Ted Ship
key of Stanford as the best wingman
| on the coast." But Adams has been
j suffering with pleurisy, and may not be
playing up to form next Saturday. In
recent games he has been the acting
captain. A1 Behrendt, star tackle, has
been injured to some extent, and
Cruickshank has been substituted for
| him. Taylor and Gorrell are the guards
; that hope to stop Nevers' linebucks.
! Taylor is the colored streak who is
able to run the 100-yard dash in 10
1 seconds flat handicapped with but one
; hand.
; The Trojan's real strength lies in
Aubrey Devine's backfield. The four
j that have been starting the prelimi
i nary contest are Morton Kaer at quar
! ter, Bob Lee at fullback, and Raymond
Earle and Morley Drury at halfbacks.
They are the ones that have run up
205 points in the first four games of
the 1925 season. These four stars are
backed up by an abundance of substi
tutes, among whom are Elliott, Laran
etta, and Cook —plenty good enough
men for the first string on any varsity
on the coast.
The whole of the Stanford squad
will be taken on the trip to Los An
geles. The thirty-nine men leave Palo
Alto Thursday night on the Lark.
