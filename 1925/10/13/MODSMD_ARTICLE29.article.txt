# Intramural Athletics

### 
Stanford has a well developed and efficient system of interclass and
intramural athletics, which goes to make the theory of universal partici
pation almost an actual fact and not a mere pipe dream. More than
fifty per cent of the able-bodied men students of the University are given
the opportunity to engage in some sort of competitive sport during" the
year through the workings of this system.
Charles W. Davis, director of intramural sports, has announced that
in addition to the perpetual all-round class trophy now being given, a
special prize will be awarded the living group winning the greatest
number of points in all sports on the intramural program. This should
help in stimulating interest among all living organizations.
The intramural plan is devised to give the most men the maximum of
benefit from some form of actual competition. Those not proficient
enough to make a varsity team can play interclass, and those not good
enoungh for interclass will have an opportunity on intramural teams —
and there is no limit to the number of intramural teams that can be
entered. Exercise is essential, but it is made more valuable when there'
is also a competitive stimulus.
No one should hesitate to engage in some sort of intramural sport.
Lack of great ability is no excuse, for each man has a chance to compete
regardless of ability, and there is a form of sport for everyone. If the
individual desire is absent it can be accentuated by striving to help your
living group win.
The first call has been made by the interclass managers for players to
compete in the class football series. This merits the support of everyone
who has had football experience or who has the necessary size and
.weight.
