# A 						Point System for Women
## 
### 
The Women's Council, acting" as a representative body for the Asso
ciated Women Students, has drawn up two tentative point systems, both
providing means for limiting af woman's participation in outside activities.
The point system is undoubtedly the answer to an urgent need for some
redistribution of the burdens and the honors now monopolized by a few.
The Daily Palo Alto hopes that one of the plans is accepted.
The purpose of the point system is stated by the Women's Council in
the following language:
"The point system is not a means of giving honorable recognition to
students for activities, and it is not a means of rewarding merit. It is a
system devised to prevent a small group of women from being over
burdened with activities by distributing the offices and committee work
more evenly among the women."
By restricting the number of University activities in which one person
may take parti the tentative point systems aim to benefit the organizations
by assuring concentrated effort rather than haphazard, scattered work
by overworked individuals. The proposed systems, imperfect as they
may be, will spread the campus honors among many and will protect
prominent individuals by forbidding them to accept too much work, and
thereby endanger their studies and health.
Both point systems will be discussed through the "Campus Opinion"
column. If either of them can be accepted without amendment such a
course should be taken. No matter what happens, women should give
serious thought to the subject before the assembly on October 19.
