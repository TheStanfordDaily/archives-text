# Reprinting College Humor
## 
### 
Efforts are now being made by the Midwest College Association to
prevent reprinting of material from college humorous publications in
the sensational and salacious magazines which infest news-stands. 1 his
is a worthy effort and one which Hammer and Coffin Society should do
well to duplicate. It was also strongly advocated at the Intercollegiate
Conference held at Cornell last spring.
The use of college humor and the spread of college customs and ideas
to various classes of morons has made it impossible for an informed
person to use the adjective "collegiate" in reference to anything con
nected with an educational institution above the grade of a half-rate
high school, and this is more than a little bit due to the reprinting of
material from college publications in all sorts of scatterbrain magazines
and newspapers. Reprinting of this matter in worthy publications is not
only to be allowed but should be encouraged. Its reprinting and altera
tion in second-rate and worse magazines should be opposed by every
college student and every college organization, particularly since many
of these publications print much which parades as a college product
but which is not.
The University of California is to be congratulated upon the splendid
attention it is paying to Captain Gutteron of the University of Nevada football
team. Gutteron suffered a broken leg when he was tackled in the California-
Nevada game after he had broken through the California defense and seemed
on his way to a certain touchdown.
The little Nevada captain was taken to the California infirmary where he
was put under competent medical care. He was also taken in a wheel chair
to witness the California-Olympic Club game. When he was carried to the
sidelines Saturday he was given a tremendous ovation by the packed California
stands.
