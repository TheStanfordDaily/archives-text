TULARE, CALIF., Oct. 10 (By Disso- i
dated Press)—"Per Gawd's sake, how,
should I know?" cried Ray Law, ono- j
time bon vivant, now tule reporter, l
when questioned by a Dissociated
Press man as to the outcome of the'
present football season. Slowly stretch
ing himself from his bed behind the
Hies and lifting his head from the of
fice brass vessel of uncleanliness, he
ordered the reporter out. He then!
made the following statement:
"I am convinced that the Big Ten
will come out either two fives, or a ;
six and a four. With only one addition
it would probably be one of the most
perfect elevens in the country. As to
the Big Three, my choice is Ring
'Lardner, H. C. Whitwer, and Irvin'
Cobb.
Predicts Coast Outcome
"As the weather reports read fair
and warmer, there will probably be
several hot games on the coast this
year. The writer would like very much
to see Pop Warner and Andy Smith
locked in a room, armed with cutlasses,
to fight the matter out. The writer is
sure that under such conditions the
situation would assume a distinctly
RED tinge.
* * #
Those who wish seats for the next
play" closer than the last ten rows
should begin standing in line immedi
ately.
At the next play, a detective will be
placed 011 the trail of any student
found sitting in the central section of
the Assembly Hall.
♦ * *
After watching the recent mud fight
and pondering on the question for al
; most a whole week, Cabbages has de
cided that mud is thicker than water.
♦ * *
, We believe that in the long run it
! would be more profitable for the dra
matic managers to make all the tickets
complimentary.
♦ * *
Knowing Andy Smith's capacity for
water, we wonder if San Francisco
Bay was still intact 011 Sunday morn
ing last.
* * *
Cabbages notes that a new course
I whose central problem is that of meas
j uring the probability of statistical in
ferences is being given this quarter.
For example, if statistics showed that
the average girl buys three new hair
nets each week, the course might be
crowded by those wishing to learn the
probability of the natural inference.
Unless, of course, the experimental
method had already been applied.

crowded by those wishing to learn the
probability of the natural inference.
Unless, of course, the experimental
method had already been applied.
BON VIVANT PREDICTS HOT
WEATHER
TULARE, CALIF., Oct. 10 (By Disso- i
dated Press)—"Per Gawd's sake, how,
should I know?" cried Ray Law, ono- j
time bon vivant, now tule reporter, l
when questioned by a Dissociated
Press man as to the outcome of the'
present football season. Slowly stretch
ing himself from his bed behind the
Hies and lifting his head from the of
fice brass vessel of uncleanliness, he
ordered the reporter out. He then!
made the following statement:
"I am convinced that the Big Ten
will come out either two fives, or a ;
six and a four. With only one addition
it would probably be one of the most
perfect elevens in the country. As to
the Big Three, my choice is Ring
'Lardner, H. C. Whitwer, and Irvin'
Cobb.
Predicts Coast Outcome
"As the weather reports read fair
and warmer, there will probably be
several hot games on the coast this
year. The writer would like very much
to see Pop Warner and Andy Smith
locked in a room, armed with cutlasses,
to fight the matter out. The writer is
sure that under such conditions the
situation would assume a distinctly
RED tinge.

Those who wish seats for the next
play" closer than the last ten rows
should begin standing in line immedi
ately.
At the next play, a detective will be
placed 011 the trail of any student
found sitting in the central section of
the Assembly Hall.

After watching the recent mud fight
and pondering on the question for al
; most a whole week, Cabbages has de
cided that mud is thicker than water.

, We believe that in the long run it
! would be more profitable for the dra
matic managers to make all the tickets
complimentary.

Knowing Andy Smith's capacity for
water, we wonder if San Francisco
Bay was still intact 011 Sunday morn
ing last.

Cabbages notes that a new course
I whose central problem is that of meas
j uring the probability of statistical in
ferences is being given this quarter.
