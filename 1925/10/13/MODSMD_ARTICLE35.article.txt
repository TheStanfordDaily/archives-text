# CAMPUS OPINION

### 
The Editor, Sir —
Having read the two point systems
published Monday, I hereby desire to 1
submit my strenuous objections.
In the first place, 1 do not think the
point system is necessary. Stanford
women, it seems to me, have ample
opportunity to participate in activities,
and very few of them fail to take ad
vantage of it. Women are prominent
ill Stanford dramatics, debate, student
government, and journalism. In addi
tion, they have their own athletics,
and their own self-government institu
tions.
We have at present women serving j
in two or more offices in such a way,
as the point system forbids. I do not
believe the activities concerned have
suffered. On the contrary, I think the
activities have gained by having some
one especially fitted for the type of
work. That can be achieved only by I
permitting women to compete for of-'
fices regardless of other positions they |
may hold.
Stanford women are "a picked
bunch." I firmly believe every one of
them will go out for activities without
artificial stimulus, and that every
of them is capable of recognizing the
limit of work she can carry and still
do her best in each field.
Respectfully yours,
A Woman Student.
The Sir —
Why are the girls at Stanford so
snobbish? There are quite a few other
transfer students besides myself that
would be interested in the answer to
this question.
Girls in the classroom do not hesi
tate to speak to you when they are in
doubt about some phase of the class
room work. Meeting the same girls a
| few minutes after the class has been
| dismissed one is struck by the degree
lin which they turn up their noses
| when you nod to them in a friendly
! way. Why is it?
I have run across some forms of
I snobbery at Harvard but the girls at
I Stanford make some of the Harvard
| snobs look like amateurs.

as the point system forbids. I do not
believe the activities concerned have
suffered. On the contrary, I think the
activities have gained by having some
one especially fitted for the type of
work. That can be achieved only by I
permitting women to compete for of-'
fices regardless of other positions they |
may hold.
Stanford women are "a picked
bunch." I firmly believe every one of
them will go out for activities without
artificial stimulus, and that every
of them is capable of recognizing the
limit of work she can carry and still
do her best in each field.
Respectfully yours,
A Woman Student.
The Sir —
Why are the girls at Stanford so
snobbish? There are quite a few other
transfer students besides myself that
would be interested in the answer to
this question.
Girls in the classroom do not hesi
tate to speak to you when they are in
doubt about some phase of the class
room work. Meeting the same girls a
| few minutes after the class has been
| dismissed one is struck by the degree
lin which they turn up their noses
| when you nod to them in a friendly
! way. Why is it?
I have run across some forms of
I snobbery at Harvard but the girls at
I Stanford make some of the Harvard
| snobs look like amateurs.
