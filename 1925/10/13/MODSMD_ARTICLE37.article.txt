# ALVARADO ROW IS SITE OF FIRST TEN HOUSES ON CAMPUS
## Earliest Campus Residents Known to Community as "Tramp Perfessers" 
### 
The word "Row" today suggests to
the mind a long paved street overhung
by green trees and bordered by well
kept lawns. Thirty-four years ago,
what then was known as the How con
sisted of ten wooden houses standing
in the middle of a stubble field. The
occupants of these modest dwellings
were the first fifteen members of the
Stanford faculty.
In front of these houses was a board
walk consisting of two rows of planks
laid side by side. The street which
was named Alvarado Row was a com
bination of ruts, dust, and hummocks
which after the rain turned to a lake
of sticky adobe mud. Not a single vine,
shrub, tree, or patch of lawn relieved
the bareness of the line of houses.
Across the expanse of stubble stood
Encina hall, looking equally desolate.
Before these ten houses were built
Escondite cottage, the home of the
President, was the only dwelling on
the campus. Palo Alto was a mere
group of houses, and Mayfield and
Menlo were not much larger. Frater
nity and sorority houses had not yet
been built. The row of ten professors'
cottages was named the "Decalogue"
by the students.
The first members of the faculty
contended with great inconveniences.
Many of them during the first weeks
of the University slept on the parlor
floors of their houses. Almost every
thing had to be bought in San Fran
cisco. Nothing except "flour and pins"
could be bought in Mayfield. Water
had to be carried in pails to the houses
from a water tank at the end of the
Row. Wood was quite scarce and can
dles were the only source of illumina
tion before the coming of the electric
lights. Carriages were quite scarce.
Because the professors walked almost
everywhere they soon became known
by the native population as the
"tramp perfessers."
Although several fraternities and
sororities soon became established in
houses in Palo Alto and Mayfield, none
moved to the campus until the spring
of 1892. In that year a fraternity moved
into what was later known as Madrona
hall, and which was also a residence
for bachelor professors. Houses were
not built on Lasuen street, the present
day Row, until several years after the
founding of the University.

laid side by side. The street which
was named Alvarado Row was a com
bination of ruts, dust, and hummocks
which after the rain turned to a lake
of sticky adobe mud. Not a single vine,
shrub, tree, or patch of lawn relieved
the bareness of the line of houses.
Across the expanse of stubble stood
Encina hall, looking equally desolate.
Before these ten houses were built
Escondite cottage, the home of the
President, was the only dwelling on
the campus. Palo Alto was a mere
group of houses, and Mayfield and
Menlo were not much larger. Frater
nity and sorority houses had not yet
been built. The row of ten professors'
cottages was named the "Decalogue"
by the students.
The first members of the faculty
contended with great inconveniences.
Many of them during the first weeks
of the University slept on the parlor
floors of their houses. Almost every
thing had to be bought in San Fran
cisco. Nothing except "flour and pins"
could be bought in Mayfield. Water
had to be carried in pails to the houses
from a water tank at the end of the
Row. Wood was quite scarce and can
dles were the only source of illumina
tion before the coming of the electric
lights. Carriages were quite scarce.
Because the professors walked almost
everywhere they soon became known
by the native population as the
"tramp perfessers."
Although several fraternities and
sororities soon became established in
houses in Palo Alto and Mayfield, none
moved to the campus until the spring
of 1892. In that year a fraternity moved
into what was later known as Madrona
hall, and which was also a residence
for bachelor professors. Houses were
not built on Lasuen street, the present
day Row, until several years after the
founding of the University.
