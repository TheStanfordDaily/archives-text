"Yokohama lias made practically no
progress toward reconstruction, and
at the present time has practically no
modern buildings," according to Profes
sor Y. lehihashi, the principal speaker
at a meeting of the Cosmopolitan Club
last night in the Women's Clubhouse.
Professor Ichihashi's talk was based
on impressions gained through a two
months' visit to Japan this summer,
and pictured the existing economic and
political conditions. •
"Japan has been suffering for the
past two or three years from a general
feeling of unrest and depression," he
stated. "Unemployment exists not only
among the day laborers, but also
among the salaried workers, and
everyone lives constantly with anxiety
and uncertainty. The cost of living ex
ceeds even that of the United States.
There is a decided tendency"in Japan
toward democratization, and the exist
ing bureaucratic system is slowly be
ing revised. Already there is universal
suffrage among men in Japan."
Professor lehihashi expressed no
hope for an improvement in the eco
nomic conditions in the near future.
Extensive restoration from the recent
devastating earthquake and (ire can
not be hoped for within the next two

years. There has been, however, a de
cided cultural advance among the
Japanese, especially along musical
lines. The democratic tendency which
has become so manifest all over Japan
is also affecting the cultural life.
