Even as the early Christians sought
refuge in the catacombs on the Appian
Way near Rome, so have the research
workers in the Physics and Physiology
departments at Stanford taken to an
underground passage as a place in
which to carry on their labors.
The Stanford catacombs, so called
because of their structural •'resem
blance to the historic catacombs, make
up the concrete foundation of the outer
Quadrangle. Prior to the present time,
this large underground passage has
been unused, but in the need for more
research laboratories it is being fitted
up for this purpose.
The whole room was originally about
150 feet long but it has now been par
titioned off into several small rooms.
The University of Oklahoma is build
ing a radio station which will cost
$15,000.
