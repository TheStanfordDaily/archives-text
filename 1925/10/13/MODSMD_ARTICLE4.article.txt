# CROSS-COUNTRY TEAM HOLDS FIRST WORKOUT
## 
### 
Thirteen candidates for the varsity
cross-country team turned out yester
day for the first workout of the season.
This turnout is larger than the aver
age, but there are fewer experienced
men than last year.
Captain Bill Kerr is the only letter
man on the squad, but Raney, Nelson,
and Collins, of last year's freshman
team, are expected to add to the
strength of the team.
Definite date for the meet with Cali
fornia has not yet been set, but will
probably be the Wednesday before
Thanksgiving Day. Tbe Cardinal team
has defeated California for the past
four years in this sport.
