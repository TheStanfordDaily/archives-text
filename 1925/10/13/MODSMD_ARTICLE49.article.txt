diving.
Wallace O'Connor and Colin Smith,
two of the most capable swimmers
now here, will be ineligible to com
pete in these P. A. events. Both have
competed in Southern California dur
ing the summer and are registered in
the Southern Pacific Association dis
trict. Transfering from one district
to another is prohibited in less than

j three months. With the eligible ma
terial, however, Stanford should be
able to garner several of the best
j places.
Arden Allen in the backstroke and
breaststroke races looks good for at
least one, possibly two, firsts.
Carl Stevenson should have little or
no trouble in winning the 500-yard
j event. Van den Akker may also be en
tered in this race.
For the medley it will be necessary
to have someone who can dive fairly
; well in addition to swimming. Pos
j sible entries for this are Bob Williams
and Ted Smith.
The final meet containing the 50- and
100-yard free styles, high springboard
.diving, and the 400-yard relay has
been awarded to the new Athens Club
in Oakland and will be held by them
November 6. The Athens Club has an
| excellent 36x100-foot tank on the fifth
i story of its club building.
With the Olympic Club now leading
Stanford by one point the final events
of the Pacific Association swimming
season will be awaited with interest
by aquatic fans. Eight events remain
to be finished in two meets, one on
the Farm and one at the Athens Club
in Oakland. The score now stands:
Olympic Club 22, Stanford 21, as a
result of the meet at the Club last
week when the Winged "O" swimmers
raised their point total from 4 to 22
while Stanford's men, handicapped by
lack of training went from 14 to 22.

ming coach, plans to hold a meet in
the Encina pool on October 31. The
P. A. events for this meet will be
220-yard breastsroke, 150-yard back
stroke, 500-yard free style, and the

which tests a swimmer's ability to the
utmost. It consists of the 100- and 500-
yard free style, the 100-yard breast
