# COACH HUNT TRIES NEW COMBINATIONS ON FRESHMAN TEAM
## 
### Frank Baker 
Freshman football is being consider
ably disrupted this week by the trying
out of new combinations. Coach Hunt
is not entirely satisfied with any he
has had and is attempting to bring out
his best combination for the Trojan
games.
Rehrig, who two weeks ago was on
the second squad, and last Saturday
played as regular left end, is making
good in the wing position. Eaton and
Frost, two second-string halfbacks who
have been put on the first squad re
cently, will strengthen the backfield.
The main difficulty has been to find
substitutes. All who can be drawn from
the second squad add just so much
strength.
Colin and Offels, on the Grays, have
been doing good work at full and end,
and will probably be the next to be
pushed up to the higher squad if their
work continues to show such promise.
A1 Cook, who has been playing cen
ter up to this time, was tried out at
left guard yesterday. Cook is one of
the shiftiest and most aggressive de
fense players on the line, using his
hands to great advantage.
