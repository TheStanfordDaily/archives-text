# Hotelling Gives Course in Probability and Statistics
## 
### 
A new course in the mathematical
theory of probability and statistics is
being given this quarter by Dr. Harold
Hotelling of the Food Research de
partment. The central problem is that
of measuring the probability of statis
tical inferences—one which assumes
more importance when the universal
use of statistics in everyday life is
realized.
