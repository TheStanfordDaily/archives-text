# WARNER PREPARES FOR U. S. C. PASSES AT GRID PRACTICE
## 'THUNDERING HERD' NEXT Cardinal Third Team Uses Trojan Aerial Plays Against Varsity 
### Wilbur Adams 
Stanford's third team masqueraded
as the "Thundering Herd" yesterday
afternoon in the scrimmage practice
to give the varsity some real practice
in breaking up Howard Jones' pet
plays. It was the aerial game that
gave Southern California its victory
over Utah last Saturday, so Warner
kept the third team busy throwing
forward passes most of yesterday.
Both Elliott and Kaer of U. S. C.
throw accurately and Red Badgro's
spectacular catching of passes was
one of the features of last Saturday's
game. Newt Starke, at the other wing,
caught his share of passes in the Utah
contest and, by so doing, proved him
self to be an able substitute for Hobbs
Adams. A forward pass put the ball
within striking distance of Utah's goal,
and resulted in the one touchdown that
U. S. C. was able to score in the first
half.
U. S. C.'s second touchdown came
after the Mormons had been penalized
25 yards and Elliott had thrown two
forward passes to Badgro. But when
it came to actual line plays the Tro
jans did not seem to be there last
Saturday. In the first quarter U. S. C.
had the ball on Utah's six-yard line
<vlth four downs to go. Lee bucked
three times and Kaer once and still
the ball had not crossed the white
line. And that is why the first quarter
ended U. S. C. 0, Utah 0.
At one time during the second
period Utah had backed the Trojans
up to their three-yard line, but U. S. C.
retained the ball, and Drury was able
to punt out of danger.
Stanford's starting lineup against
the Trojans will be the same as the
starting team in the Occidental game.
McCreqrv will do the pivot work,
Poulson and Harris are the first string
tackles. Swan and Armour are regular
guards, and Walker and Shipkey are
at ends. The backfield consists of Mit
chell at quarter, Nevers at fullback,
and Bogue and Murphy at halfbacks.
The players that will leave tomorrow
night on the Lark are: McCreery, Van
Hook, Natcher, Price, Poulson, Harris,
Everett, E. Post, S. Post, Ro'oesky,
Sholes, Swan, Hunt, Armour. Shipkey,
Moore, Walker, Greisser, Middleton,
Vincenti, Hoffman, Graves, Work,
Trombetta, Hyland, Murphy, Bogue,
Hill, Patchett, Kirwan, Solomon, Mit
chell, Wright, Raffetto, Simmons,
Freeman, Herth, and Captain Nevers.
