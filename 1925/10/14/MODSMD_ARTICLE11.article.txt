# STAGE DESIGNS FOR MODERN PLAYS NOW ON DISPLAY AT ART GALLERY
## Collection Lent By Theatre Magazine Shows Tendencies In Technical Work 
### Astrid Arnoldson 
Stage designs lent by the Theatre
Arts Monthly magazine are the newest
exhibit at the Art Gallery. The collec
tion was obtained at the Art Gallery
by Gordon Davis, director of dra
matics, during his recent trip to the
East.
The collection includes photographs
and original drawings in color of set
tings and costumes. Most of these are
from current productions, but there
are a few from an older school of
stage design. Among the latter is a
photograph of a setting used for a pro
duction of "Romeo and Juliet" in 1910.
The comment attached to this picture
speaks of "the ponderous and labored
realism which dominated the theatre
of 1910." At that time scenes were
built much more elaborately than now.
Lights and back-drop curtains play
an important part in most of the mod
ern designs of the collection. A re
markable example of this is Norman-
Bel Geddes' design for the Purgatory
scene in a possible stage production
of Dante's "Inferno." The drawing
shows at the back a dark mass like
| a crater, with a great glow rising from

it. A small light, toward the fore-!
ground, centers on very tiny human j
figures, who seem to be on a gigantic j
and very dark flight of steps. These j
figures are Dante and his guide. The |
effect is striking and fear-inspiring.
Lighting Explained
An explanation attached to the pic
ture says that in the first scene, the
Inferno itself, all light comes from
below. In the Purgatory scene light
comes from behind. In Paradise all
light shines from above.
Silhouettes and shadows are effec
tively used in many of the settings.
Prominent among these is a scene
from "The Emperor Jones," in which
the shadow-pictures sound the note
of fearful mysticism peculiar to Eu
gene O'Neill's plays.
An interesting attempt to create at
mosphere is shown in a German
artist's idea of a setting for "R. U. R."
1 The entire background is made up of
massive machinery, most of which is
[to be in motion during the play. The
I idea is to suggest in every way pos
| sible, mechanical action.
In contrast to the German "R. U. R."
setting is one designed by Lee Si
mondson for the American premier
production of the play. Simondson
uses a setting very much like that
used in the Stanford presentation of
"R. IT. R." The background is a wall
entirely made of windows. Bareness is
the outstanding impression gained
from the Simondson set.
A new feature that has just reached
American producers is the Linnebach
lamp. A German invention, it elimi
nates the use of a painted back-cur
tain. The lamp is behind the curtain,
and projects onto it the design for the
background of the scene.
Another means of producing atmos
phere is the use of a drop-curtain
painted with a scene in the mood of
the play to be presented.
Pictures of marionettes used in seri
ous productions show that the me
chanical actors are not merely come
dians. According to the Theatre Arts
Monthly, producers hope to use the
marionettes more for serious work in
the future.
The exhibit was opened Sunday, and
will remain until October 18.
