nament will start Tuesday afternoon
at the Burlingame Country Club, it

Since the varsity match with Cali

on a match play basis as originally
planned, contestants will shoot seven
ty-two holes and turn in their medal
scores to Condit. The players will be
divided into three groups, according
to the handicaps they have been given
by their home clubs; men with handi
caps under ten to constitute'the cham
pionship group; between ten and
twenty, the second group; and above
twenty, the third group.
Prizes will be provided for the
champion and for winners of the sec
ond and third groups. An entry fee of
50 cents will be charged. Green fees
are 50 cents per day. Contestants may
play the seventy-two holes any time
within two weeks after the start of the
tournament, except on Saturday after
noons and Sundays. The only require
ment is that each player must make
the round in company with at least
one other entrant. Entry lists are
posted on the bulletin board in the
Encina gym.
