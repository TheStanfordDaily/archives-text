# FIRST BABE SOCCER PRACTICE DRAWS 19
## 
### 
Nineteen freshmen turned out yes
terday afternoon for the first soccer
practice of the season. Prospects for a
good team seemed bright when a num
ber of experienced players appeared in
uniform.
The freshman team will be heavier
than last year's yearling aggregation,
although the lack of an experienced
goalkeeper will weaken the eleven
considerably. Bovet. former San Mateo
High fullback, is a first-string left full
back and will materially strengthen
the backfield. Gibbs, who hails from
the Philippine Islands, seems to be
the leading candidate for the center
halfback job. Van Nuys, Lowell High
star, appears to be the best right wing
prospect, and Moffit shows promise
of developing into a first-class forward.
Don Clark, soccer coach, urges all
freshmen who have not signed up for
soccer to do so at once. Two full
teams are necessary and players
showing ability will be placed on the
first team.
