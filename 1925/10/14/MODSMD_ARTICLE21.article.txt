# The 						Dramatic Council Debt
## 
### 
Most of the students are aware of the fact that the Dramatic Council
has incurred a $2000 indebtedness, but few of them understand the
present financial condition of the organization. The Daily Palo Alto
offers the following explanation to prevent mistaken ideas arising and
false rumors from spreading.
Last year every play presented at the Stanford Assembly hall resulted
in a net profit to the council, with the exception of "Macbeth," a very
expensive production to stage. The Greek tragedies, "Oedipus Rex"
and "Agamemnon," presented during the summer quarters of 1924 and
1925, ran up the deficit, bijt this can be explained by stating that they
were given more for classical revivals than for money-making. They
secured nation-wide praise for and interest in Stanford dramaticsâ€”an
interest worth far more than mere money.
The debt exists almost solely because the Council deemed it advisable
to invest in permanent fixtures for the Assembly hall, and not because
of poor management or poor selection of plays. Before Paul Davis
retired as Graduate Manager he investigated the situation and stated
that the Dramatic Council as such was a sound and healthy organization.
President Wilbur has at all times given it his heartiest support. When
approached for a loan Comptroller Roth made a thorough investigation
and announced that his decision as to the merits of the organization was
identical with that of Mr. Davis.
Accordingly, the Board of Trustees made careful consideration and
granted a loan of $2000 to the council. This was purely a business matter
and was based upon no sentimental feelings whatsoever. The Council
is paying the usual rate of interest on this loan. The debts incurred
purchasing permanent fixtures included $1400 for equipment of which
$900 was for drapes. The new sky cyclorama were installed at a cost
of $350. When the loan was secured the outstanding obligations were
satisfied and a sound credit restored to the Council, which credit it still
enjoys. Considering this, the Board of Trustees decided the Council was
a good investment; hence its loan.
A heavy schedule of popular plays has been arranged for the coming
season. All of these should result in pecuniary gains and the Council
will at once be able to begin paying ofif the note. No more heavy dramas
will be attempted until the Council can show assets in excess of liabili
ties. "Hell-Bent fer Heaven," the first play of the year, started the ball
rolling.
