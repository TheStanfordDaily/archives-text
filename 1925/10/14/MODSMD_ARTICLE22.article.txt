# Stanford's Individual Hymn
## 
### 
Some time ago a popular song - declared that "The Argentines, the
Portuguese, and the Greeks" were the only Americans who knew the
national anthem. Some such condition exists at Stanford, where not
more than one student in fifty knows the second and third verses of
the hymn, "Hail, Stanford, Hail."
The hymn is short; yet few students are conscious of the fact that
the second and third verses contain pictures of the campus that are
even more poetic and sympathetic than those expressed in the first stanza.
The last two verses are printed below. It will not be time wasted for
every Stanford studnt to learn them not only as parts of the University
hymn, but also as a piece of verse characteristic of Stanford.
Second Verse
Arches Spanned meet the eyes
"Tender vistas ever new,
Where the Red roofs rim the blue
Of the sunset skies,
Fleck'd with cloudlets sailing;
ITere we raise our voices, hailing
Thee our Alma Mater.
Third Verse
"Where the moonlight bathed arcade
Stands in mystic calms,
When the light wind, half-afraid,
Whispers to the palms,
Then comes swelling, failing;
Sounds of joyous voices, hailing
Thee our Alma Mater.
