# CHAPPY AND HUMOR

An editorial appearing in this column yesterday called attention to the
efforts being made by the Midwest College Association and the Intercollegiate
Conference to stop the reprinting of humor from college publications in
salacious magazines which infest news stands. It has since come to the
attention of the Daily Palo Alto that Hammer and Coffn society has been
working toward this goal for a number of years, and has already made
substantial progress in prohibiting second-rate and cheap humor journals from
reprinting the material found in the various issues of Chaparral.
All copy used in Chaparral* is protected by copyright and cannot be re
printed without permission. Life, Judge, the Literary and the National
Reprint magazines are the only ones allowed to use this material. If any
magazine not accredited by the society reprints humor from Chaparral without
permission it lays itself liable for action against it. This is a decidedly
worthy and forward step in the fight against cheap journals.

Luther Burbank, plant wizard, has estimated that shaking hands with
100,000 a year who desire to meet him represents a monetary loss in time
amounting to $10,000. And on the other hand, most of us devote all of our
time to earning money, and can't even come near the ten thousand figure.
But, we can't all ask to be geniuses.
