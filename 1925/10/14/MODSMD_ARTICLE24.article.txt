By far the greatest evil at Encina
is ukulele playing. There seems to be
at least one of these instruments of
torture in every room, and the squeeky
discords of dyspeptic ukes succeed
one another like a chorous of yowling
cats on a back fence. We are sure that
Dean Culver would add the ukulele; to
his list of causes for students leaving
Stanford via the back door if he ever
attempted to live at Encina for any
length of time. —C. W.

Old Bonzo says 'at love's a game
Yeu play agin some little dame,
An' if you score, without no shovin',
You win the game, and git some lovin'.
But if she scores on fake plays, then
You know she's out with other men;
So all you gotta do is score —
Thas all there is—there ain"t no more.
—L. A. B.

Cyrus Buzlow wants to know, if he
puts in a petition for deafness, will he
get seats for the next play that aren't
in the last row.

If all the "Stanford" stickers used \
by the freshmen were placed end to
end they would make a line as long
as that used by most campus women.
