# CAMPUS OPINION

### 
. The Editor, Sir:
If Mr. Jaffee, "Harvard ex-23," will
I take the trouble to reflect that he is
i no longer at Harvard, but at Stanford
I where there are less than 500 women
|on the campus and more than 2500
; mon. he ni;iv find some excuse for not
I being identified by every woman in
Jail oi his classes.
The monotonous regularity of the'
; unshaven face and a dirty sweat shirt,
I which is the garb of most men on' the
Quad, make it desirable for men who I
wish to meet girls to get an introduo-!
tion if they expect to be remembered. !
