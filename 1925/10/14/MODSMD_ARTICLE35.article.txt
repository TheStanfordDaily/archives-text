## 
### Frank Baker 
Stanford freshmen play the Sacra
mento Junior College Saturday as a
final preparation for thtf tussle with
the U. S. C. freshmen, the following
Saturday. The U. S. C, game is con
sidered the second hardest game the
frosh will play, and nothing is being
left undone to assure a victory.
In the game Saturday new plays arul
combinations will be tried in an effort
I to get them well in hand before the
I intensive practice of next week. How
ever, too much experimental work will
not be possible, as the Sacramento
team is a strong aggregation and will
work hard to beat the yearling war
riors. Sacramento was beaten only 7
j to 0 by the San Mateo Junior College
! lust week. The San Mateans scored in
| the first quarter, but were unable to
endanger the Sacramento goal again
during the entire game.
Coach Hunt drilled the members of
his squad by the blackboard method
last night. The men seemed to profit
by this, as shown by the smoothness
with which they have been executing
their plays. A good deal of the credit
for this goes to Spud Lewis, quarter
back, who is a very able field general.
■ Running down under punts and block
! ing the line have been stressed in this
j week's work. The men showed weak
| ness in both these phases of the game
! in the early part of the season, but
| are gradually overcoming what might
! have been serious handicaps. The cen
; ter players on the line, as well as the
| ends, are learning to break away and
I get after the man with the ball.
It was stated at the opening of the
| season that Hunt could have a line
| averaging 200 pounds. This was the
case at that time, Ymt cannot be said
j now. He has steadily been getting
! fast, aggressive men in place of the
heavy, stolid line-buckers. However,
even now, there is no light average
on the forward wall.
