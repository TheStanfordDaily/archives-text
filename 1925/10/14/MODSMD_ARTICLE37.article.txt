# WARREN D. ALLEN WILL GIVE REGULAR THURSDAY RECITAL
## 
### Herbert Klein 
Two "Nocturnes" by Schumann will
be included in the 4 o'clock organ re
cital tomorrow afternoon in the Me
morial Church by Warren 1). Allen,
University organist.
Robert Schumann, one of the great
geniuses of the Romantic tendency in
music, is generally thought of in con
nection with piano or orchestra com
positions. His music for the organ has
the same intimate charm and deep
feeling that the name of Schumann
always stands for. The "Nocturnes"
are from his opus 23 and are those in
C major and F major.
A composition that will be familiar
to many is the dazzling "Coronation
March" from "The Prophet" by Gia
como Meyerheeh This march has pomp
and majesty to an extent found in al
most no other composition. In the
opera it accompanies the coronation
pageant of the ill-fated prophet as he
goes to be crowned.
The organist at Princeton Univer
sity, Alexander Russell, has written a
composition descriptive of the most
famous religious shrine on the Ameri
can continent and the scene of many
supposed miracles.
"Pastorale" from the "Second Sym
phony in C," by C. M. Widor, one of
France's greatest organists and com
posers, will also be played by Mr.
Allen.
