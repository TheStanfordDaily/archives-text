# Redwood City Youth Hurt In Palm Drive Smash-up
## 
### 
j Harold Dell, Redwood City youth,
! received slight bruises when the light
j cut-down which he was driving col
i lided with a Yellow Taxi driven by
Harold Baxter at the intersection of
Palm Drive and the state highway
about noon yesterday. Dell was re
moved to the Palo Alio hospital, where
; he was attended by Dr. L. E. Phillips,
| local physician.
According to Baxter, who was driv
ing toward the campus with a passen
i ger, Dell was going south at a high
! rate of speed and drove his car direct
ly across the path of the taxi. Baxter
averted what he believes would have
been a serious accident by locking the
wheels of his car and bringing it to a
dead stop. Dell was thrown out of his
machine by the impact. Neither Bax
| ter nor his passeuger were injured,
and with the exception of a slightly
dented fender on the taxi both cars
escaped damage.
