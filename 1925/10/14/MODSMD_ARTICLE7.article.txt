# "FRANCE WILLING TO PAY"-GUERARD
## GUILT OF FRENCH GREAT Professor Guerard Favors Complete Disarmament Among All Nations 
### 
"France does not want to shirk her
I debts," declared Professor Albert Leon
j Guerard in the lecture that he gave
lin the Assembly hall last night.
"France is proud of her record In
financial affairs, and intends that all
her debts shall be paid as soon as
conditions in the country permit. At
the same time she does not feel that
her debtors should be excused from
the payments of the sums of money
borrowed from her during the war."
He said that the Gettysburg Address
voiced the philosophy for which we
entered the war, for it was not en
tirely to fight France's battle that we
crossed the ocean. The fact was that
France had been fighting for three
years a battle which was partly ours.
"America's guilt, which we must not
minimize, is less than that of France
by three of her big men. Clemenceau,
Poincare, and Millerand have come
near to wrecking the friendship of
France and America."
France was disappointed when the
Treaty of Versailles was rejected, be
cause Germany had surrendered com
pletely and'the treaty was arranged by
Foch with the hopes that ideals would
be created, which all the countries
would stand by. Any new treaty at
this time would need the support of
the United States in view of the part
we had taken in the war. Our imme
diate rejection mocked the ideals
which France had hoped for.
In speaking of disarmament Profes
sor Guerard said ,"The only safe form
of disarmament is total disarmament."
He explained how difficult it would be
to justly limit each country, have
everyone satisfied, and at the same
alleviate further danger of conflict.
In closing he stated, "We don't have
to play the game as do other coun
tries, but we must play as we want
others to. In this way much can be
accomplished."
