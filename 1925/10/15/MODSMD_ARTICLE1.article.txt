# PARADE WILL GIVE VARSITY SEND-OFF FOR TROJAN GAME
## FORMS BY POSTOFFICE Band to Lead Procession Up Row and to Palo Alto Railroad Station 
### 
In order to give the varsity a rous
ing send-off when it leaves for Los
Angeles and to arouse pep and enthu
siasm for the U. S. C. game, the Rally
Committee has made plans to have a
big parade tonight. Marching at the
head of the rooters the band will lead
the procession to the station where
the team will be cheered as it boards
the train for the South.
The parade will form in front of the
postoffice at 8 o'clock. Since the squad
will not leave until nearly 9 o'clock
the parade will swing up Lasuen before
going to Palo Alto. After pepping up
the Row the rooters will march down
to the station, where they will be
given the opportunity to demonstrate
a little of the good old Stanford spirit
as the team departs for U. S. C.
Rooters' caps are to be worn to the
U. S. C. game next Saturday. Car
owners are requested by the Rally
Committee to decorate their automo
biles with Stanford colors and stickers.
The stickers can be purchased at the
Bookstore.
For the benefit of those who are un
able to go south a grigraph showing
the progress of the U. S. C. game play
by play over leased wire from Los
Angeles will be placfed in front of the
rooting section at the freshman game
in the Stanford stadium next Satur
day. In addition to the presentation of
a student body card a small entrance
fee will be charged to cover the ex
pense of running the gridgraph.
