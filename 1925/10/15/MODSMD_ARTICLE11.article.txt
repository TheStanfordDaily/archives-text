Twenty-one members were elected
to Euphronia Debating Society at
close of the tryouts held last evening
in the Trophy room of the Old Union.
Twenty-nine tryoutees for*the organi
zation delivered five-minute speeches
on subjects of their choice, at the close
of which members of Euphronia voted
as to their qualifications for member
ship.
An additional opportunity for obtain
ing membership other than at the
regular quarterly tryouts has been de
cided upon by Euphronia members.
During the quarter several candidates
will be admitted who show particular
ability and interest in the series of
open forums to be held by Euphronia.
In this way those desiring to try out
will not be required to wait until regu
lar tryouts.
"Campus Traditions" will be the sub
ject of the first open forum of the year,
which will take place next Wednes
day evening at 7:30 o'clock in the
lobby of the Old Union. Members of

of the Stanford traditions, moving
that the tradition be abolished. Discus
sion will follow as to the worth of the
tradition, at the close of which a vote
