# THORNTON TO TAKE PART OF MR. COADE IN "DEAR BRUTUS"
## 
### 
A further change in the cast of
i "Dear Brutus," to be given October 23, |
I was made at the first rehearsal. Wil- i
liarn Thornton will take the part of j
Mr. Coade, replacing Louis Hitchcock, â– 
who took the role when the play was j
produced this summer.
Thornton was originally cast for the i
part, but could not take it because he
' was also in "Agamemnon," another j
summer production. He has taken part |
in Stanford dramatics for several;
years, appearing in "Milestones," "R. j
U. R.," and "Macbeth."
Hitchcock is dropping out because J
he is to have a part in "The Goose'
Hangs High," the Sword and Sandals
I play to be presented November 6.
Hitchcock is an oldtimer on the cam
pus stage, and won recognition for his
splendid work in "If I Were King" sev-1
j eral years ago.
Gordon Davis, director of the play,;
; reported an excellent rehearsal in spite
of the fact that ail the members of
the cast were not present. Two mem-;
bers are making a special trip from j
Los Angeles to take part in "Dear
Brutus."
Settings for the play were designed j
;by Leslie Kiler and executed by Gor
| don Davis' class in theatre workshop.
, Costumes are being handled by Chrys
|
ella Dunker. Lighting effects, while (
not so difficult as in "Hell-Bent, fer
j Heaven," are unusual, especially in
{the second act, the scene of which is I
laid in an enchanted wood. Dick Fuller
; ton is the master of lights.
A one-o'clock dance in the Women's
i Clubhouse will follow the performance j
> of "Dear Brutus."
