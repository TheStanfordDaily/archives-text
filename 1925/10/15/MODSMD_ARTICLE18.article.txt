# STANFORD ELEVEN LEAVES TO BATTLE "THUNDERING HERD"
## THIRTY-NINE PLAYERS GO Trojan Team Doped to Win; Three U. S. C. Linemen On Cripple List 
### Wilbur Adams 
Both Stanford and U. S. C. have
been practicing behind closed doors
this week in preparation for the battle
in the Southland Saturday. The Cardi
nal varsity indulged in light work yes
terday and today, and this evening
thirty-nine determined football players
will leave for Los Angeles on the
"Lark."
The Trojans are doped to win Sat
urday's contest because of a veteran
squad and because the game is to be
played on their home field. But the
Southerners are handicapped with
three injuries, while Stanford is in
perfect condition. A1 Behrendt and
Mobbs Adams, star tackle and end re
spectively, were kept on the bench
last week-end. Then to add to these
two casualties, Biss Friend, regular
tackle, suffered a couple of misplaced
vertebrae in the game against Utah.
If these men are not in the game
against Stanford, U. S. C. will be
crippled, and if they are used Saturday,
they will not be able to play up to
form. The two teams are matched so
well that a slight casualty such as this
might be enough to balance the scales
in Stanford's favor.
Passes Dangerous
Word from the South says to beware
of forward passes. Warner saw the
U. S. C.-Utah game and he told the
squad, "their forward passes are the
only thing that I am afraid of." Break
ing up passes has kept the Cards busy
since Monday, and they are ready for
anything in the Coliseum this week
end. When it comes to breaking up
passes Pop Warner knows just about
how to instruct his men. Last year
Idaho had the best forward-passing
team on the coast, but they succeeded
in completing only three passes in the
game with Stanford.
Tuesday night the whole of the Stan
ford varsity enjoyed watching the Tro
jans play a football game. A moving
picture of the complete Whittier-U. S.
C. game was flashed on a screen in the
Union, and Stanford saw the Trojans
run wild, and score 74 points. The
picture was taken from the grandstand
