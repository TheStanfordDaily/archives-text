# TENNIS PROSPECTS FOR 1925 SEASON APPEAR PROMISING
## 
### Jack Beard 
Stanford's tennis prospects for the
coming season appear very promis
ing, with the return of Captain Lionel
/Tubby) Ogden, Cranston Holman, and
Paul Fairchild, three members of last
year's varsity. With the addition of
A1 Kerrington, Gomer Thomas, and
Ralph McElvenney from the freshman
squad, there should be ample material
from which to develop a powerful
team.
At present a non-varsity tournament
is being held. This tournament is open
to all men who have not won a nu
meral or a letter in tennis and conse
quently should unearth promising var
sity material. A gold medal will be
awarded the winner of the tourna
ment.
Tryouts for the varsity will follow
immediately after the non-varsity
tournament is concluded. All last
year's veterans are practically assured
a position, but the competition be
tween the new men for fourth posi
tion promises to be a close race. A1
Herrington, by his annexation of the
Los Angeles city title this summer,
is a slight favorite for the place. This
leaves Thomas and McElvenny to
fight it out for first alternative, provid
ing neither of them is able to defeat
Herrington.
Holman should experience little trou
ble in holding down his position as
first man. His victory over Bill Tilden
in an Eastern tournament this sum
mer created a sensation in the tennis
world and marked him as one of the
most outstanding players in the coun
try.
Ogden and Fairchild are doped to
play second and third man respec
tively.
