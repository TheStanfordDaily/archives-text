# "In Defense of Women"
## 
### 
A contributor to the "Campus Opinion" column in Tuesday's Daily
Palo Alto declared that Harvard snobs are but amateurs compared with
Stanford women. Probably the Daily should leave the defense of
women to Mr. Mencken, who has done a fair job of it in his book upon
that subject, but J. E. J. is so unreasonable in his statements that we
feel called upon to reply.
First, we will answer J. E. J. by reminding- him that women frequently
accuse men of being snobbish. Granting this for the sake of argument,
let us consider the antithesis of the present situation and suppose that
Stanford had 2500 women and 500 men. When the high hatting policy
of some of the men on the campus is as well developed as it is under
the present circumstances, what would it be under the latter conditions?
In these days of suffrage and equal rights women are inconsiderately
asking for the right of being- at least as Ritzy as men.
Then, reverting to a much worn-out argument, how are women to
notice the difference in the men when their features are camouflaged by
a manly but not necessarily gentlemanly beard and their clothes are
anything but distinctive?
But, to come to the real reason why J. E. J. is casting reflections
wrongfully on Stanford women. In common classroom relationships it
has always been customary to ask questions without hesitation, and
without previous acquaintance. It is also customary for the porter to
speak when he shines your shoes, and for the barber to chatter while he
cuts your hair. They are pleasant and affable for the moment, and when
seen on the street later —are forgotten. Just because the porter and
the barber helped you when asked, they do not expect you to invite them
to your next dice game or oratorical society meeting. J. E. J. wants
recompense in the nature of a friendly nod for answering a question.
Is he mercenary ?
Chance words in classrooms are purely a business matter. Anyone is
fcigoted and conceited to expect that a woman will shout at you across
the Quad or fall out of an automobile waving at you merely because she
sits near you at a lecture. Speaking in class is business; speaking on
the Quad is pleasure. The two don't mix. Stanford women are a
pretty square bunch taken as a whole—but Emily Post recommends an
introduction.
