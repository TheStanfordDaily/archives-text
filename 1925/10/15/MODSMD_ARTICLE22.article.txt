# Grasping Opportunity
## 
### 
Once someone said that "opportunity knocks but once" and ever since
people have been worrying because their chances have slipped while they
were napping. In college, however, opportunity pounds at the freshman s
door with the crash of a sledge-hammer; then it gradually decreases
until it reaches the senior's door with only a faint tapping.
A freshman stands at the threshhold of his college career with the
world literally at his feet. He should not let opportunities clamour
unheeded —for if he but wills he can make himself looked up to and
respected, or if he is lazy he can pass on through his college career
becoming more and more of a nomenity as the years glide one by one
into the past. It is easy for the freshman to find an activity suited to
his taste and capabilities; a sophomore finds it harder; and for a senior
it is almost impossible to start in activities unless he is already well
known. College memories will be far pleasanter if you can look back
to something material and worth while accomplished while you were an
undergraduate. So, Mr. breshman, heed the knocking, and interest
yourself in some activity before it is too late.
The University has placed receptacles for trash at several locations on the
campus. It will be well for everyone to cultivate the habit of care and
thouglitfulness in putting his waste papers into these cans instead of on the
ground.
The same might be said to freshmen who are having a huge time putting
their cast-off articles out of the Encina windows. Visitors will receive a
mistaken opinion of Stanford if they have to wade knee-deep through junk
to the doors of the freshman dormitory.
"You may change my opinion but you can't change my vote," says
Sherman, the English orator. He is partly right, because our pet ideas
generally remain as unmovable by outside influence as our wills.
If freshmen have to wear Dinks all year the poor fellows will be unable
to become "collegiate" until next year.
Daily Palo Alto staff members will meet in the Daily office at 1:10 o'clock
tomorrow afternoon.
