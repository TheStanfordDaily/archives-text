The Editor, Sir:
In the Tuesday issue of the Daily
Palo Alto there was a letter printed
that had for its subject the snobbish
ness of the Stanford women.
The previous day Miss Mildred
Worswick, in her Assembly address,
emphasized the fact that the women
wished to be known as active partici-j
pants in the Student Body and its ac
tivities. One of the most important of
student activities is the upholding of j
traditions. I am referring in particular
to that well-known tradition of "Hello." i
It seems to the writer that this custom,
if followed by the women, as well as |

the men, would help create those
friendships and acquaintances which
are such an intrinsic part of college
life. —J. H.
