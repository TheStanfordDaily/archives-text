How to Throw the Ball
The ball may be thrown in several
ways. The pass which is called the |
forward pass is called by that name |
because the ball is almost always
thrown with the front end forward. To
do this anyone in a football suit may
be presented with the ball by the
referee. The gentleman given the ball
then takes it in one hand and lifts it
over his head, making sure not to drop
it. (Footballs should be made of some
strong material so that they will not
break in case they are dropped.) But
as we say, the gentleman has the ball,
and if anyone should be so rude as to
ask him for it or to try to take it from
him, he should throw the ball away at
once and sock the other gentleman in
the eye.
A ring furnished with boxing gloves
and sand bags should be kept in readi
ness on the sidelines so that the play
ers can settle their disputes with the
referee. But as we were saying, the
gentleman about to throw the bull
(probably a misprint) lifts it over his i
head and slipgs it to another guy, who ;
also must be dressed in a football suit.■
If anyone interferes with the progress j
of the ball, he will be penalized fifteen
yards for carelessness.
The gentleman who receives the ball i
does not throw it away. He should al-!

ways keep it. However, if he is found
with the hall on his person later than
October 1, 1926, he will be severely
fined by the Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Blind Pigs.
Another form of pass is the rugby
pass. Before the players can execute
this pass they must change to rugby
suits. This pass is used when a player
who gets the ball does not know what
to do with it. Of course the most
natural thing is to give it to somebody
else, and so the ball is thrown to an
other gentleman. If the next gentle
man does not know what to do with
the ball, he throws it to another gen
tleman, and so on until the ball is
misplaced or worn out.
One of the most difficult passes in
football is the examination pass, but
of that more later.

the ball, he throws it to another gen

How to Throw the Ball
The ball may be thrown in several
ways. The pass which is called the |
forward pass is called by that name |
because the ball is almost always
thrown with the front end forward. To
do this anyone in a football suit may
be presented with the ball by the
referee. The gentleman given the ball
then takes it in one hand and lifts it
over his head, making sure not to drop
it. (Footballs should be made of some
strong material so that they will not
break in case they are dropped.) But
as we say, the gentleman has the ball,
and if anyone should be so rude as to
ask him for it or to try to take it from
him, he should throw the ball away at
once and sock the other gentleman in
the eye.
A ring furnished with boxing gloves
and sand bags should be kept in readi
ness on the sidelines so that the play
ers can settle their disputes with the
referee. But as we were saying, the
gentleman about to throw the bull
(probably a misprint) lifts it over his i
head and slipgs it to another guy, who ;
also must be dressed in a football suit.■
If anyone interferes with the progress j
of the ball, he will be penalized fifteen
yards for carelessness.
The gentleman who receives the ball i
does not throw it away. He should al-!

ways keep it. However, if he is found
with the hall on his person later than
October 1, 1926, he will be severely
fined by the Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Blind Pigs.
Another form of pass is the rugby
pass. Before the players can execute
this pass they must change to rugby
suits. This pass is used when a player
who gets the ball does not know what
to do with it. Of course the most
natural thing is to give it to somebody
else, and so the ball is thrown to an
other gentleman. If the next gentle
man does not know what to do with
