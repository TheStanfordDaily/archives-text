feeling it was a means of maintaining
the highest possible standards of
sportsmanship in athletic contests.
"This new ruling was formed to
make a definite stand on a situation

grade standing required by the con
ference ruling. Occasionally one of
these is an athlete and this situation
is now definitely covered."
