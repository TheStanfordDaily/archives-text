# CONTEST FOR GRAYS POSTPONED BY DAVIS
## 
### 
Coach Hal Davis has postponed the
game he had scheduled for the Grays
with San Luis Obispo Technical eleven
for next Saturday. Most of the men
are going down to the U. S. C. game
and there will not be enough for a
good team. The game is to be arranged
for later in the season.
The varsity seconds have been cut
to about thirty men. So many regis
tered for football that it was impos
sible for one coach to handle them.
Davis has requested the men cut from
the squad to turn out for interclass
football instead. This leaves him an
extremely strong lineup that should
take all of the games scheduled.
New plays are being practiced by
the squad this week, in preparation for
the game with the California Reserves.
Last Saturday the Bear second team
played the freshmen of the same insti
tution and were beaten by only one
point, 7 to 6.
