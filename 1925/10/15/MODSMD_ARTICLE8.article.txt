# CARDINAL SUPPORTERS EMIGRATE SOUTH TO U. S. C.
## MANY DEPART TODAY Special Leaves Tomorrow; Festivities Planned for Saturday Night 
### 
It was rkcided at a late hour to
day that the Stanford Band will go
down to U. S. C., fifty-four pieces
strong. The band will have a car
of their own on the Students' Spe
cial train and will entertain the
rooters on their way south.
Approximately eleven hundred Stan-1
ford students have undertaken an emi- 1
gration to Los Angeles, where Stan-!
ford and the University of Southern j
California will meet to decide which;
one will remain in the running for the
Pacific Coast Conference champion-1
ship.
Five carloads of students left last j
evening for the South, while a con
tinual stream may be seen today and
tomorrow leaving for the "Big Game" )
of Southern California. The "students' j
special" will leave tomorrow evening j
at 7:15 o'clock from the Palo Alto sta-j
tion, arriving in Los Angeles at 5 j
o'clock Saturday morning. One hun-!
dred and fifty are expected on the j
train.
The Southern Pacific agent has an- |
nounced that the train will be for Stan-1
ford students exclusively. The train '
will leave Los Angeles at 5 o'clock i
Sunday evening, arriving at Palo Alto I
in time for classes Monday morning. !
In addition to transportation pro- j
vided by the special train and by pri- â€¢
vate automobiles, a steamship com- j
panv has offered rates for a trip to i
Los Angeles for the game. J
Interest in the game has become so ;
tense that 90,000 are expected as the
referee blows his whistle Saturday at
2:15. The "Thundering Herd" has been
so heralded by football critics and
fans that U. S. C. students and sup
porters hope to defeat Stanford by a
decisive margin, thus sending their
team ahead in the Conference race. As j
U. S. C. does not meet California this |
year, no other game is expected to j
give such a test as the contest Satur
day.
Nelson Douglass, secretary of the |
Los Angeles alumni, has notified the !
Rally Committee that a stag dinner j
for the team, Stanford students, alum
ni, and supporters has been arranged.;
The dinner will be held at the Univer
sity Club at 6 o'clock. Two dollars a
plate will be charged. The U. S. C.
rally committee, the Trojan Squires,
also announce that a dance will be
held at the Biltmore Saturday evening
for Stanford students and their part
ners.
The game is scheduled for 2: lfi
o'clock at the Los Angeles Coliseum, I
which may be reached by driving to j
the end of Figueroa street.
