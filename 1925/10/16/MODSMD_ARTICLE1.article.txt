# DEVELOPMENT OF DAILY WARRANTS INCREASE IN SIZE
## ENLARGED ONE COLUMN Business Staff Efficiency Has Justified Change in Size of Page

The Daily Palo Alto today takes an-;
other step forward in its development j
with the issue of a seven-column edl- j
tion. An increase in the amount of i
available news, advertising, and the!
growth in circulation has been thought j
great enough to warrant this further 1
change.
The tliirty-three-year development
of the paper is interesting in that it j
tells the tale of the development of;
the University. Research through the I
old files shows gradual but undeniable
advancement of the Daily from the
lour-coluuin edition to a seven-column.'
First Policy
"The Daily Palo Alto is to be the |
medium through which all items of in-1
lerest may be published to members j
of the University. Above all it is not j
a paper run by a few individuals act- j
ing in a private capacity." This is the \
ideal which was back of its founding. J
A daily paper was the outgrowth of a!
magazine known as the Palo Alto. This |
publication was founded" in 1891 simul-1
taneously with the opening of the Uni
versity. Holbrook Blinn, the actor, fam
ous for his interpretation of "The
Bad Man," was the first editor. During
the same year, the Palo Alto joined
with the University of California pub
lication but the union became so ob
jectionable that it was discontinued.
Opposition at First
The Daily was started in the fall of
1892 against much opposition since
there was no demand for it, but there
was a field for it. The editor was John
Capron, but early in the year he re
signed, and Carl S. Carlsmith was
elected. The page was no longer a
magazine but it resembled one very
closely. There was no attention given
to top columns, no conception of news
paper makeup. The news scoop of the
day was put in the first top column
and continued on the next page.
The paper was a four-page edition
of four columns with small eight-point
heads. It contained no stories of out
side interest. The editorial page was
perhaps the most fully developed of
any part of the paper. Conservatism
was its outstanding feature â€” the
Hearst mania had not yet struck the
campus. In 1899, the first double-col
umn was used and a step upward in
the heads was reached.
Constantly Improved
In the 1905 editions we find the first
regard given to the makeup of the
paper. A great step was taken in 1914
when the paper was increased in size
to five columns, but during the year
1918 there were only three editions a
week because of the war. These papers
were sent to the soldiers enlisted from
Stanford and an attempt was made to
keep the campus posted on war news.
The second step in advancement came
in 1920 with the installation of a new
six-column edition. The paper is now
ready to step ahead once again with a
seven-column edition.
The first office of the Daily was in
the southwest end of the machine
shops, the printing being sent each
afternoon to the press of the Redwood
Democrat. Soon, however, it outgrew
this custom, and on October 3, 1892, it
issued the first edition from its own
press. At this time there were 75 fonts
of type; now there are approximately
300. The next move was made to the
present Press building which was con
structed the second year after the es
tablishment of the paper. Another
move will be made soon to the new
Daily office which is being built beside
the present structure.

been increased from three hundred to
four hundred pounds a year.
