# FRESHMEN HAZERS REPRIMANDED BY MEN'S COUNCIL
## $250 DAMAGE ESTIMATE Authorities Determined to Punish Ringleaders of Encina Invasion 
### 
Drastic action has been taken by the
University authorities in an attempt
to stamp out the spirit of vandalism
that marked the recent rajd of the
sophomore class on Encina.
The Men's Council in its last meet
ing decided not only to make the
sophomores as a class make good all
damage upon the University property
but also to endeavor to discover the
ringleaders and punish them as well.
During the raid, which is almost an
annual occurrance before the mud
fight, various members of the sopho
more class smashed transoms, doors,
hgll lights, and windows. The last esti
mate placed the damage at about $250'.
The decision of the Men's Council
follows:
WHEREAS, the Men's Council for
Student Control heartily disapproves
of any action by members of the Stan
ford Student Body which results in
the destruction of University property;
WHEREAS, the present sophomore
class has been guilty of such an offense
in its recent raid on Encina Hall;
IT IS HEREBY recommended that
the sophomore class be required to
pay all damages resulting to Univer
sity property from aforesaid raid and
that the sophomore class be instructed,
and is hereby instructed, to vote an
apology for the raid in question and a
promise not to repeat the offense; such
an apology and promise to be com
municated in writing to the Board of
Trustees of the University.
Evidences presented to the Council
during the investigation of the charges
against the sophomore class tended to
show that considerable of the damage
suffered in the raid was committed by
members of the freshman class in the
spirit of retaliation, which evidence
has been considered in mitigation of
the sophomore offense. However, it is
recommended that all damages be
charged to the sophomore class as in
stigators of the whole affair.
In addition to the above decision in
reference to the sophomore class as a
whole, the Men's Council will hold in
dividual members of the class who par
ticipated in the raid individually re
sponsible for their actions.

show that considerable of the damage
suffered in the raid was committed by
members of the freshman class in the
spirit of retaliation, which evidence
has been considered in mitigation of
the sophomore offense. However, it is
recommended that all damages be
charged to the sophomore class as in
stigators of the whole affair.
In addition to the above decision in
reference to the sophomore class as a
whole, the Men's Council will hold in
dividual members of the class who par
ticipated in the raid individually re
sponsible for their actions.
Respectfully submitted for the Men's
Council by

Secretary.
