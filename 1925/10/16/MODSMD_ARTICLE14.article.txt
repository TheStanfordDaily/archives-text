### 
Dr. David Starr Jordan claims
for himself and Professor A. W.
Smith, Cornell '78, the distinction of
riding in the first American-built
automobile, the most important ride
in American history following Paul
Revere's.
In 1892, two years before El wood
Haynes made his famous non-stop
dash of one mile and a half. Dr.
Jordan and Smith traveled in a two
cylinder machine all the way from
Stan Francisco up the Santa Clara
valley to the top of Mount Hamil
ton, a distance of twenty-six miles.
This embryo automobile was made
from a one-seated buggy by a man
named Elliot and traveled at the
rate of about three miles an hour.
