# CUD ELEVEN DOTTLES SOUTH VARSITY IN FIRST CONFERENCE GAME THIS SEASON
## Warner Invades Los Angeles With Improved Squad to Oppose New Coach of Trojan Team 
### Wilbur Adams 
OTANFORD plays its first conference game of the 1925 season in the Coliseum
at Los Angeles tomorrow afternoon against the University of Southern
California Trojans. The ball will be put into play at 2 o'clock sharp.
Pop Warner's varsity is already in the Southland, having arrived there this
morning on the "Lark." A light workout on the football field, and plenty of
rest, made up the day for the Stanford team in the Southern city.
The U. S. C. squad held very, very secret practice yesterday and today,
which would indicate that Howard Jones has something clever up his sleeve.
Jones' reputation is made if he conquers Stanford tomorrow, and it goes

■without saying that he is concentrating
his whole power 011 doing this deed.
Pop Warner is not going to be with
out a few tricks of his own, however.
Several prize plays have been worked
out by Warner, and U. S. C.is going to
be given the opportunity of being the
first team to test the power of these
tricks.
New Outfits for Cards
The Redshirts are appearing on the
field tomorrow in strange outfits con
sisting of lightweight jerseys, pants
without pads, and low shoes. Those
who saw the Big Game last November
may remember the shock they received
when the Stanford varsity ran on the
field wearing white socks, and light
suits that were built for speed alone.
While these light outfits are good for
speed, there is the danger that the
men will be injured.
The U. S. C. line somewhat out
weighs the Cards' forward wall, but
Stanford has quite an advantage in
the backfleld. Nevers, Bogue, Murphy,
and Mitchell outweigh the Trojans'
backfield almost ten pounds to a man.
While the Cards' backfield is heavier,
the Trojans' men are faster. Murphy
will be the fastest man in Stanford's
backfield Saturday, and he is probably
slower than Kaer, Lee, Drury, or Earle.
Both Lee and Kaer are track men of
some note, as are several of the men
in the Trojans' line.
Trojans Undefeated '
U. S. C. has played four contests
this year and each game resulted in
an overwhelming victory for the Tro
jans. Following are the scores of the
preliminary games:
U. S. C.—74, Whittier—o.
U. S. C. —33, California Tech —0.
U. S. C. —80, Pomona —0.
U. S. C.—2B, Utah—2.
Stanford's preliminary season has
not been so successful, but a gradual
improvement has been seen in each
succeeding contest that the Cards have
played. Their season's record is:
Stanford — 0, Olympic Club —9.
Stanford —20, Santa Clara —3.
Stanford —28, Occidental —o*.
Honors in Balance
Unless some dope is upset, the win
ner of tomorrow's contest will also be i
the winner of the Pacific Coast Con-'
ference for the year 1925.
The starting lineup is as follows:
Stanford— U. S. C.—
Shipkey LER Edwards

slower than Kaer, Lee, Drury, or Earle.
Both Lee and Kaer are track men of
some note, as are several of the men
in the Trojans' line.
Trojans Undefeated '
U. S. C. has played four contests
this year and each game resulted in
an overwhelming victory for the Tro
jans. Following are the scores of the
preliminary games:
U. S. C.—74, Whittier—o.
U. S. C. —33, California Tech —0.
U. S. C. —80, Pomona —0.
U. S. C.—2B, Utah—2.
Stanford's preliminary season has
not been so successful, but a gradual
improvement has been seen in each
succeeding contest that the Cards have
played. Their season's record is:
Stanford — 0, Olympic Club —9.
Stanford —20, Santa Clara —3.
Stanford —28, Occidental —o*.
Honors in Balance
Unless some dope is upset, the win
ner of tomorrow's contest will also be i
the winner of the Pacific Coast Con-'
ference for the year 1925.
The starting lineup is as follows:
Stanford— U. S. C.—
Shipkey LER Edwards
Poulson LTR Cruikshank
Swan LGR Taylor
McCreery C Cravath
Armour RGL Gorrell
Harris RTL Friend
Walker REL Badgro
Mitchell Q Kaer
Murphy LHR Earle
Bogue RHL Drury
Nevers F Lee
OTANFORD plays its first conference game of the 1925 season in the Coliseum
at Los Angeles tomorrow afternoon against the University of Southern
California Trojans. The ball will be put into play at 2 o'clock sharp.
Pop Warner's varsity is already in the Southland, having arrived there this
morning on the "Lark." A light workout on the football field, and plenty of
rest, made up the day for the Stanford team in the Southern city.
The U. S. C. squad held very, very secret practice yesterday and today,
which would indicate that Howard Jones has something clever up his sleeve.
Jones' reputation is made if he conquers Stanford tomorrow, and it goes

■without saying that he is concentrating
his whole power 011 doing this deed.
Pop Warner is not going to be with
out a few tricks of his own, however.
Several prize plays have been worked
out by Warner, and U. S. C.is going to
be given the opportunity of being the
first team to test the power of these
tricks.
New Outfits for Cards
The Redshirts are appearing on the
field tomorrow in strange outfits con
sisting of lightweight jerseys, pants
without pads, and low shoes. Those
who saw the Big Game last November
may remember the shock they received
when the Stanford varsity ran on the
field wearing white socks, and light
suits that were built for speed alone.
While these light outfits are good for
speed, there is the danger that the
men will be injured.
The U. S. C. line somewhat out
weighs the Cards' forward wall, but
Stanford has quite an advantage in
the backfleld. Nevers, Bogue, Murphy,
and Mitchell outweigh the Trojans'
backfield almost ten pounds to a man.
While the Cards' backfield is heavier,
the Trojans' men are faster. Murphy
will be the fastest man in Stanford's
backfield Saturday, and he is probably
slower than Kaer, Lee, Drury, or Earle.
Both Lee and Kaer are track men of
some note, as are several of the men
in the Trojans' line.
