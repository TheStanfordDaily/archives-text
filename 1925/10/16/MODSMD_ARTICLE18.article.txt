# CUD ELEVEN DOTTLES SOUTH VARSITY IN FIRST CONFERENCE GAME THIS SEASON
## Warner Invades Los Angeles With Improved Squad to Oppose New Coach of Trojan Team

at Los Angeles tomorrow afternoon against the University of Southern
California Trojans. The ball will be put into play at 2 o'clock sharp.

first team to test the power of these
tricks.

may remember the shock they received

field wearing white socks, and light
suits that were built for speed alone.
While these light outfits are good for
speed, there is the danger that the
men will be injured.
The U. S. C. line somewhat out
weighs the Cards' forward wall, but
Stanford has quite an advantage in
the backfleld. Nevers, Bogue, Murphy,
and Mitchell outweigh the Trojans'
backfield almost ten pounds to a man.
While the Cards' backfield is heavier,
the Trojans' men are faster. Murphy
will be the fastest man in Stanford's
backfield Saturday, and he is probably
