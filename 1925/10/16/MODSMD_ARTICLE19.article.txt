# W. A. A. MAKES NEW TRAINING RULES FOR WOMEN'S ATHLETICS
## Food, Sleeping Regulations Are Less Stringent; Season Longer 
### 
Radical changes in training rules for
women's athletics were put into effect
by the W. A. A. this quarter with the
beginning of the hockey season. The
new rules will be in operation all quar
ter instead of during the two weeks
before, and during the actual competi
tion, as was previously the case.
The changes call for less strenuous
training during the first part of the
quarter, with intensive training dur
ing the competitive period. They ask
that the women lead a normal life
during the season, paying strict atten
tion to rules of diet and sleep during
the last weeks when the interclass
games are played.
The regulations on diet state that
pastry and candy may be eaten at
meals in moderate amounts, tea or
coffee may be taken at one meal dur
ing the day, and light suppers may
be eaten after dances. During the
period of actual competition, beginning
with the night before, these privileges
are withdrawn. Under the old system
these things were forbidden during the
entire training period.
Every woman in training, under the
old rules, had to be in bed each week
night at 10: SO and had to sleep eight
consecutive hours on Friday and Sat
urday nigths. Now, all that is required
is eight consecutive hours of sleep
each niglit. There can be five sleep
cuts taken during the season, not more
than two being taken after competi
tion commences. The rule saying that
each player must be in bed at ten
o'clock the night before a game still
holds good.
