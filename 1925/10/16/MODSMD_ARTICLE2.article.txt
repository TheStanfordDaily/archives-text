# CALIFORNIA FACES SAINT MARY'S TEAM IN CRUCIAL BATTLE
## Captain Tut Imlay May Lead Bears to Victory Over Irish Tomorrow 
### 
Can California come back? Will the
decisive beating that the Olympic Club
administered to the Bruins last Sat
urday break the famous California
morale, and spell the end of the "Won
der Teams" across the bay?
Tomorrow, when the hastily reor
ganized Berkeley eleven faces the
veteran St. Mary's team, the answer
will be known. "Slip" Madigan's
charges richly deserve the name of
being one of the most-feared teams in
the West. Last year St. Mary's pos
sessed an unusually powerful team and
this year the team has remained prac
tically unaltered save for the addition
of some reinforcements.
From all points of view the game
should attract the spectator, for not
only will he have the opportunity of
either watching California "come
back," or bumbled in the dust, but he
will see the leading exponents of the
famous Notre Dame system launch
their deadly attack upon the Bears.
Tut Imlay, the "smiling captain" of
the Berkeley team, may prove the de
ciding factor in swinging the game
over for California. His strained back
is now practically healed and it is
very probable that tomorrow will see
him back in the lineup, leading his
team through one of the greatest
crises that has fallen to a California
team for many years.
All week Andy Smith lias been drill
ing the team in the fundamentals of
blocking, charging, and tackling. Such
thorough coaching is bound to bring
results, and the Berkeley campus is
pinning its faith on Andy Smith, who
has brought California through many
a tight place unscathed, to repeat the
performance tomorrow.
