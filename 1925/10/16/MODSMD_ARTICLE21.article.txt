# BRANNER, ROBLE WILL HOLD SONG CONTEST
## 
### 
Campus appreciation of music stock
rose a few points this week when
announcements were made of song
contests to be held by the Branner and
Roble clubs.
The lack of a hall song is the press
ing need of both organizations, and
song writers will have an opportunity
to display their ability. Only members
of the clubs may enter songs.
