						Larger Daily Palo Alto

### 
Volume 68, Number 12, of the Daily Palo Alto marks the first step
in a series of improvements which will place the publication of the
students of Stanford University with the foremost of the college dailies.
A six-column paper savors of the small-town journal; a seven-column
sheet makes a metropolitan make-up possible and opens an avenue for
future expansion. Now that the Daily has attained seven columns
the editors can start working' for other improvements—a morning paper,
special enlarged editions with weekly news pictorials, and so on ad
infinitum. The larger size makes the Daily a more interesting proposi
tion for advertisers and also enables the editorial staff to introduce special
departments which are impossible in the page of the smaller size.
Students can look forward to progressive moves within a few years, now
that the first obstacle is surmounted.
The editors of the Daily had hoped to change the name of the paper
at this time to "The Stanford Daily News" with the notation "Formerly
the Daily Palo Alto." Constitutional technicalities, however, blocked the
changing of the name at this time. Under the A. S. S. U. constitution it
will be necessary to accept an amendment at a general or special election
to change the name of the paper. This will be placed before the students
at the general Quad election in February. The reasons for the change
are to avoid confusion with the Daily Palo Alto Times in Palo Alto and
to get a name which clearly connects the paper with the University. To
an outsider "Daily Palo Alto" does not at once suggest "Stanford." i
Within two weeks the Daily will mOve into the new office building
which is being erected for it just south of the present Press building.
This building has been arranged so that all divisions of the paper can
work amicably together with a minimum of waste space and energy.
When the Daily moves into the new building the greater facilities should
make the sheet correspondingly better.
