# Efficient Crowd Handling
## 
### 
The Graduate Manager has issued a call for 600 men to act as special
policemen, ushers, and concession managers at the Big Game 011 Novem
ber 21. When we consider that 80,000 enthusiasts will flock to the
stadium and that 600 men are necessary to keep them moving in the
proper channels it dawns 011 11s with what a gigantic problem the traffic
managers for the Board of Athletic Control must deal.
In the past Stanford has had the reputation for handling crowds in
an efficient and courteous manner. Last year the Tournament of Roses
committee gave the entire management of traffic at the Stanford-Notre
Dame game to the Cardinal managers. Their work startled all of
Southern California, for every car was moving from the bowl at 6:15
o'clock in the evening—setting a new record for clearing automobile
jams. In the past 9 o'clock was the best time the Rose Bowl committee
had made.
This is just an example of the workmanlike manner in which Stanford
does things. Attendance at the game this year will be greater by about
12,000 than it has been before. This will make the work of the traffic
manager even harder. He has started out systematically by seeking
students to help him, but more than this will be necessary. Every student
will have to do his bit by taking care of visiting alumni, directing
strangers, and parking his automobile and himself where the policemen
direct him, without arguing or quibbling.
