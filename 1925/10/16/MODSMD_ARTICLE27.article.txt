An influx of unsigned contributions for the "Campus Opinion" column
of the Daily have been coming in with marked regularity the last few
clays. If these contributors will read the rules of the column they will
see that it is necessary to sign full names, but that only initials will be
printed if that is the wish of the author.
The Daily Palo Alto does not care to consider the views of men who
are so ashamed of them that they will not sign their own names at the
bottom. If "R. T. 15." and "A Senior Man," the latest offenders, will
come to the Daily office and sign their names to their letters they will be
printed. And others who desire to write letters for publication must
observe the rules or their letters will also find the floor of hte office—we
have no wastebasket.
