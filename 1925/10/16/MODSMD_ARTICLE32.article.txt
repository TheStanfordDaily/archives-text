bers, the Cardinal Grays will play San
Luis Obispo Polytechnic Saturday
morning at 10 o'clock. The ranks of
the Grays have shrunk because so
many of the men have preferred to

to give the Polytechnic players a run
for their money, however. The Gray
squad is unusually strong this year
and the poorest are able men. San
ders at end, Symons at guard, and
Graham at center have been the most
outstanding players up to date.

two more games scheduled before they
meet their rivals, California's second
squad. They will play the Santa Clara

State Teachers' College on the 31st,
and the California game on the 7th of

Eisel and Antonelle; tackles, Snyder
and Van Amridge; guards, Symons and
