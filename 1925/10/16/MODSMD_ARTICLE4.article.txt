# FATE OF TROJANS IS PREDICTED IN RALLY COMMITTEE PARADE
## 
### 
What "Pop" Warner's cowpunch
, ers will make the "Thundering
Herd" look like was depicted yester
day noon when three lumbering
cows, "jersey-clad" and labeled
"The-Tliundering-Herd," were led
by members of the Rally Committee
along the Quad.
Something in the weary look,
something in the shuffling walk of
cow No. 3 made the idea especially
good, since the punches stored up
by Warner and his cowboys are
sure to change the Trojan "Herd"
to "The Blundering Third."
A futuristic-ally painted bucking
Ford advertising last night's rally
accompanied the harmless-looking
"Herd." The "future" in futuristic
will be revealed to those attending
the game.
Ingenious mechanical changes
succeeded in making the Ford rise
up on its rear wheels as the occu
pants of the back seat shifted their
weight. A sudden application of the
brakes would bring the contraption
down off its "haunches" with a
bang.
It seems entirely likely that the
rumor was correct which stated it
was bought for "just a buck."
