# ENCINA POOL OPEN, SWIMMERS WORK OUT
## 
### 
Encina swimming pool was filled
yesterday and varsity swimmers were
able to take their first workout since
the quarter began.
A new mounting for the low diving
board has been installed, raising the
board to the height of one meter above
the water in conformance with Olym
pic requirements. Both high and low
diving boards are now regulation in
every respect.
It is planned to maintain the water
in the pool at a higher temperature
this year than last.
