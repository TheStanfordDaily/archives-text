# STANFORD OFFICIALS, FACULTY ORGANIZE CARDINAL GUN CLUB
## 
### 
Duck-hunting has been found to be
a hobby of a group of University of
ficials and faculty heads, and their
interest in the sport has led them to
form an organization titled the Cardi
nal Gun Club.
Comptroller Roth boasts that the
organization has more University de
grees in proportion to its membership
than any other gun club in existence.
The following are included on Its ros
ter: President Wilbur, Herbert Hoover,
Dr. Alonzo Taylor, Prof. J. P. Mitchell,
Roth, Dr. T. M. Williams, Dean Culver,
Prof. J. Newson, Dudley DeGroot, Dr.
Emmet Rixford, Paul Davis, E. L.
Hayes, Edwin Thomas, Fred Smith,
and Lewis Sutton.
Last spring, 160 acres of the duck
hunting grounds owned by Paul Shoup
and D. W. Johnston six miles north of
Colusa in Northern California was pur
chased by the club. A clubhouse has
been erected, duck blinds installed, and
enticing ponds created to lure the wary
duck.
The club members report that hunt
ing this season has not been very good,
but declare that this fact has not in
the least dampened the ardor of the
University shotgun artists.
