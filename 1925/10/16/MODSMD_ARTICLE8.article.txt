# STANFORD BABES TO TACKLE S. J. C.
## Gridgraph to Show Progress Of Game With Trojans Between Halves 
### 
Stanford freshman footballers will
tomorrow attempt to add another vic
tory to their 100 per cent average,
when they meet the Sacramento Junior
College eleven in the last game before
the semi-climax with U. S. C. freshmen
next week. The game will start at 3
o'clock, with no preliminary game.
Between halves, however, the Grid
graph will show the progress, of the
Varsity-U. S. C. game. At 10 o'clock
the second frosh team will play Lowell
High School.
Husky Hunt's team will enter the
field with a line averaging nearly 180
pounds. Tandy will be the heaviest
man, with a weight of 190 pounds. The
hackfield will start with considerably
less weight, their average being 167.
Three Men Out
During this week Hunt has not been
giving his. men any scrimmage, but
has been working them on their plays
and on the fundamentals. A number
have had minor injuries and he does
not want any crippled. As it is, three
men are out of the game because of
injuries: Doyle, Jones, and Artman.
This lac'R of men on the line will give
the reserves a chance to get some
valuable experience and to show what
they can do. In Cook, Hunt has found
a versatile and plucky player. Cook
will take Doyle's place at left guard,
where he has been practicing all week.
Moomaw replaces Artman, while Butte
will play right guard, in Jones' posi
tion. Marks will start in Wilton's place
at left half Saturday, in an attempt to
give him a little more practice in case
he is needed at a critical moment.
Lewis Improves
Spud Lewis, quarter, has come up to
all of Hunt's expectations, bringing
the team out of some tight places with
just the right plays, and gaining the
confidence of all his men. Lewis is a
triple-threat man, but under the War
ner system the quarterback does not
carry the ball, so he must sacrifice his
running, throwing, and kicking game
to the job of calling plays.
