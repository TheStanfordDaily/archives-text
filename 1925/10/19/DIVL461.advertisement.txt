"Dodson's Hints on Musical Hits"
The Seattle Harmony Kings are a
Benson organization.
They brought themselves into public
favor by playing the best dance music
available at Atlantic City last summer.
Which is quite a statement, but you'll
be inclined to agree after hearing their
first Victor records.
They play "If I Had a Girl Like You"
and "Darktown Shuffle." Both combine
melody with rhythm to make ideal
fox-trots.
Paul Whiteman contributes "I'm
Tired of Everything But You" and
"The Rhythm Rag." Interesting fox
trots, these, with many interesting
combinations which it will take more
than one hearing to appreciate.
Other hits of the moment include:
The Promenade Walk
Cecilia
Syncopatin' Sal
Summer Nights
