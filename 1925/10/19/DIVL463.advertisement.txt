"It's a great aid to scholastic efficiency"
ONE professor makes this ;omark, and countless otners are saying
the same thing. They know the value of a typewriter as a time
saver, as a means of compiling data, and as a help in the expres
sion of thought. Then too,, it frees ths "prof" from that tedious
ta3k of deciphering longhand, and keeps him in perfect "reading
humor." And perfect "reading hurr.or" tends to mean better marks.
