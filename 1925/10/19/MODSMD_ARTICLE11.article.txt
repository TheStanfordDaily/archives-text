# "THUNDERING HERD" ROPED AND TIED BY HARD FIGHTING CARDS
## SOUTHERNERS LACK DRIVE TO SCORE ON STANFORD FUMBLES Murphy Makes Spectacular 55-Yard Dash Through U. S. C. Defense 
### Wilbur Adams 
The "Thundering Herd" of the Uni
versity of Southern California stum
bled and fell over Pop Warner's foot
ball machine last Saturday in the
Coliseum at Los Angeles. The Trojan
wavhorse galloped for awhile in the
second half to score 9 points, but Stan
ford made 13 tallies in the first part of
the game, and this total was enough
to keep the Cards in the lead.
A thrill-a-minute was furnished the
80,000 football fans that packed the
great stadium of the Southland. Prom
the first few minutes when U. S. C.
had the ball on the Card one-foot line,
until the game finally ended with the
Trojans throwing pass after pass, the
spectators sat on edge to eagerly watch
the details of each play.
Mike Murphy made the run of the
day just before the half ended. He
caught Drury's punt on his own 35-
yard line and ran 65 yards through
the whole Trojan team to a touch
down. This score gave the Northerners
thirteen points—just enough to beat
Howard Jones' football team.
Stanford's first touchdown' came
when Nevers punted to Elliott, who
fumbled, and Ted Shipkey recovered
the ball on the 12-yard line. It took
Stanford just three plays to put the
ball over the chalked line. Shipkey,
on an end-around play, carried the
ball 9 yards, then Nevers bucked over
guard for the six points.
The Stanford rooting section had
little to cheer about in the latter part
of the game except when one of the
dreaded passes of the Trojans was
knocked down and when the final gun
echoed through the Coliseum.
Forward passes and a blocked punt
resulted in the rest of U. S. C.'s 9
points. The Trojans completed eight
passes for a net gain of 166 yards and
they had but two intercepted.
Stanford's line outplayed the South
ern California forward wall Saturday,
and the speedy Trojan backfield was
able to make first down only once
throughout the game by running with
the ball. They made first downs eight
times by forward passes. Stanford
made first downs five times.
