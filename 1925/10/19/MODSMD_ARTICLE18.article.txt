Vieing with the Gridgraph for the
interest of 2000 spectators the Stan
ford freshman football team won a 7
to 0 victory over Sacramento Junior
College last Saturday. Although win
ning from the Junior College, they I
could not even boast of a moral victory i
over the Gridgraph when it became 1
apparent that the varsity was winning j
from U. S. C.
Stubborn defense on both sides made |
it impossible for either team to make |
much yardage and thus the game was
slow from the onlooker's point of view.
When the Junior College backs opened
up a passing game in the fourth quar
ter it looked as if they were going to
go down the field to score, but the
yearlings finally got the combination
and broke up the passes in time. The i
teams were evenly matched in the
kicking game, Wilton doing much bet
ter than last week, his punts being
both longer and steadier.
The only score of the game was
made during the middle of the third j
quarter after a pass from Wilton to '
Sims netted a gain of 30 yards, and
another first down was made, placing j
the ball on the Sacramento 7-yard line. !
The Orange team held the babes for
three downs, then Spud Lewis made
a brilliant play to the 2-yard line, send-;
ing Harder, right end, over the goal
line on a double criss-cross.
Lewis kicked successfully, making
the 7 to 0 score which was not changed
during the remainder of the game, i
Near the end of the fourth period the
frosh had the ball over the line for
a touchdown, but were penalized fif- i
teen yards and were unable to make j
the goal again before the whistle blew, j
The loss of Doyle, Artman, and
Jones was clearly seen when the fresh- j
men desired to make yards through [
the line, but on the defense the men
filling their places seemed to hold up
their ends creditably. The weak spot ;
in the defense was failure to break up
passing plays.
