# Student Music Writers To Confer With Wiggin On Football Show Tunes
## 
### 
A meeting of all campus song writers
will be held at the Kappa Kappa
Gamma house at 7 o'clock tomorrow
evening. John L. Wiggin, musical di
rector of the Football Show, will con
fer with composers to explain the pro
posed program and the type of music
desired.
The date of the Football Show has j
been changed to November 20, the I
night before the Big Game. Hereto
fore it has been a tradition to have I
the Football Show after the Big Game, ;
but the committee has decided to make
it primarily for the campus rather than
visitors, and a start for the activities
of the week-end.
Something absolutely new and dif
ferent is promised. The program will
consist of three acts, containing fif- j
teen numbers in all. The committee |
desires ideas for dances, song and
dance numbers, skits, and all novel and j
eccentric ideas acceptable for a pro- 1
gram of this nature.
Students who can do specialty num-,
hers are requested to communicate
with some member of the committee
which consists of Gregory Williamson,
Delmer Daves, Irving Anschutz, Mar
jorie S. Allen, Evelyn Brownell, Nor
ris James, Charles H. Parks, Phil
ITrner, and Paul Bissinger. Gordon
Davis will direct the show.
