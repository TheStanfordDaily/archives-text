## 
### 
Fighting against a more powerful
team, St. Mary's went down in defeat
before California in the Memorial Sta
dium Saturday, before a crowd of
nearly 68,000 cheering fans.
For three quarters the Saints held
off the Bears without a score, but an
influx of fresh men in the Bears' ranks
succeeded in overwhelming the ex
hausted St. Mary line, and brought
California the only touchdown of the
day. Early in the fourth quarter Young
carried the pigskin to the shadow of
St. Mary's goal after a spirited run of
28 yards that had just been preceded
by two successive 10-yard dashes by
Dixon. Immediately following Young's
run Coach Andy Smith rushed in Carl
son for Blewett with instructions for
the next plays. Four plays in succes
sion Young carried the ball for a total
of 11 yards and to within a yard of
Saint Mary's goal posts. Then, as Saint
Mary's rushed upon Young again the
ball was slipped to Brown who plunged
over for a touchdown. Goal was not
converted.
Both captains, Tut Imlay of Cali
fornia and Ducky Grant of Saint
Mary's were unable to play but a
scant portion of the game as they were
both suffering from injuries.
Andy Smith is quoted as being satis
fied with the showing made by the
Golden Bears, for they won with
straight football and did not find it
necessary to disclose any tricks that
are being saved for the Stanford game.
