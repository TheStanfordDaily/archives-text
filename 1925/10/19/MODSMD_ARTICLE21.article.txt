# POINT SYSTEM TO BE DISCUSSED AT WOMEN'S MEETING
## Students Will Hear Report of Council's Probe at Annual Assembly 
### 
The annual Women's Assembly will
be held Tuesday morning, October 27,
at 9 o'clock, in the Little Theatre. All
women are urged to attend, as the
meeting will be open for discussion of
any problems concerning Stanford wo
women and in particular the question
of a point system.
At the assembly will be presented
the result of an investigation of two
tentative systems by Women's Council
to the Associated Women. The Coun
cil's work follows the recommendation
of last year's Women's Council that
various point systems be analyzed and
several chosen as a possible basis for
one for Stanford women.
It was moved, seconded, and carried
by Women's Conference at its regular
meeting on October 13. 1925, and ap
proved by Women's Council, that the
following question be debated and
voted upon: "A committee shall be ap
pointed to draw up a point system
which will be voted on by the women
in the regular student election in Feb
ruary, 1926." This motion was made
in order to avoid any confusion or mis
apprehension of the question.
At the assembly every woman will
have the opportunity to express her
opinion in favor of or against a point
system and the voting will be by secret
ballot, as recommended by Conference
and Council.
The stand of the majority of the
women on the question of a point sys
tem will be gauged by the voting Tues
day, October 27. If the greater number
of women vote "no," the matter of a
point system will go no further. If the
majority vote "yes," a committee of
women representing various activities
will be appointed to draw up a system
suitable for the apparent needs of
Stanford women.
Such a system, when drafted, will
be printed and made subject to criti
cisms and suggestions from the wo
men. Then the committee will re-draft
the system before the election in Feb
ruary.
If, at the February election, the con
census of opinion favors the adoption
of a point system for Stanford women,
it will be assumed that this point sys
tem is satisfactory to all, and if the
"nays" predominate, the matter of a
point system will be permanently
abandoned.
Any of the women should feel free
to suggest changes or criticize the
construction of either of the point sys
tems.

Stanford women.
Such a system, when drafted, will
be printed and made subject to criti
cisms and suggestions from the wo
men. Then the committee will re-draft
the system before the election in Feb
ruary.
If, at the February election, the con
census of opinion favors the adoption
of a point system for Stanford women,
it will be assumed that this point sys
tem is satisfactory to all, and if the
"nays" predominate, the matter of a
point system will be permanently
abandoned.
Any of the women should feel free
to suggest changes or criticize the
construction of either of the point sys
tems.
The annual Women's Assembly will
be held Tuesday morning, October 27,
at 9 o'clock, in the Little Theatre. All
women are urged to attend, as the
meeting will be open for discussion of
any problems concerning Stanford wo
women and in particular the question
of a point system.
At the assembly will be presented
the result of an investigation of two
tentative systems by Women's Council
to the Associated Women. The Coun
cil's work follows the recommendation
of last year's Women's Council that
various point systems be analyzed and
several chosen as a possible basis for
one for Stanford women.
It was moved, seconded, and carried
by Women's Conference at its regular
meeting on October 13. 1925, and ap
proved by Women's Council, that the
following question be debated and
voted upon: "A committee shall be ap
pointed to draw up a point system
which will be voted on by the women
in the regular student election in Feb
ruary, 1926." This motion was made
in order to avoid any confusion or mis
apprehension of the question.
At the assembly every woman will
have the opportunity to express her
opinion in favor of or against a point
system and the voting will be by secret
ballot, as recommended by Conference
and Council.
The stand of the majority of the
women on the question of a point sys
tem will be gauged by the voting Tues
day, October 27. If the greater number
of women vote "no," the matter of a
point system will go no further. If the
majority vote "yes," a committee of
women representing various activities
will be appointed to draw up a system
suitable for the apparent needs of
Stanford women.
Such a system, when drafted, will
be printed and made subject to criti
cisms and suggestions from the wo
men. Then the committee will re-draft
the system before the election in Feb
ruary.
If, at the February election, the con
census of opinion favors the adoption
of a point system for Stanford women,
it will be assumed that this point sys
tem is satisfactory to all, and if the
"nays" predominate, the matter of a
point system will be permanently
abandoned.
Any of the women should feel free
to suggest changes or criticize the
construction of either of the point sys
tems.
