# A 						Plea for New Songs
## 
### 
A copy of a letter sent to Bob White, chairman of the Rally Committee,
by Douglas W. Meservey, a senior, was received by the Daily Palo
Alto today. Meservey advocates an intensive campaign to procure a
series of new songs and yells for Stanford which will measure up to the
famous ones of other large universities. His criticism is well taken, and
the Daily suggests that the Rally Committee seriously consider his plan
of conducting a contest to run over a long period of time, or until suitable
new rousing marching songs have been obtained, to supplement the hymn
and "Come Join the Band" in the present roster of Stanford songs. The
Daily Palo Alto will lend vigorous support to such a plan.
The letter follows:
Mr. Bob White, Chairman Rally Committee, Campus.
My dear Bob:
I have heard Stanford songs and yells for several years. At first they
appealed to me simply because they were part of a new, great, school, but
now they seem only mechanical forms to be endured as part of a sporting
season.
1 might except the hymn, "Come Join the Band," and the "skyrocket"
ami "axe" yells, but even they have not the inspiring qualities of such
yell as California's "Golden Bear," the "Oski-wow-wow" of Illinois (not
of California, the plagiarist), and the Corps Yell of the Army; or such
songs as any of California's, "Far Above Cayuga's Waters" of Cornell,
"March on Down the Field" of Yale, "On Wisconsin," the Navy's
"Anchors Aweigh," or the "Washington and Lee Swing."
I am sure, moreover, that I am not the only member of the Stanford
student body with such feelings concerning these parts of our traditions.
Keep your ears open at any game, especially the Big Game when we
are competing in two ways with California, and listen to the frequent j
complaints.
May I offer a suggestion ? Begin a contest for the improvement of j
Stanford songs and yells, running over a long period of time so as to |
invite numerous entries, and at the expiration of that time let the
students choose their own improvements or dig their own graves with I
worse songs and yells. If this contest would not put our possessions on 1
a par with those of California and other great schools, it should at least j
be a beginning.
Sincerely, Douglas W. Meservey, '26.
