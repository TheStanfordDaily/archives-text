# Steps for Safety

Palm Drive, unlighted vehicles, and a rapidly moving' automobile
combined to take the life of Gene Joseph Dunne Friday night. To the
parents of the man who was killed the Daily Palo Alto expresses the
heartfelt sympathy of the entire student body, which it represents; and
for the protection of others demands that reasonable efforts be made to
prevent the duplication of this accident by a strict enforcement of
Paragraphs 74 and 78 of Chapter XVII of the California Vehicle Act
regarding the lighting of vehicles moving at night.
The drivers may be acting prudently and with reasonable care, but
accidents such as this are bound to happen when automobiles, wagons,
|a)nd bicycles travel about without Rights. Paragraph 74 makes it
necessary for every moving vehicle to display lighted lamps both front
and rear when being used a half hour after sunset and a half hour before
sunrise. Paragraph 78 says that bicycles must have a lamp in front and
a red light or reflex mirror behind.
In the past little regard has been paid to the enforcement of these
provisions on the campus. Pedestrians have also been allowed to walk
up the middle of Palm Drive at night. Frequently, when automobiles
pass each other one driver is temporarily dazed by the headlights of the
other car so that he cannot discern black objects ahead of him.
If these objects are made to have lights, as required, the hazard from
glaring headlights will be practically eliminated. It is an easy thing for
everyone to provide his machine with lamps and it may prove the means
of saving lives in the future.
