# Jumbled Relations
## 
### 
A women came into a Chicago divorce court recently, mourning the
fact that her relatives were so related that she wanted to get away
from them all. Here is her story:
"My mother ran away from my father in Germany and came to
America with another man. I adopted my brother and became his
mother. Then my mother died and I came to America and married my
step-father, and we had a son, now aged ten.
"So I am my elder son's mother and sister; my husband is my step
father and also the grandfather of his younger son, the sons are half
brothers, but the older is the uncle of the younger."
In a mixup like that she ought to thank Heaven that she isn't her
own grandmother.
