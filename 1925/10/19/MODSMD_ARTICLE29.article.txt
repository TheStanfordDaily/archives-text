A CAMPUS TRAGEDY
"Oh, sir," the maiden sweetly said,
"I simply can't get through my head
Why reflex arcs behave that way
Instead of lighting things like day."
"Most glad am I," the man replied,
i "That I am here right by your side
To solve the problems such as this
j Which interrupt the scholar's bliss."

So mightily he toiled, and soon
His explanations proved a boon —
So she declared, and with a smile
Repaid him many times. (Such guile!)
Next day upon the Quad did meet
This selfsame man and girl so sweet.
But this time sweetness was more cool;
He saw too late he'd been a tool.
So off he swore of womankind,
And set right out to be a grind.
Now was this not an awful fate
For one who helped his lecture mate?
