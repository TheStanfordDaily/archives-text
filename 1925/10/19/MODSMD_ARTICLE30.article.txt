# S. A. ON FOOD
## 
### 
Food is something to eat. It cornea
in cans, and is sometimes found in the
wild state. It used to consist of any
thing to eat, and variety was con
sidered necessary. But that was before
the eating clubs. Now food means:
Monday, blah-blah; Tuesday, blah-blah;
Wednesday, blah-blah; and so on.
In past ages you could buy food for
a consideration. Now they have no
consideration whatever. You go into a
store, and heave your moneybags on
the counter. If the clerk is not busy
cleaning his finger-nails, you may have
the privilege of speaking with him.
He eyes you; you shrivel. He sneers
at your money; you wilt. He finally
brings six eggs, and you walk out.
There are synonyms for food. The
ordinary one is Hash. This is food in
its most reduced stage. It contains
nourishment to the extent of .00001 per
cent of an equivalent amount of saw
dust. It is universal in composition.
Enough on this subject.
The final test of food is its per
manence. It is a failure if it doesn't
last over three days. Food of real
excellence has been known to be us
able for more than two months. We
leave to the Swiss cheese-makers the
acme of perfection in this line. The
butcher is an advocate of perfect food.
Evidences of super-strength on the
part of steaks and chops are to be
found at any shop. It is believed by
those who know that if not hooked,
! they would wander away. —L. A. B.
Some vinegar to Sam McCruz,
The bird who gets his daily snooze
No matter where he haps to be.
He works it in, as you can see.
In lectures, if the seat's just right,
To see him sleep is quite a sight.
The silent rester he abhors—
He opes his mouth and loudly snores!
