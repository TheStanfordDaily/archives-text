## Personnel Research Director Determines Individual Type of Interests 
### Fred Hines 
Interest tests as an aid to vocational
I guidance are now available to students
jat cost, it has been announced by
Karl M. Cowdery, director of personnel
research. This form of test classifies
the individual's interests into one or
more of three types bearing similarity
to the interests of successful doctors,
lawyers, and engineers. This service
will be given to any student upon pay
ment of fifty cents.
The interest test service is but a
small part, however, of the work of
the personnel research director. In
general, this department corresponds
to the laboratory in an industry: it
tests raw materials, observes and tests
the process, and finally determines re
sults in the product. The first phase
of the work is the evaluation of the
abilities of candidates for the student
body for entrance.
In addition to weighing and testing
high school credentials and recom
mendations, intelligence tests are
given in every high school throughout
the state, and, where examiners are
available and the service is in demand,
in special centers throughout the coun
try. This year the examinations will
be given in February and March in
stead of in May and June.
Dr. W. M. Proctor of the School of
Education will give the tests in the
northern half of the state, while Mr.
Cowdery will cover the southern part.
The personnel research department
also investigates any problem which
the Admission committee may present.
A second phase of the work is the
following up of the records of the
students after they have entered Stan
ford, and to compare their success in
college with their high school records
and with their intelligence test results.
The department also takes part in the
problem of placement and vocational
guidance. During the coming year
other tests of special ability will be
made available at cost, in co-operation
with the faculty committee on voca
tional guidance, of which Dr. Edward
K. Strong, Jr., is chairman. Ultimately
the department expects to follow the
student's success in after life, and to
compare it with his university and
even high school records. This last
step will be taken in co-operation with
the alumni secretary,
