# COOVER METHOD OF TOUCH TYPING GIVES STARTLING RESULTS
## New System Based on Good Psychology Shortens Mental Process 
### Fred Hines 
Dr. John Edgar Coover of the Stan-
ford Psychology department is the
originator of a new method of touch- j
typing called the Wiese-Coover metli-,
od, which promises to revolutionize:
the teaching of typing and the per- j
formance of the typist. The new meth-1
od, based on purely psychological prin- 1
ciples, aims to develop good form he-1
fore doing practical work by shorten
ing the mental processes involved.
Where the Weise-Coover kinesthetic
method has been tried, startling and
even revolutionary results have been
obtained. In 1920 the Behnke-Walker
Business College of Portland, Oregon,
where Mr. Wiese is supervisor of typ
ing, adopted the method. By 1923 the
students of the school had won nine
typewriters in accuracy contests; by i
1925 they had won seventeen. This fact j
is seen to be all the more remarkable j
when it is known that previous to that I
time an average number of two type-!
writers had been won each year in the
entire territory of the United States
and Canada. The kinesthetic method
enables a student of the school to type
thirty words per minute after one
month of instruction, fifty words per
minute after four months, sixty-five
words after six months, and one hun
dred after eight or ten months.
Method Originates in Laboratory
The method originated in Dr.
Coover's analysis in the psychological
laboratory of the performance of Mr.
Wiese and other expert typists. Dr.
Coover saw not only the possibility of
eliminating faults revealed in the
tests, but of perfecting a method of
instruction which would preclude the
formation of bad habits during the
period of learning. Such a method was
devised and tested by Dr. Coover, and
is at present in textbook form, a re- i
vised edition having been published j
this year.
The typist using the ordinary meth-1
od first sees the letter, forms a mental I
image of the key, and finally strikes
the key, using three ticks of the psy- :
chical clock. With Dr. Coover's method
the typist sees the letter; then, due to j
purely kinesthetic ("kin" —movement;
"aestkesis" —feeling of) control of the
fingers, the finger that makes the let
ter is immediately energized and set
into motion. This operation consumes !
but two ticks of the psychical clock, a j
saving of fifty per cent. Then, too, with ;
the three-element method the visual
imagery of the key interferes with the
visual perception of the copy, another
hindering factor removed by the two
element co-ordination.

typing called the Wiese-Coover metli-,
od, which promises to revolutionize:
the teaching of typing and the per- j
formance of the typist. The new meth-1
od, based on purely psychological prin- 1
ciples, aims to develop good form he-1
fore doing practical work by shorten
ing the mental processes involved.
Where the Weise-Coover kinesthetic
method has been tried, startling and
even revolutionary results have been
obtained. In 1920 the Behnke-Walker
Business College of Portland, Oregon,
where Mr. Wiese is supervisor of typ
ing, adopted the method. By 1923 the
students of the school had won nine
typewriters in accuracy contests; by i
1925 they had won seventeen. This fact j
is seen to be all the more remarkable j
when it is known that previous to that I
time an average number of two type-!
writers had been won each year in the
entire territory of the United States
and Canada. The kinesthetic method
enables a student of the school to type
thirty words per minute after one
month of instruction, fifty words per
minute after four months, sixty-five
words after six months, and one hun
dred after eight or ten months.
Method Originates in Laboratory
The method originated in Dr.
Coover's analysis in the psychological
laboratory of the performance of Mr.
Wiese and other expert typists. Dr.
Coover saw not only the possibility of
eliminating faults revealed in the
tests, but of perfecting a method of
instruction which would preclude the
formation of bad habits during the
period of learning. Such a method was
devised and tested by Dr. Coover, and
is at present in textbook form, a re- i
vised edition having been published j
this year.
The typist using the ordinary meth-1
od first sees the letter, forms a mental I
image of the key, and finally strikes
the key, using three ticks of the psy- :
chical clock. With Dr. Coover's method
the typist sees the letter; then, due to j
purely kinesthetic ("kin" —movement;
"aestkesis" —feeling of) control of the
fingers, the finger that makes the let
ter is immediately energized and set
into motion. This operation consumes !
but two ticks of the psychical clock, a j
saving of fifty per cent. Then, too, with ;
the three-element method the visual
imagery of the key interferes with the
visual perception of the copy, another
hindering factor removed by the two
element co-ordination.
