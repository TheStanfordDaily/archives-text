The original cast, with Paul Hays and Louis Hitchcock, will appear, con
trary to a former announcement, according to Gordon Davis, dramatic coach.
Hays is postponing a trip to New York in order to play Mr. Dearth, the
role in which he created favorable comment in the first production of "Dear
Brutus," given here July 31.
Hays was enrolled at Stanford during the summer quarter as a graduate
student in the classical literature department, and has taken prominent parts
in amateur roles in San Mateo and New York City. Louis Hitchcock will
resume his original role of Mr. Coade, and Charles H. Parks that of Mr.

Purdie. William Thornton and John:
L. Wiggin, who were scheduled to'
take these parts, have left the cast.
Hitchcock has been in campus dra-:
matics for several years, and is re- ]
membered for his fine work in "If I j
Were King." Parks has been promi- j
nent, appearing last year in "Polly j
With a Past," "You and I," and "R. U.;
R."
Marjorie Allen takes the role of Mar
garet, the daughter of Mr. Dearth. Al
though she appears only in one act,
the part is the leading woman's part,
and was taken by Helen Hayes when
"Dear Brutus" was first presented in
America. Miss Allen made her debut
in campus dramatics in "Captain
Applejack," and has since appeared
in "You and I" and "Ace High," the
1925 junior opera.
The part of Lob is taken by A. j
