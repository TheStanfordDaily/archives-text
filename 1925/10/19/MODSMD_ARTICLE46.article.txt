# SPORTS OF 1925
## The
						Brothers Jones 
### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
The fame of the name of Jones in the world of sports is well upheld by one
Bobby, of Atlanta, and (sometimes) by "Sad Sam," of the Yankees, but as
each football season rolls around you hear quite a bit about two others of the
clan, Tad and Howard, both Joneses, and both football coaches extraordinary.
The brothers Jones are at present not on speaking terms. That is, unless
they use the long distance telephone. No family quarrels is the reason,
although Tad may still feel a little sore at Howard because Howard's lowa
eleven beat Tad's Yale team in the Yale bowl in 1922. The causes are entirely
geographic, because Howard, like hundreds and thousands —perhaps millions —
of other lowa residents, packed up and moved to Southern California. There
he is now employed as coach of the doughty U. S. C. football team, a team
as potentially powerful as the Trojan track team which came East last May
to win the Eastern intercollegiate championships on Franklin Field.
Tad Jones, whose Yale teams haven't lost a game in two years, faces the
hardest kind of a season, and if he can get the Bulldog by Georgia, Penn,
Brown, Army, Maryland, Princeton, and Harvard, without a defeat, he can
well be ranked with Rockne as a wizard of the gridiron.
Howard coached Ted Coy's team that beat Harvard in 1909, while Tad
coached Cupid Black's team that beat Harvard in 1916. These were the
only two Yale teams to beat Harvard in thirteen years. Howard later coached
at Syracuse, Ohio State, lowa, and Duke.
