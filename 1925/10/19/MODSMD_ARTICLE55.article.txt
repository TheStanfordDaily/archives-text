# HUGE TOWER CLOCK SUPPLIES OFFICIAL TIME FOR STANFORD
## Speed of Chimes Regulated by Rotating Fan With Adjustable Vanes 
### Monroe Eaton 
Without the tower clock, li f e on the
campus would be disorderly and un
regulated. Not only does the clock
chime the quarter hours and strike
the hours, but it also rings all the elec
tric bells by which students go to and
from classes. If the clock gaias over
a minute, everyone is made late to
class.
The huge timepiece is a Seth Thom
as tower clock. The movement is about
five feet high, five feet long, and three
feet wide. The smallest moving cog is
the escapement wheel which ticks
every two seconds. The diameter of
this wheel is three inches. The time
weight ratchet is sixteen inches in
diameter.
A shaft of wood six feet long with a
200-pound block of iron at the lower
end, serves as a pendulum. This is
suspended from a piece of steel spring
an inch and a half wide and an inch
thick. Under the immense strain
exerted by the pendulum this spring
has bent back and forth thirty times
a minute for thirteen years without
giving way.
Four Bells for Chimes
The chimes consist of four bells of
harmonic pitches, which are struck in
different combinations on each quarter
of the hour. A set of four wheels with
lugs arranged in the required order
raise and drop the hammers. The speed
at which the chimes run is controlled
by rotating fans with adjustable
vanes which can be made to beat
against the air or to cut through it. It
was necessary to recast the chime
bells several times before the right
tone relation was obtained.
The clock movement and chimes are
driven by three large iron weights, sus
pended by half-inch steel cables which
are wound upon large grooved spin
dles. The weight which runs the quar
ter chimes weighs 400 pounds, the time
weignt 250 pounds, and the hour
chime weight COO pounds. The weights
have a drop of twenty-five feet.
The clock will run for eight days
without winding, but the task of lifting
the weights twenty feet at once neces
sitates winding the clock every day.
The weights are wound up by a crank.
Whenever the clock is wound the time
is checked by Western Union.
Contacts Operate Bells
The electric bells for the classes are
operated by a system of contacts ar
ranged on a dial. Two hands attached
to the minute and hour gears pass over
this dial and make contact at the time
the bells are to be rung. The connection
is then made by a contact on the sec
ond hand. In this way the bells can
be made accurate to the second. An
other control automatically breaks ihe
circuit so that they will not ring at
night.
The system consists of about twenty
bells distributed around the Quad and
Engineering and Chemistry buildings.
The mechanism in the clock operates
six relays on the campus which in
turn ring the bells to which they are
attached. Wires run underground from
the clock to the Quad and there
through the arcades to the bells. Wires
run partly underground and partly
through the air to the Chemistry
building. Dry batteries furnish the
electricity for the whole system.

Over five hundred students of the
University of Denver have adopted the
wearing of a red blazer as a distinc
tive garb of their university.
