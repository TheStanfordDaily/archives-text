# CAMPUS GOLFERS SET FOR MATCHES
## 
### 
Nearly fifty campus golfers will tee
off at Burlingame tomorrow in the
all-University tournament. Men mak
ing the best scores for the seventy
two holes of medal competition will be
selected for the varsity squad by
Manager Tom Condit. Entries will be
received up to 6 o'clock tonight in the
Encina gymnasium.
Players may make four rounds of
the course at any time between tomor
row and Friday, October 30, except on
Saturday afternoon and Sunday, when
the course will be closed to students
because most of the regular club mem
bers play on those days. Contestants
will be divided into three groups ac
cording to their handicaps, members
of the first group to compete for the
championship. Medals will be awarded
to the winner and runner-up in each
of the three divisions.
In addition to members of last year's
varsity and freshman squads, the fol
lowing men are expected to make
strong bids for the winner's trophy:
Neil Miller, Bobbie Syer, Ward Ed
monds, Bob Raymond, and Bob Ver
milya. The Burlingame course is in
the best of condition at present, and
Condit expects some excellent scores
to be turned in. Green fees for tourna
ment players will be fifty cents per
day, and must be paid at the caddy
house before every round. Men who
have paid the monthly fee of $5 will
not be required to make additional
contributions.
