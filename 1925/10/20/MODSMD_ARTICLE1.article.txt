# HELEN E. ATKINSON VIOLINIST TO GIVE CONCERT TONIGHT
## Charles Hart, Accompanist, Conducts Orchestra in San Francisco 
### 
Appearing as soloist in the concert
to be given in the Assembly hall at
7:30 this evening will be Helen Engel
Atkinson, noted violinist. Her accom
panist in a program of classical music
is Charles Hart.
Mrs. Atkinson is already known to
many on the campus. During the past
two seasons she has been the only
woman violinist with the San Fran
cisco Symphony Orchestra which has
played several times at Stanford. This
year she will begin her third season
"with the orchestra.
Mrs. Atkinson studied abroad and
has appeared in* recitals in Europe
and America and has had the distinc
tion of giving concerts with both Max
Bruch and Camille Saint-Saens. She is
at present a resident of Palo Alto.
Charles Hart, the accompanist, has
also had a notable record in music.
He studied in New York under Ep
stein and now is accompanist for Felix
Salmond, the well-known London cel
list. He played for three years with
Jacques Thibaud, one of Mrs. Atkin
son's teachers, and is now conducting
the orchestra of the Bohemian Club
in San Francisco.
The entire program is made up of
two famous violin sonatas. One is by
Cesar Franck, the foremost recent
French composer, and the other by
Johannes Brahms, of Germanic de
scent. The sonata, in form and suc-i
cession of movements, is exactly simi- j
lar to the orchestral "symphony" ex- 1
cept that it is rendered by one violin ;
and one piano rather than by a hun-!
dred instruments of different sorts, i
The same diignity and satisfying qual- j
ity is found in both, for the sonata has j
contrasting themes with their develop
ments logically worked out, just as
the symphony has.
Cesar Franck is continually receiv
ing more recognition for his works for
the orchestra which include several
tone poems and one great "Symphony
in D minor" which was heard here
last year on the occasion of the
Founders' Day concert in the Me
morial Church. Brahms was one of
the most brilliant pianists of Europe
in his youth.
