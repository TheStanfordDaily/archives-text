# SHINN ANNOUNCES TEAM FOR DEBATE
## Weigel, Scott, Combellack, Crocker to Meet U. C. On November 10 
### 
Stanley Weigel, Charles C. Scott,
George N. Crocker, and A. L. Combel
lack have been selected to form the
two teams representing Stanford at
the dual debate to be held with the
University of California November 10.
Allan Frazier and Delmer Daves were
selected alternates at the final tryouts.
The question for debate has been
tentatively worded, "Resolved, That
the democratic ideal is a mistaken
sentiment." Members of the two teams
will meet this Saturday at Berkeley 111
order to arrange a wording of this
question limiting the many phases of
argument which the present question
implies.
No designation has been made as to
which of the six men selected for the
debate will represent the affirmative
and negative sides of the question.
Some work on both sides of the ques
tion has been done by each member of
the team in preparation for the final
tryouts which were held last Friday.
