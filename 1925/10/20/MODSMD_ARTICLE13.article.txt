# FRESHMAN ELEVEN FACES U. S. C. JINX OUTFIT SATURDAY
## 
### 
This week the freshman gridders are
putting in many hours of real work to
get ready for the stampede of the
"Thundering Herd's" yearlings, who
will invade the Stanford stadium next
Saturday. The babes are intending to
put over another such victory as did
the varsity last week, for their motto
now is "100% or bust." For the pa'st
two years the Card freshmen have
played well until the U. S. C. game,
then have taken a big slump. However,
both years they managed to defeat
California. This year the freshmen are
figuring to break this habit, so they
can win every contest.
Next to the game with California,
the one with the Southern school is
the most important, and for some
years has been the hardest. Pop War
ner brought reports back a couple of
weeks ago that the Trojans have a
strong team again this year, abound
ing in hard line plungers and hard
tacklers who may give the freshmen
a taste of their own medicine. They
will also come up with a good assort
ment of forward passes if they follow
the example of their varsity team.
U. S. C. gets a large majority of the
high school stars from all over South
ern California and is able to pick out
a formidable aggregation even before
they start practice.
Artman and Jones were able to take
a slight workout yesterday, both being
out of the game Saturday on account
of injuries. Doyle, however, is not
doing any strenuous work as yet.
These men will be in shape for the
game next Saturday, and from all in
dications will be needed.
