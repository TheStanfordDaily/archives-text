# EARLY STANFORD FACULTY MEMBERS HAVE HARD LIFE
## "Tramp Perfessers" Walk Far, Manage To Escape Starvation On Quad 
### 
The first members of the Stanford
faculty who arrived in the summer of
; 1891 found the future campus a vir
! tual desert. No doubt the "tramp per
i fessers," as they were named by the
natives, endured all the hardships of
pioneering while they were waiting to
; shape the piles of buff sandstone
J blocks into the buildings of the inner
I Quadrangle.
Before the first houses were built
| on Alvarado Row, 'the faculty lived in
j Menlo Park. From there the professors
walked each morning over two miles
of hot, dusty highway to the Quad. At
| noon, the embryonic faculty sat 011 the
j curbstone under the shade of the ar
; cades, and ate its lunch from tiny
; baskets. The contents of these baskets,
j which were put up by the landlady,
| often turned out to be nothing but
j sweet pickles, hard-boiled eggs, and

| sour wine. The professors often es
; caped starvation by trading the wine
j lor pieces of frosted cake brought by
the stenographer.
j One professor, from Boston, found
it so difficult to obtain good food that
j he went to San Francisco four or five
times a week, "to get a cup of coffee."
One day, amo.ng the bills for Univer
| *ity material sent from the city office
to the President for auditing, there
J came ona from a San Francisco res
taurant bearing the legend:
"Leland Stanford Junior
University, Dr.,
"To one Terrapin Stew $1.25"
Suspicion at once fastened upon the
man who went to the city "for coffee,"
and it was only with difficulty that
he was able to clear himself of the
charge of carousing upon terrapin stew
! at the expense fo the University.
