### 
lnterclass football starts Saturday
when the freshman and sophomore
teams meet in the first game of the
series. The freshmen, who have won
both of their contests with high school j
elevens, are being coached by Harry !
Shipkey and are doped to win the in- ]
terclass football championship be-1
i cause of their intensive practice.
John C. Canfield. sophomore football
manager, urges all second-year men
who have ever played football to turn
I out as there are only twelve men prac
ticing daily. Judging from the present
| turnout the sophomores will not be
I able to duplicate the success of last;
I year's sophomores who won the chum- j
| pionship.
