I UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA,
j Oct. 20'. —Coach Clint Evans' powerful
freshman team will reign supreme in
the Berkeley Memorial stadium for the
next two weeks, during which time
they are scheduled to clash with the
California Aggies Reserves on the 24tli
and the St. Ignatius Reserves on the
31st.
Last Saturday's performance against
the San Diego Marines showed that
Coach Evans has built up an irresisti
ble defense and a brilliant offense
which has seldom been equalled by a
California babe gridiron team. The
Marines, who boast an All-American
coach, were expected to run wild over
the freshmen and scheduled the game
merely as a practice tilt for their game
next Sunday with the Olympic varsity.
The Cubs' forward wall has mastered
the art of tackling and blocking and
has made possible the brilliant work
of Zarley, Cockburn, Barr, and Clymer
in the backfield.
The freshmen opened up an aerial
attack early in the second half of last
Saturday's tilt which completely swept
the Marines off their feet and paved
the way for two of their three touch
downs. Clymer, who performs at quar
terback, threw his bullet-like passes
with exceptional accuracy and judg
ment. With Armstrong, Nuner, and
Booth holding down the wing posi
tions, the Marines have made very
few yards on end runs, and many times
the safety man dropped in his tracks
when attempting to return some of
Clymer's punts.
With but three weeks until the Lit
tle Big Game, Evans is grooming his
men to meet the Cardinal freshmen
on November 7. The Cardinal babes
have met practically the same oppon
ents as the California frosh, and com
parative scores are practically the
same, all of which promises to make
the annual clash a very hotly con
tested affair.
The game will be played at Stanford
as the feature tilt on November 7.
