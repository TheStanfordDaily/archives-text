# COLLEGE EDUCATION VALUED AT $72,000 BY DEAN E. W. LORD
## 
### 
Dean E. D. Lord of Boston Univer-!
sity has estimated that monetary j
value amounting to $72,000 is the re- j
turn for a college education to the I
average student. The high school edu- j
cation is placed at a value of $33,000t
to the individual. These figures were !
obtained upon a study of the average
earning capacities of college and high
school graduates.
The report gives the average maxi
mum yearly income of the untrained I
man as $1200; that of the high school
graduate as $2200; and that of the
college graduate as $6000. While the i
untrained man at the age of 50 begins ,
to drop toward dependence, the col- J
lege man reaches his maximum earn
ing capacity at 60.
"The untrained man goes to work
as a boy of 14 and reaches his maxi-)
mum income at the age of 30," the re-:
port said. "This maximum is, on the
average, less than $1200. In view of â– 
the fact that this income is earned
by manual labor, dependent on physi- i
cal strength, it begins to fall off at the I
age of 50, or even earlier, and soon
reaches a level below self-support. The j
figures show that more than 6 out of 1
every 100 untrained workers are de
pendent upon others for support at |
the age of 60."
