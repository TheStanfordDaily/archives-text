## 
### 
Cross-country men of campus living
groups are advised by C. W. Davis,
director of Intramural Sports, to begin
training for the intramural cross-coun
try run which is scheduled for Novem- j
ber 14.
Contrary to last year's ruling, no
varsity men can be entered. The
course of approximately three miles j
will be the same as that of last year, ;
beginning and ending at the stadium.
Under the present regulations every
team that has three men finish the i
race makes five points, regardless of
their position. This change was made
to encourage teamwork and so that
no organization having one or two ex- j
perienced runners has an advantage.
