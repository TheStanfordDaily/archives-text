# VARSITY TO MEET O.A.C. ELEVEN IN GRIDIRON CONTEST
## Aggies Have Untried Team Which Has Taken Three Practice Games 
### Wilbur Adams 
Next on the Cardinal football sche
dule comes the Oregon Agricultural
College of Corvallis —an untried eleven
of doubtful quality. The game, which
is Stanford's second conference match
and Oregon's first, will be staged in
the stadium next Saturday.
The Oregon aggregation has won
three practice contests already this
year, but these preliminary games tell
very little about the actual strength
of the team. The Aggies opened their
season by defeating Willamette 51 to
0. The week before, Washington had
taken Willamette into camp with a
108 to 0 score, so the Aggies' perform
ance was not startling. O. A. C. beat
Gonzaga with twenty-two points to
spare. Last week-end the Aggies won
from Whitman College by a score of
62 to 0. After the first quarter of the
Whitman game, the Aggies used all
second-string players in an effort to
keep the score down. Yet the score
ran up to sixty-four.
Power Uncertain
It appears like another case of U. S.
C. That is, playing weak squads and
running wild in the preliminary
matches, arid then not knowing how to
act when it meets a strong team that
can give real competition. O. A. C. has
seen its backs run the ends at will,
buck consistently, and forward pass
without the danger of losing the ball.
Saturday they are hitting a stone wall
that will not yield with the slightest
tap. But O. A. C.is not overconfident
as the Trojans undoubtedly were. The
Aggies know that they are going to
meet one of the strongest elevens in
the conference, when they run on the
field next week-end.
CorvaUis weather and Palo Alto cli
mate are somewhat different, and the
advantage goes to Stanford, who is
used to playing in the sun. The train
trip from Oregon will not help the
team's condition either. So, all-in-all,
Stanford is a strong favorite in the
game Saturday.
Last night the varsity scrimmaged
the Grays and scored touchdown after
touchdown. The victory over U. S. C.
seemed to have pepped the whole
squad up, and practice yesterday
looked better than any Monday work
out this year. With the exception of
Muggs Mitchell, who was taken out
of the Trojan game with an injured
ankle, the whole squad was in perfect
condition, and none the worse for hav
ing worn the light padless suits in the
U. S. C. game,
Stanford's chance to win the Pacific
Coast Conference championship rose
several points since last week. The
Trojans were doped to have the
strongest eleven on the Coast, while
Warner's aggregation was rated about
fourth, but again dope was spilled. The
fans will have their eyes on California
next Saturday when they make their
debut into the conference with a game
with Oregon University. At present,
Idaho holds first place in the confer
ence standing, but Idaho has not had
a real test as yet. U. S. C. meets Idaho
on October 30 at Moscow, and the re
sults of this meeting will throw light
on the winner of the 1925 conference.

very little about the actual strength
of the team. The Aggies opened their
season by defeating Willamette 51 to
0. The week before, Washington had
taken Willamette into camp with a
108 to 0 score, so the Aggies' perform
ance was not startling. O. A. C. beat
Gonzaga with twenty-two points to
spare. Last week-end the Aggies won
from Whitman College by a score of
62 to 0. After the first quarter of the
Whitman game, the Aggies used all
second-string players in an effort to
keep the score down. Yet the score
ran up to sixty-four.
Power Uncertain
It appears like another case of U. S.
C. That is, playing weak squads and
running wild in the preliminary
matches, arid then not knowing how to
act when it meets a strong team that
can give real competition. O. A. C. has
seen its backs run the ends at will,
buck consistently, and forward pass
without the danger of losing the ball.
Saturday they are hitting a stone wall
that will not yield with the slightest
tap. But O. A. C.is not overconfident
as the Trojans undoubtedly were. The
Aggies know that they are going to
meet one of the strongest elevens in
the conference, when they run on the
field next week-end.
CorvaUis weather and Palo Alto cli
mate are somewhat different, and the
advantage goes to Stanford, who is
used to playing in the sun. The train
trip from Oregon will not help the
team's condition either. So, all-in-all,
Stanford is a strong favorite in the
game Saturday.
Last night the varsity scrimmaged
the Grays and scored touchdown after
touchdown. The victory over U. S. C.
seemed to have pepped the whole
squad up, and practice yesterday
looked better than any Monday work
out this year. With the exception of
Muggs Mitchell, who was taken out
of the Trojan game with an injured
ankle, the whole squad was in perfect
condition, and none the worse for hav
ing worn the light padless suits in the
U. S. C. game,
Stanford's chance to win the Pacific
Coast Conference championship rose
several points since last week. The
Trojans were doped to have the
strongest eleven on the Coast, while
Warner's aggregation was rated about
fourth, but again dope was spilled. The
fans will have their eyes on California
next Saturday when they make their
debut into the conference with a game
with Oregon University. At present,
Idaho holds first place in the confer
ence standing, but Idaho has not had
a real test as yet. U. S. C. meets Idaho
on October 30 at Moscow, and the re
sults of this meeting will throw light
on the winner of the 1925 conference.
Next on the Cardinal football sche
dule comes the Oregon Agricultural
College of Corvallis —an untried eleven
of doubtful quality. The game, which
is Stanford's second conference match
and Oregon's first, will be staged in
the stadium next Saturday.
The Oregon aggregation has won
three practice contests already this
year, but these preliminary games tell
very little about the actual strength
of the team. The Aggies opened their
