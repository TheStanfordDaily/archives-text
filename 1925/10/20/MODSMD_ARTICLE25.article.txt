# Education and Starvation

"University presidents and Boards of Trustees have become blinded
by our great American craze for mere size. A few million dollars donated
to education means more buildings, more students, and more teachers, not
better teaching by instructors who are paid sufficient salaries and allowed
time for study and leisure," is the opinion of Frank Bohn in the October
issue of Forum who breaks out with drastic measures suggested to rescue
higher education and the starving professors.
It is an undisputed fact that first-class members of university faculties
are rapidly deserting education for business, where their first year salary
is from two to five times as large as the highest wages paid to professors.
]t is also a fact that one western state university boasts that it ministers
to more than 40,000, while 15,000 of these are full time students.
However, when Bohn suggests that total registration in his "Utopia
University" should never exceed 1,500, that the faculty should have three
hundred members, and that the lowest paid member would receive $20,000
—he is speculating many years ahead of our time. The idea is excellent
but it cannot possibly work under the economic situation of today and still
continue our system of democratic education.
Should the universities be limited to the intellectually superior, or does
the ntaion owe the very highest training possible to all of its citizens?
Whatever the answer to the question may be, an intelligent modification
of expenses for university buildings and plant is entirely possible. If
buildings and equipment are limited to too great an extent, higher educa
tion will be open to even a smaller percentage of American youth. If
more of this money was concentrated on the qualifications and salary of
the instructors, higher education in the United States might be more suc
cessful. Frank Bohn has given American citizens food for thought.
