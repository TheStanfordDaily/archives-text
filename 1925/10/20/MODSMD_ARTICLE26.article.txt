Practically the only source of revenue which the Rally committee pos
sesses comes from the sale of rooters' caps by a Palo Alto merchant. An
agreement was made with this firm two years ago giving it the exclusive
agency to sell these headgears, in consideration of which the firm was to
turn over to the committee a percentage of each sale.
The Palo Alto merchant has kept his agreement and has annually paid
to the Rally committee a sum of money which has been adequate to cover
the expenses incurred by the committee. And by doing this the merchant
has handled the hats at a loss —making up for his deficiency in increased
trade which he had a right to expect from students who came to his store
to purchase the hats.
Recently a less well known merchant in Palo Alto obtained a supply of
caps of an inferior quality which he was able to retail for half what the
authorized agent charges—but the Rally committee does not get a cent
from this second firm.
Members of the committee explained the situation to the price-cutter,
but he refused to refrain from selling. Therefore, the student who thinks
rallies and bleacher stunts are worth while will have but one course to fol
low. Buy from the authorized agent, and insure a real Stanford rooting
section.
