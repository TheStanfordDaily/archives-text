With this issue Aileen M. Brown and Florence R. Gallagher assume
their new duties as news editors of the Daily Palo Alto. Both came on
the staff at the same time, last fall quarter, and throughout the course of
duties as reporters, their work has been of exceptional merit. With the
expansion of the Daily to a seven-column sheet more departmental heads
are necessary, and this double promotion has rewarded the two most
qualified.
If you don't think co-opcration is necessary, look what would happen to a wagon
if one wheel came off.
A sure way to keep a job is to get things so mixed up on your first day that they
can't afford to fire you.
