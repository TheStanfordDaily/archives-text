COLD SNAP HITS CAMPUS
Roughs Badly Frost-Bitten
Reports have it that one man was
frozen to death and several others
were frosted to a critical condition
when a rough attempted the other day
to say "Hello" to a campus woman
whom he had never met. So frigid was
the catastrophe that icicles were seen
hanging from the roof of the Law r
Building at noon.
Those that saw the accident state)
that the victim did not have a chance
of escaping with his blood in a liquid
condition. It was necessary to place
the body in an ammonia refrigerator
in order to avoid too sudden thawing.
A large snow man was built from the
ice shaved off of those who were un
fortunate enough to be near the scene
of the catastrophe. It took twelve men
fifteen hours to get the three men
loose who were frozen to the pave
ment of the Quad.
A movement is under way to place
emergency steam vents in all the
buildings of the Quad so that the lives
of Stanford men will not be endan
gered in the future. An investigation
as to the legitimacy of women carry
ing concealed weapons of refrigeration
is being planned.
* * *
Vest pocket stoves are now being
sold at the Bookstore for those who
find the Quad a little chilly.
♦ * *
Saws for cutting through the ice will
be given away to any man whose
beard is less than a'half an inch long
and whose trousers weigh less than
five pounds.
* * *
According to latest reports Roble
Hall is now being used as a cold
storage warehouse.
* * •
Ice skating on the Quad will be a
popular sport this winter.
♦ * *
But, after all, you can't blame the
men for being particular.
♦ * *
Cabbages is shocked, ashamed, sur
prised, and mortified to hear that a
campus woman won't even speak to a
man when she doesn't know him.
* * *
After all, what is the use of helping
a woman in class if she won't speak
to you outside of class.
* * *
We wish to announce to all those
who haven't already found it out, that
a classroom is a place to polish apples,
not to break ice.
» » »
Habits formed at college are very
frequently continued after graduation.
Now as a matter of fact, we really do
believe that a man might not take
kindly to the idea of his sweetheart,
or better, or worse saying "Hello" to
everyone she passed on the street.
♦* , »
Anyone who likes to talk to a lot of
women should start an afternoon sew
ing and tea-drinking club.

COLD SNAP HITS CAMPUS
Roughs Badly Frost-Bitten
Reports have it that one man was
frozen to death and several others
were frosted to a critical condition
when a rough attempted the other day
to say "Hello" to a campus woman
whom he had never met. So frigid was
the catastrophe that icicles were seen
hanging from the roof of the Law r
Building at noon.
Those that saw the accident state)
that the victim did not have a chance
of escaping with his blood in a liquid
condition. It was necessary to place
the body in an ammonia refrigerator
in order to avoid too sudden thawing.
A large snow man was built from the
ice shaved off of those who were un
fortunate enough to be near the scene
of the catastrophe. It took twelve men
fifteen hours to get the three men
loose who were frozen to the pave
ment of the Quad.
A movement is under way to place
emergency steam vents in all the
buildings of the Quad so that the lives
of Stanford men will not be endan
gered in the future. An investigation
as to the legitimacy of women carry
ing concealed weapons of refrigeration
is being planned.
* * *
Vest pocket stoves are now being
sold at the Bookstore for those who
find the Quad a little chilly.
♦ * *
Saws for cutting through the ice will
be given away to any man whose
beard is less than a'half an inch long
and whose trousers weigh less than
five pounds.
* * *
According to latest reports Roble
Hall is now being used as a cold
storage warehouse.
* * •
Ice skating on the Quad will be a
popular sport this winter.
♦ * *
But, after all, you can't blame the
men for being particular.
♦ * *
Cabbages is shocked, ashamed, sur
prised, and mortified to hear that a
campus woman won't even speak to a
man when she doesn't know him.
* * *
After all, what is the use of helping
a woman in class if she won't speak
to you outside of class.
* * *
We wish to announce to all those
who haven't already found it out, that
a classroom is a place to polish apples,
not to break ice.

Habits formed at college are very
frequently continued after graduation.
Now as a matter of fact, we really do
believe that a man might not take
kindly to the idea of his sweetheart,
or better, or worse saying "Hello" to
everyone she passed on the street.

Anyone who likes to talk to a lot of
women should start an afternoon sew
ing and tea-drinking club.
