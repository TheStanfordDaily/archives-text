# CAMPUS OPINION

The Editor, Sir:
Since time immemorial, Stanford
has ranted on the Gold and Blue at
every game, irrespective of the op
ponents. Of what interest are the Cali
fornia colors to Santa Clara? Why
mourn over burying Berkeley, when
the trouble at hand is Oregon? Who
cares about the death of the Osky
Bear, when the team is more con
cerned with crushing Occidental?
Stanford is wide awake in every re
spect except in this. There surely must
be some ability hidden away among
the variety of students attending the
University. Let it loose! Give genius
a chance to soar to new heights! Songs
are not the special province of the
classes of 1912 back. Talent did not
all die out with the writing of any of
these songs. Clever men are still roam
ing about the campus, hunting for
something with which to exercise
their ability. Why not give them a
chance to write songs in a contest
similar to the contest held last year
before the Trojan game? If the Rally
Committee does not care to sponsor
such a contest, why not have one
under the auspices of the Daily Palo
Alto, and present the winning songs
to the Committee?
No matter what happens, it seems
that Stanford initiative, famous in
other fields, should be applied here.
The songs are really necessities. As
such, it should be the duty of all those
capable to try and furnish them for
University use. —L. A. B. *
Who said "Rough's Roost?"— Adv.
