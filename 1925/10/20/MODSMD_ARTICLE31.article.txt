Procedure at Intersections When
Turning
It is always unlawful to turn to pro
ceed in the opposite direction in a
business district, except at intersec
tions. In a residential district you may
turn in the middle of the block if there
is no other vehicle approaching in
either direction within a distance of
200 feet.
Whether turning at an intersection
or elsewhere, the proper signals must
be given by the use of the hand and
arm or by means of a mechanical or
electrical device of a type approved by
the Division of Motor Vehicles. Signals
must be given continuously during the
last 50 feet traveled before turning. If
the signals are given by use of the
hand and arm, they must always be
given from and beyond the left side
of the vehicle.
There has been a great deal of mis
understanding regarding the right of
way rule and figures gathered by the
California State Automobile Associa
tion show that from 30 to 80 per cent
of all automobile accidents, varying in
different localities, take place at street
and highway intersections.
In the first place, an intersection is
defined as that space formed by the
extension or prolongation of the boun
dary or property lines of the inter
secting highways or streets. The mo
torist should approach an intersection
at a safe speed, not at the maximum
legal speed of 15 miles per hour for
blind intersections, if such speed is
unsafe.
The motorist should yield the right
of way to the vehicle approaching
from his right if such vehicle is ap
proaching the intersection at the same
time, or at approximately the same
time. Do not pass another vehicle at
an intersection unless directed to do. so
by a traffic officer.
In turning to the right keep to the
right of the center of the intersection
and as close as practicable to the
right hand curb or edge of the high
way. In turning to the left execute
the turn beyond the center of the
intersection and as close as practica
ble to the right of the center point of
the intersection.
