# ALPHA PI ZETA MEETS
## 
### 
Alpha Pi Zeta held a luncheon meet
ing yesterday in order to elect its
officers for the ensuing year. James C.
Grant was elected President to suc
ceed Robert C. Littler. The
other officers are: Henry Lamb, Vice-
President, and Victor H. Harding, Sec
retary-Treasurer. This fraternity, now
in its fourth year at Stanford, has at
present eight resident members. Un
like some of the Eastern chapters,
these members are admitted only from
the Political Science department upon
the recommendation of some faculty
member of that department. Member
ship in it is, therefore, purely honorary
and a signal distinction.
