# GARDNER DISCUSSES MEMORIAL CHURCH HISTORY, SYMBOLISM
## Decorative Designs Secured On European Travels By Mrs. Stanford 
### 
"The History, Architecture and Sym
bolism of the Memorial Church" was
the subject of an address given by
Dr. Gardner to new students recently.
In telling of the purpose for which
the church was founded, Dr. Gardner
paid tribute to Mrs. Stanford's love for
the University and devotion to the
students.
He read a letter written to him by
Mtb. Jane Lathrop Stanford while she
was traveling in Egypt in February,
1904. The desire of Mrs. Stanford in
building the Church as expressed in
this letter was "That Stanford be not
a godless institution, that men and
women be enlightened to their obliga
tions toward each other, and that hu
manity be bettered." To fulfill this
desire has been the task of the workers
of the Church.
Designs Submitted 1898
Although designs for the Church
were not submitted until 1898, the
Church was included in the original
plan of the University, provision being
made for it in the charter. Mrs. Stan
ford made a special tour of Europe to
select designs and decorations.
Dedication of the Church took place
on January 25, 1903, after a three-year
period of construction. The Church
was built by Mrs. Stanford primarily
as a memorial to her husband and to
fulfill one of the objects of establish
ing the University. The founders felt
that non-sectarian religious study
should be a part of the work under
taken.
In 1906 the Church was partially de
stroyed by the earthquake, the most
damage being done when the steeple
was shattered by the shock. Not until
1913 was the Church fully restored
and then at a cost of $750,000. Little
architectural alteration was made in
restoring the building, the principle
of the rounded arch being preserved.
Bible Scenes Depicted
The scheme of decorations is in
three keys. The windows in the lower
part of the Church give a complete
life of Christ illustrated by pictures
from the great masters. The second
key, the mosaics, depict scenes from
the Old Testament, while the third,
represented by the upper windows, are
pictures of heroes and heroines of the
Bible.
There is in the Church the only copy
ever made of Cosimo Roselli's "Last
Supper." The original was done in
1400 and is in the Sistine Chapel at
Rome. It is also noteworthy that the
figures of women are more numerous
than in church decorations generallv.
Mrs. Stanford desired this to show the
uplifting influence of women on reli
gion.
Another of the possessions of the
Church is the first American flag au
thorized by the United States govern
ment to be carried by the American
Expeditionary Forces in France.
Flag Returned
Of four flags dedicated at the Audi
torium in San Francisco, one was des
tined for the First Stanford Unit of
American Ambulance Field Service,
which was already in service in
France. In order that this unit, being
the first to serve, should have the
honor of unfurling at the front the
first officially authorized flag, the Sec
ond Stanford Unit sent the flag to the
First American Unit in advance, <and
conferred upon one of its members,
Arthur Kimber, the honor and re
sponsibility of carrying it from the
United States to France, where it was
turned over to the First Division on
February 4, 1917.
After the war the flag was returned
to Stanford, and it may be seen now
on the left side of the chancel in the
Memorial Church.

bolism of the Memorial Church" was
the subject of an address given by
Dr. Gardner to new students recently.
In telling of the purpose for which
the church was founded, Dr. Gardner
paid tribute to Mrs. Stanford's love for
the University and devotion to the
students.
He read a letter written to him by
Mtb. Jane Lathrop Stanford while she
was traveling in Egypt in February,
1904. The desire of Mrs. Stanford in
building the Church as expressed in
this letter was "That Stanford be not
a godless institution, that men and
women be enlightened to their obliga
tions toward each other, and that hu
manity be bettered." To fulfill this
desire has been the task of the workers
of the Church.
Designs Submitted 1898
Although designs for the Church
were not submitted until 1898, the
Church was included in the original
plan of the University, provision being
made for it in the charter. Mrs. Stan
ford made a special tour of Europe to
select designs and decorations.
Dedication of the Church took place
on January 25, 1903, after a three-year
period of construction. The Church
was built by Mrs. Stanford primarily
as a memorial to her husband and to
fulfill one of the objects of establish
ing the University. The founders felt
that non-sectarian religious study
should be a part of the work under
taken.
In 1906 the Church was partially de
stroyed by the earthquake, the most
damage being done when the steeple
was shattered by the shock. Not until
1913 was the Church fully restored
and then at a cost of $750,000. Little
architectural alteration was made in
restoring the building, the principle
of the rounded arch being preserved.
Bible Scenes Depicted
The scheme of decorations is in
three keys. The windows in the lower
part of the Church give a complete
life of Christ illustrated by pictures
from the great masters. The second
key, the mosaics, depict scenes from
the Old Testament, while the third,
represented by the upper windows, are
pictures of heroes and heroines of the
Bible.
There is in the Church the only copy
ever made of Cosimo Roselli's "Last
Supper." The original was done in
1400 and is in the Sistine Chapel at
Rome. It is also noteworthy that the
figures of women are more numerous
than in church decorations generallv.
Mrs. Stanford desired this to show the
uplifting influence of women on reli
gion.
Another of the possessions of the
Church is the first American flag au
thorized by the United States govern
ment to be carried by the American
Expeditionary Forces in France.
Flag Returned
Of four flags dedicated at the Audi
torium in San Francisco, one was des
tined for the First Stanford Unit of
American Ambulance Field Service,
which was already in service in
France. In order that this unit, being
the first to serve, should have the
honor of unfurling at the front the
first officially authorized flag, the Sec
ond Stanford Unit sent the flag to the
First American Unit in advance, <and
conferred upon one of its members,
Arthur Kimber, the honor and re
sponsibility of carrying it from the
United States to France, where it was
turned over to the First Division on
February 4, 1917.
After the war the flag was returned
to Stanford, and it may be seen now
on the left side of the chancel in the
Memorial Church.
