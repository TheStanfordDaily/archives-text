# ROOMMATES WERE ENTIRE STAFFS OF EARLY MAGAZINES
## 
### 
Twenty-seven years ago, two men liv
ing in Room 81, Encina, edited the only
two Stanford periodicals then in existance,
the Stanford Sequoia and the Daily Palo
Alto. Each man was chief editor of his
own paper and chief associate editor of his
roommate's, while at frequent intervals
they traded papers and their correspond
ing "positions" on the staff. Everett W.
Smith, '99, now head of the division of
journalism at Stanford and Bristow
Adams, '00, were the editors of these
straggling publications.
Early in the next year the two decided
to put out a third publication that would
fulfill the demand for a comic paper.
Struggling for a name the enterprising
organizers decided to follow the custom
then in vogue of naming campus publica
tions and buildings after trees. Thus the
Daily Palo Alto, Sequoia, Live Oak,
Roble, Madrona, and Encina received
their names. At first the name "Eucalyp
tus" signifying something formless and
straggling seemed to be an appropriate
name but later "Chaparral" was choscn,
as it was the most knarled, crooked and
twisted growth upon the campus. The
new paper was to appear tri-weekly and to
be modeled after the Harvard Lampoon,
the Cornell Widow, and the Princeton
Tiger.
The first cartoon frontispiece depicted a
freshman's introduction to "essence de
Searsville" while the title ran, "There was
a roomer afloat in Encina last night." In
the words of Bristow Adams, the first
edition "took with the rabble." Unfortu
nately, however, financial difficulties
forced the paper to remain dormant for a
time. Early in the next year the founders
came back on the job again, and with
financial support succedeed in launching
the "Chappy" upon such a successful
career that it has as yet to miss an edition.
For the past twenty-six years Chaparral
has continued to exist, notwithstanding the
unfortunate fluctuations that have caused
Josh, Sequoia, Palo Alto, Pictorial,
Cardinal, and Spectator, to cease publica
tion.
Credit for the foundation of the college
comic magazine that has won a first and
two second prizes in Judge's College Wits
contests of the last three years, is due the
two young undergraduate founders, for
C happy was entirely a private enterprise.

comic magazine that has won a first and
two second prizes in Judge's College Wits
contests of the last three years, is due the
two young undergraduate founders, for
C happy was entirely a private enterprise.
Twenty-seven years ago, two men liv
ing in Room 81, Encina, edited the only
two Stanford periodicals then in existance,
the Stanford Sequoia and the Daily Palo
Alto. Each man was chief editor of his
own paper and chief associate editor of his
roommate's, while at frequent intervals
they traded papers and their correspond
ing "positions" on the staff. Everett W.
Smith, '99, now head of the division of
journalism at Stanford and Bristow
Adams, '00, were the editors of these
straggling publications.
Early in the next year the two decided
to put out a third publication that would
fulfill the demand for a comic paper.
Struggling for a name the enterprising
organizers decided to follow the custom
then in vogue of naming campus publica
tions and buildings after trees. Thus the
Daily Palo Alto, Sequoia, Live Oak,
Roble, Madrona, and Encina received
their names. At first the name "Eucalyp
tus" signifying something formless and
straggling seemed to be an appropriate
name but later "Chaparral" was choscn,
as it was the most knarled, crooked and
twisted growth upon the campus. The
new paper was to appear tri-weekly and to
be modeled after the Harvard Lampoon,
the Cornell Widow, and the Princeton
Tiger.
The first cartoon frontispiece depicted a
freshman's introduction to "essence de
Searsville" while the title ran, "There was
a roomer afloat in Encina last night." In
the words of Bristow Adams, the first
edition "took with the rabble." Unfortu
nately, however, financial difficulties
forced the paper to remain dormant for a
time. Early in the next year the founders
came back on the job again, and with
financial support succedeed in launching
the "Chappy" upon such a successful
career that it has as yet to miss an edition.
For the past twenty-six years Chaparral
has continued to exist, notwithstanding the
unfortunate fluctuations that have caused
Josh, Sequoia, Palo Alto, Pictorial,
Cardinal, and Spectator, to cease publica
tion.
Credit for the foundation of the college
comic magazine that has won a first and
two second prizes in Judge's College Wits
contests of the last three years, is due the
two young undergraduate founders, for
C happy was entirely a private enterprise.
