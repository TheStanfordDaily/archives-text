No review of "Don Q, Son of Zorro"
as presented at the New Stanford would
be complete without a mention of the at
mospheric prologue. It wasâ€”well ,very
atmospheric. The picture was really much
better than one would have expected from
the prologue although Fairbanks did tread
the measures of the inevitable tango, or
whatever it is, with the inevitable dance
hall beauty, he did not do it in the pro
logue manner. Said prologue must be
seen to be appreciated.
Immediately after the performance we
dispatched a special delivery letter to
Sears-Roebuck and Co. ordering a "Cali
fornia whip" just like the one Fairbanks
uses. As a result of the picture whips
twenty feet long should have a vogue ex
ceeding that had by pogo sticks, put and
take tops, or Fords. Next to an Fncyclo
pedia of Universal Information one of
these whips seems to be the most useful
things ever devised by the mind of man.
Don Q "the man from California" ("Stan
ford hadn't been founded then) cracks his
whip and makes all Spain stand on its head
and yodel for him. He ropes mad bulls,
scales walls, routs armies, saves the he
roine, lights his stogie, cuts himself a
piece of cake, grates cheese and gets into
trouble and out of it all with his educated
whip which does everything but talk. At
times he supplements it with a little nifty
sword play.
That Fairbanks plays the parts of both
Don Q and his father, the immortal Zorro,
might never be suspected for the old man
Zorro can still fight off twenty men and
take note of the fact that his son is a
"chip of the old block." It's an open ques
tion if, in an open contest, Zorro could
outfox Don Qor vice versa. We think it
would be a tie with Zorro a shade to the
good because of experience. But then,
of course, Q has that tricky whip.
Mary Astor makes a very appealing
heroine and does not overdo her part nor
get too awfully shocked at the Don's
rapid fire courtship methods. The pic
ture drags slightly for the first half, but
as soon as the nimble Don gets into trou
ble for having supposedly knifed a visit
ing Austrian potentate tilings begin hap
pening so fast that his father, Zorro,
comes all the way from sunny California
to Spain just to be in on tlie excitement
and gets there just in time.
The photography is excellent and Fair
banks is more lively than ever. In his
next picturc he will probably stop using
the pavement altogether and travel only
by leaping from roof to roof and limb to
limb, unless he can snag a comet with his
whip and we would not be surprised even
at that
The atmosphere of the prologue was
most prologuish and shouldn't be missed.
Thursday night vaudeville performances
will be continued.
