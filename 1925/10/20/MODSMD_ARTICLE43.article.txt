# SPORTS OF 1925

### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Consider the case of Lou Young, now in his third year as coach of the
University of Pennsylvania football team. Beginning with October 1 Mr.
Young scheduled Brown, Yale, Chicago, and Illinois on successive Saturdays.
Already his football pupils have defeated Brown and Yale, and only last
Sunday a well-known eastern sport writer hailed them as the greatest team
in the country. After these games follow merely Haverford, Pittsburgh, and
Cornell in order, which must seem rather a relief after the slam-bang affairs
of October.
■"Oh, woe is me!" Young must moan as he looks at his October schedule.
Four such games! Colorful, too, from Brown, through the Blue of Yale, the
Maroon of Chicago, to "Red" Grange of Illinois. Brown has beaten Harvard
the last three years, Yale went through the last two seasons undefeated,
Chicago was the 1924 Western Conference champion, and Illinois has the
greatest offensive player of the last decade. Can Pennsylvania stop Grange?
Penn couldn't stop Imlay of California, not nearly as great a football player
as Grange.
But Lou Young is not inclined to be pessimistic, like his rival, Gil Dobie, of
Cornell. He was a former Red and Blue player himself, and has a way with
him that instills both his football knowledge and his fighting spirit into his
men. His record as a coach speaks for itself. In his second year at Penn the
Quakers were undefeated in the East in ten games. Cornell was trimmed 20
[ to 0. Coach Young and Penn have given a good account of themselves so far,
and will continue to do so despite their tough schedule.
