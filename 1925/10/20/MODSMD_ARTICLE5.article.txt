# CUBBERLY TALKS ON CHANGED CONCEPTION OF CHILD EDUCATION
## 
### 
"The schools are no longer looking
for things to teach hut are trying to
eliminate the useful facts from the
unnecessary ones. What does a child
need most in his after life? is the
question educators are asking them
selves," said Dr. Cubberly in his
speech before the Education Club this
evening. He spoke on the principle
historical and economic forces in the
nineteenth century which led to the
development of education. This devel
opment was divided into four divi
sions: the conception of democracy,
discovery of science, the application of
science, and new humanitarian.
The beginning of the conception of
democracy is found in the American
and French Revolutions. To keep this
spirit burning among the people edu
cation was needed and schools were
established. Germany was the founder
of this means of manufacturing na
tionality and France adopted it in
reconstruction after the Franco-Prus
sian war. America uses it in her as
similation of foreigners.
A new humanitarism gave largely
to education. When the manufacturing
was first started in England child la
bor was almost wholly employed.
There was no legal regulation of child
life or education. With the develop
ment extension of industry, it was
seen that there was no use in wearing
out a life when it was at its lowest
step of efficiency, that it was better
to conserve and save it until it reached
its liigest efficiency. "Every child is
either an asset or a liability. To turn
children into as many assets as pos
sible is the work of the public school."
