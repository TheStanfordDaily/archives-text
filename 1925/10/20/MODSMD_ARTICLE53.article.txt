# UNIVERSITY SHELL COLLECTION SECOND LARGEST IN WORLD
## 
### 
Containing 14,000 species and varie
ties, the Stanford shell collection is
the second largest of its kind in the
world, being exceeded in size only by
that of the National Museum at Wash
ington, D. C.
All the marine shells have been cata
logued and separated into specimens
which now total 200,000, of which the
largest part are from the Pacific Coast.
The first important addition to the col
lection was made in 1915 when the
Henry Hemphill collection of 6,000
species was secured by the University.
Other important additions are the
Streeter collection of land and water
species from the southern waters of
the United States, the William
Schulte collection, and 6,000 species
from British Columbia presented by
George W. Taylor, of Nanaimo, 13. C.
When Mrs. Ida S. Oldroyd became
curator of the collection in 1916, the
Oldroyd collection of 10,000 species
and 50,000 specimens were added.
Mrs. Oldroyd is a recognized world
authority on the shells of the Pacific
Coast region and has spent most of
her life studying marine conchology.
She is the author of two publications
on the subject. Material for one of the
books was gathered during seven suc
cessive summers at the Friday Harbor
Biological Station of the University of
Washington on Puget Sound.
The Stanford University Press print
ed two volumes by Mrs. Oldroyd this
spring on the subject of Pacific Coast
shells. Mrs. Oldroyd is now in New
York City classifying specimens of the
American Museum of Natural History
collection. She has worked also this
summer in the conchology section of
the United States National Museum
at Washington, U. C.
Thomas S. Oldroyd, husband of the
curator, is the assistant curator of the
collection and is the author of a pub
lication of the United States National
Museum entitled "Fossils of the Lower
Fauna of the Nob Hill Cut, San Pedro,
California." In a recent paper of tho
National Museum, the Oldroyds are
declared to be the highest authorities
on the subject fo Pacific Coast shells.
A laboratory for graduate students
and a conchology library are located
in the collection room which is found
on the third floor of the Geology build
ing. Photographs of scientific authori
ties, many of which are autographed,
decorate the walls.

Oldroyd collection of 10,000 species
and 50,000 specimens were added.
Mrs. Oldroyd is a recognized world
authority on the shells of the Pacific
Coast region and has spent most of
her life studying marine conchology.
She is the author of two publications
on the subject. Material for one of the
books was gathered during seven suc
cessive summers at the Friday Harbor
Biological Station of the University of
Washington on Puget Sound.
The Stanford University Press print
ed two volumes by Mrs. Oldroyd this
spring on the subject of Pacific Coast

National Museum, the Oldroyds are
declared to be the highest authorities
on the subject fo Pacific Coast shells.
A laboratory for graduate students
and a conchology library are located
in the collection room which is found
on the third floor of the Geology build
ing. Photographs of scientific authori
ties, many of which are autographed,
decorate the walls.
R. H. Palmer, who last March classi
fied a collection of 200 varieties of
shells gathered at Puerto Angel, Mex
ico, lias recently presented another
collection to the department.
Containing 14,000 species and varie
ties, the Stanford shell collection is
the second largest of its kind in the
world, being exceeded in size only by
that of the National Museum at Wash
ington, D. C.
All the marine shells have been cata
logued and separated into specimens
which now total 200,000, of which the
largest part are from the Pacific Coast.
The first important addition to the col
