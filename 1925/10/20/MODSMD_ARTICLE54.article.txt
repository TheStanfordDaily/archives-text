! The Editor, Sir:
I am interested in a report by last
.Sunday's Chronicle of the views of
Mrs. Snell, the appointment secretary,
on the progress women have made in
; the business and professional world.
Mrs. Snell's praise of the modern wo*
| man's method of progress is no doubt
well founded, but the question I wish
j to raise is whether we want our wo
i men of intelligence in the business
] and professional phases of life. In
! other words is the ideal role for the
j women in life the same as that for the
men ?
I It seems that in this age of work
with the mind rather than the muscle,
women of intelligence are attracted
! so strongly by occupations other than
the one that is especially theirs (the
raising of the family), that this femi
nine duty, so vital for the well-being
of the race and nation, is often not
considered any more. I grant that the
raising of the offspring is no more the
woman's duty than the man's, but the
woman's part in this duty can be ac
complished in only one way, whereas
the man's share can be done in any
way he may choose to support the
lamily. If then it doesn't make any
particular difference whether the man
is a doctor, a business man, or a law
yer, the problem of selecting a "life
work' is a perfectly logical one for
the young man to consider. But when
the young woman doesn't know wheth
er she wants to be a lawyer, a trained
nurse, or a journalist, it is immediately
apparent that she has forgotten the
place in the world that she happens Jo
be meant for.
Therefore, when Mrs. Snell lauds the
women for the progress they have
made in business and the professions,
isn t liei praise based on a false as
sumption? R g ft
