# SUBWAYS PLANNED
## 
### 
Two subways are being tentatively
planned, the first to be constructed
under the Southern Pacific tracks at
the University Avenue intersection,
and the second at the Embarcadero
Road crossing. Experts representing
the State Railroad and Highway Com
mission, the Southern Pacific and
Peninsular Railway Companies, and
the city of Palo Alto held a meeting
yesterday to consider plans for the
subway under the S. P. tracks. The
suggested Embarcadero Road subway
will relieve the heavy traffic which,
according to Professor C. B. Wing of
Stanford, who represents the city, is
becoming intolerable.
