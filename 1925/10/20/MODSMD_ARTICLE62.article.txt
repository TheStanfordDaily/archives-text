# FRANCK CHORALE TO BE ON PROGRAM OF THURSDAY'S RECITAL
## 
### 
"Chorale in A minor," one of the
last of Cesar Franck's compositions,
will be the first number of the organ
recital to be given at 4 o'clock Thurs
day afternoon in the Memorial Church
by Warren I). Allen, University organ
ist. Franck wrote three great Chorales
of which this is the last and one of
the finest of his organ works.
One of the best known of the works
of J. S. Bach is the so-called "Air for
the G String," which will also be
played. In contrast to most of Bach's
involved polyphonic music this is noth
ing more than a pleasing melody of
charm and simplicity.
"Chanson sail Paroles" (Song With
out Words) is by Peter Ilyitch Tchai
kowsky, the Russian composer whose
symphonic works are becoming in
creasingly popular in this country be
cause of their melodic beauty and emo
tion. "Song of the Chrysanthemum"
was composed by the French musician,
Joseph Bonnet. He is now organist of
St. Eustache, a position won in compe
tition with many other players. Bonnet
has toured ail over Europe and was
enthusiastically received in the United.
States on a visit here in 1917.
The closing number will be "Concert
Overture in C Minor," by William
Faulkes.
