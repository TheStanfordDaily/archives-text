# OUTCOME OF GAME WITH SAINTS MAKES BEARS CONFIDENT
## California Must Work Hard To Remedy Weakness Of Forward Wall 
### 
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA,
Oct. 20. â€”By defeating Saint Mary's by
the score of 6-0 last Saturday the Uni-!
versity of California football team has !
, once more been placed in the confi- j
dence of the football world.
With the sting of defeat still fresh |
in their minds, the Golden Bears left}
their lair Saturday fighting mad, to
defeat "Slip" Madigan's charges. The 1
game was a nip-and-tuck affair from 1
i start to finish, and the winner was :
always in doubt. After the Bruins had
I scored a touchdown, and but a few
remaining moments were left to be
i played, doubt still existed as to the
I final score.
Although depicting considerable iin- j
| provement, the California squad has
j by no means perfected an impregnable !
j defense. The backfield has not been j
| giving Coach Smith much trouble, but j
| the line has been causing considerable I
| worry. Starting the season with an all-!
| veteran group, the Bears were con-1
I ceded of having the best line aggrega-!
I tion in the state. Whether due to over- 1
! confidence or to the fact that competi- i
! tign is stronger, the Bruin line has j
not been showing up to good advan-!
tage. This was evident in the Olympic j
game. However, as the old adage goes, !
by mistakes we profit. Andy Smith has j
taken into account the mistakes and j
has corrected the more outstanding i
ones. Before the Big Game conies the '
team will be working in better unison.
