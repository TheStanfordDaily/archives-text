# EUPHRONIA SOCIETY TO SPONSOR FORUM ON "TRADITIONS"
## Debaters to Present Every Important Custom in Brief Address 
### 
Euphronia Debating Society will
sponsor its first open forum discussion
of the year at a meeting which will be
•open to the campus tonight at 7:30
o'clock in the lobby of the Old Union.
•'Campus Traditions" will be the sub
ject for discussion.
Members of the society will present
■each of the more important Stanford
traditions for discussion by the audi
ence in the form of a motion that the
tradition be abolished. Supporters of
both sides of the motion will then be
given their opportunity to advance
arguments for or against the tradition
in question. At the close of the dis
cussion, an audience vote will be taken
on the motion. In this way Euphronia
will attempt to obtain an opinion of
the students as to the observance of
•Stanford traditions.
Among the traditions which will be
discussed are: "hello," dinks, pajama
rino, mud fight, freshman "queening,"
women's smoking, law steps, smoking
on the Quad, roughs, and Encina raids.
George N. Crocker, president of the
society, will preside.
The series of open forums on cam
pus problems which Euphronia spon
sored last year proved very popular,
and it is expected that several hundred
students will attend tonight's meeting.
The subject of traditions is a vital one,
and in the past has provoked a great
deal of comment.
