# PERFECT TECHNIQUE SHOWN BY ARTIST
## Helen Atkinson Interprets Music Accurately in Violin Recital 
### Herbert Klein 
Helen Engel Atkinson, in her re
cital in the Assembly hall last night,
displayed artistic finish, restraint, and
sureness of technique. She was at all
times perfect master of her instrument
and was technically and physically
capable in the longest and most diffi
cult passages. Her playing was intel
lectual rather than emotional, and
ratlrer at a faithful interpreta
tion of the music, as it was composed,
than a projection of the artist's own
temperament.
Charles Hart, her accompanist, was
eminently capable in his place at the
piano, and kept accurately with Mrs.
Atkinson. The listener always felt the
, violin to be the solo and the piano
the accompanying instrument, al
though there were many passages in
the music in which the two were equal
in importance as the melody and ac
companiment alternated between the
two.
The two sonatas which made up the
program were far from being light
music, but both had sections of great
melodic and rhythmic beauty. The "Al
legro" movement of the "Cesar Franck
Sonata" had some wonderful effects
when Mrs. Atkinson played harmonies
i on two strings. The movement ended
with a motif of calm sadness of super
| lative charm.
The "Brahms Sonata" was in a more
rhapsodical mood, and at times sug
gested that composer's fondness for
' Hungarian dances and rhythms. It ap
peared the more difficult of the two
technically, with rapid variations in
tempo and a sustained energy through
j out that required the utmost from the
j performer. The last movement finished
jin a very brilliant and satisfactory
style.
Mrs. Atkinson will again be seen on
the campus when the San Francisco
| Symphony Orchestra under the direc
tion of Alfred Hertz plays here, for
she has the distinction of being the
| only woman violinist with that organi
zation. She is now starting her third
| year in the orchestra.
The concert was given under the
auspices of the Committee on Public
Exercises.
