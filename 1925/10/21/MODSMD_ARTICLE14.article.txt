# REHEARSALS BEGIN FOR BARRIE'S "DEAR BRUTUS"
## Four Women Will Make Their Debute On Stanford Stage; Sets Unique 
### 
! II7ITH last night's rehearsal preparations began for the repeat performance
! *' of "Dear Brutus" to be given Friday evening in the Assembly hall. Dress
i rehearsals will be held tonight and tomorrow evening.
I All members of the original cast of the summer production were present,
| with the exception of Miss Claire Dawes, who arrived today from Los Angeles
jto take the part of Mrs. Coade. Miss Dawes recently returned from London,
! where she took part in amateur work.

Other women of the cast who are also newcomers to the Stanford stage
are Miss Lucie Bently, in the role of Mrs. Dearth, Miss Marian Roberts as
Mrs. Purdie, and Miss Adelaide Mack, who plays the part of Joanna Trout.
Miss Bently is registered in the University this quarter and Miss Roberts is a
student at San Jose Junior College.
Miss Mack is making a special trip
from Los Angeles, where she is a stu
dent at the University of California,
Southern Branch, to take the part in
"Dear Brutus."

Allen in Star Role
The women's roles in the play are
well distributed, with no outstanding
i lead, although the part of Margaret is
! generally regarded as the stellar role,
in spite of the fact that she appears
only in one act. Miss Marjorie Allen,
j well known in campus dramatics for
several years, will play Margaret. Miss
Allen is remembered for her work in
"Milestones," "Captain Applejack,"
"You and I," and the 1926 Junior Opera
"Ace High." When "Dear Brutus" first
i opened in New York after a long run
in London, Miss Helen Hayes was cast
as Margaret very successfully.
Miss Barbara Eubanks, who plays
Lady Caroline Laney, was in "Mac
! beth," presented here last winter.
Because the amateur rights for
i "Dear Brutus" were originally withheld
lit has not been professionally pro-
I duced often outside of New York, and
Stanford was very fortunate to get
the rights for last summer's produc
tion. The demands for acting and set
ting are too great for the usual stock
company, calling for difficult sets and
fantastic lighting effects.
Settings Unique
Gordon Davis, dramatic coach and
director of the play, took photographs
of the settings for "Dear Brutus" with
him when he went to New York the
latter part of the summer. Since the
sets are among the best of their kind
they created great interest in the East,
and will be reproduced shortly in the
Theatre Arts magazine and the Thea
tre magazine.
Leslie Kiler designed the seats,
which consist of a drawing room and
an out-of-door setting in a mythical
dream wood. Dick Fullerton has charge
of the lighting effects which are espe
cially difficult in the dream wood
scene. Miss Chrysella Dunker designed
the costumes.
