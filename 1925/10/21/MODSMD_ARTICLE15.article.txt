# ORGANIST WILL PLAY FRENCH COMPOSER'S WORKS IN RECITAL
## 
### Music Critic 
A notable program has been ar
ranged by Warren D. Allen, University
organist, for tomorrow afternoon's re
cital in the Memorial Church at 4:15
o'clock. Cesar Franck, the outstanding
French organ composer of modern
times, wrote three great "Chorales."
The last one in A minor, composed just
before his death, will open the pro
gram.
The simple and satisfying melody of
John Sebastian Bach's "Air for G
String" will be heard in all its charm.
This composition depends only upon
its natural beauty and attractiveness
for the hold it has taken upon music
lovers.
Tchaikowsky's "Song Without
Words" ("Chanson sans Paroles") is
another work of melodic beauty, such
as the famous Russian composer was
able to write from his great fund of
melody.
"Song of the Chrysanthemum" by
Joseph Bonnet was suggested to its
composer by the offering of a chrysan
themum flower upon an altar. Bonnet
has written a great many organ works,
and is well known as a result of his
frequent tours. He played in America
in 1917 and has made many successful
tours in Europe. He is a pupil of
Guilmant.
William Faulkes' "Convert Overture
in C Minor" will close the recital.
