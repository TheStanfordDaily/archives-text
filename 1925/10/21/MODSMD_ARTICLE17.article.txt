R. Smith, editor, said today. "It is
founded 011 the theory that amuse
ment is the highest form of educa
tion and will be purely literary.
There will be 110 attempt to give a
higher education to anybody."
All contributions should be ad
dressed to the editor. The first is
sue of the magazine will be pub
lished about December 15, and all
contributions for this edition should
be in by November 20, according to
Smith.
The "Lit" will be published
monthly and will contain essays,
short stories, verse, editorials, and
dramatic and book reviews.
There has been no purely literary
magazine published 011 the campus
for several years. The editors hope
that they will be able to fill the
demand for such a magazine.
