# ADDITION OF SPENCER, WORK STRENGTHENS 1926 TRACK SQUAD
## Two 1927 Frosh Stars Report To Templeton for Fall Quarter Workouts 
### 
Stanford's varsity track prospects
were materially brightened this week
when it was announced that two 1927
freshman stars who did not compete
last year are now reporting for fall
practice and will be candidates for the
varsity this spring.
Bud Spencer, stellar 220 man and
low hurdler, and Clarence West, cap
tain of the '27 aggregation and a capa
ble performer in the hurdles and high
jump, are the two men expected to
add points to the Cardinal scores this
season.
Former Prep Champion
Spencer, a former national inter
scholastic low hurdle champion, won
both the low hurdles and 440 against
the California frosh two years ago.
Due to injuries received in an automo
bile accident in the spring of 1924, he
was unable to compete last year, but
is said to be fully recovered now. He is
expected to help fill the shoes of
Swede Leistner in the hurdles, and is
also figured as a valuable 440 and relay
runner.
West was the all-round performer of
the 1927 squad. In addition to his work
in the high and low hurdles, he was
usually good for places in the broad
and high jumps.
Strengthen Weak Spot
He won the high hurdle event in the
Little Big Meet in 15 4-5 seconds, and
also took third in the high jump, which
was won by Work, of Stanford, at 6
feet 2 inches.
The addition of these two men will
go far toward strengthening what had
been looked upon as the weak spot of
the 1926 varsity—the hurdles. The
graduation of Swede Leistner last year
had apparently left Stanford without
outstanding performers in either hur
dle event, but with West and Spencer
on deck, the Cards look much stronger
in these races.
