# FIRST INTERCLASS FOOTBALL CONTEST SET FOR SATURDAY
## 
### 
Interclass football will make its de
but Saturday morning at 9:30 o'clock
on the freshman practice field when
the juniors tackle the seniors, and the
freshmen the sophomores, in the first
games of the series to determine the
-winner of the silver cup trophy.
The seniors, due to their weight and
experience, and the freshmen, because
of their careful coaching and constant
practice, are favored to win the cup.
The 1927 team, which has won the cup
for the last two years, is greatly
Aveakened by the loss of most of its
men, who have been promoted to the
varsity squad.
The sophomores are doped to receive
a bad trimming from Harry Shipkey's
freshmen, as scarcely enough men
have reported as yet to make up a
full team, while the freshman team is
to a large extent composed entirely of
those men who have failed to make
the first freshman team. Yesterday the
freshmen played the William Warren
school and had little trouble in win
ning.
The seniors, under the tutelage of
Murray Cuddeback, have been going
through some stiff workouts, and give
promise of becoming a smoothly run
ning machine. Rosenbaum, Mannoccir,
Wolf, and Brown help compose a heavy
and experienced line, while Fuller, Mc-
Hose, and Copelen in the backfield
make up a combination that should be
hard to beat.
Both the sophomore and junior
teams are in dire need of more men,
and any last-minute entries will be
gladly welcomed by them.
