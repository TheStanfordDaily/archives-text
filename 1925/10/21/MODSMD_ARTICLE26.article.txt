Recently the Daily Palo Alto called attention to the fact that few
automobiles, bicycles, or wagons being driven upon the campus are
equipped with red rear signal lights. University authorities and county
traffic officers will attain a definite, material result if they will subrogate
arrests for open muffllers and slight speed excesses to the enforcement
of the hitherto overlooked rule requiring safety devices.
Any sober driver can control his car going thirty-five miles an hour
on Palm Drive, provided that his brakes and lights are functioning
properly. Open mufflers are harmless when the car is being driven on
unpeopled parts of the campus. However, traffic officers, looking to
the easiest thing they can do, spend their time hiding in bushes to catch
cars going by in a slight excess of the speed law, forgetting that cars
passing at a slower rate may be much more unsafe because of inferior
brakes.
The California Motor Vehicle Act says in Chapter XIV, Paragraph 64,
"Every motor vehicle must at all times be equipped with adequate brakes
in good working order. It is a misdemeanor to violate this rule, punish
able by a fine not exceeding $500 or by imprisonment in the county jail
for not exceeding six months, or by both such fine and imprisonment."
Wouldn't it be a good plan to start checking up on brakes and head
lights and forget about speeding, short of reckless driving, in the mean
time? The so-called ''collegiate" automobiles are usually rickety affairs.
The lights are poor and the brakes are worse. This is the root of the
trouble, and if the officers can force these automobiles to secure the
proper equipment the campus will be a much safer place—and this goal
can be reached by harmless law enforcement rather than maddening
arrests for nothing.
