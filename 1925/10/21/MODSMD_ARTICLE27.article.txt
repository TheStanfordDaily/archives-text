# Training Rule Violations
## 
### 
Persistent rumors have been circulating - throughout the campus for
some time that some of the members of the varsity football squad are
not living up to the training rules laid down by the coaches. Everyone
knows that it is a rule in every college and university in the land that
athletes in training should abstain from the use of tobacco and alcoholic
drinks and should not keep late hours.
We have the honor system here at Stanford and members of athletic
teams who violate training rules deserve vastly more censure than men
who cheat in their examinations because they are not only hurting them
selves but they are injuring the team's chances of success and violating
the trust the coaches and the students have placed in them.
The Daily Palo Alto believes that the students who encourage or
wink at sly cigarette smoking and drinking on the part of a member of
the football squad is just as guilty as the athlete himself and it also be
lieves that it is the duty of every student who sees a flagrant violation
of the training rules not only to remonstrate with the athlete himself but
to report the breach of trust to the coaches. Our athletic teams represent
the whole student body—they belong to the students and the sudents
have a right to expect that every man who has the honor of representing
them and Stanford on the athletic field shall live up to the standards set
for athletes in every other institution of any standing and we should
insist upon strict adherence to the simple rule of training instead of
winking at their violation as has been done in many instances in the past.
It is up to the students as well as the athletes themselves to combat
this growing evil which, if allowed to continue, is likely to very seriously
interfere with Stanford's success on the athletic field.
Russia has returned to its afternoon vodka and Trotsky, Smithsky, and
Jonesky are giving three cheers and a tiger for their late" release from
freedom. On this side of the Atlantic, Russians are reported to be giving
three near-beers and a blind tiger.
An English society girl has just been presented, on her twenty-first birthday,

college and compete with her co-ed sisters in their supposed work of sub
jugating the college man.
Caddies will not be physically or morally injured by working on golf links
in Lincoln, Neb., according to a decision by the Compensation Commissioner
of that state. Perhaps not physically, but it has been rumored that golf
players swear occasionally and it seems only proper that the rumor should be
investigated before the Commissioner's decision is endorsed.

An English society girl has just been presented, on her twenty-first birthday,
■with a gun and gun case by her father. She is now fit to enter an American
college and compete with her co-ed sisters in their supposed work of sub
jugating the college man.
Caddies will not be physically or morally injured by working on golf links
in Lincoln, Neb., according to a decision by the Compensation Commissioner
of that state. Perhaps not physically, but it has been rumored that golf
players swear occasionally and it seems only proper that the rumor should be
investigated before the Commissioner's decision is endorsed.
Persistent rumors have been circulating - throughout the campus for
some time that some of the members of the varsity football squad are
not living up to the training rules laid down by the coaches. Everyone
knows that it is a rule in every college and university in the land that
athletes in training should abstain from the use of tobacco and alcoholic
drinks and should not keep late hours.
We have the honor system here at Stanford and members of athletic
teams who violate training rules deserve vastly more censure than men
who cheat in their examinations because they are not only hurting them
selves but they are injuring the team's chances of success and violating
the trust the coaches and the students have placed in them.
The Daily Palo Alto believes that the students who encourage or
wink at sly cigarette smoking and drinking on the part of a member of
the football squad is just as guilty as the athlete himself and it also be
lieves that it is the duty of every student who sees a flagrant violation
of the training rules not only to remonstrate with the athlete himself but
to report the breach of trust to the coaches. Our athletic teams represent
the whole student body—they belong to the students and the sudents
have a right to expect that every man who has the honor of representing
them and Stanford on the athletic field shall live up to the standards set
for athletes in every other institution of any standing and we should
insist upon strict adherence to the simple rule of training instead of
winking at their violation as has been done in many instances in the past.
It is up to the students as well as the athletes themselves to combat
this growing evil which, if allowed to continue, is likely to very seriously
interfere with Stanford's success on the athletic field.
Russia has returned to its afternoon vodka and Trotsky, Smithsky, and
Jonesky are giving three cheers and a tiger for their late" release from
freedom. On this side of the Atlantic, Russians are reported to be giving
three near-beers and a blind tiger.
