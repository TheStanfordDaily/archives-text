# TRADITION BROKEN
## 
### 
Yale tradition has been radically
broached by the appointment of Miss
Ettalene Mears Grice as assistant pro
fessor of Assyriology and Babylonian
literature. Heretofore no women have
been made full professors at Yale,
with the exception of the School of
Medicine, and only one other assistant
professor, who is in the department
of education.
