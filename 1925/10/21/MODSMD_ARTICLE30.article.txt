# FOUR P. A. A. AQUATIC EVENTS SCHEDULED IN STANFORD POOL
## Cardinal Swimmers to Try for First Position in Year's Competition 
### Jack Kilen 
Ernst Brandsten, coach of aquatic
sports, has announced that the four
P. A. A. swimming events will be held
Friday afternoon, October 31, in the
Encina pool. The championship races
to be held at that time are the 220-
yard breaststroke, 150-yard backstroke,
500-yard free style, and the pentathlon.
The pentathlon contains five events
in itself, all of which are to be swum
off on the same afternoon. Competitors
in this event will swim three races
consisting of 100 yards each of back
stroke, breaststroke, and crawl, and a
500-yard free style event.
The other event in the pentathlon
is a diving competition of five dives.
The competitor who makes the best
average in all events wins, as in the
track pentathlon.
Cards in All Events
Stanford will have entries in all
events and will make a strenuous ef
fort to pile up enough points to take
away the lead of one marker which
the Olympic Club now holds in the
year's P .A. A. events. The score is at
present, Olympic Club 22, Stanford 21,
as a result of the meet recently held
at the San Francisco Elks Club when
the Winged "O" relay team defeated
Stanford by a scant six inches.
Carl Stevenson, Cardinal middle and
long distance swimming star, will com
pete in the 150-yard backstroke and
the 500-yard free style. His chances in
both look good. Ted Smith and prob
ably Bob Williams will enter the pen
tathlon. Smith is regularly a diver
and should easily take first in his
favorite event. He is now training for
the four swimming races.
Allen in Breaststroke
Arden Allen, water polo captain for
this year and all-around swimmer, will
compete in the 150 yard backstroke
and the 220-yard breaststroke. Allen
has, during the summer, developed
into a first-rate breast-stroker, coming
down from 1:27 last spring to about
1:15 or 1:16 at the present time for
the century. His greatest rival will be
Littlefield, of Stockton, the boy who
breast-stroked his way into seventh
; place in the recent Golden Gate swim,
defeating many experienced overhand
swimmers. Allen's turn is one of his
great assets, and he may be able to
defeat Littlefield by his ability to do
a faster "about face" at the end of
each lap. Herb Klein, of last year's
frosh team, will also swim in this
event.
O'Connor Ineligible
Wally O'Connor is ineligible for
these and other P. A. A. events, as his
residence is in Southern California,
where he has won S. P. A. district
championships during the summer. A.
A. U. rules do not allow a man to
! compete in swimming events of more
than one district without a three
months' interval for change of regis
tration. Colin Smith, a transfer from
the South, will also be ineligible for
this reason. Partially equalizing the
loss of these men is the fact that Les
ter Smith, the Olympic Club's best bet j
at practically any distance, is on a
swimming tour in Hawaii and will be j
absent at the time of the meet. He is j
Pacific Coast champion at 500 yards i
and would probably take that event if
entered. As it is, Stevenson should get
first without much trouble.
On the evening of November 6 the
last P. A. A. events of the year will be
staged by the Athens Club of Oakland
in its new 36 by 110-foot pool. The
events will be 50- and 100-yard free
style, high springboard diving, and the
400-yard relay. Stanford should be able
to enter the winning relay team, al
though it will be a close battle with
the Olympics. Doug Ackerman, who
has returned to college this year, and I
Congo Carlsmith will be Stanford's J
best bets in the 50, with Bob Williams i
and possibly Carl Stevenson in the 100. !
