# CAMPUS OPINION

The Editor, Sir:
A point system suited to the needs
of Stanford women would go far to
ward giving every woman an equal
opportunity to participate in outside
activities. The number of offices open
to women would be more evenly dis
tributed, and the tendency of a small
minority to manage activities would
be lessened. The number of points al
lowed should be liberal, so that activ
ity is not limited unreasonably. At
least such a system would give oppor
tunity to the majority rather than the
| minority. The increase of efficiency
in campus organizations is one of the
chief advantages of a point system.
The overworked leader does nothing
well, whereas by an equal division of
activity each leader has enough to do
thoroughly and efficiently and no
more, —j2. j)
The Editor, Sir:
The present intellectual controversy
that is raging over the question of
whether women of the campus should
exhibit the amiability of sisters in the
pursuit of General Culture, or presarve
the lofty social distinction to which
their haute monde inheritance and con
genital opacity entitles them, has
reached a depth of asininity which I
believe is only possible among Ameri
can college illuminati.
I can think of only one thing more
pitiable than a woman who feels that
she should restrict the field of those
who benefit by her pearls of conver
sation and that is a man who wor
ries about it. The general type of con
versation indulged in by the feminine
gelehrten of this village should make
Harvard ex-'23 feel profoundly grate
ful that they deny him their charming
society. A few minutes eavesdropping
on some of the pithy conversation that
takes place in the lobby of the library
should convince the average man that
the topics discussed by these erudite
ladies are distinctively their own. If
it intrigues Mr. ex-'23 to listen to the
gairulous clack—however, I presume
that those who can generate warmth
over such trivial and fatuous nonsense
as this controversy would be interested
in anything, even a dramatic recital of
what the barber did to her latest hob,
or such original and brilliant remarks
as, "Don't you think it's all right for
women to smoke—once in a Avhile, I
mean?" followed by an enchanting con
vulsion of the left eye, which, I pre
sume, is meant to be coy and coquet
tish.
If it amuses them, I suppose it is all
right. Some people can spend a whole
day throwing peanuts to monkeys—
and monkeys can spend a whole day
catching them. —S. P. H.
