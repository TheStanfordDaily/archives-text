# DAY'S DOINGS
## 
### Ted Elias, Jr 
Things are happeing all around us,
Things are happening that is true,
And the ones who read the "DIPPY,"
Know who they are happening to.
Brain storms on the Stanford campus,
Now can exercise the bean.
Looking over and discussing.
Our new "high brow" magazine."
Everyone should buy a copy,
As a tester for the brain,
Just to see if they are on
A higher intellectual plane.
Now the cast has been selected
For the play named "Goose Hangs
High."
Keep your shirts on, fellow students,
By and by you'll buy and buy.
Soon the fellows in short panties
Get a chance to strut their stuff,
Chasing golf balls 'round the circuit;
Let us hope they don't play rough.
Trojan freshmen play our youngsters,
Hoping to avenge defeat.
But this is going to be OUR year.
And Stanford teams will not retreat.
Applications due for tickets
For the California game;
Put your money up today.
Or you will have yourself to blame.
Varsity will take its workout.
Humbling Aggies from the north;
If we still have any weakness,
Saturday will bring it forth.
California beat Saint Mary'sâ€”
They are awfully proud of that,
But when Nevers hits their line,
They'll wonder where their team is at.
