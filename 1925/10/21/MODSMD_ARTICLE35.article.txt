Scientific Fumbling
Fumbling reduced to a science can
add many extraordinary thrills to an
ordinary football game. All football
coaches should devote at least one
night a week to fumble practice. There
are many ways to do the fumble, but
perhaps the simplest way is to balance
the ball on the tip of the little finger
on line plays and on the knuckle of
the first finger before throwing a pass.
The ball is then dropped lightly with
the point to the ground and given a
gentle kick with the side of the foot
in the direction desired.
One or two men should always be in
readiness to recover the fumble. To
facilitate this it is advisable to have
either the two guards or tackles shift
so as to face the backfield men when
a fumble play is to be made. Using
this method, teams adept at fumbling
have advanced the ball as much as
fifteen yards on a single play. To ac
complish this, the man who does the
fumbling lets the ball roll along the
ground until a member of the opuosing
team is about to fall on it. He then
kicks it out into the open and con
tinues until the referee blows his
whistle.
A very effective play is the serial
fumble. This is begun in the same way
a* the ordinary fumble, but the man
who recovers the ball picks it up and
runs until he is tackled, when he fum
bles again. A teammate running beside
him then recovers the ball and runs
on until he in turn is tackled. The ball
is then recovered by still another man,
and so on. I have seen the ball carried
the length of the field for a touchdown
on a serial fumble play. A clever quar
ter should sense the psychological mo
ment to call for a fumble play. If the
opposing line proves impenetrable, a
short line-bucking fumble is sometimes
effective. The fullback carries the ball
to the line and then fumbles it, taking
care to kick it through the opposing
team to a man waiting on the other
side to recover it. A fumble play
usually assures a score when a team is
within its opponents' ten-yard line. The
ball is fumbled and knocked over the
goal line when either six or two points
are assured.

add many extraordinary thrills to an
ordinary football game. All football
coaches should devote at least one
night a week to fumble practice. There
are many ways to do the fumble, but
perhaps the simplest way is to balance
the ball on the tip of the little finger
on line plays and on the knuckle of
the first finger before throwing a pass.
The ball is then dropped lightly with
the point to the ground and given a
gentle kick with the side of the foot
in the direction desired.
One or two men should always be in
readiness to recover the fumble. To
facilitate this it is advisable to have
either the two guards or tackles shift
so as to face the backfield men when
a fumble play is to be made. Using
this method, teams adept at fumbling
have advanced the ball as much as
fifteen yards on a single play. To ac
complish this, the man who does the
fumbling lets the ball roll along the
ground until a member of the opuosing
team is about to fall on it. He then
kicks it out into the open and con
tinues until the referee blows his
whistle.
A very effective play is the serial
fumble. This is begun in the same way
a* the ordinary fumble, but the man
who recovers the ball picks it up and
runs until he is tackled, when he fum
bles again. A teammate running beside
him then recovers the ball and runs
on until he in turn is tackled. The ball
is then recovered by still another man,
and so on. I have seen the ball carried
the length of the field for a touchdown
on a serial fumble play. A clever quar
ter should sense the psychological mo
ment to call for a fumble play. If the
opposing line proves impenetrable, a
short line-bucking fumble is sometimes
effective. The fullback carries the ball
to the line and then fumbles it, taking
care to kick it through the opposing
team to a man waiting on the other
side to recover it. A fumble play
usually assures a score when a team is
within its opponents' ten-yard line. The
ball is fumbled and knocked over the
goal line when either six or two points
are assured.
