(On Meeting)
SHE—
Heavens! You're a big, strong man!
Oh, how you've grown, and say,
You're almost twice as handsome as
The day you went away!
MY!
HE—
And you—you're very beautiful.
And different, my dear,
I didn't think you'd change so much—
It's only been a vear!
WELL!
SHE—(In Private) —
Oh, Lord, that dumbell's back again;
He'll be an awful pest;
And Jim will hear it—Oh, the fool,
I can't be at my best!
He—(In Private) —
The little cat is just the same,
And homelier than ever—
To think, I thought her cute last year—
She isn't even clever!
HELL! —L. A. B.
