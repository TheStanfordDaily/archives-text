# TWENTY YEARS AGO

### 
Nevada found the varsity afflicted
by its usual annual slump, and al
though Saturday's game resulted in a
victory for the Cardinal by the sub
stantial score of 21 to 0, the playing
of the Stanford team was anything
but satisfactory to its supporters. The
teamwork of the visitors was ragged,
and their tendency to fumble the ball
was in a large measure responsible
for two of the touchdowns made by
the varsity.

Preparation for the production of
"The Beauty Shop" in the Assembly
hall on the night of the varsity game
is being rapidly pushed forward by
the undergraduate committee.

At a meeting of the class treasurers
held Friday in Encina hall, a definite
system for the keeping of class financ
es was agreed upon.
The plans of the treasurers provide
for a cash book, a voucher book, and
one or two receipt books for each
class. The cash book must contain a
record of all receipts and expenditures
and must be balanced at stated inter
vals.

Editorial—About as poor an exhibi
tion of rooting as ever took place upon
a Stanford field was given Saturday.
The attempt of the yell leaders to ex
tract a regular yell from the so-called
rooting section was pitiful. The root
ing at the Nevada game was a posi
tive disgrace to the University. This
matter of rooting has been harped on
and criticized for so long that the
student body seems to feel that poor
rooting is the proper thing, and that
articles admonishing them to wake up
are unavoidable, and a set custom, as
much as the yelling itself. One thing
is certain: that unless the rooters do
display some life and spirit they will
be a positive disgrace to the Univer
sity on the day of the Big Game. Ne
vada must have thought that our root
ing section was to be admired when
the University Band out-yelled the
whole section, and when the voices of
the three yell leaders were heard plain
ly above the noise of the bleachers.
The rooters were lacking in volume at
the freshman game; but if any more
exhibitions of yelling take place like
that of Saturday, it will be best to
abolish rooting, and confine ourselves
to hand-clapping.
