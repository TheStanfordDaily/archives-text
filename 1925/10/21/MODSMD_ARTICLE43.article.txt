# WOMEN WILL ARGUE UPON POINT SYSTEM'S MERITS
## Student's Opinions Will Be Sought On Council's Plan At Assembly 
### 
The adoption of a point system to
govern women's activities at Stanford
will be the main subject for discussion
at the women's assembly to be held
next Tuesday at 9 o'clock. The point
aystem is presented by Women's Coun
cil and sponsored by Women's Confer
ence, as something the women should
consider and discuss. They then should
decide on its practicability at Stan
ford.
In order to determine if Stanford
women are interested in the point sys
tem at all, Women's Conference de
cided upon the following question to
be debated and voted upon at the
assembly Tuesday: "A committee shall
be appointed to draw up a point sys
tem which will be voted upon by the
women in the regular student election
in February, 1926." If this motion is
carried, a committee will be formed to
draw up a point system they think
practical for Stanford. The question of
the actual adoption of a point system
would not come up until the regular
student elections in February.
Opinions Sought
At the assembly there will be free
discussion of the advisability of any
restriction on a woman's participation
in activities. Any woman who has an
opinion on the subject is asked to be
there to give her viewpoint. All women
are urged to attend this meeting, as
the adoption of this system would af
fect every Stanford woman. At the
close of the hour of discussion, a secret
ballot will be taken on the question
brought up by Women's Conference,
that there be a committee for further
investigation of a point system.
The two point systems printed below
are samples given so that those women
who do not understand the working
of a point system will have some idea
of the process. These two examples
illustrate different methods of attack
ing the problem. Neither of these sys
tems are up for consideration for adop
tion at Stanford. The work of making
a system for use on this campus would
be in the hands of a committee which
will be appointed if the women decide
Tuesday to look into the situation fur
ther. Systems outlined are as fol
lows :
Number I
No woman may carry over a total of
30 points during a quarter. Floating
points shall be considered as tempor
ary points and lasting only as long as
there is participation in the activity.

The adoption of a point system to
govern women's activities at Stanford
will be the main subject for discussion
at the women's assembly to be held
next Tuesday at 9 o'clock. The point
aystem is presented by Women's Coun
cil and sponsored by Women's Confer
ence, as something the women should
consider and discuss. They then should
decide on its practicability at Stan
ford.
In order to determine if Stanford
women are interested in the point sys
tem at all, Women's Conference de
cided upon the following question to
be debated and voted upon at the
assembly Tuesday: "A committee shall
be appointed to draw up a point sys
tem which will be voted upon by the
women in the regular student election
in February, 1926." If this motion is
carried, a committee will be formed to
draw up a point system they think
practical for Stanford. The question of
the actual adoption of a point system
would not come up until the regular
student elections in February.
Opinions Sought
At the assembly there will be free
discussion of the advisability of any
restriction on a woman's participation
in activities. Any woman who has an
opinion on the subject is asked to be
there to give her viewpoint. All women
are urged to attend this meeting, as
the adoption of this system would af
fect every Stanford woman. At the
close of the hour of discussion, a secret
ballot will be taken on the question
brought up by Women's Conference,
that there be a committee for further
investigation of a point system.
The two point systems printed below
are samples given so that those women
who do not understand the working
of a point system will have some idea
of the process. These two examples
illustrate different methods of attack
ing the problem. Neither of these sys
tems are up for consideration for adop
tion at Stanford. The work of making
a system for use on this campus would
be in the hands of a committee which
will be appointed if the women decide
Tuesday to look into the situation fur
ther. Systems outlined are as fol
lows :
Number I
No woman may carry over a total of
30 points during a quarter. Floating
points shall be considered as tempor
