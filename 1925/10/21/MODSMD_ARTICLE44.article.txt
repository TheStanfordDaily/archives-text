# Chappy Staff Members Organized Hammer and Coffin Before Quake
## 
### Jack Beard 
Six hours before the disastrous San i
Francisco earthquake of 1906 that
razed that city and destroyed many of i
the buildings on the Stanford campus,!
members of the Chaparral staff gath-1
ered together for an informal meeting l
at Menlo Park.
In the fraternal spirit of the occasion i
the staff members organized the pres-1
ent Hammer and Coffin society, which i
was destined to grow into the strong- j
est college comic magazine organiza- j
tion west of the Mississippi. Hammer '
and Coffin was formed to create good '
fellowship among the stall! members, |
and to e: ; f? in the further expansion of i
the magazine.
Until 1919 the organization remained
purely local, but from that time on it ]
expanded rapidly.
At present, the Stanford Chaparral,
the Oregon Lemon Punch, the O. A. C.
Owl, the Washington Columns, and the
California Pelican are the western
members of the organization. The
University of Chicago Phoenix and
the Northwestern University Purple j
Parrot are the only members east of
the Mississippi. Hammer and Coffin is
not a fraternal, but a quasi-fraternal,
organization.
Northcutt Ely of Stanford is presi
dent of the national organization, Wal-;
ter Kamb of Washington, secretary, j
and George Couper of O. A. C., treas-1
urer.
