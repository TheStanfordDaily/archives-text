# Yale Dean Replies to Anti-Chapel Argument
## 
### 
In a recent address before the fresh
man class at Yale, Dean Charles R.
Brown of the Yale University School i
responded to criticism of the compul- i
sory chapel system.
He said he considered daily chapel!
attendance necessary and that every i
student was benefited by it, whether
he enters into the spirit of the service
or not.
"Yale is a Christian institution, so
founded and so maintained for 224
years," said Dean Brown. "There is i
every indication that Yale will so re- j
main, a non-sectarian institution, with j
all treated alike. Yale provides religion
and Yale has daily chapel.
"I wish we could divest ourselves of
that cant—daily compulsory chapel.
Some people think that that is all
there is at Yale—just daily compulsory
chapel. They forget that attendance
at recitations, lectures, laboratory, ex
aminations—almost everything con
nected with the winning of a degree—
is compulsory."
