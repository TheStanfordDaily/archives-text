# TOUCHING NEW BALL BEFORE GAME JINX FOR TEXAS ELEVEN
## College Tradition Allows Only Captain and Trainer To Handle Pigskin 
### 
AUSTIN, TEXAS, Oct. 21.—Traditions
may come and traditions may go, yet
there is one among athletic officials
of the University of Texas which has
stood for many years. It is that no one
except "Doc" W. A. Wisian, veteran
Longhorn football trainer, and the cap
tain of the football squad shall touch
the ball before a game.
In explaining the custom, Wisian
said: "Several years ago, whenever I
would pump a new ball for a game,
every member of the team and anyone
else interested would come around and
handle the ball to their heart's con
tent. And it seemed like every time
they did, we lost the game."
Now, however, times have changed,
and if you wish to arouse the ire of
Trainer Wisian, it is only necessary to
attempt to touch a new ball. It is an
unwritten rule among the football
players that the new pigskin is to be
touched by no one except Wisian. The
ball is presented to the captain of the
Longhorns just before the game when
the players assemble for a short fight
talk. After that, the ball is ready to
receive the embraces of the others.
"Ever since then we have had better
luck, and whenever someone else does
touch the ball first, we are sure to
lose," he said.
Although there are few instances in
which a football has been known to
burst during a game, one such inci
dent did happen years ago, according
to Wisian. "I think it was during a
game with Southwestern, right at the
first of the season, a good many years
ago. They kicked off to us, and just as
the ball left the earth a loud report
was heard. The ball flattened out in
the air and started straight downward.
Then, McMurray, playing for Texas,
grasped the situation, seized the ball,
tucked it in his shirt, and raced down
the field for a touchdown with the
Southwestern players hardly knowing
what had happened."
