# DEAN MARY YOST LAUDS SORORITIES FOR CO-OPERATION
## Greek Letter Societies Aid A. W. S., Mothers Club Members Told 
### 
"Sororities have played the game with
Associated Women, and every year are
playing it better," declared Dean Mary
Yost in a talk before the Stanford
Mothers' Club yesterday afternoon. "Be
cause dividing the freshmen into small
groups when they enter prevents them
from being easily assimilated in univer
sity women, so the sororities have for
three years postponed rushing and pledg
ing until spring, giving the new women
six months to adjust themselves to uni
versity life and standards."
That the Y.W.C.A. and Women's Ath
letic Association were valuable aids in
co-operation was the opinion expressed
by Miss Yost. ."It is surprising with
what comparative ease the standards to
which Stanford women conform are ac
cepted by the new women," she declared.
"This is due partly to the fact that all
new women live together in Roble Hall
for their first year, and partly to the
sponsor system. No one would know
what a help those sponsors are."
Miss Yost explained the method by
which new women are admitted to the
university, and said that excepting the
names enrolled on the numbered list be
fore 1921, no women are being admitted
from that list now. By 1927 daughters
of alumni will be put on the same com
petitive basis as other applicants, which
requires fifteen recommending high school
units, character recommendation, and
passing the intelligence test.
Explains Self-Government
"A girl must stand on her own achieve
ments and character," said Miss Yost.
"The girls who are admitted give real
promise of fine womanhood later."
Dean Yost explained the self-govern
ment of the women, with a conference
including one representative from each
living group and a council of five as the
supreme authority. New rules and rcgu-
lations passed by Women's council are
submitted to the university president for
approval. The Dean of Women's office
is in no sense a disciplinary one, but
the council deals directly with offenders.
"The men are taking a different atti
tude toward women's regulations now,"
Miss Yost continued. "They are co-oper
ating to help the women keep them, asd
Men's council is making out a list of
places of public resort proper for Stan
ford women to attend, and will keep it
up to date, a thing which was almost
impossible for the women to do."
Women Against Smoking
Miss Yost explained that the stand
taken last year by the women as a body
against smoking was for the purpose of
formulating more definitely the univer
sity sentiment against the practice. When
the university was started, it was not
put into the regulations any more than
lying and stealing, since it was then
considered just as immoral, but the mod
ern attitude toward it made the publica
tion of the women's sentiment necessary.
As with other rules, that against smoking
is put on the honor system.
All the regulations included in the
women's handbook were taken up by
Miss Yost, who gave a detailed account
of their meaning and purposes.
The meeting was the first gathering
of the Mothers' club this year. Philan
thropic work such as giving a scholar
ship, and helping sick and poor students,
were taken up by the members, and plans
for the coming were discussed.
