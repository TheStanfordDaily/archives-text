"Sororities have played the game with
Associated Women, and every year are
playing it better," declared Dean Mary
Yost in a talk before the Stanford
Mothers' Club yesterday afternoon. "Be

new women live together in Roble Hall
for their first year, and partly to the
sponsor system. No one would know
what a help those sponsors are."
Miss Yost explained the method by

university, and said that excepting the
names enrolled on the numbered list be

from that list now. By 1927 daughters

requires fifteen recommending high school
units, character recommendation, and

"The girls who are admitted give real
promise of fine womanhood later."
Dean Yost explained the self-govern
ment of the women, with a conference
including one representative from each
living group and a council of five as the
supreme authority. New rules and rcgu-
