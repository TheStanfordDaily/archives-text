# INTELLIGENCE FAILS
## 
### 
Reports reaching the public safety
department of the Automobile Club of
Southern California indicate that in
telligence is not an automobile driver's
prerequisite as most of the automo
bile accidents are caused by profes
sional men and not by laborers, de
livery boys, and taxicab drivers.
