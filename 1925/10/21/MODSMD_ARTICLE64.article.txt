# SPORTS OF 1925
## The 						Washington Wallop 
### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Just about a year ago the Scribes on the bases, and not a "bad egg" at
and Pharisees were using up all the \ on the defense!

nice adjectives in the dictionary in
describing the fine work of Mr. Leon j
Goslin in the world series between I
Washington and the Giants.
Leon Goslin tied Babe Ruth's record ,
last year with three home runs in one
series. He made eleven hits for a total
of twenty-one bases, more than any
other player on either team made. Be
sides that, he played errorless ball in
the outfield through all the seven
games. Yea, verily, he is an "Ugly
Duckling" with the bat, a "Wild Goose"

Goslin, in his fourth season as a
regular player, has exceeded, in many
ways, the fine record he set in 1923.
He has scored more runs, and stolen
nearly twice as many bases, among
other things. He is again one of the
leaders in runs batted in. And remem
ber that this player, who is the punch
of the Washington attack, is only 23
years old.
"The Goose," before he became a
I hard-hitting outfielder, was a glass
j blower, an elevator repairer, and a
j pitcher.
