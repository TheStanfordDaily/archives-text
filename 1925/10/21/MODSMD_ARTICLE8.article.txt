# FROSH MEET FIRST REAL OPPOSITION OF SEASON IN U. S. C.
## Coach Hunt's Babe Gridders To Take on Strong Trojan Yearlings Saturday 
### Frank Baker 
Next Saturday's freshman football
game will be the real test of Husky
Hunt's grid season prior to the Little
Big Game. The U. S. C. freshmen have
the confidence gained from a long
string of previous victories, including
wins over the Stanford yearlings for
two years. Most critics agree that the
Southern lads will go onto the field
with the best chances of winning.
Coach Cliff Herd will have as heavy
a line as the Cardinal babes, and an
j even heavier backfield, with the pos
sible exception of Elliott. He will un
doubtedly attempt to make his yard
age by line plunges and bucks, using
| Porter, fullback, for the battering at
| tack. Porter has been making his way
| through all lines he has met, but what
! will happen when he smashes into
Tandy or Artman is a story yet to be
told. The Trojans will not lack speed,
however, for Bud Elliott and Bill Ford
have both caused considerable com
ment because of their open field run
ning. Elliott is a brother of Harold
Elliott, who plays quarterback for the
U. S. C. varsity.
He also has the distinction of liav
! ing played last year on the champion
ship high school team of Southern
; California, the Glendale high school,
j Two former captains of Alhambra high
school, Bell and Rex, who play guard
and tackle respectively, are among the
strongest men on the line, and are fol
lowed closely by Ryan and Hibbs. It is
stated that a complete team of high
school captains could be made up out
; of Herd's squad. Fox, at center, has
been playing a stellar game all season.
Vermilya, the Stanford center, and Fox
are considered the outstanding pivot
men in the state.
Against the heavy array from the
South, Coach Hunt will have to de
pend mainly on open play and end
runs, for it will be well night impos
sible to make enough yards through
the Southern California line to score
j a touchdown. Wilton and Sims will
| bet most of the work in this kind of a
game, while Smalling will have to be
content to run the much-needed inter
, ference.
Husky and his whole squad of sixty
| seven football players had their pic-
I tures taken last night. Separate pic
tures were taken of all first-string
players, and one of the three big line
men, Artman, Tandy, and Fleishacker,
i who make an aggregate weight of
J over 600 pounds.
