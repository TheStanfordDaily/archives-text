mer's evening, and their adventures in
the enchanted wood of the "might
have been" when they are presented
with "a second chance."

room of Lob's home; the second act
takes place in the dream wood where
artistic lighting adds much to the
effectiveness of the fantastic action of
the play.

fine acting, and Day is well qualified
for the part. He has been prominent
in campus dramatics for several years,
and is remembered for his characteri
zations in "Captain Applejack," "The
Dover Road," and "Macbeth."

misunderstood Mr. Purdie. Adelaide
Mack and Marian Roberts as Joanna
Trout and Mrs. Purdie are two actress

tion of the part in the summer pro
| duction.
The other members of the cast are
| Lucie Bently, Claire Dawes, Barbara
| Eubanks, Louis Hitchcock, and Jacob
I Irwin. Miss Bently and Miss Dawes

for the repeat performance of "Dear
Brutus" to be given in the Assembly
ball tomorrow evening at. 8:15 o'clock.
The play is being presented with the
original cast of the summer produc
tion, including Paul Hays and Miss
Marjorie Allen.
Hays, who created such a favorable
impression with his interpretation of
the role of Mr. Dearth, will again play
that part. Hays is postponing a trip
to New York in order to be in "Dear
Brutus." He was enrolled at Stanford
during the summer quarter as a stu
■tlent in the classical literature depart
ment, and has taken prominent pares
in amateur roles in New York City
and San Mateo.
Adventurous Action
The action of the play centers about
a group of guests invited to the home
•of Lob, A. Grove Day, on a midsum
mer's evening, and their adventures in
the enchanted wood of the "might
have been" when they are presented
with "a second chance."
The opening scene is in the drawing
room of Lob's home; the second act
takes place in the dream wood where
artistic lighting adds much to the
effectiveness of the fantastic action of
the play.
The role of Lob calls for some very
fine acting, and Day is well qualified
for the part. He has been prominent
in campus dramatics for several years,
and is remembered for his characteri
zations in "Captain Applejack," "The
Dover Road," and "Macbeth."
Charles H. Parks is well cast in the
amusing role of the ever-noble and
misunderstood Mr. Purdie. Adelaide
Mack and Marian Roberts as Joanna
Trout and Mrs. Purdie are two actress
es new to campus playgoers.
Miss Marjorie Allen has the stellar
women's role as Margaret, although
she appears only in the second act.
Margaret is one of Barrie's most
charming heroines, and Miss Allen
was much praised for her interpreta
tion of the part in the summer pro
| duction.
The other members of the cast are
| Lucie Bently, Claire Dawes, Barbara
| Eubanks, Louis Hitchcock, and Jacob
I Irwin. Miss Bently and Miss Dawes
are appearing for the first time on the
Stanford stage. Miss Eubanks took
part in "Macbeth" last winter, and
I Hitchcock Avas in "If I Were King,"
j presented here several years ago.
j Irwiti is taking his first role in the
| part of Matey, the butler.
