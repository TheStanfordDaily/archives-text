# YOST URGES TRIAL FOR POINT SYSTEM
## Dean of Women Believes That Many More Women Will Be in Activities 
### 
"The only fair thing to do is to have
a committee investigate the point sys
tem further," said Dean Yost in an
interview yesterday. "The idea of such
a system should be thoroughly dis
cussed and brought up to the point of
being voted upon.
"I heartily approve of a point sys
tem," continued Miss Yost, "as it ful
fills the function of extracurriculum
activities by having more women par
ticipate in them. At the same time it
takes the strain of too much work off
of the shoulders of a few women in the
University. The point system is based
on the right principle.
Should Be Tried
"The point system should be given a
trial for a two-year period," she added.
"It is not right to either saddle it on
future generations of Stanford women
now, or leave the question without
trial. It has been tried successfully in
other universities, and Stanford wo
men should at least see that a com
mittee is appointed to find out if such
a system would be practical here."
"It is the most constructive sugges
tion we have had for the solution of
our problem. Those opposed to this
system should come forward with con
structive criticism and ideas for the
solution." concluded Dean Yost.
Purpose of System
The purpose of the point system as
stated by Women's Council is printed
below so that there will be no doubt
in anyone's mind as to the purpose
in bringing this before the women.
The point system is not a means
of giving honorable recognition to stu
dents for activities, and it is not a
means of rewarding merit. It is a sys
tem devised to prevent a small group
of women from being overburdened
with activities, by distributing the of
fices and committee work more evenly
among the women.
The question of appointing a com
mittee for further investigation into
a possible point system for Stanford
will be up for debate and vote at the
Women's Assembly to be held next
Tuesday at 9 o'clock.
