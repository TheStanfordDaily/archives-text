# O.A.C. SQUAD OUT FOR FOURTH WIN IN CARDINAL GAME
## Powerful Northern Squad to Arrive Tomorrow for Light Workout 
### Wilbur Adams 
Coach P. J. Schissler and his crew
of Orange football men from the Ore
gon Agricultural College are expected
to reach the Stanford campus tomor
row in order to engage in a light
workout in the stadium before Satur
day. The Beavers are coming to Cali
fornia with three victories already to
their credit, and with a determination
to make it four of a kind.
O. A. C. Has Two Backfields
The Aggies' coach has developed
two complete and independent back
fields. One is a heavy, hard-hitting out
fit, and the other is made up of lighter
and faster men. No individual substitu
tions will be used except in the case
of an injury. If there is a substitution
to be made in the backfield, a complete
change will be made. The first back
field is composed of Denman and
Schulmerich, halves; Snider, fullback;
and Edwards at quarterback. This
backfield is known as the "big four."
The light backfield, or the "pony ex
press," as it is called, is made up of
Quin and Luby at halves; Bell, full
back ; and Lassiter, quarterback.
Coach Schissler has not announced
which of the two combinations he will
use against Stanford.
With the exception of Captain Ernie
Nevers, Stanford, too, has two com
plete backfields. The men that will
start the game against the Northerners
are Murphy and Bogue at halfbacks,
Mitchell at quarterback, and Nevers
at fullback. The substitutes that War- 1
ner will use in the second half of the
game are Hyland and Hill at halves,
and Solomon at either quarter or full
back. So it does not look as though
the Aggies were going to have any!
advantage because of substitutes.
' Nevers Best Punter
Stanford has a big edge over O. A. C.
in punting. Red Denman is the best |
kicker that the Beavers can offer, and
his best boots are not over fifty yards,
Nevers can average that distance.
Snider also kicks for Oregon but his
punting is not even as good as his
teammate. Hylaiul is Stanford's sub
stitute kicker, and while he does not
get the distance that Nevers gets, he
is much faster in getting the' ball off
than the captain. If O. A. C.is rushing
too fast, Hyland may be used to do all
of the punting.
Ward Poulson, star tackle for the
Cards, is in the hospital with a severe
cold. He may not see action Saturday,
and if he is not in a suit Freeman will
probably be in the lineup. Burt Sim
mons was declared ineligible for var
sity Tuesday of this week, so he will
not be used this year at tackle.
The Aggies are also having their
troubles. Hale, Robins, and J. Dixon
have all been laid up for the last week.
Robins is the only one of the three
who will not be able to play this week
end.
