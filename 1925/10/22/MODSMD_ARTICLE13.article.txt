### Wilbur Adams 
Coach P. J. Schissler and his crew
of Orange football men from the Ore
gon Agricultural College are expected
to reach the Stanford campus tomor
row in order to engage in a light
workout in the stadium before Satur
day. The Beavers are coming to Cali
fornia with three victories already to
their credit, and with a determination
to make it four of a kind.
O. A. C. Has Two Backfields
The Aggies' coach has developed
two complete and independent back
fields. One is a heavy, hard-hitting out
fit, and the other is made up of lighter
and faster men. No individual substitu
tions will be used except in the case
of an injury. If there is a substitution
to be made in the backfield, a complete
change will be made. The first back
field is composed of Denman and
Schulmerich, halves; Snider, fullback;
and Edwards at quarterback. This
backfield is known as the "big four."
The light backfield, or the "pony ex
press," as it is called, is made up of
Quin and Luby at halves; Bell, full
back ; and Lassiter, quarterback.
Coach Schissler has not announced
which of the two combinations he will
use against Stanford.
With the exception of Captain Ernie
Nevers, Stanford, too, has two com
plete backfields. The men that will
start the game against the Northerners
are Murphy and Bogue at halfbacks,
Mitchell at quarterback, and Nevers
