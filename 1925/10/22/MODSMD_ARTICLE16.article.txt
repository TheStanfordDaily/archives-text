# U.S.C.-STANFORD BABES TO MEET
## Cardinal Yearlings Strongest Team Southerners Have Met During Year 
### Frank Baker 
Coach Cliff Herd and his U. S. C.
freshman football squad will arrive
tomorrow morning on the "Lark" in
order to take a light workout here be
fore the Saturday game with Husky
Hunt's freshmen. The squad is in good
condition with the exception of a few
minor injuries that will not keep any
of the men out of the game.
The Stanford freshmen have the
only strong football team the U. S. C.
yearlings will play this year, so they
are pointing toward Saturday's game
as the climax of their season. This
fact alone makes it evident that the
Southern lads will put forth every
effort to score a victory, thus making
their third successive win over the
Cardinal first-year men. They have
piled up heavy scores against all of
their opponents this year, so it may
be another case of a too-easy season
putting the skids under them.
Trojans Make Big Score
Last Saturday the Southern Cali
fornia freshmen trounced the Sher
man Indians 58 to 0 in a decidedly
one-sided contest. The score is merely
an indication of the speed with which
the southerners romped up and down
the field. Though the score indicates
a strong aggregation, it also means
that Cliff Herd's team has not had any
competition to speak of. This will be
a big point in Husky Hunt's favor and,
knowing this, he will send his men
into the game to play their hardest
right from the start.
Contrasted to the weak teams U. S.
C. has been up against this season are
four hard games chalked up to the
Stanford freshmen. The total points
made in all four of these games do not
count as high as those made in the
single game by the Trojans. When the
freshmen beat San Mateo Junior Col
lege 25 to 0 they upset the dope, for
the San Mateans had played the Cali
fornia Cubs a close game the previ
ous Saturday, holding them to a 20
Ito 10 score. Besides this game were
| those with U. S. S. Idaho, the Army
team from the Presidio, and Sacra
mento Junior College.
Hibbs Is Star Tackle
Jesse Hibbs, playing tackle for the
, Trojan youngsters, is from Chicago,
i and was considered by Alonzo Stagg
the greatest prep player the Chicago
mentor had ever seen. He has been
living up to this compliment all sea
son, playing stellar football and shunt
ing off all opposition for the tackle
berth. Schaub, playing with him, is
; considered one of the best guards in
the southern part of the state.
Coach Hunt has been drilling his
line to hold a smashing offense, for the
Trojans are expected to attempt a
i heavy line-plunging game. The back
field has been working on open plays
and passing as the best methods of
! attack against the heavy line their op
! ponents will have.
