# FIVE HUNDRED RATS USED IN RESEARCH STUDY
## PROFESSOR STONE STUDYING LEARNING ABILITY RODENTS TESTED DAILY FOR TWENTY DAYS 
### 
Five hundred white rats arc being used
by Professor Calvin P. Stone of the
Psychology department in research work
to determine learning ability with rcspect
! to age. The study is being financed by
I a grant from the Carnegie Corporation
of $12,000 to be extended over a period
of three years. After the- first year
higher animals, such as the cat, will be
studied. *"
The problem in the case of animals is
i to test the ability to learn at successive
i stages of development. With rats ages
j of twenty, thirty, fifty, one hundred, and
two hundred days are used. Intermediate
| ages may be used later in further cx
' pansion of the work. Both the learning
! of new habits and the breaking of old
| ones arc to be tested.
Two types of tests are being conducted
| by Professor Stone at present, the prob
t letn box and the maze. The problem

box is a square box of wire screening \
from which a door leads to another box
containing food. The door can be i
opened only by stepping upon a small
platform projecting from the side of the |
box. When the rat depresses this plat
form with his feet an electric circuit is !
closed which releases the door leading to
the food. A rat is given this test once
a day for twenty days, and the time re
quired for him to depress the platform j
is noted. Then a period of fifty days
I is allowed to elapse before the test is rc
-1 peated to determine his retention of the
1 habit formed. About one hundred rats
of each age are tested.
The maze is one of the oldest devices
j to test intelligence and learning ability. '
j It consists of a labyrinthine passage con
taining many blind alleys but only one
direct path to the end, where food is j
