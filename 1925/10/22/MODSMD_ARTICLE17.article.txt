# FIVE HUNDRED RATS USED IN RESEARCH STUDY
## PROFESSOR STONE STUDYING LEARNING ABILITY RODENTS TESTED DAILY FOR TWENTY DAYS 
### 
Five hundred white rats arc being used
by Professor Calvin P. Stone of the
Psychology department in research work
to determine learning ability with rcspect
! to age. The study is being financed by
I a grant from the Carnegie Corporation
of $12,000 to be extended over a period
of three years. After the- first year
higher animals, such as the cat, will be
studied. *"
The problem in the case of animals is
i to test the ability to learn at successive
i stages of development. With rats ages
j of twenty, thirty, fifty, one hundred, and
two hundred days are used. Intermediate
| ages may be used later in further cx
' pansion of the work. Both the learning
! of new habits and the breaking of old
| ones arc to be tested.
Two types of tests are being conducted
| by Professor Stone at present, the prob
t letn box and the maze. The problem

box is a square box of wire screening \
from which a door leads to another box
containing food. The door can be i
opened only by stepping upon a small
platform projecting from the side of the |
box. When the rat depresses this plat
form with his feet an electric circuit is !
closed which releases the door leading to
the food. A rat is given this test once
a day for twenty days, and the time re
quired for him to depress the platform j
is noted. Then a period of fifty days
I is allowed to elapse before the test is rc
-1 peated to determine his retention of the
1 habit formed. About one hundred rats
of each age are tested.
The maze is one of the oldest devices
j to test intelligence and learning ability. '
j It consists of a labyrinthine passage con
taining many blind alleys but only one
direct path to the end, where food is j
placed for the successful rat. A hungry
animal is placed at the starting point
and allowed to find his way to the exit.
The number of false moves taken and
the time required measure learning abil
ity by this trial and error method. In
addition to the five hundred white rats
now being used in these experiments, a
breeding colony of about one hundred
animals is maintained.
A rough estimate of the relative rate
of physical development in the rat and
in man would be as thirty is to one, ac
cording to eminent anatomists. A rat
one month old is equal in physical de
velopment to a child two and one-half
years old. Results now at hand would
seem to indicate that the ratio of mental
development is probably more nearly as
fifty is to one, according to Professor
Stone.
Professor Stone began the study June
1, and with one assistant worked seven
hours daily during the summer. At pres
ent two research assistants are devoting
four hours a day to the experiment.
RORKE ON CAMPUS
Hal Rorke, editor of the Daily Palo
Alto last spring, is back on the campus
after a summer in New York, where
he worked for the United Press. Rorke
graduated last June with the class of
1925. He started back for the West
in a Ford, but sold it at St. Louis and
continued to the Coast by train. He is
staying at the Phi Gamma Delta house,
and will remain on the campus until
Tuesday.
