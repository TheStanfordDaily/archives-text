# CONTEST FOR CAL GAME BLEACHER STUNTS NOW OPEN
## Suggestions Must Be Handed To Rally Committee By November 9 
### 
To secure bleacher stunts for the
Big Game, the Rally Committee re
quests all students to turn in hunches
for stunts to Frank L. Hastings, who
can be reached at the Sigma Chi house
or through Postoffice box 628. The
one who conceives the best idea will
be presented with a perpetual trophy
in the form of a silver loving cup to
be presented by Wideman's store.
Original suggestions are to be turned
in as soon as possible. Contestants are
asked to make their designs in color
on regular-sized graph paper, and no
consideration need be taken of the
number of seats in the rooting section.
November 9 is the deadline set for the
contest.
George Copeland, '28, won the cup
last year in a similar contest spon
sored by the Rally Committee. In
originality the bleacher stunts of the
last Big Game had never been
equalled. Each letter of the word
"Cards" was spelled out as the ace of
a different suit of playing cards. The
"C" was in the ace of hearts, the "A"
was in the ace of diamonds, the "R"
in spades, "D" was in clubs, and the
"S" in hearts.
In addition to the prize-winning
stunt the California Campanile,
blocked in gold on a white background,
was changed to the Palo Alto Pine
Tree. In order to carry out more fully
the idea of the Stanford symbol, the
next stunt showed a red block "S"
under an arch of the Quad with a red
tiled roof. Seven colors, red, white,
black, brown, blue, green, and gold,
were used in the fourteen rapid
changes.
