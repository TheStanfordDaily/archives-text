# Dartmouth's Educational Reform
## 
### 
Dartmouth is trying - a new chef for its educational broth. Sometime
ago its administrative officials, in the quest of changes in curriculum,
asked a group of students to hie themselves to other educational dis
pensaries and seek out the most noteworthy flavors that each school
might give to its Food of Knowledge—whether by method or material.
A two-hunndred-page report was the result. Now the administration
proposes to adopt four of its sections, supposedly on the sole basis of
student advice. The proposals are the least of Stanford's worries—two
have already been incorporated; namely, a Lower Division and recogni
tion of the exceptional student—but the idea back of the initial plan is
noteworthy, perhaps startling, and a "helpful hint" to local educators.
The venture of the Dartmouth administration in fact raises the ques
tion : Can the student successfully help choose his own educational
pathway? Whether the question has been considered in the past or not
is difficult to say, but its realm of possibility is large.
The limits of serious student observation are infinite. Pressing needs
in educational reform may be recognized by traveling faculty committees,
but minute reforms that might grow in later importance from ant hills
to mountains are only the property of the student. At this minute,
undoubtedly, there are twenty-five suggestions for curricular reform lying
dormant in the minds of Stanford students. Each suggestion without
trial is admittedly worthless, but if coupled with observation of its
practice in other universities and brewed with a mixture of student
opinion, the in toto result may be worth the attempt, though at present
speculative.
Stanford is not a domestic science institution, but if the need arose,
it could produce assistant-chefs of as high caliber as have been employed
at Dartmouth.
