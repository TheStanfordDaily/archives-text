# Point Systems

### 
Point systems in any shape may have many faults, but even the worst
of systems could do little more harm than is done by the present state
of affairs in women's activities at Stanford. It is a well-known fact at
Stanford (as in any other institution where the women's student body
has not progressed to the degree of having - some sort of regulations) that
the honors and burdens of office are borne by a few.
Neither the honors, nor the burdens, in such quantities, are best for
the individual. Women's Council has stated the purpose of the point
system in any form (this means ANY form that the women of Stanford
want to consider, not the sample plans which have been presented) as
follows: "The point system is not*a means of giving honorable recogni
tion to students for activities, and it is not a means of rewarding merit.
It is a system devised to prevent a small group of women from being
overburdened with activities by distributing the number of University
actovities in which one person may take part. The point system aims at
three things:
"First: to spread among the many students those privileges, pleasures,
and honors which have previously been monopolized by a few.
"Second: to benefit the organizations of activities by assuring each
position or office an officer whose interests are concentrated rather than
so scattered that her efforts become inefficient.
"Third: to protect prominent individuals from being burdened with
more outside work than is safe for their studies or their health."
At the Women's assembly next Tuesday there will be opportunity to
make suggestions and ask questions. All that will be decidcd by the vote
of the women then is whether they want to even CONSIDER a point
system, to give a representative committee a chance to work out a plan
which, if not satisfactory, may be voted down in February. It would
seem childish to turn down something other universities have tried with
success, and to turn it down without due consideration.
A sophomore at the University of Washington and a clerk in a Seattle
department store received a half column of mention in a city daily recently
upon their marriage in the northern city. Few American students are so
lucky (if luck it can be called) as to gain such publicity, but it seems that the
bride, though now a clerk, was a princess under the old Russian regime, while
her helpmate served in the imperial Russian guards. Monarchies totter in
Europe but royal emigrants on this side of the Atlantic are still considered
interesting enough by great newspapers to receive as much mention at their
marriages as the scions of America's wealthiest families. It would seem,
therefore, that blue blood continues to rank with golden power.
A news dispatch from New York states that women of the Washington
Square Branch of the New York University have announced a smoker at
which tea and cakes will be taboo, and where cigarettes only will be served
guests. Women have evidently hurdled the last barrier to equal rightsâ€”but
Isn't such national advertising as this "Sophomore Girls Smoker" has received
just a little hypocritical?
About the only horse the automobile isn't supplanting is the dark horse in
politics. And the steam roller usually takes care of him.
The Daily Btaff members will convene at 1:15 tomorrow.
