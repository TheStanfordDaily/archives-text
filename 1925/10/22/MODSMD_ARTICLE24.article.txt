# DAY'S DOINGS
## 
### Ted Elias, Jr 
Many things are happening 'round us,
Things are happening, that is true,
And the ones who read the "DAILY"
Know who they are happening to.
Bleacher stunts are badly needed,
For the California game,
Here's the chance for backward genius,
To put forth its bid for fame.
Hastings at the Sigma Chi house,
Is the name you must remember,
Turn your stunts in to this fellow,
By the ninth of next November.
Branner Hall will give a dance,
In honor of inferno's chief.
After several months at Branner,
"Hell on Earth" is some relief.
Freshmen open soccer season,
'Gainst a team from Half Moon Bay,
Interviewed upon the subject,
Andy Smith had nought to say.
Undergrads at California
Have let out an awful shout,
'Cause their share of Big Game tickets
Weakened fast and then gave out.
If they could but read the future,
They would gladly miss the battle,
Stanford's fighting cowboys now.
Are set to brand old Andy's cattle.
