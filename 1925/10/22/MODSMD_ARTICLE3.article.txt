# STUDENTS' GUILD ESTABLISHES FIRST HOSPITAL PREVIOUS TO 1903 STUDENTS WENT TO INFIRMARY TYPHOID EPIDEMIC MAKES MOVE ESSENTIAL
## 
### 
The first hospital in Palo Alto was
established in the fall of 1903, by a
University organization known as the
Students' Guild. The guild had been a
voluntary organization to collect con
tributions for a small infirmary at En
cina and at Roble, before the estab- i
lishment of the hospital. An epidemic
of typhoid fever, which spread to over
two hundred students, made it clear |
that a hospital for the University was ■
imperative.
The faculty committee and the Stu
dents' Guild, which had J. P. Mitchell,,
then an undergraduate student, for
president, took the management of
the erection of the hospital into their
hands. A lot was bought on the corner
of Lytton and Cowper. The hospital
building is now an apartment house.
This was the first hospital between [
San Francisco and San Jose.
For ten years the Students' Guild

ran the hospital in Palo Alto; then, as
the town itself began to feel the need
of a hospital, a group of Palo Alto
doctors got together and built the
Peninsula Hospital, now the Palo Alto
Hospital. The Students' Guild then
made a contract with the Peninsula
Hospital to take in student members.
In 1920 the Peninsula Hospital be
came municipal property. The Univer
sity made an arrangement with the
city whereby the University was to
run the hospital. The contract with the
Students' Guild remained the same.
The state legislature is at present
considering a bill which requires all
hospitals with more than one story to
be fireproof. When it is passed, the
Palo Alto Hospital must go, and tenta
tive plans are now being laid by Palo
Alto business men and University of
ficials for the erection of a new hos
pital.
