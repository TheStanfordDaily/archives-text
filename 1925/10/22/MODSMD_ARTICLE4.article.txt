New talent is urged to make itself
known for musical and specialty
numbers which would be acceptable
for the Football Show, to be given
November 20, the evening before
the Big Game.
Musical numbers and songs are
needed to carry out the program
which is being arranged. Fifteen
numbers in all, divided into three
acts, promise a novel show, but
songs and ideas for musical skits
are needed, according to John L.
Wiggin, musical director of the
show.
All song-writers are asked to com
municate with Wiggin at the Alpha
Tau Omega house, P. A. 1584.
