# ONLY ONE CUSTOM OBJECTED TO AT EUPHRONIA FORUM
## Rule Prohibiting Freshmen From Queening Said To Be Wrong 
### 
Freshmen may "queen" when and
where they please, as far as those
attending the "Campus Traditions"
discussion sponsored last night by
Euphronia Debating Society, are con
cerned. Reasons given for this casting
aside of a tradition formerly strictly
enforced were that no attention was
being paid to its support, and that
there was no means of enforcing the
custom because of the abolishment of
freshman discipline.
Several of the more important tra
ditions of Stanford were discussed.
Following a motion that a certain
tradition be abolished, the question
was placed before the audience for dis
cussion, at the close of which a vote
was taken. The purpose of the forum
was to obtain a concensus of campus
opinion as to the status of Stanford
traditions.
Mud Fight Discussed
The first tradition to be discussed
was that of the sophomore-freshman
mud fight. Those favoring the abolish
ment of the fight pointed out the waste
of time involved, the dislike of the
participants for the contest, the unfair
spirit which prevails at the affair, and
that the tradition "was a relic of the
Middle Ages." Supporters of the fight
also advanced the argument that here
was a harmless way of settling class
rivalry, forming class spirit, and of
"getting rid of excess steam which
would otherwise be turned to harmful
channels." After a heated argument,
the audience voted for the continuance
of the fight.
The second tradition to come under
discussion was that of compelling the
fresmen to wear dinks. Few present
were in favor of the discard of this
custom. The only objection was that
the freshmen were not obeying the
tradition.
"Hello" Favored
The majority of the forum were in
favor of continuing the "hello" custom
because of its value in promoting a
friendly and democratic atmosphere on
the campus. The traditions of holding
a Pajamarino and preserving the
"sanctity" of the Law steps were also
supported.
