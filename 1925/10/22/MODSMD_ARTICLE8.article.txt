# WATER POLO SQUADS HOLD FIRST WORKOUT IN SWIMMING POOL
## 
### 
The first water polo practice of the
season was held last night in the En
cina pool. A short workout of about
twenty minutes was gone through to
condition the men. Ernst Brandsten
coached the players while Wally
O'Connor acted as referee.
This afternoon at 4:30 o'clock the
freshmen will meet a sophomore team
in a practice game. Material for a
strong freshman squad seems to be
on band. Constant practice games will
make it possible to get a line on the
players available.
The varsity will probably be playing
as a team earlier this year than in the
past. Brandsten places more confidence
in thorough teamwork than in brilliant
individual performers playing their
own game.
Among those playing yesterday
were: Harry Andrews, Frank Tries'.,
Kryne Van den Akker, Danford, and
Dixon Smith of last year's freshmen,
and Jim Carson and Phil Brooks of
the varsity.
