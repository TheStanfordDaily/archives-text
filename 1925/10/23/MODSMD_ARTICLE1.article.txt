# SENIORS HAVE EDGE OVER JUNIOR TEAM IN FIRST CONTEST
## Sophomores Doped to Lose Lowerclass Game Due To Lack of Men 
### 
Strenuous scrimmage yesterday |
marked the last practice of the four |
interclass football teams before they
clash Saturday morning at 9:30 o'clock
in the first of the series of games to j
determine this year's winner of the 'â– 
class championship trophy.
The senior machine had little diffi-!
culty in going through the sophomores'
line or around their ends. McHose,;
Stratton, and Fuller showed up espe-1
cially well on the offensive, while I
Wolf, at full, backed up the line on ,
every play. The men were
unable to make any headway against :
the seniors except through passes, be-1
ing outclassed and outweighed in
every department of the game.
By holding the goofs to an even j
game, Harry Shipkey's first-year men !
showed that they will be a serious con-1
tender for first honors. A well-balanced j
and smooth-running offensive, the re- j
suit of long practice, combined with a
tight defense, will make them hard to [
beat.
The addition during the last few
days of several new men who were on -
last year's team strengthens the jun- j
iors' thin ranks, and their hopes of
beating the seniors have become more
promising. Green and Hotchkiss in the
line have plenty of weight to plug up
the forward defense, while Sandwick
is doped to hold down a regular posi-1
tion on the backfield.
