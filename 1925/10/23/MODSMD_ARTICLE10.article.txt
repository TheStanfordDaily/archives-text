# TROJAN YEARLINGS WILL GIVE FRESHMEN SQUAD REAL TEST
## Inexperienced Cards Face Fast Southern Babes Here Tomorrow 
### Francis Mosher 
j Coach Husky Hunt's football team
i faces the strong Trojan yearling eleven
| tomorrow afternoon in what should
prove to be the first test of the fresh
men's strength. For the U. S. C. babes
this is the climax of the season.
Although the Southern California
yearlings have developed a fast batter
ing offense, the Redshirts, who are ma
terially lacking in football experience,
! have a heavy line which should stop
the plunging Trojan backs.
Hunt Develops Men
Starting with plenty of green ma
j terial, Coach Hunt has developed a
; team which has shown great defensive
power in not allowing any of its fast
opponents to cross its goal line. By
; comparative scores the U. S. C. lads
have a decided edge. The defeat of
Glendale high by the Southerners by
a score of 40 to 0 is no indication of a
powerful team, as Glendale, who was
last year's state high school champion,
has been consistently losing games to
j other high schools.
Coach Cliff Herd, Trojan mentor, can
be expected to use some tricky plays
if his line-plunging fails to put over a
| touchdown, and a special defense has
been practiced all season in prepara
i tion for this crucial game. Porter, U.
!S. C. fullback, has been smashing
through his opponents' lines in great
| style this season and will be the man
| to stop.
No Card Reserve
Though he has a large squad, Coach
Hunt's main worry is his lack of re
serve material. No change will be
! made in the freshman lineup which
i has been starting the last two games,
unless A1 Cook replaces Morris Doyle
at guard. Cook, who only weighs 160
pounds, can fill either the center or
guard position tomorrow.
i With a backfleld having several good
passers, particularly Wilton and Sims,
Husky can use a passing offense to beat
! the Southerners. Most of the team's
j success tomorrow will depend upon
Spud Lewis, quarterback, whose stra
, tegy may be the deciding factor of
the contest.
| The outcome of this game will give
! Cardinal supporters a distinct idea of
J the actual strength of the freshman
j team, and will supply a basis to work
' on when comparing them with Cali-
I fornia for the "Little Big Game."
