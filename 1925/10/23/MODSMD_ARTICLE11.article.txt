| o'clock; Tuesday and Thursday, all
i forenoon, from 12 to 2 o'clock, and

The Board of Athletic Control is
planning to build new tennis courts,
and a tennis stadium, as part of the
permanent improvement of the ath
letic plant, according to Dr, W. H.
Barrow. This will be done as soon as
funds are available and, when accom
plished, will do much toward giving
everyone at the University, who de
sires it, an opportunity to play, which
is not possible under the present re
stricted conditions.
