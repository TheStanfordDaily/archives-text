# INDIAN MELODIES TO BE PLAYED AT CONCERT TUESDAY
## Lieurance, Composer and Interpreter of Native Music, to Perform 
### 
Thurlow Lieurance, famous for his j
transcriptions of native Indian melo-!
dies, will appear in recital with Edna j
Wooley-Lieurance, soprano interpreter
of his sings, in the Assembly hall next
Tuesday evening, October 27. The con
cert is being given under the auspices
of the Committee on Public Exercises j
as one of their regular Tuesday eve- j
ning events. Miss Lillian Reed, flutist. !
will accompany and play Indian melo- j
dies.
Lieurance scarcely needs any intro- j
duction for his songs are well known
especially "By the Waters of Minne- j
tonka." He has done a unique work
and has devoted years of his life to I
actual living with native Indian tribes j
and recording their chants, war songs, j
and melodies. Several hundred phono-!
graph records which he made are!
being preserved in the Smithsonian j
Institute and museums so that future
generations will be able to hear the j
music of the country's original inhabit-:
ants as it was played and sung by |
them.
More important event than this to !
the music-loving public is the fact that |
Lieurance has been able to make use i
of the genuine Indian melodies and !
rhythms in many songs and musical;
works of originality and beauty. He j
has found the best and most vital in
Indian music and used it for the en
richment of mbdern music.
Mrs. Lieurance wears several genu- i
ine Indian costumes in the course of
her songs. She is regarded as the fore
most interpreter of the music of Mr.
Lieurance and the American Indian.
She has a voice of remarkable range |
as well as tone quality. In some of her ■
songs she covers a range of two oc- j
taves without noticeable effort. As the i
companion of Mr. Lieurance on trips i
to the woods and to Indian communi
ties for his musical researches she has I
attained the real feeling of nature j
and out-of-doors that fills the primi
tive music.
There will be several ensemble num-;
hers with soprano, flute, and piano, j
"By the Waters of Minnetonka" will
be rendered in this way. Mr. Lieurance
will exhibit and explain his collection
of real Indian flutes gathered on his
trips and visits of study among Indian
tribes.

dies, will appear in recital with Edna j
Wooley-Lieurance, soprano interpreter
of his sings, in the Assembly hall next
Tuesday evening, October 27. The con
cert is being given under the auspices
of the Committee on Public Exercises j
as one of their regular Tuesday eve- j
ning events. Miss Lillian Reed, flutist. !
will accompany and play Indian melo- j
dies.
Lieurance scarcely needs any intro- j
duction for his songs are well known
especially "By the Waters of Minne- j
tonka." He has done a unique work
and has devoted years of his life to I
actual living with native Indian tribes j
and recording their chants, war songs, j
and melodies. Several hundred phono-!
graph records which he made are!
being preserved in the Smithsonian j
Institute and museums so that future
generations will be able to hear the j
music of the country's original inhabit-:
ants as it was played and sung by |
them.
More important event than this to !
the music-loving public is the fact that |
Lieurance has been able to make use i
of the genuine Indian melodies and !
rhythms in many songs and musical;
works of originality and beauty. He j
has found the best and most vital in
Indian music and used it for the en
richment of mbdern music.
Mrs. Lieurance wears several genu- i
ine Indian costumes in the course of
her songs. She is regarded as the fore
most interpreter of the music of Mr.
Lieurance and the American Indian.
She has a voice of remarkable range |
as well as tone quality. In some of her ■
songs she covers a range of two oc- j
taves without noticeable effort. As the i
companion of Mr. Lieurance on trips i
to the woods and to Indian communi
ties for his musical researches she has I
attained the real feeling of nature j
and out-of-doors that fills the primi
tive music.
There will be several ensemble num-;
hers with soprano, flute, and piano, j
"By the Waters of Minnetonka" will
be rendered in this way. Mr. Lieurance
will exhibit and explain his collection
of real Indian flutes gathered on his
trips and visits of study among Indian
tribes.
