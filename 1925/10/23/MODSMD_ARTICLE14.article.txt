Regular practice for the varsity gym- j
nastic team is being held Mondays,
Tuesdays, and Thursdays in Encina I

a busy season this year and a capable |
bunch of tumblers are working out 1
under the direction of Coach C. W.;
Davis and Captain Wayne Smith.
Wayne Smith has had two years of
varsity competition and is the only
letter man on the present squad. ITar- j
per, last year's captain, and Phillips, I
point-winners in the California meet j
last year, are the regulars missed this j
season.
Fontaine, Abbe, Taylor, and John- |
son have all had experience on gym j
teams, and from this group Coach
Davis expects to select the men for j
this year's varsity. Stitt, Gardner, and j
Hilmer, all new men, are favored to be \
among the leading contenders for var- j
sity positions in coming years.
Freshmen having had experience on ;
gym teams are urged to see Coach
Davis regarding their possibilities for
the varsity team. It is planned to hold |
a University tournament, in the early
part of the winter quarter and by this
means interest new men in the ac
