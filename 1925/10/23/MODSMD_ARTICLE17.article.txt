# UNIVERSITY GRAYS PLAY SANTA CLARA RESERVES SATURDAY
## 
### 
Santa Clara University's Reserves
meet the Stanford Grays on the var
sity practice field at 10 o'clock tomor
row morning. Very little is known of
the Bronco Goofs, but Santa Clara al
ways turns out a good team and Hal
Davis' players will have to extend
themselves to put over a victory.
The Grays can boast of two complete
teams which are of nearly equal
strength, and there are substitutes for
both teams. Even in their weakened
condition of last week, with only about
a third of the first and second string
men in the lineup, the Grays beat the
California Poly team from San Luis
Obispo 20 to 19. Now, with the full
squad in uniform, they should be able
to make an impressive showing. In
scrimmage against the varsity Wednes
day there were two times when the
Reserves had the ball within a foot
of the varsity goal line. Though un
able to put the ball over, they showed
a lot of strength in getting as near
as they did.
Bert Simmons is now on the Gray
squad because of being ruled ineligi
ble for conference games, and his
playing at tackle will greatly
strengthen the forward wall. Ralph
Young, former all-state fullback in
Utah, was playing a good game in the
scrimmage Wednesday and promises
to make a reputation for himself.
Doerr, Josephs, Antonelle, and Sy
monds all played stellar, football, Sy
monds doing some varsity-calibre
blocking and interference on coming
out of the line. Macabee will do the
place-kicking, while Woolf will be
the mainstay for punts. Macabee did
not miss one place kick out of fifteen
or twenty tries from the three-yard
line, and made eight out of ten from
the thirty-five yard line in practice
last night.
Coach Hal Davis will choose his
starting lineup out of the following
men: center, Graham or Haite; guards,
Symonds, Sobiesky, Arata, and Potts;
tackles, Simmons, Evans, Snyder, and
Riese; ends, Davidson, Barnes, An
tonelle, Adams, and Wheeler; quarter
back, Macabee or Red Clark; fullback,
Morrison or Young; halfbacks, Doerr,
Woolf, Dungan, and Cowan.

to make an impressive showing. In
scrimmage against the varsity Wednes
day there were two times when the
Reserves had the ball within a foot
of the varsity goal line. Though un
able to put the ball over, they showed
a lot of strength in getting as near
as they did.
Bert Simmons is now on the Gray
squad because of being ruled ineligi
ble for conference games, and his
playing at tackle will greatly
strengthen the forward wall. Ralph
Young, former all-state fullback in
Utah, was playing a good game in the
scrimmage Wednesday and promises
to make a reputation for himself.
Doerr, Josephs, Antonelle, and Sy
monds all played stellar, football, Sy
monds doing some varsity-calibre
blocking and interference on coming
out of the line. Macabee will do the
place-kicking, while Woolf will be
the mainstay for punts. Macabee did
not miss one place kick out of fifteen
or twenty tries from the three-yard
line, and made eight out of ten from
the thirty-five yard line in practice
last night.
Coach Hal Davis will choose his
starting lineup out of the following
men: center, Graham or Haite; guards,
Symonds, Sobiesky, Arata, and Potts;
tackles, Simmons, Evans, Snyder, and
Riese; ends, Davidson, Barnes, An
tonelle, Adams, and Wheeler; quarter
back, Macabee or Red Clark; fullback,
Morrison or Young; halfbacks, Doerr,
Woolf, Dungan, and Cowan.
