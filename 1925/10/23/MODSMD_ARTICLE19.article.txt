# SECOND VARSITY MAY START AGAINST OREGON A.C. ELEVEN
## Mitchell Has Wrenched Knee; Poulson Out With Severe Cold 
### Wilbur Adams 
With two first string players out of
1 the lineup, Stanford is considerably
i crippled for her second conference
I football match tomorrow afternoon at
3 o'clock in the stadium against the
j Oregon Agricultural College. Ward
| Poulson, tackle, and Muggs Mitchell,
; quarterback, will be on the bench to
morrow —Poulson with a bad cold, and
Mitchell with a wrenched knee.
Stanford's whole lineup may bo
: changed for the benefit of the Aggies,
j The likely lineup of the Cards will be:
Ted Shipkey and Ed Walker at ends,
Cris Freeman and Tiny Raffetto at
tackles, Bob Hunt and Dynamite Post
at. guards, Hal McCreery at center,
Dick Hyland and Don Hill at halfbacks,
Solly Solomon at quarterback, and
; Captain Ernie Nevers at fullback,
j Seven of the starting men are substi
j tutes, but they are strong players and
! should work as well as the regulars
! against the O. A. C. squad. The sub
[ stitutes will be trying hard to make
names for themselves and win a posi
; tion on the first eleven.
Aggies' Line Strong
The center of the Aggies' line has
| not been punctured this year. Not a
i point has been scored against the
! farmers by any of the three opponents
; so far this season. Wernmark at cen
ter, Richert and Olmstead at guards,
j and Dixon and Dickerson at tackles
are all big and experienced linemen,
i O. A. C.is supposed to have the heav
! iest forward wall on the Pacific Coast
| this year.
The Beavers have both speed and
j weight in the backfield, but they are
not combined in the same four men.
I Coach Schissler has one heavy back
| field and one fast combination. Pop
! Warner has both speed and weight in
| the same backfield. In Hyland, Mur
phy, and Hill there is speed; in
Nevers, Solomon, and Bogue there is
j weight.
The Oregon team will use the hud-
I (lie system of calling plays tomorrow,
! l>ut maybe Stanford will. too. The
Cards have been practicing with both
methods of calling signals this week.
The Aggies coach is taking no chances
of Stanford learning his plays, for be
sides the huddle system of signals,
Schissler has been working his men
behind locked doors all of this week.
Oregon Games Close
Stanford has met O. A. C. three
times on the gridiron, and three times
the Cards have been victorious, but
the scores of the games were all close.
In 1919 Stanford won 14 to 6; in 1921
the Cards won 14 to 7; and in 1920
they again triumphed, but this time
with but six points to spare—Stanford
6, Oregon Aggies 0. Everything points
to another hard battle tomorrow after
noon with a fourth victory for Stanford
at the end of it.
The probable lineup:
Stanford— O. A. C. —
Shipkey LER Logan
Freeman LTR Dickerson
S. Post LGR Olmstead
McCreery C Wernmark
Hunt RGL Richert
Raffetto RTL Dixon
Walker REL Ward
Solomon Q Edwards
Hyland LHR Denman
Hill RHL Schulmersch
Nevers F Snider
