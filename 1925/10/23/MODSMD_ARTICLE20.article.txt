# FEW GOOD SCORES MADE IN UNIVERSITY GOLF TOURNAMENT
## 
### 
Ward Edmonds, a freshman from
San Diego, yesterday shot a 79 in the
all-University golf tournament now in
progress at the Burlingame Country
Club, which is the lowest score that
has been turned in to date. Par for the
course is 72.
Very few exceptional scores have
been turned in during the first three
days of the competition due to the
fact that many of the players are un
accustomed to the course. The greens
are very fast, making it impossible
| to sink long putts.
Among others who have turned in
| good scores are Bobby Syer, a fresh
j man from San Jose, 81; Doug White,
!84; Chet Mclnnes, 84; and Eddie Mey
berg, 85. Very few varsity players have
been out so far. All men who have en
itered must have completed four rounds
by next Friday.
Prizes will be given to the man turn
ing in the lowest net and gross scores
I of the tournament in addition to the
1 awards that will be provided for the
winner and runner-up in each of the
| three groups into which the contest-
I ants are divided.
