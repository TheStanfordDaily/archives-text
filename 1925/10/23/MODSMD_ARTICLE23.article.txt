# Why a College?
## 
### 
An Eastern university president is unquestionably right when he
tells his undergraduates that "The vast extent of the present-day
zeal for going to college is not indicative of any like increase in zeal
for education." The situation at an endowed institution, such as
Stanford, is much better than that of state universities where little
limitation can be placed on the numbers, but even here we are
troubled with those superfluous persons who come to college because
it is "the thing to do."
President Little at Michigan University says he intends making
the entrance requirements more difficult, and indications are that
many state universities will take equivalent steps. The flood needs
control dams. Even the universities which placidly accept 5,000
freshmen have to weed them out drastically in self defense before
the end of the year. The chief question is as to the basis of limitation,
and it is hard because it involves conflicting ideas as to the prime
aim of college training. Is it pure scholarship, as Woodrow Wilson
said at Princeton?
If scholarship, pure scholarship, is all that is required sterner
entrance examinations, perhaps supplemented by psychological tests,
will suffice. If it is character, then the Eastern women's colleges
are right in scrutinizing not only examination papers but school
record and a personal estimate supplied by the principal. If it is
social training, as alumni of some of the old endowed Eastern
colleges seem to feel, then the officers will debar social misfits, such
as negroes and members of recent immigration groups.
Any limitation of the college opportunities placed before high
school graduates has an undemocratic look. Something must be
done to open proper vocational paths before the debarred student.
With this accomplished the only consideration is that the limitations
be absolutely fair, and the only way to make it fair is to base it
upon higher scholastic requirements, with character as the main
secondary consideration.
