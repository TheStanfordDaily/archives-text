# Carelessness in Pedestrians
## 
### 
While automobile drivers are being accused of negligence, wan-'
tonness, and recklessness in driving about the campus,, the case of |
the heedless pedestrian is being entirely overlooked. Persons walking'
along the highways, and across highways at intersections, should |
co-operate with motorists and be made to exercise a reasonable
degree of care for their safety.
Every evening students can be seen walking on Palm Drive and
other automobile roads on the same side as, and in the same direc- j
tion with, passing traffic." The sole reason is usually to seek a ride'
—but should an automobile hit one of these students a terrific furor
would ensue. When walking in the same direction as traffic the |
headlights of an approaching car do not provide sufficient warning.
Many times the driver may be temporarily blinded by the glare of
advancing headlights, and for the moment be unable to see the;
pedestrian directly in his path. This combination of facts has caused j
several accidents and will continue to do so until pedestrians exercise j
proper precautions.
Walkers must keep off Palm Drive, particularly at night, and if it j
should become necessary to cross a highway they should walk on
the left side of the street instead of on the side with the traffic. This
is a precautionary method which, if followed, would aid materially j
in lessening accidents on the campus.
