# Vaudeville Without Rowdyism
## 
### 
Yesterday Skull and Snakes passed a resolution to strive for a|
quieter vaudeville entertainment on Thursday evenings. Apparently
the efforts of the society are meeting with immediate success for
a decided improvement was noted by those in the audience last night.
It is pitiable that Stanford students should be so unable to control
themselves that an honor society must take steps to conduct a cam
paign against them. Men of college age and maturity are capable
of sitting through an entertainment without creating a roughhouse,
and they should do so without the demands of campus organizations.
However, they have failed to keep quiet of their own accord, and
some one must unite with the theatre and its quiet amusement
seking audience to stamp out rowdyism. The Daily can think of
wo more suitable organization to tackle the job than Skull and
Snakes.
