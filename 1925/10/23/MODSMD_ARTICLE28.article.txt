Horace Hingsby, a senior student, is
in the hospital Buffering from severe
shock, as a result of an accident that
occurred in the Administration Build
ing last Tuesday. Hingsby was stand
ing in line waiting to buy tickets for"
the next campus play. When he finally
reached the window and asked the
ticket seller for the best seats he had,
the latter replied, "Row F, center sec
tion." Doctors in attendance on Hings
by state that he will be confined to his
bed for at least a month.
* * *
We hear with interest that the Roble
women consumed twenty large cakes
at their birthday dinner series. It
seems after all that men are not the
only cake-eaters on the campus.
* * *
We have at last discovered why
seats in the center section of the As
sembly Hall can not be obtained for
dramatic productions. The machine
that prints the tickets has no numbers
between 10 and 30.

I alius thought t'ud be such sport to
feed the bears as growl and snort and
give 'em things, and watch 'em eal —
fer fun, thought I, that can't be beat.
An' then wun day I seen a bear; just
sittin' there an' sittin' there—l tell
you, I begun to see that feedin' bears
wuz not fer me! But then I says,
"Here, bear, 's some bread;" she riz
up, liked to mashed my head, an' ail
she did wuz take a chunk an' swallow
it, a whoppin' hunk!
Just then the angels took a peek,
an' seen how I wuz kinda weak; I
guess they thought they'd better help,
er I'd be meat to feed her whelp! I
don't see how they done it, but that
there bread she'd up an' et begun to
give her pains, I guess, cause off she
kited, nothin' less!
I tell you, fellers, if you care to do
what I done—feed a bear; just chuck
the stuff—don't hold it tight! Then
mebbe you'll enjoy the sight!—L. A. B.

"Tomorrow," the maiden whispered,
"Tomorrow it will be
"When I shall come, submissive "
When she would come to me!
She flushed when she told me of it,
From her blue eyes dropped two tears;
"We will be once more together,
"Who were parted these many years!"
And I thought with joy of the morrow,
Of the maid I had known from youth;
For, sorrowing, she was coming
So that I could refill her tooth.

the next campus play. When he finally
reached the window and asked the
ticket seller for the best seats he had,

We hear with interest that the Roble
women consumed twenty large cakes

seats in the center section of the As

I alius thought t'ud be such sport to
feed the bears as growl and snort and
give 'em things, and watch 'em eal —
fer fun, thought I, that can't be beat.
An' then wun day I seen a bear; just
sittin' there an' sittin' there—l tell
you, I begun to see that feedin' bears
wuz not fer me! But then I says,
"Here, bear, 's some bread;" she riz
up, liked to mashed my head, an' ail
she did wuz take a chunk an' swallow
it, a whoppin' hunk!
Just then the angels took a peek,
an' seen how I wuz kinda weak; I
guess they thought they'd better help,
er I'd be meat to feed her whelp! I
don't see how they done it, but that
there bread she'd up an' et begun to
give her pains, I guess, cause off she
kited, nothin' less!
I tell you, fellers, if you care to do
what I done—feed a bear; just chuck
the stuff—don't hold it tight! Then
mebbe you'll enjoy the sight!—L. A. B.

"Tomorrow," the maiden whispered,
"Tomorrow it will be
"When I shall come, submissive "
When she would come to me!
She flushed when she told me of it,
From her blue eyes dropped two tears;
"We will be once more together,
"Who were parted these many years!"
And I thought with joy of the morrow,
Of the maid I had known from youth;
For, sorrowing, she was coming
So that I could refill her tooth.
