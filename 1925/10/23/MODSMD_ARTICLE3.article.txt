# EASTERN COLLEGES SETTLE OLD FEUDS
## 
### 
Old rivalries dating back a genera
tion will be revived tomorrow
when several of the larger colleges in
the East will attempt to settle age-old
disputes.
The most conspicuous of these will
be the clash between Harvard and
Dartmouth. Since 1882 these rivals
have njfet thirty-two times on the grid
iron and on twenty-five occasions the
Green was forced to watch the Crim
son carry off the honors. This year
promises to be different as Dartmouth
has another strong team and will en
deavor to duplicate last year's victory
of 6-0.
Another old rivalry is the Yale-
Brown contest, which will have an
added interest for it is the dedication
of the new Brown Stadium at Provi
dence. These two have met thirty
times in the last forty-five years and
the Hulldogs have only been beaten
on three occasions. Brown has not won
since 1916 and it is not likely to break
the spell tomorrow.
The Washington and Jefferson-
Lafayette contest at the Polo Grounds
in New York Is also causing consider
able interest. Princeton and Colgate
will renew an old feud when they meet
in the Palmer Stadium for the first
time since 1922, with the Maroon given
an even chance of upsetting tho Tigers,
due to the great work of Eddie Tryon.
