# ITALIAN DOCUMENTS PLACED ON DISPLAY IN LIBRARY EXHIBIT
## 
### 
A deed supposed' to date back to
998 A.D., is among the parchment
manuscripts which have been in the
cases, at the head of the main stairs
of the Library since the middle of
September. The papers were loaned
to the Library by M. F. Rossi of San
Jose.
The deed is Genoese, and is written
in a script which Library authorities
say may be the Beneventan script
much used in the tenth century. The
paper has as yet not been deciphered.
In the same case with the deed is
an antiphony, Gregorian chant much
used in the medieval church. This
book is very large, being designed to
put at the end of the choir stall for
the whole choir to ÃœBe. Interlinear
notes, seemingly insertions for spe
cific occasions, refer to St. George,
patron saint of Geona, Christopher
Columbus, and Cardinal Sanseverino.
Rossi, the lender of the collection,
claims descent from the Sanseverino
family.
Illuminated Work
The pages of the antiphony are il
luminated in several colors.
Another deed, said by the owner to
come from the fourteenth century,
shows the Latin of the time. This deed
is readable, but the lines are so close
together that it is hard to decipehr.
A richly illuminated diploma from
the University of Naples, which was
founded in the fourteenth century, is
also in the collection. Beside it is a
charter of the Confraternity of the
Rosary, religious organization of the
Catholic church.
To the charter is attached a medal
lion for some undated papal year of
jubilee. The scene portrayed on the
medallion is the opening of the door
of St. Peter's in Rome by the pope.
The papal year of jubilee was insti
tuted in 1300. This year is a jubilee
year.
Old Passport
Another papal document is a pass
port for the Papal States, issued in
1795 to a confectioner of the Vatican.
It gives the bearer full permission to
travel in the Papal States. It is very
large, and is illuminated.
Rossi is an Italian by birth, and has
a library in Italy. He says this collec
tion of parchment manuscripts is only
part of the library he inherited. He
disclaims any knowledge of the origin
of the papers, but says they have been
in his family for a long time.
