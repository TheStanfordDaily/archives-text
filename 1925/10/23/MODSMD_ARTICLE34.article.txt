# SEATING CAPACITY OF STANFORD BOWL TO BE INCREASED
## 
### 
An additional three rows of seats
will be constructed at the stadium
in order to accommodate 3360 appli
cants for tickets to the Big Game,
November 21. Announcement was
made by Alfred R. Masters, gradu
ate manager, that construction will
begin at once on the additional
seats, which will not be permanent.
The new seats will not care for
public or alumni applications, but
will only aid in accommodating stu
dents, practically all of whom have
applied for tickets. Approximately
74,000 persons will be admitted to
the Big Game.
