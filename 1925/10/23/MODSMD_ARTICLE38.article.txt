# ATTEMPT TO IGNITE IDAHO BONFIRE MADE BY WASHINGTON MEN
## 
### 
A tradition somewhat resembling the
former rivalry between Stanford and
California is still in vogue between the
students of the University of Idaho
and Washington State University.
Each fall for many years the foot
ball elevens of the two institutions
have met on the gridiron. The night
before the classic each student group
has its student rally, centered around
a monster bonfire in which all inflam
mable material in both towns is col
lected by squads of freshmen.
For days before the rally night the
collection of material goes on and the
freshmen are assigned the duty of
guarding it. Tradition has it that never
a year passes but that each school
tries prematurely to touch off the bon
fire of the rival.
This year a group of Washington
State students piled into an airplane
and sailed toward the rival campus.
Several fire-bombs were carried on the
expedition, the object being to ignite
the Idaho bonfire.
Idaho students sighted the plane as
it circled over the rally field. Shot
guns were procured. As the plane flew
swiftly over the monstrous pile of
kindling-wood, barely skimming the
top, the guns were fired. Several shots
pierced the wings of the plane, which
flew rapidly off. No injuries occurred
during the raid.
