# LEPROSY ARTICLE BY HASHIMOTO PRINTED
## 
### 
An article on "A Chemical Investiga
tion of Chaulmoogra Oil," by Tadaichi
Hashimoto, who is doing research
work in the Chemistry department,
was published in the September issue
of the "Journal of the American Chem
ical Society."
Chalmoogra is the only known ef
fective remedy for leprosy. It is ob
tained from oil from the seeds of
chaulmoogra trees. Up to the time of
Hashimoto's experiment, extensive in
vestigations had been made with the
object of isolating and identifying the
individual chemical components of the
oil, but none of these investigations
were perfected, except in the finding
of chaulmoogric and hydnocarpic acids.
Hashimoto is now experimenting
with poison oak, for which he is trying
to formulate an antitoxin.
