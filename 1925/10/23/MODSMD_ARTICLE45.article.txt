# DAY'S DOINGS
## 
### Ted Elias, Jr 
Things are happening all around us,
This seems strange but yet it's true,
Come to life and read the "DAILY,"
Find out whom they're happening to.
Oregon will make a journey,
Over miles and miles of ground,
Give the boys a rousing welcome,
Ere we toss their team around.
"Just before the battle, Mother,"
Stanford Babes will all be busy,
Soft'ning up the football field,
And bucking Trojan Freshmen dizzy.
While we're on the football subject,
There's a game that we must mention,
Santa Clara plays our Goofs,
The brawl is worth your close attention,
Now to leave this roughneck subject,
And forget our pigskin lighters,
Presentation of "Dear Brutus,"
Livens things for our First-Nighters.
Pedestrians that walk the streets,
Preoccupied and deep in thought,
Are told to mend their foolish ways,
Or get insurance papers bought.
Skull .and Snakes has shown some
sense,
In breaking up the rowdy stuff,
Traditions here are high enough,
To "Keep the rougneek out of Rough."

Nearly 40,000,000 trees are to be
planted in Britain this year. This is a
part of an extensive reforestation pro
gram.
