# CAMPUS OPINION

### 
The Editor, Sir:
Now that the male element of the
campus seems to suffer considerably<
011 the Quad from the arctic attitude I
of the women, may I venture the sug-;
gestion that they give the chilly sex;
the "go by" which they deserve, and
put themselves in a balmier clime by
greeting the wearers of the dink in- j
stead?
And here's the reason why: Or my j
way to the library this morning, after
passing several of Eve's daughters,
each wearing a cold, haughty, expres- |
sionless stare, indicative of nothing j
less than an abysmal mental vacuity,
a smiling freshman came along and |
exclaimed "Hello!" in a tone of such
warmth and sincere cordiality that I,!
a well-acclimatized native of the cam
pus, simply had to turn and stare at
him. Being an appreciative Scot, my
heart was filled with gladness for the
rest of the morning.
This is not by any means an isolated
case; there are many other such fel- i
lows among the new men. Give me a
cheerful frosli rather than a "beautiful
Stanford co-ed" any time.
