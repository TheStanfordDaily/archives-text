# BEARS WILL MEET HUSKIES IN FIRST CONFERENCE GAME
## Jabs or Griffin May Start at Half to Save Imlay for Later Period 
### 
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA,
Oct. 23. —With every man, Captain
Talma Imlay included, in the best of
condition, the Golden Bear of Califor
nia left his lair for the first time this
season, bound for Portland to meet
Oregon University in the first confer
ence game of the season, for the Bears.
In view of the fact that the trip
north will consume several valuable
days during which the team will not
be able to practice, Andy Smith,
Bruin coach, has put his charges
through the main part of their prepa
ration during the first part of the
week. Workouts, consisting mainly of
signals and punting practice, lasted
well on into the evening both Monday
and Tuesday, and it was necessary to
illuminate the field with searchlights
and to use a white football.
Oregon Has Veterans
The Bears will meet a real formid
able opponent in Oregon this season, a
practically all-veteran team from last
year. Followers of Coast football will
remember that the Oregonians defeat
ed the Washington Huskies last year,
7 to 3, and the Huskies held the Bears
to a 7 to 7 tie on a wet Seattle field.
Lynn Jones, hailed as a second Ernie
Nevers at fullback, is expected to bear
the brunt of the offensive work for the
Oregon eleven while from all reports
the Lemon Yellow line will be well
fitted to take care of the defensive
department.
Imlay May Start
Imlay is in condition to start the
game and will do so unless Smith
chooses to save him for a later period
in the game. The remainder of the
starting lineup is still in doubt. Both
Carlson and Blewett have been calling
signals for the first team this week
while the ends and tackles are also in
doubt.
If Imlay starts, either Jabs or Griffin
will be forced to occupy the bench and
from the way in which both men have
been playing of late, it looks as though
Smith is faced with a real proposition
when it comes to choosing the right
man. In any event, they both are
practically sure of getting into the
game.
