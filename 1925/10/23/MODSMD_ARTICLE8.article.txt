# P. A. A. SWIMMING EVENTS TO BE HELD HERE OCTOBER 31
## 
### 
Stanford will hold three P. A. A.
events in the Encina Pool the after
noon of Saturday, October 31, instead
of four, as was previously announced.
The events will be the 500-yard free
style, the 220-yard breaststroke, and
the pentathlon. The 150-yard back
stroke will be held at the dedication
meet of the new" Athens Club pool in
Oakland, November 6, at the same
time that the P. A. A. 50- and 100-yard
free style, high springboard diving,
and 400-yard relay are put on.
Stanford swimmers are training for
all three events on the 31st. Carl Stev
enson and Arden Allen will compete
in the 500-yard free style and ought
to finish in first and second places. Ted
Smith and Bob Williams will do the
gruelling pentathlon with its four
events and diving competition. Smith,
being a varsity diver, will probably
win the diving, and is going well in
the breaststroke. Williams' speed
ought to give him the 100-yard free
style and a good place in the 500.
George Schroth, the Olympic Club
giant swimmer, will be one of the
most dangerous contenders the Stan
ford men will have for the pentathlon,
as Schroth is good in almost every
department.
Frank Rivas, the Olympic Club
coach, has two fast men entered in the
220 breaststroke: Warren Littlefield
and Eric Kraemer, a former Stanford
swimmer coached by Brandsten. Allen,
who has developed into a first-rate
breast-stroker during summer, is
Stanford's hope in this event. He will
be forced to extend himself to beat
the Olympic Club entries, who have
been swimming the breaststroke for
several years and are not new at it
as Allen is.
