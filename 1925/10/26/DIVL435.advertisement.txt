The Metropolitan Building, New York, is one of the earlier tall build
ings, but its dignity and pleasing lines make it a favorite, and it is hard to

walk. In the tower portion of the building there are six (6) Otis Gearless
Traction Machines, running at 600 Feet per Minute. In the main part of the
building, the old high pressure hydraulic elevators are being replaced by twenty
nine (29) Otis Gearless Traction Micro Drive Elevators of the latest type.
