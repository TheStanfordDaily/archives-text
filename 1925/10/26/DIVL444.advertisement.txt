REX, THE WILD HORSE,
in
"BLACK CYCLONE"
"The Sweetest Story Ever Told"
A love story of a man and a
maid —and the love story of a
horse, wild and unconquered,
and his mate —the story of their
struggles, their battles in the
wolderness for the ladies of their
hearts —and the amazing friend
ship that came between "Black
Cyclone" and the man who was
conquerer, yet a friend.
Acclaimed by critics as the out
standing Photoplay Productions
of recent years!
