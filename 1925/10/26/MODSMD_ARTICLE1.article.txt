# WOMEN'S ASSEMBLY TO DISCUSS POINT SYSTEM PROPOSALS
## Committee to Make Inquiry Into Tentative Plans May Be Selected 
### 
Whether or not a committee shall
be appointed to further investigate a
point system for Stanford women will
be the main question for discussion at
the annual Women's Assembly to be
held in the Little Theatre tomorrow
morning at 9 o'clock. Mildred Wors
wick, president of Associated Women
Students, will preside at the meeting.
"If you think a point system should
be installed at Stanford at all," said
Miss Worswick, in speaking of the
propositions, "you should vote 'yes,' so
that a committee would be given the
â€¢chance to work out a system that
would be best adapted to the condi
tions here. Even though you have seen
point systems succeed or fail in other
universities, do not form your opinion
about a point system at Stanford until
you have seen the one that the com
mittee presents to you after they have
found the one best suited for our con
ditions."
The question to be discussed and
voted upon is: "A committee shall be
appointed to draw up a poipt system
which will be voted upon by the wo
men in the regular student election in
February 1926." If the motion is car
ried, a committee will be appointed to
investigate the subject, gather all per
tinent information, and include in their
work a survey of the point systems
which have been successes or failures
in other universities. From their in
vestigations and discussion, they will
formulate a system for Stanford which
will be presented to the women the
early part of winter quarter. Any sug
gestions or criticisms the women wish
to make on the point systems they
present will then be considered, and
the redraft of the system will be put
on the ballot at the mid-year elections.
If a point system is adopted, it will
go into effect in the fall of 1926. If it
is rejected, the idea of a point system
will be permanently abandoned.
Jean Ward, president of W. A. A.,
will explain the various fields of work
open to the women in connection with
the Fiesta to be given next spring
quarter.
The meeting will be called to order
promptly at 9:10. Every woman is
urged to be at the meeting on time,
and to voice her opinion on the sub
jects brought up. Unless the women
take an active part in these meetings,
future assemblies will not be granted.
These assemblies are now held annu
ally.
