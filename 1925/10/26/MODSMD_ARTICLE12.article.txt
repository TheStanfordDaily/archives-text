# FRESHMAN UNABLE TO BREAK TROJAN JINX
## Elliott's Kick Gives U. S. C. Margin for Victory in Game Saturday 
### Frank Baker 
As Bud Elliott's educated toe booted j
a twenty-yard place kick over the bar
in the fourth quarter, Stanford fresh
men's hopes to break the U. S. C. jinx
vanished. The kick made the score
9 to 6 in the Trojans' favor, and so
it remained until the end of the game, i
though the Cardinals attempted a des-1
perate comeback on forward passes. I
This marks the third consecutive year j
of victory for the U. S. C. freshmen, j
who have won every year since 1922 !
when Ernie Nevers, Muggs Mitchell, j
and Swede Solomon managed to eke j
out a 10 to 9 victory.
Wilton Stars
Frank Wilton, 150-pound Card half-!
back, carried away the honors of the |
day on the offense. He was a triple j
threat man all through the game, pass- j
ing, kicking, and running with equal
facility. His kicks averaged over 45 j
yards and were placed accurately. The
70-yard run he made through the
whole U. S. C. team was exceptionally
spectacular. Bob Sims was the shining
light on the defense, playing a hard,
consistent game. Near the end of the
first half Frost, a light halback, was
substituted for Sims, and did some
nice work in receiving passes. The j
loss of Tandy in the first half was j
keenly felt, for the big tackle would !
have strengthened the line in the last
period when the Cardinals made their :
final attempt to put the ball over.
Numerous Fumbles
Fumbles marred the playing of both \
teams. Stanford's touchdown was'
made by Wilton on the 70-yard run j
through U. S. C.'s complete team, with i
Doyle deserving credit for blocking a
Trojan man near the goal line. The j
Southerners' first six points were made j
by McCaslin, who caught a beautiful
35-yard pass from Dihel. Both teams j
failed to convert.
At times Hunt's proteges showed j
real football, but at other times they i
appeared disastrously green. The
game was a good test for the fresh
men and gave Coach Hunt a better
idea of weaknesses that must be over
come before the Little Big Game on
November 7th.

Ends, Harder and Rehrig; Tackles,
Artman and Tandy; Guards, Doyle and
