# SOPHOMORES, BABES EASILY WIN INITIAL CLASS GRID GAMES
## 
### 
In the first of the series of int.erclass
| football games the freshman eleven,
I Saturday morning, playing a good
brand of straight football, easily de
feated the sophomores 19-0, while the
, seniors swamped the junior team un
der the score of 41-0.
Both games furnished the spectators
thrills but the best one of all came
during the senior junior game. During
a melee following a fumble near the
junior's goal posts, Herz, a senior,
nabbed the ball and, in the excitement
of the moment ran down the field to-
I ward his own goal. After he had cov
| ered about 20 yards one of his team
mates caught him and told him of his
mistake. Not a whit dismayed Herz
; turned to run behind his benefactor to
j the junior goal line for a touchdown.
The senior game was a riot of touch
downs. In the first few minutes of play
I the juniors surprised themselves and
| their opponents by perfect defense
j work on the part of the line, but when
| McHose opened up with a dazzling
passing attack, all competition ceased,
| Six times the seniors crossed the op
posing goal line, to miss converting
but once.
Only by chance were the sophomores
| able to hold the freshmen to such a
low score. Working in perfect co-ordi
nation the '29 eleven carried the ball
i for downs consistently, while the
; sophmores vainly tried to stop this
j offensive.
