# BARRIE'S "DEAR BRUTUS" IS JOURNEY TO IMAGINATIVE LAND OF "MIGHT HAVE BEEN"
## 
### 
By Isabel Schanck
The subtle elaboration of an obvious
| idea, without any great amount of dra
i matic action makes a successful pro
| duction of a play such as "Dear
i Brutus" a very difficult undertaking
for amateur actors, when they must
face a college audience.
One must be in a mood to accept
; Barrie's psychology of fantasy in order
| to feel perfectly at east when the
i curtain rises on the erstwhile disdain
i ful Lady Caroline Laney begging to
"hold the dahling match" for the also
erstwhile dishonest butler's cigar. The
delightful whimsicality of such inci
dents as Mr. Dearth's futile attempt
; to light his cigarette with his eyes
' closed have the broad appeal which
! accounts for Barrie's popularity.
An adventure into the "might have
been," instigated by Lob for his house
guests for mid-summer week is the
central theme of the play. "The second
chance" which each character is given
is worked out consistently, with re
sults both amusing and pathetic.
Paul Hays in the role of Mr. Dearth,
i the artist, was outstanding. He inter

preted his part with a graceful ease
and natural amiability which made
him most human. The role of Lob,
"what Puck would have been, if he
had forgotten to die," was taken by
A. Grove Day. In spite of the handicap
or grotesquely overdone make-up, Day
was able to give some splendid bits
of characterization.
Lack of sustained action in the sec
ond act prevented Marjorie Allen from
making the most of the opportunity
of her role as Margaret, the dream
daughter of Mr. Dearth.
The philandering Mr. Purdie and his
stalwart belief in himself as a "soul
who walks alone," furnished most of
the humor of the play. Mrs. Purdie and
Joanna Trout, played by Marian Rob
erts and Adelaide Mack, were his vic
tims during the first two acts, and
the end of the third showed promise of
i a new adventure with Lady Caroline
| Laney (Barbara Eubanks). Lady Caro
j line and Matey (Jacob Irwin) were an
unusual combination.
Lucie Bentley as Mrs. Dearth showed
! flashes of good acting, but the flat,
sentimental ending of the play de
| tracted from the realistic quality.

The subtle elaboration of an obvious
| idea, without any great amount of dra
i matic action makes a successful pro
| duction of a play such as "Dear
i Brutus" a very difficult undertaking
for amateur actors, when they must
face a college audience.
One must be in a mood to accept
; Barrie's psychology of fantasy in order
| to feel perfectly at east when the
i curtain rises on the erstwhile disdain
i ful Lady Caroline Laney begging to
"hold the dahling match" for the also
erstwhile dishonest butler's cigar. The
delightful whimsicality of such inci
dents as Mr. Dearth's futile attempt
; to light his cigarette with his eyes
' closed have the broad appeal which
! accounts for Barrie's popularity.
An adventure into the "might have
been," instigated by Lob for his house
guests for mid-summer week is the
central theme of the play. "The second
chance" which each character is given
is worked out consistently, with re
sults both amusing and pathetic.
Paul Hays in the role of Mr. Dearth,
i the artist, was outstanding. He inter

preted his part with a graceful ease
and natural amiability which made
him most human. The role of Lob,
"what Puck would have been, if he
had forgotten to die," was taken by
A. Grove Day. In spite of the handicap
or grotesquely overdone make-up, Day
was able to give some splendid bits
of characterization.
Lack of sustained action in the sec
ond act prevented Marjorie Allen from
making the most of the opportunity
of her role as Margaret, the dream
daughter of Mr. Dearth.
The philandering Mr. Purdie and his
stalwart belief in himself as a "soul
who walks alone," furnished most of
the humor of the play. Mrs. Purdie and
Joanna Trout, played by Marian Rob
erts and Adelaide Mack, were his vic
tims during the first two acts, and
the end of the third showed promise of
i a new adventure with Lady Caroline
| Laney (Barbara Eubanks). Lady Caro
j line and Matey (Jacob Irwin) were an
unusual combination.
Lucie Bentley as Mrs. Dearth showed
! flashes of good acting, but the flat,
sentimental ending of the play de
| tracted from the realistic quality.
