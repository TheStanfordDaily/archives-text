### Wilbur Adams 
(JTANFORD 26, O. A. C. 10.
The score tells nothing of the type of contest that 25,000 spectators
witnessed in the Stanford Stadium Saturday afternoon and evening. A com
plete stoi y of the game can hardly indicate how close and how spectatcular the
contest was. With the one drawback that the game ended a few minutes
before total darkness set in the game proved most thrilling.
O. A. C. made the first score, not on a fluke, but by real football. The
Aggies went, from the center of the field to Stanford's 7-yard line on two
passes and on two first downs made by playing straight football. Under her
own goal post the Cardinals held and Schulmerich was called back for a

kick. The Oregon fullback
kicked the goal without trouble, and
by this and other performances proved
himself the Aggie star.
Nevers Performs
It was Nevers who put Stanford in
the lead at the beginning of the sec
| ond period. A pass, Nevers to Hill,
i and another one, Nevers to Hyland,
netted Stanford twenty-nine yards.
Hill runs sixteen yards, and then
i Nevers bucks the ball the remaining
i distance. So the half ended with Stan
i ford holding a four-point lead.
The Card supporters breathed easier
when Shipkey made a touchdown early
in the third quarter on the famous
| end-around play. It took Stanford just
twelve plays in four and a half min
! utes to go from her own 26-yard line
to this second touchdown. Stanford's
[ breathing spell suddenly came to an
; end five minutes later. With the ball
■in midfield Denman passed to Ward
j who ran to the 3-yard line and then
: the Aggies bucked it over, and Stan
| ford's lead was reduced to three tal
lies.
Poulson had doctor's orders to keep
out of the battle, but about this time
: Pop Warner rushed him to the rescue.
Poulson intercepted a forward pass on
the 19-yard line, and Nevers bucked
the distance in two plays. The game
was won right there, but to make
things more certain, Patchett, who
| had replaced the Cardinal captain,
! bucked his way to one more touch
down. Darkness settled upon the sta
dium, and few besides the players
could see the ball on the Aggies' three
yard line when the gun ended Stan
ford's second conference contest.
Stanford made twenty-five first
downs during the afternoon while the
Aggies made eight, and six of these
eight were made by forward passes.
Nevers made ten of Stanford's first
downs, and averaged five and a half
yards each time he carried the ball.
He made 126 yards and carried the ball
twenty-four times. Hyland got away for
one run of twenty-five yards while Hill
made forty-three yards in the first
three times he carried the ball. Both
Murphy and Bogue were consistent
with their gaining Saturday. Stanford
completed fourteen forward passes out
of the twenty-three attempts during
the first half. Only one pass was inter
cepted by O. A. C.
