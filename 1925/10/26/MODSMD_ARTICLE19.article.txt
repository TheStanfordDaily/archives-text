# FOSTER PARENTS, CHILDREN MENTAL LIKENESS STUDIED
## 
### 
The intellectual resemblance be
tween foster parents and foster chil
dren as shown by mental tests has
been the object of study of the Psy-
I chology department since January. The
purpose of this work is to compare the
resemblance of foster parent to foster
child with the amount of resemblance
of true parent to the true child. The
outcome will give much light on the
i question of heredity and environment.
The result of the mental tests will
I decide in a great measure the influence
of environment. If the intellectual re
semblance of foster parents to their
foster children corresponds to that of
true parents, environment will be the
responsible factor. If a child adopted
in his first year shows no more intel
i lectual resemblance to his foster par
ent than to any parent selected at
random, then heredity will be proved
the governing factor in a child's life.
Stanford has been giving mental
| tests to foster parents of children
under the direction of Dr. Terman of
i the Psychology department, and Bar
bara Burks, his research assistant.
They are confining the study to foster
children who were adopted in the first
year of life in order to find the influ
ence of environment over a long period
! of time.
The movement is financed by the
, Commonwealth Fund of New York.
One hundred and fifty families in the
Bay Cities and Los Angeles have been
I studied.
