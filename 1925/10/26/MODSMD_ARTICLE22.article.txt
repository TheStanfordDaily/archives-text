# "Cigarettes and Restraint"
## 
### 
Co-eds at Northwestern University are becoming 1 so addicted to the
cigarette habit that it has been necessary to lay down rigid rules and
outline disciplinary measures in an effort to stop the practice. An
editorial appearing - in the Daily Northwestern on October 15 derided
cigarette smoking among women, declaring that only one woman in fifty
can smoke properly, and the rest merely do it to be "smart." The edi
torial follows:
" 'Co-eds of Northwestern University have been warned that if they
smoke a single cigarette they will be expelled.' A Chicago newspaper
attributes this remark to Dean Winifred G. Richardson.
"Cigarette smoking by university co-eds is an imbecility. These college
girls do not smoke for enjoyment, though they use local hotel rest rooms
for the surreptitious cigarette. They smoke to be smart, because it is a
sign of emancipation from the small town, because it is a daring thing to
do in classic Evanston. Moreover, they chain-smoke, holding their
"nails" as an aborigine would a fork. It is ridiculous and disgusting
because it is a pose.
"American females, and the Northwestern coterie is no exception, do
not take naturally to smoking. One in twenty-live enjoys it, one in fifty
knows how to smoke, and one in a thousand knows what moderation
means. Smoking is an art, not an artifice. It should be enjoyed in the
continental way, casually, as is a demi-tasse.
"It is therefore necessary that our campus and country juveniles learn,
first of all, casualness, moderation, restraint.
"A modern writer has stated that only through restraint may the
highest pleasure be obtained. This statement is applicable to a dozen
other town and gown enormities besides inhaling. We suggest a course
in the technique of restraint in dress, in manners, in living, in loving.
Until the lesson is learned our little flapper ednas should be coerced by
rules; put to bed early and rigorously chastized if caught dating on
dateless night using a lipstick, or a 'single cigarette.'
