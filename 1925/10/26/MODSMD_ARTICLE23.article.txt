# All-American Material

No one who saw the stellar work of Captain Ernie Nevers Saturday
can doubt his worthiness for a place on this year's mythical All-American
eleven. The plenipotentiary fullback crashed through the O. A. C. line
twenty-four times for a total gain of 126 yards! This is an average gain
of 5.6 yards for every time he carried the ball—which is remarkable for
line-smashing against a good defense.
But Nevers' work does not stop with steam-roller tactics. Against
U. S. C. his kicking was nothing less than phenomenal, averaging 45
yards—and that included a kick that was blocked. Saturday his kicks
averaged more than 40 yards. \\ hen he isn t kicking or carrying the
ball he manages to keep busy tossing passes or backing up the line on
defense. lie is a whirlwind of speed for his size and has a real intuition
when it comes to figuring out where the next play is coming. A large
per cent of the tackles made by Stanford men must be credited to this
veritable cyclone.
It is extremely unfortunate that Walter Camp is not living, for Nevers
deserves a place on an eleven selected by that great dean of football.
A flock of younger authorities will have their choices in the field this
year, however, and none of them can afford to overlook Stanford s bril
liant fullback, who glitters and shines as well on defense as he does on
the triple threats of offense.
