Stanford spectators at the Cardinal-U. S. C. game in Los Angeles
got a real thrill when they read this on page 14 of the souvenir program:
SCORE FOR TODAY
Stanford 10, Southern California 27
NEXT SATURDAY
• Come and see Arizona get beat by a 50 to 0 score by
the Trojans in the Coliseum.
And after Stanford trounced the Trojans, everyone smiled broadly and
allowed Los Angeles the boasting championship, the real estate champion
ship, but certainly not the football title. Yet the Trojans came back like
a flash Saturday and pounded up their fifty points against Arizona—and
had a touchdown to spare. Maybe they're half-way honest down there,
although wc never knew it before.
