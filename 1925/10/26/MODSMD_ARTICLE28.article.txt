DISSERTATION ON SNAKES
; Definition: A snake is an elongated,
flexible animal with a head at one
| end and a body at the other.
| Description: Snakes come in differ
ent sizes according to demand but they
j usuall range from one foot to eight
feet in length. In some of the six-foot
1 varieties the proportions are apparent
j ly much increased in size by a peculiar
sort of "line" that is given off, but this
increase in size is in reality an optical
' illusion. Most snakes are very close
to the ground. Tliev come in all colors
but the most popular shades are tans,
! blues, and grays. Contrary to all re-
I ports, snakes posses neither shoulders
! nor hips, although instances have been
cited where snakes transported things
on the last mentioned part of the
anatomy.
In general, snakes do not possess
very great mental capacities. In some
I varieties the vacuum was so great that
when the brain cavity was punctured
all the air in the laboratory was drawn
into it, greatly endangering the life
of the experimenter.
Varieties: There are about 15,000 va
rieties of snakes and of these at least
250 have been identified on the Stan
ford campus. We will not attempt to
I describe all the varieties, however, be
| cause in general they are all alike. One
of the best-known varieties locally is
the snake called Reptilla neckiferous.
This snake has a strange affinity for
syncopated music. Another of its hab
its is that of getting itself tangled up
after dark, especially when there is a
full moon.
Another well-known variety is the
Reptilla alcoholic. This is a very ex
clusive kind of snake. The conditions
under which it is seen are extraor
dinary but not rare. Another peculiar
variety is the apple snake. This ani
mal is found constantly carrying an
apple around which it offers to people.
It is believed that this snake is uie
ancestral variety of all snakes. The
male garter snake is now almost cx
tinct in this vicinity.
Character: In general, snakes have
no use for a character because they
never show signs of having one. How
ever, some snakes are very sociable
after they have been tamed. Women
are the most successful at doing this.
Some varieties, however, can nn>'fir oe
tamed, and cases are known where a
supposedly tame snake suddenly re
verted to the wild state.
Use: The uselessness of snakes in
creases with the size.
Arguments for: None.

Varieties: There are about 15,000 va
rieties of snakes and of these at least
250 have been identified on the Stan
ford campus. We will not attempt to
I describe all the varieties, however, be
| cause in general they are all alike. One
of the best-known varieties locally is
the snake called Reptilla neckiferous.
This snake has a strange affinity for
syncopated music. Another of its hab
its is that of getting itself tangled up
after dark, especially when there is a
full moon.
Another well-known variety is the
Reptilla alcoholic. This is a very ex
clusive kind of snake. The conditions
under which it is seen are extraor
dinary but not rare. Another peculiar
variety is the apple snake. This ani
mal is found constantly carrying an
apple around which it offers to people.
It is believed that this snake is uie
ancestral variety of all snakes. The
male garter snake is now almost cx
tinct in this vicinity.
Character: In general, snakes have
no use for a character because they
never show signs of having one. How
ever, some snakes are very sociable
after they have been tamed. Women
are the most successful at doing this.
Some varieties, however, can nn>'fir oe
tamed, and cases are known where a
supposedly tame snake suddenly re
verted to the wild state.
Use: The uselessness of snakes in
creases with the size.
Arguments for: None.

Snake Library.
DISSERTATION ON SNAKES
; Definition: A snake is an elongated,
flexible animal with a head at one
| end and a body at the other.
| Description: Snakes come in differ
ent sizes according to demand but they
j usuall range from one foot to eight
feet in length. In some of the six-foot
1 varieties the proportions are apparent
j ly much increased in size by a peculiar
sort of "line" that is given off, but this
increase in size is in reality an optical
' illusion. Most snakes are very close
to the ground. Tliev come in all colors
but the most popular shades are tans,
! blues, and grays. Contrary to all re-
I ports, snakes posses neither shoulders
! nor hips, although instances have been
cited where snakes transported things
on the last mentioned part of the
anatomy.
In general, snakes do not possess
very great mental capacities. In some
I varieties the vacuum was so great that
when the brain cavity was punctured
all the air in the laboratory was drawn
into it, greatly endangering the life
of the experimenter.
