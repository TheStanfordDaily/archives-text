Things are happening all around us,
Things are happening, that's no lie,
And the ones who read the Daily,
Find out where and when and why.
Stanford's fighting Cardinal warriors,
Gloriously a vict'ry copped,
And they showed the multitudes,
That Ernie Nevers can't be stopped.
And our freshmen, scrapping hard,
Until the final whistle blew,
Met defeat by Trojan youngsters,
They were whipped, but never through.
Lights that flashed above the campus,
Started up an awful fuss.
Now we know 'twas but the army,
Playing abstract tag with us.
Literary Publication
Has its tryouts for the staff;
Anyone is welcome there
Who thinks that he can stand the gaff.
