# STANFORD MEDICAL DEPARTMENT RANKS WITH STATE'S BEST
## School of Medicine Pioneer in Field; Foundations Started in 1858 
### 
Only two medical schools in the
state of California have been consid
ered of such standing by the Council
on Medical Education to be ranked
"Class A." These institutions are Stan
ford University and University of Cali
fornia Medical Schools.
The beginnings of the Stanford Uni
versity Medical School were made in
San Francisco when medical schools
were in the pioneer stage. Dr. Elias
Samuel Cooper founded his school of
medicine in 1858, which was called
"The Medical Department of the Col
lege of the Pacific," and was the first
medical college west of the Rockies. In
later years it was renamed "The
Cooper Medical College" by Dr. Levi
Lane, a nephew of Dr. Cooper.
Lane Hospital, located at Clay and
Webster streets, San Francisco, was
built by Dr. Levi Cooper Lane in 1882,
and is directly connected with the old
building which housed the medical
college. Stanford University assumed
the responsibilities of the school on
October 30, 1908, and has since then
developed the hospital, laboratory, and
clinic.
Hospital Built in 1917
The Stanford University Hospital
was completed in 1917 and has a
capacity of 130 beds. It contains a
hydrotherapeutic department, Zander
room, X-ray department, and clinical
laboratory. Directly across the street
from the two University hospitals is
located the recently constructed Stan
ford School of Nursing building. It is
a concrete structure of seven stories
accommodating 200 student nurses and
is connected directly with the two hos
pitals by a tunnel running under the
street.
By the terms of the will of Mrs.
Lane the directors of the Cooper
Medical College in 1912 erected the
Lane Medical Library building on the
southeast corner of Sacramento and
Webster streets, San Francisco. It is
a fireproof structure of Colusa sand
stone three and a half stories high, and
shelves 57,000 volumes. Seventy per
sons can be accommodated in the main
reading room, which is decorated by
three allegorical paintings of Mat
thews.
A duplicate collection of 15,000 vol
umes, which is used for out-of-town
loans, is shelved in the attic, and the
Barkan collection of Opthalmology is
housed in the west portion of the
mezzanine floor. About 500 current
periodicals are received and bound by
the library.
Handle 1000 Patients
Located in the clinical and labora
tory building is the out-patient depart
ment which has a daily attendance of
248 patients. At the present time the
Stanford University Medical School
controls 275 beds in the San Francisco
hospital averaging over 1000 patients
a month. Both private and clinical pa
tients are received in the Lane Hos
pital while only private cases are
treated in the Stanford University
Hospital.
Thirty-three students, of which four
were women, were granted the degree
of doctor of medicine in 1924, and
forty-six special workers were regis
tered in the school. Last fall fifty-eight
students were registered at San Fran
cisco and this fall quarter sixty-three
students are registered in the Medical
School.
