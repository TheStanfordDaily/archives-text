# CATHCART BLAMES POLITICS FOR CRIME WAVE IN AMERICA
## 
### 
Ascribing to maudlin sentimentality,
to politics, and to a misguided sense of
sympathy, a large degree of responsi
bility for the so-called "crime wave"
now sweeping over the country, Dr.
A. M. Cathcart delivered an address
at All Saints Episcopal Church yester
day morning.
Dr. Cathcart spoke of laws as a part
of the tolls society exacts for commer
cial advancement. "We must submit to
the inevitable and pay the price of
progress, but we should avoid regula
tion merely for the sake of regula
tion," he said. "I know that there are
large numbers of people who will
charge present unwholesome condi
tions to the Volstead law, and to other
laws of which they disapprove, but this
in no sense accounts for the multiplied
figures we have touching the more
serious crimes, such as murder, bur
glary, and banditry."
Dr. Cathcart discredited another
popular fallacy, that crime is a na
tural consequence of the World War,
by introducing statistics showing that
there have been no corresponding in
creases of crime in either England or
France. The reason for this he attri
buted to the fact that in the European
countries the assurance of certain and
swift punishment was ever present.
"When crime in England became un
safe, it subsided, and when it is made
unsafe in this country, our experiences
will be the same," he remarked.
In a plea for better business admin
istration which should extend to the
government, Dr. Cathcart urged the
whole-hearted co-operation of citizens
and community clubs with the present
movement of the American Bar Asso
ciation for stricter supervision and
less bunglesome laws, to thus encour
age the better element of citizenship.
