# OLYMPIC CLUB BEATS CARD SOCCER ELEVEN
## Varsity Outclassed During Entire Contest; Lacks Strong Offensive 
### 
With a fast-working forward line,
the Olympic Club defeated the Stan
ford varsity soccer team by a score
of 4 to 1 Saturday afternoon on the
stadium field.
The Redshirts were outclassed
throughout the entire game and most
of the contest was played in Stanford
territory. At the end of the first half
the Olympics led 2 to 0. Miles Gray,
varsity goalkeeper, prevented numer
ous scores during this period.
A penalty kick in the second half
gave the varsity its only tally of the
day. Miron, inside right, succeeded in
kicking the ball past the Olympic
goalkeeper. Failure to use their out
side forwards caused the varsity of
fensive to be ineffective.
San Anselmo Seminary will play the
varsity on Wednesday and a game
with Pescadero high school has been
scheduled for the freshman squad on
Friday afternoon. Both contests will
be played on the stadium field and will
give the soccer teams excellent prac
tice games.
The lineup for the Olympic Club
game was as follows: Schoen, o.l.;
Quigley, i.1.; Bailard, c.f.; Miron, i.r.;
Farwell, 0.r.; Cannon, 1.h.b.; Franklin,
c.li.b.; Bushnell, r.h.b.; Holmes, 1.f.b.;
Stollery, r.f.b.; Gray, goal.
