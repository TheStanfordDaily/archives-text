# SPORTS OF 1925
## A 						Stanford Star 
### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Last year I was talking to "Pop" Warner about Jim Thorpe. "He was the
greatest player I ever saw," said the grizzled old veteran. "He could do
everything well —his only trouble was that he was a bit lazy. McLaren was
the greatest player I coached at Pittsburgh, but I have a man here in Ernie
Nevers who should be greater than McLaren, because he can do more. He
might even be greater than Thorpe."
Now, that is indeed high praise from one of the oldest and greatest football
coaches in the country, but from all that I have seen of Ernie Nevers, he
deserves it. The public at large first heard of this versatile athlete when
Walter Camp placed him on his third All-America team in 1923. All last
year he was on the side lines with an injured foot, even unable to get into
Stanford's "big game" with the University of California. But Ernie's foot
was well by the end of December and he was able to play in the New Year s
Day game against Notre Dame.
And play he did, too! He passed, punted, and plunged his way over and
through the Irish team, being easily one of the outstanding stars of the game.
Expert critics praised him as the greatest fullback in the country.
