# GRAYS' CONTEST WITH BRONCOS CANCELED
## 
### 
Santa Clara Reserves forfeited last
Saturday's game with the Stanford
Grays. The forfeit was made because
Santa Clara could not collect enough
uninjured men to make up a squad.
This contest was greatly needed by
the Grays, as the coach, Hal Davis, has
had little opportunity to see his men
in action and to get a line on them
for the coming game with the Cali
fornia Reserves on November 7. There
is plenty of good material on the squad
but Davis has not yet had the chance
to select the best men.
