# WORKS OF GERMAN COMPOSERS TO BE PLAYED IN RECITAL
## 
### Herbert Klein 
At 4:15 o'clock tomorrow afternoon
i Warren D. Allen will give a program
of organ music in Memorial Church.
Four numbers, representing such com
posers as Bach, Handel, and Mendels
sohn, will be given, opening with the
"Sinfonia" from George Fredrich Han
| del's oratorio, "Saul."
j Handel (1658-1759), although a Ger
man, lived most of his life in England,
where he wrote many operas and ora
torios. In oratorio he especially ex
celled and helped to make it a well
known and effective form of composi
tion.
"Courante in A Major," a classical
piece by J. S. Bach, will follow. Much
of the best of Bach's invaluable work
in music was done in his dance forms
which have depth and seriousness as
well as grace and rhythm. Guilmant,
whose "Pastorale from the First
Sonata" is to be played, is known as
a French organ player and composer.
This movement from his sonata is in
the charming pastorale form with its
suggestion of "shepherds and maidens."
The closing selection will be two
movements from "Organ Sonata Num
ber 1 in F Minor," by Felix Mendels
solin-Bartholdy. The movements are
the "Adagio" or slow movement, and
the "Finale." Mendelssohn wrote for
the organ -as well as for almost all
other musical instruments, and was a
great admirer and student of the
works of Bach, which he was instru
mental in bringing to the attention of
the world.
