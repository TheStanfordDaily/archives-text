# BABE SOCCER TEAM DEFEATED BY HALF MOON BAY HIGH 1-0
## 
### 
Showing a lack of teamwork in their
first game of the season, the freshman
soccer outfit was defeated Friday
afternoon by the Half Moon Bay high
school eleven 1 to 0.
Starting off with a rush, the high
school team booted the ball deep into
the freshman territory where most of
the play in the first half was held.
The visitors' speedy backfield kept the
freshman backs continually on the de
fensive and only the work of Van
Nuys, babe goalkeeper, prevented nu
merous goals.
On two occasions the freshmen
threatened in the first period, but each
time were turned back when a well- j
timed kick meant a score. Bovet, who
played right fullback for the entire!
game, broke up the Half Moon Bay;
squad's attack repeatedly.
Don Clark, soccer coach, made nu-1
merous changes in the lineup during
the second half in order to try out ;
individual players. Half Moon Bay!
scored a goal in the last period when
Isador, high school inside left, kicked j
the ball into the net for the only tally
of the game after the fullback had 1
been drawn in on the play.
Daily practice will be held in order '
to get the freshmen to get teamwork
and to develop a fast offensive. Gil- j
bert, inside right, was the outstanding'
man of the forward line, while Van 1
Nuys steadied the backfield and
played an excellent game.
