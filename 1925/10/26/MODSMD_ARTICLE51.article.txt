| The Editor, Sir:
The vitriolic attack contained in last
j night's issue upon women in general
I and their conversation in particular
I placed undue emphasis, it seems to
me, upon the one element of Stanford's
population. The author of these re
marks has been very careful to pre
sent only one side of the case which is,
i I grant, a sensible procedure under
the circumstances. But perhaps
through unfortunate accident his con
tacts have not enabled him to get a
true perspective on the situation.
This evening a very peculiar thing
occurred just outside that Library
' which is much too solemn and sacred
a place for the discussion of anything
less important than the latest odds
offered on the game. A man carrying
I "his burden and that of another" sad
-1 denly gurgled much affer the fashion
'of a gleeful infant and choked out, "Oh,
I oh yes. It's a secret!" Well, of course
| it may have been a very excellent one,
quite full of innocent fun . Then,
further, under the trees nearby, a
j struggling mass proved to be another
jof these superior creatures giving
j voice to some undoubtedly splendid
! lines, the tenor of which we regret to
jsay sank to an indistinguishable mur
; mur upon the sound of approaching
j footsteps. Otherwise these words
might have been preserved to posterity
| as a true expression of that inner self
found at last in the starless night.
Needless to state, there are many
more incidents showing in the same
| manner to what sublime heights wo
men might rise if only they would be
guided by those wiser than themselves.
Suffice it to say, however, that there
are people and people—some of them
] rather conspicuously short-sighted
where it happens to suit their some
| what vague purposes. —R. M.

j The Editor, Sir:
Equal participation and lack of
clique spirit in activities have been
the bases for the point system in
women's activities sponsored by Wo
-1 men's Council and supported in
1 Wednesday night's editorial in the
: D. P. A.
Such a step, as women's activities
now exist at Stanford, seems to me
unnecessary. Every woman entering
; Stanford is urged to go out for ac
! tivities, and whether she does or not
: depends solely on her own prefer
ences and ambitions. I think the clique
spirit remarkable by its absence. The
list of women, prominent in executive,
dramatic, or journalistic activities on
i the Campus, represents every living
group and type. Few women hold high
positions in more than one field,
though some may hold more than one
: position in the vai'ious phases of her
j field.
]f a woman, possessed of sufficient
| time, strength, ambition, and satisfac
tory scholastic record, has proven by
the tryoutee system that she is the
best person for more than one job,
why should the risk of inefficiency in
I office be taken by keeping her out
due to her varied interests so that
another woman of either less initiative
lor less ability should be given an
office? —A. W.,'27.

j The Editor, Sir:
Equal participation and lack of
clique spirit in activities have been
the bases for the point system in
women's activities sponsored by Wo
-1 men's Council and supported in
1 Wednesday night's editorial in the
: D. P. A.
Such a step, as women's activities
now exist at Stanford, seems to me
unnecessary. Every woman entering
; Stanford is urged to go out for ac
! tivities, and whether she does or not
: depends solely on her own prefer
ences and ambitions. I think the clique
spirit remarkable by its absence. The
list of women, prominent in executive,
dramatic, or journalistic activities on
i the Campus, represents every living
group and type. Few women hold high
positions in more than one field,
though some may hold more than one
: position in the vai'ious phases of her
j field.
]f a woman, possessed of sufficient
| time, strength, ambition, and satisfac
tory scholastic record, has proven by
the tryoutee system that she is the
best person for more than one job,
why should the risk of inefficiency in
I office be taken by keeping her out
due to her varied interests so that
another woman of either less initiative
lor less ability should be given an
office? —A. W.,'27.
| The Editor, Sir:
The vitriolic attack contained in last
j night's issue upon women in general
I and their conversation in particular
I placed undue emphasis, it seems to
me, upon the one element of Stanford's
population. The author of these re
marks has been very careful to pre
sent only one side of the case which is,
i I grant, a sensible procedure under
the circumstances. But perhaps
through unfortunate accident his con
tacts have not enabled him to get a
true perspective on the situation.
This evening a very peculiar thing
occurred just outside that Library
' which is much too solemn and sacred
a place for the discussion of anything
less important than the latest odds
offered on the game. A man carrying
I "his burden and that of another" sad
-1 denly gurgled much affer the fashion
'of a gleeful infant and choked out, "Oh,
I oh yes. It's a secret!" Well, of course
