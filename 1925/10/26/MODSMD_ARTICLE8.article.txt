# LIEURANCES WILL GIVE RECITAL OF U.S. INDIAN MUSIC
## Composer of "By Waters of Minnetonka" Is Versed In Lore of Redman 
### 
Thurlow Lieurance, who has spent
many years in making studies and
transcriptions of the music of native
American Indians, will give a recital [
tomorrow evening at 7:30 o'clock in j
the Assembly hall under the auspices j
of the Committee on Public Exercises.
Lieurance is best known to the world !
; as the composer of the song, "By the j
Waters of Minnetonka," which has met I
with widespread popularity.
Appearing with him will be Mrs. '
| Lieurance, formerly Edna Wooley, who
is probably one of the greatest inter-'
i preters of Indian songs and melodies j
j in the world. Lillian Reed, flutist, will j
I accompany the Lieurances.
] Besides the many songs taken di- j
| rectly from Indian sources, Lieurance :
' has composed other music, much of it j
: in the spirit of nature and the out-1
doors. His work among the Indians,
which extends over a twenty-year ]
period, is notable both in its originality j
| and in the quantity and completeness !
| of the material gathered. Several hun-!
dred records made by him from the !
actual native singers are in a perma-1
nent collection in the Smithsonian In
stitute in Washington. He has har
monized nearly one hundred native
songs, thereby uncovering a veritable
gold mine of melody and rhythm.
Critics all over the country have j
given unstinted praise to the Lieu- j
ranees and their art. James Francis;
| Cooke, editor of "Etude" says that
j their concerts are the most distinctive
j of their kind that he has ever heard
I and that "audiences have been enrap-1
j tured by the music and the intensely j
i interesting descriptions of Indian life." j
Lieurance has an unrivalled collec
| tion of primitive flutes which he dis-|
I plays at each concert.
