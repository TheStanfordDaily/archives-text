# U. C. S. B. GOLFERS TO FACE STANFORD TEAM NOVEMBER 14
## 
### 
Final arrangements for a varsity
golf match between the Southern
Branch of the University of California
and Stanford to take place the morn
ing of November 14 prior to the foot
ball game at Stanford have been com
pleted.
For the first time in its history
Stanford is playing a college team
other than the University of California
in this sport. Negotiations for the
match were brought about by Captain
Dick Lang of Stanford, and Captain
Aims Tuthill of the Southern Branch,
who met in Los Angeles and arranged
for play. Hereafter the match will be
a yearly event between the two uni
versities.
Rated as one of the most powerful
golf teams on the Pacific Coast, the
Southern Branch varsity presents for
midable opposition to the Stanford
golfers.
This week-end will see the Stanford
varsity playing the San Jose Golfing
Country Club. This match will merely
be a testing out of the players and
will, no doubt, influence to a great
extent the selection of the team that
will compete with Southern Branch.
However, Captain Lang, Meyberg,
Sayer, and Edmunds will probably fill
berths on the team. The other two
men will be decided as a result of
play.
At the present time Sayer and Ed
munds are tied for low score in the
University tournament, though none of
last year's varsity have turned in
scores and most of them will probably
be lower than the scores to date.
