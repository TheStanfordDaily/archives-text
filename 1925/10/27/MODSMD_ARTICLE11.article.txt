# ASSEMBLY, TICKET SITUATION PROBED AT MEN'S FORUM
## Dink Abolishment Question Is Discussed; Lapp Leads New Yells 
### 
Dinks, should they be worn or dis
carded? —Assemblies, should they be
discontinued? —Big Game tickets, who
should get them? These were the top
ics raised for discussion at the men's
forum assembly held at 9 o'clock this
morning.
Stanley Weigel told of the situation
in regard to University Assemblies.
Unless there is a larger and more
representative attendance at the five
assemblies held each quarter under
the auspices of the Committee on Pub
lic Exercises the gatherings will be
discontinued. At present only a small
percentage of the student body at
tends. The concensus £of opinion is
that, although the assd|nblies are de
sirable as means of bringing noted
speakers to the campus, they had bet
ter be done away with than to be ne
glected by the student body.
Robert Lewis, A. S. S. U. president,
opened the question of whether alumni
or students should get preference in
the distribution of tickets for the Big
Game. Lewis upheld the view that the
ticket requirements of the student
body should be taken care of before
those of the alumni. At present some
of the alumni are getting four Big
Game tickets while there are barely
enough for each student to get two
extra ones. Harry Noland spoke for the
alumni side.
Suggestion was made that a space
be reserved above the rooting section
so that men ushering at the game can
join in the yelling, though not the
bleacher stunts.
Charles Stratton brought up the
topic of "frosh dinks." He told of the
proposal to "request" dink-wearing
only until the Big Game rally each
year when the bonfire would be made
to burn more brightly with the dinks
as fuel. Jacob Irwin, head sponsor in
Encina, declared for the entire aboli
tion of the dink-wearing tradition as
being without value and entirely dis
regarded. A freshman asked that
something definite be decided in order
to remove Ihe uncertainty felt by most
members of '29 on the subject .
Burt Lapp led an "axe" and a "rail
road" yell with a few new variations.
