An open discussion of present-day
political problems in China was held
at the regular meeting of the Cosmo
politan Club last night in the Women's
Clubhouse.
The principle speaker of the evening
was Huang Sliih who gave a lengthy
survey of existing political, economic,
and diplomatic conditions from the
point of view of the Chinese student.
He expressed a feeling of "unprece
dented indignation on the part of the
Chinese people against the action of
Great Britain in the Shanghai tragedy
of May 30, and the Hongkong outrage
of June 10."
In his talk Shih discussed the na
tional movement in China which is
against extra-territorial occupation by
foreign powers, and for political auton

ent movement, according to the speak
er, is not anti-foreign, anti-Christian,
or Bolshevistic in its nature.

Japanese fencing, by Francis Hayashi
and Tadashi Kawaguclii; several violin
numbers by Katliryn Von Stein; an
