# SCHUBERT FEATURED IN ORGAN NUMBERS FOR COMING RECITAL
## 
### 
A complete organ sonata in four
; movements is one of the numbers to
; be played by Warren D. Allen in his
recital next Thursday afternoon at
! 4:15 o'clock. The selection is "D flat
Major Sonata, opus 54," by Joseph
Rheinberger, and consists of "Fan
tasie," "Pastorale," "Introduction," and
"Fugue" movements. In the Fugal sec
tion characteristic and famous forms
of organ music will be heard. The in
terweaving of many separate melodies
to form a harmonious whole brings out
the full dignity of the organ.
Following "Invocation," by Theodore
Salome, will be a number by one of
music's most appealing figures, Franz
Schubert, entitled "Litany," a com
memoration of the dead. This is based
j on the verse, "Rest in Peace All Souls
Departed." Schubert's ability in creat
ing melodies resulted in his works
being struck off as an inspiration of
| the moment.
A contemporary American composer,
Leo Sowerby, is represented by his
| work, "Chorale Prelude: Rejoice Ye
j Pure in Heart." Sowerby, from Chi
j cago, is one of the recipients of a
1 fellowship in the American Academy
in Rome. American musicians have
been awarded this coveted honor for
J the past three years.
