# EUPHRONIA DEBATE TEAM TRYOUTS TO BE HELD TOMORROW
## Society Will Meet Mills and College of Pacific in Forensic Contests 
### 
Tryouts for the Euphronia Debating
Society teams which will meet repre
sentatives from Mills College at Oak
land anil from the College of the
Pacific at Stockton will be held to
morrow evening at a meeting of
1 Euphronia at 7:30 o'clock in the base
ment of the Women's Clubhouse. The
i meeting and tryouts are open only to
j members of the society.
The question for debate which has
i been arranged by the Debate League,
of which the three opponents are mem
bers, is: "Resolved, That there should
: be faculty censorship of student pub
lications." The tryoutees for the Eu
| phronia team will give five-minute
! speeches on this subject, with three
! minute rebuttals.
Owing to the lack of any such need
| for faculty control at Stanford, an ef
! fort will be made by Euphronia to
j change the subject for debate, accord
ing to George N. Crocker, president of
the society. No arrangement as yet
has been made with either the College
i of the Pacific or Mills in regard to the
change.
The debate with the Mills team will
be held at Stanford December 2, Eu
hronia upholding the affirmative of the
question. The negative team will meet
the College of the Pacific debaters the
same date at Stockton.
An open meeting of Euphronia will
be held November 4 at which John L.
McNab, prominent San Francisco law
yer and orator, will address the audi
ence concerning the great number of
laws on the statute books and the use-
I lessness of the great majority of these
statutes. McNab recently addressed the
Bar Association on this topic, which
he will adapt for the Euphronia meet
ing in order to make it of interest to
' the audience. The meeting will be open
to Euphronia members, Stanford stu
dents, and to residents of Palo Alto.
