# APPROVAL OF POINT SYSTEM EVIDENCED BY MAJORITY VOTE
## Women at Assembly Favor Proposal; Nomination Method Changed 
### By-Laws Changed 
The point system for the regulation
of women's activities was carried by
a vote of 239 to 43 at the Women's
assembly this morning. This means
that the question will be brought up
again before the women in the Febru
ary election for a definite decision as
to its adoption. The main object of a
point system is to regulate the holding
of offices among the women and to
restrict the monopoly of offices by a
few. It will also prevent girls from
carrying more than their scholastic
standing and health permits, and it is
hoped that it will insure more efficient
handling of affairs.
Article 8, section 1, a reading that
Women's Conference shall hold its
meeting within the week after spring
election, at the call of the retiring
president of the Associated Women's
Students, was changed to read that
Women's Conference shall hold its
meeting as soon as possible after
spring election at the call of the re
tiring president. The change was ne
cessary because of the fact that the
president will, leave before college
closes.

Women's Conference was authorized
to recommend to Men's Council that a
by-law in the Constitution reading to
the effect that in student elections
men may nominate only men, and
women may nominate women be
amended so that men shall have the
power of nominating women and wo
men that of nominating men. It was
thought that the fact that women are
now endeavoring to take an active
part in student government justified
this action.
Dr. Moslier spoke on the necessity
of sleep and the right sort of food in
the college girl's life. She gave the
results of the statistics that were
taken last year among the women. The
main object, she said, was to make
the women think, for when the mod
ern women is started on the right
track the results are usually very de
sirable.

Fiesta Outlined
A request for manuscripts for the
fiesta was made by Jean Ward. She
urged that many be turned in so that
there may be some choice in order to
make the fiesta a success. All women
are urged to try out for parts. Miss
Ward asked for suggestions from all
women and particularly from trans
fers who have had experience at other
universities. Besides the various parts
in the fiesta itself, there will be mana
gerial positions for women on commit
tees such as finance, grounds, pro
grams, and tickets. There will be an
opportunity for every woman to par
ticipate in some phase of the affair,
and complete co-operation is asked.
The point system for the regulation
of women's activities was carried by
a vote of 239 to 43 at the Women's
assembly this morning. This means
that the question will be brought up
again before the women in the Febru
ary election for a definite decision as
to its adoption. The main object of a
point system is to regulate the holding
of offices among the women and to
restrict the monopoly of offices by a
few. It will also prevent girls from
carrying more than their scholastic
standing and health permits, and it is
hoped that it will insure more efficient
handling of affairs.
Article 8, section 1, a reading that
Women's Conference shall hold its
meeting within the week after spring
election, at the call of the retiring
president of the Associated Women's
Students, was changed to read that
Women's Conference shall hold its
meeting as soon as possible after
spring election at the call of the re
tiring president. The change was ne
cessary because of the fact that the
president will, leave before college
closes.

Women's Conference was authorized
to recommend to Men's Council that a
by-law in the Constitution reading to
the effect that in student elections
men may nominate only men, and
women may nominate women be
amended so that men shall have the
power of nominating women and wo
men that of nominating men. It was
thought that the fact that women are
now endeavoring to take an active
part in student government justified
this action.
Dr. Moslier spoke on the necessity
of sleep and the right sort of food in
the college girl's life. She gave the
results of the statistics that were
taken last year among the women. The
main object, she said, was to make
the women think, for when the mod
ern women is started on the right
track the results are usually very de
sirable.
