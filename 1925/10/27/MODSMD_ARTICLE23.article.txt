# "Hello"
## 
### 
Not so many years ago Stanford men took as naturally to saying
"Hello" to another at passing, as ducks take to water. Since the fresh
men have been living in Encina hall away from coercion and proper
instruction by zealous sophomores this venerable and very worth-while
tradition has fallen into rapid decay, chiefly because the first-year men
never got the habit while they were freshmen.
Yesterday a senior and a holdover, each holding a prominent campus
position, walked down the Quad as stragglers were leaving their one
o'clock classes. A good half of the passers gazed steadfastly in the
opposite direction to avoid being spoken to. Twenty-five per cent failed
to respond to the "Hello" of the upperclassmen, twenty per cent managed
to recover their surprised in time to stammer a muddled "How do you
do," and scarcely five per cent got off a good "Howdy gents" or "Hello."
Many of the present holdovers and not a few seniors have been soundly
paddled for failing to give a cheery "Hello." One has a hard time to
force a response from an underclassman, even after he has spoken first to
the youngster!
The wilfull and needless abandonment of one of the most valuable Stan
ford traditions is an example of the rapidly increasing tendency to spurn
everything that made the color of life red at Stanford in the olden days,
and by so doing endeared the Cardinal to every alumnus. Should things
continue as they now are Stanford graduates in 1935 will have little more
regard for their Alma Mater than most men have for their high schools.
