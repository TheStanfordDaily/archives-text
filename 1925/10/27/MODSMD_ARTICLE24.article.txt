# Recurrent Thievery
## 
### 
Yesterday brought forth another case of stealing on the campus, for a
cut-down automobile was taken from its parking place near the Quad,
l'etty thievery is a continual annoyance, but the theft of an automobile
involves grand larceny with greater loss to the owner and more serious
consequences to the thief. Undoubtedly the machine w r as removed by a
person who lives off the campus, but that fact does not prevent similar
cases occurring in the future unless proper precautions are taken by
owners.
Students must join in making it hard for dishonest persons to obtain
possession of automobiles and accessories. Leaving cars and extra tires
unlocked is an invitation for a robbery and when a theft follows the
heedless one has only himself to blame. The ordinary ignition locks are
not burglar-proof devices but they at least offer something of an obstacle.
Padlocks on spare tires should be essential. If these preventatives are
used the thief will at least think twice before making an attempt at larceny.
Students are too prone to trust the rest of humanity when they leave
spare tires and attractive accessories without any fastening whatsoever.
No one seems to care much whether the other fellow loses his goods or
not. To fight the growing evil, every Stanford man should remain alert
both in caring for his own personal effects and in observing suspicious
characters who loiter around the cars of others. And when a thief is
caught he should be severely punishedâ€”a night in jail or a suspended
sentence is not enough. If he realizes the law is going to be swift and
sure in its punishment he will be less eager to break its rules.
Some professors are sparks of learning, but many a spark falls on a tin roof.
