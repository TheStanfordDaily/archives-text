The Editor, Sir:
As we were saying when we were
so rudely interrupted by the U. S. C.
game, it is time that the funereal
notes with which we have intermit
tently buried California for the last de
cade took on some semblance of en
thusiasm. It looks as if Stanford was
taking the tombstone proposition too
seriously, and has joined the mourners'
bench. Why not remind her that it is
up to her to dry her tears and dance
at the funeral of her dear enemies.
But we can't expect her to dance for
ever to the dirge tempo which seems
In such vogue with us at present. How
about putting on a new record? If all
of our young composers are too busy
with exams to help us out before the
Big Game, there are a few old songs in
the annals of the University which
might be unearthed for that and simi
lar occasions (e.g., the old Cardinal
Fighting Song). It behooves us to come
forth with a large and powerful anti
date for the 57 varieties of song sport
ed by our friends across the Bay.
While we are in the mood we might
also throw in a few lyrics for the
amusement of the Discontented Cows
in the South. Also we must be careful
jiot to weary our neighbors with con
stant references to our older and more
venerable friend, the Bear. They might
get jealous.
Stanford songsters wake up! More
pep! Bigger and better songs! Let's
come join our deserted band which,

with its poor Cardinal waving feebly
at half-mast, is waiting patiently for a
j real cheer.
The Long and Short of It.

Well, I see by the papers that the
"Big Game" will be around soon and
I suppose the usual "smart cracks" are
blooming about the outcome.
I happen to be down here in the
sticks and have to sort of pry out any
news relating to the yearly upset in
dope, but something out of the ordi
! nary happened today—all about the
, "Big Game."
The police court of the city of
Fresno had just tried a case of assault.
The jury disagreed and, in order to
speed things, was dismissed. It became
necessary to have a new trial and the
; judge asked for suggestions from the
1 attorneys.
"Oh, any time at all," they chimed.
"Well, the case will come up the
| eighteenth of November."
A wild protest followed and after all
; was calmed down everyone agreed
! that that was too close to the 21st.
"Say," said the judge, "I haven't my
tickets yet. What's that? Oh, the case,
some time in December, boys. That
was nice the way Stanford doffed her
hat to the crippled horse down South,
what?"
From what I gather I guess all ac
tivity, including the crime wave, will
have to stop over that week-end. I
:suppose you would say you hope the
!only thing that stops is the Berkeley
I outfit. ... So would I.
