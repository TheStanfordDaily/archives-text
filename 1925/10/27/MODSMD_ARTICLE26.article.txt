## PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICE OF PRIMPING 
### Priscilla Pringle 
As we all so well know, beauty is
only skin deep, but even then a great
deal of beauty can be put outside the
skin. Rouge is one of woman's greatest
assets. Indeed, I have even heard it
said that the lip-stick is mightier than
the sword. Men are such unsuspecting
creatures, that rouge may be used in
great quantities before they doubt that
the color is natural. As an experiment
I have used an entire compact of rouge
on my face at once and the only result
was that all the men complimented me
on my fine color. The newest creation
in the use of lipsticks is a stencil pat
tern which comes in a variety of forms.
By use of these, different shaped lips
may be made for various occasions,
such as formal lips and informal lips.

In view of the popularity of the late
song hit, "Brown Eyes, Why Are You
Blue?" we dedicate to a certain fresh
man who told a varsity boxer where
to go, the charming ditty entitled,
"Blue Eyes, Why Are You Black?"

We wonder why freshmen are so
near-sighted that they have to take
binoculars to a football game.

BILLY BROGAN'S ETIQUETTE
COLUMN
Dear Billy:
How jolly should one be at a jolly
up? I have looked through the Fresh
man Handbook, but can't find anything
about affairs of this kind. —A Frosh.
Dear Frosh:
Your actions at a jolly-up should be
guided entirely by the music. When
the orchestra plays a waltz, you should
be less jolly than when it plays a
Charleston. —Billy.
Dear Billy:
When I am sitting on the floor of the
Pavilion at a football rally, I am per
plexed as to what to do with my feet.
They seem to be in everybody's way.
—Perplexed.
Dear Perplexed:
According to the latest rules of eti
quette to be observed at a football
rally, it is customary to wear your
Oxford Bags, so that when your feet
are stuck into the back of your fellow
rooter sitting in front of you they will
not cause any physical discomfort, but
will act as a cushion.
P. S. Oxford Bags should never be
worn except to rallies. —Billy.
