# DR. FRANK CALLS UNIVERSITY SYSTEM PILE OF WRECKAGE
## 
### 
In an attack on the educational
methods in American colleges delivered
in Chicago yesterday, Dr. Glenn Frank,
president of the University of Wiscon
sin and until recently editor of the Cen
tury Magazine, characterized the intel
lectual fabric of universities as "a pile
of wreckage."
Further continuing his denunciation
he declared that universities arc "mere
charnel houses in which creative edu
cation lies buried," and "intellectual de
partment stores," educationally "head
less," with presidents "little more than
business managers and deans little more
than probation officers."
Having but recently entered the edu
cation field, his impression of the pri
mary business of a university president
consisted "in turning himself into an
educational go-getter, a sort of educa
tional traveling salesman, who by
whoop-it-up tactics and the beating of
drums, weedles large donations out of
prosperous citizens," or into a "back
stairs diplomat who succeeds in getting
five new buildings a year out of the
state legislature."
Quoting M. Levisse, the distinguished
French educator, Frank said, "today a
fragment of a teacher teaches a frag
ment of a subject to a fragment of a
pupil."
In his closing statement, Frank de
clared, "It is still possible for a young
man by judicious selection of the easier
courses, to spend four years in our col
leges and universities and come out
relatively untouched by any real intel
lectual discipline and face the word with
no coherent notion of the modern world
in which he must live and make a liv
ing."
