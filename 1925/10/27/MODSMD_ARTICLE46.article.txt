The Freshman—Harold Lloyd
California Theater San Jose
Outside of its stupendous ability to
induce all forms of joy ranging from
smiles to hysteria and dementia "what
you-may-call-ems," Harold Lloyd's new
-omedy, "The Freshman" should be
seen by all college students simply be
cause it is a remarkably clear and vivid
picture of college life as it isn't. How
ever, it confrms to the popular idea of
college existence and is so hugely en
tertaining that it could be forgiven any
thing.
Lloyd takes the cake as the "gag"
artist supreme. One "gag" after an
other fills the picture; and most of them
are pretty plausible at that. Pathos
has its full share and is sandwiched in
between laughs at the proper times.
The Big Game scenes are all there,
although we failed to recognize our
selves in the bleachers. You may be
more fortunate however.
Harold is the boy who starts out for
college determined to be a "big man"
on the campus as well as a capable glad
hand artist. Instead he becomes the
official campus boob. But wait! The
football game of the season approaches
and—but you've guessed it. It was
close, but he put the ball over in the
last .000001 second of the play and the
audience goes home singing "Collegi
ate" and laughing reminiscently.
—H. A. K.
