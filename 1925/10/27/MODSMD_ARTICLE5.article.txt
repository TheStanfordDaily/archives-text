# FRESHMEN PREPARE FOR LAST CONTEST PRIOR TO U. C. GAME
## 
### Frank Baker 
Coach Husky Hunt this week will
put his freshman football squad
through some stiff workouts in an at
tempt to straighten out the fumbling
and weaknesses of last Saturday before
the final week of practice begins next
Monday. Modesto Junior College will
furnish the opposition Saturday in the
last and crucial test before the Little
Big Game, and is reputed to have a
strong aggregation. The Junior College
is certain to force the yearlings to
exert themselves in order to win. Last
Saturday the freshmen were still
carrying numerous marks of greenness,
but with two weeks of hard scrim
mage, and a tough game this week,
they should be able to iron out most
of these.
No excuse can be given for the fum
bles the freshmen made in the game
with U. S. C. except that they were
nervous on meeting a team which had
been given so much publicity. The
passing of Saturday's game was er
ratic and needs brushing up if it is
to be used successfully against the
California Cubs.
Ray Tandy was not on the field to
day and will probably not be in the
lineup next Saturday as he has a
twisted knee that will bear watching.
Husky does not want to give him any
chance to damage it so he will not be
in shape for the big contest, for
Tandy's strength will be greatly
needed. No other men were injured
in the game with the Trojans, so un
less someone is put out of commission
next Saturday, the team should go on
the field the 7th of November in good
condition. Doyle has been out of con
dition during the past two weeks, but
two weeks should put him in shape
again.
The work of some of the substitutes
in last week's game has placed him in
line to earn a letter this year. Some
second-team players have also been
changing off with the first string men
during the first practices of the week.
