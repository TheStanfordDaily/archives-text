# SPORTS OF 1925
## 1925 Football Captains 
### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Shown here, for your inspection, are three 1925 football captains from widely
separated parts of the country, Doug Wyckoff of Georgia Tech, Jim Foley of
Syracuse, and "Bub" Henderson of Chicago.
Wyckoff has been the outstanding back of the South for the past two years.
He plays fullback on the "Golden Tornado," and is a great kicker, a powerful
line-plunger, and a first-class defensive player. His work last year, when
Georgia Tech lost its first games to any Southern opponent since 1919, was
sufficient to tie the strong Florida eleven and beat Fenn State 15 to 13.
Atlanta is proud of Ty Cobb, Bobby Jones, Watts Gunn, Mrs. Alexa Stirling
Fraserâ€”and .Doug Wyckoff.
Jim Foley started off the current season auspiciously for Syracuse by catch
ing Hobart's opening kick-off and racing 95 yards to a touchdown, and later
making two 50-yard runs, one of which resulted in another score. Jim also
kicked two goals for points after touchdowns, and since Captain Foley is also
a good passer and defensive man you can see that the Orange team can well
use this versatile quarterback.
"Bub" Henderson, whose real name is Fred, was a great help in Chicago's
winning the Big Ten championship last year. He is a linesman who plays a
consistently hard game, and is especially good at breaking through on the
defense. Like the Nebraska, Penn., Pittsburgh, and Yale captains, Henderson
plays tackle, where a man's work is never very showy.
