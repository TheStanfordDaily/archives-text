# JOURNALISTS WILL DISCUSS PLANS FOR PRESS CONVENTION
## 
### 
Sigma Delta Chi, national profes
sional journalistic fraternity, will meet
in the Press building tomorrow night
at 7:30 o'clock to consider plans for
the third annual convention of the
California Scholastic Press Associa
tion, to be held here on Nov. 13 and 14.
The Federation was founded three
years ago by Sigma Delta Chi, and
each year has attracted nearly three
hundred high school journalists to the
Stanford campus. In past years, the
meeting was held during the spring
quarter, but in order to give the high
school editors a full school year in
which to put into effect the principles
learned at the convention, the time
was changed to the autumn quarter.
General chairmen in charge of the
convention have been appointed as
follows: Wallace W. Knox, chairman
of the Registration and Housing com
mittee; Norris E. James, chairman of
the Convention Program committee;
and John Levi, chairman of the Fi
nance and Awards committee.
The convention program as roughly
outlined to date is as follows:
Friday, Nov. 13 —
Registration of Delegates from 9 to
11 o'clock in the morning.
General session at 11 o'clock.
Round-table discussions from 1 to 4
o'clock.
Convention banquet at 7:30 o'clock
in the evening.
Dance from 9 to 12 o'clock.
Saturday, Nov. 14—
Round-table discussion from 8 to 10
in the morning.
General business session, 10 to 12
o'clock in the morning.
Adjournment at noon.
Prior to the convention, an Associa
tion Bulletin will be published and sent
to every high school in the state. The
Bulletin is being prepared under the
guidance of Professor Eeverett W.
Smith, of the Journalism Division.
