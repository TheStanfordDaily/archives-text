# DISAPPEARANCE OF FORD OWNER CAUSES ARREST OF FRIEND
## 
### 
The question of button, button,
who has the button, is finally being
propounded in real earnest by Cly
de Braun, who through the vagaries
of life is likely to be jailed for
grand larceny. Now he wants to
find Eli Dorsey, who was registered
last year at Stanford.
During the summer Dorsey asked
de Braun to drive his Ford from
Denver to San Francisco, where ar
rangements had been made for
them to meet. But Dorsey has not
showed up, and the other is being
held at Santa Monica by the police.
De Braun was arrested for not hav
ing a front license plate or a regis
tration card on the car. With Dor
sey absent, he may be sentenced
for grand larceny at his trial Octo
ber 30.
De Braun has made efforts to find
Dorsey but so far has not suc
ceeded. As a last chance he wrote
to Stanford to see if there was any
clue as to his whereabouts. Mem
bers of the Theta Delta Chi house
were unable to supply the informa
tion desired. De Braun's address is
now care of the Peer Apartments,
922 6th street, Los Angeles.
