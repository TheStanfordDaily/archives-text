# CAMPUS OPINION

The Editor, Sir:
I have been interested in reading
the numerous articles in the Daily Palo
Alto concerning the alleged snobbish
ness of Stanford women, but it strikes
me that, neither side having presented
a convincing case the controversy is
getting nowhere. So I say, "Let those
who hold against our friend from Har
vard go their way rejoicing, and let
those who hold with him comfort them
selves in the contemplation of the old
adage, 'There are as good fish in the
sea as ever were caught'."
Signed: '26.
