# DAILY PALO ALTO STAFF MOVES INTO NEW HEADQUARTERS
## Change of Name Is Proposed As Third Improvement In Publication 
### 
Commencing with today's issue, the
i Daily Palo Alto will be published from
: its new headquarters in the recently
! completed building in the Corporation
Yard.
Both the editorial and managerial
I staffs now occupy the new Press build
ing. This expansion follows the recent
| enlargement of the Daily into a seven
column paper and the enlargement of
i the Stanford University Press. The
latter will take over all of the old
Press building, with the exception of
the second story, which is now being
occupied by the editorial department
of the Quad.
A plan is under consideration which
will change the present name of the
publication to the Stanford Daily News.
The new name is said to be more
representative of the character of the
paper and will distinguish it from the
Palo Alto Times, which is not a stu
dent paper. As the present name is
I specified in the constitution,-a change
will necessitate action by the Execu
! tive Committee.
