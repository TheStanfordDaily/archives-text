# EUPHRONIA TEAMS WILL BE CHOSEN FOR TWO DEBATES
## Mills and College of Pacific Opponents; Tryouts Will Be Held Tonight 
### 
Teams to represent Euphronia De
bating Society in contests scheduled
with the College of the Pacific and
Mills College will be chosen at 7:30
o'clock this evening at the tryouts
which will be held in the basement of
the Women's Clubhouse. The question
for debate has been designated as:
j "Resolved, That there should be fac
ulty censorship of student publica
tions." Tryoutees will give five-minute
I speeches on this topic, supporting
either the affirmative or negative side
of the question. A three-minute rebut
tal for or against arguments advanced
will be allowed each speaker after the
constructive speeches have been de
| livered.
| Two regulars and an alternate will
ibe chosen for the debate with Mills
j College which will be held at Stanford
December 2. The Mills team will sup
port the negative of the question,
which has been arranged by the debate
league of which Euphronia is a mem
ber. Efforts will be made by Euphronia
to change the topic for debate to a
! subject of more interest to the Stan
| ford campus, as the question of fac
| ulty censorship of student publica
i tions is not considered especially ap
plicable to conditions at the Univer
-1 sity.
A second team will debate the Col
| lege of the Pacific at Stockton on the
same evening. Euphronia will defend
j the negative side of the question.
John L. McNab, who is considered
one of the foremost lawyers and ora
! tors of California, will address a meet
i ing of the society November 4, which
will be open to the public. No meet
ing will be arranged the following
week, as the Stanford debate with
the University of California will be
held November 10.
