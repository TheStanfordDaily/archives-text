# ELIZABETH E. STALL ADDED TO CAST OF "GOOSE HANGS HIGH"
## Majority of Roles Will Be Taken by Newcomers in Campus Dramatics 
### Isabel Schanck 
With the announcement of the
| choice of Elizabeth E. Stall for the
part of Rhoda, the cast is complete
j for "The Goose Hangs High," Sword
; and Sandals play to be produced No
vember G. The role contains an oppor
j tunify for a bit of good characteriza
! tion for Miss Stall, who is a newcomer
| to Stanford dramatics.
"The Goose Hangs High" is an ex
j cellent choice for presentation by a
| college group, as it is the study of the
j outlook of college people â€¢ and their
| family, and contains the problem of
the relations of the younger generation
with their parents. The play is in no
sense a moral treatise. Rather it is a
vital dramatic play, and the younger
generation element is only one com
ponent in an interesting and absorbing
situation.
All the characters in "The Goose
Hangs High" are very modern. The
1 scene is laid in an American city, and
the time of the play is Christmas vaca-
I tion, with the twins home from col
| lege. Leonard Schwartz and Velma
i Randall play the parts of Bradley and
Lois Ingalls.
Most of the other roles in the play
: are being taken by new talent which
was brought out by the well-managed
I system of tryouts. The new actors in
clude Robert Carr, Julia North, Charles
E. Smith, Carolyn Grossman, Eleanor
Davidson, Tom Darlington, R. J. Clen
dening, Wilbert Hammond, and Jose
; phine Pigott. Jacob Irwin, who was in
"Dear Brutus," presented last Friday,
has been selected for the role of
! Elliott Kimberley.
