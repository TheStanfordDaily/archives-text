# Football's Popularity
## 
### 
Baseball lias been called "The Great American game," but football's
popularity has increased by such leaps and bounds in the last few years
that the correctness of that statement can be challenged. With the pos
sible exception of the professional soccer clashes in England, no other
game attracts such immense crowds as football.
The Yale Bowl, one of the first of the large stadiums, will soon be
surpassed by many other college gridirons. Pennsylvania and Pittsburgh
are laying plans for stadiums with a capacity of 100,000. Several Big Ten
universities are erecting enormous fields to afford seating room for the
ever increasing hordes of football enthusiasts.
Yale will probably fill its Bowl three times this year, and will turn
away as many people as secure admittance. California and Stanford can
not begin to satisfy the demand for pasteboards for the annual Big Game.
It is estimated that 95,000 people saw the Cards and Bears fight to a
20 to 20 tie in the California Memorial Stadium last year.
Baseball's record attendance falls far short of this mark. The world
series of 1923, which attracted the largest crowds in the history of base
ball, did not gather more than 65,000 persons at a single game. A dozen
major football contests during the year beat this record. At no game in
the past series did Pittsburgh and Washington play before more than
48,000 fans.
And on top of this comes the announcement that the big leagues have
decided to condense their schedules so that it will be possible to complete
the world series before the football season gets under way. A plain admis
sion that football has superceded the diamond sport in the eyes of the
public.
