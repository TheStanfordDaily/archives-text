# Knowing How to Study

In today's Campus Opinion department a Stanford alumnus has written
suggesting that students acquaint themselves with the methods of study
ing outlined in a recent book entitled "How to Study." He further sug
gests that a course dealing with that subject be given by the University.
It is very true that much can be accomplished by grasping the right
methods of study, but in actual practice little can be done by telling a
man how to study. If he is serious-minded he can study and accomplish
a great deal without being told how to do it. If he is listless and care
free, no one can make him study, because he doesn't want to. Therefore,
such a course would not help the ones who want to study, because they
can learn the best methods adapted to their particular purposes without
daily lectures to that effect; and the course could not help the ones that
are not studying, because they don't want to learn.
Concentration is the key word to successful work at college. Every
one realizes it without having some professor pound it into his head. To
concentrate means to lose out on many of the "bull sessions" and card
games so common where groups of men are together. In the average
case of the poor student the temptation is too great —he would sooner
play another "rubber" than go upstairs and work. Low grades follow,
merely because the student prefers momentary pleasure to hard, gruelling
work. Would it help to tell him how to study when he could do this easily
if he only would? We think not.
