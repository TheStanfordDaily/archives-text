"We understand that Wilbur Adams, sports editor of the Daily Palo
Alto, doesn't know much about the Beavers. He writes, 'The next on
the Cardinal program will be a game with the Oregon Aggies of Cor
vallisâ€”a team of doubtful ability.' Wilbur had better be on hand at the
game this afternoon," says the O. A. C. Daily Barometer on October 24.
And the Daily Palo Alto might add that its sporting editor saw the
game and, without question, confirmed his statement. A 26 to 10 victory
will speak for itself.

"Disgusted '27," who refers to herself as a "beautiful Stanford co-ed" in an
anonymous contribution to the Editor, may have her letter printed in the
Campus Opinion department of the Daily if she will forward her name. There
lias been such a flood of these unsigned letters pouring into the Daliy office
that it. again becomes necessary to remind prospective contributors that it is
absolutely essential that the Editor have the name of the author before he
prints the communication. This is a safeguard for the paper should trouble
ensue, and it also enables the editors to determine that the views expressed
are coming from persons actually connected with the University. If desired,
only the initials or a pen name will be printed.

The high cost of inheritance in California keeps a great amount of outside
capital from investing in this state, according to a statement made by the
California Taxation Improvement Association. One prospective resident esti
mated that it would cost him $180,000 more to die in California than in
practically any other state. It is easy to see that the Golden State will lose
out to the Florida boom when many wealthy people start to look for a place
in which to die.
