The Editor, Sir:
The persistent "ad" of the American
Student Publishers that has challenged
ray attention so many times aroused
my interest sufficiently to result in
the purchase of a copy of William
Allan Brooks' "How to Study."
A careful perusal of this book shows
how very important it is for the stu
dent body in our universities to grasp
the importance of right methods of
study.
As most of us look back over our
courses in school and college, we can
not recall any effort being made to
teach us how to study. -We had work
to do and we went at it as best we
could. A few knew how to put their
mind on it, but how most of us wasted
time and effort at it!
And yet, as we have gone along, how
valuable we have found out it is to
know how to concentrate, how to apply
ourselves. And it is at college only
that we get this opportunity of learn
ing how to concentrate, how to apply
ourselves—how to study.
All of which brings me to this con
clusion: that there is a need, a very
urgent need, for a new course at Palo
Alto—a course on "How to Study," to
be given to all students, because a
knowledge of how to study is funda
mental, in fact, underlying all courses.
In the absence of such a course in our
curriculum I would recommend to all
students this very practical guide and
handbook, "How to Study," by William
Allan Brooks. It only costs $1 and can
be had by writing to the American
Student Publishers, 22 West Forty-
Third street, New York City.
