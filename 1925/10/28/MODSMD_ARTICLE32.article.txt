# CAMPUS OPINION

### 
The Editor, Sir:
The reprint of the editorial from a
Northwestern daily, with the apparent |
idea of approval by yourself, indicates ]
that there is a kind of anti-feminine
complex existing on the campus; not
.only because of the present editorial,
but because of the whole series of dis- j
cussions (we hope now dead and
buried), during the last week.
It is the purpose of the writer to \
remark with respect to the editorial
in question, that there have as yet j
sbeen no sounder reasons advanced for
smoking on the part of the male popu
lation than on the part of the women.
Furthermore, if one should investigate,
it would probably appear that the same .
form of "imbecility" and smoking ■
to be "smart" was as prevalent among 1
men as among women.
Perhaps fifty per cent of the young!
men who are now smoking on the
campus, smoked their first cigarette I
after they left home, or else they are
now indulging themselves to the full
est extent of a habit only covertly en- j
joyed while at home. I contend that j
the editorial is correct in assuming j
that smoking is an art to be enjoyed ,
only occasionally, that it is over-in- j
dulged, and merely a pose. But I think;
that the restraint should be placed'
both on men and women.
A woman has the right to smoke in
self-defense, if for no other reason.
With a majority of men and "mere
children" enjoying a habit which with
over-indulgence is positively filthy, a i
woman has only one barrier to erect
against it, and that is to indulge her
self. Perhaps "then the effect will be
the same as when both people eat
garlic, rather than the effect achieved
when only one enjoys this relish.
It is not pleasant to see women suc
cumbing to the odious cigarette, but I
in fairness to them, even if they are j
perfectly capable of defending them
selves, a little fairmindedness in such
matters would be very becoming to j
the man who drives the woman to!
