# INDIAN SONGS ARE PLEASINGLY SUNG BY MRS. LIEURANCE
## Compositions From Redmen Make Program One of Novel Appeal 
### Herbert Klein 
Last night's recital by Thurlow
Lieurance and Edna Wooley Lieur
ance was decidedly "something differ
ent" in the musical line and was appre
ciatively received. Mrs. Lieurance's
lively and eminently pleasing voice
was the outstanding feature of the
program, and was well adapted to In
dian and nature songs because of its
clarity, iiexibility, and great lyric
beauty.
Her enunciation could hardly have
been improved upon; each word was
as clear as if it had been spoken. Ex
cepting ou the higher notes there was
no forcing or effort in her singing,
and at no time was there any affecta
tion or lack of naturalness in her sing
ing or stage presence. There was, how
ever, a certain lack of spontaneity and
freshness in the rendering of some of
the songs and gestures, due probably
to having sung them again and again.
Songs Explained
The element of information, in the
form of Mr. Lieurance's explanations
and illustrations of the songs and of
Indian music in general, was not so
prominent as to detract from the
artistic effect of the music, and served
to make it more interesting by giving
each song a certain individuality and
special interest. The flute obligato. as
played by Lillian Reed.was very well
done, for it was subdued and supple
mented the voice, when needed, with
out competing with it.
The program began with a group of
characteristic numbers, songs more or
less in the spirit of the Indians, al
though not taken from their melodies.
The first true Indian music was a
Chippewa mourning song, "By Weep
ing Waters." Throughout the concert
Mrs. Lieurance wore authentic Indian
costumes, with a new one for each
group of songs which fit the tribal
origin and meaning of the music.
A ven\ entitled "Autumn," by the
late Professor William Herbert Car
ruth of Stanford, as set to music by
Lieurance, was sung. The song was
short and the music was worthy of the
beautiful words.
Lieurance Plays Flutes
Several native flutes from Lieur
ance's unique collection of over thirty
were exhibited and played by him, in
cluding a large alto flute which mod
ern instrument-makers have only re
cently been able to perfect for orches
tral use. An important feature of the
Indian flute, the only musical instru
ment possessed by the redmen, was
the fact that it had a whole tone scale
without the half steps which are found
in the major scales in which practi
cally all our music is written, except
ing that of Debussy and other "mod
erns" who have gone back to the older
form because of the possibilities of
its vague and almost unearthly tonal
effect.
It seemed as though many of the
Indian songs lost a large of their
primitive quality and haunting appeal
when adapted and altered by Mr.
Lieurance to become practically bal
lads of the semi-popular type. The dis
tinctive "wild" flavor was lost, as many
of them were translated into the musi
cal dialect of the modern white man.
