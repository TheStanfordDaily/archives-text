# TRACK PROSPECTS BRIGHTER AS WORK QUITS GRID SPORT
## Star High Jumper Will Not Risk Injury Impairing Ability on Track 
### 
Stanford track prospects took a de
cided rise yesterday, in the opinion
of fans, when Tom Work, Pacific Coast
intercollegiate high jump champion,
turned in his football suit and an
nounced his intention of confining him
self to track work for the year.
Work surprised track enthusiasts
this fall by appearing on the varsity
field Sept. 15 as a candidate for half
back berth on the squad, but lack of
experience was expected to keep him
from a regular position. Work is fast
and is a good punter. He showed up
well in scrimmage, but due to the
present abundance of experienced
halves on the Card squad, he has not
seen service in any games.
Work was slightly injured several
times in scrimmages this fall, and as
his right knee seemed to be particu
larly susceptible to tfie. grid knocks,
it was feared that his jumping ability
might be impaired. He persisted in his
football work, however, in spite of
protests of many track men. He re
ceived a bad twist to his already
knee in a scrimmage late last week,
and was forced to retire from the
scrimmage. Tom was unable to don a
football suit for several days after this
injury, and finally decided to give up
the grid sport for this year.
It is expected that the Stanford star
will equal his high jump records of
last season this spring, and he should
be one of the leading intercollegiate
high-jumpers of the country. -Last sea
son Work won the Pacific Coast Con
ference high jump event with a leap
of 6 feet, 5 and 7-20 inches. Earlier in
the season he had jumped 6 feet 3
inches, and won the California meet
at G feet 1 and 7-8 inches. With Fred
Mulis, of last year's varsity, and Bob
King of the '28 frosh team, both on
deck this season, Stanford should be
unusually strong in the high jump.
