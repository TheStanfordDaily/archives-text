# NOVEMBER "CHAPPIE" FILLED WITH WEALTH OF NOVEL ART WORK
## 
### 
When the November issue of Chap
arral appears on sale next Monday
morning, the campus will be treated
to one of the cleverest and most at
tractive covers that has ever adorned
a college magazine. "Turtle Neckers,"
as it is called, depicts a college woman
and a cwmpanion caught in a rather
intimate though none the less appeal
ing pose, portrayed in the vivid style
that has always made Mendelowitz's
sketches so greatly in demand for
Chappie. This cover is ore of the few
that has ever been printed in four
colors for Chaparral.
The issue, although smaller than
usual, makes up for its deficiency in
size by its abundance of art material.
Van King, Tommy Breeze, and Joyce
Thompson have lent their skill to a
number of clever sketches, and Bicker
ton has contributed an unusual full
page one for the art issue.
Mike Ely has written a short article.
A second contribution, "A Campus
Catalogue," offers in amusing and in
structive fashion, advice to poor, de
serving students on how to best get
through college. Another short article
deals most effectually with the per
plexing problem of improving bleacher
stunts.
Work has already commenced on
copy for the Big Game number which
the Old Boy plans to make the crown
ing issue of the year. Freshmen are
especially urged to turn in material
relating to the Big Game or football
in general, although other material
will be given grateful consideration.
The deadline for copy will be an
nounced later.
