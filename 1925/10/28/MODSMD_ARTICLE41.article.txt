### 
Thirty tryoutees reported at the
opening meeting of candidates for the
editorial and business staffs of the
Stanford Literary Magazine, which
will be published December 15. The
meeting was under the direction of
Kenneth V. Beer, circulation manager
of the new publication, Lowell Mat
thay, Everett R. Smith, and Arthur G.
Duncombe.
The tryoutees have been sent out
to solicit subscriptions. Each candi
date has been allotted a portion of
the campus in which to obtain sub
scriptions, for which credit will be
awarded in the tryouts. Candidates
must report the results of their day's
work each day to Beer, who will be
in the Quad office in the Administra
tion building between 2 and 4 o'clock
in the afternoon.
Subscription for the seven issues of
the magazine which will be published
during the current year will be one
dollar. No public sale of subscriptions
for the magazine will be held on the
Quad. Single copies will cost twenty
cents, and they may be purchased by
application to the circulation depart
ment.
A meeting of tryoutees will be held
Monday at 8:15 o'clock. At that time
rating of the candidates for staff posi
tions will be made on the basis of
work done during the past week. Only
those in the upper division of the try
outee rating will be allowed the privi
lege of soliciting in Palo Alto.
