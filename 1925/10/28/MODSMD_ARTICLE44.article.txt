# GRAYS NEED TRAINING BEFORE CLASH WITH CALIFORNIA RESERVES
## 
### 
With Van Hook and McCreery back
ing up the line, the Grays made a great
showing against the varsity last night
in practice. The reserves were on the
defense during the whole fray, but were
successful in breaking up numerous
plays. Symonds, at guard, broke through
the line time after time, and promises to
be one of the mainstays in the game with
California's Reserves.
The team as a whole showed more
co-operation than they have evidenced
thus far, probably due to the fact that
they have been playing together more
regularly during the past week. Hal
Davis has had a hard time keeping his
men together long enough to have a
real practice. He has two complete
teams of experienced and able players,
but 110 amount of experience will make
a winning team if they are not on the
field and playing in co-ordination with
each other.
Last Saturday, when the Santa Clara
Reserves canceled the game they had
scheduled for that date, the Grays were
given quite a setback, and now it is not
certain that the game they have sched
uled for this Saturday will take place.
The men need the game badly, for they
have only this Saturday in which to test
the men and get ready for the game with
California November 7.
