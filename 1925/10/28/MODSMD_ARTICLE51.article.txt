# TWO TEAMS DEFAULT ON SECOND DAY OF HANDBALL TOURNEY
## 
### 
The second day's play in the University
intramural handball tournament resulted
in two easy victories and two forfeits.
Alpha Delta Phi scored a decisive win
over 'I heta Xi, and Delta Kappa Epsilon
defeated Theta Chi in an equally easy
manner. Following the precedent es
tablished in the first day of competition,
two teams defaulted, giving Phi Gamma
Delta a place in the second round by
reason of Theta Delta Chi's forfeit, and
Alpha Kappa Lambda a similar place by
Phi Sigma Kappa's failure to appear.
The Alpha Delt combination, Thomp
son and Sparling, displayed a decidedly
superior brand of handball to defeat
their Theta Xi opponents without the loss
of one set. First singles ended 21—6,
21—9; second singles were 21—3, 21—3.
and the doubles match resulted in two
21—2 sets.
The Deke handball team encountered
little difficulty in disposing of the Theta
Chi players, and also took the match
with a victory in every set. The first
singles went to the Dekes by a 21—5,
21—5 count, second singles ended in a
21—6 verdict, and the doubles set cinched
the match with a 21—9 score.
Four good matches are scheduled for
tomorrow afternoon's play. El Cuadro
will oppose Phi Delta Theta on courts
one and two at 4:15. Phi Kappa Psi
and Delta Chi are slated to appear on
courts three and four at 4:15.
Courts one and two will be occupied
by Delta Upsilon and Sigma Chi at 5
o'clock, while El Tigre and Delta Tan
Delta will meet on courts three and four
at 5 o'clock.
