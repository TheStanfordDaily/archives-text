NOTE: This is the first of a series of
articles on the campus committee
problem. The Daily Palo Alto will

societies were not truly representative,
in that so few of the members actually
attended meetings of the bodies.

and the meetings should be held in the
latter part of the week, according to
the recommendation. It was found that
more members would be able to attend
if the meetings were not all piled up
at the first of the week. Although a
duplication of organizations often oc-
