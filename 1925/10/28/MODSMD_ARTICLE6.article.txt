Too much duplication of personnel
committees and too many organiza- j
tions similar to one another is the
decision of the body formed last fall
for the sole purpose of discovering
what evils, if any, exist in the present;
methods of handling committees and
organizations on the campus. Frede
rick S. Ludeke was chairman of the
■"Campus Organization Committee" and
was assisted by K. A. Wright, Mary
Conway, Elizabeth Simmons, and
Hartley W. Devlin. A formal report
was handed by them to the Executive
Committee last spring.
This investigation was the direct,
outcome of a suggestion by Dean Mary
Yost that the Executive Committee
look into the matter, for she was of |
the opinion that some students were

getting too much work, and that oth
ers, who were just as able and would
like some of the work, were being left
out entirely. She also stated that 3he
believed that some of the honorary
societies were not truly representative,
in that so few of the members actually
attended meetings of the bodies.
Attendance Small
The report of the committee showa
that only approximately fifty per cent
of the members attend the usual or
ganization meetings. They suggested
that an organization is a "give and
take" proposition, and if it did neither
there was no longer need for it to
exist. A definite constructive program
should be adopted for each meeting,
and the meetings should be held in the
latter part of the week, according to
the recommendation. It was found that
more members would be able to attend
if the meetings were not all piled up
at the first of the week. Although a
duplication of organizations often oc-
curs, they found that when a particu
lar body ceases to be of any value
whatsoever it is likely to discontinue
of its own accord.
In selecting members of honorary
societies, students are too often asked
to serve on a number of committees.
Such students are overworked, and a
great many times are not chosen be
cause they have any particular ability
along the line needed on a certain
committee, but because they have been
active in something else, such as ath
letics or dramatics, or were on com
mittees in their first year. The report
stated that it is often forgotten that
the students of Stanford are a picked
group and have shown ability and
qualities of leadership or they would
not be here, so that many are being
overlooked when they could do the
work successfully, and others are
being loaded too heavily.
Deans Can Assist
The committee suggested means by
which the above evils could be par
tially eliminated. The people who pick
members of committees and organiza
tions should go to the Dean of Men
and the Dean of Women before mak
ing their final choices. These two in
dividuals are better able to give ad
vice and assistance than any on the
campus, for they come into closer and
more intimate contact with the stu
dents. The report also suggested that
the President of the A. S. S. U. call
a meeting of the heads of all campus
organizations and have a round-table
discussion on the questions of commit
tee selections. The committee felt that
if such a group went on record as
being in favor of exercising more care
in choosing committees it would be a
step, at least, in the right direction.
This meeting has not been called yet,
so no further definite action has been
taken.

decision of the body formed last fall
for the sole purpose of discovering
what evils, if any, exist in the present;
methods of handling committees and
organizations on the campus. Frede
rick S. Ludeke was chairman of the
■"Campus Organization Committee" and
was assisted by K. A. Wright, Mary
Conway, Elizabeth Simmons, and
Hartley W. Devlin. A formal report
was handed by them to the Executive
Committee last spring.
This investigation was the direct,
outcome of a suggestion by Dean Mary
Yost that the Executive Committee
look into the matter, for she was of |
the opinion that some students were

getting too much work, and that oth
ers, who were just as able and would
like some of the work, were being left
out entirely. She also stated that 3he
believed that some of the honorary
societies were not truly representative,
in that so few of the members actually
attended meetings of the bodies.
Attendance Small
The report of the committee showa
that only approximately fifty per cent
of the members attend the usual or
ganization meetings. They suggested
that an organization is a "give and
take" proposition, and if it did neither
there was no longer need for it to
exist. A definite constructive program
should be adopted for each meeting,
and the meetings should be held in the
latter part of the week, according to
the recommendation. It was found that
more members would be able to attend
if the meetings were not all piled up
at the first of the week. Although a
duplication of organizations often oc-
curs, they found that when a particu
lar body ceases to be of any value
whatsoever it is likely to discontinue
of its own accord.
In selecting members of honorary
societies, students are too often asked
to serve on a number of committees.
Such students are overworked, and a
great many times are not chosen be
cause they have any particular ability
along the line needed on a certain
committee, but because they have been
active in something else, such as ath
letics or dramatics, or were on com
mittees in their first year. The report
stated that it is often forgotten that
the students of Stanford are a picked
group and have shown ability and
qualities of leadership or they would
not be here, so that many are being
overlooked when they could do the
work successfully, and others are
being loaded too heavily.
Deans Can Assist
The committee suggested means by
which the above evils could be par
tially eliminated. The people who pick
members of committees and organiza
tions should go to the Dean of Men
and the Dean of Women before mak
ing their final choices. These two in
dividuals are better able to give ad
vice and assistance than any on the
campus, for they come into closer and
more intimate contact with the stu
dents. The report also suggested that
the President of the A. S. S. U. call
a meeting of the heads of all campus
organizations and have a round-table
discussion on the questions of commit
tee selections. The committee felt that
if such a group went on record as
being in favor of exercising more care
in choosing committees it would be a
step, at least, in the right direction.
This meeting has not been called yet,
so no further definite action has been
taken.
