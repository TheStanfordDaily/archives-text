# CARDINAL VARSITY DEFEATED STRONG ELEVEN IN O.A.C.
## Stanford Reserves Exhibit Power in Game Against Oregon Aggies 
### Wilbur Adams 
Stanford beat one of the strongest
football teams on the Pacific Coast last
Saturday. The Oregon Agricultural
College displayed an offensive attack
against the Cards that should bring
; victories to the Aggies when they meet
Montana, Oregon, and Idaho in their
j next three conference battles. O. A. C.is
[ is not out of the running for the con-
I ference championship yet, for both
; Stanford and California may bump into
trouble in the form of the University
| of Washington. But the contest that
will decide O. A. C.'s chances does not
j come until December 5 in Los An
| geles. Both LT. S. C. and O. A. C. have
: powerful offensive elevens, but are
j relatively weak on the defense.
Last Saturday's game in the Stan
! ford stadium revealed certain encour
| aging facts about Pop Warner's var
| sity. Four out of the seven linemen
1 that started the Aggies game were sub-
I stitutes, and three out of the four back
! field men were members of the second
; team| With these second-string playera
i Stanford beat the fighting Aggies. Or,
| in other words, Stanford has a strong
reserve. The second bright spot in
| last week's game was the varied at
| tack that Stanford displayed. Solomon
I called forward passes, end runs, bucks,
I and criss-crosses, and they all worked.
; The best judge of football could not
! figure out what was coming next.
The absence of fumbles, for the
first time this season, was another fact
that sent the Stanford supporters
| away from the game with smiles on
| their faces. Ernie Nevers proved him
| self a triple-threat man, by kicking,
i passing, and bucking the Oregon team
1 to defeat. Nevers was given All-Ameri
can mention last season because of his
playing in one game. Nevers has played
in every contest for the Cards this
year, and none of the five opposing
elevens have been able to hold him.
Even against the Olympic Club line,
the Stanford captain was able to make
yards consistently. If the West re
ceives the credit that it deserves this
year, Stanford will have the All-Ameri
can fullback.
A weak right end caused the Cardi
nal coaching staff the greatest worry
during the first month of practice this
year. This hole has been stopped up
by Ed Walker, who was shifted from
the backfield for the purpose. Last
Saturday Walker was running inter
ference for the halfbacks as if he had
played end all his life. His defensive
work showed marked improvement
and, besides, he caught his share of
forward passes.
The defensive playing of McCreery
at center was one of tjie features of
the game. His passing was slightly
better than in previous contest, but
still can be improved. Solomon played
a heady game at quarterback through
out the entire ocntest. Mitchell is
again able to practice, despite the fact
that his injury has not completely
healed. Solomon is still running the
first eleven in practice this week.
