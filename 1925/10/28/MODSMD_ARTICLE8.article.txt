# FOUR COLLEGIATE MATCHES FOR CARD BOXERS PROBABLE
## 
### 
Prospects of four big intercollegiate
boxing matches in the spring are add
ing enthusiasm to the efforts of the
; thirty-five aspiring pugilists who are
i working out regularly twice a week in
; Encina gym under Jake Irwin and
: Vance Martin, two former Stanford
boxing captains.
Stanford will have a wealth of var
| sity material by the beginning of the
! season to compete with the veterans
I of last season. The fact that there will
jbe at least one old member of the
team in every weight class will make
competition for positions on the squad
very keen.
The letter men, though not yet in
strenuous training, are going through
light workouts in preparation for the
j elimination contests of the University
j championship which will be held to
. pick the members of the regular var
; sity. Among the members of the last
| year's squad to return are Captain
j Schall, Collins, Myron, Hall, Simmons,
Parsons, Ross, Keerl, and Sullivan,
i Stanford will definitely meet Davis
j Farm and S. 13. U. C. in the spring, and
' there is a strong possibility of matches
J with University of Southern California
; and California, if relations with the
! latter university in this sport can be
; patched up.
All men of pugilistic tendencies are
! urged to come out for this fall's pre
; season practice.
