# STANFORD VARSITY GIVEN EDGE OVER OREGONIAN SQUAD
## Lemon-Yellow Squad Light; Passes, Place-Kicks Are Scoring Threats 
### Wilbur Adams 
Oregon University comes to Palo
| Alto this weak-end, figured as a sure
1 loser in Saturday's game with Stan
ford. Those who remember how Ore
j gon came back last season after losing
all their previous contests &nd beat
Washington, one of the strongest
elevens on the coast, are not so sure
of an easy victory over the Lemon-
Yellow.
The most ardent Northern supporter
will admit that the showing of the
Oregon team this year has been rather
weak. The season was started with a
| scoreless tie with the Multnomah Ath
! letic Club of Portland. Next, Idaho
; traveled to Eugene and handed the
home town eleven a 6 to 0 trimming.
On the following Saturday Oregon
| managed to win their first and only
match of the 1925 season from Pacific
College, but the score was only 13 to 0:.
j Last week-end the Bears beat Oregon
i in Portland by a 28 to 0 score.
Oregon has a team composed of ten
veterans. The whole line played to
! gether last year, and the backfield,
i with the exception of Wetzel, are all
■ men of at least one year's experience.
Stanford has an advantage over Ore
gon in weight, for the Beaver's line
! averages only 177 pounds to a man.
The heaviest player on the Oregon
team weighs in at 185 pounds, while
the center and right guard carry 165
pounds each. This weakness in the
center of the line should make the
going easy for Nevers on Saturday.
The Oregon backfield averages 178
pounds.
Vic Wetzel does all of the punting
| from left halfback. Blewett of Cali
; fornia outkicked the Oregon man last
| week, but Wetzel was noticeably off
form. It was his first important con
-1 test and nervousness kept him from
! performing at his best. Fred Harrison
