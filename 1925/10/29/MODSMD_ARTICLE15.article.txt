# TELEPHONE COMPANY ENLARGES EQUIPMENT
## 
### 
i Extensive additions and changes to
the telephone system are now being
| completed by the Pacific Telephone
! and Telegraph Company.
More than five miles of underground
| cable, and the installation of standard
two-position multfple testing equip
ment are the main parts of the exten
sion. The multiple testing equipment
replaces the wire chief's testboard be
cause of the heavy and rapid increase
! of local service demands.
A considerable proportion of the
underground work is being done in
! conjunction with other street-opening
projects so that it will not be neces
sary to open streets after the paving
program is completed. The cables are
being laid along the highway, Bryant
! street, and University avenue from
i Cowper street to Middlefield Road.
