# ORCHESTRA HOLDS FIRST REHEARSAL
## Helen Engel Atkinson Directs Opening Practice of Local Musicians 
### 
The first rehearsal of the newly-or
ganized Stanford orchestra, composed
entirely of students, and numbering
about fifty pieces, was held last eve
ning at 7:80 in the English building.
Helen Engel Atkinson, a member of
the first violin section of the San Fran
cisco Symphony Orchestra, is the di
: rector. Regular rehearsals will be held
i every Wednesday evening at 7:30.
To build up an orchestra which will
i play at dramatic productions, assist
the Glee Club and oratorio choruses,
and give several campus concerts dur
ing the year is the aim of the organiza
j tion. Most large eastern institutions
I have such orchestras, and the Univer
j sity of California has a very good one.
Practice was begun last night on
the "Surprise Symphony" of Haydn.
Training will be given orchestra mem
bers in actual conducting as well as
j rhythm, sight reading, and interpreta
i tion of scores. College credit will prob
ably be given.
A full complement of instruments
including eight cellos, three harps, fif
teen violins, two oboes, three clarinets,
one trumpet, two French horns, two
| flutes, several trombones, and tympani
and drums will make the orchestra
' complete in every respect.
Plans are being made to give a cam
pus concert early in December to raise
| money for the purchase of a musical
library.
