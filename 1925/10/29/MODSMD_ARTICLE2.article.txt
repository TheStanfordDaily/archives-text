# "INTERNATIONAL LAW IS FOR PEACE" PROFESSOR STUART
## 
### 
"The international law of the future
is to be devoted to the laws of peace
almost entirely, and not so concerned
with those of war," declared Professor
Graham H. Stuart, of the Political
Science department, at the meeting of
the League of Nations Non-Partisan
Association held in the Little Theatre
last night. "Recent textbooks on inter
national law present problems of
peace in three-fourths of their pages."
"Representatives of forty-four na
tions which met in April at the Traffic
in Arras Conference agreed not to use
poison gas or vermin inoculated with
disease germs in future warfare. The
humanizing of methods of warfare is
useless because when one belligerent
breaks the law the other has to retali
ate."
Professor Stuart presented a sum
mary of what the League of Nations
has accomplished during the past year
and discussed the report of the sixth
assembly of the League held in Sep
tember. He pointed out that the
League of Nations is now becoming
more and more concerned with prob
lems of administration and social and
economic welfare.
