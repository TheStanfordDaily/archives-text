# FRESHMEN START BUILDING BEAR CREMATION BONFIRE
## Aim of Class Is to Erect Strong Pyre Rather Than High One 
### 
Actual construction on the bonfire
I tor the Big Game Rally started yester
day afternoon when over twenty-five
freshmen reported on "location," near
the site of the old library. By nightfall
I the foundation trenches were well
, under way, and a considerable amount
, of wood had been collected. One hun
! dred men were at work this afternoon.
The freshmen have decided to make
! every effort to build the framework
strong enough so that it will remain
upright for some time instead of col
lapsing in' a few minutes. If necessary,
some of the height will be sacrificed
to secure structural strength.
Donald D. Flickinger was elected
head of the committee at a meeting of
the freshmen Monday night. A tem
porary organization has been formed
by Flickinger to direct construction
and to provide means for conveying
material to the field.
Poles Bought
Five thirty-five-foot redwood tele
phone poles have been purchased, and
these, together with twenty eucalyptus
trees, will form the basis for the struc
ture, which will be approximately
seventy feet high and thirty-five feet
square at the base. The poles, one at
each corner and one in the center, will
be sunk to a depth of six feet. The
eucalyptus trees will be spliced to
the tops, giving the framework the
necessary supports. Cross-bars will
hold the bonfire firmly together.
Crossing at the center of the struc
ture, two trenches filled with tray 3
of gasoline protected by packing boxes,
will form-the air entrance for the flue,
and will ignite the central part of the
fire. The flue will be built by imbedding
eight eucalyptus trees in a circle about
the central pole, forming an open drop
the height of the structure.
Railroad Ties Used
Four hundred railroad ties given the
freshryien by the Southern Pacific and
i Peninsular railroads will be the means
! of keeping the structure from collaps
| ing. These ties will be arranged in
| criss-cross fashion at the base of the
fire. Above these will be thrown in
! material collected from the campus
| and Palo Alto. Cross-beams of euca
lyptus trees and poles will reinforce
the structure.
Professor C. B. Wing, A. B. Youens,
a Palo Alto electrical engineer, and
James Sapero, who directed the con-1
struction last year, have been aiding
in planning the structure.
The Sequoia Club coffin will be the |
crowning unit of the fire. The coffin
in which California is burned will be j
carried to its resting place in a funeral
"wake" at the completion of the pyre.
Fifteen hours' work on the fire will
be required from all freshmen with ;
the exception of members of the foot
ball team. The bonfire will be guarded
day and night for the week preceding
the Rally, at which time the structure
is turned over to the sophomore class.

ture, which will be approximately
seventy feet high and thirty-five feet
square at the base. The poles, one at
each corner and one in the center, will
be sunk to a depth of six feet. The
eucalyptus trees will be spliced to
the tops, giving the framework the
necessary supports. Cross-bars will
hold the bonfire firmly together.
Crossing at the center of the struc
ture, two trenches filled with tray 3
of gasoline protected by packing boxes,
will form-the air entrance for the flue,
and will ignite the central part of the
fire. The flue will be built by imbedding
eight eucalyptus trees in a circle about
the central pole, forming an open drop
the height of the structure.
Railroad Ties Used
Four hundred railroad ties given the
freshryien by the Southern Pacific and
i Peninsular railroads will be the means
! of keeping the structure from collaps
| ing. These ties will be arranged in
| criss-cross fashion at the base of the
fire. Above these will be thrown in
! material collected from the campus
| and Palo Alto. Cross-beams of euca
lyptus trees and poles will reinforce
the structure.
Professor C. B. Wing, A. B. Youens,
a Palo Alto electrical engineer, and
James Sapero, who directed the con-1
struction last year, have been aiding
in planning the structure.
The Sequoia Club coffin will be the |
crowning unit of the fire. The coffin
in which California is burned will be j
carried to its resting place in a funeral
"wake" at the completion of the pyre.
Fifteen hours' work on the fire will
be required from all freshmen with ;
the exception of members of the foot
ball team. The bonfire will be guarded
day and night for the week preceding
the Rally, at which time the structure
is turned over to the sophomore class.
Actual construction on the bonfire
I tor the Big Game Rally started yester
day afternoon when over twenty-five
freshmen reported on "location," near
the site of the old library. By nightfall
I the foundation trenches were well
, under way, and a considerable amount
, of wood had been collected. One hun
! dred men were at work this afternoon.
The freshmen have decided to make
! every effort to build the framework
strong enough so that it will remain
upright for some time instead of col
lapsing in' a few minutes. If necessary,
some of the height will be sacrificed
to secure structural strength.
Donald D. Flickinger was elected
head of the committee at a meeting of
the freshmen Monday night. A tem
porary organization has been formed
by Flickinger to direct construction
and to provide means for conveying
material to the field.
Poles Bought
Five thirty-five-foot redwood tele
phone poles have been purchased, and
these, together with twenty eucalyptus
trees, will form the basis for the struc
ture, which will be approximately
seventy feet high and thirty-five feet
square at the base. The poles, one at
each corner and one in the center, will
be sunk to a depth of six feet. The
eucalyptus trees will be spliced to
