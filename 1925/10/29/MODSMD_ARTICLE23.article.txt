# The 						Decadence of Traditions
## 
### 
That college life is robbed of half its fun when freshmen receive no
discipline or coercion for failure to uphold traditions was the statement
made by a freshman at the Men's assembly Tuesday. The Daily Palc
Alto heartily agrees with this first-year man's conception of college and
urges that a committee be appointed to outline a system whereby worth
while traditions can be continued in a uniform and satisfactory manner.
A few of the oldest and most popular universities are still able to maintain
them and there is no reason why it cannot be done at Stanford.
Napoleon, realizing human weaknesses, founded the Legion of Honor
to award his supporters. Materially the Legion of Honor meant nothing,
but it did a great deal to form a closer union and preserve a single purpose
at a critical time in the French Empire. Traditions at a large university
accomplish the same end. Freshmen who must wear Dinks may hate
it at the time, but it unites them as a class, and makes them into a much
stronger organization when they become sophomores, borbidding women
and freshmen the use of the Law steps makes upperclassmen feel more
elated because thy can loiter there. An all-night poster fight provides a
gruelling evening's work, but after it is all over the participants will find
themselves happy in friendships they made on such an eventful night.
And a multitude of honored and respected traditions, such as Stanford
has, taken together as a wliole, will form a school spirit which cannot be
excelled anywhere. Stanford has an enviable reputation which has arisen
largely because of its distinctive type of student body and college life.
This reputation is going to dwindle if all of the customs and traditions
that developed it are allowed to perish.
