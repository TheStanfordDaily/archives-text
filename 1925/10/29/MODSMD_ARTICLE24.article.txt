# Rooterless Rallies
## 
### 
Two weeks ago a rally was*held in the pavilion and it was quite well
attended. The committee in charge gave considerable publicity to the
entertainment which was to be provided. Judging from the turnout at a
second pavilion gathering last night, for which a minimum of acts were
promised, it must have been the prospect of being amused which brought
out the rooters the first time, rather than the honest desire to improve the
working of the rooting section. Roughly, only about 800 students had
"fire" enough to discard whatever else they might be doing and come to
the pavilion.
The Stanford varsity is "going great guns," but the rooting section is
a disgrace. The past few years a spirited rooting section has been cheering
on a mediocre team but this year the tables are turned.
There is scarcely an alumnus who would not give a few years of his
life to l>e given the opportunity of cheering on a victorious football team.
Imagine the feelings of this graduate group who have pleaded for a
Stanford win since the adoption of American football, if on the day of
the Big Game the rooting section of the winning college is disorganized,
the yells are given half-heartedly, the songs are sung out of pitch.
Just as the varsity needs practice so does the rooting section. The Rally
Committee has done its level best to provide rehearsals, yet on the days
of the games only a handful of men wear rooters caps, and on the
evenings of rallys fully 70 per cent of the student body passes up the
gathering for a bridge game or a "bull session."

Lectures, according to Bertraml Russell, are a survival from the Middle
Ages due to the fact that universities have not yet adapted themselves to
the invention of printing. For the best students, he says, lectures are a
nuisance. Professors should have discretion in this matter and be able to
exempt certain of their students, if satisfied that they are not wasting time.

Members of the Daily Palo Alto staff will meet in the Daily office at 1:30
o'clock tomorrow afternoon. Members who cannot attend must present a
â– valid excuse before the meeting.
