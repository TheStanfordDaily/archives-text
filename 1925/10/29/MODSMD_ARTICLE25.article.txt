The Editor, Sir:
There was an editorial in the Daily
Palo Alto of October 27 about the
"Hello" tradition of Stanford in which
the underclassmen were upbraided for
their neglectful attitude toward this
custom.
When I came to Stanford this fall
I was at a loss to know what course
to take in the matter of greeting the
fellows on the campus. I wanted to
exchange greetings with everyone, but
did not know how my attitude might
be taken, especially with the upper
classmen, and I want to tell you that
I was mightily pleased when I learned
at the first frosh assembly that I was
expected to say it first whenever and
wherever I met a Stanford man.
I can truthfully say that no Stanford
man has ever failed to get a hearty
response from me since that day, but
I have sent out a number of greetings
which have called back no reply, and
especially from men wearing cords.
I do not wish to insinuate that I do
not have the greatest respect for the

upperclassmen. I think they are the
finest bunch of fellows I have ever
met, and at times when I have been
passed up by them I have wondered if
it were not because their minds were
occupied by some other thoughts, and
not that they were intended to ignore
the greeting. But this attitude of a
few has not made a bit of difference
to me in regard to what I consider one
of the finest customs of Stanford, and
one which I shall continue to uphold
with pride.
I do not wish to contradict anyone,
but merely want to say that among my
acquaintances in Encina the "Hello"
custom is looked upon with pride and
is exercised with genuine pleasure by
most of them.—A Frosh.
