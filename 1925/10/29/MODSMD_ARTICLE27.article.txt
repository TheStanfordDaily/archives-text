LIMPING LIMERICKS
A gentleman hailing from Cork
Was endeavoring to eat with a fork.
Said this comrade, "My life,
'Tain't safe—use a knife;
'Tis the logical weapon, O'Rorke."
A fire-eating fellow named Jay
Met up with a high-powered ray.
The ray, by reflection,
Caused him great dejection;
His lining showed up, clear as day!
* * *
Oxford students are fined $5.00 if
caught attending a dance. They don't
call it "fined" in America, but it means
the same thing except that different
ones get the $5.00. —L. A. B.

After trying in vain to obtain an
extra "Big Game" ticket, we were in a
position to appreciate the following re
mark:
Flat —"Why did you send one son to
California and the other to Stanford?"
Feet —"To increase my chances of
getting a ticket to the Big Game."

Encina freshmen are finding "Ox
ford Bags" tricky to manipulate in a
high wind without the use of petti

One freshman spends all of his spare

THE QUEENER'S DICTIONARY
Date —a delicious fruit which grows
close together in pairs. Dangerous if
partaken of too generously. A heavy
date is one which is likely to fall.
Cactus Garden —this is really a date
garden where the fruit flourishes only
mild weather.
Car —this is also known as the
queeners' delight. The larger and
brighter it is, the more queens appear
(or disappear) in it.
Keen woman—this term, queerly
enough, does not mean a sharp woman,
but one who is acquainted with a cer
tain very powerful vegetable, yet also
has the je ne sais quoi mentioned in
all sophisticated novels.
Morning after —this is what makes
the queener swear off at least once a
week. Its effect rarely lasts more than
a day. —F. E. H.

Members of the "Frozen Five Hun
dred" have been recently complaining
about the stubbly faces of unkempt
college men. If a two-day beard worries
them, what in the world would they do
if those styles should return wherein
we measure a man's manliness in
linear "I. O. B." (inches of beard)?
* * *
We are pleased to prove by the fol
lowing notice that there were dumb
bells at Stanford in 1902 as well as
today: "Dumbell drill commenced to
day at the Gym."
HOCKEY TEAM PRACTICES
The senior hockey team will play a
practice game with the freshman wo
men tomorrow afternoon at 4:15
o'clock on the Roble field. This is the
second of the practice games in which
all the class teams will probably meet
before competition for the champion
ship starts.

Members of the "Frozen Five Hun

about the stubbly faces of unkempt

HOCKEY TEAM PRACTICES
The senior hockey team will play a
practice game with the freshman wo
men tomorrow afternoon at 4:15

before competition for the champion

A gentleman hailing from Cork
Was endeavoring to eat with a fork.
Said this comrade, "My life,
'Tain't safe—use a knife;
'Tis the logical weapon, O'Rorke."
A fire-eating fellow named Jay
Met up with a high-powered ray.
The ray, by reflection,
Caused him great dejection;
His lining showed up, clear as day!

partaken of too generously. A heavy

queeners' delight. The larger and
brighter it is, the more queens appear
