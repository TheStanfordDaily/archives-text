# CAMPUS OPINION
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
In the editorial concerning the,
"Hello" tradition appearing recently in |
the Daily it was stated that since the;
freshmen have lived exclusively in j
Encina hall, this tradition has been!
neglected. Perhaps Such a condition
has come about during this time, but |
I challenge anyone to prove that the
freshmen are responsible for this situ
ation.
If you will make a trip through the i
different groups on the campus, you}
will find that more fellows will say i
"Hello" in Encina than in any other
hall. Moreover, in walking up the Row,
fewer fellows speak to one than any
other place on the campus.
The freshman naturally says "Hello" j
to the upperclassmen for the first few
weeks, but after he beholds the look
of surprise and sometimes the patron
izing smile he receives, he learns to
wait for the man in cords to speak
first. —R. F. M„ '29.
