Walter Laufer, national backstroke
champion, lowered a world swimming
record in an indoor exhibition in
Cleveland, Ohio. Laufer swam the 200
meter backstroke in 2:42, lowering by
3-5 second the previous record, held by
Stubby Kruger of Chicago. He also
established a new record for the 220-
yard backstroke, making it in 2:43.
These are said to be the lowest records
in either outdoor or indoor tanks.
