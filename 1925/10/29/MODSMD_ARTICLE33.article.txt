# CARD FILE RECORDS WOMEN'S ACTIVITIES
## 
### 
A card system to keep a record of
the high school and college activities
of all women entering Stanford as
l'reshmen is being introduced this
quarter on the recommendation of Wo
men's Council and Conference.
The system was introduced so that
this information would be in a con
venient form, and easily accessible for
committee heads and other women in
a position to want it. On this card will
be placed each woman's name, age,
class, and record of high school and
college activities. The list of high
school activities will be taken from the
record sent to the university at the
time of her application for admittance.
Her college record will be made up as
she enters each activity.
The cards will be kept by the head
sponsor, Margaret Dietrich, at Roble,
and will be used by the other sponsors
in helping to place the freshmen in
activities. This file will also be valu
able in recommending women after
they have finished college, as well as
in appointing committees while they
are here.
