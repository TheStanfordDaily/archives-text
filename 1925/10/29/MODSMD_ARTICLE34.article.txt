# BOX FOR CRITICISMS IN DEAN'S OFFICE
## 
### 
A box for criticisms and suggestions
about any women's activity has been
installed in the Dean of Women's of
fice. This box will first be used in
connection with the point system,
though any other ideas may be sent in.
Any woman may suggest what phase
of the point system she would like to
have investigated, and the committee
will consider these suggestions in their
work. The committee will be chosen
soon by Women's Council.
Suggestions for organizations will
be turned over to the organization
heads so that the most capable person
will consider the criticism. Each wo
man is urged to use this box for any
ideas she has that will be of interest
to the women of the University.
Suggestions are urgently wanted for
the work of the health committee
which was recommended at the Wo
men's Assembly last Tuesday. This
committee will be appointed immedi
ately.
