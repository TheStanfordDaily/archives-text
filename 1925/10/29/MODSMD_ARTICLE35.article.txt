The Editor, Sir:
If the Revolution of 1776 had been in }
any way dependent upon the spirit j
Ihat was displayed by the students I
who did NOT turn out for the Rally
last night, we would still be a Royal
Province of the British Empire. Such
a display of school spirit is absolutely
disgraceful to any student body, but
much more so to that of Stanford,
where the students have the reputa->
tion of supporting their team to a man.!
The only encouraging fact brought, j
out by the Rally last night was thatj
there are at least eight or nine hun- j
dred students who are still filled with 1
Ihe spirit of the Stanford Red, and who
do not consider it too much trouble to \
devote a half hour of their time to the I
furthering and bettering of our songs
and yells.
If things have come to the place
where it takes a first-class vaudeville j
act, a taxi to and from the pavilion. I
and a cozy Morris chair while at the |
rally, to drag men out of their places
of hiding or away from their games of
bridge, then the condition here at Stan
ford is disgustingly pathetic and re
grettable.
If our team displayed the same j
spirit that our rooters do when there
is a little sacrifice for, them to make,
just how far do you suppose we would
get as Conference Champions or as
Victors in the Big Game?
Red-blooded Stanford men, I ask
YOU, what are we coming to?
