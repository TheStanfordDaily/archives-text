# SMALL NUMBER OF ROOTERS TURN OUT AT PRACTICE RALLY
## Doc Moreno's Stringed Trio And Band Contribute To Entertainment 
### 
A rally was held in the pavilion last
night for the purpose of practicing the
Stanford songs and yells. Burt Lapp
gave special attention to the yelling
of the "Ax" and "Railroad." Though
the Rally Committee arranged an en
tertaining program, only a small num
ber of rooters attended the rally.
Bob White, chairman of the Rally
Committee, gave a short talk, stress
ing the point that rooters' hats should
be worn at all football games. Bleacher
stunt practice is necessary before the
Big Game, so students must co-operate
by wearing rooters' hats at the Ore
gon and Southern Branch games.
Musical selections were offered by
Doc Moreno's stringed trio and Milton
M. Hartman on the ukulele. To add
to the evening's entertainment, the
band played a number of pieces.
Students will be given the oppor
tunity to watch the football team in
action today at the varsity secret
practice field. An Informal rally will
be held on the field from 4 to 5 o'clock.
If this proves a success the Rally
Committee will arrange to have the
rooters see practice every Thursday.
