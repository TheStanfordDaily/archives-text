# COMET COMES
## 
### 
Brooks' comet, one of the seven
periodic visitors to the earth that have
been expected this year, the discovery
of which was reported by an astrono
mer at Kiev, Russia, has not been
located at the U. S. Naval Observa
tory. On several clear nights a large
telescope has been used to search for
it.
