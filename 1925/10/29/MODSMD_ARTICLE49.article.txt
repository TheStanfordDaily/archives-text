### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Last year I happened to loe in Los Angeles at the time of the opening of the
football season, and ambled out to the Coliseum to see the Southern California
j eleven exercise at the expense of Cal. Tech. During the fourth quarter, a play
| happened that may well be described as "One for the books." Once in a
great while the ball may travel 140 or 150 yards in one play, as in the case
of a touchdown made from the kick-off, but in this instance the ball went a
total distance of 21 yards further than twice the length of the field.
Green's strategy, on observing that his opponents were asleep, was quite
alright, especially as he made sure that the referee had not blown his whistle
before he set out for the Cal. Tech. goal line. But it was highly amusing to
see him drop the ball when tackled only two yards short of his destination
after carrying: it further than any of the longest runs on record. And then,
as an anti-climax, came the Cal. Tech man's 43-yard dash toward the
j U. S. C. goal.
In 1923 a freak happening occurred in the Detroit-Hope College game, when
Hope had the ball for 1G consecutive downs, yet fell back 40 yards. The
answer is that on three separate occasions Hope kicked on the fourth down
only to have the kick blocked and a Hope player recover the ball.
