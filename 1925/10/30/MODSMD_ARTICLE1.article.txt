# P.A.A. TITLES AT STAKE IN ENCINA POOL COMPETITION
## Olympic Club Now Holds One Point Lead Over Card Swimming Squad. 
### 
With a full list of entrants in each race,
three P.A.A. senior championship swim
ming events will be staged tomorrow
afternoon in Encina pool at 1 o'clock.
The meet will be over in time for the start
of the football game. Swimmers from
the Olympic Club, Idora Park, San Jose,
Stockton, and the San Francisco Elks'
Club will compete with the Stanford pad
dlers for points and medals in the district
championship events. Making up the pro
gram are the pentathlon, with its five
races, 500-yard free style and 220-yard
breast stroke.
Cardinal swimmers will be entered in
every event and aim to collect the lion's
share of the points in order to pass the
Olympic Club in the race for winner of
the year's P.A.A. team championship.
With the score now standing at Olympic
Club 22, Stanford 21, both teams will be
out to get a substantial lead in this meet
and in the final one to be held at the'
Athens Club in Oakland, November C.
Four swimmers will represent the
■"Winged O" squad. Three of them, War
ren Littlefield, Eric Kraemer, and Ed Sul
livan, will compete in the breast stroke
race. Stanford's hope in this event is
Arden Allen, varsity swimmer and cap
tain of the water polo team. Allen will
k at a disadvantage in this race for he
has been swimming breast stroke for only
-a few months and has two of the fastest
of the coast's sailor-style swimmers to
meet in Littlefield and Kraemer. Kraemer
is a former Stanford star.
The 500-yard free style event should be
a classic of its kind with Carl Stevenson
•of the varsity meeting such comers as
Frank Mooney of the Olympic Club and
Joe Aleck of the San Francisco Elks'
Club. Stevenson is the favorite but who
ever does win will have to make excellent
time over the fifteen-lap course. Other en
trants in the 500 are: Leonard Willis, San
Jose, and William Egan, Elks' Club, and
Norman Barrow. This race will undoubt
edly furnish some of the biggest thrills
of the meet.
For a good afternoon's workout there is
nothing to compare with the pentathlon
with its four races and a diving competi
tion. Contestants in the pentathlon swim
in all of the following races: 100-yard
breast stroke, back stroke and free style
and 500-yard free style. A diving compe
tition with two compulsory and three vol
untary dives is also included in this all
around test of ability in the water.

Stockton, and the San Francisco Elks'
Club will compete with the Stanford pad
dlers for points and medals in the district
championship events. Making up the pro
gram are the pentathlon, with its five
races, 500-yard free style and 220-yard
breast stroke.
Cardinal swimmers will be entered in
every event and aim to collect the lion's
share of the points in order to pass the
Olympic Club in the race for winner of
the year's P.A.A. team championship.
With the score now standing at Olympic
Club 22, Stanford 21, both teams will be
out to get a substantial lead in this meet
and in the final one to be held at the'
Athens Club in Oakland, November C.
Four swimmers will represent the
■"Winged O" squad. Three of them, War
ren Littlefield, Eric Kraemer, and Ed Sul
livan, will compete in the breast stroke
race. Stanford's hope in this event is
Arden Allen, varsity swimmer and cap
tain of the water polo team. Allen will
k at a disadvantage in this race for he
has been swimming breast stroke for only
-a few months and has two of the fastest
of the coast's sailor-style swimmers to
meet in Littlefield and Kraemer. Kraemer
is a former Stanford star.
The 500-yard free style event should be
a classic of its kind with Carl Stevenson
•of the varsity meeting such comers as
Frank Mooney of the Olympic Club and
Joe Aleck of the San Francisco Elks'
Club. Stevenson is the favorite but who
ever does win will have to make excellent
time over the fifteen-lap course. Other en
trants in the 500 are: Leonard Willis, San
Jose, and William Egan, Elks' Club, and
Norman Barrow. This race will undoubt
edly furnish some of the biggest thrills
of the meet.
For a good afternoon's workout there is
nothing to compare with the pentathlon
with its four races and a diving competi
tion. Contestants in the pentathlon swim
in all of the following races: 100-yard
breast stroke, back stroke and free style
and 500-yard free style. A diving compe
tition with two compulsory and three vol
untary dives is also included in this all
around test of ability in the water.
With a full list of entrants in each race,
three P.A.A. senior championship swim
ming events will be staged tomorrow
afternoon in Encina pool at 1 o'clock.
The meet will be over in time for the start
of the football game. Swimmers from
the Olympic Club, Idora Park, San Jose,
Stockton, and the San Francisco Elks'
Club will compete with the Stanford pad
