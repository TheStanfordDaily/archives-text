# WATER BARRAGE OF ENCINA MEN LIFTED BY IRATE SPONSOR
## 
### 
Water barrages are no more in
Encina hall after the sleeping form
of one sponsor had been doused
with two bags of water flying
through the open window. Adding
injury to insult the same freshmen
followed the first bomb with a sec
ond whichwwass s equally well-aimed.
Until the present corps of spon
sors are no more, the hapless frosh
who lets loose a deluge from some
fourth-story window in the near fu
ture will likely find himself con
demned to eternal janitorship at
the Convalescent Home.
Had it not been for this unfor
tunate mistake, the change in cus
tom and ancient usage whereby
water ammunition has been aban
doned for apple cores, would not
have been made. However, apple
cores can be thrown farther than
water and can hit more difficult
targets.
