# LITERARY MAGAZINE SECURES TOTAL OF 300 SUBSCRIPTIONS
## Thirty-Four Tryoutees Are Canvassing Campus For Readers 
### 
Of the 700 subscription quota, set
for the new Stanford Literary Maga
zine by Kenneth Beer, circulation man
ager, 300 had been secured at 3 o'clock
Thursday afternoon. Beer requests
that all those subscribing to the maga
zine get their subscriptions in before
Monday since he wishes to fill the
quota without a general Quad sale.
Thirty-four managerial tryoutees are
soliciting subscriptions at the frater
nity and sorority houses, the halls, and
the department corners on the Quad.
The advertising program will begin
Monday under the direction of Cecil
True, former advertising manager of
the Daily Palo Alto. The advertising
will be limited to seven pages in the
first issue of the magazine.
Beer wishes all the tryoutees who
are selling subscriptions to see him
between 2 and 3 o'clock Monday after
noon in the Quad Manager's office in
the Administration building.
