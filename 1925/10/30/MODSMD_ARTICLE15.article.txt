# TOYON CLUB PLANS MYSTERY INFORMAL
## 
### 
Friday, November 13, spells bad luck
not only for Southern Branch the next
day, but for those who miss the Toyon
Informal that night. Horner's Fairmont j
Hotel orchestra will furnish the music;
the dance committee promises some
thing entirely new â€”and hence secret.
Tickets will go on sale Monday to
members of Toyon Club and will be j
limited to ninety. Robert Fraser, mana
ger of the club, has charge of the sale.
If all the tickets are not sold within
a reasonable time, they will be avail-,
able to former Toyon men. Any left;
after this will be sold to the students j
at large.
Harold S. Armstrong, who managed
two successful dances at Toyon this
summer, is chairman of the dance com
mittee. One dance will be a football
specialty number, but the others are
being kept a dark secret.
