### 
Tickets for the Anna Case concert
which will be given in the Stanford
Assembly hall Thursday, November 5,

under the auspices of the Peninsular
Musical Society and is the first of the

for this year. Prices for the concert
in which Miss Case, internationally
known concert soprano, will appear,
will be $1.65 and $1.10. Season tickets

Miss Case has risen to a position
among the leading concert sopranos in
America. Born of American parents
and educated in this country, she soon
secured a position with the Metropoli
tan Opera Company of New York
through the natural beauties of her
voice. Approaching musical maturity,
she left the operatic field to satisfy
the country-wide demands for her ser
vices in concert. Miss Case has sung
in every state of the Union, Berlin,
London, Hamburg, and Amsterdam.
She will appear next in the Orient.
