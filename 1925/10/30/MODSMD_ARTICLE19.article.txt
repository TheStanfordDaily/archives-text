# S. J. T. C. INJURIES CAUSE POSTPONING OF RESERVE GAME
## 
### 
Gloom again surrounded the Stanford
Grays' football team when the San Jose
Tcachcrs' College called of? the game they
had scheduled for tomorrow morning at
10 o'clock. Too many injuries in the
squad was given as the reason for cancel
ling the game. An attempt is being made
by Frank Frye, football manager, to line
up a game with some other team in order
to give the men a workout before their
game with California Reserves next Sat
urday.
This is the second contest the Grays
have had forfeited to tliem in two weeks;
last week it was Santa Clara who can
celled the game. Outside of half a game
( with California Polytechnic, of San Louis
Obispo, the second squad men have had
no outside games at all this year, and there
were only about half of the men here for
that game, most of them having gone
down to the Varsity-U.S.C. game in Los
Angeles.
On the other hand, California's Reserves
have been playing a game every week and
getting in sliape for the contest with the
Grays.
