# SENIORS, FRESHMEN FAVORED IN SECOND ROUND GRID GAMES
## 
### 
The second games of the interclass
football scries will be playfed Saturday
morning at 9:30 o'clock on the practice
field when the seniors tangle with the
sophomores and the freshmen take on the
juniors.
Coach Cuddeback's fourth-year men arc
slight favorites over the second-year ag
gregation. The loss of several seniors,
including Mannoccir, who is afflicted with
poison oak, will be felt materially. Since
overwhelming the juniors last week the
seniors seem to have slumped; they did
not look too well in their scrimmage with
the juniors Monday night.
In contrast with the seniors, the sopho
more squad is greatly by new
additions, among whom are "Red" Moore
and Ross Nichols, who are showing up
well in the backfield. Nichols is one of
the fastest men out for the team. Cap
tain Harter, at quarter, and Orton and
Painter should give a good account of
themselves Saturday.
Harry Shipkey's freshmen .after their
victory last Saturday are quite confident
of defeating the juniors by an impressive
score. They play well on defense and
have a varied attack. They bucked and
passed at will in scrimmage with the
sophomores Wednesday, making three
touchdowns through passes alone. Steb
bins at right half and Ophuls at end bore
the burden of the attack.
The juniors have started going at last.
Coach Rill Neil 1 now has enough men for
a complete team to work with and several
substitutes besides. They are working
hard in an effort to keep in the running.
Sandwick at quarter has been calling sig
nals like a veteran.
