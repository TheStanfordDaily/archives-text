# CARDS PITTED AGAINST OREGON IN THIRD CONFERENCE GAME
## Stanford Doped to Win But Northerners Have Good Passing Attack 
### Wilbur Adams 
Stanford enters her third conference
game tomorrow afternoon in the sta
dium as a favorite over the Oregon
University. The Webfooters have lost
to Idaho and California this year, but
the Oregon squad arrived this after
noon in an optimistic frame of mind
over the battle tomorrow. Their cry is
'Victory," and not "Hold 'em Oregon,"
as in previous years.
Pop Warner predicts a close battle
tomorrow, and to prevent Oregon from
catching Stanford off her guard, he
will start the strongest men on his
eleven. The same team that started
the U. S. C. CAintest two weeks ago will
again be in the starting lineup when
I he whistle blows at 3 o'clock. Against
0. A. C. last Saturday, Warner used
his second team, and it was the sub
stitutes that conquered the Aggies. But
the Stanford mentor is taking no
chances against Oregon University to
morrow. The recollection of the two
touchdowns that Oregon scoreAi against
Stanford last year are still fresh in
the minds of the coaches.
Regulars to Start
Although the first team is starting
tomorrow, a two-touchdown lead for
the Cards will probably be the signal
for the substitutes to be sent into the
game. An injury of one of the first
string players tomorrow would seri
ously hurt Stanfoi-d hopes of defeating
Washington next Saturday, and no
chances will be taken. In every other
contest this year, the second-string
men have been able to run up as largo
a score as the first eleven players, so
substitutions will not hurt the Cards.
Pacific Coast football fans will be
watching Stanford against Oregon to
see whether the Redshirts can better
the 28 to 0 score made by California
last week-end at Portland.
Mitchell Back
Muggs Mitchell will be seen at quar
terback tomorrow for the first time
since he was taken from the game in
Los Angeles with a wrenched knee.
The return of Mitchell strengthens the
Cardinal team although Solomon
seems to have acquired the knack of
calling the right play at the right time.
Having Solomon on the bench makes
him a valuable substitute for both
quarterback or fullback if either
Mitchell or Nevers are injured.

Muggs Mitchell will be seen at quar
terback tomorrow for the first time
since he was taken from the game in
Los Angeles with a wrenched knee.
The return of Mitchell strengthens the
Cardinal team although Solomon
seems to have acquired the knack of
calling the right play at the right time.
Having Solomon on the bench makes
him a valuable substitute for both
quarterback or fullback if either
Mitchell or Nevers are injured.
