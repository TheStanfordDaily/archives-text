# SOCCER MEN PLAY VIKINGS TOMORROW IN LEAGUE CONTEST
## 
### 
With one victory already credited to
them this week, the varsity soccer
team meets the Vikings tomorrow aft
ernoon at 2:30 o'clock on the Jefferson
high school field, Daly City, in the
fifth game of the University and Club
League series.
California defeated the Vikings
earlier in the season by a 3 to 0 score
and the Cardinals are out to make a
better record tomorrow. The compara
tive scores of the Stanford and Cali
fornia games with the Vikings will
show their relative strength.
Only one league game remains be
fore the Redshirts battle the California
eleven and the team is rapidly getting
into condition for the big contest of the
season. Burns, substitute goalkeeper,
has been developing into a first-class
player during recent practices and can
take the place of Miles Cray if the
need arises.
The probable lineup for tomorrow's
game as announced by Don Clark, soc
cer mentor, will be as follows: 0.1.,
Schoen; i.1., Quigley; c.f., Strowger;
i.r., Bailard; 0.r., Miron; 1.h.b., Cannon;
c.h.b., Franklin; r.h.b., Bushnell; 1.f.b.,
Holmes; r.f.b., Stollery; goal, Gray.
