"Collegiate" or "Parade of the Wooden Soldiers"? Wilis is best
calculated to make rooters root and gridsters grid ? University bands up
and down the coast, particularly the one at Washington, are in the throes
of a civil war on the question—To jazz or not to jazz? The leader of the
northern aggregation believes jazz ruins technique and he has threatened
to import a commercial band for the Stanford game on November 7.
Our own tooters blossomed forth with several syncopating melodies
last week. Outside of occasional blue notes that weren't strictly "blues,"
they were welcome diversions. It may have been hard on the base
drummer's technique, but it was easier on the ears of the rooting section
than the crash of age-old marches.
The following program might solve the Washington director's
problem:
Processional—"Hotsy Totsy."
Ensemble—"Come, Join the Band."
Address by the director—Talks on Technique.
Drum solo by Captain Tesreau.
Finale—"l Didn't Raise My Boy to Be a Soldier."
As for uniforms, even they are undergoing a change under the
attacks of the "modernists." The Trojan band appeared two weeks ago
in white knickers and epiliptic—no, futuristic sweaters. Too hard on the
eyes. The blue capes of California and military jackets of Stanford are
a bit more soothing.
