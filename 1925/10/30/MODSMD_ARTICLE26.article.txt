# The 						Charleston

### 
"Charleston takes Europe and America by Storm." This sentence
appears in a more or less modified form, at the head of the editorial col
umn of some newspaper almost every day. Commentary of all sorts is
made upon it. The dangers to morality from this negro folk dance are
provoking more discussion and publicity than the election of a governor.
Of course, all the "old timers" openly confess that "nothing like that
was allowed when they were girls," and all the chaps who lack the
physique or perseverance to get a hold of the intricacies of the dance hold
their olefactory organs aloof, and disdainfully declare it "vulgar." But
be thai as it may, we sincerely believe that the whole rumpus is a case of
much ado over nothing. The Charleston is at present a fad not even
worth writing home about, and it is ridiculous to lose any sleep about its
corrupting influence on the morals of the country's youth. The modern
generation of youngsters is far too sophisticated to have its morals seri
ously affected by any dance that has yet been conceived.
•So, tile best thing you can do is to dance the Charleston until you get
good and tired of it. then forget it, and allow it to assume its justly unim
portant position in the distant background.
