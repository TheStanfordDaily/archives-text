# Safety Unheeded

Several days ago the Daily Palo Alto outlined a campaign which
would make the campus a safer place for pedestrians and automobile
drivers. The essence of the plan was the inspection of brakes and of
headlights. As yet no steps in this direction have been taken by either
the University or the traffic officers on duty here.
Berkeley has worked out a system whereby every automobile is
tested, and if the brakes measure up to the requirements outlined in the
California code a sticker is placed on the windshield, which allows the
autoist to escape further questioning by the officers regarding his brakes.
1 his plan could easily be followed at Stanford, and would give the
traffic officers something to do in their leisure moments. At testing lane
could be painted on Palm Drive and every passing campus car could be
inspected and tagged. In a short time every car would be forced to be
equipped with brakes, and then danger from accident swould be materially
lessened. Something must be done for safety on the -campus, and this
would be a good start.
