# Literary Magazine Subscriptions
## 
### 
A drive lias been started to secure 700 subscriptions to the new Stan
ford Literary Magazine, which has set December 15 as the date for the
appearance of the first issue. So far but 300 subscriptions have been sold.
If the contemplated Literary Magazine is to become a reality, it will
be necessary that the total sales reach 700. The managers have figured
accurately and should the demand fall below this figure the magazine's
exsitence will l>e in jeopardy from the start. Stanford needs a publication
of this character and it behooves a large per cent of the students to rally
to the banner of the magazine and lend a helping hand in order that it
may become an actuality. The purchase of a subscription is one means
of helping.

A critic is wanted for the recent book, "Profits." Why not a reviewing
committee of John D. Rockefeller, Judge Gary, Henry Ford, and â€”oh, yes, the
Smith Brothers?
