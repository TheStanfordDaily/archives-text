# ADVERTISING DRIVE NETS BRANNER MEN FOURTEEN ANSWERS
## 
### 
After receiving fourteen replies
to their classified advertisement for
blind dates, the two Branner men
have decided to withhold their final
selections for partners until more
offers have been made.
Judging from the variety of
names signed to the letters, such
as Aphrodite, Lonesome, and All
Alone, campus humorists, women,
or otherwise, have not missed the
humor of the situation. One letter
arrived yesterday afternoon from
San Francisco and another from
Palo Alto from applicants wishing
to relieve the shortage of women
on the campus. Several letters ex
press anonymous sympathy for the
would-be queeners.
One of the roughs responsible for
the advertisement has never at
tended a campus dance and decided
that this method would be a way to
get acquainted with Stanford wo
men. Unfortunately, Stanford wo
men did not respond with much en
thusiasm, hence the delay. The an
nouncement to the classified adver
tisement as sent out by the campus
correspondents will probably cause
a flood of offers to arrive at post
office box 1135 this afternoon from
nearby cities.
The weighty decision must be
made before tomorrow night, which
is the occasion of the Branner
dance.
