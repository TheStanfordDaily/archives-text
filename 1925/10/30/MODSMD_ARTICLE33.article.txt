# DAY'S DOINGS

Things are happening all around us,
Things are happening, that is true,
And the ones who read the Daily,
Know whom they are happening to.
Oregon's eccentric team.
That's been so flashy, now and then.
Will have its work cut out for it,
In stopping Nevers and his men.
And our Freshmen feeling happy,
Even though they've met defeat,
Are all ready for tomorrow,
Craving raw and bloody meat.
Soph-mores set to have a meeting,
For discussing Soph-more Week,
Incidentally they should know,
The Freshman Dink is now a freak.
And there comes for your uplifting,
An exhibit of good art,
Let us hope the thronging students
Do not tear the place apart.
Rooters now have been admitted,
To see Warner's secret stuff,
Varsity has been reported
To be looking fast and tough.
