# W. D. ALLEN OFFERS COMPLETE SONATA IN MEMORIAL RECITAL
## 
### 
A varied program of organ music I
will be offered by Warren D. Allen,
University organist, at 4 o'clock Sun
day afternoon in the Memorial Church.
A complete organ sonata in four move
ments will open the recital which also
includes compositions of Leo Sowerby
and Franz Schubert.
Joseph Rheinberger's "Sonata in D
flat" has the large opus number of
154, an indication of the grelit amount
of music produced by its composer.
Rheinberger was an organist of the
older school, living about the time of
Felix Mendelssohn, of whom his style
of writing is reminiscent.
The movements of the sonata are:
Phantasie, Pastorale, Introduction, and I
Fugue. The pastorale has a very j
charming melody while the Fugue is a
good example of the polyphonic form
of music.
"Invocation," by Theodore Salome,

will follow. "Litany," by Franz Schu
bert, is a work of one of the world's
greatest masters of melody. Schubert
had a gift of producing spontaneous
melodies that has never been equaled.
His songs, of which there are hun
dreds, are masterpieces of their kind.
The Litany is entitled "Rest in Peace,
All Souls Departed."
