# MODESTO SQUAD TO MEET FRESHMEN TOMORROW
## Junior College Team Will Give Babes Last Fight Before Big Contest 
### Frank Baker 
Stanford freshmen will be seen in
their final dress rehearsal for the Lit
tle Big Game when they meet Modesto
Junior College eleven in the stadium
tomorrow at 1 o'clock. The showing
the Babes make in this game will be
a good gauge as to what can be ex
pected the following Saturday against
the California Cubs.
Modesto has one of the strongest
Junior College teams in the state
which was proven last Saturday when
they beat California Polytechnic, of
San Luis Obispo, 13 to 0. The Poly
technic school was barely edged out
20 to 19 by the Stanford Grays two
weeks ago. Modesto tied the Fresno
Teachers College G to G just after the
Teachers played Occidental a close
game. The Junior College has a strong
line and resorts to line-plunging when
yards are needed, though they have a
good passing attack which was used
effectively against California Poly.
Jack Railsback, a scrappy and clever
end, is one of the men the freshmen
will have to look out for. Captain Bill
Klaismer, Muirhead, and Von Tagen,
are the men expected to put the ball
over for Junior College. Von Tagen
has been playing stellar football all
year and is Modesto's triple-threat
man.
Coach Husky Hunt will probably
run in most of his available men in
order to give them some experience
in case they are needed for the Bear
contest. Frosty Frost, the little 145-
pound halfback, will undoubtedly get
a chance to show if his receiving of
passes last Saturday was only an in
spiration, or if he can do it regularly.
A man who can hang onto a passed ball
will be a great addition to the fresh
man offense. Smalling, at fullback, has
more thorough knowledge of the game.
For a man who had never played foot
ball before, his record this season is
remarkable. Klabau will be seen again
tomorrow in Ray Tandy's position at
right tackle. He has been holding
down the job creditably all week, and
will make his side almost as strong as
if Tandy himself were there. Tandy
has not been able to be on the field
at all this week, on account of a
wrecked knee, and it is doubtful if he
will be used against California.
Tomorrow's starting lineup will be:
ends. Harder and Rehrig or Worden;
tackles, Artman and Klabau; guards,
Doyle and Jones; center, Vermilya;
quarterback, Lewis; halfbacks, Wilton
or Marks and Sims; fullback, Smalling.
