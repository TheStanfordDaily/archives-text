### Herbert Klein 
Stanford again took the lead in theJ
race for the year's championship in j
the P. A. A. swimming events by mak
ing fourteen points in the meet held |
last Saturday afternoon at Encina j
Pool. As a result, the score to date |
stands Stanford 35, Olympic Club 2G. j
The Club swimmers were able to j
amass only four points, the San Fran- j
cisco Elks Club five, and San Jose!
four. Allen and Carl Stevenson each j
contributed five points to the Cardinal
total in the 220-yard breaststroke and
500-yard free style by their victories, i
Fast times were made in exhibition j
swims by Doug Ackermann and Wally j
O'Connor, O'Connor going 2-5 of a sec-1
ond under the present Pacific Coast
collegiate record for fifty yards.
Stevenson Wins
A first, a second, two thirds and a j
tied-for-first accounted for the Stan-j
ford points. Carl Stevenson, stellar |
middle-distance man, won the 500-yard 1
free style in the fast time of 6:19. j
Without apparent effort Stevenson
pulled away from his rivals and fin- 1
ished with plenty to spare. Frank
Mooney of the Olympic Club was sec
ond, while Arden Allen of Stanford, |
who had already made points in the !
220-yard breaststroke, finished third :
after threatening Mooney's lead for 1
about twelve of the fifteen laps.
The most closely contested race of
the meet was the 220-yard breaststroke |
event in which Bob Willis of San Jose ;
was awarded a tie for first place with
Arden Allen of Stanford. Ed Sullivan j
of the Olympic Club was third as the
result of the omission, by Eric Krae
mer, a former Stanford star and now
an Olympic Club man, of the final
stroke at the end of the race. The time
of 3:19 was exceptionally good, espe- j.
cially when it is considered that this '
was Allen's first competition an a
breaststroke race.
Pentathlon Close
The results of the pentathlon were
in doubt until the last event, the div
ing, had been run off. When the points [
were added it was found that Joe

ond, while Arden Allen of Stanford, |
who had already made points in the !
220-yard breaststroke, finished third :
after threatening Mooney's lead for 1
about twelve of the fifteen laps.
The most closely contested race of
the meet was the 220-yard breaststroke |
event in which Bob Willis of San Jose ;
was awarded a tie for first place with
Arden Allen of Stanford. Ed Sullivan j
of the Olympic Club was third as the
result of the omission, by Eric Krae
mer, a former Stanford star and now
an Olympic Club man, of the final
stroke at the end of the race. The time
of 3:19 was exceptionally good, espe- j.
cially when it is considered that this '
was Allen's first competition an a
breaststroke race.
Pentathlon Close
The results of the pentathlon were
in doubt until the last event, the div
ing, had been run off. When the points [
were added it was found that Joe
Aleck of the San Francisco Elks Club
was winner with one first and four j
seconds in the five events. Ted Smith;
and Bob Williams finished second and
third respectively, Smith with two
firsts, one second, and two thirds, and
Williams with two firsts and two ■
thirds.
Several exhibitions were given in
the intervals while the pentathlon com-1
petitors rested between events. In 50
yards, against time, Wally O'Connor
made 23 1-5 seconds, 2-5 of a seconl
under the present Pacific Coast Colle-;
giate record. A Stanford relay team
came within 3-5 of a second of the rec
ord, held by Stanford, for the 400-foot !
relay. Dave Fall and A1 White gave
exhibition dives.
Stanford again took the lead in theJ
race for the year's championship in j
the P. A. A. swimming events by mak
ing fourteen points in the meet held |
last Saturday afternoon at Encina j
Pool. As a result, the score to date |
stands Stanford 35, Olympic Club 2G. j
The Club swimmers were able to j
amass only four points, the San Fran- j
cisco Elks Club five, and San Jose!
four. Allen and Carl Stevenson each j
contributed five points to the Cardinal
total in the 220-yard breaststroke and
500-yard free style by their victories, i
Fast times were made in exhibition j
swims by Doug Ackermann and Wally j
O'Connor, O'Connor going 2-5 of a sec-1
ond under the present Pacific Coast
collegiate record for fifty yards.
Stevenson Wins
A first, a second, two thirds and a j
tied-for-first accounted for the Stan-j
ford points. Carl Stevenson, stellar |
middle-distance man, won the 500-yard 1
free style in the fast time of 6:19. j
Without apparent effort Stevenson
pulled away from his rivals and fin- 1
ished with plenty to spare. Frank
Mooney of the Olympic Club was sec
ond, while Arden Allen of Stanford, |
who had already made points in the !
220-yard breaststroke, finished third :
