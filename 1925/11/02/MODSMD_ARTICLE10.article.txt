# FAILURE TO RECORD RESULTS RETARDS TOURNEY PROGRESS
## 
### 
The University tennis tournament is
being slowed considerably by the fail
ure of players to record the results of
their matches on the tournament cards
in Encina gymnasium. Contestants in
the freshman division are particularly
guilty of this offense, and because of
their failure to mark up their results,
the tourney is still in the first round.
All the other divisions have ad
vanced to the second round, and the
senior tournament is nearly completed
in the third round. The third frame is
scheduled to be completed by Friday,
November 6.
Unless the matches are played off
by the scheduled time the player
whose name appears in the upper half
of each bracket will be forced to for
feit to the player in the lower half.
This ruling has been made to do away
with the unnecessary slowness en
countered so far in the tourney.
