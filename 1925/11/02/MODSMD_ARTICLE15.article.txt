# WILFRED WELLOCK SPEAKS ON BRITISH LABOR CONDITIONS
## English University Students Side With Labor Party Declares Leader 
### 
"At Cambridge, if a student is not a
i member of the Labor Party, his intelli
gence begins to be suspected. British
university students have a highly-de
|veloped political consciousness," de
clared Wilfred Wellock, British labor
leader, at a luncheon given in his
honor Friday noon in the New Union.
"Every English university has its
political clubs and newspapers. The
! clubs hold formal debates in the parlia
mentary style every week or fortnight.
; A question is proposed and argued
; upon, and, inquiries are put to the
speakers from the floor. The political
i newspapers are edited monthly when
political feeling runs high.
"Economic conditions in Great Brit
ain are exceedingly poor. Every town
has its army of unemployed, most of
them dependent upon unemployment
; insurance. Germany is giving so much
! coal to France and Belgium at such
a low price that these countries are
I exporting coal and destroying the Brit
ish market. This has thrown hundreds
of thousands of miners out of work.
1 The question has been asked, 'Why do
lyou not put the men upon the land?'
i The answer is that the land is held by
a few nobles or wealthy men. The
Labor Party wants government" con
trol so that each piece of land may
1 reach is greatest efficiency," said Wel
: lock.
"The Labor Party stands for a scien
| tific program of social and govern
mental development. It believes in
government ownership of some indus
tries. Municipal ownership of tramway
lines has already been successful.
Municipal banks are saving the people
j one and one-half per cent on their
loans now. The Labor Party is not,
however, merely a workers' party.
Many of nobility have been won over
! to it."
Mr. Wellock, who is officially con
nected with the Labor Party, has just
' completed a lecturing tour of Canada,
and will return to New York in a few
I days. He spoke at the Unitarian Church
I Friday evening.
