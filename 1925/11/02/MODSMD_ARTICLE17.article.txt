Carr Portrays Father
Leonard Schwartz and Velma Ran
dall took the roles of the twins, Brad
ley and Lois Ingalls. Both Miss Randall
and Schwartz made their first appear
ance in Stanford dramatics in "Dulcy,"
last year's sophomore play, and were
in the cast of "You and I." Miss Ran
dall also appeared in "Ace High," the
1926 Junior Opera. Schwartz had a
part in "Polly with a Past," the senior
farce.
Robert Carr, as Bernard Ingalls, the
father of the twins, has a part which
is difficult, but has many opportunities
for good characterization. Carr has
had several serious roles in campus
dramatics. He did a lyrical bit called
"Swami" in the Junior Opera, "Fore,"
and was the cause of favorable com
ment as the result of his interpretation
of Banquo in "Macbeth" last winter.
Bernard Ingalls is, therefore, his first
appearance in a modern role.
Kiler Designs Set
Ronald Murdoch will be played by
Wilbert Hammond, well known to cam
pus theatregoers. He was on the 1924
Junior Opera committee and has been
in several Ram's Head shows. He had
a part in "Androcles and the Lion" and
an important role in "The Boomerang."
Elliott Kimberley, the politician, will
be played by Lowell Matthay, who
made his first appearance at Stanford
as the soap manufacturer in "You and
I." Jacob Irwin will take the role of
Leo Day. Irwin was Matey in "Dear
Brutus," presented here October 23.
Leslie Kiler is designing the single
drawing-room set which is the scene
of the entire play. The action takes
place in an American city during
Christmas vacation, when the twins
are home from college.
