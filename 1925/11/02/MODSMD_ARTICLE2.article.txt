# IDEAS DESIRED FOR BIG GAME ROOTING STUNT COMPETITION
## 
### 
More suggestions for Big Game
bleacher stunts are needed before
it will be possible for the stunts
committee to arrange as effective
display as it bas in the past, accord
ing to Frank L. Hastings, member
of the Rally Committee, who is
supervising the contest for the
VVideman perpetual trophy. To date
few ideas have been submitted.
With the deadline set for next
Monday, Hastings emphasizes the
point that all those who have ideas
for stunts, but have not mapped
them out, should get to work imme
diately. In making the diagrams it
is essential to indicate the colors,
but unnecessary to take into ac
count the number of rooters in the
section. As many colors as desired
may be used. Contentants need not
hesitate to hand in a complicated
idea as it can be revised by the
committee if necessary.
It 19 not provided that the plan
should be that of an individual, so it
is possible for the members of a
living group to plan a stunt, submit
it in the name of one of the mem
bers of the organization, and gain
possession of the silver cup for a
year.
Hunches should be mailed or de
livered personally to Hastings at
the Sigma Chi bouse.
