# "Unfair Competition"

"Snap judgments are poor editorial fodder, and unverified attacks on
merchants of the community are poor business for newspaper columns,"
<leclares the Palo Alto Times editorially last Saturday in condemning the
Daily Palo Alto for upholding a Rally Committee enterprise and urging
that students buy rooters' hats from the official merchant who turns over his
profits to the committee, and by so doing makes bleacher stunts possible.
The Palo Alto Times has laid down an ethical rule and then proceeded
to shatter it to bits, in making an unwarranted and basically wrong attack
on the Daily. The Daily Palo Alto is guilty of no wrong, as urged by
the Times, for the Daily made a thorough investigation and after careful
consideration of the rights of the parties concerned expressed the case in
an accurate, truthful, and fair manner, something the Times has not con
sidered. The Daily is not ashamed of its stand and takes pride in the fact
that it dares to act independently, upholding the right rather than possible
advertisers' wishes. The Daily Palo Alto is published primarily to fur
ther student interests and activities and subrogates everything to that one
purpose, even including possible pecuniary gain.
The Daily Palo Alto can manage its own affairs and does not care
to have advice handed to it from a one-sided, perverted point of view by a
journal assuming a benevolent fatherly role.
