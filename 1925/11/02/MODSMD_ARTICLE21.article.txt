# Bleacher Stunts
## 
### 
For six minutes between halves at the Big Game last year, ninety-five
thousand spectators thrilled as the Cardinal rooting section performed
stunts, and then the crowd was unanimous in the opinion that they were the
best ever presented by a college rooting section. Now that Stanford has
such a reputation care should be taken to build an even greater one, and
can only be done by making this year's stunts surpass those of 1924.
The Rally Committee is hard at work arranging an effective display,
but the students themselves will have to assist by making worthwhile sug
gestions for additional stunts. As an incentive, a perpetual trophy in the i
nature of a loving cup is being awarded to the originator of the best ideas.
Few schemes have been sent to the Rally Committee to date. If that
organization is to continue its good work the support and co-operation of
the campus is absolutely essential. The Rally Committee wants ideas, and
will consider everything, no matter how expensive or pretentious it may be.;
The committee members will revise plans until they are feasible, but
the one who made the first suggestion will still have his chance at the prize.
It is possible for a whole living group to devise the winning scheme and
win the trophy for itself. Students will do well to talk over stunts at the,
dinner table and then send in the best ideas to the committee. Silver lov- |
ing cups on the mantle do look well!
