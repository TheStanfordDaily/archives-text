# "The Doom of the Self-Made Man"
## 
### 
An answer to the blustering, pompous "self-made" man is found in j
an analogy drawn by Richard J. Walsh in the University of Idaho Argo-1
naut. Walsh shows that twenty years hence a man must have a college
education to triumph in business, just as the doctors and lawyers of today!
to succeed must have had professional education. Walsh's views follow: j
"I am a self-made doctor. I never went to medical school. I learned
all the medicine I know in the great university of human suffering. I j
began as an orderly in a hospital, and rose by watching doctors work, try
ing harder than the other fellows, and selling myself to my superiors. To
day I am head of my own institution and have the largest practice in the;
state."
It sounds absurd, doesn't it? You would brand as a quack any phy
sician who talked so. We do not let such men tamper with our bodies.
Now let us change a few of the words:
"I am a self-made lawyer. I never went to law school. I learned all
the law I know in the great university of human frailty. I began as a;
clerk in an office, and rose by working with lawyers, trying harder than ;
the other fellows, and selling myself to my superiors. Today lam head
of my own firm and have the largest practice in the state."
Not quite so absurd; many of us know lawyers trained in that way.
But few of us would retain such a lawyer for a serious and intricate suit.
Change the nouns once more:
"I am a self-made captain of industry. I never went to college. I
learned all the business I know in the great university of human nature.
I began as a workman in a factory, and rose by watching the operations,
trying harder than the other fellow, and selling myself to my superiors.
Today I am head of my own plant and do the largest business in the state."
And that doesn't sound absurd at allâ€”to the older generation. It is
beginning to offend the ear of the. younger men. * In the era just past we
have listened often and with respect to the biography of the self-made
business leader, and have rated his boast an honorable one. Twenty years
hence it will sound as crude and incongruous as talk of self-made doctors.
We will not then let men who have no professional business training tamper
with the delicate organism of industry, with the critical balance of supply
and demand, and with the human destinies of thousands of workers.
The doom of the self-made manager will not be decreed by law or
boycott. The inexorable hand of competition will thrust him away. One
by one those who have learned the management of other men only by the
slow and costly method of hunch and mistake will yield their desks to !
executives who have been professionally trained. I
