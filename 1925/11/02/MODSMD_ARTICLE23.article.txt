The Advantages of Getting
Rid of the Ball
, The principal bone of contention in
all football games seems to be the
football, unless, perhaps, it is the
referee. Now if a team can get rid of
the ball it follows obviously that all
opposition will be obviated; since there
will no longer b£ anything to fight
' about.
Once the ball is eliminated from the
| game, the team without the ball can
i march down the field until it is near
| the opponents' goal line. The march
| irig formation is usually double file, al
though a very good effect can be ob
tained by marching four abreast. It is
bad form to march farther than the
length of the field at once.
Once the team has reached its op
; ponents* goal line the ball is again
| produced and placed on the other side
I of the goal line for a touchdown.
The man who makes this touchdown
should learn to do so gracefully. He
' should not dive over the goal line and
land flatly and uninterestingly on the
ground. He should, rather, skip lightly
over the line, and once safely on the
i other side, he should then kneel on
his left knee and firmly but not harsh
j ly against the turf.
There are several ways to get rid
! of the ball in the center of the field by
j calling a box formation play. When
I the march to the goal line is complete,
another box formation play is called.
I When the team is playing on an op
ponent's field, the best way to get rid
of the ball is to kick it in the wrong
direction so that it goes outside of
the stadium. The backfield men and
the center should carry deflated foot
balls as shoulder pads which can be
inflated during the march down the
field and then uncovered at the goal
line.

We should think that the freshmen
would be rathar sensitive regarding
the wording of the blotters which were
distributed at Encina last wek. They
read something like this: "Children's
Haircutting a Specialty—Clipper Bros.,
On the Circle."

The "Daily Palo Alto" of 1902 reports
that it was necessary to appoint spe
cial police to prevent an outbreak be
tween the warring factions at the
sophomore elections. Since the sopho
mores weren't allowed to bring fire
arms to the polls, we wonder if they
came armed with shears, prepared to
fall viciously upon the beards of rival
politicians?

Has it ever been settled whether the
smooth-shaven, creamy-complexioned
college man of today is the result of
declining masculinity, or a result of
the advertising skill of Mr. Gillette?
