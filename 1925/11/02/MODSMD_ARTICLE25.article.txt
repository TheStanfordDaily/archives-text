# DAY'S DOINGS

### 
<$> Ted Elias, Jr. $>

Things are happening all around us,
Things are happening, that is true,
And the ones who read the Daily,
Know who they are happening to.
Varsity went like a million,
Through and 'round the opponent's
team,
Ran their biggest score this season,
Showed a world of fight and steam.
Freshmen also won their contest,
From the Modesto Junior College,
They looked good with Warner's sys
tem,
And displayed some football knowledge.
Sale of tickets soon will open,
For the latest Campus play,
"Goose Hangs High" should be suc
cessful,
Those who've seen rehearsals say.
Don't forget the Rally contest,
Someone's going to win the prize,
Help us give the Golden Bear
A real, original surprise.
Chappie soon will be among us,
Wednesday is the happy day.
Thirty cents is "What Price Humor,"
This investment will repay.
