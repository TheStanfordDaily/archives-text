# REDWOOD TREE ON STANFORD EMBLEM WAS LANDMARK FOR PIONEER SETTLERS
## 
### Monroe Eaton 
To the casual observer the gnarled red
wood tree that forms the lone emblem
on the seal of Lcland Stanford Junior
University has no significance except as
an ornament; but history reveals to us
that in the days of the first white men
in California this redwood was an im
portant landmark of the Santa Clara
V alley.
It is known for a certainty that at
least three important expeditions sent out
by the Spanish Government to search
for San Francisco Bay camped near this
tree, in the years 1769, 1774, and 1776.
Site of Camp
The first of these expeditions, under
Don Caspar de Portola, was probably
the first party of white men to enter the
Santa Clara Valley. The diaries of two
members of the party indicate that the
expedition camped on a creek closely
answering the description of San Fran
cisquito Creek, and that a conference
was held under the huge redwood tree.
In 1774 a party under Rivers camped
on the banks of San Francisquita Creek
and Father Palou, a member of the
party, relates in his diary: "Some hun
dred paces below the ford stood a great
redwood, seen for more than «a league
before reaching the arroyo; and which
from a distance looked like a tower."
Father Palou erected a cross here, think
ing that it would be a £ood site for a
mission, but it was later discovered that
the San Francisquito Creek ran dry in
the summer.
Was Landmark
In the early days, before the introduc
tion of the eucalyptus, the redwood
towered above the oaks surrounding it.
Its gigantic size and the fact that it was
the only tree of its kind growing in the
valley made it a landmark.
In 1776 another famous expedition un
der Aii7.a made camp under the giant
redwood. Wc quote directly from the
diary of Pedro Pont, who accompanied
this successful explorer. "From a slight
eminence (probably one of the hills now
tunnelled by the Southern Pacific leav
ing San Francisco) I observed the lay
of the port (San Francisco Bay), and
sa wthat its extremity lay to the east
southeast. I also noticed a very high
spruce tree, which is to be seen at a
great distance, rising up like a great
tower. It stands on the banks of the
Arroyo de San Francisco; later on T
measured its height."
Height Measured
The explorer records the instances of
the journey from his point of observa
tion to the place where the party camped
near the tree. He then gives his meas
urements of the redwood. ' 1 measured
its height with the graphometer which
they lent me at the mission of San Carlos
del Carmelo, and, according to my reck
oning, found it to be some fifty yards
high ;the trunk was five yards and one
half in circumference at the base, and
the soldiers said that were still larger
ones in the mountains."
At present the Palo Alto tree is twen
ty-three feet in circumference, showing
an increase of six and a half feet, since
the days of the first white men. Taking
this rate of growth as a basis for calcu
lation, it could safely be said that the
Palo Alto redwood was a healthy sapling
when Christopher Columbus first landed
in America.
