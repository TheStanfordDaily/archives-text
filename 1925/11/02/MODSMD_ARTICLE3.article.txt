# BACKFIELD STARS WHEN BABES WHIP MODESTO COLLEGE
## Coach Hunt's First-Year Men Play Erratic Football; Weak on Defense 
### Frank Baker 
[ In the most erratic game that has
| been seen in the stadium this year, the
! Stanford-Freshman football team de
feated Modesto Junior College 45 to

formers of the day, with Frost, back
field man, also showing to advantage.
Smalling made four of the seven touch

outstanding of which was a ninety

| to the goal. He made several twenty
j yard end runs, and caught a perfect
! pass from Marks for another touch
down, this giving him twelve points
for the day. Doug Lewis, substituting
for Smalling, intercepted a pass in the
last few minutes and made the final
|score.
Fumbles were again the freshmen's
weak point. Both of Modesto's touch
downs were the direct results of poor
