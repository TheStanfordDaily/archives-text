# BACKFIELD STARS WHEN BABES WHIP MODESTO COLLEGE
## Coach Hunt's First-Year Men Play Erratic Football; Weak on Defense 
### Frank Baker 
[ In the most erratic game that has
| been seen in the stadium this year, the
! Stanford-Freshman football team de
feated Modesto Junior College 45 to
j 13. The freshmen started off poorly by
fumbling on their own 10-yard line
| and allowing a Junior College man to
recover the ball for a touchdown, but
immediately afterwards the babes
marched down from the 48-yard line
to the goal in five plays. During the
whole of the first half the team with
Uhe ball was the only one on the field,
both teams being good on offense, but
poor on defense. The second half,
though loosely played, clearly belonged
to the freshmen. Modesto failed to
score after the second period.
Backfield Stars
[ Smalling, freshman fullback, and
; Hawley, halfback, were the star per
formers of the day, with Frost, back
field man, also showing to advantage.
Smalling made four of the seven touch
-1 downs, and played a steady defensive
game. Hawley is a new man, but made
: a number of sensational runs, the most
outstanding of which was a ninety
i yard dash from his own 10-yard line
| to the goal. He made several twenty
j yard end runs, and caught a perfect
! pass from Marks for another touch
down, this giving him twelve points
for the day. Doug Lewis, substituting
for Smalling, intercepted a pass in the
last few minutes and made the final
|score.
Fumbles were again the freshmen's
weak point. Both of Modesto's touch
downs were the direct results of poor
handling the ball. At the very start
of the game Modesto recovered the
ball and ran ten yards for a score,
then in the second quarter they re
trieved another freshman fumble on
the yearling 20-yard line, and put the
ball over in five plays.
Junior College Weak
Rather than to any particular
strength or stellar playing of the
babes, the final result should be cred
ited to faulty tackling and a general
laxity on the part of the Junior College.
Though making seven touchdowns,
the yearlings converted only three
times. The fault lay mainly with the
line, which was weak on the defense
and in blocking. The battle for suprem
acy was fought by the backfields, who
ran around almost at will when they
had the ball.
Coach Husky Hunt was scouting the
California freshmen at Berkeley, leav
ing Myron Sprague, line coach, in
charge. The starting lineup: ends,
Worden and Harder; tackles, Artman
and Klabau; guards, Doyle and Jones;
center, Vermilya; quarterback, Lewis;
halfbacks, Marks and Hawley; full
back, Smalling.

times. The fault lay mainly with the
line, which was weak on the defense
and in blocking. The battle for suprem
acy was fought by the backfields, who
ran around almost at will when they
had the ball.
Coach Husky Hunt was scouting the
California freshmen at Berkeley, leav
ing Myron Sprague, line coach, in
charge. The starting lineup: ends,
Worden and Harder; tackles, Artman
and Klabau; guards, Doyle and Jones;
center, Vermilya; quarterback, Lewis;
halfbacks, Marks and Hawley; full
back, Smalling.
[ In the most erratic game that has
| been seen in the stadium this year, the
! Stanford-Freshman football team de
feated Modesto Junior College 45 to
j 13. The freshmen started off poorly by
fumbling on their own 10-yard line
| and allowing a Junior College man to
recover the ball for a touchdown, but
immediately afterwards the babes
marched down from the 48-yard line
to the goal in five plays. During the
whole of the first half the team with
Uhe ball was the only one on the field,
both teams being good on offense, but
poor on defense. The second half,
though loosely played, clearly belonged
to the freshmen. Modesto failed to
score after the second period.
Backfield Stars
[ Smalling, freshman fullback, and
; Hawley, halfback, were the star per
formers of the day, with Frost, back
field man, also showing to advantage.
Smalling made four of the seven touch
-1 downs, and played a steady defensive
game. Hawley is a new man, but made
: a number of sensational runs, the most
outstanding of which was a ninety
i yard dash from his own 10-yard line
| to the goal. He made several twenty
j yard end runs, and caught a perfect
! pass from Marks for another touch
down, this giving him twelve points
for the day. Doug Lewis, substituting
for Smalling, intercepted a pass in the
last few minutes and made the final
|score.
Fumbles were again the freshmen's
weak point. Both of Modesto's touch
downs were the direct results of poor
handling the ball. At the very start
of the game Modesto recovered the
ball and ran ten yards for a score,
then in the second quarter they re
trieved another freshman fumble on
the yearling 20-yard line, and put the
ball over in five plays.
Junior College Weak
Rather than to any particular
strength or stellar playing of the
babes, the final result should be cred
ited to faulty tackling and a general
laxity on the part of the Junior College.
Though making seven touchdowns,
the yearlings converted only three
times. The fault lay mainly with the
line, which was weak on the defense
and in blocking. The battle for suprem
acy was fought by the backfields, who
