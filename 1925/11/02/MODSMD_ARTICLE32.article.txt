# "HEDGING" EXPLAINED IN ALSBERG'S WORK ON COTTON TRADING
## 
### Fred Hines 
"Future Trading as Insurance in the
Cotton Oil Industry" is the subject of
an article written by Dr. Carl L. Als
berg of the Food Research Institute
! and published in the Journal of Oil and
i Fat Industries. The paper discusses
| "hedging" as a means of equalizing
i price fluctuations in the vegetable oil
| industry.
"Hedging" is explained by Dr. Als
; berg as, from the manufacturer's stand
point, the process of investing in raw
materials to offset fluctuations in fin
ished goods of the same commodity.
1 That is, he bets against himself. If his
{ raw materials decrease in value, so
I will his manufactured goods cost him
I less to produce. Thus he renounces
; speculative gains, but avoids specula
| tive losses. This practice has been
used quite extensively in the milling
industry as a means of insurance.
Dr. Alsberg's investigations show
that the cotton spinning industry,
which makes use of "hedging," has
recovered from post-war depression,
while the cottonseed oil industry, hav
ing no future market where "hedging"
may be carried on, is still suffering
from the slump.
To remedy this condition, Dr. Als
berg suggests the develepoment of a
! wide future market for fats and oils,
i New processes of hardening oils have
! made possible a greater degree of in
; terchangeability. The result is that
I oils and fats will tend to fluctuate to
| getlier, and will thus provide a more
j solid basis for a world-wide future
j market. In addition, fats and oils pos
! sess the needed characteristics for
J deliveries on future contracts: the
i market for them is world-wide; they
are not very perishable; they can be
graded and standardized easily and
j exactly.
When such a market will have been
developed, manufacturers will be able
to operate through speculation special
ists just as they already depend on
! lawyers and bankers for guidance in
their respective fields.
