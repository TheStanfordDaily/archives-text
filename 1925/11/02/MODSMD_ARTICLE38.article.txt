### "FEG" MURRAY, '10 
See the fun-ny mans? His name is Knute Rock-ne. See the house? It is
the Ca-the-dral of No-tre Dame. The fun-ny mans is a foot-ball coach. He is
called the "Wiz-anl of No-tre Dame." A wiz-ard is a man who takes fresh-men
and makes them into horse-men in four years.
Last year the fun-ny mans had four fa-mous horse-men. They were called
the No-tre Dame back-field. They were like the Ca-the-dral because they were
strong, yet graceful. The Ca-the-dral of No-tre Dame has won-der-ful lines, and
last year the No-tre Dame team had a won-der-ful line. But this year things
are not so good.
This year a-bout all the No-tre Dame foot-ball team has is a touch schedule.
They played Bay-lor and Lom-bard and Be-loit, and last week they played the
Ar-my. After that they play Min-ne-so-ta, Geor-gi-a Tech, and Penn State.
And all four games are a-way from home! Then they en-ter-tain Car-neg-ie
Tech and North-west-ern. And that is-n't all, no, not e-ven yet. Rock-ne's
Ram-blers ram-ble to Lin-coln to end the sea-son with a game of tag witb
Ne-bras-ka. End is right!
Why does the fun-ny mans wear that fun-ny hat? Be-cause he has-n't much
hair. Does he care? No —suc-cess-ful men COME OUT ON TOP!
