# DANCING CONTRIBUTES TO CREATIVE EFFORT SAYS MRS. R. CALVIN

The type of dancing which is now
being offered in the dancing courses
of the women's physical education de
partment is an utter departure from
the old set forms of dancing and was
originated by Miss H. Doubler of the
University of Wisconsin, according to
Mrs. Ruth Calvin of the physical edu
cation department at Stanford.
This dancing, sometimes known as
natural or interpretive, breaks away
from the three former types of danc
ing: ballet, aesthetic, and folk, and
there is practically no chance for any
creative effort except in grouping.
Most of the forms, such as toe-dancing,
are highly artificial and are almost
acrobatic. Aesthetic dancing is hardly
more than a less strenuous imitation
of ballet dancing. Peasant or folk danc
ing originated with much the same
spirit as natural dancing, but it in
cluded in its origin the legends, reli
gious rites, and customs of the people
of which we have only a vicarious
knowledge. Therefore folk dancing
loses most of its purpose when imi
tated in this country.
In natural dancing, a foundation is
laid for flexibility and muscular con
trol and as a means to breaking down
inhibitions and restraint in dealing
with the adult by the means of funda
mental exercises. However the ability
to add something to the art of dancing
is reached only after long and painful
studying as in any other art.
