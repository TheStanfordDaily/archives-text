## Oregon Squad Falls Before Onslaught of Murphy, Bogue, and Hyland 
### 
By Wilbur Adams
Stanford defeated Oregon 35 to 13
i Saturday, but Pop Warner was com
pelled to use his whole strength to
win this third conference battle. The
| Cards' second string players were able
i to lead the Lemon and Green varsity
14 to 13 at half time, but a one-point
margin was too small, and the second

star for the visitors. During the hour
of playing be made first downs three
j times by straight bucks. Anderson,
quarterback for Oregon, threw some
nice passes during the game.
The first half was even, Stanford
and Oregon each scoring two touch
downs. The Webfooters made five first
downs, and the Cards were credited
with six first downs. Both of Oregon's
j scores were made on straight football

It took Stanford, or rather Dick Hy
land, less than two minutes to score
! the first touchdowns of the afternoon.
Oregon kicked off to Hyland, who
i sprinted seventy yards to the Beavers'
25-yard line. Only two yards were
gained in the next two plays, and Solo
mon called for a forward pass on the
third try. It was a short pass from
