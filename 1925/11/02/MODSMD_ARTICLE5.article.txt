# CARDINALS GRAB THIRD CONFERENCE FOOTBALL BATTLE
## Oregon Squad Falls Before Onslaught of Murphy, Bogue, and Hyland 
### 
By Wilbur Adams
Stanford defeated Oregon 35 to 13
i Saturday, but Pop Warner was com
pelled to use his whole strength to
win this third conference battle. The
| Cards' second string players were able
i to lead the Lemon and Green varsity
14 to 13 at half time, but a one-point
margin was too small, and the second
part of the game saw Stanford using
her best eleven men. In the second
period Stanford ' whitewashed the
Northerners 21 to 0.
Everything was Hyland in the first
part game. If it had not been for
i his poor punting he would have been
| credited with a perfect day. Bogue and
Murphy, the other halfbacks used Sat
urday, distinguished themselves by
j several long runs. Bogue's forty-six
yard dash in the last quarter resulted
in the final score of the game. With
both Hyland and Nevers out of the
game in the fourth quarter, there was
j some question as to who was to do the
; punting. Murphy was called back for
! the job and in two kicks he averaged
thirty-three yards. In both cases he
I was handicapped by two poor passes
j from center. Jones was the individual
star for the visitors. During the hour
of playing be made first downs three
j times by straight bucks. Anderson,
quarterback for Oregon, threw some
nice passes during the game.
The first half was even, Stanford
and Oregon each scoring two touch
downs. The Webfooters made five first
downs, and the Cards were credited
with six first downs. Both of Oregon's
j scores were made on straight football
through the Stanford line, Jones carry
ing the ball over on both occasions
over center.
It took Stanford, or rather Dick Hy
land, less than two minutes to score
! the first touchdowns of the afternoon.
Oregon kicked off to Hyland, who
i sprinted seventy yards to the Beavers'
25-yard line. Only two yards were
gained in the next two plays, and Solo
mon called for a forward pass on the
third try. It was a short pass from
; Patcliett to Hyland, but the latter got
away, and was only stopped on the
1-foot line. On the next play Patchett
went over guard for the touchdown.
Two long passes were thrown by
Hyland and caught by Middleton dur
ing the course of the afternoon. One
of these throws put Stanford within
striking distance in the first quarter,
and a little later resulted in Stanford's
second score. A pass, Murphy to Ship
key, gave the Cards their third touch
down of the day in the third quarter.
Nevers plowed his way down the field
for six points in the final period, and
after this play Nevers was taken from
the game, having played the whole of
the third quarter and the last few min
utes of the first half. A triple criss
cross with Bogue finally receiving the
ball gave Stanford her final score a
few minutes before the game ended.

with six first downs. Both of Oregon's
j scores were made on straight football
through the Stanford line, Jones carry
ing the ball over on both occasions
over center.
It took Stanford, or rather Dick Hy
land, less than two minutes to score
! the first touchdowns of the afternoon.
Oregon kicked off to Hyland, who
i sprinted seventy yards to the Beavers'
25-yard line. Only two yards were
gained in the next two plays, and Solo
mon called for a forward pass on the
third try. It was a short pass from
; Patcliett to Hyland, but the latter got
away, and was only stopped on the
1-foot line. On the next play Patchett
went over guard for the touchdown.
Two long passes were thrown by
Hyland and caught by Middleton dur
ing the course of the afternoon. One
of these throws put Stanford within
striking distance in the first quarter,
and a little later resulted in Stanford's
second score. A pass, Murphy to Ship
key, gave the Cards their third touch
down of the day in the third quarter.
Nevers plowed his way down the field
for six points in the final period, and
after this play Nevers was taken from
the game, having played the whole of
the third quarter and the last few min
utes of the first half. A triple criss
cross with Bogue finally receiving the
ball gave Stanford her final score a
few minutes before the game ended.

Stanford defeated Oregon 35 to 13
i Saturday, but Pop Warner was com
pelled to use his whole strength to
win this third conference battle. The
| Cards' second string players were able
i to lead the Lemon and Green varsity
14 to 13 at half time, but a one-point
margin was too small, and the second
part of the game saw Stanford using
her best eleven men. In the second
period Stanford ' whitewashed the
Northerners 21 to 0.
Everything was Hyland in the first
part game. If it had not been for
i his poor punting he would have been
| credited with a perfect day. Bogue and
Murphy, the other halfbacks used Sat
urday, distinguished themselves by
j several long runs. Bogue's forty-six
yard dash in the last quarter resulted
in the final score of the game. With
both Hyland and Nevers out of the
game in the fourth quarter, there was
j some question as to who was to do the
; punting. Murphy was called back for
! the job and in two kicks he averaged
thirty-three yards. In both cases he
I was handicapped by two poor passes
j from center. Jones was the individual
star for the visitors. During the hour
of playing be made first downs three
j times by straight bucks. Anderson,
quarterback for Oregon, threw some
nice passes during the game.
The first half was even, Stanford
and Oregon each scoring two touch
downs. The Webfooters made five first
downs, and the Cards were credited
with six first downs. Both of Oregon's
