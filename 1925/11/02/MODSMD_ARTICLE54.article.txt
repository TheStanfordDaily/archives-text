# SENIORS NOSE OUT 1928 MEN IN LAST MINUTE OF CONTEST
## 
### 
An intercepted pass in the last j
twenty seconds of play gave the sen
iors their second victory in the inter
class football games Saturday, this |
time at the expense of the sophomores.
In the other interclass game, the
freshmen had little difficulty in over
coming the juniors, 21 to 0.
Victory for the seniors came after
both teams had see-sawed back and
forth nearly the whole game in an
evenly matched contest. The failure
to score was due to the air-tight de- j
fense offered by both sides. The 1928
men held the seniors for downs on
their own two-yard line on one occa
sion. With the exception of end runs
by Nip McHose, the seniors were un
able to gain ground against the hard-
tackling second-year men. The seniors' i
line was weakened by the absence of
some of the regular members, but the
sophomores lacked the consistent of
fense.
Passes were thrown freely by the
sophomores after they found bucking
the line useless. These passes were the 1
cause of the eventual loss of the game
when a beautiful pass from Red Moore |
was muffed by his teammate on their '
own 20-yard line, and was caught by '
Wolff, who ran the distance to the
goal for the only score oÂ£ the game.
Teamwork and better condition were i
largely responsible for the freshmen's
second victory. Most of their gains j
were made through passes and end
runs, while one touchdown resulted
from an intercepted pass. Sandwick,
for the juniors, called signals well at
quarter on the offensive, and stopped
many of the freshmen's plays from his
position at defensive fullback.
