# DR. BAILEY WILLIS FORECASTS SEVERE QUAKE IN SIX YEARS
## 
### 
"An earthquake which will seriously
affect the southern part of California
will probably come in five or six
years," predicted Dr. Bailey Willis at
a freshman meeting in Encina hall last
evening. "This shock will follow the
recent Santa Barbara earthquake in
much the same manner as the one in
1857 on this coast followed the lighter
shock of 1852."
"These two earthquakes affected the
coast from Monterey to Mexico. The
shock of 1857 was more extensive and
covered a far greater territory than
the one in 1852."
"The recent Santa Barbara earth
quake was just a superficial shock. The
one I predict in about five years will
be of much greater force and will
cover a larger area. The northern part
of the state will also be affected as
the mountains dividing the two sec
tions are so situated that shocks in
either section of the state will also
affect the other."
Dr. Willis spoke at a freshman meet
ing which was planned by a Y. M. C.
A. committee at which Wallace Cath
cart was chairman. The subject of his
talk was "Men I Have Known."
After his talk he started a discus
sion upon earthquakes and it was
during this discussion that he made
his predictions. Dr. Willis is a noted
authority on earthquakes and predicted
the Santa Barbara disaster.
