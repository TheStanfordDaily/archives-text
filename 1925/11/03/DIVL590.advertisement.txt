One-hoss shay queeners
and long-hairs
IN the olden days when young folks queened
in one-hoss shays, hair-cuts came about
once a month. Today, however, men are more
particular about their appearance.
Especially is the College Man careful about
the impression his hair-cut makes. His hair
must be cut the way he wants it and with
careful workmanship.
Here at the Union, the barbers are skilled in
giving Collegians the carefully finished hair
cuts that they demand. Come in and see for
yourself.
Sincerely,
Jim & Ernie
