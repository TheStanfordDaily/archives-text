Do You Know How Pretty
Linoleum Is?
Until you have seen the charming new designs of Armstrong's
Linoleum you cannot imagine how pretty linoleum can be!
This chic tile pattern, for instance, how attractive it makes this
dining-room! It was selected to match the hangings and furniture.
And that's just the beauty of linoleumâ€”you can choose the color and
pattern best calculated to show up the furniture. It is warm in
winter; soft to tread upon, and easily kept clean.
Let Us Lay Your Floor
We lay this modern flooring the modern way. No tacks or brads
used. First, a soft cushion of deadening felt. Then the linoleum is
firmly cemented in place. The job is done at one time without a later
call to cut and refit.
Waxed occasionally, this gives you THE sensible modern floor.
A dust mop keeps it clean. It is comfortable and quiet. It is abso
lutely sanitary. It is a permanent floor. It keeps its color and design,
for the pretty patterns are INLAID clear through to the tough back.
