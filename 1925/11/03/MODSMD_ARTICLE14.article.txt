# FAVORITES WIN IN SECOND ROUND OF BABE NET TOURNEY
## 
### 
With all the favorites emerging un
defeated from the second round of the
freshman tennis tournament, the third
round should furnish some hotly con
tested matches. Practically all matches
in the second bracket have been played
off, while Dave Robb, the sensational
net star from Pauling Preparatory
School of New York, has already won
his third match against Godsol, winning
6—3, 6—2. Those players who have won
their first two matches and will play in
the third round of the tournament are:
John Williams, Paul Mockett, Lawrence
Hall, Joe Bitterlin, Kenneth Howard,
Robert West, Ernest Renzel, Paul Sex
son, John Whcatly, Rupert Adams, and
G. Williams. Lewis, Vincent, Murray,
Peck, Manwaring, and Humphreville
have not yet played off their second
matches.
Robb, Renzel, Wheatly, and John Wil
liams are the favorites to take the first
places in the tournament, mainly because
of the strength of their past records.
Renzel is from San Jose, and won the
Santa Clara County tournament last
spring, holding down the position of first
man on the high school team for the last
two years. Whcatly is from Lowell High
School in San Francisco and was one
of the school's star net men. John Wil
liams and Paul Scxson, both from Ari
zona, were winner and runner-up in the
Arizona State High School champion
ship matches last year. Raymond of
New York, Ken Howard of Sacramento,
and McCandless of Inglewood, arc also
players of ability.
The tournament will determine the
rating of-the freshman tennis squad.
