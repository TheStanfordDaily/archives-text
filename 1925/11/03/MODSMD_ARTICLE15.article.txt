# FOOTBALL SQUAD LEAVES TOMORROW NIGHT FOR NORTH
## Washington Has Scored 346 Points in Seven Games Played This Year 
### Wilbur Adams 
Pop Warner has put his football
team through their final workout 011
home grounds before leaving for
Seattle tomorrow night. 111 the north
ern city Stanford will meet the Uni-;
versity of Washington to decide which
one of the two teams should remain
tied with California for the Pacific
Coast Conference title.
Washington leads all coast teams for |
the highest total of points accumulated
so far this year. In seven games the
Huskies have amassed 346 points or ;
an average of almost fifty counts to i
a contest. U. S. C. has made 330 points 1
in the same number of battles. The 1
defensive record of the Washington
team is as impressive as its scoring
performance, for only eight points
have been chalked up against it. Ne
braska made the only touchdown on |
the Huskies so far this season. Whit-!
man scored two points against Wash- j
ington on a safety.
Teams Appear Even
On paper Washington and Stanford '
appear almost even, with a slight shade !
of advantage in the Northerners' favor.
There are no comparative scores by '
which to judge the two elevens, for
Stanford has not met a single one of
! Washington's opponents. Last year the
Huskies tied the Bears and then Stan
ford played an even game with Cali
| fornia. Washington has almost the
[same team this year as they had last
. season, while the Cards have only
three of last year's regulars in the
squad this season. The long trip and
1 the loose sand field at Seattle are both
points in favor of Washington.
Stanford leaves tomorrow with the
j complete squad in perfect physical
shape. Mitchell, who has been put out
of the lineup at quarterback since the
i Southern California game in Los All
- geles, is ready for the Washington
| contest. Harris, Freeman, and Mc
| Creery were taken out of the Oregon
game with slight hurts. These three
j players were in suits yesterday, and
showed no marks of their injuries.
Bonamy, Wilson, and Wright were 011
the crippled list at Washington last
I week, but they have recovered, and it
was mainly Wilson's playing Saturday
j that downed Washington State 23 to 0.
