## 
### 
The University is well supplied in
sources of nearly all types of surfacing
! material. A basalt quarry on the Page
J Mill road has recently been enlarged
both in storage capacity and in plant
t facilities, since the demand for this higli
! grade material has become so great.
The first quarry to be worked in Stan
! ford property was situated near Pro
fessor Townley's house; remains of it
i are still visible. The bottom of Lagunita
| was oncc covered with clay, obtained
from a spot behind the President's house,
i Sandy loam from the hills is used to sur
i farce the athletic fields, while a gravel
deposit near the Stadium furnishes road
i material.
A sandstone of unique texture and
j color is obtained from the quarry near
: Searsville. A New York architect once
wrote to Mr. Roth, asking him where and'
j how he could procure the standstone
' which he had seen used on the Stanford
j campus.
