# SENIOR GRID TEAM TO MEET FRESHMEN IN TITLE CONTEST
## 
### 
Coach Murray Cuddeback's strong
senior eleven will oppose Harry Shipkey's
freshman team in the title game of the
interclass football series, which is sched
uled for next Saturday morning. The
other game appearing on Saturday's card
is the contest between the sophomores
and juniors for third position in the
interclass standing.
The first-year men made a strong im
pression last week by defeating the
juniors, 21-0. The yearlings exhibited a
widely varied attack that completely baf
fled the juniors. Teamwork and much
better condition played a big part in the
freshmen's victory.
The senior-sophomore tussle was
scoreless until the last half-minute of
play, when Wolff intercepted a pass and
ran for a touchdown for the seniors.
The seniors played consistent, straight
football and did not attempt to display
a great variety of plays. Their defense
was notably strong, and it is in this de
partment the game that the seniors
«'ire expected to have an advantage over
the freshmen.
The seniors have kept to straight foot
ball in both of their appearances, so little
■or nothing is known of their attack.
Coach Cuddeback probably has a num
ber of plays in reserve that will prove
■effective when they are needed, and this
fact, together with the first-year eleven's
flashy offensive, should make the game
the most exciting of the series.
