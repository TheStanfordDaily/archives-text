# LOCAL TALENT TO APPEAR AT RALLY FOR HUSKY GAME
## Lapp Books Variety of Acts For Afternoon Rooters' Meeting Tomorrow 
### 
When the rooters rally at the Engineer
ing corner at 3:30 o'clock tomorrow,
shortly before the varsity departs for
Seattle, practically every song and yell
I will be punctuated by an act of enter
tainment, according to Burt Lapp, head
' yell leader.
On a stage, erected especially for the
I occasion, Ram's Head society will pre
j sent a short skit written by Mike Ely
i and Henry Mack. Lapp claims that the
] authors have arranged some choice bits
i of appropriate slapstick.
| When the dramatists have done their
â–  turn, they will retire in favor of the
| Glee Club, which will render several
numbers. The singers have been paying
special attention to the perfection of the
rendition of Stanford songs, and, accord
ing to Lapp, the songs will be of local
i origin.
Frederick E. Gaff and Ferdinand W.
j Mendenhall, a pair of soft shoe artists
! who have picked up a dancing act, will
| clog to the rhythm of a campus orchestra.
' They will give way to the Hunkins*
! quartette, made up of members of the
j Glee Club. The group will sing several
! four-part favorites.
Lapp is making every effort to have
i Andy Kerr address the rooters regard
ing the Washington game. It is doubtful
| whether Kerr will be able to appear, as
he will be busy making last-minute ar
rangements for the team's departure.
