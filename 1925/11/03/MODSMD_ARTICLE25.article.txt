# Football for Individual Good
## 
### 
The southern press is loud in its condemnation of Andy Smith be
cause he, together with a number of his star football players, remained
north while a Bear eleven made up largely of substitutes met and de
feated Pomona at Los Angeles. This is proof that the public is placing
college football on a commercial basis rather than looking to the indi
vidual good and benefits derived to the men who turn out for the team.
Million-dollar stadiums and $5 admission tickets have gone far toward
placing football on a commercial basis. The man who pays $5 for a seat
demands his money's worth, and if aweless, exciting football is not played
he registers a loud kick. Most alumni seem to think that the football
team is run primarily for their benefit, and overlook entirely the twenty
or twenty-five men on the varsity who work harder than the eleven regu
lars and find their only remuneration in a few minutes play during the
easier games.
College athletics originated to supply a need for physical education
among undergraduates. The competitive spirit made colleges strive to
have the best aggregationâ€”the American loves a winner. As this com
petitive spirit increased coaches entered the scene and a better type of
scientific football resulted. At this stage of the game the alumni and
sports followers became enthused and demanded a winner. And now
they are becoming angered when a coach gives some of his men a chance
to enjoy wholesome intercollegiate competition, because other men at the
same university can run faster and kick farther and so give them more
of a three-ring circus.
College athletics are not managed like a circus side show. The coach
who uses fifty men during the season has done more good than the one
who uses fifteen stars consistently. After all, the real good comes from
the physical betterment of the individual and not from running up fifty
points a game or keeping the goal line uncrossed for two seasons.
Coach "Pop" Warner of Stanford for many years has been content
to win his games by a small margin, and in so doing has given a large
number of men a chance to play. A win is a win and if substitutes can
do it so much the better. Football is a college sport and if the public
is going to demand that it have nothing but stars at the game, steps should
he made to keep the knockers out of college games altogether. Andy
Smith did just right in playing his seconds against Pomona.
