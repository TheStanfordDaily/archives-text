# A 						Lazy Woman

A lazy woman. Professor J. 11. Mnirhead of Birmingham University
says lie has never found one. Forty years of teaching substantiates his
statement. lie ascribes the marvel—and a marvel it is if true —to the fact
that women have realized that their opportunity for an education
comes as a privilege.
Education is a privilege without doubt. To the self-supporting stu
dent its opportunities are more than that—they are a god-send. It is a
fight for mental improvement and there never was a struggle fof* better
ment but that it left the winner with an appreciation of his spoils.
Few women need engage themselves in physical toil to gain an edu
cation. As between son and daughter, parents have always given financial
aid to the latter. It seems, furthermore, that women have not needed the
struggle for self-support to appreciate their opportunities, but rather have
applied themselves generally to study in a conscientious manner. Presi
dent Wilbur, in his opening address of the year, stressed that point as
related to Stanford.
But what about the lazy man? ITe certainly exists. In fact, he is so
numerous that numbers seem to give strength and each male slacker
stands by his brother in upholding the popular "Defense of Indolence.''
Is there a cure? Graduates return to their alma maters, clubrooms,
and fraternity balls stressing the matter of scholarship and usually end
up by confessing that sooner or later they were cured of chronic laziness
—but not until they left their school or college. Brought face to face
with WORK, spelled with capital letters only, they quickly evaluate its
necessity.
It is indeed a sad state that undergraduates cannot sooner realize the
importance, some even say joy, of studious pursuit.

Students at the Kansas Aggie school were offended recently when a local
merchant made the letters "K.S.A.C." with prunes. At least he was diplomatic
enough not to use dumb-bells.

Fraternities at Ohio State are looking for a substitute for coal since tlio
recent shortage. We suggest that the freshmen be kept warm with paddles.

The Y. W. C. A. is planning a series of "walk-outs." Why not give practical
lessons in "walk-ins," beginning at, say, Roble Bridge?

Somebody missed a "highly-tuned Ford" yesterday, so the news item reads.
Perhaps it invaded the Memorial Church for a duet with the organ.
