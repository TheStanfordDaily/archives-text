James was the Min-is-ter's son. He
i was Brain-y and a Whiz at Math, but
he was a Dub at Any-thing Else. He
' was the Pride of his Fa-ther, the Pil-lar
j of the Sun-day School, (he sor-row of
i his Mo-ther, and the Dis-gust of his
friends. Then James Went to Col lege.
He grew Whis-kers, Pri-dnd himself
on his Dir-ty Clothes, and be-came
Ve-ry Col-leg-iate. He went Out for
Boxing, and Mar-red his El-e-gant Re
fined Fea-tures. He was Nick-named
Jaz-zie Jim, and His Set was the Fast
est. They did De-vil-ish Things, they
set Fire to the Pre-si-dent's Chi-cken
Coop, and He was Expelled from Col
ieged. Fi-nal-ly, he E-10-ped with a Cho
rus Girl.

There's a lazy old sailor named Mose
Who, having a cold, wisely chose
T"o wait out in a r*alm
With never a qualm
For the breezes to come —blow —his
nose. —L. A. B.

Most of the revenue of the Daily in
1902 seems to have come from adver
tisements for "Boston Garters" and

Is that what one might call "elastic
revenue ?"

Now we understand why the adver
tising staff bewailed the arrival of the
era of dragging socks and drooping
trousers.

The advertising in the present Daily

ton-banded, brawny calves added to j

TO A CO-ED (After a meeting
on the Quad)
I'm wasted and worn and weary and
old;
For why are you always so callous
and cold?
And oh so much warmer and torrid
and nice
Is the feel of the frost and the ache
of the ice
To an arctic explorer afloat on the
floes,
Than thy glacier-like glance 'neath the
"know-it-all nose."
It's colder, I dare to declare to them
all,
Than liquified air or the "heat" in our
hall. —j. p.

For why are you always so callous
and cold?
And oh so much warmer and torrid
and nice
Is the feel of the frost and the ache
of the ice
To an arctic explorer afloat on the
floes,
Than thy glacier-like glance 'neath the
"know-it-all nose."
It's colder, I dare to declare to them
all,
Than liquified air or the "heat" in our
hall. —j. p.

James was the Min-is-ter's son. He

i his Mo-ther, and the Dis-gust of his
friends. Then James Went to Col lege.
He grew Whis-kers, Pri-dnd himself
on his Dir-ty Clothes, and be-came
Ve-ry Col-leg-iate. He went Out for
Boxing, and Mar-red his El-e-gant Re

Jaz-zie Jim, and His Set was the Fast

set Fire to the Pre-si-dent's Chi-cken

Most of the revenue of the Daily in
1902 seems to have come from adver
tisements for "Boston Garters" and
"President Suspenders."

Is that what one might call "elastic
revenue ?"

Now we understand why the adver
tising staff bewailed the arrival of the
era of dragging socks and drooping
trousers.

The advertising in the present Daily
lacks the artistic touch which manly,,
surpender-draped shoulders and Bos
ton-banded, brawny calves added to j
the otherwise dull advertising columns.
