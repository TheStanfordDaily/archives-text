# Traffic Law Obedience Pledged by Violators
## 
### 
Motorists violating traffic laws in San
Francisco are being required to sign a
pledge for future good behavior and safe
driving by Police Judge Joseph M.
Golden, presiding over the traffic court.
Other cities throughout the state will
undoubtedly follow San Francisco's ex
ample.
Judge Golden's adoption of this novel
plan for securing from motorists their
written word of honor to observe the
motor vehicle laws at all times was at
the behest of the California Public
Safety Commission.
