# IMPROVEMENTS MADE IN TELEPHONE SYSTEM
## 
### 
A new switchboard for the local Uni
versity exchange has been ordered and
will be installed by the Pacific Telephone
and Telegraph within the next two
months. It will replace the old switch
board located in back of the registration
offices. The location for the new board
has not definitely been decided on, but
will cither be upstairs in the Adminis
tration building, in the auditing depart
ment, or in the room to the right of Mr.
Roth's office.
The present switchboard is out of date
and inadequate for the service required.
Two operators are now used only on spe
cial occasions, but when the new board,
which is a two position board, is installed
a pair of operators will probably be used
all the time.
