# CAMPUS OPINION
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
We al! are proud of our beautiful
campus. Our stately buildings, beauti-j
ful gardens, and rolling bills have no '
equal anywhere. In Stanford we have I
an outstanding American institution.
Hut aside from our aforementioned
property what have we to show that
Stanford is an American institution?
Surely an abundance of flagless poles
does not proclaim the fact! Is there a
grammar or high school in the United
States without its flag? It is very
doubtful. Why, then, has Stanford ii
campus of empty flag poles?
