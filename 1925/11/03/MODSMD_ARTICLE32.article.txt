I Things are happening all around us,
| Things are happening, that is true,
i Daily Palo Alto readers
I Know whom they are happening to.
Anna Case, the famed soprano,
Widely known throughout the nation,
Gives a concert in assembly,
That should prove a revelation.
After awhile for your amusement,
j Come's Sequoia's Funeral Wake,
| Then the mammoth Freshman Fire,
Burning Berkeley's hopes at stake.
I
j Big debate with California
| To be moved ahead a day,
! From the tenth to the eleventh
! Of November, so they say.
Women's "Y" will give a banquet
; At a quarter after six;
j Congenial Stanford women students
j Get a chance to meet and mix.
! Tomorrow there will be a rally,
j Every fellow must come out,
Or when we try our bleacher stunts
We won't know what it's all about.
