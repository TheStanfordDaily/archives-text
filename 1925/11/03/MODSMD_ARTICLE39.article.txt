# PLANS FOR TRACK SEASON DISCUSSED AT SQUAD MEETING
## Hyland, Work Will Be Tried In Sprints; Leistner Missed in Hurdles 
### Murray Draper 
Plans for the coming track season
■were discussed yesterday afternoon at
a meeting of 35 members of last year's
varsity and frosh squads. Coach Dink
Templeton announced his intention of
•shifting several men to new events,
and outlined training plans for the fall
quarter.
The U. S. C. team, which will be
met early in April, will be the hardest
outfit for the Cards to beat, according
to Templeton, who rates U. S. C. above
California in point of danger to Stan
lord. The Cardinal coach will devote
most of his work during the year to
development of a team strong enough
to defeat the Trojans.
The chief change in events will be
in the quarter-mile, where several of
last year's squad members will be
shifted to the longer distances. Bab
cock, Abramson, McGuire, Borden, and
Bly will try out in the half, mile, and
two-mile runs.
Work Will Try Sprints
Tom Work, stellar high jumper and
Pacific Coast intercollegiate champion
in this event, will be tried out in the
sprints. As Louis Gaspar is at present
the only tried sprinter on the squad,
Templeton is anxious to add another
dependable man in the short races.
Work is said to have shown consider
able ability in the past in this line, and
he may be developed into a sprinter
of ability.
Dick Hyland, halfback on the varsity
football squad, is another man who
will be tried out in the sprints later
in the year, as will Wilbur Adams and
Worthington.
In an attempt to develop greater
strength in the pole vault, Ross Nich
ols, captain of last year's frosh team,
will devote much of his time to this
event. While Nichols has starred
chiefly in the hurdles, he is said to
have possibilities as a pole-vaulter, and
Templeton will seek to develop this
ability during the fall practices.
Leistner Missed
In the hurdle events, men are being
sought to fill the place of Swede Leist
ner, star hurdler who graduated last
year. In the high hurdles Nichols, 1924
national interscholastic hurdle winner,
and Clarence West, captain of the '27
frosh team, will be looked to for the
heavy work. In the lows, Bud Spencer,
former interscholastic champion, and
Wells will be the best bets, according
to present indications. These men will
all work out in both high and low hur
dles, but will devote themselves to
special work in the events noted.
The 440 will be handled by Ted Mil
ler, Pacific Coast champion, and Bill
Storie and Karl Doerr. In the weights,
Biff Hoffman is considered the best
bet. Work, King, and Muhs in the high
jump are all good performers, while
Cruickshank and Meeks will handle
the broad jump.
The varsity candidates not regularly
participating in other sports this quar
ter will be required by Templeton to
report regularly three times a week
throughout the fall quarter for prac-

former interscholastic champion, and
Wells will be the best bets, according
to present indications. These men will
all work out in both high and low hur
dles, but will devote themselves to
special work in the events noted.
The 440 will be handled by Ted Mil
ler, Pacific Coast champion, and Bill
Storie and Karl Doerr. In the weights,
Biff Hoffman is considered the best
bet. Work, King, and Muhs in the high
jump are all good performers, while
Cruickshank and Meeks will handle
the broad jump.

Plans for the coming track season
■were discussed yesterday afternoon at
a meeting of 35 members of last year's
varsity and frosh squads. Coach Dink
Templeton announced his intention of
•shifting several men to new events,
and outlined training plans for the fall
quarter.
The U. S. C. team, which will be
met early in April, will be the hardest
outfit for the Cards to beat, according
to Templeton, who rates U. S. C. above
California in point of danger to Stan
lord. The Cardinal coach will devote
most of his work during the year to
development of a team strong enough
to defeat the Trojans.
The chief change in events will be
in the quarter-mile, where several of
last year's squad members will be
shifted to the longer distances. Bab
cock, Abramson, McGuire, Borden, and
Bly will try out in the half, mile, and
two-mile runs.
Work Will Try Sprints
Tom Work, stellar high jumper and
Pacific Coast intercollegiate champion
in this event, will be tried out in the
sprints. As Louis Gaspar is at present
the only tried sprinter on the squad,
Templeton is anxious to add another
dependable man in the short races.
Work is said to have shown consider
able ability in the past in this line, and
he may be developed into a sprinter
of ability.
Dick Hyland, halfback on the varsity
football squad, is another man who
will be tried out in the sprints later
in the year, as will Wilbur Adams and
Worthington.
In an attempt to develop greater
strength in the pole vault, Ross Nich
ols, captain of last year's frosh team,
will devote much of his time to this
event. While Nichols has starred
chiefly in the hurdles, he is said to
have possibilities as a pole-vaulter, and
Templeton will seek to develop this
ability during the fall practices.
Leistner Missed
In the hurdle events, men are being
sought to fill the place of Swede Leist
ner, star hurdler who graduated last
year. In the high hurdles Nichols, 1924
national interscholastic hurdle winner,
and Clarence West, captain of the '27
frosh team, will be looked to for the
heavy work. In the lows, Bud Spencer,
former interscholastic champion, and
Wells will be the best bets, according
to present indications. These men will
all work out in both high and low hur
dles, but will devote themselves to
special work in the events noted.
