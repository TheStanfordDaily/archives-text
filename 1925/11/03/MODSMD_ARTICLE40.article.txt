## 
### 
Congressman John Philip Hill of
Maryland, leader of the prohibition mod
ification forces at Washington, will ar
rive at San Francisco tomorrow and will
speak at a mass meeting in the Civic
Auditorium, with Attorney William H.
Metson, California chairman of the As
sociation Against the Prohibition Amend
ment, presiding. Congressman Hill's
schedule includes meetings in San Jose
on November 5, Sacramento on Novem
ber 6, and Santa Rosa on November 7.
Congressman Hill, as leader of the
modificationists, has been especially
prominent in this field since he emerged
victorious in a legal contest with the
government in a test case involving his
right to manufacture his own alcoholic
fruit juices in his own back yard. He
plans to introduce a bill in the next ses
sion of Congress modifying the present
prohibition law, so that the manufacture
and sale of light wines and beer will be
permitted. He will return to the East
on November 8.
