# FOOTBALL IMMORTALS
## 
### BY FEG MURRAY, '16 
Is "Red" Grange of Illinois a greater
all-around football player than Walter
Eckersall, Willie Heston, Jim Thorpe,
or Ted Coy, the four mainstays of all
all-time, all-star backfields? And is he
greater than George Gipp and Eddie
Mahan, two of the more modern of the ;
football immortals?
Thorpe, according to nearly all the ;
experts, including his coach, "Pop" i
Warner, was the greatest all-around j
gridiron star who ever lived. He could I
do everything, and do it well. "Red" !
Grange may be a flashier player, but !
"Red" is no punter or goal-kicker, as
the versatile Indian was, nor can he
hit the line as hard, nor is he as great
on defensive play.
And neither can "Red" hit a line
like Willie Heston of Michigan could,
or Ted Coy, that marvel of Yale whose
high knee action bowled over so many
would-be tacklers. Eddie Mahan was a
great broken field runner, one of the

best, but Grange is certainly greater
than Mahan at Malian's own game.
George Gipp of Notre Dame fame,
whose untimely death in 1920 plunged
the whole football world into sorrow,
was like Grange in many respects —

tall, weighing 175 pounds, and a clever
runner and accurate passer. Like
Grange, Gipp used to grip the ball in
l iis right hand and fake throws until
the defense ran back, then tuck the
oall under his arm and run with it.

j Gipp could punt and kick field goals,
but I doubt if Gipp could have scored
j four touchdowns in ten minutes
against the 1924 Michigan varsity.
Walter Ecekrsall, small and fast,
j was a wonderful drop-kicker, but
j Grange's size gives him an edge on
! Walter in other results. Yet Grange
never had to call signals and run the
! team as Eckie did. The Illinois me
teor's record of carrying the ball 2431
yards in 244 plays in his first two
! years as a varsity player will probably
; never be equalled in big-time football.
And remember, Grange has a full sea
i son to go through yet before you can
' compare his record with that of the
1 old stars.

Is "Red" Grange of Illinois a greater
all-around football player than Walter
Eckersall, Willie Heston, Jim Thorpe,
or Ted Coy, the four mainstays of all
all-time, all-star backfields? And is he
greater than George Gipp and Eddie
Mahan, two of the more modern of the ;
football immortals?
Thorpe, according to nearly all the ;
experts, including his coach, "Pop" i
Warner, was the greatest all-around j
gridiron star who ever lived. He could I
do everything, and do it well. "Red" !
Grange may be a flashier player, but !
"Red" is no punter or goal-kicker, as
the versatile Indian was, nor can he
hit the line as hard, nor is he as great
on defensive play.
And neither can "Red" hit a line
like Willie Heston of Michigan could,
or Ted Coy, that marvel of Yale whose
high knee action bowled over so many
would-be tacklers. Eddie Mahan was a
great broken field runner, one of the

best, but Grange is certainly greater
than Mahan at Malian's own game.
George Gipp of Notre Dame fame,
whose untimely death in 1920 plunged
the whole football world into sorrow,
was like Grange in many respects —

tall, weighing 175 pounds, and a clever
runner and accurate passer. Like
Grange, Gipp used to grip the ball in
l iis right hand and fake throws until
the defense ran back, then tuck the
oall under his arm and run with it.

j Gipp could punt and kick field goals,
but I doubt if Gipp could have scored
j four touchdowns in ten minutes
against the 1924 Michigan varsity.
