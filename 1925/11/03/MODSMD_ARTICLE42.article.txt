# DANCE PLANNED BY SENIORS FOR EVENING OF FRESHMAN GAME
## 
### 
The Senior Class will sponser a "Little
| Big Game" dance which will be held in
i the Women's Clubhouse next Saturday
j evening, the day of the Little IJig Game
| between Stanford and California fresh-;
I men.
The dance will be given mainly for
! the purpose of raising money for the I
1 graduating class. In past years senior
| financial obligations and expenditures
j have amounted to a considerable sum,
thus requiring the collection of extremely
high class dues. The executive heads of
the class of 1926 have this year de- f
j cided to raise-money by other means)
| and so to reduce the amount to be col
\ lected from dues.
The first means of raising this money i
: will be by the dance next Saturday.
| Tyroler's orchestra has been engaged for (
| the evening. The dance committee, un- j
der Erwin E. Morrison, has arranged j
for the affair so as to make it a success
from both a social and financial stand
point.
