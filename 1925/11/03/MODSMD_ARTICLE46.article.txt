# U. S. C. to Have Battle Flag As New Athletic Tradition
## 
### 
The University of Southern California j
has added a new tradition. They now j
have a battle flag that will be raised 011 1
the assembly day before each game, and 1
this will be accompanied by ceremonies, j
The flag is to be in charge of the sopho-1
more class, and they have to delegate ;
men to guard the banner during the
whole of the time it is up. If the Tro- j
jans are unlucky in the game, the flag |
will be lowered to half-mast, but if they j
win it will remain up until the following |
Monday.
