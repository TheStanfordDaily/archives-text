# New Union Switchboard Removed to Toyon Hall
## 
### 
The separate switchboard for the call
bell system in the New Union is being
taken out, and its service is to be taken
care of by the switchboard at Toyon.
This will put Encina Hall, Toyon, Bran
ner, and the New Union all under the
same switchboard.
The separate switchboard was an un
necessary expense, and the new arrange
ment will give even better service to those
in the Union, besides saving money.
