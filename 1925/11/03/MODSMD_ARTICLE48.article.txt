# FIRST QUESTIONNAIRE RESULTS ANNOUNCED BY EDUCATION CLUB
## 
### 
More than 200 replies to the problem,
"Why teachers leave the profession,"
have been received from 400 question
naires sent to Stanford alumni engaged
in educational work, according to Lillian
Bidwell, president of the Stanford
Women's Education Club. The first re
sults of this research work, which is to
be carried on for several years, were
announced at an open meeting of the
club last Friday afternoon.
Although these first results were
largely incomplete and inaccurate, three
causes for leaving the educational field
were especially prominent. These were
marriage, better economic possibilities in
other positions, and interest in other pro
fessions. Dissatisfaction with local con
ditions was given as a fourth reason.
Replies will be carefully checked up by
the club in its attempt to determine the
reason prompting educators to withdraw
from this field of work.
The next meeting of the organization
will be held November 13.
