# STANFORD MERMEN NOW TRAINING FOR FINAL P. A. A. SWIM
## Four Events Scheduled to Be Decided in Competition Friday Night 
### Herbert Klein 
With the victories in the P. A. A. ;
swimming events* at Encina Pool last
Saturday as encouragement, Stanford
swimmers are turning all their efforts |
toward getting in top-notch shape for J
the fourth and last P. A. A. champion- j
ship meet to bo held next Friday eve
ning is far too slender for the
Club of Oakland. The point score for i
the season's events now stands, Stan-;
lord 35, Olympic Club 2G. The 9-point
margin is far too slendjetr for the
Cardinal swimmers to have any cause
for over-confidence, especially as the
four events on the program Friday,
night are all events in which the Olym-'
pic Club has good chances for winning, i
The 50- and 100-yard free style, the
150-yard backstroke, the 10-foot spring-1
board diving, and 400-yard relay are
scheduled as the last obstacles which
must be surmounted before the year's
championship can be clinched for Stan
ford. Points for places in all races are
given: 5 for first, 3 for second, and 1
for third place, with the exception of j
the relay which counts 10 for first and j
tj for second place.
Relay Important
The relay will probably decide 1
whether Stanford wins or loses the |
championship, for the "Winged O" |
men are expected to take the majority j
of places in the 50-and 100-yard sprint!
races.
Cardinal entries in the 50 will prob- j
ably include Doug Ackerman and Bob j
Williams. In the 100 Arden Allen, ;
Carl Stevenson, Bob Williams, Phil j
Brooks, and Bill Danford are the most j
promising men, Dave Fall will have to
bear the brunt of the diving competi-.
tion. He meets a dangerous opponent i
in Carroll of the Olympic Club.
Interest always centers in the relay }
races between Cardinal and "Winged ;
O" teams. The clubmen are still thirst-1
ing for revenge for the defeat adminis-1
tered them last spring at Encina Pool
in a 400-foot relay when they unex-j
pectedly lost by G inches. With three j
such men as George Schrotli, Jack
Robertson, and Frank Mooney, and a 1
fourth of almost equal class, they will !
be mighty hard to beat. The most
likely combination to represent Stan-,
ford will be Ackerman, Allan, Wil
liams, and Stevenson.
The Athens Club of Oakland is dedi
eating its new 100x40-foot pool with j
this meet and a large crowd is ex- j
pected to be on hand to see the compe
tition.

in Carroll of the Olympic Club.
Interest always centers in the relay }
races between Cardinal and "Winged ;
O" teams. The clubmen are still thirst-1
ing for revenge for the defeat adminis-1
tered them last spring at Encina Pool
in a 400-foot relay when they unex-j
pectedly lost by G inches. With three j
such men as George Schrotli, Jack
Robertson, and Frank Mooney, and a 1
fourth of almost equal class, they will !
be mighty hard to beat. The most
likely combination to represent Stan-,
ford will be Ackerman, Allan, Wil

The Athens Club of Oakland is dedi
eating its new 100x40-foot pool with j
this meet and a large crowd is ex- j
pected to be on hand to see the compe
tition.
With the victories in the P. A. A. ;
swimming events* at Encina Pool last
Saturday as encouragement, Stanford
swimmers are turning all their efforts |
toward getting in top-notch shape for J
the fourth and last P. A. A. champion- j
ship meet to bo held next Friday eve
ning is far too slender for the
Club of Oakland. The point score for i
the season's events now stands, Stan-;
lord 35, Olympic Club 2G. The 9-point
margin is far too slendjetr for the
Cardinal swimmers to have any cause
for over-confidence, especially as the
four events on the program Friday,
night are all events in which the Olym-'
pic Club has good chances for winning, i
The 50- and 100-yard free style, the
150-yard backstroke, the 10-foot spring-1
board diving, and 400-yard relay are
scheduled as the last obstacles which
must be surmounted before the year's
championship can be clinched for Stan
ford. Points for places in all races are
given: 5 for first, 3 for second, and 1
for third place, with the exception of j
the relay which counts 10 for first and j
tj for second place.
Relay Important
The relay will probably decide 1
whether Stanford wins or loses the |
championship, for the "Winged O" |
men are expected to take the majority j
of places in the 50-and 100-yard sprint!
races.
Cardinal entries in the 50 will prob- j
ably include Doug Ackerman and Bob j
Williams. In the 100 Arden Allen, ;
