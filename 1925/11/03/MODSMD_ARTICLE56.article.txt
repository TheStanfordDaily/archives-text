[ night on the subject, "Phases of Edu
cation in the Philippines." Mr. Naval
j is a Filipino and has been a district
, school supervisor in the Islands.
Naval declared that the education
system of the Philippines as inaugu
| rated by the United States is the bold
! est, most unique experiment ever un
; dertaken by a conquering people, and
I that untold credit should be given to
; this country. Spanish is not the uni
