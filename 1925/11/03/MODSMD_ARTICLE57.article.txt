Bills for syllabus fees will be mailed
out Thursday evening by the cashier
jof the University. The fees will be
i payable in person November 10 only;
| however, checks may be mailed any
i time before or on that date. The usual
fines will be incurred for late payment
of fees.
Students are urged to send in their
payments by check through the mail,
rather than pay them in person, as the
former course will save both the
j cashier and the students trouble.
