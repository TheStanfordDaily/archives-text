# FROSH MEET BEAR YEARLINGS IN LAST CONTEST OF SEASON
## California Team Conceded Edge Over Card Squad; Many Stars Play 
### Frank Baker 
I The California-Stanford freshman i
j football contest Saturday will be the \
culmination of a strenuous seven-week
season for the Cardinals, during which
they have lost one out of five games
played. This defeat was administered !
by the U. S. C. yearlings two weeks
ago.
The Little Big Game will open with
j California conceded the edge for the ;
j third consecutive year. In the two past
j games Coach Husky Hunt has upset j
| the dope by beating the Bears 16 to 0
j and 12 to 0. Whether the feat can be
I repeated this year with the compara-
I tively green material he has to work
j with, is the big question to be decided
i next Saturday.
California Men Star
Hunt has not only had inexperienced
men, but a scarcity of material as well.
On the other hand, California has an
abundance of material and can use any
j eleven out of thirty-five men with
j equal results. Breekenridge, quarter
! back, is California's fastest and trick- i
| iest runner.
i Cockburn, at fullback, has been j
backing up the line like a veteran and
carries the ball through the line with
plenty of power. Barr and Clymer di
| vide the punting honors, Clymer being 1
! the most consistent, but a little slower j
j than Barr at getting the ball away;
I when pressed. The California team is !
I not very efficient at getting down !
under punts.
Card Freshmen Improve
Last Saturday the playing of Ver-1
milya, Card center, with Jones and J
j Klabau on his right side, made a good ,
> combination with Tandy out of the'
game. Doyle, playing left guard, was j
: slow in coming out of the line for |
| interference, but his weight was used
to great advantage in plugging up holes
lin the line.
Wilton and Sims were both given a
rest last week-end in order to be in
the best possible condition for this
j Saturday. Their renewed pep yester
j day showed that the lay-off had done
j them good and clever backfield work
; will be expected of them. Yesterday
i afternoon Walter Hulsman was taken
i off the field with a badly damaged hip,
i acquired while he was clipping out a
! man on interference. It is not known
j whether he will be able to play in
the California contest.
