# STANFORD SECONDS HAVE HARD WORKOUT FOR SATURDAY GAME
## 
### 
In its final week of practice this season, I
the Stanford Grays football squad is be- j
ing put through heavy workouts in prep
aration for the gatne with the California j
Reserves to be played Saturday at 12:30}
in the California Memorial Stadium.
Coach Hal Davis last night put his
men through a hard scrimmage with the |
second team of the varsity squad, and |
tonight plans to scrimmage Coach Husky ;
Hunt's freshman outfit. The Grays to j
date have had but one practice game, and '
will be forced to rely on their scrimmage !
periods for experience.
This lack of games is especially notice- j
able in the offense, which is woefully I
weak. On the defense the team is j
capable of steady, strong work, but the j
line and backfield seem unable to co- j
operate when the ball is in their posses- j
sion. Considerable work is being done I
011 offense this week, and Coach Davis !
hopes to be able to put over a score oni
the Bear team, while he relies on his line j
to hold California safely.
Thirty men will make the trip to
Berkeley Saturday morning by bus.
