# AGITATION TO CUT NUMBER OF SPORT AWARDS RENEWED
## FIRST PLAN REJECTED Executive Committee Names Board of Nine Men to Suggest Revisions 
### 
Agitation to reduce the number of
athletic awards was again manifested
when last night the Executive Com
mittee named a board of nine men to
survey the situation and make sug
gestions for revising the present plan
of imbursing athletes for participation.
The personnel of the board includes
one member of the faculty, Professor
William B. Owens; two members of
the coaching staff, Andrew Kerr and
Harry W. Maloney; two members of
the Executive Committee, Theodore F.
Miller and Karl P. Doerr; and three
members of the student body selected
at large, Charles C. Stratton, Linn M.
Parish, and Edward E. Hardy. Hertli
will head the committee which will
hold its first meeting Thursday night.
The idea of revising the award plan
now in use was introduced last spring
when, upon hearing complaints that
the Block "S" was becoming too com
mon, the executive committee appoint
ed a sub-committee to make investiga
tions and submit a decision.
The plan of the sub-committee was
drawn up in form of a constitutional
amendment which was overwhelming
ly defeated at the spring election by
a 817 to 279 vote.
The scheme voted upon limited the
number of awards by dividing the
sports into three groups—major, min
or, and auxiliary. Four sports were
placed in each of the first two groups
"while the remainder were confined to
the auxiliary division. The Block "S"
was designated as the award for the
sports in the major group, the Block
Circle "S" as that for the minor divi
sion, while participants in the third
class were to be given gold medals.
The amendment also made more spe
cific provisions for the requirements
to obtain an award, than are given in
the present student body constitution.
The sports selected for the major
-ones were track, football, basketball,
and baseball, and those for the minor
group were swimming, tennis, boxing,
and soccer. Provision was made that
by a vote of the student bcrtiy a sport
could be raised from the first to the
second group; thereby displacing some
aport from the first group. Similarly
an auxiliary sport could replace a
minor or major sport.
