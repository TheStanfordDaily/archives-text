# MORE HUNCHES FOR BLEACHER STUNTS SOUGHT BY WHITE
## 
### 
Bleacher stunts at the Big Game
will be inferior to those of previous
years if more suggestions are not
handed in before Monday, according
to Robert White, chairman of the
Rally Committee.
Although the contest to secure
hunches opened more than two weeks
ago, there have been but fifteen turned
in. The larger part of this number
cannot be used because they have
either been used before or because
some are duplicates of others.
White requests that the stunts be
symbolic of Stanford and its relations
with California. Designers should not
worry about the complexity of their
creations, as they can be simplified
by the committee if necessary.
Only seven and a half minutes will
be allowed for conducting the stunts,
so it is the aim of the committee to
make the stunts as short and appro
priate qs possible. Last year fourteen
changes were handled in the allotted
time without spoiling the effect.
All who have ideas but have not
diagramed them should do so at once
and hand them in to Frank Hastings
at the Sigma Chi house, in order to be
enrolled in the Wideman trophy con
test.
