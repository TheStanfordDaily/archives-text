# DR. BAILEY WILLIS CLEARS STATEMENT REGARDING QUAKES
## WILL COME CONTINUALLY Fault from San Luis Obispo to San Diego Subject to Severe Strain

(Editor's note —Professor Bailey
Willis was quoted as predicting an
earthquake in the vicinity of Los
Angeles in about five or six years
in Monday's Daily Palo Alto. The
following interview is presented
to correct the statements attri
buted. to Professor Willis at that
time).

The fault between San Diego and
San Luis Obispo is under a severe
strain, which will probably result in
an earthquake shock in from one to
ten years, according to Professor
Bailey Willis. The record of previous
disturbances along this fault may be
interpreted to mean that there is prob

strain is such as to cause intelligent
men to make reasonable precautions,
he says.
Dr. Willis declared last night:
"Earthquakes are necessary to the
happiness of Californians, for they are
incidents in the development of our
mountains and valleys and without
them there would be no San Francisco
Bay nor any of the mountain ranges
that contribute to the beauty of the
southern coast. They have been active
during several billions of years in pro
ducing a setting in which we live.
Quakes Come at Intervals
"Great earthquakes, however, come
only at long intervals, about once in a
generation, and they have never yet
occurred simultaneously in northern
and southern California. In fact the
Coast Range may be divided into two
provinces, which join near San Juan
Batisto in the latitude of Monterey.
The great shock of 1906 was severe
from San Juan northward for 180
miles, but did not extend south. An
even more violent shock of 1857, which
affected all southern California, was
