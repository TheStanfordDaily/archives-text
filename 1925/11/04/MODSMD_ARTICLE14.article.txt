# DR. BAILEY WILLIS CLEARS STATEMENT REGARDING QUAKES
## WILL COME CONTINUALLY Fault from San Luis Obispo to San Diego Subject to Severe Strain 
### 
(Editor's note â€”Professor Bailey
Willis was quoted as predicting an
earthquake in the vicinity of Los
Angeles in about five or six years
in Monday's Daily Palo Alto. The
following interview is presented
to correct the statements attri
buted. to Professor Willis at that
time).

The fault between San Diego and
San Luis Obispo is under a severe
strain, which will probably result in
an earthquake shock in from one to
ten years, according to Professor
Bailey Willis. The record of previous
disturbances along this fault may be
interpreted to mean that there is prob
ability of a severe shock in the not dis
tant future, and the nature of the
strain is such as to cause intelligent
men to make reasonable precautions,
he says.
Dr. Willis declared last night:
"Earthquakes are necessary to the
happiness of Californians, for they are
incidents in the development of our
mountains and valleys and without
them there would be no San Francisco
Bay nor any of the mountain ranges
that contribute to the beauty of the
southern coast. They have been active
during several billions of years in pro
ducing a setting in which we live.
Quakes Come at Intervals
"Great earthquakes, however, come
only at long intervals, about once in a
generation, and they have never yet
occurred simultaneously in northern
and southern California. In fact the
Coast Range may be divided into two
provinces, which join near San Juan
Batisto in the latitude of Monterey.
The great shock of 1906 was severe
from San Juan northward for 180
miles, but did not extend south. An
even more violent shock of 1857, which
affected all southern California, was
alight north of San Juan. We recog
nize that tlie earthquake history of
two provinces does not seem parallel
and that the shock of 1906, which re
lieved the strain in the northern prov
ince, did not have that effect in the
southern..
"Some three years ago it was shown
by the triangulation that a mountain
peak in the vicinity of Santa Barbara
known as Gaviota Peak had moved
twenty-four feet in thirty years and
indicated a very great strain and prob
able quake.
Willis in Shake
"By good luck I happened to be in
Santa Barbara, when the shock came
and I think it is one of the best earth
quakes that ever happened to Cali
fornia for it has done more to wake
people up to the fact that we should
be careful about our building. But the
Santa Barbara earthquake was a local
affair and it is not reasonable to as
sume tht it relieved the general strain
which exists from San Diego to San
Luis Obispo. If I lived in Southern
California, I would see to it that my
house was well built, that the school
which my children attended was prop
erly constructed, and that my business
also was well-housed. No one knows
whether it will be one year or ten
before a severe earthquake comes, but
when it does come it will come sud
denly, and those who are not prepared
will suffer.. Everyone should be
prepared on the first hint of an
earthquake to jump into a doorway or
to stand close against a wall where
they may be protected from the falling
veneer with which the outside of city
buildings are covered, and from the
rush of panic-stricken people.
