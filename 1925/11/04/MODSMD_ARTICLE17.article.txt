# YEARLING GRIDDERS NAME ROBERT SIMS TO CAPTAIN SQUAD
## California Freshmen Have Heavy Forward Wall; Outweigh Babes 
### 
Bob Sims of Long Beach lias been
elected captain of the 1929 freshman
football and will lead the Cardinals in
the California game Saturday. Siins is a
halfback, and has proven a valuable man
throughout the entire preliminary season.
Sims' athletic experience at Stanford
has gone beyond the gridiron, for by en
tering late last year he was eligible to
compete on the 1928 yearling baseball
and water polo teams.
Prepare for Cubs
The babes, with their newly-elected
captain at the helm, are going through a
strenuous week of training in preparation
for their big contest of the year. Reports
from California indicate that beyond a
doubt the Cubs are a strong aggregation.
The Bruins have plenty of weight; five
of their guards and tackles weigh over
200 pounds, and if it were not for Briggs,
at center, who weighs a mere 180, they
could have a center line weighing 200
pounds per man. Briggs makes up for
his lightness, if such it mak be called,
when it comes to playing on the defense.
Both Centers Good
Blocking kicks is his specialty, for he
has an uncanny ability to break through
the line and get in the way of the ball.
Bob Vermilya, Card center, and Briggs
are going to have a real battle Saturday
if both their records to date indicate any
thing. Booth, at end, and Briggs have
been the two most outstanding players on
the California line. Booth plays a smash
ing game and will do a lot of damage if
he is not held down.
California's backfield has so many stars
that everyone has picked his individual
favorite, and flipped a coin for the others.
Clymer is probably the best known man,
for he runs, passes, kicks, and calls sig
nals, and is proficient in all. He is closely
followed in the quarterback position by
Breckenridge, who is a faster and trick
ier runner, but does not have the triple
threat possessed by Clymer.
Zarley Fast Half
Zarley at halfback is a wonder at find
ing holes in the line, and gets through
them with plenty of speed. Dougery and
Cockburn, the former of Berkeley high
fame, and the latter from Pasadena high,
are fighting tooth and nail to be called
main string fullback, but have played
pretty much on a par all season.
Last night Artman, Husky Hunt's
weighty tackle, was taken from the field
with a badly twisted leg muscle, and it
is a matter of conjecture as to whether
he will be able to play Saturday. He is
the second man to be injured this week,
and if any more arc hurt things will look
pretty serious for the freshmen. Huls
man is getting along in fine shape and
may be fit for play, but Tandy has not
been able to do any work yet.

thing. Booth, at end, and Briggs have
been the two most outstanding players on
the California line. Booth plays a smash
ing game and will do a lot of damage if
he is not held down.
California's backfield has so many stars
that everyone has picked his individual
favorite, and flipped a coin for the others.
Clymer is probably the best known man,
for he runs, passes, kicks, and calls sig
nals, and is proficient in all. He is closely
followed in the quarterback position by
Breckenridge, who is a faster and trick
ier runner, but does not have the triple
threat possessed by Clymer.
Zarley Fast Half
Zarley at halfback is a wonder at find
ing holes in the line, and gets through
them with plenty of speed. Dougery and
Cockburn, the former of Berkeley high
fame, and the latter from Pasadena high,
are fighting tooth and nail to be called
main string fullback, but have played
pretty much on a par all season.
Last night Artman, Husky Hunt's
weighty tackle, was taken from the field
with a badly twisted leg muscle, and it
is a matter of conjecture as to whether
he will be able to play Saturday. He is
the second man to be injured this week,
and if any more arc hurt things will look
pretty serious for the freshmen. Huls
man is getting along in fine shape and
may be fit for play, but Tandy has not
been able to do any work yet.
Bob Sims of Long Beach lias been
elected captain of the 1929 freshman
football and will lead the Cardinals in
the California game Saturday. Siins is a
halfback, and has proven a valuable man
throughout the entire preliminary season.
Sims' athletic experience at Stanford
has gone beyond the gridiron, for by en
tering late last year he was eligible to
compete on the 1928 yearling baseball
and water polo teams.
Prepare for Cubs
The babes, with their newly-elected
captain at the helm, are going through a
strenuous week of training in preparation
for their big contest of the year. Reports
from California indicate that beyond a
doubt the Cubs are a strong aggregation.
The Bruins have plenty of weight; five
of their guards and tackles weigh over
200 pounds, and if it were not for Briggs,
at center, who weighs a mere 180, they
could have a center line weighing 200
pounds per man. Briggs makes up for
his lightness, if such it mak be called,
when it comes to playing on the defense.
Both Centers Good
Blocking kicks is his specialty, for he
has an uncanny ability to break through
the line and get in the way of the ball.
Bob Vermilya, Card center, and Briggs
are going to have a real battle Saturday
if both their records to date indicate any
thing. Booth, at end, and Briggs have
been the two most outstanding players on
the California line. Booth plays a smash
ing game and will do a lot of damage if
he is not held down.
