# ENCINA EATING HALLS WILL FIGHT BREAKAGE LOSS WITH CAMPAIGN
## 
### 
A campaign to educate freshmen
against loss by breakage and removal
in Encina Commons was authorized at
a meeting of that organization last
night. Last year about $4200 was spent
to replace tablewear which had been
broken or taken from the dining halls.
Forceful measures will be enacted this
year to prevent such a loss.
Lunch will be served at 11:30 o'clock
on the day of the Big Game, Saturday,
November 21, the Board decided, so
that everyone may be in the stadium
by 1 o'clock. The following committees
were appointed by Donald G. Adams,
president of the Board: finance, M.
Bruce Richardson, chairman; Max
Winter, Victor E. Walker; menu, John
C. Duniway, chairman, John B. Rogers,
Jr., Peter J. Crosby.
