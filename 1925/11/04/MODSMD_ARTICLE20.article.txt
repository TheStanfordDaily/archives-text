### Wilbur Adams 
A squad composed of twenty-five
Stanford football men leaves Oakland
tonight on the Shasta Limited for
Seattle. The players are scheduled to
arrive in the northern city Friday
morning, and practice will be held on
the University of Washington sand
field that afternoon.
The players that will make the
northern trip are: Captain Ernie Nev
ers, Dick Hyland. Bob Hunt, Ward
Poulson, Fred Price, Fred Swan, Mike
Murphy, Stuart Van Hook, Don Hill.
Dynamite Post, Tiny Raffetto, Fred
Solomon, Ted Shipkey, Harold Me-
Creery, Link Moore, Muggs Mitchell.
George Bogue, Tex Middleton, Ed
Walker, Leo Harris, Nick Kirwan, Mer
rill Armour, Ernie Patchett, Cris Free
man, and Art Greisser.
There were rumors around San Fran
cisco that Nevers, Poulson, and Hy
land were on the sick list, and that
they might not even make the trip to
Washington. The rumor was unfound
ed, and the three men will all be used
in the game against the Huskies.
Nevers and Poulson have been suffer
ing from slight colds since Saturday
and were not out for practice yester
day or Monday, but they were on the
field again this afternoon for a light,
signal practice. Hyland missed the
workout yesterday merely to rest a
sore muscle.
The same eleven that defeated U. S.
C. will undoubtedly start against
Washington Saturday. This team con
sists of Shipkey and Walker at ends,
Poulson and Harris at tackles. Armour
and Swan at guards, McCreery at cen
ter, Bogue and Murphy at halfbacks,
Mitchell at quarterback, and Nevers at
fullback. Although this team is offi
cially known as the first eleven, its
members have not played together
since the memorable day at Los An
geles almost three weeks ago. Even
with the first string players out of the
game, Stanford was able to defeat the
Oregon Aggies and Oregon University
in the last two weeks.
Saturday's battle against the Wash
ington Huskies is the last conference
contest for the Cards before the Big
Game with California on November 21.
University of California, Southern
Branch, will form the competition for
the varsity on the week-end before the
tussle with the Bears. The Washington
game will almost decide whether Stan
ford will top the Pacific Coast Confer
ence this year.

C. will undoubtedly start against
Washington Saturday. This team con
sists of Shipkey and Walker at ends,
Poulson and Harris at tackles. Armour
and Swan at guards, McCreery at cen
ter, Bogue and Murphy at halfbacks,
Mitchell at quarterback, and Nevers at
fullback. Although this team is offi
cially known as the first eleven, its
members have not played together
since the memorable day at Los An
geles almost three weeks ago. Even
with the first string players out of the
game, Stanford was able to defeat the
Oregon Aggies and Oregon University
in the last two weeks.
Saturday's battle against the Wash
ington Huskies is the last conference
contest for the Cards before the Big
Game with California on November 21.
University of California, Southern
Branch, will form the competition for
the varsity on the week-end before the
tussle with the Bears. The Washington
game will almost decide whether Stan
ford will top the Pacific Coast Confer
ence this year.
A squad composed of twenty-five

The players that will make the
northern trip are: Captain Ernie Nev
ers, Dick Hyland. Bob Hunt, Ward
Poulson, Fred Price, Fred Swan, Mike
Murphy, Stuart Van Hook, Don Hill.
Dynamite Post, Tiny Raffetto, Fred
Solomon, Ted Shipkey, Harold Me-
Creery, Link Moore, Muggs Mitchell.
George Bogue, Tex Middleton, Ed
Walker, Leo Harris, Nick Kirwan, Mer
rill Armour, Ernie Patchett, Cris Free
man, and Art Greisser.
There were rumors around San Fran
cisco that Nevers, Poulson, and Hy
land were on the sick list, and that
they might not even make the trip to
Washington. The rumor was unfound
ed, and the three men will all be used
in the game against the Huskies.
Nevers and Poulson have been suffer
ing from slight colds since Saturday
and were not out for practice yester
day or Monday, but they were on the
field again this afternoon for a light,
signal practice. Hyland missed the
workout yesterday merely to rest a
sore muscle.
