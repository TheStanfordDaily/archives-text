Professor Frank G. Dickinson of Illinois has suggested that at the close
of the 1925 football season a spot in the Illinois trophy case be set aside
for the keeping of an Illinois football jersey with the number "77" on its
back—the sweater worn by "Red" Grange for three years and one which
has crossed opponents' goal lines thirty times.
This seems to us to l>e a splendid tribute to Grange and an admirable
way to preserve his name officially in the Illinois archives of football, io
day Grange is recognized as the greatest halfback that ever lived, surpass
ing even Heston, Thorpe, and Mahan. It may be ten years, it may be fifty
years, before there is another man in football who possesses such marvel
ous ability in advancing the ball. To preserve his numbered jersey is a
fitting tribute to his wizardy.
Stanford has a somewhat similar care. Ernie Nevers is earning for
himself the reputation of being the greatest all-around athlete in the coun
try. Wouldn't it be a splendid recognition of his efforts to place his
sweater, together with his record while at Stanford in the trophy room?
And then, if the number "1" was never assigned again his work would
become traditional and would never be forgotten.
And, a tradition being formed, in the future Stanford football players
who made the first Ail-American team should have their sweaters pre
served in the trophy case, and the number they wore during that year
should be held sacred and should never be worn again by another Stanford
man.
