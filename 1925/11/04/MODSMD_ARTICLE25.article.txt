# College VS. Health
## 
### 
Thirteen per cent of the students registered at Stanford last year were
entirely self-supporting. This means that these people wer doing two
days' work in one—earning a living and carrying a heavy college course.
The results of this heavy activity have proved disastrous in many
cases. Grades have suffered; health has suffered; and four per cent of
the self-supporting students were forced to leave the institution before
the end of the year.
Considering the end, and the means he must use to attain it, the stu
dent is put to a supreme test of judgment. If he is to work his way
ihrough school he must plan every moment of his time with great pre
cision. He must sacrifice rest and recreation to a steady grind of books
and jobs. If he has not planned well, he will be physically exhausted and
perhaps incapacitated when he completes his college course. Then his
four years of work will have been in vain.
Students who must work their way through college should not enter
until they have enough money ahead to pay part of the expenses. This
will enable them to participate in the social and athletic college activities
which are so essential in becoming well-balanced and in keeping a good
health.
Students who do not have to work their way through college can be of
assistance to those who do by giving the self-supporting students a chance
,to get the good jobs, instead of snapping them all up when they are not
essential to their staying in the University.
