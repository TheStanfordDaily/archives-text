# World Fellowship

### 
"World Fellowship" was the theme of the banquet given by the Y.YV.
C.A. last night at the Union. Few students even consider the possibility
of World Fellowship, or the fact that it can be started through campus
fellowship. Stanford is not alone in this thoughtlessness.
Roughly speaking there are four groups of students, namely, those who
have no world outlook, those who have some interest in world affairs,
those whose interest is vital and who are trying to find their relation to
world problems, and those who, having decided what that relation is, de
sire preparation for specific forms of life service. In all of these classifi
cations it is necessary that consciousness of membership in a world society
be considered.
Universities and colleges are alike, and other places than Stanford
show the need for some realization of the duties we should accept in later
life. Let's take note of world problems.
