# Speed Wagons and Fires

Monday morning the scream of the Power house fire whistle startled
the campus and an enterprising Daily Palo Alto reporter hopped into
his car and started in quest of the fire. Arriving at the Fire Department
he was forced to wait some four minutes for the small chemical engine to
get on its way. The Daily car shifted into high and started in pursuitâ€”
hut it was forced to clamp on its brakes to prevent smashing into the rear
of the fire truck.
After trailing along for about a mile at 25 miles an hour the caravan
arrived at the conflagration. It was only a small grass and rubbish fire
and was easily extinguished. Hut this state of facts has caused the Daily
to wonder. What would happen if a fire of any size broke out on the cam
pus and the Fire Department took the same leisurely methods in reaching
it?
