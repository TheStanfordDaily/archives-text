Towel to His Royal Rushin
Majesty)
Dear Slopsky:
I am a freshman and I have consid
erable difficulty in being collegiate be
cause I can not make my socks stay
up without the proper means of sup
port. What would you suggest?
—Just Green.
Dear Pink:
If you wear the same pair of socks
for several weeks without garters they
will finally become weaned.
Hopefully, —Slopsky.
Dear Slopsky:
What is the best way to break a
heavy date? —Disappointed.
Dear Disap:
A heavy date is very difficult to
break. We would advise that you try
a hatchet, but be sure to hew to the
line, and let the chips fall where they
lay. The stars and stripes forever,
—Slopsky.
Dear Slopsky:
I am an amateur at bridge, but the
other day I was playing with three
professionals, when much to my sur
prise I found that I had one card too
many. What is the correct thing to do
under the circumstances.
—Perplexed.
Dear Solar Plexus:
When you are an amateur at bridge,
it is always best to have two cookies
or pieces of cake in readiness so that,
when you find you have too many
cards, you can place the extra card
between the cookies or cake and eat
it with much relish. More power to
you, —Slopsky.
Dear Slopsky:
I had a heavy date for a dance the
other night but when I got to the
dance I found that I had forgotten both
the ticket and the program. The lady
suggested that we go for a ride instead
of dancing, but I insisted upon going
back to the house and getting the
ticket, whereupon my heavy date be
came very light. What was the mat
ter? —A Senior.
Dear Frosh:
You have my heartfelt sympathy.
The next time be sure not to forget
your ticket.
Yours for a Higher Education,
—Slopsky.
* * *
For those who are ashamed of their
bawl-out records it might be helpful
to suggest that a short vertical line
drawn in a certain place on the bawl
out proofs would improve the looks
of things immensely.
* * ♦
We suggest that men who have trou
ble finding rooters' caps to fit them
try some sort of a shrinking solution
on their heads.
* * *
We have given up all hope of ever
seeing a Stanford rooting section in
"action."
* * *
Freshmen are warned that rooters'
caps must not be worn to church.

Towel to His Royal Rushin
Majesty)
Dear Slopsky:
I am a freshman and I have consid
erable difficulty in being collegiate be
cause I can not make my socks stay
up without the proper means of sup
port. What would you suggest?
—Just Green.
Dear Pink:
If you wear the same pair of socks
for several weeks without garters they
will finally become weaned.
Hopefully, —Slopsky.
Dear Slopsky:
What is the best way to break a
heavy date? —Disappointed.
Dear Disap:
A heavy date is very difficult to
break. We would advise that you try
a hatchet, but be sure to hew to the
line, and let the chips fall where they
lay. The stars and stripes forever,
—Slopsky.
Dear Slopsky:
I am an amateur at bridge, but the
other day I was playing with three
professionals, when much to my sur
prise I found that I had one card too
many. What is the correct thing to do
under the circumstances.
—Perplexed.
Dear Solar Plexus:
When you are an amateur at bridge,
it is always best to have two cookies
or pieces of cake in readiness so that,
when you find you have too many
cards, you can place the extra card
between the cookies or cake and eat
it with much relish. More power to
you, —Slopsky.
Dear Slopsky:
I had a heavy date for a dance the
other night but when I got to the
dance I found that I had forgotten both
the ticket and the program. The lady
suggested that we go for a ride instead
of dancing, but I insisted upon going
back to the house and getting the
ticket, whereupon my heavy date be
came very light. What was the mat
ter? —A Senior.
Dear Frosh:
You have my heartfelt sympathy.
The next time be sure not to forget
your ticket.
Yours for a Higher Education,
—Slopsky.

For those who are ashamed of their
bawl-out records it might be helpful
to suggest that a short vertical line
drawn in a certain place on the bawl
out proofs would improve the looks
of things immensely.

We suggest that men who have trou
ble finding rooters' caps to fit them
try some sort of a shrinking solution
on their heads.

We have given up all hope of ever
seeing a Stanford rooting section in
