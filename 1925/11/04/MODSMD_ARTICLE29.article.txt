A meeting of the Junior women was
held today for the purpose of adopting
a class hat. After much discussion it
was decided to have a distinctive hat,
the choice being left to a committee
of five, who will secure samples, which
will be submitted to the class for ap
proval.

The last preliminary game of the
season will be played at Stanford to
morrow afternoon when the varsity
will meet the University of Southern
California team. The varsity has had a
week of secret practice since the con
test with the Sherman Indians, and it
is anticipated that the showing tomor
row will give some indication of what
the coaches have in store for the game
with the University of California.

Editorial —The persistent failure of
'certain students to obey the coaches'
request to keep out of the Encina
windows during secret football prac
tice is distinctly humiliating, for we
have but recently been congratulated
on our comparative freedom from
muckers and inuckerism. This latest
outburst of the evil does much to upset
the complacency of the University.
Hereafter, the name of any man caught
watching secret practice from the win
dows of Encina Hall or through the
cracks of the fence surrounding the
oval will be published in the Daily Palo
Alto.

Members of the victorious freshman
football team have decided to dispose
of the ball won in the game by a new
method. As the team played without, a
captain, the ball will be cut into pieces
and distributed among the members of
the team to be made into watch fobs
as souvenirs of their victory.

Freshmen at Brown University are
forbidden to wear knickerbockers,
smoke on the campus, or wear unbut
toned galoshes.
