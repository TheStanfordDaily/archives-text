The Harper Prize Short Stories
The House of Harper has published
a book of the twelve prize-winning
short stories in a contest recently
conducted by Harper's Magazine, en
titled "The Harper Prize Short
Stories."
It is an excellent volume and con
tains twelve stories of unquestionable
merit. Some of the authors are new,
others have long been contributors to
the current magazines, but each of the
dozen stories is presented in a unique
and novel manner. Each of the stories
has a genuine claim to distinction, de
spite the possible criticism that they
are all primarily "magazine stories"
and chosen to a large extent because
of their popular appeal.
The history of the contest for which
the stories were written is interesting.
The original plan was to hold a con
test in which actual quality would be
the criterion of success. Nearly 10,500
manuscripts were entered in the four
competitions. A fund of $10,000 was set
aside for prizes, and three prominent
literary critics were selected as
judges. The contest proved not only a
splendid scheme for advertising the
House of Harper, but also produced
new writers and several excellent
stories. â€”K. D.
