Ted Elias, Jr.-

Committee holds a meeting,
And discusses "S" awards,
Also moves to fix piano,
For the Student Body bards.
John McNab of San Francisco,
Widely known throughout the state,
Gives Euphronia a talk
On goodness and the Legislate.
Ernie Nevers, Stanford captain,
From San Quentin gets some mail,
"Give us Liberty and football"
Is the loud continued wail.
Freshman captain is elected,
Robert Sims receives the honor,
Little Big Game holds attention,
Berkeley's freshman team's a goner.
Stunts requested by committee,
For the California brawl,
Bears that travel over mountains,
Are the ones we must appall.
