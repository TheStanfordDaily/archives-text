ambulance service was taken over, and
the Stanford unit was disbanded.

occupation of Alsace Lorraine. Here
he reported on the battles of Metz and
Strassbourg. Taylor's next transfer

Finland. He was given five American
doughboy prisoners, which the Rus
sian officials had tired of keeping, to
take with him. The Finns threw him

Joins Ambulance Unit
In 1917, before America herself had
entered the war, American colleges
established ambulance units in Prance.
One was formed by a group of Stan
ford journalists, called the Second
Stanford Unit. Taylor enlisted and
went to Europe. His unit was sent to
the Balkans to aid the French there.
When America entered the war the
ambulance service was taken over, and
the Stanford unit was disbanded.
Taylor next became a war corre
spondent for the United Press. He
was first with the American army,
where he reported along the battle
fronts of Chateau Thierry, San Mihiel,
and the Argonne. He was then trans
ferred to the French army during the
occupation of Alsace Lorraine. Here
he reported on the battles of Metz and
Strassbourg. Taylor's next transfer
was into Germany. As he could not
enter that country by way of France,
he had to go through Switzerland. He
was the last correspondent to get in,
as Germany closed that frontier soon
after he had entered.

after the signing of the armistice, and
the establishment of the republic. H<>

1919 he went to Russia and was
promptly arrested as an alien enemy.
He was taken to Moscow, where they
let him write four or five stories. Tay
lor saw the stories after they were
published and they were not at all as
he had written them, the government
having used them as a basis for its
own propaganda.
Jailed in Finland
Taylor was finally taken to Petro
grad and sent out to Russia into
Finland. He was given five American
doughboy prisoners, which the Rus
sian officials had tired of keeping, to
take with him. The Finns threw him
and the five other men into jail. He
■was not daunted by this and managed
to escape by climbing over a fence.
