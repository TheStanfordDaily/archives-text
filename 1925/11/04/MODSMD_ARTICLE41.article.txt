# ORIENTAL, WESTERN VIEWS ON RELATION OF NATIONS GIVEN
## 
### 
Oriental and Occidental points of view
on international relations were presented
by Professor Yamato Ichihashi of the
History department and Professor Gra
ham H. Stuart of the Political Science
department at the "World Fellowship"
banquet of the Y. W. C. A. held in the
Union last night.
"Race prejudice is the greatest obstacle
to international co-operation," said Pro
fessor Ichihashi. "It is an indefinite
thing: it may be cultural, it may be re
ligious, it may be just skin-deep, but it
exists, and it stands in the way of world
peace. Mutual understanding is the so
lution to the problem. Understanding,
gained through knowledge, shows that all
people are just human, with no more
faults than ourselves, and that they are
to be trusted just as far as we are."
Professor Stuart said, "The United
States seems to think that she can still
maintain a policy of splendid isolation
from Europe," referring to the Pan-
American Union, whose headquarters are
at Washington, D.C. He quoted a foreign
diplomat as saying, "If we only had had
such an organization in Europe, center
ing at Petrograd, Berlin, London, or
Paris, we might have averted the World
War."
Sonya Otani, brother-in-law of the
Emperor of Japan, also spoke. He de
clared that he intends to establish a better
system of education for women in Japan.
Foreign students from the University
of California were guests of the Y. W.
C. A. at the banquet, and wore their na
tive costumes.
