"Use of new inventions such as the

has materially increased the transmis
sion range of telephones," F. A. Rose,
of the American Telephone & Tele
graph Company, told members of the
Stanford branch of the American In
stitute of Electrical Engineers last
night. The topic of his illustrated lec
ture was, "Developments in Telephone
Transmission and Operation."
Rose declared that telephone mes
sages may now be sent from Catalina
Island to Key West, Florida, by way
of San Francisco and New York. Sev
eral different conversations may be
