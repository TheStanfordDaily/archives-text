# SOCCER SQUAD TO TRY FOR COMEBACK IN BRUIN CONTESTS
## 
### 
Although practically out of the run
ning in tho University and Club
League this season, the Stanford var
sity soccer team still figures to make
a strong comeback in the California
series by defeating the Bear team,
which at present is leading the league.
The first game of the California
series will be played at Berkeley No
vember 14. If Stanford wins but one
game of the series, the Cards will gain
permanent possession of the soccer
trophy, since they already have a de
cided edge in victories.
The Stanford team is strong on of
fense, but has been scored on by al
most every team played. Schoen and
Miron. wings, are especially fast and
are good at centering the ball. The
entire forward line is fast, but small.
Jack Franklin, captain of the team,
has been changed from right half to
center half this year, and is showing
up well in the new position. The other
two halves cover their men well.
The team has been weakened by the
loss of five men by graduation from
last year's team, and although the
new men are learning rapidly, they
are still green. Coach Don Clark, who
is in charge of the team in the ab
sence of Harry Maloney, is working
hard, and the team is improving with
every game.
The freshman team is not very
strong this year. They have been
beaten in every game played, and to
date have been unable to score a goal.
The men are all inexperienced. They
were defeated yesterday afternoon by
th Half Moon Bay high school by a
score of 6 to 0.
