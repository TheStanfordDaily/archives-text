# "GOOSE HANGS HIGH" AUTHOR HAILED AS POPULAR WRITER
## Beach's Study of College Life Considered His Best Production 
### Aisle-Seater 
Lewis Beach, author of "The Goose
Hangs High," has been generally ac
claimed as one of the most popular play
wrights of the new school of American
dramatists. Among other notable plays,
Beach has written "The Clod," a one-act
play, which is considered one of his best.
"The Square Peg," another of Beach's
plays, was a New York success two sea
sons ago.
"The Goose Hangs High" is usually
conceded to be Beach's best work. It was
. first produced about a year and a half
ago in New York, and starred Norman
Trevor, the well-known English actor,
Katherine Grey, and Mrs. Thomas Whif
fen. It ran for a full year to capacity
houses at the new Bijou Theatre in New
York Gty. After the close of the New
York run, the play toured the Pacific
Coast and then the rest of the country. A
production of "The Goose Hangs High"
is now being given at the Alcazar Thea
tre in San Francisco by the Henry Duffy
Players. Duffy offered to lend his pro
fessional manuscript to Gordon Davis
for the use of the production at Stanford.
"The Goose Hangs High" has been
called "a comedy drama of American
life" by its author,. The general theme of
play gives an interesting study of college
life and its effects on the younger gen
eration in relation to their outlook on
life. It also illustrates the difference in
the points of view of three generations
through the contact of the grandmother,
the parents, and the three children of one
family.
Another thread of the story, which in
cludes the mischance of the father of the
family in the political organization of
his city, heavily indicts modern Ameri
can municipal politics. However the play
is in no sense a sermon nor propaganda,
hut an amusing and absorbing comedy of
American life with a deeper thought
behind it than in many of our recent
modern domestic comedies. One of the
New York reviewers has said of "The
Goose Hangs High" that it is a play
which every American college student
should see.
The first dress rehearsal of the play
will be held at the Assembly hall this
evening. Although most of the cast is
inexperienced, Gordon Davis has ex
pressed himself as being greatly pleased
at the progress made. The production
is being made under the auspices of
Sword and Sandals, men's dramatic so
ciety.
