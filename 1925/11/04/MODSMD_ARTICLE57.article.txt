## 
### Herbert Klein 
Works of French composers will oc
! cupy a prominent place on the pro
gram of the organ recital to be given
by Warren D. Allen in the Memorial
! Church tomorrow afternoon at 4:15
o'clock.
The famous "Meditation" from the
opera "Thais" by Jules Massenet,
! leading French writer of operas, will
be played. The "Meditation" has be
come very popular because of its sim
ple melody and quiet, introspective
nature. "Pastorale in E" is by Cesar
Franck, the French-Belgian musician
who became the leader and pioneer of
! modern French music. Franck's com
j positions are noble and lofty in feeling
and filled with a spirit of faith and
earnestness. He was an innovator in
harmony and left many works for vari
ous instruments. The organ was his
greatest interest, for he was an organ
player of note, and as a composer for
this instrument he can be ranked with
such masters as John Sebastian Bach.
Bach is represented on the program
by his Chorale Postlude, "We All Be
lieve in One God." As the great musi
cian, not only of liis age, but of the
Protestant Reformation in Germany,
Bach used many hymn tunes as the
basis for great organ works such a3
Festival Preludes, Chorale Preludes,
and Chorale Postludes. He himself had
simple and deep deligious convictions,
the spirit of which are fully expressed
in his music. The present number is in
the fugal form with many melodies
interwoven and heard together, form
ing one musical structure. This piece
is one of the finest expressions of
sturdy, unquestioning faith to be found
in music.
The concert will be closed with two
selections from Rossete.r G. Cole, a
contemporary composer who has writ
ten much excellent music for the or
gan, most of it characterized by its
vigor and vitality.
Next Tuesday Allen will give a con
cert devoted entirely to the composi
tions of Richard Wagner, greatest and
most revolutionary figure in German
opera.
