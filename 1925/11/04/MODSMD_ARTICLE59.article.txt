Straw-balloting at Wellesley and
Radcliffe shows the trend of modem
feminism; namely, indulgence in chew
ing and smoking. Wellesley women
maintain that the big leaguers chew
gum, and moreover that gum is good
for the "figger;" consequently gum is
used. Radcliffe, on the other hand, says
that gum is a sticky, obnoxious sub
stance, the use of which is vulgar; so
they use cigarettes.
