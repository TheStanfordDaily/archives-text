# MATRIMONIAL SCHOOL ADDED
## 
### 
A course in matrimony has recently
been added to the curriculum of Bos
ton University. Not satisfied with the
ordinary domestic science course,
Dean Davis of that institution has
started a course which he hopes will
turn out a finished and high-crass pro<l
uct in the way of wives.
