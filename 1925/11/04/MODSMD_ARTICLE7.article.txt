# San Quentin Wants Pigskin Football Lacking in Prison Nevers Gets Convict's Plea
## 
### 
The new red and white striped
socks of the varsity squad must
have aroused a telepathic feeling
of brotherhood in the heart of one
of San Quentin's inmates, judging
from a letter received by Ernie I
Nevers yesterday from a convict
football enthusiast, asking for a
"suitable" football.
. It seems that the "house-broth
ers" of the Breaka Pila Rock fra
ternity at San Quentin are trying
to organize a football team. Need
less to say, they have the men
where they can get at them, but no
ball has yet been obtained. Hence
the unusual request.
The letter was "addressed to Mr.
Ernie Nevers, care Stanford Uni
versity, and contained "an earnest
appeal ... to send" a ball "so that
we can enjoy a good game here." It
closed by "wishing you success in
all the coming games and that Stan
ford may win the conference." Cap
tain Nevers will probably send the
ball.
