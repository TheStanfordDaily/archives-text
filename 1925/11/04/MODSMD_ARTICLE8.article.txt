# PEACE OF NATIONS RESTS ON RELIGIOUS EDUCATION---OTANI
## Study of Foreigners' Beliefs Fosters Friendliness, Says Speaker 
### 
"There is a dawn of a new era, and
i with it comes the meeting of the two
j cultures, the oriental and the Occident
i al. The destinies of the countries rest
• upon the men and women who are to
j day in the institutions of higher learn
; ing," said the Honorable Sonyu Otani
j in his lecture last evening. He believes
i that the study of foreign religions is
! the best way to assure international
I amicable relations.
"Understanding Buddhism is under
i standing the Orientals and their civili
j zation. Buddhism is the basis of
| Japanese policies, morals, and spiritu
ality. It originated over 3000 years ago
,in India. Since that time it has changed
i greatly; every country has interpreted
; it to its own satisfaction.
"Nirvana is the ultimate perfection,
j the height of all hopes. It is divided ir
| Hinawana, whose followers are prin
| cipally in the southern part of Asia,
| and Mohayana, with followers mostly
| in the northern part. The first is con
: sidered the lesser vehicle and the sec
| ond, the greater.
"The interpretation of the former is
I a realm where there are no evil
thoughts of passions, where there is
| complete extinction of ego, and where
there is a constant and increasing
struggle upwards toward their ultimate;
| end. It has been criticized in that it is
i a negative religion. This is not abso
| lutely true but it is truer of the
lesser vehicle than of the greater. The
latter is not only the complete extinc
, tion of self but the extinction of self
| with the fact in view that it means
i the ultimate salvation of mankind. The
j climax of the religion is Buddha, a
symbol of the never-ending succession
of the finer points of life.
"Here lies the purification and salva
tion of the individual and all men.
I
j Equality is another keynote to Budd
hism. All beings, rich and poor, great
i and humble, alike, are endowed with
| the nature and possibility of eventu-
S ally becoming Buddha. Buddha and
i all men are one. In this interpretation
there is no denial of ego; it is the
i theory of a greater ego where all indi
j viduals are interdependent on one an
! other and on society in general, thus
; abolishing individual ego. Social, as
I individual salvation is the cardinal
I principle of Mahayanism."
Many international movements and
principals are unconsciously based on
i these facts. This is particularly en
| couraging to the people of Japan.
| "Love, compasston, and complete an
j derstanding of all the universe is the
aim and result of Buddhism. Amicable
foreign relations are therefore the de
! sire of the Japanese," said Otani.
