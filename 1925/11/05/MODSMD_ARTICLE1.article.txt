## Bruin Babes Have Perfect Record; Cards to Enter With Light Eleven 
### Frank Baker 
Light practice this afternoon com
pleted freshman football preparations J
for the Little Big Game Saturday. The j
babes will be given a rest tomorrow j
in order to get them set for the final
fight of the season with the undefeated
California Cubs.
Cook has been playing left guard
this week, and the indications are that
he will replace Doyle in that position.
Doyle has been considerably slowed up
the last two weeks on account of a
twisted ankle, and Coach Hunt feels
that speed will be needed to stop the
Bears. This change takes off another
fifty pounds from the line and means
that the game will start with Califor
nia having an advantage of nearly
-twenty pounds to the man, in the cen
ter of the line. Tandy was on the field
today to take a few of the kinks out
ot his muscles, but* could do no strenu
ous work. He may be put in the game
Saturday for a few minutes, but will
not be able to play long.
Both California and Stanford fresh
men defeated the Army team from the
Presidio; the Bears scored 10' to 0,
while the Cards beat the soldiers the
following week 14 to 0. San Mateo was
<on the bottom of a 26 to 10 score in
the first game of the Bears' season,
and was walloped the next Saturday
25 to 0 by Stanford. In total points
scored the Cubs have the best of the
Redshirts; they have made 151 points
to their opponents' 16, whereas the
Card yearlings have run up only 103
points to their opponents' 22.
After California defeated San Matoo
and the Army, it vanquished the San
Diego Marines 20 to 0. The following
week the yearlings had their hardest
game when they were held to a 7 to
6 win by the Bear reserves. Two weeks
ago they had a set-up against the Cali
fornia Aggie reserves and scored G1
points to the Aggies' 0, while last week
they beat the St. Ignatius reserves 27
to 0, even after the goofs had been
reinforced with members of the regular
team.
