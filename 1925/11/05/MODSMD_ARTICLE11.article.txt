# RELAY WILL DECIDE WINNER OF F. A. A. SWIM CHAMPIONSHIP
## Stanford Enters Team in Final Events of Year's Competition 
### 
Stanford will stake most of its hopes
on the relay team to win the year's final
P. A. A. swimming meet to be held at the
Athens Club of Oakland tomorrow night.
The P. A. A. 400-yard relay will give
ten counts for first place, and these
Brandsten will make every effort to clinch
in order to maintain the present lead
over the Olympic club in the year's P. A.
A. events. Six relay teams are now en
tered, one of them from the University
of California, but the only four expected
|to give much competition is the fast
! Olympic Club outfit.
I Tryouts for places on the relay were
j held yesterday afternoon at Encina Pool.
| Bob Williams repeated his victory in the
| 50-yard tryouts by taking first in 59:1.
i The relay will probably be composed of
J Arden Allen, Bob Williams, and Carl
j Stevenson, with the choice for fourth
j man lying between Colin Smith and Phil
j Brooks. Smith's eligibility is still liang
-1 ing fire and until it is finally settled the
i fourth man will be in doubt.
More than seventy swimmers have sig
i nified their intention of competing tomor
row, and heats will have to be run off
I in the 50 yards and possibly in others of
| the four swimming events. Bob Williams,
; Bill Danfqfd, and Doug Ackerman will
| swim the fifty for Stanford. Entrants in
| the hundred are not fixed, but will prob
| ably be Brooks and Danford. Arden
â–  Allen looks good for a first in the 150-
j yard backstroke. Dave Fall is the only
j Cardinal diver entered and if A1 White
| does not compete he should take first.
