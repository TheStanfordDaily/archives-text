dais play, to be given under the direc- j
tion of Gordon Davis in the Assembly j
hall tomorrow night at 8:15, will be j
completed at the dress rehearsal to-1
night.
The opening situation of the play !
is in the Ingalls home, where the fam
ily are expectantly awaiting the ar-!
rival of the children for the Christmas j
holidays. The twins burst In first, and '
their story as to how they "promoted" |
transportation causes merriment, and !
adds to the collegiate atmosphere, j
Hugh, the elder son, who was expected !
to miss Christmas at home for the i
first time, surprises everyone by ar-!
riving at the last moment, making the
family group complete.
Vail Sends Manuscript
Since "The Goose Hangs High" is
being produced professionally by so j
many companies, it is extremely dif- j
ficult for amateurs to obtain a manu
script. Stanford was fortunate in hav-J
ing the offer of the one used by Henry ;
Duffy, of the Alcazar Theatre, and
also of one by Lester Vail, former J
Stanford student who played the part I
of Bradley Ingalls with the Bonnestelle j
company in Detroit. The latter was!
accepted.
When Vail learned of the predica
ment that Stanford was in he bought
an ordinary published version of the
manuscript, and by means of his own
knowledge, and a conference with the
manager of a stock company in New
London, Connecticut, he altered it,
and sent by air mail the working
script used by Gordon Davis for to
morrow's production.
