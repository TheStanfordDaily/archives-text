# CROSS-COUNTRY RUN AGAINST BRUINS SET FOR NOVEMBER 21
## 
### 
Date for the California-Stanford
cross-country run has been definitely
j set for November 1, the day of the Big
Game. The run will be held over the
Stanford course, starting at 10 o'clock.
The run will be held over a course
varying slightly from that used here
previously, according to present plans.
In former years the run has begun and
! ended at the stadium track, making
I the grind six miles long. This distance
| will be cut down a mile if it is decided
(o have the event begin and end at the
| Phi Delta Theta house for the Califor
nia run.
Ten men are now working out regu
larly with Captain Bill Kerr, and the
prospects for (he team are brighter
than for several years, according to
Kerr. Tho Cards have won the meet
for the past four years, and are ex
pected to repeat this season.
Although most of last year's men
were lost by graduation, the squad has
been strengthened by tho addition of
four distance men from the freshmen,
Nelson, Ranoy, Smith, and Collins, all
of whom are showing up well.
Efforts are being made to secure
competition for practice runs, and the
Olympic Club and the Humboldt Ath
letic Club may meet the Cards here
before the California run. There is
also a possibility that the Sherman
Indians will meet the Stanford team
here within the next two weeks.
