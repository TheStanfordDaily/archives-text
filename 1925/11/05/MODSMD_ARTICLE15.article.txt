progress of the Washington con

halves and at the close of the
California-Stanford freshman game
Saturday.

Washington University has been pre
paring for the contest with Stanford
since the Saturday that the Huskies
played the 6-6 tie with Nebraska. Even
before Washington State had been dis
posed of, Coach Bagshaw had given
his men plays to be used solely in the
Stanford game. Defensive work has
been administered in an attempt to
stop Pop Warner's offense.
Elmer Tesreau, captain of the North
erners, has been spending this week
on the bench as a result of an injury
received in the game with the Cougars
last Saturday. Louis Tesreau has been
used in his brother's position at full
back since Monday. The captain will
probably be in the lineup against Stan
ford Saturday.
George Wilson is considered the star
of the Washington team. In the gaino
with Nebraska, Wilson was proclaimed
as the greatest halfback in the country
by the Nebraska papers. Last Saturday
he got away for a thirty-five yard run
that resulted in a touchdown on the
following play. A few minutes after
this play he intercepted a forward
pass on his own 10-yard line and ran
ninety yards to the second touchdown.
Along with Tesreau and Wilson, Bag
shaw has a clever end in Cutting and
an accurate place-kicker in Gluttorm
sen, the quarterback. Cutting shared
honors with Wilson in the Nebraska,
contest. Last Saturday he again
showed to advantage on the defense,
and besides, caught a short pass over
the goal line for the Huskies' final
touchdown over the Cougars. Gluttorm-
I sen kicked a field goal from his 32-
yard line in last week-end's game.
Erickson and Herman Brix have
been working at tackles during the*
hard scrimmages that have been given
to the Washington squad this week.
Egbert Brix and Wright are in the
lineup at guards, while Bonamy has
been at the pivot job this week. Bon
amy was kept on the bench during the
whole of the Washington State battle.
