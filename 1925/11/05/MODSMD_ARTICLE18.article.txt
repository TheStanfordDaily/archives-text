# "The 'Downtown' Critics"
## 
### 
Pacific Coast university football coaches have long been troubled by
vehement alumni who are obnoxious in their criticism of the team, the
university, and the coach when a regular winner is not provided. The
Big Ten Weekly has declared this panning of coachcs a growing menace
to the success of football. Stating that the nuisance is most noticeable
in big cities where large numbers of alumni are in close touch with the
football situation, it continues:
"In Columbus there were alumni who were blind to all that Dr. Wilce
had done for Ohio State. The minute he experienced a couple of dis
astrous seasons this clique started to pound the anvil. At Minnesota the
same thing happened. Minneapolis alumni went after Bill Spaulding's
scalp. A big element of Harvard alumni in Boston have tried to oust
Dr. Fisher as coach of the Crimson.
"Various Pennsylvania coaches in the past have found it hard to please
Philadelphia alumni. Perhaps a case as difficult to understand as any
is the growing dissatisfaction with the style of football played by the
Chicago team among what Bill Morgenstern has named the "La Salle
Street coaching staff." That Chicago has lost only two Big Ten games
in the last four and a half seasons—the best record for consistency in
modern times in the Conference —seems to make little difference. There
are many shortsighted Chicago alumni who are crying for a change in
style of game that has been highly successful to one that has happened
to win a sensational game for some other coach.
"Such conditions as these at Harvard, Minnesota, Ohio State, Penn
sylvania, and Chicago have done football no good, nor have they in any
way helped to benefit conditions, if there has ever bceij anything actually
wrong at these institutions. There seems to be no way to curb this
'downtown' antagonism, unless those alumni who really understand the
conditions are to band together to support the coach, his ideals, and his
system. There is no coach, never was one, and never will be one who
can turn out winning teams every year. If such were the case, football
would lose one of its greatest appeals—its ups and downs from year to
year.
"The use of common sense in regard to victories and defeats seems to
be needed."
