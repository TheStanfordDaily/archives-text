# Spirit—Where Is It ?

### 
Every year the cry is heard with regularly increasing loudness —"What
has becomc of the Stanford spirit?"
"Pooh!" say the wise ones. "Red-blooded life and zealous spirit still
run as rampant as they did ten or fifteen years ago. The discontented
kick, because thcv have been here until the monotony of college existence
is wearing upon them."
Previously we have been numbered among the "poohers." This year,
however, we have investigated from every possible angle, and can come
to no other conclusion but that interest is rapidly slipping in Stanford
activities, and that the Cardinal spirit of historical fiction is on its last
legs.
We are at a loss for the reason. The football team is the most formi
dable one that has represented Stanford for a decade; the administration
of student affairs is efficient; plenty of diversion has been sched
uled. Yet, students will not don rooters' hats and sit in the rooting
section at grid games; no one will attend a rally unless he is given an
almost professional entertainment; freshmen walk up the law steps; and
nobody says "Hello gents."
What does the campus think? Is the college man becoming so sophisti
cated that he cares naught for anything but the blase? Is the uniformity
and commonplaceness of daily happenings sleep inducing? Are we over
legislated ?
The Daily Palo Alto will welcome communications regarding this
matter, and will publish all letters in its Campus Opinion department,
unsigned if desired.
Members of the Daily Palo Alto staff, together with all tryoutees, will be
expected to attend a meeting at 1:30 o'clock in the Daily office tomorrow.
Excuses for absence will not be accepted unless they are mdae before the
meeting.
The University of Missouri is building a new stadium with a 23,000 seating
capacity—expecting it to be ample for present needs. What a difference
between Missouri and California! In a very few more years stadiums of
100,000 capacity are going to be wholly inadequate to hold the crowds that
throng to witness a game of major importance in the Pacific Coast Conference
title race. The Stanford stadium, which holds more than three times as many
people as the new Middlewest stadium, is already insufficient for present needs.
A great football team and a fw thousands of studnts are not infallible
indicators of a college's quality.
