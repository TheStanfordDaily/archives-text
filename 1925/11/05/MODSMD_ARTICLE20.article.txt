FRUITS OF EXPERIENCE
Speaking of dates, it is often impos
sible to tell a lemon from au orange
until you squeeze it.
It. sounds impossible and very much
like a paradox to say that a peach is
sometimes a lemon, but it is one of
those sad but true facts.
Is there any connection between a
blind date and a potato that has had
its eyes gouged out?
# * *
We have found another reason to
lament the fact that it is no longer
necessary for freshmen to wear dinks.
With the present popularity of knick
ers, how are we going to tell whether
a person garbed in these foolish crea
tions is a freshman not yet out of
short pants or an upperclassman who
has reverted to second childhood?

The following polite notice which
appeared recently 011 the Encinu bul
letin board seems to have all of the
venom of the snake family hidden
under its outward smoothness: "If the
person who plays the radio at 12 p.m.
will call at room 414 he will learn
something for the benefit of the radio."
* * *
We derive great pleasure and a lit
tle more sleep (I hope) from this no
tice on the Encina board: "For sale —
one saxophone, cheap." Everything
would be fine if it were against the
law to sell musical instruments, uku
leles, and phonographs to anyone liv- j
ing at Encina hall. —C. W. !

Now that colleges own theatres, it
will be only a short time before they
will be operating road houses and
dance halls. This is a logical develop
ment of the age. Since students are
expected to support these activities, it
is only just that the University derive
the revenue.

Load her down for Sandy Beater,
The college champeen choc malt eater.
Something for nothing runs his story—
And so he patronizes Morey.
He strives to gain Ambition's peak
By eating twelve choc malts a week.
For with the premiums these bring him
He gets another choc malt in.

ers, how are we going to tell whether
a person garbed in these foolish crea
tions is a freshman not yet out of
short pants or an upperclassman who
has reverted to second childhood?

The following polite notice which
appeared recently 011 the Encinu bul
letin board seems to have all of the
venom of the snake family hidden
under its outward smoothness: "If the
person who plays the radio at 12 p.m.
will call at room 414 he will learn
something for the benefit of the radio."

We derive great pleasure and a lit
tle more sleep (I hope) from this no
tice on the Encina board: "For sale —
one saxophone, cheap." Everything
would be fine if it were against the
law to sell musical instruments, uku
leles, and phonographs to anyone liv- j
ing at Encina hall. —C. W. !

Now that colleges own theatres, it
will be only a short time before they
will be operating road houses and
dance halls. This is a logical develop
ment of the age. Since students are
expected to support these activities, it
is only just that the University derive
the revenue.

Load her down for Sandy Beater,
The college champeen choc malt eater.
Something for nothing runs his story—
And so he patronizes Morey.
He strives to gain Ambition's peak
By eating twelve choc malts a week.
For with the premiums these bring him
He gets another choc malt in.

The University of Nebraska has a

lost since its teams first played foot
hall there. The university is a West
ern pioneer in football. The game has
been played for thirty-five years at the
Scarlet and Cream institution.
FRUITS OF EXPERIENCE
Speaking of dates, it is often impos
sible to tell a lemon from au orange
until you squeeze it.
It. sounds impossible and very much
like a paradox to say that a peach is
sometimes a lemon, but it is one of
those sad but true facts.
Is there any connection between a
blind date and a potato that has had
its eyes gouged out?

We have found another reason to
lament the fact that it is no longer
necessary for freshmen to wear dinks.
With the present popularity of knick
ers, how are we going to tell whether
a person garbed in these foolish crea
tions is a freshman not yet out of
short pants or an upperclassman who
has reverted to second childhood?
