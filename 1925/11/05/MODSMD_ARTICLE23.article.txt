(1 his is the second of a scries of
articles dealing with the organization
of student body affairs.)

Leslie H. Peter, ex-chairman of the
Rally committee, turned in to the Execu
tive committee last spring a report which
shows the nature of work done by the
group he headed during its second year
of existence. Twenty students, two of
whom must be women, and five of whom
must have served on the committee the
year previous, constitute the list of active
members. There are also ten ex-ofiicio
members who are merely to give advice
and help when it is needed.
The Rally committee started off the
year with the Big Game Rally in the
pavilion, which was attended by over
4000 people and was considered one of the
best gatherings of its kind ever held.
The stunts at the Big Game at Berkeley
showed the result of the careful planning.
The last job the committee had during
the football season was preparing the
rooting section for the Notre Dame game
in Pasadena. The stunts were not so
extensive as for the Big Game, but were
very effective and made a great impres
sion on the people in the southern part
of the state.
Track Rooters Organized
Last spring was the first time yelling
had been concentrated for the Big Meet,
when a rally at Lagunita and a regular
rooting section in the stadium were or
ganized successfully. The "booing" of
referees during basketball games was
much decreased last winter as a conse
quence of the work of the Rally com
mittee.
Beside organizing pep rallies and root
ing sections, much additional work was
done by the committee. The last Masque
Ball was put on under its direction, and
was the first ball to be run in a truly sys
tematic manner. The list of candidates
for yell leader was reduced to six by the
committee, which also attempted to make
the choice of this position as purely on
the basis of ability as it could by publish
ing the candidates' pictures and number
ing them.

fors the Rally committee incurred the

ganized successfully. The "booing" of
referees during basketball games was
much decreased last winter as a conse
quence of the work of the Rally com
mittee.
Beside organizing pep rallies and root
ing sections, much additional work was
done by the committee. The last Masque
Ball was put on under its direction, and
was the first ball to be run in a truly sys
tematic manner. The list of candidates
for yell leader was reduced to six by the
committee, which also attempted to make
the choice of this position as purely on
the basis of ability as it could by publish
ing the candidates' pictures and number
ing them.

General Expenses 21.90;
Total $678,221
Income
Sale of Rooters' Hats $526.52 i
Profit from Masque Ball 70.91 '

YELL SCHOOL INSTITUTED
A school of yell-masters, after the
manner of the large colleges of the
country, will be Instituted at the Uni
versity of Utah under a revised con
stitution to be put into effect soon. The

BOSTON GRANTS DEGREE
The University of Boston is the only
school in the country which confers a
Bachelor of Journalism degree to jour
nalism students. Other institutions
usually grant an A.B. degree for such |
work.
(1 his is the second of a scries of
articles dealing with the organization
of student body affairs.)

Leslie H. Peter, ex-chairman of the
Rally committee, turned in to the Execu
tive committee last spring a report which
shows the nature of work done by the
group he headed during its second year
of existence. Twenty students, two of
whom must be women, and five of whom
must have served on the committee the
year previous, constitute the list of active
members. There are also ten ex-ofiicio
members who are merely to give advice
and help when it is needed.
The Rally committee started off the
year with the Big Game Rally in the
pavilion, which was attended by over
4000 people and was considered one of the
best gatherings of its kind ever held.
The stunts at the Big Game at Berkeley
showed the result of the careful planning.
The last job the committee had during
the football season was preparing the
rooting section for the Notre Dame game
in Pasadena. The stunts were not so
extensive as for the Big Game, but were
very effective and made a great impres
sion on the people in the southern part
of the state.
Track Rooters Organized
Last spring was the first time yelling
had been concentrated for the Big Meet,
when a rally at Lagunita and a regular
rooting section in the stadium were or
ganized successfully. The "booing" of
referees during basketball games was
much decreased last winter as a conse
quence of the work of the Rally com
mittee.
