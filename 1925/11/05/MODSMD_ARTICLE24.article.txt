Stanford won the last preliminary
game of the season by defeating the
University of Southern California by
the substantial score of 16 to 0, after
a spirited struggle on the campus oval
Saturday afternoon. The varsity relied
principally upon heavy mass plays, and
this method of advance proved thor
oughly effective though painfully slow.
It was on defense that U. S. C. made
its best showing.

A special meeting of the men of the
University will be held in the Encina
clubroom tomorrow night to discuss
matters of special importance in the
conduct of the campus before the Big
Game.

The 1907 Plug Ugly was produced
before 2500 people on the football oval
last Friday. The play, "Pirates," was
up to the usual standard of Plug Ugly
productions, but unfortunately for the
actors, the seniors, who sat on the
ground directly in front of the stage,
had procured the manuscript before
the show. They took entire lines out
of the mouths of the players and
forced them to very amusing repeti
tions.

In a ragged and uninteresting game
of baseball the freshmen were de
feated by the faculty Saturday by a
score of 15 to 6. The poor showing of
'09 is excusable, however, for they
played two full teams and many substi
tutes during the course of the game.
