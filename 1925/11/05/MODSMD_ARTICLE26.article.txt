Varsity will meet the Huskies,
In a mighty football battle,
Washington's a scoring team,
That's no idle dopester's prattle.
Freshmen meet their ancient rivals,
From the school across the bay,
Interviewed upon the subject,
"29" had lots to say.
"Goose Hangs High" comes off tomor
row,
It should be a big success,
Interpretations of the lines
Display a delicate finesse.
John McNab, the noted lawyer.
Gave Euphronia his speech,
Everyone who heard him talk.
Admitted that it was a peach.
By the engineering corner,
Stunt committee planned some stuff,
Had the "Huskies" in the harness,
Tom and Liza in the rough.
