# STANFORD GRADUATES ENROLL IN HARVARD SCHOOL OF BUSINESS
## 
### 
Twenty-eight graduates of Stanford
University are now enrolled in the
Harvard Business School, according to
rword received from the secretary of
information at Harvard University.
Stanford ranks second in the number
of students enrolled in the Business
SchooL Because of the inability of the
Hchool to care for more than a limited
number of students, many men could
not be enrolled for the fall term. How
ever, many of those unable to enter
in the autumn will be admitted in i
February. Stanford men wishing to en-1
ter at that time are urged to file appli- j
cation papers at once, as the class is i
very limited in numbers.

recently graduated from Harvard are:
