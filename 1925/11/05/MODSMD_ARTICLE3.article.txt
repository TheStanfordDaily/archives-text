# COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER ATHLETIC AWARDS PLAN
## 
### 
The student body is again facing the
problem of revising athletic awards.
A committee of nine is meeting tomor
row to make preliminary considera
tions for a change.
A scheme of revising the present
athletic award plan was put before
the student body in the form of a con
stitutional amendment in the spring
election last year, but was defeated by
a vote of 817 to 279.
Last year's plan divided sports into
three groupsâ€”major, minor, and auxil
iary. Football, baseball, track, and
basketball were placed in the major
class, and the block "S" was desig
nated as the award. The minor sports
were limited to swimming, boxing, ten
nis, and soccer, and the type of award
chosen was the block circle "S." A
gold medal was suggested for the auxil
iary sports, which would consist of
cross-country, wrestling, golf, handball,
fencing, weight basketball, and gym.
If at any time any minor sport
should be proposed to be made a
major sport it could displace one of
the existing major sports by an amend
ment. The same method could be em
ployed in raising an auxiliary sport to
the minor group. Any additional auxil
iary sport should be decided upon by

| the Director of the Gymnasium and
j Staff without the vote of the students.
Any man winning a national cliam
| pionship, placing in the Olympic
Games, or playing on a soccer or water
1 polo team that wins a national cham
! pionship or competes in the Olympic
Games was to receive a block "S."
The chief objections to the plan
j were as follows: that with tennis as
! a minor sport the men would be com
peting against major sport teams of
other universities; that some of the
minor sports would be placed in the
auxiliary class with consequent, loss of
prestige; and (hat polo would be taken
away from the list of minor sports.
i
I Those upholding the plan gave its
advantages as follows: that the chief
merit was its uniformity, whereby a
man never would be in doubt if he
had won a letter; that tennis players
could get letters without defeating
California; that a participant could
win a letter by playing five minutes in
the Big Game; that the number of
block "S" awards would be cut down,
so that much more prestige would bo
attached to the block "S"; that auxil
iary sport men would not have to win
! against California in order to get an
| award.
