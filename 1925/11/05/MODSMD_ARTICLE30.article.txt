# PROFESSOR MEARS TAKES ACTIVE PART IN POLITICAL MEET
## 
### 
Professor Eliot G. Mears, acting
liead of the Graduate School of Busi
ness during Dean Hotchkiss' absence,
was one of the two representatives
from the Pacific Coast at the Institute
of Politics at Williamstown, Massachu-,
setss, this summer.
Professor Mears was the secretary
on the round table group which dis
cussed the Mediterranean area. The
leader of this table was Arnold J. i
roynbee, professor of international his
tory at the University of London and
historian of the British Institute of
International Affairs.
The work was carried on by means
of lectures, open conferences, and
eight round table discussions open to
the regular membership, which at this
session was slightly less than 200. The
membership was largely drawn from
eastern states and included lawyers,
college professors, college presidents,
American admirals and generals, lec- j
turers on international affairs, and
government technical experts. The
representatives are chosen for their
ability to contribute something definite
to the meetings, and were invited to
attend by President Garfield.
The Williamstown Institute of Poli- j
tics is the first of its kind in the world. (
Its purpose is to secure enlightenment
on world affairs and to hold an open
forum in which there may be "a shock
of ideas," according to its originator,
Harry Garfield, president of Williams
College.
The idea for the institute was first
proposed by Garfield in April, 1913, and
was approved by the Board of Trus
tees of Williams College. However, no
efforts were made to establish it dur
ing the war. In 1919, at the close of
his term as Federal Fuel Administra
tor, Garfield suggested a plan for
financing the proposed institute to
Bernard M. Baruch, chairman of the
Federal War Industries Board. Baruch
agreed to finance the institute for the
first three years.
The first meeting of the institute
was held in the summer of 1921 with a
distinguished set of speakers and lead
ers which included Viscount James
Bryce. Since 1921, annual meetings
have been held. The institute is now
supported jointly by Baruch, the Car
negie Corporation, and the General
Education Board. Garfield is now head
ing a campaign to secure a permanent
endowment of from one to two million
dollars.
Since the foundation of the Wil
liamstown Institute of Politics, many
similar organizations and conferences
have sprung up all over the United
States. Among the more significant of
these was the Institute of Pacific Rela
tions, held at Hawaii this summer, of
which President Ray Lyman Wilbur
of Stanford was chairman, and at
which Professors J. Payson Treat and
Yamato Ichihashi were representa
tives. The conference idea, according
to Mears, is more fully developed in
America than in any other country.
It produces common understanding
of world problems and seeks to do un
officially what the World Court tries
to do officially. These conferences are
a typically modern American out
growth. and could not be developed to
the same level in modern Europe,
where there is a greater limitation of
free discussion.

tees of Williams College. However, no
efforts were made to establish it dur
ing the war. In 1919, at the close of
his term as Federal Fuel Administra
tor, Garfield suggested a plan for
financing the proposed institute to
Bernard M. Baruch, chairman of the
Federal War Industries Board. Baruch
agreed to finance the institute for the
first three years.
The first meeting of the institute
was held in the summer of 1921 with a
distinguished set of speakers and lead
ers which included Viscount James
Bryce. Since 1921, annual meetings
have been held. The institute is now
supported jointly by Baruch, the Car
negie Corporation, and the General
Education Board. Garfield is now head
ing a campaign to secure a permanent
endowment of from one to two million
dollars.
Since the foundation of the Wil
liamstown Institute of Politics, many
similar organizations and conferences
have sprung up all over the United
States. Among the more significant of
these was the Institute of Pacific Rela
tions, held at Hawaii this summer, of
which President Ray Lyman Wilbur
of Stanford was chairman, and at
which Professors J. Payson Treat and
Yamato Ichihashi were representa
tives. The conference idea, according
to Mears, is more fully developed in
America than in any other country.
It produces common understanding
of world problems and seeks to do un
officially what the World Court tries
to do officially. These conferences are
a typically modern American out
growth. and could not be developed to
the same level in modern Europe,
where there is a greater limitation of
free discussion.
Professor Eliot G. Mears, acting
liead of the Graduate School of Busi
ness during Dean Hotchkiss' absence,
was one of the two representatives
from the Pacific Coast at the Institute
of Politics at Williamstown, Massachu-,
setss, this summer.
Professor Mears was the secretary
on the round table group which dis
cussed the Mediterranean area. The
leader of this table was Arnold J. i
roynbee, professor of international his
tory at the University of London and
historian of the British Institute of
International Affairs.
The work was carried on by means
of lectures, open conferences, and
eight round table discussions open to
the regular membership, which at this
session was slightly less than 200. The
membership was largely drawn from
eastern states and included lawyers,
college professors, college presidents,
American admirals and generals, lec- j
turers on international affairs, and
government technical experts. The
representatives are chosen for their
ability to contribute something definite
to the meetings, and were invited to
attend by President Garfield.
The Williamstown Institute of Poli- j
tics is the first of its kind in the world. (
Its purpose is to secure enlightenment
on world affairs and to hold an open
forum in which there may be "a shock
of ideas," according to its originator,
Harry Garfield, president of Williams
College.
The idea for the institute was first
proposed by Garfield in April, 1913, and
was approved by the Board of Trus
tees of Williams College. However, no
efforts were made to establish it dur
ing the war. In 1919, at the close of
