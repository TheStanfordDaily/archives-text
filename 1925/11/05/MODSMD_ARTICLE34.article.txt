The Editor, Sir;
I was appalled the other day, when!
i I took a shower in Encina gymnasium, i
to find that there was no hot water.
Upon inquiring among my friends as
to how long this condition has existed,
I found that the gymnasium water has
been cold all quarter. Can't something
be done to rectify this situation, which
is obviously so out of keeping with the
high efficiency of administration that
Stanford students talk about so much
in Southern California? I suggest that
steps be taken immediately in the
right direction.
Such a condition as I have outlined
above is not only unjust (especially to
the lower classes who are required to
study gymnastics), but also dangerous.
The idea of forcing the lower classes
in our University into gymnasium
classes and then greeting them after
their exercises with a shower that is
not only not hot but even cold, would
seem to verge on the point of "rubbing
it in." It is just such things as this
that breed revolutionary ideas in the
minds of our lower classes. They chafe
under their dinks and are slow with
their bonfires, but are they wholly to
blame?
Let the women be cold, let the flag
poles remain flagless, abolish the as
semblies, and even allow the grammar
school kids free admission to the sta
dium; but if we have to put up with
the above, must we also be deprived of
hot showers in our gymnasium?
