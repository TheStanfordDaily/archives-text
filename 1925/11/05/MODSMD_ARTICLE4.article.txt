# VOLUME OF LAWS SCORED BY M'NAB IN EUPHRONIA TALK
## Senseless Legislation Cause of Present Widespread Contempt of Law 
### 
Complexity and volume of useless
and senseless legislation cause the
American people to lose their respect
for law, according to John L. McNab,
prominent San Francisco lawyer and
orator, who addressed the open meet
ing of Euplironia Debating Society last
evening in the lobby of the Old Union.
In speaking on "Can Goodness Be
Legislated," McNab emphasized the
tremendous number of unnecessary
statutes governing the American's con
duct in everyday life, and the subse
quent lack of observance of law, as •
well as disrespect to lawyers and ;
| courts on the part of the citizen.
3,000,000 Laws Compiled
McNab stated that we have left the j
flexibility of the common law of Black-
I stone and Kent, changing instead to a
j condition where legislated law con-
I trols conduct. He showed how the
I Federal system, encroaching upon the
! rights of the state and of the indi
! vidual citizen, the several state legis
' latures, the 1750 county boards of
| supervisors, and the local municipal
. governments had compiled in all over
3,000,000 laws, ranging "from the col
i lection of taxes to rules prohibiting
j expectoration on sidewalks."
"The citizen," he said, "is enmeshed
j by these senseless and complex laws,
| and is unable to conduct himself in
I everyday life without violating stat
; utes that are either the result of per
i sonal grudges, or which have long lost
] their influence by the change of times.
I As a result, he is inclined to treat the
j whole fabric of law with contempt and
| disregard.
Laws Enforced
In discussing causes and remedies
for this situation, McNab declared:
i "The only way to get rid of unpopular
| law is to enforce it." In this connec
! tion he cited the example of Roosevelt,
| who cleared the statutes of New York
!by the enforcement of "blue laws"
i which had been legislated in the days
; of the Knickerbocker regime. The re
sultant protest on the part of the citi
' zens soon caused public opinion to de
| mand their repeal.
The repeal of useless statutes from
; the statute books was given as the
next forward step in government. Mc
j Nab declared that legislation of the
future would involve a consideration
of laws rather than the passing of new
j statutes.
Commission Recommended
| In his opinion great lawyers are not
those who read countless numbers of
i legal Btatutes and material, but rather
those who can reason on the funda
mental principles of law, espfecially as
! set forth in the great commentary of
Blackstone.
In the open discussion which fol-
I lowed, McNab declared that he be
lieved a commission of three men,
: prominent in legal fields and provided
with sufficient remuneration for leav
i ing private practice, could in two
years eliminate from four to eight,
thousand laws from the statutes of
; California alone if backed by the sanc
tion of the legislature through public
j opinion.

"The citizen," he said, "is enmeshed

; utes that are either the result of per

j whole fabric of law with contempt and

Laws Enforced
In discussing causes and remedies
for this situation, McNab declared:
i "The only way to get rid of unpopular
| law is to enforce it." In this connec
! tion he cited the example of Roosevelt,
| who cleared the statutes of New York
!by the enforcement of "blue laws"
i which had been legislated in the days
; of the Knickerbocker regime. The re
sultant protest on the part of the citi
' zens soon caused public opinion to de
| mand their repeal.
The repeal of useless statutes from
; the statute books was given as the
next forward step in government. Mc
j Nab declared that legislation of the
future would involve a consideration
of laws rather than the passing of new
j statutes.
Commission Recommended
| In his opinion great lawyers are not
those who read countless numbers of
i legal Btatutes and material, but rather
those who can reason on the funda
mental principles of law, espfecially as
! set forth in the great commentary of
Blackstone.
In the open discussion which fol-
I lowed, McNab declared that he be
lieved a commission of three men,
: prominent in legal fields and provided
with sufficient remuneration for leav
i ing private practice, could in two
years eliminate from four to eight,
thousand laws from the statutes of
; California alone if backed by the sanc
tion of the legislature through public
j opinion.
Complexity and volume of useless
and senseless legislation cause the
American people to lose their respect
for law, according to John L. McNab,
prominent San Francisco lawyer and
orator, who addressed the open meet
ing of Euplironia Debating Society last
evening in the lobby of the Old Union.
In speaking on "Can Goodness Be
Legislated," McNab emphasized the
tremendous number of unnecessary
statutes governing the American's con
duct in everyday life, and the subse
quent lack of observance of law, as •
well as disrespect to lawyers and ;
| courts on the part of the citizen.
3,000,000 Laws Compiled
McNab stated that we have left the j
flexibility of the common law of Black-
I stone and Kent, changing instead to a
j condition where legislated law con-
I trols conduct. He showed how the
I Federal system, encroaching upon the
! rights of the state and of the indi
! vidual citizen, the several state legis
' latures, the 1750 county boards of
| supervisors, and the local municipal
. governments had compiled in all over
3,000,000 laws, ranging "from the col
i lection of taxes to rules prohibiting
j expectoration on sidewalks."
