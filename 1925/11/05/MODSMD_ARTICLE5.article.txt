# STANFORD RESERVES WILL CONTEST BEAR SECONDS SATURDAY
## Series of Forfeits Deprive Grays of Much-Desired Playing Experience 
### 
Without the necessary experience
gained from playing games with out
side teams, the Stanford Grays are
getting in shape for the contest with
the California Reserves Saturday. The
Grays have had games scheduled for
the last three weeks, but each Satur
day they have been left without a con
test on account of forfeiture.
Coach Hal Davis has before him the
problem of winning a game with men
whom he has never seen play except
in scrimmages with the varsity and
freshmen. On the defense the reserves
have been playing real football, but
their offense has been weak. Monday
night they were able to make only
thirty-five yards against the varsity in
a long scrimmage. They had better
luck against the freshmen the follow
ing night, but showed a sad lack of
co-ordination.
Mike Symonds and Steve Arata,
guards, have been exhibiting good de
fense work, and Ken Graham, at cen
ter, has been passing the ball to the
backs unerringly. Swede Antonelle has
been playing the best at end, although
Davis has a number of good men for
both the end and tackle positions. The
backfield lacks stars, though Macabee
gets a spurt of genius every once in a
while, but is not consistent. Cowan,
| Clark, Wolf, and Dungan have all been
making a good showing, but fail to
co-operate for the final punch.
The California Reserves have a
strong team. They defeated St. Mary's
goofs 29 to 0, and in so doing kept the
ball constantly in their opponents' ter
ritory. Their strength was again mani
fested in the close game with the Cali
fornia freshmen, by whom they were
beaten by only a 7 to 6 score. They
threatened several times to score. Van
Horn, Clymer, Gillett, and Zweiner are
California's stars.
