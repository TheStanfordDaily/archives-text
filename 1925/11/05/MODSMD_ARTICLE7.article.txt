# CONCERT SOPRANO TO GIVE RECITAL IN ASSEMBLY HALL
## Anna Case Will Appear in First of Series to Be Given at Stanford 
### Herbert Klein 
Anna Case, popular American con
cert soprano, will appear in the Stan
ford Assembly hall tonight at 8:15
o'clock in the opening concert of the
Peninsula Music Association's series.
Miss Case is probably the best-known
soprano singer on the concert stage to
day and has, besides a notable voice,
great personal charm, and a pleasing
personality.'
j She is completely an American artist,
' having had her early vocal training with
| the Metropolitan Opera Company of New
{York. Miss Case's appearances in Lon
j don, Berlin, and other European cities
| during the past few years have been well
i received. In this country her tours in-
I elude every state. Her season last year
J alone contained more than fifty concerts
j which she traveled more than 20,000
i miles to give.
j Miss Case's concert tonight consists of
four song-groups with many notable scl
lections. One group of great interest
historically consists entirely of songs of
the time of the American Revolution. Few
of these have been heard in recitals be
fore. The first songs to be sung are
selections from Mozart and Haydn, great
musicians of the classical school. Miss
Case believes in the value of including
â–  operatic arias in her programs and has
1 always done so with great success.
Group two is devoted to songs by
j French composers. Following the bal-
I lads of the revolutionary period is the
final section with some contemporary
works including one song by the Rus
j sian, Sergei Rachmaninoff. Max Jaffec
i will play the accompaniment.
; Crandall's and the Stanford Bookstore
are carrying tickets for the recital. Single
j tickets for this concert alone may be
purchased as well as season tickets for
j the series of four to be given by the
! Peninsula Music Association.
