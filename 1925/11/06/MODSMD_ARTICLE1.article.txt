# CARDINAL MERMEN ENTER FINAL P.A.A. MEET IN OAKLAND
## Strength of Olympic Club Is Shown by Results of Past Competition 
### 
With the 1925 P. A. A. championship
as their object, five Stanford varsity
swimmers left this afternoon for the
final meet at the Athens Club of Oak
hind. The Cardinal swimmers have ac
cumulated a score of 35 points as
against 26 for the Olympic Club, their
closest opponents. The clubmen will
give them most of their competition
tonight.
In order to take advantage of every
opportunity that presents itself Ernst
Brundsten has left the final choice of
which men will be entered in each
-event until the time of the meet itself.
Then he will be able to place them to
greatest advantage after seeing what
sort of competition there is in each
race.
The 400-yard P. A. A. relay should
be a classic of its kind. Six teams are
entered but it is almost a foregone
-conclusion that the battle for first
place and the 10 points will be between
Stanford and the "Winged O" outfit.
Last spring in Encina Pool the Cardi
nal swimmers beat the Olympic Club
by a scant six inches in a 400-foot
relay and the clubmen are out for
revenge as well as for the points with
which they hope to take the title. To
do this they will probably save their
fastest men, Mooney, Robertson, and
Schroth, as much as possible from
competition in the other events.
On the Stanford relay team will be
Arden Allen, Hob Williams, Carl Ste
venson, and Phil Brooks.
Colin Smith will probably start in
the 100 and Doug Ackerman and Bill
Danford in the 50-yard free style. The
large number of seventy entered in the
meet makes it necessary to hold heats
in the 50 and 100 so that those swim
ming these will have an evening's
"work cut out for them without enter
ing any others. The 150-yard back
stroke will have either Carl Steven
son or Arden Allen, or both, as start
ers, depending upon who else enters.
Dave Fall is the sole Cardinal hope
in the 10-foot diving. A1 White is en
tered for the Club and will probably
force Fall to second. Dopesters have
been busy for the past week figuring
the probable score of the meet from
all angles. The consensus of opinion is
that Stanford has the odds against her
in the year's P. A. A. championship
race, but may, through sheer fight, get
the title by a few points.

that Stanford has the odds against her
in the year's P. A. A. championship
race, but may, through sheer fight, get
the title by a few points.
With the 1925 P. A. A. championship
as their object, five Stanford varsity
swimmers left this afternoon for the
final meet at the Athens Club of Oak
hind. The Cardinal swimmers have ac
cumulated a score of 35 points as
against 26 for the Olympic Club, their
closest opponents. The clubmen will
give them most of their competition
tonight.
In order to take advantage of every
opportunity that presents itself Ernst
Brundsten has left the final choice of
which men will be entered in each
-event until the time of the meet itself.
Then he will be able to place them to
greatest advantage after seeing what
sort of competition there is in each
race.
The 400-yard P. A. A. relay should
be a classic of its kind. Six teams are
entered but it is almost a foregone
-conclusion that the battle for first
place and the 10 points will be between
Stanford and the "Winged O" outfit.
Last spring in Encina Pool the Cardi
nal swimmers beat the Olympic Club
by a scant six inches in a 400-foot
relay and the clubmen are out for
revenge as well as for the points with
which they hope to take the title. To
do this they will probably save their
fastest men, Mooney, Robertson, and
Schroth, as much as possible from
competition in the other events.
On the Stanford relay team will be
Arden Allen, Hob Williams, Carl Ste
venson, and Phil Brooks.
Colin Smith will probably start in
the 100 and Doug Ackerman and Bill
Danford in the 50-yard free style. The
large number of seventy entered in the
meet makes it necessary to hold heats
in the 50 and 100 so that those swim
ming these will have an evening's
"work cut out for them without enter
ing any others. The 150-yard back
stroke will have either Carl Steven
son or Arden Allen, or both, as start
ers, depending upon who else enters.
Dave Fall is the sole Cardinal hope
in the 10-foot diving. A1 White is en
tered for the Club and will probably
force Fall to second. Dopesters have
been busy for the past week figuring
the probable score of the meet from
all angles. The consensus of opinion is
that Stanford has the odds against her
in the year's P. A. A. championship
race, but may, through sheer fight, get
the title by a few points.
