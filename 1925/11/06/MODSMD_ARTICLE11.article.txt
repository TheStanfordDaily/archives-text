# CALIFORNIA CUBS FAVORED IN FRESHMAN GAME TOMORROW
## Husky Hunt's Squad Crippled By Injuries to Star Performers 
### Frank Baker 
Stanford and California freshman grid
teams will be in the limelight when they
tussle for the honors of the little Big
Game tomorrow afternoon. The kickoff
will be at 3 o'clock in the stadium.
The Bear Cubs have the best chance
in three years to beat the Card frosh, for
they have a larger and more experienced
squad, a heavier line, a better record of
games, and their men are all in good
condition. The Cards suffered a run of
bad luck the past two weeks when the
three heavy linemen, Tandy, Artman, and
Doyle were relegated to the bench on ac
count of injuries.
Tandy, Artman Out
Tandy and Artman arc the best tackles
on the squad and their loss is going to be
a great handicap to the Stanford team.
Moomaw will replace Artman at left
tackle, Klablau will start at right tackle,
and Cook will hold down the left guard.
This gives the line an average of 174
pounds, exactly sixteen pounds per man
less than the Bear forward wall. Ver
milya and Harder, playing center and end,
respectively, each weigh 182 pounds and
are the heaviest men on the starting
line-up.
Stanford has a speedier team than
California and will rely on open forma
tions, passing, and kicking to make its
yards, for the Cub line to date has been
practically impenetrable. Coach Hunt's
combination of Lewis at quarter, Wilton
and Sims at halves, and Smalling at full,
is an enviable one for this type of game.
Lewis has rarely made a mistake this
year, while Wilton and Sims are wonders
at running and passing. Smalling can
be counted on to plunge through the line
ofte ncnough to draw the opposing line-
I men in and give th elialfbacks a chance
j to work open formations.
Wilton Punts Will
Wilton's kicking, if up to par, will
give the California yearlings considerable
worry, for his fifty and sixty yard punts
are always high and give his teammates
plenty of time to get down the field to
tackle the receiver in his tracks. Clymer
and Barr of California have been doing
most of the kicking for their team. Both
men are good and will give Wilton a
real battle for the punting honors of the
! day-
While Coach Husky Hunt has had to
develop a man for almost every position,
the California mentor, Clint Evans, has
found so many good men he is not able
i to give all of them a chance to play.
| Briggs, who will oppose Vermilya at
' center, is considered the best linesman on
i the Bear team, but Vermilya should be
' able to hold him, if his playing against
j Fox of the U. S. C. freshmen is any in
| dication. Ralph Dougery, who changes
! off with Captain Cockburn as Cub full
! back, is a brother of Jim Dougery, Cali
! fornia. varsity star.
Cubs Favored Before
For the past two years California has
! been picked to win, but both games were
! won by the Card freshmen. Year before
! last the score was 12 to 0, last year 16 to
10. The question is: Can Husky Hunt
again upset the dope and bring this squad
i of inexperienced men through to victory?
The probable line-up:
: Stanford Position California
