# CALIFORNIA CUBS FAVORED IN FRESHMAN GAME TOMORROW
## Husky Hunt's Squad Crippled By Injuries to Star Performers 
### Frank Baker 
Stanford and California freshman grid
teams will be in the limelight when they
tussle for the honors of the little Big
Game tomorrow afternoon. The kickoff
will be at 3 o'clock in the stadium.
The Bear Cubs have the best chance
in three years to beat the Card frosh, for
they have a larger and more experienced
squad, a heavier line, a better record of
games, and their men are all in good
condition. The Cards suffered a run of
bad luck the past two weeks when the
three heavy linemen, Tandy, Artman, and
Doyle were relegated to the bench on ac
count of injuries.
Tandy, Artman Out
Tandy and Artman arc the best tackles
on the squad and their loss is going to be
a great handicap to the Stanford team.
Moomaw will replace Artman at left
tackle, Klablau will start at right tackle,
and Cook will hold down the left guard.
This gives the line an average of 174
pounds, exactly sixteen pounds per man
less than the Bear forward wall. Ver
milya and Harder, playing center and end,
respectively, each weigh 182 pounds and
are the heaviest men on the starting
line-up.
Stanford has a speedier team than
California and will rely on open forma
tions, passing, and kicking to make its
yards, for the Cub line to date has been
practically impenetrable. Coach Hunt's
combination of Lewis at quarter, Wilton
and Sims at halves, and Smalling at full,
is an enviable one for this type of game.
Lewis has rarely made a mistake this
year, while Wilton and Sims are wonders
at running and passing. Smalling can
be counted on to plunge through the line
ofte ncnough to draw the opposing line-
