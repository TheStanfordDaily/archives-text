# JAMES D. COCKBURN ELECTED CAPTAIN OF REARS' 1929 ELEVEN
## 
### Harry Frishman 
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA,
Nov. C. —James Donald Cockburn, the
hard-hitting fullback on Coach Clint
Evans* powerful California freshman
gridiron team, was chosen captain of
the 1929 eleven by his teammates at
last night's training table. Therefore
Jimmy Cockburn will lead the Cali
fornia yearlings to Palo Alto tomorrow
where they will clash with the Stan
ford babes in their annual "little big
game."
Jimmy got his prep training at Pasa
dena High School, where his brilliant
play in the backfield stamped him as
one of the greatest high school full
backs in the entire West. Cockburn
reported for football practice at the
beginning of the season and, after
working out with the second squad for
a couple of weeks, was shifted to the
first eleven and has been one of the
mainstays of the Bruin Cubs since
then. Cockburn's strength lies in his
irresistible line-plunging, and his shifty
style of play makes him a dangerous
man on short end runs. He is a demon
tackier and seldom lets his man get by
the secondary defense.
Coach Clint Evans was not content
to let his men finish off their training
with light workouts, and has held
scrimmage with the second team every
night this week. Although it is just
what the men need to put them in
condition for their annual tilt, it has
proved disastrous in at least one case.
Armstrong, who has performed with
exceptional ability in the last few
tilts, was taken off the field with badly
wrenched muscles in his leg, and will
probably have to be kept on the bench
next Saturday. Either Nuner or Killian
will fit in at the left wing position at
the start of the game. There is little
1o choose between the two men, both
are fast, excellent tacklers, and quite
efficient in the art of snagging passes.
Coach Evans will probably work them
both in at different stages of the game.
