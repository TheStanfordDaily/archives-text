# SENIORS, FRESHMEN COMPETE FOR CLASS FOOTBALL HONORS
## Juniors and Sophomores Will Fight for Third-Place Points 
### 
The strong senior class football team
will oppose the freshmen eleven tomor
row morning in the championship contest
of the interclass series. The juniors and
seniors are also slated to play tomorrow,
for the third and fourth positions in the
interclass standing.
Coach Murray Cuddeback has devel
oped his senior team to a great extent.
In the game with the sophomores last
week, his charges displayed strong de
fense and a smoothly working offense.
No trick plays have been tried so far this
season, but it is the general impression
that the seniors will use a much flashier
attack in tomorrow's tussle.
The first-year eleven, coached by the
veteran, Harry Shipkey, exhibited a
strong type of game last week against
the juniors. The yearlings presented a
brilliant attack that baffled the junior
team. Their defense was nearly im
penetrable, so the seniors will probably
run up against some tough opposition.
The sophomores are conceded a slight
advantage over the juniors in their game.
Both teams are comparatively weak, but
will doubtlessly put up a good battle.
Professor John B. Channing will ref
eree the senior-freshman game, and Chet
Douglas will officiate at the other con
test. Both games are scheduled to start
promptly at 9:30 o'clock.
The interclass games have aroused a
considerable interest this year, and a big
crowd is expected to turn out for the
title game. A section of the bleacher
will be reserved for the women wishing
to see the games.
