# THIRTY IDEAS FOR BIG GAME STUNTS SENT TO COMMITTEE
## 
### 
About thirty ideas for bleacher stunts
for the Rig Game have been turned in to
the Rally Committee since the announce
ment of the bleacher stunt contest. Of
this number, four are of the standard
the committee wishes to maintain.
Many of the ideas turned in so far are
duplicates of stunts used in former years.
Also a number of them are impractical,
but no matter how vague or impossible
an idea may be, the committee will gladly
accept any hunch. The Rally Committee
will consider every idea turned in, and
it may be that a good bleacher stunt can
be developed from it. The award for
the winner is a silver cup presented by
Wideman & Son of Palo Alto.
Only three more days remain in which
to send in ideas. The contest ends Mon
day night. All ideas must be given to
F. L. Hastings at the Sigma Chi house.
