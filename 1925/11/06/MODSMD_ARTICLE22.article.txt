# CONFERENCE LEAD AT STAKE WHEN CARDS BATTLE HUSKIES
## Washington Conceded Slight Edge Over Stanford in Tomorrow's Contest 
### Wilbur Adams 
The lead in the Pacific Coast football
j conference is at stake when Stanford
meets the University of Washington
tomorrow afternoon at the stadium in.
Seattle. Stanford is entering its fourth
conference battle while the game will
be the Huskies' third league match.
Both teams have won all their confer
ence starts so far this year.
When two teams are as evenly
matched as Washington and Stanford
are, the team playing on its home
: grounds is usually the favorite, and so
it is tomorrow. In the case of rain, a
' slow, muddy field would be an added
point in the Northerners' favor. But
! the Cards have a few things in their
l'avor. Elmer Tesreau, captain of Wash
ington, and George Wilson, the out
i standing star on the team, have both
i been suffering from injuries this week.
The record of the Huskies is better
! than any team on the Coast for both
scoring and defensive work. The sea
son was started out by defeating the
Willamette team 108 to 0, which is the
largest score that has been made on
; the Pacific Coast so far in the 1925
i season. The Seattle Athletic Club was
i downed 56 to 0, and on the next week
I Washington won the first conference
' game from Montana. The Nebraska-
Washington contest resulted in a 6-6
tie. The Huskies beat Whitman 64 to 2,
and then on last Saturday Washington
| State met defeat at the hands of the
| Seattle players, 23 to 0.
Although Stanford's scores have not
been so impressive, the Cards have
j undoubtedly met teams superior to the
opponents that Washington has met
I and defeated. In the last three weeks
Pop Warner has sent his men against
I three league contestants, and the re
j suit is three wins without a loss to
mar the Stanford conference record.
â€¢It is a prediction that both U. S. C.
and O. A. C. would have given Wash
ington a hard battle. Washington has
j not beaten a team of any consequence
I this season.
Each man that left for the North
Wednesday night was equipped with
two complete outfits. If rain falls to
morrow at Seattle. Stanford will wear
| regular football suits with mud cleats
on their shoes. But if the sun shines,
the Card varsity will don their summer
j outfits which consist of light white
jerseys, padless pants, and low shoes.
The Cards will call signals by the
! huddle system.
