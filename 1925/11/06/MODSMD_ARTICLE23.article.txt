# MACDOWELL WORK ON ALLEN'S ORGAN RECITAL PROGRAM
## 
### 
Next Sunday afternoon at 4 o'clock
Warren I). Allen, University organist,
will present a program of notable se
lections. Edward MacDowell, the most
individual and original musical genius
that America has produced, is repre
; sented by his "Told at Sunset." This
is one of the group of short piano com
positions entitled "Woodland Sketch
es" which are probably the most popu-
I lar of MacDowell's works. They were
composed at Boston in 1896 shortly
before the composer went to take up
his musical duties at Columbia Uni
i versity.
"Toccata and Fugue in D minor" by
J. S. Bach will open the program. Bach
found the fugue a rigid and formal
; musical pattern governed by technical
rules. He made it a thing of life and
vitality, and one of the great forms for
expressing lofty and dignified musical
thought.
"Cradle Song" is by Franz Schubert,
whose fund of melodies seem inex
i haustible. Schubert died while com
paratively young, but he left an uu
; equaled collection of great songs and
■ other compositions. "Cradle Song" is a
simple and appealing melody.
A remarkable work is "Kold Nidrei"
taken from old Hebrew melodies. The
; name signifies "Day of God" as the
i piece is played once each year on the
holiest day. "Finale from the Suite In
D major" by Edward Shippen Barnes
! will close the program.
On November 17 Mr. Allen will have
the first of his recitals devoted to the
works of one composer. Wagnerian se
lections will make up the program on
| that day.
