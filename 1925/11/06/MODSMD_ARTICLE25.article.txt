Communism in all its glory will meet tonight in San Francisco accord
ing to a handbill distributed here this week. Soviet Russia will be eulo
gized. The Russian Revolution, whose eighth anniversary is to be cele
brated at the same time, will be set on high as the most perfect event since
Noah slapped several hundred animals into his Ark and saved them for
posterity.
Everyone will undoubtedly have a good time at the meeting. Bricks
may fly, abuse will be prevalent, and condemnation will be the "order of
the day." The only contentment that will be seen will arise from the fact
that all assembled seriously believe that Communism is the only sun that
rnav shed the light of knowledge on mankind.
The handbill distributed on the campus is interesting—if not humor
ous. If its vitrolic attacks on governments and individuals may be be
lieved, the entire world is occupying twenty-four hours each day toward
undermining the great institution of Communism.
"Down with American Imperialism and its looting of the peoples of
Mexico, South America, China, and the Philippines," says the handbill—
and why not include Abyssinia and Oskosh ?
"Down with the Dawes Plan and the enslaving of the German and
American workers."
And the final climax—"Down with American militarism and its sacri
fice of the workers' lives for capitalist profits."
A great amount of self-pity is certainly the aim of every true com
munist. What a satisfying existence to feel that one is the object of the
world's abuse!
