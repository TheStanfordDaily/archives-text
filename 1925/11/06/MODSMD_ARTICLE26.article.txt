# The 						Little Big Game
## 
### 
Coach "Husky" Hunt will send his yearling - charges against the Blue
and Gold Cubs tomorrow in an effort to register the third consecutive win
over the Berkeley aggregation. This is the fourth year that Coach Hunt
has been quietly striving to turn out winning freshman teams, and his
ability has been clearly shown by his unusual success.
The campus is waiting expectantly for another trouncing of the Bear
tomorrow. Hunt has never had the galaxy of stars around which to mould
a team that Stanford's chief rivals on the north and south have had, but
the little freshman mentor has made the most out of his material and the
results have been more than satisfactory. The Babes have met with but
one defeat this season, and that at the hands of the Trojans. They will go
.into the fray tomorrow slightly the under dogs, but Cardinal freshmen
seem to enjoy that incentive and fight all the harder because of it.
Whatever happens tomorrow, those who attend the game will be as
sured of seeing some real football. The freshmen are going to fight with
an unquenchable determination and will never cease following right after
the ball until the final whistle. When a team has that battling spirit, it
deserves the support of the entire student body, and this can best be shown
by a 100 per cent student attendance to watch the biggest little game on
the coast.
