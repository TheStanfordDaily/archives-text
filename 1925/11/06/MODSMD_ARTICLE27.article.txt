# Midquarters
## 
### 
The campus finds itself in the throes of midquarters, which have come
with inexorable swiftness for the man who has been neglectful of his
studies. The examinations are sweeping many a would-be student off his
feet and down into the abyss of blue slips, flunks, and despair. In many
cases the remaining six weeks of grace, a blanket amnesty, will fail to re
store those who have fallen.
In a short time we will see many delinquent youths returning home
because of eye trouble, the death of grandmother, or the need of helping
father run his business. Others will struggle along awaiting the inevitable
end with its disqualification slip, and then they too will leave with the sym
pathy of their fellow students.
After all, however, midquarters are only the half-way mark and failure
in them should not necessarily lead to ultimate disgrace. Diligent appli
cation, even though rather belated, will always save the day if it proves
persistent and sincere. To the man who has been dawdling idly through
his work there must come a realization that time glides swiftly and almost
unnoticeably by, and unless immediate efforts are made to check up it will
be too late. Professors will show a reasonable indulgence to those who
give proof of zealous determination to make up for the deficiencies of the
first half of the quarter, and will help to lift a low midquarter grade where
the student has demonstrated the ability and the will to succeed.
It is not to late for a rally. Don't allow your chance for recuperation
to slip!

on the straight and narrow way ought to be easy for the doctor after a quarter
of a century's experience with the Buckeye collegians.
