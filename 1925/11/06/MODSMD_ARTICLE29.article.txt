# DAY'S DOINGS
## 
### Ted Elias, Jr 
Mid-Term Ex's are among us,
We will try to liit them hard,
So the teachers of our College,
For our prowess have regard.
Stanford's "Goofs" and California
Tangle in their annual fray,
Let us hope some unsung hero
Does his stuff and saves the day.
Roughs will find for thÂ»ir convenience
Guides to every Campus dance,
We must see that Rough's attendance
Is not left to fickle chance.
Stanford's fighting Cardinal team,
On Saturday will issue forth
To gain another victory
By humbling Huskies of the North.
P. A. A. will hold a meet,
To crown a future swimming champ.
Let us hope it doesn't rain.
And make the party cold and damp.
