# "Dodson's Hints on Musical Hits"
## 
### 
Just about once a year a really
clever comedy duet makes its appear
ance in record form. Honors for 1925 go
to Aileen Stanley and Billy Murray who
sing "Keep Your Skirts Down Mary
Ann." The song has to do with Mary
Ann who receives her mother's disser- !
tation on keeping skirts down with
frequent comments of "Applesauce."
Plenty of humor in this record and its j
companion.
Paul Whiteman contributes two
smooth, finished fox-trots in "Peaceful
Valley" and "Days of Hearts and
Flowers." The latter is a fox-trot rendi- ;
tion of Tobani's famous "Hearts and
Flowers." The former is from more
recent sources. Both are good.
The Goodrich Silvertown Cord Or
chestra. which has been winning de-1
served popularity over the radio, makes
as its first Victor recording, "A Kiss j
in the Moonlight" and "Brown Eyes,
Why Are You Blue?" These are splen
did fox-trots played by a splendid or
ganization whose individuality you will
enjoy and appreciate.
Hear these records at our store to
morrow morning on the new Ortho
phonic Victrola.
