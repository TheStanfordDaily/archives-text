# ANNA CASE CONCERT WELL RECEIVED BY CAMPUS AUDIENCE
## Soprano Displays Resonant, Rich Voice in All Her Selections 
### Herbert Klein 
Anna Case, in her concert last night,
displayed a remarkable voice and an
ability for illustrating her selections
by expression and gestures. Her audi
ence was large and appreciative and
called repeatedly for encores.
The concert was the first of the
series of four which are being given
in the Stanford Assembly hall by the
Peninsula Music Association.
Miss Case's soprano was rich, clear,
and resonant, especially on the high
notes which she negotiated without
the slightest roughness. She kept the
dramatic sense of the song continually
to the fore in her renditions and never
for a moment lost sight of the mean
ing of the words in following the
melody. Her enunciation was remark
ably sharp and distinct, almost too
much so at times, for some of her
consonants were so pronounced as to
break the melodic flow of the song.
Her ability to sustain high notes was
remarkable and enabled her to end
songs in a great burst of sound.
Judging from the expressions which
accompanied brilliant selection, sung
in Italian, from Mozart's "Marriage of
Figaro," the words must have been
delightful. "Alleluja," by Handel, gave
an opportunity for a very satisfactory
display of vocal pyrotechnics.
In Group 2 were French composi
tions of vivacity and charm. The last
song, "Le Moulin," by Gabriel Pierne,
was most striking and had a novel
piano accompaniment and a dynamic
rhythm. The accompanist, Max Jaffee,
was uniformly painstaking and 'fol
lowed the singer perfectly. He was
excellent in subordinating the piano
to bring out the voice to greatest ad
vantage.
Miss Case seems to have discovered
a real mine of music in the songs of
early American Revolutionary times.
The crudity or lack of finish which
might be expected in the early music
was completely absent, probably due to
the modern harmonization, and the
melodies were pleasing, especially in
"He Stole My Tender Heart Away."
The first encore for this group was
one of the most beautiful renditions of
the evening, "The Song of India," by
Rimsky-Korsakoff. Miss Case brought
out all the dre'amy beauty and Oriental
wonder of it.
Five recent works completed the pro
gram. "Joy," by Winter Watts, was
filled with barbaric energy and vitality.
It was a feat of singing to give it in
the masterly way Miss Case did.

a real mine of music in the songs of
early American Revolutionary times.
The crudity or lack of finish which
might be expected in the early music
was completely absent, probably due to
the modern harmonization, and the
melodies were pleasing, especially in
"He Stole My Tender Heart Away."
The first encore for this group was
one of the most beautiful renditions of
the evening, "The Song of India," by
Rimsky-Korsakoff. Miss Case brought
out all the dre'amy beauty and Oriental
wonder of it.
Five recent works completed the pro
gram. "Joy," by Winter Watts, was
filled with barbaric energy and vitality.
It was a feat of singing to give it in
the masterly way Miss Case did.
Anna Case, in her concert last night,
displayed a remarkable voice and an
ability for illustrating her selections
by expression and gestures. Her audi
ence was large and appreciative and
called repeatedly for encores.
The concert was the first of the
series of four which are being given
in the Stanford Assembly hall by the
Peninsula Music Association.
Miss Case's soprano was rich, clear,
and resonant, especially on the high
notes which she negotiated without
the slightest roughness. She kept the
dramatic sense of the song continually
to the fore in her renditions and never
for a moment lost sight of the mean
ing of the words in following the
melody. Her enunciation was remark
ably sharp and distinct, almost too
much so at times, for some of her
consonants were so pronounced as to
break the melodic flow of the song.
Her ability to sustain high notes was
remarkable and enabled her to end
songs in a great burst of sound.
Judging from the expressions which
accompanied brilliant selection, sung
in Italian, from Mozart's "Marriage of
Figaro," the words must have been
delightful. "Alleluja," by Handel, gave
an opportunity for a very satisfactory
display of vocal pyrotechnics.
In Group 2 were French composi
tions of vivacity and charm. The last
song, "Le Moulin," by Gabriel Pierne,
was most striking and had a novel
piano accompaniment and a dynamic
rhythm. The accompanist, Max Jaffee,
was uniformly painstaking and 'fol
lowed the singer perfectly. He was
excellent in subordinating the piano
to bring out the voice to greatest ad
vantage.
