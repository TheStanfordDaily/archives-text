# THREE CONFERENCE GAMES REMAIN FOR CALIFORNIA BEARS
## 
### 
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, !
Nyv. G. —With six of their games of :
the 3925 season a matter of the past, j
the Golden Bears of California meet
three of the most dangerous teams ol'
the Pacific: Coast —Washington State
College, University of Washington, and |
Stanford University, in their attempt |
to win their sixth successive Pacific |
Coast Conference title. The Cougars!
of Washington State will provide the j
opposition this Saturday at Berkeley,
and a week from Saturday the Wash
ington Huskies come "down from the
north" to tackle the Golden Bear in
the California Memorial Stadium. Fol
lowing these two games the Bruins
will tangle with the Cardinal of Stan- ■
ford in the annual "Big Game" at the |
Stanford stadium.
The Californians are not expecting
to have very much trouble against the
Cougars this week for last week the
Washington University eleven defeated (
them by a 23 to 0 score. The sad weak
ness in the offensive department of the j
Cougars makes them the choice to lose
although the defense is strong, being
founded upon a 185-pound line.
The only points scored this season
by the Cougars in the Conference race
came as the result of three field goals I
which defeated Montana 9 to 0.
In all probability all attempts to
score against the husky Bear line Sat-j
urday will be futile, although the Cou
gars may slip over a field goal.
The game with Washington Univer
sity a week from Saturday is already
crowding the Cougar contest off the J
stage for the game between the Bears
and Huskies last year is still indelibly j
printed upon the memories of Cali
fornia followers. Last season Washing I
ton held the Bears to a 7 to 7 tie, and
both teams seem to be evenly matched
this year.
