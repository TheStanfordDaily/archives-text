# SMALL TOWN START FOR LAWYERS BEST SAYS JOHN M'NAB

"A man just out of law school and
seeking to establish himself in the
profession should not start in a large
city, but should build up his reputation
first in a small town," says John L.
McNab, California lawyer and orator.
"Success in a profession is largely
due to wide acquaintanceship which it
is impossible to form in a city of
many thousands. With a reputation
once made, the successful lawyer can
move anywhere and establish a prac
tice. This is well illustrated by the
career of Clarence Darrow."
The law has opened an excellent
field to women, according to McNab.
"Women lawyers are as capable as
men but not so effective in the courts.
This is because juries do not respond
to them. The most promising law field
at present open to women is probate
law.
"I have a great personal revulsion to
the taking of human life for any
crime," continued McNab. "I sincerely
believe that life imprisonment without
parole is a far heavier sentence, but
I do not unconditionally advocate the
abolition of capital punishment." Mc-
Nab believes it is not the type of pun
ishment that follows the individual
crime that deters the criminal, but the
absolute certainty that punshment will
follow.
"The swift action taken in criminal
cases in England is the chief reason
why there is so much less crime in
proportion to the population there than
in the United States. A case that would
take three weeks in the United States
is, as a rule, put through in England in
a day and a half or two days. The
English courts have been trained by
centuries of tradition to regard the
criminal without sympathy. Therefore
they do not get involved in the maze
of sentimentality which at present pre
vails in American courts. The ques
tion is solely whether the prisoner is
guilty, if so is he sane, and what shall
be the punishment."
