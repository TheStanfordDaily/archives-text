### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Another week-end approaches with a fine assortment of prize football
packages! Look over the assortment and take your pj,ek, for there are inter
sectional and sectional battles of rare merit. Among the former are the Yale-
Maryland set-to at New Haven, the Boston College-West Virginia struggle at
Boston, and the Penn State-Notre Dame battle at State College. That Maryland j
will be no set-up for the Bulldog was proved by her 16-0 defeat of Rutgers, and j
the clash between Bezdek's and Rockne's warriors will be worth going miles !
to see.
The pop-eyed football fans of the East will be all agog over the first of the!
"Big Three" games, Princeton meeting Harvard at Princeton. Johnny Harvard j
hasn't forgotten that 34 to 0 trimming he took from the claws of the Tiger :
last year, and with Major Daly's assistance at Cambridge this fall, the result I
should be much more favorable to the Crimson.
The Dartmouth-Cornell game is another choice morsel in the East, while out j
in the Big Ten region there are three or four contests that promise many :
thrills. Chicago tries for the last time to stop the famous Grange—this time j
at Champaign; Northwestern, with Baker, will attempt to hold the strong:
Michigan team; while lowa meets Wisconsin at lowa City.
And so it goes all over the country; everywhere are games of great!
importance in sectional rating. Can Pop Warner's Stanford team beat Bag-1
shaw's Washington Huskies in their own back yard? Will U. S. C., now under
Howard Jones, beat little Santa Clara more than Stanford and California |
beat her?
Can Vanderbilt stop the Golden Tornado? Will Baylor beat Texas? Oh, to,
be everywhere at once!
