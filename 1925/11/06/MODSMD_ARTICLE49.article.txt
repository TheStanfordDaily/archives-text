With the abolition of freshman disci- j
pline went the old Stanford spirit. In 1
1923 the last remnant of the old pep j
vanished. I do not imply that freshman i
discipline of itself is necessarily a'
good thing, but it supplied a bond of'
interest which is now lacking in the
student body. When freshmen enter!
the University they usually enter with
the seed of wonderful loyalty and!
spirit, but when they find that the;
upper classes do not care enough for j
Stanford to enforce her traditions, the
tree fails to grow.
It takes men of exceptional qualities I
of personality and character to make!
the impression of the paddle. Not;
enough men of this character exist in'
any student body. It is too thankless'
a job to fire a freshman from the law
steps, only to have him tell you to go
to hell, and to have the rest of the
students nearby laugh it off.
It is necessary to implant the Stan
ford spirit the day the freshman ar
rives. If it cannot be done with pad
dles, the next best way is to treat the
offender with contempt.
The question is, are there enough I
loyal old-timers now in the University
to do this? If so, let's get started on;
'29 and in the course of a few years we j
may get back to the priceless loyaltv i
which once beat in the breast of every;
Stanford man. â€”F. 8., '26. j
