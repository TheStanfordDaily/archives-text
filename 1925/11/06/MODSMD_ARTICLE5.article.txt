# STANFORD RESERVES WILL MEET BEARS IN FINAL CONTEST
## Grays Handicapped by Loss Of Chances to Play in Scheduled Games 
### 
Coach Hal Davis and his Grays will
leave tomorrow morning at 8 o'clock
for Berkeley, where they play the Cali
fornia Reserves in a preliminary game
to the California-Washington State con
test.
No comparison can be made between
the two teams, except that the California
outfit has been playing consistently good
games every week, while tlie Stanford
team has had no contests at all. The
Cardinal Grays have some strong men
on the team, but due to the lack of
games, they will be slated as the under
dogs against the Bear extras.
Use Rockne Shift
Under Bill Nichelmann's coaching, the
California Goofs have been using the
Notre Dame shift, and are fairly pro
ficient in Rockne's art. Van Horn is the
outstanding backfield player, passing well
and making plenty of yardage around
end. Clymer and Mills have both seen
varsity competition, and are counted on
to make good gains.
The Grays' line averages 183 pounds
and is a very efficient defensive machine.
The pivot position, held down by Kenny
Graham, is particularly strong, as Gra
ham rarely makes a bad pass to the back
field and is fast on the defense. Sy
tnonds, who plays left guard, is the
heaviest, and probably the most valuable
man on the line; he weighs about 191
pounds and has pushed that 191 through
every line he has met so far this year.
Arata, at the other guard, is a light
man, but is speedy and gets his share
of the plays.
Morley Is Steady
The best two tackles are Evans and
Morley; Evans is a brilliant player at
times, but not consistent, while Morley
is steadier and correspondingly slower.
At ends, Davis has placed Antonelle, who
was appointed captain for the game, and
Davidson, both of whom were on last
year's freshman team, and know football.
Macabee was shifted from the line
to quarterback in the early part of the
season and has been playing good foot
ball all year. Wolf and Cowan, the
starting halfbacks, are both tricky run
ners. Wolf does the punting and a good
percentage of the passing; his kicks
average around forty yards. Ralph
Young, who will start at fullback, was
all-state fullback in Utah high school
circles two years ago, but did not go out
for freshman football last year. He has
been developing rapidly all season and
promises to play a first-class game.
The startling line-up will be: Left end,
Antoncll; left tackle, Evans; left guard,
Symonds; center, Graham; right guard,
Arata; right tackle, Morley; right end,
Davidson; quarterback, Macabee; left
halfback, Wolf; right halfback, Cowan;
fullback, Young.
