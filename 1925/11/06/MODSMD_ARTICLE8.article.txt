"The American army was very gen

letting out military secrets."

Switzerland into Germany. Just after
he arrived there an order was issued
that no more foreign press representa
tives should be admitted to the country.
There were only about four American
newspaper men in all Germany at the
time.
"In Berlin itself there was a small
war then," said Taylor. "Three govern
ments were working at the same time,
each with its army and its headquarters:
the Kaiser's faction, the republic, and the
communists." All three, according to
Taylor, were anxious for the favor of
the foreign correspondents ,and all of
fered them help.
Taylor was at the convention which
established the present German Repub
lic, and he was among the correspon
dents who interviewed the new president.
From Germany, Taylor went on to
Russia, where he was arrested and de
tained as a prisoner for some time.

to Finland, where he was again impris
oned. He escaped and gained the pro
tection of the British consul, who pro
cured him passage out of Finland. On
