Never So Many
Lovely Handkerchiefs
"Too lovely for words!" You'll sigh when you see
them, for hankies seem to excel even themselves this
year. Feminine ones, in white or gay colors, made ex
quisite with handwork and lace. Masculine kerchiefs,
with perhaps his initial in the corner. And wee little
ones, with queer figures trooping about to amuse the
youngsters. And whether your purse permits only
half-a-dozen plain linen ones, or the most fairylike of
hand-made affairs, we know you'll be pleased with
your purchase here, because our Christmas assortment
is very large and varied in style and quality. And above
all, economically priced.
