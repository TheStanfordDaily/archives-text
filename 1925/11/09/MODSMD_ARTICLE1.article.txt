# CARDINAL MERMEN NAB P. A. A. TITLE WITH THREE FIRSTS
## Olympic Club Defeated in Relay; O'Connor, Allen, Fall Win Events 
### 
Stanford swimmers won both the
final P. A. A. meet and the P. A. A.
team championship for the year when
they took three out of four first places
in the events held at the Athens Club
of Oakland last Friday night. By de
feating the strong Olympic Club with
a 61 to 49 score in a series of four
meets, the Cardinal aquatic team
showed strength that should make
them the likely prospects for the na
tional collegiate title this year.
Starting tlie meet with the odds
against them the local men placed
consistently and piled up 26 points for
the meet against the Olympic Club's 23
which were obtained largely from sec
onds and thirds. They took the 400-
yard relay by a good margin, each man
gaining on his "Winged O" rival, the
time bein 4:03 4-5.
Wally O'Connor, whose eligibility
was established just in time for the
mefet, won the 100-yard free-style from
Jack Robertson in 57 3-5 seconds. Rob
ertson led up to the first SO-yard mark
when O'Connor uncorked a sprint which
took him across the line for victory.
Paul de Silva, Olympic Club, was third.
Another brilliant last-minute spurt
was made by Arden Allen, who came
up from behind to tie Frank Walton,
Olympic Club, in the 150-yard back
stroke after trailing him until the last
50 feet. Carl Stevenson took a third
for Stanford. The time was 1:53 2-5, by
far the best that Allen has yet made
in this event.
Dave Fall accounted for another
first by beating Guerton Carrol of the
Olympic Club in the 10-foot diving. Fall
â– was in excellent form and was super
ior to Carrol, although he won the
decision by the narrow margin of 2-10
of a point. De Stariah, O. C., was third.
Bob Williams took third in the 50-yard
i'ree-style, being beaten by Don Brophy,
O. C., first, and Eddie Kamoku, Idora,
second. The time was 25 5-10.
At the start of the relay, the decid
ing event between Stanford and the
Olympic Club, it was found that, while
three of the clubmen had been kept out
of races and were fresh, the Cardinal
relay men had taken part in one or
more races. Bob Williams swam the
first hundred for Stanford and gained
several feet on Frank Mooney, the
club swimmer. Carl Stevenson put
more distance between himself and
Toots Gardner on the next lap, and
Arden Allen made several feet on
George Mitchell, so that O'Connor was
not forced to extend himself to come
in 5 or 6 yards ahead of George Schroth
in the last lap. Third place was taken
in the relay by the Elks Club of San
Francisco.
