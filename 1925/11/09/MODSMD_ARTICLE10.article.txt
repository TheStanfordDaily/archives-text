# CARD SOCCER TEAM DOWNS RUSSIAN A.C. WITH NEW LINEUP
## 
### 
Using a changed line-up which ma
terially strengthened the defense, the
Stanford varsity soccer team Saturday
defeated the Russians, a San Francisco
team, by a score of 1 to 0. Quigley, in
side left, scored the winning goal for
the Cards.
Dave Clark, a regular fullback last
year, who has been kept out of the games
this season by injuries, returned to the
line-up Saturday, replacing Holmes at
left fullback. Holmes was shifted to
left half in place of Cannon. The new
combination seems to work well, and con
stitutes a great improvement over the de
fensive work of the early season games.
The game Saturday is the last before
the first tilt of the California scries,
which will be held Saturday afternoon
at Berkeley.
The Stanford line-up was as follows:
0.1., Schoen; i.1., Quigley; c.f,, Strowger;
1.r., Bailard; 0.r., Miron; 1.h.b., Holmes;
c.h.b., Franklin; r.h.b., Bushnell; 1.f.b.,
Clark; r.f.b., Stollery; goal, Gray.
