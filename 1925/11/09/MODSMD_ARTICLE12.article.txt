# VARSITY DEBATERS PRIMED FOR DUAL CONTEST WITH U.C.
## Stanford Speakers to Meet California at Berkeley Tomorrow Night 
### 
"Is Democracy an Illusion" will be
the subject for the annual dual debate
between Stanford and the University
of California. Stanley A. Weigel and
Charles C. Scott will represent Stan
ford at Berkeley tomorrow evening,
supporting the negative of the ques
tion, while George N. Crocker and Fred
M. Combellack will uphold the affirm
ative in the debate in the Stanford
Assembly Hall Wednesday evening. No
admission will be charged.
Representatives of the two institu
tions arranged the question in order
to give a clear discussion of the ques
tion, rather than to argue on debating
technicalities. Modern critics have dis
cussed the question, advancing opin
ions that "democracy" is an illusion â€”
a false concept that has not been
realized. Conditions prevailing in the
United States today of graft, corrup
tion, lack of representation, and other
political evils are pointed to in the
effort to explain the falsity of Ameri
ca's belief in democracy.
The University debaters will en
deavor to either support or destroy the
validity of these views. An audience
decision will be taken on the merits
of the question.
Members of the two Stanford teams
have been practicing daily in prepara
tion for the contests. Henry A. Shinn,
who has taken the place of Professor
J. G. Emerson for two quarters, is di
recting the Cardinal varsity men.
A varsity debate with Cambridge is
a possibility, according to Theodore F.
Baer, debating manager. Arrangements
are being made with Cambridge au
thorities to place Stanford on the de
bating schedule for this year. Contests
with Nevada and the University of
Southern California will be held dur
ing the winter quarter. The debating
season will close with the annual
Joffre Debate with the University of
California, which is considered the
foremost intercollegiate forensic con
test on the Pacific Coast. Stanford,
represented by Knox Miller, Bertrand
Comparet, Robert Littler, and John
Duniway, have been judged winners
of the contest in the last four years.
