# ALLEN TO PRESENT NEW SELECTIONS IN ORGAN RECITAL
## 
### 
Warren D. Allen, University organ
: ist, will present a program with sev
| eral numbers new to the campus in
j the Memorial Church tomorrow after
j noon at 4:15 o'clock.
i "Elegie" will be played for the first
[ time at Allen's recitals. It is the work
| of Jean Sibelius, a Finnish composer
j of note. Sibelius' music is marked by
j national feeling. He is probably best
i known to the American public by his
' patriotic tone-poem, "Finlandia." He
j ranks with Edvard Griez as the great
i est among Northern composers.
The opening number will be "Dieu
| dea Armees," by Charles V. Alkan,
! arranged for the organ by Cesar
I Franck. "God of the Armies," as the
| title translates into English, is one of
J a series of "Prieres" by Alkan, who
| was one of the most intellectual of his
school of French composers.
"Funeral March and Seraphic
j Chant," a popular organ composition,
is by Alexander Guilmant, who lived
from 1837 to 1911. Guilmant composed
many organ works, including seven
â–  sonatas. He exercised great influence
' both as a performer and a composer
; on organ playing and music.
"Heroic Suite" by Alec Rowley is a
1 group of three numbers: "Heroic Post
lude," "Lament," and "Song of Tri
umph," all works of vigor and energy.
A week from tomorrow Allen will
give a program devoted entirely to the
works of Richard Wagner, the great
! German creator of the "music drama."
