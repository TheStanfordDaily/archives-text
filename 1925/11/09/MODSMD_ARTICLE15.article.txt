# SENIORS WIN CLASS TITLE FROM BABES IN FOOTBALL FRAY
## Freshman Backs Unable to Make Yardage Against Strong 1926 Line 
### 
Shoeing a good brand of football
the senior team won the University
interclass title Saturday morning by
defeating the freshmen in a 19-0 game.
Meanwhile, the sophomores were
trouncing the juniors, 20*-6, in the
play-off for third and fourth place in
the interclass standing.
The seniors exhibited a much better
style of play than they had shown in
previous games. The first-year backs
experienced a great deal of trouble in
their tries at the senior line while the
senior backs tore through the yearling
forward wall with little difficulty.
Both teams played evenly through
out the first quarter, but in the second
period the seniors suddenly came
through with flashy football, and from
then on outplayed the freshmen in
nearly every department of the game.
Starting with the ball in their posses
sion on their own 20-y,ard line the
seniors worked down the field by
means of line plays and end runs to
the freshman 3-yard line. On the next
play, Wolff, senior fullback, plunged
off tackle for the first score of the
game. Fuller's place kick for extra
point failed.
Seniors Again Score
The seniors scored again at the start
of the second half. McHose intercepted
a freshman pass and ran sixty-five
yards before being downed on the
freshman 8-yard line. Swede Leistner
then took the ball over on the old
end-around-end play. Fuller made the
score 13-0 with a perfect place kick.
The last score came in the fourth
period when McHose threw a pass
over the line to Fuller.
The sophomores showed a decidedly
improved game in their tussle with the
juniors. The second-year players had
a noticeable advantage over the slower
junior eleven, and seemed far superior
on both offense and defense.
Maythen Recovers
Things looked bad for the sopho
mores when the juniors blocked a kick
in the first quarter that resulted in the
first score of the game. Maythen
scooped the ball up and ran across the
line with the entire sophomore team
at his heels. The try for ( point failed.
A swarm of sophomore players
rushed a junior punter in the second
quarter and blocked his attempted
kick. Knowles grabbed the ball and
ran over the line for the touchdown
that evened the score. Moore made
the count 7-6 with a drop kick on the
try for point.
The sophomores opened the second
half with a determined march for the
junior goal that finally ended in a
touchdown when Knowles ran twenty
five yards around the end. Moore's
drop kick went wide on the conversion.
The final score came in the last
period. The second-year backs started
another march for the junior goal,
led by the brilliant runs of Knowles
and Moore. With the ball on the
junior's 23-yard line, Moore got loose
around right end for a clear run to
the goal line. His drop kick made the
final score 20-6.
