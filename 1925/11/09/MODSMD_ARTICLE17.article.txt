ON BOARD SHASTA LIMITED,
ASHLAND, ORE., Nov. B.—"We offer
no alibi, for Stanford was beaten by a
team that made no mistakes, and while
ours were few, they were costly,' Coach
"Pop" Warner said today in speaking of
the Washington game. "The trip north
and the rough field both led to Stanford's
defeat."
Soon after the game started the field
became torn up and playing on such a
field after being used to turf made a
great difference in speed and accuracy
of playing. Cleats were wrenched from
the shoes due to the rocky field and this
led to the team's losing traction and mis
judging tackle after tackle.
Poulson's left arm was severely dis
located at the elbow and he will be out
of the game for the rest of the season,
Nevers playd a hard game and was hit
harder than ever before. Besides being
rather jarred and slightly bruised he
was not injured, although he was taken
from the game in the last few minutes
when it was thought that his hip was
fractured.

giving the Cardinal leader a pounding
and battering such as he had never ex
perienced.
Washington crossed the line for its
first score in the beginning of the second
quarter, following a straight drive from
mid-field. The northerners had held the
offensive almost all the opening quarter
and continued through the next period,
with all the playing in Stanford territory.
Cards fviiss Opportunity
Stanford had its big chance to score
in the third quarter. The attack was
working effectively and smash after
smash put the ball within nine yards of
the final line. A touchdown then would
have meant a tie score and converting
the extra point would give Stanford the
lead, 7 to 6. With a one-point, margin
the Card would have played a more con
servative game, waiting for Washington
to make the first move. Instead, Mur
