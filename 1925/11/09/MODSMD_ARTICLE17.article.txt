## Poulson Out for Year With Dislocated Elbow; Nevers Slightly Bruised

(Special Dispatch to the Daily Palo Alto)
ON BOARD SHASTA LIMITED,
ASHLAND, ORE., Nov. B.—"We offer
no alibi, for Stanford was beaten by a
team that made no mistakes, and while
ours were few, they were costly,' Coach
"Pop" Warner said today in speaking of
the Washington game. "The trip north
and the rough field both led to Stanford's
defeat."
Soon after the game started the field
became torn up and playing on such a
field after being used to turf made a
great difference in speed and accuracy
of playing. Cleats were wrenched from
the shoes due to the rocky field and this
led to the team's losing traction and mis
judging tackle after tackle.
Poulson's left arm was severely dis
located at the elbow and he will be out
of the game for the rest of the season,
Nevers playd a hard game and was hit
harder than ever before. Besides being
rather jarred and slightly bruised he
was not injured, although he was taken
from the game in the last few minutes
when it was thought that his hip was
fractured.

SEATTLE, WASH., Nov. B.—Out
played, the Stanford men went down be
fore the power of the Huskies in the
Washington University stadium here yes
terday when the northerners piled up a
score of 13 to 0. Despite the power
and resistance of Captain Ernie Nevers.
the Huskies forced their way to victory,
giving the Cardinal leader a pounding
and battering such as he had never ex
perienced.
Washington crossed the line for its
first score in the beginning of the second
quarter, following a straight drive from
mid-field. The northerners had held the
offensive almost all the opening quarter
and continued through the next period,
with all the playing in Stanford territory.
Cards fviiss Opportunity
Stanford had its big chance to score
in the third quarter. The attack was
working effectively and smash after
smash put the ball within nine yards of
the final line. A touchdown then would
have meant a tie score and converting
the extra point would give Stanford the
lead, 7 to 6. With a one-point, margin
the Card would have played a more con
servative game, waiting for Washington
to make the first move. Instead, Mur
phy made three yards on a criss-cross,
Nevers went through guard for two
more, and on the next play he was j
stopped. Then came the pass over the j
line with no Stanford men within reach- i
ing distance.
Washington was then out of danger j
and had possession of the hall on its own
20-yard line. When Stanford gained j
the ball again it was necessary to open
up in an effort to regain the lost distance
and put over a touchdown.
One of the passes in the attack in the j
fourth quarter fell into the arms of
Louie Tesreau, who fought himself clear
and started his forty-five-yard dash for
a score. Hill, who hud thrown the ball, j
was waiting for Tesreau, who was fight- j
ing through a mass of players. Vlill j
hurled himself fearlessly at the great (
back bearing down upon him, only ro
meet a straight arm that laid him cold, j
Tesreau raced for the touchdown.
Sherman kicked the goal and Wash
ington had the game sewed up, 13 to 0. i
Nevers Plays Hard
Ernie Nevers played his hardest game !
and took his worst beating of his career, j
Just after Stanford had started the drive 1
in the third period Nevers was met by j
Wilson and Tesreau, who knocked the j
Card leader so hard that Nevers was out j
for three minutes. At the end of that I
time he was up and in the fray again.
Finally, in the closing period, he was
forced from the gam? with what was |
thought to be a fraclurcd hip. Then the
handful of Stanford rooters knew their
chances were gene and the game was
practically over.
The credit for the Washington victory
so<ss to the Tesreau brothers. Elmer laid
Nevers low on one play when a gain
would have meant a Stanford victory
and his brother Louis cinched matters for
the Huskies in the last quarter when he
dashed through the field for a touch
down after an intercepted pass.
Nevers stood out with his wonderful
defensive work and bis making many a
substantial gain despite bis defeat.
