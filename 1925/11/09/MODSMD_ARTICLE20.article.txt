# A 						Bad Day for the Red
## 
### 
A double defeat on the gridiron last Saturday, coming' as it did at the
peak of the football season, has caused a gloom of disappointment to settle
over the campus. The freshmen put up a good fight, but a couple of naps
resulted in their sudden and swift downfall. Still, their season was suc
cessful in the one thing it meant to accomplish—a number of good men
have been developed who will be valuable for the varsity in future years.
This is of a greater importance than a first-year victory over California
because its effects are more far reaching.
As for the varsity, no alibi can be offered. A strange field, coupled
with different playing conditions and a few mistakes, proved a Waterloo.
The Huskies played hard, flawless football, confident within the familiar
conditions of their stadium.
If things break right for the Cards, they can still end the season in a
tie for conference honors. Should California defeat Washington, some
thing it has a good chance to do, and if the Redshirts rub the Bruin's nose
in the dirt on November 21—a reasonable probability—then Stanford
will still be on top of the standing.
There is nothing to cry about now. Stanford should rally behind the
Blue and Gold Saturday and help it to triumph over the northern in
vaders. Then, on November 21, the Cards can win back and enhance
their deserved prestige by a decisive defeat of Andy Smith's charges.
