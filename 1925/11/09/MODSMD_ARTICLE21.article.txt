# Swimming Laurels

Coach Ernst Brandsten's swimmers have won the P.A.A. champion
ship, and in doing so have outclassed a group of the West's finest swim
mers who were wearing the Winged 'O' of the San Francisco Olympic
Club. This victory is a credit to the' abilities of Coach Brandsten and
should be a source of satisfaction to the entire student body. The Stan
ford coach, who has done so much for local swimmers and divers, must
be congratulated upon his victory.
The victory of the local swimmers is also an indication that Stanford
has a team that not only has possibilities, but that has "arrived," and
accordingly is capable of holding its own with the best in intercollegiate
competition. The San Francisco Chroniclc concedes Stanford the
supremacy among Pacific Coast universities.
Because of the P.A.A. victory it seems only fair to the swimmers and
their coach that efforts be made to send the Cardinal mermen East in
quest of the National Intercollegiate championship. Indications point to
a Stanford swimming team superior to any college aggregation in the
country, and when such a fine collection of swimmers is on hand, it will
be a pity if they cannot be given a chance to win the Nation's greatest
swimming honors for Stanford.
