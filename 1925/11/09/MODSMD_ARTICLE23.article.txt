## 
###

be doubled in size, and two new tar
gets will be set up in the near future,
according to a recent provision of the
Women's Physical Education depart
ment. This will give the department
four targets and make it possible for
sixteen people to compete at once.

classes is the cause for the extension
of the field. The Women's Athletic
Association has voted an appropriation
to help the department pay for the
improvements.
The longest run of the 1925 football
season was made by a Syracuse full
back. It was 97 yards.
Only men are allowed to operate
