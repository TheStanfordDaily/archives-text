About Mid-Quarters and
Things in General
Definition —The term mid-quarter iB
a compound word of mid from the
Latin midus which means middle or;
half, and the Greek word quartra
which means V* or one cut up iuto
four pieces.
The word as a whole may be given
four interpretations.
1. One-lialf of one quarter or one
eighth.
2. One-half divided by one quarter or
two.
3. One-half plus one-quarter or three
quarters.
4. One-half minus one-quarter or
one-quarter.
Thus it is evident that the word
mid-quarter may mean anything from
one-eigth to two.
If we multiply any of these numbers
by fifty we shall obtain the grades
most frequently made in mid-quarter
examinations.
If we multiply our favorite of these
four numbers by ten dollars we shall
be able to predict what the amount
of our syllabus fees for this quarter
will be.
If this interpretation is correct, ac
tual pieces of pie are quarters, while
the pieces that are dispensed at most
campus dining tables are only mid
quarters.
It is probable that the double shock
a student experiences when he opens
his syllabus fee statement and receives
back his corrected examination paper
at the same time accounts for the in
terpretation "two" given to the word
mid-quarter.
The meaning "three quarters" given
to this mystic word probably connotes
the fact that these hair-raising exami
nations are given in each of the three
quarters of the year.
Finally, if we suppose that the inter
pretation of one quarter is correct we
are forced to conclude that this repre
sents the maximum amount of money
ever bet on the results of mid-quarter
examinations.
No other interpretations are possi
ble, for if we flip a coin it can fall in
one only of two ways, either heads or
tails. This is the basic principle of
mid-quarters.
* * *
We are thankful that a quarter can
have only one middle.

Those who flunked their mid-quar
ters will undoubtedly be glad to hear
that paper of a deeper shade of blue
is being used this year for cinch
notices so that it will be in greater
accord with the feelings of the ones
who received them.
* * *
Contrary to all reports no mid-quar
ters will be given on November 21 and
22.

Definition —The term mid-quarter iB
a compound word of mid from the
Latin midus which means middle or;
half, and the Greek word quartra
which means V* or one cut up iuto
four pieces.
The word as a whole may be given
four interpretations.
1. One-lialf of one quarter or one
eighth.
2. One-half divided by one quarter or
two.
3. One-half plus one-quarter or three
quarters.
4. One-half minus one-quarter or
one-quarter.
Thus it is evident that the word
mid-quarter may mean anything from
one-eigth to two.
If we multiply any of these numbers
by fifty we shall obtain the grades
most frequently made in mid-quarter
examinations.
If we multiply our favorite of these
four numbers by ten dollars we shall
be able to predict what the amount
of our syllabus fees for this quarter
will be.
If this interpretation is correct, ac
tual pieces of pie are quarters, while
the pieces that are dispensed at most
campus dining tables are only mid
quarters.
It is probable that the double shock
a student experiences when he opens
his syllabus fee statement and receives
back his corrected examination paper
at the same time accounts for the in
terpretation "two" given to the word
mid-quarter.
The meaning "three quarters" given
to this mystic word probably connotes
the fact that these hair-raising exami
nations are given in each of the three
quarters of the year.
Finally, if we suppose that the inter
pretation of one quarter is correct we
are forced to conclude that this repre
sents the maximum amount of money
ever bet on the results of mid-quarter
examinations.
No other interpretations are possi
ble, for if we flip a coin it can fall in
one only of two ways, either heads or
tails. This is the basic principle of
mid-quarters.
* * *
We are thankful that a quarter can
have only one middle.

Those who flunked their mid-quar
ters will undoubtedly be glad to hear
that paper of a deeper shade of blue
is being used this year for cinch
notices so that it will be in greater
accord with the feelings of the ones
who received them.

Contrary to all reports no mid-quar
ters will be given on November 21 and
22.
