# Guerard to Give Address On French Decorative Art
## 
### 
"L'Association ties Arts decoratifs"
will be the central topic of a talk to
be given by Professor Albert Leon
Guerard before the French Club to
morrow night at 8 o'clock in the Wo
men's Clubhouse. The meeting is to
be held tomorrow instead of Wednes
day to avoid conflict with the debate
with California.
Professor Guerard has returned to
the Stanford faculty this quarter after
an absence of twelve years, during
which time he was at Rice Institute,
Houston, Jexas, and at the Southern
Branch of the University of California.
He was formerly assistant professor
of French here, but is now associated
with the English department as pro
fessor of general literature, and is
giving courses in Napoleonic legend,
literature, and civilization. He will be
a permanent member of the faculty.
As an addition to the program, the
club will sing some French songs. Re
freshments will be served at the close
of the meeting.
