# RANDALL AND SCHWARTZ STAR IN POPULAR COMEDY
## 
### Isabel Schanck 
Aside from the fact that "The Goose
j Hangs High" is a play suitable for
I campus production, Friday's presenta
tion of the popular comedy was for
| tunate in having an appreciative audi
epce, and two such outstanding stars
las Velma Randall and Leonard
Schwartz in the cast to contribute to
its success.
Profiting by their experience in dra
matics last year both Miss Randall
and Schwartz gave excellent perform
ances as the twins, Lois and Bradley j
Ingals. Miss Randall's charm was even
more apparent than in "Dulcy," the j
sophomore play in which she made'
her debut last year. Schwartz also took j
his role with ease and naturalness.
The most difficult role in "The j
Goose Hangs High" Avas that of Ber- j
nard Ingals, the father of the twins, j
played by Robert Carr. Carr gave an j
unusual and extremely well-done in- i
terpretation of a role which might j
easily have been blatant, and instead
was commendably reserved.
Eleanor Davidson as Mrs. Bradley,
the grandmother, was outstanding
among the new talent in the cast. Her
acting showed character and original-;
ity, which will undoubtedly be valuable j
in campus dramatics to come.

. Carolyn Grossman and Wilbert Ham-
I mond did good bits of characterization
in the roles of the society woman and
her son. Robert Clendenin and Jose
phine Piggot as Hugh Ingals and Dag
! mar Carroll had parts which were
rather overshadowed by the twins, but
| were well taken.
Eunice Ingals, mother of the twins,
i was played by Julia North, also a new
i comer to Stanford dramatics. Miss
| North had a very difficult role which
i was overdone in its sentimentality.
| Lowell Matthay, Jacob Irwin, and
[ Charles Smith had small characteriza
tions which were all well handled.
"The Goose Hangs High" contains
much humor and a certain realism in
the views of home life of collegians
which cannot but appeal to a campus
audience. The theme is similar to that
of "You and I," though less subtley
done, it has the advantage of more
probable ending.
Lack of finish was the most obvious
fault, and caused several spots to drag
unnecessarily. Gordon Davis, director
of the play, very evidently needed an
other week to work his new cast into
shape. As it was, some of the new
actors dropped out of character once
or twice, and by contrast the more ex
perienced ones seemed even more
finished.
