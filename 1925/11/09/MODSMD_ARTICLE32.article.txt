# CAMPUS OPINION

iThe Editor, Sir:
It is a well-known fact that little or
nothing can be accomplished by a
student body without organization.
Those who cry out in despair at the
present lack of Stanford spirit should
get organized and see what can be
done to remedy this situation as fresh
men walking up the law steps, and
failing to say "Hello .Gents" are ef
fectually annihilated in other colleges
by sophomore discipline. Your recent
editorial, "Spirit—Where Is It?" asks
"Are we over-legislated?" The majority
say "Yes!" The abolition of sophomore
discipline is their proof, and a just one,
| too.
Such matters as failing to attend
! rallies and to sit in the rootjng section
j are other matters of personal choice
j and depend largely on the individual.
llf we have in our midst the type of
| individual who is thus lacking in spirit
jwe can only lament the presence of
j such slackers here.
I would suggest a "spirit meeting"
to organize those students who have
spirit to fight this "slacker germ"
which is diseasing our college.

j The Editor, Sir:
In several recent issues of the Daily
II have noticed articles relating to the
new Literary Magazine. In all of these
articles there lias been emphasized the
fact that subscriptions are a crying
need. If this is so, may I be permitted
to ask how subscriptions to this maga
j zine may be obtained?
There are undoubtedly many people
in the University who, like myself, are
new here and unacquainted with the
various editors and business managers
mentioned in connection with the
magazine. It is undoubtedly true, too,
that some of these many new people
may be interested in the magazine and
would like to subscribe to it. Are we to
be kept away from it because we don't
know some of the campus literary
lights or may we too be allowed to get
in on the fun? Is the Lit to be a
public affair, or is it to be a select
thing open only to a favored few? If
such is the case, why not announce it?
I've been looking for the consarned
thing for a week and I can't find it
anywhere, so I'm appealing to the edi
tors through this column in the hope
! that someone may become aware of
i my plight and take pity on me.
Sincerely, Bob Sears.
| The Editor, Sir:
Our already'badly-dented reputations
,have been dealt a crushing blow. We
are becoming highbrows.
One day last week a Certain Student
was seen climbing the steps of the Art
Gallery. The fact that he remarked, "I
l surely hope no one catches me doing
■ this!" should in no way alleviate his
i guilt. For the 'steenth time Public
Opinion gasps, "May I ask you, what
ARE we coming to?"
Somewhat more seriously, what are
the reasons for the Art Gallery's being
the best spot on the Farm for a quiet
i nap, unexcelled even by the Museum?
One may be that the average student,
i while knowing by heart, a list of Old
| Masters taught him in the sixth grade,
i.will tell you that he rates Coles Phil
' lips and Maxfield Parrish as the great
! est exponents of modern painting—
i anything beyond them being Highbrow
and All Wet. Another is that he (the
I average student again) does not know!
I that three-fourths of the pictures in j
the Gallery are from temporary collec-'
tions and change from month to month. |
A third is that the work on exhibition, 1
while no doubt the best procurable I
with student interest a negative quan
tity. is usually indifferent or worse and
in no way represents modern tenden
cies in art. The last reason is one that
can be easily remedied —the Daily I
Palo Alto never publishes any criti- j
cisms of that work. (Perhaps it lias
never had any to publish.)
There may be no fit critics on the!
campus—it is doubtful that there are
any, anywhere. But the frank opinion
of some self-appointed Ruskin, even
of one as unworthy as myself, would at
least call forth a response from an
ardent viewpointer; the campus might
be induced to take sides and even go
to look at the criticized paintings.
There you have the vicious circle
bashed in, student interest aroused,
better collections obtainable, more rea
sons for visiting the Art Gallery.
Nothing would give me greater
pleasure than to dip my pen in vitriol
in such a cause, and I have no doubt
that, there are others who feel the
same. Is anyone else on the boat, or
off the dime, or what have you?
Sincerely, T. C.
