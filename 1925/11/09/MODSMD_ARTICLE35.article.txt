# YALE HAS MOVIES
## 
### 
Yale University has prepared a
series of appropriate motion pictures
for a history course which has been
approved by the faculty. This is an
attempt to determine how motion pic
tures may best be used to help in the
teaching of American history.

Threatening to strike, students at
Wabash College are attending indigna-1
tion meetings and lashing the trustees i
through the student press. The trouble {
lies in a recent announcement by the '
college president that no student may j
drive u car after eiglit o'clock Friday j
nights. The student body has unani- !
mously voted to strike if any violator
of the rule is expelled from college.
