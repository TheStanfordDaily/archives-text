# PROFESSOR COOVER CONDUCTS STUDY OF SPIRIT PHENOMENA
## Ectoplasm Is Chief Problem Puzzling Students of Psychic Research

Investigation of the possibility of |
thought transference, and of spirit I
mediums and seance phenomena has f
been part of the work of the Psych- j
ology department since 1912 under the j
leadership of John E. Coover, fellow j
in Psychic Research and assistant pro- !
fessor of Psychology.
The study of mental telepathy begins ;
with the everyday forms, such as an j
individual turning around because of I
his consciousness of someone's regard- j
ing him, or willing an individual's ac- j
tions, and goes on to the more compli- ;
cated forms of premonition and ;
psychic information. In these latter j
forms, the person receives information j
concerning something which has hap- j
pened or is about to happen, or gen- j
eral knowledge which he could not get j
through ordinary channels.
Clairvoyancy Defined
Clairvoyancy is distinguished from ;
telepathy in that the information re-:
ceived cannot be obtained from the ,
ordinary sources or gathered from an
other person's mind. The commercial |
so-called clairvoyancy with reputable j
mediums is lately highely developed ;
telepathy. The medium's mind may be j
likened to a finely tuned receiving in-;
strument.
Professor Coover says that in the j
investigation of seance phenomena, i
definite scientific data is very difficult
to procure. Few mediums will consent
to make tests in a scientific laboratory
under the conditions which the experi- j
menter desires. In most seance tests, i
the tests are made under conditions
wholly under the control of the me
dium and the so-called spirits. Coover
has made several scientific seance ex
periments in the Stanford laboratories,
the results of which have been nega-1
tive.
Most of the "ghosts" seen and re
ported during the last hundred years, '
Coover belieyes, are merely sensory
illusions. Optical and auditory illusions |
are the most common. The eye, given
a certain outline, and the ear a famil-!
iar sound, furnish the imagination ,
with a definite picture which seems I
to the possessor to be reflected on the I
retina. Experiences of this sort are
common; seeing "persons" in dimly lit I
and empty rooms being a familiar illu
sion.
Ectoplasm Is Problem
The fairies and shadowy figures j
which have been discover in the mot
tled backgrounds of certain photo
graphs, Coover thinks are chiefly opti-:
cal illusions. He says that, given suf
ficient combinations of lights and i
shadows in a picture, practically any- j
one can find a face. Photographs of j
spirits made in groups of living people I
Coover claims are fakes.
Psychic experimenters cannot as yet
give an explanation of ectoplasm. This j
is a substance which is occasionally 1
emanated by mediums, turning from j
a gas to a vapor and then slowly thick
ening into a solid substance. The sub
stance sometimes assumes the shape |
of a human body or a human organ.
Samples of such ectoplasm have been
examined on the Atlantic coast, and in j
laboratory investigation have been
found to have the same composition j
as human or animal flesh and liair.
The foundations for psychic study
have just been laid. The study so far
has been crude and is not as depend
able as other scientific data, because i
all psychic phenomena is contrary to
the principles of certain established
sciences, and because the conditions
under which the study of most super
normal phenomena has been madej
have been unfavorable to the experi
menter.
Coover has been assisted in his re
search work at Stanford by advanced ;
students and his colleagues in the Psy
chology department.
