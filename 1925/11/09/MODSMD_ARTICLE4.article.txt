# GODDARD ACCEPTS POSITION AT STATE TEACHERS COLLEGE
## Leaves Office of Assistant Registrar After Four Years' Service 
### 
Charles Baldwin Goddard, for the past
four years assistant registrar at Stan
ford, has tendered his resignation to go
into effect December 1, when he will take
over the new position of Registrar at
the State Teachers' College at San Jose.
After receiving his A.B. degree at
Stanford in 1904, Goddard taught Eng
lish in various schools in St. Louis for
the following fourteen years. He at
tended the University of Wisconsin sum
mer school in 1910, and Washington Uni
versity at St. Louis in the summer of
1915.
At the opening of the world war God
dard joined the War Camp Community
service as District Representative. This
work took him through the various mili
tary camps in the South. Following the
armistice, he remained with the organi
zation which was now called the Com
munity Service Organization, and in his
position of District Representative cov
ered the territory from Key West, Fla.,
and Cheyenne, Wyo., to Brownsville,
Tex. In 1921 he came to Stanford and
has remained here since as assistant
registrar.
The San Jose Teachers College has
not yet had an official registrar, so Mr.
Goddard will be the first to hold that
position at the institution. Miss Henze
formerly held the position corresponding
to registrar, but since her resignation in
September the position has remained
vacant.
A successor to take Mr. Goddard's po
sition as assistant registrar here has not
yet been named.
