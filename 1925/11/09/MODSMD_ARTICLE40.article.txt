# MANY BARRED FROM RETURN TO COLLEGE BY LACK OF FUNDS
## 
### 
Lack of funds and unfavorable con
ditions for working out Individual per
sonal plans were the two main reasons
which kept students registered in 1923
from returning in 1924, according to
figures obtained from a questionnaire
sent out last year, the results of which
were disclosed in the registrar's an
nual report to the president. Fifty-one
replies were received from ninety-four
questionnaires sent out.
Of the fifty-one students who replied,
forty-two, or 82 per cent, entered with
the intention of continuing for a defi
nite time and until the completion of
a regular course. Two did not have
these definite intentions; seven failed
to answer the question.
Financial Factor Important
Lack of funds made necessary at
least temporary absence from college
of 45 per cent; this cause was partly
responsible in the cases of 6 per cent.
Forty-seven per cent were not hindered
from return by financial considera
tions. Illness was the direct cause of
non-return of 14 per cent more; 4 per
cent more were prevented from return
ing because of illness in the family.
The remaining 82 per cent definitely
ruled illness out by a negative answer
to the question.
The question as to how favorable the
conditions are at Stanford to working
out personal plans produced a variety
of answers. Twenty-five per cent defi
nitely stated that conditions were un
favorable, but made no explanation.
Two students reported the cost as too
great for them; another found insuffU
cient opportunity to earn his expenses;
still another was remaining out to earn
money "so conditions will be more
favorable." The original intention of
completing a college course still per
sists in the minds of 96 per cent of
these absentees, but 4 per cent express
a change in their ideas as to whether
or not a college education is worth
while.
Many Expect to Return
Expectation of return was expressed
by 63 per cent, uncertainty by 14 per
cent, while 23 per cent were definitely
remaining away. Attendance at some
other university was reported by 47
per cent, part time attendance by one
individual. Of the twenty-six not at
tending any university, six, or 23 per
cent, were planning to enter some
other college.
In 1923-24, SO5 new students were
admitted. Of these. 226 did not return
in the fall of 1924. About 32 per cent
of those not returning were accounted
for. Eighteen per cent were dropped
on account of scholarship; 10.6 per
cent received degrees; 3.1 per cent

were deceased or stayed out for family
reasons. Of the 68 per cent unaccount
ed for, 94 addresses were available,
and questionnaires were sent to them.

The question as to how favorable the
conditions are at Stanford to working
out personal plans produced a variety
of answers. Twenty-five per cent defi
nitely stated that conditions were un
favorable, but made no explanation.
Two students reported the cost as too
great for them; another found insuffU
cient opportunity to earn his expenses;
still another was remaining out to earn
money "so conditions will be more
favorable." The original intention of
completing a college course still per
sists in the minds of 96 per cent of
these absentees, but 4 per cent express
a change in their ideas as to whether
or not a college education is worth
while.
Many Expect to Return
Expectation of return was expressed
by 63 per cent, uncertainty by 14 per
cent, while 23 per cent were definitely
remaining away. Attendance at some
other university was reported by 47
per cent, part time attendance by one
individual. Of the twenty-six not at
tending any university, six, or 23 per
cent, were planning to enter some
other college.
In 1923-24, SO5 new students were
admitted. Of these. 226 did not return
in the fall of 1924. About 32 per cent
of those not returning were accounted
for. Eighteen per cent were dropped
on account of scholarship; 10.6 per
cent received degrees; 3.1 per cent

were deceased or stayed out for family
reasons. Of the 68 per cent unaccount
ed for, 94 addresses were available,
and questionnaires were sent to them.
Lack of funds and unfavorable con
ditions for working out Individual per
sonal plans were the two main reasons
which kept students registered in 1923
from returning in 1924, according to
figures obtained from a questionnaire
sent out last year, the results of which
were disclosed in the registrar's an
nual report to the president. Fifty-one
replies were received from ninety-four
questionnaires sent out.
Of the fifty-one students who replied,
forty-two, or 82 per cent, entered with
the intention of continuing for a defi
nite time and until the completion of
a regular course. Two did not have
these definite intentions; seven failed
to answer the question.
Financial Factor Important
Lack of funds made necessary at
least temporary absence from college
of 45 per cent; this cause was partly
responsible in the cases of 6 per cent.
Forty-seven per cent were not hindered
from return by financial considera
tions. Illness was the direct cause of
non-return of 14 per cent more; 4 per
cent more were prevented from return
ing because of illness in the family.
The remaining 82 per cent definitely
ruled illness out by a negative answer
to the question.
