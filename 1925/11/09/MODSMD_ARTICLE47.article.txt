# STANFORD GRAYS IN SCORELESS BATTLE WITH U. C. RESERVES
## Cardinal Squad Upsets Dope By Holding California Team in Tie Game 
### 
Holding the supposedly strong Cali
fornia Reserve team in check at all
times, but unable to unleash a scoring
drive, the Stanford Grays Saturday
played a scoreless tie with their Bear
rivals.
The Stanford team showed the lack
of early season games which would
have polished up the offense. On the
other hand, the defense, which had
been developed to a high point by fre
quent scrimmages with the varsity
eleven, functioned perfectly, and the
California team was unable to gain
with any degree of consistency.
Mike Symonds, playing left guard for
Stanford, was the outstanding star of
the day. He repeatedly broke through
the Bear line to drop the runner in his
tracks, rush passes, and hurry punts.
Hodge, right end, got the California
safety man on almost every punt, and
on one such play recovered a fumble
for a substantial gain.
Antonell, captain and left end, and
Bert Simmons, tackle, also played well.
In the back field Young and Josephs at
fullback and Wolf at half did good
work.
Stanford almost scored a touchdown
in the fourth quarter on a supposed
fumble. Cowan, having recovered the
ball on his 16-yard line, carried it
over the goal line after an 85-yard run.
The ball was called back, however,
â€¢when it was ruled that the whistle had
been blown before the fumble was re
covered.
Most of the play was between the
40-yard lines, although California
threatened seriously in the fourth
quarter, carrying the ball to the Stan
ford 15-yard line before the Card de
fense stiffened.

Oregon swimmers are being given life
saving work by the Red Cross corps.
