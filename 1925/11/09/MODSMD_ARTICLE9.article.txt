# BRILLIANT PASSES OF BRUINS DEFEAT BABE ELEVEN 14-0
## Hunt's Men Make More Yards But Fail to Gain at Critical Moments 
### 
After choosing to play a defensive
game for the first half, the California
Cubs opened up a brilliant passing attack
in the third quarter to score a 14 to 0
victory over the Stanford freshmen in
last Saturday's Little Big Game. The
Cardinals had things their own way dur
ing the first two periods, threatening the
California goal thrice when they marched
from deep in their own territory to the
Bears' 20-yard line. However, each time
the Bears strengthened to hold the Cards
for downs, and then kicked safely out
of danger.
Though the Cardinal yearlings chalked
up sixteen first downs to the Cubs' six,
they were not able to make their yards at
the critical moments. The Blue and Gold
team did not try offensive plays in the
first half, being content with kicking back
into the Stanford territory and letting
the Cards carry the ball, while they
waited for the breaks. No breaks came,
so in the middle of the third period the
Cubs opened with forward passes, and
finally Clymer threw a perfect 25-yard
pass to Killian, who sprinted 35 yards
down the sideline for the first touch
down. Clymer converted, making the
score 7 to 0 at the end of the quarter.
In the fourth period Stanford also
tried a passing offense, and after several
successful throws, Sims dropped back
to make a long pass, but was rushed by
Nuner, Cub left end, who hit the ball
into Killian's hands. Sims was immedi
ately blocked out by the Cubs and Killian
ran 48 yards for the final score. Clymer
again added the extra point to make the
score 14 to 0.
A feature of the game was the kicking
duel between Wilton, Card halfback, and
Barr, of the California team. The latter
made the most yards, though Wilton av-
I cragcd almost forty yards. One kick by
i Barr netted with its roll a total of sev
enty-five yards.
Wilton and Sims starred for the fresh
man backfield, while Cook, Vermilya, and
Harder took the honors on the line. Wil
ton displayed flashes of exceptional abil
ity, averaging four and a half yards in
fourteen runs. Sims carried the ball
more than any man on the squad, and
made good gains. Cook was at left
guard most of the game and opened up
holes for the backfield consistently. He
was through the line to smear the Cali
fornia plays more than once. He proved
to be a versatile player when he was
shifted to center near the close of the
game, working equally well in that posi
tion. Vermilya had a good man against
him in Briggs, the Cub center, but more
than held his own in playing a hard de
fensive game.
Cards Lack Experience
Lack of experience was shown clearly
by the Card freshmen. Coach Husky
Hunt has developed several promising
players; Smalling, who had never played
a game before this fall; Wilton, who was
too light to make a regular high school
team, and Sims, who made only the
lightweight team in Long Beach High.
The overwhelming number of experi
enced men on the California squad was
apparent when Coach Clint Evans began
to send in capable substitutes.
