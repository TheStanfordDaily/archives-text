# BRILLIANT PASSES OF BRUINS DEFEAT BABE ELEVEN 14-0
## Hunt's Men Make More Yards But Fail to Gain at Critical Moments 
### 
After choosing to play a defensive
game for the first half, the California
Cubs opened up a brilliant passing attack
in the third quarter to score a 14 to 0
victory over the Stanford freshmen in
last Saturday's Little Big Game. The
Cardinals had things their own way dur

California goal thrice when they marched
from deep in their own territory to the
Bears' 20-yard line. However, each time
the Bears strengthened to hold the Cards

so in the middle of the third period the
Cubs opened with forward passes, and
finally Clymer threw a perfect 25-yard
pass to Killian, who sprinted 35 yards
down the sideline for the first touch
down. Clymer converted, making the
score 7 to 0 at the end of the quarter.
In the fourth period Stanford also
tried a passing offense, and after several
successful throws, Sims dropped back
to make a long pass, but was rushed by
Nuner, Cub left end, who hit the ball
into Killian's hands. Sims was immedi
ately blocked out by the Cubs and Killian
ran 48 yards for the final score. Clymer
again added the extra point to make the
score 14 to 0.
A feature of the game was the kicking
duel between Wilton, Card halfback, and
Barr, of the California team. The latter
made the most yards, though Wilton av-
