# COSMOPOLITAN CLUB DISCUSSES FILIPINO FREEDOM FROM U. S.
## 
### 
Filipino Independence was the topic
of discussion at the regular meeting
of the Cosmopolitan Club held last
night in the Women's Clubhouse. Deo
gracias V. Villadolid, president of the
Filipino Club, was chairman of the
meeting.
The speaker of the evening was
Abdon Llorente, Filipino Commercial
Attache in San Francisco. In his argu
ment he brought out that the Philip
pine slands were ready for indepen
dence, maintaining that they are a
homogenious people with a feeling of
national consciousness. The popular
American belief that the islands would
become the prey of Japan was pro
nounced impossible, illustrating the
point with examples of the failure of
the Japanese to successfully occupy
tropical territory.
Llorente believes that the Philippine
Islands are being held by the United
States as a possible field to grow rub
ber, and thereby escape from the pres
ent British monopoly. The Philippine
Islands, he said, are as economically
self-sufficient as it is possible for any
nation to be.
