Large Crowd Expected
Attendance at the debate at Wheeler
hall in Berkeley tonight promises to
be the largest attending coast inter
collegiate forensics, according to word
received from Raymond G. Stanbury,
California debating manager. Special
trains will be run to Berkeley from
Valley points to facilitate attendance
at the debate. The mayor of Berkeley
will preside at the contest.
Weinberger, a senior at the Gold and
! Blue institution, is considered the fore
most debater at present attending
California. He was the winner of the
j U. C. Medal Debate at California last
year. Broughton, a member of the
! class of 1927, is making his first ap-
I pearanc.e on California varsity debate
teams, but has had considerable ex
perience at the Sacramento State Col
lege.
Weigel, Scott Experienced
Weigel, of Stanford, commenced his
; college debating career as a member
of the freshman squad in 1923, and in
1924 was on the varsity team debating
on criminal syndicalism. He partici
i pated with merit in the Joffre debate
iof that year, although his greatest
achievement was the winning of the
Pacific Coast extemporaneous speak
j ing championship. A finished delivery
I is an outstanding feature of Weigel's
I debating. He will open and close the
| contest for Stanford.
Scott, the second Card debater, was
' paired with Raymond Bruce last year
in the Stanford-Utah Aggie debate on
Japanese exclusion. He was a member
I of the freshman debating team in his
. first year.
Delmer Daves and Alfred E. Frazier
were selected as alternates for the two
debates tonight and Wednesday eve-
I ning.
No decision will be given at the
debate at Berkeley, although an audi
ence vote on the merits of the question
alone will be taken at Stanford to
; morrow evening. Constructive speech
; es of fifteen minutes each, with rebut
tals of seven and three minutes, have
been agreed to by the Stanford and
i California authorities.
