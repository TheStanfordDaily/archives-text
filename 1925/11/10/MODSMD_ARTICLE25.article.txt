# A 						Suggestion for Paddling
## 
### 
In today's Campus Opinion department, a freshman has declared that
paddling and tubbing as connected with the sophomore discipline of a past
decade be introduced again in an effort to train incoming students to
become real Stanford men, respectful of Cardinal traditions, and instilled
with the spirit of the old Stanford.
This suggestion is worthy of consideration. Before senior control took
effect, traditions were observed much more than they are now, under
classmen enjoyed to go through a class fight, special entertainment was
unnecessary as a magnet for drawing students to rallies, razors weren't
a daily necessity, and no one was afraid to say "hello."
The paddle is valuable in that it sets wayward freshmen on the right
track without loss of time or words. Senior Control with its lack of
physical coercion can never do that. Still, it is a mooted question whether
a strict freshman discipline would bring about the change which is sadly
needed.
Perhaps Stanford co-eds are becoming too much of an atraction for
young men who might make perfectly good roughs, or perhaps the auto
mobile is bringing the city too near. And so the Daily Palo Alto wants
to solve this problem:
What has become of the old spirit-loving, tradition-respecting Stanford
rough of five or ten years ago?
Communications regarding this matter are solicited and will be printed
in the Campus Opinion department, unsigned if desired.
