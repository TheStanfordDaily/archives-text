# Honor System Violations
## 
### 
The Men's Council was notified of two violations of the honor system
during midquarter examinations yesterday. It makes no difference whether
those guilty were new students or old students. The rules are clear, and a
violation of them is unexcusable. It is significant, however, that one
of the violators yesterday was a man and one a woman.

The honor system is an institution of several years' standing at Stanford.
It has been successful from the first, and has been violated only at rare
intervals. When a student breaks it he should be publicly branded as a
cheater of the worst type, because he is stealing from his fellow students,
with whom he has entered into an agreement not to resort to outside aid
while writing an examination paper.
The honor system is worth while. The Stanford label must mean
honest goods. Stanford men and women should be not only educated but
of unimpeachable integrity. Every Stanford student worthy of his Alma
Mater will accept squarely his own responsibility and exert his influence
toward making campus opinion so strong for honesty that infractions will
prove practically fatal to the student's career.
