# When Johnny Goes Marching Home

### 
About one out of every three students admitted to Stanford ever
achieves the goal of a degree, University records show. Lack of funds,
sickness, and other outside circumstances interfere in many cases, but
one-sixth of the casualties are simply a matter of Johnny's having flunked
out.
Mrs. C. A. Huston, secretary of the scholarship committee, says that
many students fail simply because they lack ability to make good scholastic
ally, and that it is a mistake for them ever to enter college. Others are per
fectly capable, but don't make the grade because they try to do too many
things at the same time. The man with ordinary intelligence and perserver
ance can engage in outside activities and maintain good scholarship, or work
his way through and keep up in his studies, but he must be extraordinarily
brilliant to earn his way, take part in outside activities, and study, all at
the same time, as some try to do.
Contrary to what some educators like to believe, mere participation in
activities seldom earns a flunk-out slip. Athletes, dramatists, actors, and
politicians who fall by the wayside usually are men who never learned to
study before coming to college, and who would have fallen even though
they had spent all their time on their books.
The flunkers to l>e blamed are those who have plenty of ability but
who think so little of the real purpose of college that they don't try to
studyâ€”men who come to the University to squander their parents' money,
take part in bull sessions, fall in love, and acquire a veneer of so-called
social polish. The University can easily get along without them.
