### Monroe Eaton 
FA BLE FOR COL-LEGES
AND CO-EDS
One up on a Time, there came He-len
Hot-sy to Stan-ford (some-how). She
was from Wick-ed Hol-ly-wood. She
was Beau-ti-ful, but Dumb.
She start-ed in to Get her a Man. So
she Picked Jim Bill Strong, the foot
ball Cap-tain. He was Big, and Hand
some, and he didn't like Wo-men (this
is a |Fa-ble); but she Went af-ter his
Hide, and Soon hung it on the Pence.
He fee-bly flopped a Few Times, but
it Did him No Good. She had him
Hog-tied.
Came a Day when his High School
Sweet-heart, An-nie O'-DOO-ley, ar-ri
ved at Stan-ford. She sur-veyed the
Ruins, and start-ed to Re-build.
With-in a Week, he Mar-ried He-len
Hot-sy.
MORAL: The Mo-vies are not Al
ways Right.

Ah, sure, Pat, an' ye look all torn up
fer fair!
Yis, Mike, I've been through a rivo
lution!
Wurra! an' is it in Mexico that it
was?
New! 'Twas in a butter machine!
* * *
They have rumbled and cavorted.
Yes, they shook the walls and snorted,
Then they clanked and boomed and
chattered to annoy yah.
Rumbles made the ceiling quiver,
And the people inside shiver.
They are terrors, those steam pipes
within Sequoia. —L. A. B.
* * *
Encina boarders suggest that most
of the $4200 breakage damage results
when the hashers become a little care
less and drop the food on the plates.

Dear Cabbages:
I heard one of the Stanford girls say
yesterday that it was too cold to wear
her balbriggan. What is a balbriggan?
—Freshman.
Dear Freshman:
Balbriggans are mistakes that clothe
the ferminine form. —Cabbages.
Dear Cabbages:
How do you wear a mistake, and
does the climate have anything to do
with it? —Freshman. I

FA BLE FOR COL-LEGES
AND CO-EDS
One up on a Time, there came He-len
Hot-sy to Stan-ford (some-how). She
was from Wick-ed Hol-ly-wood. She
was Beau-ti-ful, but Dumb.
She start-ed in to Get her a Man. So
she Picked Jim Bill Strong, the foot
ball Cap-tain. He was Big, and Hand
some, and he didn't like Wo-men (this
is a |Fa-ble); but she Went af-ter his
Hide, and Soon hung it on the Pence.
He fee-bly flopped a Few Times, but
it Did him No Good. She had him
Hog-tied.
Came a Day when his High School
Sweet-heart, An-nie O'-DOO-ley, ar-ri
ved at Stan-ford. She sur-veyed the
Ruins, and start-ed to Re-build.
With-in a Week, he Mar-ried He-len
Hot-sy.
MORAL: The Mo-vies are not Al
ways Right.

They have rumbled and cavorted.
Yes, they shook the walls and snorted,
Then they clanked and boomed and
chattered to annoy yah.
Rumbles made the ceiling quiver,
And the people inside shiver.
They are terrors, those steam pipes
within Sequoia. —L. A. B.
