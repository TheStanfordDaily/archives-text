# CAP AND GOWN HOLDS DATE SALE TOMORROW
## 
### 
Cap and Gown is holding a sale of
stuffed dates tomorrow from 9 to 12
o'clock in front of the Women's Club
house. The proceeds are to go to the
Cap and Gown scholarship which is
given annually to some worthy Stan
ford woman selected by the scholar
ship committee.
Bags of dates are being sold for ten
and twenty-five cents. Helen Lewis,
the secretary of Cap and Gown, is in
charge of the sale. This is the first
date sale held by Cap and Gown this
quarter, though the society has held
many such sales in the past.
