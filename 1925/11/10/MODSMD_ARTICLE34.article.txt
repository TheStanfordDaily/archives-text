Marion Harris, "distinctive songs,"
will feature the special 36th anniver
sary bill at the Orpheum in San Fran
cisco this week.
Ben Bard of musical comedy fame
will act as master of ceremonies, in
troduce the various acts, and amuse
the audience with his own talent.
Among other skits will be a Chinese
jazz band, and a Chinese chorus.
Advance notices promise an unusual
bill, with every act a headliner. At
least the theatregoer may be assured
of one delightful half-hour with Marion
Harris who never fails to get a big
cheer from any audience.
