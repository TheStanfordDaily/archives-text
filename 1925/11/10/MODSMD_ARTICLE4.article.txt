## 
### 
Snakes, according to Gregory M.
Kranzthor of Sequoia, make better
pets than enemies, and he proves
this by keeping three in his room.
A flat-nose, a gopher, and a king
snake comprise his menagerie. The
first two were imported from Texas
and do not seem to be thriving in
this climate as neither has touched
food for two and a half months.
The king snake was caught at
Lagunita and his appetite has not
been materially affected by his cap
tivity, since seven lizards or a good
sized snake a day satisfies him.
The snakes, it is said, do not
bother either Kranzthor or his two
roommates. In fact, they show pre
ference for their own company and
seek out the dark corners of the
room.
