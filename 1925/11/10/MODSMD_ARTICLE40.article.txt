Analysis of Stanford's victory in
P. A. A. swimming championships for
the year shows that nine out of the
twelve events were taken by Cardinal
swimmers. Practically all of Stanford's
61 points were made by six swimmers
who placed consistently in all the four
meets.
The first contest was held at Encina
pool last spring and was won by Stan
ford 14 to the Olympic Club's 4. Early
this quarter the clubmen jumped into
a 22-21 lead at the Elks Club meet.
On October 31 Ernst Brandsten
staged the third contest in which Stan
ford forged ahead 35 to 26. The final
meet last Friday night was Stanford's
affair all the way through and the
Olympic Club weut down by the 61-49
score.
Arden Allen proved his versatility
and all-around ability in the water by
accumulating the largest individual
score. His eighteen points were earned
by victories in backstroke and free
style and in all distances from 50 to
500 yards. He won the medley, tied
for first in the 220 breast-stroke and
150-yard back-stroke, took third in the
500 free-style, and was a member of
the 200- and 400t-yard relay teams.
Dave Fall stands second with ten
points earned by victories in both the
high- and low-board diving. Carl
Stevenson, varsity distance man, fol
lows closely with nine and one-half
digits. He won the 500 free-style, took
thirds in the 220 free-style and 150
back-stroke, and swam a lap on the
winnihg 400-yard relay team.
' Although Wally O'Connor partici
pated only in the last meet he piled up
seven and one-half points by winning
the 100-yard free-style and doing a
fast lap in the 400-yard relay. Bob
Williams with seven and Ted Smith
with six counts are sixth and seventh
in the rating.
