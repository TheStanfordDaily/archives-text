# Washington, California Tied for First Place in Pacific Coast Standing
## 
### 
Washington's 13-0 victory over Stan
ford last Saturday leaves two teams
undefeated in the 1925 race for the
Pacific Coast Conference title, as Cali
fornia crushed the Washington State
eleven 35 to 0 in her conference game.
Montana surprised critics hy whipping
the Idaho Vandals, who have always
been among the stronger conference
elevens, by a score of 20 to 14. No
other conference games were played,
although U. S. C. defeated Santa Clara
28 to 9, and the Oregon Aggies over
whelmed Pacific 56 to 0.
A defeat of Washington at the hands
of the Golden Bear next Friday would
place California at the head of the
conference standing with three
straight victories. Washington would
be second with three wins and one
defeat, while Stanford, who plays the
Southern Branch, a non-conference
team, would remain in third place. A
win by Washington, on the other hand,
would virtually clinch the titles for
the Huskies, who would then have but
one conference game left, and that
with Oregon, a comparatively weak
team.
Granting that the Bears defeat
Washington, a victory of the Cards in
the Big Game would give Stanford a
percentage of 800, California 750, and
Washington 750, while wins by U. S. C.
in its remaining conference games
would net the Los Angeles insitutiou
a percentage of 750. A victory of Wash
ington November 26 would leave Stan
ford and Washington tied for first
place in the conference race with per
centages of SOO each. The barely pos
sible defeat of Washington at the
hands of Oregon would eliminate the
Huskies for the title rating. Although
an Oregon victory is highly improb
able, still such was the case last year
when the Huskies were eliminated
from the conference race.
The result of the above calculations
indicates that Stanford at least has a
mathematical chance for Pacific Coast
honors.
