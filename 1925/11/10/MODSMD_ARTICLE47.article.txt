# SPORTS OF 1925
## A 						Pair of Jacks 
### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
This is supposed to be a study in contrasts. The Jack Dempsey of old who
slashed and tore and hammered Jess Willard and Luis Firpo to the canvas
over a dozen times in less than three rounds, and the Jack Dempsey of today,
movie actor, realtor, and vaudevillain.
The fightin' fool at the upper right lived down a much-criticized war record
to ride the crest of the wave of popularity. The posing sleek-looking sheik in
the lower left is at present one of the most unpopular of all heavyweight
champions because he has not touched a glove in defense of his title in more
than two years.
Which Jack do you prefer? Well, naturally, so do I. The old nose was
easier to draw, for one reason. And even though it only took a chance on
getting dented six times in six years, it behaved somewhat like the nose of a
champion.
But this new proboscis, remodeled for the screen or to suit the taste of its
wearer's new wife —will it ever grace the canvas-covered ring? I doubt it.
In less than two hours Jack Dempsey won nearly one million, two hundred
thousand dollars at his chosen profession. Yet, since September 1923 he has
refused to earn a million more. There's something fishy somewhere. A colored
gentleman in the woodpile, no doubt.
