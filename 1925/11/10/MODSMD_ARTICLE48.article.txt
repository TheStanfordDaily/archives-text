# CAMPUS OPINION
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Last Thursday the Daily Palo Alto
quite frankly made the statement that
the Old Stanford Spirit was gone. No
one would like to know better than
we frosh why this spirit no longer
exists. Is it our fault that we have
not acquired this spirit? At each as
sembly we hear the same type of
speech. First, a general slam at us for
the introduction, then a good bawling
out for the body of the speech, and
for the conclusion there is an apology
for having had to give this bawling
out. During the assemblies, rallies, and
games, incriminating cords may be
seen all over the campus. Shall we
follow suit?
Scarcely three years ago the senior
class saw fit to substitute its control
for that of the sophomore. Formerly it
was the sophomore who instilled the
Old Stanford Spirit in the freshman.
And the duty is now upon the shoul
ders of the senior. Surely there has
been ample time to test the success
of the senior system.
From all parts of the West, while
still high school students, we heard of
this Old Stanford Spirit. It is truly a
tradition of the West. Simultaneously
we heard tales of the paddle, the tub,
and the early morning runs to Mayfield
in one's pajamas in time to catcii the
train back to Palo Alto. The days when
all frosh wore dinks, when all went to
games, and when queening was a grave
offense. And now what have we? After
noons are spent in playing cards, or
perhaps a game of pool will amuse us.
Dinks! What are they? O! yes; they
are those little gray caps some frosh
wear when it does not materially re
duce their per cent of efficiency of
queening on the Quad. We used to
stay at the hall nights, but since the
unfortunate recipient of several bags
of water put a stop to our favorite
amusement, we now go to the show
every night. This student body sup
ports two moving picture houses in
Palo Alto at the expense' of our Stan
ford spirit.
Sometimes I long for the old sopho
more regime. The days when frosh
were frosh and sophs were sophs. The
day 8 when they had no date bureau
with Roble. I want to be part of that
Old Stanford Spirit. Can not the sopho
mores be trusted not to do serious
injury or destruction? Why not move
the sponsor system to Sequoia? I do
not wish to bring the curse of the
paddle upon the class; nor do I cherish
it for myself (being only a hundred
pounds in my best suit). But one of
the cardinal reasons why I came to
Stanford was to get this Spirit. And
I'm willing to take my share of the
paddle (if necessary) to get it. It is
up to you, Mr. Senior! Either build up
a new and better spirit or give back
the paddle to the sophomore. We're
game! —A Disillusioned Frosh.
The Editor, Sir:
I have wondered before and after I
entered Stanford what was done with
all the money that was taken in from
the numerous fees. The information
that is available is decidedly indefinite.
I suppose that tuition fees are for the
purpose, partly, of helping to maintain
adequate salaries for the teaching
staff.
When I inquired about what I was

to get for the incidental fees certain
clerks in the Registrar's office looked
at me askance and gave indefinite an
swers to my questions. I cannot dis
cover that more than half of the inci
dental charge pays for anything I get
in return. I feel that what I have
learned concerning the benefits 1 am
supposed to receive by paying this fee
is extremely sketchy while the infor
mat ion I have gleaned about the things
that were not mentioned has been
vague indeed. Incidentally, I might add
that "incidentals" is a very ill-chosen
word when used in reference to public
expenditures. I don't have more money
than I need and I should like to know
exactly what my money is being s;pent
for.
Another thing want straightened
out is the syllabus fee question. How
Is it that after paying my $97 I am
sent an exorbitant bill for syllabus
fees which I thought were included in
the initial payments? Why am I ex
pected to pay for a syllabus in a sub
ject in which I never had any that I
know of?
It is useless to object or refuse to
pay these charges under the circum
stances, but the least I may expect is
a definite statement of the items for
which my money is spent.
—Incidentally, '29.
The Editor, Sir:
Allow me to extend Bob Sears, who
is groaning under the misapprehen
sion that the Stanford Literary Maga
zine is a closed corporation, because
he can't get a subscription, a word to
clear up bis doubts on the "consarned
thing." The'staff is trying to comb the
entire campus for subscriptions, and
when the job is finished, if any have
been left out, will they drop a note to
Box 2, Campus, and at least six strong
men will break all records to reach
tliem. May there be thousands of such
viewpoints like the one Bob Sears
wrote. A tryoutee reached Sears thirty
seconds after the Daily came off the
P r ess. —Arthur Duncombe.
Far be it from the thoughts of a
loyal daughter of the Stanford Red to
whine over the downfall of the Red
shirts. No alibis are forthcoming—yea,
verily, we shall not even mention the
slogan of past years: "moral victory."
BUT —is football to be relegated to
the prize-flglit class as a sport, or is it
to remain a game to be played by
collegians in the presence of the more
or less gentler sex? Is it to be a con
test of brute strength—see who can
knock out the most men and then mop
up the field with a little straight foot
ball, just to preserve the fiction that
it IS a game?
In the old days of American football,
when the H.D.'s chorus was
"The breaking heads and bones are
going crunch, crunch, crunch,
"We're sure to have the price to buy
our lunch, lunch, lunch,"
football gate receipts were figured in
peanut-stand style. We may bf» wrong,
but it has seemed to some of us thai
the open passing game, the new clever
shifts, etc.. had something to do with
the present enormous popularity of
football.
Are we right, or will the crowds go
to see 'em smear the field with gore?
If so, let's make it a real profes
sional game and pay the poor gladi
ators to take their punishment.

whine over the downfall of the Red
shirts. No alibis are forthcoming—yea,
verily, we shall not even mention the
slogan of past years: "moral victory."
BUT —is football to be relegated to
the prize-flglit class as a sport, or is it
to remain a game to be played by
collegians in the presence of the more
or less gentler sex? Is it to be a con
test of brute strength—see who can
knock out the most men and then mop
up the field with a little straight foot
ball, just to preserve the fiction that
it IS a game?
In the old days of American football,
when the H.D.'s chorus was
"The breaking heads and bones are
going crunch, crunch, crunch,
"We're sure to have the price to buy
our lunch, lunch, lunch,"
football gate receipts were figured in
peanut-stand style. We may bf» wrong,

the open passing game, the new clever

the present enormous popularity of
football.
Are we right, or will the crowds go

If so, let's make it a real profes

The Editor, Sir:
Last Thursday the Daily Palo Alto
quite frankly made the statement that
the Old Stanford Spirit was gone. No
one would like to know better than
we frosh why this spirit no longer
exists. Is it our fault that we have
not acquired this spirit? At each as
sembly we hear the same type of
speech. First, a general slam at us for
the introduction, then a good bawling
out for the body of the speech, and
for the conclusion there is an apology
for having had to give this bawling
out. During the assemblies, rallies, and
games, incriminating cords may be
seen all over the campus. Shall we
follow suit?
Scarcely three years ago the senior
class saw fit to substitute its control
for that of the sophomore. Formerly it
was the sophomore who instilled the
Old Stanford Spirit in the freshman.
And the duty is now upon the shoul
ders of the senior. Surely there has
been ample time to test the success
of the senior system.
From all parts of the West, while
still high school students, we heard of
this Old Stanford Spirit. It is truly a
tradition of the West. Simultaneously
we heard tales of the paddle, the tub,
and the early morning runs to Mayfield
in one's pajamas in time to catcii the
train back to Palo Alto. The days when
all frosh wore dinks, when all went to
games, and when queening was a grave
offense. And now what have we? After
noons are spent in playing cards, or
perhaps a game of pool will amuse us.
Dinks! What are they? O! yes; they
are those little gray caps some frosh
wear when it does not materially re
duce their per cent of efficiency of
queening on the Quad. We used to
stay at the hall nights, but since the
unfortunate recipient of several bags
of water put a stop to our favorite
amusement, we now go to the show
every night. This student body sup
ports two moving picture houses in
Palo Alto at the expense' of our Stan
ford spirit.
Sometimes I long for the old sopho
more regime. The days when frosh
were frosh and sophs were sophs. The
day 8 when they had no date bureau
with Roble. I want to be part of that
Old Stanford Spirit. Can not the sopho
mores be trusted not to do serious
injury or destruction? Why not move
the sponsor system to Sequoia? I do
not wish to bring the curse of the
paddle upon the class; nor do I cherish
it for myself (being only a hundred
pounds in my best suit). But one of
the cardinal reasons why I came to
Stanford was to get this Spirit. And
I'm willing to take my share of the
paddle (if necessary) to get it. It is
up to you, Mr. Senior! Either build up
a new and better spirit or give back
the paddle to the sophomore. We're
game! —A Disillusioned Frosh.
The Editor, Sir:
I have wondered before and after I
entered Stanford what was done with
all the money that was taken in from
the numerous fees. The information
that is available is decidedly indefinite.
I suppose that tuition fees are for the
purpose, partly, of helping to maintain
adequate salaries for the teaching
staff.
When I inquired about what I was

to get for the incidental fees certain
clerks in the Registrar's office looked
at me askance and gave indefinite an
swers to my questions. I cannot dis
cover that more than half of the inci
dental charge pays for anything I get
in return. I feel that what I have
learned concerning the benefits 1 am
supposed to receive by paying this fee
is extremely sketchy while the infor
mat ion I have gleaned about the things
that were not mentioned has been
vague indeed. Incidentally, I might add
that "incidentals" is a very ill-chosen
word when used in reference to public
expenditures. I don't have more money
than I need and I should like to know
exactly what my money is being s;pent
for.
Another thing want straightened
out is the syllabus fee question. How
Is it that after paying my $97 I am
sent an exorbitant bill for syllabus
fees which I thought were included in
the initial payments? Why am I ex
pected to pay for a syllabus in a sub
ject in which I never had any that I
know of?
It is useless to object or refuse to
pay these charges under the circum
stances, but the least I may expect is
a definite statement of the items for
which my money is spent.
—Incidentally, '29.
The Editor, Sir:
Allow me to extend Bob Sears, who
is groaning under the misapprehen
sion that the Stanford Literary Maga
zine is a closed corporation, because
he can't get a subscription, a word to
clear up bis doubts on the "consarned
thing." The'staff is trying to comb the
entire campus for subscriptions, and
when the job is finished, if any have
been left out, will they drop a note to
Box 2, Campus, and at least six strong
men will break all records to reach
tliem. May there be thousands of such
viewpoints like the one Bob Sears
wrote. A tryoutee reached Sears thirty
seconds after the Daily came off the
P r ess. —Arthur Duncombe.

out is the syllabus fee question. How
Is it that after paying my $97 I am

Allow me to extend Bob Sears, who
is groaning under the misapprehen
sion that the Stanford Literary Maga
zine is a closed corporation, because
he can't get a subscription, a word to
clear up bis doubts on the "consarned
thing." The'staff is trying to comb the
entire campus for subscriptions, and
when the job is finished, if any have
been left out, will they drop a note to
Box 2, Campus, and at least six strong
men will break all records to reach
tliem. May there be thousands of such
viewpoints like the one Bob Sears
wrote. A tryoutee reached Sears thirty
seconds after the Daily came off the

Far be it from the thoughts of a
loyal daughter of the Stanford Red to
whine over the downfall of the Red
shirts. No alibis are forthcoming—yea,
verily, we shall not even mention the
slogan of past years: "moral victory."
BUT —is football to be relegated to
the prize-flglit class as a sport, or is it
to remain a game to be played by
collegians in the presence of the more
or less gentler sex? Is it to be a con
test of brute strength—see who can
knock out the most men and then mop
up the field with a little straight foot
ball, just to preserve the fiction that
it IS a game?
In the old days of American football,
when the H.D.'s chorus was
"The breaking heads and bones are
going crunch, crunch, crunch,
"We're sure to have the price to buy
our lunch, lunch, lunch,"
football gate receipts were figured in
peanut-stand style. We may bf» wrong,
but it has seemed to some of us thai
the open passing game, the new clever
shifts, etc.. had something to do with
the present enormous popularity of
football.
Are we right, or will the crowds go
to see 'em smear the field with gore?
If so, let's make it a real profes

The Editor, Sir:
Last Thursday the Daily Palo Alto
quite frankly made the statement that
the Old Stanford Spirit was gone. No
one would like to know better than
we frosh why this spirit no longer
exists. Is it our fault that we have
not acquired this spirit? At each as
sembly we hear the same type of
speech. First, a general slam at us for
the introduction, then a good bawling
out for the body of the speech, and
for the conclusion there is an apology
for having had to give this bawling
out. During the assemblies, rallies, and
games, incriminating cords may be
seen all over the campus. Shall we
follow suit?
Scarcely three years ago the senior
class saw fit to substitute its control
for that of the sophomore. Formerly it
was the sophomore who instilled the
Old Stanford Spirit in the freshman.
And the duty is now upon the shoul
ders of the senior. Surely there has
been ample time to test the success
of the senior system.
From all parts of the West, while
still high school students, we heard of
this Old Stanford Spirit. It is truly a
tradition of the West. Simultaneously
we heard tales of the paddle, the tub,
and the early morning runs to Mayfield
in one's pajamas in time to catcii the
train back to Palo Alto. The days when
all frosh wore dinks, when all went to
games, and when queening was a grave
offense. And now what have we? After
noons are spent in playing cards, or
perhaps a game of pool will amuse us.
Dinks! What are they? O! yes; they
are those little gray caps some frosh
wear when it does not materially re
duce their per cent of efficiency of
queening on the Quad. We used to
stay at the hall nights, but since the
unfortunate recipient of several bags
of water put a stop to our favorite
amusement, we now go to the show
every night. This student body sup
ports two moving picture houses in
Palo Alto at the expense' of our Stan
ford spirit.
Sometimes I long for the old sopho
more regime. The days when frosh
were frosh and sophs were sophs. The
day 8 when they had no date bureau
with Roble. I want to be part of that
Old Stanford Spirit. Can not the sopho
mores be trusted not to do serious
injury or destruction? Why not move
the sponsor system to Sequoia? I do
not wish to bring the curse of the
paddle upon the class; nor do I cherish
it for myself (being only a hundred
pounds in my best suit). But one of
the cardinal reasons why I came to
Stanford was to get this Spirit. And
I'm willing to take my share of the
paddle (if necessary) to get it. It is
up to you, Mr. Senior! Either build up
a new and better spirit or give back
the paddle to the sophomore. We're
game! —A Disillusioned Frosh.
The Editor, Sir:
I have wondered before and after I
entered Stanford what was done with
all the money that was taken in from
the numerous fees. The information
that is available is decidedly indefinite.
I suppose that tuition fees are for the
purpose, partly, of helping to maintain
adequate salaries for the teaching
staff.
When I inquired about what I was

to get for the incidental fees certain
clerks in the Registrar's office looked
at me askance and gave indefinite an
swers to my questions. I cannot dis
cover that more than half of the inci
dental charge pays for anything I get
in return. I feel that what I have
learned concerning the benefits 1 am
supposed to receive by paying this fee
is extremely sketchy while the infor
mat ion I have gleaned about the things
that were not mentioned has been
vague indeed. Incidentally, I might add
that "incidentals" is a very ill-chosen
word when used in reference to public
expenditures. I don't have more money
than I need and I should like to know
exactly what my money is being s;pent
for.

up to you, Mr. Senior! Either build up
a new and better spirit or give back
the paddle to the sophomore. We're
game! —A Disillusioned Frosh.
The Editor, Sir:
I have wondered before and after I
entered Stanford what was done with
all the money that was taken in from
the numerous fees. The information
that is available is decidedly indefinite.
I suppose that tuition fees are for the
purpose, partly, of helping to maintain
adequate salaries for the teaching
staff.
When I inquired about what I was

to get for the incidental fees certain
clerks in the Registrar's office looked
at me askance and gave indefinite an
swers to my questions. I cannot dis
cover that more than half of the inci
dental charge pays for anything I get
in return. I feel that what I have
learned concerning the benefits 1 am
supposed to receive by paying this fee
is extremely sketchy while the infor
mat ion I have gleaned about the things
that were not mentioned has been
vague indeed. Incidentally, I might add
that "incidentals" is a very ill-chosen
word when used in reference to public
expenditures. I don't have more money
than I need and I should like to know
exactly what my money is being s;pent
for.
Another thing want straightened
out is the syllabus fee question. How
Is it that after paying my $97 I am
sent an exorbitant bill for syllabus
fees which I thought were included in
the initial payments? Why am I ex
pected to pay for a syllabus in a sub
ject in which I never had any that I
know of?
It is useless to object or refuse to
pay these charges under the circum
stances, but the least I may expect is
a definite statement of the items for
which my money is spent.

The Editor, Sir:
Allow me to extend Bob Sears, who
is groaning under the misapprehen
sion that the Stanford Literary Maga
zine is a closed corporation, because
he can't get a subscription, a word to
clear up bis doubts on the "consarned
thing." The'staff is trying to comb the
entire campus for subscriptions, and
when the job is finished, if any have
been left out, will they drop a note to
Box 2, Campus, and at least six strong
men will break all records to reach
tliem. May there be thousands of such
viewpoints like the one Bob Sears
wrote. A tryoutee reached Sears thirty
seconds after the Daily came off the
P r ess. —Arthur Duncombe.
Far be it from the thoughts of a
loyal daughter of the Stanford Red to
whine over the downfall of the Red
shirts. No alibis are forthcoming—yea,
verily, we shall not even mention the
slogan of past years: "moral victory."
BUT —is football to be relegated to
the prize-flglit class as a sport, or is it
to remain a game to be played by
collegians in the presence of the more
or less gentler sex? Is it to be a con
test of brute strength—see who can
knock out the most men and then mop
up the field with a little straight foot
ball, just to preserve the fiction that
it IS a game?
In the old days of American football,
when the H.D.'s chorus was
"The breaking heads and bones are
going crunch, crunch, crunch,
"We're sure to have the price to buy
our lunch, lunch, lunch,"
football gate receipts were figured in
peanut-stand style. We may bf» wrong,
but it has seemed to some of us thai
the open passing game, the new clever
shifts, etc.. had something to do with
the present enormous popularity of
football.
Are we right, or will the crowds go
to see 'em smear the field with gore?
If so, let's make it a real profes
sional game and pay the poor gladi
ators to take their punishment.
