constitution of the association provides

sion of the plans and problems of the
association is held. Helen Erskine will

will present reports.
The main topic to be discussed this
year is the Fiesta Lagunita, which
will be given in the spring quarter.

outline plans that have been made so

| original, but may be based on classical
j or historical incident.
All Stanford women are members of
jW. A. A. The stated purpose of the
1 organization is to include all women
| in athletics, rather than permit a few
Ito monopolize the campus sports.

closed meeting at 7 o'clock. Only board
I members will be present.
