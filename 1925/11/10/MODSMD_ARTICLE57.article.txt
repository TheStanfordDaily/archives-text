# BOLSHEVIK REGIME CLASSED AS WORLD PROBLEM BY DEVINE
## Americans Declared to Lack Interest in Existing World Affairs 
### Anne Waldron 
"We are living in a time of revolution,
and we must be acquainted with the
revolutionary methods of our day to he
good world citizens," said Edward T.
Devine, in an interview granted this
morning. "In speaking of Lenin, Mus
solini, and Gandhi as three modern
revolutionists, I am not interested in the
biographies of the men but am using
them as a means to acquaint the Ameri
can public with the modern forms of
revolution.
Revolution Destructive
"Lenin represents the Bolshevik
revolution in Russia, which was sweep
ing and thorough going. It wiped out
the existing political, economic, and
social structure. It hit at the existing
forms of religion, included art and lit
erature, and sought to destroy the fam
ily as a social unit. The revolution in
Russia was politically successful be
cause it was directed for the benefit of
the peasants and gave them the control
of the land, taking it out of the hands of
the aristocrats who had held its for gen
erations. Russian peasants do not op
pose the modern soviet government
because they fear another form of gov
ernment will tear away their newly
obtained privileges and send them back
to semi-serfdom. Lenin and the Rus
sian revolutionists based their revolu
tion primarily on violence.
Mussolini Favored.
"The Mussolini government is more
generally favored, but it is equally a
revolution. Mussolini is an absolute
dictator and does not depend on popu
lar support for his power. He supports
the dominence of the middle class and
stands for extreme conservatism in eco
nomic and political measures. Musso
lini also depends upon violence for his
power, but he has not been as thor
ough going in wiping out the estab
lished structure of Italy as has Lenin
in Russia.
"Gandhi represents the new type of
revolution—passive resistance. The
present revolution in India is the first
attempt of any magnitude to wipe out
the western dominance in the Orient.
The leaders of this movement seek to
establish the old eastern art and phil
osophy instead of the modern mechani
cal western civilization. Gandhi be
lieves in a practical demonstration of
the doctrines contained in Christianity
to break the British rule."
U.S. Unthreatened
The United States is at present the
only great nation in the world which
is not threatened by any sort of revo
lution. Devine therefore believes that
it is the duty of Americans to become
world citizens and to learn how they
can best re-establish the threatened so
cial and economic structure of the
other nations. He does not necessarily
advocate entrance into the League of
Nations or World Court, but a general
knowledge among the people of Amer
ica on world problems.

Revolution Destructive
"Lenin represents the Bolshevik
revolution in Russia, which was sweep
ing and thorough going. It wiped out
the existing political, economic, and
social structure. It hit at the existing
forms of religion, included art and lit
erature, and sought to destroy the fam
ily as a social unit. The revolution in
Russia was politically successful be
cause it was directed for the benefit of
the peasants and gave them the control
of the land, taking it out of the hands of
the aristocrats who had held its for gen
erations. Russian peasants do not op
pose the modern soviet government
because they fear another form of gov
ernment will tear away their newly
obtained privileges and send them back
to semi-serfdom. Lenin and the Rus
sian revolutionists based their revolu
tion primarily on violence.
Mussolini Favored.
"The Mussolini government is more
generally favored, but it is equally a
revolution. Mussolini is an absolute
dictator and does not depend on popu
lar support for his power. He supports
the dominence of the middle class and
stands for extreme conservatism in eco
nomic and political measures. Musso
lini also depends upon violence for his
power, but he has not been as thor
ough going in wiping out the estab
lished structure of Italy as has Lenin
in Russia.
"Gandhi represents the new type of
revolution—passive resistance. The
present revolution in India is the first
attempt of any magnitude to wipe out
the western dominance in the Orient.
The leaders of this movement seek to
establish the old eastern art and phil
osophy instead of the modern mechani
cal western civilization. Gandhi be
lieves in a practical demonstration of
the doctrines contained in Christianity
to break the British rule."
U.S. Unthreatened
The United States is at present the
only great nation in the world which
is not threatened by any sort of revo
lution. Devine therefore believes that
it is the duty of Americans to become
world citizens and to learn how they
can best re-establish the threatened so
cial and economic structure of the
other nations. He does not necessarily
advocate entrance into the League of
Nations or World Court, but a general
knowledge among the people of Amer
ica on world problems.
"We are living in a time of revolution,
and we must be acquainted with the
revolutionary methods of our day to he
good world citizens," said Edward T.
Devine, in an interview granted this
morning. "In speaking of Lenin, Mus
