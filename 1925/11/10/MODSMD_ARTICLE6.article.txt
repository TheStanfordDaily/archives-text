# CESAR FRANCK ON ORGAN PROGRAM FOR THURSDAY RECITAL
## 
### 
Two organ composers are represent
jed on the program to be given by
| Warren D. Allen in the Memorial
Church Thursday afternoon at 4:15

| o'clock.
Bach's Chorale-Prelude, "We All Be
j lieve in One God," will open the pro
i gram. The monumental genius of Bach
| is nowhere better displayed than in
! his Chorale Preludes which are varia
! tions on the old hymns of the Lutheran
! Church. The last twenty-seven years
of his life he was director of music in
i the St. Thomas Church in Leipsic.
"Pastorale in E" by Cesar Franck
! will be played second. Franck was the
j true founder of the French school of
I instrumental music. His style of com
j position is based upon the polyphonic
| forms of Bach but is filled with mystic
! poetry and beauty.
Following this will be heard the
j "Meditation" from Massenet's "Thais."
I Massenet was one of the most prolific
j French opera composers of recent
times.
"Heroic Piece" and "Hymnus" are
both by Rossetter G. Cole, a contem
porary American composer now living
in Chicago. "Heroic Piece" is one of
j the boldest and most striking works of
I Cole.
