The question of naming the new foot
ball field comes before the students at
the Football Rally tomorrow night. The
Executive Committee-has no power to
decide the question but it recommended
that the grounds be named Stanford
Field and thought it wise to express its
opinion before the final decision.

Friday evening, November 17, Roble
Club will give its annual reception to
the faculty in the Women's dormitory.
During the evening W. B. Yeat's Irish
play, "Land of Heart's Desire," will be
presented.

All University publications will issue
special football numbers on the day of
the Big Game with California. The an
nual football issue of Chaparral will lie
placed on sale Friday morning. The
number will have twenty-six pages, twice
the usual size. This month's edition of
the Sequoia will also be a special foot
ball number and will be larger than usual.
The Daily Palo Alto will not issue its
regular Friday evening paper but a spe
cial edition of sixteen pages on Satur
day morning. The edition will be on sale
on all trains leaving San Francisco and
San Jose Saturday.

President Wheeler, at the request of
the student and faculty, has dismissed all
Saturday classes at the University of
California to enable students to reach
Palo Alto in time for the game.

D. P. A. Editorial â€”The squable over
who shall be head linesman for the Big
Game on Saturday lias brought forth an
argument against having graduates of
either university officiate at intercollegiate
contests. Last year a graduate of the
University of California officiated as
head linesman and the understanding
was that Stanford should have her repre
sentative in that capacity this year. Man
ager Barrett's stand that a Stanford man
be the official should be the stand of the
entire Stanford student body.
* * *
The California team will not use the
new training house under the west end
of the bleachers at the game Saturday,
because the rival coaches might be heard
through the partitions.
