# CARD SOCCER SQUAD STRENGTHENED FOR CALIFORNIA SERIES
## 
### 
Entering the last week of training
before the opening of the series with
California, the varsity soccer team
seems stronger than at any time this :
year.
Since Dave Clark, who has been out
all season with injuries, has returned !
to his regular position at fullback, the â– 
defense is strengthened. Holmes, who ,
was replaced by Clark, will be shifted ;
to left halfback in place of Cannon.

The forward wall, although small, is
fast, and Miron and Sclioen on the
wings are valuable as cogs in the at
tack.

California, on a basis of comparative
scores, ranks above the Cards, but the
Stanford men expect to upset the dope
and win. If Stanford wins but one
game of the series, this victory, with
those gained in the past two years,
will give the Reds the California-Stan
ford soccer cup.
