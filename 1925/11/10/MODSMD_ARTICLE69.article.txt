# Sophomores Hurl Eggs at Medical School Freshmen
## 
### 
Fifty-six freshmen of the College of
Physicians and Surgeons located at
San Francisco were the targets of eggs,
tomatoes, and other missiles thrown by
the sophomores at a recent initiation of
the freshmen.
No hint of forthcoming events was
given the freshmen as they arrived at
class one by one. Captured by the
sophomores, they were tied to posts at
the State Armory building nearby,
painted, bombarded by obnoxious mis
siles, and finally plastered with flypaper.
Several hours later the hapless victims
were rescued by members of the faculty.
