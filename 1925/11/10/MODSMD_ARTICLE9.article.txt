# PLANE TO SHOWER MINIATURE PIGSKINS OVER THE CAMPUS
## Footballs Will Conceal Free Tickets to Dance After Big Game Gaieties 
### 
Fifty free tickets to the Football
dance following the Gaieties show will
be dropped from a specially chartered
airplane which will fly over the campus
tomorrow shortly after twelve o'clock.

The plane, which was chartered from
the Varney Airport at San Mateo, will
soar above the campus at exactly 12:02
o'clock, flying over Encina above the
walk leading to the Art Gallery. The
plane will turn slowly southeast, head
ing for the postoffice and row. From
the postoffice the aviator will return
to Encina, circling over Toyon and
Branner. He will repeat the trip three
times.
Over one hundred miniature foot
balls will be dropped from the plane
during its campus journeys. Tickets
to the football show dance, which will
be held in the pavilion following the
performance, will be found inside fifty
of the artificial pigskins.
This novel method of distributing
complimentary dance tickets as well
as arousing interest in the football
show itself, to be the evening prior to
the Big Game, has never been here
tofore used at Stanford.
