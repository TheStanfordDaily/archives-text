from the Snow Caps to the Valley
Fill up with General Gasoline in the valley—here's
get-away and power for you. Drive up into the moun
tains —the air is getting keener and keener —there are
spots of snow here and there —but your motor keeps
up its steady hum. There is no falter —no hesitation
in your car's performance.
Up past the snowline —it's good and cold here. Stop
for lunch at the Inn. Warm yourself in front of a gen
erous log fire. Then come out and start on your way.
One touch of the starter and your motor is off again
with that old dependable throb.
General Gasoline is always right—always ready for the
severest test you can give it — for General has always
the best qualities we know how to put into it.
