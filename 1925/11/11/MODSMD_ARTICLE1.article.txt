# E. F. STRADTHERR LANE INSTRUCTOR SHOT BY PATIENT
## Hope for Doctor's Recovery Voiced by Dean of Medical School 
### 
Dr. Edward F. Stradtlierr, of the
Stanford Medical School faculty, who
was shot four times yesterday by John
Walsh, a clinical patient at Lane Hos
pital, will recover unless infection de
velops. The most serious danger lies
in a wound in his left lung which
might set up an infection of the
pleura. There is a possibility, also, that
his intestines were pierced by one of
the bullets which entered his side.
"Dr. Stadtherr passed a good night,"
Dr. William Ophuls, Dean of the Medi
cal School, reports, "and we all hope
that he will recover. We will have to
watch him carefully for a few days,
however, before we can be ecrtain. No
-vital organs were injured, however,
and he is in good spirits."
Walsh Old Patient
Walsh, the man who shot Dr. Stad
therr, has been a patient at the Stan
ford clinic for some time. A fracture
of his arm was wired in the surgical
clinic. He recovered from the fracture,
hut complained of sensations in his
hand and forearm, which he believed
■were caused by the wire.
The physicians and surgeons, con
vinced that the trouble was not due
to the wiring but was caused by his
nervous condition, transferred him to
the nervous clinic, where careful study
convinced them that the trouble was
psychic rather than organic.
Believed Insane
Yesterday morning Walsh visited
Dr. Stadtherr and argued for the re
moval of the wire, but left seemingly
satisfied that the medical authorities
■were right and that the wire should
be allowed to remain. Later he re
turned, however, and without any pre
liminary, shot Dr. Stadtherr four times.
Although he gave himself up with
out any further outburst, the Stanford
physicians believe he is clearly insane.
