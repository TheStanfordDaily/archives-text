# ROUGHS STRUGGLE FOR FREE TICKETS DROPPED BY PLANE
## 
### 
Hundreds of roughs struggled for
possession of free tickets to the
football show, "Football Gaieties,"
to be given November 20 when a
hundred miniature footballs, fifty
of which contained tickets, were
dropped from an airplane, specially
hired for the occasion by the Dra
matic Council.
The plane was obtained from the
Varney Fields and was piloted by
Walter Varney, and carried in addi
tion Bob Coons and George Eis
man, two Stanford students.
The plane started down over En
cina and circled twice over the En
gineering Corner, Inner Quad, and
Library, twice letting forth showers
of baby footballs tied with red
streamers between the Library and
the car tracks.
