# CARDINAL VARSITY FORGETS DEFEAT, PREPARES FOR U.C.
## Pop Warner Shifts Freeman To Left Tackle Berth, Replacing Poulson 
### Wilbur Adams 
Last Saturday's disaster at Seattle
has been forgotten by Warner and his
band of football players, and the squad
is looking forward, and not backward.
To beat California is the big problem
that is confronting Stanford at pres
ent. Although the results of the contest
with the Huskies have been forgotten,
there are certain things that the team
will remember that will be helpful in
winning the Big Game on November
21. To lose a game at this time of the
season might demoralize some teams,
but not Stanford. The varsity has come
back to life again, after the relapse
of last Saturday. Real fight, and de
termination to win the California bat
tle, were evident in practice Monday
and Tuesday nights. With the excep
tion of Ward Poulson, the team is in
good condition and ready for the Big
Game. Captain Ernie Nevers brought
no injury with him from the North
land.
Freeman Replaces Poulson
Ward Poulson will be unable to play
in the Big Game because of a dis
located elbow he received in the
Washington game. To take his place
Pop Warner Cris Freeman
from guard to tackle. Freeman is a
fighter, and his playing at guard has
been of varsity caliber. Tiny Ilaffetto
is another likely candidate for the
tackle job. He is six feet one inch tall
and weighs 191 pounds. Both Freeman
and Raffetto are inexperienced, and
are playing their first year on the
varsity.
Next Saturday Stanford will engage
in a practice scrimmage with the Uni
versity of California, Southern Branch.
It is doubtful whether Warner will risk
the first-string players in the game.
Injuries so late in the season would
seriously hurt the Cards' chances of
winning the annual battle with Cali
fornia. The first team may even be
sent up to Berkeley to witness the
Bear-Husky contest.
Watch Berkeley Game
The results of the California-Wash
ington game Saturday will be of inter
est for several reasons. First, if U. C.
beats the Northerners, Stanford will
have a chance to tie for the conference
championship by defeating California
in the Big Game. U. S. C. would also be
in the tie with Washington, California,
and Stanford.
In the second place the game at
this week-end will provide
some dope as to the comparative mer
its of the Cards and the Bears. The
fact that the game will be played in
the Bear's back yard must be taken
into consideration. And, in the last
place, the California fan will be very
much interested in how the team
comes out of the battle. Will the Hus
kies put any of the Berkeley stars out
of the Big Game with injuries?
