# PROFESSOR GUERARD ADDRESSES FRENCH CLUB ON ART, PARIS
## 
### 
i "American art should have been
j represented at the Exposition des Arts j
j decoratifs this year. Both Spanish and
' modern American types of archit.ec-1
i ture are worthy of a place in the
! modern movement," declared Profes
-1 sor Albert Leon Guerard at a meeting
i of the French Club last night. "As it
I was, only two nations were repre-
I sented —France and the Soviet Repub-1
| lie."
! Professor Guerard, formerly assist
ant professor of French and now pro
fessor of general literature, told many
I interesting facts about Paris in gen
-1 eral. "Americans are very numerous
in Paris," he said, "and are great bar
gain hunters. They are greatly sur
prised to find that they can ride around
lin a taxi all afternoon for about a
, dollar and a half. but. they forget that
i it cost them two hundred dollars to,
I
i cross the ocean. One of the signs in a
Paris shop reads: 'English spoken—.
American understood'."
A group of two French songs was
1 sung by Marcel E. Touwaide before
the talk, with Ruth E. Sievers as ac
companist. Refreshments were served
I following the lecture.
