# BABE BASKETBALL MATERIAL SOUGHT BY COACH E. P. HUNT
## 
### 
Coach E. P. Hunt, frosh backetball
coach, has issued a call for all prospec
tive candidates for the freshman Ave
to report to him sometime next week
at his office in the Encina gymnasium.
Husky has not yet announced a defi
nite date for the first practice, as he
desires to confer with the candidates
indiviually before starting workouts.
It is understood that the chief reason
for this delay is that the frosh mentor
wishes to be sure that all his men will
be scholastic-ally eligible to compete
next quarter. Last year 9 men out of a
squad of 15 were declared ineligible
at the opening of the winter quarter,
and no repetition of this mishap will
be chanced by Coach Hunt this year.
As a preliminary measure for bol
stering up scholarship records, Hunt
has announced that men who worked
regularly during the past freshman
football season are not wanted on the
basketball court until next quarter.
This will give these men time to catch
up on studies and to insure a good fall
quarter record.
