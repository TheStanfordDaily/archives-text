# APPLICATIONS FOR ADMISSION TO BE CONSIDERED IN MAY
## 
### 
Applications for admission to the
| University will in the future be passed
on in May, provided they are filed be
fore the first of that month, accord
ing to the provisions of a new plan
adopted by the Committee on Admis
sion and Advanced Standing. Selection
of candidates has heretofore been
made in August.
Under the new system tli? tentative
selections will be based on three anil
a half year's work completed in pre
paratory school. The successful stu
dents will be admitted subject to their
satisfactory completion of the school
year by graduation or by passing col
lege entrance examinations, each can
didate being required to make his
choice of the procedure in advance.
The date of the required intelligence
examination has also been moved
ahead. The examinations will now be
given in February or March, instead of
in May, as was done last year.
Selection of new students for other
quarters will be made early in Decem
ber, March, and June. Under the new
plan applicants for admission will, if
unsuccessful, be enabled to register
at other colleges without loss of time.
The plan will allow more time for the
selection of candidates by the Commit
tee on Admission, which is becoming
of greater importance, as the number
of applications has been increasing
yearly. The limit of 450 last year was
exceeded by 150".
