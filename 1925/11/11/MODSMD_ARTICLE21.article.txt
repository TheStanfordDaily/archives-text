# The 						Perfect Date
## 
### 
The perfect date. What is it—or he? Many is the man who has
raved and ranted mentally, attempting to make himself THE PERFECT
DATE. We wish to raise the question, "lives there a man with soul so
dead, who never to himself hath said: Am I the Perfect Date?"—with all
due apologies for the partial plagiarism.
Now comes a composite picture of the Perfect Date as drawn by the
girls at Western Reserve of Cleveland in their answers to a recent ques
tionnaire. After reading their mutual definition, however, one is led to
believe that filling the bill would tax most any angel—much less the col
lege man.
To begin with, a snappy line of nonsense must be exhibited, followed
by an entertaining "line"; he must think well of ladies in general and one
lady in particular; should be somewhat religious; have an inexhaustable
fund of healthy slang ready for instant use and at the same time ready
execution; must neglect neither himself nor the girl in his choice of sub
jects of conversation; must be capable of convincing "sweet nothings" on
short notice; should wear eloquent ties; should never chew gum in public;
should be an all-around man athletically; must never "crash the gate" at
dances; frown upon "necking"; date up on Sunday; and promise a suc
cess in life.
Like all futuristic pictures of perfection, the above drawing has its vul
nerable spots probably occasioned by many humorous answers—but there
is food for thought in much of it. Chewing gum, for example. Its noise
has probably ruined more than one happy courtship. We wonder i f social
life at Stanford could not be conducted in a much smoother manner if
these requirements would be pasted on the mirror of every unhappy
"queener." Then, dates would be perfect.
That is. if Stanford women agree with those at Western Reserve and
assent to their definition.
