Reports from the east seem to indicate that professional football is
gaining a strong foothold in the larger cities. Teams playing Sunday
games in New York have been repeatedly drawing crowds of from 18,000
to 20,000 people.
As is natural, most of the participants are stars who have finished their
college careers ; few athletes receive football training outside of the schools
and colleges. In all cases the ranks of the professional teams will have to
be filled each year from former college men.
This professionalism brings a new angle to the sport which is objec
tionable from the point of view of college athletics; it adds an element
which may easily assume proportions that will seriously affect the outlook
of the college athlete. In many instances football in universities might
become pre-professional training, and any such idea is totally foreign to
our conception of amateur sport.
Professionalism will turn the mind of the public to the opinion that
football exists purely as a spectacle for commercial amusement. If car
ried to any great extent, this idea would affect both the athlete and the
student body as a whole. Any professional sport which will of necessity
draw its athletes almost wholly from colleges will deal a serious blow to
the best interest of amateur and college athletics.
