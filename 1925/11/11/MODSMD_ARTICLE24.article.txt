### Monroe Eaton 
CONGRESSMAN HILL'S FORESCAST
FOR 1927
United States and vicinity—
Moderately wet toward the clone of
the year with intermittent showers.
Heavy rains on the Atlantic and Pacific
seaboards occasioned by an area of
high pressure in Washington, D. C.
Temperature high throughout the
country with squalls in capitals of each
state. Kansas —dry; Kentucky—still.
Thunderstorms in congress and in
the prohibition department generally.
Moon obscured and generally cloudy,
with disaster to white mules. Shipping
brisk in Canada, France, and coast
wise trade suffers little damage. The
outlook is for a generally wet season
extending indefinitely.

PUBLICITY

Saw how he could get him great fame;
So he pulled out a hammer,
Proceeded to lam 'er
And there sprang into print his full
name!
