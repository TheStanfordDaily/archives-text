The Editor, Sir:
Perhaps you could find in a financial
summary the cause of the so-called
lack ,of Stanford spirit.
In the days when traditions were
being established here the tuition fee
was gratis and the cost of living mod
erate. The students naturally felt espe
cially grateful to the Stanfords; they
didn't have to work so hard to earn
money for innumerable fees, and
therefore had the desire and time to
show in some way their appreciation
of Stanford's unequalled opportunities.
This took the form of some action, and
through repetition a tradition was es
tablished.
Then came the tuition charge and
large incidental fees and added ex
pense. The traditions naturally con
tinued awhile, either because they
were enforced or simply from momen
tum. But with the removal of enforce
ment and the slowing down of mo
mentum most of them are dying fast.
Which only goes to show that they are
not of sufficient quality to justify their
existence.
Now here is where the financial
aspects pops up. There is a growing
discontent with the high cost of Stan
ford. I am neglecting the tuition fee,
as we accept that as a condition when
we come here, but I claim that we do
not have to accept the unreasonable
addition of expense placed on us and
on our parents by the controlling stu
dent body. The $21 incidental fee, if
not large enough to cover every aspect,
should be made to do so. and this ever
lasting collection of a dollar here and
a dollar there should be cut out.
Under the present system we buy
an option on student rights and either
we must add money to it or lose the
whole.
Take, for example, the football
games which every student is abso
lutely entitled to see. We must add 50
cents for conference games and, worst
of all, we had to pay 75 cents for a
frosli game. We must pay a dollar for
a student body play, and the football
show will cost a dollar and a quarter.
I imagine that if anyone stays away
from that he will be accused by the
Daily of lack of spirit. Does it cost a
dollar to show Stanford spirit? Isa (
bonfire any better because fifteen
hours are wasted by each frosh instead
of fifteen minutes? The present Ameri
can god of "bigness" is too prevalent
here. The motto seems to be "bigger
and better bonfires." Is the Rally Com
mittee's request that all stunts, no
matter how expensive, be submitted,
typical of student control?
In the Monday's Daily there is an
article on students who are kept out
of Stanford because of lack of money.
When we realize that every added ex
pense, no matter how small, is keeping
someone out, perhaps the winds of
freedom will blow a little stronger.
Yours for the real Stanford,
'29.

Now here is where the financial
aspects pops up. There is a growing
discontent with the high cost of Stan
ford. I am neglecting the tuition fee,
as we accept that as a condition when
we come here, but I claim that we do
not have to accept the unreasonable
addition of expense placed on us and
on our parents by the controlling stu
dent body. The $21 incidental fee, if
not large enough to cover every aspect,
should be made to do so. and this ever
lasting collection of a dollar here and
a dollar there should be cut out.
Under the present system we buy
an option on student rights and either
we must add money to it or lose the
whole.
Take, for example, the football
games which every student is abso
lutely entitled to see. We must add 50
cents for conference games and, worst
of all, we had to pay 75 cents for a
frosli game. We must pay a dollar for
a student body play, and the football
show will cost a dollar and a quarter.
I imagine that if anyone stays away
from that he will be accused by the
Daily of lack of spirit. Does it cost a
dollar to show Stanford spirit? Isa (
bonfire any better because fifteen
hours are wasted by each frosh instead
of fifteen minutes? The present Ameri
can god of "bigness" is too prevalent
here. The motto seems to be "bigger
and better bonfires." Is the Rally Com
mittee's request that all stunts, no
matter how expensive, be submitted,
typical of student control?
In the Monday's Daily there is an
article on students who are kept out
of Stanford because of lack of money.
When we realize that every added ex
pense, no matter how small, is keeping
someone out, perhaps the winds of
freedom will blow a little stronger.
Yours for the real Stanford,
'29.
The Editor, Sir:
Perhaps you could find in a financial
summary the cause of the so-called
lack ,of Stanford spirit.
In the days when traditions were
being established here the tuition fee
was gratis and the cost of living mod
erate. The students naturally felt espe
cially grateful to the Stanfords; they
didn't have to work so hard to earn
money for innumerable fees, and
therefore had the desire and time to
show in some way their appreciation
of Stanford's unequalled opportunities.
This took the form of some action, and
through repetition a tradition was es
tablished.
Then came the tuition charge and
large incidental fees and added ex
pense. The traditions naturally con
tinued awhile, either because they
were enforced or simply from momen
tum. But with the removal of enforce
ment and the slowing down of mo
mentum most of them are dying fast.
Which only goes to show that they are
not of sufficient quality to justify their
existence.
