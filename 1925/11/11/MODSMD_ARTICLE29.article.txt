<S> Ted Elias, Jr.
Let's forget the northern contest,
And regain our smiles and laughter;
Please remember, fellow students,
CALIFORNIA'S what we're after.

Sale of Quads has been reported
To have reached the thousand mark
Now no longer on the corners
Will the salesmen shout and park.

We will meet the Cal debaters,
For tonight the thing is set.
There will be a free admission;
Come around or you'll regret.

Sophs announce a yachting party,
Afterwards their annual dance;
If you want to make impressions,
This is sure a happy chance.

There was a big assembly,
Armistice to celebrate.
It was like it should have been,
So there's nothing to relate.
