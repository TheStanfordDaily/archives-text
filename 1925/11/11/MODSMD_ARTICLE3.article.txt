# Tuition Fee Evaders to Be Severely Penalized
## 
### 
E. S. Erwin, University accountant,
announces that from the present date
all students who fail to pay their sylla
bus fees within the specified time will
be dealt with severely. The evasions
that have been allowed in the past are
not going to be countenanced.
According to a University rule, all
students who do not get their syllabus
fees paid, or have arrangements made
for their payment, automatically suffer
the cancellation of registration in the
University. This rule is to be carried
out diligently from now on.
