# DEVINE DISCUSSES LEADERS OF MODERN WORLD REVOLUTIONS
## Present Uprisings Farther Reaching Than Those of Past, Says Speaker 
### 
"Every American has an obligation
to civilzation to become a world citi
zen," said Edward T. Devine in his lec
ture on "Three Modern Revolutionists'
yesterday evening. "The best way to
fit oneself for this is to study the lead
ers of modern revolutions. Never be
fore has there been such a revolution
as the present movement, not the
French revolution with its bloodshed, j
nor the Protestant Revolution, jior the
fall of the Roman Empire. Never be-j
fore has a revolution affected so many
people or the standard of living and
the basis of ideals and morals.
"Lenine, the Communist, Mussolini,
the fascist and nationalist, and the
Gandhi, the Saint, are the most repre
sentative of the various movements.
All were born in the period between
the end of the Civil and the beginning
of the Franco-Prussian war.
Lenin's Parents Aristocrats
"Lenine was born of parents of the
low Russian aristocracy, and brought
up in an atmosphere of culture and
family life. His brother was of the
Revolutionary party and was hanged
during the time when tyrrany was
tempered only by fear of assassination.
After his death, Lenine took over his
cause. While studying economics in
Saint Petersburg, he was exiled to Si
beria and at the end of his sentence,
his time was spent in the leading capi
tals of Europe, as he could not return
to Russia.
"After the fall of the Tsar and the
unsuccessful attempt at government by
Kerensky, who was a socialist of Ram
say Mac Donald's and Ebert's type,
the Soviet or Bolshevik government
was set up with Lenine at its head.
Changed Policies
"Under the first intent, the people
were to have all the land that they and
their family could cultivate, and give
the rest to the government, but the
peasants did not see the advantage of
this over the old plan. Lenine was the;
one revolutionist who was able to
change his policies in accordance with
the change of public sentiment. He
resolved not to have a counter-revolu
tion or at least if he did have one to
conduct it himself.
So the edict was changed so that the
peasants should give ten per cent of
their land to the government. His one
mistake was that he failed to reach the
people through their most pregnable

I point, their religion. He was a ma
! terialist and a declared atheist.
Mussolini Nationalist
"Mussolini, on the other hand,
i reached the Italians largely through
I their religion. Mussolini was the son
' o fa blacksmith. He was educated in
i Switzerland, but was deported during
' the early part of his life. He was a so
cialist. At the opening of the war, how
ever, he discovered that he was a pa
triot and an extreme nationalist.
"In contrast to both the first two is
the Hindu reformer, Gandhi. He is
highly religious and the principles of
his reform are non-violence, non-touch
ability, and independence of British
control. Non-touchability refers to the
outcasts of the Hindu caste who are
' not recognized by those of other castes,
jHe believes this to be wrong. Inde
j pendence from British control according
to Gandhi,. is impossible unless the
Hindus show ability to take care of
themselves. He wishes India to be ag
ricultural and not industrial. He is
| now a positive menace to British con
j trol, according to Devine.
