## 
### 
j The police of Perth Amboy, New
Jersey, acquired over the last week-end,
a list of a thousand violators of Sunday
blue laws framed in colonial days,*to
present to the grand jury on Friday.
Names were taken all through Mid
dlesex County, Sunday, of all persons
who played golf, drove motor cars,
walked elsewhere than to church, oper
ated news or bootblack stands, theaters,
drug stores, or engaged in any other
activities prohibited by the old vice and
immorality laws.
The compaign is a result of a move-
I ment started recently by the Perth Am
j boy Ministers' Association to close mo-
I tion picture theaters on Sunday. Thea
j ter owners protested that such a law
; would be discrimination against them
in that other violators of the old Sunday
laws were not included.
It is generally doubted throughout
the county that the grand jury will act
jon the charges. The general belief is
| that the whole proceedings are an at
, tempt to have the laws struck off the
I books as obsolete.
