# PROFESSOR SERVES ICES
## 
### 
Professors are usually regarded as
hard-hearted, but one has been found
at Ohio State University who possesses
the qualities necessary to be popular.
A professor there, after giving a final
i examination during the hot summer
quarter, served ice cream and wafers
jto his brain-wearied and finger
cramped students.
