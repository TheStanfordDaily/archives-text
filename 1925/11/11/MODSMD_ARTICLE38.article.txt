# FAMOUS MUSICIANS CANNOT APPEAR IN CAMPUS CONCERTS
## 
### 
Failure to secure two of the desired
artists has necessitated the cancella
tion of three concerts which were to
be held on the campus this year under
the auspices of the A. S. S. U. This
was decided at the Executive Commit
tee meeting last night.
Mischa Elman, one of the musicians
who was expected to appear, is not
coming to the Pacific Coast this year;
and Sousa's Band has shortened its
stay in San Francisco to such an ex
tent that it will find it impossible to
come down the peninsula. Cyra Van
Gordon was the third artist scheduled
to give a concert.
Wilfrid Davis, the originator of the
idea, petitioned the Executive Com
mittee at one of its first meetings of
the year to permit these programs. At
last week's meeting of the governing
board it was decided that the concerts
could be held providing 1500 people
pledged themselves to subscribe. The
decision given last night cancels the
idea.
