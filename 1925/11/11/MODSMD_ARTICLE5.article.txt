# ORGANIST TO PLAY SELECTIONS FROM BACH, FRANCK, COLE
## 
### Herbert Klein 
Warren D. Allen, University Or
ganist, will present a varied program
in the Memorial Church tomorrow
afternoon at 4:15 o'clock. "Meditation
religieuse" from Massenet's opera,
"Thais," is probably the best known of
the compositions. "Thais" has had
greater popularity than any other of
the operas of Jules Massenet, French
composer. The "Meditation" has an
appealing simple melody and is of intro
spective nature.
A Chorale-Prelude by John Sebas
tian Bach entitled, "We All Believe in
One God," will open the recital. Bach,
greatest figure in the earlier history of
music, was essentially religious, and
for a great part of his life was organist
and musical director of St. Thomas
Church in Liepsic, Germany. His
Chorale-Preludes were based on the
Lutheran hymn tune of the church ser
vice, and took their name and mood
from the hymn from which they were
derived. Nowhere is a more convincing
illustration of the mighty genius of
Bach to be found than in these great
Preludes which express his devotion
and faith.
Cesar Franck's "Pastorale in E Flat"
will follow. Franck's work is reminis
cent of Bach in that a great part of it
was for the organ, and in the poly
phonic forms laid down by Bach.
Franck lived in the nineteenth century
and laid the foundations for the midern
French school. He also was devoutly
religious and his music reflects the calm
mysticism of his temperament.
"Hymnus" and "Heroic Piece" are
compositions of Rossetter G. Cole, a
contemporary American composer, liv
ing in Chicago. He has written for or
gan and orchestra with much success.
"Heroic Piece" is a comparatively new
composition and is among Cole's most
vigorous works. As originally written
it was for organ and orchestra com
bined.
Next Tuesday Allen will play an en
tire program of the works of Richard
Wagner, whose monumental work
revolutionized the posibilities of the
opera as an expression of dramatic
emotion.
