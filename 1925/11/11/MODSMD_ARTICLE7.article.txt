## Gordon Davis Will Direct "Gaieties"; Wiggin in Charge of Music 
### Isabel Schanck 
J lie seat sale for the football show,
Football Gaieties," to be given No
vember 20, the evening preceding the
Big Game, will open tomorrow after
noon at 1 o'clock in the ticket office
in the Administration building. The
early seat sale is necessitated by the
fact that mail orders for tickets are
pouring in, and the campus needs must
be filled before the mail orders can be
attended to.
The "Gaieties" are under the direc
tion of Gordon Davis, dramatic coach.
This is the first campus musical show
which he has directed since 1919. He
gained experience through his work in
New York this summer when he di
rected "Polly," a musical comedy
which is a sequel to "The Beggar's
Opera." "Polly" is still having a suc
cessful run in New York.
Wiggin Directs Music
The football show music is in charge
of John L. Wiggin. Musical numbers
include original work by Kenneth
Hess, Jean Wakefield, John L. Wiggin,
and William Dekker.
A group of atmospheric songs, the
Moscow street ballads, will be sung
by a quartette from the Glee Club. The
program also has original skits by
David Lamson and Gregory William
son.
Chorus Numbers Novel
The beauty chorus consists of six
teen campus women under the direc
tion of Chrysella Dunker. Some excel
lent numbers are planned, including a
new football song by Jean Wakefield
which will be the motif for many
novel chorus formations. In addition,
original numbers by Kenneth Hess will
feature the chorus.
Dorothy Dahler will appear in an
imitation of Beatrice Lillie in a patri
otic number from Chariot's Revue.
Miss Dahler is one of the best-known
character actresses on the campus, and
is remembered for her work in "R. U.
R.," and "Ace High," the 1926 Junior
Opera. The women's chorus will assist
in this number.
