# FORENSIC SEASON COMMENCES WITH NO-DECISION MEET
## "Democracy Is an Illusion" Subject of Stanford Berkeley Contest 
### 
Fred M. Combellack and George N.
Crocker of Stanford upheld the af
firmative of the question: "Resolved,
That Democracy is an Illusion," in a
no-decision debate last night with
Stuart E. Strong and Gerald F. Bridges
of the University of California. The
debate was held in the Assembly hall,
while the first contest of the annual
dual meeting with California was held
Tuesday evening at Berkeley. Stanley
A. Weigel and Craven Scott upheld
the negative of the question for Stan
lord at Berkeley.
Difficulty in determining the exact
meaning of the question for debate
caused considerable confusion in argu
ments of the Cardinal and California
teams. California attacked the resolu
tion on the grounds that the theory of
democracy, although containing un
desirable characteristics in modern
states, was fundamentally sound. The
Stanford debaters argued that existing
democracy in states of the civilized
•world today included features that
were so undesirable to the efficiency
of the state, that the modern concep
tion could be termed an illusion.
Audience Votes
An audience vote taken at the close
of the debate on the merits of the
question alone, Regardless of argu
ments advanced in the debate itself,
resulted in 151 votes for the negative
to 108 for the affirmative. Professor
Graham H. Stuart of Stanford presided
at the debate.
Combellack and Crocker of Stanford
based the arguments of the affirmative
on the theory that democracy did not
make for the expert governmental con
trol demanded by the complex political
problems of today, and that democracy
as existing today was a menace to
leadership. The menace to leadership
in political fields was stated as espe
cially noticeable, while the men elected
to offices were unable to do other than
yield to public control of the electorate
in matters of governmental problems.
Trace Democracy
Bridges and Strong of California, in
presenting the case of the negative,
pointed out the steady growth of
democracy until nowadays the control
of the major part of four continents is
through this rule of the people. He tolu
of the opportunity which has been
given the people for controlling their
own government under democracy.
The example of the German govern
ment before the war was given as an
illustration of dangers arising under a
political system run by experts who
are beyond control of the people.
Strong closed by asking whether the
people would prefer to participate in
government, or to remain outside of
any control in governmental affairs,
even though the latter system be the
more efficient.
More than three hundred attended
the debate at Stanford last evening,
while the attendance at Berkeley was
estimated at four hundred. The annual
debate is the first varsity contest for
Stanford of the 1925 season.

A. Weigel and Craven Scott upheld
the negative of the question for Stan
lord at Berkeley.
Difficulty in determining the exact
meaning of the question for debate
caused considerable confusion in argu
ments of the Cardinal and California
teams. California attacked the resolu
tion on the grounds that the theory of
democracy, although containing un
desirable characteristics in modern
states, was fundamentally sound. The
Stanford debaters argued that existing
democracy in states of the civilized
•world today included features that
were so undesirable to the efficiency
of the state, that the modern concep
tion could be termed an illusion.
Audience Votes
An audience vote taken at the close
of the debate on the merits of the
question alone, Regardless of argu
ments advanced in the debate itself,
resulted in 151 votes for the negative
to 108 for the affirmative. Professor
Graham H. Stuart of Stanford presided
at the debate.
Combellack and Crocker of Stanford
based the arguments of the affirmative
on the theory that democracy did not
make for the expert governmental con
trol demanded by the complex political
problems of today, and that democracy
as existing today was a menace to
leadership. The menace to leadership
in political fields was stated as espe
cially noticeable, while the men elected
to offices were unable to do other than
yield to public control of the electorate
in matters of governmental problems.
Trace Democracy
Bridges and Strong of California, in
presenting the case of the negative,
pointed out the steady growth of
democracy until nowadays the control
of the major part of four continents is
through this rule of the people. He tolu
of the opportunity which has been
given the people for controlling their
own government under democracy.
The example of the German govern
ment before the war was given as an
illustration of dangers arising under a
political system run by experts who
are beyond control of the people.
Strong closed by asking whether the
people would prefer to participate in
government, or to remain outside of
any control in governmental affairs,
even though the latter system be the
more efficient.
More than three hundred attended
the debate at Stanford last evening,
while the attendance at Berkeley was
estimated at four hundred. The annual
debate is the first varsity contest for
Stanford of the 1925 season.
Fred M. Combellack and George N.
Crocker of Stanford upheld the af
firmative of the question: "Resolved,
That Democracy is an Illusion," in a

of the University of California. The
debate was held in the Assembly hall,
while the first contest of the annual
dual meeting with California was held
Tuesday evening at Berkeley. Stanley
A. Weigel and Craven Scott upheld
