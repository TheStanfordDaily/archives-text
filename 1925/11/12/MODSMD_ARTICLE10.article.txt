# UNDERTAKER HUNTS MISPLACED COFFIN
## 
### 
Lost —somewhere between Palo Alto
and an unknown fraternity house, an
object guaranteed to put fear into the
heart of any pledge—a coffin.
The owner of the coffin, a Palo Alto
undertaker, telephoned Dean Culver
recently to try to recover the coffin,
which he loaned to some fraternity
on the campus, with the expectation,
that it would be returned to him by a
certain date. Furthermore, he does not
know the name of the fraternity for
which the coffin was borrowed, nor
the name of the brother who took it.
