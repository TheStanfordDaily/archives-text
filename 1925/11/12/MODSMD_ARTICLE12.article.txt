# FOUR MEMBERS OF FIRST ELEVEN OUT OF U.C.S.B. GAME
## Nevers, Poulson, McCreery Confined to Hospital After Husky Game 
### Wilbur Adams 
Captain Ernie Nevers, Ward Poul
son, Hal McCreery, and Merrill Ar
mour are on the sick list and will prob
ably be given a rest this week-end
when the varsity football squad tan
gles with the University of California,
Southern Branch. However, Poulson
is the only one of the four that is so
seriously hurt that he will be out of
the Big Game. Nevers and McCreery
are both in the Palo Alto Hospital
suffering from blows in the head that
they received in the Washington game.
Armour is bothered with boils on his
feet.
Patchett Will Start
To take the places of the injured
men Pop Warner has been playing
Ernie Patchett at fullback, Cris Free
man at Poulson's tackle, Fred Price
at center, and Bob Hunt at Armour's
right guard job. Patchett is certain to
start this Saturday's game, because
Nevers will do a little scouting at the
Washington-California contest, if he is
able to leave the hospital by that time.
Freeman is first-string tackle now. He
will be playing in that position on
November 21 unless another change
is made. Price has seen action at end
this year but played center on the 1927
freshman team. Hunt has played in
two Big Games already, and he adds to
the team that one thing that it so
badly needs —experience.
Grizzlies Arrive Tomorrow
Coach Spaulding and his squad of
California Grizzlies from Los Angeles
are expected to arrive on the Stanford
campus tomorrow morning. The
Branch is at full strength and the
Cards are greatly weakened, so the
game should be close and hard fought.
The fact that the Branch defeated
Occidental 9 to 0, and Pomona, 26 to 0,
indicates that there will be no walk
away for Stanford this week-end. But
if St. Mary's first team was able to pile
up a 28 to 0 score against U. C. S. B.
in the California stadium two weeks
ago, Stanford's second team should be
able to do at least as well.
The fans will get their last look at
the Stanford varsity in action Satur
day, until it runs onto the field at 2
o'clock on November 21 —the day of
the Big Game. The squad goes in hid
ing sometime early next week. A real
rest will be administered during .this
period of seclusion, and from all indi
cations this is what the squad needs
most.

Southern Branch. However, Poulson
is the only one of the four that is so
seriously hurt that he will be out of
the Big Game. Nevers and McCreery
are both in the Palo Alto Hospital
suffering from blows in the head that
they received in the Washington game.
Armour is bothered with boils on his
feet.
Patchett Will Start
To take the places of the injured
men Pop Warner has been playing
Ernie Patchett at fullback, Cris Free
man at Poulson's tackle, Fred Price
at center, and Bob Hunt at Armour's
right guard job. Patchett is certain to
start this Saturday's game, because
Nevers will do a little scouting at the
Washington-California contest, if he is
able to leave the hospital by that time.
Freeman is first-string tackle now. He
will be playing in that position on
November 21 unless another change
is made. Price has seen action at end
this year but played center on the 1927
freshman team. Hunt has played in
two Big Games already, and he adds to
the team that one thing that it so
badly needs —experience.
Grizzlies Arrive Tomorrow
Coach Spaulding and his squad of
California Grizzlies from Los Angeles
are expected to arrive on the Stanford
campus tomorrow morning. The
Branch is at full strength and the
Cards are greatly weakened, so the
game should be close and hard fought.
The fact that the Branch defeated
Occidental 9 to 0, and Pomona, 26 to 0,
indicates that there will be no walk
away for Stanford this week-end. But
if St. Mary's first team was able to pile
up a 28 to 0 score against U. C. S. B.
in the California stadium two weeks
ago, Stanford's second team should be
able to do at least as well.
The fans will get their last look at
the Stanford varsity in action Satur
day, until it runs onto the field at 2
o'clock on November 21 —the day of
the Big Game. The squad goes in hid
ing sometime early next week. A real
rest will be administered during .this
period of seclusion, and from all indi
cations this is what the squad needs
most.
