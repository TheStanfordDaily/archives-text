# WATER POLO TEAM WORKING OUT DAILY AGAINST FRESHMEN
## First-Year Men Show Good Form in Scrimmaging Against Varsity 
### 
With this year's P. A. A. champion
! ships completed, Coach Ernst Brand
j sten is devoting his attention to build
ing up strong freshman and varsity
water polo teams. Scrimmages are
being held every afternoon in the
Encina pool between the two squads.
At the present time, many rough
| spots are showing up in the work of
j the water polo squad. The workouts
j are chiefly for the purpose of getting
the men into shape for the regular
I season. Passing is still ragged, and
teamwork is somewhat lacking, but
Brandsten expects to have a finished
team to meet California.
The freshmen have been showing up
well against the varsity. Burns, a for
mer Lowell High and Olympic Club
junior player, has shown promise at
either forward or center. Strong, an
other forward, has been developing
very accurate goal shooting. Other
freshmen whom Brandsten expects to
use are Hanna, Brown, Cole, and
Rainy. Artman, freshman football star,
will also report for the squad.
Members of the varsity squad who
have been scrimmaging regularly are
Arden Allen, water polo captain, Art
Stewart, and Bob Williams. Harry An
drews, Van Den Akker, Dixon Smith,
Harry Maltby, and Bob Harris of last
year's freshman team are also work
ing out for the varsity.
