Following the round-table discussion j

house for all convention delegates. '
This will be followed by the conven- j

ford Union, which will last until mid- j
night.
This convention is the third to be ;
held here under the auspices of Sigma i
Delta Chi, and the first under the new j
constitution of the association adopted j
last spring. A meeting of high school j
journalists was called by Sigma Delta
Chi in the spring of 1923. Last spring
a second meeting was held and at that
time a constitution was formed and
officers were elected for this year. It
was decided to change the meetings
from the end of the year to the begin
ning so that the editors would be able
to work out some of the ideas they
gathered at the convention.
The convention will close at noon
Saturday so that the delegates can see
the Stanford-U. C. S. B. football game.

The first Rugby game in the United
States was played at Harvard Uni
versity against McGill in 1874. Harvard
won.
