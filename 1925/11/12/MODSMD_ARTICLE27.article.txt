# Hospitality

About 250 high school journalists will arrive on the campus tomorrow
morning to attend the annual convention of the California Scholastic
Press Association, held under the auspices of the Stanford chapter of
Sigma Delta Chi, professional journalistic fraternity. These students and
their faculty advisors will be our guests until after lunch Saturday, and
confidently expect to enjoy the same cordial hospitality which Stanford
has extended to delegates to similar conventions in the past.
Sigma Delta Chi men, Professors Everett W. Smith and Buford Brown
of the Division of Journalism, and members of the staffs of campus
publications have asumed the burden of planning and supervising most of
the details of the convention. But the task of entertaining 250 visitors is
so great that the help of every member of the student body is needed.
Living groups have already come forward and consented to house the
delegates Friday night. But if all the high school journalists who have
signified their intention of attending actually make the trip there will be a
shortage of sleeping quarters. The convention committee is appealing to
the hall men, since the fraternities have agreed to care for five delegates
each, to donate the use of unoccupied beds Friday night. Many students
leave the campus over the week-end, and it should not seriously incon
venience them to respond to the committee's request.
High school journalists who have attended previous conventions on the
campus have returned to their homes with very definite ideas of Stanford's
hospitality. If every student will take it upon himself to give each
delegate whom he sees a cordial "Hello" and try to make him feel at
home, Stanford's obligation will be fulfilled and the convention will be an
unqualified success.
