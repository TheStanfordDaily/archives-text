# CAMPUS OPINION

The Editor, Sir:
In a recent Campus Opinion "F. 8.,
'26" declares that with the abolition of
sophomore "discipline" has disap
peared the "Old Stanford Spirit," and
calls upon loyal old-timers to concen
trate high-powered contempt on '29 to
bring them back to the ways of their
fathers. Now "A Disillusioned Frosh."
who has read "At Good Old Siwash"
and kindred classics and listened to
holdovers' romantic reminiscences,
yearns for the paddle and the tub and
a return of the good old days. And
you. Mr. Editor, want to know "what
lias become of the spirit(?)-loving, tra
dition-respecting Stanford rough of five
or tfin years ago?"
The inference is that he is disap
pearing, and the question is: what
shall we do about it? My answer is:
rejoice! We can well do without his
unwashed cords, unshaven face, pro
fane speech, and collegiate provincial
ism. And as for the so-called (and mis
called) sophomore "discipline," I count
it a distinct gain that the time and
talents of the lower classes are no
longer wasted and perverted by all
that that institution entailed. Perhaps
it is significant that since its aboli
tion freshman athletic successes have
increased and freshman scholarship
lias steadily risen.
What if they do abandon their
dinks, queen on the Quad, and threaten
the law-steps tradition? These are so
many indications that the abolition of
"discipline" was the emancipation of
intelligence. And if rallies are not as
popular as of yore, be it noted that
there are two types of students that
stay away: one the blasg, can't-be-both
ered gilded lily, with a loyalty to no
higher purpose than to seek his own
amusement; and the other, the student
who has found that there are oppor
tunities and a purpose in university
life compared with which rallies and
games are of only secondary import
ance.
If the "old days when frosh were
frosh and sophs were sophs," and only
graduated students were expected to
be men. are really gone—let them go.
and with them, the "Old Stanford
Spirit." Let "F. B." and "Disillusioned"
seek the New Stanford Spirit that may
make Stanford a university worthy of
the name. —T '25.

The Editor, Sir:
The decadence of the Stanford Spirit
can be attributed to the disappearance
of Stanford traditions. T believe that
the underlying causes of this unfor
tunate situation may be listed as fol
lows:
1. The attitude of the University au
thorities toward traditions, which na
turally influences entering students.
2. The increasing expenses of an
education here, taking many men of

small means out of the active student
life, where they would prove valuable.
3. The element of the Junior College
transfers, the constantly increasing
| number of men who oome here as
upperclassmen, and thus lack the bene
ficial background of the underclass
! years.
4. The refusal to allow students to
watch the football team in practice,
which tends to make the Saturday
game too much of a staged spectacle
with too little of personal interest.
This is not a criticism, but is a state
ment of an obvious condition resulting
from the present system.
5. The lack of distinction between
college ( hisses. Privileges for a senior
and a freshman are practically the
same. Class numerals are forgotten or
seldom used in connection with a per
son's name. Where now is the ardent
desire to become a soph and smoke
cigarettes around the campus or walk
down the law steps, the thrill in the
first pair of cords and the extra privi
leges it means, or the pride in the
"som"?
6. The lack of influence of the older
students upon the freshmen, who can
associate practically only among them
selves. Their ideas are formulated
without contact with men of other
: classes. This makes for slower assimi
l lation.
7. The greatest single cause is, of
course, the abolition of sophomore
discipline with the failure to provide
an adequate substitute, the sponsor
system having been found wanting.
The idea that a tradition if it be worth
while need not be enforced is poppy
jcock; it. takes a man a couple of years
I to realize just how worthwhile our tra
ditions are .(Ask any old-timer!) The
class of 1925 was the one which, under
duress, "voluntarily" gave up sopho
more discipline, so we have not among
; our four undergraduate classes, one
which ever obeyed or enforced tradi
! tions properly.
There is no panacea which can be
suggested. But it would go far toward
, reviving the good old Stanford Spirit
if we could have regulated sophomore
discipline. The traditions would mean
j something. We would have the clear
j cut distinctions again between the
classes. There would be at least a sem
blance of pep among the students. And
I'd wager my last twelve cents that if
a vote could be taken among the pres
ent freshman class, at least, sixty per
cent of them would favor the change,
in the hopes that. Stanford might re
semble the Stanford they had heard
and dreamt it was.
Respectfully, Class of '23.

The Editor, Sir:
The decadence of the Stanford Spirit
can be attributed to the disappearance
of Stanford traditions. T believe that
the underlying causes of this unfor
tunate situation may be listed as fol
lows:
1. The attitude of the University au
thorities toward traditions, which na
turally influences entering students.
2. The increasing expenses of an
education here, taking many men of

small means out of the active student
life, where they would prove valuable.
3. The element of the Junior College
transfers, the constantly increasing
| number of men who oome here as
upperclassmen, and thus lack the bene
ficial background of the underclass
! years.
4. The refusal to allow students to
watch the football team in practice,
which tends to make the Saturday
game too much of a staged spectacle
with too little of personal interest.
This is not a criticism, but is a state
ment of an obvious condition resulting
from the present system.
5. The lack of distinction between
college ( hisses. Privileges for a senior
and a freshman are practically the
same. Class numerals are forgotten or
seldom used in connection with a per
son's name. Where now is the ardent
desire to become a soph and smoke
cigarettes around the campus or walk
down the law steps, the thrill in the
first pair of cords and the extra privi
leges it means, or the pride in the
"som"?
6. The lack of influence of the older
students upon the freshmen, who can
associate practically only among them
selves. Their ideas are formulated
without contact with men of other
: classes. This makes for slower assimi
l lation.
7. The greatest single cause is, of
course, the abolition of sophomore
discipline with the failure to provide
an adequate substitute, the sponsor
system having been found wanting.
The idea that a tradition if it be worth
while need not be enforced is poppy
jcock; it. takes a man a couple of years
I to realize just how worthwhile our tra
ditions are .(Ask any old-timer!) The
class of 1925 was the one which, under
duress, "voluntarily" gave up sopho
more discipline, so we have not among
; our four undergraduate classes, one
which ever obeyed or enforced tradi
! tions properly.
There is no panacea which can be
suggested. But it would go far toward
, reviving the good old Stanford Spirit
if we could have regulated sophomore
discipline. The traditions would mean
j something. We would have the clear
j cut distinctions again between the
classes. There would be at least a sem
blance of pep among the students. And
I'd wager my last twelve cents that if
a vote could be taken among the pres
ent freshman class, at least, sixty per
cent of them would favor the change,
in the hopes that. Stanford might re
semble the Stanford they had heard

The Editor, Sir:
The decadence of the Stanford Spirit
can be attributed to the disappearance
of Stanford traditions. T believe that
the underlying causes of this unfor
tunate situation may be listed as fol
lows:
1. The attitude of the University au
thorities toward traditions, which na
turally influences entering students.
2. The increasing expenses of an
education here, taking many men of

small means out of the active student
life, where they would prove valuable.
3. The element of the Junior College
transfers, the constantly increasing
| number of men who oome here as
upperclassmen, and thus lack the bene
ficial background of the underclass
! years.
4. The refusal to allow students to
watch the football team in practice,
which tends to make the Saturday
game too much of a staged spectacle
with too little of personal interest.
This is not a criticism, but is a state
ment of an obvious condition resulting
from the present system.
5. The lack of distinction between
college ( hisses. Privileges for a senior
and a freshman are practically the
same. Class numerals are forgotten or
seldom used in connection with a per
son's name. Where now is the ardent
desire to become a soph and smoke
cigarettes around the campus or walk
down the law steps, the thrill in the
first pair of cords and the extra privi
leges it means, or the pride in the
"som"?
6. The lack of influence of the older
students upon the freshmen, who can
associate practically only among them
selves. Their ideas are formulated
without contact with men of other
: classes. This makes for slower assimi
l lation.
7. The greatest single cause is, of
course, the abolition of sophomore
discipline with the failure to provide
an adequate substitute, the sponsor
system having been found wanting.
The idea that a tradition if it be worth
while need not be enforced is poppy
jcock; it. takes a man a couple of years
I to realize just how worthwhile our tra
ditions are .(Ask any old-timer!) The
class of 1925 was the one which, under
duress, "voluntarily" gave up sopho
more discipline, so we have not among
; our four undergraduate classes, one
which ever obeyed or enforced tradi
! tions properly.
There is no panacea which can be
suggested. But it would go far toward
, reviving the good old Stanford Spirit
if we could have regulated sophomore
discipline. The traditions would mean
j something. We would have the clear
j cut distinctions again between the
classes. There would be at least a sem
blance of pep among the students. And
I'd wager my last twelve cents that if
a vote could be taken among the pres
ent freshman class, at least, sixty per
cent of them would favor the change,
in the hopes that. Stanford might re
semble the Stanford they had heard
and dreamt it was.
Respectfully, Class of '23.
