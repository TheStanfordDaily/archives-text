PROFESSOR SHUFFLEMORE
ON THE CHARLESTON
"The Charleston," says Professor
Swirl N. Shufflemore, instructor of
dancing at one of the palatial South
San Francisco dance halls, in a recent
interview, "has swept the country like
wildfire. It is being done by everyone,
even the best families.
"As a judge of endurance and as a
gauge of one's balance, nothing can
compare to that famous southern dan
atep. 'The successful contestantce"
compare to that famous Southern
dance step. The successful contestant
in the Charleston open dance floor con
test held at our dancing palace last
Monday morning won the prize, a
beautiful pair of tin-soled Charleston
shoes, by dancing on one foot on the
window sill until all the phonograph
needles were used up, a period of eight
hours, thirty-six minutes, and twenty
seconds.
"All the better wrecking companies
have a crew of Charleston dancers. It
has been proven that the use of
Charlestoners is a much quicker way
to tear down a building than the old
method.
"I predict," continued Professor
Shufflemore, "that the Charleston has
great possibilities and in the near fu
ture should take its place beside the
Polka, the Mazurka, and the Virginia
Reel." —H. I.

Contributors to the "Student Opin
ion" column have lately been discus
sing various evils which cause the
freshmen to chafe under their dinks.
By experience we have found that the
best remedy for chafing under the dink
is the application of cold cream (pre
ferably not vanishing cream) night
and morning. For the chafing members
of the Class of '29 who have not got
access to any of Roble's cold cream,
we recommend a fistful of butter from
the Encina dining hall as the next
best substitute.
