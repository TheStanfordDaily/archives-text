# "LOCARNO TREA TIES SHOW FUTURE OF LEAGUE''-WEST
## 
### 
"The Locarno treaties reinforce
rather than restrict the League of
Nations, and are patent evidence that
the League is a going concern," said
Professor Victor J. West of the Politi
cal Science department, in an inter
view on the subject of the new Euro
pean pacts signed at the recent con
ference held at Locarno, Switzerland
Further guarantees for the peace of
Europe are provided for in the se
curity pact and guarantee treaty which
were voluntarily signed by the repre
sentatives of five of the principal west
ern European nations. A strip of ter
ritory in Alsace-Lorraine is to remain
unfortified as a step toward the sta
bility of boundary lines, and in case
of infringement by either France or
Germany, Great Britain and Italy are
to come to the aid of the offended
nation. This treaty is to be effective
as soon as Germany becomes a mem
ber of the League of Nations. Another
arbitration court called the Perma
nent Reconciliation Commission is also
provided for by the Locarno pacts.

"The treaty concerning the boun
daries is better than the guarantees
of Belgium under the old Tripple Alli
ance and Triple Entente because there
exists some way of actually getting
action, in case of violation," continued
Professor West. "Enforcement of the
Locarno treaties will me made through

machinery of the League, the council
of the League of Nations, and the
International Court. Under the guaran
tees of the neutrality of Belgium there
existed no such agency.
"Germany's position in regard to
this treaty shows her to be back on
an equal footing with "\he other na
tions of Europe. She was forced to
accept the Versailles treaty, but this
one was mutually agreed to without
compulsion. The Locarno pacts do not
release Germany from the Versailles
treaty, but are supplementary to it.
Reinforce League
"Although the Lovarno treaties are
reinforcements to the League of Na
tions, they are not superfluous. It is
doubtful if the nations could get Ger
many into the state of mind whereby
she would take the first step toward
entrance to the League without a pre
liminary agreement. On the basis of
this treaty Germany will get into the
League of Nations, since the pact will
not be effective until she is a mem
ber.
"A possible breach between America
and Europe may be the result of the
pacts, since United States is outside
of the League, and the European na
tions are more bound up with one
another than ever before. War debts
owed to the United States by Europe
might be the foundation for hostility,"
said Professor West.

machinery of the League, the council

existed no such agency.
"Germany's position in regard to
this treaty shows her to be back on
an equal footing with "\he other na
tions of Europe. She was forced to
accept the Versailles treaty, but this
one was mutually agreed to without
compulsion. The Locarno pacts do not
release Germany from the Versailles
treaty, but are supplementary to it.
Reinforce League
"Although the Lovarno treaties are
reinforcements to the League of Na
tions, they are not superfluous. It is
doubtful if the nations could get Ger
many into the state of mind whereby
she would take the first step toward
entrance to the League without a pre
liminary agreement. On the basis of
this treaty Germany will get into the
League of Nations, since the pact will
not be effective until she is a mem
ber.
"A possible breach between America
and Europe may be the result of the
pacts, since United States is outside
of the League, and the European na
tions are more bound up with one
another than ever before. War debts
owed to the United States by Europe
might be the foundation for hostility,"
said Professor West.
"The Locarno treaties reinforce
rather than restrict the League of
Nations, and are patent evidence that
the League is a going concern," said
Professor Victor J. West of the Politi
cal Science department, in an inter
view on the subject of the new Euro
pean pacts signed at the recent con
ference held at Locarno, Switzerland
Further guarantees for the peace of
Europe are provided for in the se
curity pact and guarantee treaty which
were voluntarily signed by the repre
sentatives of five of the principal west
ern European nations. A strip of ter
ritory in Alsace-Lorraine is to remain
unfortified as a step toward the sta
bility of boundary lines, and in case
of infringement by either France or
Germany, Great Britain and Italy are
to come to the aid of the offended
nation. This treaty is to be effective
as soon as Germany becomes a mem
ber of the League of Nations. Another
arbitration court called the Perma
nent Reconciliation Commission is also
provided for by the Locarno pacts.
Boundaries Defined
"The treaty concerning the boun
daries is better than the guarantees
