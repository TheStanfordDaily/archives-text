# DAY'S DOINGS
## 
### 
<S> Ted Elias, Jr. <
High School writers hold convention,
Friday is the day they've set.
Freshmen give Encina blow-out,
"29" will grow up yet.
Ernie Nevers, Stanford Captain,
Shows results of what he got
At the hands of Bagshaw's Huskies,
Who have made the going hot.
Editor has left the city,
Several days ere he'll be back,
Hershey Rogers leaving also,
No one 'round here to keep track.
Applications for admission,
Will be passed on now in May,
For the Frosh of future classes,
Sooner comes the judgment day.
