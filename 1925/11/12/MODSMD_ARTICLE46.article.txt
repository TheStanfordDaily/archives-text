## 
### Frank Baker 
Stanford debaters completed a suc
cessful season last spring, with the
Mcdaille JofTre Debate as its climax.
Robert C. Littler, chairman of the De
bating Committee for 1924-25 handed
to the Executive Committee a report
of twelve intercollegiate contests and
several minor contests.
The season opened with a triangular
debate between Stanford, the Univer
sity of California, and the University of
Southern California. The contests took
place in Berkeley, San Francisco, and
Los Angeles, with a man from each
college upholding one of the presiden
tial candidates: Davis, LaFollette, or
Coolidge. In each case, the man speak
ing for Coolidge won the debate. Rob
ert C. Littler-was the Stanford debater
who upheld the president. In Novem
ber the Pacific Forensic League Confer
ence was held here, and an extemporan
eous speaking contest was won by Stan
ley A. Weigel, of Stanford.
Oxford Debate Brilliant
One of the most interesting and bril
liant debates to take place on this cam
pus was that between Stanford and Ox
ford on the prohibition question. The
Oxford debaters travelled throughout
the country speaking on the negative
side. An audience vote gave the debate
to Stanford by a three to one majority.
Another contest in which Stanford and
California united against Oxford on
prohibition ended in a two to one de
cision in favor of the California schools.
A radio debate was held between
Stanford and Oregon. Alfred E. Fra
zier and W. L. Gosslin spoke on the
negative side of the liquor question for
Stanford, broadcasting from the Oak
land Tribune, while the Oregon team
broadcasted from the Portland Ore
gonian.
Immigration Discussed
Several debates were staged on the
question "Resolved, That the immigra
tion law of 1924 should be amended to
include the immigration of Japanese."
Craven Scott and Raymond W. Bruce

took the negative side against the Uni
versity of Utah on April 3 in the Little
Theater, and though losing the judges'
decision, won a majority in an audience
vote. Later in the same week Theodore
F. Baer and Darrell Parker debated
against the Kansas Agriculture Col
lege. There was no decision rendered,
but the talks were followed by a lively
open forum discussion.
Six minor debates on the above topic
were handled by speakers picked from
a group of men who had never repre
sented Stanford before. In the spring
vacation the men went to Southern Cali
fornia and contested with the California
Institute of Technology, Pomona Col
lege, and the University of California,
Southern Branch. George Crocker and
Hugh Lindsay were given the best men
tion of the new men.
Freshmen Beat U.C.
The freshmen defeated the Univer
sity of California freshmen in two con
tests, winning unanimous decisions in
both debates.
Women's debating had a great re
vival last year after having been a zero
quantity for several years. Anne Har
ris and Eleanor Davidson won a decis

ive victory over California, and were
given very honorable mention. Kath
leen Woodward deserved credit for put
ting over the debate.
For the fourth time in as many years
the Medaille Joffre debate was won by
a Stanford man. The general topic of
the "French Policy in Asia and Africa"
was given to the men two months be
fore the contest, then an hour before
they were to appear, a specific topic
was given to each. John C. Duniway
was the Stanford debater to receive
the honor. Robert E. Lewis and Vic
tor Hunt Harding also represented the
Cardinal.

of twelve intercollegiate contests and
several minor contests.
The season opened with a triangular
debate between Stanford, the Univer
sity of California, and the University of
Southern California. The contests took
place in Berkeley, San Francisco, and
Los Angeles, with a man from each
college upholding one of the presiden
tial candidates: Davis, LaFollette, or
Coolidge. In each case, the man speak
ing for Coolidge won the debate. Rob
ert C. Littler-was the Stanford debater
who upheld the president. In Novem
ber the Pacific Forensic League Confer
ence was held here, and an extemporan
eous speaking contest was won by Stan
ley A. Weigel, of Stanford.
Oxford Debate Brilliant
One of the most interesting and bril
liant debates to take place on this cam
pus was that between Stanford and Ox
ford on the prohibition question. The
Oxford debaters travelled throughout
the country speaking on the negative
side. An audience vote gave the debate
to Stanford by a three to one majority.
Another contest in which Stanford and
California united against Oxford on
prohibition ended in a two to one de
cision in favor of the California schools.
A radio debate was held between
Stanford and Oregon. Alfred E. Fra
zier and W. L. Gosslin spoke on the
negative side of the liquor question for
Stanford, broadcasting from the Oak
land Tribune, while the Oregon team
broadcasted from the Portland Ore
gonian.
Immigration Discussed
Several debates were staged on the
question "Resolved, That the immigra
tion law of 1924 should be amended to
include the immigration of Japanese."
Craven Scott and Raymond W. Bruce

took the negative side against the Uni
versity of Utah on April 3 in the Little
Theater, and though losing the judges'
decision, won a majority in an audience
vote. Later in the same week Theodore
F. Baer and Darrell Parker debated
against the Kansas Agriculture Col
lege. There was no decision rendered,
but the talks were followed by a lively
open forum discussion.
Six minor debates on the above topic
were handled by speakers picked from
a group of men who had never repre
sented Stanford before. In the spring
vacation the men went to Southern Cali
fornia and contested with the California
Institute of Technology, Pomona Col
lege, and the University of California,
Southern Branch. George Crocker and
Hugh Lindsay were given the best men
tion of the new men.
Freshmen Beat U.C.
The freshmen defeated the Univer
sity of California freshmen in two con
tests, winning unanimous decisions in
both debates.
Women's debating had a great re
vival last year after having been a zero
quantity for several years. Anne Har
ris and Eleanor Davidson won a decis

ive victory over California, and were
given very honorable mention. Kath
leen Woodward deserved credit for put
ting over the debate.
For the fourth time in as many years
the Medaille Joffre debate was won by
a Stanford man. The general topic of
the "French Policy in Asia and Africa"
was given to the men two months be
fore the contest, then an hour before
they were to appear, a specific topic
was given to each. John C. Duniway
was the Stanford debater to receive
the honor. Robert E. Lewis and Vic
tor Hunt Harding also represented the
Cardinal.
Stanford debaters completed a suc
cessful season last spring, with the
Mcdaille JofTre Debate as its climax.
