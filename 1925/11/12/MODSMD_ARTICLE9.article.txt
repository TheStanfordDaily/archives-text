# NEW TIMING METHOD IN FOOTBALL PROVES SUCCESS IN TRYOUT
## Number of Plays, Instead of Minutes, Limits Periods In Eastern Game 
### 
In a game between Brown and Bos
ton universities, played at Providence,
R. 1., last Saturday, the method of
timing the contest provided by the
rules was discarded and the number
of plays instead of minutes limited the
quarter.
This is the first time in the history
of modern football that this system
has been used. The tryout was given
under the official sanction of the foot
ball rules committee, and in the opin
ion of officials, coaches, and spec
tators, the experiment was an unquali
fied success.
Under the system agreed to, the first
two periods consisted of forty plays,
the last two, of thirty-five. The actual
playing time by quarters was 14 min
uter, 20 seconds; 14:16, 13:50,, and
13:5. Harry L. Coffin, Harvard '94, one
of the originators of the system, in
tends to have it incorporated in the
official football rules.
According to Coffin, the play system
eliminates stalling. "It is particularly
valuable," he says, "in a final period
when a losing team is likely to resort
to a series of forward passe?. Under
the present system, every time there
is an uncompleted forward pass, twen
ty-five seconds are lost. Under the
play system, every forward pass,
whether completed or not, counts a a
a play. This makes for a much faster
game, and does away with any suspi
cion of juggling the time?."
Officials of the game expressed satis
faction with the system, and voiced
the opinion that it would be eventually
adopted by all colleges.
