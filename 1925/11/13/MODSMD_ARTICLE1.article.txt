# SOUTHERN BRANCH MEETS CARDINAL ELEVEN TOMORROW
## Coach Spaulding Possesses Strongest Eleven in Southern League 
### Wilbur Adams 
The University of California, South
ern Branch, will meet what is left of
(he Card varsity in the Stanford sta-j
dium tomorrow at 2:30 o'clock. In-j
juries will keep Harris, Poulson, Nev
ers, McCreery, and Armour out of the j
game tomorrow. Besides, Warner is '
sending several first-string players up .
to Berkeley to watch the Huskies and j
the Bears fight it out for the Pacific j
Coast football title.
Leo Harris, right tackle on the var- j
sity football team, underwent a minor j
operation on his leg last night, as a
final result of the Stanford-Washing- j
ton football game that was played in j
Seattle last Saturday. Harris is resting j
easily today, according to doctors' re- j
ports.
Kerr in Charge
Declared by the attending physician.
Dr. T. M. Williams, to be in perfect J
condition, Ernie Nevers, Stanford foot
ball captain, was released this morn- j
ing from the Palo Alto hospital where |
he has been under observation for
for nerve trouble since the Washing
ton game. He is expected to accompany
Pop Warner and several members of
the varsity squad to Berkeley tomor-1
row to watch the California-Washing
ton game.
Andy Kerr will be in charge of the I
Cards down here on the "Farm" to
morrow. The starting lineup is a brand
new one and reads like this: Moore
and Middleton, ends; Raffetto and'
Freeman, tackles; Hunt and S. Post,!
guards; Price, center; Solomon, quar-1
terback; Hyland and Hill, halfbacks; i
and Patchett, fullback. With this team
on the field it should be a real battle
tomorrow against the Branch.
Southerners Are Strong
The Branch's main strength rests
on the small shoulders of Cy Walton, i
who is one of the most sensational j
players that has been seen in the
Southern league this season. His |
speed last week against the Redlands
College accounted for 180 yards of the,
entire total of 300 yards registered by
the Grizzlies. Georgie Ray is another
player that Stanford will have to
watch. Running back kickoffs and
punts are Ray's strong points.
The Southern California Football
Conference is practically in the hands
of U. C. S. B. They are without a doubt
the strongest team in the South with ,
the exception of U. S. C. The Grizzlies ■
had one off day this season, and while
they were dozing, Whittiev College,
slipped over a victory on them. The l
probable lineup for tomorrow's game
is as follows:
Stanford — U. C. S. B. —
Middleton LER Bressee
Freeman LTR Gardner i
S. Post LGR Hollingsworth
Price C Hastings
Hunt RGL Wentzell
Raffetto RTL Hudson |
Moore REL Beck
Solomon Q Birlenbacli:
Hyland LHR Walton
Hill RHL Turney
Patchett F Ray
