Murray Cuddeback, last year's
Big Game star, claims that Califor
nia will have a hot time a week
from tomorrow trying to defeat Pop
Warner's varsity. Cuddeback was
the one that, almost single-handed,
tied the California-Stanford game
for the Cards last season. He kicked
two field goals in the first half, and
caught the final pass that gave
Stanford a total of nineteen points
in the last period. Cuddeback says:
"I am not a prophet and I do
not pretend to know who will
win the Big Game. I do not
think that anybody really
knows who will serpentine on
November 21. I do know that
it will be a game of games.
'Both teams have a strong at
tack and I believe that both
teams will score. There is no
team on earth that can com
pletely stop Nevers, that big,
blonde, bad, battering back,
and his little Cardinal play
mates will raise hell with Cali
fornia."
Signed: Murray Cuddeback.
