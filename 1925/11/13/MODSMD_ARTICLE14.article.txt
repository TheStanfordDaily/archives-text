# RALSTON SPEAKS ON INTERNATIONAL LAW
## 
### 
"The right or wrong in international
dealings must be studied," said Jack
son H. Ralston, retired judge of Palo
Alto, at the meeting of the League
of Nations Non-Partisan Association in
the Little Theatre last evening.
The meeting was held in commem
oration of Grotius, Dutch international
law expert of the seventeenth century.
Ralston's subject was "Grotius and
the Origin of Modern International
Law." "At present the victor nation
lays down the law to the vanquished
after a conflict," said Ralston, "and
usually with disastrous results."
