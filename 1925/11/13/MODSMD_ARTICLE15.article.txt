# EIGHTY-ONE WILL RACE IN ANNUAL THREE-MILE GRIND
## Breakers Club Favored in Intramural Distance Run Tomorrow 
### 
Eighty-one men have entered the j
annual intramural cross-country run, j
scheduled to take place tomorrow just ;
before the football game with the I
Southern Branch. This is one of the !
best turnouts in the history of the |
event.
A number of living groups have en
tered-teams in the run. Breakers, win
ner of the event last year, is again !
favored to cop first place honors. Beta
Theta Pi is also entering a strong
team, and should give the Breakers a
hard battle for the title. Phi Kappa;
I Sigma, Delta Upsilon, Theta Chi, Delta j
Chi, Los Arcos, and El Capitan are |
among the other groups given a chance j
for high place points.
Twelve Unattached
Twelve unattached runners are in
| the race. Most of these men are fresh
men and their showing tomorrow will
I give an idea on the strength of the
j first-year men for the coming track |
season.
I
Ranney, winner of the individual
! first place last year, is conceded a
little better than an even chance to
win the event again. Carlsmith, Break
: ers, one of the leaders in last year's
1 race, should be well up among the
leaders. Briggs, Beta, and Waterhouse,
j Beta, are expected to figure in the first
i five.
Course Shortened
The course has been shortened near
ly half a mile so that the entire dis
tance of tomorrow's race will cover
approximately three miles of campus
territory. The runners will commence
! from the 220' start in the stadium a
j little before the beginning of the var
! sity football game. The course leads
once around the track, out of the sta
dium entrance to the old track, from
i there past the military department,
| across the fields, and up to the Sigma
Nu house. From there the return leads
I back over practically the same terri
tory. The race will finish in front of
I the Stanford rooting section after a
j final lap around the track.
Gold, silver, and bronze medals will
be awarded to the first three runners
to finish. The team making the highest
number of points will receive a team
i placque.
