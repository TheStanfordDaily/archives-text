# SIGMA DELTA CHI ELATED AT PRESS GROUP'S PROGRESS
## Spangler States Fraternity Attitude on Scholastic Journalists' Body 
### Ray Spangler 
President Sigma Delta Chi
Stanford Chapter, Sigma Delta Chi, ]
is proud to realize that two years ago
the High School Journalists conven
tion was founded under its auspices. j
Today the California Scholastic Press i
Association, the outgrowth of that
first meeting, numbers its membership i
at nearly seventy high schools, and its |
convention roll approaches three hun- j
dred.
The association is state-wide, and
this year is beginning to attain its
complete independence. However.
Stanford will always retain an active
interest in the association, through
the Journalism division and Sigma
Delta Chi, as a part of the organiza
tion rather than the leaders of it.
The work of the convention, briefly,
is to enable the high school journalists
to bring up their own problems for
solution, to give them new ideas for
their publications, and to instruct them
in the fundamental ethics of the writ
ing profession.
Whether or not the high school peo
ple consider the work of the associa
tion worth while may best be judged
by the increasing numbers attending
each year. It is this growth that gives
Sigma Delta Chi a firm basis for the
pride it assumes in having fostered the
association.
We wish that the delegates may re
turn to their various schools with some
definite contribution to the welfare of
their publications. We wish that they
may have the best possible time while
they are the guests of Stanford.
