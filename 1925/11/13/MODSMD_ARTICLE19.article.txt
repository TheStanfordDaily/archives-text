# STANFORD SOCCER TEAMS MEET BEARS IN ANNUAL GAMES
## 
### 
Twenty-two varsity and eighteen
freshman soccer players leave the cam
pus tomorrow morning for Berkeley
where the two teams will meet Cali
fornia in the first games of the an
nual series.
The varsity has shown a steady im
provement all season, and is expected
to put up a good battle with the Bears.
The recent addition of Uave Clark,
last year's regular fullback, has im
proved the defense considerably. The
light forward line makes up the chief
cog in a fast driving offense, with
Miron and Schoen on the wings as the
stars.
If the varsity wins but one game
of the series of three this year, the
Stanford-California soccer cup will be
permanently awarded to Stanford, as
the Cards have won the last two series
and secured a commanding lead in the
contest for the cup.
The freshman team is rather weak
this year, and is conceded only an out
side chance to defeat the California
yearlings. The frosh have been de
feated in every preliminary game, and
to date have not yet scored a goal.
The varsity lineup will include
Schoen, Quigley, Bailard, Strowger,
Miron, Cannon, Franklin, Bushnell,
Holmes, Clark, and Gray. The 1929
who will start the game are Van Nuys,
Bovet, Toberman, Gibbs, Fell, Moffit,
Russell, Gilbert, Gibson, Bishop, and
Birch.
