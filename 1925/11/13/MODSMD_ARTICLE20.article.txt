# BONFIRE FRAMEWORK NEARING COMPLETION
## 
### 
Construction of the bonfire for the
I?ig Game rally next Wednesday eve
ning is rapidly coming to an end under
the efforts of large crews of freshmen.
The entire supporting framework
and the whole of the lower half of the
structure are now completed. A con
siderable amount of work, however,
remains to be done on the superstruc
ture.
To secure solidarity, the bonfire has
been built on a base of railroad ties.
Every effort has been directed toward
making the pyre strong enough this
year so that it will not crumble after
the first few minutes of burning. The
freshmen plan to build to a height of
ninety feet and over, if conditions and
wood supply permit. The final work is
expected to be done by Tuesday night.
