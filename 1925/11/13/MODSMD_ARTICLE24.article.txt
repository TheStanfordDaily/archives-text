# Welcome, Delegates!
## 
### 
Three hundred high school journalists and faculty members are today
on the campus. They are members of the California Scholastic Press
Association, holding its third annual convention, and to them the Daily
Palo Alto extends sincere greetings on behalf of the entire University.
The Editor is sorry that he is not equipped with a hundred hands to
enable him personally to give the grip of a fellow-craftsman to each
delegate, but he is happy in knowing that there are hundreds of other
Stanford men and women eager to assure every visitor of Stanford s
hearty welcome.
Stanford is proud that it was here under the guidance of the Stanford
chapter of Sigma Delta Chi, national professional journalistic fraternity,
that the first convention was held, brom this gathering in only a little
more than two years a sturdy and thriving association has developed. We
have a sort of paternal pride in its lusty growth.
Make yourselves at home, members of the California Scholastic Press
Association; the campus is yours. We hope you will come again.
