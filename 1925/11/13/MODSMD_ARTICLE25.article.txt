# New Admission Plan
## 
### 
Under the newly-adopted plan for admission to the University, incoming
candidates for the fall quarter will be selected in May instead of August.
This move fills a need of long standing! It is not revolutionary but is
merely a development following the increased demand for admission.
Since its founding in 1891, Stanford University has grown and
prospered. With this growth has come the increased demand for admis
sion, and a subsequent enactment of stricter rules governing the acceptance
of new students. The old system worked well when almost all applicants
could be accepted, but of recent years it has become unwieldy.
The high school students never knew until the first part of August
whether they were to be accepted. If at that time they failed to gain
admision they had a hard time getting in elsewhere because it was so near
the registration date of other institutions. By the new plan, high school
authorities are relieved of the necessity of filling out the students creden
tials just when the rush of Commencement is on and the vacation rush is
just beginning.
Hitherto, credentials were accepted by the Registration committee until
August 3, and the list of accepted applicants was ready August 5. Now,
the month of May will be devoted by the committee to making selections.
This should facilitate complete investigations and the benefits should be
considerable.
