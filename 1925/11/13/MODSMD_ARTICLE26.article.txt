THE IRON HORSE
"The saddest words of tongue or pen
are these here three: 'It might have
been'." Somebody once said that, or
something like it. Anyway, it seems
appropriate to head this review, for
if a picture ever had possibilities as
a national epic "The Iron Horse" was
that picture. That it is, in reality, just
one of a number of so-so imitations of
"The Covered Wagon" is due to several
things. In the first place the director
did not seem to have a sense of values, I
and some of the most, trivial and un- j
important details crowd out the really
important things.
The trials and tribulations of the
transcontinental railroad builders is
the subject of the whole story, but the
big scene of the story, when the rail-1
road is built after superhuman efforts, 1
and the last spike is being driven in
by Senator Stanford, merely serves j
as an atmospheric background for the j
love story.
Abraham Lincoln is introduced in j
the early part of the picture but his !
only duty seems to be to look with j
benignant approval upon the budding j
love affair. The hero seems to have ]
built the railroad almost single-handed
and he was sure a dead-shot Indian
killer. We can't recall a single miss
on his part, and he shot often. The
heroine, too, was quite a girl. Single
handed, by the force of her personal !
magnetism and girlish sweetness she
persuades an army of starving, discon
tented. striking workmen to go back
to work. Without her the railroad
would never have been built, and we'd
still be using stage-coaches and the
pony express. Oh well, they do things
that way in the movies. No doubt when
the American Revolution is used for a
theme the hero will be seen swimming
across the Delaware with Washington
in tow and the final clinch will be
against a background of the signing of
the Constitution. â€”H. A. K.
