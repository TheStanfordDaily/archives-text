# CAMPUS OPINION
## 
### 
The Editor. Sir:
The letters from "29" in Wednes
day's issue of the Daily seems a nearer
approach to the truth of the matter
in regard to the so-called "Stanford
Spirit" than has been obtained so far.
As a parent living on the campus, I
suggest added reasons for the situa
tion in which we find ourselves. There
is small doubt that the freshman of
today enters with a better mental pre
paration than, say, of ten years ago.
He not only has greater freedom of
thought but he has a better fund and
scope of ideas.
Dr. Wilbur in the first Assembly of
the quarter expressed an opinion
which clearly bears on this issue—•
when he said that "Traditions are
something worked out by someone
else who may not have known as much
as is known today."
To a mature observer senior control
offers a more intelligent possibility
than does sophomore control. Why
should we slip back into less intelli
gent. methods once we have made defi
nite advance? What of the progress on
which we so pride ourselves? The prvd
die was too often injudiciously used
and "tubbing" for one not in robust
health a positive menace —and both
consumed valuable time which should
be better used.
Of course the freshman is in no
wise to blame for the present state of
affairs—so instead of the usual bawl
ing out spoken of in Tuesday's letter,
an appeal to real spirit and intelli
gence might be substituted.
Lack of attendance at assemblies is
to be greatly deplored for that way
lies help for swifter progress to a
denired goal.
It is clearly up to the powers that be
in regard to the increasing burden cf
expense and to the seniors for the re
creation of an evergrowing "Stanford
Spirit." —A Parent.
