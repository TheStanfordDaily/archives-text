S. A. ON NECKS
Necks are elongated parts of the
shoulders, stretching up and fastening
the head to the necessary part of the
body. They are characterized by being j
either swan, crane, or bull. Necks are .
sometimes all wet, but not often. The
swelled portion of the neck is called
the bead, and the hollow part is tne
throat.
The throat contains the Adam's ap
ple, when it can. This being impos
sible, it protrudes into the ne"k, and
leaves there a sharp bend. This is
very handy as you can keep a neat
hole in it to contain a collar button.
It also forms a mental hazard for the
barber who shaves you (if you've got
that kind of a neck).
♦ * *
Shoot the works for Johnny Cox:
He spends his spare time breaking
rocks
He pastes the shot and heaves the
spear
The discus is his five-cent beer;
And yet he can't get through his wood
That hitting cops is not so good!
So shoot the works for Johnny Cox,
Who spends his spare time breaking
rocks. —L. A. B.

Let us hereby bewail in unison the
torturous conditions which make bud
ding Bolshevists of our sweet fresh
men by forcing them to take cold
showers at Encina gym. According to
a lamentation vociferously voiced in a
recent "Student Opinion" the very
safety and integrity of the University
is seriously endangered by the possible
evil effects of cold showers upon the
mental well-being of our freshmen.

Freshmen may be able to withstand
the cold of the Frigid Five Hundred,
but it seems to use that it is forcing
matters a little too far to expect them
to bear up under the onslaughts of a
cold shower. —C. W.
