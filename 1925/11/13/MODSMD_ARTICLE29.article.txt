# DAY'S DOINGS
## 
### 
-Ted Elias, Jr.-

There was no decision given
In the Stanford-Cal debate;
Those who read the Mid-terra Exes
All agree that we don't rate.
Varsity will take a workout
'Gainst the boys of Southern Branch.
Ernie Nevers and Pop Warner
Travel to the Berkeley ranch.
Freshman fire is progressing,
And Sequoia's annual wake
Will be ready for the Rally,
Burning Berkeley's hopes at stake.
Press convention now has started,
Everyone arrived today;
Junior Journalists, we greet you;
Hope you have a pleasant stay.
Washington and California
Tangle on the Berkeley field.
Husky team will cop the Conference
If the Bruin line should yield.
