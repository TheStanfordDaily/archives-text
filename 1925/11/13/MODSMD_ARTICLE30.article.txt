## 
### 
Alpha Chi Sigma, chemistry frater-1
, nity, held a smoker in the lobby of
| the Old Union last night, introducing;
the new chemistry majors to the mem-;
bers of the fraternity.
Dr. Franklin, of the chemistry de-1
partment, gave demonstrations of how i
glassware is made, and how glass tub
ing is drawn out from a bulb of molten
glass, into a tube as fine as a hair.
Another interesting demonstration
by Dr. Franklin was the decorating
of glassware with colored glass, mak
ing a colorful ring from an ordinary j
piece of glass rod.
