# "GRANGE FOR CONGRESS" IS ILLINOIS SLOGAN
## 
### 
Chicago admirers of Red Grange, J
Illinois All-American halfback, last
night circulated petitions to put his
name on the ballot as a candidate for
the Republican nomination for con
gressman at the primary election next
April.
The famous Illinois football star has
been beseeched to enter the movies
and to play professional football, but
tins is the first time he has been
boosted for political office. The fact
that Red receives as many as 2500
notes and letters a day from his many
admirers shows that he has plenty of
friends and votes. He never fails to
answer a friend no matter how busy
he may be.
