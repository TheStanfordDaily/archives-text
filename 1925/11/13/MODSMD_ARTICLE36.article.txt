# ALLEN TO PRESENT SELECTIONS FROM BACH AND FRANCK
## 
### 
The two composers who have prob
ably contributed more to the literature
of the organ than any others will be
represented in the recital by Warren
I). Allen in the Memorial Church next
Sunday afternoon at 4 o'clock. John
Sebastian Bach's Chorale-Prelude, "We
All Believe in One God," will open the
program, and Cesar Franck's "Pas
torale in E Flat" will follow.
Bach and Franck stand out above
other composers of organ music, Bach
as pioneer and establisher of musical
forms, and Franck as a worthy de
veloper of Bach's principles and as
founder of the modern French school
of organ playing and composition.
The Chorale-Prelude, "We All Be
lieve in One God," is based upon the
theme of the Lutheran hymn of that
name. Bach composed many Choral-
Preludes and Postludes around these
famous hymns.
Cesar Franck has made a great im
pression on his musical contemporaries
by his compositions and his person
ality.
Another French composer, in a dif
ferent field, was Jules Massenet, whose
opera, "Thais," is the source of the
lovely "Meditation" which will be
played Sunday. This selection is played
frequently as a concert number be
cause of its attractive melody.
The recital will close with two num
bers by an American composer, Ros
setter G. Cole, a Chicagoan. His
"Heroic Piece" and "Hymnus" were
originally for organ and orchestra to
gether and have been arranged for
organ alone.
The recital Tuesday afternoon will
be devoted entirely to the works of
Richard Wagner. Among other Wag
nerian compositions will be selections
from "Lohengrin" and "Tannhauser."
