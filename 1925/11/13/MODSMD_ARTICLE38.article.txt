# "IRON HORSE" RELICS ARE DISPLAYED AT STANFORD MUSEUM
## 
### 
Because of the interest stimulated
i by the showing of the motion picture,
i "The Iron Horse," at a local theatre,
: Pedro J. Lemos, director of the Stan
ford Museum and Art Gallery, has
moved into the lobby of the museum
some of the relics actually used at
the ceremony of the completion of the
transcontinental railroad.
The gold spike, which was driven
in by Senator Stanford, uniting the
eastern and western branches of the
transcontinental railway, is on dis
play. The sledge used by Senator Stan
ford and the spade which turned the
last shovelful of dirt are also to be
seen. A photograph of Hill's painting
showing the celebration of the union of
the rails is placed with the objects and
shows Senator Stanford in the act of
driving the spike and the large group
of notables who assisted in the cere
mony.
The driving of the final spike was
the occasion of a nation-wide celebra
tion. The strokes of the hammer were
transmitted by telegraph to points
along the road as the last link in the
chain that finally united the East and
the West was forged.
The spike itself has an interesting
history. David Hewes, Mrs. Stanford's
brother-in-law, took a number of twen
ty-dollar goldpieces to the mint to be
melted up and cast. The first spike
was of nearly pure gold and was far
too soft. It was remelted and alloy
was added. The second casting was
still not hard enough. The spike was
melted four times and more alloy
added each time before one of suffi
cient strength to stand the blows of
the sledge was produced. Extra gold
was left as the result of the added
metal and was broken off from the
spike and made into trinkets. The
marks can still be seen on the spike.
