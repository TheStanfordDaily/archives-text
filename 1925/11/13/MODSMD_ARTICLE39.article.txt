# SKYSCRAPER BUILT
## 
### 
The 52-story skyscraper being erect
ed at the University of Pittsburg is
destined to become a beacon for avi
ators when it is finally completed.
The light to be installed at the top
of the tower will throw a beam visible
within a radius of 80 miles. The light
will be installed on a revolving struc
ture, so that it may be seen in any
direction.
