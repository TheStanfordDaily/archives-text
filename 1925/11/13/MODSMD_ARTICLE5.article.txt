# COACH BRANDSTEN HAS NEW DIVERS OF FIRST-CLASS ABILITY
## Fall, Smith, Mills, and Bean All Show Promise of Great Development 
### Herbert Klein 
That Ernst Brandsten will continue
his custom of turning out champion
ship divers is the present indication.
Brandsten has four men on the varsity
squad that he predicts will be of cham
pionship class by next spring and he
may be taken as an authority, with
the first three place-winners at the
Olympics, White, Fall, and Pinkston,
his products. The divers upon whom
he pins his faith for the coming year
are Dave Fall, who is already among
the first three or four in the country;
Ted Smith, with swimming as well as
diving victories to his credit; Walter
Mills, of last year's freshman squad;
and Myron Bean, who shows promise.
Although out of condition, Fall put
up an excellent showing against the
capable Guerton Carroll at the P. A. A.
meet of the Athens Club of Oakland
a week ago. He lost to Carroll by one
tenth of a point, the closest score yet
recorded in diving, after having the
victory awarded to him at first through
a miscount.
Ted Smith has taken up high plat
form diving and has become proficient
at it. Walter Mills has had a thorough
grounding in the elements of diving.
Bean shows the greatest possibilities
of any.
Stanford men will make a strong bid
for the national titles and Brandsten
feels confident that they will give ex
i cellent accounts of themselves. Under
his own system of instruction all the
| possibilities of a diver are developed
and these men seem to have plenty
of possibilities.
