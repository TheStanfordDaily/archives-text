# CALIFORNIA VARSITY WORKING OVERTIME UNDER ARC-LIGHTS

### 
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA,
Nov. 13. â€”Despite adverse weather
conditions Coach Andy Smith has had
his University of California varsity
working overtime each evening, under
the arc-lights of the Memorial stadium,
in preparation for its tilt with the
Washington University Huskies, that
will probably determine the Pacific
Coast Conference champion of 1925.
The game will start tomorrow at 2:30
o'clock in the California Memorial
stadium.
By virtue of their 13-0 defeat of the
strong Stanford football aggregation
last Saturday in Seattle, the Huskies
proved themselves to be one of the
strongest squads on the Pacific Coast,
and will enter the game on even terms
with the Bruins. Coach Bagshaw has
developed a heavy, powerful line and
a fast, hard-hitting backfield. This was
shown last week when Ernie Nevers,
reputed to be the hardest fullback to
stop on the Pacific Coast and possibly
ill the United States, was able to pene
trate the Husky line for only 36 yards
from scrimmage. Captain Tesreau at
fullback and George Wilson at half
back, showed that they are leading
candidates for All-Coast honors against
the Cards, while Louis Tesreau, a
brother of Captain Tesreau, and Pat
ton at halfback and Guttormsen, quar
ter, performed in a capable manner.
The Golden Bears will have to be in
tftp form to stop them.
Andy Smith has given the Bruins
several new plays that California may
be forced to use against Washington
and they will be well versed in them.
Although Coach Smith has been im
proving the offensive power of the
team he is not neglecting the defense
for they will have to be strong in this
end of the game if they wish to stop
the Huskies. The Bruin line is receiv
ing intensive practice under Line
Coach A1 Boles while Assistant Coach
Nibs Price is helping Andy Smith in
perfecting the plays of the backfield.
Jabs, Young, and Griffin, fullbacks,
are still hitting the line hard, and
are prepared to meet the acid test
against the Husky forward wall, while
Captain Tut Imlay and Dixon, half
hacks, are in fine shape, and the
veteran, Carlson, or Blewett are ready
to run the team.
