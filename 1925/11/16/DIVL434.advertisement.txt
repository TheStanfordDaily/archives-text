The Sound Basis
for Success
in the Bond Business
~~\ /fk NY college men are influenced to choose
YJ. the bond business for a career because they
count on a ready-made clientele among wealthy
friends. That is a weak basis upon which to
make so important a decision. Experience will
disillusion them.
A man must know his business to succeed in the
bond business, as in any other. Men of wealth
are good enough business men to demand
competent service in return for their invest
ment patronage. The man who is, first, qualified
for the bond business —then well trained and
well-informed, will find that his progress is
little dependent upon friendship.
College men who obtain employment with
Halsey, Stuart & Co. are immediately given prac
tical training in the fundamentals of the busi
ness before they are assigned to actual work.
Thus they begin with a good foundation which,
together with accumulation of experience, de
velops ability—the only sound basis for success.
We have prepared a paper which gives much informa
tion about the bond business, of pertinent interest
to those who might be considering it as a career.
We shall be glad to send you a copy upon request.
