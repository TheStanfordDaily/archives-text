# "BIG GAME GAIETIES" SEATS STILL SOUGHT
## 
### 
Mail orders are still pouring in for
| the football show, "Big Game Gaie
| ties," to be given Friday, November
I 20. Because the seat sale last Thurs
; day was the largest in campus history,
! there will be, as previously announced,
1 no roughs' seats available for the
1 show.
An effort is being made by the show
! directors, Gordon Davis, Chrysella
| Uunker, and John L. Wiggin, to pre
sent campus actors in parts best
suited to their talents. Owing to the
nature of the show most of those tak
ing part will appear in more than one
j role.
The "Gaieties" will be in two acts
and fifteen scenes. In addition to origi
nal Hkits, acts and parodies by cam
pus authors, the program will include
i acts taken from Andre Chariot's re
vue, one of the musical hits of last
season in New York, and from Elsie
Ijanis' popular "Puzzles of 1925."
