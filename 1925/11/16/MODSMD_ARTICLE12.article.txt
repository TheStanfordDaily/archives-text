# ALLEN WILL PLAY COMPOSITIONS OF RICHARD WAGNER
## 
### Herbert Klein 
Selections from the operas of Rich
ard Wagner will ruake up the entire
program of the organ recital to be
given by Warren D. Allen in the
Memorial Church at 4:15 o'clock to
morrow afternoon.
Wagner occupies a unique position
as a composer in that he rejected the
artificialities and inconsistencies that
prevailed in the conventional French
and Italian opera as he found. He de
veloped, instead, the "music drama"
in which singers, orchestra, and set
ting were all combined to give con
viction and dramatic power to the
action. His operatic music is of such
intrinsic worth that it forms a large
part of the repertoire of every sym
phony orchestra.
The opening number will be the
mystical prelude to "Parsifal," Wag
ner's last opera. This prelude was
heard in the Memorial Church last
year at the Founders' Day concert of
the San Francisco Symphony Orches
tra under Alfred Hertz. The prelude
was, with Wagner, the means of put
ting the audience in the mood of the
opera which was to immediately fol
low. "Parsifal," being a story of the
search for the Holy Grail, is essen
tially religious and mystical.
The prayer and chorus from "Lohen
grin," an earlier Wagnerian opera, will
follow. In "Lohengrin" Wagner de
veloped his characteristic theories
with completeness for the first time.
It was first produced in 1850 by Franz
Liszt. The knight Lohengrin was, in
the legend, also a guardian of the
Grail.
In his only humorous opera, "Die
Meistersinger," Wagner satirized his
critics and at the same time produced
one of the greatest musical master
pieces ever written. A vote recently
taken among a large group of musi
cians gave the palm to "Die Meister
singer" as the world's greatest musical
production. The Mastersingers were
the medieval tradesmen of a guild
who were intensely interested in song.
Before one could become a "Master
singer" he had to compose a song ac
ceptable to the members. The intro
duction to the third act will be played
on the program. It is built up from
the various contrasting themes in the
opera and has the vitality and strength
that characterizes the whole work.
Two selections from "Tannhauser"
will complete the program. The first
is the famous "Evening Star," an aria
from the third act, sung in the opera
by the baritone, and a favorite for
its impressive and moving melody.

ard Wagner will ruake up the entire
program of the organ recital to be
given by Warren D. Allen in the
Memorial Church at 4:15 o'clock to
morrow afternoon.
Wagner occupies a unique position
as a composer in that he rejected the
artificialities and inconsistencies that
prevailed in the conventional French
and Italian opera as he found. He de
veloped, instead, the "music drama"
in which singers, orchestra, and set
ting were all combined to give con
viction and dramatic power to the
action. His operatic music is of such
intrinsic worth that it forms a large
part of the repertoire of every sym
phony orchestra.
The opening number will be the
mystical prelude to "Parsifal," Wag
ner's last opera. This prelude was
heard in the Memorial Church last
year at the Founders' Day concert of
the San Francisco Symphony Orches
tra under Alfred Hertz. The prelude
was, with Wagner, the means of put
ting the audience in the mood of the
opera which was to immediately fol
low. "Parsifal," being a story of the
search for the Holy Grail, is essen
tially religious and mystical.
The prayer and chorus from "Lohen
grin," an earlier Wagnerian opera, will
follow. In "Lohengrin" Wagner de
veloped his characteristic theories
with completeness for the first time.
It was first produced in 1850 by Franz
Liszt. The knight Lohengrin was, in
the legend, also a guardian of the
Grail.
In his only humorous opera, "Die
Meistersinger," Wagner satirized his
critics and at the same time produced
one of the greatest musical master
pieces ever written. A vote recently
taken among a large group of musi
cians gave the palm to "Die Meister
singer" as the world's greatest musical
production. The Mastersingers were
the medieval tradesmen of a guild
who were intensely interested in song.
Before one could become a "Master
singer" he had to compose a song ac
ceptable to the members. The intro
duction to the third act will be played
on the program. It is built up from
the various contrasting themes in the
opera and has the vitality and strength
that characterizes the whole work.
Two selections from "Tannhauser"
will complete the program. The first
is the famous "Evening Star," an aria
from the third act, sung in the opera
by the baritone, and a favorite for
its impressive and moving melody.
