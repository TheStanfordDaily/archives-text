Closing with the annual business
meeting Saturday morning, the third
annual convention of the California
Scholastic Press Association concluded
its program for the 1925 meeting
which was held at Stanford Friday
and Saturday under the auspices of
the local chapter of Sigma Delta Chi,
journalistic fraternity. Delegates from
sixty high schools, including seveuty
six faculty advisors and 280 student
representatives, attended the conven

Glendale Union high school, repre
