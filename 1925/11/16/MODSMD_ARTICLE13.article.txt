# GLENDALE ELECTED HEAD OF PRESS ASSOCIATION
## Prizes Awarded at Session Saturday; Murphy to Go To Eastern Meet 
### 
Closing with the annual business
meeting Saturday morning, the third
annual convention of the California
Scholastic Press Association concluded
its program for the 1925 meeting
which was held at Stanford Friday
and Saturday under the auspices of
the local chapter of Sigma Delta Chi,
journalistic fraternity. Delegates from
sixty high schools, including seveuty
six faculty advisors and 280 student
representatives, attended the conven
tion.
Glendale Union high school, repre
sented by Walton Andrews and Glenn
Cunningham, was elected president of
the organization for next year. The
C. S. P. A. offices were this year con
ferred upon a school which will in
turn appoint a delegate to fill the
office in the association. This new
method of election was instituted in
order to obtain a continuity in election
of officers which was impossible under
the old system, as elected delegates
often were unable to attend the con
vention the following year. The Girls'
Union High School of San Francisco
was elected first vice-president, Hunt
ington Park high school, second vice
president, and Palo Alto high school,
treasurer.
The "Guard and Tackle," yearbook
of Stockton high school, was awarded
the cup presented by the Quad to the
best scholastic annual. The "Sequoya,"
of Sequoia high school, and the "Clan-
O-Log" of Piedmont were awarded cer
tificates.
