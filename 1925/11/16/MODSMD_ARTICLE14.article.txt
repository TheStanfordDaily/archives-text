Stanford golfers gained an unex

University of California, Southern
| Branch, team Saturday morning on the
! Burlingame course. Six-man teams
J competed in best ball foursome play
j over eighteen holes. One point was
j counted for each nine holes and two
on the match.
Unusual putting and approaching at
[ the deciding holes marked the play of

i paired with Eddie Meyberg, sank a
I twelve-foot putt to halve the match
j with Harold Thompson and Ted Buck
ley. Thompson, who reached the semi
| finals in the 1925 state amateur golf
championship, played spectacular golf
; Saturday, medalling the course in 73
in his first time around. All the
matches were carried to the eighteenth
| hole for decision.
1 Frank Ditzler and Bob Vermilya
halved their match with Franklin Knox
and Reg Botua when Ditzler sank a
j forty-foot putt on the eighteenth green.
In the third match Neal Miller and
j Horace Hindry defeated Everett Moore
| and Ames Tuthill, Stanford taking
; three points and the Branch one. Mil
j ler laid a fifty-foot approach dead to
i the pin at the eighteenth and sank his
! putt for a win. Dick Lang and Eddie
j Meyberg had the best ball of any pair,
a 70, two under par. After the tourna
ment the visiting players were enter
| tained at lunch by the Cards.
I The victory over the Branch is the
! second for the Redshirt golfers this
season, San Jose Country Club having
j been defeated two weeks ago.
