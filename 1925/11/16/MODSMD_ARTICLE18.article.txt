# SUBSTITUTES RUN WILD IN 82 TO 0 WIN OVER BRANCH
## SCORE EARLY AND LATE Patchett Crosses Goal Line Four Times; Other Backs Go Well 
### Wilbur Adams 
Stanford's second team enjoyed a
field day at the expense of University
of California, Southern Branch, in the
i stadium Saturday afternoon, when it
j whitewashed the Southern eleven, 82
j to 0. Only two of the Cards' first-string
players were used in the game against
i the Branch, and almost every substi
tute was given a workout during the
afternoon.
How U. C. S. B. could have beaten
j Occidental was the mystery of the day.
A good high school could have done
| as well as the Grizzlies did last week
end, for most prep teams can at least
tackle. The Branch made first downs
twice in the first quarter, but failed
| to do this trick again throughout the
afternoon. Cy Walton was responsible
j for both of these first downs, making
I two runs of over twenty yards each.
Cards Score Early
Stanford had the score 13 to 0 in her
I favor less than four minutes after the
| game had started. Stanford kicked off,
| and the Branch failed to gain in three
tries. Turney punted to the Cards' 30-
yard line, from which it took Hyland
and Hill just three plays to put over
the .first touchdown of the day. Hill
ran twenty-five yards, Hyland thirty
five, and Hill went the remaining dis
tance on the next play. The second
score was made in even less time.
Hyland kicked off over the goal. Again
Stanford held and Turney was called
upon to punt. Hyland received the kick
and ran thirty-five yards for the second
score of the contest.
Patchett, substitute for Captain
Ernie Nevers, scored one more touch
down than Hill in the race for high
point honors of the day. Patchett was
I credited with four scores. Bogue
J crossed the line twice in the fourth
quarter when he was put into the
game. Hyland, Moore, and Kirwan
were credited with one touchdown
each. Hyland converted six goals,
I Bogue three, and Solomon one, while
two tries were missed.
Reserves Strong
Saturday's game proved that the
Cardinals are blessed with substitutes
i
' that are almost as good as the regu-
I lars. In both the backfield and in the
| line Pop Warner has reserves that
| can strengthen the team in the latter
| part of the California game. Price
j played his first game at center this
i season, and his passes were accurate
! and caused no fumbles. Both Raffetto
j and Freeman worked well at tackles.
Hunt and S. Post, at guards, were in
i the interference for the backfield men
! and were responsible for many of the
j long gains made by the backs.
