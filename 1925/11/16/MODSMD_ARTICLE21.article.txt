# Housing the Convention
## 
### 
More than 300 delegates from high schools throughout the state were
visitors on the campus last week-end attending the third annual conven
tion of the California Scholastic Press Association. This body was or
ganized three years ago by the Stanford chapter of Sigma Delta Chi, and
since that time has been fostered and kept running by those campus jour
nalists.
However, the yearly two-day conference of the high school editors and
managers is made a reality only by the wholehearted support of the fra
ternities, sororities, and other living groups who donate housing accom
modations.
It was a great deal to ask any campus to house a gathering one-tenth
its own size, especially when many of the living groups were crowded with
their own week-end guests. But last Friday night every living group re
sponded to the call of the convention housing committee in such a way as
to merit sincere congratulations and thanks.
