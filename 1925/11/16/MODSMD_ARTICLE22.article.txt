# The
						New Orchestra
## 
### 
At last Stanford is to have a real permanent orchestra. In past years
when the occasion arose for such a group of musicians it was necessary to
hastily get together a group of paid musicians or to rely upon some of the
campus talent to volunteer its services. This new orchestra which will
have around fifty members will provide music for all dramatic productions
without cost.
Stanford has been behind eastern colleges in this respect for some time.
Yale, Harvard, Williams, Cornell, and others have had orchestras of merit
for some time. In spite of the fact that in the past the University has been
able to offer only small-opportunity for the exercise and development of
musical talent we are fortunate in having a number of talented musicians.
After a few months of practice Stanford's symphony orchestra will give a
campus concert to show its capabilities and the proceeds will be used to
purchase new orchestral scores.
