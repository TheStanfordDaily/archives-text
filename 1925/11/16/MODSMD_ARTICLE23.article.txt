# What Price College

### 
The following editorial, "What Price College?" from the Pcnn State
Collegian, is printed with but one admonition :
Read it not once—but twice and three times. When this has been done
we believe that twenty-five per cent of the campus population may worthily
think themselves an exception; seventy per cent will believe it only fodder
for fools—ignorant that they are looking into a mirror while reading it;
while we hope that five per cent will prove themselves wise men by di
gesting it.
"Expectancy bringing with it joy in the thought of the future. Then
realization, followed by disillusionment, disappointment and a little bit of
sorrow. And there you have the impressions of the average man before
and after entering college. A glorified Utopia is the university, thinks
the average American boy or girl. College—a word that is designed to
perform greater miracles than Aladdin's lamp without even the elTort of
rubbing.
"The word college has the same appeal as a circus sideshow —it awakens
our inquisitive instinct. Mention college and one thinks not of a melting
pot which is designed to awaken men and women to the true values of life,
but as an institution which has been invented to meet the social needs of an
unsocialistic age. Dr. J. B. Findlay, formerly of the University of Cali
fornia, senses something amiss. lie declaims, 'When I sit in a classroom
and look at a male student who hides his mental weakness and moral unfit
*. , t
ness behind a coat of powder and cosmetics I w r onder which way our civ
ilization is headed.'
"What price college? The average undergraduate pays more for an
education than he realizes. Ile pays in that he loses a little personality and
a little individuality—blasted is the illusionment of youth. The colleges
and universities of today must recognize the task that confronts them.
They must change this disillusionment into illusionment, illusionment that
brings Kick with it the joy with which the expectancy was heralded. And
if they fail to do thi-, if they fail to furnish their students with this appre
ciation of values, their walls should crumble away to give place to some
thing greater."
