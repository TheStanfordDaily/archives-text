FOOTBALL DOPE
Stanford beat U. C. S. B. last Satur
day, 82 to 0. This team beat Pomona
earlier in the season, 26 to (h California
beat Pomona 27 to 0. Therefore Cali
fornia is one point better than South
ern Branch. In other words the score
next Saturday should be Stanford 81,
California 0.

Cabbages would like to know which
event of last Saturday afternoon was
the cross-country race. Why track men
have taken to wearing football hel
mets?
* * *
We hear with interest that Cap'n
Toot Imlay of the University of Cali
fornya in an attempted criss-cross last
Saturday against the University of
Washington either lost or misplaced
his feet. We wonder if he will find
them by next Saturday.
* ♦ *
We are looking every day in the
classified sections for an advertisement
saying, "Lost —One pair of perfectly
good feet. Finder kindly return to
Talma Imlay, U. of C."

Cabbages wishes to announce that
there will be a football game next Sat
urday in the stadium between a team
representing Stanford University and
a picked team from the University of
California.

Cabbages wishes to make a few
helpful suggestions for whoever in
tends to walk off with the prize two
ton box of soothing syrup that will
be awarded to the winner of the Big
Game Score guessing contest.
Proceed as follows:
1. Count the number of letters in
the names of the men of each first
team.
2. Find the total letters for each
team and subtract these totals from
each other. You will then have the
margin by which the winning team
will win provided no substitutions are
made.
3. To allow for this, add up the num
ber of letters in the names of the sub
stitutes on each squad and divide this
number by the number of substitutes.
Subtract the one result from the other.
4. In this way you will obtain a num
ber which should be added to the score
of the losing team and subtracted from
the score of the winning team when a
substitution is made.
5. Go down to the stadium and count
the number of iron bolts in each goal
post. Take the south one as Californ
ia's.
6. Subtract one goal post from the
other and you will be able to find the
number of goals each team will kick.
7. From this number you can calcu
late the number of touchdowns that
would be made if all of them were
converted.
8. Compare this number with the
number obtained above. In this way
you can estimate the number of touch
downs that will not be converted and
from this deduce the number of touch
downs that will actually be made sup
posing that two-thirds of them are
converted. (If you get a fraction of a
touchdown don't lose any sleep over
it.)
9. To determine the number of field
goals that will be kicked by California
with Blewett performing, measure the
length of the field in yards and sub
tract 100.
