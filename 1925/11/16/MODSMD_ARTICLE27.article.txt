—Ted Elias, Jr.—

Press convention now is over,
Delegates have left for home,
Now no longer o'er the campus,
Will the future writers roam.
Warner's seconds roughly handled
Spaulding's team from Southern
Branch,
Raced and galloped 'round the grid like
Cowboys on a cattle ranch.
And Los Arcos won the races
That were held before the game,
Robert Swain, fleet-footed Soph'more,
Gained himself a lot of fame.
Wally Knox returns to Stanford,
From a conference in the North,
He received suggestions there
That the future will bring forth.
Big Game tickets will be given
To the eager, waiting throngs;
We'll be there to see the Cardinals
Right their ancient football wrongs.
—Ted Elias, Jr.—
