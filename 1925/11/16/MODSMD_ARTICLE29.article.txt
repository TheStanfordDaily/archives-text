The Stanford eleven triumphed over
the California team in the Big Game
Saturday with a 12 to 5 victory. To
add to the glory which the Cardinal
won is the fact that Stanford was op
posed by a splendidly coached and
conditioned eleven which went down
to honorable defeat before a superior
team. It was a double Stanford victory
for it was gained by a Stanford team
coached by Stanford graduates, who
demonstrated clearly that Western
methods can more than hold their own
against the best systems of the East.
* * *
Stanford had many clever bleacher
stunts at the game Saturday. A huge
red banner "Stanford" was placed di
rectly in front of the Stanford section.
Three flagpoles at the top of the sec
tion bore huge Stanford banners. Dur
ing the progress of the game a number
of white pigeons with red ribbons tied
to their feet were allowed to fly away.
When Thompson scored the first
touchdown, several hundred red bal
loons were loosened. Stanford again
made use of the white block "S" in
her Cardinal rooting section. The "S"
appeared through clouds of red con
fetti, at first rather indistinct, but
finally clear-cut and perfect. California
was without special features on the
part of its rooting section.

The regular fall election of the local
chapter of Phi Beta Kappa was held
today. Two graduates and five under
graduates were honored by the society.
