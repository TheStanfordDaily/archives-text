# EMMETT CORRIGAN VIEWS WITH ALARM THEATRE TENDENCIES
## "What Price Glory" Star Discusses Qualities of Great Actors 
### Anne Waldron 
"The theatre has retrogressed alarm
ingly during the last twenty-five years.
Neither the plays nor the actors are of
as fine calibre as they were a quarter
century back," said Eramett Corrigan,
of "What Price Glory!" renown, in an
interview recently. "What Price
Glory!" has just completed a success
ful six weeks' run in San Francisco and
will open Wednesday for a few days'
run in San Jose.
"The plays of today are not real art;
-real art appeals to the highest in man
and too many of the modern plays are
salacious and cater to the vulgar," con
tinued Corrigan. "The prestige and
fame of many prominent producers and
actors is built upon disguised appeals
to the lower tastes.
Histrionic Sense' Needed
"To be a great actor, one must have
a histrionic intelligence. No matter
how brilliant he may be in other fields,
if he lacks this faculty of telling how
a certain character would act and
think under certain circumstances and
cannot reproduce such thoughts and
emotions, dramatically, he can never
act.
"The theatre is a highly artificial
art. Nothing on the stage is done na
turally. The actions would lose all
force if they were done so. Were I
to commit murder on the street and
have the act put on the stage immedi
ately after, the incident would have
to be dramatized to be effective. The
actor must know how to parse his sen
tence for inflection and gesture of
mood as accurately as a grammarian
for grammar.
"One trouble with the modern stage
is that the best way of learning the
drama —that is, by playing under great
stars and studying with them —has
been wiped out of existence by the
commercialism of modern dramatic
production.
Decrys College Dramatics
"The critics of today know nothing
of the technique of the stage. Their
reviews are made solely 011 their own
personal opinions as to the merits of
the play and the abilities of the actor.
"I do not believe that college dra
matics are of any benefit to an indi
vidual seeking the professional stage.
The coaches show a lamentable lack
of real theatre technique and, because
of this and lack of time, generally
choose their actors just for type."
Corrigan went on to discuss the ef
fect of the "movies" upon the theatre
of today. Contrary to most actors of
the legitimate stage, he does not be
lieve they have hurt the stage. The
movies have killed stage melodrama.
Audiences simply laugh at it. But the
movies have increased the number of
theatregoers, especially among the
foreign-born population, who, having
become acquainted with the language,
like to hear the actors speak.
"I enjoy the part of Captain Flagg
very much, although compared to the
character work I have done before,
such as Napoleon. Robespierre, and
the great classics, it is child's play.
"This tour will mark the first time
in twenty-five years I have made one
night stands, and I look forward to it
with groat pleasure. I am having a fine
time in 'What Price Glory!'"
