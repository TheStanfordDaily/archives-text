# Sorority Women Will Sell Big Game Issue Of Chaparral on Quad
## 
### 
Three sororities will take a hand
in selling the Big Game Number of
Chaparral Friday morning on the
Quad. Alpha Omicron Pi, Delta
Gamma, and Kappa Kappa Gamma
will be represented by saleswomen
at the English corner, the women's
steps, and the Engineering corner.
Regular Chaparral salesmen will
also be on duty.
The Big Game Number will con
tain sixty pages instead of the usual
thirty, with twice as much humor
to every page, according to the "Old
Boy." Since permission has not
been granted to sell the magazine
at the Big Game this year, the novel
sorority selling scheme has been
inaugurated in an effort to dispose
of more copies on the campus. How
ever, copies will be on sale in Palo
Alto, the Bookstore, and the Union.
The system of women's salesman
ship of humorous publications is a
new one here, though it has been
used by colleges in other parts of
the country. This may become a
lasting custom at Stanford for it
has proved to be a success on other
campuses.
It is planned by the Chaparral
staff to have other sororities and
Roble hall women to assist in sell
ing future numbers.
