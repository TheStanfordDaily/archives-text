# SPORTS OF 1925
## 
### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Carl Mays, now of the Cincinnati Reds, once pitched three full world series
games without walking a man? This happened in the 1921 contests between
the Giants and the Yankees. The submarine twirler won one game and lost
two, and 97 batters faced him.
Harry Cooper, a golf pro. at Dallas, Texas, shot eighteen holes of golf in
sixty strokes? Cooper set this mark, which is an American record, on July 30,
1925, over the Tenison course. He took only twenty putts.
A. P. Burke, tennis professional at Deauville, France, can hold fourteen
tennis balls in one hand? He can serve seven in his mitt at once. Bill Tilden
often holds five when serving in a tournament.
One of the greatest football scores on record was set a year or so ago
when King College of Virginia beat Lenoir 206 to 0? The ball carriers of
King College were all in from running, or would have scored a few more
touchdowns.
