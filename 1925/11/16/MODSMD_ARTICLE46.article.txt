# COLLEGE TRAINED WOMEN VALUABLE IN WELFARE WORK
## 
### 
That college-trained women have
much to offer to those engaged in com
munity welfare work is the opinion of
Mrs. Eilizabeth G. Anderson, Berkeley
policewoman.
"College women have trained minds,"
she says, "and when they have had
more experience in living, they will be
the best agency obtainable in social
service work. They do things with ex
pertness and finished technique."
A number of women students at the
University of California are at the
present time assisting Mrs. Anderson
in volunteer relief work. The initiative
in this work has been taken by various
Horority houses on the campus. Enough
clothing to dress two destitute families
has been donated by one sorority.
Definite plans to continue this type
of work have been made by Pan-Hel
leuic, the sorority council. At the pres
ent time that organization is making
preparations to completely outfit a
•schoolgirl who is going to Portland,
Oregon.
"In doing this welfare work, the
college girl will learn much to assist
her in her chosen career," Mrs. An
derson says. "While the girls as a
rule do not handle the cases individu
ally, they are in the office and hear
bow the different cases are settled
and thus get an insight into how the
work is carried out."
Instances of the work of the college
women cited by the Berkeley police
woman, include an account of a com
plete file system which was created by
one senior woman. The work of the
welfare department, together with va
rious articles on social and relief ac
tivities published by national societies
are filed, and play a large part in
determining the policies of the Berke
ley department.
Seventy-four per cent of the fra
ternities at the University of Minne
sota have failed to maintain a "C"
average for the school year 1924-25.
