# SWAIN SETS CROSS COUNTRY RECORD IN INTRAMURAL RACE
## Los Arcos Wins Team Title; Beta Theta Pi, Delts Follow in Order 
### 
Beating the best time ever made on
the intramural cross-country course,
Robert Swain, running unattached,
came in first with a time of 20 min
utes, 51 1-5 seconds. The course is
three and a half miles long, and the
best previous time was above 21 min
utes. The Los Arcos team, composed
of Criley, Hunkins, and Beckwith, won
the first-place team placque.
Pressing Swain was another un
attached runner, Lewis Montferino,
who finished second. Ted Criley, of the
Los Arcos squad, placed third. The
first three men receive gold, silver,
and bronze medals, respectively. The
Beta Theta Pi team, with 37 points,
was close second to Los Arcos which
had 35 tallies. Briggs, Waterhouse, and
Wheeler made up the Beta squad.
Delta Tau Delta and El Campo fin
ished third and fourth, with 64 and
6G points. These were the only teams
who completed the race. Encina sec
ond floor finished the best two men,
but did not have another man to make
up a team, so was not in the final
counting. Breakers, who won the race
last year, finished also only two men.
Delta Upsilon started a full team, but
none of them were able to make the
full course.
Coach C. W. Davis says that the
turnout Was the largest since the
run has been held. Thirty-four men
started and twenty-six finished. The
freshmen had a number of good men
in the race, but due to not having com
plete teams were unable to
make places as groups. However, Gor
don French and Leon Carley, of En
cina second floor, and Bill Cuinm of
the first floor finished close to the top.
Montferino, who finished second,
might have lessened the time more
than Swain, but he got off the course
and ran quite a little further than ne
cessary. He was one of the best dis
tance men in the State Junior College
meet last spring.
