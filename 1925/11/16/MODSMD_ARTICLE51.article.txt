### 
A heart attack proved fatal to Harry
L. Harris, a football fan, Wednesday,
when he died as a result of excitement
at the U. S. C.-Stanford game in Los
Angeles, three weeks ago. Harris, one
of California's most prominent mer
chants and vice-president of the
wealthy Harris & Frank Company,
was removed to a hospital immediately
after the game, and died at a nearby
sanatorium where he was taken before
his condition became critical.
