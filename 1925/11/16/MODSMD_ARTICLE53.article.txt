# U. S. C. Schedules Courses In "Methods of Charming"
## 
### 
Giving educational sanction to the
dictum that "a woman's chief duty is
to charm," a course in charm develop
ment has just been established at the
University of Southern California. For
the benefit of the women of the uni
versity a series of weekly lectures has
been established in which authorities
on the different phases of charm will
speak. Among the subjects are "The
Charm of Conversation," "The Charm
of Personality," and others in the
same category.
Peggy Hamilton, designer, will talk
on the subject of "The Charm of
Clothes." Dr. R. B. vonKleinsmid,
president of the university, will be
one of the lecturers. No university
credit is given for the course.
