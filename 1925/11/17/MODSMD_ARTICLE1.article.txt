# BOB LEWIS WARNS STUDENTS NOT TO RAID U.C.
## DON'T BREAK AGREEMENT U. C. Campus Invasion Would Cause Cancellation of California Game 
### BOB LEWIS 
(Editor's Note —Bob Lewis, in the
story below, has warned students
against hasty action caused by un
warranted excitement over the de
struction of the Stanford bonfire. Un
doubtedly California had nothing to do
with the burning, and students must
be warned against invading the Cali
fornia campus, for if any such action
is taken, there will be no Big Game
this year.)

President A. S. S. U.
There have been rumors to the ef
fect that some over-enthusiastic and
•entirely unwise students might attempt
-a raid of some sort on the Berkeley
campus before the Big Game.
We are out to beat California this
Saturday, and it would be considerable
of a disappointment were we to be
deprived of our victory by having the
game called off. That is exactly what
is going io happen if any attempt is
made to invade the Berkeley campus.
All Stanford students are urged to
warn any misguided fellow-students of
the consequences that would follow
any act violating the agreement be
tween the two universities. The idea
that no one would dare call off the Big
Game at this late hour is so fallacious
as to be ridiculous. Remember the U.
.S. C. game last year. We don't want
to take any chances of being cheated
out of our serpentine Saturday. It's up
to all of us to see that we aren't.
