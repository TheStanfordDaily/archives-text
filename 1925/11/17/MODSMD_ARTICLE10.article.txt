# PYRE IGNITED AS FRESHMEN LEAVE PILE UNGUARDED
## Incendiaries Thought to Have Poured Oil Over Pile Before Lighting 
### 
Flames, breaking out ten minutes
after the freshmen had left the 1929
bonfire unguarded at 6:15 this morn
ing, completely consumed the 60<-foot
structure which was to have consumed
California's coffin at the Big Game
rally tomorrow night. The fire depart
ment arrived on the scene at 6:30, but
decided efforts to quench the flames
would prove fruitless. The structure
was still smouldering at a late hour
this afternoon.
According to Don Flickinger, chair
man of the freshman bonfire commit
tee, the freshman guard of twenty-five
men left the pile to get breakfast, after
they had been informed by upperclass
ruen that no guard was necessary dur
ing the daylight. Ten minutes later
flames were seen shooting from the
top of the pile by men at Encina. The
alarm was immediately turned in at
the power house, but oil had been
spread on the pile by the incendiaries
which caused the flames to catch so
fast that extinguishment was impos
sible.
At 7 o'clock more than a hundred
students were at the scene of the fire
and Burt Lapp staged an impromptu
rally. Bob Lewis made an appeal to
all undergraduates to help the fresh
men erect a new fire.
No clue as to the identity of the per- I
sons who set the fire has been found. j
A large closed car was seen speeding 1
away from the scene a short time be-j
fore the flames were observed. Resi- j
dents nearby informed the bonfire j
chairman that a car answering the de
scription of the speeding vehicle had
been parked in the arboretum near the
fire all night. Two strangers lingered !
around the fire for a short time late |
in the evening, but loft before daylight. j
Their identity is unknown.
