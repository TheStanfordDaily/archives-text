"Come Join the Band, Give a Cheer
for Stanford Red" with their bonfires
shooting tongues of flame into the
grey dawn, a hundred Stanford men
put as much spirit into a rally as has
been seen around here for some time.
What mattered it that someone had
touched off their pile at dtwn instead
of at dusk? Not a bit. Who cared be
cause classes would have to be cut, and
a bigger, better fire constructed in a
tenth of the necessary time? No one
cared, if looks and words mean any
thing. For the strains of the old fight
song had hardly died away, when Bob
Fraser jumped down from the seat of
his steaming Ford, and a gang of fresh
men with blankets over their heads
started salvaging the barrels of highly
inflammable oil that were perilously
near the blaze. Another bunch of about
thirty had gotten an old wagon, and
were on their way to lay the founda
tion for the new bonfire, not fifty feet
from the old one.
As the crowd gathered, rumors were
tossed about with reckless abandon.
"California," "High School Kids," "Ac
cident" were some of the words that
were whispered and shouted from ear
to ear. Many who were clad only in
bathrobes and slippers hurriedly left
to dress and return. Some were fully
dressed but with hair unkempt. Others
were neatly combed, but only half clad.
All were unanimous in the decision
that, work on the new structure must
begin at once.
It did, and has been progressing at
a furious rate all morning, and after
noon.
