# "CALIFORNIA IS NOT RESPONSIBLE" SAYS PRESIDENT WILBUR
## Stanford Is Taking Affair Far Too Seriously, Warns Executive 
### 
"Everybody is taking the burning of
the bonfire entirely too seriously," said
President Wilbur in an interview this
j morning.
President Wilbur does not believe
; that University of California students
' were in any way responsible for the
premature blaze. Both Stanford and
| California by the agreement of 1919
I agreed not to invade either campus at
j any time.
"There is no reason to suppose that J
| California has not lived up to the com-!
j pact," he declared. That the fire was i
! set by high school students was the J
opinion expressed by President Wilbur.
"The fire can be rebuilt easily by to- j
| morrow. Several years ago the fire was j
burnt before the rally, and another was i
completed in four hours," he said. "The I
! results of the second pyre for this sea-!
| son will show that concentration of the
freshmen's efforts would make it pos
sible to finish the fire in half the time
already spent this year.
"Although the fire has been burnt too
soon, the rally will come off as usual,
and I know the student body will co-oper
' ate in having a bigger bonfire than ever
i to light tomorrow night."
