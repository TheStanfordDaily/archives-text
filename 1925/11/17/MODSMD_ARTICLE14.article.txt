# DROWSY FRESHMEN REFUSE TO ACCEPT FIRST FIRE REPORT

"Soldier rest, thy warfare over,
Sleep the sleep that knows not
breaking."
Encina, wrapped in the gray mists
of early dawn, was busily sleeping the
sleep that knows not breaking. The
usually noisy structure was lost in
silence and pleasant dreams. Perhaps
the pleasant dreams were about bon
fires, but more likely they were about
nothing at all. The dreams are not the
point of this story, but rather the fact
that the dreams were rudely disturbed.
Encina. still half asleep, could not
believe its ears, and told those who
were madly screaming "Fire," that,
(hey were a little wet and should at
least go to the devil and not disturb
the place.
If the freshmen could not believe
their ears they had only to open the
window and look forth. There in the
distance was the result of all their
efforts, labors, and hopes, rapidly burn
ing before a heedless and deserted
landscape. For just a minute there was
a stunned silence, and then a chaos
of shouts.
What was said in those few minutes
embraced about all of tho words not
in the dictionary, and combinations of
numerous words that, are listed by
Webster. Everybody and everything
came in for special mention and colle
giate comment.
