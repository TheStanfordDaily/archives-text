# Revenge and the Big Game
## 
### 
Stanford Spirit lives. Let all the would-be mourners cease hanging
crepe and get to work on the new tonfire. The student body is united on
one definite purpose: The Big Game Rally must proceed as scheduled .
To that end, we saw the freshmfen turn out in a body. We saw the
foundations and the skeleton work of the new pyre in place while the first
bonfire was still a mass of flame. The situation arose, and Stanford Spirit
was found fully adequate.
Vague and ominous mutterings persist about retaliation. Before any
wild-eyed underclassman gets excited and goes up to the Berkeley campus,
dead set on playing Samson with the California buildings, it would be well
to call before the Student Body the following considerations:
First: That all evidence points to the fact that it was not a Berkeley
raiding party that started the lire. The presidents of the two universities
are pledged to an immediate cessation of athletic relations if any such raid
is made. The whole affair has the atmosphere of high school activity.
Second : That if some irresponsible dumbbell from Berkeley did set the
fire this morning, we don't want any equally irresponsible dumbbell from
Stanford complicating matters with another raid. It comes down to this:
the Big Game means more to the Stanford student body than any bonfire
ever built, especially this year, when we're going to send the Golden Bear
back to Berkeley a badly beaten animal.
Third: That if there is a fire ready to light tomorrow night, Stanford
will not have been "boobed." The cremation of the Bear will be pursued
with renewed vengeance, and the spirit for the Big Game will be at its
highest peak. The fire this morning is not without its good results.
