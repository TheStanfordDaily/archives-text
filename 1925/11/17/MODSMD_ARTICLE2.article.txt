# NEVERS DONS SUIT AS VARSITY GETS READY FOR BEARS
## 
### Wilbur Adams 
Practicc yesterday afternoon brought
out all of Stanford's injured men with
the exception of Ward Poulson, who is
certain to be out of the Big Game.
Captain Ernie Nevers and Hal Mc-
Creery, who spent parts of last week in
the hospital, were in the first team line
up and showed no bad effects from the
rest. Armour was in his regular posi
tion of right guard, but Harris was
trailing behind the team with a slight
limp as the result of the operation that
lie underwent last Thursday night.
With the California game only four

picked Los Gatos as its resting place.

Huskies put the Bears and the Red
shirts on an even footing. The com

Bears with a little edge, but compara

and only in small doses. California
beat Santa Clara 28 to 0; Stanford de
feated the Broncos 20 to 3. U. C. Con
quered Oregon on the field at Eugene
with another score of 28 to 0; the Cards
beat Oregon the following week in the
Stanford stadium 35 to 10. Then Wash
ington scored twice on Warner's outfit,
and only once on Smith's team. But
the Olympic Club won from the Bears
with a total of 15 points to spare, while
the winged O men only piled up 9 tallies
against Stanford.
