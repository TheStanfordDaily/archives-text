# NEVERS DONS SUIT AS VARSITY GETS READY FOR BEARS
## 
### Wilbur Adams 
Practicc yesterday afternoon brought
out all of Stanford's injured men with
the exception of Ward Poulson, who is
certain to be out of the Big Game.
Captain Ernie Nevers and Hal Mc-
Creery, who spent parts of last week in
the hospital, were in the first team line
up and showed no bad effects from the
rest. Armour was in his regular posi
tion of right guard, but Harris was
trailing behind the team with a slight
limp as the result of the operation that
lie underwent last Thursday night.
With the California game only four
•days away, Warner is drilling his men
on offensive work. Tomorrow will be
the last day of work for the team, and
the squad will go into seclusion at the
close of the Big Game rally. The end
of the week will be spent in complete
rest in some quiet resort away from the
campus. The team will return to Palo
Alto just in time for the game on Sat
urday. California is also going in hid
ing in this neck of the woods, having
picked Los Gatos as its resting place.
California's defeat at the hands of the
Huskies put the Bears and the Red
shirts on an even footing. The com
parative scores of the season show the
Bears with a little edge, but compara
tive scores should be taken carefully
and only in small doses. California
beat Santa Clara 28 to 0; Stanford de
feated the Broncos 20 to 3. U. C. Con
quered Oregon on the field at Eugene
with another score of 28 to 0; the Cards
beat Oregon the following week in the
Stanford stadium 35 to 10. Then Wash
ington scored twice on Warner's outfit,
and only once on Smith's team. But
the Olympic Club won from the Bears
with a total of 15 points to spare, while
the winged O men only piled up 9 tallies
against Stanford.
Coach Bagshaw of Washington was
quoted as saying after the game at
Berkeley that he thought Stanford had
a stronger team than California. This
opinion was not shared by Wilson or
other stars on the Huskies' squad, but
the Olympic Club men that played
against both teams this year, pick the
Cards for an easy winner this week
end. Those that have seen Big Games
between the Blue and Gold ,and the
Red know that there will be no easy
game for cither team Saturday.
The first team that was running sig
nals last night consisted of Shipkey and
Walker, ends; Freeman and Raffcto,
tackles; Armour and Swan, guards;
McCreery, center; Murphy and Bogue,
halfbacks; Mitchell, quarterback; and
Ncvers, fullback. This team, with the
exception of Harris who will probably
be at RafTeto's tackle, will start the Big
Game Saturday.

ington scored twice on Warner's outfit,
and only once on Smith's team. But
the Olympic Club won from the Bears
with a total of 15 points to spare, while
the winged O men only piled up 9 tallies
against Stanford.
Coach Bagshaw of Washington was
quoted as saying after the game at
Berkeley that he thought Stanford had
a stronger team than California. This
opinion was not shared by Wilson or
other stars on the Huskies' squad, but
the Olympic Club men that played
against both teams this year, pick the
Cards for an easy winner this week
end. Those that have seen Big Games
between the Blue and Gold ,and the
Red know that there will be no easy
game for cither team Saturday.
The first team that was running sig
nals last night consisted of Shipkey and
Walker, ends; Freeman and Raffcto,
tackles; Armour and Swan, guards;
McCreery, center; Murphy and Bogue,
halfbacks; Mitchell, quarterback; and
Ncvers, fullback. This team, with the
exception of Harris who will probably
be at RafTeto's tackle, will start the Big
Game Saturday.
Practicc yesterday afternoon brought
out all of Stanford's injured men with
the exception of Ward Poulson, who is
certain to be out of the Big Game.
Captain Ernie Nevers and Hal Mc-
Creery, who spent parts of last week in
the hospital, were in the first team line
up and showed no bad effects from the
rest. Armour was in his regular posi
tion of right guard, but Harris was
trailing behind the team with a slight
limp as the result of the operation that
lie underwent last Thursday night.
With the California game only four
•days away, Warner is drilling his men
on offensive work. Tomorrow will be
the last day of work for the team, and
the squad will go into seclusion at the
close of the Big Game rally. The end
of the week will be spent in complete
rest in some quiet resort away from the
campus. The team will return to Palo
Alto just in time for the game on Sat
urday. California is also going in hid
ing in this neck of the woods, having
picked Los Gatos as its resting place.
California's defeat at the hands of the
Huskies put the Bears and the Red
shirts on an even footing. The com
parative scores of the season show the
Bears with a little edge, but compara
tive scores should be taken carefully
and only in small doses. California
beat Santa Clara 28 to 0; Stanford de
feated the Broncos 20 to 3. U. C. Con
quered Oregon on the field at Eugene
with another score of 28 to 0; the Cards
beat Oregon the following week in the
Stanford stadium 35 to 10. Then Wash
ington scored twice on Warner's outfit,
and only once on Smith's team. But
the Olympic Club won from the Bears
with a total of 15 points to spare, while
