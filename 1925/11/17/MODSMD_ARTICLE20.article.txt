# Sophomore Discipline
## 
### 
Guarding - the bonfire was merely another of the fast-disappearing tra
ditions of Stanford. No frosh thought it likely that anyone would be so
bad and I>old as to set lire to it while the guards had gone back to Encina
for their morning cup of coffee. No sophomores were around to see to it
that the bonfire was not left unguarded for a single moment. Result: a
mass of burnt timber.
In a way, this was one of the best things that could have happened, for
it would seem to prove that some sort of regulated discipline is necessary,
or our traditions will go by the board. It takes something like this to hap
pen to make the students realize this fact and if we want to preserve any
of our traditions, then we will have to solve this problem of what to do with
the frosh. It's not fair for the students to place the blame for this bonfire
ui)on the freshman class alone. What happened is the natural result of
the system, and was to be expected sooner or later. We are all to blame,
for we are responsible for the system. It isn't going to help matters to
rant at the frosh. The only thing that can help the situation is a concerted,
careful attempt to solve the problem of how to discipline the freshman
class, or, to put it another way, how to enforce Stanford traditions.
We hope the leaders of the upper classes will take this problem as ser
iously as the problem warrants. We think that if they do, some solution
may be promulgated. It would be a good idea to get upperclass opinion on
it, to get freshman opinion on it, and find out what the students want. We
would like to see a definite plan put forward which might be discussed pro
and con, with the hope that something definite might lie decided upon.
We need some kind of sophomore discipline. How can we have it?
What plan can we adopt? It's past time for mere words; some action
would be desirable.
