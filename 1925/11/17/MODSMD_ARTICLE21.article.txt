# Soccer Supremacy

### 
Stanford's soccer varsity has again triumphed over the University of
California, and by so doing has won the permanent possession of the
trophy offered by Silvius Pellas, '13, a former Cardinal soccer captain. The
cup was offered for the team winning the majority of ten games between
the two universities. To date Stanford has won six, tied one, and lost two.
Credit for the victory must be divided. Undoubtedly the greater part
should fall to Harry Maloney, who laid the foundations for all Stanford
soccer teams. Maloney is on a leave of absence this year, but nevertheless
his good planning and fundamental instructions have borne fruit without
his immediate presence. He has worked quietly and built well.
And then we must consider the work of the men themselves this year.
They have gone ahead and done their lx:st without a coach. They have
forsaken varsity football games at tense moments to take their places on
the soccer field where there has been few spectators and but little glory.
Men who are willing to sacrifice personal pleasure to strenuous efforts
for the success of a minor sports team are instilled with the proper spirit.
They are the type Stanford needs.
We wonder if students do not catch their colds from doing so much outside
reading.
"Student jumps into river," says headline. Must have been a woman at
the bottom of it.
