WATER AND FOOTBALL
By Carrier Sink, Chief Transporter
of Water for the University of Cali
fornia coaching staff during the past
eight years.
I find that carrying buckets In the
usual way is quite impractical for the
needs of my absorbing profession. He
cause of this dire necessity we have
evolved here at California under the
present coaching system a well-organ
ized and highly efficient means of fur
nishing water at football games.
We find that on the average, during
a football game, the team consumes
about two buckets of water while the
coaching staff consumes nearly forty.
Of course it is quite impossible for
one person to carry forty buckets of
water in the brief space of an hour
and a half; so this difficulty is avoided
by running a pipe under the turf of
the field to a faucet where the water
is consumed.
But even then, the demand for water
at times becomes so excessive that the
pipe can not furnish a sufficient quan
tity. To meet this emergency we have
an auxiliary tank concealed In the
framework of the stadium which can
furnish a large flow of water for a
short time. This tank ran dry during
the Washington game.
There are several conditions under
which the demand for water becomes
greatest. One of these is the position
of the team on the field. The rate at
which water is consumer when the op
posing team has possession of the ball
at midfield is about one bucket every
fifteen minutes; on the twenty-five
yard line, it is one bucket every five
minutes; on the ten-yard line, one
bucket a minute; on the five-yard line,
two buckets a minute; and on the one
yard line, one bucket every fifteen sec
onds.
Elaborate preparations are being
made for water facilities at the game
with Stanford on November 21. The
Palo Alto water company will hire a
double force of workmen on that day,
and all pumps will be kept going at
full blast.
In case the city water supply should
become exhausted a small stream has
been diverted from its course and
made to run near the stadium.
A force of fifty men has been hired
to carry buckets. Two motor trucks
carrying huge tanks, and four horse
drawn water wagons will also be on
hand. These provisions will, we be
lieve, nearly meet the demands of the
coaching staff.
