# DAY'S DOINGS

### Ted Elias, Jr 
Things are happening all around us,
Fires burn while Freshmen sleep,
v 29" you've pulled a boner,
As you've sown, you'll have to reap.
Stanford students, know your duty!
Show the world your grit and fight!
Know that deep disgrace is ours,
If there is 110 pile to light.
Let us see if our traditions
Have the power once they had;
Build that fire by tomorrow!
GET TOGETHER UNDERGRAD!!!!!
"Big Game Gaieties" are ready,
For the eager, waiting crowd;
Keep your seats and please remember,
Naughty things are not allowed.
Now to call to your attention,
Latest subject for debate,
"Family is unnecessary
To an ideal social state."
List of candidates is publish":
Graduation time is near,
As for us, we know the month, but
Heaven only knows the year.
Snakes again have been discovered,
In our own Sequoia Hall,
Just a word of admonition,
Snakes caused Eve's and Adam's fall,
(hissss)
