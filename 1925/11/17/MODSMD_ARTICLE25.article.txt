The Editor, Sir:
Why should Stanford try to be dif
ferent from other universities in all
respects? It is all right to excel in
scholarship, but to do this —is it neces
sary to lose our school spirit? We
should be able to strike some mid
point between studies and recreation
which would leave room for school
spirit.
A letter from "A Parent" says, "The
freshman of today enters with a better
mental preparation than, say, of ten
years ago." Later it goes on to say,
"The paddle was often used injudi
ciously." If the freshman of today has
a better mental preparation than of
ten years ago he should be able to
use the paddle more judiciously when
he becomes a sophomore.
Last Friday's "Daily" states, "Sopho
more discipline of first-year men was
re-established this year at Harvard
University by a large majority vote of
the freshman class." Why not settle
this everlasting dispute by a vote of
the class of '29?
Injudiciously, " '29."

The Editor, Sir:
November 11, Wednesday, was Arm
istice Day. I state it for the benefit of
the majority of students, as they did
not seem to know that here ever was
an Armisice Day, or a chapel.
It seems to me, without trying to be
nosey, that the only decent thing to
do (especially when we were allowed
time off from classes to do it) was to
attend the short services in honor of
our American dead. And Ted Elias
crowns it all with the statement, "it
was like it should have been," prob
ably showing that he wasn't there him
self. —Respectful '29.

The Editor, Sir:
I wish to congratulate your Cabbage !
editor for coming clean on this shower- j
bath question which, I think, should
take precedence over any matter of
college spirit in an institution of Stan- [
ford's size, when it comes to student j
tendencies. Dr. Wilbur has said that j
the appointment office thinks that per- 1
sonal hygiene is something quite pri
mary in this life. At least I think it i
may be said that an atmosphere is as I
much of a problem as ardent spirits,
but that isn't what I am writing about.
The point is this: Since last dis
cussing the cold shower problem at
Encina gymnasium, I have been in
formed by a friend at Roble that there>
is also a very burning shower situa-j
tion in our women's dormitory. Al
though at Encina there are some dink-!
less frosh men unable to draw any.
hot water from the shower pipes, at i
Roble, on the other hand, are some |
hapless frosh women unable to secure
any cold. The problem, therefore, is i
this: Our men are in cold water when
they prefer hot, and our women are in
hot water when they prefer cold; but I
no water (to go on in strictly logical
fashion) is neither hot nor cold.
Mr. Editor, I leave the matter en
tirely with you. I suggest that in solv
ing the difficulty you and your Cabbage
editor (who, r believe, isn't averse to
occasional seriousness — especially
when he is trying to think of a good ;
joke) hold a tete-a-tete and see if some
thins harmonious won't emerge from
the situation. —S. O. C.

Mr. Editor, I leave the matter en
tirely with you. I suggest that in solv
ing the difficulty you and your Cabbage
editor (who, r believe, isn't averse to
occasional seriousness — especially
when he is trying to think of a good ;
joke) hold a tete-a-tete and see if some
thins harmonious won't emerge from
the situation. —S. O. C.

The Editor, Sir:
Why should Stanford try to be dif
ferent from other universities in all
respects? It is all right to excel in
scholarship, but to do this —is it neces
sary to lose our school spirit? We
should be able to strike some mid
point between studies and recreation
which would leave room for school
spirit.
A letter from "A Parent" says, "The
freshman of today enters with a better
mental preparation than, say, of ten
years ago." Later it goes on to say,
"The paddle was often used injudi
ciously." If the freshman of today has
a better mental preparation than of
ten years ago he should be able to
use the paddle more judiciously when
he becomes a sophomore.
Last Friday's "Daily" states, "Sopho
more discipline of first-year men was
re-established this year at Harvard
University by a large majority vote of
the freshman class." Why not settle
this everlasting dispute by a vote of
the class of '29?
Injudiciously, " '29."

November 11, Wednesday, was Arm
istice Day. I state it for the benefit of
the majority of students, as they did
not seem to know that here ever was
an Armisice Day, or a chapel.
It seems to me, without trying to be
nosey, that the only decent thing to
do (especially when we were allowed
time off from classes to do it) was to
attend the short services in honor of
our American dead. And Ted Elias
crowns it all with the statement, "it
was like it should have been," prob
ably showing that he wasn't there him
self. —Respectful '29.
