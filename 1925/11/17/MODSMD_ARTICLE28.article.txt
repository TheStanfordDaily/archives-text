## 
### H. M. B 
Stanford and the University of Cali
fornia entered into an agreement in
December 1919 by which is was under
stood that the student bodies of the
two universities would refrain from
any invasion of the campus of the
other at any time. According to the
covenants made at that time, such vio
lation of either campus would lead to
tfie immediate cessation of intercolle
giate relations.
Under such a state of affairs Univer
sity officials of both universities are
inclined to believe that the destruc
tion of the Stanford fire this morning
came entirely from forces not con
nected in any way whatsoever with
either Stanford or the University of
California. The student body leaders
and the officials of the two institutions
realize the force of the agreement and
under no conditions would allow any
infraction of it which would jeopardize
the continuance of athletic relations
between the two schools.
The resolution passed on October 7,
1919, by authorities of the two schools
as reprinted in the Stanford handbook,
follows:
"In view of the existing under
standing between Stanford Univer
sity and the University of Califor
nia that the invasion of one cam
pus by students of the other shall
be sufficient cause for the cancel
lation of athletic relations between
the two universities, be it
"Resolved: That students of
Stanford University shall not in
vade the campus of the University
of California, and that any viola
tion of this resolution, being
against the best interests fo Stan
for University, shall merit expul
sion from the University."
Any acts of vandalism or defacement
of property of the University of Cali
fornia shall be the cause for expulsion
for the quarter in which the act oc
curred, or such other discipline as the
Men's Council for Student Control
shall decide, says a ruling laid down
at Stanford on November 26, 1918.
