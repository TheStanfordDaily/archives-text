"France, for a democratic republic,
has an exceedingly undemocratic edu- 1
cational system," said Albert Leon j
Guerard, professor of General Litera- j
ture, in a lecture on "Social Problems |
of French Education" at a meeting of:
the Education Club last night. "A dual
system prevails, in which the laboring
classes are excluded from university
training. The free primary schools, in
cluding grade, high, and normal in
struction. are for the working people,
but students of these schools can sel
dom enter the other branch of educa
tional work.
"Separate from the primary are the ]
pay secondary schools, open to the
bourgeoise, which continue through
junior college, when the student re
ceives his A.8.," continued Professor
Guerard. "All universities are for
graduate work along professional
lines, and are entered only by gradu
ates from the secondary institutions.
A very few scholarships are granted
to scholars from the lower schools."
