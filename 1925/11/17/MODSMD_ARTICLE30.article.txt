# INFORMATION ABOUT BIG GAME TRAFFIC GIVEN BY C. S. A. A.
## 
### 
Final plans for handling the Big
Game traffic near and at Stanford next
Saturday have been made by the Cali
fornia State Automobile Association.
Maps and road directions are being
published in sport and automobile sec
tions of the large newspapers of the
state, while a folder directing seating
arrangements is being distributed with
the Big Game tickets. Special yellow
diamond road signs will be erected
along highways to the campus, while a
corps of traffic officers will direct
traffic.
The Automobile Association has di
rected the public to select routes for
travel previous to departure for Stan
ford, to follow the special yellow dia
mond road signs, and to obey traffic of
ficers which will be stationed at import
ant points along the roads.
Three routes are open to football
fans motoring from San Francisco and
points of northern California. Motor
ists using the main Peninsula highway
will follow Mission road to Colma and
then to San Bruno and the main high
way to Palo Alto. Congestion between
the "Bottle-neck" road from Colma and
the cemeteries may be avoided by tak
ing the Bay Shore highway, which joins
the main route at San Bruno. The third
route will be by way of the Great High
way and Skyline boulevard to Wood
side, and then south to the Stanford
campus by way of the county road.
This route will in all probability be 'the'
least used. Arrangements for parking
have been made so as to enable motor
ists from north or south of Palo Alto
to return in the same direction with the
least difficulty of delay.
Motorists who intend to continue in
the same direction following the game
must take the Middlefield road from
Redwood City, continuing over Mel
ville, Cowpcr, and Churchill avenues to
the highway south of the campus. Reg
ular southbound cars will be parked in
these areas for traffice to Oakland and
San Jose.
