# DR.W.W.CAMPBELL DISCUSSES QUESTION OF PLANETARY LIFE
## 
### 
While there is no evidence that ani
mal life exists anywhere else except on
the earth, there is a probability that
there is life in any direction one may
point, says Dr. W. W. Campbell, presi
dent of the University of California and
internationally known astronomical au
thority. Writing in the current issue of
the California Engineer, on the subject
"Are Other Planets Habitable?" Dr.
Campbell says:
"Venus and Mars are the only planets
in our sun's system which we need give
consideration if we are looking for evi
dences of habitation or habitality.
"Our sun is just one of at least a
billion suns which compose in large
measure our own stellar system, how
ever. What are the chances that only
one planet, the earth, of only one star,
the sun, should be the abode of life?
We do not actually know that any form
of animal life, such as human life, ex
ists elsewhere than on the earth.
"However, most astronomers would
be ready to join with me in saying that
in whatever general direction within
the great stellar system we care to
point the probabilities are fairly high
that life exists.
"The oxygen content of the atmos
phere above a square mile on Mars'
surface may, with equal confidence, be
said to be less than the oxygen content
of the earth's atmosphere situated
above a square mile of a horizontal
plane passing through the summit of
Mt. Everest.
"We men and women of the earth
certainly could not live on the surface
of Mars under those conditions. But
this does not mean that forms of life,
perhaps accompanied by intelligence of
a higher order than ours, could not
have developed on the planet Mars un
der the environmental conditions there
existing."
