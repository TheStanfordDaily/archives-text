# BIG GAME RALLY COMMITTEE PLANS FEATURE STUNTS
## Pop Warner, Captain Nevers To Address Enthusiasts In Stadium Talks 
### 
Despite the complete destruction of
the bonfire at 6:30 o'clock this morning
the pyre will be rebuilt and a record
crowd with record per capita enthusi
asm is expected to make the sky the
limit for noise and pep at the annual
Big Game rally tomorrow night.
With uncertainty and interest at
breathless pitch, thousands of people
from Palo Alto, San Francisco, Berke
ley, and San Jose, in addition to the
rooters, are expected to be present.
This Big Game rally has been plan
ned for women as well as men, and
will give the female population of the
campus an excellent chance to display
their enthusiasm, according to Calvin
H. Conron, chairman of the special
committee.
The parade will form as scheduled
at 7 o'clock at the postoffice. A special
thrill will be furnished at the rally
proper when the team makes its en
trance. While the precise nature of
this feature is being guarded as a
secret, both startling light effects and
a pandemonium of sounds will aid in
making it unusual and effective.
Daniel W. Evans, student body presi
dent in 1922, will represent the alumni
on the list of speakers. Pop Warner
and Ernie Nevers will give first-hand
slants on the game before the team
goes into retirement until Saturday.
