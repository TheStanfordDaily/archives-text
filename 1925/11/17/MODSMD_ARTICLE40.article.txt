# BIG GAME GAIETIES WILL BE DIRECTED BY GORDON DAVIS
## Chrysella Dunker to Direct Dancing; Jack Wiggin Handles Music 
### Isabel Schanck 
General direction of the football
show, "Big Game Gaieties," to be pro
duced Friday night is in the hands of
Gordon Davis, Stanford University
dramatic coach.

Davis' early career
was in vaudeville
on the professional
stage so he is well
qualified to direct
this type of show,
and handle people
appearing in sev
eral different skits
during one evening.
The special direc
tors for the "Gaie
ties" are Chrysella
Dunker and John

L. Wiggin. Miss
Dunker, who has charge of the wo
men's chorus, has had previous ex
perience directing chorus work in
several campus productions, and has
been identified with campus dramatics

for several years in
the capacity of
technical and art
director. She di
rected the choruses
for the 192S Junior
Opera, "Ace High,"
and the mummy
dance which was
featured in "Ace
High" was one of
the best of its kind
ever given at Stan
ford.
The "Gaieties"
chorus has good
opportunities to add

to the high standard which show re
hearsals promise. Besides two straight
numbers, it will appear in two nov
elty numbers and a finale.
The two featured numbers consist
of a dance in a romantic atmospheric

setting and a semi
burlesque wlii c h
was produced in
Andre Chariot's Re
vue. Dorothy Dali-
Jer, well known for
her excellent char
acterizations, will
appear in this num
ber.
The new football
song will be intro
duced by a novelty
chorus. Musical di
rection has been

taken over by John
L. Wiggin, who is a member of Ram's
Head and Sword and Sandals. Wiggin
took part last year in "Dulcy," "The
Devil's Daughter," and the Junior
Opera, "Ace High."
Football Song Feature
The best music which has been pre
sented here in several years is ex
pected to contribute to the success of
the "Gaieties." The new football song
which is to be featured is written by
Jean Wakefield. Although Miss Wake
field's music has been played by Gene
James' orchestra at the Palace hotel
in San Francisco, and has been broad
casted over the radio, this will be her
debut as a campus composer.
Kenneth Hess, connected with sev
eral Junior Operas, also has a song,
and a group of three original songs by
Wiggin, Bill Dekker, and Miss Wake
field are included in the program.
