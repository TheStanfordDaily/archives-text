# PATRICK PREDICTS STANFORD VICTORY IN GAME SATURDAY
## 
### 
Jack Patrick, fullback on this year's
championship Olympic Club team and
captain of the Stanford Varsity in 1921,
has ventured a prediction on the Big
He was an efficient part of the
Stanford offensive which resulted in
the dedicating touchdown for the new
stadium in the 1921 game. The predic
tion follows:
"Stanford's chances to beat California
look especially good to me. Talking
with different members of the team and
the coaching staff I have been im
pressed with a spirit that is even
greater than that of past Stanford
teams. Every member of the squad is
possessed of that same spirit that car
ried the Olympic Club on to victory,
'that California is not invincible, she
can be beaten, and Stanford is the team
that will do it.'
"We arc blessed with backfield ma
terial this year that we hitherto have
not been able to boast of, and any com
bination that Warner might choose to
use strikes me as being stronger than
any selection Andy Smith may offer.
The Stanford team has a wholesome
respect for Imlay, Dixon, Jabs, Young,
and some of the others, but they enter
tain no fears for any of them, and what
is more, they know that they can be
stopped, and will prove to all concerned
that the Red Shirts are the one's to
do it."
