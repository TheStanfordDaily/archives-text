# PREMATURE BLAZE THIRD OF KIND IN BONFIRE HISTORY
## Many Fruitless Attempts Made On Students in Former Years 
### Frank Baker 
After many failures in previous
years, a successful effort was finally
I made this morning to destroy the Big
; Game bonfire. This is the third time
j in the history of Stanford that the
pyre has been ignited by outsiders.
Twenty-four years ago this month
; firebugs invaded the campus and re
duced the wooden heap to ashes. At
that time all of the students turned
out en masse and rebuilt the structure
for the rally. Again in 1914 the Cardi
nal bonfire was destroyed, but until
| this morning, immediately after the
freshmen had relaxed their guard duty,
the firebrands had not been successful.
In the years when Stanford played
rugby, and Santa Clara was an im
portant opponent, three raids were
made on the toiling freshmen. In 1915
i sixty Santa Clarans grabbed six Cardi
| nal frosh and painted their heads a
i brilliant carmine. In 1916 the Mission
: ites painted the rock pillars at the foot
| of Palm Drive and daubed paint over
' the football bleachers. The next year
| some Stanford freshmen set off the
j Santa Clara pile and burned it to the
I ground.
The night of October 20, 1914, a
year when Cardinal spirit seemed to
be almost totally absent, six firebugs
from California raided the rally pyre
and made their escape, leaving only
flames and their "oski" behind as evi
j dence of their visit. Immediately fol-
I lowing the disaster, the slumbering
| Cardinal spirit awakened, a new bon-
I fire was constructed by the date of the
i rally, November 12, and Stanford
j swamped the Gold and Blue team with
i a score of 26 to 8. The same night the
i bonfire was lighted, two corps of Stan
! ford conspirators journeyed across the
bay and doused the big "C" with a
bright vermilion which even the coat
of yelllow paint applied the next morn
ing could not entirely obliterate.
In 1920 two time-bombs were placed
in the Stanford structure; one of these
bombs went off and nearly caused the
destruction of the bonfire, but the sec
ond was discovered before the clock
work had set it in motion. The first
bomb shot a puff of smoke up the
entire height of the stack, and then
flames started near (he bottom. Guard
ing freshmen successfully put out the
conflagration with dirt and mud before
any serious damage was done.
An airplane attack was considered
proper by certain firebugs in 1922.
Three bombs were dropped from a
plane which flew over the campus from
the North and circled low over the
structure. These bombs were of phos
phorus and could not be put out, but
luckily each one fell clear of the struc
ture by over twenty feet.
The following year six men drove up
in a closed car in the early hours of
the morning and lighted the pyre at
the bottom, after throwing oil about
the base of the structure. A lone stu
dent returning from Palo Alto at that
time saw the tiny blaze, rushed over
to the bonfire, and extinguished the
flames before the fire could spread.
Last year there was some excite
ment at the time of the Big Game
when the Berkeley "C" was again
painted red, but subsequent investiga
tion proved that the act had been done
by high school students.
