# STUDENTS REBUILD PYRE
## NEW PILE RISES AS ENTIRE STUDENT BODY WORKS ABUNDANT FUEL ASSURED Largest Bonfire in Stanford History to Be Finished Early Tomorrow 
### 
BULLETIN
Another attempt to destroy the Big
Game rally fire, erected on the smould
ering ruins of the pyre ignited this
morning, was frustrated when two time
bombs were discovered in the material
ready for second pile at 3:15 this after
noon.
Two mysterious telephone messages
reported the presence of the bombs, ac
cording to reports, leading to their dis
covery and removal. One bomb con
tained phosporus paper, and the other
was an ordinary time bomb, with four
batteries attached.
Smouldering embers from the origi
nal 1029 bonfire had scarcely ceased
glowing before a pyre that will surpass
any previous efforts in bonfire-building
had risen to a startling height on a
spot a few feet away from the original
site under the enthusiastic hands of
practically the entire student body by
noon today. The new fire will be com
pleted sometime during the early
morning and will be awaiting the con
clusion of the 13ig Game Rally tomor
row night to hurl its hungry tongues
of flame through California's coffin,
which will be suspended above it.
The new fire will be approximately
40 feet wide and eighty feet high, it
was announced this morning by the
committee of ten appointed by Student
Body President Robert P. Lewis to
supervise the construction. The Uni
versity has turned every resource un
der its control to the work of erecting
a new fire. Merchants in Palo Alto have
also turned their trucks over to the
committee to expedite construction.
A wide net has been spread and
material has been pouring in from all
over the peninsula during the morning.
At 8:o0 o'clock this morning five truck
loads of material arrived at the scene
of the fire from San Jose, from where
it was sent by Stanford alumni who
had heard early reports of the burning.
Alumni in San Francisco had wood en
route before 9 o'clock and a steady
stream has been coming in from this
source all day.
In addition to the eight trucks loaned
by the merchants and the corporation
yard vehicles, a great number of pri
vate trucks, wagons, automobiles, and
trailers were made available for use
a few minutes after reconstruction was
started. Students began working as
soon as it was found feasible to re
build, and trenches had been dug and
supports erected before the arrival of
the first wood.
The following committee has charge
of the work: Bob Titus, chairman; Jim
Sapero, Runt Minard, Cal Conron,
Linn Farish, Jake Irwin, Charlie Dick
inson, Don Flickinger, Huh Moffatt,
and Sam Hayes. Under the direction
| of this committee work will continue
i until the lire is ready for the rally. It
i will be at least eighty feet in height
; before work is stopped, and if ma
j terial is available, will be even of more
; preponderous dimensions.
The fire ready for the Rally tomor
! row will be the largest in the history
of the University. The fire built by the
j class of 1928, which is said to have
been the largest in the past, was 79
feet high and 30 feet square.
Quantities of timber from all points
on the peninsula will be added to
night and tomorrow morning to the
big pile now being rushed to comple
| tion.
Four gondola cars loaded with rail
road ties will be spotted at the Palo
Alto station at 7:30 o'clock tomorrow
morning. These ties have been donated
by a large railway company.
A carload of timbers from San Fran
cisco, donated by alumni there, will
[ arrive at 1 a.m., at the same time that
| a similar load will arrive from San
| Jose.
The Redwood Cement Company has
j offered 20 truckloads of material and
| the work of transporting this lumber
i was begun early today.
The San Jose and San Francisco
j alumni organizations, the Palo Alto
I and Redwood City Chambers of Com
merce, and the University and Mili
tary Department have given the use
of all available trucks. These comprize
a group of about 20 vehicles which are
being used in bringing wood to the
pile. In addition, two tractors have
been donated by the Military Depart
ment and one by the University.
The P. G. & E. Company donated
the use of a truck and a crew of men
this morning to aid in putting up the
telephone poles which form the founda
tion of the fire. Most of the poles used
were also donated by this company.
Work tonight will be conducted un
der the direction of holdovers, and
Chairman Bob Titus of the committee
I in charge has issued a call for all liold
! overs to report at the bonfire site at
| 7 o'clock.
A special power line will be strung
! from the power house to the working
site, and powerful flood lights will be
'distributed about the bonfire to enable
| work to continue throughout the night.
Oil for use in igniting the fire will
I be donated by the Standard Oil Com
pany, the Union Oil Company, and
1 Steffen and Williams, of Palo Alto.

it was sent by Stanford alumni who
had heard early reports of the burning.
Alumni in San Francisco had wood en
route before 9 o'clock and a steady
stream has been coming in from this
source all day.
In addition to the eight trucks loaned
by the merchants and the corporation
yard vehicles, a great number of pri
vate trucks, wagons, automobiles, and
trailers were made available for use
a few minutes after reconstruction was
started. Students began working as
soon as it was found feasible to re
build, and trenches had been dug and
supports erected before the arrival of
the first wood.
The following committee has charge
of the work: Bob Titus, chairman; Jim
Sapero, Runt Minard, Cal Conron,
Linn Farish, Jake Irwin, Charlie Dick
inson, Don Flickinger, Huh Moffatt,
and Sam Hayes. Under the direction
| of this committee work will continue
i until the lire is ready for the rally. It
i will be at least eighty feet in height
; before work is stopped, and if ma
j terial is available, will be even of more
; preponderous dimensions.
The fire ready for the Rally tomor
! row will be the largest in the history
of the University. The fire built by the
j class of 1928, which is said to have
been the largest in the past, was 79
feet high and 30 feet square.
Quantities of timber from all points
on the peninsula will be added to
night and tomorrow morning to the
big pile now being rushed to comple
| tion.
Four gondola cars loaded with rail
road ties will be spotted at the Palo
Alto station at 7:30 o'clock tomorrow
morning. These ties have been donated
by a large railway company.
A carload of timbers from San Fran
cisco, donated by alumni there, will
[ arrive at 1 a.m., at the same time that
| a similar load will arrive from San
| Jose.
The Redwood Cement Company has
j offered 20 truckloads of material and
| the work of transporting this lumber
i was begun early today.
The San Jose and San Francisco
j alumni organizations, the Palo Alto
I and Redwood City Chambers of Com
merce, and the University and Mili
tary Department have given the use
of all available trucks. These comprize
a group of about 20 vehicles which are
being used in bringing wood to the
pile. In addition, two tractors have
been donated by the Military Depart
ment and one by the University.
The P. G. & E. Company donated
the use of a truck and a crew of men
this morning to aid in putting up the
telephone poles which form the founda
tion of the fire. Most of the poles used
were also donated by this company.
Work tonight will be conducted un
der the direction of holdovers, and
Chairman Bob Titus of the committee
I in charge has issued a call for all liold

BULLETIN
Another attempt to destroy the Big
Game rally fire, erected on the smould
ering ruins of the pyre ignited this
morning, was frustrated when two time
bombs were discovered in the material
ready for second pile at 3:15 this after
noon.
Two mysterious telephone messages
reported the presence of the bombs, ac
cording to reports, leading to their dis
covery and removal. One bomb con
tained phosporus paper, and the other
was an ordinary time bomb, with four
batteries attached.
Smouldering embers from the origi
nal 1029 bonfire had scarcely ceased
glowing before a pyre that will surpass
any previous efforts in bonfire-building
had risen to a startling height on a
spot a few feet away from the original
site under the enthusiastic hands of
practically the entire student body by
noon today. The new fire will be com
pleted sometime during the early
morning and will be awaiting the con
clusion of the 13ig Game Rally tomor
row night to hurl its hungry tongues
of flame through California's coffin,
which will be suspended above it.
The new fire will be approximately
40 feet wide and eighty feet high, it
was announced this morning by the
committee of ten appointed by Student
Body President Robert P. Lewis to
supervise the construction. The Uni
versity has turned every resource un
der its control to the work of erecting
a new fire. Merchants in Palo Alto have
also turned their trucks over to the
committee to expedite construction.
A wide net has been spread and
material has been pouring in from all
over the peninsula during the morning.
At 8:o0 o'clock this morning five truck
loads of material arrived at the scene
of the fire from San Jose, from where
it was sent by Stanford alumni who

BULLETIN
Another attempt to destroy the Big
Game rally fire, erected on the smould
ering ruins of the pyre ignited this
morning, was frustrated when two time
bombs were discovered in the material
ready for second pile at 3:15 this after
noon.
Two mysterious telephone messages
reported the presence of the bombs, ac
cording to reports, leading to their dis
covery and removal. One bomb con
tained phosporus paper, and the other
was an ordinary time bomb, with four
batteries attached.
Smouldering embers from the origi
nal 1029 bonfire had scarcely ceased
glowing before a pyre that will surpass
any previous efforts in bonfire-building
had risen to a startling height on a
spot a few feet away from the original
site under the enthusiastic hands of
practically the entire student body by
noon today. The new fire will be com
pleted sometime during the early
morning and will be awaiting the con
clusion of the 13ig Game Rally tomor
row night to hurl its hungry tongues
of flame through California's coffin,
which will be suspended above it.
The new fire will be approximately
40 feet wide and eighty feet high, it
was announced this morning by the
committee of ten appointed by Student
Body President Robert P. Lewis to
supervise the construction. The Uni
versity has turned every resource un
der its control to the work of erecting
a new fire. Merchants in Palo Alto have
also turned their trucks over to the
committee to expedite construction.
A wide net has been spread and
material has been pouring in from all
over the peninsula during the morning.
At 8:o0 o'clock this morning five truck
loads of material arrived at the scene
of the fire from San Jose, from where
it was sent by Stanford alumni who
had heard early reports of the burning.
Alumni in San Francisco had wood en
route before 9 o'clock and a steady
stream has been coming in from this
source all day.
In addition to the eight trucks loaned
by the merchants and the corporation
yard vehicles, a great number of pri
vate trucks, wagons, automobiles, and
trailers were made available for use
a few minutes after reconstruction was
started. Students began working as
soon as it was found feasible to re
build, and trenches had been dug and
supports erected before the arrival of
the first wood.
The following committee has charge
of the work: Bob Titus, chairman; Jim
Sapero, Runt Minard, Cal Conron,
Linn Farish, Jake Irwin, Charlie Dick
inson, Don Flickinger, Huh Moffatt,
and Sam Hayes. Under the direction
| of this committee work will continue
i until the lire is ready for the rally. It
i will be at least eighty feet in height
; before work is stopped, and if ma
j terial is available, will be even of more
; preponderous dimensions.
The fire ready for the Rally tomor
! row will be the largest in the history
of the University. The fire built by the
j class of 1928, which is said to have
been the largest in the past, was 79
feet high and 30 feet square.
Quantities of timber from all points
on the peninsula will be added to
night and tomorrow morning to the
big pile now being rushed to comple
| tion.
Four gondola cars loaded with rail
road ties will be spotted at the Palo
Alto station at 7:30 o'clock tomorrow
morning. These ties have been donated
by a large railway company.
