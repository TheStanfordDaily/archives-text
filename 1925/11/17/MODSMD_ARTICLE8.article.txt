# STUDENTS REBUILD PYRE
## NEW PILE RISES AS ENTIRE STUDENT BODY WORKS ABUNDANT FUEL ASSURED Largest Bonfire in Stanford History to Be Finished Early Tomorrow 
### 
BULLETIN
Another attempt to destroy the Big
Game rally fire, erected on the smould
ering ruins of the pyre ignited this
morning, was frustrated when two time
bombs were discovered in the material
ready for second pile at 3:15 this after
noon.
Two mysterious telephone messages
reported the presence of the bombs, ac
cording to reports, leading to their dis
covery and removal. One bomb con
tained phosporus paper, and the other
was an ordinary time bomb, with four
batteries attached.
Smouldering embers from the origi
nal 1029 bonfire had scarcely ceased
glowing before a pyre that will surpass
any previous efforts in bonfire-building
had risen to a startling height on a
spot a few feet away from the original
site under the enthusiastic hands of
practically the entire student body by
noon today. The new fire will be com
pleted sometime during the early
morning and will be awaiting the con
clusion of the 13ig Game Rally tomor
row night to hurl its hungry tongues
of flame through California's coffin,
which will be suspended above it.
The new fire will be approximately
40 feet wide and eighty feet high, it
was announced this morning by the
committee of ten appointed by Student
Body President Robert P. Lewis to
supervise the construction. The Uni
versity has turned every resource un
der its control to the work of erecting
a new fire. Merchants in Palo Alto have
also turned their trucks over to the
committee to expedite construction.
A wide net has been spread and
material has been pouring in from all
over the peninsula during the morning.
At 8:o0 o'clock this morning five truck
loads of material arrived at the scene
of the fire from San Jose, from where
it was sent by Stanford alumni who
had heard early reports of the burning.
Alumni in San Francisco had wood en
route before 9 o'clock and a steady
stream has been coming in from this
source all day.
In addition to the eight trucks loaned
by the merchants and the corporation
yard vehicles, a great number of pri
vate trucks, wagons, automobiles, and
trailers were made available for use
a few minutes after reconstruction was
started. Students began working as
soon as it was found feasible to re
build, and trenches had been dug and
supports erected before the arrival of
the first wood.
The following committee has charge
of the work: Bob Titus, chairman; Jim
Sapero, Runt Minard, Cal Conron,
Linn Farish, Jake Irwin, Charlie Dick
inson, Don Flickinger, Huh Moffatt,
