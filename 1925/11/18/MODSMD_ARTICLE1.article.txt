# GRID SQUAD ENDS PREPARATION FOR CALIFORNIA GAME
## Cards to Go Into Seclusion Immediately Following Rally Tonight 
### Wilbur Adams 
Perrin will start at half instead of
Dixon in the big game Saturday, ac
cording to an announcement made yes
terday by Andy Smith, California
coach. Dixon will be on the bench at
the start of the game because of in
juries which he received in the Cali
fornia-Washington game last week.

Pop Warner put the Stanford varsity
through the last practice prior to the
Big Game, this afternoon. Immediately
after the rally tonight the complete
squad will slip away to a place un
known, where the men will be kept in
seclusion until Saturday morning. The
team finished practice without any
new injuries, and Poulson is positively
the only player that will be kept out
of the battle.
California has chosen Los Gatos as
the place to spend the remaining days
of the week. Stanford's hiding place is
unknown except to a chosen few. War
ner is taking his men to a private re
sort in the nearby mountains, where
they will be alone, and where they
can undergo a period of complete re
laxation. The squad will be housed in
a number of log cabins which are on
the estate.
Smith Has Tricks
Against Washington, the Bears
showed little besides straight football,
but Saturday, Smith is sure to have
his men pull a few tricks at the right
moment. The Dixon-to-Imlay pass that
worked so effectively in the Big Game
last year has hardly been seen this
season. Smith possesses a reverse play
that is a fooler, but Warner saw it
work against the Huskies, and he does
pot intend to see it succeed against
his own team. Imlay was undoubtedly
saved last week, for he hardly had his
hands on the ball during the contest.
The California captain will probably
carry the pigskin against Stanford as
much as Jabs does, and a few more
times than Dixon.
Card Attack Varied
Stanford has a varied attack to work
against California in this year's Big
Game. Last season, Warner had no
one that could run the ends, and none
that could buck the line like Nevers,
and yet the Cards tied the Bears with
.a placekick and a couple of forward
passes Stanford does lack a place
kicker this year, but there are plenty
of backfield men that can forward
pass. Nevers, Murphy, Hyland, and
Hill can all pass far and accurately,
while Murphy, Hyland, Bogue, and
Hill can run the ends.
If a punting duel develops between
Dixon and Nevers, Stanford should
have the advantage. Neither of the
men are fast at getting kicks off, and a
blocked punt may be seen before the
game is over. Stanford's captain had
an off-day with his kicking in Seattle,
but this was the first game this season
that Nevers has not outkicked his op
ponent. DiJfion is clever at placing his
kicks, but he can not average as far
as Nevers. Stanford's reserve punters
are Murphy and Hyland.
