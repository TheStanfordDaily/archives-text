### 
Bill Ncill, star guard on the 1924
Cardinal football team, ventures his
prediction on the Big Game Saturday.
Neill played practically every game for
Stanford last year, including the Notre
Dame and California contests.
"If I thought California would play
against Stanford in the same manner as
they played against Washington last
Saturday, I would say Stanford was a
cinch to win.
"California will undoubtedly play a
better game against us, however, and
this will make the outcome more doubt
ful. Nevertheless, I am firmly con
vinced that Stanford has the best team
when considered as a whole.
"The lines of the two teams are on
par, but Stanford has the edge in the
backfield. This will probably be the
deciding factor of the game, and will
turn the tide in favor of the Cardinal."
