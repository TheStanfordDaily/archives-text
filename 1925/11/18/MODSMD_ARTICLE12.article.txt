# WILBUR APPROVES OF ARRANGEMENTS FOR YACHT PARTY
## 
### 
President Wilbur has approved the
plans for the Sophomore Yachting
Party which will be held the after
noon and morning of December 5 in
connection with the activities sched
uled for Sophomore Week. Plans for
the yachting trip had previously been
approved by Dean Yost and by Harry
L. Noland, student manager, but no
definite arrangements had been com
pleted until the sanction of President
Wilbur could be obtained.
Tickets for the yachting party,
which will be for Stanford students,
either "queeners or roughs," will be
placed on sale from 1 to 4 o'clock in
the Administration building, Thursday,
at $1.25 per person. Only two hundred
tickets will be sold.
The trip as scheduled will be held
Saturday in place of the usual tea
dance formerly held by sophomore
classes. A special Southern Pacific
train will leave Palo Alto at 10:45 a.m.,
arriving at San Francisco at noon. The
specially-chartered yacht will leave
Crowley's pier upon the arrival of the
train, and will cruise the bay and the
Golden Gate region until five o'clock,
when it will return to the pier. The
special train will leave for Palo Alto,
arriving in time for dinner and the
sophomore mystery play which will be
held Saturday evening.
An orchestra will accompany the
party during the trip, while the yacht
ing party committee will arrange for
refreshments.
Dean Yost has sanctioned the party
oil condition that the students travel
as a group, return in time for supper
Saturday evening, and travel by the
special train instead of in individual
automobile parties.
