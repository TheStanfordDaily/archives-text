### 
Analysis of the bomb found yester
day afternoon in an old tar barrel des
tined for the second bonfire revealed
that the infernal machine contained
clock, dry cells, phosphorus, black
powder, and sodium. The bomb was
analyzed at the fire house.
The main bomb was hidden in the
barrel under a thin layer of cardboard
which had been sealed with tar. The
explosive materials were arranged at
the bottom of the barrel with several
smaller bombs.
Sodium becomes highly inflammable
when exposed to water. It was used in
the bomb to make certain that the pile
would be burned despite the applica
tion of water. The bar of sodium,
which was about four inches square
and a foot long, and worth about $5,
will be used by the Physics department
in research work.
