# "BIG GAME GAIETIES" CAST GOES THROUGH DRESS REHEARSAL
## 
### 
Everybody that is in any way
connected with the cast of the
Football Gaieties of 1925 must re
port at the Assembly hall tonight
at 8:30 o'clock.

Dress rehearsal for the football
show, "Big Game Gaieties," to be pro
duced Friday evening in the Assembly
hall at 8:15 o'clock, was held last
night. The football show committee is
making efforts to have the best bal
anced program for the "Gaieties" that
has ever been presented for this type
of show at Stanford.
The opening number is a campus
adaptation of the conventional Broad
way revue. Among the acts of the show
which will be featured are two paro
dies by Dave Lamson and A. Grove
Day. One of the parodies is a picture
of college life after the manner of
Kaufmann and Connelly in their adap
tation of "The Beggar on Horseback"
from the German.
Lamson is a member of the class of
'25 and was editor of Chaparral last
year. He figured prominently in cam
pus dramatics, assisting in play direc
tion. Day is well known for his excel
lent character work in several campus
plays including "Captain Applejack,"
"The Dover Road," "Macbeth," and
"Dear Brutus."
An act consisting of a group of songs
in an atmospheric setting by the quar
tette from the Glee Club will also be
on the program.
