# Meeting an Emergency
## 
### 
Yesterday a startled campus awoke to find the results of two weeks
work smouldering in a pile of scarred timbers. Without hesitation the
entire student body turned to the work of reconstruction and in twenty
four hours a pile of greater size was towering above the spot where the
original pyre had scarcely grown cold.
Although men from every class in the University helped with the work
it was largely through the unrelenting efforts of the freshmen that the
new structure was completed so rapidly. Everyone in the first year class
worked energetically from the moment it was found feasible to rebuild.
Stanford crashed through nobly in an emergency. The much dis
cussed, and often criticised "Stanford Spirit" was evinced to the nth de
gree. Probably never before has such interest and enthusiasm been
demonstrated.
The question now arises: Since Stanford spirit exists (usually in a
latent state) what can be done to keep it constantly bubbling and effer
vescent ?
We have seen the spirit. Few of us expect it to continue as it did yes
terday. Yet, that is not too much to hope for. What should be done?
The freshmen clearly demonstrated that the fault does not lie with
them. They didn't realize the necessity for continuous guarding of the
bonfire. No one had warned them of the serious dangers which might
ar i se —they had been told that guarding of the lire was good because it
gave them a chance to have a "bull" session and to get acquainted with their
classmates. No one had instructed them to have adequate fire equipment
ready for any emergency. From the suggestions made to them by those
who should have seen that the bonfire plans were properly carried out, the
freshmen had every right to believe that the fire would be safe while they
went to breakfast.
The freshmen have come through with flying colors in the last 36 hours.
We must look elsewhere if we are to find the reason for the hibernation
of Stanford spirit.
