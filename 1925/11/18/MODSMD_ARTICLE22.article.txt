# Quick Co-operation

In the face of the recent student crisis, the merchants of Palo Alto and
the Peninsula have responded loyally to the call for aid. Each has at
tempted to outdo his business rival in his response. Without their assist
ance so speedily lent, furthermore, it is doubtful if tonight Cardinal root
ers would be cremating the effigy of California's bear on the traditional
bonfire.
Financial means to pay for transportation and so forth has been given.
Timber and wood made unexpected appearances yesterday morning at nu
merous store exits. And the employes of the Telephone Company were
among the first on the scene of action, setting poles for a new pyre.
San Francisco and San Jose alumni must also come in for their share
of praise for their contributions of material.
It is indeed warming to the heart to realize that Palo Alto backing is
more than intangible good wishes. W hen the merchant and professional
man can devote several hours and a few dollars to the erection of a mass
of wood which is to be laid in ashes within a few hours, Stanford need
never fear that its crises will grow beyond its control.
Therefore, when the monster monument to Stanford hopes is set on
fire tonight, it will I>e symbolical of a Cardinal spirit that is not the posses
sion of the student body alone. It is now to be worthily shared by those
who have given active aid the past two days.
Thank you, Mr. Business Man !
