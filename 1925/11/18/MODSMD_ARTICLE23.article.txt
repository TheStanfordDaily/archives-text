Many Stanford women unhesitatingly thrust aside lip sticks, books, and
dates yesterday and joined the 2500 in the common cause of rebuilding a
monster bonfire. They raised money by conducting a tag campaign. Then
they organized a canteen shack close to the site of the pile and supplied the
workers with a 'constant stream of coffee, doughnuts, and cigarettes
throughout the night.
Because of this demonstration of whole hearted interest 110 one can
doubt but that Stanford women are "right there." Hats off to them!
