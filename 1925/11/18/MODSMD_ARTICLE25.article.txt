J The Editor, Sir:
This letter is in the way of an an
j swer to a question raised in an edi
torial appearing in yesterday's edition
of the Daily Palo Alto, entitled "Sopho
more Discipline." If I am not mistaken,
the thesis of the editorial is that the
premature firing of the rally pyre dem
| onstrated that sophomore discipline
should be reinstated. To quote: "No
sophomores were around to see to it
that the bonfire was not left unguard
ed for a single moment. Result: a mass
of burnt timber." On page one of the
same issue a story relates that the
big pile has been prematurely burned
on two previous occasions. May we
venture to inquire where the "sopho
more guardians" were on those two
occasions? Without wishing to be face
tious, Mr. Editor, or to adopt an atti
tude in any way critical of your edi
torial column, may we suggest that the
thesis and its development point not
to the need for a change in the present
system so much as to the naivete of
the writer in dealing with the facts of
the situation?
Several concrete aspects of the situ
ation present theihselves. In the first
place, we do not believe that a rever
sion to the former system is desirable.
The success of the freshman class,
both in athletics and in scholarship,
since the inauguration of the new plan
of senior control is a fact so notorious
as not to require even the support of
satistics, although these are readily
available. To suggest a sharp contrast
between the importance of an accident
such as the lighting of the fire, on one
hand, and the significance of striking
improvements in scholastic and ath
letic achievement, on the other, re
veals, we believe, an immature view
point.
What were the purposes of sopho
more discipline? They were many.
Among those of importance were two:
first, to teach the new men the ways
of Stanford; second, to prevent fresh
men from acquiring that offensive
habit of being "cocky." We believe
that older men in the University are
more capable of imparting to the fresh
men the true value of Stanford tradi
tions. The sponsor system is far from
perfect, but it is a step in the right
direction. Intelligent freshmen can
judge for themselves what are the real
values in the traditions of the Univer
sity. The theory that all Stanford tra
ditions are equally worth-while and
that newcomers should be obliged
forcibly to don them, as they would
a new suit of clothes, is so juvenile
that it needs no answer. Then there
is the case of the "cocky" freshman.
Our limited opportunity for observa-1
tion points to the conclusion that fresh-1
men who are made of the right stuff i
do not need to have information ad
ministered with the aid of the paddle.
Those who really need this type of
treatment are not worth wasting even
a good sophomore's time on. In the
days of the second-class discipline we
venture to say that it was more often
the sophomore himself, with his new
powers poorly harmonized with his
immature faculties, who was the more I
offensive of the two. If the freshmen
of this year, the chaps who, before the ;
last flames from yesterday's fire had
died, cheerfully bent themselves to
the task of building anew —if these
bovs are typical of the "cocky frosli" j
whom the present, regime produces,!
we should like to see more of their
kjnd. These men are fully capable of
perceiving what is beautiful, and
strong, and worth-while in Stanford
life without the interference of sopho- \
more tutors.
If more efficiency is needed in the
supervision of future fires, let us have

J The Editor, Sir:
This letter is in the way of an an
j swer to a question raised in an edi
torial appearing in yesterday's edition
of the Daily Palo Alto, entitled "Sopho
more Discipline." If I am not mistaken,
the thesis of the editorial is that the
premature firing of the rally pyre dem
| onstrated that sophomore discipline
should be reinstated. To quote: "No
sophomores were around to see to it
that the bonfire was not left unguard
ed for a single moment. Result: a mass
of burnt timber." On page one of the
same issue a story relates that the
big pile has been prematurely burned
on two previous occasions. May we
venture to inquire where the "sopho
more guardians" were on those two
occasions? Without wishing to be face
tious, Mr. Editor, or to adopt an atti
tude in any way critical of your edi
torial column, may we suggest that the
thesis and its development point not
to the need for a change in the present
system so much as to the naivete of
the writer in dealing with the facts of
the situation?
Several concrete aspects of the situ
ation present theihselves. In the first
place, we do not believe that a rever
sion to the former system is desirable.
The success of the freshman class,
both in athletics and in scholarship,
since the inauguration of the new plan
of senior control is a fact so notorious
as not to require even the support of
satistics, although these are readily
available. To suggest a sharp contrast
between the importance of an accident
such as the lighting of the fire, on one
hand, and the significance of striking
improvements in scholastic and ath
letic achievement, on the other, re
veals, we believe, an immature view
point.
What were the purposes of sopho
more discipline? They were many.
Among those of importance were two:
first, to teach the new men the ways
of Stanford; second, to prevent fresh
men from acquiring that offensive
habit of being "cocky." We believe
that older men in the University are
more capable of imparting to the fresh
men the true value of Stanford tradi
tions. The sponsor system is far from
perfect, but it is a step in the right
direction. Intelligent freshmen can
judge for themselves what are the real
values in the traditions of the Univer
sity. The theory that all Stanford tra
ditions are equally worth-while and
that newcomers should be obliged
forcibly to don them, as they would
a new suit of clothes, is so juvenile
that it needs no answer. Then there
is the case of the "cocky" freshman.
