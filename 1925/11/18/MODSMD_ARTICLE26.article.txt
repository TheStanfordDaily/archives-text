# DAY'S DOINGS

Ted Elias, Jr.-

Varsity at last has finished
With the season's football grind,
They will rest and take it easy,
'Till the "Golden Skin" they find.
For the ones who were assembled,
There was held Sequoia's wake,
Midst the moaning and the crying,
Burning Berkeley's hopes at stake.
Sophomore women fed the workers,
That were on the job last night,
So the chance of freshmen starving
Certainly was very slight.
Someone said we have no spirit,
And that all our fight is gone,
But tonight there is a Rally,
Let them know the fight is on.
Tickets for the sophomore party
Have at last been placed on sale,
For the price of five simoleons
You can ride and dance and sail.
