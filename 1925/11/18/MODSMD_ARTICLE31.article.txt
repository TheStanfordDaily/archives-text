# WORK OF GENERAL MANAGER'S OFFICE SHOWN BY REPORT
## 
### Frank Baker 
The work of the General Manager's
office in 1924-25 is explained in a re
port made out by Orville H. Tucker,
assistant to Paul H. Davis, last year's
graduate manager.
One of the most notable achievements
of the year was the taking over of the
Student Organizations' Fund. Under
the present system all organizations
handle their finances through the gen
eral offices of the A.S.S.U., and pay a
certain small percentage for having
their books kept in perfect order and
balance.
All checks and actual payments are
made from the general manager's office,
and a detailed account of each debit
and credit must be sent into the office
by the organization manager. This
makes an excellent check on all ex
penditures of the various organizations,
for the manager sends a payment order
to the office, then the general manager
checks the extensions and prices, and
makes out the check, thus keeping the i
whole transaction in experienced hands.
A number of new accounts were
brought into the fund, and the general
manager hopes eventually to have all
organizations under its head. Last j
year's additions were: Skull and Snakes |
Society, Encina Club, German Club,
French Play, Economics Club, Law
Association, Civil Engineering Society.
Handle Debate Funds
The debate manager was put on a
budget by the general manager, and
his strict adherence to the budget re
duced the expenses of debating to a:
figure much lower than they had been
for some years. The general manager
was made a member of the Dramatic
Council, so as to keep in closer touch
with the situation. Dramatics at Stan
ford has expanded so rapidly in the
past few years that a great deal of work
has been necessary to line up a syste
matic method of handling its finances.
All classes made a financial report to
the manager and in every case showed
an increase during the year. Following
is the lump sum report of the four un
dergraduate classes:
Class Sept., 1, 1924 June 7, 1925
1925 $288.26 $1038.17
1926 54.39 514.17
1927 43.02 19722
1928 149.37
Students Edit Annual
Associated Students undertook for
the first time the editing of the year
book of Stanford University. In order
to supervise the book, a board of nine
members was formed. The general

manager is the only permanent member
of this board, and is thus a stabilizing
influence.
All activities were required to send in
financial reports to the general manager
so these reports could act as guides for
future functions. Under this careful
system all dances except the Military
Ball were handled in such a way that all
showed at least a slight profit. The
Military Ball resulted in a small deficit.
In the future the Military department
will be required to purchase at least
150 tickets to be sold to its own mem
bers ,the tickets being non-transferable.
Manage Student Accounts
The accounts of the Associated Stu
dents were financially sound at the end
of the year, showing a balance of
$1226.18, a gain of about $350.00 over
the preceding fall. Aside from the
usual expenditures, the management
undertook to pay off a $1500 indebted
ness of the Spectator, defunct literary
magazine. It also took care of the
Student Organizations' Fund, and helped
Sigma Delta Chi, journalistic fraternity,
to finance the convention of high school
editors.
