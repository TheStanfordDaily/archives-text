# ORATORIO WILL BE PRODUCED IN S. F.
## 
### 
Handel's oratorio, "The Messiah," is
to be presented on December 15 in the j
Civic Auditorium in San Francisco.
The great chorus of 300 voices has been
rehearsing for the past three months
under the direction of Alfred Hertz, di-!
rector of the San Francisco Symphony |
Orchestra. Paul Althousc and Arthur i
Middleton will be the vocal soloists at
the final presentation. The Symphony I
orchestra will also participate in an j
augmented form.

Faced with the necessity of signing
an important student document and
finding himself without a pen, the
Chancellor of Syracuse University
signed the paper with a Theta Sigma
Phi pledge pin dipped in mud.
