# GOOD ORGANIZATION BRINGS BONFIRE TO RAPID COMPLETION
## 
### 
Semi - military organization which
worked with machine-like precision
; was largely responsible for the speed
j with which the second and larger bon
' fire rose beside the smouldering ern-
I hers of the first. Construction was di
rected by the following committee ap
pointed by Robert E. Lewis, president
of the student body: Bob Titus, chair
man; Jim Sapero, Runt Minard, Cal
Conron, Linn Farish, Jake Irwin, Char
lie Dickinson, Don Flickinger, Hub
Moffatt, and Sam Hayes.
Plans were hurriedly laid by the
committee making possible the con
struction of a bonfire which required
approximately thirty hours of working
time for completion. The workers were
divided into different sections that
worked as units, yet were under the
immediate direction of Titus.
Country Scoured for Fuel
One group was sent out in trucks,
wagons, and machines to scour the
campus and surrounding country for
wood. When the vehicles returned the
fuel was unloaded and placed in piles.
After the foundation of the bonfire
was laid, two gangplanks were placed
on either side of pyre, where stu
dents were stationed to receive wood
from the piles and pass it up in a con
tinuous stream to those working at the
top of the structure. Large pieces of
timber were hoisted up by means of a
pulley.
Flood Lights Erected
After dark a corps of electricians j
erected flood lights and electric light j
globes to furnish light for the workers.
A number of upperclassmen acted as j
police to guard the bonfire and keep
prowlers and onlookers from interfer
ing with the construction. A ring of
small fires encircling the pyre was con
stantly fed by another group.
Under the direction 6f Sylva Wea-j
ver, women were placed on duty to
provide food, smokes, and first aid to
the workers.
By working in shifts, the students j
were given a chance to rest and get a
bite to eat without halting the work
on the bonfire.
