"Appreciation of books and art grows
in the home. The school can teach
certain things but it cannot force imagi
nation and a love of books upon a stu
dent who did not learn them at home,"
said Miss Edith R. Mirrielees in her
talk on "English Preparation of the
College Student" at the November
meeting of the Stanford Mothers' Club,
held yesterday afternoon.
"Reading aloud was the family past
time a score of years ago, and the
younger generation gained a real
knowledge of literature. In the last
decade, English teachcrs have faced the
problem of fostering an appreciation of
literature in youths to whom books are
unknown. The need has been partly
met by courses meant to stimulate
imagination, since the student's short
coming is not in practical knowledge of
facts," continued Miss Mirrielees.
As an explanation for failure of fresh
men to pass the Matriculation Test,
Miss Mirrielees said that "A student's
use of English is practically fixed by
the time he is 16. Hie fault lies with
the overburdened English teachers of
California who must fail to give ade
quate instruction in written composi
tion, or lose their health in the attempt
give it."
