# LARGEST BONFIRE IN HISTORY BUILT BY STUDENTS, ALUMNI
## Big Pile Ready for Cremation Of Berkeley Bear at Rally Tonight 
### 
Just thirty hours after flames began
the destruction of the pyre built by
the freshman class, the largest bonfire
in University history was practically
completed this noon after the finest
display of Stanford spirit ever known,
and awaits the match which will trans
form it into a roaring furnace tonight.
Forty feet square and sixty feet high,
the pile stands as a monument to the
whole-hearted co-operation of practi
cally every member of the student
body, alumni, and business men of
Palo Alto, San Francisco, and San
Jose.
Work Starts Early
Plans for another fire started im
mediately by Bob Lewis at the im
promptu rally on the discovery of the
fire were functioning smoothly two
hours after the original pile was
ablaze. A special committee appointed
by President Lewis and headed by Bob
Titus went immediately to work, and
by noon huge piles of lumber were
ready for the workers.
Trucks donated by the Corporation
Yard and garages of Palo Alto hauled
the wood for the 200 men working on
the fire, and by 3 o'clock approximate
ly 15,000 feet of lumber had been col
lected.
Recess at 2 a.m.
Working in gangs of twelve men,
construction progressed rapidly and
smoothly under direction of the com
mittee, and not until 2 o'clock this
morning was work suspended, on ac
count of lack of wood. More trucks
were sent out and at 5 o'clock opera
tions were resumed and did not cease
until the pyre was completed.
Flood lights brought from the sta
dium furnished the light for the work
ers, while women from Roble and the
sororities kept them supplied with hot
coffee, cigarettes, and sandwiches. The
food was donated by Palo Alto mer
chants.
Four carloads of ties and lumber
were received at 7:30 this morning
from the Alumni Association of San
Francisco, San Jose, and South San
Francisco, while many private cash
donations were received. A sale of
bonfire benefit tickets at 10 cents
apiece in Palo Alto netted approxi
mately $150. Much of this money was
used to buy nails, wire, and supplies.
Supper at the Fire
Supper was served at 6 o'clock to
the entire student body, after which
a rally was held. Burt Lapp and Bob
Lewis gave short talks while an or
chestra furnished music for a Charles
ton exhibition. At 7 o'clock work was
resumed, and not until all the wood
gathered was on the pyre did the
builders cease.
Following are the donations of Stan
ford alumni and friends: two cakes,
360 University avenue; $5, Elizabeth
E. McCuthin; ten cartons of cigarettes,
Liggett & Meyers Tobacco Co.; ten
cartons cigarettes, Maliany and Morey;
one dozen tin cups, Wilson and Ellis
Hardware store; two dozen tin cups
and spoons, 'alo Alto Hardware; fifty
pounds of nuils, Fullers. Many other
private contributions were also re
ceived.

used to buy nails, wire, and supplies.
Supper at the Fire
Supper was served at 6 o'clock to
the entire student body, after which
a rally was held. Burt Lapp and Bob
Lewis gave short talks while an or
chestra furnished music for a Charles
ton exhibition. At 7 o'clock work was
resumed, and not until all the wood
gathered was on the pyre did the
builders cease.
Following are the donations of Stan
ford alumni and friends: two cakes,
360 University avenue; $5, Elizabeth
E. McCuthin; ten cartons of cigarettes,
Liggett & Meyers Tobacco Co.; ten
cartons cigarettes, Maliany and Morey;
one dozen tin cups, Wilson and Ellis
Hardware store; two dozen tin cups
and spoons, 'alo Alto Hardware; fifty
pounds of nuils, Fullers. Many other
private contributions were also re
ceived.
Just thirty hours after flames began
the destruction of the pyre built by
the freshman class, the largest bonfire
in University history was practically
completed this noon after the finest
display of Stanford spirit ever known,
and awaits the match which will trans
form it into a roaring furnace tonight.
Forty feet square and sixty feet high,
the pile stands as a monument to the
whole-hearted co-operation of practi
cally every member of the student
body, alumni, and business men of
Palo Alto, San Francisco, and San
Jose.
Work Starts Early
Plans for another fire started im
mediately by Bob Lewis at the im
promptu rally on the discovery of the
fire were functioning smoothly two
hours after the original pile was
ablaze. A special committee appointed
by President Lewis and headed by Bob
Titus went immediately to work, and
by noon huge piles of lumber were
ready for the workers.
Trucks donated by the Corporation
Yard and garages of Palo Alto hauled
the wood for the 200 men working on
the fire, and by 3 o'clock approximate
ly 15,000 feet of lumber had been col
lected.
Recess at 2 a.m.
Working in gangs of twelve men,
construction progressed rapidly and
smoothly under direction of the com
mittee, and not until 2 o'clock this
morning was work suspended, on ac
count of lack of wood. More trucks
were sent out and at 5 o'clock opera
tions were resumed and did not cease
until the pyre was completed.
Flood lights brought from the sta
dium furnished the light for the work
ers, while women from Roble and the
sororities kept them supplied with hot
coffee, cigarettes, and sandwiches. The
food was donated by Palo Alto mer
chants.
Four carloads of ties and lumber
were received at 7:30 this morning
from the Alumni Association of San
Francisco, San Jose, and South San
Francisco, while many private cash
donations were received. A sale of
bonfire benefit tickets at 10 cents
apiece in Palo Alto netted approxi
mately $150. Much of this money was
used to buy nails, wire, and supplies.
