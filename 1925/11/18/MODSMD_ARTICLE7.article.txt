# LARGE BLACK SNAKE FOUND IN BOX BY BONFIRE WORKERS
## 
### 
Fifty freshmen surrounding and on
top of the old bonfire were near-victims
of a six-foot snake which was discov
ered on top of the huge pyre. The
snake had remained concealed in a
banana crate which the members of the
class of 1929 had salvaged from a Palo
Alto merchant, unaware of the con
tents. When the crate had been hoisted
to the top of the bonfire by means of
the human ladder, the snake crawled
from its hiding place confronting the
freshmen who were working on top.
Colin R. Cary, a junior living in Se
quoia, was attracted by the furor
created by the reptile's appearance, and
twined the snake about a stick. He
carried it to Sequoia, where it was
todded to the collection of Gregory M.
Kranzthor, who is keeping his latest
specimen in the same room with several
other much smaller reptiles, toads, and
lizards.
