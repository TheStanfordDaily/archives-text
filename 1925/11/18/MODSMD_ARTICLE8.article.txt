# WOMEN SPEAKERS CANCEL DEBATE MEETING
## President Campbell Objects to Subject of Contest with Stanford 
### 
The Stanford-California women's de
bate, scheduled for last evening, was
called off late yesterday afternoon out
of courtesy to the California debaters,
following President Campbell's objec
tions to the subject: "Resolved, That
the family as an institution is unne
cessary to the progress of civilization."
Kathleen Woodward, chairman of
the California-Stanford debate com
mittee, said in relation to its stand:
"The committees and debaters of the
Stanford-California women's debate,
out of courtesy to the visiting team,
called off the debate which was to
have been held here last evening.
"President Wilbur received a tele
gram from President Campbell yes
terday afternoon stating that on ac
count of his disapproval of the subject
of the Stanford-California debate, he
had cancelled permission to have the
second debate on that subject held in
any university building. This debate
was to have taken place on Thursday,
at Berkeley.
"Stanford University did not forbid
the debate here, but the women of the
committee and the team did not wish
to put their visitors in the embarrass
ing position of debating on a subject
which had been declared by their presi
president to be against the interests
of their university.
"It is to be deeply regretted that
President Campbell did not voice his
objections at an earlier date, the sub
ject of the debate having been an
nounced over a month ago."
