# LIMITED NUMBER OF SHOW TICKETS MADE AVAILABLE
## Nolan Returns to Campus Stage in Production of Football Gaieties 
### 
Announcement was made this morn- j
ing from the Dramatfc Manager's of- j
fice that there would be a few seats
available for the "Big Game Gaieties,"
the football show of 11)25, which will
be produced in the Assembly hall to- j
morrow evening at 8:15 o'clock.
As the whole house for the show j
was sold out the day following the
seat sale, the securing of these seats j
for members of the student body was I
unexpected. The tickets were turned
in by several alumni groups which
found that they would be unable to be j
present.
With the "Big Game Gaieties," Lloyd j
Nolan, former campus favorite, makes ;
a return appearance on the Stanford j
stage. He will appear in several roles, j
including a part in one of the featured j
parody skits.
Nolan made his debut in campus j
dramatics when he was a freshman in
his performance in "The Hottentot" in j
1923. His next appearance was in the
leading role in "Captain Applejack." i
He also took part in "So This Is Eden," j
the 1925 Junior Opera. During the |
past year Nolan has been with Arnold j
Bailey, former Stanford man, on the j
professional vaudeville stage.
Music for the show includes numbers j
especially composed for this produc- j
tion. The opening number is a one- j
step written by John L. Wiggin, with |
lyrics by Gregory Williamson.
The new football song written by ;
Jean Wakefield wit,h words by Gregory ;
Williamson will be introduced by Ir
ving Anschutz and the chorus, which
will execute novel formations under
the direction of Chrysella Dunker. j

Chariot's Revue, will be given by Dor-!
othy Dahler, assisted by the chorus. |
