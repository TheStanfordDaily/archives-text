# Burt Lapp Leads Cardinal Supporters in Yells For Varsity
## 
### Fred Hines 
"If you rooters support this team
Saturday with the enthusiasm you
have shown tonight, Stanford WILL
WIN!"
This sentiment sounds the keynote
of the entire Big Game Rally held last j
night when 12,000 people gathered in
the stadium to hear Cardinal rooters
make the Gold and Blue tremble with
the roar of yells and the triumphant j
surge of songs.
Following tliis spectacular display
of Stanford spirit before the largest
crowd that ever attended a Big Game 1
Rally, the frenzied rooters serpentined j
around the giant rebuilt funeral pyre j
of the Golden Bear while forked flames
shot high into the air.
Led by the Stanford Band in full
uniform, a howling, shouting, shooting j
army of rooters began its winding i
march from the postoffice to the sta- <
dium at 7 o'clock. It finally made its j
way up the side of the great bowl and i
down into the central rooting section. I
After a few skyrockets for the team .
and a group of Stanford songs, led by ,
Burt Lapp and assistant cheer-leaders, |
Bob Fraser and Jimmy Farr, the band j
appeared at the far end of the track, j
Then the Stanford axe, blood-red of j
color and keen of edge, was borne in
by the members of Scalpers.
"Little Red Riding-Hood," a six-act j
skit portraying the results of the Cardi
nal football season, was presented by
Ram's Head. Little Red Riding-Hood,
representing the Stanford varsity and
played by Delmer Daves, successfully
defeats the Trojan war-horse, but goes
home in a barrel after meeting a big
rough Husky. The big California Bear
is found out when he tries to imper
sonate Grandma Alumni, and Little
Red Riding-Hood brings the Big Game
safely home in her market basket. The
skit was written by Mike Ely and
Henry Mack and directed by Dave
Mannoccir. i
The entrance of the varsity' squad
and coaching staff was the signal for j
a prolonged burst of noisy football fer- j
vor, dying out only when the team
had filed down the inside of the bowl |
to their seats. Then followed the j
speeches, reproduced by loudspeakers;
so that everyone in the assembled j
crowd could hear what was said. Andy j
Kerr, after his talk, introduced indi- !
vidually the members of the squad j
who all received enthusiastic ovations. I

After a few skyrockets for the team .
and a group of Stanford songs, led by ,
Burt Lapp and assistant cheer-leaders, |
Bob Fraser and Jimmy Farr, the band j
appeared at the far end of the track, j
Then the Stanford axe, blood-red of j
color and keen of edge, was borne in
by the members of Scalpers.
"Little Red Riding-Hood," a six-act j
skit portraying the results of the Cardi
nal football season, was presented by
Ram's Head. Little Red Riding-Hood,
representing the Stanford varsity and
played by Delmer Daves, successfully
defeats the Trojan war-horse, but goes
home in a barrel after meeting a big
rough Husky. The big California Bear
is found out when he tries to imper
sonate Grandma Alumni, and Little
Red Riding-Hood brings the Big Game
safely home in her market basket. The
skit was written by Mike Ely and
Henry Mack and directed by Dave
Mannoccir. i
The entrance of the varsity' squad
and coaching staff was the signal for j
a prolonged burst of noisy football fer- j
vor, dying out only when the team
had filed down the inside of the bowl |
to their seats. Then followed the j
speeches, reproduced by loudspeakers;
so that everyone in the assembled j
crowd could hear what was said. Andy j
Kerr, after his talk, introduced indi- !
vidually the members of the squad j
who all received enthusiastic ovations. I
"If you rooters support this team
Saturday with the enthusiasm you
have shown tonight, Stanford WILL
WIN!"
This sentiment sounds the keynote
of the entire Big Game Rally held last j
night when 12,000 people gathered in
the stadium to hear Cardinal rooters
make the Gold and Blue tremble with
the roar of yells and the triumphant j
surge of songs.
Following tliis spectacular display
of Stanford spirit before the largest
crowd that ever attended a Big Game 1
Rally, the frenzied rooters serpentined j
around the giant rebuilt funeral pyre j
of the Golden Bear while forked flames
shot high into the air.
Led by the Stanford Band in full
uniform, a howling, shouting, shooting j
army of rooters began its winding i
march from the postoffice to the sta- <
dium at 7 o'clock. It finally made its j
way up the side of the great bowl and i
down into the central rooting section. I
