# ALUMNUS HAS HARD LUCK; GETS WRONG TICKETS FOR GAME
## 
### 
Hard luck attends a prominent
alumnus who finds himself without
any tickets to the Big Game which
he discovered not to be what he
thought they were.
Several weeks ago, he received
blanks for both the U. S. C. game
and (he Big Game. A mistake made
by his secretary in mailing the
blanks resulted in his getting TT. S.
C. tickets when he expected paste
boards for the Stanford-California
game. He discovered his mistake
only a few days ago when he was
examining the tickets to find out,
the location of the seats. His be
lated application could not be
filled, due to the scarcity of seats.
