# HARTRANFT'S DISCUS THROW OFFICIALLY CREDITED BY A. A. U.
## 
### 
Glenn "Tiny" Hartranft, Stan
ford's 1924 track captain and star
weight man and sprinter, has been
officially recognized as the World's
Champion discus thrower by the
Amateur Athletic Union. Hartranft's
mark of 157 feet, 1 5-8 inches was
made in the Ivezar Memorial Sta
dium, San Francisco, May 2, 1925,
but was not officially recognized
until the annual meeting of the A.
A. U. last week.
Hartranft, competing in one of
his last meets under Cardinal col
ors, broke the mark of his great
rival, Bud Houser of U. S. C., which
had been made one week previous
to Tiny's record. Houser had sur
passed a mark of 156 feet 1 3-8
inches made by James Duncan in
1912. This was the second time that
Hartranft threw the discus over 156
feet, the first occasion being in the
I. C. A. A. A. A. meet two years
ago when he made a toss of 158
feet. This mark was not officially
recognized as Hartranft threw with
the wind behind him.
