# DIXON'S ABSENCE SERIOUSLY WEAKENS SMITH'S BACKFIELD
## Coaches Will Probably Use Blewett at Quarter, Perrin at Half 
### Wilbur Adams 
With Jimmy Dixon definitely out of
the Big Game lineup, Andy Smith is
busy picking a substitute to take the
' place of the California star. Dixon re
ceived an injury in the first five min
utes of the Washington game last Sat
urday, but it was thought at the first
' of the week that he would be in con
dition for the Big Game.
Dixon was the one punter on the
i Blue and Gold squad that could bo
relied upon, and the loss of him will
be keenly felt. To fill his place Smith
has Dick Blewett, who can get dis
-1 tance in his kicks but he can not placo
I them. Blewett is a quarterback, so if
he is used, Scoop Carlson will be on
| the bench. For the halfback job Perrin
is the most logical man. Perrin gradu
j ated from the 1928 freshman eleven,
j and is therefore playing his first year
on the varsity. He carries the ball
fairly well, but his passing does not
compare with that of Dixon.
Either Jabs or Young is slated to
start at fullback for the Bears. Jaba
I has been playing more consistently
this season, and the start of the game
will probably see him in the lineup.
There is Griffin" to be considered, too.
Griffin showed more real football in
the Big Game last year than any other
of the California varsity players. Smith
will not decide until the last minute
before the contest who will start.
Statistics show that Griffin made
more than his share of yards against
the Husky crew, and it proves that ho
is too valuable a man to keep on the
bench. Jabs hit the Washington line
for a gain of sixty-eight yards during
the game, while he was only charged
with losing one yard during the after
noon. Tesreau, the Washington cap
; tain and outstanding star, was only
! credited with forty-nine yards through
i out the entire contest, and twenty-five
of these were made in his famous run
j to the touchdown in the last few ruin
: utes of play.
California boasts of the strongest
j line on the Pacific Coast, and Dana
Carey is the biggest and best player
in this forward wall. At the pivot posi
tion is Miller, who has done remark
ably well for his first year on the
varsity. The guard opposite to Carey
! is Couper, and the tackles are Sargent
and Coltrin. This line, with the excep
j lion of Miller, all saw action last No
j vember in the Big Game at Berkeley.
The only change that looks likely
I in the Stanford lineup is the possibil
, ity of Raffetto starting at right tackle
j in the place of Harris. Harris is still
limping, and Raffetto was playing with
j the first team in the last practice yes-
I terday afternoon.
