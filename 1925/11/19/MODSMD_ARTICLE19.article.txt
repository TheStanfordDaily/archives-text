ral put out in over two years will make

Game number goes on sale. Sixty pages

a month's effort composes the issue.
The "Old Boy" swears in solemn oath,
"we positively guarantee even the
Sphinz itself at least one hearty
laugh."
Ted Van Deusen, formerly assistant
art editor of Chappy, now a member of
the art staff of the San Francisco Call,
has drawn an unusually clever comic
cover for the number, printed in four
colors. The main art piece of the maga
zine is a two-page sketch done by H.
C. Bickerton. This is the first center
spread that has appeared in Chaparral
for several years. Van King, the art
editor, has contributed a striking foot
ball action for the frontispiece. Fresh
