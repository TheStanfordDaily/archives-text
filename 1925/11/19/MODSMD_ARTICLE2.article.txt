# GOLF SQUAD LOSES THREE PLAYERS FOR CALIFORNIA MATCH
## 
### 
Three of the star performers of the
Stanford golf team have been declared
ineligible and will consequently be un
able to play in the California match
which is scheduled for a week from
Saturday.
Eddie Meyberg and Hob Vermilya,
who have been playing third and
fourth on the varsity, cannot play in
Conference matches until next quar
ter. The rules forbid a man to play
in the California match until he has
completed three quarters in the Uni
versity, and both Meyberg and Ver
milya, though members of last year's
freshman team, have not completed
the prescribed three quarters at Stan
ford. Neil Miller, a junior transfer from
the University of Southern California,
who has been playing fifth man, was
also made ineligible by this ruling. Mil
ler will be unable to play until next
autumn quarter.
Stanford's chances of winning the
California match have been severely
damaged by the loss of these men.
However, Tom Condit, Stanford golf
manager, has written California au
thorities ip an effort to have the match
postponed until next quarter. Should
Condit's suggestion be accepted, Stan
ford will have better than an even
break to carry off the honors of the
day.
