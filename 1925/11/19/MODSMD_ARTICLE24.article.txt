# The 						Big Game Rally
## 
### 
On at least one occasion every year the cheer leaders do not have diffi
culty in packing the rooting section, nor in forcing the assemblage to yell.
That occasion is the Big Game Rally—and proof of the first statement can
be obtained from any witness of the Rally last night.
The Big Game Rally is always one of the things that is remembered in
after years. Students who have never been affected in any way by Stan
ford and things Stanford cannot come away from the rally holders of
such records. The feeling is general that relaxation is necessary. After
the rally reserves are let down, pent up enthusiasm is released, and as a
consquence a lot of noise is made, everybody feels foolishly happy and
worries are over for the day. Ihe Big Game Rally is a tonic that many an
old fogy would give his Sunday hat for to acquire in drugs. But it can't
be done. Asa matter of fact it is done at Stanford only once a year.
Why it is that a football team should not get just as much support dur
ing the early part of the season as in the last is hard to figure out, but such
seems to be the case. Spirit, enthusiasm, college rah-rah, artd what not
were all universally predominant last night. An unsurpassed bonfire sent
flames high into the air, to run the gamut from glitter to glow, and then to
die—but the Stanford spirit has not expired with it. Saturday it is going
to be a factor—and as Andy Kerr said "It may be one of the turning
points for a Stanford victory." *
