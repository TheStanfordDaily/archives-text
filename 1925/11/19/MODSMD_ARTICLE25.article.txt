# Disappearing Books
## 
### 
A casual observer suggested to the Daily Palo Alto this morning
that he had seen hundreds of library books hidden away in corners and
shelves of campus fraternity houses and halls. Upon reflection, every
student can remember having seen discarded library books lying around
in places from which they will never be moved unless some sort of con
centrated effort is made.
This carrying away of library books is needless and appalling in its
wastefulness. A student takes a book home from the library. It is a dry
text which he never cares to read again after he has done his assignment.
So he prepares his lesson and tosses the book into a corner. A few months
later it is covered with dust and cobwebs. He has lost interest in it, and
the book lies useless and forgotten. But—the following quarter that book
is very necessary for the men who are taking the same course, lhey must
have it for their work. To meet the need the University is forced to re
place the lost text. The result is additional expense, which contributes its
part to high fees at registration time.
Why cannot a campaign be started to clean out fraternity houses and
halls and return the library books found therein? If an underclassman
were detailed to search through every cubbyhole in his particular house for
library books, the Daily is sure that his efforts would produce quantities |
of lx>oks taken far back and long since forgotten. And the library really i
needs these books returned.
The Daily Palo Alto suggests that presidents of organizations con-;
sider this matter and appoint an underclassman to search out the forgotten
library books and return them to the University.
