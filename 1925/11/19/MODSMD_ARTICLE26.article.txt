# Hopes for a New Award Plan
## 
### 
A second attempt is under way to devise a plan whereby awards for par
ticipation in athletics can be made upon a basis satisfactory to athletes,
coaches, and faculty members. An elaborate scheme was presented last
year by a group appointed for the purpose by the Executive Committee,
and was voted down by a narrow margin at the student body election last
May. Some change in the present mode would prove of decided benefit to
everyone concerned, but it is going to take a lot of hard work on the part j
of the committee before such a scheme is evolved.
The failure of the committee last year should serve as a guide to the
present organization. Analysis of the plans working in other large uni
versities throughout the country might also prove of value. The commit
tee must realize that it has a job of gigantic proportions before it, and one
which will not be easily completed. The student body will watch with in
terest its progress during the next few months.
