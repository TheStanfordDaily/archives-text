# CAMPUS OPINION

The Editor, Sir:
If "T, '25" had his way as outlined
in his viewpoint of November 12, Stan
ford would cease to be a college in a
red-blooded sense of the word.
It seems that "T, '25" is a member
of our time-honored "dry bawl" group,
and though he is utterly right from
the point of view of the person who
sees nothing more to college than
books, he is totally wrong from the
standpoint of the average college man.
He will ask what is the average col
lege man and what are his ideas?
Well, as I see it, the average college
man is one who is capable of getting
at least 50 per cent of his education
from other things than books. The
books merely serve as a balancing fac
tor with life on the other side of the
scale.
Under the "life" I should include
sports, interest in one's fellows, study
of human nature, and the ability to
"face-up" with the practical world at
large.
The unshaven face and dirty cords
are irrelevant matters. I cannot feel
either, that they were marks of the
Stanford spirit. Since the intelligence
tests have been instituted, Stanford
obtains the upper 20 per cent of high
school brain power, according to our
own eminent Professor Terman. This
should account for the increased ex
cellence of freshman scholarship.
Rallies do not come very often!
Sports are surely not overdone to the
detriment of scholarship in general.
If a man has an "ex" the day after a
rally, let us excuse him, or if he is in
a tight box scholastically, let him
study, but let us condemn the slacker
who shuffles cards or supports the
movie shows, instead of his alma
mater.
So far as sophomore discipline is
concerned, I can only repeat that un
less something can be found to sup
plant it as a medium of uniting the
student body, it must return. There
is nothing more valuable to the devel
opment of the practical side of the
man; the side which must soon fight
the world, than college life, and sopho
more control supplies a lot of that
life. It is fun at the time, and of bene
fit after, and for proof it is only neces
sary to refer to the alumni of years
gone by. A large percentage of them
would not give up their experiences
under the old regime for a whole vol
ume of Ph.D.'s. —F. B., '26.
The Editor, Sir:
In spite of the fact that a large num-
ber of our women are so bold as to
speak to men in their classes without
being formally introduced, there has
been a lot of kicking about the few
land-going icebergs that do not. The
way our women took hold and made
things pleasant for the bonfire work
ers more than makes up for the snob
bishness of the few. We should be
proud of their splendid spirit. Let's
key down on the razzing and do our
best to build up the fine spirit of co-
operation now being shown.
—R. M., '28.
