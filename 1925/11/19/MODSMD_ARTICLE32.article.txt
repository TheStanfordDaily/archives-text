# DAY'S DOINGS

<9 Ted Elias, Jr. $
Cinders of the Big Game Fire
Colored red the evening sky;
Cardinal must wave triumphant,
California's hope will die.
Dixon of the Californians
Will not start on Saturday;
Don't get over-confident,
Because we've still the game to play.
Nevers and his little playmates,
From the campus disappear,
Resting for the contest that
Will culminate the football year.
Big Game number of the Chappie
Will be placed on sale tomorrow;
Give the ladies thirty cents,
And drive away your cares and sorrow.
