# MODERN PLAYS BEST IN NATION'S HISTORY SAYS DR. H. D. GRAY

"It seems very odd to me that so
prominent and up-to-date an actor as
Emmett Corrigan, playing in so mod
ern and outstanding a play as 'What
Price Glory,' should go back to the cry
of the 'good old days,'" said Dr. Henry
D. Gray, of the English department, in
an interview recently, concerning Cor
rigan's pessimistic expression regard
ing his belief in the alarming retro
gression of the theatre in the last
twenty-five years.
"As a matter of fact I believe that
the plays of today are without ques
tion far better than anything in the
history of the United States," said Dr.
Gray. "Not until Eugene O'Neill ap
peared did America have a dramatist
of the first class. With his entrance
into the theatre and the advent of
playwrights after his style and actors
like Corrigan, naturalism has come in
and has enlarged the sphere of the
American stage.
"For Corrigan to say that the act
ing of today is not an improvement
over that of twenty-five years ago can
be only modesty, it seems to me. At
that time the older actors were fast
going, and those of Corrigan's type
were taking their places. Even then
there was the cry that 'things are not
as they were —twenty-five years ago.'
It has already been said, and I sup
pose it always will be," Dr. Gray con
tinued.
"In spite of certain limitations 'What
Price Glory' is a very worthwhile and
significant piece of work, and in the
role of Captain Flagg, Corrigan gives
a fine, sustained, and most convincing
performance. Only a very few things
in the New York twenty-five years ago
can be compared with his role, and in
general, acting today compares very
well with the acting of that time," con
cluded Dr. Gray.
