j The Editor, Sir:
What is meant by "Stanford spirit?"
i Assuming that here, as in most col
leges, the main interests of students
| are athletics and other things, the for
mer is easily disposed of by mention
ing actual playing, rooting, and rallies.
Hut how about the other subjects men
j tioned in communications such as
sophomore discipline, cords, dinks,
queening, and law steps? Harmless as
these customs are, do they contribute
anything to happiness or character
building either as student or alumnus,
or do they help Stanford?
Perhaps I am wrong, but it does
seem that this interpretation is based
' upon turning out a standardized prod
! uce, so many a year, all alike as far
as human ingenuity is possible, and the
! results enjoyed most of all by the out
side onlookers. A double quick-step
; greeting of a Harold Lloyd may make
j a college tradition and to that extent
: give a college individuality, but is that
j what Stanford men and women want?
The choice, after all, is between the
practices of fresh-water colleges like
Old Siwash and established institu
tions such as Harvard and Yale where
hazing and magnified class distinc
tions are history rather than tradi
tions.
Is Stanford spirit the same thing as
Stanford traditions? The reason I ask
is that I am not a Stanford graduate.
The usual experience is that the indi
vidualistic student is the one who is
most likely to bring greatest renown
to his alma mater. In my college class
which graduated fifteen years ago, the
outstanding men are President Little
of the University of Michigan, Walter
Lippman, author and chief editorial
writer of the New York World, John
Reed, buried under the Kremlin, and
! Alan Seager, who wrote "I Have a
Rendezvous with Death." All these
men, as students, were considered
largely non-conformists. And isn't the
! greatest Stanford tradition, "Let the
j winds of freedom blow?"
