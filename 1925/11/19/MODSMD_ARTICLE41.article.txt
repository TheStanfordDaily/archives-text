# TWENTY YEARS AGO

Next Saturday will be the day of the
annual all-University track meet, and
already final preparations are being
made for the contest. Entry blanks are
posted in the training sheds, and from
present indications there will be plenty
of competitors in every event. This
meet is of particular importance to the
trainer and the captain, as it affords
them the first opportunity of sizing up
the new material.

A large number of Stanford Clubs
throughout the United States held re
unions last Saturday evening. Manager
Barrett had received more than twenty
messages by Friday night asking him
to wire results of the game in the
middle and at the end of each half.

Conservative estimates place the at
tendance at the Big Game Saturday
at close to 12,000. The total receipts
will probably amount to more than
$24,000. Stanford and the University
of California, after deducting a mutual
expense of about $500, will each re
ceive something over $11,000 from the
game.

The University Athletic Committee
will meet tomorrow night to award
varsity emblems to the thirteen men
who represented Stanford in the game
last Saturday. The question of voting
letters for second team men and substi
tutes who were on the sidelines in the
California game will also be taken up.
