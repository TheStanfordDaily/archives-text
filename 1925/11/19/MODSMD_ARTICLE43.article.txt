# ALUMNI MAGAZINE OFFERS SCHOLARSHIP FOR SECOND TIME
## 
### 
The Stanford Illustrated Review will
again offer an award of a $225 scholar
ship to be given to the winner of a
block S in 1925-26, who in the opinion
of the committee designated makes
the highest record in combined scholar
ship and general contribution to the
life of the University.
Ernie Nevers was given this award
last year. It was awarded to Nevers
tor prominence in football, baseball,
and basketball, and for maintaining
at the same time a scholarship grade
among the highest held by winners of
the varsity S.
The Stanford Illustrated Review pre
sents this award in recognition of the
spirit and achievement of those ath
letes who have kept a high level of
scholarship in spite of the handicap
imposed by the strenuous athletic sea
son. It generally true that the men
who represent Stanford in intercolle
giate sports are also representative of
the best type of Stanford man, in that
they combine supremacy in athletics
with a good grade in scholarship and
participation in the work of the Uni
versity community.
This award will be given in May,
1926, by President Wilbur, upon recom
mendation of a committee consisting
of the Dean of Men, the Graduate
Manager, and the Business Manager
of the Illustrated Review.
