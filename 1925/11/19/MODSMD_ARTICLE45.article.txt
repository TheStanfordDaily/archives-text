# Rally Committee Issues Directions for Rooters
## 
### 
Promptly at 2 o'clock Saturday the
Stanford band will march into the sta
dium, and at the same time the rally
committee intends to call for the first
stunt of the day. The committee,
therefore, requests that all rooters be
in their seats and organized by 1:30
o'clock.
Every rooter must wear a white;
shirt, a bow tie, and a rooter's hat.
i
Preferably the tie should be red. Each
seat is marked with an instruction i
card, and to get the best results in
the stunts each person in the rooting
section must sit over one card.
These colored cards must not be
touched until directions are given by
Burt Lapp; then care must be taken
not to mix the cards. The proper pro
cedure is for the rooters to put the
cards on their laps, when told to do
so, and use them in the proper order.
Blue felt "collegiate" hats are being
"worn by the freshman women <jf the I
University of Kansas. The hats must i
be worn until Christmas.
