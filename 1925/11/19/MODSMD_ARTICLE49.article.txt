## Do They Mix? 
### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Do football and baseball mix? Can one man star in both sports? Undoubt
edly yes, and to prove it one needs ony to recall the long list of fine college
football players who have also been stars on the diamond for their Alma
Mater. Eddie Mahan, "Tack" Harwick, Charlie Brickley, and George Owen,
of Harvard; Alonzo Stagg, Tad Jones, Ted Coy, Harry Le Gore, Bill Mallory,
and Mac Aldrich, of Yale; Jim Cooney and Sam White, of Princeton; Ralnh
Glaze, of Dartmouth; "Dave" Fultz, of Brown; "Orvie" Overall, captain of both
the football and baseball teams of California; Nevers, of Stanford; and scores
of others.
But for some reason or other, perhaps because they are signed up for the
majors mostly on their football reputations, or because the wear and tear of
the gridiron has incapacitated them for first-class baseball, football stars do
not as a rule shine in the majors. Jim Thorpe was probably the best football
player of all time. He was a great drawing card when McGraw first signed
him with the Giants, but spent most of his time warming the bench. He
might have been a big league star if he had more chances to play.
Haines and Killinger, of Penn State; Workman and Harley, of Ohio State;
and Mohardt and Castner, of Notre Dame, all failed as major leaguers. But
on the other hand Mathewson, Frisch, Collins, Overall, and other college
football heroes all made fine records as professional baseball players. Joe
and Luke Sewell of the Cleveland Indians played football for the Unfversity
of Alabama, Lou Gehrig of the Yankees played at Columbia, and there are
many others, too.
Football and baseball do mix!
