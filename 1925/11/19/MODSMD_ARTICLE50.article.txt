### Herbert Klein 
"Largo" from Dvorak's "New World"
Symphony will be played by Warren D.
Allen in the Memorial Church at 4
o'clock Sunday afternoon.
Anton Dvorak was the greatest com
poser of the Bohemian school. He
lived in America for several years and
when he returned to Bohemia gave
the world his greatest work, the fifth
symphony, dedicated to America and
called "From the New World." In this
symphony he used melodies charac
teristic of America.
The "Largo" is the slow movement
of this symphony and is strongly sug
gestive of the negro spirituals. It has
been said that Dvorak borrowed actual
negro melodies for the symphony, but ]
in reality he composed them' entirely
himself in the spirit of the negro mu- J
sic. Dvorak is a great master of folk j
music in all its forms and used it con
tinually.
"Carillon," or bell song, by Jan Si
belius, will be played. Sibelius is a
Finn, and the most unique figure in
the music of the North of today. He is
intensely nationalistic in his composi
tions and in his great tone poems has
introduced the legends, folk-lore, and
music of Finland. "Carillon" was writ
ten for the bells of the church of Berg
hall, a suburb of Helsingfors, Finland.
The great master of organ music,
Johann Sebastian Bach, will be repre
sented by two of the Lutheran

] hymn, "To God Alone on High Be!
Praise," The settings are both in
Bach's characteristic style of chorale
preludes. One is "Lento Maesto," and
, the other "Allegretto Grazioso."
A suspension of one month was
given the editor of the college weekly,
1 "The Tripod," of Trinity College, Hart
ford, Connecticut, for publishing a
criticism of an address of the dean,
given in chapel,
Charlie Prior, Lehigh University
I quarterback, died recently as a result
of injuries received in a game.
