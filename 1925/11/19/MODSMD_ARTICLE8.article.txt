# BIG GAME RALLY CREMATES BRUIN CHANCES OF VICTORY
## Speakers Favor Stanford's Chances of Defeating California 
### 
That Stanford has its greatest
I chance to defeat the Golden Bear this
year was the keynote of the short
speeches delivered at the rally last
night by Jack Patrick, Pop Warner,
Captain Ernie Nevers, Andy Kerr, and
Derrol Chase, president of the San
Jose alumni.
It took Ernie Nevers only a minute
i to tell the assembled thousands what
' he thought of the game next Saturday.
! "It's been twenty years since Stanford
i has won a game of American football
1 from California. They tell me history
i repeats itself. Well, history is going to
'repeat itself!"
Coach Pop Warner paid tribute to
j the spirit of the Stanford varsity, and
j to the ability and personality of its
I captain.. "In all my thirty years of
i coaching experience I have never
I seen a greater player than our captain,
j And I will also say I have never
known a finer fellow. That team is not
| only going out to fight for Stanford
i but for the finest captain who ever put
; on a football suit. We realize Califor
■ nia has a great team. I have utmost
| confidence in the boys, that they will
I play their best game this year, and if
' | they do, I feel that is good enough to
j win.
I "Today lam firmly convinced that
the Stanford team is every bit as good
as California in power, versatility, and
i offense. Ernie Nevers is playing his
: last game for Stanford, and in spite of
* his injuries he will play the best game
| he ever played."
"If you can charge this team with
the enthusiasm that means they can't
lose, they won't lose," said Coach Andy
| Kerr.
The first speaker was Jack Patrick,
1 fullback on this year's Olympic Club
•jteam and captain of the Stanford var
isity in 1921. "I am deeply impressed,"
he said, "by the spirit of the team this
1 ! year—a spirit no other Stanford team
! has ever had. I think Stanford lias
more reserve strength than California.
1 \ It's the reserve power that's going to
| win, but we can beat them anyway. If
1 every Stanford man and woman sup
-1 ports the team Saturday as they have
; done today, they will come out of the
• stadium smiling."
Summing up the impressions of the
! other speakers in the sentence, "I be
lieve this team has the greatest poten
tial power o£ any team in America,"
Derrol Chase, president of the San
J Jose Alumni, finished out the speeches.
