Buster Keaton
in
"GO WEST"
A Great Comedy of
the Wide-Open Spaces
You said Buster couldn't possibly
be funnier than in "The Navi
gator" and "Seven Chances." It
couldn't happen. Well, it HAS
happened. Never has he packed
more laughs and excitement to
the second than in his greatest
film, "Go West."
With Brown Eyes, the first cow
ever to be starred in the films.
