you see the collection of gifts we have assembled for your choosing,
fefvjL. your heart will go out to them instantly. And when you come to their
actual purchase, you will have no cause for regret —for realizing that
one's purse is never large enough to accommodate all the demands
\ \ made upon it, we have placed a very modest price-tag on all these
0r lovely holiday presents. You will find them happy gifts from both
your s —and the recipient's—standpoint.
