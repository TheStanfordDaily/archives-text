# HARVARD, YALE WILL MEET TOMORROW IN EASTERN GRID GAME
## 
### 
While Pacific Coast fans will cen
ter their attention tomorrow on the
Stanford-California battle, Harvard
and Yale, time-honored rivals, will
occupy a similar position in the
East, although no championship, not
even that of the "Big Three," is at
slake.
The Eli eleven is favored to win
by a wide margin, but the Crimson
always plays its best game against
the Blue. Yale, beaten by Pennsyl
vania in a close game, and then
defeated lafit week by a rejuvenated
Princeton eleven, is out to win back
some of a lost prestige. But the
power it showed against the Army
and Brown make it the favorite.
Harvard has so far had a disas
trous season with an almost com
plete record of defeats. Dartmouth
rolled up a big score against the
Massachusetts squad, and Prince
ton, through the stellar work of
Jake Slagle, star halfback, rolled up
36 points to 0 for Harvard.
