## 
### 
The soccer championship between
Stanford and the University of Cali
fornia will be decided here tomorrow
morning when the varsities of the two
schools meet on the stadium field at
10 o'clock. At the same time the fresh
man teams of both schools will play
their last game of the season on the
practice field of the Stanford football
varsity.
Last Saturday, with the odds heavily
against them, the Card soccer varsity
| won a hard game from California by
j the close score of 2 to 1. The Bruins
i started the game with a rush and soon ;
1 had a goal in their favor, but the score :
was immediately evened when Schoen, i
j Card outside left, placed a well-aimed j
; kick into the California net. The re-
I mainder of the game was evenly j
■ t'ought, but in the second quarter j
! Miron scored the winning goal on a 1
penalty kick awarded Stanford because '
the California fullback handled the I
ball. The entire team played excellent
I ball but Schoen with his clever kicks,'
! and Gray with his crafty goal-blocking,
were the stars of the day.
This was the first defeat of the
I strong California team this season and
; drops them into a tie with the Olym
pic Club for first place in the Univer
sity and Club League.
The team has been in steady prac
tice every afternoon this week, per
fecting a stronger offense to carry the
play into the opponents' ground.
Skinned knees, bruised calves, and !
twisted ankles have healed and Jack
Franklin, captain and center half, de
clares that all even men are in per
fect condition for a hard game.
For the last three years the two
game series with the Bears resulted
in a tie. Stanford now has a decided
advantage on this series and the team j
hopes for a win tomorrow to give them
the victory so long delayed.
One week ago the freshman team i
played a close game with their Cali- j
i fornia rivals but lost 1 to 2. Before
! the Bear game, the Stanford frosh
had played a loose game with poor
co-ordination and teamwork. In the
California contest they played close
| ball, but the slightly superior team
! work of the Blue and Gold vanquished
them in the end. Two weeks of hard
j practice has worked out most of the j
1 rough spots in co-ordinate team play,
; so tomorrow a powerful and smooth
working combination will take the field
in an effort to tie the series with a
win.
The following is the varsity line-up:
Miron, 0.r.; Bailard, i.r.; Schoen, o.l.; 1
Quigley, 1.1.; Cannon, 1.1 i.; Bushnell,
ir.h.; Franklin (c), c.h.; Strowger, c.f.;

Last Saturday, with the odds heavily
against them, the Card soccer varsity
| won a hard game from California by
j the close score of 2 to 1. The Bruins
i started the game with a rush and soon ;
1 had a goal in their favor, but the score :
was immediately evened when Schoen, i
j Card outside left, placed a well-aimed j
; kick into the California net. The re-
I mainder of the game was evenly j
■ t'ought, but in the second quarter j
! Miron scored the winning goal on a 1
penalty kick awarded Stanford because '
the California fullback handled the I
ball. The entire team played excellent
I ball but Schoen with his clever kicks,'
! and Gray with his crafty goal-blocking,
were the stars of the day.
This was the first defeat of the
I strong California team this season and
; drops them into a tie with the Olym
pic Club for first place in the Univer
sity and Club League.
The team has been in steady prac
tice every afternoon this week, per
fecting a stronger offense to carry the
play into the opponents' ground.
Skinned knees, bruised calves, and !
twisted ankles have healed and Jack
Franklin, captain and center half, de
clares that all even men are in per
fect condition for a hard game.
For the last three years the two
game series with the Bears resulted
in a tie. Stanford now has a decided
advantage on this series and the team j
hopes for a win tomorrow to give them
the victory so long delayed.
One week ago the freshman team i
played a close game with their Cali- j
i fornia rivals but lost 1 to 2. Before
! the Bear game, the Stanford frosh
had played a loose game with poor
co-ordination and teamwork. In the
California contest they played close
| ball, but the slightly superior team
! work of the Blue and Gold vanquished
them in the end. Two weeks of hard
j practice has worked out most of the j
1 rough spots in co-ordinate team play,
; so tomorrow a powerful and smooth
working combination will take the field
in an effort to tie the series with a
win.
The following is the varsity line-up:
Miron, 0.r.; Bailard, i.r.; Schoen, o.l.; 1
Quigley, 1.1.; Cannon, 1.1 i.; Bushnell,
ir.h.; Franklin (c), c.h.; Strowger, c.f.;
I Clark, r.f.; Ilolmes, 1.f.; Gray, goal.
