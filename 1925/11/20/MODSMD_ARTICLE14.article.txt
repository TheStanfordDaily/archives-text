# STANFORD PLAYERS HAVE BEST CHANCE TO WIN SINCE RETURN OF AMERICAN GRID SPORT
## Comparative Scores Point to Close Game; Card Injuries Factor 
### Wilbur Adams 
I'or the first time since American foot
ball was reinstated at the Palo Alto Uni
versity, Stanford enters a football game
against California as a slight favorite.
The Cards are not the under dogs, but
instead, are on top of the pile of dope
that has been stacked around this year's
Big Game. Stanford won her last game
of American football from California in
1905—just twenty years ago, and as
Nevers said, history should repeat itself
every twenty years.
But Stanford has no reason to feel
overly confident of a victory for in reality
they are just on a par with the Blue and
Gold. Comparative scores for the season
of 1925 do not show Stanford an out
standing favorite. Scores may even give
the Bears the edge. A prediction of a
victory for the Red comes from those
that have seen both the California and
the Stanford varsities in action this year.
Warner's men were credited with a much
better game against Washington although
the Huskies were able to score twice 011
the Cards and only once on the Bears.
Cards Erratic
At times during this season Stanford
has showed the best offense on the
Pacific coast, but in other contests War
ner's men looked weak on scoring. In
the U. S. C. battle, the Cards exhibited
a most spectacular defense which kept
the powerful Southern California backs
almost at a standstill. That the Red
shirts have played an erratic game, is not
denied by the strongest Stanford sup
porters. The type of play that Stanford
displays tomorrow will largely determine
whether they will turn back the boys
from Berkeley with another defeat to
their loss at the hands of Washington.
In previous years, the Big Game has
been the occasion for the Stanford play
ers to forget everything, with the ex
ception of football, and to play far over
their heads. But at the same time, this
battle has always called forth the best
efforts from the Blue and Gold players,
too. But a decided factor in Stanford's
favor is that, so far this year, Stanford's
best has been far better than the Bear's
most successful efforts.
Bears Defeated
Another point in the favor of the
Cardinal football men is the fact that
the Golden Bear has been soiled with
defeat twice this year. It is a psycholo
gical effect. The formerly undefeated
California Bears have been beaten by
both the Olympic Club and by the Uni
versity of Washington eleven, and the
path is cleared for Stanford to walk in
and hand the Bruins a third defeat.
Not since 1905 has Stanford thought it
was possible to beat the Bears, but it has
been actually proven this season that it
is possible and besides it is being done
this year.
As far as injuries are concerned, Stan
ford has the worst of it, for while Smith
has declared Dixon to be out of tomor
row's battle, Stanford is struggling along
with five cripples. Nevers, McCreery,
Armour, Harris and Poulson are on the
Cardinal crippled list. Poulson is certain
to be out of the game, and Harris is
likely to be kept from playing. Dougery,
one of California's end, may also be out
of the final battle, but he is a substitute
