# Forecast: A Red Day

### 
Today and tomorrow Stanford lives only for football. Studies and ex
aminations, parties and dances, petty discussions, fights, and political ar
guments all are forgotten as the momentous day of November 21 draws
near. Studies are dead. Football is king. Long live the king!
The eyes of the nation —even those of the world —are focused upon
the Stanford stadium, for word of what twenty-two men and their sub
stitutes will do tomorrow is being anxiously awaited by thousands of
alumni and millions of football fans. Seventy-five thousand people will
form the colorful crowd of fortunates who will see a team of well-trained
Alchemists enter the field to reverse the usual process and turn the Golden
Bear to dark and heavy lead. The cheers and shouts of the crowd will be
amplified all over the country by means of a radio broadcast station which
will enable millions to follow the struggle play by play.
Stanford is united and prepared to humble the Bruin on the field and
in the bleachers. Alumni for years past have forgotten business cares and
worries to return to the Farm and witness what must be the first Stanford
triumph since the return to American football.
This is Stanford's year. During the last decade the Cardinal has never
been given such a chance for victory. Referees who have worked with
both teams during the season declare the game a toss-up and refuse to men
tion a winner; professional followers of the sport find the odds an even
break; "Pop" Warner, hesitant as he is to boast of his own prowess as a
coach, feels that Stanford might possibly win. Others about the campus
are wagering their next month's checks that the Cards will come through.
The happening of the improbable alone can stop the Redshirts in their tri
umphant march to success.
This is the seventh year in which the Stanford footballers have hurled
themselves against the Blue and Gold in an effort to secure a victory. It
is the fourth year of the Warner system —a system which was.guaranteed
to bring victories to the Cardinal—and this is the year in which those wins
are beginning to assert themselves.
When American football was resumed at Stanford following the war,
athletics were at a low ebb. Three coaches in three successive years had
met with little success. Then Andy Kerr and ' 1 iny Ihornhill appeared
on the scene as forerunners of "Pop" Warner—the master mind of them
all—and his system. And with his advent the Cardinal has been coming
into its own.
The California "Wonder Team" of 1920 trampled over a weaker,
harder fighting Cardinal team and won 38 to 0. The next year a stronger
Bear team came to Stanford to dedicate the new stadium.
The supposedly weak Stanford squad charged so furiously that the
kickoff was fumbled and Stanford scored the first touchdown. The Bears
won 42 to 7—but by a narrower margin than the year before. And ever
since that time the margin of victory of the California squad has been
growing smaller—2B to o—9 to o—and then 20 to 20. The pendulum has
come down from its swing Califiorniaward. Last year it was at the base
of its stroke. Now it is going to swing toward Stanford. There is no
other alternative. The wheels of fortune are grinding slowly and surely—
but they are turning the victories toward the Farm.
Throughout the years of California victories the Stanford team has
stood out nobly in defeat. The Redshirts have always done more than the
wiseacres and critics said that they could do. When Stanford didn t have
an offense —they scored. When the Bears were going to win by a dozen
touchdowns —they were held to four. Such is the result of a fighting,
never-say-die spirit with which Stanford teams have always been instilled.
Whether the Stanford players win, lose, or draw they give all they have.
No man quite or shirks until he has exhausted every ounce of his strength
for the varsity.
When the odds have been hopelessly in favor of the enemy the Cardinal
has earned only praise for its efforts. Tomorrow with the odds even that
same Stanford spirit is going to end the Bruin string of victories and send
him back across the bay with a healthy respect of what brains, determina
tion, and Stanford fight can accomplish.
