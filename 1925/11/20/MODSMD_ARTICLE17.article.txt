# A 						Lesson for Scalpers
## 
### 
One Stanford junior has been indefinitely suspended. Two freshmen
have lost ticket privileges at future Big Games. An attempt to scalp
tickets to the Stanford-California battle furnishes the reason for this
punishment, which was meted out yesterday by the Men's Council.
This is just another example that crime doesn't pay. The conditions
under which the tickets are sold are plain and clearly stated on the circular
given with each ticket. "You are cautioned to see that these tickets do not
fall into the hands of scalpers and be sold for more than the purchase price.
. . . Men will l>e detailed to obtain the seat location of the tickets being
offered for sale for more than the face value and the person to whom they
were originally issued will be refused the privilege of purchasing the
tickets in the future."
And then a Stanford man tried to sell six of the pasteboards openly!
His l)eing caught was a natural consequence and his punishment was de
served. He may think that he has been treated harshly, but it's just too
bad. No sympathy need be offered, for the law was clear and he wilfully
violated it. Others who do the same should meet the same relentless chas
tisement.
