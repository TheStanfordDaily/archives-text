### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
The names of Smith and Warner are seen often in the public prints along
the Pacific coast these days, and you hear people talking about "Andy" and
"Pop" wherever you go. The reason is, of course, that tomorrow the annual
Big Game is played between the University of California, coached by "Andy"
Smith, and Stanford University, coached by "Pop" Warner. Last year, his
first as actual coach of the Cardinal eleven, Glenn Warner earned the distinc
tion of. tying the Golden Bears, who had beaten Stanford regularly since the
war. Now everything is all set for a big Red victory, and if "Pop" can
accomplish this the student body of the Palo Alto campus will gladly give him
the Memorial Church as a token of affection.
"Pop" and "Andy" used to be rivals years ago, too, when Warner was
famous as coach of the Carlisle Indians, and "Andy" was a star fullback at
Pennsylvania. Smith was on Walter Camp's Ail-American team. "Pop" was
a football star at Cornell ten years before that, being captain and left guard in
1894. The first game of football that young Warner ever saw took place early
in the fall of 1891, at Ithaca. "Pop" played in that game, too, and helped beat
Syracuse 58 to 0.
Both of these gentlemen have been coaching almost ever since they got out
of school. Warner has put. in over thirty years at it, at Cornell, Carlisle, Pitts
burg, and Stanford, and has probably originated more trick plays than any
other coach. Smith went to the University of California in 1916, and, until
the Olympic Club this year, his teams hadn't lost a game since Washington
beat California in 1919.
