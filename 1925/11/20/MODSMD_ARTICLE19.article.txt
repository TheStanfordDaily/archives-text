A PLAY IN ONE ACT
By Glen S. Warner
Scene—The Stanford Stadium.
Time—Saturday, November 21, 1925,
about 4 o'clock in the afternoon.
Characters—Coach Andy Smith,
Stanford Varsity, California Varsity,
Spectators, Rooting sections, Water
carriers, etc.
A ;football game is bring played. Stan
ford has possession of the ball on Cali
fornia's ten-yard line. Signals are called.
The ball is passed to one Ernest Nevers of
the Stanford Varsity. California Var
sity, including Jabs, Imlay, and Dixon, in
fade out.
Coach Andy Smith—MOßE WATER!
♦ • »
California supporters say that Nevers
will strike a brick wall when he tries to
buck the California line. They seem to
have overlooked the fact that no ob
structions of any sort are allowed to be
placed on the Stanford field.
* * *
The bricks for the California brick
wall will arrive in carload lots tomorrow
between the hours of 8 a.m. and 2 p.m.
• * ♦
We would advise that the California
brick wall be built lengthwise instead
of across the field so that the Stanford
team can knock it all down at once in
stead of being bothered with breaking
just one hole in it at a time.
* ♦ ♦
We hear so much of the Dixon to
Imlay pass that we are beginning to
wonder whether it is the ball or the
buck that is passed.
* * *
Anyone willing to bet that Jabs will
make his "usual" five touchdowns
against Stanford tomorrow, will kindly
make checks payable to Cabbages.
* ♦ ♦
We predict dry weather for Andy
Smith tomorrow.
♦ » *
The 1925 California Wonder team is
a myth in all except the fact that they
wonder how many touchdowns the
Stanford varsity will score against
them.
