Assembled on the eve of the Bifi
Game, to he played at Stanford, is the
Stanford Club of Moosejavv, Alaska, a
vast city producing almost the entire
world's supply of radium used to power
the great lines of the air and turn tlu
wheels of industry. The club is in tlu
midst of a monster dinner and rally it
preparation for the journey southward
on the morrow. Present at the meeting

as Ernest Nevers, aged president of tht
Amalgamated Air Lines of the Globe

After cocktails are served, one of the
old grads delivers a stirring account of
the Big Game in '55, the last contest
held in the old Stanford Stadium,
vhich only held a scant 75,000 people.
The Cards won, 28-0. "And now, men
of Stanford," finished the old man, we
have another opportunity to defeat the
Golden Bear and dedicate our wonder
ful new stadium, with its unparalleled
capacity of 300,000 souls 1" (Deafening
cheers and clinking of glasses).

| Just as the men, filled with great
spirits, are about to leave a messenger
dashes into the hall and hands an ether
grain to the president. He reads it
] hastily, his normally ruddy face blanch
ing as the words leap at him from the \
! page. There is an ominous rumble from \
j the crowd. The president's clenched
I hand goes up for silence. "Listen, men
of Stanford 1" he commands in a voice;
like thunder. "We have just received i
word from our scout at Berkeley. He I
says: 'By a unanimous vote of the stu- j
dent body here today, it was irrevocably ,
decided that the Bear varsity should
score three points on Stanford. The :
I decision came only after the greatest i
courage had been summoned by the 1
! students.' "

Oxford students caught at a dance j
are fined $5 for each offense.
