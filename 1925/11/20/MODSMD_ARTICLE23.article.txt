# Stanford Stadium Seating Capacity Enlarged 10,000 for Big Game Fans
## 
### 
The Stanford stadium will see the third
Big Game of its career tomorrow when
football teams representing the Univer
sity of California and Stanford Uni
versity clash in their thirty-second annual

I contest. The stadium is a real Stanford
product and Stanford students should be
proud of it as such. Stanford people
' conceived, designed, financed, and carried
| to completion the work necessary for the

building of the Stadium. The first ground
was turned for the beginning of con
struction on June 1, 1921. At a cost of
about $206,000 it was completed and
ready for the Big Game that same year.
As originally built, the Stadium had
a seating capacity of 65,000 people. The
demand for Big Game tickets was so
great this year that 5,000-odd extra seats
were added this spring. To take care of
student applications about 3,000 more
were added a short time ago giving the
completed stadium a seating capacity of
74,400. This places it among the ranks
of the largest stadia in the nationa. The
Yale Bowl, the Coliseum at Los Angeles,
the California Memorial Stadium, and
several others of the largest bowls also
have seating capacities of between 60,000
and 80,000 people.
An advantage of the Stanford stadium

| lies in the fact that it is equipped with
an excellent quarter-mile trac kand a
220-yard straightaway. One end of the
| enclosure has been left open for the
. straightaway. This also provides ventila
! tion, keeping the stadium from getting
i too warm and sultry, which generally
happens when the stadium is entirely en
closed, as is the Yale Bcwl.
The track was built from the plans
and under the supervision of Dad Moul
ton, who has supervised the construction
of many of the fastest tracks in the
country. The meets that have been held
in the Stadium and 011 the track have
proven that the course is fast.
Statistics 011 the seating capacity of
the stadium and its general dimensions
are as follows:
Original cost —$206,000.
Original seating capacity—6s,ooo.

Present seating capacity—74,4oo.
Depth of playing field below original
I surface—23 feet.
Height of top of embankment above

proven that the course is fast.

The Stanford stadium will see the third
Big Game of its career tomorrow when
football teams representing the Univer
sity of California and Stanford Uni
versity clash in their thirty-second annual

I contest. The stadium is a real Stanford
product and Stanford students should be
proud of it as such. Stanford people
' conceived, designed, financed, and carried
| to completion the work necessary for the

building of the Stadium. The first ground
was turned for the beginning of con
struction on June 1, 1921. At a cost of
about $206,000 it was completed and
ready for the Big Game that same year.
As originally built, the Stadium had
a seating capacity of 65,000 people. The
demand for Big Game tickets was so
great this year that 5,000-odd extra seats
were added this spring. To take care of
student applications about 3,000 more
were added a short time ago giving the
completed stadium a seating capacity of
74,400. This places it among the ranks
of the largest stadia in the nationa. The
Yale Bowl, the Coliseum at Los Angeles,
the California Memorial Stadium, and
several others of the largest bowls also
have seating capacities of between 60,000
and 80,000 people.
An advantage of the Stanford stadium

| lies in the fact that it is equipped with
an excellent quarter-mile trac kand a
220-yard straightaway. One end of the
| enclosure has been left open for the
. straightaway. This also provides ventila
! tion, keeping the stadium from getting
i too warm and sultry, which generally
happens when the stadium is entirely en
closed, as is the Yale Bcwl.
The track was built from the plans
and under the supervision of Dad Moul
ton, who has supervised the construction
of many of the fastest tracks in the
country. The meets that have been held
in the Stadium and 011 the track have
proven that the course is fast.
