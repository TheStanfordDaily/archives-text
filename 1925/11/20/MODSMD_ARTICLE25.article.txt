Jimmie Dixon (left) and Fred Swan (right) used to play on the same
football team at Berkeley high school, and they were coached by Husky
Hunt who now drills the Stanford freshmen elevens. When Jimmie and
Fred fought for the same school, Berkeley was in the running for the
state football title, Bakersfield being their main rival.
With the end of prep school days, Jim and Fred parted never again
to meet as friends on the gridiron. Dixon entered California in the hall
of 1922, while Swan followed Husky Hunt to Stanford in 1923 where he
was elected captain of that year's freshman squad. Both of these men
made their respective varsities in their sophomore year. Because of in
juries, Dixon will be unable to play tomorrow in what was to have been
his last collegiate game. Swan has still another year of competition with
Stanford. While Dixon is a backfield star playing at halfback, Swan
excells in the line at guard.
