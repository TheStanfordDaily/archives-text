# HISTORY OF FIRST STANFORD AXE IS ALMOST FORGOTTEN
## 
### 
Over at Berkeley there is a chunk of
metal, rusted and corroded from long con
tact with slimy alien hands. It has lost all
significance as it is kept carefully hidden
in a vault and it is brought out but once a
year, and even then it is securely chained.
The Bruins fear that some wearer of the
Cardinal will take it away and spank its
trembling guardians with the flat of the blade.
This piece of iron means little or nothing
to Stanford. It is no longer a tradition and

its dulled blade no longer stands for any
j thing, for it is 110 more than an unrecogniz
j able relic of some forgotten day. That tar
i nished tool has been killed as a tradition by
the very ones who hold it; for their policy of
concealment has made it little more than a
stale curiosity.
A keen, broad-bladed hewer of victories
j lias come to take its place. It is the Stanford
1 axe, wielded by a brawn Stanford man, Cap
tain Ernie Nevers, and it is to be used Sat
urday to skin California's Golden Bear. Inci
dentally, it will be used to swing the balance
of victories in favor of Pop Warner's foot
ball system, too.
The new symbol has more real tradition
! clinging around it than the old one ever
| had. This present Stanford axe was found

in the historical Bret Harte country several
! summers ago. This broad-bladed weapon
probably belonged to some old forty-niners
who toiled with it across mountains and
deserts to the red sunset of California. It
was used last Wednesday night at the great
est bonfire rally ever held at Stanford, and
it served to raise the Stanford spirit to a
white hot pitch where raw Bear meat is the
only thing that will satisfy its appetite.
The tool that now reposes over in the
Berkeley vault was brought out by some
Stanford men in the spring of 1899 as a
casual addition to the axe yell composed
some time before by Will Irwin. The axe was
taken to the Valencia street Recreation Park
where the California-Stanford baseball series
was being held.
