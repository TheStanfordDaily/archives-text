# Stanford Thrills Crowd of 5000 In Winning First Big Game With California By Score of 14 to 10
## 
### Monroe Eaton 
The first football game played be
tween Stanford and California lacked
much of the pomp and ceremony of
present-day Big Gaines; but it was
then, as it is now, the greatest annual
athletic event of the Pacific coast, and
it embodied then, as now, the same
intense rivalry and wild enthusiasm,
the college spirit that has made foot
ball the greatest of American games.
There were no cheer leaders, 110 root
ing sections, 110 bleacher stunts. Each
and every man made noise in his own
particular way, and every man did his
utmost to cheer his varsity to victory.
At 7 o'clock on Saturday morning,
March 19, 1892, a train carrying five
hundred Stanford students left Palo
Alto bound for San Francisco. The
Stanford delegation made its headquar
ters at the Lick house, and all during
the morning, throngs of Stanford and
California students filled the streets,
bringing enthusiasm with them and
spreading enthusiasm after them. The
sight was then very unusual to San
P'rancisco.
By about 2 o'clock in the afternoon
a crowd of 5,000 people had assembled
at old Recreation Park near the end
of Haight street. The Stanford and
California supporters were grouped in

| separate bodies, and from the grand !
| stand fluttered flags, banners, and rib- j
bons of red and white, and blue and j
gold. Every conceivable sort of instru-1
meat for noise making was being used |
to its utmost capacity.
Bears Were Favorites
The California team entered the;
game by far the favorite. Football had !
been played at the state university for
nearly ten years; this was Stanford's
first year at the game. The California
team outweighed the Stanford varsity
by more than ten pounds to the man.
In experience the California men were
by far superior; the California team J
was the embodiment of strength and ;
power. The Berkeley men were con
i fldent of victory; the Stanford men
were determined to fight to the last.
Neither team had had the tutelage
of an eastern coach. The captain was
, the sole director of the team. Usually
some member of the team also served
as manager. The only coaching the
Stanford team received that year was
through the voluntary services and
gratis suggestions of men who were !
interested in the game of football for
: its own sake. Walter Camp was hired '
the next year as the first Stanford
coach, but until that time the team re
lied much upon its own resources. So '

| with "little of cleverness, but much of
brawn and strength and will," the two
j teams met in the first Big Game.
Football Found Missing
The start of the game was held up
1 for some time because it was discov-
I ered after both teams were on the field
; that no one had provided a football,
i but it came in due time and in an in
stant the referee had blown his whistle
and the game was on.
California opened the attack with a
play of V-shape formation. The heavy j
wedge ground through the Stanford >
line for ten yards, then fell to the i
i ground as the Stanford tacklers |
j crushed in its sides. Once more the •
wedge crashed against the Stanford
line, but this time with a totally dif- |
ferent result. The ball popped out
from the' crowd of players and in an
instant Briggs, Stanford right guard,
was upon it.
There followed a see-saw back and
forth in the middle of the field. Finally
Clemans, Stanford fullback, with per
fect interference ran around the Cali
fornia end for a gain of twenty yards j
but the ball finally went to California
'on downs. On several exchanges, the I
: Stanford team gradually forced the
giants from California back to their
' own goal line.

Finally Stanford gained possession
of the ball on California's thirty-yard
line. On the next play the ball was
given to Clemans, who from that in
stant was the hero of the game. The
Stanford backs and end crashed into
the left side of the California line, and
Clemans with a quick dodge to the
right, a terrific burst of speed, and a
vicious jab of the straight-arm, crossed
the line for the first touchdown. In the
mad five-minute Cardinal celebration
the goal was kicked. Betting on the
side lines changed from three to one
in favor of California to two to one
for Stanford.
U.C. Wedge Ineffective
California once more took the ball
but this time the heavy wedge broke
ineffectually against the Stanford lino.
Three minutes later the four swift
Stanford backs had cleared the Berke
ley end. Clemans, clutching the ball
tightly, swung wide of his interference,
shook off one tackier, straight-armed
another, and fell over the goal line
with a California man hanging to his
legs.
Ten minutes later, the Stanford line
in a whirling V momentarily blocked
off the California line and enabled Paul
Downing to plunge through for twenty
five yards. On the next play Witti

| more hurdled the California center<
and ran straight along the sideline for
J a touchdown. When the half ended,
i the score stood Stanford 14, Califor
| nia 0.

In the second half the powerful Cal
| ford line, and slowly but surely the
| ifornia backs battered down the Stan
i heavy wedge drove down the field to a
touchdown. On the opening play after
the kickoff Rich, a speedy California
tackle, ran twenty yards, but to no
1 avail. With every man in every wedge-
I shaped play the California team car
[ ried the ball over for another touch
down.
Stanford's position now seemed pre-1
i carious but the Stanford line now with
\ stood the Blue and Gold onslaughts ,
j and when the referee's whistle ended
the game, Stanford had won 14 to 10.

Football Found Missing
The start of the game was held up
1 for some time because it was discov-
I ered after both teams were on the field
; that no one had provided a football,
i but it came in due time and in an in
stant the referee had blown his whistle
and the game was on.
California opened the attack with a
play of V-shape formation. The heavy j
wedge ground through the Stanford >
line for ten yards, then fell to the i
i ground as the Stanford tacklers |
j crushed in its sides. Once more the •
wedge crashed against the Stanford
line, but this time with a totally dif- |
ferent result. The ball popped out
from the' crowd of players and in an
instant Briggs, Stanford right guard,
was upon it.
There followed a see-saw back and
forth in the middle of the field. Finally
Clemans, Stanford fullback, with per
fect interference ran around the Cali
fornia end for a gain of twenty yards j
but the ball finally went to California
'on downs. On several exchanges, the I
: Stanford team gradually forced the
giants from California back to their
' own goal line.

Finally Stanford gained possession
of the ball on California's thirty-yard
line. On the next play the ball was
given to Clemans, who from that in
stant was the hero of the game. The
Stanford backs and end crashed into
the left side of the California line, and
Clemans with a quick dodge to the
right, a terrific burst of speed, and a
vicious jab of the straight-arm, crossed
the line for the first touchdown. In the
mad five-minute Cardinal celebration
the goal was kicked. Betting on the
side lines changed from three to one
in favor of California to two to one
for Stanford.
U.C. Wedge Ineffective
California once more took the ball
but this time the heavy wedge broke
ineffectually against the Stanford lino.
Three minutes later the four swift
Stanford backs had cleared the Berke
ley end. Clemans, clutching the ball
tightly, swung wide of his interference,
shook off one tackier, straight-armed
another, and fell over the goal line
with a California man hanging to his
legs.
Ten minutes later, the Stanford line
in a whirling V momentarily blocked
off the California line and enabled Paul
Downing to plunge through for twenty
five yards. On the next play Witti

| more hurdled the California center<
and ran straight along the sideline for
J a touchdown. When the half ended,
i the score stood Stanford 14, Califor
| nia 0.

In the second half the powerful Cal

| ifornia backs battered down the Stan
i heavy wedge drove down the field to a
touchdown. On the opening play after
the kickoff Rich, a speedy California
tackle, ran twenty yards, but to no
1 avail. With every man in every wedge-
I shaped play the California team car
[ ried the ball over for another touch
down.
Stanford's position now seemed pre-1
i carious but the Stanford line now with
\ stood the Blue and Gold onslaughts ,
j and when the referee's whistle ended
the game, Stanford had won 14 to 10.
The first football game played be
tween Stanford and California lacked
much of the pomp and ceremony of
present-day Big Gaines; but it was
then, as it is now, the greatest annual
athletic event of the Pacific coast, and
it embodied then, as now, the same
intense rivalry and wild enthusiasm,
the college spirit that has made foot
ball the greatest of American games.
There were no cheer leaders, 110 root
ing sections, 110 bleacher stunts. Each
and every man made noise in his own
particular way, and every man did his
utmost to cheer his varsity to victory.
At 7 o'clock on Saturday morning,
March 19, 1892, a train carrying five
hundred Stanford students left Palo
Alto bound for San Francisco. The
Stanford delegation made its headquar
ters at the Lick house, and all during
the morning, throngs of Stanford and
California students filled the streets,
bringing enthusiasm with them and
spreading enthusiasm after them. The
sight was then very unusual to San
P'rancisco.
By about 2 o'clock in the afternoon
a crowd of 5,000 people had assembled
at old Recreation Park near the end
of Haight street. The Stanford and
California supporters were grouped in

| separate bodies, and from the grand !
| stand fluttered flags, banners, and rib- j
bons of red and white, and blue and j
gold. Every conceivable sort of instru-1
meat for noise making was being used |
to its utmost capacity.
Bears Were Favorites
The California team entered the;
game by far the favorite. Football had !
been played at the state university for
nearly ten years; this was Stanford's
first year at the game. The California
team outweighed the Stanford varsity
by more than ten pounds to the man.
In experience the California men were
by far superior; the California team J
was the embodiment of strength and ;
power. The Berkeley men were con
i fldent of victory; the Stanford men
were determined to fight to the last.
Neither team had had the tutelage
of an eastern coach. The captain was
, the sole director of the team. Usually
some member of the team also served
as manager. The only coaching the
Stanford team received that year was
through the voluntary services and
gratis suggestions of men who were !
interested in the game of football for
: its own sake. Walter Camp was hired '
the next year as the first Stanford
coach, but until that time the team re
lied much upon its own resources. So '

| ford line, and slowly but surely the
| ifornia backs battered down the Stan
i heavy wedge drove down the field to a
touchdown. On the opening play after
the kickoff Rich, a speedy California
tackle, ran twenty yards, but to no
1 avail. With every man in every wedge-
I shaped play the California team car
[ ried the ball over for another touch
down.
Stanford's position now seemed pre-1
i carious but the Stanford line now with
\ stood the Blue and Gold onslaughts ,
j and when the referee's whistle ended
the game, Stanford had won 14 to 10.
The first football game played be
tween Stanford and California lacked
much of the pomp and ceremony of
present-day Big Gaines; but it was
then, as it is now, the greatest annual
athletic event of the Pacific coast, and
it embodied then, as now, the same
intense rivalry and wild enthusiasm,
the college spirit that has made foot
ball the greatest of American games.
There were no cheer leaders, 110 root
ing sections, 110 bleacher stunts. Each
and every man made noise in his own
particular way, and every man did his
utmost to cheer his varsity to victory.
At 7 o'clock on Saturday morning,
March 19, 1892, a train carrying five
hundred Stanford students left Palo
Alto bound for San Francisco. The
Stanford delegation made its headquar
ters at the Lick house, and all during
the morning, throngs of Stanford and
California students filled the streets,
bringing enthusiasm with them and
spreading enthusiasm after them. The
sight was then very unusual to San
P'rancisco.
By about 2 o'clock in the afternoon
a crowd of 5,000 people had assembled
at old Recreation Park near the end
of Haight street. The Stanford and
California supporters were grouped in

| separate bodies, and from the grand !
| stand fluttered flags, banners, and rib- j
bons of red and white, and blue and j
gold. Every conceivable sort of instru-1
meat for noise making was being used |
to its utmost capacity.
Bears Were Favorites
The California team entered the;
game by far the favorite. Football had !
been played at the state university for
nearly ten years; this was Stanford's
first year at the game. The California
team outweighed the Stanford varsity
by more than ten pounds to the man.
In experience the California men were
by far superior; the California team J
was the embodiment of strength and ;
power. The Berkeley men were con
i fldent of victory; the Stanford men
were determined to fight to the last.
Neither team had had the tutelage
of an eastern coach. The captain was
, the sole director of the team. Usually
some member of the team also served
as manager. The only coaching the
Stanford team received that year was
through the voluntary services and
gratis suggestions of men who were !
interested in the game of football for
: its own sake. Walter Camp was hired '
the next year as the first Stanford
coach, but until that time the team re
lied much upon its own resources. So '

| with "little of cleverness, but much of
brawn and strength and will," the two
j teams met in the first Big Game.
Football Found Missing
The start of the game was held up
1 for some time because it was discov-
I ered after both teams were on the field
; that no one had provided a football,
i but it came in due time and in an in
stant the referee had blown his whistle
and the game was on.
California opened the attack with a
play of V-shape formation. The heavy j
wedge ground through the Stanford >
line for ten yards, then fell to the i
i ground as the Stanford tacklers |
j crushed in its sides. Once more the •
wedge crashed against the Stanford
line, but this time with a totally dif- |
ferent result. The ball popped out
from the' crowd of players and in an
instant Briggs, Stanford right guard,
was upon it.
There followed a see-saw back and
forth in the middle of the field. Finally
Clemans, Stanford fullback, with per
fect interference ran around the Cali
fornia end for a gain of twenty yards j
but the ball finally went to California
'on downs. On several exchanges, the I
: Stanford team gradually forced the
giants from California back to their
' own goal line.

Finally Stanford gained possession
of the ball on California's thirty-yard
line. On the next play the ball was
given to Clemans, who from that in
stant was the hero of the game. The
Stanford backs and end crashed into
the left side of the California line, and
Clemans with a quick dodge to the
right, a terrific burst of speed, and a
vicious jab of the straight-arm, crossed
the line for the first touchdown. In the
mad five-minute Cardinal celebration
the goal was kicked. Betting on the
side lines changed from three to one
in favor of California to two to one
for Stanford.
U.C. Wedge Ineffective
California once more took the ball
but this time the heavy wedge broke
ineffectually against the Stanford lino.
Three minutes later the four swift
Stanford backs had cleared the Berke
ley end. Clemans, clutching the ball
tightly, swung wide of his interference,
shook off one tackier, straight-armed
another, and fell over the goal line
with a California man hanging to his
legs.
Ten minutes later, the Stanford line
in a whirling V momentarily blocked
off the California line and enabled Paul
Downing to plunge through for twenty
five yards. On the next play Witti

| more hurdled the California center<
and ran straight along the sideline for
J a touchdown. When the half ended,
i the score stood Stanford 14, Califor
| nia 0.
