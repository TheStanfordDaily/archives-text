# FEWER SMOKE-UPS MAILED OUT THIS QUARTER FOOTBALL MAY MAKE PROFESSORS KIND-HEARTED ONLY 368 SING "BLUE SLIP. WHY AM I BLUE?"
## 
### 
Does ejcciting football make students
more studious? Or professors more
lenient? At any rate, fewer smoke-ups
than usual have issued this quar
ter, according to figures from the Reg
istrar's office.
This quarter only 306 students are
singinging "blue slip, you make me
blue," while thirty-one less fortunate
| ones sigh, "two slips, "why am I blue?"
If these thirty-one follow their natural
(promptings, thirty-one professors'
i wives may be singing, "blue eyes, why
are you black?"
An interesting computation is that
of the average number of smoke-ups
per page in the bawl-out. According
to averages, each page has an appor
tionment of six notices. The largest
number of recipients on a page totals,
appropriately enough, thirteen, but the
1 minimum per page is two. It seems

i! that there are 368 students who would
1 advocate a saving in postage by the
i | administration in the mailing of cer
■ i tain fateful, not to say fatal, communi
• cations. If 368 letters are sent at one
cent each, $3.68 is the expense for post
> age, as any sober man would say. Add
■ to this the money needed to supply
s enough liquid to drown the sorrows of
' 368 distinct and separate individuals,
and the saving mounts. It is abso
' lutely untrue that this much more
money would be expended upon the
necvessary liquids at the end of the
quarter, since the saturation point is
; reached anyway .
