### 
The Stanford Illustrated Review has
enlarged its volume. There will be ten
issues published this year. Instead of
getting out the last issue in June, as
before, one will be printed in July.
This will cover the news of Com
mencement and the first few weeks of
the summer quarter.
The University of Illinois' income
budget for last year totaled $7,795,067,
according to the comptroller's report.
