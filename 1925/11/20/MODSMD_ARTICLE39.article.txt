# STUDENT SUSPENDED BY MEN'S COUNCIL ON SCALPING CHARGE
## Two Others Found Not Guilty But Lose Ticket Rights For Two Years 
### 
Two of the three students who ap
peared before the Men's Council yes
terday afternoon to answer charges of
scalping Big Game tickets, were found
not guilty, but the third was convicted
and therefore indefinitely suspended
from the University.
All student body ticket privileges
were forbidden for at least two years
and probably longer to the two men
who were not convicted, for, although
they did not attempt to scalp their
tickets, the third man did make an
attempt to place all of them on sale
at the San Francisco stock exchange
for twenty-tive dollars the ticket. The
University makes each student re
sponsible for his tickets, even after he
has sold them at cost. Therefore, al
though neither of these men took part
in placing their tickets on sale, they
were nevertheless held responsible,
and the penalty was consequently in
flicted. The student found guilty was
a junior while the other two were
freshmen.
Robert P. Myers, president of the
Council, says in a message to the stu
dents: "Warning is hereby given to
holders of Big Game tickets that in
case any tickets issued to students of
the University are found to have been
offered for sale at a premium, these
students will be held responsible and
subject to very severe punishment by
the Men's Council."
