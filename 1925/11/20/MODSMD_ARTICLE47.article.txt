# STATION KPO WILL GIVE PLAY-BY-PLAY ACCOUNT OF GAME
## Disappointed Ticket Seekers Have Chance to Hear Stadium Reports 
### 
Every noise of the Big Game will be
broadcast through radio station KPO
to an invisible audience estimated at
one million ,or more than ten times the
number that will be packed into the
Stadium. The largest and most com
plete installation of remote control
broadcasting apparatus ever gotten to
gether in the has been installed
under the supervision of Clair E. Mor
rison, technical director of station KPO
owned and operated by Hale Brothers
and the San Francisco Chronicle.
A large force of football experts,
radio operators and telephone engineers
will be constantly at work to report
each detail of the game "play by play"
to see that the sound is being properly
picked up by the various microphones
and to insure that it reaches the cen
tral broadcasting â–  station without blur
or distortion.
Yelling from both rooting sections
will go on the air and as the bleacher
stunts are carried out the announcer
will describe them so that the radio
audience will have everything but the
actual sight of the game. Broadcasting
will start some time before the first
kickoff, with band selections, rooting
and descriptions of the crowd and
stunts. More than 10,000 special scor
ing charts have been prepared and dis
tributed to listeners in by KPO. These
charts are made to represent the foot
ball field and enable the listener to mark
every movement of the ball during the
four quarters of the game.
The apparatus for picking up all the
characteristic sounds is to be a group of
microphones in points of vantage. In
front of the Stanford rooting section
will be three microphones and a like
number will catch the Berkeley rooters'
yells. A glass cage at the start of the
straightaway stretch of the track, will
contain three announcers, each with a
microphone. Play by play announce
ments will be telephoned here directly
from the sidelines. Behind each of the
large scoreboards are amplifiers and
control panels for switching the micro
phones on and off as they are needed.
KPO has been granted exclusive broad
casting rights for the game.
