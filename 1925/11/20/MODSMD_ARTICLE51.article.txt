When Cardinal meets Bear tomorrow, the Blue and Gold varsity will enter
the fray under the leadership of Captain Tut Imlay for the last time. At the
final gun the fighting Bruin halfback will have completed his meteoric career
in collegiate football.
Imlay's rise to captaincy reads like a story from fiction. In 1922, the
sturdy back helped defeat the Stanford freshmen by a 54-0 score, and he
loomed as possible varsity material.
Next year, the year of 1923, found Tut Imlay for the greater part of the
season on the bench. California had truly a championship team that year, and
many stars made up the roster. In 1924, the Pacific coast predicted the down
fall of the Golden Bear, but Imlay, with his squirming, running plays, helped
to retain the conference honors for California. His fighting spirit and good
will to friend and foe alike stamped him a man worth knowing and as a
football player, worth considering.
The late Walter Camp realized his worth and named him on his second
all-American team.
Because of his remarkable personality and spirit, Imlay was accorded the
honor of piloting this year's varsity. During the first part of the season,
Imlay injured his back, and was out of the game for two weeks. Never before
have the Bruin rooters or the varsity itself realized what effect little Tut's
presence on the field had.
When the Bruin captain returned to the game he was greeted with pro
longed cheers. Throughout the season this 158-pound back has performed
supremely on the grid field, and has been the deciding factor in the work of
his team.
Tomorrow, fans will see Tut come from under the pile when down with
his famous smile and this scintillating half wilf be remembered for that smile
long after the game has ended.
