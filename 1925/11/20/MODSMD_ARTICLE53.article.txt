# STAMINA WILL DECIDE BIG GAMEâ€”ANDY KERR
## 
### 
At the beginning of the season, Cali
fornia started with a team of veterans,
while the Stanford squad was green
and inexperienced. For this reason the
Bears were a better team than Stan
ford during October. The Stanford
team has made satisfactory progress
and we feel that today they are as
good a team as California. However,
the fact that Poulson, star tackle, is
definitely out of the game and that
four of the .men who are expected to
start the California contest are in
jured may have its effect upon the re
sult of the game. Not only does the
physical condition of these four men

affect their playing in the game, hut
it has also retarded the work of (he
conches in preparation for the Big
Game, for none of these four boys
could do any rough work.
Therefore, the physical condition of
the Stanford team is a vital factor in
the result of the game. If the Stan
ford team can stand a hard, grueling
! fight, the contest is an even proposi
tion, and the team that comes the
nearest to playing errorless hall will
likely win.
