# FINNISH, BOHEMIAN COMPOSERS WILL BE ON ORGAN PROGRAM
## New World Symphony 'Largo' 'Carillon' by Sibelius On Allen's List 
### Herbert Klein 
Two composers, strongly nationalis
tic in style and choice of musical sub
jects, will be represented on the pro
gram of the organ recital to be given
■next Sunday afternoon at 4 o'clock in
the Memorial church. They are Jan
Sibelius, Finland's greatest composer,
and Anton Dvorak, Bohemia's greatest
representative in music. Both have
made constant use (if the folk music of
their native lands and their orchestral
compositions have national coloring.
"Carillon" is a bell song by Sibe
lius. It was written by him especially
for performance on the bells of the
church of Bergshall, a suburb of the
Finnish city of Helsingfors. Sibelius'
best known work in this country is his
tone poem "Finlandia." His writing
is tinctured with the gloom and power
of the Northern temperament, influ
enced by the bleakness of surrounding
nature.
Dvorak was a master in the adapta
tion of the melodies and rhythms of
the folk songs of his native Bohemia.
He came to America and spent several
years of musical work in New York
■City. When he returned to Europe he
paid tribute to thjs country in a sym
phony, his fifth and by far the greatest,
to which he gave the name "From the
New World." It is known to the great
mass of American concert goers, with
whom it is a favorite, simply as the
"New World Symphony."
The second movement of this, the
""Largo," will be played on Sunday. It
is slow and majestic in feeling, strong
ly suggestive of the "spirituals" of the
Southern plantation negroes. Dvorak
did not borrow an actual negro melody
hut composed one so much in the feel
ing and style of the usual "spirituals"
that it has often been mistakenly as
sumed that he gathered the actual
melodies while in America. The other
movements of the symphony were in
the rhythm and spirit of the songs and
dances of the native American Indians,
it being Dvorak's intention to make a
work with the two musics distinctly
and characteristically native to the
American continent, namely negro and
Indian.
Two arrangements of the Lutheran
hymn "To God Alone on High Be
Praise" complete the program. They
are in the Chorale Prelude form and
composed by John Sebastian Bach,
great among musicians in every field
but especially preeminent for his organ
compositions.
