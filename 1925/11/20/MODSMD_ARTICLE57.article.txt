# RALLY COMMITTEE ISSUES RULES FOR BIG GAME ROOTERS
## 
### 
All rooters should be in their
seats at the stadium Saturday by
1:30. Every rooter must wear a
white shirt, a bow tie, and a root
er's hat. The tie should be red.
At 2 o'clock the Stanford band
will march into the stadium. At the
same time the first stunt of the day
will be called for. There are in
struction cards at each seat, but to
get the best results in the stunts it
is imperative that each person in
the rooting section sits over one
card.
The rally committee gives the
following hints to rooters:
Do not touch the colored card-J
(intil directions are given by Burt
Lapp.
Do not mix the cards.
The best procedure is to put the
cards on your lap, and use them
in order.
