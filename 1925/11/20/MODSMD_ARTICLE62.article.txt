# Dink Gives Ernie a Few Pointers
## 
### 
Captain Ernie Nevers owes much of his
remarkable and consistent punting ability
to the tutelage of Dink Templeton, Stanford
track coach. Templeton was rated the best
punter in the country in 1919 when he played
on the Stanford varsity. He has given in
struction to varsity punters during the past
years and has coached Nevers for the past
three years and is responsible for the great
er part of his development into a stellar
kicker.
Templeton made several notable kicks
during his career on the varsity. In the
Big Game in 1919, with the score 0 to 0, he
drop-kicked the pigskin over the goal from
the 35-yard line against a strong wind. This
game was the one that marked the return to
American football of California and Stan
ford. Templeton himself developed his kick
ing ability in rugby. He was a member of
the American liugby team and its greatest
artist with the toe. He is credited with one
eighty-yard punt in a football game.
Nevers averaged thirty-eight yards in the
1923 Big Game and has gone over this figure
in games this season. His kicking has been
steady and consistent with the exception
of the Washington game when he was forced
to rush his punts. His punting ability with
his passing and ball carrying talent makes
him truly a triple-threat man.
With Dixon out of the California lineup,
the Bears will be dependent upon Blewett
for their punting. In a kicking battle be
tween Blewett and Nevers in a close-fought
game, the greatest yardage gain will be
made by the one who is able to get his foot
in action effectively in the shortest possible
time. If Nevers is able to do this, partial
credit, at least, must go to Dink Templeton
who has been able to communicate the se
crets of his own former athletic ability to
others in football as well as in track and
field sports.
Although Templeton is a track coach he
spends much of his time with the football
players teaching them the fine points of
kicking. The development of Cleaveland as
a punter was entirely due to his instruction.
Another achievement was turning out Cud
deback as a superior place kicker, as shown
by his sensational boots in the Big Game
last year. Templeton will be on the job
again next year helping Pop Warner's men
to send the ball sailing for the additional
yards that count so much in the game.
