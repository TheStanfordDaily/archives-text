# "NO QUEENING" RULE
## 
### 
Northwestern University has issued
an official student decree that Monday,
Tuesday, and Thursday are ruled to
be "dateless nights." On those even
ings no man student can associate
with a woman student in a social ca
pacity after 6 o'clock. The hope of
this law is to minimize athletes dat
ing on week nights, and to foster singlo
sex organizations on the campus.
