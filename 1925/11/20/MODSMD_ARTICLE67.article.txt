# CAPTAIN ERNIE NEVERS THINKS CARDS CAN WIN COACH POP WARNER REMAINS SILENT UPON GAME BREAKS MAY SPELL DEFEAT FOR EITHER TEAM
## 
### 
"I think we have a better chance to j
; beat California this season than any
year since I have been at Stanford. At
the start of the 1924 season we were
conceded a decided advantage over the I
Bears, but as the Big Game neared we
had a great many injuries and bad
breaks, so California went into the
game favored to win. We did tie them,
but only after a brilliant rally in the
last quarter.
"This year the two teams have been
playing very close games, and I be
lieve Saturday's contest is going to be
one of the toughest in the history of j
1 the two schools. The outcome will de
| pend on which team gets the breaks."
(Signed) CAPTAIN ERNIE NEVERS.

Coach Pop Warner, when inter
viewed, discreetly tightened his lips
and said that the Big Game will be a
toss-up. "Well, the team that makes
the fewest errors will probably win the
game," says Pop; and that is all that
fan be gotten out of him. What he
says in conference with Tiny and Andy
is a secret, and anyone who pries the
secret loose can be assured of a big
reward from the coaching staff of Cali
fornia. To hear Pop on the field, one
is led to believe that the Cardinals
have 110 chance at all, but once in a
while he lets slip a smile that looks a
little bit like he had something up his
sleeve. At Wednesday's rally Warner
admitted the Cards had an even break.
