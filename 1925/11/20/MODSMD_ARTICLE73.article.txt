### 
Roble gymnasium's new archery
field will be completed by Monday, ac
cording to the director of the Women's
Physical Education department. The
ground next to the old archery field
has bean leveled, and all that remains
to be done is to set up the targets and
the rest of the equipment. This new
field doubles the accommodations for
archery classes. It will be used for
the first time Tuesday morning. Wom
en's Athletic Association paid part of
the expenses for the new field.
Roble gymnasium is still in the
house that was remodeled as a tem
porary gymnasium for women at the
founding of the University, and in the
frame building erected in 1916, also
meant to be temporary, which in
cludes the swimming pool. The origi
nal house was at first behind old
Roble, which is now Sequoia, but it
was moved to its present location near
the Press building when the swimming
pool was built.
The offices of the women's gymna
sium are in the swimming pool build
ing. The medical adviser for women
has her office in the old gymnasium.
In this office are kept the records of
the women's athletics at Stanford
since the first years of the University.
These records could not be replaced
if they were lost or burned up. They
are not complete for the whole thirty
four years of Stanford, but date back
almost to the beginning. The first
records have been lost.
