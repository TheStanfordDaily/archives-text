# LEO LINDER SHOWS POWERFUL THOUGHT, GREAT TECHNIQUE
## Violin Artist Is Handicapped By Poor Acoustics of Small Auditorium 
### Herbert Klein 
Leo Linder, violinist, showed a pow
erful though easy technique and a
sympathetic and sensitive tempera
ment in his recital in the Women's
Clubhouse last night. His program was
without a single uninteresting number,
and afforded Linder ample opportunity
for display of his virtuosity and in
terpretative ability. The only flaw was
that, due probably to the acoustics of
the small auditorium of the Women's
Clubhouse, tho selections played almost
uniformly were too loud and lacked the
required nuances of volume so that
they sounded almost oppressively loud
at times.
The "Concerto in A Minor" by Nar
dini displayed Linder's fire and energy,
especially in the first or Allegro Mode
rato movement. He has almost un
limited vitality in his playing but was
always restrained and without excess.
The second movement, Andante Canta
bile, was beautified by his rich and
resonant tone.
The second group of numbers began
with a typical minuet of the old school
by John Stanley. For vigor of concep
tion joined with musical beauty "And
dantino" from John Sebastian Bach's
A Minor Concerto was unsurpassed. It
had a curiously modern note about it.
The old Irish melody, "Londonderry
Air," was appealing as always in an
arrangement by Fritz Kreisler. A com
position of the famous Polish violinist
Wieniawski entitled "Obertass" was
Hhort and vigorous. It contained an
unusual effect which made the violin
sound like a bagpipe at times.
Two compositions of Cecil Burleigh
were included in the latter part of the
program. The first was "To the Prai
rie," a very effective piece depicting
the loneliness and mystery of the
great prairies. The second "Eventide"
began almost dreamily and worked up
to an impassioned climax relapsing
into its first mood at the end.
The famous negro spiritual, "Deep
River," was played with great under
standing and sympathy. The arrange
ment was that of Coleridge-Taylor, the
famous colored English composer.
While the melody was less simple and
crude in the arrangement, something
of its native, almost primitive appeal
was lost under the added elaborations.
Fritz Kreisler's "Old Refrain," one of
his inimitable and typically Viennese
compositions, was in the last group,
as were "Hungarian Folksong," a short
and appealing selection of Hungarian
energy. "Gypsy Serenade," by Charles
Valdez, brought the program to a
close.
Several encores were given by Lin
der to'the appreciative audience. War
ren D. Allen, University organist,
played the accompaniments in a way
that added greatly to the artistry of
each number.
