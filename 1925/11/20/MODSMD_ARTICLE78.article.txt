### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Talma "Tut" Imlay is the 1925 leader of the California Bears, having proven
his right to that honor by being one of the stars of the coast, eleven all last
season. His open-field running featured the games with Stanford and
Pennsylvania, and Coach Lou Young of Penn was loud in his praise of this
young man's fine work.
Eddie Tryon of Colgate has been a familiar figure on Eastern gridirons for
the last four years. He was mentioned on one of Walter Camp's elevens in
1923, and was picked on several all-eastern teams last year. His 1925 record
has even eclipsed his previous work, and he has been doing nearly all the
kicking, running, passing—and scoring—for the Hamilton institution. In his
first three games this year he ran wild and amassed a total of seventy-four
points, scoring ten touchdowns and kicking fourteen points after touchdown.
Blond Eddie is without doubt one of the greatest backs in the country, and
if he only played with a team like the Army or Penn he would probably be as
well known as Grange. He is a great open-field runner, with a fine change

of pace.
Ed Weir of Nebraska was unanimously chosen on the 1924 All-American
teams, and his play this year, as captain of the Cornliuskers, has been of the
same high caliber. He it was who broke through the Illinois line time and again
to smear the famous "Red" in the Illinois-Nebraska game last month. Weir
is one of the fastest tackles of all time, and once scored a victory in the
hurdles over Kinsey and Taylor of Olympic fame. He has real football
intuition and is a veritable bulwark on defense.
