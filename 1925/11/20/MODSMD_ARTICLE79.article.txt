medico-chemistry division. This comes
as a direct result of an important dis
covery that he made last April in this

A paper on his research work was
read at the semi-annual meeting of the
American Chemical Society, and later
a comprehensive review of his work
was published in "Science," the official
organ of the Society, captioned, "A
New Acedic Substance, captioned, "A
the products of Oxidation of 2, 3, 5, 6-
Tetramethyl-d-Glucose by Alkaline Hy
drogen Peroxide Solution."
Gustus received his A.B. degree at
Stanford in 1921, having completed his
preparatory work in Calgary, Canada.
Shortly after his graduation he was
called to Northwestern University as
instructor in physiology and organic
chemistry, and by doing a special piece
