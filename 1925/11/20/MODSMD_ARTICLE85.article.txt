# DAY'S DOINGS

Gaieties are on this evening;
Lots of fun will be the cue;
Get pepped up before the contest,
When we meet the Gold and Blue.
Here you see our Big Edition,
Crommed with photos of the team.
Read the dope on all the players;
Let your spirit get up steam.
Interest which the ticket scalpers
Figured they could make on sales
Didn't come as they had planned it â€”
Even so, it still prevails!
Stanford battles California;
Get in line and join the band;
For the shouts we'll hear tomorrow
Will be heard throughout the land.
There's no use to change the subject
For the topic's in the air:
Big Game, football, Ernie Nevers,
Who and what and when and where.
