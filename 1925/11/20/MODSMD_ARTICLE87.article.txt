# CAMPUS OPINION

### 
The Editor, Sir:
During the past few weeks we have
heard much talk of traditions and
Stanford Spirit. We have read articles ■
by seniors and by freshmen, by par- j
ents and faculty; in fact, by everybody
who has any connection with the Uni
versity and its activities. Somq desire
the return of sophomore control, some j
want to abolish all tradition, some !
don't know what they really want. The
battle of printed words has waxed hot
and furious, as fiery phrases fly across
the page. Nobody agrees with anyone j
else, and in the end we have accom- j
plished nothing.
It seems to some of us that it is j
about time that we enjoy a little co-:
operation for a change. We had an |
opportunity to see what the Stanford
Spirit could do, when some practical
joker playfully set fire to the Big j
Game bonfire, and gave us the task of,
building another. The incident proved j
that Stanford Spirit, or whatever you
choose to call it, is still present on this
campus, and that it is present in plen-j
tiful quantities.
Let us all forget, for a day at least,!
the controversies that are in the habit
of disturbing this peaceful column. To
morrow a Stanford team gives its all
in the Game of Games; a Cardinal
team fights to give us all a victory that
we so earnestly desire. Forget senior
control, paddling, frosh dinks. Forget
everything but the determination to
win; and in that determination, get
together and yell for all you are worth.
"In unity there is strength." Stanford
Spirit will take care of itself.
