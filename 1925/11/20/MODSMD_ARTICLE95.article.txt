# "BIG GAME GAIETIES" PRODUCTION CARRIES OUT OLD TRADITION
## 
### 
The football show, "Big Game Gaie
ties," to be given tonight in the As
sembly hall carries out a Stanford tra
dition of having a vaudeville show the'
year that the Big Game is played on
the Cardinal home field. Heretofore,
the show has been given the night of
the Big Game, but the football com
mittee decided to use it for the open
ing number in the program of week
end festivities.
Ram's Head society produced the
last football show given here in 1922,
called the "Football Frothies." Lester
Seib was the director of the one pre
vious, "The Cheerio Revue," sponsored
by Hammer and Coffin society, in
1921.
The first vaudeville presented at Big
Game time Ton the campus was in 1909.
The performance included a women's
chorus which, according to the Quad
of that year, was acclaimed a great
success and an invaluable addition to
the program. Prior to that year a play
was given in San Francisco on the
evening of Â£he Big Game. In 1908 it
was "The Land of Nod."
During the war there was no foot
ball show, and for several years after
Stanford continued to play rugby foot
ball when California had changed to
American, there was no real Big Game
and hence no show.
