A Lesson in Psychology
A N OLD CHIEF of the Pueblo
C/a Indians, on his first visit to
Chicago, was taken to the top of
the new Tribune Tower Building. SV, : k
On leaving the elevator, he turned j*| j| If
to his guide and asked, "When are *L mIM |||||$|
we going up?" When he was told j - |j j | I
that he was already on the top B ; n jj|| ||j
j floor, the old man declared flatly 8 J
that he did not believe it, because SI J|»
he had climbed no ladders; —nor j IP j|
could he be persuaded until he |1 || ||!fii j| jj |
looked over the city spread out j S f lllf A*l I
beneath him. j gj? i|| jj| <«— |j|
It's all a matter of association. The j jfe rk * *Jlll
Chief had always associated the ill »
idea of "going up" with the lad
ders of a Pueblo. In a similar fash- B| ; ' »j|
ion, to people in moclern cities '
the world over, the idea of ascent x |»>* «*
is inextricably bound up with the
name of Otis. P , - j
The Chicago Tribune Building is equipped with nine (9) Otis Elevators,
traveling at a speed of 800 F. P. M., and operating with signal control, uhich
is entirely automatic in operation and independent of the operator. This is the
newest and most improved operation for intensive elevator service in high buildings.
