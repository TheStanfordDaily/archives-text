# ASSEMBLY PROGRAM TOMORROW IS ORGAN RECITAL BY FARNAM
## Organist Lauded as Best in His Field by Press Musical Critics 
### 
Lynnwood Farnam, one of the great
j est living organ recitalists, will play
; in a University Assembly at 11 o'clock
i tomorrow morning in the Memorial
j Church. The concert is under the
| auspices of the Committee on Public
j Exercises.
Farnam, a Canadian by birth, is or
[ ganist at the Church of the Holy Com
munion in New York City. He has
i played throughout the United States,
j Canada, and England, and his recital
: appearances number over six hundred.
| His early musical training was re
j ceived in Canada. In 1900 he won a
| scholarship for four years' study in
: the Royal College of Music in England.
He held appointments in Canada and
later in churches of Boston and New
York. During the war he served in the
| Canadian army.
His repertoire includes more than
eight hundred of the greatest compo
sitions for the organ, many of them he
plays entirely from memory without
preliminary practice. Foremost critics
have named him one of the most
accomplished and brilliant performers
on the organ in this or any other coun
try.
Press Praises Farnam
The New York Times characterized
him as "the last word in organ play
ing." An article in the "Diapason," an
organ periodical, said that Farnam
was as pre-eminent in his field as
j Wreisler, the Philadelphia Orchestra,
I and the Flonzaley quartette were in
j their respective fields. The London
I Musical Times said, in connection with
his Westminster Cathedral recital, that
I "he is one of the finest players of
today."
Attractive Program Planned
Farnam will play a distinctive pro
gram tomorrow. Many of the numbers
| are new here and one, H. L. Baum
j gartner's "Divertissments," is still in
| manuscript form. Two college profes
| sors are included in the list, Setli
j Bingham, whose "Prelude and Fugue
lin C. Minor" is declared to be the
I finest fugal writing in modern times, is
a professor at Columbia University
and H. L. Baumgartner is on the teach
ing staff of the Music School of Yale
University.
Classical numbers are "Vivace" from
trio Sonata by J. S. Bach, "Presto"
from Fifth Concerto by Handel, and
"A Gigg" by William Bird, an early
master of English music who lived in
the late sixteenth and early seven
teenth century.
