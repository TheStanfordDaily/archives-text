# INTRAMURAL PLAY PROMISES STRONG HANDBALL VARSITY
## 
### 
I The University iutramural handball
tournament is by the far the most suecess
: ful event of 'its kind ever staged in the
I history of intramural athletics, accoding
|to C. W. Davis. Thirty-two clubs and
j fraternities, representing nearly every liv
ing group on the campus, were entered in
the competition. Sixty-two players par
ticipated in the tourney.
j The brand of' handball displayed in the
| matches was encouraging to Coach Davis.
| The competition brought out the best non
j varsity performers in the University, and
I their showing in the tournament brings
promise of an exceptionally strong hand
! ball team.
Whiting Welch and Ed Watcrhouse,
j the only two varsity men barred from
j competition in the tourney because of hav
| ing won letters in the California matches,
J will find a number of strong contenders
j for varsity positions in the men brought
i out by the intamural play. Some of these
i new men, together with Welch and Water
house, should form an almost unbeatable
varsity team.
Fred Thompson and Jim Sparling, the
members of the championship Alpha Delta
j Phi team ,defeated the best singles players
in the University to capture the intra-
I mural title. Richards, playing for Delta
| Upsilon, runner-up in the competition, is
| another excellent player, and should have
I a good chance on this year's varsity.
The Zeta Psi combination, Sibbetts and
Draper, who won third place in the tour
; namcnt. from an effective doubles team.
Rumwell, the Alpha Sigma Phi star,
j should go a long way toward making the
' varsity if his play continues to improve
;as it did in the tourney. Lippincott, the
j Beta Theta Pi first singles player, is an
| other promising contender for a placc on
the varsity.
