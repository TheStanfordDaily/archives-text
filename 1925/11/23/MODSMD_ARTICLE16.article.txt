# "GAIETIES" SCORES HIT WITH AUDIENCE
## 
### Dick Graves 
The "Football Gaieties of 1925" pre
sented last Friday evening in the As
sembly Hall proved to be by far the
best football show yet produced at
Stanford. Most of the fifteen acts were
well written, well coached, and ably
presented. The weak spots in the pro
gram were few and far between, and
| were due entirely to poorly chosen
j skits, rather than ineffective interpre
tation.
Perhaps the headline act was "What
Price Phi Bete." This burlesque, writ
| ten by Dave Lamson, was filled with
hilarious lines of action from the open
ing line to the curtain. Lloyd Nolan
as Instructor "Floppy" Baggs, was
more like Captain Flagg of "What
Price Glory" than Flagg himself. Phil
I timer as Tutor Squirt and Kenneth
i Chantry as Assistant Shouting por
| trayed exceptionally humorous roles in
splendid fashion.
I In an interlude patterned after the
I famous Savoy and Brennan act,
Charles Parks demonstrated in a few
minutes of rapid-fire comedy that he
possesses more talent for broad farce
! than anyone seen upon a Stanford
; stage in recent years.
Dancing Good
"Fantasia Fromage" provided a fan
tastic portrayal of the old grad's re
turn to his alma mater and his disap-
I pointment and horror at the new colle
! giate regime. This skit was particu
larly well staged and was featured by
a fine soft-shoe dance by George Eard-1
ley.
Prances Boone scored a tremendous
hit in "Educated Toes" with her fin
ished and versatile dancing. Her eccen
tric dances with Ha! Boone and Van
King provided some of the best enter
tainment of the evening.
Dorothy Dahler, in a scene from
Chariot's Revue, ably cut her niche in
the local theatrical hall of fame by
excellent singing and acting that
marked her as one of the outstanding
comediennes of the campus.
Sid Lewis and Melzar Lindsay pro
duced a dance act that received much
well-merited applause, as did also the
â€¢ pianologue presented by Allen Camp
bell.
Quartette on Program
A distinctly different act was pro
vided by "A Russian Interlude." The
! singing of the Glee Club Quartette and
the Russian ballet by Adelaide Kelly
j and Earl Cairns were exceedingly well
done.
"Murder in the 33rd Degree," open
ing the second half of the show, gave
its cast an opportunity to burlesque
to the tune of continual laughter from
the darkened side of the footlights.
Delmer Daves gave a consistently ludi
crous characterization of A Man Who
Thinks He Is Mr. Hyde.
Jean Wakefield and Aileene Burks,
costumed as two "newsies," enter
tained with a repertoire of "blues"
songs that proved that feminine har
mony will not die with the Duncan or
Dolly Sisters.
Marjorie Allen and Phil Urner had
but little opportunity to show to ad
vantage in "The Girl of My Dreams."
The act was not fitted for this type
of performance. The singing of the
principals was above criticism and it
is to be hoped that in future produc
tions this pair will have a better oppor

tunity to do the fine work of which
they are capable.
The same criticism and hope applies
to the burlesqued Japanese minstrel
skit given by Phil Brooks. Brooks'
clever singing was somewhat marred
by a monologue that was too long and
could not be understood at any dis
tance from the stage.
Gordon Davis directed the "Football
Gaieties" and is to be commended for
producing such a consistently good
performance in the short time allotted
for rehearsals. The chorus was very
effective, due to the direction of
Clirysella Dunker. Jack Wiggin was
the musical director for the show.
