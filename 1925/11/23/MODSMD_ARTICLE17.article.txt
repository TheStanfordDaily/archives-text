' saved his team from a greater defeat. The
i Stanford offense was unable to solve the
! airtight defense of their rivals, and the

j making desperate efforts to avoid a Cali
fornia score.
The second half was a repetition of the
| first. The Blue and Gold successfully de
fended thier own goal while their attack
I kept the ball continually bouncing near
the Cardinal goal posts. Tt was here that
the Red Shirts rallied. Every attempt at
a goal was blocked until late in the game a
California forward slipped in the winning
kick.
The entire Stanford tram played fine
defensive ball, but Gibbs, captain and
center half, along with Van Nuis, goal
j keeper, stood out for their brilliant work.
