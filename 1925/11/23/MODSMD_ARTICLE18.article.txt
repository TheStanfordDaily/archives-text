# CARDINAL ELEVEN DOWNS BEARS
## STANFORD SCORES FIRST WIN SINCE RETURN OF FOOTBALL 
### Wilbur Adams 
| STANFORD defeated California in a game of American football last Saturday,
I a trick that has not been done since 1905, and the Cards completely out
! played the Bears to run up a score of 26 to 14. With a touchdown in the first
J three minutes of play, and another one before the first quarter ended, Stanford
caught the ex-wonder team completely off guard. When the boys from
l Berkeley woke up at the end of the first half, they noticed that the scoreboard
| read Stanford 20, California 0.
While the first half gave the Stanford supporters plenty of chance to cheer
and forget the many years that they have sat mute during Big Games, it was
in the last half of the contest that the real battle was raged. After Andy Smith
| had told the Bears what he thought of them, the California varsity came back
j in the second period of the game with fight and determination to at least
duplicate last season's Big Game with a 20-20 tie. If Warner did not have

«> something to say about this, California
j might have succeeded in the task. But
j U. C.'s quarterback forgot himself and
| all the football he knew in the final
quarter. At one time Perrin passed to
! Imlay under the California goal post.
Passing in dangerous territory may
| not be considered poor football any
i longer, but throwing a forward pass
'on the third down which forced the
! punt to be kicked out from behind the
goal line can be termed little else but
poor headwork. On the next play,
Walker, Stanford, blocked the kick,
I and it took Nevers one play to score,
I and put the game on ice.
California had the ball on Stanford's
124-yard line late in the final period.
It was the first down and ten yards
to go, and Griffin had been gaining
j consistently through the Card line, and
| yet on the first play a pass was called
j and Perrin threw over the goal line,
iso the Bruins lost the ball and they
! never had their hands on it again dur
ing the game.
Griffin Scores
The comparative strength of the two
elevens was shown best when yards
were actually needed. California had
jthe ball on Stanford's 1-yard line, and
i the Cards' forward wall tightened,
j Three times Stanford held, and on the
last play Griffin was barely able to dive
I over the pile for a touchdown. Stan-
I ford had the ball in the same position
: of California's goal line in the fourth
! period, and Nevers went over on the
| first play with yards to spare. In the
last few minutes of play, Stanford
; again held, and prevented California
from scoring from the 2-yard line.
Stanford's first score came after a
California fumble on the 3(Kyard line.
It took the Cardinal scoring machine
iust three plays to put over the touch
down. Bogue went five yards off tackle,
Nevers plunged through center for
seven more yards, and then Murphy
ran eighteen yards around right end
I for the first score of the contest.
Card Offense Strong
The second touchdown showed War
ner's powerful offense to even more
i advantage, for Stanford went from
her own 20-yard line to a score in
just ten plays. Murphy, Nevers, and
Bogue carried the ball to eleven yards
from the California goal, then Bogue
took the pigs in on a triple reverse for
