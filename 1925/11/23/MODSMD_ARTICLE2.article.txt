# STANFORD STUNTS GIVEN EDGE OVER BEARS' BY CRITICS
## 
### 
Stanford's rooting section stunts
were conceded the edge over the Blue
and Gold portrayals by critics who im
partially watched the activities of the
two sections during the Big Game.
California's first stunt of the day
Avas the forming of the head of a
Golden Bear on a blue background.
The Palo Alto section opened its root
ing stunts by forming a white "S" 011
a Cardinal background.
The Bears' first between-halves stunt
was an attempt to blow up Stanford's
hopes for victory, in spite of the fact
that the score then stood 20 to 0. The
Cardinal "S" was obliterated by the
California bomb, a huge "C" taking the
place of the vanished Stanford em
blem. The next phase portrayed by
the Bear rooting section was a ceme
tery scene, Berkeley's Campanile and
"'C" towering over the white headstone
in which a Cardinal "S" was buried.
Stanford executed in turn the Palo
Altoans' "Rise to Football Fame,"
fiashing in turn a 1923 with California
colors, a 1924 with mixed Stanford and
Berkeley colors, and finally a 1925 with
a brilliant red background. Two foot
ball players were then shown, and this
stunt was followed by a locomotive ad
vancing through a background on
which the Palo Alto pine tree was por
trayed. The engine puffed clouds of
black smoke as the Stanford rooting
section executed the "Locomotive"
yell. The final stunt was an electric
sign with a changing border surround
ing a red "S" on a white background.
Following the between-halves stunts,
Stanford rooters formed a red Block
"S" with their rooters's hats, while the
Berkeley section formed a gold "C" on
a blue background, the California col
ors fading as the end of the game and
the fall of the Bears' football supre
macy approached.
