# Victory Again
## 
### 
Yesterday was only the beginning of another week in the Gregorian
calendar, but to .Stanford and its countless sons it was the beginning of a
new era.
Saturday, the world stopped its labors, as far as Cardinal supporters
were concerned, for a glimpse of the Stanford stadium. Men in all walks
liftt who professed allegiance to Stanford —and California too for that
matter—closed shop while they each attempted to driven eleven men on to
"Ti indeed strange that an hour's rtKggiS feSSSK twenty-two indi,
viduals could ,so the 1 routine of thousands. Some saw, perhaps,
the symbolic aspect—the eternal battle of two opposing forces—but it
would be truer if it were said that each of the eighty thousand ringside
spectators felt a personal eimiity for the afternoon against a collegiate
rival, and saw his battle fOUght for him.
Today, the Red contingent of the business world resumes its work with
twenty years' hopes fulfilled, a generation of faith in the spirit of Stanford
repaid. Today, a student body, not as experienced in tasting defeat as its
alumni, but yet eager for Bear blood, resumes its studies —only dimly
comprehensive that it is victor. Today, the Cardinal world bows down in
humble praise to a Cardinal eleven and its coaches.
Past bitters are forgotten with present sweets: Men who "hobbled" at
the critical moment, coaches who knew not the combination to victory,
teams that lost the traditional "fight"—all are swept out of memory in the
flush of victory.
Saturday evening every participant in the triumph had personally re
ceived some praise. But it was impossible for every redshirt to receive
his just reward. The unknown who stopped the fourth California charge
under the Stanford goalposts, the man who was the unnoticed key in each
score, and the unknown who made the best tackle of the day (let the gods
decide! ) deserve far more personal congratulations than they received.
It is all part of the game, however, and each feels justly rewarded if called
only a winner.
It must not be forgotten, however, that at the peak of success stands
another—Coach "Pop" Warner. If the Stanford Red was today in the
dust instead of on high it is he who might have received the greatest crit
icism from a thoughtless fandom. And now with the tide of victory, the
same fandom is just as apt to forget that it is one man who moulds the
materials, who builds the machine, and who imparts to it efficiency. To
"Pop" Warner especially should heartfelt thanks be directed by Stanford
fans rejoicing in the new Stanford era.

the critical moment, coaches who knew not the combination to victory,
teams that lost the traditional "fight"—all are swept out of memory in the
flush of victory.
Saturday evening every participant in the triumph had personally re
ceived some praise. But it was impossible for every redshirt to receive
his just reward. The unknown who stopped the fourth California charge
under the Stanford goalposts, the man who was the unnoticed key in each
score, and the unknown who made the best tackle of the day (let the gods
decide! ) deserve far more personal congratulations than they received.
It is all part of the game, however, and each feels justly rewarded if called
only a winner.
It must not be forgotten, however, that at the peak of success stands
another—Coach "Pop" Warner. If the Stanford Red was today in the
dust instead of on high it is he who might have received the greatest crit
icism from a thoughtless fandom. And now with the tide of victory, the
same fandom is just as apt to forget that it is one man who moulds the
materials, who builds the machine, and who imparts to it efficiency. To
"Pop" Warner especially should heartfelt thanks be directed by Stanford
fans rejoicing in the new Stanford era.
Yesterday was only the beginning of another week in the Gregorian
calendar, but to .Stanford and its countless sons it was the beginning of a
new era.
Saturday, the world stopped its labors, as far as Cardinal supporters
were concerned, for a glimpse of the Stanford stadium. Men in all walks
liftt who professed allegiance to Stanford —and California too for that
matter—closed shop while they each attempted to driven eleven men on to
"Ti indeed strange that an hour's rtKggiS feSSSK twenty-two indi,
viduals could ,so the 1 routine of thousands. Some saw, perhaps,
the symbolic aspect—the eternal battle of two opposing forces—but it
would be truer if it were said that each of the eighty thousand ringside
spectators felt a personal eimiity for the afternoon against a collegiate
rival, and saw his battle fOUght for him.
Today, the Red contingent of the business world resumes its work with
twenty years' hopes fulfilled, a generation of faith in the spirit of Stanford
repaid. Today, a student body, not as experienced in tasting defeat as its
alumni, but yet eager for Bear blood, resumes its studies —only dimly
comprehensive that it is victor. Today, the Cardinal world bows down in
humble praise to a Cardinal eleven and its coaches.
Past bitters are forgotten with present sweets: Men who "hobbled" at
the critical moment, coaches who knew not the combination to victory,
teams that lost the traditional "fight"—all are swept out of memory in the
flush of victory.
