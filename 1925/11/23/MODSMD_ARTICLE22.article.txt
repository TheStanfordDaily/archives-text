# Ernie Nevers
## 
### 
The Big Game marked the passing of Ernie Nevers, fullback unsur
passable, from the realms of intercollegiate football, ihe tale of the Big
Game is not a story of a football game, but of a plunging, charging figure
that was in the center of every play, that kicked the ball fifty yards when
danger threatened, that dashed over the California line when three or four
yards were needed, and that threw the California backs to the ground as
they got through the first line of defense.
Figures give an impression of the Cardinal captain's phenomenal of
fensive work. He punted nine times for a total gain of 383 yards, or an
average of 42 5/9 yards a kick. He carried the ball twenty-five times, to
force the Blue and Gold line back 122 yards, almost five yards for every
attempt. And a consistent gain of five yards a buck through a line as
powerful as that of the Blue and Gold is something superhuman! Yet,
that is just what Nevers did.
He was called upon eleven times to carry the ball when a first down or
a touchdown was needed. Ten times he did more than was asked of him.
On only one occasion did he miss—and that was when a touchdown was
needed from the four-yard line. California's close defense around the
goal stopped him but a few inches from the coveted score, lliree of his
line gains were for 16, 11, and 13 yards respectively. He hurled four
passes and three of them were completed. He scored two of Stanford's
touchdowns and was an important factor in the scoring of the others.
These facts give an estimate of his performance in aiding his teammates
advance the ball. But, his defensive play was better than his offensive
work —which may sound like a paradox, but it is nevertheless true. He
met every play at the line of scrimmage and made far more tackles than
any other individual on the Stanford team. He surely prevented Cali
fornia from scoring on two occasions because of his remarkable ability at
backing up the line.
Nevers will in all probability never don a football suit again far active
competition. He has given three years to the furtherance of Stanford
football and his work during the past season has been one of the chief
reasons for Stanford's success. lie has carried out Pop Warner's instruc
tions with unequalled power and precision.
The Daily Palo Alto congratulates the Stanford captain upon his
tremendous success, and joins with the entire student body in believing
him the logical candidate for the All-American fullback position. It is
our sincere hope that he be givcti this position which he so much deserves.
And wouldn't it be a fitting remembrance to the man who has carried
the Cardinal standards to unprecedented success to preserve his sweater
with "Numbcrl" on the back that future students may see it and learn of
his prowess? And this number should be held sacred to him, and should
never be assigned to a Stanford football player again. Illinois is doing
the same for "Red" Grange, and Stanford can only do as much for its
captain, who is in no way inferior to the dazzling leader of the lllini.

passable, from the realms of intercollegiate football, ihe tale of the Big
Game is not a story of a football game, but of a plunging, charging figure
that was in the center of every play, that kicked the ball fifty yards when
danger threatened, that dashed over the California line when three or four
yards were needed, and that threw the California backs to the ground as
they got through the first line of defense.
Figures give an impression of the Cardinal captain's phenomenal of
fensive work. He punted nine times for a total gain of 383 yards, or an
average of 42 5/9 yards a kick. He carried the ball twenty-five times, to
force the Blue and Gold line back 122 yards, almost five yards for every
attempt. And a consistent gain of five yards a buck through a line as
powerful as that of the Blue and Gold is something superhuman! Yet,
that is just what Nevers did.
He was called upon eleven times to carry the ball when a first down or
a touchdown was needed. Ten times he did more than was asked of him.
On only one occasion did he miss—and that was when a touchdown was
needed from the four-yard line. California's close defense around the
goal stopped him but a few inches from the coveted score, lliree of his
line gains were for 16, 11, and 13 yards respectively. He hurled four
passes and three of them were completed. He scored two of Stanford's
touchdowns and was an important factor in the scoring of the others.
These facts give an estimate of his performance in aiding his teammates
advance the ball. But, his defensive play was better than his offensive
work —which may sound like a paradox, but it is nevertheless true. He
met every play at the line of scrimmage and made far more tackles than
any other individual on the Stanford team. He surely prevented Cali
fornia from scoring on two occasions because of his remarkable ability at
backing up the line.
Nevers will in all probability never don a football suit again far active
competition. He has given three years to the furtherance of Stanford
football and his work during the past season has been one of the chief
reasons for Stanford's success. lie has carried out Pop Warner's instruc
tions with unequalled power and precision.
The Daily Palo Alto congratulates the Stanford captain upon his
tremendous success, and joins with the entire student body in believing
him the logical candidate for the All-American fullback position. It is
our sincere hope that he be givcti this position which he so much deserves.
And wouldn't it be a fitting remembrance to the man who has carried
the Cardinal standards to unprecedented success to preserve his sweater
with "Numbcrl" on the back that future students may see it and learn of
his prowess? And this number should be held sacred to him, and should
never be assigned to a Stanford football player again. Illinois is doing
the same for "Red" Grange, and Stanford can only do as much for its
captain, who is in no way inferior to the dazzling leader of the lllini.
