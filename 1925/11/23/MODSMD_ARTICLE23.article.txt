### Monroe Eaton 
Notes on Football and Such
Well, Cabbages always will main
tain that he knows how to predict
scores. The Stanford varsity made two
touchdowns against California in the
first ten and a half minutes of play. At
that rate the score would have been
exactly 80 to 0 if the Stanford team
had been better trained in the gentle
art of cross-country running.

Now that football has taken to the
stage (as we saw it in the Gaieties)
may we not soon expect to see the
stage take to football? What could be
better than a little tumbling act be
tween Ernie Nevers and Tut Imlay, or
a mixed song and dance act featuring
George Bogue and Mike Murphy in the
latest and most intricate steps of the
triple criss-cross, or even a mystery
play with Coach Andy Smith as the
detective hero?

We regret to say that the University
authorities are thinking seriously of
prohibiting smoking on the campus
until the next heavy rains, because of
the great danger of fire due to the
water famine caused by the Big Game.

Who'll tell me where the woofle-hatch
Disports him hand in hand,
With Missus and his 70 kida
In Hatchery, hjg land?
Where can I hear the riffle-dink
Say dookle through his nose?
D'you think I'd see the piffle bug
Fly off the budding rose?
T
Would I had heard the gopple-chunk
Exhaust his snaffle sighs! ]
These things are why I'd like to taste!
The stuff that money buys.

North Dakota must be anxious to'
get back to the wild pioneer dayw. We
see that the university is planning a
contest to determine the
men on the campus. We predict a bald
failure for this hair-raising event.
