# DAY'S DOINGS

### Ted Elias, Jr 
The highly touted Stanford Jonah,
Widely sung by Gold and Blue,
Hit our fighting Captain Nevers,
And it met its Waterloo!
Stanford tied with California,
In the second soccer game,
Smith, a halfback, broke his leg, which
Proves that soccer's not so tame.
Chaparrals were sold by women,
More were sold than e'er before,
Chappie was so bright and clever,
That he made us laugh and roar.
