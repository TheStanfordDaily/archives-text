The Athletic Committee at a recent j
meeting granted the Varsity S to all \
future varsity crews as long as boat-!
ing remains an intercollegiate sport in
this University. The motion as origi
nally passed granted sweaters to last ;
year's crew, but this was afterwards \
amended. The award was made under ,
tfie new ruling adopted last January,
by the intercollegiate athletic commit
tee which made annual freshman and
varsity boat races a regular intercolle
giate event. The committed also took
up the matter of class baseball and
tennis sweaters. After considerable
discussion it was decided that here
after class numerals in these sports
should only be granted to teams win
ning the interclass championship.
It was decided to grant a special
; emblem to any man winning his em
: blem four times in the same branch of
i athletics. The special emblem decided
j upon was a white S with four white
stars in a line directly above it.
