# TAYLOR PUBLISHES STORY ON SPENDING OF FAMILY INCOMES
## Food Research Head Writes About Changing Habits Of Consumer 
### 
"Disbursement of Family Income"
is the subject of an article written by
Dr. Alonzo E. Taylor, director of the
Food Research Institute, which ap
peared in a recent issue of the Journal
of Home Economics. In discussing the
subject of foodstuffs, Dr. Taylor de
clared :
"Our habits are changing. Apparent
ly, we witness an increase in the con
sumption of poultry, eggs, and milk, a
relatively unchanged consumption of
pork, and a reduction in the consump
tion of beef and fish. During the past
five years milk production has re
mained relatively remunerative, while
beef production has been unremunera
tive. This corresponds with the in
crease in consumption of milk and de
crease in consumption ol' beef. Viewed
nutritionally, the consumers have been
the gainers in the shift from beef to
milk. It is gradually becoming recog
nized that the dairy cow is the center
oil diversified agriculture, and in this
fact lies the greatest future safeguard
of the nutrition of the coming gen
eration . . .
Probe Consumers' Choice
"The subject of consumers' behavior
in the choice of foodstuffs stands in
urgent need of careful investigation.
Under "consumers' behavior" are un
derstood the motives behind, an.d the
reasons for, consumers' valuations of
foodstuffs that are expressed in pur
chase of the different articles of the
diet. Probably consumers' motives can
all be placed in one or another of six
classes: (a) hunger; (b) appetite; (c)
health; (d) custom; (e) taste; and
(f) price. Hunger and appetite are dif
ferent things, physiologically and psy
chologically. A person may have hun
ger and no appetite; or conversely, ap
petite and no hunger.
"In estimating 'taste' it is necessary
to appreciate that the externalities of
service are quite as important as the
gustatory or olefactory sensations. The
influence of custom may be glaringly
obvious at one point and riddenly sub
tle at another; the diet of few families
is free from custom. The influence of
price is often hidden and is more or

less distorted by the ignorance of con
sumers. A great many families buy
what they believe to be the cheapest
foods, qualities, and components con
sidered; but few families are really in
position to purchase the cheapest
foods. ... To an amazing extent, real
price relations are obscured or nullified
by fads. . . .
"Quality" Ads Best
"Advertising of quality and uniform
ity is probably the best long-view ad
vertisement, especially for a standard
food. If a family tried to put into effect
on the table the succession of food ad
vertisements that make their appeal
to the housewife, the bill-of-fare would
be wonderful indeed. . . .
"In so-called health advertisements
of foods are committed the worst
faults of advertisements. Health ad
vertisements of foods are only one
step removed from advertisements of
patent medicines. The housewife is
seriously concerned with the health of
the growing child, and food advertise
ments purporting to furnish guidance
for the mother have certainly some ef
fect, by no means always good. So far
as adults are concerned, the writer is
convinced that health food advertise
ments, beyond the subjects of obesity
and constipation, are largely wasted
copy."
