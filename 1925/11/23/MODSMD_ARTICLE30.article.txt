# Cellar Guessing Prize Changes Hands as U. C. Game Score Is Altered
## 
### 
when Murphy's kick after Stanford's
last touchdown was blocked by the
charging Bear line, a California man
was off-side. Under the rules govern
ing such a situation Stanford should
have been given the extra point at the
time, but through some oversight
Referee Varnell failed to notify either
the students or the press box, though
he did announce it to the players.
This extra point was worth five dol
lars to John C. Duniway, prominent
Stanford debater, for in the Cellar
Guessing Contest he chose 27-14 as the
possible outcome of the Big Game.
Leon David was the unfortunate one
who watched the prize slipping
through his hands following the final
official announcement of the score. He
had guessed 26-14.
Over 300 guesses were received for
last week's contest, ranging from Cali
fornia 57, Stanford 0, to California 0,
Stanford 67. This contest closes the
series which the Cellar has been spon
soring.
