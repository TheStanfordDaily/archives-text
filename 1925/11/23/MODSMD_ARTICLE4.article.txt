# BIG GAME SCORING MAYBE CHANGED TO GIVE STANFORD 27
## 
### 
Stanford defeated the Bear eleven
by a score of 27 to 14 instead of 26
to 14 as has been previously ac
cepted for the Big Game score, ac
cording to a statement made today
by the Graduate Manager's office.
Change of the official score is
considered following the verification
of the statement of Andy Kerr, Card
back field coach, that California was
off-side when Murphy's try for Stan
ford's last point after touchdown
was blocked by Bear linesmen. Ac
cording to rules, an off-side play of
this nature would automatically
give Stanford the extra point.
Referee Varnel made the decision
on the field at the time, but failed
to communicate it to the stands,
bench, the press, and the score
board. Kerr's statement was veri
fied this morning by Headlinesman
Crosby, although no word has been
received in response to a telegram
to Varnel, who is now in Seattle.
The score, though not yet official,
will probably be entered in the rec
ords as 27 to 14.
