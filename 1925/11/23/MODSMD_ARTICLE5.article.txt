# TIE IN LAST GAME OF SOCCER SERIES GIVES CARDS CUP
## California Scores Goal in Last Minute of Play To Even Score 
### 
By scoring a goal in the last minute
of play, the varsity soccer team of the
University of California tied Stanford
in the last game of the two-game
series between the two schools. Stan
ford had already won the first game
and this tie gives the Cardinals the
series.
The play was fast from the start,
with Stanford having a decided edge
on both the offensive and the de
fensive. Early in the first half Schoen,
outside left, started the scoring for the
Cardinals with a well-placed kick into
the California basket. This score
braced the Blue and Gold defense, and
it was not until late in the same period
that Miron, outside right, could add
the second and last goal to the Stan
ford total.
In the second half, California came
back with desperate attempts to save
the game. The teams fought on almost
even terms, with the ball traveling up
and down the field. Near the end of
the game, the Bruin center halfback
scored the first points for his team
on a clever center kick. The game
stood two to one for Stanford with
only a few more minutes left for play.
The ball was rushed back and forth
until, with only thirty seconds left, a
California back slipped in an almost
impossible side kick to tie the game.
Smith, substitute right halfback, re
ceived a broken leg when he collided
with his California opponent. Smith
is now in the Palo Alto Hospital.
This tie gives Stanford a clear win
of the Pellas Trophy awarded to the
team that wins a majority of ten
Kames. The final score now stands:
Stanford six wins, California two wins;
two ties.
