# Historic Landmark Pulled Down for Bonfire Fuel
## 
### 
The three cabins that were pulled down
last Tuesday by the freshmen to provide
fuel for the second bonfire were the last
vestiges of a historic landmark. The
cabins .situated in back of the Arboretum,
were all that remained of a once flourish
ing Chinese camp begun over fifty years
ago. The Chinamen who lived there were
employed by Senator Stanford long be-1
fore the University was founded.
The last Chinaman to inhabit the camp j
was Ah Wu, who left about six months
ago for his native country. He was over
eighty years old, and had been at the camp !
for fifty years.
