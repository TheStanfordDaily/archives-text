# ANDY KERR STARTS BASKETBALL WORK IN PAVILION TODAY
## Last Year s Freshman Team Contributes Valuable Men for Varsity 
### 
Varsity basketball practice started at 4
o'clock this afternoon in the pavilion under
Coach Andy Kerr. Coach Kerr says that
lie is going to plunge right into the regu
lar teamwork, as Dave Oliva has been
working the inexperienced men on funda
mentals all quarter and it is necessary to
get a team in shape to play a possible
game this quarter.
Captain Freci Price, Nelson David,
Ernie Nevers, Wally Jayred, Ted Ship
key, Muggs Mitchell, and Ned Anderson
are the men about whom Kerr will build
this year's quintet. Besides this group of
veterans ,there are several of last year's
freshmen who will make a good run for
varsity places. Bill Clark, Albert Biag
gini, Bob King, Herbert Christ, and Louis
Vincenti were all strong last year and will
form a capable reserve, even if they do,
not make first string berths. Ralph Young,
a Utah boy, was one of the best basketball
players in his state two years ago and
much is cxpected of him this year.
The 130's, under Coach Hal Davis, will
report for practice at 7 o'clock Wednesday
in the pavilion, x while the 145-pound men
start work at 7 o'clock tomorrow night.
Coach C. W. Davis is organizing inter
cass basketball, and will start practice to
day in the gym.
Coach Husky Hunt will not have any
freshman team workouts thrs quarter, as
he fears repetition of last year's occur
rence when several of his men were de
clared ineligible. He wants the players
to get their scholastic records up so there
will be no doubt about their eligibility.
