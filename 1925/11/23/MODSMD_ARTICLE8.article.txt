# UNIVERSITY WOMEN SELL OUT BIG GAME ISSUE OF CHAPARRAL
## 
### 
The Big Game issue of Chaparral
had the largest sale in its history on
Friday. Quad sales were carried on
with the aid of women from Alpha
Omicron Pi, Kappa Kappa Gamma, and
Delta Gamma sororities, and Roble
women sold the magazines in their
dormitory.
Quad sales previous to this have
usually run around two hundred
copies, and sales at the Big Games
about seven hundred. It had been
planned to sell the magazines on the
highway Saturday, but as over one
thousand copies were sold Friday
morning there were not enough left
to allow a sale Saturday.
Besides the sale on the quad, Roble
women sold the magazines at their
dormitory, and this added materially
to the total number. The success of
having outside organizations sell the
Chaparrals was so apparent that the
management expects to have a similar
sale of the February issue.
