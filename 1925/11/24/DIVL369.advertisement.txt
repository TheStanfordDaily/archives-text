YOU have but to examine an Art Chest to appreciate
that into its construction has gone all the skill and
pride of master cabinet-makers. The best obtainable
wood is usedâ€”Tennessee Red Cedar. It is kiln-dried
for weeks to preserve the moth-kiliing cedar oils. Art
ists select and match the wood for graining design. Ex
pert workmen build and assemble it, knowing that every
Art Chest must measure up to the strictest standards.
We are showing a selection of beautiful Art Chest
models and are anxious that you inspect them carefully.
You may know the genuine Art Chest by the* name
burned inside the lid, none genuine without this.
