t"W ETS" AND "DRYS" AGREE ON
SAWYER'S SLICKERS!!
More surprising still, Soph and
Freshman are unanimous on one
thing—that a Frog Brand Slicker is
THE thing for rainy weather.
No need to run for the nearest door
way, no occasion to borrow um
brellas with broken ribs; the best
policy is—get inside a Frog Brand
Slicker and grin at the rain.
Too, a Frog Brand Slicker is worth
tons of cough and cold remedies, for
it forestalls innumerable minor ail
ments attendant to wet drizzly
weather. Dad will never criticize
expenditures when he recognizes
the wisdom displayed in the pur
chase of a Frog Brand Slicker. The
price is low, and you should have
one. Most of your classmates have
Frog Brand Slickers.
GENUINE OILED SLICKERS
Sawyer's "Frog IJrand" are genuine oiled
slickers, the product of 85 years' experience.
In two colors for men—yellow and olive,
and four colors for women—red, green,
All progressive college clothiers carry Frog
Brand If your dealer is not yet
