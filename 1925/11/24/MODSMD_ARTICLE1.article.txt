# BASKETBALL SQUAD HAS FIRST OFFICIAL PRACTICE OF YEAR
## Kerr Has Forty Candidates Out for Team; Seven Letter Men 
### 
Forty candidates for the varsity
basketball team participated in the
first official practice of the season yes
terday afternoon in the pavilion under
the direction of Coach Andy Kerr and
his assistants, McHose and Oliva.
Passing, dribbling, pivoting, and shoot
ing baskets constituted the major part
•of the initial workout.
Practice is being started earlier than
usual this year because it was felt last
year that the team would have bene
fited had they had more practice in
basket-shooting at the start. It is
planned to practice every day during
Thanksgiving vacation with the ex
ception of Thursday, and to resume
practice the day after Christmas dur
ing that holiday period.
Prospects Bright
Captain Fred Price was the only
member from the football squad that
reported yesterday for practice, Nov.
•ers, Mitchell, and Shipkey being
granted a rest for a few days before
starting training again.
Prospects are much brighter at the
start than last year for among the
candidates there are seven letter men
from last year's team with the possi
bility of another from the 1924 team
if Gurdon Steele returns to school next
quarter. With members of last year's
freshman team, besides a few other
■strong candidates coveting a berth,
there will be a hotly contested race for
positions on the first quintet.
Oliva's Place Filled
The only man lost from last year's
team is Oliva at standing guard. To
fill this place there is Fred Newhouse,
who was on the squad last year. Biag
gini, from the frosh, and Ralph Young,
who was ineligible for the 1928 team.
Who will get the call for this position
as well as for any other is a matter of
speculation.
Coach Kerr will be assisted by ex-
Captains McHose and Olive, a forward
and a guard respectively, of consider
able ability, who should be of especial
aid to candidates for these positions.
