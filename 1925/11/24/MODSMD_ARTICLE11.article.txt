# NEVADA GIVES OUT VOCATIONAL ADVICE TO HELP STUDENTS
## 
### 
"Purpose is the driving force and
the moulder of man's destiny, but
whether or not college students lack
purpose has become a widely contested
subject," was the statement made by
Professor James R. Young, head of
the psychology department at the Uni
versity of Nevada. In an investigation
made two years ago Dr. Young dis
covered that two-thirds of the students
did make their choice upon entering
the university, which would be ja
fairly high percentage but for the
fact that in most cases the choice is
only tentative.
To give the students aid in deciding
upon a purpose at which to aim while
in college, the vocational guidance
committee has been established by the
university. This committee endeavors
to help the students to make an in
telligent decision by pointing out to
them additional facts about the occu
pations and about themselves.
In a discussion of the purpose of a
college the head of the history depart
ment states, "The greatest purpose of
a university is to advance culture and
cultural enjoyment, and whether a stu
dent comes to or leaves college with
out deciding upon a definite career, he
cannot but be enormously benefited by
his experiences.
