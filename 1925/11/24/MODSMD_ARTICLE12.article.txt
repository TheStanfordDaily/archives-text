# HERTH'S CONDITION REPORTED IMPROVED LATE THIS MORNING
## 
### 
After spending a comfortable night,
Leslie P. Herth, Stanford football
player who was seriously injured in
an automobile accident Sunday, is re
ported to be slightly improved late
this morning.
Besides the double fracture of the
left arm and complicated injuries of
the back, Herth's vertical vertebrae
in the neck was fractured. This is a
serious injury.
Doctor H. B. Reynolds, who is at
tending the case, believes Herth will
pull through all right, but he will be
unable to determine his exact condi
tion until the crisis of the next few
days is past .There is a possibility that
some of the injuries may prove per
manent.
Herth was injured Sunday when the
automobile in which he was riding
with Miss Frances Jongineel, '26, skid
ded on loose gravel at the edge of the
road, and turned over. The accident
occurred on the Alviso road near
Mountain View.
Miss Jongineel received a broken
collar bone, but her condition is not
serious.
