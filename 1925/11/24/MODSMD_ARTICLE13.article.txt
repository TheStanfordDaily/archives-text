# LYNNWOOD FARNAM SHOWS TALENT IN CONCERT
## Great Technique Displayed by Canadian Artist at Assembly Today 
### Herbert Klein 
Lynnwood Farnum, playing in the
musical assembly presented at 11
o'clock this morning by the Committee
on Public Exercises, proved himself
an organist possessed of artistic and
dramatic feeling as well as great tech
nical ability. His playing was re
strained, and he made use of the full
volume of the organ only in places
where it would contribute to the ef
fectiveness of the music, so that the
climaxes were powerful because of
contrast.
With the possible exception of the
first two numbers the program was not
too lieayy for a recital of this kind.
Each selection was distinctive and con
trasted with the rest of the program.
Among the most impressive num
bers was Maleingreau's "Tumult in
the Praetorium" containing in itself
extremes of turbulence and peace and
peace and ending very impressively.
"The Nymph of the Lake" by Karl-
Elert, had a very realistic passage in
which the composer caught the actual
sounds of a great storm, with thunder
and sweeping wind.
"Reverie" by Joseph Bonnet was
calm and dreamy and was played with
a beautiful singing quality. H. L. Baum
gartner's "Divertissment," a very re
cent number, was decidedly novel and
unlike any of the conventional organ
selections in its effect.
