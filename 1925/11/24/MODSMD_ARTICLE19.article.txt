# FRESHMEN TO MEET FOR DISCUSSION OF TRADITION QUESTION
## 
### 
Since there have been no means of
enforcing freshman traditions since
sophomore rule was deemed unneces
sary, a meeting of the entire freshman
class will be held next week to discuss
and decide upon a method of carrying
out traditions which the class thinks
worthy of support.
Freshmen will meet and discuss all
of the traditions which have not been
enforced and will vote upon their rela
tive merits. The class of '29 will decide
permanently as far as it is concerned
whether it will encourage all or part,
of the following traditions among the
members of the class: wearing of the
"dink," "queening" on the quad, smok
ing cigarettes, carrying matches for
seniors, and the "hello" habit.
The officers of the freshman class
are calling this meeting of both men
and women because they feel that tra
ditions are not worth while unless they
are enforced and that the freshmen
should assume the responsibility of
enforcing their own traditions.
