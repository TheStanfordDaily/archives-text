# ROOTERS WILL PAY TRIBUTE TO VARSITY AT VICTORY RALLY
## Student Body Celebrating First American Football Win Since 1905 
### 
With cries of victory still in the air,
the entire student body will gather in
the Assembly hall this afternoon at 4
o'clock to celebrate the Big Game
triumph and to pay tribute to Captain
Ernie Nevers and the Stanford var
sity.
The meeting will be opened by
President Wilbur, who will discuss the
meaning of Stanford's first victory in
American football since 1905. Since
Pop Warner has gone East to see the
Cornell-Pennsylvania game, his place
on the list of speakers will be taken by
Coach Andy Kerr, Pop's right-hand
man, who will talk 011 Stanford teams
of the future as well as the one of the
present. After Andy Kerr's speech,
Robert E. Lewis, student body presi
dent, will express Stanford's apprecia
tion of the fight made by the victori
ous team Saturday.
The victory rally will express the
spirit that "the Big Game of 1925 opens
a new era at Stanford for a lryig series
of unbroken victories in major sports."
Burt Lapp, cheer-leader, is striking
while the iron is hot to emphasize this
psychology of victory. As Pop Warner
said to the team before the game Sat
urday, "Stanford is on top now and wo
intend to keep it there for many years
to come."
Captain Ernie Nevers, who has
played his last and greatest game for
Stanford, will represent the varsity
before the students.
All gym classes will be excused to
allow everyone to attend the rally. The
Stanford band will play several selec
tions, and will accompany the students
in Stanford songs.
