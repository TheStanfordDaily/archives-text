# A 						High Court of Traditions
## 
### 
The Daily is surprised to learn that freshmen have decided to vote
upon Stanford traditions —to see whether they are sufficiently worth while
to warrant the support of the class. It the freshmen give existing Stan
ford traditions their official sanction, then they will be enforced. Other
wise they will he discarded along with the Washington's Birthday Parade,
Roughs' Day. and the Poster fight.
We always thought that freshmen should he seen and not heard; and
seen very little, too. Perhaps we are Mayl>e the youngsters fresh
from high school can tell us how to conduct the University. Perhaps they
should call a meeting to tell the Board of Athletic Control how to fill the
stadium at Big Games, or to tell President Wilbur how to build additions
to the Quad.
The traditions belong to Stanford and should be lived up to. It is not
for the freshmen to accept or reject them. 1 heir business is to plan a
method to enforce them. The traditions are here and it is to the best in
terests of the Stanford that every old alumnus loves that they be rigidly
enforced. Heaven protect us from a University which can be remoulded
every year by a bunch of seventeen-year-olds!
