# Helping the Old Boy

Last Friday's sell-out of Chaparrals by women of the University
showed that the Old Boy has been overlooking something good. Members
of three sororities and women at Roble Hall sold in the first hour of their
efforts 50 per cent more Chappies than has ever before been sold on the
Quad in a single day. When the women had finished their work one thou
sand copies had been sold, exceeding by almost three hundred the largest
sale of Chaparrals at a Big Game or elsewhere.
This is one of the few times that the Old Boy has let down the bars in
giving women a free hand with some department of his publication and
the result must have been more than gratifying to him. That the women
of Stanford are capable in a business way can be no more clearly shown
than by this sale.
