# Be Careful Huskies
## 
### 
Open letter to his reigning majesty, the Washington football eleven:
Huskies—Stop, look, listen! Danger ahead! You are closing a thus
far successful season but a season in the now-famous Year of Upsets.
Upon your shoulders ttyis Thursday rests the responsibility of relieving
the Pacific Coast Conference from the hopeless tangle that every other
conference in the country is in at the present time —with the possible ex
ception of the Southern.
A classic example is the Big Ten, another the Big Three, and now the
Missouri Valley Conference. Last week Kansas, with an unbroken string
of conference defeats, downed the Missouri eleven, over-confident, and
with a right to be, with its string of victories.
If history repeats itself, you—Washington—are due to put our own
P.C.C. in a tangle this week-end by losing to Oregon, for there are two
history black-marks before you. One, is the Missouri defeat. The other,
your unexpected loss to the 1924 Lemon Yellow varsity.
For your own good, may you believe with some that history runs not in
cycles. For our own good—oh, well—we always did believe in so-called
"cycology."
