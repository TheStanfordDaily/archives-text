"I believe in "Pop" Warner, the maker of the Stanford varsity, and in Ernie
Nevcrs, his only All-American fullback, conceived by Walter Camp and born
with a football in his hand. He suffered under Elmer Tesereau, was kicked,
heeled, and slugged. He descended into the hospital, and on the second week
he arose and ascended upon California; from whence he sitteth upon the right
hand of Mike Murphy and the left hand of George Bogue and maketh a hundred
and twenty-two yards from scrimmage.
"I believe in the end-over-end pass, the huddle system, the end-around play,
the cremation of the Golden Bear, and in interference everlasting. Amen."
Tomorrow will be the last appearance of the Daily Pai.o Alto until next
Monday. Publication will be temporarily stopped in order that the staff mem
bers may take a much-needed vacation.
