# GEORGE M. VARNELL CORRECTS OFFICIAL SCORE OF BIG GAME
## 
### 
George M. Varnell, referee of the
IJig Game, telegraphed the follow
ing message regarding the upset in
the score: "The score should have
been 27 to 14. I made the ruling at
the outset and there was no change.
I assumed I made this clear to all
other officials and players that the
point was allowed. The referee has
no way of communicating with the
scoreboards and I could not give
them that information."
Officially, the score of last Sat
urday's game will go down in his
tory 27 to 14 in favor of Stanford.
The whole trouble with the dis
puted point was that when Mike
Murphy attempted to kick the extra
point after the last touchdown, Cali
fornia was offside. Dudley Clarke,
head linesman, called Varnell's at
tention to this and asserts that Var
nell then ruled the point should be
awarded to Stanford. However,
there was some mix-up in getting
this information to the scorekeepers
and other officials, and the mistake
was not discovered until it was too
late to locate Varnell.
