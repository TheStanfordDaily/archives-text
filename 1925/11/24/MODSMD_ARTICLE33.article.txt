Basketball absoros our interest
Through the months that follow now;
Andy Kerr will start his building
For the California row.
And today there was assembly,
At eleven it was held;
Music that made up the program,
Entertained and quite excelled.
All of us are feeling better,
Now that we have had some sleep,
Berkeley boys have sobered up,
And feel their sorrow black and deep.
Students of Pomona College
Get the Oxford system now.
If they took away our classes,
There would be an awful row.
Leslie Herth, a Stanford student,
Had his auto overturn.
Watch your step when you are driving"
Is the lesson you should learn.
Amherst won the "Little Three" title
in football by defeating Williams and
Weslyan.
