# DR. WILLIS MAKES EARTHQUAKE CHART OF SANTA BARBARA
## Geology Professor Prepares Special Map of Faults Around City 
### 
Dr. Bailey Willis, Professor of Geo
logy, Emeritus, has recently made up
a special map of the district around
Santa Barbara showing why earth
quakes occur there and where the
most violent effects are likely to be
felt. Dr. Willis is one of the foremost
authorities on earthquakes in the
country, and is president of the Seis
mological Society of America. He was
within a few miles of Santa Barbara
when the earthquake occurred there
this summer, and so is familiar witli
the local situation.
In explaining the map Dr. W T illis
stated that the Santa Barbara earth
quake was one of a series of premoni
tory shocks, of which there have been
four in the last seven years. The faults
which did the damage in the last
quake lay both southwest and north
of the city. The one to the southwest
skirts the mesa which lies between
Santa Barbara and the sea, and slopes
under the city proper. The earthquake
wave on the under-sloping surface of
the city emerged toward the north
east, and striking the buildings on
State Street, threw their foundations
northeast and southwest in its vibra
tions. The general effect was to throw
all of the front walls of the buildings
into the street and to crack the side
walls.
The fault on the north of Santa
Barbara runs along the Santa Ynez
range and was as active as the mesa
fault, but it reflected elastic waves
back towards the city and gave a
north-south tremor which was the
principal cause of the destruction of
the San Marcus building and the Ar
lington Hotel.
Other fault lines are traced on the
map all along the coast from about
twelve miles east of Santa Barbara to
some eighteen miles west, which show
that the section of the earth's crust
has been crushed by the pressure
which causes earthquakes. The pres
sure and its effects belong to past
ages, as well as to the present, and
may be regarded as permanent condi
tions from which repeated shocks can
be expected. Severe shocks occur only !
at long intervals. In Southern Cali-'
fornia the great shocks have been !
spaced by intervals ranging from forty |
to more than sixty years. The last
extremely severe quake was sixty
eigM vears ago.
This map has been printed by the !
U. S. Geological Survey for the Seis-!
mological Society of America, and will j
be published in the forthcoming issue
of that Society's Bulletin. The issue
will be devoted entirely to the prob
lems of the Santa Barbara earthquake,
and will include not only the physical
aspects of the quake itself, but also
articles on the administration of the
city and its reconstruction. The archi
tecture of the new structures will be
in old Spanish, in order to preserve
the Spanish traditions of the city.
