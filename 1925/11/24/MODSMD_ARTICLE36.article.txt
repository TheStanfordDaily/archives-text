## 
### 
I Warren D. Allen, University organ
| ist, has chosen numbers from the
I works of John Sebastian Bach for his
; Thanksgiving organ recital in the Me
morial Church at 4:15 o'clock this
afternoon. With the exception of
the last number, "Toccata in F Major,"
all the selections are from Bach's ar
rangements of the old hymns of the
Lutheran Church.
Bach, born in 1685 of a family noted
for its musicians, become the greatest
and most commanding figure in the
history of music. It has been said that
if all the music since his time were to
be destroyed it could be recreated on
the basis of his work. Nothing has ap
peared in music since his time that is
not to be found, anticipated or fully
developed, in his manuscripts. His en
tire life was spent in his native land,
Germany, but his music has an appeal
that has transcended all national boun
daries and all generations of time.
The program will open with four set
tings of "To God Alone on High Be
Praise," "Lento Maestose," "Allegret
to Grazioso" (two parts), "Poco alle
gretto" (three parts), and finishing
with a great Fugue. Following this will
be "Adorn Thyself, Beloved Soul," a
Chorale Prelude of mystic spiritual
beauty, expressing Bach's religious af
fections. In "Rejoice Ye" the melody
enters as if announced by trumpets
and trombones against a running ac
companiment of two figures suggest
ing the stringed instruments of an or
chestra.
"Toccata in F Major," which closes
the recital, is a monumental work end
ing with passages of scintillating bril
liance after working up to a climax
which taxes the full capacity of the
instrument.
