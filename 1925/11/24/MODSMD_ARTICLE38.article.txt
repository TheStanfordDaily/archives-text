# CAMPBELL EXPLAINS STAND TAKEN IN CANCELLING DEBATE
## 
### 
Belief in the family as a permanent
j social group and in the ability of uni
| versify authorities to stop any public
' discussion considered by them to be
harmful to the institution were the
basic reasons given by President W.
i W. Campbell of the University of Cali
j fornia for cancelling the division of the
| California-Stanford women's debate
! scheduled for last week at Berkeley.
I The debate was to have been on the
subject, "Resolved, that the family as
jan institution is unnecessary to the
j progress of civilization."
Campbell's explanatory letter to
Charles Van Pelt Harley, U. C. debat
ing commissioner, included the follow
ing statement:
"The family is a conditionally per
manent social group based upon mar
riage and involving normally the birth
and rearing of children and a common
abiding place called the domicile.
Subject Inappropriate
"The subject as officially defined by
the coach is not, in my judgment, ap
propriate for public debate under the
auspices of the University of Califor
nia. Academic freedom does not in
volve the right of anyone to discuss
any subject of his or her choice upon
a University of California platform
before an invited general public audi
ence."
Mrs. W. B. Hamilton, prominent so
cial worker, asserted that she believed
President Campbell chose a poor time
to cancel the proposed debate, and that
little harm would have resulted if the
contest had been held.
"Give youth enough rope and it will
hang itself," Mrs. Hamilton stated.
"While I think it is a bad thing to
attack the sanctity of the family, I
am sure that such a debate would have
rid the young women of a lot of half
baked thoughts."
The debate, which was a dual con
test between California and Stanford
women, was scheduled for Thursday
night at Wheeler hall in Berkeley, and
for Tuesday evening in the Stanford
Assembly hall. The action of President
Campbell caused the postponement of
the contests, although the California
Debating Council, headed by Raymond
Stanbury, sanctioned the question.
