# TIME SAVED
## 
### 
The College of Agriculture at the
University of Illinois has been able to
help pork production by saving a month
or more in the time ordinarily required
to get pigs up to marketable size.
Eleven Indians from the reservation
in New Mexico entertained the people!
of Salt Lake City with native songs and
dances last week-end.
