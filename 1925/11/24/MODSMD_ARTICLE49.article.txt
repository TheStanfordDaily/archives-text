# NEW SHOES DESIGNED FOR HOCKEY GUARDS
## 
### 
I Extra-strong shoes for hockey goal
guards, designed by a group of English
: coaches and players, are now under
I consideration by the Women's Physic al
I Education department for use in the
| sport here. The shoes have reinforced
| leather toes and heels, and crepe rub
ber sides with stiff leather welts. The
' soles are thick leather with quarter
inch cleats. The shoes are designed for
strength and for kicking rather than
for speed.
New shin-guards for goalkeepers
have flaps that stand out to present a
plane surface to the front instead of a
rounded surface. The idea here, it is
j stated, is to prevent the hall from
| glancing off the shin-guards into the
| goal when the guard is defending the
goal close in.
