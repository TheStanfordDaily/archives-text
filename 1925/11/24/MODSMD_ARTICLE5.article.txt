# GOLF STARS ELIGIBLE FOR VARSITY MATCH
## 
### 
F.ddie Meyberg and Bob Vermilya, two
of the star performers of the Stanford
golf team who are ineligible for varsity
play this quarter will be able to partici
pate in the Stanford-California match.
This follows the reception of a letter
from the California manager in reply to a
query sent by Tom Condit, Stanford man
ager, asking that the annual meet he post
poned until next quarter. The California
manager consented to postpone the match
until that time.
Neither Meyberg nor Vermilya have
completed three quarters at Stanford,
which is the requirement for varsity play.
With these two men bolstering up the
Stanford team it will stand good chance
to win from California when the two
teams meet next quarter.
