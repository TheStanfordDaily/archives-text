# POP WARNER, JONES, ROCKNE TO PICK 1925 TEAM
## Three Coaches Will Meet in New York to Select All-Americans 
### 
! Pop Warner, Knute Rockne, and Tad
Jones of Stanford, Notre Dame, and Yale,
will choose a mythical All-American team
for 1925. The three coaches will go into
j secret conference at New York, Warner
: having left Palo Alto Sunday at the re
quest of Rockne and Jones.
With the passing of Walter Camp,
! whose choice of mythical players lias for
i past years been considered "official" by
the general public, new system of All
j American selection seems imminent. With
j thousands of college football players par
; ticipating in all sections of the country, it
> is practically impossible for a single man
j to take into consideration all the players
! of merit, in spite of newspaper clippings,
' or partial first-hand information.
Jones has watched the outstanding play
ers of the East during the 1925 season,
j while Rockne and Warner have observed
| players of the Middle West and Pacific
Coast. The three coaches, all leading au
thorities among football mentors of the
| country, will collaborate in selecting a
joint team, considering practically all
players of the entire college world.
Warner will return to Stanford the
! week following the Thanksgiving vaca
! tion.
