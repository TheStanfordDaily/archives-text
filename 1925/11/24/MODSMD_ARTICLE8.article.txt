# PHI BETA KAPPA TO CELEBRATE FOUNDING IN ANNUAL REUNION
## 
### 
j Phi Beta Kappa, national honorary
! scholastic fraternity, is celebrating the
149 th anniversary of its founding on
j December 5. Meetings and dinners in
; all the United Chapters and Alumni
| Associations will constitute a very im
portant reun |n of Phi Beta Kappa
members to make plans for the sesqui
j centennial next year.
Reports will be given on the prog
| ress made in raising the 150 th Anniver
| sary Endowment Fund, the most sig-
I nificant project initiated by the United
â–  Chapters in recent years. The Endow
; ment Fund was begun with three ob
jectives in view: the erection of a
[ memorial Phi Beta Kappa building at
William and Mary College in Virginia;
! the financing of a program for pro
jrnoting a more widespread recognition
| of the value of high scholarship, and
the support of the regular activities of
the fraternity. The goal is $1,000,000,
| equivalent to a contribution of $25 by
I every member.
Phi Beta Kappa was the original
j Greek-letter college fraternity, al
though it based its membership on
scholarship alone. Five students of
William and Mary college founded the
society under conditions of great stress
to the colonies, and adopted the mot
toes and badge familiar to wearers of
i the key. In the four years of the first
i chapter's existence, fifty men became
j members, setting a high standard for
| all succeeding Phi Beta Kappas.
Fully a third of the fifty fought with
the Continental Army of the Virginia
Militia; by the end of the century,
more than fifteen had served on the
Virginia House of Deputies, the Sen
ate, and Governor's Council. Two men
| became United States Senators, one
from Kentucky, the other from Vir
ginia, and two more were judges in
the higher courts of the latter state.
John Marshall, Judge of the Su
preme Court, and John Quincy Adams,
president of the United States, were
i Phi Beta Kappa men. Many others of
the fifty founders were prominent in
the Revolution and the early life of
the United States.
In 1875 the membership was broad
, ened to include women, and today only
| 24 chapters are in men's institutions.
