# COACH KERR WILL CUT VARSITY HOOP SQUAD TO TWENTY
## Different Style of Offense May Be Developed With More Accurate Shooting 
### Jim Adams 
A cut to twenty men will be made
in the varsity basketball squad this
afternoon, according to plans an
nounced yesterday by Coach Andy
Kerr. This number will probably be
further reduced after Christmas vaca
tion.
Practice will be continued this week
with the exception of tomorrow. Kerr
is taking advantage of the early start
in thoroughly drilling his men in funda
mentals. Basket-shooting and a few
other preliminary factors were concen
trated on in yesterday's workout.
Nevers, Mitchell, and Shipkey will
<don their basketball garb Monday. Leo
Harris discarded football for basket
ball togs last night. If the shooting
►eyes of the forwards continue to de
velop in accuracy it is probable that
a different style of offense may be
used this year. The center position will
probably be held by the most apt point
maker to fit in with this combination.
Wally Jayred and Ned Anderson will
continue the competition they began
on the 1927 freshman team for this
berth. If Guidon Steele returns the
race will only be that much harder.
Captain Price, Nevers, and David
are the shining contestants for the for
ward jobs. Price is probably the most
steady floor man of the three. O'Bryant
is another candidate who has shown
up well in practice so far. Mitchell
and Shipkey shared honors about
equally last year in the running guard
position and as both have been out
for football all year, they will get
away to an even start.
The most likely candidate from last
year's freshman team to break into
varsity circles is probably Bill Clark,
captain of the 1928 five, who would be
adaptable to either a center or a run
ning guard berth.
A fairly good estimate of the
strength and potentiality of the team
should be afforded by the time of the
first game, December 12, with the San
Jose Teachers College. The return of
Steele and Fred Newhouse next quar
ter should also add to the strength.
