# STUDENTS ASSURED WINNING SPIRIT WILL LAST
## Nevers Hailed as Greatest Stanford Grid Player At Victory Rally 
### Fred Hines 
Stanford has and is going to keep
the "winning spirit!" Ernest Nevers
has shown himself to be the greatest
football player Stanford has ever pro
duced. Such were the messages heard
by the members of the student body j
at the victory rally held in the As-!
sembly hall yesterday afternoon at 4
o'clock.
President Wilbur declared that no
one enjoyed the game Saturday more t
than he did, and joined with the stu- J
dents in voicing his appreciation of the
work of the football team, "who are :
men Stanford may be proud of, and —
gentlemen." Their great offensive (
work, he said, was due to the fact that
as freshmen they were not put on the
defensive by the majority of the other
students. President Wilbur also coun
seled the students to put all energies
into outside activities rather than into j
class struggle with the University.
Andy Kerr, who has known Pop War-1
ner for twenty-five years, spoke in his
place yesterday with the latter in the i
East. Kerr stressed the fact that Stan- \
ford now is on top psychologically as j
well as physically. He also explained !
the Warner system as being merely j
good football played by well-trained i
athletes. Stanford's greatest triumph, j
he declared, was that "we have not
only beaten the physical Bear, but the
psychological Bear. From now on every
Stanford team will go on the field con
fident that it has at least an even
break."
Mildred Worswick, president of the
Associated Women, and Robert E.
Lewis, president of the Associated
Students, assured the team of their
support in the future as in the past—
especially the kind that was shown in
rebuilding the bonfire. The Stanford
band played a selection, and was ap
plauded with a skyrocket.
The greatest tribute ever paid to a
Stanford man was given Ernie Nevers
when "Skyrocket, Ernie Nevers" took
the place of the "Varsity" after the
Hymn.
