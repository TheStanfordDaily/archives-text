# JUNIOR TEAM WINS HOCKEY TILT FROM FRESHMEN. 5 TO 1
## 
### 
The junior women defeated the
freshmen 5 to 1 in a hard-fought hock
ey game yesterday afternoon at Roble
field in spite of the fact that both
Barbara Fenwick and Marie Manchee,
junior captain and center forward re
spectively, were out with colds. Nellie
Shepherd played well at center for
ward for the 1927 team, and Lucile
Burlingame took the place of center
half.
Both teams showed weak spots in
their offensive work, and the play
shifted up and down the field a great
deal. Elizabeth Williams, junior goal
guard, defended the goal very well.
Lucille Lyon, playing loft fullback, did
good defensive work.
The score at the end of the first half
was 2 to 0 in favor of the juniors. The
1927 women made two more goals
early in the second half, and then the
freshmen stiffened and made one goal.
The freshman forward line did ex
cellent work in getting the ball down
the field, but could not get past the
junior backs for scores. A second goal
by the freshmen in the last half was
not counted because one of their play
ers was off-side.
This victory makes the juniors
strong contenders for the champion
ship. They defeated the sophomores
last week and will meet the seniors
the second week in December. In a
practice game two weeks ago, the jun
iors tied with the seniors, 3 to 3. If
they win the game in December, the
juniors will win the championship.
