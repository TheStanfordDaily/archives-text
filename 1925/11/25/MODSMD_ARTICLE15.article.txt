# STATISTICS INDICATE CHICAGO STOPS RED GRANGE COMPLETELY
## 
### 
The Pacific Coast conceives of fif
teen and twenty yard gains every
time Red Grange carries the ball.
Such isi the consistent report car
ried by the news service wires. The
following clipping from the Big Ten
Weekly, then, comes as a consider
able surprise:
"In the Chicago-Illinois game,
which the latter won 13 to 6, Grange
was stopped as completely as
though chained to a stake. He car
ried the ball sixteen times, gained
a total of twelve yards, and was
thrown for losses aggregating twen
ty yards. One four-yard gain was his
big run from scrimmage. The only
time that he gave a sign of his usual
flash was when he waded up-stream
for twenty-five yards with a kick
off."
The reason given for the failure
of the dazzling runner to do his
usual stuff is that the field was
literally running with water from
severe rains of the preceding night.
