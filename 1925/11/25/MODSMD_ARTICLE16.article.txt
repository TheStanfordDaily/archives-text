# "SHELLEY" SUBJECT OF LECTURE GIVEN BY PAUL DE REUL
## "Keats Paints for Us Golden Pictures; Shelley Sings a Melodious Song" 
### 
"Shelley is the poet of the soul, the |
poet of motion, life, activity, desire," j
said Professor Paul de Reul in the j
regular Tuesday evening lecture.* The :
poet of the skylark, the west wind, the
cloud that "changes but cannot die."
The soul of Shelley inhabits the axis of
the swirling universe. Its unity and
its complexity alike are comprehended.
This subject matter may be divided
into three parts, according to Professor
de Reul: the poetry of the spirit of!
music of the soul, which he calls love; j
the poetry of humanity which, to him, I
is not the collective body of people but
again love; and the poetry of God who
is the representation and collection of
all men.
Shelley Nature Poet
Throughout his poems he represents I
evil as foreign and external to man and |
salvation not in revolution but in an
inward conversion. Shelley is essen-1
tially a poet of nature. Wordsworth!
comes as a natural poet, too. But they
are very different. This lies chiefly in
the fact that Shelley is life, motion,
and restlessness, and Wordsworth is
calm, confident, and never forgets him
self in his inspiration.
De Reul's chief criticism of Shelley
lies in the fact that he is not always
inspired. With him poetry is based
wholly on inspiration, and he forgets
the other elements of true poetry. This
is sufficient for short verse, but his
long verse has many wordy anti
climaxes. To a long poem, characters
and continuity are as necessary as
description.
Characters Not Human
Shelley's characters are far from
human: they are merely personifica
tions of nature. He has no sense of
historical continuity. "Stripped of its
divine music, his somnambulistic verse
often appears to be a nightmare in
stead of a dream." Shelley was quite
conscious of his shortcomings: he
realized his lack of tranquility, the
basis of power.
The reward, however, is worth the
rest. His musical quality is quite un
surpassable. Keats paints a golden
colored masterpiece for us; Shelley
sings us a melodious song. He has a
decided gift of pure emotion. Swin
bourne, too, is musical, but with a
vague virtuoso weighed too much with
matter. Shelley soars on wings of
music.
"The Ode to the West Wind" and
the "Sensitive Plant" are the two
poems most symbolic and character
istic of his genius. The Ode with its
fierce impetus and the plant eternally
desiring what it has not. In comparison
with Keats, according to de Reul, Shel
ley is the greater, for "he has wings
and soars higher, occasionally meeting
Keats on his own ground."

Keats on his own ground."
"Shelley is the poet of the soul, the |
poet of motion, life, activity, desire," j
said Professor Paul de Reul in the j
regular Tuesday evening lecture.* The :
poet of the skylark, the west wind, the
cloud that "changes but cannot die."
The soul of Shelley inhabits the axis of
the swirling universe. Its unity and
its complexity alike are comprehended.
This subject matter may be divided
into three parts, according to Professor
de Reul: the poetry of the spirit of!
music of the soul, which he calls love; j
the poetry of humanity which, to him, I
is not the collective body of people but
again love; and the poetry of God who
is the representation and collection of
all men.
Shelley Nature Poet
Throughout his poems he represents I
evil as foreign and external to man and |
salvation not in revolution but in an
inward conversion. Shelley is essen-1
tially a poet of nature. Wordsworth!
comes as a natural poet, too. But they
are very different. This lies chiefly in
the fact that Shelley is life, motion,
and restlessness, and Wordsworth is
calm, confident, and never forgets him
self in his inspiration.
De Reul's chief criticism of Shelley
lies in the fact that he is not always
inspired. With him poetry is based
wholly on inspiration, and he forgets
the other elements of true poetry. This
is sufficient for short verse, but his
long verse has many wordy anti
climaxes. To a long poem, characters
and continuity are as necessary as
description.
Characters Not Human
Shelley's characters are far from
human: they are merely personifica
tions of nature. He has no sense of
historical continuity. "Stripped of its
divine music, his somnambulistic verse
often appears to be a nightmare in
stead of a dream." Shelley was quite
conscious of his shortcomings: he
realized his lack of tranquility, the
basis of power.
The reward, however, is worth the
rest. His musical quality is quite un
surpassable. Keats paints a golden
colored masterpiece for us; Shelley
sings us a melodious song. He has a
decided gift of pure emotion. Swin
bourne, too, is musical, but with a
vague virtuoso weighed too much with
matter. Shelley soars on wings of
music.
"The Ode to the West Wind" and
the "Sensitive Plant" are the two
poems most symbolic and character
istic of his genius. The Ode with its
fierce impetus and the plant eternally
desiring what it has not. In comparison
with Keats, according to de Reul, Shel
ley is the greater, for "he has wings
and soars higher, occasionally meeting
Keats on his own ground."
