# The Glitter of Gold

"Red" Grange has tossed aside his books at the University of Illinois to
accept a position on a Chicago professional football team. Coach Zuppke
showed his opinion of the dazzling Ail-American halfback at a banquet
last night when he declared that Grange and the University of Illinois
were "through"—that he would see to it that Grange never graduated.
Nationwide publicity and hero worship have contributed to turn the
red head of the Illinois captain. He has forgotten the ethics and ideals of
amateur sport and betrayed a faith by leaving school for the ranks of the
professionals the minute the last game of the conference season was played.
A wide gap separates amateurs and professionals. Ihe amateur gives his
best without remuneration for the sake of the sport he loves; the profes
sional gives just enough to insure the continuance of his salary and he gen
erally acquires a dislike for the game long before he is financially able to
give it up. For this reason the work of the amateur is appreciated and his
efforts are respected because they are sincere. The professional is an idol
as long as he can give a flawless exhibition; when he makes a mistake or
fumbles the disinterested spectators are quick to hiss and boo..
Professional baseball has attained a recognized standing throughout
the country. Professional football has not. Football has long been the
king of the amateur games and played solely as a college sport. It is pit
iable that the public is allowing inroads to be made upon it by get-rich
quick promoters. Football should be kept clean for college enthusiasts.
And that is another reason why college stars should not seize at oilers
to play professional football. They have attained their reputation because
they were given the opportunity to play amateur football on a college
eleven. When they leave college in the middle of their courses, or after,
they have not played fair by the Alma Mater which enabled them to attain
an envious position in the eye of the public.
Grange has so far forgotten the aim of college athletics that he has cast
everything good and beautiful about football aside to take a job which
promises immediate and large profits. His case is in direct contrast to that
of "Swede" Oberlander, the Dartmouth Ail-American halfback possibility,
who is just as good a football player as Grange. Oberlander received flat
tering offers to turn professional. He needed the money and so he gave
the proposition serious consideration.
His answer was soon forthcoming. He would not allow his name to
be sold ; rather he would finish his college course and then accept whatever
position he could take with a clear conscience—and probably at a much
smaller figure. Men like Oberlander help amateur athletics. They keep
them clean so that they will warrant the support of the entire public.
Oberlander deserves the congratulations and praises of a nation of
sport-lovers. Grange should be forgotten, and as punishment for his
spurning amateur sports his name should not be considered for a place on
the 1925 All-American eleven.
