# A Request for Clean Officiating
## 
### 
President Ray Lyman Wilbur has asked the Board of Athletic Control
to make every effort to select the best officials in the country for the im
portant football contests of the 1926 season. lie wishes no expense to be
spared in choosing men who can insure a clean, fair game of football being
played.
President Wilbur takes particular offense at the illegal striking of an
opponent in the face with the heel of the hand by a player on the defense, a
thing said to have been commonly allowed in the Washington game. As a
physician he realizes the very serious menace even to the life of a player if
such a procedure is carried on, and as a university administrator he feels
that football will not be desirable and safe unless there is adequate pro
tection against illegal roughness.
This is a commendable stand and it shows that the president of Stan
ford has the best interests of college football at heart, lie is doing his best
to retain the present high standing of football, and his efforts at securing
proper officiating are steps in the right direction.
