The Editor, Sir:
It is unfortunate that after such a
triumph for Stanford, both on the field
and in the rooting section, as last
Saturday, there should be anything to
regret, but from various opinions I
have heard there is one thing for
which Stanford rooters are sorry.
That unfortunate incident is the act
of Burt Lapp which directed at the
California rooting section a childish
and entirely uncalled-for insult, just
before Stanford closed what should be
a sportsmanlike manner of gloating,
with the singing of the hymn.
Of all the people in the stadium at
that time, of all the places at which to
pull a stunt like that, and of all the
times at which such may be done, the
head yell-leader of the victorious Stan
lord rooters should be the last to do it.
In front of the California rooting sec
tion and before some 70,000 people was
the worse place to do it, and immedi
ately after California had sung their
hymn was certainly the worst time to
do it. To be brief, it was about the
worst and the most complete "brodie"
that could be pulled under the circum
stances.
If it hadn't been so entirely unex
plainable and uncalled for it would be
easy to overlook especially after the
wonderful capability Lapp has dis
played most times as yell-leader. But
under the circumstances at which it.
occurred and because it reflected an
unsportsmanlike feeling on the Stan
ford rooting section as a whole, it
should come in for considerable criti
cism.
Whether it was prompted by a wild
impulse as a result of over-excitement
or by just a lack of common sense, it
is hard to tell, although the result was
the same in either case. Stanford root
ers Avere made to appear in a very bad
light through their leader. As much as
the rooters want to follow an inspiring
yell-leader and as much as it is neces
sary that they do so in order to have
a successful rooting section, I am sure
Lapp had very few followers on this
occasion and there should be some
way of letting others know it. The
yell-leader's hand is to lead organized
cheering and not to express personal
feelings. Signed: E. W. A.

The Editor, Sir,:
As a member of the class of '29 I
read with interest your recent editorial
which you ended with the plea that
Heaven protect Stanford if it can be
remoulded every year by a bunch of
seventeen-year-olds. Anyone would be
a fool pure and simple to argue with
you on that point, but what can we
poor freshmen do with all of the upper
classmen calmly looking on and taking
no interest whatever in the fate of the
rapidly declining traditions?
The move of the freshman class to
enforce at least the most important
traditions represents the only way
they can see of preventing practically
all of the traditions from dying a na
tural death through lack of interest in
them.
It seems impossible for freshmen to
be expected to enforce upon them
selves traditions which a majority of
the class does not favor.
If the present state of affairs con
tinues all of the time-honored tradi
tions will go by the boards. The fresh
men should be given credit for doing
all that is within their small power to
perpetuate the most important tradi
tions. —C. W., '29.

The Editor, Sir:
It is exceedingly unfortunate that so
many wrong conclusions have been
hurriedly made in regard to the sub
ject for the women's debate last week.
If the question js analyzed, it is found
to be a philosophical discussion of the
benefits of the family versus an institu
tion. As for "questioning the sanctity
of the family," such a thing was not
thought of nor mentioned, at least in
the Stanford women's speeches.

The Editor, Sir,:
As a member of the class of '29 I
read with interest your recent editorial
which you ended with the plea that
Heaven protect Stanford if it can be
remoulded every year by a bunch of
seventeen-year-olds. Anyone would be
a fool pure and simple to argue with
you on that point, but what can we
poor freshmen do with all of the upper
classmen calmly looking on and taking
no interest whatever in the fate of the
rapidly declining traditions?
The move of the freshman class to
enforce at least the most important
traditions represents the only way
they can see of preventing practically
all of the traditions from dying a na
tural death through lack of interest in
them.
It seems impossible for freshmen to
be expected to enforce upon them
selves traditions which a majority of
the class does not favor.
If the present state of affairs con
tinues all of the time-honored tradi
tions will go by the boards. The fresh
men should be given credit for doing
all that is within their small power to
perpetuate the most important tradi
tions. —C. W., '29.

The Editor, Sir:
It is exceedingly unfortunate that so
many wrong conclusions have been
hurriedly made in regard to the sub
ject for the women's debate last week.
If the question js analyzed, it is found
to be a philosophical discussion of the
benefits of the family versus an institu
tion. As for "questioning the sanctity
of the family," such a thing was not
thought of nor mentioned, at least in
the Stanford women's speeches.

It is unfortunate that after such a
triumph for Stanford, both on the field
and in the rooting section, as last
Saturday, there should be anything to
regret, but from various opinions I
have heard there is one thing for
which Stanford rooters are sorry.
That unfortunate incident is the act
of Burt Lapp which directed at the
California rooting section a childish
and entirely uncalled-for insult, just
before Stanford closed what should be
a sportsmanlike manner of gloating,
with the singing of the hymn.
Of all the people in the stadium at
that time, of all the places at which to
pull a stunt like that, and of all the
times at which such may be done, the
head yell-leader of the victorious Stan
lord rooters should be the last to do it.
In front of the California rooting sec
tion and before some 70,000 people was
the worse place to do it, and immedi
ately after California had sung their
hymn was certainly the worst time to
do it. To be brief, it was about the
worst and the most complete "brodie"
that could be pulled under the circum
stances.
If it hadn't been so entirely unex
plainable and uncalled for it would be
easy to overlook especially after the
wonderful capability Lapp has dis
