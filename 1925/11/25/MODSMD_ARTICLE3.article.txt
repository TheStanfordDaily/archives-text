# TEAR BOMBS REQUIRED TO STOP STUDENT RIOT
## 
### 
Enthusiastic Northwestern Univer
sity students bent on celebrating the
prowess of the Purple football team
which finished in a virtual tie for I?ig
Ten honors last Saturday, turned the
quiet suburb of Evanston topsy-turvy,
set fire to an abandoned fraternity
house, fought half a dozen battles with
firemen and policemen, and finally sub
sided after tear bombs had been used
against them.
The university town, home of Vice-
President Dawes, was thrown into an
uproar by more than 3000 men and
women students who set out to cele
brate the best showing Northwestern
has made in years and wound up by
battling the cops and firemen, trying
to fire the old wooden stadium and
starting a dozen bonfires in the busi
ness district.
