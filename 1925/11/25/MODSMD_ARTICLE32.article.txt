# PROSPECTS OF BABE SWIMMERS APPEAR BRIGHT FOR SEASON
## 
### 
Freshman swimming prospects are
good at the present time, according to
Coach Ernst Brandsten. Several first
class men are out for the breast-stroke
and, according to times, the present
California-Stanford freshman record
should be broken. George Kimball,
Creswell Cole, Herb Fleishhacker, and
Cecil West have all made good times
in the sailor-style swim. Fleishhacker,
shotputter and football player, goes
around 1:20 this year. Arthur Har
graves, a fast man in the 100 and 220,
will also be eligible this year.
California's varsity does not appear
to have a chance for victory against
the Stanford team this year, but with
better facilities for training they may
be able to give the Cardinal paddlers
more competition than in former years.
West, a Canadian boy, has developed
well in the past few weeks and has
gone under 1:20 in the 100 and recent
ly made 3:24 in the 220 without extend
ing himself.
In both plunge and diving there is
little cause for worry. Jack Doyle, of
the football squad, and Bill Ingram and
Chris Hartsough can float far enough
to get a place in any freshman plung
ing competition. Bill Stillson, Charles
Fonda, Albert Meagher, and Richard
Ogg are first-rate prospects for fancy
divers.
James Webster, who has been kept
out by an infected hand, is the only
likely sprint man so far. He swims a
last 50 and 100. In the 220, Rob Burns,
a former Lowell swimmer, and Saxon
are the best in sight.
Reports from the University of Cali
fornia indicate that the Blue and Gold
squad will have better facilities and
coaching this year than ever before.
This should make a decided difference
in their showing, for California's weak
ness in the past has been due as much
to lack of a satisfactory place for the
men to work out as to lack of ma
terial.
This year California swimmers will
have the new 40xl00-foot pool of the
Athens Club of lOakland to train in,
and will be coached by Jack Robert
son, one of the Olympic Club's fastest
swimmers. Robertson, formerly Pacific
Coast champion in the 100-yard free
style, has volunteered to coach with
out remuneration, thereby retaining
his amateur standing.
