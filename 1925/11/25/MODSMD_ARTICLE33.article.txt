# RED CROSS CAMPUS DRIVE WILL CLOSE THANKSGIVING DAY
## 
### 
Thanksgiving Day officially ends the
national Red Cross membership drive
â– which began November 11, but collec
tors will make a final appeal next
week in living groups not yet thor
oughly canvassed. Stanford's contribu
tion for 1926 may exceed last year's
mark of $650, when all returns are in.
Approximately $405 had been turned
in to Professor Arthur B. Clark yester
day afternoon, with $165 still in the
hands of the collectors.
Two fraternities and one sorority
have made a 100 per cent response to
the annual roll call, according to Pro
fessor Clark. Delta Chi, Delta Kappa
Epsilon, and Pi Beta Phi are the
houses reporting complete member
ship.
Roble leads the living groups with
$91. The best response comes from
the Corporation Yards and Press build
ing which is being canvassed by Don
ald McKenney of the campus oil sta
tion. He has turned in $47, as compared
with $2 collected last year.
