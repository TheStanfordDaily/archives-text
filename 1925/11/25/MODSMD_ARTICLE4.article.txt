# DR. WILBUR URGES BETTER GRID CONTEST OFFICIALS
## 
### 
Clean football and responsible offi
cials are urged for Stanford athletic:
contests by President Wilbur in a let
ter of November 23 to Alfred R. Mas
ters, Graduate Manager.
President Wilbur had reference to
the Stanford-Washington arid Califor
nia-Washington games in particular, in
which he believes that illegal use of
the heel of the hand was made by cer
tain players on defensive formations.
The President's letter is as follows:
Mr. Alfred R. Masters, General Man
ager, The Board of Athletic Control,
Stanford University, California.
Dear Mr. Masters:
In mapping out plans for the football
season of next year, may I call the
attention of yourself and your associ
ates to the question of officials for the
intercollegiate games.
I did not attend the games between
Stanford and the University of Wash
ington and between the University of
California and the University of Wash
ington, but I read the papers in the
East and on my way West and I have
had a chance since my return to get
the evidence of men upon whose ob
servation I place full reliance. There
was in these games evident violation
of Rule 21 on the part of certain play
ers. I refer particularly to methods of
defense as pictured in No. 29 in the
Official Football Guide which concerns
the illegal striking of an opponent in

the face with the heel of the hand by
a player on the defense. As a physician
I recognize the very serious menace
even to the life of a player if such a
procedure is carried on, and as a uni
versity administrator I feel that foot
ball will ndt be a desirable and safe
intercollegiate sport unless it has ade
quate protection against illegal rough
ness. Keeping football clean and on a
sportsman's basis has made it worthy
of its great popularity. We must all be
vigilant to see that there is no change.
Since under Rule 21 the referee, um
pire, linesman, and field judge are all
apparently responsible for the conduct
of the players and all have responsi
bility to see that nothing illegal occurs,
I feel that a careful study should be
made of all those individuals who par
ticipated in a responsible way in either
of these games and that those of them
who should have controlled this illegal
playing be not asked to officiate again
when the Stanford University team is
to compete.
Since the responsibility of acting as
an official for such an important game
is very great, I think that you and your
fellow managers should be willing to
pay amply for such service and to se
cure the best available men in any part
of the country. I realize that for the
ordinary game, where smaller crowds
attend, large fees would not be possi
ble. Nevertheless I ask that you make
a careful study of this point.
Very truly yours,
Signed: RAY LYMAN WILBUR,
President.

had a chance since my return to get
the evidence of men upon whose ob
servation I place full reliance. There
was in these games evident violation
of Rule 21 on the part of certain play
ers. I refer particularly to methods of
defense as pictured in No. 29 in the
Official Football Guide which concerns
the illegal striking of an opponent in

the face with the heel of the hand by
a player on the defense. As a physician
I recognize the very serious menace
even to the life of a player if such a
procedure is carried on, and as a uni
versity administrator I feel that foot
ball will ndt be a desirable and safe
intercollegiate sport unless it has ade
quate protection against illegal rough
ness. Keeping football clean and on a
sportsman's basis has made it worthy
of its great popularity. We must all be
vigilant to see that there is no change.
Since under Rule 21 the referee, um
pire, linesman, and field judge are all
apparently responsible for the conduct
of the players and all have responsi
bility to see that nothing illegal occurs,
I feel that a careful study should be
made of all those individuals who par
ticipated in a responsible way in either
of these games and that those of them
who should have controlled this illegal
playing be not asked to officiate again
when the Stanford University team is
to compete.
Since the responsibility of acting as
an official for such an important game
is very great, I think that you and your
fellow managers should be willing to
pay amply for such service and to se
cure the best available men in any part
of the country. I realize that for the
ordinary game, where smaller crowds
attend, large fees would not be possi
ble. Nevertheless I ask that you make
a careful study of this point.
Very truly yours,

Clean football and responsible offi
cials are urged for Stanford athletic:
contests by President Wilbur in a let
ter of November 23 to Alfred R. Mas
ters, Graduate Manager.
President Wilbur had reference to
the Stanford-Washington arid Califor
nia-Washington games in particular, in
which he believes that illegal use of
the heel of the hand was made by cer
tain players on defensive formations.
The President's letter is as follows:
Mr. Alfred R. Masters, General Man
ager, The Board of Athletic Control,
Stanford University, California.
Dear Mr. Masters:
In mapping out plans for the football
season of next year, may I call the
attention of yourself and your associ
ates to the question of officials for the
intercollegiate games.
I did not attend the games between
Stanford and the University of Wash
ington and between the University of
California and the University of Wash
ington, but I read the papers in the
East and on my way West and I have
had a chance since my return to get
