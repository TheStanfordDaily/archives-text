# GIRLS' SCHOOLS OF BAY REGION ACCEPT PLAY DAY INVITATION
## 
### 
Bay region private schools for girls
will hold a play day at Stanford 011
March 6, it was decided last evening
at a meeting of the Headmistresses
Association. An invitation to hold a
play day on the Stanford campus was
extended to the schools by Women's
Athletic Association two weeks ago. It
was considered at that time by the
headmistresses, but was referred to
the physical directors in the schools.
Competition in the play day will be
restricted to girls in the high school
grade√ü. The schools will endeavor to
have all of their high school girls par
ticipate. It will include a number of
organized team sports, relay races, and
individual competition. Teams will be
mixed, so that there will be no real
contests between any two schools.
Each girl will be permitted to partici
pate in only one activity of the play
day.
Plans so far made for the play day
provide for a committee to receive sug
gestions from the schools as to what
competition is to be held. Miss Hannah
Mathews of the Castilleja school heads
this committee. Miss Helen Masters
Bunting of the Women's Physical Edu
cation department is a member. Sug
gestions will all be turned in before
December 7.
The play day activities will begin at
10:30 o'clock in the morning, and will
end promptly at 4 o'clock in the after
noon, according to the present provi
sion. The girls will bring box lunches.
No decision has as yet been made as
to officials and awards. Women's Ath
letic Association, as sponsor, will help
in organizing the activities of the day.

Georgia Tech had two women spon
sors for their big game against the Uni
versity of Georgia. Their pictures were
printed in the paper along with those
of the football team.
