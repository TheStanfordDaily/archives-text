# AWARDS COMMITTEE CONSIDERS PLAN FOR CLASSIFYING SPORTS
## 
### 
Discussion of the bases upon which
sports may be classified into major
and minor groups occupied the meeting
last night of the awards plan commit
! tee. No chairman was appointed to act
in the place of Leslie P. Herth, who
was injured in an automobile accident
Sunday. Robert E. Lewis, chairman of
the Executive Committee, took charge
of last night's meeting.
No definite classification of the
sports into groups was made, but it
was decided that several facts must be
borne in mind in making this division.
While there was considerable objection
to considering interest of spectators
as the sole basis of comparison, yet it
was decided that weight must be given
to this factor. The newness of the
| sport must also be considered, it was
i decided, and any sport entirely new
Ito Stanford must prove itself before
j being placed in the upper awards
j classes. Also, the amount of effort put
j forth by the individual players in mak
ing the teams will be considered in
classifying the sports. Another factor,
that of the national and international
standing of the sports, will be taken
into consideration.
There was also discussion as to
whether the sports should be divided
j into two, three, or four classes; and
as to what awards should be made in
these classes. No decision on this mat
! ter was reached, however.
No date was set for the next meet
j ing of the committee, but it will prob
ably be held soon after the Thanks
giving holidays. Members of the com
mittee were given copies of last year's
awards plan which was defeated by
\ the Student Body, and the weaknesses
j of this plan will be considered at the
i next meeting.
