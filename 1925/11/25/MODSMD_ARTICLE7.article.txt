## 
### Frank Baker 
With but eight members of this
year's varsity football squad definitely
out of further play, Stanford is ex
pected to have another successful sea
son in 1926. Franklin B. Morse, former
Princeton and Ail-American halfback
so fas as to say that the game last
and well-known sports writer, has gone
Saturday was the starting point of a
series of Stanford victories.
Captain Nevers, fullback; Hunt,
guard; Solomon and Mitchell, quarter
backs; Middleton, end; Armour, guard;
Van Hook, center; and Kirwan, half
back, are the only men out of the
squad of thirty-seven who will not be
back on the field.
Hank Millage, last year's freshman
fullback, who has been out of the
game this year on account of a wrench
ed leg, is expected back in 1926, and
should turn in some good work in
Nevers' place. Patchett has been im
proving all season, and will be a con
tender for a first-string position next
year.
Robesky Great Guard
Pop Warner has been holding in re
serve one of the best linemen on his
team all season, and when Don Ro
besky goes in at guard next year, Stan
ford will see a trio in the middle of
the line that will be hard to beat: Mc-
Creery at center, Swan and Rpbesky at
guards. For tackles, Pop will have any
amount of good material. Eli Post has
been held over with Robesky, and
promises to be one of the most danger
ous men on the squad. Raffetto, who
took Ward Poulson's place in the Big
Game, still has two years, while Poul
son will be back, and Freeman, Harris,
and Everett will all make hard compe
tition.
Losing both Solomon and Mitchell at
quarterback leaves one hole that will
need to be filled either from green
material, or by shifting one of the
present backfield men to quarter.
This year's freshman team is turn
ing over some valuable material in
Tandy and Artman, tackles; Jones,
Cook, and Doyle, guards; Vermilya,
center; Lewis, quarterback; Smalling,
fullback; Marks, Sims, and Wilton,
halfbacks.
The University of California will not
be so lucky in retaining her star play
ers as Stanford is this year. One com
plete stellar backfield is going out:
Carlson, Dixon, Imlay, and Young.
Every one of these men will be a
great loss to the Bears' team, and can
not be replaced at a moment's notice.
At ends, Andy Smith will lose Mell,
; Thatcher, and Brown; at tackles, Sar
! gent and Cook; at guards, Carey, Rau,
: and Couper; at center, Baze. These
ilhirteen men make a large hole in the
i Bruin squad which will require a great
I deal of work to fill.

out of further play, Stanford is ex
pected to have another successful sea
son in 1926. Franklin B. Morse, former
Princeton and Ail-American halfback
so fas as to say that the game last
and well-known sports writer, has gone
Saturday was the starting point of a
series of Stanford victories.
Captain Nevers, fullback; Hunt,
guard; Solomon and Mitchell, quarter
backs; Middleton, end; Armour, guard;
Van Hook, center; and Kirwan, half
back, are the only men out of the
squad of thirty-seven who will not be
back on the field.
Hank Millage, last year's freshman
fullback, who has been out of the
game this year on account of a wrench
ed leg, is expected back in 1926, and
should turn in some good work in
Nevers' place. Patchett has been im
proving all season, and will be a con
tender for a first-string position next
year.
Robesky Great Guard
Pop Warner has been holding in re
serve one of the best linemen on his
team all season, and when Don Ro
besky goes in at guard next year, Stan
ford will see a trio in the middle of
the line that will be hard to beat: Mc-
Creery at center, Swan and Rpbesky at
guards. For tackles, Pop will have any
amount of good material. Eli Post has
been held over with Robesky, and
promises to be one of the most danger
ous men on the squad. Raffetto, who
took Ward Poulson's place in the Big
Game, still has two years, while Poul
son will be back, and Freeman, Harris,
and Everett will all make hard compe
tition.
Losing both Solomon and Mitchell at
quarterback leaves one hole that will
need to be filled either from green
material, or by shifting one of the
present backfield men to quarter.
This year's freshman team is turn
ing over some valuable material in
Tandy and Artman, tackles; Jones,
Cook, and Doyle, guards; Vermilya,
center; Lewis, quarterback; Smalling,
fullback; Marks, Sims, and Wilton,
halfbacks.
The University of California will not
be so lucky in retaining her star play
ers as Stanford is this year. One com
plete stellar backfield is going out:
Carlson, Dixon, Imlay, and Young.
Every one of these men will be a
great loss to the Bears' team, and can
not be replaced at a moment's notice.
At ends, Andy Smith will lose Mell,
; Thatcher, and Brown; at tackles, Sar
! gent and Cook; at guards, Carey, Rau,
: and Couper; at center, Baze. These
ilhirteen men make a large hole in the
i Bruin squad which will require a great
I deal of work to fill.
With but eight members of this
year's varsity football squad definitely
out of further play, Stanford is ex
pected to have another successful sea
son in 1926. Franklin B. Morse, former
Princeton and Ail-American halfback
