# CHANGES MADE BY DAVIS IN 1928 PLAY CAST
## Actors Will Stay on Campus For Play Rehearsals During Vacation 
### Isabel Schanck 
Lida Rittler, Marian Farr, and Cecil i
Doll were chosen last evening for im
portant roles in "In the Next Room,"
the mystery play to be produced by
the sophomore class under the direc
tion of Gordon Davis on December 5.
Helen Cooper, Myrtle de Vaux, and
Robert Keerl, who were originally se
lected for the parts, were obliged to
drop out of the cast because of lack
of time.
Miss Rittler will take the leading
feminine role of Lorna Webster in
place of Miss Cooper. Madame de Char
riere, Miss de Vaux's part, will be
played by Lucie Bentley, who ia moved
from the role of Julia for which she
was originally selected. Julia will be
taken by Miss Farr. Inspector Grady,
to have been played by Keerl, will be
played by Doll.
Complete Cast Given
With the changes completed, the en
tire new cast is as follows: Philip
Vantine, Baylor Brooks; Felix Armand,
Garth Winslow; James Godfrey, Mac
Lewis; Inspector Grady, Cecil Doll;
Parks, Reidar Torjussen; Rogers, Lee
Flood; Lorna Webster, Lida Rittler;
Madame de Charriere, Lucie Bentley;
and Julia, Marian Farr.
Most of the cast members are com
paratively new to campus dramatics.
Brooks had a small role in "Macbeth"
last winter, Baker was in "R. U. R.,"
and Flood was in the 1925 Ram's Head
show, "The Devil's Daughter." Win
slow and Torjussen make their Stan
ford debut in "In the Next Room."
Miss Rittler in "Gaieties"
Miss Rittler appeared in "What
Price Phi Bete," a number in the pro
! gram of the "Big Game Gaieties" pro
duced last Friday evening. Miss Bent
ley created favorable comment by her
| interpretation of the role of Mrs.
1 Coade in "Dear Brutus," given this
J summer and repeated October 23. Miss
! Farr appears on the Stanford stage
| for the first time in "In the Next
i Room."
j Because of the limited amount of
j time before production of the mystery
i play members of the cast will have to
! leave home and mother for the Thanks
j giving holidays and remain on the cam-
I pus to rehearse. Since the changes in
cast were made so late, no regular re
hearsals have been held yet this week,
so that intensive work will be neces
sary, according to Gordon Davis, dra
j matic coach, who has charge of the
I prouction.
