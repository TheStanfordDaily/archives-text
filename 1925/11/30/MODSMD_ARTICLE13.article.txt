# ANDY KERR CUTS VARSITY CAGE SQUAD TO NINETEEN
## Practice During Holidays Pleases Coach; Nevers Not Yet in Suit 
### Jim Adams 
Nineteen men constitute the varsity
j basketball squad as a result of the cut
I made before the holidays by Coach
! Andy Kerr. The men remaining on the
squad are Captain Fred Price, Ernie
Nevers, Nelson David, Ned Anderson,
Wally Jayred, Ted Shipkey, Muggs
Mitchell, Bill Clark, Herbert Christ, Al
bert Biaggini, Louis Vincenti, Ralph
Young, Wesley Bryant, Ray Taylor,
; Gil McDermott, Wally Knox, Clink
Frazier, Leo Harris, and Sam Joseph.
The majority of these candidates ex
cluding those who were on the football
squad practiced Friday and Saturday.
Ernie Nevers. may not be out for prac
i tice this quarter if his application for
| a leave is granted. The rest from train
| ing should do him good and his play
; ing on return should be marked with
i more speed and aggressiveness as a
i result.
Coach Andy Kerr put the entire
squad through a light scrimmage Sat
urday and seemed satisfied with the
j progress the men are making. When
j Kerr said that no man can be sure of
! his berth he meant it, for there are a
number of contestants for each posi
j tion and at present all appear about
I equal.
Bill Clark was being used at for
ward Saturday. Whether he is used at
| guard, center, or forward, he look 3
' good for a first-string position. There
j is some doubt about the eligibility of
! Biaggini, but if his scholarship is
; found to be satisfactory he will furnish
Young, the other leading candidate, a
| tough battle for the standing guard
position.
By the end of the week a fairly defi
-1 nite first-string five should take shape
so that the men can get in some team
work before the first game slated for
' December 12.
