! Bagshaw's Washington Huskies
| clinched the 1925 Pacific Coast Cham-1
| pionship Thanksgiving Day by defeat
; ing Oregon, conference tail-enders, 15
j to 14, in the annual "Big Game" of!
i the north.
Oregon's sudden drive toward the
! Huskie goal line failed by a narrow;
margin to bring victory. A versatile j
: aerial attack, coupled with powerful
line plunges, advanced Oregon to the
i Washington 10-yard line, but the final j
i gun prevented it from possibly chang- j
j ing the conference rating.
Washington completed its season,
barring a possible game at Pasadena,
j with five conference victories and no
I defeats and this record places Wash- \
ington with Dartmouth, Tulane, Col
gate, and Alabama as one of the lead- j
ing teams of the country. Colorado l
Aggies, Rocky Mountain conference \
.champions, and Dartmouth are the j
only major elevens which have been ,
i neither beaten nor tied this year.
Stanford remained in second place,
!U. S. C. dropped to a tie with Cali-;
| fornia with two victories and two de
l feats, Washington State's 17 to 12j
| win over the Los Angeles university
I upsetting calculations of critics who
| favored the "Thundering Herd."
No other conference games were
played, although Idaho lost to Creigh
| ton and Montana defeated Montana
State in non-conference clashes.
O. A. C. will meet U. S. C. in the
final conference clash of the season
next Saturday. A win by the Aggies
will keep the northern eleven in a
tie with Stanford for second place, j
each team having four victories and
j one defeat, the Aggies' at the hands
| of the Cards.
