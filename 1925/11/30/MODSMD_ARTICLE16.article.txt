# Enthusiastic Alumni Nabbed Chance to Make Nevers a Stanford Man
## 
### 
The lucky chance of a strong
Stanford fan in the editor's
chair in the Santa Rosa news
paper's office some four years
ago assured the presence of
Ernie Nevers on a Cardinal team,
according to a current story.
When the fame of Nevers' high
school football playing had spread
throughout the state, a delega
tion, headed by "Brick" Muller,
was sent to Santa Rosa to con
vince him of the superiority of
Berkeley and to make promises
consistent with his amateur
standing. Though the delegation
members left Nevers strongly
influenced for California, they
had forgotten the X in the equa
tion, namely the Stanford editor
in whose office they had held
their meeting.
The editor promptly sent <for
W. Finlay Geary, a Stanford man
and a great friend of Nevers.
What arguments Geary used have
never been disclosed but they
were strong enough to bring
Nevers to Stanford and give him
an opportunity to captain the first
Cardinal team that has defeated
the Bears since 1905.
