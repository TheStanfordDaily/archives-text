### 
Arthur Garfield Kennedy, assistant
professor of English philology, and
Professor John F. P. Tatlock of Har
vard University are reading final
proofs of a "Chaucerian Concordance"
which they are preparing for publica
tion before the end of next year. Pro
lessor Tatlock was a member of the
Stanford faculty before he joined that
of Harvard. He will return to Stan
ford to teach next summer quarter.
Professors Kennedy and Tatlock
have been gathering material for the
"Chaucerian Concordance" since Pro
fessor Tatlock came here in 1915. Copy
for the book was sent about two years
ago to the Carnegie Institution of
Washington which will handle the
printing.
The concordance is an outgrowth of
work begun by Professor Ewald Flu
gel, head of the Department of Eng
lish philology at Stanford from 1892
until his death in 1914. Professor Flu
gel gathered a wealth of material in
preparation for a Chaucerian concord
ance, a Chaucerian dictionary, aud a
dictionary of Middle English. Professor
Kennedy was associated with Profes
sor Flugel in his work.
Arrangements were recently made
with Professor Felix Flugel, of the
California, to send much
of the material gathered by his father
to the editors of the Middle English
dictionary, the publication of which
is being sponsored by the Modern
Language Association of America.
