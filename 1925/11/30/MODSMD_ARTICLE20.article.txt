# U.C. CROSS-COUNTRY RUN WILL NOT BE STAGED THIS YEAR
## Failure to Agree on Date Causes Postponement, Says Al Masters 
### 
California authorities have refused
|to accept December 2, or any other
i date remaining this quarter, for the
j annual cross-country run with Stan
j ford, and the meet has been definitely
I called off, it was announced today by
! Graduate Manager A1 Masters.
The cancellation of the meet is duo
I to a misunderstanding concerning the
date, and is not due to the action of
.the captain of the California team in
j writing a, public letter condemning
j Stanford's policy in the matter and
'requesting that no further cross-coun
i try meets be scheduled with the Cards,
j Masters stated.

According to Masters, November 21,
the day of the Big Game, was tenta
tively set as the date for the run. This
j action was taken several weeks ago.
j Coach Dink Templeton, however, ob
jected to this date, saying that most
of the members of his team would be
unable to run that day, because they
were working at the Big Game and
were depending upon this employment
to enable them to see the game.
Stanford then offered to meet the
California team at any other date
which might meet the approval of the
Bears. In making this offer, it was
pointed out that the meet is usually
held on the Wednesday following
Thanksgiving, which this year would
be December 2. California authorities,
however, refused to consider this date
because it was too near the final
; examinations at that school, so the
I meet was declared definitely off.

Leland A. Caya, captain of the Cali
fornia team .wrote a public letter pub-
fished in the Daily Californian and in
a San Francisco paper which said that.
"We, of the University of California
cross-country team, hope that a meet
will never again be scheduled with
; Stanford University."
lie went on to say that the meet
had been scheduled for November 21,
but that Stanford had sought to ar
| range a meet with the Sberman In
! dians for that day, and desired to post
! pone the California meet because oL'
this other meet. He objected to any
1 date after Thanksgiving Day as being
on the "eve of the California finals,"
and concluded his letter with a state
i ment that the California men not
"humble themselves by consenting to
the later date."
Argument False—Masters
This argument is not consistent with
the facts, according to Masters. Stan
ford sought to make arrangements for
a meet with the Sherman Indians as a
practice run for the Cardinal team, but
November 21 was never mentioned as
a possible date in these negotiations.
In consideration of these facts, the
California graduate manager has writ
ten an apology to Masters for the
action of Caya, stating that the Calir
i fornia authorities were in no way in
volved in the issuance of the letter
| and expressing "sincere regret" that
; the incident had occurred. "The au
j tlior of the letter will be severely
j reprimanded," the California apology
stated.
In view of this apology, there will
| be no further action taken by Stan
ford authorities in the matter. No
break in relations as regards further
cross-country meets will result, aecord
| ing to Masters.

Argument False—Masters
This argument is not consistent with
the facts, according to Masters. Stan
ford sought to make arrangements for
a meet with the Sherman Indians as a
practice run for the Cardinal team, but
November 21 was never mentioned as
a possible date in these negotiations.
In consideration of these facts, the
California graduate manager has writ
ten an apology to Masters for the
action of Caya, stating that the Calir
i fornia authorities were in no way in
volved in the issuance of the letter

; the incident had occurred. "The au
j tlior of the letter will be severely
j reprimanded," the California apology
stated.
In view of this apology, there will

ford authorities in the matter. No
break in relations as regards further
cross-country meets will result, aecord
| ing to Masters.

the day of the Big Game, was tenta
tively set as the date for the run. This
j action was taken several weeks ago.
j Coach Dink Templeton, however, ob

were working at the Big Game and
were depending upon this employment
to enable them to see the game.

California team at any other date
which might meet the approval of the
Bears. In making this offer, it was
pointed out that the meet is usually
held on the Wednesday following

however, refused to consider this date
because it was too near the final
