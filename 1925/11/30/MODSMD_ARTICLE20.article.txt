# U.C. CROSS-COUNTRY RUN WILL NOT BE STAGED THIS YEAR
## Failure to Agree on Date Causes Postponement, Says Al Masters 
### 
California authorities have refused
|to accept December 2, or any other
i date remaining this quarter, for the
j annual cross-country run with Stan
j ford, and the meet has been definitely
I called off, it was announced today by
! Graduate Manager A1 Masters.
The cancellation of the meet is duo
I to a misunderstanding concerning the
date, and is not due to the action of
.the captain of the California team in
j writing a, public letter condemning
j Stanford's policy in the matter and
'requesting that no further cross-coun
i try meets be scheduled with the Cards,
j Masters stated.
Templeton Objects
According to Masters, November 21,
the day of the Big Game, was tenta
tively set as the date for the run. This
j action was taken several weeks ago.
j Coach Dink Templeton, however, ob
jected to this date, saying that most
of the members of his team would be
unable to run that day, because they
were working at the Big Game and
were depending upon this employment
to enable them to see the game.
Stanford then offered to meet the
California team at any other date
which might meet the approval of the
Bears. In making this offer, it was
pointed out that the meet is usually
held on the Wednesday following
Thanksgiving, which this year would
be December 2. California authorities,
however, refused to consider this date
because it was too near the final
; examinations at that school, so the
I meet was declared definitely off.
