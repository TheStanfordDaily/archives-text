# An Increasing Evil

Professional football promoters have made enticing offers to Benny
Friedman, likely Ail-American quarterback candidate and Michigan cap
tain-elect, and "Cowboy" Kutsch, lowa's star halfback, to quit college
and accept positions at high salaries on professional grid aggregations.
Fortunately for the cause of college football these men have turned down
the offers.
In speaking of Friedman's case, Dr. Clarence Cook Little, president of
the University of Michigan, said, "Friedman with a year or more at the
University has too good a head to accept such an offer. I think the pro
fessional football men should be restrained in some manner from offering
contracts to college stars before they have completed their college courses."
Dr. Little has given the public food for thought in his statement. If
vigorous efforts are not made to curb the football promoter, terrific in
roads are going to be made on both the popularity and the calibre of the
college sport as it now is. As the promoters increase their capital, it will
be possible for them to make such tempting offers to college athletes that
the latter will be almost forced to drop their college work and accept for
purely financial reasons.
Football is typically a college game. Kids may become adept at base
ball while still in knee pants, but a man cannot become a real football
player until he has had the benefits of trained coaching. For that reason
brilliant football players are seldom found on college freshmen teams.
They must develop for a year or two before they are really good. If it
were not for the colleges, professional football promoters would not have
a chance â€”they cannot afford to train men, and the only way they can get
them is to select the cream of the university elevens.
For this reason Dr. Cook is absolutely right in feeling that promoters
should not be allowed to entice away college stars before they have com
pleted their education. The Daily Palo Alto goes even further and feels
that the entire scheme of professional football should be stepped on hard
by the public, athletes, universities, and legislators.
Colleges should not become training schools for professional football
players. Unless some steps are taken that is exactly what is going to hap
pen. At this time the general public has adopted a laissez-faire policy to
ward professional football. The sport fan,'and even the college graduate,
does not see that should professionalism become more popular college
football is going to be dealt a serious blow. If professional football is
able to attain the position in the sport world now held by commercial base
ball, college football will be pushed back into a secondary position, just as
college baseball is af the present time.
The fires of football professionalism have been smouldering for a num
ber of years. The appearance of "Red" Grange on the Chicago Bears has
fanned the flames into a great conflagration ; the nation has begun to show
unprecedented interest in paid football players. If Grange is successful
as a crowd-drawer, professional football will find itself upon a firm foot
ing, and then the fight of the colleges to retain their football standing will
begin. But unless they start preparing for that battle now, they are going
to lose.
