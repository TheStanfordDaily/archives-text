All hail to the conquering hero !
Santa Rosa, home of Captain Ernie Nevers, has blossomed out with a
Fourth of July and Armistice day celebration, all rolled into one in honor
of its favorite son. San Francisco sports writers have engaged rooms by
the week in Santa Rosa hotels so that they will be near to the shrine of the
conqueror while he is being feted. Ernie has a diamond ring, an Elk's
tooth, and pictures of himself exchanging confidences with Luther Bur
bank, who among other things has taken the snore out of sleep (we are
told). Photographers have had a picnic. They have forced Nevers to pose
in divers ridiculous and preposterous poses. He has milked cows, eaten
pie, and what-not.
It is reported that the bold, blond, battering back from the Cardinal
farm felt ill at ease on the platform beside the Mayor, the Superintendent
of Schools, the town capitalists, and the rest of the local celebrities. He
probably appreciated for the first time the feelings of the sundry tacklers
who have attempted to stop him.
Harry B. Smith, of the San Francisco Chronicle, said it was small
town stuff, yet he admitted that he liked the whole bumpkinish idea. No
one is worrying much about the hero himself. Those who know him can
appreciate his feeling. He has probably acquired a permanent brick red
color from constant blushing. Undoubtedly he has quivered far more in
the last week than he ever did at the thoughts of the charge of the "Four
Horsemen."
Stanford has crystallized its esteem for Nevers by placing his sweater
in the trophy room to better impress upon future generations his worth to
the University. A long, drawn out "Nevers Day" is giving the feature
sports writers a lot of blaa, but it is not helping Ernie. Better results
would be accomplished if the rah-rah was hushed and a concentrated drive
made to make the East realize his worth; so that there would be no doubt
of his making Ail-American.
