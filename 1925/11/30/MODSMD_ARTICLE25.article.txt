# Leslie P. Herth

### 
Death has cut short the promising career of Leslie Patrick Herth. Al
though only a junior in the University, he had attained an enviable posi
tion in three widely separated types of activities. He was a member of
the executive committee, a popular actor in campus dramatics, and a mem
ber of the varsity football team. When life is taken from such an indi
vidual we cannot help but shudder.
Death, to youth, is poignant—a shock. It is with difficulty that we art
able to realize the sudden break in the chain of championship—the perma
nent absence that cannot be ended. The entire student body feels this
and joins with the Daily Palo Alto in offering its sincerest sympathy tc
the bereaved parents.
