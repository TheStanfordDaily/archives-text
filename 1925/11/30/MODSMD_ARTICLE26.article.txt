Dear Billy:
I have been invited to the Sopho
more Yachting Excursion. What should
I wear? —Bo Bumel.
Dear Bo:
You should wear a swivel-neck pow
der blue yachting jacket, Class "A"
cream-color flannels, and a pair of
oversized fisherman's rubber boots. —
Billy.
P. S. Don't forget your lifesavers.

Special Wire to Cabbages—Pondo
land, South Africa.—The practice of
buying wives on credit is about to
cease. It has been found that the cash
and-carry system is best.
* * *
Although a little delayed in its ar
rival, probably due to the Mid-terms,
the Charleston has finally struck En
cina full-blast. Its pent-up fury seems
only to be more devastating, rather
than subdued, on account of the tardy
visitation.
* * *
Poor old Encina has successfully
wpathered many storms in the past
thirty years but the Charleston craze
has prospects of being its greatest
trial in history. The whole building
reverberates with the shuffling of un
controllable freshman feet. Unwary
students are in constant danger from
falling plaster.
Ht * *
The tables in the lobby have been
found to make the best stage for im
promptu demonstrations by foot-shov
ing artists. (To those who have no
ticed the apparent lack of time of the
freshman Charlestoners, we might say
that they are not really out of time
but only seem to be so because of the
"delayed response" of the unwieldy
Oxford bags.) —C. W.
* * *
'S FUNNY
I wanna be like Hans and Fritz,
Or 'Smatter Pop's three brats,
Or Chester Gump, or Ma love Pa?
Or even Mouse Ignatz
I'd like to be like Jimmy, and
Forever be all mussy.
But, most of all, to be like Gus,
And make calf eyes at Gussv!
