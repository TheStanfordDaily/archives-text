<$> Ted Elias, Jr. <*>
Stanford hoopmen are diminished
To a meagre ten and nine;
Though they've been "cut" by Andy,
Those who're left are feeling fine.
Sophs will have their annual week-end,
Plays and dances they will hold;
I had better bone for finals,
Lest from Stanford I get rolled.
Glee Club has returned to Stanford,
After an extensive tour;
Let us hope they were not ruined
By the footlights and their lure.
Mills and College of Pacific
Meet Euphronia in debate;
Wednesday night, December second,
Is the double-header's date.
And at last for your diversion,
Final Exes roll around,
Holidays are now approaching;
Why the dismal, dreary sound?
