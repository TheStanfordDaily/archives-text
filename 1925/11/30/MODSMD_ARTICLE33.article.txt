# STANFORD R. O. T. C. MORE THAN DOUBLES SIZE IN TWO YEARS
## Due to Improved Equipment, Changed Public Opinion, Says Major Keliher 
### 
Stanford University's Reserve Offl- j
cers Training Corps has greatly in
creased in popularity during the last
two years, as is shown by an increased
enrollment averaging 200 students
since 1923. The enrollment for the
three quarters of 1923-24 averaged less
than 150, while the total this quarter
is 326, with prospects for a greater j
number in the succeeding quarters.
The increase in enrollment has been
caused, says Major Keliher, by the ad-1
dition and improvement of equipment
and by a gradual lessening of the re- j
action against things military which
came after the World War. The latest
addition to the equipment was a ship
ment of sixteen horses from the re
mount station at Fort Douglas, near j
Salt Lake City, Utah. These horses
are being broken in and trained by ;
men in advanced classes.
Major Keliher states that though
this is a splendid increase, the enroll- j
mentis far less than in most places, |
because Stanford membership in the j
R. O. T. C.is optional with the stu
dent, while in state institutions a cer- j
tain amount of military work is re
quired of evory man. Major Keliher j
says that, due to this same reason, the
personnel of the local military divi-â– 
sion is much higher than in the ma I
jority of other units because the men
who take the work are interested.
Horsemanship and polo are two at
tractions in the Military department, j
and influence many students to take j
the science and tactics courses. Dur
ing the first quarter these students
devote a large portion of their time ;
to learning how to saddle and bridle j
horses, how to take care of them, and j
how to ride correctly. Elementary tac-1
tics and battery drill as cannoners are i
also taught to first-year men. Later in 1
the year the beginners take up'
mounted reconnaissance, harnessing
artillery horses, use of firing instru
ments, and a basic course in materiel,
with a French 75 mm. gun as the sub
ject.
Advanced students take higher equi-1
tation, advanced battery drill, artillery :
firing, aad theoretical courses in topo
graphy in the fall quarter. In the fol
lowing quarters they receive ins true- j
tion in reconnaissance, pistol prac
tice, drill as instructors, and military
law and administration.
About forty men are on the polo!
squad, which is divided into two parts; 1
one composed of experienced men
forming the regular team, the other
of less experienced men and begin
ners. All men are eligible for the squad
after they have completed the ele
mentary equitation courses.
