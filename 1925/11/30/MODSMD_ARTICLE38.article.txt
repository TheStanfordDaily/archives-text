# MUSICIANS' DAY IS ALMOST HERE, SAYS FAMOUS VIOLINIST
## Leo Linder Claims Outlook For Future of American Music Is Bright 
### Herbert Klein 
I "I make this prediction concerning
| the future of music in America: the
day of the brilliant virtuoso is almost
over and the American public will be
i demanding musicians rather than
mere technical experts whose perform
ances amazed the eye and ear but do
not touch the heart," said Leo Linder,
violinist, when interviewed on his
! views concerning the music of today,
j Linder has given many recitals on the
| Peninsula in the past year, during
i which time he has lived iir Palo Alto.
: Next Wednesday he leaves for the
East, where' he will give several con
\ certs before going to Europe where he
; has concerts scheduled in London,
I Paris, Berlin, Vienna, and other musi
cal centers. He will also study while
| abroad under the European teachers.
"A fault of many modern composers
is that they break too completely with
i the past, rejecting all tradition simply
I because it is tradition and not con
! sidering whether it is good or not.
Music, above all, must be sound, in
structive; it must have breadth and
meaning. This applies to the music of
the modernists as well as any others,"
said Linder, who has studied and
played almost every modern composi
tion for the violin in the past five
years.
Linder's musical education was ob
tained in Munich, Vienna, and Paris.
"America Talented"
Linder is optimistic concerning
America as a source of great artists:
"This country is teeming with talent,
; there is abundant material for an out
! standing group of performers and a
need for a genuinely American school
of composers. Americans have shown
musical ability and if they are given
facilities for study and prove they have
the concentration, which many would
be American musicians lack, they
should be the equal of any artists in
the world.
"The same energy and devotion
which have made this country sup
reme in athletic sports could, if ap
plied in the sphere of music, do away
with the present system by which
many European artists, with little or
no sympathy for the ideals of this
country, regard their American tours
simply as a sort of gold mine to fur
nish them with funds to develop their
j art for their own countries' benefit,
j That American musicians cannot be
the ecjuals of importations is an er
j ronious belief and is one that is dis
| appearing." â€¢ *
Turning to the subject of American
composers, Linder said: "We shall
know the exact contribution of the
moderns only when some genius ar

rives and, basing his work upon what
has been done already, gives us a
great, new style of.music. He will be
the one who will bring order out of
the present chaos in the same way
that Bach based his epoch-making
works on what had gone before him.
Future Style Uncertain
"I do not know what the style of
the future music will be. There is no
one who can predict it.
"I think that much of the work of
popular composers, notably George
Gershwin, has great vitality, and
these composers would have possibili
ties if their efforts were turned to
ward an expressive rather than a
purely commercial and money-making
type of music. Take Gershwin's "Rhap
sody in Blue" for example, the only
jazz work of a type that can be con
sidered in comparison with good music
of the past.
"The 'Rhapsody' shows originality,
novel rhythmic effects, and a fresh
ness that is very attractive. A work
like this is on a par, to my mind, with
some of the things that composers
like Dvorak wrote, and is far better
than the efforts of many of the lesser
classical composers.
"As yet, however, the superiority
of the classical music is proved by
the way that both public and musi
cians still turn to it in preference to
most of the modern efforts."
