# ABRAMS WRITES BOOK ON FAR WEST FLORA
## 
### 
One of the recent publications of
the Stanford University Press is Vol
ume I of "Illustrated Flora of the
Pacific States," by Dr. Leroy Abrams,
professor of botany. Volume I deals
with "Ophioglossaceae to Aristoloclii'j
ceae" (Ferns to Birthwordts). Volumes
II and 111 are now in preparation.
This set of books will serve a dual
purpose by providing a botany of
scientific completeness and accuracy,
and supplying the first thorough classi
fication of the flora of a section long
neglected by botanists, the Pacific
Coast. The work is the second illus
trated and comprehensive volume on
flora published in the United States
and is modeled after its classical pre
decessor, "Illustrated Flora of the
United States and Canada," by Britton
and Brown. Every species of fern,
flower, tree, and shrub known to grow
wild in Washington, Oregon, and Cali
fornia is illustrated and described.
