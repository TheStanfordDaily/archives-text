# HARD PRACTICE PROGRAM UNDERGONE BY PLAY CAST
## 
### Isabel Schanck 
Following the schedule used by pro
fessional stock companies, rehearsals
for the sophomore play, "In the Next
Room," were held morning and after
noon during the Thanksgiving lioli
days, under the direction of Gordon
Davis, dramatic coach. Due to changes
in the cast made in the latter part of
last week, intensive

rehearsals were ne
cessitated in order
to have the mys
tery play ready for
production by next
Saturday, when its
presentation will
close festivities of
Sophomore Week.
Pledges not to
r6veal the secret of
the plot of "In the
Next Room" are

Gordon Davis being signed by
members of the
cast and the sophomore play commit
tee to guaial against letting the secret

out. Admittance to rehearsals is al
lowed only by means of a pass signed
by Davis, thus barring the usual co
terie of campus stage followers who
generally watch the progress of the
play in this manner.
"In the Next Room" is the first mys
tery play to be introduced at Stanford
in ten years and is appearing for the
first time in California. Its success is
assured because of its novelty as a
type of play for campus presentation,
and its character as a mystery. The
melodrama concerns educated people,
not underworld characters, and the
plot is convincing.
Several new actors will make their
debut on the campus stage in "In the
Next Room," including Marian Farr,
Mac Lewis, and Cecil Doll. Baylor
Brooks, Frank Baker, and Lida Rittler
have had small roles in previous pro
ductions here. Lucie Bentley, who
takes the role of Madame de Charriere,
handled a character study capably in
her interpretation of Mrs. Coade in
"Dear Brutus" given October 23.
