# EUPHRONIA TO MEET TEAMS FROM MILLS, COLLEGE OF PACIFIC
## Forensic Contests Here and At Stockton Planned For Debaters 
### 
Mills College and the College of
the Pacific will be the two opponents
of Euplironia Debating Society in two
debates which will be held Wednes
day night here and at Stockton.
"Resolved, That the freedom of the
younger generation is a serious men
ace" will be the subject for the Eu
plironia-Mills contest which will be
held on the campus. Harold W. Peter
son and Herbert F. Smith will uphold
the affirmative for the Stanford de
baters. This question has been ar
ranged in place of the topic involving
censorship of student publications
which had previously been chosen
for the contest.
The second forensic contest sched
uled for Euplironia Wednesday will
be held at Stockton. Euplironia, repre
sented by Charles F. Prael and John
A. Lieter, will uphold the negative of
the question, "Resolved, That there
should be censorship of student pub
lications." This question has been se
lected for the contest by the Debate
League, of which Euplironia is a mem
ber, because of the recent contro
versies in college circles regarding
student publications. Suppression of
the "Occident," California literary
magazine, by Berkeley authorities,
and the faculty censorship of articles
in the student paper at Idaho Tech are
two recent conflicts on this subject.
