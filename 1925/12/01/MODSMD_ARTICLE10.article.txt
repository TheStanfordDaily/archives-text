# WEBFOOTERS NEARLY TIE DARTMOUTH FOR WORLD GRID TITLE
## 
### 
Oregon, although losing all five con
ference encounters, came within two
points of tieing the undefeated Dart
mouth eleven for the championship of
the world, according to the football
dope of an ardent Oregonian.
The Webfooter's claims are based
on the following: Suppose that Oregon
defeated Washington; the Huskies
have mastered California, Stanford,
and W- S. C.; Stanford having van
quished O. A. C. and Southern Cali
fornia, Oregon would remain poten
tially the champions of the Pacific
Coast Conference for Idaho and Mon
tana have already bowed to the Trojan
attack.
In addition Washington tied Nebras
ka, Nebraska beat Illinois, Illinois
trounced Pennsylvania, Penn won from
Yale, Yale defeated the Army, the
West Pointers trimmed Notre Dame,
Notre Dame defeated Minnesota, and
the Minnesotans lead the Big Ten.
Therefore, all the Webfootera would
have had to do would be to play and
defeat Dartmouth, and be acclaimed
the 1925 football champions of the
world.
However, Oregon's final game, that
with Washington, Pacific Coast Con
ference champions and one of the na
tion's leading elevens, was a heart
breaker for Oregon to lose, as her
drive for the winning touchdown
failed only because of the timekeeper's
shot. Washington won, 15-14, and re
mains undefeated along with Dart
mouth, Tulane, Colgate, Alabama, and
the Colorado Aggies, while the Web
footers stow their football togs away
after a disastrous season.
