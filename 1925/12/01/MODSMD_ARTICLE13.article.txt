# INDEPENDENT STUDY PLAN ADOPTED FOR ADVANCED STUDENTS
## New System to Demand More Initiative and Effort Of Selected Group 
### 
Definite adoption of the Independent
Study Plan by Stanford University
lias been announced by Lewis M. Ter
: man, chairman of the Independent
! Study Plan committee. Final plans for
its organization have been drawn up
Iby the committee which consists of
Lewis M. Terman, professor of psych
ology; Albert L. Guerard, professor of
general literature; Ernest G. Martin,
professor of physiology, and Robert
i E. Swain, professor of chemistry.
This plan provides special opportun
; ity for students of exceptional ability.
Although an average grade of "B"
will be considered as evidence of the
fitness of the student to pursue inde
pendent study, fitness will not be
judged solely on grades. General abil
ity, earnestness, and intellectual initi
ative are considered the most import
ant prerequisites.
Students with consent of the major
department or school and with the ap
-1 proval of the Committee on Independ
j ent Study may enroll under the Inde
pendent Study Plan at the beginning
lof their junior year or any quarter
j thereafter. Each student is to have a
faculty member of his major depart
ment as a special advisor, who is to
map out a detailed course of study, to
supervise the student's work under
this plan, and test his accomplishment
from time to time.
No Class Attendance
The student is released in general
from the usual demands of class at
i tendance, although it is urged, by the
committee, that class work be not
i 1 entirely neglected, and it may be re
quired in certain instances. The prog
ress and accomplishment of each stu
! dent in his chosen field of study will
be promoted and tested by frequent
i conferences with his adviser, and by
reports, theses, and tests, as the ad-
I viser may require, culminating imme
diately before graduation by written
| examinations covering the whole field
of study.
At the end of each quarter, the ad
viser will file reports of the students'
progress with the registrar, although
; no definite grades will be given. Any
! student wishing to transfer to another
university may have his grades evalu
ated at the end of any quarter.
Quarters for Completion
The normal time for completing the
j work under the Independent Study
; Plan is six quarters in residence. How-
