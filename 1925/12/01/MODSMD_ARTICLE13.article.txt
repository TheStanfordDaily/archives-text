### 
Definite adoption of the Independent
Study Plan by Stanford University
lias been announced by Lewis M. Ter
: man, chairman of the Independent
! Study Plan committee. Final plans for
its organization have been drawn up
Iby the committee which consists of
Lewis M. Terman, professor of psych
ology; Albert L. Guerard, professor of
general literature; Ernest G. Martin,
professor of physiology, and Robert
i E. Swain, professor of chemistry.
This plan provides special opportun
; ity for students of exceptional ability.
Although an average grade of "B"
will be considered as evidence of the
fitness of the student to pursue inde
pendent study, fitness will not be
judged solely on grades. General abil
ity, earnestness, and intellectual initi
ative are considered the most import
ant prerequisites.
Students with consent of the major
department or school and with the ap
-1 proval of the Committee on Independ
j ent Study may enroll under the Inde
pendent Study Plan at the beginning
lof their junior year or any quarter
j thereafter. Each student is to have a
faculty member of his major depart
ment as a special advisor, who is to
map out a detailed course of study, to
supervise the student's work under
this plan, and test his accomplishment
from time to time.
No Class Attendance
The student is released in general
from the usual demands of class at
i tendance, although it is urged, by the
committee, that class work be not
i 1 entirely neglected, and it may be re
quired in certain instances. The prog
ress and accomplishment of each stu
! dent in his chosen field of study will
be promoted and tested by frequent
i conferences with his adviser, and by
reports, theses, and tests, as the ad-
I viser may require, culminating imme
diately before graduation by written
| examinations covering the whole field
of study.
At the end of each quarter, the ad
viser will file reports of the students'
progress with the registrar, although
; no definite grades will be given. Any
! student wishing to transfer to another
university may have his grades evalu
ated at the end of any quarter.
Quarters for Completion
The normal time for completing the
j work under the Independent Study
; Plan is six quarters in residence. How-
ever, in the ease of those students
whose work has been consistently
superior, It will be possible to take
the final examinations at the end of
the fifth quarter.
The Independent Study Plan is -op
tional witli the various schools and de
partments of Uie University. Thus far
it has been adopted by the Depart
ments of Education, English, Germanic
Languages. History, Mining and Metal
lurgy, Philosophy, Physics, Political
Science, Psychology, and Romanic
Languages.
Sophomores to Apply
All students interested in enrolling
in the Independent Study Plan should
procure application blanks from the
registrar's office and submit them to
the executive head of his major de
partment. The applications are then
acted upon by the major department
and, if approved, a members of the
department staff is appointed as the
student's adviser. The adviser and
student outline a program of study suf
ficient to complete the requirements
for an A.B. degree. The study program
must be approved by the major depart
ment and the Committee on Independ
ent Study. Students should apply at
the last quarter of their sophomore
year. After the current academic year,
the latest possible time for enrollment
will be the beginning of the senior
year, but during 1925-26, enrollment
will be permitted during the last two
quarters of the senior year.
Students whose work under the In
dependent Study Plan is unsatisfac
tory will be required to return to the
ordinary program. Any student may
voluntarily return to the ordinary pro
gram at the end of his junior year by
giving notice to that effect.
