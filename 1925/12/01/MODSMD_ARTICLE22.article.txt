# Cross Cross-Countrymen

The recent flareup over the annual Stanford-U.C. cross-country meet
lias gone up in smoke and nothing remains but the assurance of A1 Masters,
"graduate manager, that the Cardinals and Bears will not race over the long
course this quarter at least. Misunderstanding between the authorities as
to the date on which to hold the meet and an indignant letter written in
haste by Captain Cava of the California cross-country varsity resulted in
the unwarranted trouble.
Things looked for a moment as though complications similar in effect
to those concerning boxing might arise, but a timely apology from Cali
fornia together with the statement that Caya will be reprimanded averted
the possibility of discontinuing cross-country racing between teams of the
two universities.
From Masters' statement it appears that the whole matter was simply
one of smoke with so little fire as to make it negligible and that the only
way to set things right is to choose a date sometime next quarter so that
the teams may fight it out â€”and then forget about it.
