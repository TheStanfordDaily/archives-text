.A Stanford man recently left his very "collegiate" cut-down automo
bile in the arboretum overnight. The next morning he went to get it only
to find that it had been completely stripped—tires, rims, battery, and every
thing worth taking was gone. The car itself is probably not worth as much
as new rubber for it would cost —so the owner has offered to teach the
thief how to run the car and to give it to him, providing that he is willing
to come back to get it. This will at least remove an eyesore from the
arboretum.
It must have taken almost an hour to strip the car, and had there been
a watchman making his rounds during that time he would have come upon
the thief and apprehended him. This is just an example of the petty
thievery which is continually bothering campus residents. A properly or
ganized police force would do much toward suppressing the practice.
