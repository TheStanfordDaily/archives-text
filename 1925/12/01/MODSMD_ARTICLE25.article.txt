# Big Ten Blue Law
## 
### 
The University of Chicago women are the most free from faculty
supervision, while those of Wisconsin are the most restrained in the Big
Ten universities, according to a comparative survey recently appearing in
the Ohio State Lantern.
The chairman of the Chicago Women's Council feels that it is impos
sible to have uniform rules for Chicago's women students. She considers
the Chicago woman "responsible and self respecting" and so lays down no
rules for them. At Wisconsin, on the other hand, the curfew rings at 9:30.
Several of the universities have Blue Sundays. Sunday dancing is a
misdemeanor. At Purdue both dancing and card playing are taboo in
women's living groups. All Big Ten Universities require their women
students to register their trips out of town, including the destination, type
of transportation, and chaperons.
