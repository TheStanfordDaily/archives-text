HOW I TURNED INTO A GORILLA
It was our great opportunity, our
best chance to win social standing.;
My wife and I had been invited to the
Smithson-Jones' dinner. If we could
only make ourselves known our posi
tion in society would be assured.
I had acted in my most cultured
manner, I thought. I had taken every
care to use the right fork for my
salad. I had strived to converse pleas- i
antly and intelligently with everyone. !
even the maid. The evening had ap-1
parently gone off successfully. There;
was no hint that I had done anything
wrong except the fact that I noticed
Mrs: Smithson-Jones look at me in a
rather astonished manner once or
twice, but foolishly enough I thought
that it was my brilliant conversation
that attracted her attention. Not until
the butler refused to scratch my back
did I suspect that anything was wrong,
and then, alas, too late.
We were hardly outside of the door!
when my wife commenced upon me.
"I was never so petrified in my life,"
was her first remark. Then she ex
plained to me just what I had done.
All of a sudden it dawned upon me
iike a flash of lightning out of a clear
sky and the sun rose on my fog bank
of ignorance.
Throws Olive Seeds
How should I have known that it
was impolite to throw olive seeds at
the host? How was I to tell that so-i
ciety soup is not musical? I tucked the
corner of my napkin in my collar to j
protect my good suit as I had been:
taught to do at home. I had made the
dreadful mistake of eating the paper
cup in which the creamed sweetbreads j
were served.
•In a moment of carelessness I had
tipped a tumbler of ice water into the
lap of the lady sitting next to me and j
had then run out into the kitchen
shouting for a dish towel. I had eaten
all the pickles in the dish in front of!
me without passing them on and I had
taken three helpings of turkey when .
I should have taken only one.
Mistakes Cup for Saucer
How was I to know that peas are
not to be eaten with a knife nor cake
with the face. I had always supposed it j
a clever trick to pour coffee into a
saucer to cool it, and then to drink j
it from the saucer without spilling a I
drop. I had made all these mistakes 1
and many more without realizing that
I had done anything wrong. I was a j
gorilla, but I didn't, know it.
Then I remembered a little book I
had seen advertised in the Police
Gazette. I resolved to cut the coupon
out at once and mail it in without
obligation to myself. Now I know that!
it is wrong to draw lines on the table-!

parently gone off successfully. There;
was no hint that I had done anything
wrong except the fact that I noticed
Mrs: Smithson-Jones look at me in a
rather astonished manner once or
twice, but foolishly enough I thought
that it was my brilliant conversation
that attracted her attention. Not until
the butler refused to scratch my back
did I suspect that anything was wrong,

We were hardly outside of the door!
when my wife commenced upon me.
"I was never so petrified in my life,"
was her first remark. Then she ex
plained to me just what I had done.

iike a flash of lightning out of a clear
sky and the sun rose on my fog bank
of ignorance.
Throws Olive Seeds
How should I have known that it
was impolite to throw olive seeds at
the host? How was I to tell that so-i
ciety soup is not musical? I tucked the
corner of my napkin in my collar to j
protect my good suit as I had been:
taught to do at home. I had made the
dreadful mistake of eating the paper
cup in which the creamed sweetbreads j
were served.
•In a moment of carelessness I had
tipped a tumbler of ice water into the
lap of the lady sitting next to me and j
had then run out into the kitchen
shouting for a dish towel. I had eaten
all the pickles in the dish in front of!
me without passing them on and I had
taken three helpings of turkey when .
I should have taken only one.
Mistakes Cup for Saucer
How was I to know that peas are
not to be eaten with a knife nor cake
with the face. I had always supposed it j
a clever trick to pour coffee into a
saucer to cool it, and then to drink j
it from the saucer without spilling a I
drop. I had made all these mistakes 1
and many more without realizing that
I had done anything wrong. I was a j
gorilla, but I didn't, know it.
Then I remembered a little book I
had seen advertised in the Police
Gazette. I resolved to cut the coupon
out at once and mail it in without
obligation to myself. Now I know that!
