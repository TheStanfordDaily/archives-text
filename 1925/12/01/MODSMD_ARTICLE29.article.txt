The Editor, Sir:
I read your recent editorial regard- j
ing "Red" Grange and his entrance
into professional football. Your oriti-j
cism I thing was the most uncalled-for
article I have ever read. It was really
extremely narrow and without proper
knowledge of the facts. Coach Zuppke;
says that he will see to it that Grange!
never graduates. What difference does
it make? A diploma is merely a certifi
cate of approval on the work you have
done in the university. If a man leaves,
a university satisfied that he has got-:
ten everything out of it, it certainly is j
a good deal more than a diploma. How
ever, if you read Zuppke's statement ■
correctly you will see that he did not
make the statement that he would
prevent Grange's graduating, hut
merely that he thought Grange would
not return and graduate.
You say that he has betrayed "faith" j
in leaving amateur athletics. Believe
me, I spent twenty months on the j
front line in France and I have come,
to the conclusion that faith is faith
in one's self and certainly not in a lbt i
of "petty larceny" ethics and so-called j
ideals, drummed up by a lot of officials i
and coaches, who hold soft jobs in
amateur circles. Grange, in giving his
reasons for entering professional foot-!
ball, said: "I am going into profession-j
al football because it is the thing 11
can do best, and what the public will
appreciate most. Also to help my i
brother through college and to repay l
my father." He also added that he was
going to cash in on his publicity be- 1
cause ten years from now nobody Willi
be interested in his football, but con-j
cerned in knowing how much money!
he has. As for professional football it !
will eventually replace college foot
ball, due to the fact that college foot- j
ball has too much legislation and too.
much hard work connected with it, in
comparison to the benefits received. 1
As for Oberlander, his father is con- j
nected with the International Harves
ter Company in Chicago and also di
rector in Lee-Higginson and Company,
one of the richest concerns in Boston.
As for meting out punishment in
the shape of not considering his name
for an all-American eleven—it is to
laugh—how are men considered for all- i
American teams? By their ability on
the football field or their future occu
pations? An all-American team is an
empty honor at best. Who can recall i
the all-American guards of 1923? Per
sonally I am glad that he entered
professional football and will end with
saying "Power to his elbow."
Sincerely yours,
Marshall Boone, '26.

cate of approval on the work you have
done in the university. If a man leaves,
a university satisfied that he has got-:
ten everything out of it, it certainly is j
a good deal more than a diploma. How
ever, if you read Zuppke's statement ■
correctly you will see that he did not
make the statement that he would
prevent Grange's graduating, hut
merely that he thought Grange would
not return and graduate.
You say that he has betrayed "faith" j
in leaving amateur athletics. Believe
me, I spent twenty months on the j
front line in France and I have come,
to the conclusion that faith is faith
in one's self and certainly not in a lbt i
of "petty larceny" ethics and so-called j
ideals, drummed up by a lot of officials i
and coaches, who hold soft jobs in
amateur circles. Grange, in giving his
reasons for entering professional foot-!
ball, said: "I am going into profession-j
al football because it is the thing 11
can do best, and what the public will
appreciate most. Also to help my i
brother through college and to repay l
my father." He also added that he was

comparison to the benefits received. 1
As for Oberlander, his father is con- j

rector in Lee-Higginson and Company,
one of the richest concerns in Boston.
As for meting out punishment in
the shape of not considering his name
for an all-American eleven—it is to
laugh—how are men considered for all- i
American teams? By their ability on
the football field or their future occu
pations? An all-American team is an
empty honor at best. Who can recall i
the all-American guards of 1923? Per

professional football and will end with

The Editor, Sir:
I read your recent editorial regard- j
ing "Red" Grange and his entrance
into professional football. Your oriti-j
cism I thing was the most uncalled-for
article I have ever read. It was really
extremely narrow and without proper
knowledge of the facts. Coach Zuppke;
says that he will see to it that Grange!
never graduates. What difference does
it make? A diploma is merely a certifi
cate of approval on the work you have
done in the university. If a man leaves,
a university satisfied that he has got-:
ten everything out of it, it certainly is j
a good deal more than a diploma. How
