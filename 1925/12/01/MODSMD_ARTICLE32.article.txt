## Late King of Siam Presents Volumes of Bhudda to American Colleges 
### 
Eleven volumes of the sacred books
of Siam dealing with the life ol
Bhudda and corresponding in the Sia
mese religion to the gospels of the
Christian religion, have recently beei:
received by the Library.
Copies of these volumes have beer
presented by the late king of Siam tc
a number of American colleges in
honor of the queen mother and the
queen aunt, both of whom have recent
ly celebrated their sixtieth birthdays,
Includes Bhuddist Scriptures
The "Jallattliakatha," a set of ten
volumes, includes part of the Bhud
dist scriptures. It is written in Siamese
characters taken from the Pali. The
eleventh volume, the "Milindepandha,"
contains another division of the sacred
scriptures and certain of the sacred
acrostics. This volume was presented
by Her Royal Highness Krom Khun
Suddha Sunnardh.
These scriptures have a very pro
found meaning in Siamese life. The
Siamese are strong Bhu<l|lists, and
pride themselves on their orthodoxy.
In some of the most highly educated
groups, there is at present an element
of skepticism. However, most of the
men of Siam still comply with ancient
usage and don the yellow robe of
priesthood for a few months at least.
This custom prevails even among the
young princes who are sent to Europe
for their education.
Ancient Alphabet
These volumes are written in the
ancient Siamese characters derived
from the Cambodian script which was
in turn taken from the alphabet of
inscriptions used on the stone monu
ments of India during the sixth and
eighth centuries. The Siamese script
ic written from left to right. In manu
script there is no space left between
words, but punctuation is indicated by
isolating certain phrases and sen
tences.
There are forty-four consonants in
the Siamese alphabet, in each one of
which the sound "aw" is inherent.
The thirty-two vowels are not marked
by individual letters but signs above
them. Siamese was originally a mono
syllabic language, and now contains
very few words over two syllables, al
thought it has adopted many words
from the Indian and Chinese language.
In addition to the usual Siamese dia
lects, the Siamese have a totally dif
ferent language to use to royalty. This
"palace language" originated in the
effort to escape anything vulgar or
ambiguous in speaking to the "sacred"
king.

Ancient Alphabet
These volumes are written in the
ancient Siamese characters derived
from the Cambodian script which was
in turn taken from the alphabet of
inscriptions used on the stone monu
ments of India during the sixth and
eighth centuries. The Siamese script
ic written from left to right. In manu
script there is no space left between
words, but punctuation is indicated by
isolating certain phrases and sen
tences.
There are forty-four consonants in
the Siamese alphabet, in each one of
which the sound "aw" is inherent.
The thirty-two vowels are not marked
by individual letters but signs above
them. Siamese was originally a mono
syllabic language, and now contains
very few words over two syllables, al
thought it has adopted many words
from the Indian and Chinese language.
In addition to the usual Siamese dia
lects, the Siamese have a totally dif
ferent language to use to royalty. This
"palace language" originated in the
effort to escape anything vulgar or
ambiguous in speaking to the "sacred"
king.
