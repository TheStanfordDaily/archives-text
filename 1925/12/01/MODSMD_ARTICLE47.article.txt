# "PRINCETON SIMILAR TO STANFORD" SAYS PRESIDENT WILBUR
## 
### 
"Stanford is more like Princeton than
any of the other eastern colleges in its or
ganization of living groups and system of
dormitories," said President Wilbur in an
interview, when asked what college in the
east resembled Stanford. "However," he
continued, "Stanford is unique in that no
other university has quite the isolation
from a town or city that it has. Harvard
and Yale are located in and bound up in
the towns which grew up with them.
Stanford is independent of any town.
Quarter System Used
"Cornell and Chicago are similar to
Stanford in their organization of depart
ments and in the use of the quarter sys
tem, and in the case of Chicago, the ar
rangement of the summer quater.
"Stanford is more like the large univer
sities of the east, than the smaller colleges.
Institutions in the east with a student
body the size of Stanford are colleges;
Stanford is a university. That is, we
specialize more in graduate work. Our
requirements befcome departmental re
quirements after the first two years. Col
leges the size of Stanford in the east have
these requireements through the whole
four years.
Diversity Desired
"Because we have a small student body,
large amounts of the same type of equip
ment is not needed; therefore diversity is
striven for, and this makes Stanford one
of the best equipped universities in the
United States."
He stated further that most of the east
ern colleges drew their students from
preparatory schools, while Stanford is
getting its students more and more from
junior colleges. Harvard lias found tliat
students admitted from public schools
were doing better on the average than
those from private schools, showing that
special training for entrance received in
the private schools does not help much in
the later work in the college.
