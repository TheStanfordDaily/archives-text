# SOPHOMORES RAISE COTILLION CEILING FOR BALL FRIDAY
## 
### 
Twenty sophomores, working under
the direction of John 13. Craig, San
Francisco decorator who has contract
ed for the 1925 Cotillion decorations,
last night raised the artificial ceiling
for the Cotillion following varsity
basketball practice in the pavilion.
Although the side-curtains for the
affair cannot be set into place until
after the varsity basketball practice
Wednesday night, Edward White,
sophomore president, asks that Ml
sophomores help in building the panel
framework and in preparing the cur
tains.
Like Jubilee Decorations
Craig has prepared a decorative
scheme for the affair similar to that
of the Diamond Jubilee held at the
Claremont Hotel in Oakland. Tied and
dyed curtains will be hung from the
girders of the pavilion, while the ceil
ing will be placed above the dance
floor as high as possible in order to
avoid the dust and poor breathing
conditions caused by low ceilings in
past dances. A garden wall will sur
round the base of the curtain, while a
fifteen-pfece orchestra conducted by
Rudy Sieger will play from a stand
opposite the pavilion entrance.
' The spotlights used in lighting the
structure will be directed down the
curtain walls, thus giving lighting and
color effect on the tied and dyed cloth.
One end of the gallery will be left
open for the roughs.
Ten Tickets Left
A few remaining tickets for the af
fair, which is the most important so
cial function of the autumn quarter,
are 011 sale at the Stanford Bookstore.
Tom Hush, who is directing the
Cotillion for the class of 1928, has an
nounced that two detectives will be
present in order to prevent any theft
of articles at the dance. Two expensive
Spanish shawls were taken last year.
