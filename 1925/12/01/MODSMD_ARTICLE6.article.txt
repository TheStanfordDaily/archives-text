# JUNIORS HUMBLE SENIOR CAGE FIVE IN OPENING GAME
## Winners Come From Behind In Second Period to Score Final Points 
### 
Trailing by a 3 to 5 score at the
' half, the juniors staged a comeback to
; win over the seniors 10 to 7 in the
opening game of the interclass basket
| ball series played yesterday afternoon
; in Encina gymnasium. Rodney George
of the 1927 team starred as high-point
man for the juniors, scoring five of
] their ten points. In a ragged prelimin
j ary contest, the junior "goofs" out
j played the senior 4 to 2.
I In the first half the teamwork of the
! seniors was superior, but they could not
! get into their stride. Alexander drop
| ped one in near the start, and Harlow
j followed later with a shot from the
I foul line, making the score 3 to 0 for
j the seniors. Menzies of the juniors
I scored 1 on a free throw. About quarter
time, the seniors sent in a new line-up.
After a hard rush, Knox sank a shot,
j swelling the senior score to five. Short
jly before the half-time gun, Evans
J looped one for the juniors, leaving the
I score 3 to 5 for the seniors.
'27 Starts Comeback
In the second period, the 1927 men
started a whirlwind rush against the
original senior line-up. Passing and
■ basket-shooting were poor on both
sides, but the juniors soon broke
through the heavy senior guards for
three tallies. George scored the first
one as the lights went out, but they
flickered on again in time to show the
ball falling through the hoop.
The whistle had not been blown, so
the tally was counted against the pro
tests of the seniors. George scored
again on a free throw, and was shortly
followed by Menzies with a field goal.
Again George scored, boosting the
j total to ten. Cliff Hey sank a final
j basket for the seniors before the gun,
j leaving the 1927 men on the long end
of the 10 to 7 score.
