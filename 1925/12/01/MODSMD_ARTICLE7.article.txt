# "MAIL EARLY" PLEA OF POSTAL AUTHORITIES
## 
### 
An appeal has been made by the
United States Postal Department to
the people throughout the country to
mail early, so the postal authorities
and employes can be given a holiday
on Christmas day.
This is the first time in the history
of the postal department that a holi
day lias been attempted on Christmas,
but it is being tried this year with a
view to continuing the custom if any
degree of success is obtained. No
mail or packages, except special de
livery letters, will be sent out from
any postoffice on the holiday. So, in
order to be sure of having tilings ar
rive for Christmas, people are urged
to mail early and correctly.
In view of the general business con
ditions throughout the country it is
probable that the volume of mail dur
ing the approaching holiday season
will greatly exceed that of any previ
ous year.
