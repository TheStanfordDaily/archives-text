# WORKERS NEEDED TO DECORATE FOR SOPHOMORE DANCE
## "COMPS" OUT TOMORROW Final Preparations Will Be Made for Cotillion in Next Two Days 
### 
With only two days remaining in
â– which to complete decorations for the
annual sophomore cotillion which will
lie held Friday evening, Edward
White, president of the class of 1928,
asks all sophomores to report to the
pavilion tonight, tomorrow afternoon,
and tomorrow evening. Compliment
ary tickets to members of the sopho
more week-end committee will be dis
tributed Thursday.
Although workers have been prepar
ing the side curtains for the cotillion,
varsity basketball has prevented the
hanging of the side curtains or the
fastening of the artificial ceiling in
place. The pavilion baskets will be
raised immediately following the var
sity practice this evening, allowing the
workers to hang the side walls and
prepare the lights.
Programs for the cotillion will be
distributed tomorrow from the Stan
ford Bookstore. Tickets for the dance
must be presented at this time. Sev
eral bids are still on sale at the Book
store. No refunds will be allowed on
tickets, according to an announcement
by Harry Nolan, student manager.
A buffet supper will be served be
tween the sixth and seventh dances.
The committee has decided to serve
refreshments in the pavilion in order
to avoid difficulties arising on account
of inclement weather when the En
cina dining halls have been used.
Rudy Sieger will appear in person
at 10 o'clock, although the cotillion
fifteen-piece novelty orchestra will play
from 9 to 1 o'clock. Nine dances will
be on the program. Sieger has made
a specialty of novelty numbers and
has arranged a special program for
this dance.
Patrons for the cotillion will be
President and Mrs. Ray Lyman Wil
bur, Dean and Mrs. George B. Culver,
Dean Mary Yost, Comptroller and Mrs.
A. E. Roth, Professor and Mrs. W. B.
Owens, and Professor and Mrs. E. M.
Hulme.
