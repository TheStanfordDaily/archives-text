# PROFESSORS VISIT DESERT LAKES TO STUDY PLANT LIFE
## 
### 
In order to study desert brines in
j comparison with marine brines, a trip
i was recently made to Searle Lake in
j the of San Berna
i dino county, by Professors E. G. Mar
! tin of the Physiology department, L. B.
: Beeking of the Biology department,
and G. M. Smith and G. J. Peirce of
the Botany department.
Searle Lake, which has been named
I for the father of a Stanford alumnus,
is 1600 feet above sea level. It for
| merly drained into Death Valley.
| There are square miles of salt to be
! found here reaching a thickness of
about seventy feet. Bacteria and algae
I were found growing but there was an
absence of animal life.
Salt consists of a considerable
1 amount of potash, and 85 per cent of
I the potash supply of the country is
1 produced here. This source makes the
United States independent of Ger
many, the former source of this na
1 tion's potash supply.
North of Searle Lake there is an
i other desert basin known as Owens
Lake. This basin is at the foot of Mt.
Whitney. The composition of this lake
1 is different from that of Searle Lake,
and consequently different forms of
bacteria and algae were found there.
| This lake is used as a source of soda.
