# CONFERENCE GIVES APPROVAL TO HEALTH COMMITTEE ACTION
## 
### 
Women's Conference endorsed the
recommendation of the newly appoint
ed Health Committee that all women I
keep training rules from now until 1
finals at their meeting last night.
An appeal will be sent to the women |
through the living group presidents
for them to apportion their work so
that too much of it will not be left
for final week. It is particularly urged j
that they get eight hours' sleep each j
night.
Freshmen and sophomores were
also recommended to take Dr. Mosher's
course in Hygiene next quarter, as a
helpful measure in understanding and
improving the health situation on the
campus. The health committee is con-1
sidering having a compulsory hygiene
course for freshman women, but in the â– 
meantime, Conference has recom
mended that the underclassmen take
the course now given.
Conference, representing the Univer
sity women, approved of the first ac
tions of the newly formed health com
mittee in its effort to safeguard the j
health of the women students, and to
interest them in good health.
