### Fred Hines 
A one-point margin spelled victory
for Husky Hunt's fast babe cagers
yesterday when they triumphed 16 to
15 over the sophomore quintet in the
second game of the interclass basket
ball series. Superior coaching and
greater reserve strength enabled the
1929 men to pile up a four-point lead
in the second half and to stem the
tide of the sophomore last-minute
comeback. Sherman Crary, shifty
babe forward, won scoring honors
with twelve points—five field goals
and two fouls.
The frosh showed some clever pass
ing, the McCandless to Crary play ac
counting for a good many tallies. Clif
Moore, 1928 forward, displayed a dead
eye for the basket, scoring seven
points. Biaggini, standing guard on
last year's freshman team, did varsity
work as sophomore guard. From the
wealth of material evident yesterday,
the 1929 men should form a powerful
squad this year. In a fast, ragged pre
liminary tilt, the frosh reserves
snowed the 192S second team under
by a 13 to 7 score. Twenty-nine men
were in the game for the freshmen.
Crary Begins Scoring
At the start Crary began the scor
j ing for the frosh when clever passing
gave him the ball under the basket.
Moore, 1928 forward, returned by
; sinking a fairly long shot, but was
followed by Crary, who again scored
! for the 1929 men. Field goals by Moore
and Dobson and a free throw by Dob
; son made the score 7 to 4 in favor
of the sophomores.
Then the frosh rallied. Crary
; dropped in a free throw, McCandless
i sank a long shot, and Crary scored
