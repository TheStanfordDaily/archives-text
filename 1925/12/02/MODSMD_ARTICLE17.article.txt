# FRESHMAN COURT FIVE TAKES CLOSE GAME FROM 1928
## FINAL SCORE IS 16 TO 15 Crary Scores Twelve Points For Babes; Moore High For Sophomores 
### Fred Hines 
A one-point margin spelled victory
for Husky Hunt's fast babe cagers
yesterday when they triumphed 16 to
15 over the sophomore quintet in the
second game of the interclass basket
ball series. Superior coaching and
greater reserve strength enabled the
1929 men to pile up a four-point lead
in the second half and to stem the
tide of the sophomore last-minute
comeback. Sherman Crary, shifty
babe forward, won scoring honors
with twelve points—five field goals
and two fouls.
The frosh showed some clever pass
ing, the McCandless to Crary play ac
counting for a good many tallies. Clif
Moore, 1928 forward, displayed a dead
eye for the basket, scoring seven
points. Biaggini, standing guard on
last year's freshman team, did varsity
work as sophomore guard. From the
wealth of material evident yesterday,
the 1929 men should form a powerful
squad this year. In a fast, ragged pre
liminary tilt, the frosh reserves
snowed the 192S second team under
by a 13 to 7 score. Twenty-nine men
were in the game for the freshmen.
Crary Begins Scoring
At the start Crary began the scor
j ing for the frosh when clever passing
gave him the ball under the basket.
Moore, 1928 forward, returned by
; sinking a fairly long shot, but was
followed by Crary, who again scored
! for the 1929 men. Field goals by Moore
and Dobson and a free throw by Dob
; son made the score 7 to 4 in favor
of the sophomores.
Then the frosh rallied. Crary
; dropped in a free throw, McCandless
i sank a long shot, and Crary scored
on another free throw. McCandless '
again showed an uncanny eye for the j
basket in sinking-a pretty shot from j
near center. Biaggini dropped a shot
through the hoop before the half |
ended, so that the score read fresh- j
men 10, sophomores 9.
Sophs Tie Count
In the second half the score was:
tied for a few moments when Dyer,
sank a free throw, but Crary followed j
with two baskets for the frosh. Dyer j
again scored for the 1928 team with
a basket, but Crary dropped in another j
shot, making the score 16 to 12 in the j
babes' favor. The sophomores made a 1
desperate attempt at a comeback
when Moore sank a free throw and a ;
neat shot from the corner. With the j
frosh leading 16 to 15 and but a minute j
to play, the 1928 men fought furi- j
ously, but were held until the final j
gun went off.
Today the sophomores play against :
the senior aggregation, which was j
beaten Monday by the juniors, 10 to 7. 1
While this is too early in the series |
to predict with any certainty, the
sophomore and freshman teams so!
far are showing up as the real con-'
tenders for the title. The sophomores I
will not meet the juniors until the last'
game of the series on December 9.

Today the sophomores play against :
the senior aggregation, which was j
beaten Monday by the juniors, 10 to 7. 1
While this is too early in the series |
to predict with any certainty, the
sophomore and freshman teams so!
far are showing up as the real con-'
tenders for the title. The sophomores I
will not meet the juniors until the last'
game of the series on December 9.
The line-ups were as follows:
Freshmen: Crary, rf (12); Sexson.
If; McCandless, c (4); Reeder, rg; j
Lewis, lg.
Sophomores: Moore, rf (7); Dobson,
If (3); Hosom, c; Biaggini, rg (2);!
Reynolds, lg. Substitutes: Dyer (3) for
Moore.
A one-point margin spelled victory
for Husky Hunt's fast babe cagers
yesterday when they triumphed 16 to
15 over the sophomore quintet in the
second game of the interclass basket
ball series. Superior coaching and
greater reserve strength enabled the
1929 men to pile up a four-point lead
in the second half and to stem the
tide of the sophomore last-minute
comeback. Sherman Crary, shifty
babe forward, won scoring honors
with twelve points—five field goals
and two fouls.
The frosh showed some clever pass
ing, the McCandless to Crary play ac
counting for a good many tallies. Clif
Moore, 1928 forward, displayed a dead
eye for the basket, scoring seven
points. Biaggini, standing guard on
last year's freshman team, did varsity
work as sophomore guard. From the
wealth of material evident yesterday,
the 1929 men should form a powerful
squad this year. In a fast, ragged pre
liminary tilt, the frosh reserves
snowed the 192S second team under
by a 13 to 7 score. Twenty-nine men
were in the game for the freshmen.
Crary Begins Scoring
At the start Crary began the scor
j ing for the frosh when clever passing
gave him the ball under the basket.
Moore, 1928 forward, returned by
; sinking a fairly long shot, but was
followed by Crary, who again scored
! for the 1929 men. Field goals by Moore
and Dobson and a free throw by Dob
; son made the score 7 to 4 in favor
of the sophomores.
Then the frosh rallied. Crary
; dropped in a free throw, McCandless
i sank a long shot, and Crary scored
on another free throw. McCandless '
again showed an uncanny eye for the j
basket in sinking-a pretty shot from j
near center. Biaggini dropped a shot
through the hoop before the half |
ended, so that the score read fresh- j
men 10, sophomores 9.
Sophs Tie Count
In the second half the score was:
tied for a few moments when Dyer,
sank a free throw, but Crary followed j
with two baskets for the frosh. Dyer j
again scored for the 1928 team with
a basket, but Crary dropped in another j
shot, making the score 16 to 12 in the j
babes' favor. The sophomores made a 1
desperate attempt at a comeback
when Moore sank a free throw and a ;
neat shot from the corner. With the j
frosh leading 16 to 15 and but a minute j
to play, the 1928 men fought furi- j
ously, but were held until the final j
gun went off.
