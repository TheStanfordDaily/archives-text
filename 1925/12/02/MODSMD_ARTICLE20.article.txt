# Will Freshmen Obey Rules?
## 
### 
A number of writers have suggested to the Daily Palo Alto during
tthe past weeks that a return to sophomore discipline of freshmen would do
much toward the proper enforcement of traditions, which would ulti
mately promote Stanford spirit by developing a greater interest in Uni
versity activities and interests among the underclassmen. Should sopho
more discipline be deemed advisable, there are many stumbling stones to
block its success which must be removed.
The Daily Palo Alto has evoked discussion upon the matter of the
decadence of spirit and tradition observance locally, and is attempting to
direct the discussion rather than to dominate it. Other universities are
also having their troubles, and from time to time the Daily will present
an account of their success in coping with the situation.
Recently at the University of Kansas rules were laid down to make
first year students obey to the letter an elaborate code for behavior which
was drawn up for the occasion.
In commenting upon the present situation there, the University Daily
Kansan speaks as follows in a communication to the Daily Palo Alto:
"You have asked what methods are used to make our rules regarding
freshmen a success. The answer is simple: they aren't. When the rules
were passed, the world nearly came to an end here. All the old fogies and
those with tender hearts could see dire results in the offing. We were de
generating into a school of brutes, and buckets of tears were shed over
glowing word-pictures of bruised and bleeding freshmen who had fallen
victims to a generation who cried for blood.
"Controversy raged as to the legality of paddling, since it was rumored
that in the Puritan days of old, a law had been passed by the student coun
cil against it. We published miles of student opinion pro and con, but it
seemed nothing could be done and nothing has been done.
"As a result, one can find freshmen even carrying canes, which are
the insignia of senior laws. Freshmen caps are as scarce as dodos and the
widely heralded system is about as successful as the Ten Commandments."
From which it can be seen that it is a hard thing to force freshmen to
do something they do not want to do. Stanford, however, can overcome
this difficulty by merely demanding observance of worthwhile traditions
and customs, and not asking freshmen to do things which should be classed
as "horse play."
In the opinion of the Daily Palo Alto the freshmen as a whole are
anxious to do the right thing. The sponsor system does not point out the
right thing and then back it up with means of making the wayward ones,
who are in the minority, obey. This is the reason sophomore discipline is
worthwhile. It will make the gilded, sophisticated, idling freshman who
doesn't care to do what the majority would do themselves if it wasn t for
his bad example.

"As a result, one can find freshmen even carrying canes, which are
the insignia of senior laws. Freshmen caps are as scarce as dodos and the
widely heralded system is about as successful as the Ten Commandments."
From which it can be seen that it is a hard thing to force freshmen to
do something they do not want to do. Stanford, however, can overcome
this difficulty by merely demanding observance of worthwhile traditions
and customs, and not asking freshmen to do things which should be classed
as "horse play."
In the opinion of the Daily Palo Alto the freshmen as a whole are
anxious to do the right thing. The sponsor system does not point out the
right thing and then back it up with means of making the wayward ones,
who are in the minority, obey. This is the reason sophomore discipline is
worthwhile. It will make the gilded, sophisticated, idling freshman who
doesn't care to do what the majority would do themselves if it wasn t for
his bad example.
A number of writers have suggested to the Daily Palo Alto during
tthe past weeks that a return to sophomore discipline of freshmen would do
much toward the proper enforcement of traditions, which would ulti
mately promote Stanford spirit by developing a greater interest in Uni
versity activities and interests among the underclassmen. Should sopho
more discipline be deemed advisable, there are many stumbling stones to
block its success which must be removed.
The Daily Palo Alto has evoked discussion upon the matter of the
decadence of spirit and tradition observance locally, and is attempting to
direct the discussion rather than to dominate it. Other universities are
also having their troubles, and from time to time the Daily will present
an account of their success in coping with the situation.
Recently at the University of Kansas rules were laid down to make
first year students obey to the letter an elaborate code for behavior which
was drawn up for the occasion.
In commenting upon the present situation there, the University Daily
Kansan speaks as follows in a communication to the Daily Palo Alto:
"You have asked what methods are used to make our rules regarding
freshmen a success. The answer is simple: they aren't. When the rules
were passed, the world nearly came to an end here. All the old fogies and
those with tender hearts could see dire results in the offing. We were de
generating into a school of brutes, and buckets of tears were shed over
glowing word-pictures of bruised and bleeding freshmen who had fallen
victims to a generation who cried for blood.
"Controversy raged as to the legality of paddling, since it was rumored
that in the Puritan days of old, a law had been passed by the student coun
cil against it. We published miles of student opinion pro and con, but it
seemed nothing could be done and nothing has been done.
