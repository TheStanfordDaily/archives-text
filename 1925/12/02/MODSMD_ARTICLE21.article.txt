That something was wrong somewhere in the plans for the Sophomore
Yachting party is patently evident from the cancellation of all arrange
ments for the affair by the 1928 class president. According to the busi
ness manager of the class approximately twenty-five tickets had been sold.
To make matters worse for the class ugly rumors have been current as to
the financial success of the Cotillion. The possibility of a greatly increased
sale of tickets during the remaining days before the dance lessens the
danger of the class sustaining much of a loss.
Originally designed to take the place of the tea dance the Yachting
party was lauded as a great idea. Various causes for the failure have been
suggested such as insufficient advertising, a poorly conducted sale of
tickets, and the fact that a good deal more than the price of a Yacht party
ticket would have been paid out by each individual before the trip was over.
Train tickets and lunches would have made the cost run up rapidly. Still
another cause to which the failure has been attributed is that too many
regulations and restrictions on parties going to the affair have been laid
down.
Whatever wiseacres deside the reason to be. the fact nevertheless re
mains that the sophomores will have to work all the harder on the Cotillion
in order to scrub out this black mark.
