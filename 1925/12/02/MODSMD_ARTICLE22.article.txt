The performance of "Uncle Tom's
Cabin" at Mullens Hall in Palo Alto
last night was the scene of a fight
between two hundred students and six
members of tho Palo Alto police force.
The trouble was started by the josh
ing of th« actors by tho students, and
was brought to a head by one of the
deputies who struck a student on the
head with a club. Tho assault was en
tirely unprovoked as the man who
was attacked had been merely an on

looker during the previous disturb
ance. This hasty action angered the
students and resulted in a free-for-all
fight in which the representatives of
the law were roughly handled and de
prived of their clubs.

Dan Murphy, the famous oarsman
and coach, has written a letter to the
Stanford Boat Club applying for the
position of coach of the Cardinal
crews. Murphy has had a very success
ful career as a coach and the t.erm«
on which he would come here are very
reasonable.
