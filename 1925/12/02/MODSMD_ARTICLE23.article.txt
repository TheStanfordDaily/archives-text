# CAMPUS OPINION
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
I fail to grasp the reasoning of your
argument against professional football
in your editorial of Monday night en
titled "An Increasing Evil." Your only
objection to permitting college stars
to be enticed awtiy from their college
careers seems to be that college foot
ball is thereby likely to suffer. 1 should
like to ask by what right colleges lay
claim to a monopoly of stars, public
interest, and gate receipts in this
sport. Suppose the colleges do train
the stars, as you say. Are they train
ing them as a part of their program
of athletic development of all students,
or in order that the college will reap
golden profits from their playing? The
latter conclusion may well be drawn,
from the present commercialized con
dition of the sport.
Professional football would never
have been heard of had not the col
leges developed the public demand for
tickets at any price. I am not at pres
ent criticizing the colleges for cashing
in,, but I say if their interest in the
sport is a commercial one, they should
be willing to accept competition as it
comes. If their interest is not com
mercial. why worry themselves over
the small number of men that are
leaving college to become profession
al? How many men leave college every
year to make money in other ways?
And yet I have never heard Big Busi
ness reproached for enticing away col
lege stars in economics and calculus.
Anyhow, with the reported salaries
that the professional stars make, they
should be able to finish their educa
tion in luxury during the nine months
of each year that football is out of sea
son.
If colleges object to professional
football because it endangers their
profits from the game, they are taking
an extremely poor stand. If they ob
ject because their stars lose a couple
of years of college education, they
are worrying a great deal about a few
men. Why be afraid of college foot
ball taking second place to the pro
fessional sport? Does college exist for
football.
If you want to demolish professional
football, you had better attack profes
sional athletics as a whole. Then you
can find some possible basis for logic.
Respectfully yours,
P. S. U.

The Editor, Sir:
I understand that it is a tradition
here at Stanford that the varsity yell
follow the singing: of the hymn at
rallies and games. I do not know how
others may feel about it, but to me,
the yell, following our beautiful, sol
emn hymn, seems totally out of place.
Up to the singing of the hymn, we
have been enthusiastic rooters giving
all of our hearts and voices to cheer
for the team. The hymn comes at the
osychological moment when we are a
little snent, happy if we have won.
but quite ready to leave the field of
combat. The hymn is not of the team,
not of the students, not of the crowd
assembled; it is of the Alma Mater.
It tends to lift us out of ourselves, out
of the moment for which we are there
gathered, and to merge us into some
thing greater. I'm quite sure that most
of us feel this when we sing the hymn.
Then down from the heights we come,
and in the quiet of the assemblage
rings another yell. Every time I have
heard the yell after the hymn I have
felt dissatisfied —a false note had been
struck.
If I am alone in this feeling, no harm
has been done in publishing this view
point, but if I am not, I hope that its
being a tradition will not save it for
future maledictions.
Yours very truly,
S. M., '27.

others may feel about it, but to me,
the yell, following our beautiful, sol
emn hymn, seems totally out of place.
Up to the singing of the hymn, we
have been enthusiastic rooters giving
all of our hearts and voices to cheer
for the team. The hymn comes at the
osychological moment when we are a
little snent, happy if we have won.
but quite ready to leave the field of
combat. The hymn is not of the team,
not of the students, not of the crowd
assembled; it is of the Alma Mater.
It tends to lift us out of ourselves, out
of the moment for which we are there
gathered, and to merge us into some
thing greater. I'm quite sure that most
of us feel this when we sing the hymn.
Then down from the heights we come,
and in the quiet of the assemblage
rings another yell. Every time I have
heard the yell after the hymn I have
felt dissatisfied —a false note had been
struck.
If I am alone in this feeling, no harm
has been done in publishing this view
point, but if I am not, I hope that its
being a tradition will not save it for
future maledictions.

The Editor, Sir:
I fail to grasp the reasoning of your
argument against professional football
in your editorial of Monday night en
titled "An Increasing Evil." Your only
objection to permitting college stars
to be enticed awtiy from their college
careers seems to be that college foot
ball is thereby likely to suffer. 1 should
like to ask by what right colleges lay
claim to a monopoly of stars, public
interest, and gate receipts in this
sport. Suppose the colleges do train
the stars, as you say. Are they train
ing them as a part of their program
of athletic development of all students,
or in order that the college will reap
golden profits from their playing? The
latter conclusion may well be drawn,
from the present commercialized con
dition of the sport.
Professional football would never
have been heard of had not the col
leges developed the public demand for
tickets at any price. I am not at pres
ent criticizing the colleges for cashing
in,, but I say if their interest in the
sport is a commercial one, they should
be willing to accept competition as it
comes. If their interest is not com
mercial. why worry themselves over
the small number of men that are
leaving college to become profession
al? How many men leave college every
year to make money in other ways?
And yet I have never heard Big Busi
ness reproached for enticing away col
lege stars in economics and calculus.
Anyhow, with the reported salaries
that the professional stars make, they
should be able to finish their educa
tion in luxury during the nine months
of each year that football is out of sea
son.
If colleges object to professional
football because it endangers their
profits from the game, they are taking
an extremely poor stand. If they ob
ject because their stars lose a couple
of years of college education, they
are worrying a great deal about a few
men. Why be afraid of college foot
ball taking second place to the pro
fessional sport? Does college exist for
football.
If you want to demolish professional
football, you had better attack profes
sional athletics as a whole. Then you
can find some possible basis for logic.
Respectfully yours,
