Now that the fresnmen Have become
; the sole authorities on traditions, why
not appoint a freshman committee of
I sponsors, or even a freshman board of
| trustees?

We think that it should be decided
by a vote of the freshman class wheth
er or not the seniors should be al-
J lowed to wear their sombreros.

If we must have traditions, why not
I have something original? How about
freshman discipline for sophomores?

Now that finals are approaching, the
'dinks that have been used so far this
year to shine shoes will probably be
