### Ted Elias, Jr 
Ex Committee holds a meeting.
Talking over weighty questions;
It's a shame we could not be there,
Offering our bright (?) suggestions.
Mildred Worswick, women's prexy,
And our student body chief,
Take a trip to dear old Princeton
For the naughty world's relief.
Thursday we will hold assembly,
Over deep considerations;
First, a world judiciary, and,
Secondly, the League of Nations.
Though the College of Pacific
Was unable to debate,
Mills will meet Euphronia, and
Wednesday night will be the date.
Freshmen beat their older brothers
In an intramural battle,
Thereby bringing up the question,
"Who shall get the baby rattle?"
