# COLGATE REFUSES EAST-WEST GAME WITH WASHINGTON
## 
### 
With Colgate's definite refusal to
participate in the annual East-West
football game to be played at the
Pasadena Rose Bowl January 1, choice
for the Eastern entry seems to be
limited to Alabama or to an eleven
which has not completed an undefeated
season.
Information received by Jack Bone
fiel, official representative of the Pa
cific Coast conference who was re
cently sent East to select the eastern
opponent, indicated that the Colgate
team was in favor of the trip and post
season game, but faculty permission
was definitely refused.
Washington, as undisputed champion
of the Pacific Coast, will probably
represent the West in the annual en
counter. The Huskies are undefeated,
although a tie game with Nebraska
early in the season somewhat mars
their record. Decision of whether the
Washington eleven will play awaits the
acceptance of an invitation by a repre
sentative eastern team.
Dartmouth, Tulane, and Alabama
are the only undefeated teams of the
East and Middlewest. Alabama has
been neither defeated nor tied, and
has run up 277 points in nine games.
Nebraska, led by Captain Ed Weir,
the one oustanding tackle of the coun
try for the last two years, is willing
to play New Years Day and settle the
6-6 tie with Washington in their fÂ£mie
early in the season. Nebraska, how
ever, has been defeated and so is not
considered a likely choice for the east
ern entry.
