"CLASSIFIED"
Loew's Warfield, San Francisco
Throwing the spotlight upon the
activities of a successful gold digger,
"Classified" is surprisingly illuminat
ing. Corinne Griffith appears as a
comedienne instead of in her usual
heart-throbbing role. She takes the
part of a girl in one of the classified
ad booths of a metropolitan news
paper.
Being a young lady with social am
bitions, Babs attempts to secure a
place in the exclusive circles of New
York by marrying a millionaire. Dates
made over her telephone from the of
fice take her into Fifth Avenue's night
clubs, where she nearly accepts Spen
cer Clarke's proposal, but decides to
marry a drug store cowboy instead.
A burlesque of the old-style melo
drama gives the audience a big laugh
and the return of Babs to the city in
a milk-wagon after leaving her mil
lionaire with his Rolls-Royce is one
of the brightest parts of the story.
Charlie Murray as Pa Comet acts like
the usual energetic head of the family
and has quite a time with his collar.
After seeing "Classified" the stage
attractions suffer by comparison, al
though Ray Scott certainly can
Charleston and hit the floor with a
wallop. If we had to classify "Classi
fied" we would put it in the educa
tional columns. —F. W. M.
