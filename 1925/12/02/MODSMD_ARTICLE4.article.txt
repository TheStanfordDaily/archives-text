# WEIGHT BASKETBALL MEN BEGIN REGULAR WORKOUTS TONIGHT
## 
### 
Weight basketball will get under
way at 8:30 o'clock tonight when can
didates for the 130-pound team report
to Coach Hal Davis at the basketball
pavilion. Members of the 145-pound
team have been working out unoffi
cially for several days, and they will
begin regular work tonight at 7
o'clock.
Practices are being started earlier
than is customary this year because
the date of the California series will
probably be set two or three weeks
ahead of the usual date. Attempts are
being made to schedule the first prac
tice game for December 12.
Plans for taking the 145-pound ,team
on a trip to Southern California dur
ing Christmas vacation have fallen
through because it was impossible to
secure enough games with high schools
and colleges to insure the success of
the trip.
Both weight teams should be
stronger this year than last season, as
a good supply of veteran material is
on hand. Coach Davis hopes to re
venge himself upon California for the
double defeat handed the Card weight
teams last season.
