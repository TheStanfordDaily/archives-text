# SOME FAMOUS RUNS
## 
### BY FEG MURRAY 
There are famous runs and infamous
runs. There is the run of "Abie's Irish
Rose," for instance, the longest in
theatrical history. Then there is the
run of "Red" Grange of Illinois, who
last year grabbed the opening kick-off
and ran through the entire Michigan
team to a touchdown. Bill Bachrach,
the famous and portly swimming coach
of the Illinois Athletic Club, was sit
ting in the Urbana Stadium during
that game directly behind the band,

which began to play furiously when
"Red" crossed the final chalk line after
his gallop of 90 yards, yet the noise
made by the howling, frantic spectators
was so loud that he couldn't hear a
note of music!
Incidentally, this scoring a touch
down after grabbing the opening kick
off is no new stunt for "Red." He used
to do it often at Wheaton High School,
and he did it against lowa this year.
Eddie Tryon of Colgate has pulled that
;same trick on more than one occasion

The longest football runs on record
are two of 110 yardsâ€”made by McCaa
of Lafayette against Swarthmore from
scrimmage in 1909, and by Ben
Boynton of Williams, who ran back a
punt against Hamilton in 1920'.
Sara White of Princeton jumped into
everlasting fame by winning the Yale
and Harvard games single-handed in
one season. Sam had practiced dili
gently all fall at scooping up a bound
ing football, and, strangely enough, his
chance came against both of Prince

ton's biggest rivals, and runs of 85 and
80 yards to winning touchdowns re
sulted.
Indian Dillon's run against Harvard
made football history in 1903. "Pop"
Warner, then coach of the Carlisle
team, had planned a good one and it
worked to perfection. As the nusky
Indian guard neared the goal line with
the ball stuck up inside the back of
his sweater, Marshall, the Harvard
captain, stepped to one side to let him
pass, thinking that he was merely
trying to put him out of the play.
Coach Stagg made his run around a
mounted policeman, who was out on
the field trying to keep the crowd back,
in 1893. The game was between Chi
cago University and Englewood High
School, and Stagg, already a Yale
graduate, played on as well as coached
the Chicago team!
