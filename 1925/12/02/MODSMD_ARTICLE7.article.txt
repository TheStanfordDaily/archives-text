## 
### 
Breakage costs in Encina Commons
for the last two years were $8,184,'
according to figures submitted by
Miss Etta H. Handy at a meeting of;
the Board of Control last night. While i
some of this breakage occurred in the!
dining-halls, more than half of the!
losses were caused by students' re- j
moving silver and glassware to their j
rooms.
New chinaware cpst the halls $5,240',
silverware, $1,291, table linen, $698.
and glass, $773. The Board of Control
is launching a no-breakage campaign
so that more money may be spent on
food rather than on tableware.
A new constitution, drawn up by
Donald G. Adams, president of the
board, was approved by the board and
by Comptroller Roth. This constitu
tion gives more definite powers to
the board, and also creates a disci
plinary committee consisting of four
sponsors chosen by the dean of men,
and of the four head-waiters.
Luncheon on Friday, December 18,
will be the last meal served in the
dining halls this quarter.
