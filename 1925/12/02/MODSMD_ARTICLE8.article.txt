# Kipling Writes of Virile Life States Professor Bassett
## Lecturer Concludes With Recitation of Poet's Compositions 
### 
"Kipling," said Dr. Lee Emerson
Bassett, at the Tuesday evening lec
:ture last night, "is the poet of the
i young, the active, and the virile who
delight in doing things and are yet:
j young enough to accomplish them."
Kipling is primarily a man who does i
; things, according to Bassett. His j
i thoughts are only subsidiary to his ■
1 actions. His poetry is in admiration 1
of that type—the explorer, the negro I
; water-carrier, and the British Tommy.'
I "His choice of words is always |
i striking, again essentially virile —|
brusque, but always to the point. Kip- i
ling's indomitable will, his nerve, the
i love of British Empire and what it j
i stands for, are preelominant in his
j poems. He likes action and his expres
! sion of it is grim and merciless. He
: delights in physical achievements; his
hero is usually one of physical prow
i ess or bravery."
The latter part of the lecture was a
i recitation of Kipling's recognition of
j the soldiers whom all England dis
dained a short time before the war,
; "The Explorer," "Christmas in India,''
"Boots," and his famous L'Envoi,
! "When Earth's Last Picture Is Paint
ed," were the other poems recited.
