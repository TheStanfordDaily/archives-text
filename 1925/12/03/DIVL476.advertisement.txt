Make your razor
blades last longer
WILLIAMS SHAVING CREAM does a real
job of beard-softening. It stays wet and
bulky and softens all of every hair so that
blades keep their edge longer. And Williams
is the most soothing lather known for sensitive
skins. Try a tube! Large-size 35c; double'size
50c, containing twice as much. At all dealers!
ALWAYS INSIST ON WILLIAMS
