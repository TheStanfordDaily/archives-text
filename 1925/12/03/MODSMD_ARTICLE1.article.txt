# SENIORS VANQUISH FAST SOPHOMORE INTERCLASS SQUAD
## SCORE READS 12 TO 4 1928 Quintet Fails to Score On Many Tries at Hoop; Seniors Get Range 
### Fred Hines 
The senior basketball quintet upset
the dope yesterday when it humbled
the sophomore cagers 12 to 4 in a
rough battle. The 1928 forwards had
plenty of tries at the basket, but suc

the game.
The sophomore five played a much

made the last score for the 1928 men
when his long shot bounced on the

Morrison Scores
Tom Alexander and Tex Middleton
scored baskets for the seniors after
long struggles in which the ball was
on the floor most of the time. With
two minutes to play, Morrison, senior
guard, dropped a shot through the
