# SENIORS VANQUISH FAST SOPHOMORE INTERCLASS SQUAD
## SCORE READS 12 TO 4 1928 Quintet Fails to Score On Many Tries at Hoop; Seniors Get Range 
### Fred Hines 
The senior basketball quintet upset
the dope yesterday when it humbled
the sophomore cagers 12 to 4 in a
rough battle. The 1928 forwards had
plenty of tries at the basket, but suc
ceeded in finding it only twice during
the game.
The sophomore five played a much
tighter game Tuesday when they held
the fast freshman team to a 16 to 15
score. The seniors were beaten in the
first game of the series by the juniors,
10 to 7. While these comparative
scores would place the juniors at the
top of the list, the 1929 men have
shown the best brand of basketball
and have in addition greater reserves
to draw from. The freshmen, too, are
capable of better basketball than the
juniors have yet displayed.
King Starts Soph Scoring
In the first half Bob King, star 1928
high-jumper, began the tallying for the
sophomores when he hooped a pretty
shot from the foul line after Gibbons
of the seniors had missed two free
throws. Copeland evened the score by
sinking a swift one for the seniors.
Then Charles Harlow went in for Mid
dleton, and shot two pretty baskets in
quick succession. In spite of innumer
able tries on both sides, no further
scoring was done in the half.
The second half started with the
same football tactics, each team fight
ing for possession of the ball, which
did not stay long in anyone's hands.
Mike Reynolds, sophomore guard,
made the last score for the 1928 men
when his long shot bounced on the
edge of the basket and finally dropped
in. Red Moore, fast 1928 forward,
could not find the basket, and failed
to score on numerous tries. N
Morrison Scores
Tom Alexander and Tex Middleton
scored baskets for the seniors after
long struggles in which the ball was
on the floor most of the time. With
two minutes to play, Morrison, senior
guard, dropped a shot through the
hoop, making the score 12 to 4. The
final gun was shot with the sopho
; mores still making unsuccessful at
| tempts to locate the hoop, and the
! seniors were the victors.
| Charles Harlow of the 1926 team
was the only man to score more than
two points, his two baskets making
him high-point man. The seniors had
no individual stars, but two good
i quintets. The sophomores, on the
jother hand, had Biaggini at standing
j guard, the position he played on the
j 1928 squad last year, while King of
last year's squad and Hosom did cred
itable work. The absence of Clif Moore,
who tallied seven points against the
frosh, weakened the 1928 team's bas
ket-shooting ability greatly.
Soph Goofs Win
The scores were reversed when the
sophomore second team vanquished
the senior goofs 13 to 9 in a prelimi
nary game. The 192S second five
showed up better than the first string,
both in passing and in basket-shoot
ing. The score stood 5 to 3 in favor
of the seniors at half' time, but Don
Hill was put in for the second half,
strengthening the defense, and Moore
and Carlsmith accounted for most of
the ten points made during the half
by the sophomores.
The line-ups for the first team game
were as follows:
Seniors: Alexander, rf (2); Morri
son, If (2); Gibbons, c; Wisely, rg;
Copeland, lg (2). Substitutes: Hobro j
for Alexander; Charles Harlow (4) for
Morrison; Myer for Harlow; Middle
