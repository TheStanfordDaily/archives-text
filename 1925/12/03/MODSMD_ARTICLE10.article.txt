# COACH KERR TRIES NEW COMBINATIONS FOR VARSITY FIVE
## Basketball Squad Practices For Opening Game of Season 
### 
The varsity basketball squad settled ;
down to hard work at practice last j
night in the pavilion, with Coach Andy ;
Kerr trying out several different com
binations which appear to be about
equally good. On account of the cotil- !
lion decorations varsity practice will j
be Encina gymnasium tonight i
and tomorrow night.
The men used in the first five last j
night were Jayred at center, Clark j
and David at the forward positions, [
with Trice and Harris at guard. Kerr is '
still undecided on a definite line-up;
and will make changes until the best-1
working combination is found. Christ'
and Vincehti from last year's fresh
man team worked well together in the
forward berths. Anderson and Jayred j
are pretty closely matched for the j
center position, while Young and
Harris are fighting it for standing |
guard.
The first game was scheduled for!
December 12 against the San Jose |
State Teachers College, but it is pos-1
sible that this will be postponed until i
December 19. Ernie Nevers has taken ;
out leave until next quarter, and will |
not return to practice until then.
