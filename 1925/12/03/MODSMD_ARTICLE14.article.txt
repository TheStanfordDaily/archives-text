rules next week and during final week,;
it was decided at a W. A. A. board j
meeting last night. The lighter train- j
ing rules will be used by those who
observe the "Health Week," and the!
women will be asked to sign training
slips.
Frances Gooden, Barbara Lee, and |
Barbara Frick were appointed to in
vestigate the possibility of having golf

Education department.
Eleven manuscripts for the Fiesta
have been turned in, it was announced.
W. A. A. recommended that it be
given in the evening, subject to the
approval of the executive committee J
of the Fiesta as to expenditures for j
lighting.
Training slips will not be used in ;
women's sports in the future, it was

will take a roll-call of players once a '
week, in which each woman will be j
required to answer whether she has
broken training or not, and what cuts
she has taken.
