# AWARDS COMMITTEE TO CLASSIFY SPORTS IN THREE DIVISIONS
## Plan to Be Presented for Students' Consideration In February 
### 
Decision to classify sports in three
divisions, as in the present system,
was made last night by the Awards
Committee which is drawing up a new
plan to be presented to the Student
Body at the February elections. The
three classes of sports will be major,
first-class minor, and second-class
minor or auxiliary.
There was considerable dissension
in the committee as to classification
of the minor sports in the first or
second classes, but no decision was
reached as to which sports would be
placed in these groups. The committee
was favorable, however, to leaving the
major group as at present, with foot
ball, basketball, track, baseball, and
tennis making up the list.
Two other plans were discussed by
the committee. One of these was that
there should be four sports classes,
and the other provided for but two
classes. Both these proposals were
voted down.
The matter of an award for the third
class of sports was given considerable
attention, but 110 decision was reached.
There was opposition to the present
"circle snake S" which is given as a
second-class minor sports letter.
The next meeting of the committee
will be held soon after the opening of
the winter quarter.
