# NATIONS ARE TIRING OF WAR, DR. JORDAN SAYS IN LECTURE
## 
### 
"The Handwriting on the Wall" was
the subject of Dr. Jordan's evening
conference last night, in which he
showed that the "Handwriting" point
ed to the fact that war among the
nations is doomed.
"Nations are beginning to realize,"
lie said, "the great loss of prestige
they suffer every time they indulge in
a war. They are also beginning to
realize to just how great an extent
war drains their financial resources.
The impoverished French will not
long be able to carry on the exhaustive
wars with the Riffs and the Syrians.
"Nearly all the colonizing country
of the world is taken up," Dr. Jordan
continued, "and this points the way to
â– an end of imperialism, one of the chief
causes of war. The people themselves
are all tired of war. This is one of
the most important things brought out
at the meeting at Locarno, and for
that reason makes this meeting one
of the most hopeful of its kind yet
held."
He also pointed out the fact that
all war profiteers made their money
out of their own state or country, and
not from foreign sources, and told of
how Wall Street magnates and made
money on Liberty Honds.
Dr. Jordan will give his next evening
conference talk on Wednesday, De
cember 9, at 7:30 o'clock, instead of
Thursday, as he is leaving for the
South to take part in dedication cere
monies of the Peace Memorial at Mt..
Rubicund. The topic will be "The
Lunatic Fringe."
