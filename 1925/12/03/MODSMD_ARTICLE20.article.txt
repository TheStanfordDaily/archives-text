# Davis Mails Intramural Basketball Entry Blanks
## 
### 
Entry blanks for the intramural basket
ball series have been mailed to the various
campus living groups by Charles W.
Davis, director of intramural activities.
These blanks should be returned as quickly
as possible in order to give Davis an op
portunity to start work on the schedule.
A meeting of the intramural athletic
committee will be held on December 10 to
discuss the organization of the basketball
league. Every living group is expected
to enter a team in the competition, and the
participation this year is counted on to
surpass any in previous seasons.
Each team entering the play will receive
ten points. This counts toward the total
intramural .standing, so any group wishing
to keep in the running for the champion
ship must necessarily enter a team.
