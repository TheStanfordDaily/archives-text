# FALLING MASONRY SAID TO ENDANGER M. P.'S OF BRITAIN
## 
### 
Towers, cupolas, and gargoyles
which adorn the House of Parliament
in London have degenerated into al
most shapeless pieces of masonry. But
a more serious aspect of the situation
is the reported disintegration of the
building itself.
Sir Frank Baines, a noted architect
in charge of public building, has in
formed a committee of the House of
Commons that members of Parliament
are in danger of being struck by fall
ing stones as they walk on the ter
races. There is no fear of the building
collapsing, however.
Owing to London's smoky atmos
phere and the crystallization of the
stonework, the building is in a bad
state. Hundreds of tons of loose ma
terial have been removed and there
are still innumerable masses at great
heights which could easily be removed
by hand. Sir Frank Baines estimated
that it would cost 12,000,000 pounds
to erect the building at the present
day. He said that repairs would cost
about 1,000,000 pounds.
