# Yale's Fight for Freedom
## 
### 
The nationwide agitation against compulsory chapel has reached a
climax at Yale where the undergraduate body has voted overwhelmingly
to abolish this time-worn and unnecessary feature of college life. As a
result of the vote conducted by the Yale Nczos the following petition is
l>eing circulated among the students, for subsequent presentation to the
faculty:
"We, the undersigned undergraduates of Yale College and the Com
mon freshman year, do hereby petition the faculty of Yale College that
the element of compulsory attendance be removed from Yale's religions
services. We have reached this decision after a week devoted to open dis
cussion and a two-day referendum which gave evidence that the under
graduates are of the opinion to the extent of 1681 for and 241 against.
It is our earnest wish that the faculty pursue the policy for which a desire
is herein so clearly expressed."
That nothing can be gained by forcing religion upon the student group
as a whole has long been-realized at Stanford. The Cardinal motto "Die
luft die freiheit veht" allows for no such dogmatism. Where the winds of
freedom blow, one must be allowed to feel and to think as bis own indi
vidual tastes dictate. Religion cannot be forced upon undergraduates like
a dose of medicine. If it is, it will ultimately cause a complete revolt
against it.
The fact that Yale students are taking active interest in forcing a
change in religious services is an extremely healthy sign. Ihe students
realize that compulsion will take away the sacredness of the services.
Many perhaps see in such an action a lessening of the bond of religion on
the part of the younger generation, but to use it shows the growth of a sane
attitude toward religion by the University students themselves.
