## 
### 
Robert E. Lewis, president of the Associated Students, and Mildred
Worswick, president of the Associated Women Students, will leave Sat
urday to represent Stanford at the National Collegiate World Court Con
ference to l>e held at Princeton University, December 11 and 12.
The purpose of the conference is to crystalize student opinion on the
World Court. The convention is not one where small bits of information
will be scattered among the tea cups, instead many nationally known men
will present their views. John W. Davis will speak on the World Court
at the opening session Friday night; Dr. George E. Vincent of the Rocke
feller Foundation, and Raymond Fosdick, former under-secretary of the
League of Nations, will address the conference Saturday night on perma
nent organization of students for world peace, and the discussion groups
Saturday morning will be led by such men as Henry van Dyke. President
Garfield of Williams. Roland G. Morris, former ambassador to Japan, and
Norman Thotnan, director of the League for Industrial Democracy.
It is no more than right that college men and women should be ex
pected to present their opinions on world problems—they will be the
natural leaders of the nation in a very few years. The Stanford delegates
will be guided by the opinion of the University as expressed by the stu
dents in the discussion to be held tonight in the Assembly Hall. Jt is to
be hoped that a large serious minded group will present its views at this
assembly so that the Stanford delegates will know that they have the views
of the majority of the Stanford students before leaving for the conference.
