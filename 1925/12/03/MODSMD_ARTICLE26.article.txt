# Dr. William L. Bryan

I)r. William L. Bryan, president of the University of Indiana, will
speak to the Stanford student body tomorrow on "Life at Three Dis-|
tances." Bryan was a student at Indiana when Dr. Jordan was president j
of that institution. The two were closely associated at that time in scien- !
tifie work. Dr. Jordan has done him the honor of calling him "the best ;
student of psychology he ever know," a capable scholar in many fields, and
a very successful executive.
It is seldom that Stanford students are given such an opportunity to j
hear a man of this calibre, who is both a student of psychology and a fore
most mid-west educator. The assembly will be well worth attending.
