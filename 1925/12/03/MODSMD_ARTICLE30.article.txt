# CAMPUS OPINION
## 
### 
The Editor,
Sir: For the present quarter a group of
men who eat at Encina Commons have
formed an observation committee 011 con
ditions existing there. They have decided
to submit for the consideration of the
campus several suggestions which they be
lieve would be of service in bettering these
conditions. We wish to stress the fact
that we are not trying to criticise for the
sake of criticism, but because the observa
tions which we have made are unanimous
and we feel that there is room for im
provement. On this account we submit
the following:
1. The Board of Control of Encina
Commons is inadequate and cannot man
age the commons, for the following rea
sons : 1. The student members as a rule
know nothing about restaurant or com
mons managing. 2. The system of rep
resentation means nothing because should
there be complaints the representative
hesitates to turn them in to the commons.
This is because (a) it is a criticism of the
management of which he is part; (b) the
criticism reflects on him and creates feel
ing in meetings; (c) he disregards the
complaints because he thinks they are
either too trivial or not sp. 3. The Uni
versity management completely dominates
the situation, rendering student participa
tion in name only and consequently value
less.
2. We understand that the breakage is
taken out of the regular fees for meals.
We submit, with tl]e authority of a man
who has had some experience in handling
this angle : 1. The evidence that breakage
cannot be restrained is evident of loose
management, because (a) the Board of
Control does not restrain it, which it can
do; (b) there are 110 active attempts to
bring before the students the necessity of
being careful. 2. That breakage, even if
it does exist, should not be paid out of
those fees; since breakage does exist, the
students should pav for it as an extra fee.
Such an action would stop much of the
breakage.
3. We understand that the commons is
a separate organization and pays 10 per
cent rent to the University for the use of
the building. We are of the opinion that
this is a clumsy way of doing things, and
costs more to the student. We understand
that the University policy is to give the
students the most for the money but when
tlys rental must be met it defeats this
purpose.
4. Relative to the costs we submit some
figures. On the authority of the men in
charge we place 550 as a conservative es
timate of the number of men eating there.
At an individual charge of $80 a quarter
this brings an income of $132,000 a school
year. Out of this $13,200 goes to the
University for rent. In a report which
came out recently which was given as ap
proximate, the costs of meals for the
month of October were $0,764.64, which
if continued throughout the school year
would be equivalent to $87,881.76. Of
the other expenses which we can detail,
including manager, personnel, mainte
nance, waiters, etc., we offer $20,000 as a
close value. The total is $121,081.76,
leaving a balance to go to the sinking
fund of between $11,000 and $12,000 —a
large amount.
5. The general dissatisfaction with the
food in the Commons has become a very
real factor, and we know that quite a good
many men who formerly ate there by
choice have left. To cite all the particular
complaints which we have received would
take considerable space but we cannot re
frain quoting several of the most fre
quent: 1. Predominance of beef, in all
forms, iti menu. 2. Canned vegetables,
rather tasteless. 3. Unsatisfactory pre
paration, using left-overs in all sorts of
makeshift dishes. 4. Monotony and actual
lack of enough to go around.
In view the these statements, we offer
the following:
1. Abolition of the board of control as
it exists at present, having direct student
management, which we can demonstrate
has proved to be a on the campus
where tried.
2. Direct University supervision with
out an organization go-between, consisting
of three members, one appointed by the
University, one elected by all the students
at large in a general election, and one ap
pointed by some method which can be sug
gested.
3. Choice of menu between two or more
things, and higher quality of food and
better preparation by a steward whose
business shall be that and nothing else,
and who shall be appointed subject to re
call.
4. The enlargement of the present gen
eral managership and of the Director of
the Eating Halls on the University, for it
seems to be too big a job to he adequately
handled by the present personnel.
We wish, in conclusion, to call it to the
attention of the reader that it is poor con
ditions which actually exist which has
compelled our attention to the subject, and
we repeat that we have been actuated by
a desire to help make the said Commons a
better, more efficient, and more pleasant
place to eat in.
Very sincerely yours,
Box 1667, Campus.

lieve would be of service in bettering these
conditions. We wish to stress the fact
that we are not trying to criticise for the
sake of criticism, but because the observa
tions which we have made are unanimous
and we feel that there is room for im
provement. On this account we submit
the following:
1. The Board of Control of Encina
Commons is inadequate and cannot man
age the commons, for the following rea
sons : 1. The student members as a rule
know nothing about restaurant or com
mons managing. 2. The system of rep
resentation means nothing because should
there be complaints the representative
hesitates to turn them in to the commons.
This is because (a) it is a criticism of the
management of which he is part; (b) the
criticism reflects on him and creates feel
ing in meetings; (c) he disregards the
complaints because he thinks they are
either too trivial or not sp. 3. The Uni
versity management completely dominates
the situation, rendering student participa
tion in name only and consequently value
less.
2. We understand that the breakage is
taken out of the regular fees for meals.
We submit, with tl]e authority of a man
who has had some experience in handling
this angle : 1. The evidence that breakage
cannot be restrained is evident of loose
management, because (a) the Board of
Control does not restrain it, which it can
do; (b) there are 110 active attempts to
bring before the students the necessity of
being careful. 2. That breakage, even if
it does exist, should not be paid out of
those fees; since breakage does exist, the
students should pav for it as an extra fee.
Such an action would stop much of the
breakage.
3. We understand that the commons is
a separate organization and pays 10 per
cent rent to the University for the use of
the building. We are of the opinion that
this is a clumsy way of doing things, and
costs more to the student. We understand
that the University policy is to give the
students the most for the money but when
tlys rental must be met it defeats this
purpose.
4. Relative to the costs we submit some
figures. On the authority of the men in
charge we place 550 as a conservative es
timate of the number of men eating there.
At an individual charge of $80 a quarter
this brings an income of $132,000 a school
year. Out of this $13,200 goes to the
University for rent. In a report which
came out recently which was given as ap
proximate, the costs of meals for the
month of October were $0,764.64, which
if continued throughout the school year
would be equivalent to $87,881.76. Of
the other expenses which we can detail,
including manager, personnel, mainte
nance, waiters, etc., we offer $20,000 as a
close value. The total is $121,081.76,
leaving a balance to go to the sinking
fund of between $11,000 and $12,000 —a
large amount.
5. The general dissatisfaction with the
food in the Commons has become a very
real factor, and we know that quite a good
many men who formerly ate there by
choice have left. To cite all the particular
complaints which we have received would
take considerable space but we cannot re
frain quoting several of the most fre
quent: 1. Predominance of beef, in all
forms, iti menu. 2. Canned vegetables,
rather tasteless. 3. Unsatisfactory pre
paration, using left-overs in all sorts of
makeshift dishes. 4. Monotony and actual
lack of enough to go around.
In view the these statements, we offer
the following:
1. Abolition of the board of control as
it exists at present, having direct student
management, which we can demonstrate
has proved to be a on the campus
where tried.
2. Direct University supervision with
out an organization go-between, consisting
of three members, one appointed by the
University, one elected by all the students
at large in a general election, and one ap
pointed by some method which can be sug
gested.
3. Choice of menu between two or more
things, and higher quality of food and
better preparation by a steward whose
business shall be that and nothing else,
and who shall be appointed subject to re
call.
4. The enlargement of the present gen
eral managership and of the Director of
the Eating Halls on the University, for it
seems to be too big a job to he adequately
handled by the present personnel.
We wish, in conclusion, to call it to the
attention of the reader that it is poor con
ditions which actually exist which has
compelled our attention to the subject, and
we repeat that we have been actuated by
a desire to help make the said Commons a
better, more efficient, and more pleasant
place to eat in.

and we feel that there is room for im
provement. On this account we submit
the following:
1. The Board of Control of Encina
Commons is inadequate and cannot man
age the commons, for the following rea
sons : 1. The student members as a rule
know nothing about restaurant or com
mons managing. 2. The system of rep
resentation means nothing because should
there be complaints the representative
hesitates to turn them in to the commons.
This is because (a) it is a criticism of the
management of which he is part; (b) the
criticism reflects on him and creates feel
ing in meetings; (c) he disregards the
complaints because he thinks they are
either too trivial or not sp. 3. The Uni
versity management completely dominates
the situation, rendering student participa
tion in name only and consequently value
less.
2. We understand that the breakage is
taken out of the regular fees for meals.
We submit, with tl]e authority of a man
who has had some experience in handling
this angle : 1. The evidence that breakage
cannot be restrained is evident of loose
management, because (a) the Board of
Control does not restrain it, which it can
do; (b) there are 110 active attempts to
bring before the students the necessity of
being careful. 2. That breakage, even if
it does exist, should not be paid out of
those fees; since breakage does exist, the
students should pav for it as an extra fee.
Such an action would stop much of the
breakage.
3. We understand that the commons is
a separate organization and pays 10 per
cent rent to the University for the use of
the building. We are of the opinion that
this is a clumsy way of doing things, and
costs more to the student. We understand
that the University policy is to give the
students the most for the money but when
tlys rental must be met it defeats this
purpose.
4. Relative to the costs we submit some
figures. On the authority of the men in
charge we place 550 as a conservative es
timate of the number of men eating there.
At an individual charge of $80 a quarter
this brings an income of $132,000 a school
year. Out of this $13,200 goes to the
University for rent. In a report which
came out recently which was given as ap
proximate, the costs of meals for the
month of October were $0,764.64, which
if continued throughout the school year
would be equivalent to $87,881.76. Of
the other expenses which we can detail,
including manager, personnel, mainte
nance, waiters, etc., we offer $20,000 as a
close value. The total is $121,081.76,
leaving a balance to go to the sinking
fund of between $11,000 and $12,000 —a
large amount.
5. The general dissatisfaction with the
food in the Commons has become a very
real factor, and we know that quite a good
many men who formerly ate there by
choice have left. To cite all the particular
complaints which we have received would
take considerable space but we cannot re
frain quoting several of the most fre
quent: 1. Predominance of beef, in all
forms, iti menu. 2. Canned vegetables,
rather tasteless. 3. Unsatisfactory pre
paration, using left-overs in all sorts of
makeshift dishes. 4. Monotony and actual
lack of enough to go around.
In view the these statements, we offer
the following:
1. Abolition of the board of control as
it exists at present, having direct student
management, which we can demonstrate
has proved to be a on the campus
where tried.
2. Direct University supervision with
out an organization go-between, consisting
of three members, one appointed by the
University, one elected by all the students
at large in a general election, and one ap
pointed by some method which can be sug
gested.
3. Choice of menu between two or more
things, and higher quality of food and
better preparation by a steward whose
business shall be that and nothing else,
and who shall be appointed subject to re
call.
4. The enlargement of the present gen
eral managership and of the Director of
the Eating Halls on the University, for it
seems to be too big a job to he adequately
handled by the present personnel.
We wish, in conclusion, to call it to the
attention of the reader that it is poor con
ditions which actually exist which has
compelled our attention to the subject, and
we repeat that we have been actuated by
a desire to help make the said Commons a
better, more efficient, and more pleasant
place to eat in.
Very sincerely yours,

The Editor,
Sir: For the present quarter a group of
men who eat at Encina Commons have
formed an observation committee 011 con
ditions existing there. They have decided
to submit for the consideration of the
campus several suggestions which they be
lieve would be of service in bettering these
conditions. We wish to stress the fact
that we are not trying to criticise for the
