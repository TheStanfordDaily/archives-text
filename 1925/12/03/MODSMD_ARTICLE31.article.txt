KNICKERBOCKER'S DIARY
Sunday—Just recovering from t a
strenuous Thanksgiving vacation. Glad
to get back to college for a rest. That
turkey was sure a well-exercised bird.
Wish I could remember the name of
that woman I took out last Friday
night. Think it was either Henrietta
Fisher or Georgette Hunter. It rained]
so hard at home yesterday that the
front lawn floated out into the street.
Monday—Had an examination in
poly sci this morning. Think the pro
-1 feasor put the wrong questions on the
board because I can't remember ever
having heard of the things he asked
before. Tried to study last night but
( couldn't because the guys next door
were playing a game of poker and
they bothered me so that I Anally had
j to sit in on it. Saw a freshman today
! wearing a djnk. Think he must have
been either crazy or drunk.
Tuesday—Went around and helped
, the sophomores sink their yacht today.
Also got a blind date for the cotillion.
Wonder who borrowed my tuxedo last; j
can't tind it. Don't think pa's f.d. would
look so good on me. Played interclass
basketball today and missed fifteen
baskets. Think they ought to make the
basket larger so as to make the game
i more exciting.
Wednesday—Got my poly sci ex !
paper back today. The big bum only
gave me 19. The guy that, sits next
i to me got 95. Think he must send the
i professor a box of apples at least
every month. Can't understand it. I
copied almost everything from his
1 paper and took time out three times
|to study besides.
Thursday—Took a woman to the
movies last night. On the way back to
| the campus from the show I ran out of
gas fifteen miles from town. Better
J luck next time.
♦ * *
Now that Red Grange has taken up j
professional football the ice business
j is in great danger of a collapse.
* * *
We wonder how long it will be be
fore football is introduced as a uni
j versity major.
* * *
i i
Here's a slag to Peter Busher,
The world's prize bum and cookie-'
pusher.
His hair is glued with fragrtint Jiffy; !
; His spats are neat, his cane is spiffy. j
j He sees a female-laden sofa
And pipes, "Ah, say, old deali's, move j
ovah!"
. He sports his fame as "The Cake- j
eater;"
So toss it off to Darling Peter. —L.A.B. j

KNICKERBOCKER'S DIARY
Sunday—Just recovering from t a
strenuous Thanksgiving vacation. Glad
to get back to college for a rest. That
turkey was sure a well-exercised bird.
Wish I could remember the name of
that woman I took out last Friday
night. Think it was either Henrietta
Fisher or Georgette Hunter. It rained]
so hard at home yesterday that the
front lawn floated out into the street.
Monday—Had an examination in
poly sci this morning. Think the pro
-1 feasor put the wrong questions on the
board because I can't remember ever
having heard of the things he asked
before. Tried to study last night but
( couldn't because the guys next door
were playing a game of poker and
they bothered me so that I Anally had
j to sit in on it. Saw a freshman today
! wearing a djnk. Think he must have
been either crazy or drunk.
Tuesday—Went around and helped
, the sophomores sink their yacht today.
Also got a blind date for the cotillion.
Wonder who borrowed my tuxedo last; j
can't tind it. Don't think pa's f.d. would
look so good on me. Played interclass
basketball today and missed fifteen
baskets. Think they ought to make the
basket larger so as to make the game
i more exciting.
Wednesday—Got my poly sci ex !
paper back today. The big bum only
gave me 19. The guy that, sits next
i to me got 95. Think he must send the
i professor a box of apples at least
every month. Can't understand it. I
copied almost everything from his
1 paper and took time out three times
|to study besides.
Thursday—Took a woman to the
movies last night. On the way back to
| the campus from the show I ran out of
gas fifteen miles from town. Better
J luck next time.

Now that Red Grange has taken up j
professional football the ice business

Here's a slag to Peter Busher,
The world's prize bum and cookie-'

His hair is glued with fragrtint Jiffy; !

And pipes, "Ah, say, old deali's, move j
