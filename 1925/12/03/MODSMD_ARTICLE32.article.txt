Western team will meet an Eastern,
At the Shriners' big affair;
! Muller, Garbisch, Sprott, and others
' Are preparing to be there.
Basketballers who are lighter
1 Than a hundred forty-six
Get together under Davis,
1 Learning basketballers' tricks.
Freshmen hold a mammoth meeting
For the purpose of deciding
i If they will observe traditions,
i And be meek and law-abiding.
â€¢
So we tremble in our fearing,
Of the upperclassmen's fall,
If our wayward freshman rulers
Won't obey no laws at all.
1 Associated Women's prexy,
While attending her convention.
Will look over Eastern schools, and
Bring ideas to our attention.
