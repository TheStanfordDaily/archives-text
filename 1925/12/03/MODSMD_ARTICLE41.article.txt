"The student does not come to college j
to learn things, to store an intellectual'
garret with an assortment of odds and
ends. He comes to college to learn how
to learn, what to learn, where to learn,
and why to learn," Dr. Henry Merritt
\\ riston declared in the speech which I
marked his formal inauguration as presi- j
dent of Lawrence College.
