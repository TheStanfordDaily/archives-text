# TURKISH GIRLS STRIKE
## 
### 
Though Turkish girls have only
within the past few years entered the
industrial and business world, they
have already learned how to go on a
strike, as shown by a telephone oper
ators' walkout in Constantinople. The
telephone operators of Constantinople
organized a union some three months
ago and have laid before the directors
of the company, an English concern,
a demand for a 50' per cent increase
in salaries. The present average wage
for a "Hello Girl" is 25 liras, or about
$15 a month. Chief operators receive
less than $18, while some of the girls
receive only $11.
