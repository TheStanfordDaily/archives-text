# TRADITION ABOLISHED

### 
The University of Washington lost
one of its prize freshman restrictions
when it was decided that the rear en
trance of Meany hall was to be per
manently closed. This was the only
entrance that the freshmen were for
merly allowed to use. The rule that
freshman women should wear a green
ribbon was retained, though.
