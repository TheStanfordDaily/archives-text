## 
### 
Chief Clear Sky, of Tioroniatttah, of
the Iroquois Indians, who is singing
at the Warfleld, in San Francisco, this
week, played end with the first team
Pop Warner coached. After Pop War
ner left Cornell he coached the Car
lisle Indians in Pennsylvania, who
came out in 1903 and defeated Stan
ford 4 to 0.
Chief Clear Sky is singing at the
various theatres in the West to fur
ther interest in his people. "There
are a great many young Indians who
are anxious for a higher education,"
he says, "but who have not way of
obtaining it. They are given eleven
dollars a year to live on by the United
States Government, and enough money
for college is hard for them to earn.
After they leave college there is no
place for them in the white man's
world. They go back to their reserva
tions, and try to help their people.
There are no opportunities for them
elsewhere. That is why you can find
only a few Indians with more than a
high school education.
"Although the young Indian today
is modernized, he is retaining an in
terest in the traditions of his race. He
is interested in the old sports, and
stories of the Indians. He brings out
his ceremonial dress for the powwows
every other Sunday. I will say that
the most popular game with the young
men is football."
