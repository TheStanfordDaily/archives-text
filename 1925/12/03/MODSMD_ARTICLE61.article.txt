### 
"Educational and Vocational Guid
ance, A Consideration of Guidance as
It Relates to All of the Essential Ac-!
tivities of Life," by William Martin
Proctor, associate professor of Educa
tion, has just been published by the
Houghton Mifflin Publishing Company.
The book will form a new volume in
the Riverside series of textbooks on
education.
The guidance movement, which is
the basis of the book, was begun about
two decades ago by men and women
whose attention had been called
through child welfare work to the
many misfits in life and industry. The
movement now includes study of in
dividual capacities and interests, the
organization of a long-continued pro
gram in studies, health building, social,
and character-building activities, and
sound civic training.
In the past, such service has been
rendered by a central bureau with a
special staff. This method has been
proven to be both costly and ineffi
cient. It is now being gradually han
dled in a decentralized way through
teachers and principals. To date, few
teachers have had much training in
this type of work.
Proctor, in his book, has put forth
the various elements in guidance work
and has tried to show how each may
be handled, so that teachers may get
definite help in their work. It offers as
well definite suggestions as to the or
ganization and administration of a
guidance plan.
The text is suitable for use in uni
versity classes in educational and vo
cational guidance, extension courses
in the training of classroom teachers
in this field, and for reading circle
groups interested in the broader as
pects of the guidance movement.
