### 
Members of the California Federa
tion of Women's Clubs, at Fresno,
have arranged a fund for college girls
who have attained junior standing or
above, by which the girls may borrow
sums up to $240 at 4 per cent for a
semester. The payments can be made
either quarterly or monthly, and the
girls are allowed to go to any school
they wish.
