All of the important eastern women's
| colleges will be visited by Mildred
jWorswick, president of Associated
Women Students, during her trip to
| the east coast and the National Colle
giate World Court Conference to be
held at Princeton December 11 and 12.
I Each college will be studied for sug
! gestions that will benefit Stanford.
I The questions that are particularly
'problems at Stanford now will be those
most carefully studied.
Bryn Mawr, Vassar, Smith. Welles
ley, RadclilYe, Barnard, and Emma
Willard, a prominent preparatory
school, are on the itinerary, and other
'colleges will be visited if time allows.
Probe Dormitory Life
Miss Worswick will look particu
larly into the questions of dormitory
i life, self-government, health, and the
! point system. Both the arrangement
j of the dormitories and the life in them
j will be studied for suggestions for fu
iture dormitories at Stanford. In con
| neciion with self-government, the ex
; tent of its use, the problems they have
j found in connection with it, and the
I enforcement of all their regulations
I will be investigated.
To help formulate the point system
to be considered at Stanford, the num

her of activities the women go into
and how well they do them will be j
noted, and whether they concentrate :
in one activity or participate in many. !
As all the executive work in these i
colleges is done by women, Miss Wors-)
wick will look for suggestions of pos- j
sible fields now occupied solely by |
men that Stanford might enter.
Have Outside Interests?
She will also try to find out if these j
women have any interests outside of j
college, and if so, what they are. At!
Stanford the interests are concen- \
trated in the college community and :
she wishes to find out if it is the
same at other colleges.
Ideas and suggestions for the man- j
agnment and production of the Fiesta j
will be taken from the similar produc-:
tions of these colleges. May Day at
Bryn Mawr will be particularly
studied.
Miss Worswick will begin her (
studies of these colleges after she at- j
tends the World Court Conference at I
Princeton, and will return to Stanford \
January 6, for the winter quarter. Wo- j
men's Conference is sending her so:
that Stanford may have the advan- j
tages of the experiences of all the |
women's colleges with these subjects.
