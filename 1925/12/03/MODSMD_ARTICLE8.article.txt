# EUPHRONIA-MILLS DEBATERS MEET IN FORENSIC CONTEST
## Speakers Consider Question Of Younger Generation's Freedom 
### 
Mills College, represented by Mil
dred Raymond and Elizabeth Ramsay,
; was the opponent of the Euphronia
| Debating Society of Stanford, repre
sented by Harold \V. Peterson and
j Herbert F. Smith in a no-decision de
i bate last evening on the question, "Re
j solved, That the freedom of the
! younger generation is a serious men
jace tri society."
Smith, who opened the debate for
; Euphronia, pointed out the general
' carelessness, recklessness, "superin
: telligence," and irresponsibility that
:is typical of the so-called "younger
1 generation." Jazz, slang, petting par
ties, and drinking were given as illus
: trations of this generally prevalent
| situation. Examples of "riding the
! rails," bootlegging, disregard for reli
gious and moral standards, were all
quoted by the affirmative speaker as
! instances of the modern day "free
; dom."
j Miss Raymond, speaking first for
! the negative, based her arguments on
the facts that the younger generation
j is unable to influence society of today
i because they are not in a position in
i society to do so, and that little or no
i attention is paid to their opinions. Her
| second point was that modern crime
conditions were due to poor environ
; mental and hereditary conditions rath
| er than to the "freedom" allowed, and
j that excessive drinking today is due
i to the passage of the Volstead amend
; ment which has aroused natural an
! tipatliy on the part of the general
| public. The next speaker, Peterson,
| attempted to show how the harmless
practices of youth were menaces to
! society by bringing about contempt for
law and by loosening the ties of the
i family and the sanctity of marriage.
Miss Ramsay, the second speaker
I for the negative, declared that by the
1 freedom allowed youth, the young men
and women are enabled to gain ex
\ perience for maturity by trial and
error, while the consequences are
: slight.
Following the rebuttals of three
minutes each, an opportunity was
1 given the audience for discussion of
! the question.
