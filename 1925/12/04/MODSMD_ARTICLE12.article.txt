# WILLIAM L. BRYAN DESCRIBES THREE LIFE PERSPECTIVES
## President of Indiana Tells University Assembly Of World s Needs 
### 
"Man has made enormous strides in the
mastery of nature but has still to develop
mastery of himself," said Dr. William
Lowe P>ryan, president of the University
of Indiana, introducing his speech on
the subject of "Life Seen from Three
Stages," in the University assembly hall
this morning at 9 o'clock. President Wil
bur introduced Dr. Jordan, who was
given an ovation by the student body. Dr.
Jordan told in a few words of his early
association with Bryan many years ago
when one was president of Indiana Uni
versity and the other an undergraduate
there. He presented Dr. Bryan as "one
of my favorite pupils."
Life as seen from the three stages of
romantic sentimentalism, pessimistic,
realism, and hopeful understanding
huVnanism presents very different aspects,
according to Dr. Bryan. Those whose
point of view is the first or most distant
stage see everything in a rosy haze of op
timism. They believe that "all's right with
the world," but Dr. Bryan showed how
many in the midst of things were definite
ly and radically wrong with the present
day scheme of things. The second group
look at the harsh and hitter realities of
things as they are, and are consequently
pessimistic and doubtful of man's ability
to better himself spiritually. The last, and
most desirable attitude according to Dr.
Bryan, was that o$ those scientists,
teachers, and prophets who see the evils
about them, but are not discouraged or
made to lose hope by them.
"If there wefe more of the principle
used in scicnce and industry found in
government and social relations today
we might see a corresponding advance
in the latter. I mean the principle of
testing a thing by its results only, and
not by its newness or antiquity," said
Dr. Bryan.
