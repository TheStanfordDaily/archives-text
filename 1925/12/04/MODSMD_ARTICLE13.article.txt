# SOPHOMORES USHER IN WEEK-END WITH COTILLION TONIGHT
## 
### 
With preparation for the 1928 Cotillion
practically completed, all is in readiness
for the dance which will open the activi
ties of the annual Sophomore week-end.
The opening event of the program will
be the Cotillion, which will be held from
9 to 1 o'clock this evening in the basket
ball pavilion.
Decorations for the affair were com
peted this afternoon by sophomores work
ing under the direction of John B. Craig,
who has contracted for the Cotillion
decorations. The pavilion has been en
circled by curtains of tied and dyed cloth,
bordered by a garden wall. The artificial
ceiling has been fastened to the top
girders, thus allowing plenty of space for
ventilation.
One end of the pavilion has been left
open for the roughs. The lighting dis
play will be effected by directing the pa
valion spotlights down, the sides of the
many-hued curtain walls. Several pen
dants will be suspended from the ceiling.
Music for the Cotillion will l>e fur
nished by Rudy Sciger and his tiftecn
piece novelty orchestra. The orchestra
will play from a platform directly op
posite the pavilion entrance instead of
from one end as in previous affairs. The
Cotillion committee has made arrange
ments to use the Toyon piano which is
the best musical instrument of this type
on the campus.
A buffet supper will be served in the
pavilion between the sixth and seventh
dances. In former years refreshments
have been served in the Encina dining
halls, but the committee decided to
change this custom because of incon
venience caused by unfavorable weather
conditions.
Events of the week-end will close with
the mystery play, "In the Next Room,"
which will be given Saturday night in
the Assembly hall under the direction of
Gordon Davis.
