## Felix Mendelssohn's 'Sonata, Bach's 'Pastorale' on Allen's Program 
### Herbert Klein 
Reuben I. Rinder, cantor of Temple
Emanuel, San Francisco, will be the
vocal soloist at Warren I). Allen's
organ recital in the Memorial Church
next Sunday afternoon at 4 o'clock.
He will sing "Two Bible Songs" by
Anton Dvorak. Rinder is noted as one
of the finest cantors on the coast, and
has a very rich and pleasing voice.
A notable group of organ solos make
up the rest of the program, which
opens with "Sonata No. 3 in A major"
by Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy. Men
delssohn wrote six great organ so
natas in all. He was interested in
organ composition all through his brief
life, and was instrumental in unearth
ing and preserving for the world the
manuscripts of John Sebastian Bach's
music, priceless musical treasures.
"Pastorale" on Program
A "Pastorale" by Bach will be on
the program. The "Pastorale" was a
regular and popular musical form of
which Bach wrote many. It is charm
ing and graceful in style. This one
was composed originally for a duet of
wind instruments â€”flute and oboe. Its
arrangement for the organ is due to
Charles Marie Widor, one of the great
est living organ players and com
posers.
Widor is organist of St. Sulpice in
Paris and has written ten symphonies
for the organ which are among the
most scholarly works in modern organ
music. The "Pastorale" is taken from
a series of his recent transcriptions
entitled "Bach Memento."
Following "Serenade" by Farjeon,
Allen will play "Finale from the Suite
in D," a work of Edward Shippen
Barnes.
Dvorak Great Composer
Anton Dvorak, composer of the "Two
Bible Songs," was Bohemia's greatest
composer. He wrote in all forms but
was marked by his* consistent employ
ment of rhythm and melody from the
folksongs of his native land. He has
been called "the greatest master of
the art of national expression in all
music history."
For several years he made his home
in New York and upon his return to
Europe gave the world his greatest
work, the "New World Symphony,"
dedicated to this country. This is the
best-known composition in America.
In vocal music he was a master.
Among choral compositions his "Re
quiem Mass" and "Stabat Mater" rank
high.
