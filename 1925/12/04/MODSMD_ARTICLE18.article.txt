# SMOKING, QUEENING RULES VOIDED BY FIRST YEAR MEN
## Dinks Criticized; Class Will Ballot on Discarding Traditional Caps 
### 
Freshmen should be allowed to
smoke cigarettes and "queen" on the
Quad, it was unanimously decided at
a meeting of the class of 1929 held
last night in the Little Theatre. Sam
uel S. Hayes, 1929 class president, pre
sided. The question of wearing "dinks"
will be decided by a ballot of the
whole class, as no definite agreement
could be reached at the meeting last
night.
The class also voted to award
sweaters to all members of the fresh
man soccer squad who are granted
numerals by the Executive Commit
tee.
Although many students contended
that it is not up to the freshmen to
make a final decision regarding the
carrying out of these customs, a mo
tion to ask the upperclassmen for
definite regulations was voted down
because of their seeming indifference
as to the fate of freshman traditions.
That the freshmeri should have
some insignia to mark their class was
generally approved, but there were
many criticisms of the present "dink."
"Dinks are the worst excuse for a
class emblem that can possibly be
found. If they aren't smack on the top
of the head they can't be seen any
way"—"dinks are uncomfortable"—
"the large colleges do not require
freshmen to wear dinks; the small
ones are the only ones which do."
Thus ran the discussion, which at mo
ments threatened to lift the roof from
the Little Theatre.
Charles Dickenson, speaking as a
senior, said that it should not be left
to the upperclassmen to enforce these
traditions, but that the freshmen
themselves should assume the re
sponsibility. "Dinks," he said, "may
be uncomfortable, but nevertheless,
they are are convenient; and what is
most important, they have been suc
cessful in the past."
