# SOPHOMORES LOSE TO SENIOR HOCKEY TEAM IN DECIDING GAME
## 
### 
Disorganized by the loss of two of
their regular backfield players, the
sophomores lost a championship
series hockey game to the seniors yes
terday afternoon, 6 to 0. Passes from
Millison Hardy, left inside, to Cecil
Feusier, center forward, gave the sen
iors four of their scores. The other
two were made by Doris Kildale and
Miss Hardy.
The sophomores played much bet
ter in the first part of the game than
in the second period, holding the
upperclass team to one score for the
half. The second-year women tired
easily, however, and in the second half
their backfield went to pieces. Fum
bles on the part of their inexperienced
backs were frequent.
Frances Clancy and Dorothy Cone,
center forward and left inside re
spectively, did the best playing for
the sophomores, but neither of them
was up to usual form. For the seniors,
Alida Israel, inside, did some good
work, and Mildred Worswick. playing
her last game for the Class of 1926,
defended the goal capably. The entire
senior team was much stronger and
better organized than the sophomore
team.
This game makes the junior-senior
tilt next Tuesday the championship
contest. Both the juniors and the sen
iors are undefeated. Each team has
won two games.
