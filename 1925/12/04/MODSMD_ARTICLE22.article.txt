# Sacrifice in Sport
## 
### 
Northwestern University, through its football team and other repre
sentatives, recently conceded the Big Ten football championship for 1925
to Michigan. This was indeed sportsmanship at the expense of the sacri
lice of a championship claim.
This claim by both institutions to the title was at the best doubtful be
cause of defeats by both, giving each a theoretical title. Michigan had
played more conference games, however, and although defeated by North
western, the latter gracefully retired into the background and gave Michi
gan the honors.
Any championship in these days of upsets and this Year of Reversals
is apt to be an empty and doubtful honor, but to Northwestern, for years
the "weak sister" of the Big Ten Conference, it would have meant many
seasons' hopes fulfilled. And theoretically, it might now be standing on
as firm ground as the Yost aggregation in the newspaper battle for rights
which always follows such disputes.
One wonders what prompts such sacrifices in sport but soon forgets to
wonder in the praise that is awarded such action. "Pop" Warner ac
claimed an unknown on the Stanford eleven who rooted for his rival's
success even though the latter was defeating his own chances. A team now
chooses to take a back seat out of the spotlight when it had a perfect right
to argue its claims.
The sports world seems to prefer fair play. In fact sports is built on
such a principle and unconciously its adherents jealously cling to it.
North western's action was probably spontaneous and the Stanford sub
stitute's undoubtedly so. Without such firm adherence it is doubtful if
sport would have such a wprld-wide following and such a continuous ex
istence .
Which proves nothing but gives us unqualified satisfaction.
