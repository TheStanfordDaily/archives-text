# Stanford Songs
## 
### 
The question of appropriate college songs lias troubled some one other
than the Daily Palo Alto. A month ago the Daily backed a "Campus
Opinion" letter it received which suggested to the Rally Committee that
new songs be composed for Stanford to replace the mediocre ones in use.
Now comes Harry Archer, a college man and prominent song writer,
to apply Stanford's need to the entire nation of universities. Archer be
lieves that the tremendous dramatic spectacle involved in a modern college
game, viewed by many thousands, has one notable weaknessâ€”the lack of
appropriate college songs. In his opinion, the huge partisan crowds at a
footl)all game should form an ideal chorus for spirited, original tunes;
but he further believes that none exist.
The songs that are popular, he states, can all be traced to-other than
original sources and have their beginnings in English drinking songs and
like ditties.
To eliminate this objectionable feature, a concerted effort among col
lege students toward the evolution of school tunes expressing real indi
viduality and personality rather than imitation is recommended by Archer.
"The football game is not unlike a musical comedy," the song writer
has explained. "The band and student body singing before the game is
the overture. The game play, the dialogue; and the intermission between
halves compares with the entire act with the 'students plugging at the
songs again.
"No stage presentation holds anywhere near the public interest and
enthusiasm commanded by the big games of today."
And the Daily joins with Archer in stating, "But how they do need
good songs to express that enthusiasm!"
