Cigarette smoking makes big strong men out of little boys and queen
ing on the Quad is becoming to freshmenâ€”so decided the first year men
in a conclave on traditions in the Little Theatre last night. The freshmen
felt that Dinks are uncomfortable, but they agreed to leave it to a vote of
the entire class whether they should abolish Dink wearing formally or
whether they should just not do it, as is the custom now.
It took some thirty years for the traditions mentioned to develop and
the 1929 class has taken a rather presumptuous attitude in feeling itself
qualified to ring the bell on the entire system. We might remind them
that they have overlooked the law steps, the senior bench, the "hello"
custom, the match carrying habit, and a few other incidentals. Perhaps
another meeting should be held to recommend that upperclassmen forsake
the law steps and senior lxmch, say "hello" first, and carry matches for the
freshmen cigarettes.
The first year students might as well make a good job of it now that
they have started their upheaval. A freshmen committee for the guidance
of the University Board of Trustees could be considered at the next
meeting.
