FA BLE OF PO-KEY PRU-NIEL-LA
Pru-nel-la was the High School
Pride. She was the Shin-ing Ex-arable
which the Profs Used to Spur La zy
Ladies to their Stu-dies. "See Her,
She will be Fa-mous Some day." No
bod-y Da-ted her at All, and She whs
Con-sid-ered the Le-raon on the Tree
of Know-ledge. Only the Ve-ry Brain-v
were No-ticed a-round Her. She
Pulled down a Flock of A's E-very
Quar-ter. and she Fi-nal-ly made the
Ho-nor Roll.
Then she Went to a Fi-nish-ing
School. Her Am-bi-tion was Reached.
She dis-card-ed her Old Clothes (buy
ing New Ones, of Course) and ltig-ged
out In a Brand New Co-ver-ing. She
De-cor-ated her Face with Qoo, her
Knees with Pictures, her Eari with
Dia-monds. She got a Date. It was a
Cold Night, but She didn't Know it
Un-til she Read about It in the Morn
ing Pa per. She Fi-nal-ly be-carae Fa
mous, E-ven as the Profs had Pre
dicted.

It would be wise for all freshmen to
fasten -their heads firmly on their

sell them to them, thereby closing 1 lie
famous "something for nothing" deal.

A recent D. P. A. records the inter

classes was taken to see a moving
picture entitled "The Eve of Revolu

moan and groan about the degeneracy
of the movies, none of them are
