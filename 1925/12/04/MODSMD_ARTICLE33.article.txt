# SIXTEEN STANFORD RUGBY PLAYERS MAY TOUR TO VANCOUVER
## Coach Harry Maloney Takes California Eleven to Canada Christmas 
### 
Stanford will be well represented
on the California rugby team which
will play in Canada during Christmas
vacation. Sixteen men who have played
rugby at Stanford are among the
fifty-two applicants for positions on
the California team which is being
trained by the ex-Stanford coach,
Harry Maloney. It is expected that
over ten Cardinal players will make
the trip.
Last year Harry Maloney took a
squad, which included eight Stanford
men, to Canada. This will be the sixth
time the trip has been made, and
never has the American team lost the
majority of its games. Last year the
team won two games and lost one.
The University of British Columbia
was beaten 9 to 0 and the Canadian
All-Stars 15 to 0 while the Vancouver
Rowing Club won from the Califor
nians by a 3 to 0 score.
Three Games Scheduled
This year the regular three games
will be played. The first contest is
scheduled with the University of Brit
ish Columbia on Christmas Day. On
December 26 the Californians will op
pose the Vancouver Rowing Club, and
the final game of the series will be
played on New Year's Day. Coach
Maloney plans to take a squad of
nineteen players on the trip. All ex
penses are guaranteed by the Cana
dians. The team plans to leave Decem
