# California "Occident" Taken From University Control
## 
### 
The English Club of the University
of California, publishers of the "Occi
dent," suppressed student publication,
officially voted to separate from the
University at a meeting last night.
Suppression of the "Occident" came
as a result of an alleged blasphemous
article, "Immanual," written by Don
ald Wliliams, which incited faculty
objection. Lewis Russell, editor of the
publication, was placed on probation,
while the author of the article was
deprived of a fellowship.
jf/dered out of office by the execu
tive committee of Associated Students,
Russell refused to quit his position,
and backed by the English Club, legal
owners of the "Occident" and of the
"Pelican," retaliated with the notice
that the publication would be with
drawn from student control. Official
confirmation was made by the English
Club at its meeting last night.

The stairs of the oldest building at the
University of Nebraska have been rebuilt,
after having been in use for the last 55
years.
