# STANFORD FACULTY OFFERS PSYCHOLOGY OF MUSIC COURSE
## 
### 
A three-liour course on the psycho
logy of music will be offered for the
first time during the winter quarter.
Attention will be given to music tests
and a critical analysis will be made
of them. This phase of the work will
include standardized school tests of
musical aptitude and musical achieve
ment. Later in the course a survey
will be made of the art principles un
derlying music appreciation.
The study of musical talent and the
analysis of the art principals involved
in music form two important phases
of the psychology of music. Work
along these lines is now in progress
under the direction of Dr. P. R. Farns
worth of the Psychology department.
Research has shown that musical
talent does not correlate highly with
intelligence as tested by mental tests.
Special aptitude tests are therefore
being developed at different labora
tories for the prognostication of suc
cess in the music field. The most note
worthy so far produced have been
those of Seashore of the University
of lowa, Schoen of Carnegie Institute,
and Max Meyer of the University of
Missouri. Dr. Seashore spoke to the
Stanford students while on a trip to
the coast last year.
The Seashore tests have been ex
tensively used and have proved worth
while, but are tests of simple psycho
physical functions rather than of
music. The development of further
music tests is necessary because of
this fact and the knowledge that there
are probably many specific music abili
ties. The present studies at the psy
chology laboratory include a standard
ization of one of the Max Meyer tests
and the development of a new test.
The object of the Max Meyer test is
to ascertain the ability of the subject
to discriminate gross mistiming and
also to classify tunes as "major" or
"minor." This new test deals with
what the musician calls, the tonic or
keynote.
