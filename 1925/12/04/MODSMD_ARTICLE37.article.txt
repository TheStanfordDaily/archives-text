### 
Pomona College R. O. T. C. band
has objected to the wearing of mili
tary uniforms at football games and
concerts. All objection ceased when
the members were given the choice of
wearing the uniforms or discarding
the instruments for the rifle.

A rare book, printed in 1683, has been
added to the Redpath Library at McGill
as the two hundred thousandth book in
the collection.
