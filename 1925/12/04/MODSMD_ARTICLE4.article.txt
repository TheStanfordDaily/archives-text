# SCORES GIVE 1927 CAGERS APPARENT EDGE OVER BABES
## First-Year Men Show Better Brand of Basketball In Opening Games 
### Fred Hines 
Comparative scores give the junior
quintet the edge over the freshman hoop
men in the fourth game of the interclass
basketball series to be played Monday
afternoon at 4:45 o'clock in Encina gym
nasium. Comparative ■ scores often fail
to tell the whole tale.
The freshmen only beat the 1928 team
by a 16 to 15 score. The seniors de
feated the sophomores 12 to 4, thus show
ing that the 1926 team is seyen points
better than the freshmen. As the juniors
won over the seniors, 10 to 7, the com
parative scores would indicate that the
juniors should defeat the freshmen by
ten points. The junior-freshmen game,
however, will probably result in a vic
tory for the babes," thus running true to
the form of interclass games and upset
ting the dope.
In the first place the babes have greater
reserve strength than the 1927 quintet,
which, after playing one game, they will
know better how to use. Secondly, the
1929 men have Husky Hunt as coach.
The juniors' squad is weakened by the
ruling that no varsity men may play in
the series. Still, Rodney George at for
ward and Menzies at center can run com
petition against Sherman Crary and
Johnnie McCandless, babe forward and
center. On the whole, the freshmen have
a faster, shiftier team, while the juniors
have the edge in weight.
If the babes succeed in chalking up a
win over the junior quintet Monday, they
will, unless upsets occur, be practically
assured of the title, for they will have
only the seniors to beat for a 100 per cent
standing. In case the 1929 men do not
down the juniors, the third-year team will
be the logical class for the championship,
unless they strike a snag in the sopho
mores.
The percentage standing of the four
teams is as follows:
Team Won Lost Pet.
Juniors 1 0 1000
Freshmen 1 0 1000
Seniors 11 .500
Sophomores 0 2 .000

win over the junior quintet Monday, they
will, unless upsets occur, be practically
assured of the title, for they will have
only the seniors to beat for a 100 per cent
standing. In case the 1929 men do not
down the juniors, the third-year team will
be the logical class for the championship,
unless they strike a snag in the sopho
mores.
The percentage standing of the four
teams is as follows:
Team Won Lost Pet.
Juniors 1 0 1000
Freshmen 1 0 1000
Seniors 11 .500
Sophomores 0 2 .000
