# BASKETBALL MEN SHOW IMPROVED FORM IN PRACTICE
## Coach Andy Kerr Tries New Combination; Nevers and Steele May Return 
### Jim Adams 
The varsity basketball team, in a
spirited scrimmage last night, showed
the best form that has been displayed
since the squad started practice.
Coach Andy Kerr tried another com
bination in his efforts to find the five
men that work together the most
smoothly.
Bill Clark and Nelson David played
at forwards, while Byron Bryant was
given a try at center and Ralph Young
at standing guard. Captain Fred Price
filled the running guard berth, where
he has been shifted this year from
forward. Whether Kerr has found his
best working combination in this five
would be hard to predict, for the sea
son is still young.
Practice During Vacation
The announcement yesterday of the
definite intention of Gurdon Steele to
return to school gives Kerr another
valuable man who can work in either
at center or at standing guard. Steele
will probably start practicing with the
squad next week. There are also some
rumors that Ernie Nevers would re
turn some time soon to work out with
the team. There is probably a greater
wealth of material this year than any
coach has found on the court at Stan
ford for a number of years.
Only a few days will be taken off
during Christmas vacation, since it is
planned to practice nearly the whole
period. Training table for the squad
is being conducted at the Union every
night during the holidays.
Word has not been received as yet
from the San Jose Teachers College
as to whether the game scheduled.for
December 12 with them will be post
poned to December 19. The next game
is not to be played until after vaca
tion, when the team journeys to Stock
ton to oppose the Amblers Club there.
Play Trojans in L. A.
The only other trip the team will
make, excluding those to Berkeley for
the California games, will be to Los
Angeles where they are scheduled to
play the University of California Tro
jans on February 5 and 6. The south
ern college is reported to have the
strongest basketball five on the ooast
this year. California also boasts of
having practically the same quintet as
the one that defeated the Cards last
season.
