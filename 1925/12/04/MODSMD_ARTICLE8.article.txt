# SENATE URGED TO DECIDE ON U. S. ENTERING COURT
## Resolution Adopted by Big Majority at Assembly Hall Meeting 
### 
A resolution urging that the United
States take a definite stand in regard
to the World Court question was
passed almost unanimously at a meet
ing held last night in the Assembly
hall. The complete resolution read as
follows: "Whereas, we believe that
the United States should make up its
mind whether it desires to participate
in the World Court and thus join the
other nations of the world in an at
tempt to substitute law for war in the
settling of international disputes. Be
it resolved, that a meeting of the Palo
Alto-Stanford community urge that the
Senate of the United States proceed
to a record vote upon the question of
adherence to the World Court as soon
after December 17 as is compatible
with adequate debate."
Questions From Floor
Various questions were brought up
from the floor. Professor R. L. Green
presented a question asking the defini
tion of adequate debate. William L.
Gosslin suggested that the meeting go
on record as favoring entrance into
the World Court. Professor Victor J.
West of the Political Science depart
ment said that in his opinion such a
step is unnecessary, since the two
thirds majority now existing in the
Senate is in favor of United States
