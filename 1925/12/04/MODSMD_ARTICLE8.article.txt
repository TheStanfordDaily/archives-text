# SENATE URGED TO DECIDE ON U. S. ENTERING COURT
## Resolution Adopted by Big Majority at Assembly Hall Meeting 
### 
A resolution urging that the United
States take a definite stand in regard
to the World Court question was
passed almost unanimously at a meet
ing held last night in the Assembly
hall. The complete resolution read as
follows: "Whereas, we believe that
the United States should make up its
mind whether it desires to participate
in the World Court and thus join the
other nations of the world in an at
tempt to substitute law for war in the
settling of international disputes. Be
it resolved, that a meeting of the Palo
Alto-Stanford community urge that the
Senate of the United States proceed
to a record vote upon the question of
adherence to the World Court as soon
after December 17 as is compatible
with adequate debate."
Questions From Floor
Various questions were brought up
from the floor. Professor R. L. Green
presented a question asking the defini
tion of adequate debate. William L.
Gosslin suggested that the meeting go
on record as favoring entrance into
the World Court. Professor Victor J.
West of the Political Science depart
ment said that in his opinion such a
step is unnecessary, since the two
thirds majority now existing in the
Senate is in favor of United States
adherence, and the vote will probably
l)e a definite decision.
Judge Jackson H. Ralston of Palo
Alto was the first speaker. He advo
cated the entrance of America into
the World Court and explained the
practical workings and administration
of the Court. He believes tlmt the pres
ent system of electing members to
the World Court through the League
of Nations gets the best results. He
advocated that the United States look
upon the function of the League in re
gard to the selection of judges as be
ing merely an electoral body.
Crothers Speaks
Judge George E. Crothers of San
Francisco pointed out some of the dif
ficulties of the World Court which ap
pealed to him as a lawyer. He particu
larly emphasized the difficulty of de
cision in cases where international
prejudice formed one of the elements,
and mentioned the recent American
immigration law as a possible in
stance. Crothers advocated that we
use the World Court, but do not join
it.
Graham H. Â«Stuart of the Political
Science department spoke .on the ac
complishments of the League. He told
of two cases. involving Germany, a
power outside the Court. The first
case, a dispute between France and
England against Germany over the ad
mittance of a French vessel bearing
arms to Poland through the interna
tionalized Kiel Canal, was decided
against Germany. Germany had tried
to prevent arms being taken to war
ring countries through the canal. The
second case involved the rights of
German settlers in Finnish territory
and was decided favor of Germany.
Stuart favors American adherence to
the World Court.
John C. Duniway, varsity debater,
refuted Senator Borah's stand against
the World Court. Borah's unwilling
ness to compromise would entail either
the use of temporary measures of arbi
ration or the establishment of a
separate court of justice operating in
every way similarly to the present one
except that it would include the
United States. Duniway believes that
such an attempt would result in a*s
great a diplomatic humiliation as the
country has ever seen.
