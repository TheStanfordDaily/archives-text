# SOCCER TEAM WILL LOSE FIVE PLAYERS FROM 1925 LINEUP
## 
### 
Five seniors will t>e missing from the
soccer lineup next year, having played
three years of varsity soccer. Sclioen,
outside left; Miron, outside right;
Franklin, center halfback, and captain
this year; Dave Clark, left fullback; and
Quigley, inside left, arc those ineligible
for 1926 competition.
With plenty of reserve material and
several experienced freshmen these posi
tions will be filled with reliable players
and the varsity soccer team should be as
strong next season as it was this year.
Cy Farewell, who has developed into a
fast forward, is the logical candidate for
outside right, while Birch of the fresh
man squad, seems to be Schoen's suc
cessor at outside left.
Jack Franklin's place at center halt
will be hard to fill, but Lee Newland,
varsity substitute, can probably start nevt
fall in this key position. However, Gibbs
of the freshmen may beat him out on ac
count of his offensive work.
Since Bob Bailard will not play inside
right next year, Wade Strowger will be
shifted from center forward to inside
right, and Rivero may play center for
ward. Either Gilbert or Russell of this
year's freshman team will fill the inside
left position.
Members of the Olympic team said this
season that Miles Gray is the best college
goalkeeper that they have ever seen.
Gray has a competitor in Van Nuys, who
starred on the freshman squad this year.
The six men who will return next year
are Stollery, Holmes, Gray, Cannon,
Bushnell, and Strowger.
Nine men of the California soccer
eleven are juniors and arc expected to
play again next year. Captain Freer, half
back, and Burgess, center forward, are
the only Bruins which will be missing.
