# WEALTH OF GOOD MATERIAL PUZZLES COACH ANDY KERR
## VETS FIGHT FOR BERTHS Chief Problem Lies in Naming Best Combinationâ€”Guard Berth Unfilled 
### Jim Adams 
The chief worry of Andy Kerr in the
coaching of his basketball team this
year lies in the matter of selection for
he is finding it a difficult task to
choose from the numerous capable
candidates five men who can be called
a first team. To solve this problem is
the end to which his efforts have been
directed towards the various combina
tions he has tried out in scrimmage.
The present situation is much more
favorable than the one with which he
was confronted last year when he had
to find and develop a forward, a cen
ter, a guard, and capable reserves.
Probably the only position which calls
for the development of a player to
fill it is that of the standing guard
and for this job he has several promis
ing candidates.
Young Stands Out
In the race for this position Ralph
Young is conceded a slight edge over
Leo Harris and Biaggini. Young is
big, aggressive, and willing to learn.
Harris has the advantage of having
had more experience than the other
two, and is especially diligent at get
ting the ball off the backboard. Biag
gini, although light, played an excel
lent game at this position last year on
the freshman team.
If Gurdon Steele is used at standing
guard instead of center all three of
the above men will find the competi
tion stiffer than before. Jayred and
Anderson have been alternating at
center and Bryant has also been given
a chance at this job. Unless Steele is
used at center the two former players
will probably share honors here to
gether.
Price at Guard?
Whether Captain Fred Price has
cinched the running guard berth or
not cannot yet be said, but he has
been used there in most of the scrim
mages to date. Shipkey came out for
the first time Saturday. Mitchell has
been playing on the second string in
most of the lineups.

Nelson David apparently has the
most favorable chance of playing regu
larly at forward although Bill Clark
and Byron Bryant are trying hard for
the same opportunity. Ernie Nevers
will grab one of the forward berths
when he returns and gets into shape
because the big fellow is invaluable at
breaking through the defense with the
ball.
The same five-man defense will be
used by Kerr this year although he
bas been considering the man-for-man
defense which has become popular in
the Middlewest lately.
