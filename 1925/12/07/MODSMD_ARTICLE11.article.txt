Due to a readjustment of final scores in
the annual fall quarter intramural track
meet, first place was awarded to Delta
Upsilon instead of Encina Second, as was
announced Friday afternoon at tlie con
clusion of the competition. This change
was made on account of a runner from
Encina Fourth competing on the Encina
Second team.
Delta Upsilon totaled 19 1 / 2 points to
capture first honors. Encina Second took
second place with 17, Phi Delta Theta
was third with 14, Breakers fourth with
13, and Encina Third took fifth with 11
points. Sixteen clubs placed men in the
finals, held Friday afternoon on the old

first places in the high hurdles race and
the high jump. West was responsible for
ten of the Phi Delt's fourteen points!
Syer, star freshman sprinter, took sec
ond in the individual scoring with a first in
the 220-yard dash, and a second in the
century. Evans, Alpha Delta Phi, with a
first in the discus event, and a third in the
shotput, tied Wells, Sigma Alpha Epsilon,
for third place honors with six points.
Wells placed first in the 100-yard dash,
and third in the high hurdles.
Wells ran a fast race in the century to
capture first place from Syer. His time
for the event was 10 2-5 seconds. This
race was the best event of the day. Cov
