# WIN SLOW IS OUTSTANDING FIND AMONG 1928 ACTORS
## 
### C. H. P 
It is exceedingly difficult to produce
a mystery play with relatively few
flaws and rough edges. It is doubly
difficult to do this with a cast of
sophomores whose experience is com
paratively limited. If these two ele
ments are taken into consideration,
Saturday night's production may be
termed as very acceptable. Typical of
most plays of this calibre, "In the Next
Room" is possessed with certain tra
ditional stock "accessories" which the
authors of such plays always deem
necessary to their success, and which
are disadvantageous to an amateur
cast playing to a college audience In
the main, however, these situations
were handled smoothly, and the cast
did well under the handicap.
The first act, to be frank, was bad.
The tempo was slow, lines were shaky,
and there was a decided lack of
smoothness throughout. The actors
seemed to lack the confidence arc!
punch necessary to put the show over.
The second act, however, showed a
decided improvement which was sus
tained throughout the rest of the show,
coming to the high peak in the third
act, which, from all angles, was very
commendable.
Winslow in Dual Role
Easily the best performance of the
evening was that of Garth Winslow,
who played a very difficult dual role
admirably. His portrayal of Felix Ar

mand, the suave French impostor, was
delightful. Winslow displayed in a line
measure all the smoothness and
finesse so necessary to the part. His
accent was flawless, and his stage
presence extremely finished.
In the second act he became a no
torious criminal in the guise of a fam
ous detective, and this he did so ef
fectively that not until the identity of
the criminal was revealed did the
audience suspect that Colonel Piggot
and Armand were one and the same
man. Winslow commanded attention
and interest from his first entrance
until the final curtain, he stimulated
the action throughout the second and
third acts, and by his versatility and
talent added tremendously to the suc
cess of the performance. He will doubt
less be heard from in the near future.
Torjussen Good
Parks, the ever-proper English but
ler, was well played by Reidar Tor
jussen. Carrying most of the comedy
of the play, Torjussen displayed an
intelligent understanding of the part
by his good sense of humor combined
with a quite typical accent. He over
acter a bit at times, and seemed to
work a little harder than necessary,
but in general his performance was
very good.
Mac Lewis, playing the juvenile,
James Godfrey, the ever-alert news
paper reporter, proved that he has fu
ture possibilities, although he showed
a lack of experience and consistency.
Mac got off to a bad start in the first
act along with the rest of the cast, but
from this point he improved continu
ally, and, with Winslow, carried off
the third act in good style. Lewis at
tained great heights at times, and at
others he appeared very weak. He did,
however, prove that he can act, and
a little more experience will find him
greatly improved.
Rittler Shows Promise
Lida Rittler played a difficult and
rather colorless role very well. Like
Lewis, she was good, and not so good,
but she must be credited with poise
and ease, and by using these qualities,
she overcame the disadvantage of an
inadequate voice. Miss Rittler's peri
odical display of talent may be made
more consistent by training and ex
perience.
Lucie Bentley's performance is
worthy of commendation. She also had
a difficult role to fill, that of Madame
De Charriere, the lady whose unfor
tunate love affairs involved the mys
terious cabinet. Miss Bentley did ex
ceptionally well; she showed a thor
ough understanding of the part, dis
playing anxiety and misfortune with
a marked degree of talent. This type
of thing seems to suit her admirably;
her "Mrs, Dearth" in "Dear Brutus"
will be remembered as a parallel role.
Baylor Brooks as Philip Vantine, the
elderly uncle, was quite acceptable, al
though he lacked the proper maturity
both in voice and manner. He has a
pleasing way on the stage, however,
and was responsible for many laughs
in the comedy situations.
Minor Parts Well Handled
Cecil Doll blustered and ranted ef
fectively as Inspector Grady, the in
evitable hard-boiled detective, while
Frank Baker as his assistant wasn't
given a chance to show anything. Rog
ers, the footman, supposedly impli
cated in the plot, was played by Lee
Flood in an adequate style, while
Marian Farr worked well with him
as Julia, Madame's maid, later identi
fied as Rogers' wife. They both faint
badly, but that is hard to do well.
Dave Painter stood well by the win
dow as a policeman.
In connection with this play, it may
be said that Gordon Davis "came
through" exceedingly well. He had a
hard play to produce, an inexperienced
cast with which to work, and a short
time in which to round things into
shape. "In the Next Room" was
brought from what seemed a hopeless
proposition into a good show in the
short space of three days!
Chrysella Dunker and Leslie Kiler,
the never-failing-technical staff, are
deserving of much credit. The sets
were exceptionally effective, and the
mystery cabinet was practically per
fect. Few who saw the performance
knew that the cabinet was created by
Bob Keerl. Ray Baker, Chrysella Dun
ker, Les Kiler, and their assistants.
It was a very clever device, and one
of the most interesting features of the
performance.
