# WIN SLOW IS OUTSTANDING FIND AMONG 1928 ACTORS
## 
### C. H. P 
It is exceedingly difficult to produce
a mystery play with relatively few
flaws and rough edges. It is doubly
difficult to do this with a cast of
sophomores whose experience is com
paratively limited. If these two ele
ments are taken into consideration,
Saturday night's production may be
termed as very acceptable. Typical of
most plays of this calibre, "In the Next
Room" is possessed with certain tra
ditional stock "accessories" which the
authors of such plays always deem
necessary to their success, and which
are disadvantageous to an amateur
cast playing to a college audience In
the main, however, these situations
were handled smoothly, and the cast
did well under the handicap.
The first act, to be frank, was bad.
The tempo was slow, lines were shaky,
and there was a decided lack of
smoothness throughout. The actors
seemed to lack the confidence arc!
punch necessary to put the show over.
The second act, however, showed a
decided improvement which was sus
tained throughout the rest of the show,
coming to the high peak in the third
act, which, from all angles, was very
commendable.
Winslow in Dual Role
Easily the best performance of the
evening was that of Garth Winslow,
who played a very difficult dual role
admirably. His portrayal of Felix Ar

mand, the suave French impostor, was
delightful. Winslow displayed in a line
measure all the smoothness and
finesse so necessary to the part. His
accent was flawless, and his stage
presence extremely finished.
In the second act he became a no
torious criminal in the guise of a fam
ous detective, and this he did so ef
fectively that not until the identity of
the criminal was revealed did the
audience suspect that Colonel Piggot
and Armand were one and the same
man. Winslow commanded attention
and interest from his first entrance
until the final curtain, he stimulated
the action throughout the second and
third acts, and by his versatility and
talent added tremendously to the suc
cess of the performance. He will doubt
less be heard from in the near future.
Torjussen Good
Parks, the ever-proper English but
ler, was well played by Reidar Tor
jussen. Carrying most of the comedy
of the play, Torjussen displayed an
intelligent understanding of the part
by his good sense of humor combined
with a quite typical accent. He over
acter a bit at times, and seemed to
work a little harder than necessary,
but in general his performance was
very good.
Mac Lewis, playing the juvenile,
James Godfrey, the ever-alert news
paper reporter, proved that he has fu
