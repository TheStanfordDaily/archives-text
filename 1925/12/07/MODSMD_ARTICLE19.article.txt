# EX-STANFORD MEN PRACTICE RUGBY FOR CANADA TRIP
## OLYMPIC STARS PRESENT Dink Templeton in Form at Punting in Initial Practice at S. F. 
### 
Many Stanford and ex-Stanford
players were present at the workout
yesterday morning on Ewing field,
San Francisco, of the California All-
Star rugby team which will invade
Canada during the Christmas holi
days. Their coach, Harry "Maloney,
Stanford coach now on a year's leavo
of absence, was greatly pleased by the
show of talent which turned out.
Thirty-one candidates for positions
showed up at the initial practice.
The Stanford players who showed
up at the field yesterday were: Dink
Templeton, Mike Murphy, Morris
Kirksey, Phil Clark, "Swede" Anato
nell, Lynn Farish, Jack Patrick, Jim
Wylie, Charlie Grondona, Pete Arnott,
and Bill Classen. Norman Cleaveland,
Charlie Doe, and Dick Hyland, who
has not been out because of a sore leg,
will all be out next Sunday, according
to Maloney.
The men showed up in great form
in the Sunday scrimmage practice.
More strength was displayed, accord
ing to the coach, than was shown in
workouts for the Olympic contest this
fall. B. L. Stanley of Notre Dame looks
good as a newcomer.
Dink Templeton was kicking the
ball Sunday the length of the field â€”
the best distance he has achieved
since his undergraduate days.
Morris Kirksey, who went north
with the team last year and who was
a rival of Charlie Paddock in former
years and a member of the 1920 Olym
pic Games team, worked out with the
team.
Bradshaw of Nevada American foot
ball fame and of whom much is ex
pected, will work out next Sunday. A1
Williams, from Cornell University, i 3
making a good showing. Three men
from the University of California are
trying for the team. They are Jack
Moir, Bob Moir, and Tim Hananan.

The team will leave December 21 by
train direct for Vancouver and will be
back by January 4, after playing three
games with the strongest available
teams. Five members of the American
Olympic rugby team which won the
Olympic championship, will be on the
California team, so a good showing is
assured. They, all Stanford men, are:
Norm Cleaveland, Lynn Farish, Dick
Hyland, Charlie Doe, and Jack Patrick.
