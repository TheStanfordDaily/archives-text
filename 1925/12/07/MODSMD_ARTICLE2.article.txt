OREGON AGRICULTURAL COL
LEGE, Corvallis, Dec. 7. â€”When the
final gun of the Oregon Aggie-Trojan
game was fired Saturday, four Aggie
players bid farewell to the land of the
college gridiron. They will turn in
their uniforms and their feats of the
turf will pass into history, for these
four men will be lost to the team by
graduation. They are Snider, Grider,
"Bell, and Quinn.
Snider, a long, rangy blond fullback,
mado himself famous as one of the
coast's best punters this year. In one
of his last games he averaged 56 yards
and got away one punt for 100 yards
from the line of scrimmage. Besides
being a punter, Snider is an accurate
passer or receiver and a groat line
plunger.
Grider, a husky halfback, is a first-
Tate open field runner. This year he got
away with some long sensational runs
or 30, 40, and 50 yards. Grider is a
powerful man at backing up the line
and a hard-hitting tackier.
Hell, another fullback, has been on
the bench most, of this season due to
an injury received in the Stanford
game. He has fully recovered now and
was seen in action Saturday. Bell is
an open field runner and an accurate
pass receiver.
