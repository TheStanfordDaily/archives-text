# Too Much of a Good Thing
## 
### 
The passing of Walter Camp has taken away the epilogue of the foot
ball seasonâ€”the selection of "THE" All-American team by the innovator
and cultivator of American football. Camp honestly endeavored to keep
himself free from favoritism and sectionalism by traveling as far as hu
manly possible during each season, and by corresponding with officials and
coaches in various parts of the nation.
However, his ability to satisfy the majority rested to a considerable
degree on the sentiment attached to him as a man who loved clean sport,
and one of the builders of a game which has taken the limelight in the
sporting field of America.
This year the supply of All-American teams is far in excess of the de
mand. Camp in his will did not name a successor whose selections were
to be accepted by sportdom, and as a result dozens of elevens are being
named every clay by people who believe themselves capable. These elevens
are no doubt prepared with as much care as the squad selected by Camp,
but they leave readers in doubt. In time perhaps some selector will gain
sufficient prestige to impress the authenticity of his eleven. We are anx
iously awaiting this day.
To be chosen on an All-American as universally popular as Camp's
was a goal for college grid stars. And then the American people get an
appreciable amount of pleasure from hero-worshipping. But, now we can
find someone ready to name practically any player suggested on an All-
American.
It is just too much.
