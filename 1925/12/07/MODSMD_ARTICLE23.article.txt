# The 						Wrong Way of Winning
## 
### 
Intramural athletics at Stanford were started to give men, not profic
ient enough to compete on intercollegiate teams, a chance to obtain healthy,
wholesome recreation through clean athletic competition. The idea is a
sound one, but an incident occurred in the recent intramural meet which
showed that all the students do not realize the significance of the plan.
And worse yet the honor system was violated at the same time.
In checking over the eligibility of the men competing, Charles W.
Davis, director of living group competitoin, discovered that a man living
on the fourth floor had competed with the second floor squad. The points
he scored were sufficient to give the second floor team first place in the
meet. After the rechecking, the points were taken away and another liv
ing group was declared the winner.
If the honor system was strictly adhered to it would not be necessary
for the director to check over the eligibility of the competitors. Such a
trick as the one referred to does not conform with the standard of sports
manship which it was hoped would be attained in the living group contests.
,The Daily joins Mr. Davis in urging that intramural competitors be honest
with themselves and the other competitors in the future.
