The sophomores have announced that they cleared approximately $250
on the Cotillion Friday evening. They have also decided that this money
will be used to defray the expenses incurred by them during the so-called
"Encina Raid" early in the quarter, in which certain damage was done to
the freshman dormitory.
Although the Daily Palo Alto never felt that the sophomores were
absolutely bound to pay for this damage, which was not altogether due to
their fault, it is pleased at the way things have turned out. The class man
agers did exceptionally well in clearing so much on the Cotillion after early
reports had it that the dance was going to l>e a financial failure.
And, now that the money is in the class treasury, it is a fine thing that
the 1928 officers will be able to turn it over to the University to pay for the
damage to the hall and so get themselves out of a nasty hole.
