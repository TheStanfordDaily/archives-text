The annual sale of Christmas cards, seals, and tags for the benefit of j
the children of the Stanford Convalescent Home is being held on the
campus this week. This is more than the usual charity enterprise—it is a
Stanford project, and as such is deserving of attention in the Stanford
family.
The proceeds from the sale last year totaled $200. The sale total this
year should be double that amount, for the need each year is more urgent.
You'll buy Christmas cards anyhow; so when you buy them make our
Stanford Convalescent Home children happy.
