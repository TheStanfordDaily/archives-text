ORIGIN OF CLAM CHOWDER
A gentle elara gazed on a sandy shore
And wished that he were wise and
knew much more.
A wise old crab came ambling down
the beach.
His mind every obscure problem could
reach.
"Oh! Mr. Crab," said the Clam,
"please tell to me
How I as wise as Socrates may be."
"The surest way I know," said Mr.
Crab,
"Is spend your every hour in the Lab.
"But if you do not think that very
nice,
"I'll then advise you: Go, get served
on ice."
The gentle clam took this advice to
heart
And made all preparations for the
start,
But what befell the honest creature
there,
I will not tell, unless I'm asked —that's
fair. / A.A. —H. K.

WOMEN
Women who write nasty viewpoints—
Women who borrow things and never
return them—
Women who say "Isn't the moon ro
mantic?" —
Women who tell about their heavy
dates—
Women who always agree with you—
Women who never agree with you—
Women who believe in love at first
sight—
Women in general— F. E. H.

Cautious Comments of Observant
Frosh
Ima Slow-one told me that Stanford
men tote torrid mamas because the
evenings on the campus are so chilly.
If seeing is believing, some upper
classmen scour the country with a
thermometer to find eligible dates.

An innocent young feminine fresh
man wants to know if water containing
alcohol is hard water.

"Since a super-saturated solution is
one which contains more than it ought
to," said this same fair frosh, "can
you say that a man containing too
much is super-saturated?"
