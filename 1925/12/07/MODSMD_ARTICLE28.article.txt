# CAMPUS OPINION

The Editor, Sir:
When a man fails to do his job he
is fired and someone else takes his
place. When an existing government
fails to enforce its laws, someone
comes along, upsets the govprnment,
and usually makes new laws. The laws
that are enforced as the laws thaL
«ire observed. This seems to apply in
the case of freshmen passing judg
ment on Stanford traditions. Upper
class discipline was not enforced and
the freshmen saw that they could do
almost whatever they chose to do, and
being conservative-minded, they de
cided to examine the old traditions
for merits and defects, and reason for
themselves, rather than try to strike
out entirely "on their own." They de
eded that certain traditions wero use
less, and so should not be observed.
In their inexperience, they failsd to
see the thirty years behind the tradi
tions.
"Traditions which apply to fresh
men only," the freshmen said wh.^n

they started out, and they kept to it. \
They did not presume to judge of the
merit of the law steps tradition, not
because it did not interest them, but j
because they drew a line between
questions which in the main affected
them only, and those which concern
the entire University. Instead of hark
ing back thirty years to the "good
old days," they reasoned things out
logically, and the result was not {avor
able for the old traditions. Which is
hotter, logic or acceptance of tradi
tion just because it is tradition?
And furthermore, the freshmen are
at least interested in the University
—keenly interested. That is a lot mon
than I can say for sojne freshman
r'acseß, and not too many years ago,
either.

The Editor, Sir:
Some weeks ago a very able letter
to your paper criticized, from a logi
cal point of view, the reasoning which
the Daily Palo Alto has used in its
persistent and continuous propaganda
for the re-establishment of sophomore
discipline. If I may add anything to
this it is only to point out that the
conceptions of tradition and of en
forcement are essentially opposed to
one another. A tradition is a custom
which is followed because of love of
the institution to which it relates.
Coupled with the idea of enforcement
it becomes a fixed rule, a matter of
law.
Furthermore, may I call your atten
tion to what seems to me to be a
fundamental inconsistency in the edi
torial policy of your paper? The Daily
Palo Alto, which has been campaign
ing for the sarredness of such tradi
tions as the "dink" and the match
carrying habit, did not hesitate to
publish the "Cardinal Creed" —a thing
which must of necessity have profaned
the most sacred traditions of a large
portion of the Stanford community.
Likewise, the Daliy Palo Alto, in one
edition last week, urged the resora
tion of sophomore discipline, and in
the next congratulated the students of
Yale University on their revolt against
compulsory chapel, saying that the
compulsion robbed the services of the
element of sacredness. The argument
against the restoration of sophomore
discipline could hardly be more force
fully put than it was in the editorial
on compulsory chapel.
If.we are to pass on to future gener
ations a heritage of traditions which
they, too, will regard as priceless, then
Stanford's traditions must be, not
those of an army camp or of a nrisnn,
but free and loyal—worthy of the fin
est of universities.
Very truly yours,
John C. Duniway.

The sorority rushing period at U. C
S. B. has been reduced to one week.
