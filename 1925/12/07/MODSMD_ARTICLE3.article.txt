# Fire Department On Spot to Save Smoking Furnace
## 
### 
A furnace fire beyond control was
the cause of an alarm turned in from
Manzanlta hall about 9 o'clock Friday
night. The fire department responded
immediately and extinguished the
blaze before any damage was done.
Oil from the burner of the furnace
had escaped and ignited, and the
dense smoke gave the appearance of a
serious conflagration. A rumor to the
effect that residents of the hall were
so surprised at seeing the furnace
going that they turned in a fire-alarm
has not been substantiated.
