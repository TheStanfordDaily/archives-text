# Fire Chief Issues Warning Against Christmas Candles
## 
### 
Warning against the use of lighted
candles on Christmas trees and decorations
has been issued by Fire Marshal R. E.
Dugan, who declares that candles are the
greatest fire menace of Christmas time
both to property and to life. During
Christmas week there are twenty-five to
seventy-five per cent more fires than
usual, due entirely to the use of candles,
says Dugan.
Electric lights should be used on the
tree if illumination is desired and if
candles are used Christmas trees should
be kept away from window curtains and
draperies.
