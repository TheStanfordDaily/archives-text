# ATHLETES NEED HIGH MENTALITY, SAYS DEAN
## 
### 
Mental ability must accompany phy
sical prowess, according to Dean Frank
H. Probert of the College of Mining at
the University of California, who
points out that members of the "Big
C" honor society who are chosen for
membership in the organization for
their feats on the athletic field are
everyone of them students with high
scholastic standings.
The California professor declares
that an athlete is seldom successful if
a mental dullard. Football men, espe
cially, can not hope to make their
mark without a quick, alert and highly
trained mind. Failure in studies puts
men out of the game in no time, he
said.
"Football men are forced to carry
strenuous schedules," pointed out
Dean Probert. "They go through dif
ficult practice on the field in the early
afternoon and evening, eat at training
quarters and after dinner have skull
practice until 8:30. This leaves them
an hour to study, as they have to be
in bed by half past ten.

"Absence for an out-of-town game
means missing chances and they come
home tired and sometimes bruised.
Yet, in spite of it all, they work with
more pep than ever."
