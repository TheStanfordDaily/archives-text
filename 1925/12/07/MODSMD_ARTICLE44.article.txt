# Low Scholarship Excuses Due Before December 11
## 
### 
Excuses for special consideration on
reports should be submitted as soon
as possible to Mrs. Huston, Secretary
of Committee on Scholarship. She will
be at the Registrar's Office any morn
ing between 9 and 12 o'clock.
Students who have been ill during
the present quarter or who have been
otherwise interrupted in their work,
and who fear that their records may
be such as to cause some scholarship
action, should report these circum
stances. Excuses submitted later than
December 11 cannot be assured of
consideration before action is taken
on end-quarter reports. Requests for
allowance on the ground of illness
must be accompanied by the special
physician's certificate furnished by the
committee.
