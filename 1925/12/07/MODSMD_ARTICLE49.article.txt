# CAMPUS OPINION

### 
The Editor, Sir:
Having read with disgust the last of
your series of editorial outbursts of
assininity regarding freshman conduct
and the sponsor system, I am forced
as a believer in fair play to contribute
to a column that has become almost as
comical and grotesque in its display
of logic and common sense as your
editorial column —namely, the view
point column.
Because of a limitation on the length
of articles, I will have to deal with
three closely related topics in three
separate articles —the Sponsor Sys
tem, Freshman Discipline or Sopho
more Control, and Traditions.
At the outset, Mr. Editor, I feel it
my duty to tell you that in regard to
the sponsor system you have either
maliciously and intentially misstated
the facts in several of your editorials,
or have been peacefully, blissfully, and
totally ignorant of what the facts were.
Apparently your policy (if one could
call it such), has been to blame every
thing that has gone wrong (including
the burning of the bonfire) upon the
sponsor system or the lack of sopho
more control. Far be it from me to
attempt to convince you or your small
body of supporters in this matter of
whether the sponsor system has been
a success or not. I merely write to en
lighten those who have been held to
believe that the sentiments expressed
in th editorial column of the D. P. A.
were characteristic of thinking Stan
ford men, alumni, or faculty.
For your information: (1) The spon
sors have nothing to do with the teach
ing or enforcing of "traditions." The
only work done in this line has been
done by individuals and not in their
capacity as sponsors. (2) The spon
sors are not a disciplinary body and
do not exercise such powers except in
emergency cases. (3) The freshmen
are organized with their own officers,
house committee, and social commit
tees. (4) The sponsors act only in an
advisory capacity. (5) The sponsors
are appointed by the President from a
list of men recommended by the Dean
of Men. (G) The sponsor system did
not supplant sophomore discipline—
that was abolished. The sponsor sys
tem has entirely different aims, ideals,
and purposes, and different methods
of accomplishing them. (7) These aims
and how fully they were accomplished
will be dealt with in the article on
"Freshman Discipline or Sophomore
Control." Yours for enlightenment,
J. C. Irwin, Head Sponsor.
