### 
An article by Dean Willard E. I-lotch
kiss of the Stanford Graduate School
of Business has been published in the'
December number of "Commercia," j
the monthly magazine of the Com-1
merce Association of the University i
of California. The article describes the j
organization and aims of the new i
graduate school.
Until recently, the Harvard Gradu
ate School of Business has been the j
only institution of this character in 1
the United States. The authorities of
Stanford decided several years ago'
that there was a pressing need for a
similar school on the Pacific Coast.}
There are a great many business prob-!
lems peculiar to the Pacific Coast and !
which yet have a hearing on national
and world-wide industrial and labor i
problems, according to Hotclikiss.
To meet the need, Stanford estab- j
lished a business school last October, j
The purpose of the school is to super- i
vise study of the various phases and ;
problems of modern business. The
school seeks to develop an understand- j
ing of detail work, but at the same 1
time to develop efficient executives
capable of organizing and directing
work. To fulfill this purpose, each stu
dent in the school must do work with
a chosen business concern which is
satisfactory to the concern and the
school before he may get his degree.
The Harvard Graduate Business
School, on which the Stanford School
is patterned, was organized in 1908.
A number of prominent business men
were placed on the staff to give the
students the benefit of their practical
experience.
Various boards of business research
have greatly facilitated work in the
schools of business. Among the most
! important of these are the co-oper
! ative studies of certain industries and
j their functions by the Bureau of Busi
ness Research at Northwestern Uni
' versity and the industrial management
| research that Professor Willits is now
j conducting in Philadelphia.
