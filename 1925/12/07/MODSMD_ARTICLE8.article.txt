Ernie Nevers was named fullback !
I on the All-American football team ;
j and Ted Shipkey was chosen as end
|on the second team which were se-'
lected by Pop Warner, Knute Rockne, j
and Tad Jones. Their three teams
were announced yesterday in a Christy
, Walsh Syndicate article published by
| the San Francisco Examiner.
Other Pacific Coast players honored
, were George Wilson, of the University !
; of Washington, right halfback on the
I first team; Dana Carey, of the Univer-;
! sity of California, left guard on the
second team; Cravath, of U. S. C., cen-
J ter on the third team; Drury, U. S. C., !
I quarterback on the third team; Tes-!
j reau, of the University of Washington, !
j fullback on the third team,
j In naming Nevers, the three coaches 1
! declared, "Two members of this board
: have seen Nevers of Stanford Univer- j
j sity at his best and along with numer- ■
I ous old-time observers agree that
! Nevers is one of the greatest fullbacks
| in the history of American football. In 1
j many respects he surpasses Thorpe
| of Carlisle Indian fame. Nevers is a
i powerful line-plunger of the old school
type and yet in an open field he has ;
few superiors. This western back is i
on 6 of the best punters and forward
j passers of a generation and his work J
;on defense and in interference was
j a great factor in Stanford's victory
' over California —the first under Arneri
! can football rules in twenty years.
"During 1924 Nevers had bad an
kles and was of little value until the
New Year's game at Pasadena when
his massive shoulders, powerful legs, 1
! and super-driving power, bucked Notre
] Dame from midfield to the one-yard !
line —almost singlehanded-. This year,
his ankles mended, Nevers was much
the same stalwart who all but stam- J
j peded the famous 'Four Horsemen'." j
