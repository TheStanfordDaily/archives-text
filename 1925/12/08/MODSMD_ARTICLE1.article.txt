# NEVERS RESUMES WORK WITH CARD BASKETBALL TEAM
## Andy Kerr Has Four Capable Forwards Available for Varsity Squad 
### 
Ernie Nevers returned yesterday to
"begin practice with the basketball
team and engaged in a light scrim
mage. Immediately on his entry into
the game he proceeded to demonstrate
that he hasn't forgotten a thing about
the court game. He shot baskets from
all distances and all angles and in
fact showed more accuracy in his shot
than has been displayed by any of the
forwards so far.
Because of his ability to break
through the opponents' defense, Nev
ers will probably start in the first
game of the season with the San Jose
State Teachers College which is sche
duled for December 12. If Nevers con
tinues his brilliant shooting it will
probably leave only one forward berth
to fill.
Nevers' return gives Coach Andy
Kerr four capable forwards to depend
"upon. For forwards Kerr can use
David, Clark, and Bryant Nelson
David apparently has the most favor
able chance of playing regularly at
forward opposite Nevers.
