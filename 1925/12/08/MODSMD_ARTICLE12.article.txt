# TOUWAIDE SPEAKS TO COSMOPOLITAN CLUB ON BELGIUM

"Unlike American universities with
their systems of frequent examina
tions, Belgian universities have only
one examination throughout the year,"
said Marcel E. Touwaide, who spoke
before the Cosmopolitan Club which
met last night at the Chinese Club
house. As a result of the Belgian sys
tem students there do not study in
tensively until after Easter vacation
since examinations are not given until
July, according to Touwaide.
If a student who takes the examina
tion in July fails in one course he may
take a second examination in October,
but if he fails then, he is required to
repeat all his other courses.
Since students are not required to
attend lectures, the popularity of the
instructors may be determined by the
number of students who attend their
classes. There are no optional courses,
all who are working for a degree in
a particular field must follow the pro
gram as outlined by the university.
Since a Belgian university does not
have a campus, there is little social
life such as is found in America. Stu
dents of Belgium are interested in
politics. Their papers are usually pub
lished by student political factions.
Following his talk, Touwaide sang a
few Belgian songs. Carols were sung
by six members of the Schubert Club.
