# FIRST MOVE MADE IN CORRESPONDENCE MATCH IS PUZZLER
## 
### 
Officers of the Cardinal Chess Club
for the winter quarter were elected at
the meeting held last night at the
Y. M. C. A. The outgoing president,
Herbert F. Smith, thanked the club
for its co-operation during the quarter.
Officers elected were: president, Adin
D. Henderson; vice-president, John A.
Letter; secretary, William H. Jacobs;
treasurer, Herbert F. Smith; manager,
Marion M. Kornfeld (re-elected).
An article in the Oklahoma daily
paper takes note of the initial move
made by the Cardinal Chess Club in
their correspondence match with the
University Chess Club of Oklahoma.
The article states that the move has
thrown the club into a quandary, as
no chess authorities consulted have
had any mention of such an opening
move. The move was made by the
Cardinal club at the suggestion of Her
bert F. Smith, outgoing president of
the club. Marcel E. Touwaide and
Joseph D. H. Donnay, from Belgium,
were elected to membership in the
club. It was announced that the Y. M.
C. A. will be the future meeting place
of the club. Next quarter, all persons
who are interested in chess will be
invited to attend the regular weekly
meetings which are held Monday
night.
