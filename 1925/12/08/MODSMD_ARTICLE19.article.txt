# ALLEN WILL PLAY CHRISTMAS MUSIC IN ORGAN RECITAL
## Work of Several Composers Will Be Presented on Thursday Program 
### 
Christmas music will occupy a
prominent place on the program of
Warren D. Allen's organ recital Thurs
day afternoon at 4:15 o'clock in the
Memorial Church. The first number
will be "Offertory on Two Christmas
Themes" by Alexander Guilmant (1837-
1911). Guilmant's influence as a com
poser and performer was far-reaching.
He composed a large number of organ
works Including seven sonatas.
Two Chorale-Preludes on the hymn
"In Dulci Jubilo" are by J. S. Bach.
The first movement is Andantino in
the form of a cradle song; the second
is the more vigorous Maestoso form
with full organ. Bach took the simple
hymns of the Protestant Church, of
which he was a devout member, and
in his Chorale-Preludes made them
into powerful and contrasting expres
sions of mystical religious faith.
"Christmas Song" by E. H. Lemare
follows. Charles Marie Widor, the ven
erable organist of St. Sulpice, France,
is represented by the "Scherzo" from
his Fourth Symphony. Widor is now in
his eightieth year. He has written ten
organ symphonies.
The concert will close with a "Fan
tasia on Old Christmas Carols" by W.
T Best. This composition makes use
of the themes of the old familiar
Christmas Carols combined with sym
phonic variations upon them.
Next Sunday, Elizabeth Pierce, vio
linist; Jan Kalas, 'cellist, and Miss M.
K. Haslett will be soloists at Allen's
afternoon recital. Compositions for
organ, harp, and 'cello will be played.
