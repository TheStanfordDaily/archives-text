# NEW CONTROL FOR MYSTERIOUS DISEASE IS FOUND AT DAVIS
## 
### 
After several years of study and ex
perimentation, L. O. Bonnet, of the
Division of Viticulture at Davis, an
| nounces that he has found a very eco
i nomical and efficient means of control
! for black measles. This disease also
1 known as Spanish measles, and black
mildew, has up to last year been a
j very mysterious disease, due to the
peculiar appearance of its symptoms
i or their non-appearance in a series of
! years. Sometimes the whole vine is
j affected and may die, while in other
I cases only a branch, an arm, or even
i a shoot may be diseased. This varia
bility of the intensity of the attack is
the result of the activity of the or
j ganism causing the disease.
Spraying experiments carried out in
one diseased vineyard in 1924 gave
a 100 per cent control of the disease.
This year, several experimental plots,
• in various regions of California, have
all given a 100 per cent cure. In one
j vineyard, marked vines, affected with
the disease for two successive years,
I have been perfectly cured by one
I spraying. From these results it ap
pears that the spraying formula used
is the most efficient spray of all those
used to the present time in the control
j of fungi and peats.
Plans to publish the results of the
j experiments are under way and every
j effort is being made to give the meth
od of treatment in time for the pro
jection of next year's crop.
