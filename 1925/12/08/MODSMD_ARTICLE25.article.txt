J. C. Irwin, erstwhile middleweight boxing champion, actor, and up
holder of the sponsor system as conceived by his brother, has contributed
three letters to the Campus Opinion department during the past two days.
He claims that this column "has become almost as comical and grotesque
in its display of logic and common sense as the editorial columns" and
admits that it is his sense of fair play that forces him to contribute a
scathing and uncalled-for attack. He signs himself "head sponsor" but
writes purely upon his own initiative.
He is aggrieved because anyone has dared to suggest that the sponsor
system is not flawless, and that Stanford might be a better place if tradi
tion enforcement and freshman discipline were used as means to secure
a better University spirit. Although he attempts to tear to pieces all of
the fruits of the discussion conducted in the Daily for the past two months
he neglects entirely to present anything constructive and his only sugges
tion is one of laisse-faire, allowing things to remain exactly as they are—
which to the majority of the students is almost unbearable.
The Daily Palo Alto has aroused general interest upon this subject
in the hope that from the discussions some definite project would crystal
lize. Irwin's bombshell has accelerated matters greatly, and we now feel
it necessary to point out where he is wrong and illogical, and then let the
case rest, since the Daily discontinues publication tomorrow until next
quarter.
Irwin accuses the Daily Palo Alto of malicious and intentional mis
statement of facts, which words are libel in themselves, but fails to name
specific instances. Perhaps as he says we have traced the burning of the
bonfire to the sponsor system, and we are ready to prove at any time that
the sponsor system is a proximate cause in the chain of causation resulting
in the burning.
Considering first the sponsor system. According to Irwin, the spon
sors have nothing to do with teaching "traditions"; they are not a discip
linary body; they have not supplanted sophomore discipline; they are
merely advisors to improve scholarship and athletics, and are developers
of initiative and individuality. As inducements for upperclassmen to live
in Encina, they are given free rooms, and in the case of the fraternity men
residing there, an opportunity to line up prospective rushees.
Although the sponsors are appointed by the Dean of Men little effort
is being made to secure the outstanding leaders on the campus—the men
who have interest in the system and who will work to see that its aims,
vague as some of them may be, are advanced. Instead of this, every liv
ing group is represented as nearly as possible, with the result that some
almost unheard of upperclassmen receive appointments, purely because
their groups must have a delegate to the rushing center.
Where several hundred freshmen live together, it is desirable that some
older men live with them, so that they can assist the inexperienced students
in learning of the ways of the campus. Hence, some sort of sponsor sys
tem is necessary. But, clearly, that in vogue today is inadequate. Many
of the sponsors admit that they do not know what they are to do, other
than to have a desk and a bed in the hall. How many of the sponsors
spend any time encouraging the freshmen to develop initiative and leader
ship? or show them how to study? As far as we can see whatever contact
there is between sponsors and freshmen other than at meetings is in the
nature of "bull" sessions, which break up study instead of helping it.
Irwin says the scholarship of the freshman class has improved since
the installing of the sponsor system and the abolition of sophomore discip
line. It would have increased even under the old regime, because the
scholarship of the University as a whole has been improving regularly for
a number of years. Competition is continually becoming keener to get
into the University and those who succeed in securing admittance are
bound to be better students than those who entered the year before.
As for athletic supremacy, the success of freshmen teams is not due
so much to the sponsor system as it is to the fact that Stanford is securing
better athletes now than it was five years ago. The installation of the
Warner system, with the stability and publicity that it gives to Stanford
athletics, has seen to that.
Irwin's third advantage is that the sponsor system is developing leaders
among the freshmen. If a man has the stuff in him he is going to develop j
anyway, even in spite of sponsors, so we fail to see logic in this point as j
put forward by Irwin.
It doesn't take an octogenerian to see that something is wrong with
present conditions. We feel the sponsor system could be modified to ad
vantage. Although the Daily has hinted at the advantages of sophomore
control of freshmen, it has never advocated a return of indiscriminate
hazing. No one believes that that is a good thing. By sophomore control,!
we have meant the adoption of some measures by means of which willing i
freshmen could be put on the right track by suggestion, and unwilling ones j
could be made to do the right thing by means of coercion. It is immaterial j
to us whether such control is adopted by sponsors or sophomores—the re- 1
suit would be the same.
It makes little difference where our traditions come from. Few people 1

know the exact origination of the dogmas in which they l>elieve, but as
long as they are satisfying, it is of little moment who started them or why.
If the sponsors or the sophomores, as you like it, were given police control
over freshmen to carry out the work of training them and encouraging
them they could first secure upperclass opinion as to what traditions were
worth while and what ones were not. The board of control, let us call it,
could then discard the bad ones and use the power in their hands to see
that the other traditions were lived up to.
Perhaps it makes no difference to the world ten years hence whether
you "queened" on the Quad or not, but to the one who went through a
period of suppression only to have this privilege later it makes a lot of
difference after he has graduated. He feels something stronger in his
heart for his Alma Mater—lt is hard to explain, but there is a difference.
And now we suggest that the campus take Irwin's comments for what
they are worth, and then direct its thoughts along the lines pointed out
now —is it possible to have some kind of control over freshmen so that
they can be put on the boat by instruction where possible and by coercion
where that is not possible? Can the advantages of the sponsor system be
combined with the best parts of upperclass discipline with indiscriminate
hazing eliminated? If so it might be a way out.

sors have nothing to do with teaching "traditions"; they are not a discip
linary body; they have not supplanted sophomore discipline; they are
merely advisors to improve scholarship and athletics, and are developers
of initiative and individuality. As inducements for upperclassmen to live
in Encina, they are given free rooms, and in the case of the fraternity men
residing there, an opportunity to line up prospective rushees.
Although the sponsors are appointed by the Dean of Men little effort
is being made to secure the outstanding leaders on the campus—the men
who have interest in the system and who will work to see that its aims,
vague as some of them may be, are advanced. Instead of this, every liv
ing group is represented as nearly as possible, with the result that some
almost unheard of upperclassmen receive appointments, purely because
their groups must have a delegate to the rushing center.
Where several hundred freshmen live together, it is desirable that some
older men live with them, so that they can assist the inexperienced students
in learning of the ways of the campus. Hence, some sort of sponsor sys
tem is necessary. But, clearly, that in vogue today is inadequate. Many
of the sponsors admit that they do not know what they are to do, other
than to have a desk and a bed in the hall. How many of the sponsors
spend any time encouraging the freshmen to develop initiative and leader
ship? or show them how to study? As far as we can see whatever contact
there is between sponsors and freshmen other than at meetings is in the
nature of "bull" sessions, which break up study instead of helping it.
Irwin says the scholarship of the freshman class has improved since
the installing of the sponsor system and the abolition of sophomore discip
line. It would have increased even under the old regime, because the
scholarship of the University as a whole has been improving regularly for
a number of years. Competition is continually becoming keener to get
into the University and those who succeed in securing admittance are
bound to be better students than those who entered the year before.
As for athletic supremacy, the success of freshmen teams is not due
so much to the sponsor system as it is to the fact that Stanford is securing
better athletes now than it was five years ago. The installation of the
Warner system, with the stability and publicity that it gives to Stanford
athletics, has seen to that.
Irwin's third advantage is that the sponsor system is developing leaders
among the freshmen. If a man has the stuff in him he is going to develop j
anyway, even in spite of sponsors, so we fail to see logic in this point as j
put forward by Irwin.
It doesn't take an octogenerian to see that something is wrong with
present conditions. We feel the sponsor system could be modified to ad
vantage. Although the Daily has hinted at the advantages of sophomore
control of freshmen, it has never advocated a return of indiscriminate
hazing. No one believes that that is a good thing. By sophomore control,!
we have meant the adoption of some measures by means of which willing i
freshmen could be put on the right track by suggestion, and unwilling ones j
could be made to do the right thing by means of coercion. It is immaterial j
to us whether such control is adopted by sponsors or sophomores—the re- 1
suit would be the same.
It makes little difference where our traditions come from. Few people 1

know the exact origination of the dogmas in which they l>elieve, but as
long as they are satisfying, it is of little moment who started them or why.
If the sponsors or the sophomores, as you like it, were given police control
over freshmen to carry out the work of training them and encouraging
them they could first secure upperclass opinion as to what traditions were
worth while and what ones were not. The board of control, let us call it,
could then discard the bad ones and use the power in their hands to see
that the other traditions were lived up to.
Perhaps it makes no difference to the world ten years hence whether
you "queened" on the Quad or not, but to the one who went through a
period of suppression only to have this privilege later it makes a lot of
difference after he has graduated. He feels something stronger in his
heart for his Alma Mater—lt is hard to explain, but there is a difference.
And now we suggest that the campus take Irwin's comments for what
they are worth, and then direct its thoughts along the lines pointed out
now —is it possible to have some kind of control over freshmen so that
they can be put on the boat by instruction where possible and by coercion
where that is not possible? Can the advantages of the sponsor system be
combined with the best parts of upperclass discipline with indiscriminate
hazing eliminated? If so it might be a way out.
J. C. Irwin, erstwhile middleweight boxing champion, actor, and up
holder of the sponsor system as conceived by his brother, has contributed
three letters to the Campus Opinion department during the past two days.
He claims that this column "has become almost as comical and grotesque
in its display of logic and common sense as the editorial columns" and
admits that it is his sense of fair play that forces him to contribute a
scathing and uncalled-for attack. He signs himself "head sponsor" but
writes purely upon his own initiative.
He is aggrieved because anyone has dared to suggest that the sponsor
system is not flawless, and that Stanford might be a better place if tradi
tion enforcement and freshman discipline were used as means to secure
a better University spirit. Although he attempts to tear to pieces all of
the fruits of the discussion conducted in the Daily for the past two months
he neglects entirely to present anything constructive and his only sugges
tion is one of laisse-faire, allowing things to remain exactly as they are—
which to the majority of the students is almost unbearable.
The Daily Palo Alto has aroused general interest upon this subject
in the hope that from the discussions some definite project would crystal
lize. Irwin's bombshell has accelerated matters greatly, and we now feel
it necessary to point out where he is wrong and illogical, and then let the
case rest, since the Daily discontinues publication tomorrow until next
quarter.
Irwin accuses the Daily Palo Alto of malicious and intentional mis
statement of facts, which words are libel in themselves, but fails to name
specific instances. Perhaps as he says we have traced the burning of the
bonfire to the sponsor system, and we are ready to prove at any time that
the sponsor system is a proximate cause in the chain of causation resulting
in the burning.

a number of years. Competition is continually becoming keener to get
into the University and those who succeed in securing admittance are
bound to be better students than those who entered the year before.
As for athletic supremacy, the success of freshmen teams is not due
so much to the sponsor system as it is to the fact that Stanford is securing
better athletes now than it was five years ago. The installation of the
Warner system, with the stability and publicity that it gives to Stanford
athletics, has seen to that.
Irwin's third advantage is that the sponsor system is developing leaders
among the freshmen. If a man has the stuff in him he is going to develop j
anyway, even in spite of sponsors, so we fail to see logic in this point as j
put forward by Irwin.
It doesn't take an octogenerian to see that something is wrong with
present conditions. We feel the sponsor system could be modified to ad
vantage. Although the Daily has hinted at the advantages of sophomore
control of freshmen, it has never advocated a return of indiscriminate
hazing. No one believes that that is a good thing. By sophomore control,!
we have meant the adoption of some measures by means of which willing i
freshmen could be put on the right track by suggestion, and unwilling ones j
could be made to do the right thing by means of coercion. It is immaterial j
to us whether such control is adopted by sponsors or sophomores—the re- 1
suit would be the same.
It makes little difference where our traditions come from. Few people 1

know the exact origination of the dogmas in which they l>elieve, but as
long as they are satisfying, it is of little moment who started them or why.
If the sponsors or the sophomores, as you like it, were given police control
over freshmen to carry out the work of training them and encouraging
them they could first secure upperclass opinion as to what traditions were
worth while and what ones were not. The board of control, let us call it,
could then discard the bad ones and use the power in their hands to see
that the other traditions were lived up to.
Perhaps it makes no difference to the world ten years hence whether
you "queened" on the Quad or not, but to the one who went through a
period of suppression only to have this privilege later it makes a lot of
difference after he has graduated. He feels something stronger in his
heart for his Alma Mater—lt is hard to explain, but there is a difference.
And now we suggest that the campus take Irwin's comments for what
they are worth, and then direct its thoughts along the lines pointed out
now —is it possible to have some kind of control over freshmen so that
they can be put on the boat by instruction where possible and by coercion
where that is not possible? Can the advantages of the sponsor system be
combined with the best parts of upperclass discipline with indiscriminate
hazing eliminated? If so it might be a way out.
J. C. Irwin, erstwhile middleweight boxing champion, actor, and up
holder of the sponsor system as conceived by his brother, has contributed
three letters to the Campus Opinion department during the past two days.
He claims that this column "has become almost as comical and grotesque
in its display of logic and common sense as the editorial columns" and
admits that it is his sense of fair play that forces him to contribute a
scathing and uncalled-for attack. He signs himself "head sponsor" but
writes purely upon his own initiative.
He is aggrieved because anyone has dared to suggest that the sponsor
system is not flawless, and that Stanford might be a better place if tradi
tion enforcement and freshman discipline were used as means to secure
a better University spirit. Although he attempts to tear to pieces all of
the fruits of the discussion conducted in the Daily for the past two months
he neglects entirely to present anything constructive and his only sugges
tion is one of laisse-faire, allowing things to remain exactly as they are—
which to the majority of the students is almost unbearable.
The Daily Palo Alto has aroused general interest upon this subject
in the hope that from the discussions some definite project would crystal
lize. Irwin's bombshell has accelerated matters greatly, and we now feel
it necessary to point out where he is wrong and illogical, and then let the
case rest, since the Daily discontinues publication tomorrow until next
quarter.
Irwin accuses the Daily Palo Alto of malicious and intentional mis
statement of facts, which words are libel in themselves, but fails to name
specific instances. Perhaps as he says we have traced the burning of the
bonfire to the sponsor system, and we are ready to prove at any time that
the sponsor system is a proximate cause in the chain of causation resulting
in the burning.
Considering first the sponsor system. According to Irwin, the spon
sors have nothing to do with teaching "traditions"; they are not a discip
linary body; they have not supplanted sophomore discipline; they are
merely advisors to improve scholarship and athletics, and are developers
of initiative and individuality. As inducements for upperclassmen to live
in Encina, they are given free rooms, and in the case of the fraternity men
residing there, an opportunity to line up prospective rushees.
Although the sponsors are appointed by the Dean of Men little effort
is being made to secure the outstanding leaders on the campus—the men
who have interest in the system and who will work to see that its aims,
vague as some of them may be, are advanced. Instead of this, every liv
ing group is represented as nearly as possible, with the result that some
almost unheard of upperclassmen receive appointments, purely because
their groups must have a delegate to the rushing center.
Where several hundred freshmen live together, it is desirable that some
older men live with them, so that they can assist the inexperienced students
in learning of the ways of the campus. Hence, some sort of sponsor sys
tem is necessary. But, clearly, that in vogue today is inadequate. Many
of the sponsors admit that they do not know what they are to do, other
than to have a desk and a bed in the hall. How many of the sponsors
spend any time encouraging the freshmen to develop initiative and leader
ship? or show them how to study? As far as we can see whatever contact
there is between sponsors and freshmen other than at meetings is in the
nature of "bull" sessions, which break up study instead of helping it.
Irwin says the scholarship of the freshman class has improved since
the installing of the sponsor system and the abolition of sophomore discip
line. It would have increased even under the old regime, because the
scholarship of the University as a whole has been improving regularly for
a number of years. Competition is continually becoming keener to get
into the University and those who succeed in securing admittance are
bound to be better students than those who entered the year before.
