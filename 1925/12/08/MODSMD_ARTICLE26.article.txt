This is the latest picture of Waldo
Slipensplash, noted high diver and winner
of the recent Mayfield Buckboard contest,

who will compete next
Wednesday at Lake La
gunita.
When asked how his
chances were of winning
the rosewood diving board
to be presented to the suc
cessful contestant at the
Lagunita Winter Diving
Tournament, Slipensplash
answered that he was a
cinch to win as he would

wear rubber overshoes, thus avoiding all
danger of sticking in the mud.—H. i.

She told me—
that she thought the universities should
be split into three parts. The first division
will be the Harvard, Yale, or Prince
ton Club. The second will be known
as the Athletic Club, and the third as
the Student Club. In this way the
snakes and football men will not be
bothered by the students or vice versa.
Each freshman will be given a personal
interview with the dean before he signs
up for any courses.
"Do you dance?" will be the Dean's first
question.
"Yes."
"Neck?"
"Yes."
"Pet? Mix?"
"No."
"Then I will have to enroll you as a
student because you can't enter the country
club unless you can mix cocktails."
that she thought Mr. Duke could have
obtained more publicity by billboard signs
than by giving $40,000,000 to Trinity Col
lege with the condition that the name be
came Duke University.—E. H.
* * *
He : Do you dance ?
She : Yes, I love to.
He : Well then, let's love.

Economical Transportation
"Hitch your wagon to a Star."
Wonder where the Chevrolet gets a
chance.
* * *
What!! Can it be? Did we see a fresh
man queening on the Quad? What ho,
Watson! Quick, the needle.
* * *
Slop some juice to Fontaine Cleek,
The triple-plated, tentless sheik.
He hangs out near the ladies' dorm.
And there he's found in sun or storm.
His special is a freshman dame
Who's easy stuff to old Fontaine.
The line he shoots would choke a horse;
For he's a college man, of course!

Slop some juice to Fontaine Cleek,

The line he shoots would choke a horse;
For he's a college man, of course!

This is the latest picture of Waldo
Slipensplash, noted high diver and winner
of the recent Mayfield Buckboard contest,

who will compete next
Wednesday at Lake La
gunita.
When asked how his
chances were of winning
the rosewood diving board
to be presented to the suc
cessful contestant at the
Lagunita Winter Diving
Tournament, Slipensplash
answered that he was a
cinch to win as he would

wear rubber overshoes, thus avoiding all
danger of sticking in the mud.—H. i.

She told me—
that she thought the universities should
be split into three parts. The first division
will be the Harvard, Yale, or Prince
ton Club. The second will be known
as the Athletic Club, and the third as
the Student Club. In this way the
snakes and football men will not be
bothered by the students or vice versa.
Each freshman will be given a personal
interview with the dean before he signs
up for any courses.
"Do you dance?" will be the Dean's first
question.
"Yes."
"Neck?"
"Yes."
"Pet? Mix?"
"No."
