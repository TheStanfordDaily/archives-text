# CAMPUS OPINION

### 
The Editor, Sir:
You have expressed a desire and a
need for the return of Sophomore con
trol of freshmen. Having lived at Stan
ford under that System and having
been personally interested in its abol
ishment, I would like to cite some of
the main reasons for its abolishment.
(1) It could not be controlled since
no one was directly responsible; thus,
many men were unjustly disciplined.
(2) It took too much time for both
the freshmen and the sophomores,
resulting in poor scholarship for both
classes. (3) The freshmen were curbed
in spirit and that resulted in losing
athletic teams. (4) A few cases of
physical injuries and many cases of
mental anguish caused much discom
fort to the first year men. (5) Is cre
ated an over-developed and unjustified
sense of importance in the second
year men. (6) It curbed all traces of
initiative and individuality so neces
sary to progress in any line of en
deavor.
Do you believe that a return to
Sophomore Control could be accom
plished without a return of the attend
ant evils? An example of how far our
present class would go under Sopho
more control was evidenced by the
Sophomore raid on Encina this year
in which some two hundred dollars'
worth of uncalled-for and unnecessary
damage was done to the building;
typewriters, watches, and a piano dam
aged and one man sent to the hospital
for a couple of weeks with physical
injuries. You ridicule the freshman
class for wanting to discuss traditions
and throw up your editorial hands in
horror at a bunch of seventeen-year
lolds suggesting such sacrilege. Do you
think we would improve matters by
: putting them in the hands of a bunch
| of eighteen-year-old Sophomores? No!
I'd much rather let our twenty-year-old
editors tell them what to do. I prom
j ised in a previous article to give the
I aims of the Sponsor system and how
| far they were accomplished. The aims
[are: (1) To improvo the scholarship
I of the freshman class by advising and
aiding them and providing an atmos
phern conducive to regular and sys
tematic studying. (2) To improve our
j freshman athletic teams by providing
jan opportunity for better class or
| ganization and class spirit uninter
rupted by night escapades. (3) The
development of leaders and the en
i oouragement of initiative and individu-
I ality.

We have accomplished these aims
to this extent: (1) Freshman scholar
ship has made an unusual improve
ment each year under the Sponsor
system. (2) Leaders have been devel
oped and initiative and individuality
have been displayed. (3) Our freshman
athletic teams have made remarkable
records during the last two years.

The Editor, Sir:
In a recent editorial you ridiculed
the freshman class for having the
audacity to discuss some of our so
called "traditions" and in various edi
torials have bemoaned the fact that
freshmen were not living up to the fine
example set by previous classes —in-
cluding your own class, Mr. Editor. Do
you know what a tradition is? and why
it is a tradition? Do you know when
the various so-called traditions such
as "dink-wearing," "match-carrying,"
"pine-smoking," were started at Stan
ford? and why? and by whom? and
for what purpose? Do you know that
not one of these customs is original
with Stanford? That not one of them
typifies or means anything in par
ticular to the Stanford man except that
like blind fools they must carry on
some idiotic customs originated, God
knows where, and adopted, for a lack
of better sense.
You worry about what the "older
timers" will think: here's what one of
them thinks and he is well-known and
respected by the present Stanford stu
dent body and graduated in 1904. He
said, "Stanford in the last fifteen
years has taken on the greatest body
of poppycock under the guise of tra
ditions of any modern university with
such a short history." Another mnn,
who held a Stanford-California dis
tance record in track until the last
season, and who was active in student
affairs at Stanford and a real old
timer said he believed the college
would be better off if they did away
with all such foolish customs. Only
such customs as are beneficial and par
ticipated in by the entire student body
should be maintained.
I realize that both sides could get.
all the testimonials they wanted, but
I mention these because, owing to past
publicity we would be led to believe
that our alumni were disappointed in
us. No, I don't believe tliev are in
tensely interested in that. When you
go out to look for work after you
graduate, very few will care if you
"queened on the Quad" if you can per
form the task cut out for you, and
even if you didn't wear your "dink,"
if you have sufficient initiative to
make a practical application of your
education you will be able anyway to
compete with the dink-wearing gradu
ates of other institutions.
J. C. Irwin.
The Editor, Sir:
The idea of the freshman class ris
ing up and trying to overthrow uni
versity traditions is nothing less than
an outrage and an insult to our
alumni. Stanford is already notorious
ly considerate of its first-year men,
even to the extent of failing adequate
ly to introduce them to college life.
One of the big things in college, and
any alumnus will so testify, is a man's
"breaking in." It is sometimes a little
hard on the frosh, but it helps to
make a man of him, and who would
suggest that we want any but men
here. The freshman resolution of last
Thursday evening was quite as ab
surd as would be an attempt on the
part of Palo Alto to vote itself capital
of California. Upperclassmen! Let us
act —lets us save Stanford from being
the laughing-stock among universities.
H. v d W, '28.
The Editor, Sir:
The writer would like to give voice
to a criticism which he has discussed
with another who is of the same opin
ion. This relates to Mr. Irwin's some
what astonishing letter published in
the Daliy Palo Alto last Monday, con
cerning the Editor's policy in regard
to Stanford traditions.
In that letter Mr. Irwin devotes
some 225 words of a 375-word epistle
to a personal attack upon the Editor.
The remaining 150 words he devotes
to a refutation which, though it is
evidently the purpose for which the
letter was written, does not help to
make the controversy much clearer.
It does not seem as if such an ex
pression as that of Mr. Irwin's is
worthy of the Head Sponsor.
Sincerely, C. E. H., '24.
