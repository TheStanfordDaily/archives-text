# R. O. T. C. OFFERS EXTENSIVE COURSES FOR NEXT QUARTER
## Large Enrollment May Force Military Department To Limit Numbers 
### 
In view ot tlie increased enrollment
in the Military department during the
fall quarter and the number of re
quests the department has had for in
formation about its routine and
courses, Major Geary states that he
expects an unusually large number of
students to enroll for the winter Quar
ter, and has therefore issued a num
ber of instructions for those who are
interested in the department.
Registration for the It. O. T. C. will
be in the Administration Building on
Monday, January 4, in the usual man
ner, and all students in the depart
ment are requested to report to one of
the officers conducting the registra
tion in order to avoid delays in start
ing the new quarter. Regular instruc
tion will begin on Tuesday.
Courses Offered
The practical work will consist of
mounted reconnaissance, harness driv
ing, pistol practice, use of fire control
instruments and gunners' examina
tions. New men joining the unit will
be given instruction in equitation half
of each drill period. It is desired that
all old students select the same drill
day as they had the fall quarter as
far as practicable.
The following theoretical courses
will be given by the department:
Field Artillery Students —
Freshmen —Artillery Materiel.
Sophomores—Communications.
Juniors —Artillery Firing (cont.)
Seniors —Military Law.
Ordnance Students —
Subjects as announced by Captain
Atwood. Details are in the time
schedule.
Any R. O. T. C. student who is not
to return to the University next quar
ter should turn in any uniform or
equipment he may have drawn. This
is very important as all such property
belongs to the government and is
merely loaned to the student for his
use while actually in the department.
All students who have been in the
department should report at the mili
tary registration desk even if, for any
reason, they are not to continue work
in the department—this in order that
all records may be kept complete and
up-to-date.
Absences Posted
A list of absences during the autumn
quarter has been posted on the Bul
letin Board near the Saddle Room. All
make-up classes must be completed
this week.
The department plans to be more
liberal with mounted passes during
the winter quarter. The added privi
leges, including Sunday riding, how
ever, will continue only so long as
regulations are carried out in good
faith. Requests for passes must be
made out well ahead of time.
The department has so increased
lately that it has been considering
limiting enrollment. However, arrange
ments have been made so that this is
now not necessary and it is in shape
to accept another large increase in
enrollment.
