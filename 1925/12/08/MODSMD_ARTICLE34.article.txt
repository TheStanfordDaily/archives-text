# Hoboes Club Proves to Be Success in Georgia
## 
### 
Macon, Ga., Dcc. 7.â€”A Hoboes Club is
one of the prominent organizations at the
University of Merccr here. The club has
been in existence for about a year, and
claims to have established new standards
for hoboes. "While every collcgc has its
hoboes they are widely different in the
fields they embrace. Some hitch-hike, and
some travel on the beams of a freight car
to harvest fields; and some work the sea
ports and ship out as deck hands."
The Iloboes Club has limited its mem
bership to 25 persons, and made the quali
fication that the prospective member shall
have hoboed 1,000 miles since last June.
The president is known as Regal Rod
Rider; the vice-president, Duke o' the
Dust; the secretary, Holder of the Jack.
Mercer University is not the only one
that is interested in this art. A parallel
can be found in the Sundower's Club at
the University of Washington.
At Obcrlin, last year one man conducted
a seminar in hoboing. For a small fee he
initiated beginners in the art of vagabond
age, and gave courscs in both freight and
passenger bumming.
