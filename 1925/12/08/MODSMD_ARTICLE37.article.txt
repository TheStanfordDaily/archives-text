# FINAL HOCKEY GAME SCHEDULED TOMORROW
## 
### 
The freshman and sophomore hockey
teams will play for third and fourth
places in the championship series to
morrow afternoon at' 4:20 o'clock on
Roble field. This will be t'jje last first
team game of the season.
The sophomores defeated the fresh
men during the practice series, but
the recent loss of one of their regular
backfield players through ineligibility
may seriously handicap the second
year women. In their game with the
seniors last week they were severely
hampered by the additional absence
of two backs who were ill. These two
will be in the game tomorrow, how
ever, and the sophomore backfield may
be completely reorganized and efficient
by that time.
