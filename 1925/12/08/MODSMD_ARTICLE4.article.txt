# ELY AND LAMSON WRITE RAM'S HEAD SHOW PLOT
## 
### Isabel Schanck 
The plot submitted by Mike Ely and
Dave Lamson was chosen for the an
nual Ram's Head show to be given
February 12 at a meeting of the play
committee held yesterday afternoon.
Dave Mannoccir was selected to be
the show director and Jack Wiggin for
musical director. The selections for
directors were passed on by the Dra
matic Council last evening.
With the 1926 performance Ram's
Head will return to the old tradition
of presenting a burlesque in broad
satire. College will be the basis for
the theme which deals with men of
the Rov.er boy type. The play,
committee for* selection of the script
consists of Irving Anschutz, Davo
Mannoccir, Delmer Daves, Mike Ely,
and Lloyd Nolan.
Ely was the author of last year's
Ram's Head show, "The Devil's Daugh
ter," and was formerly editor of Chap
arral. Lamson wrote two of the acts
in the football show given November
20, "What Price Phi Bete," and "Fan

tasia Fromage," and was editor of
Chaparral last year.
Mannoccir directed "The Devil's
Daughter" and has been prominent in
campus productions for several years.
Wiggin was musical director of the
football show, and took part in
"Dulcy," "Ace High," the 1926 Junior
Opera, and "The Devil's Daughter."
Ram's Head was first organized as
a campus society in 1911. The next
year, 1912, the first annual burlesque
called "Rambling Rameses" was pro
duced on October 18. Since then Ram's
Head has made its show an annual
affair.
Efforts will be made to have original
music for the 1926 show, in keeping
with the atmosphere of the play itself.
All campus composers are requested
to communicate with Jack Wiggin at
the A. T. O. house, P. A. 1142, in order
that work may begin on this phase
of the production as soon as possible.
Tryouts for parts will take place
after the holidays, and rehearsals will
commence early to insure a smooth
performance.
