# TASTES OF WOMEN, MEN OUTLINED BY STANFORD DIETICIAN
## Stanford Students Like Boston Baked Beans and Brown Bread 
### Hallie Keating 
"What a college man likes to eat, and
what a college woman likes is about as
. different as can be found on a menu,"
j says Miss Annie R. Sproule. Miss
i Sproule has had the opportunity to ob
: serve the appetites of college students
j here during her several years in charge
of the Encina dining room, and because
; of her superintending the diets of scv
| eral sorority houses.
J "The most striking difference in taste
i is that women like all kinds of salads,
! and men generally don't. The latter
j are very fond of pineapple and cottage
| cheese salad, but will not as a rule like
! other types. The Encina boys were
j generally indignant when they were
j served combination, or vegetable salad,
j because tlicy complained of being
served left-overs. As a matter of fact
j it is one of the most expensive salads
' we serve, and is very difficult to prepare
| for a group."
"Women are fond of soups, but men
I generally can't be bothered with them.
However, they surely go out of their
way for cream soups."
"Both men and women seem to be
fond of Boston baked beans, but not
j unless a slice of brown bread with
raisins is served with the beans. Con
j trary to popular opinion, men are more
| fond of cakes, and pastries than the
women. When we serve pies and cakes
with rich icings they go much faster at
! the men's dining rooms than with the
j women.
As part of her training in dietetics
j Miss Sproule investigated the tastes of j
j various classes of workers. "The girls
jat the Bell Telephone Company eat
i their lunches almost entirely of cream
| puffs. The company tried to govern
! this, and help them get balanced meals,
!by installing automats. An automat is
I a sort of cafeteria, where one serves
J oneself entirely. To obtain a dish you
! insert five cents, or a multiple of five,
j into a slot. The dishes arc displayed in
j glass cases, behind the slot mechanism.
1 By this system the company could offer
combination luncheons which contained
a well-regulated diet, at a reasonable
rate.
