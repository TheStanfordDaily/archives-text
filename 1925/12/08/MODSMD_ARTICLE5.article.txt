# JOURNALISTS HAVE BIG RESPONSIBILITY DECLARES M'KERNON
## Associated Press Division Head Stresses Need For Preparation 
### 
The college man contemplating jour
nalism as a profession should be con
cerned first of all and most seriously
with his own state of mind, according
to Edward McKernon, eastern division
superintendent of the Associated
Press. His conception of journalism
should be of a profession offering op
portunities for service and he should
be conscious of a sense of profound
responsibility.
Journalism should not be considered
as a "game," says McKernon, who ad
vises against choosing the profession
for the sake of chance and adventure.
"Journalism is no longer a haphaz
ard affair in which the reporter with
the most nerve and best luck always
comes to the top," says McKernon.
Journalism has recently been placed
on a scientific basis, the editor no
longer takes things merely to fill up
his paper. Today the Associated Press
surveys the world daily and selects
deliberatively events the world over
which are significant. This news is
grouped into certain alloted spaces
and in this way the reader learns
everything he ought to know with its
relative importance indicated by the
space given it. Ordinarily the reader
has little time and is not inclined to
determine for himself the relative im
portance of what he reads. But as he
reads he thinks, and as he thinks he
acts, and what he has read is reflected
in his daily talk and conversation.
Since millions of persons are influ
enced by the press, a great responsi
bility rests upon journalists, who
should contemplate their work with
seriousness.
McKernon points out that there is
plenty of adventure in journalism but
the more growing journalists keep
their minds on the matter of a sound
preparation, the better. Prospective
journalists should have all the educa
tion they can acquire. History, politi
cal economy, and a grasp of national
and international affairs help to build
| a sure foundation. If other things are
i equal, a man with a college education
: will go further than a man without
one.
It is extremely difficult to obtain
I newspaper men who can or will write
I good English. If a man can talk simply
: with due regard to the sequence of
I events, he will write effectively. The
rudiments of the English language are
! essential.
