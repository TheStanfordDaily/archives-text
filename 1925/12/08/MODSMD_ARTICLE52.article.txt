## 
### 
The attention of all prospective sport
managers and all men taking physical
education for credit is called to the
following statement of the physical
education department:
"Under a recent ruling by Dr. Bar
rows, director of athletics, all try
outees for managerial positions who
have not fulfilled their physical edu

the sport in which they are interested.
This is absolutely essential, since, be
