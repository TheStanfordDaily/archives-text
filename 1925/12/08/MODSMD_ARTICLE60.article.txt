After ten minutes' deliberation the |
jury in the case of A. B. Cox, '07, ar
rested in connection with the Mullen's
Hall riot, returned a verdict of "not
guilty." From the opening of the case
this morning at 10 o'clock, it was evi
dent that the prosecution was making
a weak attempt to convict, and the
verdict was 110 surprise to the large
crowd of students and townspeople
who attended the trial. "Dad" Moulton
and several other witnesses testified
to Cox's good record in the past.
Chief Hill stated tonight that the
police would not drop the matter and
that students may look for more ar
rests in the near future.

Communication to tne Editor of the
Daily Palo Alto: As my seat was next
to that of the student who was first
assaulted, I saw the whole affair from
beginning to end. This student had
been taking no part in the "joshing"
of the show, but as he was a small
fellow and sat in the back row, where
he could easily be attacked from be
hind, he was made the object of the
first assault. A big ruffian coming up
behind him seized him by the collar
while he swung a heavy wagon-spoke,
and dragging him bodily over the back
of the seat, started for the door. The
cry "Stanford men" rang out and in
five seconds every Stanford man was
in the back of the room. In the second
attack the deputies used their clubs
freely, hitting men full in the face
with heavy loaded billies and other
weapons such as wagon-spokes and
heavy canes, the effect of which would
be to leave a man disfigured for life.
No class of men are more reasonable
than college students, but every col
lege man demands a square deal and
fair play.
