# ALABAMA ACCEPTS PROPOSAL TO PLAY EAST-WEST GAME
## Washington Reconsiders' May Sign Up for Contest New Year's Day 
### 
Alabama versus Washington looms
as the East-West game to be played
New Year's in the Pasadena Rose
Bowl. The University of Alabama has
already signed a contract to play
against a Pacific Coast team on that
day, while the University of Washing
ton, who rejected the proposal when
first made, is reconsidering it in the
light of an official request from H. C.
Howe, Oregon president of the Pacific
Coast Conference.
Alabama's eleven has been neither
defeated nor tieto, and has run up 277
points in nine games. The Huskies arÂ£
the possessors of the Coast Confer
ence title, with an unbroken string of
victories.
Arrangements for an East-West
football game at the Tournament of
Roses have been under way for some
time, but Jack W. Benefiel, represent
ing the Coast teams in the East, has
had trouble in signing up an Eastern
competitor.
