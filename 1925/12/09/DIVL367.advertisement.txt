To Please a Man-
Give Him Shoes
It's not hard to thoroughly please a man, if you
simply remember his is a practical nature that
abhors gee-gaws and welcomes sensible gifts, such
# as shoes. Remember, too, that men admire and
appreciate real Quality and we venture the guess
that no gift would please Dad more than a pair of
"Hanan Shoes" —$14.00 to $16.50 —and worth more
than their price in actual wear. And it's a very easy
matter to discover the size of his most comfortable
old shoes, to guide you in selecting the correct size.
