# "Imports" to Be Taboo; Stanford Women Only At Toyon Club Dance
## 
### 
A dance to which only Stanford
women will be admitted is being
planned for January 22 by Toyon
Club. This will be an innovation
on the campus, and will be given
for the purpose of getting Stan
ford men and women better ac
quainted, according to Ward A.
Hill, president of the club.
The "import" and all outside
dates will be taboo, as a student
body ticket will be required for
admittance. The dance will be
an informal one o'clock, held in
the Toyon ballroom.
Campus women are requested
by date-seekers to regard any in
vitation which they may receive
from a not-too-well-known ac
quaintance in the spirit in which
it is given.
