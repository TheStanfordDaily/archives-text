# SENIORS WIN 1925 HOCKEY TITLE BY DEFEATING JUNIORS
## First Half Ends Scoreless; Greater Endurance Gains Victory for 1926 
### 
Blocked in its attack during the i
entire first half of the game, the senior 5
hockey team crashed through the
junior defense to win the interelass
championship with a 3 to 1 victory
yesterday afternoon.
The first half of yesterday's game
was bitterly fought but ineffective.
Neither team scored, although both
threatened often. The play shifted
from one end of the field to the other
almost momentarily. Every time, how-1
ever, the backs of the defending team |
stiffened to start the ball down the
field again toward the opponents' goal.
The juniors weakened as the second
half began, and the seniors broke
through for two scores, one by Cecile
Feusier and one by Millison Hardy.
A substitution in the junior left wing
further weakened the 1927 defense.
The seniors quickly found the weak
position, and attacked insistently;
through it.
The juniors, however, rallied, and |
Nellie Shepherd, outdistancing the |
whole field, carried the ball to the
senior goal. With the score 2 to 1,
the juniors hurled themselves at the
senior line and took the ball into the
scoring circle. The juniors let the
seniors through for another score, by ;
Helen Erskine, the forward attacking
through the weak left wing position, i
For the remaining three minutes of j
the game the juniors held, but could \
do no more than prevent the seniors
from scoring again.
During the first half the teams
seemed almost evenly matched, the
junior backfield repulsing the senior
attack effectively, and the seniors
guarding their goal successfully. The
junior team, however, went into the
game tired, and gave out more easily.
This told in the second half, when the l
fullbacks failed sufficiently to cover
the weaknesses in their teamwork.
On the whole the juniors played an
excellent, steady game, but they did
not meet the brilliancy of the senior
forwards in the last period of the
game. They did not show the endur
ance that would have been necessary
to defeat the seniors.
