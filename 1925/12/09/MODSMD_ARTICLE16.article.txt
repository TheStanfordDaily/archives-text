# PAUL HARVEY GIVES SUPPORT TO PUBLIC OPINION IN LECTURE
## 
### 
"Public opinion is essential in the
guidance of foreign affairs in the
United States today," said Paul Har
vey in his lecture yesterday morning
to the Citizenship class.
"Previous to the war, all the indi
vidual or the local group needed to
know about and handle was its own
local problems, but the war has
changed all that. It has international
ized affairs. During the war the
American farmer learned that, if Eu
rope was unable to buy, he was un
able to sell his products. He and all
other American producers wish to
avoid such circumstances in the fu
ture.
"Public opinion is of particular im
portance in the United States where
the powers of adopting a foreign pol
icy are are not invested in the presi
dent, but in Congress, which is direct
ly responsible to the people. It is im
possible for Congress to adopt a con
sistent foreign policy until public
opinion has expressed itself.
"Public opinion today must be more
far-reaching in regard to world affairs
than ever before. It must go beyond
the superficial reasons of war and
formulate a plan insuring peace. Pub
lic opinion must focus on the causes
of peace."
Harvey advocated the World Court
as the best existing plan. "It is a
plan conceived by three American
statesmen, Taft, Root, and Hay, and
to which America has hitherto given
no support," he claimed. These three
men first planned an international
tribunal to substitute law for war. In
supporting the World Court. Harvey
said, "Law is the only means of regu
lating human relationships and pre
venting them from descending into
violence."
