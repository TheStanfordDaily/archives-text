# FRESHMAN FIVE WIN CLASS CAGE TITLE FROM '26
## Seniors Defeated 21 to 12 in Rough Fight Against Freshman Offensive 
### 
Crushing the senior quintet under a
score of 21 to 12, the freshman cagers
won their third game and the inter
class basketball title yesterday after
noon at Encina gymnasium. Though
the play was rough and ragged, the
babes showed a powerful offensive
with plenty of fight. Nothing resem
bling good pass-work nor basket
shooting was displayed by either
team.
Although the juniors and sopho
mores play the last game of the series
tomorrow, the 1929 men are the only
ones who have a hundred per cent
standing. If the sophomores score a
win over the juniors, a triple tie for
second place will result.
Stars Lacking
No outstanding stars showed up on
either quintet. Tex Middleton, 1926
center, was high-point man of the
game with ten of the seniors' twelve
points to his credit. Sherman Crary
accounted for seven of the babes' tal
lies, Charles Smalling for six, and
Paul Sexson for four.
The first half was a decisive fresh
man victory. Middleton sank the 1926
five's only basket at the first of the
period. Then Smalling hooped two
free throws, and McCandless dropped
in a sucker shot from under the bas
ket.
The seniors experienced some hard
luck on several near-baskets, but
Smalling, frosh forward, balanced one
on the edge for a tally. After some
slow play on the seniors' part, Crary,
shifty babe forward, dropped a shot
in from the corner, and soon followed
it with another tally. The period end
ed with the score 10 to 2 in the fresh
men's favor.
Play Speeds at Half
Faster play began in the second
half when Wilton increased the babes*
lead with a pretty shot from beyond
the foul line. Then Middleton got into
his stride, scoring on two clean shots
from the side and a sucker shot on a
pass from Harlow. With the score 12
to 8 the frosh woke up. Sexson, who
had substituted for Crary, scored twice,
once on a shot from center and once
on a lucky try. A free throw by Crary
and a field goal by Smalling put the
score at 19 to 8.
Seniors Rally
The J926 men rallied again, Tex
Middleton and Harlew each account
ing for a basket. A clever dribble by
Crary gave him a sucker shot, and
made the score 21 to 12. When the
final gun was shot, the babes had won
the interclass championship.
The line-ups were as follows:
Freshmen: Crary (7), Smalling (6),
forwards; McCandless (2), center;
