Realizing the evils of standardization in universities, Cardinal Newman,
in his Dublin lectures, recently declared, "How much better, I say, is it for
the active and thoughtful intellect, where such is to be found, to eschew
the college and the university altogether, than to submit to a drudgery so
ignoble, a mockery so conturelius! How much more profitable for the
independent mind, after the mere rudiments of education, to range through
a library at random taking down books as they meet him, and pursuing
trains of thought which his mother wit suggests!"
This statement is an expression of the present clay tendency in educa
tion —the providing of opportunity for superior minds to develop along
the most profitable paths and with as little restriction as possible. The
Independent Study Plan in operation at Stanford provides just such an
opportunity. And with its adoption Stanford showed that it is keeping
pace with the most constructive of the new ideas.
