FA BLE OF FEE BLE PHIL-IP
Phil-in was the High School Low
brow. He was Col-leg-iate when he
was a Fresh-man in High. When he
Be-came a Soph, he was More So, and
When he Be-came a Jun-ior, he was a
Mess. He wore the Snap-piest Clothes
Out, and he Al-ways got the New
Things be-fore They were Thought of
by Other Stu-dents. He went Out with
the Jaz-zy Crowd, and All the Ma-trons
in the Town Pre-dic-ted a Sad and
Speed-y End-ing for Phil. Some Even
Ex-pected Him to be Hung. The Cap
of the Cli-max Came when He Went
Away to Col-lege.
Now, when He Ar-rived at Col-lege,
we should Expect that Some Sweet
Girl took Him in Hand and Showed
Tim the E-vil of His Ways But
Moral: A-las, this Is'n't a True
Story; It's a Fa-ble.

Blow the foam for Peggy Rice,
A good girl who is really nice!
She never necks, she never pets—
(Just take a look at what she gets!)
If you should* ask to hold her hand,
She'd bawl you out to beat the band.
Oh. Peggy long will be neglected.
Until she gets her line perfected.
—L. A. B.

We notice that the University of
Michigan has discovered that ninety
six per cent of its students have read
parts of the Bible. Wonder how many
students here can say the same; and
how many know the plot, or the main
characters, and the author?
From all sounds, they seem pretty
intimate with him.
