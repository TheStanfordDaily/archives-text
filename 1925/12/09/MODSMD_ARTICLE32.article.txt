# ART FOR ART'S SAKE
## Invocation 
### 
Oh! Would I were a musiker;
To strum upon a mandolin,

To play of love and hate and sin,
And blow on a harmoniker.
Synopsis of Plot
A guy there was in London town
Of wisdom keen, of figure fair,
With purple eyes and greenish hair.
His singing brought him great renown.
He sang old Franz Lizt's "Liebe
straum,"
The audience went wild with glee.
He said: "They're very proud of me."
Which, to his spirit, was a balm.
But lasting fame ne'er came to him,
For he was poor and she was not.
He had no car, nor house and lot,
Thus Fate did laugh, so cruel and grim.
L'Envoi
O! Would I were a real jazz hound,
To play a sax, or uke, or drum;
Then would I with hard cash abound,
And sweeties would not turn me down.
