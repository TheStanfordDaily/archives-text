# Mammoth Cave Blind Fish Given to Zoology Museum
## 
### 
A blind fish from Mammoth Cave,
Kentucky, has been presented to the
Zoological Museum by Dr. William F.
Allen, '98, professor of Anatomy at the
Oregon Medical College. The fish is a
very rare specimen and is about an
inch and a half long.
These fish are found in the lime
stone caves on both sides of the Ohio
river, particularly on the southern
side. The fish have lost the sight of
their eyes through lack of use. They
are of a translucent white color when
alive, and are found together with
blind curstacea and salamander and
seem to depend entirely upon their
sense of touch for guidance.
