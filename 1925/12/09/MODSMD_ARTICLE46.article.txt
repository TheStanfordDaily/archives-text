# DAY'S DOINGS

<S>â€” Ted Elias, Jr.
Daily closes with this issue.
So its staff can stay in school,
Though you miss your reading matter,
Please apply the "Golden Rule."
Just a word of admonition,
Of the things we are to suffer,
Final Exes are among us,
Tims are tough and getting tougher.
Prosh again display their prowess,
Winning hoopster championship,
Take their Dinks, and give them
Queening,
And there's no one they can't whip.
Senior women win the title,
In the annual Hockey matches;
Good consistent playing did it,
Coupled with some brilliant snatches.
Now I'll pour me out a drink, and
Gulp 'er down, for I am through,
Let me hope you hit your finals,
And I'll bid you all adieu.
