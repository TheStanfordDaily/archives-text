The Editor. Sir:
I would like to question your view
under the heading "Coming Through"
lin Monday's D. P. A. How is it that
the damage done to Encina during the
sophomore raid "was not due alto
' gether to their fault" and why is it
j that they should not pay for the dam
i age? Sophomore raids are directly
1 against the rules of the University
! and as the sophs broke the rules, they
j should pay for the damage.
i How did the sophomores clear $250
!on the dance? After the tickets had
been sold with "Supper Checks" the
supper was called off and the only re
freshments served besides the usual
punch were a few cakes. I don't be
lieve more than fifty couples partook
of them, due to the insufficiency. I did
not find anyone among my friends who
was lucky enough to obtain one. I
think it would be a good idea to ring
off the praise for the sophomore
class until they are more deserving.
—F. N. C.

[The Editor, Sir:
It is hard to believe that Jake Irwin
of yesterday's viewpoint is the same
Jake Irwin of last winter. The writer
of this viewpoint objected last year
to the wearing of the dink. He made
the point that the class as a whole
should either wear or discard dinks.
Irwin was the most prominent of those
sponsors who had him on the carpet
and put him through the third degree.
Irwin wanted to know why the of
fender had come to Stanford, what
| Stanford meant to him, and impressed
■ upon him generally the sacredness of
the Stanford traditions and the gen
eral uselessness of any man not ob-
I serving them. Irwin's main point was
that a non-observer of traditions at
Stanford does not deserve the privi
lege of coming to Stanford. Contrast
this attitude with the following quota
tions from Irwin's viewpoint of yes
terday. "Do you know that not one
of these customs is original with Stan
ford? That not one of them typifies or
means anything in particular to the
Stanford man except that like blind
j fools they must carry on some idiotic
; customs originated, God knows where,
and adopted, for a lack of better
sense?" And again, "When you go out
to look for work after you graduate,
very few will care if you 'queened on
the Quad' if you can perform the task
cut out for you, and even if you didn't
wear your dink, if you have sufficient
initiative to make a practical applica
tion of your education, you will be
able anyway to compete with the dink
wearing graduate of other institu
tions."
Assuming that JaVp Irwin is in+oiit
gent, we must necessarily conclude
that both his attitude tnis year anu
last were taken only after careful con
sideration, since any man who would
undertake without careful considera
tion to state his opinions as vigorously
in both cases as Irwin did is a fool.
The inconsistency, then, that appears
in the two stands taken by him can

only be explained by admitting that j
Jake Irwin is looking for a tight. It is '
the writer's sincere wish that the
thinking element of the student body i
will be able to furnish him a good one ]
next quarter. —X. Y. X., '28.

The Editor. Sir:
I would like to question your view
under the heading "Coming Through"
lin Monday's D. P. A. How is it that
the damage done to Encina during the
sophomore raid "was not due alto
' gether to their fault" and why is it
j that they should not pay for the dam
i age? Sophomore raids are directly
1 against the rules of the University
! and as the sophs broke the rules, they
j should pay for the damage.
i How did the sophomores clear $250
!on the dance? After the tickets had
been sold with "Supper Checks" the
supper was called off and the only re
freshments served besides the usual
punch were a few cakes. I don't be
lieve more than fifty couples partook
of them, due to the insufficiency. I did
not find anyone among my friends who
was lucky enough to obtain one. I
think it would be a good idea to ring
off the praise for the sophomore
class until they are more deserving.

[The Editor, Sir:
It is hard to believe that Jake Irwin
of yesterday's viewpoint is the same
Jake Irwin of last winter. The writer
of this viewpoint objected last year
to the wearing of the dink. He made
the point that the class as a whole
should either wear or discard dinks.
Irwin was the most prominent of those
sponsors who had him on the carpet
and put him through the third degree.
Irwin wanted to know why the of
fender had come to Stanford, what
| Stanford meant to him, and impressed
■ upon him generally the sacredness of
the Stanford traditions and the gen
eral uselessness of any man not ob-
I serving them. Irwin's main point was
that a non-observer of traditions at
Stanford does not deserve the privi
lege of coming to Stanford. Contrast
this attitude with the following quota
tions from Irwin's viewpoint of yes
terday. "Do you know that not one
of these customs is original with Stan
ford? That not one of them typifies or
means anything in particular to the
Stanford man except that like blind
j fools they must carry on some idiotic
; customs originated, God knows where,
and adopted, for a lack of better
sense?" And again, "When you go out
to look for work after you graduate,
very few will care if you 'queened on
the Quad' if you can perform the task
cut out for you, and even if you didn't
wear your dink, if you have sufficient
