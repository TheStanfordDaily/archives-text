# CHINA NEEDS SOCIAL REORGANIZATION SAYS HARVEY
## Educational System, Religion, Ancestor Worship Cause Present Situation 
### 
China is in need of a reorganization
jof its economic rather than of its
• political system, according to Paul
j Harvey in his discussion of the Prob-
I lems of the Pacific Tuesday evening,
i Economic scarcity is the real and
j basic cause for oriental distress. China
j has the largest population in the world
I and its standard of living is the low
est. It is necessary to raise her stand
ard of living and her per capita pro
duction, believes Harvey.
China's ancestor worship, her reli
gion, and her system of education en
compassing only the cultural side with
no regard to the practical, are largely
responsible for her lack of develop
ment. "Religious intolerance and rigid
ity of creeds form barricades to civili
zation," said Harvey. Any nation which
does not have three essential points
cannot prove its survival value. First
it must produce more than it uses and
must utilize the excess to increase
efficiency; secondly, there must be
certain restraint among the nations;
and thirdly, the nations must learn to
adapt themselves to changing condi
tions of a dynamic world and learn to
cooperate with one another since
nothing constructive has ever been
accomplished by isolation.
