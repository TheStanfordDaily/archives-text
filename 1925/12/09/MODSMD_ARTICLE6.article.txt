# MOVEMENTS OF EYE IN READING CHINESE RECORDED BY MILES
## 
### 
Photographic recording of eye move
ments in the reading of Chinese is the
| subject of an article by Walter R.
| Miles, professor of psychology, in a
j current issue of a psychological jour
: nal, which describes the method and
â–  preliminary results of a unique experi
| ment along this line.
Professor Miles is a member of the
Stanford faculty and this semester is
substituing at the University of Cali
fornia in the absence of Professor
George M. Stratton of the department
of psychology.
The object of Dr. Miles' experiment
was to determine whether Chinese,
i which is usually printed in the verti
cal axis, is read with the same type
; of eye movement as English. These
j observations were conducted by Pro
j fessor Miles during the last year at
j Stanford with the co-operation of Eu
j gene Shen, a graduate student in psy
j chology, and eleven Chinese students
i who served as subjects for the investi
| gation.
j Observation was made of the rapid
i ity with which these students read
; the Chinese characters, printed first
| in vertical lines and then in horizontal
; lines. It was found that the eleven
! students read on the average seven
word-characters a second, and that
they covered more than one character,
usually two, per reading pause of the
j eyes. This definitely proves that Chi
| nese, although more, compact in ar
j rangement, is read with the same type
| of eye movements with which English
j is read.
The results would also indicate that
I the vertical arrangement seems to
j have the advantage of being slightly
| more efficient than the horizontal.
This latter may be due, however, to
I the fact that these Chinese students
were more practiced in reading verti
; cal Chinese than horizontal Chinese,
J even though they had read much Eng
lish. This remains for more extensive
experiment to prove.
