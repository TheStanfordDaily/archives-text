# RETURN OF STEELE, NEVERS AUGMENTS BASKETBALL SQUAD
## First Team Loses to Second Five 22-9 in Practice Game Yesterday 
### 
With Gurdon Steele reporting for
' practice yesterday and Ernie Nevers
' the day before, the varsity basketball j
squad has about reached its full j
| strength in numbers at least. This is !
with the exception of Newhouse, who j
1 has not yet signified his intention of
! returning to school next quarter.
But all is not so well with the team
i as has been previously believed. Coach
j Andy Kerr is not satisfied with the !
! progress of the men he is grooming
: for standing guard. Furthermore, j
| something was seen to be sadly amiss
i after an informal game yesterday,
i when the score book showed the sec
| ond team had beaten the first five by
i a score of 22 to 9.
Offense Developed
j The offense of the team has been!
i developed to a fair stage but the men >
, have not yet found themselves when j
; on the defense. The weakness is not I
j so much in the guards as it is in the i
| failure of the forwards to fall back in j
: their defensive positions when they j
; have lost possession of the ball,
j Kerr used Steele at standing guard j
i on the first five for awhile yesterday, i
i Steele may be the solution to the i
i standing guard problem.
To Play San Jose
The game with the San Jose Teach
ers College will be played Saturday j
evening at 8 o'clock in the pavilion,!
as originally scheduled. This game;
will afford Kerr a good opportunity to |
get a line on which of his various
combinations work the best. The squad
j will get a week's vacation during the j
; holidays, returning to school on the j
126 th. Their next game will be with
j the Amblers Club at Stockton, Janu-j
i ary 2.
The 145-pound team will meet the
j Palo Alto High School quintet in a
I preliminary game which is scheduled
j to start at 7 o'clock.
