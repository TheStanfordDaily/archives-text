"THE BANDIT'S BABY"
With the Marvel Horse
SILVER KING
He was only a bandit —supposed-
ly a "hard egg"—the only one
to care for the baby. Except the
bandit's horse! What a time
they had in quieting the kid!
What situations! What comedy!
What thrills! What drama!
What snap and speed and ori
ginality! You will enjoy every
minute of it.
