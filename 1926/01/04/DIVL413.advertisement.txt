annual January Clearance Sale. No doubt you have been looking
forward to this event as a means of supplying your home as well as
personal needs. Perhaps you, like many others, already know of
the wonderful opportunities that generally exist here during this
sale. So we feel that we need but to remind you that our big event
opens with hundreds of worthwhile savings, on good dependable
merchandise including our spring stock already in. There will per
haps be a little more thrill in this sale than in other years on account
of our enormous holiday business, which has left us with many short
ends, broken sizes and color assortments. These and others are
sufficient reasons why there will be many extraordinary savings
worth coming after. In addition to these big specials, we will offer
our entire stock (nothing reserved) at a ten-per-cent discount.
To miss this sale will be like throwing money in the Bay, for the
simple reason that you will need things some time in the very near
future and will buy them at the regular price, and perhaps the very
same stock. Get it now during this sale and have the use of it in
the meanwhile.
