# POLO TEAM LOSES TWO HARD-FOUGHT CONTESTS TO O.A.C.
## 
### 
By playing a hard riding game, the
strong Oregon Agricultural College
| polo team twice defeated Stanford in
jthe first polo match of the season. The
i first game, a six to three victory for
| the visitors, was played on the 21st of
i December, when the Aggies were en
j route to meet the University of Ari
j zona at Tuscon; the second game, a
: seven to two Aggie triumph, was
' played last Saturday during the re
i lurn trip.
In both games, the two squads were
! evenly matched in general ability, but
! the greater experience of the visitors
combined with daring riding gave
them a decisive advantage.
The first match was fought on a
rain-soaked field. The moisture failed
to hinder the Aggies, who started off
with a rush, knocking in a goal each
period. Stanford played a strong de
fensive game but the greater ability
of the Oregonians to push their
' mounts to the limit won the day.
Saturday the Aggies again featured
I their characteristic style. From the
whistle they outrode Stanford and
| forced the breaks. Steadily they ac
cumulated a lead which was only
slightly decreased when the Redshirts
scored in the fourth and sixth periods.
The entire Cardinal squad played
! good ball, but Thompson, participating
] for the first time in a varsity game,
'especially stood out for his fine co
j operation and teamwork.
At Tuscon, the Aggies lost the Ari
zona match, one game to two.
The following is the starting Stan
ford line-up: Krohn, 1; Brown, 2;
Thompson, 3; Baker, 4. Substitutes:
Weymouth for Krohn; Boss for Brown.
