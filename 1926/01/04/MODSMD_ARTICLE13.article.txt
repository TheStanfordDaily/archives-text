# ERNIE NEVERS SIGNS TO PLAY BIG LEAGUE BALL FOR ST. LOUIS
## Stanford Fullback Wins Glory In Professional Debut; Jim Lawson Plays 
### Frank Baker 
i Ernie Nevers has signed a contract
to play baseball with the St. Louis
l Americans, according to a telegram
| from Nevers to the San Francisco
j Chronicle received on the day he
played his first game of professional
football. Since the Cincinnati Reds
were unable to sign Ernie up after of
fering him a $5000 bonus for making
, a contract with them, it is thought
1 that the Browns have offered him
more money.
1 Under his present contract with the
Florida promoters. Nevers still has
| four of the five games of professional
football which he signed to play. But
that this will end his football career
is almost certain, for it is unlikely
I that the baseball magnates would look
I with favor upon his continuing with a
sport so dangerous to a baseball
player.
I Ernie's team, the All-Stars, was un
able to defeat Red Grange's Bears,
but he took the individual honors of
; the day. He stopped Grange, and made
the only six points for the All-Stars.
! Although he fumbled three times, one
allowing a touchdown for the Bears,
I Ernie did practically all of the work
in preparation for the one touchdown,
and did some spectacular punting. Jim
Lawson, captain of the 1924 varsity,
played a consistent game at left end
for the All-Stars. Nevers' team had
not been together nearly as long as
the Bears, and reports from the game
! show that it can be expected to show
| some great football after another
! week's practice.
Nevers has the hdppy combination
! of being both a pitcher and a slugger,
| and his work at the bat and in the
J box has been a large factor in the
j Cardinals' baseball victories the past
i two years.
Both the New York Giants and the
j Cincinnati Reds have sent agents to
; make contracts with Nevers, but when
| he left here for the East he stated that
he would sign with no club until next
year, when he is through with foot
ball. This sudden reversal of his deci
sion would point out that he does not
! consider there % as much of a future
for him in football as in baseball.
Bill Lauge, of the Giants, was the
i first to approach Nevers on the sub
i ject of a contract, and had in mind to
use him as a pitcher, or possibly to
; shift him to the outfield, where his
hitting could be used. But at that time
i Nevers did not seriously, consider the
| proposition.
