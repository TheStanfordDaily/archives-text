# CARDS MEET FAST SOUTHERN BRANCH QUINTEI TONIGHT
## VARSITY IN GOOD SHAPE Grizzlies Expected to Give Stanford Five First Test of Season 
### Al Post 
Stanford's varsity basketball team
will get its first real test tonight when
it goes against the strong quintet from
the University of California, Southern
Branch. The game starts in the pa
vilion at 8 o'clock sharp. There will
be no preliminary.
Coach Andy Kerr will probably start
the following line-up: Price and Rupe,
forwards; Jayred. center; Mitchell and
Anderson, guards. This combination
defeated the Stockton Amblers Club
by a 35 to 20 score in Stockton Satur
day night.
David May Start
There is a possibility that David
will be at one of the forward posi
tions instead of Rupe when the con
test opens. Both men have been going
well in practice, and Kerr will not de
cide until the last minute. Anderson
has an edge over Newhouse at stand
ing guard. Newhouse has been report
ing regularly for practice, but there is
a question as to his eligibility.
In addition to the victory over the
Amblers, the Cards trounced the San
Jose High School Alumni five twice
during vacation, 17 to 13 and 29 to G.
In the first game only second-string
men were used, but in the second con
test, held last Wednesday, most of the
regulars saw action.
Grizzlies Have Speed
The Cards have been coming along
in good shape, but will have to show
plenty of class to beat the Grizzlies.
The Branch players come north with
a 32 to 22 win over O. A. C. under
tlieir belts, and are reported to have
a lot of speed. Stanford was hard
pressed to defeat the Branch five 23
to 17 last year, the Grizzlies holding
the lead for the first ten minutes. The
Branch is pointing at tonight's game,
and at a return engagement which will
be played in Los Angeles February 5.

All members of the varsity squad
are back at practice except Ted Ship
key, who is expected to report today,
and Kerr will experiment tonight in
order to discover the combination
which works smoothest. The game
should be fast, full of action, and one
well worth seeing.
