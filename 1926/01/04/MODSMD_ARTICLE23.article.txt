# Stanford Stars and Pro Football
## 
### 
Since the last issue of the Daily Palo Alto, Ernie Nevers grasped
the golden apple offered by professional football, and soon after Jim Law
son and Harry Shipkey announced that they also would play the profes
sional game. When "Red" Grange left Illinois to play with the Chicago
Bears, the Daily expressed an editorial opinion that football should be
kept clean for college enthusiasts. In stating this view Grange's action
was looked upon as being unfair and, in the long run, detrimental to the
best interests of college football. Now that Stanford players have ac
cepted the same proposition, the Daily feels it necessary to explain its
stand in regard to their action.
When the first editorial was written it was not known how popular
Grange would be in his new role. He had merely signed the contract and
announced that he was through with school for the time being. Since then
he has drawn capacity crowds, signed movie contracts, and garnered big
checks for the use of his name and face in advertising. All of lis must eat,
and anyone would be foolish to be willing to starve for an ideal—there
fore events subsequent to the first editorial have shown that Grange was
acting to his best personal interests when he signed with the Bears.
Nevers found himself in much the same position. He didn't have any
thing and his prospects for high salaries immediately after leaving college
were not particularly bright, unless he turned his athletic ability into cash.
..Therefore, he balanced the scales—found that financial remuneration out
weighed the disadvantages of aiding professional football—and joined the
Jacksonville team. He was acting rationally. The Daily Palo Alto
does not commend his action any more than it did that of Grange, but it
does feel that individuals are wise when they turn professional upon being
offered huge sums for so doing, particularly if they need the money. Those
who are forced to turn professional for financial reasons are not to be
blamed, but professional football as an institution is bad and detrimental
to college athletics, Hugh Fullerton to the contrary, and the Daily Palo
Alto will continue to carry nationwide comment and views to that effect.
