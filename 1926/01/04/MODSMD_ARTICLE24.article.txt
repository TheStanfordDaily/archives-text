# 1926
## 
### 
The year 1925 having passed gracefuly into history and 1926 having
entered the scene with a dignity broken only by loud "huzzas" from the
Rose Bowl in Pasadena, it devolved upon sundry millions to make annual
New Year's resolutions 011 January 1.
Today being January 4, we are listening for the crash "heard 'round the
world" of many resolutions being discarded for the remaining 361 days.
Of course there are always a number of our "sundry millions" who put
their resolutions on their desk in front of them for religious observance
rather than 011 a shelf behind them to be just as religiously forgotten. All
praise to these worthy and conscientious souls !
As for Stanford's participation in this game of New Year's resolutions
—Ho hum. We imagine "Pop" Warner has resolved to beat California
again; that "Dink" Templeton says "ditto"; that Andy Kerr exclaims—
"ditto"—without that word 'again'; and that Harry Wolters lines up with
the others. And for the rank and file of those attending the institution,
we see the following in store: various resolutions as to study, work, etc.,
observed varying lengths of time; repeated reminders that checks should
be dated "1926" and not "1925"; and belated Christmas and New Year's
cards.
Which leaves us with the feeling that the passing of the old year and
the beginning of the new is as the difference between Tweedle and Tweedle
dum—a matter of individual taste and recognition.
And also just as important.
