# New Tryouts
## 
### 
Although seVeral positions are open on the reportorial staff of the
Daily Palo Alto, these will not be filled this quarter by formal tryouts
as in the past. Instead it is requested that all persons desiring to work on
the paper report to the office of the editor any day this week between the
hours of 1 and 3p. m. for a conference. Those who give promise of be
ing of assistance to the paper will be given an opportunity to display their
worth, and will be taken on the staff without further preliminaries.
Upperclassmen who are planning to do newspaper work on completion
of their college course will find the work on the Daily highly beneficial
and may receive staff positions; it is pointed out, however, that if one
wishes to attain an executive position it is essential that he start working
when an underclassman. Freshmen with or without past experience are
especially requested to report.

AN ANONYMOUS CONTRIBUTOR to the Daily Palo Alto
has suggested that in future years the freshmen gather wood for the annual
Big Game bonfire, but that they distribute it to the poor in Palo Alto in
stead of burning California's pyre with it after the rally. Although the
Daily does not print anonymous communications, this letter is being held,
and will be printed upon receipt of the author's name.
