# Rating Sororities
## 
### 
Comparative ratings of all sororities have been made at Syracuse Uni
versity. An activity point system is used and the organization is given
points for the participation of its members in campus activities. Mere
membership in an organization does not carry activity points with it, but
a cabinet position or committee work is necessary.
This is an extension of the point system idea under discussion by the
Women's Athletic Association. We admit that the point system as ap
plied to individuals is good, but cannot see any possible good to come from
rating the organizations by its individuals, and then publishing that rating.
It can only create dissention and jealousy.
