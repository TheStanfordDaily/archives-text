# CZAR'S WAR PLANS REVEALED IN NOTES OF 1914 MINISTRY
## 
### 
Russia did not help precipitate the
Great War, according to evidence con
tained in the minutes of a Russian
Ministry meeting held July 24, 1914.
The translation of this document,
which has been in the possession of
the Hoover War library for some
time, has just been completed by Rob
ert C. Binkley, reference librarian.

Instead of urging Serbian resistance
to the Austrian ultimatum, according
to these minutes, the Russian govern
ment tried to smooth matters over,
urging that Serbia should not resort
to arms. Co-operation with other Euro
pean powers to ask that Austria grant
Serbia a longer time to consider the
demands was also suggested.
France Absolved
Stanford historians say that the
document also inferentially absolves
France of complicity in a plot to start
a war. They argue that since Russia
was not planning to force war, France
could hardly have been participating
in a plot to do so. The accusation has
been made during the last ten years
because French government heads, in
cluding Viviani, had been in confer
ence with Russian ministers at St.
Petersburg (now Leiningrad) until the
day before the Austro-Serbian crisis. |
In a council meeting on July 25, the j
document indicates, the Czar approved j
the actions of the previous day and j
concurred in the decision to organize j
the country to meet war conditions if
necessary.
Minutes Copies Scarce
The minutes of the council meeting,
form part of a large, heavily bound!
volume of ministerial records obtained â– 
in Russia for the Hoover War library, i
It is believed that no other copies are j
to be obtained in Russia now, and j
whether there are any in existence is j
not known. The report of this particu
lar day is in mimeographed form, as
are some of the others, but most of
them are printed.
Among the shipments recently re
ceived by the Hoover library are
eighteen cases of material from Rus
sia and large collections from Finland
and Esthonia. None of these have
been opened yet.
