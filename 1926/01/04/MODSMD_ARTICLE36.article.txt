# CARDINAL SWIMMING STARS WILL ENTER P.A.A. TITLE RACES
## 
### 
Arden Allen, varsity breaststroke
swimmer, will participate in the 220-
yard Pacific Association junior breast
stroke hcampionship in the Olympic
Club pool next Sunday night, and Carl
Stevenson, middle distance swimmer,
will enter the 150-yard back-stroke
event. Both men will swim unattached,
as the University authorities will not
permit Stanford athletes to wear the
Cardinal color in Sunday competition.
Allen will meet Leonard Willis of
the San Jose High School Alumni Club
with whom he tied in a race held here
a few months ago. Both are out to
assert their supremacy, so the race
promises to be a good one.
Minnow Stevenson will meet some
stiff competition in Walton, Hargraves,
Mooney, and DeSilva of the Olympic
Club, but he has proved himself capa
ble of swimming with the best of them,
and can be counted on to provide a
good race.

Because their football team beat
Harvard, freshmen of Princeton are
permitted to attend the movies on
week nights for the rest of the year.
At Indiana university the first
Wednesday of each month is set aside
for the exchange of dinner guests by
sororities.
