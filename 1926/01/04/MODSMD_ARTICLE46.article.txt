# SPORTS OF 1925
## Great Punters 
### "FEG" MURRAY,'16 
Every football coach prays for a good punter, for without such a man his
team is severely handicapped. Field H. Yost of Michgan was biassed in 1921,
*22, and '23 with Harry Kipke, one of the greatest punters of all time. There
have been kickers who have gotten more distance than Kipke, but never any
who could control the ball with more accuracy. Harry was one of those who
succeeded through perseverance. He used to practice punting hours each
day during the summer months, and so was able to place his kicks wherever
he wanted when football season came around.
Shades of Hirschberger and Pat O'Dea, but you should see this boy "Dink"
Templeton boot a football! I'll wager there never lived a man who, if given
his time, could kick a spiral further. "Dink" is now track coach at Stanford
University, and can, each fall, easily outkick any man on the football team.
And that goes for big Ernie Nevers, too, who, in the game with Southern
California recently, averaged over fifty yards on eleven punts.
Templeton, when they played Rugby o nthe coast, kicked an 82-yard punt,
the ball landing about 15 feet up in the bleacher seats. In 1919, against St.
Mary's (this in intercollegiate football), he kicked a punt that landed 80 yards
from the place it left his toe. Templeton also kicked a 72-yard punt against
Oregon in 1920.
Bill Wood of the Army team last year, Archie Nisbet of California in *21
and '22, and Sonnenberg of Dartmouth rank high among the fine punters of
recent years, and Doug Wyckoff of Georgie Tech stands out among the men
now playing. I saw Wyckoff kick the ball 73 yards on the carry against an
icy gale at the Yankee Stadium earl yin October. It was a remarkable kick.
