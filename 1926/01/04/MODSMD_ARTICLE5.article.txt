# SIXTEEN LETTERMEN FORM NUCLEUS FOR 1926 TRACK SQUAD
## Loss of Hartranft, Leistner, Leaves Big Gap; First Workout Monday 
### Murray Draper 
Sixteen Block "S" men will report to
Coach Dink Templeton next Monday
afternoon for the first regular track work
out of the 1926 season. In addition to
these lettermen, a host of likely candi- j
dates from the '28 frosh team will be on
hand, and chances for another successful
season for the Stanford trackmen are con
sidered good.
The track season will get under way
February 27, when the Irish Marathon will
be held. The following Saturday the
interclass meet will be held, and thereafter
the Cards will meet the Olympic Club,
U.S.C., University of Oregon, and Cali
fornia on the stadium track. One meet
i will be held away from home, when the
| team travels to Los Angeles to meet a rep- ;
resentative team of the Southern Cali
fornia Conference. Dates for these tilts
have not yet been definitely set.
Conference Meet Here
The Pacific Coast Conference meet will
be held here this year, contrary to the usual
custom of holding it at some northern in-'
stitution.
Stanford's prospects this season are not'
so good as at this time last year, but there j
are possibilities of development which if j
'fulfilled may make the team fully as strong
I as former winning aggregations.
Loss of Stars Felt
The loss of two outstanding stars of
! the 1925' team, Captain Tiny Hartranft
! and Swede Leistner, will be keenly felt.
! Hartranft, a consistent winner in the shot
and discus, will be replaced by Biff Hoff-
I man, whose discus work is on a par with
j that of Tiny, and who is showing strong
'development in tl)e shot. The loss of
| Leistner is perhaps the greater, since there
| is no outstanding varsity man to step into
! his place in the hurdle events. Ross
| Nichols, captain of the '28 frosh; Bud
| Spencer, interscholastic low hurdle win
iner; and Wells and Heston of last year's
[ squad are all likely hurdlers.
The half and quarter are well taken
j care of again this year by Captain Bill
Richardson and Ted Miller, respectively.
; Miller will probably be entered in the;
; half-mile event in early meets, and if he j
; does well will run both the 440 and 880 j
j throughout the season.
Varsity Men Listed
Bill Kerr in the mile; Storie, Doerr, and [
j Babcock in the 440 and relay; Gaspar in j
i the sprints; Ross and Schofield in the pole 1
J vault; Ted Shipkey in the javelin; Rich-!
| ards in the weights; Work and Muhs in 1
j the high jump; and Cruickshank and!
j Meeks in the broad jump, make up the!
list of varsity performers who will com
pete ttys season.
Coach Templeton is now planning to
point his men for the U.S.C. meet, which
will be held here about the time of Easter i
i vacation. Stanford is not figured to be |
on a par with the southern tracksters atj
the present time, and considerable work
will be necessary if the Cards expect to
make the meet a close one. After this
contest work for the California struggle
will begin. This year's Big Meet will
| probably be held April 17.
