# REGISTRATION FOR NEW STUDY PLAN OPENS THIS TERM
## REGISTRAR HAS BLANKS Upperclassmen With Superior Scholastic Averages Eligible to Enroll 
### 
,
Students who wish to enroll for the In
dependent Study Plan during the present
1 quarter should do so this week. Applica
| tion blanks may be secured from the Reg
j istrar's office and must be approved by
! the students' major department before be
| ing presented to the Committee on Inde
j pendent Study.
j Applications will be considered from
i students of junior or senior standing who
! by high grade point standing or other in
j dications show superior fitness. After the
• current academic year the latest date at
which enrollment will be permitted is at
the beginning of the senior year.
Departments which have adopted the
Independent Study Plan include the Edu
cation, English, Germanic Languages,
History, Mining and Metallurgy, Phil
osophy, Physics, Political Science, Psy
chology ,and Romanic Languages. The
School of Biology is also using the plan.
Professor Lewis M. Terman, chairman
of the Committee on Independent Study,
in discussing the new plan said, "The In
dependent Study Plan is a challenge to
the student of exceptional ability who is
willing to put forth greater efforts for
correspondingly greater benefits. From
| the first grade up ,education is too largely
confined to lesson selling and lesson
hearing.
"The result is that a passive attitude is
developed in the student, which is pretty
; well ingrained by the time he graduates
! from high school. Too many go to col
| lege expecting to "soak up" their educa
. tion instead of getting it by any very
! active process. The Independent Study
' Plan is for those who wish actively to pur- j
sue an education and to educate them-!
j selves under the intimate guidance of a j
I few chosen teachers.
j "It puts the emphasis on self activity 1
; rather than on memorization of texts and
i lectures. The student is given greater
| responsibility in the management of his
| time and the distribution of effort.
j "The work is laid out in large blocks
j rather than in set courses. The boundary
. lines between departments and subjects are
| disregarded in the pursuit of a goal."
