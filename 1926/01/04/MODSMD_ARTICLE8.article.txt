' ended rather disastrously for the
1 Babes, although no final score was
; kept.
The first scheduled game for the
freshmen will be against the Palo
Alto high school team in the pavilion
J Saturday night. Palo Alto is accorded
1 a strong team and has scored a de
l cisive win over Sequoia high.
Two of Hunt's best men were lost

man in the southern high school con
! ference last season and was expected
\ to star on the freshman five.
Intensive practice will start today

I picked by Hunt and many changes will
