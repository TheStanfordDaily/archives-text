In opposition to those who believe
that forest conservation should begin
; with the abolition of Christmas trees,
i Professor Woodbridge Metcalf of the
forestry division of the University of j
California urges that people should
; grow Christmas trees in home gar
dens and community forests.
"The damage caused by Christmas
tree cutting is infinitesimal compared j
to the loss of trees by fire," said Pro- J
fessor Metcalf. "When fire prevention j
lis made a reality in the important j
1 forest areas, Christmas trees will be
plentiful and conservation of them
j will not be necessary."
