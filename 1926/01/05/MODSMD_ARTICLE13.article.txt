# WINTER QUARTER REGISTRATION SETS NEW HIGH RECORD
## Total Enrollment Will Almost Reach Figure of Last Autumn Session 
### 
All records for winter quarter regis
trations were broken yesterday, when
2921 completed their registration for
1 the coming quarter. Thirty-four more
who started registering yesterday will
! complete their enrollment today,
which will bring the total for the first
| two days up to 2955.
Not only is the total registration
larger, but the enrollment for the first
; day is larger than any previous regis-
I tration for a whole winter quarter.
| Last year 267S came in the first day,
â–  with forty-six completing their regis-1
tration the next day. At the end of
| that quarter there was a total regis- \
tration of 2585, including all those
who had registered at any time during j
! the quarter, some of whom took out
I (leaves of absence.
The increase during the quarter last i
j winter amounted to 161. Allowing for
the same approximate increase during
this quarter, the total enrollment
' should come to over 3000, which will
not only eclipse all previous winter
registrations, but will come close to 1
equalling the registrations for last au
tumn quarter, which was .3138. This '
i will be an unusual situation, for as a j
rule the winter registration falls con- 1
siderably below that of the previous
autumn quarter.
Eighty-six new students registered \
yesterday, as compared with 75 the j
year before.
