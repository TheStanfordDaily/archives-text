# MANY OUT FOR 1929 BASKETBALL SQUAD
## 
### 
Many additional men turned out for
places 011 the 1929 basketball team,
when students returning for registra
tion started practicing with the squad
of fifteen which have been working
under Coach Hunt since December 28.
A cut will me made shortly, after all
of the candidates have been given a
chance to show their ability.
"The material this year," said Coach
Husky Hunt, "does not seem to com
pare with the material that the last
two freshman teams have had. Al
though a large squad has turned out,
it is too big to handle properly, and no
men have shown any extraordinary
basketball ability. Some severe cuts
will have to be made, so that the
squad may be reduced to a workable
size, and that serious practice can be
opened for the regular season. About
fifteen men will be carried on the
squad."
