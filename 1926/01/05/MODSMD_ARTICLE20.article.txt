# LOOSELY PLAYING CARDINALS FALL BEFORE GRIZZLIES 28-15
## Air-Tight Defense, Brilliant Shooting Gives Branch Quintet Victory 
### James Adams 
A loosely playing Stanford five fell
to defeat before a team from the
Southern Branch of the University of
California, which was well drilled in
co-ordination and teamwork, last night
i;; the pavilion, by a score of 28 to 15.
That sums up the situation in a few
words except that it should also be
mentioned that on the Grizzly team
was a young man named Ketchum. He
was well named.
The Cards were prevented from
getting many shots at the basket by
the excellent guarding of the South
erners and failed to make good the
few opportunities offered them. On the
other hand, the Branch five scored
frequently at the end of brilliant
spurts of teamwork by which they
carried the ball down to shooting dis
tance. Ketchum was the ringleader in
the point-gathering department, mak
ing six field goals for a total of 12
points.
Grizzly Defense Strong
A defense by the Grizzlies which al
lowed only a few shots and which
made those difficult and hurried kept
down the score of the Stanford team.
At the start Jayred looked as if he
had his eye on the basket but he had
so few shots that he soon lost it. No
cne else on the team had the range
at all. Price played a stellar floor
game but shot only one field goal.
Seven of the Cards' fifteen points
were made on free throws, which fact
indicates the effectiveness of the
Southerners' guarding.

Armstrong and Bresee form a clever
guarding combination. They both seem
to have an uncanny ability to antici
pate their opponents' passes and to

be there when the ball is passed.
Time and again they mussed up the
Stanford offense before it got under
way by nailing the ball in midfloor.
Once a Stanford man got hold of the
ball one of these two fastened on him
like a leech. For Stanford, Anderson
played a splendid game at standing
guard. His guarding and getting the
ball from off the backboard held down
the Grizzly score to a respectable size.
Kerr changed his combinations
many times but failed to find one that
could stop the Grizzlies. Rupe started
