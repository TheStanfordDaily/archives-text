# LOOSELY PLAYING CARDINALS FALL BEFORE GRIZZLIES 28-15
## Air-Tight Defense, Brilliant Shooting Gives Branch Quintet Victory 
### James Adams 
A loosely playing Stanford five fell
to defeat before a team from the
Southern Branch of the University of
California, which was well drilled in
co-ordination and teamwork, last night
i;; the pavilion, by a score of 28 to 15.
That sums up the situation in a few
words except that it should also be
mentioned that on the Grizzly team
was a young man named Ketchum. He
was well named.
The Cards were prevented from
getting many shots at the basket by
the excellent guarding of the South
erners and failed to make good the
few opportunities offered them. On the
other hand, the Branch five scored
frequently at the end of brilliant
spurts of teamwork by which they
carried the ball down to shooting dis
tance. Ketchum was the ringleader in
the point-gathering department, mak
ing six field goals for a total of 12
points.
Grizzly Defense Strong
A defense by the Grizzlies which al
lowed only a few shots and which
made those difficult and hurried kept
down the score of the Stanford team.
At the start Jayred looked as if he
had his eye on the basket but he had
so few shots that he soon lost it. No
cne else on the team had the range
at all. Price played a stellar floor
game but shot only one field goal.
Seven of the Cards' fifteen points
were made on free throws, which fact
indicates the effectiveness of the
Southerners' guarding.

Armstrong and Bresee form a clever
guarding combination. They both seem
to have an uncanny ability to antici
pate their opponents' passes and to

be there when the ball is passed.
Time and again they mussed up the
Stanford offense before it got under
way by nailing the ball in midfloor.
Once a Stanford man got hold of the
ball one of these two fastened on him
like a leech. For Stanford, Anderson
played a splendid game at standing
guard. His guarding and getting the
ball from off the backboard held down
the Grizzly score to a respectable size.
Kerr changed his combinations
many times but failed to find one that
could stop the Grizzlies. Rupe started
at forward but was soon relieved by
David, who has been out of practice
for some time because of an injured
wrist. David stuck close to Ketchum
and kept him from shooting but missed
a good many baskets himself. Jayred
tired a little after the first half, and
Rupe was sent in to take his place.
Shipkey was substituted for Mitchell
for awhile, but the latter was sent
back in and seemed to handle the job
the better of the two. Clark and Bry
ant went in towards the end of the
game but didn't show the form that
Price and David .displayed.
The Branch five kept up the fast
pace they set at the start throughout
the whole game. Their playing was
marked by splendid teamwork, fast
and accurate passing, close guarding,
and good shooting. That almost meets
the requirements of the perfect team.
They were in fact the best-coached
five that has appeared on the Stanford
court for a number of years.
The passing of the Stanford team
was neither accurate nor sure. The
ball was snatched from (heir hands
many times as a result of their jug
gling method of receiving passes.
The summary is as follows:
Stanford (15) S. B. U. C. (28)
Price (3) F Goertz (2)
Rupe (2) F Ketchum (12)
Jayred (4) C Prigge (9)
Mitchell (4) G Armstrong (2)
Anderson (1) G Bresee (3)
Substitutions for Stanford: David
(1), Shipkey, Bryant; for 5.8. U.C.:
Bunche, Freuhling, Pierce, Blum.

A folk dancing contest was held at
1T.C.5.8. for any of the women of the
university interested in dancing. Each
contestant presented three required
dances and one original one.

Twenty-five students of lowa Wes
leyan University have decided to cease
shaving until the football team of that
institution wins a game.
A loosely playing Stanford five fell
to defeat before a team from the
Southern Branch of the University of
California, which was well drilled in
co-ordination and teamwork, last night
i;; the pavilion, by a score of 28 to 15.
That sums up the situation in a few
words except that it should also be
mentioned that on the Grizzly team
was a young man named Ketchum. He
was well named.
The Cards were prevented from
getting many shots at the basket by
the excellent guarding of the South
erners and failed to make good the
few opportunities offered them. On the
other hand, the Branch five scored
frequently at the end of brilliant
spurts of teamwork by which they
carried the ball down to shooting dis
tance. Ketchum was the ringleader in
the point-gathering department, mak
ing six field goals for a total of 12
points.
Grizzly Defense Strong
A defense by the Grizzlies which al
lowed only a few shots and which
made those difficult and hurried kept
down the score of the Stanford team.
At the start Jayred looked as if he
had his eye on the basket but he had
so few shots that he soon lost it. No
cne else on the team had the range
at all. Price played a stellar floor
game but shot only one field goal.
Seven of the Cards' fifteen points
were made on free throws, which fact
indicates the effectiveness of the
Southerners' guarding.

Armstrong and Bresee form a clever
guarding combination. They both seem
to have an uncanny ability to antici
pate their opponents' passes and to

be there when the ball is passed.
Time and again they mussed up the
Stanford offense before it got under
way by nailing the ball in midfloor.
Once a Stanford man got hold of the
ball one of these two fastened on him
like a leech. For Stanford, Anderson
played a splendid game at standing
guard. His guarding and getting the
ball from off the backboard held down
the Grizzly score to a respectable size.
Kerr changed his combinations
many times but failed to find one that
could stop the Grizzlies. Rupe started
at forward but was soon relieved by
David, who has been out of practice
for some time because of an injured
wrist. David stuck close to Ketchum
and kept him from shooting but missed
a good many baskets himself. Jayred
tired a little after the first half, and
Rupe was sent in to take his place.
Shipkey was substituted for Mitchell
for awhile, but the latter was sent
back in and seemed to handle the job
the better of the two. Clark and Bry
ant went in towards the end of the
game but didn't show the form that
Price and David .displayed.
The Branch five kept up the fast
pace they set at the start throughout
the whole game. Their playing was
marked by splendid teamwork, fast
and accurate passing, close guarding,
and good shooting. That almost meets
the requirements of the perfect team.
They were in fact the best-coached
five that has appeared on the Stanford
court for a number of years.
The passing of the Stanford team
was neither accurate nor sure. The
ball was snatched from (heir hands
many times as a result of their jug
gling method of receiving passes.
The summary is as follows:
Stanford (15) S. B. U. C. (28)
Price (3) F Goertz (2)
Rupe (2) F Ketchum (12)
Jayred (4) C Prigge (9)
Mitchell (4) G Armstrong (2)
