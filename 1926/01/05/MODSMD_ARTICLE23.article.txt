# Nebraska's Schedule Causes Trouble
## 
### 
The University of Oklahoma, after being dropped from the Nebraska
grid schedule for next year, has come forward with charges that the Corn
huskers are trying to arrange an "easy" schedule, whereby they will be en
abled to win the Missouri Valley Conference, of which both are members,
with ease and comparative safety. Nebraska has arranged for five con
ference tilts, four of them to be played on the home field. Drake, Mis
souri, lowa State, Kansas Aggies, and Kansas are the aggregations which
will clash with the Lincoln eleven.
When a conference is made up of a number of powerful teams and a
few relatively weak ones, it seems only right that the strong teams arrange
to play each other every season, in order that there will be no argument
after the season ends as to which University really had the most powerful
outfit. This is one thing that has been admirable about the Stanford
schedules for the last few years —the Cards have scheduled games with
U.S.C., Washington, and California regularly, and have been fortunate
enough to be meeting Idaho and O.A.C. the years in which they were con
sidered real contenders for the title. Then, at the end of the schedule the
Redshirts have known that other teams were stronger, where they might
have laid claim to the title had they played only the second group of
elevens. Perhaps it is hard to take a defeat but it gives more satisfaction
to everyone concerned to know that your team has played, every strong
team in the conference race.
Whether or not the Oklahoma charges are correct is questionable.
Nebraska also has games with Notre Dame and Washington, which can
hardly be called set-ups. Probably Oklahoma has some misunderstanding
over the Cornhuskers' action, but whatever the conflict may be in the
Valley conference, the members of the Pacific Coast conference can profit
by the lesson to be observed from Oklahoma's trouble with Nebraska.
