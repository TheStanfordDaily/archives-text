# A 						College Type

"It is our duty in college to disregard the individual and turn out a
Trinity type" was the astonishing statement made by the Dean of Trinity
College of Hartford, Conn., in a chapel address a few weeks ago. The
editor of the college paper, who ventured to disagree somewhat radically
with the opinion expressed by the Dean, was promptly suspended from
the college for a month.
That a man advocating standardization of the individual should be in
a position of authority in a present day college of recognized standing
comes as a surprise to us. and seems to be truly unfortunate for those who
must look to him for guidance. Those who are opposed to fraternities
declare that the average fraternity tends to turn out a uniform type of in
dividual—but that is hard to prove—and there only a group of twenty or
thirty is involved. How it could be possible for a college to turn out sev
eral hundred students a year as like as two peas in a pod is hard to conceive,
and it is certainly a condition that has never been noticeable at Stanford.

Men students at West Virginia Wesleyan, when asked the qualifica
tions for the "ideal girl," decided that a pleasing personality was the prin
cipal charm necessary. Health, sense, and education were frequently
named, but not a man thought she should be the most beautiful woman in
the world. And some day these same men will find themselves marrying
their "ideal girl" without being able to find a single one of their carefully
considered characteristics predominant.

All staff members of the Daily Palo Alto and last quarter's tryoutees
will be expected to attend the meeting to be held in the Daily Palo Alto
offiice at 1:15 o'clock tomorrow afternoon. Those not present will be
dropped from the staff.
