# E. ROBERT SCHMITZ WILL PLAY IN SECOND PENINSULA RECITAL
## 
### 
E. Robert Schmitz, noted pianist,
will give a concert in the Assembly
hall January 14 as the second event of
the Peninsula Concert Series. Schmitz
is a graduate of the Paris Conserva
tory of Music, where he won a first
prize for his piano playing. In Europe
he is known as a conductor as well as
a pianist. He founded and led a Pari
sian orchestra that still bears his
name. He has been a personal friend
of many modern composers and pio
neered in presenting their work to the
public. He was the first interpreter of
the compositions of Debussy in Ger
many and England and has numbered
among his personal friendships such
men as D'lndy, Dukas, Ravel, and Stra
vinsky.
His Bach-Debussy concert, given in
the Scottish Rite Hall of New York
early this season was well received.
He plays the same program in his re
cital in San Francisco today. Later
in January he will lecture on "The
Modernists of Russia and Germany"
as part of the Ida Scott Gregory fort
nightly series of lectures.
The first Peninsula concert was held
last November with Anna Case, so
prano, as soloist. Two more concerts
are scheduled by the Peninsula Music
Association after the Schmitz recital.
Tickets may be obtained at the Stan
ford Bookstore or Crandall's.
"Too little sleep, too much play, not
enough study, too much leisure, fast
eating, and diversified thinking are
factors that devitalize students and
are responsible for the delinquent
groups in every university," is the
conclusion reached by Professor How
ard of Northwestern University.
