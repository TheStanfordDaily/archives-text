"Like Northwestern, it is a private
institution and chooses and picks its
student body. Registration is limited
to 3000, and no more than 500 women
are allowed to enroll. Average scholar

but it is 110 better than that of our
good students," Professor Cox further

The quarter system is explained by
Professor Cox as being more intensive
than the semester system, while the
