# TEAM HAS TWO HEADS
## 
### 
Notre Dame has two football cap
tains for next season. In the election
for captain of next year's eleven, Half
back Thomas Hearndon and Quarter
back Eugene Edwards were tied for
the position. Both will act as captain,
but they will not take the field at the
same time.
Silk stockings for freshman girls
have been banned on the West Vir
ginia University campus by the Stu
dent' Council. The council has changed
the style of hosiery for the first-year
girls to plain black cotton. Freshman
boys likewise adopted black cotton
hose in compliance with the freshman
code.
