# PROFESSOR AND MRS. FERRIS COLLECT PLANTS DIFFICULTIES EXPERIENCED IN CROSSING MEXICO COCKY GENDARME PICKS ON STANFORD PROF
## 
### 
Rare Mexican plants are among the |
4,000 specimens recently added to the j
Dudley Herbarium by Mrs. Gordon F. j
Ferris, who has just returned to Stanford:
from a trip through the most perilous
parts of Mexico with her husband and a
party of botanists. Professor Ferris has
been in Mexico for some time and re
mained there when Mrs. Ferris came back
to the campus.
Tres Marias, a group of little-known
islands just off the southwestern coast of
Mexico, were the chief points of explor
ation, particularly the island of Maria
Madre.on which the Mexican penal colony
is located. The trip to this island was
made during the season of cyclones. On
returning from Maria Madre they nar
rowly missed being caught in one of these
"Chubascos," which often cause a great
deal of havoc along the coast.
The penal island they found to be very
well conducted; the prisoners seemed con
tented and all turned out to entertain the
visitors with a rodeo. The party was con
ducted about the island by a "trusty," Joe
Garza, who told them he had been arrested
merely for being with a man wanted by
the police, and had been sent to the island
without trial or sentence.
The collectors confined their efforts
mostly to trips which other Americans
had not dared. In spite of the fact that a
customs collector had been held up the
night before, Professor and Mrs. Ferris,
with Miss McClcllan and their "mozo,"
liikcd from San Bias to 'i epic, i lie trip
was made with no more discomfort than
having to sleep in a banana field infested
with mosquitoes, and being chilled with
the cold morning damp.

From Topic to Guadalajara the party
used both mule and automobile. The first
day their car averaged some five miles an
hour of boisterous jouncing. However,
the last leg of the trip was taken in a Hud
son, and, though bedraggled and car-sore,
they found it much the speedier method.
To prove that Americans are not the only
people who do not trust the Mexicans one
lias only to take the train from Colima to
Manzanillo as the Ferris' did in their first
Mexican train ride. Each inspector and
conductor must re-punch and re-check all
the work of his predecessors, so that when
one arrives at his destination his ticket is
something like the hole of a doughnut.
â€¢ "I have become hardened to anything the
American tourist may do," was the re
mark that a Guadalajara hotel man made,
but I have often been mortified." This
statement is typical of the Mexican atti
tude toward the tourists from the United
Suites, Mrs. Ferris discovered. In the
hotel in Manzanillfc the party was noisily
disturbed by a horde of the tourists rush
ing into the dining room and demanding
tortillos, beer, and tequila all in the same
breath, and rushing around like a mob of
school boys.
Professor Ferris had some varied ex
periences before the rest of the party ar
rived. One was being held up out in the
country, but he recovered the $50 that was
stolen. Another time he had the experi
ence of seeing a coiled-up cobra in the bed
of the superintendent of the hacienda he
was staying. It had playfully been put
there by an employe who was not on good
terms with the boss. Once, the professor
was arrested in a little town by a cocky
young gendarme, but unluckily for the cop
the prisoner was known to the mayor of
the town, and the "flatfoot" received a
carpet-call and lost a day's wages.
