ance of Wilde's fa
mous farcical sa
tire will be its first
presentation here
by Stanford actors
in fifteen years, and

will substitute for
Gordon Davis the faculty play
which was sched
uled to take place on this date. Owing
to the rush of the Christmas season, j
the faculty could not continue work !
011 the play, and since it is to be a '
benefit performance, local actors and 1
students combined to make up a cast |
of unusual talent.
Miss Margaret Davis will make her '
first appearance on the Stanford stage !
in the role of Cecily Cardew, playing !
opposite her brother, Gordon Davis. j
Between Davis and Charles Parks,
who takes the part of John Worthing, !
Barbara Wellington and Miss Davis,
most of the bandinage for which i
Wilde is known takes place.
Miss Corey plays Lady Braehwell,!
and has been prominent in Palo Alto j
dramatics for several years. She is a ;
Stanford graduate, and took part in j
Junior Operas and in "The Charm
School" while an undergraduate. Mrs. '
Huston is remembered for her clever
characterization which made such a
hit in last year's production of "The ;
Torchbearers," the faculty play. As
Miss Prism she has another attractive
character part which shows her versa- j
tility as an actress. Miss Wellington
is a graduate who was active in dra
matics while a student in the Uni
versity.
Students in "The Importance of Be-1
ing Earnest" include Parks, without j
whom no cast seems complete nowa
days, and Jack Wiggin and Gregory
Williamson as the two servants, Lane
and Merriman.
