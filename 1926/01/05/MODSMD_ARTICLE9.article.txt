# FIRST EARNESTS AT SEAT RUSH TO RATE FREE PASTEBOARDS
## 
### 
As proof that there really is im
portance in being Earnest, the Dra
matic Council has decided to give
two free tickets apiece to the first
three men in line for the ticket
sale of "The Importance of Being
Earnest" tomorrow noon who pre
sent student body tickets to guar
antee that their names are Earnest.
With Nevers definitely out of the
running by his absence, the chances
for the rest of the Earnests to fight
their way to the front without
casualties seems fairly safe.
Wilde's play to be produced Fri
day evening will further back up
the action of the Dramatic Council
as to the importance of being earn
est, for the brilliant wit stoops to
punning 011 the word "Earnest"
throughout the drama.
