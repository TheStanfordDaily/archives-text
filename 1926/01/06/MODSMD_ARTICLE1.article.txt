# MAJORITY FAVORS WORLD COURT AT STUDENT MEETING
## LEWIS TELLS OF PLANS National Federation Formed; Delegates Attend From 250 Colleges 
### 
The endorsing of the World Court i
and the formation of the National
Students' Federation were the chief!
results of the National World Court i
Conference held at Princeton Univer-1
sity from which Robert E. Lewis, i
president of associated students, and !
one of the Stanford delegates, has just
returned.
The World Court was approved by ,
a count of , 244 to 5, those opposed to j
it being among the smaller colleges :
represented. A resolution was sent to j
the President expressing the confer- j
ence's view of the matter.. Two hun
dred and fifty colleges were repre
sented at the conference by 275 of
ficial delegates. There were also many
people who attended in order to hear
the debates and discussions.
The National Students' Federation
■was formed at the final meeting of
the conference as a permanent or
ganization. An executive committee :
consisting of the officers, and two dele
gates from each section of the coun- j
try, will be the governing body. The :
next meeting has been set for Novem
ber 1927 at the University of Michi- j
gan. The purpose of the organization !
is to enable college students to act as j
a body on matters closely affecting
academic life, as well as to enable;
them to voice their opinions on nation- j
al and international affairs.
Other matters brought up were an
tagonism between student bodies and j
faculties, athletics including profes
sionalism, paid coaches, intersectional
games, scholarships, and the part of,
students in determining the curriculum
of a university.
"The federation has a great future," |
declared Robert Lewis, "if they start j
out their program with care. There are
similar organizations in Europe, j
though they are of a more political
nature, and it is a natural step for- 1
ward for the United States to organize
one.
"One of the biggest advantages of;
the conference was the opportunity to
meet people from other colleges, and
to get their viewpoints. This is one
reason why the conference recom
mends that juniors be sent as dele- j
gates. They can then bring back their j
new ideas and the advantages of their
contact with other people with them
to their universities, and use their [
experiences in improving their college.;
There will also be an attempt to have!
student tours at reduced prices for!
those attending these conferences. In ,
Europe this is done to encourage these I
meetings."

trip, and spent many days at Harvard, i
studying the government of these uni- j

■was formed at the final meeting of
the conference as a permanent or
ganization. An executive committee :
consisting of the officers, and two dele
gates from each section of the coun- j
try, will be the governing body. The :
next meeting has been set for Novem
ber 1927 at the University of Michi- j
gan. The purpose of the organization !
is to enable college students to act as j
a body on matters closely affecting
academic life, as well as to enable;
them to voice their opinions on nation- j
al and international affairs.
Other matters brought up were an
tagonism between student bodies and j
faculties, athletics including profes
sionalism, paid coaches, intersectional
games, scholarships, and the part of,
students in determining the curriculum
of a university.
"The federation has a great future," |
declared Robert Lewis, "if they start j
out their program with care. There are
similar organizations in Europe, j
though they are of a more political
nature, and it is a natural step for- 1
ward for the United States to organize
one.
"One of the biggest advantages of;
the conference was the opportunity to
meet people from other colleges, and
to get their viewpoints. This is one
reason why the conference recom
mends that juniors be sent as dele- j
gates. They can then bring back their j
new ideas and the advantages of their
contact with other people with them
to their universities, and use their [
experiences in improving their college.;
There will also be an attempt to have!
student tours at reduced prices for!
those attending these conferences. In ,
Europe this is done to encourage these I
meetings."
Lewis visited Vassar while on his i
trip, and spent many days at Harvard, i
studying the government of these uni- j
versities.
The endorsing of the World Court i

one of the Stanford delegates, has just
returned.
The World Court was approved by ,

ence's view of the matter.. Two hun
dred and fifty colleges were repre
sented at the conference by 275 of
ficial delegates. There were also many
