# STUDENTS REGISTER IN NEWLY-FORMED ENGINEERING SCHOOL
## 
### 
Eleven students have registered for 1
the new curriculum in general engi- j
neering which is being offered this ;
quarter for the first time by the j
School of Engineering. The faculty of
the school, of which T. J. Hoover is j
the dean, has outlined a four-year j
course leading to a degree of A.B. in
Engineering. This is a new curriculum
leading to a new degree, the degree
of A.B. having formerly been given in !
the separate departments of Median- j
ical. Mining, Electrical, or Civil Engi-;
neering.
Registration by engineering students j
in the School of Engineering curricu-1
lum is not compulsory. The regular j
courses of instruction now being of- j
fered by the various engineering de-1
partments will be continued for stu-1
dents who choose to specialize in some |
branch of engineering in their junior |
and senior years, and room for elec
tive courses of a technical nature has
been left in the third- and fourth-year
courses of the new curriculum.
Two years of graduate work in any j
one of the departments of the school j
will be required for the degree of i
Engineer, as heretofore. The new:
four-year School of Engineering cur
riculum is designed to give the student |
the broad fundamentals of an engi-j
neering education, postponing special- j
ization until the two years of graduate j
work. It offers an excellent opportun
ity for preparation for a business
career as well as for engineering.
The first two years include the usual
Lower Division courses in English,
mathematics, history, foreign lan-
S guage, economics, and physics. The
upper division curriculum covers a
| much broader field than that of any
| of the departments. Courses in geology,
| English, psychology, and business law
! are included. Students who have com-
J pleted their Lower Division require
; ments may register in the School of
; Engineering for the A.B. degree.
