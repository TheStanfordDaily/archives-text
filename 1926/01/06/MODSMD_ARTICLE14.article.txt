# PEACE DEPENDS ON WIDE GOOD WILL AREA-PAGE
## National Sovereignty Bars Abolition of Warfare, Lecturer Claims 
### 
"In order to realize world peace we
must widen the area of good will so
j that law and orderly government may
i transcend national boundaries and in-
I elude all humanity," declared Kirby
; Page in a lecture last night on "World
Peace or War."
Page believes that an international
agency for a peaceable process of set
tlement of the world's problems is the
only way to abolish anarchy, chaos,
! and war. "The chief barrier to peace
is the idea of sovereignty. Nations
today insist on this doctrine and the
| people believe in its maintenance be
i cause national sovereignty seems to
i be the only way to secure justice,"
he declared.
| "We have to go ahead with the task
| of educating the public to believe that
( international agreements can be en
i forced and to create public opinion
which will lead to agencies for justice.
: The League of Nations and the World
1 Court are important measures in this
direction."
The five-fold process that will en
-1 able us to settle International disputes
was flutlined by Page. Acceptance of
i international settlements by the peo
. pie, use of moral condemnation, diplo
| matic pressure, economic force, and
! the development of patience were the
j ways suggested to solve this vital
problem.
Following the meeting an open
j forum discussion was held and Page
j answered questions from the floor. At
| the conclusion of the forum, Dr. Jor-
I dan addressed the meeting and said
I that he approved of all that the lec
j turer had said and suggested that any
. payments by European powers of war
debts to the United States should be
j turned over to the farmers of this
' country.

: problems were discussed, and at a
i banquet in his honor given by the Palo
Alto Ministers Association last night.
