# UNION PANSY BEDS PROTECTED AGAINST ROVING S. A. E. PUP
## 
### 
j "Only a Pansy Blossom" has no
particular significance as a song to
"Zig," the S.A.E. cheese hound.
Henry Maier, the University land
scape gardener, states that he was
forced to put wire fences around
all the new pansy beds in front of
the Union to protect them from the
ravages of the aforesaid pup.
For several weeks the pansy beds
were being torn up by some un
known marauder whom the garden
ers were unable to detect. Then
one dark night the night watchman
came upon the culprit. It was "Zig"
quietly following that thrifty trait
! of all the canine family: burying a
bone. Just why he chose the pansy
garden is something he alone can
explain. Anyway, "Zig" must now
look elsewhere for a bone-eac:hing
place.
