# VETERANS LACKING FOR 1926 CARDINAL BASEBALL VARSITY
## Wolters Must Find Pitcher to Take Neverc' Place; First Work Monday 
### Murray Draper 
Paced with the problem of finding a
pitcher to replace Ernie Nevers and
developing men to fill six other posi
tions left vacant by graduation, Coach
Harry Wolters will call his varsity
baseball candidates together Monday
afternoon for the first workout of the
1926 season.
Only four letter men from last year's
team will report Monday. Captain Mur
ray Cuddeback, third base; Tod Oviatt
and Steve Collins, pitchers; and Paddy
Draper, outfielder, are the men who
will form a nucleus for the 1926 team.
Six Berths Vacant
This leaves six positions for which
there are no experienced varsity candi
dates. These jobs are catcher, first
base, second base, shortstop, and two
outfield positions.
For these berths it is probable that
members of last year's unusually suc
cessful freshman team will be the most
likely contenders. Husky Hunt's '28
nine included a strong, steady defense
and almost every man on the team was
able to hit well against good pitching.
Cook Sypher, captain of the frosli
team, will probably fill Jim Lawson's
place as catcher, while Maguire, Gari
baldi, and Busch all look good in the
infield. Bill Clark, who played both in
field and outfield for the *28 men, may
be shifted to the outer garden, while
Nissen, Weaver, Sims, and Biaggini
are all strong outfielders. Jersy Stew
art, who played in s-everal varsity
games last year, will put up a strong
fight for an outfield position this sea
son.
Pitchers Big Problem
| The pitching job, however, is the
big problem before Coach Wolters.
I Ernie Nevers has stood head and
• shoulders above other candidates for
' the mound position for two years, and
few other pitchers have seen heavy
service. Nevers, in addition to being
able to baffle the opposition with his
; pitching, was the longest hitter on the
! team, end was usually able to come
through with his long drives in the
! pinches. His recent entry into profes
sional football and the subsequent
i signing of a professional baseball con
i tract have made him ineligible for
| college competition.
Oviatt and Collins, both of whom
; earned letters last year, are the out
standing prospects, with Bob Philippi
of the '28 Babes also in the running.
Rudy Riese, who earned his Block S
on the mound last season, is not yet
registered in the University, but may
| return as a candidate. Count Sobieski
and Mike Reynolds, '28, will also be
I strongly in the race.
Several games will probably be
scheduled for the latter part of this
quarter, and the California series
opens soon after the start of the
| spring term.

Nissen, Weaver, Sims, and Biaggini
are all strong outfielders. Jersy Stew
art, who played in s-everal varsity
games last year, will put up a strong
fight for an outfield position this sea
son.
Pitchers Big Problem
| The pitching job, however, is the
big problem before Coach Wolters.
I Ernie Nevers has stood head and
• shoulders above other candidates for
' the mound position for two years, and
few other pitchers have seen heavy
service. Nevers, in addition to being
able to baffle the opposition with his
; pitching, was the longest hitter on the
! team, end was usually able to come
through with his long drives in the
! pinches. His recent entry into profes
sional football and the subsequent
i signing of a professional baseball con
i tract have made him ineligible for
| college competition.
Oviatt and Collins, both of whom
; earned letters last year, are the out
standing prospects, with Bob Philippi
of the '28 Babes also in the running.
Rudy Riese, who earned his Block S
on the mound last season, is not yet
registered in the University, but may
| return as a candidate. Count Sobieski
and Mike Reynolds, '28, will also be
I strongly in the race.
Several games will probably be
scheduled for the latter part of this
quarter, and the California series
opens soon after the start of the
| spring term.
Paced with the problem of finding a
pitcher to replace Ernie Nevers and
developing men to fill six other posi
tions left vacant by graduation, Coach
Harry Wolters will call his varsity
baseball candidates together Monday
afternoon for the first workout of the
1926 season.
Only four letter men from last year's
team will report Monday. Captain Mur
ray Cuddeback, third base; Tod Oviatt
and Steve Collins, pitchers; and Paddy
Draper, outfielder, are the men who
will form a nucleus for the 1926 team.
Six Berths Vacant
This leaves six positions for which
there are no experienced varsity candi
dates. These jobs are catcher, first
base, second base, shortstop, and two
outfield positions.
For these berths it is probable that
members of last year's unusually suc
cessful freshman team will be the most
likely contenders. Husky Hunt's '28
nine included a strong, steady defense
and almost every man on the team was
able to hit well against good pitching.
Cook Sypher, captain of the frosli
team, will probably fill Jim Lawson's
place as catcher, while Maguire, Gari
baldi, and Busch all look good in the
infield. Bill Clark, who played both in
field and outfield for the *28 men, may
be shifted to the outer garden, while
Nissen, Weaver, Sims, and Biaggini
are all strong outfielders. Jersy Stew
art, who played in s-everal varsity
games last year, will put up a strong
fight for an outfield position this sea
son.
