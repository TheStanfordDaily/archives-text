# WORK ON TWO-DECK NORTHWESTERN BOWL TO COMMENCE SOON
## 
### 
Northwestern University plans to
break ground for its new athletic sta
dium as early in the spring as the
weather will permit. Work will pro
! ceed rapidly so that the initial struc
ture of two decks will be ready for
the opening of this fall's football sea
son.
1 The Purpla stadium will be a three
decker when completed but only two
will be built at this time. These two
decks will be eighty feet in height.
The third deck will be added when
more seats are needed to accommo
date the crowds that are expected to
watch the Northwestern football play
ers in action. When entirely finished
the structure will be 126 feet high,
with a total seating capacity, including
end seats, of about 75,000. At least,
j 6,000 temporary end seats will be
erected next fall, when the big games
are played, to handle the crowds, and
to relieve pressure upon the two decks
that will have been completed by that
time. The final seating capacity oP
the stadium will be as follows: 40,000
on the two sides of the first deck, 9000
on the sides of the second deck, 11,000
ion the sides of the third deck, 6000
first deck end seats, 2500 second deck
end seats, with provision for 6000 tem
j porary seats at the north end.
This stadium will be probably the
most accessible in America, as it may
be reached by automobile, street cars,
elevated trains, and steam railroads.
The arrangement of the press stand
, will give unexcelled facilities to news
j paper men. Two private elevators will
, whisk the writers to commodious quar
i ters surmounting the center of the
: third deck on the west side of the field.
' !
, The room will be glassed in on three
sides, steam-heated, electric-lighted,
and with ample desk room for tele
graph instruments and papers. There
; will he no possibility of obstruction
I | of view even if spectators stand up in
front of the lower tier of press seats.
1 Private telephone communication with
-1 the players' box at the front of the
; first deck will be installed and there
i will be generous telephonic and tele
l' graphic facilities for outside use. A
coffee urn will be installed so that on
- cold afternoons the writers need not
?; toil through many hours with no re
j freshment.

dium as early in the spring as the
weather will permit. Work will pro
! ceed rapidly so that the initial struc
ture of two decks will be ready for
the opening of this fall's football sea
son.
1 The Purpla stadium will be a three
decker when completed but only two
will be built at this time. These two
decks will be eighty feet in height.
The third deck will be added when
more seats are needed to accommo
date the crowds that are expected to
watch the Northwestern football play
ers in action. When entirely finished
the structure will be 126 feet high,
with a total seating capacity, including
end seats, of about 75,000. At least,
j 6,000 temporary end seats will be
erected next fall, when the big games
are played, to handle the crowds, and
to relieve pressure upon the two decks
that will have been completed by that
time. The final seating capacity oP
the stadium will be as follows: 40,000
on the two sides of the first deck, 9000
on the sides of the second deck, 11,000
ion the sides of the third deck, 6000
first deck end seats, 2500 second deck
end seats, with provision for 6000 tem
j porary seats at the north end.
This stadium will be probably the
most accessible in America, as it may
be reached by automobile, street cars,
elevated trains, and steam railroads.
The arrangement of the press stand
, will give unexcelled facilities to news
j paper men. Two private elevators will
, whisk the writers to commodious quar
i ters surmounting the center of the
: third deck on the west side of the field.
' !
, The room will be glassed in on three
sides, steam-heated, electric-lighted,
and with ample desk room for tele
graph instruments and papers. There
; will he no possibility of obstruction
I | of view even if spectators stand up in
front of the lower tier of press seats.
1 Private telephone communication with
-1 the players' box at the front of the
; first deck will be installed and there
i will be generous telephonic and tele
l' graphic facilities for outside use. A
coffee urn will be installed so that on
- cold afternoons the writers need not
?; toil through many hours with no re
j freshment.
