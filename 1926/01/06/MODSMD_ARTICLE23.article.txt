Anticipating the choosing of a new yell-leader, the Executive Commit
tee at its regular meeting last night indulged in a prolonged discussion
regarding the advisability of allowing women to participate in the election
of a man for this office. This is a student body position, and women are
members of the student body. Therefore, we can see 110 possible reason
why women should not be allowed to express their choice at the polls.
It is said by those in favor of refusing women the right to vote for
veil-leader that women do not actually take part in the bleacher stunts and
so consequently it is not necessary for them to help name the leader. Others
claim that the women's vote has been the deciding factor in a number of
past elections —but the 500 are just as likely to elect the right man who is
backed by a weak political organization as they are to get the poorer can
didate into office; so this reason seems valueless. \
The Stanford yell-leader is continually in the limelight and is repre
senting the whole student body to the outside world. When he has done
the wrong thing at the wrong time he has brought discredit to the entire
University. If the women must have the yell-leaders blunders reflect partly
upon them, they should at least have the right to help choose him.
Even though women do not take part in the organized yelling they do
join in the singing at games, which is enough to warrant their votes. When
spontaneous yelling and shouting is necessary, especially at times when the
spirit of the bleachers is sinking, it takes a man with real personality to keep
the spirits of an entire student body buoyed up. The average woman is a
Jjetter judge of personality than a man, and can vote accordingly.
The head cheer leader has never been called a Men's Yell Leader. When
he is given that title, then it will be time for the men students alone to
select him.
