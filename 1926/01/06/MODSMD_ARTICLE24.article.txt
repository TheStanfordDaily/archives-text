Ohio State and Miami are having their liquor troubles, even though
they are decidedly different, according to The American Campus. At
Miami seventy-five or eighty students were observed in a state of more or
less joyful inebriation at recent away-from-home game. Whereupon
President Hughes threatened "unless something is done to stop these dis
graceful incidents, we can, and will keep our athletic teams at home."
Raiding the home of an instructor at Ohio State University, prohibition
officials found a still, s6me liquor, and an order book containing the names
of certain students. The instructor has been relieved of his duties and a
thorough "house-cleaning" of the university has been ordered by the Gov
ernor. Reports of drinking parties at fraternity houses, dances and other
gatherings, and the allegation that some faculty members are Communists
are to be investigated.
From the fact that the Miami students are normal and average we
must assume that students all over the country are drinking (if we don't
know it already) and so if the Ohio State professor was a member of the
chemistry department he should have known what he was making, and that
being the case he was probably one of the safest bootleggers in town for
the students to patronize. Hence, it is tragic the authorities ousted him,
for now the students are forced to drink worse mixtures. All of which
reasoning is interesting but gets us nowhere.
