# Youth Not So Bad
## 
### 
The Dearborn Independent feels that the younger generation of today
is no worse than it ever was. In fact, it is of the opinion that a college
filled with 40-year-olds would be much harder to control than one whose
personnel is made up of a group of the younger generation. The Indepen
dent comments as follows:
"The college president from the middle west dropped into the office.
He said: 'There is more wrong with suspicious old heads than there is
with frivilous young ones. Older people always attribute to young people
the same type of knowledge the older ones have. They forget the inhibi
tions, the natural idealisms, the biological protections of youth.
" 'My college is co-educational. Not long ago the president of a man's
college called on me. 'Mac,' said he, 'I'd hate to be responsible for the
moral life of these 500 boys and girls you have running around on your
campus.' 'Harry,' said I, 'which would you be most afraid ofâ€”five hun
dred men and women of your age and mine, or those youngsters out there?'
'Mac,' said he, 'I'd have more confidence in the youngsters.' "
Alarming loss of interest in terpsichorean amusement at the University
of McGill:
"The crowd that assembled in the Union House lobby for the opening of the
ticket sale for the Union House Dance, while energetic, was not so large as it might
have been The crowd, no doubt, will eventually turn up but the tardiness in the
purchase of tickets is, to say the least, alarming."
Claim to fame justified by the Oberlin Review:
"Professor C. W. Savage spoke at the University of Ohio football banquet Tues
day night, December 28. Professor Savage has a daughter in the physical education
department of tlx; university."
