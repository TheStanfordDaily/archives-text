# CABBAGES and THINGS
## SHARLSTUN! 
### Monroe Eaton 
Nearly everyone on the campus
seems to have been taken during the
vacation with a habit of twisting the
feet every which way in an apparently
uncontrolled manner.
* * *
Although Cabbages thoroughly ap
proves of the Charleston as a dance
we do not consider it the best way to
eat breakfast or to part the hair.

Because of the unsatbility of sev
eral campus floors under the on
slaughts of the Charleston, it is prob
able that in the future couples will
be numbered and allowed to wiggle
the feet and jump up and down only
when their number is called.
* * *
It is rumored that the periods be
tween classes will be extended to
twenty minutes so that students will
have time to Charleston from one class
to the other.

One man is said to have cured him
self of rheumatism by learning to do
the Charleston.

No doubt we will soon see a well
known slogan changed to the form:
Tired? Hungry? Sleepy? Just Charles
ton!

Someone living in or about the year
4000 Avill probably be confronted with
the report of a Natural History society
reading something like this:
"A number of skeletons were recent
ly unearthed in one of the places
where a city of the Great American
Republic once stood. These specimens
seem to furnish a missing link in the
history of man. The limbs were found
in grotesque positions such as have
never been seen before. The knees
and the toes were invariably turned
forming in most cases an almost per
fect letter X.
Queer brass instruments resembling
immense tobacco pipes were found
nearby. It is suspected that the smok
ing of some sort of herb in these pipes
produced the remarkable postures.
Some advance the theory that this
was a religious rite and the instru
ments were used to produce music.
