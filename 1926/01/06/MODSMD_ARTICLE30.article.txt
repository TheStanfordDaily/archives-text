# MODIFIED QUARTER SYSTEM FAVORED BY FACULTY OF U. S. C.
## 
### 
That a modified quarter system is fa
vored by the majority of the faculty and
should be adopted at the University of
Southern California was the report deliv
ered to the Administration Cabinet by
Dean Karl T. Waugh at a recent meeting.
The proposed system would follow much
the same after that in practice at Stanford
except the fourth quarter would be a sum
mer session. This session would still in
clude special courses, and might be di
vided into two parts of either six weeks
each or four and eight weeks, the courses
to be given for either half or full credit.
The three quarter system as used at
Stanford, the University of Chicago and
many eastern universities provides for
four quarters of exactly the same length,
but would be impractical at Southern Cali
fornia, according to Dean Waugh, because
it would require too large a faculty, and
would involve unnecessary repetition of
the same courses.
The modified system recommended by
the committee is favored because it would
establish a uniform system at all the
colleges of the university, since Law and
Metropolitan already have the quarter sys
tem. It would also enable students to
work during an entire quarter without
losing any school credit, or
in three years by attending school during
all four terms.
