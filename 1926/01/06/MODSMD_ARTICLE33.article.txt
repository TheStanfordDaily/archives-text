His long absence from the screen is
not noticeable and there are laughs ;
I by the carload in the ten reels.
From its beginning to its end the
i picture is all Charlie and the other 1
characters fade away into the distance.
As a lone prospector in the Klondike, I
I the comedian is a pathetic figure.
Lacking friends, money, and food, ;
| Chaplin solves the problem in a com
j ical way and returns to the States a
millionaire.
With starvation staring him in the
face, Chaplin has to part with one of |
his immense shoes and his attempts
to eat the boiled leather furnish some
i interesting scenes. A rather unusual
i costume for the little man is neces-!
j sary when he appears as a chicken, i
| The scenario is written by Chaplin
and the picture was directed by him. 1
I After seeing "The Gold Rush" one !
j comes to the conclusion that Charlie
Chaplin is not only a clever comedian
