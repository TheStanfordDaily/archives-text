# SPORTS OF 1926
## Pro and Con Football 
### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Now that the Red Dragon has upset the table and completely demolished
the collegiate Mah Jongg works, why not cease all this silly "viewing with
alarm" and apprehension over the future of football that has been all the rage
since Grange signed on the dotted line and played his first game for the
Chicago Bears?
That boy certainly started something! And such a difference of opinion,
too. After listening to all the arguments pro and con (and pro. football, by the
way, is not a "con game"), you don't know whether Harold Grange should be
shot for leaving school before he had finished out his senior year, or com
mended for openly embracing a professional career in the one thing that he
could do well. Is he a Gr-angel, or a Red devil? A nice man, or an ice man
who has been short-weighting his Alma Mater?
You certainly can't commend Red for telling over the radio in New York
of the great spiritual strength and uplift that he has derived from football,
and the next day accepting ?1000 for the use of his name in advertising a
certain cigarette, when he never smoked in his life. On the other hand, you
have to hand it to him for retaining the same size hat band that he's had the
last three years, and for wanting to repay his father who put him through
school, with some of his gridiron earnings.
And as yet I haven't heard of his wearing a football jersey with ermine
trimmings, or shoes with diamond-studded cleats —and he hasn't yet been
caught passing around his lieadguard for contributions he made a touch
down. More power to you, Harold!
FEG MURRAY SAYS—
The following anecdote probably explains why Red Grange insists on
wearing that mystic double number on his back that he has carried to fame
ever since he was in high school.
When he was a youngster first learning to count, his teacher wished to
test the pupils' powers of observation. He called for various ones to call
out numbers above twenty, then he'd write the opposite on the board.
Johnnie would say "32," teacher would mark up 23; Bill, "58," teacher, 85;
and so on, with no rise out of his class at all.
Then up spoke Harold. "Theventy-theven—leath thee you monkey with
that, you thucker!"
No, the University of Illinois is not preserving his sweater frozen in
a cake of ice.
