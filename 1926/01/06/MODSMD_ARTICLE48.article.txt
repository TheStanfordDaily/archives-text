# RECENT BASKETBALL CHANGES OUTLINED IN SPAULDING, GUIDE
## 
### 
Outstanding changes in the basket
ball rules for 1925-26 are those abol
ishing the liand-behind-the-back on
jump ball and the goal zone. It was
felt that these changes could be made
safely under present conditions and
that they would meet with the ap
proval of the great majority of those
interested in the game. The new rules
are discussed and defined in Spauld
ing's Basketball Guide recently issued.
Under the new jump rule it is a per
sonal foul for a player to interfere in
any way with his opponent, and this
has special reference to the hand not
used in tapping the ball. To avoid this
foul, players should endeavor to keep
this hand in the plane of the body.
Spaukling's Guide has an appendix
to the rules, in the form of questions
and answers, which is of great value
in clarifying doubtful points.
Basketball, a comparatively new
sport, has developed into a game call
ing for a higher standard of scientific
playing in far less time than other
sports of similar popularity. A big
advance was made several years ago
when the rules committees of the
Young Men's Christian Association,
the National Collegiate Athletic Asso
ciation, and the Amateur Athletic
Union, the three organizations most
prominent in the sport, adopted a uni
form code of rules, thus eliminating
variations in play which tended to hin
der the development of the sport.
Great credit is due the members of
this joint rules committee for the close
attention they have given to the
progress of the game and their quick
response to any indication of neces
sity for changes that would result in
betterment of play. At present the of
ficers are William H. Ball, chairman;
Ralph Morgan, treasurer, and George
T. Hepbron, secretary, with Oswald
Tower as editor.
An annual interpretation meeting
held by the committee, which is at
tended by coaches, officials, and play
ers, at which doubtful points are
demonstrated and explained, is an im
portant factor in maintaining a stand
ard observance of the rules. These
meetings are repeated by sectional
bodies in every part of the country,
thus rendering a uniform administra
tion of the rules possible.
