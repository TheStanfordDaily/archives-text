# CHAPPIE TO PARODY "VANITY-FAIR" WITH FIRST 1926 ISSUE
## Gamma Phis, Chi Omegas Will Sell Comics on Quad Friday Morning 
### 
J Modelled upon that journal of the j
i ultra-sophisticates, "Vanity Fair," the
I first 1926 issue of Chaparral will be ■
| placed on sale on the Quad, Friday.
Subscribers' copies will be placed in
j the mail the same day. The issue, a
! take-off on Vanity Fair, is similar in j
! style to the "Judge" number of Chap- j
pie which appeared last May, a parody ;
;on the famous weekly comic. The;
| "Vanity Fair" number is somewhat
less of a burlesque and more of a
' satire than was the "Judge" number,
chiefly because the style and contents
of the former magazine lend them
selves more readily to this form of
fun-making. "In brief," remarked the
Old Boy, when interviewed at an early
j hour this morning by a representative
of the press, "the forthcoming issue is
j 'Vanity Fair' seen through foolish
! eyes."
I Members of the Gamma Phi Beta:
1 and the Chi Omega sororities will sell j
! copies at the general Quad sale Friday!
morning. The Alpha Phi sorority will j
i assist in selling the following number
; instead of the Vanity Fair issue as
j was announced previously. This sys
j tem of having women salespeople met
| with such remarkable success at its
| first trial last month that the circula-
J tion department decided to use it
; again immediately.
The book contains forty-four pages, i
! and much effort has been spent to j
| make it at first glance resemble the j
I original very closely. The typography,:
, page-form, and cover size of Chappie
; was altered for that purpose, so that
j to the uninitiated and unobserving the j
volume will appear to be merely a
j midget edition of the well-known,
; Conde' Nast publication. Which, the
| Old Boy emphatically asserts, is not
i at all the case.
"Issues of college comic magazines
J parodying national publications have,
i in the past year or so, become some
j thing of a convention," says Greg Wil
i liamson, Chappie editor, "and now j
j very few college comics run a full '
year without producing at least one ,
' such issue. Among the most prominent
1 of those which have come out recently I
I are the "Physical Culture" number of i
the Notre Dame "Juggler," the Sears, i
j Roebuck Catalogue number of the Cor
-1 nell "Widow," our own "Judge" num
j ber, and the "Literary Digest" num
j ber of the Harvard "Lampoon," which
I was suppressed by the postal author!-
! ties. We're hoping for better luck than
| that on the Vanity Fair number."

less of a burlesque and more of a
' satire than was the "Judge" number,
chiefly because the style and contents
of the former magazine lend them
selves more readily to this form of
fun-making. "In brief," remarked the
Old Boy, when interviewed at an early
j hour this morning by a representative
of the press, "the forthcoming issue is
j 'Vanity Fair' seen through foolish

j tem of having women salespeople met

; again immediately.
The book contains forty-four pages, i
