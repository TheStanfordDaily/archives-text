# USE OF PHONOGRAPH, DICTAPHONE TO AID STUDY OF SPANISH
## 
### 
Northwestern Universityâ€”lMverg-
J ing entirely from the customary meth
l od of teaching adeptness in pronuncia
| tion and speed in phraseology, the
| Spanish section of the romance lang
: uage group has taken into considera
tion the use of the phonograph and
( dictaphone as steps to a more scien
| tific approach to the subject.
| Although plans are immature as yet,
j the Spanish faculty has drawn up a
j few ideas which will characterize the
i new process. It is the plan at present
;to make a record of each student's
I speaking ability on the phonograph at
; the start of the semester and to re
: check the record at the close of the
term for improvement.
In conjunction with this modern
I "laboratory of language," students will
have the opportunity to hear the
speech in the native tongue and will
thus be able to grasp the polished
rhythm of Spanish with less difficulty.
