Palo Alto High School team as a pre-1
liminary to the 145-pound team's game j
against San Jose. The freshman game j
will start at 7 o'clock.
Several cuts have been made in the j
freshman squad and more men will be '
dropped after this game. No definite |
team has been picked to start and j
many changes will be made in the!
lineup during the contest, according j
to Hunt.
Palo Alto has a strong team, having I
beaten several of the peninsula high j
school organizations, including Se-;
quoia High, of Redwood City. Sequoia j
has already played the freshmen, in
an informal scrimmage, in which the
babes were barely able to hold their
own.
