# WEIGHT FIVE PLAYS SAN JOSE QUINTET BEFORE BIG GAME
## 
### 
As a preliminary to the basketball
game between the Stanford frosh and
the Palo Alto High School teams to
night, Coach Hal Davis' 145-pound
team will play the San Jose Alumni
Club at 7 o'clock.
The Alumni are understood to be
especially strong this year, and won
a reputation for themselves a week
ago by conquering the strong Univer
sity of Santa Clara five, although they
have dropped two games to the Stan
ford varsitjf. They are doped to beat
the 145's, but the weight men may
pull the unexpected.
The probable starting lineup for
Stanford is: Sheffield and Blazier, for
wards; Saunders, center; and New
comb and Cairns, guards.
