# DRESS REHEARSAL WILL FINISH WORK ON WILDE'S DRAMA
## Playwright's Characteristics Followed by Director And in Settings 
### 
Dress rehearsal will be held tonight
for the production of "The Importance
of Being Earnest," to be given in the
Assembly hall tomorrow evening at
S:l5 o'clock, with all members of the
cast in costume. The conventionality
amounting to artificiality which char
acterizes Wilde has been carried out
by Gordon Davis, dramatic coach, in
the gestures, grouping, and even the
inflections of the actors.
Leslie Kiler, technical director, has
further followed out this idea in the
development of the sets. The play is
in three acts with a separate setting
i'or each. Drape settings are used for
the first and third acts. The first takes
place in the drawing room of Algernon
Moncrieff in London, the second in the
garden of an English country home,
and the third in the interior of the
country home. The suggestion of con
ventionality has been carried out in
the sets with effective ingenuity.
As is always the case with Wilde,
•"The Importance of Being Earnest" is
an example of plot construction so
flawless that it runs off with mechan
ical smoothness seemingly too perfect.
Technical excellence is combined with
cleverness of lines to make the comedy
one of the classic examples of drama
of this type.
Tickets for Friday's performance
are still available at the new office of
the dramatic manager in the lobby of
the Old Union. The play will be fol
lowed by the customary 1 o'clock
dance in the Women's Clubhouse.
