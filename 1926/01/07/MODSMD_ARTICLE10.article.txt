# VARSITY PRACTICES HARD FOR POMONA CAGE GAME
## Stanford Basketeers Display Faster Passing, Shooting Since U.C.S.B. Tilt 
### Jim Adams 
In spite of a bad showing Monday
! night Stanford still has a basketball
team which will give a good account
lof itself before the season is much
[ older. Hard drilling is the treatment
| Coach Andy Kerr has prescribed to
attain this result and such was ad
ministered in the first practice after
the defeat at the hands of the fast
University of California, Southern
Branch, five.
i
I Kerr is concentrating on the chief
defects which appeared in his machine
in the last game. Accurate passing has
been stressed in the last two practices
as it was this fault which proved to be
the monkey wrench in the works Mon
| day. The team lacks a steady accurate
! shooter, but Kerr is striving to train
the basket-shooting ability of the
squad so as to get a fair average from
attempts.
Little Prestige Lost
i The Grizzly team was a very formid
able squad and the Cards lost little
prestige in being defeated by them.
The worst feature was the poor exhi
bition of basketball Stanford displayed.
This was undoubtedly due to an off
night, as the team in every practice
has shown a better brand of ball than
played against the Branch. The South
erners probably would have defeated
them even if it had not been an off
night, but nevertheless the Stanford
five is capable of a better brand than
jshown at that game.
Kerr is'using the Grizzly team as
an example in endeavoring to teach
his men to start their offense faster
and in jumping back to the defense
position and getting set before their
opponents can get under way.
Price Going Well
Captain Fred Price was hitting the
1 basket well last night. David was
; playing opposite him in the scrim-
I mage and will probably start the
game with Pomona Saturday night.
I Jayred goes like a whirlwind for a
' few minutes but then tires and plays
a listless kind of basketball. Steele
i will not be eligible until the twenty
! fifth of the month but Jayred will
, probably play as long as he keeps his
] fast pace.
Anderson has been performing in
| great style as standing guard and
! given a little more experience will
I ably fill the old position of Oliva.
| Mitchell has been out of the scrim
j mages for the last two nights as the
j result of an injury to his ankle suf
j fered in the Branch game, but will be
j in the contest against Pomona. Sliip
; key has been filling his place in prac
; tice.
