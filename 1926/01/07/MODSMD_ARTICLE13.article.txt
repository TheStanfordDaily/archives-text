## 
### 
! The direction of the work of the
j National Students Federation, forijied
j at the recent World Court Conference
j at Princeton University, will be in the
' hands of the sectional members of the
I executive committee, it has been an
nounced by Lewis Fox, chairman of
the National Collegiate World Court
I Conference.
Each committee member will be in
| charge of the colleges in his district
J and will have the power to appoint the
person or organization in each college
to take charge of the work of the
1 federation. The country is divided into
seven districts.
Conferences Held
The committee members are charged
with furnishing the college papers
with news of student activities here
and abroad. Regional conferences, to
discuss matters of sectional import
ance, will be held soon —probably in
April.
The Federation was founded at the
i World Court Conference, and the dele
gates gave a summary of the proposed
j work of the Federation as follows:
"Two purposes for which the Federa
tion is primarily working are: first,
Ito secure an increased interest and
i influence upon national and interna
j tioual affairs in the colleges and uni-
j versities of this country; second, to
achieve a closer unity between the
colleges of the United States, and to
, promote sympathy and understanding
I between the students of this country
j and those of the rest of the world."
The actual means of attaining these
ends will be:
Scholarships Established
First: the establishment of scholar
ships between the colleges of America
and Europe similar to the Rhodes and
Davison scholarships which now exist.
These scholarships would be for the
duration of one year and would be
held by juniors who could return to
■ their own colleges after being abroad.
I Second: student tours to Europe
1 during the summer to study social, po
j litical, and economical conditions of j
Europe and to attend a short course
at some European university.
Third: a central clearing house for j
i all information regarding student con-'
i ditions in Europe, and information on ;
fellowships in this and foreign coun- j
tries.
Fourth: co-operation between fac- 1
ulty and undergraduates in American j
colleges on matters relating to ar-!
rangement of courses of study, stu
dent government, and administration
of discipline.
Central Bureau Formed
Fifth: a central bureau whose pur-{
pose will be to furnish colleges with I
prominent speakers oil national and j
international problems.
Sixth: the creation of public opinion
to militate against commercialism in
college athletics.
Seventh: the encouragement of a
spirit of individuality and initiative as
opposed to the prevalent tendency to
ward standardized mediocrity."
At present the Federation is a work
| ing organization. A program has been !
outlined which will be followed until
! it has proved itself sufficiently to war-
I rant the adoption of an absolutely I
j lasting federation.

April.
The Federation was founded at the
i World Court Conference, and the dele
gates gave a summary of the proposed
j work of the Federation as follows:
"Two purposes for which the Federa
tion is primarily working are: first,
Ito secure an increased interest and
i influence upon national and interna
j tioual affairs in the colleges and uni-
j versities of this country; second, to
achieve a closer unity between the
colleges of the United States, and to
, promote sympathy and understanding
I between the students of this country
j and those of the rest of the world."
The actual means of attaining these
ends will be:
Scholarships Established
First: the establishment of scholar
ships between the colleges of America
and Europe similar to the Rhodes and
Davison scholarships which now exist.
These scholarships would be for the
duration of one year and would be
held by juniors who could return to
■ their own colleges after being abroad.
I Second: student tours to Europe
1 during the summer to study social, po
j litical, and economical conditions of j
Europe and to attend a short course
at some European university.
Third: a central clearing house for j
i all information regarding student con-'
i ditions in Europe, and information on ;
fellowships in this and foreign coun- j
tries.
Fourth: co-operation between fac- 1
ulty and undergraduates in American j
colleges on matters relating to ar-!
rangement of courses of study, stu
dent government, and administration
of discipline.
Central Bureau Formed
Fifth: a central bureau whose pur-{
pose will be to furnish colleges with I
prominent speakers oil national and j
international problems.
Sixth: the creation of public opinion
to militate against commercialism in
college athletics.
Seventh: the encouragement of a
spirit of individuality and initiative as
opposed to the prevalent tendency to
ward standardized mediocrity."
At present the Federation is a work
| ing organization. A program has been !
outlined which will be followed until
! it has proved itself sufficiently to war-
I rant the adoption of an absolutely I
j lasting federation.
! The direction of the work of the
j National Students Federation, forijied
j at the recent World Court Conference
j at Princeton University, will be in the
' hands of the sectional members of the
I executive committee, it has been an
nounced by Lewis Fox, chairman of
the National Collegiate World Court
I Conference.
Each committee member will be in
| charge of the colleges in his district
J and will have the power to appoint the
person or organization in each college
to take charge of the work of the
1 federation. The country is divided into
seven districts.
Conferences Held
The committee members are charged
with furnishing the college papers
with news of student activities here
and abroad. Regional conferences, to
discuss matters of sectional import
ance, will be held soon —probably in
April.
