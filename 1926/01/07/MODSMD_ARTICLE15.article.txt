# VANITY FAIR ISSUE OF CHAPARRAL OUT TOMORROW MORNING
## Cover Design by Bickerton; Breeze and Mendelowitz Satirize Cartoons 
### 
Vanity Fair, the smart, the fashion
able, and the sophisticated, will toss
its haughty nose in high but well-bred
horror when the Chaparral Vanity
Fair number appears upon the campus
tomorrow. Experienced critics have
pronounced the issue to be one of the
cleverest in satire and burlesque that
has come from the Chaparral press in
many a year.
Bickerton has contributed the cover,
in a dash of brilliant technique, an
exact replica of the usual Vanity Fair
idea in the general style, yet remark
ably different in theme. The cover,
which is printed in four colors and
halftone, is typical of the delicacy and
skill in which the material within it
has been treated.
Satirical drawings by Breeze and
Mendelowitz in the style of Fish and
Covorrubias have taken off the work
of these well-known Vanity Fair art
ists in both delicate and sophisticated
fashion. Criley, Breeze, and William
son have written the body of literary
copy and captions, and in properly
rounding out the edition, J. M. Riess
has contributed some excellent art
work.
Chappie's Hall of Fame, illustrated
by cartoons, the Well-Dressed Man
story, the automobile section, and Fos
ter on the Bridge, are among the Van
ity Fair departments included in the
burlesque.
Chi Omega and Gamma Phi Beta
sororities will carry on the quad sale
tomorrow.
