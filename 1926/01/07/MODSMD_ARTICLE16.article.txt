# UNIVERSITY ORGAN RECITAL SCHEDULED SUNDAY AFTERNOON
## 
### 
Warren D. Allen, University organ
ist, will play a varied program in his
organ recital in the Memorial Church
next Sunday afternoon at 4 o'clock.
Of special interest because of its back
ground is the selection from Bizet's
"Suite l'arlesienne." Two numbers
from the suite will be played, the
"Intermezzo" or interlude, and "Ada
gietto."
Georges Bizet (1835-1875) is best
known as the composer of the opera
Carmen which had an almost unri
valled popularity. "Carmen" has been
called the greatest opera ever written,
and Bizet is recognized as the fore
most among French opera composers.
Bizet, in 1872, wrote the incidental
music to the drama, "The Woman of
Aries," by Alphonse Daudet, noted
French dramatist and author. The
selections were of such merit that they
have been arranged in a suite which
i 3 named "L'arlesienne" after the play.
Canzona dopo l'epistola" will open
the recital. It is a composition of Fres
cobaldi who, as organist of St. Peter's
and foremost composer of his day, did
much for early music. Frescobaldi
lived in the late sixteenth century and
so was a predecessor of J. S. Bach
who is represented on the program by
two of his mighty chorale-preludes:
"In Thee Is Gladness," and "The Old
Year Now Hath Passed Away," which
is appropriate to the New Year season.
Bach's chorales were based on the
Lutheran hymn tunes with which lie,
as church organist for many years in
Leipsic, was familiar.
