# FRESHMAN QUINTET WINS FAST MATCH FROM PALO ALTO
## Coach Husky Hunt Tries New Combinations in Effort To Find Best Team 
### 
Showing better form than in any
other game this season, the freshman
basketball team defeated the strong
Palo Alto High School team in the
pavilion last night by a score of 20 to
14. The high school boys had a fast
team and the freshmen were given a
hard fight in their first scheduled
game. Failure of the high school play
ers to connect with the basket in op
portune moments prevented them from
running up a larger score.
Many changes were made in the
lineup by Coach Hunt, who used this
game to experiment with different
combinations. Lewis, Milton, Marx,
and Worden, all former football men,
saw action during the contest, and
showed considerable promise.
McCandless, lanky center who
starred for Inglewood High in the
state playoffs last year, played an ex
cellent floor game and his work under
the basket was good. He shows prom
ise of developing into a valuable cog
in the frosh machine.
Husky Hunt's men came through in
the last two minutes of the game with
a rally which netted four points and
put the contest on ice.
The starting lineup for the freshmen
included Wilton and Crary, forwards;
McCandless, center; Worden and
Marx, guards.
Hunt is still dissatisfied with his
team and another cut in the squad
will probably follow last night's game.
Lack of experienced material has
forced him to carry a larger squad
than usual. The final cut will reduce
the squad to fifteen men.
