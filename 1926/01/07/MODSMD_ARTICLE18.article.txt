# VARSITY, BABE WATER POLO TEAMS OPPOSE BEARS FEBRUARY 13
## 
### 
Stanford freshman and varsity
water polo teams will hold their an
nual tangles with California on Feb
ruary 13 in Encina pool. Practice has
already started here for Ernst Brand
sten, coach of water sports, and the
water polo squads are determined to
keep unbroken the long string of Stan
ford victories in swimming and water
polo.
The varsity seven already looks like
a winner. With Wally O'Connor, of the
American Olympic team playing at
sprint or forward, and with Arden
Allen, water polo captain as center
back or guard, Brandsten has a nu
cleus for a team that would compare
favorably with that of any club or uni
versity in the country. Other players
who seem to have berths cinched are:
Art Stewart, forward, and Bob Wil
liams, guard. For goal guard the choice
will probably lie between Morrison,
Poulsen, and Dixon Smith, any of
whom should be capable of learning
to stop the majority of tries at the
basket, but Slim Carson, the spectacu
lar goal guard of last year's team, will
be greatly missed. For the remaining
two positions, one forward and one
back, Brandsten will probably draw
on the material from last year's fresh
man team. Kryne van den Akker and
Harry Andrews will both make a bid
for the .forward place while Harry
Maltby and Hob Sims as guards are
effective In keeping the ball up in the
opposing territory. Other capable
players are Mack, Graham, and Sib
bett.
Frosh Game Hard
The freshman team will probably
have a little harder tussle in their
game. Reports from Berkeley indicate
the largest swimming turnout there
to date. With the newly completed
pool of the Athens Club of Oakland
at their disposal, many new California
swimmers have come out. Coaching
is being done by Jack Robertson,
champion sprint swimmer of the Olym
pic Club, who has volunteered his
time to help the Berkeley men beat
Stanford.
To date the stellar players of the
freshman squad seem to be Bob Burns
and Cal Strong. Burns, a former Low
ell High swimmer, has also had ex
perience with the Olympic Club junior
team. Strong is from Long Beach.
Others who should make the team
are: Phil Rainey, Henry Hanna, M.
Brown, and Creswell Cole.
Polo Practice Daily
Water polo scrimmage will be held
almost daily from now on at five
o'clock. Two games will be played,
one for the freshmen and the other
for the varsity squad.
The swimming meet with California
will be held either the fifth or sixth
of March at a place to be selected by
California, probably the Athens Club
of Oakland. Varsity swimmers have
been working out since the first day
of the quarter, swimming distances to
regain their wind after the vacation
lay-off.
Contrary to newspaper announce
ments Stanford will not be entered in
the P.A.A. championships which the
Olympic Club is staging next Sunday
evening. Stanford men would be
obliged to enter unattached due to
the clause in Mrs. Stanford's will
which prevents any athlete from com
peting under the Stanford colors on
a Sunday.

to stop the majority of tries at the
basket, but Slim Carson, the spectacu
lar goal guard of last year's team, will
be greatly missed. For the remaining
two positions, one forward and one
back, Brandsten will probably draw
on the material from last year's fresh
man team. Kryne van den Akker and
Harry Andrews will both make a bid
for the .forward place while Harry
Maltby and Hob Sims as guards are
effective In keeping the ball up in the
opposing territory. Other capable
players are Mack, Graham, and Sib
bett.
Frosh Game Hard
The freshman team will probably
have a little harder tussle in their
game. Reports from Berkeley indicate
the largest swimming turnout there
to date. With the newly completed
pool of the Athens Club of Oakland
at their disposal, many new California
swimmers have come out. Coaching
is being done by Jack Robertson,
champion sprint swimmer of the Olym
pic Club, who has volunteered his
time to help the Berkeley men beat
Stanford.
To date the stellar players of the
freshman squad seem to be Bob Burns
and Cal Strong. Burns, a former Low
ell High swimmer, has also had ex
perience with the Olympic Club junior
team. Strong is from Long Beach.
Others who should make the team
are: Phil Rainey, Henry Hanna, M.
Brown, and Creswell Cole.
Polo Practice Daily
Water polo scrimmage will be held
almost daily from now on at five
o'clock. Two games will be played,
one for the freshmen and the other
for the varsity squad.
The swimming meet with California
will be held either the fifth or sixth
of March at a place to be selected by
California, probably the Athens Club
of Oakland. Varsity swimmers have
been working out since the first day
of the quarter, swimming distances to
regain their wind after the vacation
lay-off.
Contrary to newspaper announce
ments Stanford will not be entered in
the P.A.A. championships which the
Olympic Club is staging next Sunday
evening. Stanford men would be
obliged to enter unattached due to
the clause in Mrs. Stanford's will
which prevents any athlete from com
peting under the Stanford colors on
a Sunday.
Stanford freshman and varsity
water polo teams will hold their an
nual tangles with California on Feb
ruary 13 in Encina pool. Practice has
already started here for Ernst Brand
sten, coach of water sports, and the
water polo squads are determined to
keep unbroken the long string of Stan
ford victories in swimming and water
polo.
The varsity seven already looks like
a winner. With Wally O'Connor, of the
American Olympic team playing at
sprint or forward, and with Arden
Allen, water polo captain as center
back or guard, Brandsten has a nu
cleus for a team that would compare
favorably with that of any club or uni
versity in the country. Other players
who seem to have berths cinched are:
Art Stewart, forward, and Bob Wil
liams, guard. For goal guard the choice
will probably lie between Morrison,
Poulsen, and Dixon Smith, any of
whom should be capable of learning
to stop the majority of tries at the
basket, but Slim Carson, the spectacu
lar goal guard of last year's team, will
be greatly missed. For the remaining
two positions, one forward and one
