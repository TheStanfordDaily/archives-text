# LIGHT TEAM DROPS GAME TO SAN JOSE ALUMNI 19 TO 17
## 
### 
Although nosed out by a 19 to 17
score by the Sair Jose Alumni Club
team, the Stanford 145-pound basket
ball team showed a greatly improved
style of play last night, and kept the
result of the game in doubt until the
final gun had sounded.
At the end of the first half the 45's
led by a 9 to 8 score, due largely to
the shooting of Newcomb and Blazier.
Throughout the second half the leads
from club to weight team,
until a foul shot made in the last few
minutes gave the clubmen a two-point
lead which the Stanford players could
not overcome.
The Alumni Club had won a consid
erable reputation by defeating the
Santa Clara varsity a short time ago,
and they were doped to walk away
with last night's game, but the 45's
started out with a rush, the offense
working well.
The greatest improvement to be
noted in the weight men's work was
in the shooting department. Sanders,
with six points, Newcomb with five,
and Blazier with four were all shoot
ing well.
Ankele, standing guard, played a
stellar defensive game against the
taller and heavier forwards of the club
team.
