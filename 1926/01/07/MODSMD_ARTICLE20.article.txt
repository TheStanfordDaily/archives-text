# Women and Weeds
## 
### 
Another "weed" seems to have incorporated itself into the life of a
modern maid other than the ancient "widow's weeds." Ihe tobacco weed,
if we would take the word of many school authorities, is becoming an in
stitution in the make-up of the present-day girl, and has come to stay, say
many of the maids themselves.
Wellesley and Bryn Mawr have come to the front by refusing to super
vise the practice of girls' smoking and the latter even goes so far as to pro
vide a smoking room in each dormitory. In removing an old rule against
indulgence in cigarettes, the action of the Bryn Mawr self-government as
sociation elicited the following statement from President Parks:
"I agree with the overwhelming majority of the self-government asso
ciation, a majority made up of many students who do not smoke them
selves, or wish to smoke, that no democracy can keep on its books a
regulation which stands apart from its other regulations in that it is no
longer resting solidly on intelligent public opinion."
So much for those directly affected. But what do the others say? The
girls of Massachusetts Tech, after clamoring for liberty in the matter, did
not want to smoke when given their freedom. Seventy-five per cent of
the women of Coe College would smoke if given the chance but their presi
dent denies it to them, saying that "it is not a question of women's rights
.... or morals, but a matter of taste, of useless expense, and of health."
The Daily Northwestern throws down the gauntlet of battle by ex
claiming that among women "cigarette smoking is an imbecility. College
women do not smoke for enjoyment. They smoke to be smart. It is
ridiculous and disgusting because it is a pose."
And so down the line with a majority of college editors perhaps all
of them men—against the practice. Why ? Most of them on the grounds
of health. Morality, being merely conventionalized taste, might enter into
the battle if there was a standardized opinion on the use of cigaiettes.
With changing ideas and indifferent taste in the matter, it might be said
that it is good taste for a woman to smoke, in private or even in public.
But with the pendulum of social usage constantly on the move this point
of morality is debatable.
On the matter of health, cigarette smoking can easily make itself de
serving of the Daily Northwestern's rebuke. Young women are affected
much sooner by the nicotine than men and with the added fact that some
girls seem not to be able to smoke in moderation, the practice soon becomes
"an imbecility." Like fashions in dress, there has arisen the fashion of
smoking—and from a fashion it has grown into a rage through the
novelty-seeking appetites of the girl of flapper age or a little more. Far
more dangerous to health than the occasional "drag' of the boy is the im
moderate use of the girl.
Where a woman really enjoys a cigarette and where she can limit the
number she consumes a day, then let her smoke —all well and good. It is
a matter of taste and if she uses moderation it is nobody's business. But,
where a woman is awkward in her use of the cigarette, where she starts
smoking to ape and not for enjoyment, or where she becomes an inveterate
fiend for no reason at all—then she should be spanked and made to quit—
because she is injuring her health, her nerves, and making a fool of herself.
