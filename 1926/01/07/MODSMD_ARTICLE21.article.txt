The average college student looks on the widespread attempts to edu
cate him on the world court question with an indifferent attitude and prob
ably with this phrase in his mind—"so's your old man." A group of
leaders in the east are working to get the opinion of a nation of students
upon the question, and two Stanford leaders have recently returned from
a confab attended by representatives of colleges throughout the country.
Despite the hubbub most of us remain in blissful ignorance, caring
little whether we have a world court, a League of Nations, or decide in
ternational questions by means of a ping pong tournament. Admitting
that the world court problem—that of seeking world peace—is one of
serious importance, what have we to say for our own actions ?
Perhaps the lack of interest shows a dangerous tendency. Perhaps
our morals have degenerated until we no longer care what happens outside
of our own little sphere. Perhaps we are engrossed with the wild life
which is popularly supposed to exclusively occupy modern youth's time,
sc that we haven't time to read the newspapers.
A few of us at Stanford voted upon the problem at the polls last quar
ter. Most of us didn't. Probably a majority of those who did didn't know
what they were voting about. The national groups that conducted the
polls have a nice bunch of figures, but tlicy mean very little, other than
that a few students voted. It is another question whether they went into
the question deep enough to give competent decisions on such a complex
matter.
Let the legislators take care of the world court problem. If it is too
big a problem for them, the students should not try to decide for them, be
cause it is a question that should be left to far wiser heads than ours.
