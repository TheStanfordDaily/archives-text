"THE GORILLA"

As a burlesque on the recent mys
tery plays, "The Gorilla," now playing
at the Curran in San Francisco, is a
"wow." And as the product of only
three days' work of a writer who had
never before attempted a stage play,
it is nothing short of marvelous. It is
stated that Spence wrote it in three
days on a bet.
To tell the plot of the play would
not be fair, for it is in the surprises
that the enjoyment lies. True mystery
situations are worked up, only to be
broken again and again by some dash
of side-splitting comedy. Finally the
audience gets to the point where it is
all ready to laugh when the peak of
each situation is reached, and the
author suddenly shifts his tactics and
holds them up in the air with real
mystery, then as suddenly lets them
down again when it is least expected.
The big suspense is successfully held
right up to the last, as it should be.
However, the end is one of the two
spots in which the play is weak and
shows both a lack of maturity in stage
work and the shortness of time in
which the work was done. The climax
is worked up in a truly finished man
ner, but after it is reached, the ex
planation and bringing together the
loose ends of the plot is a decided
drop. In fact, the last scene could be
entirely left out and the audience bet
ter pleased thereby.
The other weak point is the old
darky's death scene. It is the only
sickly sentiment in the play, and near
j ly ruins it for the moment. The only
j excuse for the scene would be that it
i gives the negro a good chance for
I some sob stuff. It doesn't belong at all.
Lon Hascall, of the "Follies," and
Harry T. Shannon, the two dumb de
tectives, completely carry the show.
They are the "whole thing," one might
say. They are continually doing the
wrong thing and getting the stage all
cluttered up. There are enough wise
cracks gotten off during the perform
ance to keep a college student busy
jotting them down to remember.
