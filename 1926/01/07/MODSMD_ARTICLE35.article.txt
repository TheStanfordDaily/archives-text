# DAY'S DOINGS

<$> Ted Ellas. Jr. *
Now we're settled in our classes,
After Christmas and vacation,
Plugging at the daily grind, to
Build ourselves a reputation.
Varsity is working harder,
Than it's ever worked before,
'Gainst Pomona, Friday evening,
They will roll a mighty score.
Tommorw morning there's assembly,
Where Durand will speak to us,
"Presidential Air Committee,"
And perhaps the Mitchell fuss.
Mildred Worswick is among us,
After an extended journey.
Papers carry headlines now,
Both "Pro" and Con about our Ernie,
Chappie now is getting ready,
For this quarter's first edition;
Thackery's immortal story
Gains the Chappie's recognition.
