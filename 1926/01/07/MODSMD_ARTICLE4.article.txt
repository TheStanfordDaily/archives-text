Three earnest Ernests nested
at the gate and cashed in on
two free tickets apiece to the
forthcoming production, "The
Importance of Being Earnest." It
was important to them. The idea
was carried out by the Dramatic
Council to increase interest in
this lively comedy. The lucky
men were Ernest Potts, Earnest
Guffin, and Ernest Wagner.
Shortly after the three lucky
ones had been awarded the An
nie Oakleys, in came other earn
est fellows. Twelve more were
tallied before the count was
dropped. It is rumored that
comps were sent to Nevers, the
most Ernest, or what have you?
Truly, it was a "Wilde party. So's
your old man.
