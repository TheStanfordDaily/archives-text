# NOVELTY PROGRAM TO REPLACE USUAL GLEE CLUB CONCERT
## Vaudeville Revue Consists of Twelve Clever Acts and Many Stars 
### 
Announcing the piece de resistance
of the Novelties program to be pre
sented in the Assembly hall on Friday
night, January 15, four feminine guest
artistes will present acts written
and staged around their own person
alities and talents. The list is enough
to insure a packed house at any dra
matic production and they will round
out the well-balanced program ar
ranged.
Peggy Randall will lend herself and
her charming voice to the Hawaiian
number —the setting of which will be
designed by Leslie Kiler. Miss Ran
dall has been prominent in dramatics,
taking leading roles ever since her
debut in "Dulcy." The Hawaiian ele
ment on the Hawaiian number will
also be introduced by Moreno, Fay,
Foote & Co., with their now famous
stringed trio.
Allen and Burks Sing
Marjorio Allen and Aileene Burks
are the queens of a number all their
own, and the scenic surprises of this
act are not to be revealed until Nov
elties Night. They will sing numbers
together which will do much to create
a popular acclaim for themselves as a
duet. The list of plays in which these
young ladies have starred would mean
a citation of virtually all the plays
since their debut in Captain Apple
jack.
Dorothy Dahler, considered by many
to be the most adroit comedienne on
the campus, will present a song num
ber of the type for which she is most
popular. Miss Dahler is also a well
established campus celebrity. Her
plays are many in number, her suc
cesses being equal to her attempts.
Comedy Act Planned
Delmer Daves has written a skit
whose locale is the lodge temple of the
Ancient Order of the Wheel Whose
Every Spoke is a Standard of Truth.
Dorothy Dahler will also assist in this
number—being the President of the
Woman's Auxiliary of the Lodge of the
Red Screaming Eagles Who Fly by
Night. The nature of the act is broad
comedy, Daves being the Exalted
Keeper of The Opal Gate.
Hal Boone, Van King and Co. will
present a dancing act with the Glee i
Club orchestra. They are
the reigning kings of the hot foot on
the campus, having scored immediate
and great success in tho recent Foot
ball Show.
Rehearsals Start
The one serious number of the pro
gram will be a dramatization of the j

Volga Boat Song sung and portrayed ,
by the men of the Glee Club. A unified j
effect of scenic beauty and musical
power will serve to make this number
remembered for many years.
Rehearsals are being held for these
and the others of the twelve acts —all
of which are being whipped into tip
top shape.

out the well-balanced program ar
ranged.
Peggy Randall will lend herself and
her charming voice to the Hawaiian
number —the setting of which will be
designed by Leslie Kiler. Miss Ran
dall has been prominent in dramatics,
taking leading roles ever since her
debut in "Dulcy." The Hawaiian ele
ment on the Hawaiian number will
also be introduced by Moreno, Fay,
Foote & Co., with their now famous
stringed trio.
Allen and Burks Sing
Marjorio Allen and Aileene Burks
are the queens of a number all their
own, and the scenic surprises of this
act are not to be revealed until Nov
elties Night. They will sing numbers
together which will do much to create
a popular acclaim for themselves as a
duet. The list of plays in which these
young ladies have starred would mean
a citation of virtually all the plays
since their debut in Captain Apple
jack.
Dorothy Dahler, considered by many
to be the most adroit comedienne on
the campus, will present a song num
ber of the type for which she is most
popular. Miss Dahler is also a well
established campus celebrity. Her
plays are many in number, her suc
cesses being equal to her attempts.
Comedy Act Planned
Delmer Daves has written a skit
whose locale is the lodge temple of the
Ancient Order of the Wheel Whose
Every Spoke is a Standard of Truth.
Dorothy Dahler will also assist in this
number—being the President of the
Woman's Auxiliary of the Lodge of the
Red Screaming Eagles Who Fly by
Night. The nature of the act is broad
comedy, Daves being the Exalted
Keeper of The Opal Gate.
Hal Boone, Van King and Co. will
present a dancing act with the Glee i
Club orchestra. They are
the reigning kings of the hot foot on
the campus, having scored immediate
and great success in tho recent Foot
ball Show.
Rehearsals Start
The one serious number of the pro
gram will be a dramatization of the j

Volga Boat Song sung and portrayed ,
by the men of the Glee Club. A unified j
effect of scenic beauty and musical
power will serve to make this number
remembered for many years.
Rehearsals are being held for these
and the others of the twelve acts —all
of which are being whipped into tip
top shape.
Announcing the piece de resistance

sented in the Assembly hall on Friday
