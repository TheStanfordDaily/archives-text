# WORSWICK RETURNS FROM INSPECTION OF EASTERN COLLEGES
## Women's President to Report On Visit at Quarterly Conference Party 
### 
Mildred Worswick, president of As- j
sociated Women Students, returned!
yesterday from a month's visit in the
East, during which she attended the j
National Collegiate World Court Con- !
ference, and visited many of the East- j
ern women's colleges for ideas in stu- j
dent self-government and life.
Bryn Mawr, Vassar, Smith, Russell-'
Sage, Radcliffe, and Barnard were vis- j
ited and their situations studied. Miss j
Worswick was investigating certain j
topics on which Women's Conference
wished to be informed, and she will j
make a report to that body on her
findings in the near future.
"After visiting these colleges," said
Miss Worswick, "I think that Stanford j
women should be thankful that they !
i are in a university which gives them J
j so much freedom. The regulations in i
j the Eastern colleges are far stricter
: than they are here and are quite de-'
! tailed. The women find themselves
| shut in a great deal of the time. Life
|in these institutions is centered in
j the college to such an extent that the
j women find themselves in a complete-]
| ly different atmosphere when they go j
I out into the world and they have to '
j go through a period of readjustment." j
"Bryn Mawr had the most beautifulj
campus and buildings of the colleges '
j I visited," continued Miss Worswick. i
i
| "On the whole, though, the women
| and the government seemed much the
i same in these colleges. I saw no dormi
j tories as convenient as Roble though
| some had larger lobbies and first-floor
! accommodations."
A distinctive difference in the stu
: dent government at these colleges and
jat Stanford is that the executive and
j the judicial departments are separated
j there. Different women are at the head
jof what would correspond to our
j Women's Council and Associated
| Women Students.
j "It is surprising to find that there
is little opportunity for the women '
to work their way through college in
the East," said Miss Worswick. "The j
women are not allowed to wait on j
table at these colleges, as servants,
in some cases negroes, are employed
to do this work."
Miss Worswick will give a full re
port of her trip, including both the
World Court Conference and her find
-1
! ings in the colleges, at the quarterly
J conference party which will be held
I next Wednesday evening. Miss Wors
wick was one of the Stanford dele
gates to the conference at Princeton,
| where she served on the committee
i for forming a permanent national stu
j dent organization.

Bryn Mawr, Vassar, Smith, Russell-'
Sage, Radcliffe, and Barnard were vis- j
ited and their situations studied. Miss j
Worswick was investigating certain j
topics on which Women's Conference
wished to be informed, and she will j
make a report to that body on her
findings in the near future.
"After visiting these colleges," said
Miss Worswick, "I think that Stanford j
women should be thankful that they !
i are in a university which gives them J
j so much freedom. The regulations in i
j the Eastern colleges are far stricter
: than they are here and are quite de-'
! tailed. The women find themselves
| shut in a great deal of the time. Life
|in these institutions is centered in
j the college to such an extent that the
j women find themselves in a complete-]
| ly different atmosphere when they go j
I out into the world and they have to '
j go through a period of readjustment." j
"Bryn Mawr had the most beautifulj
campus and buildings of the colleges '
j I visited," continued Miss Worswick. i
i
| "On the whole, though, the women
| and the government seemed much the
i same in these colleges. I saw no dormi
j tories as convenient as Roble though
| some had larger lobbies and first-floor
! accommodations."
A distinctive difference in the stu
: dent government at these colleges and
jat Stanford is that the executive and
j the judicial departments are separated
j there. Different women are at the head
jof what would correspond to our
j Women's Council and Associated
| Women Students.
j "It is surprising to find that there
is little opportunity for the women '
to work their way through college in
the East," said Miss Worswick. "The j
women are not allowed to wait on j
table at these colleges, as servants,
in some cases negroes, are employed
to do this work."
Miss Worswick will give a full re
port of her trip, including both the
World Court Conference and her find
-1
! ings in the colleges, at the quarterly
J conference party which will be held
I next Wednesday evening. Miss Wors
wick was one of the Stanford dele
gates to the conference at Princeton,

i for forming a permanent national stu
j dent organization.
Mildred Worswick, president of As- j
sociated Women Students, returned!
yesterday from a month's visit in the
East, during which she attended the j
National Collegiate World Court Con- !
ference, and visited many of the East- j
ern women's colleges for ideas in stu- j
dent self-government and life.
