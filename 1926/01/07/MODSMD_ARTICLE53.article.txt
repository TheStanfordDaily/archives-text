# Washington May Have New School for Consular Work
## 
### 
Sponsored by Dean Gould of the de
partment of education of the Univer
sity of Washington, there has been
started a movement for the creation
of a school for consuls.
The university, although it furnishes
through its departments of law, politi
cal science, history, economics, lang
uages, maritime commerce, and mathe
matics most of the training which
candidates for diplomatic positions
must have feels that the need could
be better satisfied by a separate
school.
