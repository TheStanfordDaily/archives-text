# Brigham Young Freshmen Paddle Sophomore Officer
## 
### 
As crowning events to Freshman
day, Constable Lawrence Curtis of the
sophomore class at Brigham Young
University, was given the official fresh
man paddle. Immediately after the
cap-burning ceremony, all frosh men
seemed imbued with but one purpose
â€”to demonstrate to the sophomores
their hearty appreciation for all fa
vors, past and present.
Curtis made it possible for the green
lings to give vent to their enthusiasm.
With little or no warning, Curtis was
surrounded, held fast by husky fresh
men, and the paddle administered by
each member desiring that honor.
Feeling that this was not sufficient
manifestation of gratitude to sopho
more officials, the newly emancipated
crowd instituted a search for the
sophomore president, but he was not
to be found.
