# Johns Hopkins Discontinues Baseball as Varsity Sport
## 
### 
Baseball was dropped as an inter
collegiate sport at a recent meeting of
the Johns Hopkins University Ath
letic Board.
. The reason for the discontinuance
of "The Great American Sport" was
due to the growing lack of interest
shown by the student body in recent
years. Lacrosse and other spring
sports now occupy the place that was
once baseball's.
The game will not become extinct
at Johns Hopkins, however, for there
will be a league formed between
classes in order to give those inter
ested in the game a chance to show
their prowess.
