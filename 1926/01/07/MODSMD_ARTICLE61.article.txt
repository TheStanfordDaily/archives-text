# HONOR SYSTEM IS PROBED BY EASTERN UNIVERSITY WOMEN
## 
### 
Representatives from sixty student
government associations met at Wel
lesley college for the annual confer
ence of the Women's Intercollegiate
Association for Self Government, and
intensively discussed the honor sys
tem. It was the consensus of opinion
that the most serious difficulty was
the students' unwillingness to assume
the responsibility of reporting misde
meanors.
The Cornell Sun lists eight accusa
tions of the Honor System, as operated
at present there:
(1) The disturbances, conversation,
whistling, etc., in classrooms where
the Honor System is in force.
(2) Leniency of student honor com
mittee.
(3) Wrong student attitude toward
faculty: "If you do so and so we will
be honest. If you do not we will try
to get away with anything we can."
(4) Slow, ponderous mechanism of
System.
(5) Impossibility of trying June vio
lations until September. "A senior may
have received his degree and gone to
the ends of the earth. What are you
going to do about him?"
(6) Unadvisability of permitting
students to fix academic penalties.
"Does an undergraduate generally
have the knowledge of curricula to
decide whether a student should lose
credit in three hours of six hours or
take other courses as prerequisites or
decide upon various other academic
penalties as has been done in the
past?"
(7) The Honor System is built upon
an undesirable trait in human nature
â€”that of spying upon and reporting
other students. In the first place, most
students when they come into an exam
ination room have no time to look
about them. They must concentrate on
their own work. Secondly, few persons
care to squeal about others, and many
a student who by chance observes a
violation, does not report it for this
very reason. "This business of setting
a man to spy upon his fellow is uni
versally unpopular and unsatisfac
tory."
(8) The mere routine of the work
of the honor committees requires too
much time of the members of these
committees. Time and again commit
tees will sit throughout an 'evening
hearing a case. No inconsiderable im
position is made upon the time of un
dergraduates when they must meet
often, thus depriving these students of
an opportunity for study.
