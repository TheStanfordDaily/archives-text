Code of Ethics
Besides a detailed discussion of the
phases of fraternity life in American
colleges the undergraduate council
drew up and passed a code of ethics
which were considered as advanta
geous for all fraternity groups to fol
low.
Believing it advisable to promote
better co-operation between fraterni
ties and thinking it to the best in
terests of the individual fraternities
we do hereby submit the following
resolution:
Rules Laid Down
1. That it be unethical to pledge a
man who has not been regularly en
rolled on the books of the institution,
paid the initial registration fee, and
been resident at least one day at the
institution at the opening of a regular
semester.
2. That it shall be unethical for a
member of one fraternity to encourage
a pledge of another fraternity to break
his pledge and that it shall be unethi
cal for one house to pledge a man who
has broken his pledge to another house
until a period of six months has
elapsed unless a faculty ruling is other
wise.
3. That undergraduate members dis
countenance alumni assistance in
pledging.
Hazing Banned
4. That no part of initiation should
include a public demonstration or in
volve any dangerous physical violence
to the neophyte.
5. That political interfraternity
combines be deprecated.
6. That it shall be unethical for any
fraternity to maliciously damage the
reputation of another.
The council recommended that the
spirit as well as the letter of the rules
be upheld and that no fraternity pledge
be initiated until he has made a satis
factory scholastic standing.
