# BARNARD COLLEGE PHYSICIAN ADVISES WOMEN WHO SMOKE
## 
### Monroe Eaton 
Smoking among college women has i
become such a well-established custom j
; at Barnard College that rules for the j
; purpose of adjusting instead of pro-!
hibiting it are being considered by j
the college authorities. Dr. Guliema l
F. Alsop, college physician, has pre- i
pared a list of nine unofficial rules
for the benefit of women students at \
Barnard College who persist in in- j
j vading the heretofore sacred domain
I of male enjoyment.
The rules on how, when, and where
to smoke are designed to guide college
girls and to prevent them from falling ;
into mistaken paths such as attempts I
! at cigar or pipe smoking. Some of the i
; rules, presumably intended as advice !
! to the beginner, suggest that smoking ;
' after dinner, out-of-doors, and with
the use of a holder is wisest.
Inhaling and blowing through the
j nose are severely frowned upon in !
rules five and six. Another rule planes i
the maximum number of cigarettes to '
; be smoked in one day at five. In order
that college women may "open them
up," one rule describes how good to
| bacco should appear.
Rule one sets the age for matricula
tion in the art of smoking at twenty
one. It is also advised that a woman
be examined by a physician before
i she starts in order to determine if
smoking will be injurious. The last
rule suggests a complete rest from
smoking of one month a year, presum
ably to get in condition for the college
season.
