# ANDREW L. SMITH U.C. COACH DIES SUDDENLY IN EASE
## COACHED WONDER TEAM Former Mentor Has Relapse While Recovering From Pneumonia 
### 
Andrew Latham "Andy" Smith, head
football coach at the University of
California for the past ten years, died
unexpectedly at 6:48 o'clock this
morning at the University of Pennsyl
vania hospital in Philadelphia of pul
monary abscess following bronchial
pneumonia. His death came as a great
shock, as he was believed to be well
Â«on the road to recovery from an illness
which began December 19. The end
-came as a result of a relapse which
he suffered last night.
Smith went East on the same train
with Pop Warner to attend the Penn
sylvania-Cornell game on Thanksgiv
ing Day, and was stricken while at
the Bellevue-Stratford hotel in Phila
delphia. He was removed to the hos
pital December 19 and attended by
Robert G. Torrey, former Pennsylva
nia football star.
Friends at Deathbed
Dr. Torrey and William Hollenback,
the latter also a classmate of Smith's,
were with him when he died. Funeral
arrangements have not been com
pleted, but it is likely that the Uni
versity of Pennsylvania will take a
prominent part in the final tribute to
the man who was one of her greatest
gridiron stars.
Born and reared in Dubois, Penn.,
Smith attended Pennsylvania College,
where he played in the varsity back
field in 1901, and then transferred to
the University of Pennsylvania. He
played fullback for the latter institu- j
tion in 1903 and 1904, and was selected
for the all-American team his last
year.
After coaching the Penn freshman
eleven in 1905, he was appointed as
sistant varsity coach the following sea
son. From 1909 to 1912 Smith was head
mentor. He accepted a position as
head coach at Purdue University in
1913, and remained there until the
close of the 1915 season, during which
time he raised the standard of Pur
due's football.
Came West in 1916
Smith was brought to the Pacific
Coast in 1916 by Johnny Stroud, then
graduate manager at the University
of California. Rugby was the Bears'
big fall sport, but the new coach
interested his athletes in the Ameri
can game. After drilling his squad in
the fundamentals for three years, he
started to turn out formidable teams.
In 1918, under Smith's tutelage, Cali
fornia began a winning streak over
Stanford which lasted through 1923.
Between 1921 and 1925 the Bears did
not lose a game to any team, although
they were tied several times, and
Smith's elevens were dubbed the
"wonder teams."
In spite of rumors which received
considerable publicity recently to the
effect that California was dissatisfied
with Smith, he was a few weeks ago
offered a new four-year contract by
that university, which he intended to
sign. He was respected and admired
by Berkeley faculty and students as
"a fine gentleman and an able coach,"
and his death is deeply felt on the
California campus.

More than 40 per cent of the Oberlin
students do their Christmas shopping
in Oberlin.
