"Oh, where, oh where, has our
little skunk gone?" has been the
chief cry of members of Theta
Xi fraternity for the past week.
During vacation, their pet skunk,
which serves as mascot, and their
chief pride and joy, was locked
up in the attic for safe-keeping.
After vacation, Ambrose, or
Percival, was not to be found.
In vain did the knight errants
search the attic from cobweb to
cobweb. Finally faint scratchings
were heard which seemed to be
coming from between two of the
walls. A few of the industrious
searchers finally trapped the ani
mal. Poor Ambrose's reign of the
upper regions is now over, and
he is supreme king of the base
ment. The members of the house
declare Ambrose is no bother at
all, except that listerine is his
chief food, and the drug bill
threatens to increase alarmingly.
