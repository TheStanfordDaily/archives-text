# DR. JORDAN SPEAKS ON NEWSPAPER USE OF SCIENTIFIC FACTS
## Stanford Leader Ridicules "Famous Discoveries" in Thursday Lecture 
### 
"Newspaper science is made up largely
of spread out and colored up statements
of noted scientists in which the sensa
tional side is played up to catch the pub
lic eye," said Dr. Jordan in his Thursday
evening conference last night, discussing
newspaper science. "Oftentimes reputed
scientific discoveries or theories are at
tributed to 'famous' scientists whom no
body has ever heard of."
Dr. Jordan had a number of clippings
with him of these so-called scientific ar
ticles, and read excerpts from them. "It
it good journalism to lie, when a good
story can be made by lying," he remarked
with a twinkle in his eye, "but it is not
good journalism to lie too obviously." He
made this statement just before reading
an obviously preposterous article clipped
from a Seattle paper, in which a species
of bird called the porcupine owl was de
scribed. This remarkable owl is blind,
and steers itself around by listening to the
echoes of its own voice, which is described
as being similar to the whistle of a steam
boat. The bird also has quills on it, giv
ing rise to the name. It cannot fly, but
protects itself from enemies by its spiny
covering. "This was solemnly stated in
the newspaper," said Jordan, "and was
probably swallowed for the truth by many
credulous readers."
Horoscopes for Idiots
He ridiculed the astrology departments
that a majority of newspapers conduct.
"Horoscopes are plainly written for
idiots; there must be a good many of
them, though, or the papers wouldn't give
up so much valuable advertising space to
astrology," he said. "There is only one
true prediction of the astrologists that I
know of: that if you are born under the
influence of Scorpion, and buy oil stocks,
you'll get stung."
Other scientific statements which he
discussed as "newspaper science" con
cerned the prediction and the false reasons
for the cause of earthquakes; the ex
ploded idea that transplanted ductless
glands gave permanent rejuvenation; the
much discussed spiritualists' world; the
theory of the type of population on Mars;
the many conflicting statements of various
"scientists" on the importance of heredity;
the theory that we think with our whole
bodies and not just with our brain.
Newspapers Exaggerate
He declared that some of this news
paper science was truthful, but that the
tendency is to over-exaggerate the sensa
tional parts. Much of it, he says, is very
insignificant as far as real scientific work
1 is concerned.
Dr. Jordan announced the topics of the
J Thursday conferences for the next two
j weeks. Next Thursday evening, January
i 14, he will talk on "The Value of the
j Two-Party System as Compared with
the Bloc System"; on January 21, on
"Spanish Missions."
