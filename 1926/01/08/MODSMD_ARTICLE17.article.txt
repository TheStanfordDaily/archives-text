# HIGH SCHOLARSHIP AVERAGE MADE BY FRESHMAN CLASS
## Scholarship Average Raised By Requirement to Pass Intelligence Test 
### 
This year's freshman class has made
an unusually high scholastic record,
according to the report of the Scholar
ship Committee issued this morning.
In view of the disturbed week of the
bonfire and the Big Game, this is con
sidered especially significant of the
increasing level of ability in the en
tering classes.
The complete figures for the fall
quarter just ended show that 11 fresh
men were disqualified and G3 placed
on probation. Out of the rest of the
school, including graduates, 68 were
disqualified and 135 placed on proba
tion, making a total of 79 failures and
198 probations. Only one of the fail
ures was among the women, the one
being a freshman.
For the same quarter last year 20
freshmen failed and 75 went on proba
tion. Failures among the rest of the
school for the same period reached
48, and the probations 217. For the
fall quarter of 1923-24 an entire total
of 61 went out while 24t> were put on
probation. Again in 1922-23, 76 out of
the whole school were disqualified at
Christmas, and 280 placed on proba
tion. The records of the fall quarter of
1921-22 show a total of 97 failures and
325 probations.
It seems apparent from these rec
ords that the number of failures at
Stanford are dropping, likewise the
number of those dropping low enough
to go on probation. This is especially
true in the records of the freshman
classes. While it is believed that a
number of different factors are re
sponsible for this rise, it seems that
the intelligence tests which have been
required for the last two years are of
particular significance.
