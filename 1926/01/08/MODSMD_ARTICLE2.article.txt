# TROTTER'S RETURN STRENGTHENS 1926 VARSITY POLO FOUR
## 
### 
Hopes for the 1926 polo season are I
snucli brighter since the return of
•Captain Fred Trotter, No. 4 man, to
the varsity squad. Trotter, who was
out last quarter with a broken arm,
will return about January 25, when
the next contest will be played. He is
;a very active man on the defense, and
his return promises tighter playing in
this department of the game.
In addition to this advantage, the
offense will be strengthened by the
return of John Irwin to Stanford polo.
Irwin is one of the best No. 2 men to
play for the Cardinal. The playing of
these men will give the team the
necessary punch to make it a winning
combination.
Polo was started this year with an
enrollment of forty men. Two squads
were found, one of twelve and the
other of twenty-eight members. The
first squad was soon made into three
teams so as to afford the varsity twice
as much practice and more variety of
play.
C. O. Thompson is expected to make
a strong bid for varsity recognition
this quarter, as his playing is good
and consistent.
For the benefit of those who know
little of the game, an explanation in
brief follows. A slight analogy can be
•drawn between it and basketball. No.'s
I and 2 correspond to basketball for
wards, while No.'s 3 and 4 act in
positions resembling guards. No. 2 is
the most active, as No. 1 must take
the opposing No. 4 out of the play.
No. 4 plays a sort of standing guard,
holding his position to protect the
.goal. No. 3 plays "running guard," as
he aids the forwards on offense, and
the guarding on defense.
