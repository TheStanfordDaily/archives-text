# AIR BOM FINDS DEFENSES ADEQUATE STATES DURAND
## Stanford Professor Tells of Investigation at Assembly 
### 
"The investigations of the Pesident's
air board proved that America's air de
fenses compare favorably with those of
any other country. In fact, in the ratio
of air force to land force numbers this
country is better situated than either
France or Great Britain," said Professor
William Frederick Durand in his talk on
"The Work of the President's Air Board,"
at the assembly this morning at 9 o'clock.
Professor Durand emeritus of the Me
chanical Engineering Department, was
chosen by President Coolidge as one of
nine members on a hoard to make a sur
vey of the air service. Durand was picked
as secretary of the board which heard
ninety-nine witnesses in the first month of
its session and spent the next month and a
half in consideration and analysis of the
large mass of testimony, amounting to
over one million words. In his talk Pro
fessor Durand gave the student body the
benefit of his first-hand and authentic in
formation on the subject.
Dr. Wilbur presented Professor Durand
who gave a brief sketch of the history and
purposes of the board. The president de
sired the board to do two things: first, to
present to him their recommendations
which he passed on to Congress in his
message, and second to enable the public
to get a true idea of the conditions act
ually prevailing in the air service which
had been subject to all sorts of charges
from the press and individual critics.
Three proposals the board took up for
consideration were rejected. The sug
gestcd formation of a single Department
of National Defense with power over the
army, navy, air service, and civilian in
dustries connected with defense, was op
posed because it was held contrary to the
established policy of America to keep in
dustry and civilian activity free from
militaristic control. A modified form of
Defense Department to include only the
army, navy, and air force was held un
necessary for the president as commander
in-chief in time of war already lias power
to unite the army and navy under single_
control and has done so in both the Civil
War and the Great War.
Proposals Rejected
A third proposal, to create an aviation
department along with the army and navy
lias been the subject of considerable agi
tation in the daily press, according to
Durand, but the board decided against
recommending it. "The army and navy
are separate departments with differing
functions," he said, "and both need their
own airplanes to carry their work out. To
concentrate the control of all aircraft in a
separate department would create friction
and hamper the work of all branches. It
would be equivalent to setting up a sepa
rate arm of service based on one particu
lar instrument of warfare."
Unrest Caused Trouble
The board did, however, make several
important positive recommendations which
are expected to receive favorable action
from Congress. "We found that a large
part of the trouble in both army and navy
air services was due to discontent and un
rest among the fliers and could be reme
died by administrative action within the
service. We accordingly recommended
that assistant secretaries be appointed in
both army and navy who would have the
specific duty of attending to the air service
and their needs with special regard to see
ing that fliers received adequate recogni
tion and promotion."
An assistant secretary was also recom
mended for the Department of Commerce
to aid and foster development of civilian
aircraft and the aircraft industry.

air board proved that America's air de
fenses compare favorably with those of
any other country. In fact, in the ratio
of air force to land force numbers this
country is better situated than either
France or Great Britain," said Professor
William Frederick Durand in his talk on
"The Work of the President's Air Board,"
at the assembly this morning at 9 o'clock.
Professor Durand emeritus of the Me
chanical Engineering Department, was
chosen by President Coolidge as one of
nine members on a hoard to make a sur
vey of the air service. Durand was picked
as secretary of the board which heard
ninety-nine witnesses in the first month of
its session and spent the next month and a
half in consideration and analysis of the
large mass of testimony, amounting to
over one million words. In his talk Pro
fessor Durand gave the student body the
benefit of his first-hand and authentic in
formation on the subject.
Dr. Wilbur presented Professor Durand
who gave a brief sketch of the history and
purposes of the board. The president de
sired the board to do two things: first, to
present to him their recommendations
which he passed on to Congress in his
message, and second to enable the public
to get a true idea of the conditions act
ually prevailing in the air service which
had been subject to all sorts of charges
from the press and individual critics.
Three proposals the board took up for
consideration were rejected. The sug
gestcd formation of a single Department
of National Defense with power over the
army, navy, air service, and civilian in
dustries connected with defense, was op
posed because it was held contrary to the
established policy of America to keep in
dustry and civilian activity free from
militaristic control. A modified form of
Defense Department to include only the
army, navy, and air force was held un
necessary for the president as commander
in-chief in time of war already lias power
to unite the army and navy under single_
control and has done so in both the Civil
War and the Great War.
Proposals Rejected
A third proposal, to create an aviation
department along with the army and navy
lias been the subject of considerable agi
tation in the daily press, according to
Durand, but the board decided against
recommending it. "The army and navy
are separate departments with differing
functions," he said, "and both need their
own airplanes to carry their work out. To
concentrate the control of all aircraft in a
separate department would create friction
and hamper the work of all branches. It
would be equivalent to setting up a sepa
rate arm of service based on one particu
lar instrument of warfare."
Unrest Caused Trouble
The board did, however, make several
important positive recommendations which
are expected to receive favorable action
from Congress. "We found that a large
part of the trouble in both army and navy
air services was due to discontent and un
rest among the fliers and could be reme
died by administrative action within the
service. We accordingly recommended
that assistant secretaries be appointed in
both army and navy who would have the
specific duty of attending to the air service
and their needs with special regard to see
ing that fliers received adequate recogni
tion and promotion."
An assistant secretary was also recom
mended for the Department of Commerce
to aid and foster development of civilian
aircraft and the aircraft industry.
