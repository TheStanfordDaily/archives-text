# Harsh Measures?
## 
### 
Two men have been refused registration in the University this quarter
by the Men's Council because of thefts of books from the library. When
the average student hears of this punishment, for an offense seemingly
trifling on its face, he is going to feel that perhaps the Men's Council acted
a bit too harshly. However, as the case was explained to the Daily Palo
Alto the judgment of the council seems justifiable.
One of the men had eight books from the library in his room. In two
of these he had written his own name, clearly showing that he had no in
tention of returning them. The other student had forged the name of an
other to get a book released from the library and in another instance he had
taken a book without signing for it and kept it for a period of long dura
tion. These books, incidentally, were needed for a course in English
Masterpieces, and his failure to return them to the library caused consider
able hardship to other students in the course because they were made
unable to get texts with which to prepare their assignments.
In a communication to the Men's Council, the head of the library said
that a charge of petty larceny would be preferred against each of the men
concerned unless the council took some action. The library has had a
great deal of trouble in the past keeping books on the shelves where they
belong. If the honor system will not work criminal prosecutions must
follow —and the library is almost forced to this step. The action of the
council, however, will save the library the embarrassment of prosecuting
students in the criminal courts, even though it does cause them to be ex
pelled from the University.
The practice of taking books from the library by stealth, fraud, or
carelessness is despicable and unbecoming of Stanford men—or women
for that matter, for some of them are probably just as guilty. The funds
of the library are not unlimited and it was never founded for a student
benefit association. We are privileged to take the books and use them for
the time allotted, but then they should be returned, and no fraudulent de
vices should be used to attain books so that they cannot be traced, should
the borrower fail or forget to return them.
The honor system should keep students from such breaches. If it
can't, we feel that the Men's Council will be capable of taking care of the
matter and seeing that justice is given.
And as an additional thought we might mention the dozens—or even
hundreds—of library books adrift in houses of the various living groups
on the campus at the present time. Perhaps it would be a good plan to
conduct a search party, locate and return the stray volumes before the
library authorities are finally forced by desperation into sending agents
about the campus to run down the borrowers of unreturned books.
