# Andrew L. Smith

A nation of sports lovers was shocked this morning to hear of the death
in Philadelphia of Coach Andrew Latham Smith of the University of
California. He had just completed a most trying football season and his
passing can he attributed to his untiring efforts to coach the California
eleven to success through a season filled with mishaps and upsets, leaving
him in a weakened physical condition.
Smith's death is an almost unreplaceable loss to the University of Cali
fornia. More than that, it is a real blow to Pacific Coast football, for it
was he who centered the eyes of a country upon the teams on this coast.
When he came to California in 1916 little attention was paid to western
football by those in the east. Soon he was turning out "wonder" teams
which defeated everything in the west and the best from other sections.
It was then that the nation realized what a power he was as a football coach.
His record of five successive years without a defeat will stand for a
long time. As a football mentor he has been equalled but never surpassed.
During his seasons of unsmirched success he was always unassuming and
never conceited, but gave opponents due credit for their efforts. And when
his teams were finally defeated, Andy Smith showed himself a true si>ort.
He took defeat with a smile and never failed to congratulate the victor and
comment upon the latter's better playing.
Andy Smith has carved for himself a permanent niche in the sports
hall of fame. Both as a player and as a coach he showed unusual capa
bilities. Although he is no more he has builded well and his work will con
tinue to reflect in the California varsities of the next few years. The
Daily Palo Alto expresses the sorrow of the Stanford student body.
