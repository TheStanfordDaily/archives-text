BERNIE MANGE MAKES
ANOTHER 100,000
A play by play account of the great
football game between the Pumpkin
Corners Yellowjackets featuring Ber
nie Mange and the Dogtown Horse
flies played at Imain (one of the new
er islands of Florida) on April 1, 1928.
This game was the best exhibition
of professional football seen this year.
Bernie Mange, who is playing fullback
under a contract with the Yellowjack
ets which guarantees him $10,000 for
each yard gained from scrimmage,
played the best game of his profes
sional career.
First Quarter
Bernie Mange won the toss and
elected to defend the north goal and
let one of his players receive the
kickoff. The coin had identical faces
but the captain of the Horseflies did
not know it.
The ball is kicked off and run back
to midfield by one of the players. Time
out for Mange to sign a movie con
tract and take a drink. (He is pro
vided with a special guarded hip pock
et flask).
The ball is again put into play on
the Horseflies' forty-yard line. Mange
throws a magnificent ten-yard forward
pass straight into the air and runs
down the field to receive it. He is
tackled before catching the ball.
Horseflies penalized thirty yards: fif
teen yards for roughing passer and
fifteen yards for interfering with re
ceiver.
Time out for Mange to go to the
box office to see how the ticket sales
are getting along. As Mange is about
to carry the ball on one of his mag
nificent runs the quarter ends. Score:
Yellowjackets 0, Horseflies 0, yards
by Mange 0.
Second Quarter
The ball is put into play on the
Horseflies' ten-and-a-half-yard line. On
four downs the ball is carried to the
one-foot line. First down and one foot
to go. Mange is given the ball. He
hits the line like a ton of brick but
fails to make a touchdown by inches.
(About eleven inches).
On two magnificent bucks Mange
carries the ball to the Horseflies' six
inch line. Fourth down. On a long,
shifting, dodging, squirming end run,
Mange evades the entire Horsefly
team and plunges over the line for a
touchdown. Time out for Mange to
take a smoke. The goal is kicked. As
Mange is about to run back the kick
off for another touchdown the gun
pops for the half. Score: Yellowjackets
7, Horseflies 0.
Third Quarter
In the period between halves Mange
signed three more movie contracts,
turned down several jobs with ice com
panies, and made the statement to the
Press that he plays football just for
a pastime. On the kickoff Mange boots
the ball almost forty yards. Time out
for Mange to get his picture taken
running with the ball. The Horseflies
become offensive and advance the
ball *to the Yellowjackets' thirty-yard
line.
On the next play Mange intercepts
a forward pass in a magnificent man
ner but he makes the mistake of hand
ing the ball to one of the Horsefly
players instead of to the halfback of
his own team to run back with it.
Horseflies, score touchdown and kick
goal. Mange leaves the game in a rage.
The quarter ends ten minutes later.
Score: Yellowjackets 7, Horseflies 7,
Yards by Mange 1.
Fourth Quarter
Mange finds out that he has only
made one yard and decides to play
again. The ball is given to Mange. He
hits the line in his usual brick-like
fashion but fails to make first down by
inches. There was one yard to go.
Substitution: Scurvy for Mange. The
game continues for ten minutes.
With two minutes left and the scores
tied Mange returns to the game
amidst the thundering cheers of the
crowd of press agents. On three at
tempts Mange fails to gain. Half a
minute left to play, and the great
Mange has made only $20,000.
Signals are called. The ball is passed
once more to Mange as the final gun
goes off. Mange is seized with a fierce
energy. His managers yell for the
Horseflies. Twisting, jamming, fighting
like a wild cat, Mange rips through
the paper Horsefly line for a total
gain of eight yards or $80,000. Score
at the end of the game: Yellowjackets
7, Horseflies 7, Mange 100,000.
