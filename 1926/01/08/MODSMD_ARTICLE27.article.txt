Ted Elias, Jr.

Andy Smith of California,
Builder of the wonder teams,
Passed beyond the "Great Divide,"
Into the land of silent dreams.
Stanford joins with California,
In expressing deepest sorrow,
That our friendly enemy
Won't be with us on the morrow.
Fifty cents is "What Price Glory"
At the "Earnest Ernie" play;
If the roughs would purchase tickets,
That's the price they'll have to pay.
Theta Xi's have had their troubles,
With a cat that ran away;
Kitty, kitty, Where's our kitty?
Is the thing the Theta's say.
Varsity will meet Pomona,
In the basketball pavilion;
They've been really working hard, and
Ought to go just like a million.
