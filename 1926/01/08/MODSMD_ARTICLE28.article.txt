# OWNERS PROTECT CATS
## 
### 
The University of Florida has put a
stop to the wholesale collection of cats
by fraternity pledges who are in the
process of initiation. This action is
due to the numerous complains which
have come in from the various owners.

A press story says that Will Rogers
pays a daily premium of $100 on his
life insurance policies.
