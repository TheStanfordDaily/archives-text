In automobile racing and horse racing two particular
events stand out each year in America above all others.
They are the Memorial Day Race at the Indianapolis
Speedway and the Kentucky Derby at Louisville. Both
occur in May, and the winner of each is entitled to, and
gets, a great deal of gold and a great deal of glory.
Peter de Paolo won the 1925 Memorial Day race with a
Duesenberg car, breaking all records for the 500-mile event
with an average speed of 101.13 miles an hour. De Paolo,
who is a nephew of Ralph de Palma, also won the national
championship, capturing, among other races, the 25(Kmile
classic at Laurel, Maryland.
Frank Elliot, in a Miller Special, won the anuual 250-
mile Thanksgiving Day race at Culver Citv. near Los
Angeles, in the same car in which Jimmy Murphy was
killed in 1924. Elliot set a new record with an average

of 127.87 miles an hour.
Earl Sande, besides winning the Derby on Gifford Cochran's Flying Ebony,
proved one of the four best jockeys of the year, and this in spite of his almost
fatal injury on April 21, was a "front page" piece of news.
Samuel Riddle's American Flag, son of Man-o'-War, was easily the best
three-year old of the year, while the Shoshone Stable's Pompey, winner of
the Belmont Futurity, is ranked as the champion two-year-old of 1925.
H. E. Morris' Manna, ridden by Steve Donoghue, won the famous English
Derby at Epsom Downs.
