### 
Mrs. Ida Shepard Oldroyd, curator of
the Stanford shell collection of the
Geology department, accompanied by
Mr. Oldroyd, will make an extensive

her wtork, "The Marine Shells of the
West Coast of North America," which
identifies and classifies every shell
that has been found and described on
that coast is being published by the
University as the first of the geologi
cal science series of the University
Bulletins. Volume I of this work was
published in September, and Part I of
the second volume is in the hands of
the printer, while the second and con
cluding part is nearly finished.
The Stanford collection of West
Coast shells ranks second only to that
