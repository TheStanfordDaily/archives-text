# MILDRED WORSWICK GIVES OPINION OF STUDENT FEDERATION
## 
### 
"The formation of the National Fed
eration of Students of America is a
step toward better understanding
among nations, and one which will
bring the students of America in
closer contact with the students of
Europe" is the opinion of Mildred
Worswick, president of Associated
Women Students and one of Stanford's
delegates to the recent National Colle
giate World Court Conference.
As a member of the Committee on
Permanent Organization, Miss Wors
wick helped frame the Constitution
whilh was later approved by the Con
ference. The Constitution regarding
the formation of a permanent body
will be offered to all colleges for sanc
tion. The students of the colleges will
take an active part in the decision.
Committee Meets
The Committee met one day before
the Conference to discuss informally
the formation of a permanent Union.
"The Committee felt that the size and
representative nature of the Confer
ence warranted the organization of a
permanent body," declared Miss Wors
wick. "We felt that that organization
should be liberal in every line. It
should not be based on any political,
social, or religious issue as the similar
organizations in Europe are." With
this object in view the committee
formed the Constitution.
The Conference met with two pur
poses in view: first, to express the
mature undergraduate opinion of the
United States on the World Court, and
second, to consider the formation of a
permanent organization through which
undergraduate opinion on national and
international affairs may be effectively
expressed.
Open Discussion Held
The World Court debate, whose par
ticipants were Senator Irvine L. Len
root of Wisconsin, affirmative, and
Clarence Darrow, negative, was a spir
ited session. An open discussion fol
lowed this debate the next day. Ac
cording to Miss Worswick everyone
was so anxious to speak that it was
almost a free-for-all political conven
tion.
Concerning the future of the Federa
tion, Stanford's Women's president be
lieves It is a step toward the attain
ment of world peace insofar as it will
bring the leaders of tomorrow in closer
contact. It will promote a feeling of
sympathy between students in the fu
ture that has not existed heretofore.

The twelve members of the Univer
sity of lowa varsity basketball squad
