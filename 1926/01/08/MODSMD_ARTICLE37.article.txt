# JOURNAL DESCRIBES STANFORD RESEARCH IN PERSONNEL WORK

### 
Stanford's "Program of University
Personnel Research," by Dr. Lewis M.
Terman of the Psychology department,
and Dr. Karl M. Cowdery of the De
partment of Personnel Research, was
published in the Journal of Personnel
Research for November and Decem
ber 1925. This paper gives an interest
ing account of what Stanford has ac
complished and hopes to accomplish
in the way of student personnel work.
In 1921 the University spent $105,000
more than tuition fees on students
who were disqualified due to poor
scholarship, and $230,000 on those stu
dents who were allowed to remain on
probation. The total that the poor stu
dents were costing the University
was equal to a third of its instruction
al budget.
Test Required
A few months later the requirement
of the Thorndike Intelligence Examin
ation was made for all entering stu
dents. The score was not to affect ad
mission, as the test was merely an
experiment. A report was made on
the result of the examinations, and it
was recommended that the test be
required of all desiring matriculation,
and that matriculation be denied any
one whose score was below fifty. This
plan was adopted in the spring of 1924.
In 1924, 1368 candidates took the
examination in competition for 803
places. The average score of the ap
plicants in 1924 was 75.36 and 77.71
this year, in contrast with the average
of 71 of the matriculated students in
1921 and 1922. Now the intelligence
tests may be the deciding factor in
admitting a student. The average of
accepted candidates last year was 78.7
and will probably be eighty or over
this year. Thus the average has been
raised about ten points.
Twenty-eight per cent of the stu
dents in 1921 were placed on proba
tion or disqualified, while in 1924-25,
the first year that admission was based
on the tests, the percentage of poor
scholars dropped to twenty-one and
eight-tenths per cent. This year Stan
ford has appointed Dr. Cowdery as
Director of Personnel Research. He
has a very large field in working with
the various statistics of these tests.
Vocational Tests Used
It is also thought probable that tests
of vocational interest will soon be
come prominent in the University.
They have been found to be very help
ful in really determining the type of
vocation a person is truly interested
in and has ability for. These ought to
abolish second-rate poets who should
have been first-rate Darwins. One
other type of test may soon be at
tempted, the personality test.
Dr. W. V. Bingham of the Personnel
Research Federation of New York says
in "School and Society" of December
19, 1925, that through the elimination
of dullards from the University, Stan
ford had saved the same as the annual
income on $2,000,000.

plan was adopted in the spring of 1924.
In 1924, 1368 candidates took the
examination in competition for 803
places. The average score of the ap
plicants in 1924 was 75.36 and 77.71
this year, in contrast with the average
of 71 of the matriculated students in
1921 and 1922. Now the intelligence
tests may be the deciding factor in
admitting a student. The average of
accepted candidates last year was 78.7
and will probably be eighty or over
this year. Thus the average has been
raised about ten points.
Twenty-eight per cent of the stu
dents in 1921 were placed on proba
tion or disqualified, while in 1924-25,
the first year that admission was based
on the tests, the percentage of poor
scholars dropped to twenty-one and
eight-tenths per cent. This year Stan
ford has appointed Dr. Cowdery as
Director of Personnel Research. He
has a very large field in working with
the various statistics of these tests.
Vocational Tests Used
It is also thought probable that tests
of vocational interest will soon be
come prominent in the University.
They have been found to be very help
ful in really determining the type of
vocation a person is truly interested
in and has ability for. These ought to
abolish second-rate poets who should
have been first-rate Darwins. One
other type of test may soon be at
tempted, the personality test.
Dr. W. V. Bingham of the Personnel
Research Federation of New York says
in "School and Society" of December
19, 1925, that through the elimination
of dullards from the University, Stan
ford had saved the same as the annual
income on $2,000,000.
Stanford's "Program of University
Personnel Research," by Dr. Lewis M.
Terman of the Psychology department,
and Dr. Karl M. Cowdery of the De
partment of Personnel Research, was
published in the Journal of Personnel
Research for November and Decem
ber 1925. This paper gives an interest
ing account of what Stanford has ac
complished and hopes to accomplish
in the way of student personnel work.
In 1921 the University spent $105,000
more than tuition fees on students
who were disqualified due to poor
scholarship, and $230,000 on those stu
dents who were allowed to remain on
probation. The total that the poor stu
dents were costing the University
was equal to a third of its instruction
al budget.
Test Required
A few months later the requirement
of the Thorndike Intelligence Examin
ation was made for all entering stu
dents. The score was not to affect ad
mission, as the test was merely an
experiment. A report was made on
the result of the examinations, and it
was recommended that the test be
required of all desiring matriculation,
and that matriculation be denied any
one whose score was below fifty. This
plan was adopted in the spring of 1924.
