# ERNIE NEVERS, ALLSTARS WILL PLAY ON PACIFIC COAST
## 
### 
Krnie Nevers, greatest of Stanford
full-backs, may he seen once more in ac
tion on the coast, following tentative plans
made by the new group of Florida pro
moters who have taken over the destiny of
the giant back and his team of All-Stars.
These new plans call for games both at
Los Angeles and San Francisco. Just as
the future of the All-Stars became consid
erably jeopardized by poor management,
a group of Jacksonville, Florida, business
men took over the team and with the added
strength of a number of new men have
completely reorganized it.
Tomorrow the All-Stars will play the
New York Giants at Jacksonville in their
second professional football game. Cad
Reese, last year's captain at Washington
and Jefferson, together with a group of
players from West Virginia and Pitts
burgh has greatly bolstered the power of
the team. Russ Stein, former Washing
ton and Jefferson Ail-American and
leader of the team which played California
at Pasadena on New Year's Day in 1922
is reported to be the newly appointed coach
for Nevers' team.
In the series of games to be played in
the east Nevers will appear at Miami,
New Orleans, Texas, and possibly Hava
