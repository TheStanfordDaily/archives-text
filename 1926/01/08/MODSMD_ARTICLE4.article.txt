# ROUGHS IN EARNEST TO SEE WILDE PLAY IN FOUR-BIT SEATS
## 
### 
"The importance of being earn
est" will be proved again tonight
at 7 o'clock, when roughs' seats
for the Wilde play of that name
go on sale. Although the manage
ment promises no bonuses for
bearing and living up to the name
of Ernest or Earnest, it is an
nounced that all roughs' seats
will be good seats, and that being
earnest really will bring a re
ward in the attainment of these.
The tickets will be sold at the
box office.
Conclusive proof of an earnest
desire to rough the play, accord
ing to the management, will rest
in the payment of 50 cents.
