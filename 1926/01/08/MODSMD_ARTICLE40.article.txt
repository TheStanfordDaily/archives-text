# NOLAN CORRECTS STORY IN REGARD TO STOLEN WAGON
## 
### 
On January 4 the Daily Palo Alto
printed a story to the effect that Mr.
Grear was going to bring suit against
the Stanford student body for a wagon
which had been lost during the build
ing of the second Big Game bonfire.
The Daily today received a letter
from Harry L. Noland, Student Man
ager, explaining the situation and cor
recting the error made by the Daily
at that time, in which Noland speaks
as follows:
"I noticed in your Daily of last night,
in your article regarding the wagon
which had been lost at the bonfire,
you stated that Mr. Grear, owner of
the wagon, had threatened to sue us.
"I wish to correct this statement as
Mr. Grear was exceptionally nice in
regard to the whole matter. At no
time did he threaten to sue the student
body. All he wanted was his wagon,
and he even refused to tell me the
price of the wagon when I wanted to
pay him for it. He said that he would
wait a while longer and see if the
wagon could not be found as he much
preferred having the wagon.
"I would like to see a statement in
the Daily correcting your statement of
last night."

candles.
