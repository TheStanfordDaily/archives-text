# ALLEN TO REPEAT ORGAN SELECTIONS AT SUNDAY RECITAL
## 
### 
The program played by Warren D.
Allen at his organ recital yesterday
afternoon will be repeated Sunday at
4:15 o'clock. The selections chosen of
fer contrasts of musical light and
Bhade ranging from the dreamy
"Adagietto" of Bizet's "Suite l'Arle
sienne" to the "Fantasia" by Lemmens
with its realistic tone picture of a
great storm.
The selections from the "Arlesienne"
suite by Bizet have charm and appeal.
Alphonse Daudet's drama, "The Wo
man of Aries," for which Bizet wrote
the incidental music, is almost un
known now but the music has sur
vived and still gives pleasure wher
ever it is played. Although not as well
known as the composer's opera, "Car
men," the two suites into which the
instrumental music has been gathered
are popular. First played is the "Inter
mezzo" designed to occupy the atten
tion of the audience between two acts.
It is melodious and full of sentiment.
The "Adagietto" has fewer contrasts
of loud and soft than the "Intermezzo"
and is charming in its dreamy and
introspective quietness.
Two chorale preludes by John Se
bastian Bach were well paired together
to illustrate Bach's astounding mas
tery of varying moods. "The Old Year
Now Hath Passed Away" is simple and
sincere in feeling, while "In Thee Is
Gladness" is joyous and light-hearted,
refuting the idea that religious music
must of necessity be solemn and
sombre.
In his "Grand Fantasia: The Storm,"
Jacques Lemmens, a prominent organ
composer and performer, has present
ed an actual imitation of a storm be
tween sections of pastoral beauty. In
painting the picture of the rumble of
thunder some of the lowest notes on
the organ are used which give a strik
ing effect in the church.
"Canzona dopo l'epistola," by G.
Frescobaldi, which opens the program,
is a selection from compositions writ
ten to embellish the services at St.
Peter's in Rome where Frescobaldi
was organist for many years.
