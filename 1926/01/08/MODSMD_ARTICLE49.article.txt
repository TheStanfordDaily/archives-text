# STANFORD THOUGHT HIGHLY OF IN EAST SAYS FRANK FRYE
## 
### 
That Stanford Is thought well of in
the East is shown by the report of
Frank A. Frye, president of the Inter
fraternity Conference and Stanford
representative at the seventeenth an
nual Undergraduate Interfraternity
Conference held In New York.
"One of the most interesting points
of the entire conference was the high
praise eastern fraternity men have
for Stanford, or as it is better known
in the East, Leland Stanford," says
Frye in speaking of the attitude he
found at the meeting. "Stanford is
growing in honor year after year, due
to the work of Stanford alumni,
knowledge of her superior athletic
teams, and, best of all, from the high
scholastic standing which is the great
est point in favor of any university."
In relation to the conditions found
at other institutions as to interfra
ternity councils and interfraternity
troubles in these councils, he stated,
"From reports at the convention it
can be said that we have one of the
strongest interfraternity councils of
any university and have none of the
petty differences which have arisen in
many councils of other schools."
During his trip to the East, Frye
visited several universities to study
conditions as to the fraternity situa
tion, among them Chicago, Columbia,
and Dartmouth. The latter most close
ly resembles Stanford as a school, but
in the fraternit ysituation it is very
different. Only sixteen men can live in
the fraternity houses, and no table at
all is served in the houses. All men
dine at the university restaurants.
