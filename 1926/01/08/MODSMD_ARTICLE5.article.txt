# FRESHMAN QUINTET OPPOSES BERKELEY HIGH IN PRELIMINARY
## Coach Hunt Makes Final Cut In Babe Squad; Drills Men on Passing 
### 
With several days of intensive prac
tice since their last game, the fresh
man basketball team will meet the
Berkeley high school five in the pa
vilion tomorrow night in the prelimin
ary to the varsity game. The freshman
game will start promptly at seven
oclock.
The first-year men had only two
days of practice together before their
last start, and with the many work
outs on passing this week, should
show considerable improvement. Coach
Hunt has cut his squad to twelve men
and has been concentrating on team
work in his practices this week. Weak
ness in passing was one of the out
standing faults in the game Wednes
day night. In practice yesterday a
noted improvement was shown in this
department and the freshmen should
show a much stronger team tomorrow
night.
The tentative starting lineup will be
Lewis and Marks at guards, Crary and
Wilton, forwards, and McCandless at
center. McCandless was high point
man against Palo Alto High, scoring
twelve of the twenty points garnered
by the frosh. His floor work Avas also
good. Worden, who started at guard
in the last game, will probably be on
the court before the game is over.
Berkeley is rated a strong team and
should give the babes a good game
for their second appearance of the
season. Fewer substitutions will be
made in this game as Hunt has a fair
ly good line on his men since the final
cut. Husky is carrying a smaller squad
than usual, deeming it better to con
centrate on a few players and develop
teamwork.
