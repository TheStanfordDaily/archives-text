# "EARNEST" WORKERS PRODUCE NEW TYPE OF SETS FOR PLAY
## 
### 
Settings for "The Importance of
Being Earnest" will prove interesting
j from a technical point of view. They
will be (lone in an impressionistic
style, a type of work not often used
on this campus.
Three entire sets have been built
I by the theatre workshop class in the
I last four daysâ€”the largest and most
| ambitious undertaking a class has at
tempted in such a short time. The
faculty play last year, which was
given the first week of autumn quarter
involved only comparatively simple
settings.
The first scene will be an English
town house, done in a rather formal
manner. The second scene is laid in a
garden, with clipped hedges and flower
beds. The last set will be an interior
of an English cottage, and like the
others, is decidedly non-realistic.
"We are trying to reproduce the
spirit of the play without the realism,"
says Les Kiler, who is supervising the
setting of the play. "We have cut
everything down to simple units, with
the employment of only a few ele
ments of design."
Drapes are being used in all the
sets rather than stiff set pieces. Every
effort is being made to produce the
effect by impression rather than ma
terial effect. The campus will be given
an opportunity to decide what they
think of the aesthetic value of this
type of setting at the Assembly hall
this evening.
