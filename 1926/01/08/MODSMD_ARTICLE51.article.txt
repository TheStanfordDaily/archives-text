## "Dodson's Hints on Musical Hits" 
### 
This is a Victor year.
The New Orthophonic Victrola and
new process Victor records, dance and
classical, establish the fact.
The Orthophonic, as anyone who has
heard it will tell you, is a perfect re
producing instrument. The whole
range of music, every note audible to
the human ear, is accurately repro
duced on the Orthophonic Victrola.
It is an ideal musical instrument for
the living group. Plenty loud enough
for dancing, it pays for itself in the
money ordinarily paid out to orches
tras for "six to eights" and similar of
the more informal social gatherings.
New Victor records, both popular
and classical, are leading the retail
sales field all over the nation. These
current hits will tell you why:
"Who," played by George Olsen and
His Music.
"Feelin' Kind of Blue," sung by Jack
Smith.
"Just a Little Thing Called Rhythm,"
played by Olsen.
"Oh, Miss Hannah," sung by the
Revelers.
"What a Blue-Eyed Baby You Are,"
played by McEnelly's Orchestra.
"The Camel Walk," played by Art
Landry and His Orchestra.
