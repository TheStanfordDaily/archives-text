# TWO SUSPENDED BY MEN'S COUNCIL FOR LIBRARY VIOLATIONS
## 
### 
Two men students have been sus
pended from the University by the
Men's Council on account of their tak
ing books from the library. Neither
will be allowed to re-register earlier
than fall quarter provided they make
satisfactory records at some other in
stitution or at work.
In each case the student had stolen
the volumes with no idea of returning
them to the ilbrary. Eight books stolen
from the library were found in one
of the men's room while the other
student forged another's name for one
volume and took another. The Men's
Council is determined to stamp out
such practices at Stanford.
Both ca√ües were brought to the at
tention of the Men's Council by the
University librarian, George T. Clark.
