## RESERVES MAY PLAY Strenuous Week of Drilling Has Improved Playing Of Card Squad 
### Jim Adams 
An indication of the true strength
and possibilities of the Stanford bas
ketball team should be offered when
the Cards meet the Pomona College
five tomorrow night at 8 o'clock in the
pavilion. Coach Beefy Heath's squad is
of unknown calibre but is not ex
pected to offer the opposition that the
Grizzlies put up Monday night.
A week of hard drilling on passing
and teamwork should improve the
playing of the squad considerably. The
lack of an accurate shot will have to
be made up by a fast offense to work
the ball close to the basket.
Mitchell is still out of practice be
cause of an injured ankle and Shipkey,
who has been playing running guard
in scrimmages this week, will probably
start. Captain Price and David will be
at the forward positions and Jayred
at center. Anderson seems to have
a fairly secure hold on the standing
guard berth and will start tomorrow
night.
If Pomona doesn't press the Cards
too hard, Rupe, Clark, and Newhouse
will probably see action. Besides a
first squad Coach Andy Kerr has to
develop a capable set of reserves.
Kerr concentrated on passing, pivot
ing, and short shots in practice yes
terday and then sent his men through
a fast scrimmage. The same program
is planned for touight with the excep
tion of the scrimmage.
