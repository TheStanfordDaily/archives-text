# CARDS WILL MEET SAINT MARY'S ON GRIDIRON IN 1927
## NO DEFINITE DATES SET Basketball Game Next Winter Will Officially Start Athletic Relations 
### 
Stanford University and St. Mary's
College will meet on the gridiron in
1927, for the first time in five years,
according to an announcement from
the Graduate Manager's office here
Friday.
The last meeting between football
teams of the two institutions was in
the fall of 1922, on which occasion the
Cardinals barely scraped through with
a 9-0 victory. The last athletic competi
tion of any kind between the Cards
and Saints was in baseball in the
spring of 1924, when the latter won
out.
Agreement Made Friday
The details of the new arrangement
were worked out Friday afternoon at
a meeting between Graduate Manager
Masters of Stanford and Graduate
Manager LeFevre of St. Mary's. Owing
to the fact that all the Cardinal sched
ules are full for the coming season,
the two institutions will not meet in
basketball, baseball, or football this
year.
Masters' Statement
The first competition will be in bas
ketball next winter when the two
quintets will meet for the first time in
many years. Commenting on the fact
that St. Mary's had been added to the
Cardinals' athletic calendar, Graduate
Manager Masters said:
"Because of her proximity to Stan
ford and the strength of the team she
produces, St. Mary's is a logical op
ponent for us and we are glad to add
her to our schedules."
No definite dates for any sports have
been set and final arrangements will
probably be made in the near future.
