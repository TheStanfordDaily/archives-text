The audience at the Assembly hall
Friday evening was delighted by the
j presentation of Oscar Wilde's satirical
j farce, "The Importance of Being
1 Earnest." The delight was all the
more pleasant because it came as a
| surprise. We had been led to believe
! that the play would fall far below the
i average campus production due to
the illness of some of the actors. Miss
Barbara Wellington and Dr. Leo Bur
j dick, it is true, were handicapped by
i the necessity for straining their voices.
Gordon Davis gave his usual finished
performance. He presented Algernon
Moncrief, an Englishman of high so
cial cast, in a novel way which was
infinitely more charming than the
| usual characterization of that type. We
were more than pleased to note the
absence of the monocle.
Lady Bracknell Amusing
Lady Bracknell, an amusing and
! much exaggerated character, was well
1 done by Miss Augusta Corey. It seems
almost impossible that a young wo
man could so convincingly portray
this type of middle age. If we felt
that Lady Bracknell was more true
to nature than Oscar Wilde intended
i her to be, this lack of caricature was
more than made up for in Miss Prism.
Mrs. C. A. Huston, who played this
part, had an individual way of getting
laughs, not seen before on the Stan
ford stage.

We are all well acquainted with the
acting of Charles Parka. In this par
ticular comedy, he played a type
which he has done many times before
but it seemed to us that he did it bet
ter. He had an opportunity to show us
some real comedy and he did it. It
appeared that the part fitted him,
rather than that he fitted the part.
Feminine Stars
Miss Wellington and Miss Margaret
Davis were the two ingenues of the
play and were exceedingly well con
trasted. Miss Wellington, as the Hon
orable Gwendolyn Fairfax, was sophis
ticated and blas6, and Miss Davis, as
Cecily Cardew, the simple but keen
witted. Both made the best of their
parts.
The distinctiveness of the person
alities of the valet and butler was
very marked and excellently done.
Two students, well known in Stanford
dramatics, John Wiggin and Gregory
Williamson, were called upon to char
acterize these parts.
The first act was the best. In the
second and third acts, there was a
slight let-down in the acting. The sets
corresponded with the dramatization.
The first, carried out in draperies, was
excellent, and the other two not quite
so good. Maybe it was the two multi
colored panels which made us like the
first so much. The audience was most
appreciative and encouraged the ac
tors by getting the humor of the play.
