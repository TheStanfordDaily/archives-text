Dave Lamson and Mike Ely have
now completed the book for the Ram's
Head society production. The plot was
accepted last December just before
the close of the fall quarter and the
authors worked on the book during
Christmas vacation.
With the 1926 Ram's Head show the
society returns to the old-fashioned
type of burlesque which promises to
be one of the best productions the so
ciety has ever put on. The theme in
volves the famous Rover boys, and is
delightful satire on what the outside
thinks college is.
Dave Mannoccir is the director, and
Jack Wiggin has charge of the music.
More space will be devoted to music
in this show than formerly, and sex
tettes and quartettes will be in order.
Students having original music must
submit it to Wiggin by Thursday at
the latest. He may be reached at Alpha
Tau Omega house.
Clirysella Dunker Kiler will be the
director of chorus dancing and she
will have charge of the costumes. Les
j lie Kiler will design the sets.
