# CHAPARRAL CUTS RATE ON LAST FIVE ISSUES
## 
### 
Chaparral's great special subscrip
tion sale starts tonight. The remaining
five editions, which include some of
the choicest editions of the college

(year, will be offered on subscription
; for one dollar. This unusual offer gives
j students the opportunity to secure the
j remaining issues for two-thirds the
regular price of the five copies.
I On Valentine's Day, February 14, the
j next copy of Chaparral will appear
i upon the campus, and the staff has
! already made an excellent start in pre
paring a red-hot Valentine edition.
Later in the spring the "Old Boy"
plans a number in co-operation with
! another college comic magazine simi
i lar to the Chaparral-Cornell Widow
| edition of last year, that proved such
a success.
Representatives of Chappie will
scour the halls tonight, and any stu
dent who desires to take advantage of
this offer is asked to have a dollar
ready when the solicitors call. The
row will be canvassed tomorrow night
j and during the rest of the week.
