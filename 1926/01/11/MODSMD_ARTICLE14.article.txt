in their passing game, the freshman ;
basketball team defeated the Berkeley j
High School team in the pavilion Sat-1
I urday night by a score of 27 to 11. The :
babe quintet had no difficulty in get- \
j ting through the Berkeley defense, but j
showed a slight weakness in stopping
the high school boys' attack.
At the end of the first half the frosli j
| were leading 11 to 6. Berkeley came j
I back in the second period with plenty;
of fight, but they were unable to bet- j
ter their score more than five points j
: during the latter part of the game, i
| The boys from across the bay played |
a good brand of basketball, their pass
ing enabling them to get the ball in !
their territory plenty of times, but j
I their basket-shooting was weak.

1 game for the frosh, again coming out j
high point man, with a total of thir- j
teen points to his credit. Lewis and
Marks did fair work at the guard posi
■ tions, but their defensive play can still
; be improved upon. Crary and Sexon
i showed good form at forward, but
j Crary's work on defense was rather
weak. Several times the Berkeley lads
got through him for close shots.
Williams starred at guard for the
visitors, playing a safe defensive game.
Coach Husky Hunt used an entire
new team for the last five minutes of
play. Their defensive work was noth
j ing to brag about but they showed
: | that Husky has a strong offensive
> squad that will do plenty of scoring
. before the season is over.
