# POMONA COLLEGE SHOWS CARDINALS SLIGHT OPPOSITION
## VISITORS BEATEN 45 TO 13 Ragged Teamwork Is Glaring Fault of Attack Used By Kerr's Squad 
### Jim Adams 
In a ragged game of basketball tho
j Stanford team won an easy victory
from the Pomona College Ave Satur
day night in the pavilion, amassing a
total of forty-five points to the South
erners' thirteen. The Cards were given
very little opposition although the
Pomona men played hard until tho
last.
The playing of the Stanford team
| was marked by some good shooting
; on the parts of individuals but there
| were only flashes of smooth teamwork,
j The high score was the result of the
I loose defense of the Sagehens which
; allowed the Redshirts a largo number
|of unhampered shots at the basket.
Once the ball got past the Pomona
defense the Cards were allowed a half
a dozen shots before they sank one
or before the Southerners could re
cover the ball.
Jayred Scores Often
Jayred was high point man with six
j field goals to his credit. He made a
j number of good close-in shots besides
I sinking a couple of long ones. Jayred
j was closely followed by Price and
David who each accounted for nine
points, and Vincenti who rang up four
field goals in the last half.
David started the Stanford scoring
with a couple of pretty shots and with
j the aid of Price and Jayred the Cards
j were kept far in the lead until the
| half ended with the score 28 to 7. Kerr
| sent in his second string at the start
|of the last period and although they
held the Pomona five to few scores
they were unable to hit the basket
with the exception of Vincenti who
| found it four times, before the first
| team was again sent in with about
! five minutes to play.
Substitute Stars
| Vincenti's playing was spectacular.
\He dribbled and passed well besides
rustling the ball in great style. What
; caused the most notice was the quar
! tet of pretty shots he registered. The
| latter attracted attention because
Stanford is sorely in need of steady
j point-getters. Vincenti's defensive
J work is not equal to that of Mitchell's
' but if he can improve in this depart
i ment and keep his shooting eye he
1 may find himself playing regularly on
; the first five.
Anderson turned in another good
J game at standing guard. In addition
! to keeping the ball away from his bas
; ket he managed to sneak up and con
tribute a couple of field goals.
Pomona Outclassed
Holsinger made five points for the
Southerners and played the best ball
! for the Pomona outfit, but it was ap
parent after the first few minutes that
they were hopelessly outclassed.
Poor passing and juggling of the
I ball on both sides made the game a
ragged and slow affair. Shipkey and
Price were both responsible for a
number of poor passes. Mitchell was
i out of the game entirely with a bad
ankle.
The summary is as follows:
Stanford (45) Pomona (13)
'Price (C)(9) F Wilson (2)
David (9) F Holsinger (5)
| Jayred (12) C Millet (1)
Shipkey G Merrit (4)
Anderson (4) G Jesson (1)
