An endowment of $2,000,000 has been given Stanford by Professor
L. M. Terman if we would believe a writer in "School and Society." The
latter bases his deduction on the results of Professor Terman's Intelligence
tests as applied at Stanford, imputing to them a monetary gain for the
University.
Whereas before the method was used, poor scholarship (resulting in
students being put on probation or dropped from school) cost annually
about $335,000 â€”but under the present scheme this cost is some $80,000
less. This, the writer says, proceeds from the fact that the proportion of
those placed on probation or dropped from the University fell in one year
from 28.5 to 21.8 per cent.
Finally, the writer figures that the amount saved is only the interest on
$2,000,000 at better than 4 per cent. Thus, as the Palo Alto Times points
out, while a specific sum of $80,000 a year has not been given Stanford
or even saved as a specific sum, yet there is that much less expended on
worthless material and probably that amount better spent on those who
will appreciate it.
President Richardson of Dartmouth recently made the statement that
colleges were becoming overcrowded. This is indeed true of such pri
vately-endowed schools as Dartmouth and Stanford and a host of others
which are endeavoring to raise the standards of education by delivering it
only to those who efficiently absorb it.
This idea was undoubtedly behind the Terman Intelligence test and the
Independent Study plan. The pecuniary gain, however, is an interesting
angle that may aid in winning over those hard-headed opponents of any
such plan to raise educational requirements and standards. Many see the
theoretical side that education in private schools should be only for those
who appreciate it and of such a nature that they will regret no time spent.
There are others, however, to whom the practical saving of an intelligence
test appeals and who may soon come with unqualified support of the recent
rise in requirements.
