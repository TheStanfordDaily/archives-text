# 145-POUND TEAM IS WINNER OVER HEAVY ATHLETIC CLUB FIVE
## 
### 
Demonstrating that their fine show
ing against the San Jose Alumni Club
Wednesday night was not a mere flash
of brilliancy, the Stanford 145-pound
basketball team defeated the Camp
bell Athletic Club team Friday night
by a score of 20 to 15. In the pre
liminary game the 130's were defeated
by the San Jose Y.M.C.A. team 25
to 19.
The 145's trailed their heavier op
ponents by a score of 8 to 5 at half
time, and dopesters were surprised
that the count was not even more
favorable to the club team. In the .sec
ond half, however, Coach Hal Davis
sent in the lineup which had held the
San Jose club two days before, and
this outfit, chiefly through the brilliant
shooting of George, ably aided by San
ders and Blazier, soon took the lead
from the Campbell players.

George led the scoring with six
points, while Blazier and Sanders fol
lowed with four each. Ankeley, stand
ing guard, played his usual stellar
game throughout the second half.
The 130's found themselves unable
to keep up with the fast pace set by
the San Jose Y team, and could not
stop Niles, the visitors' center, who
made fifteen points for his team. For
the weight five, Whitney, forward, and
Brockway, guard, made five points
each. The lineups:
