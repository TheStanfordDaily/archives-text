# Not So Bad
## 
### 
After listening to what the president of the Interfraternity conference
and the president of the Associated Women have to say about universities
in the east as well as Stanford prestige there we have come to the conclu
sion that the Cardinal Farm isn't such a bad place after all. Both of these
students mingled with delegates from colleges throughout the country at
great national conventions as well as visiting at a number of large educa
tional institutions.
Stanford, according to one of them, is growing in honor on the Atlantic
seaboard with each succeeding year because of the work of its alumni, the
increased knowledge of its superior athletic teams, and its high scholastic
standing.
It probably seems quite astounding to the majority of us that after
seeing the largest of the eastern institutions the other delegate is quite con
tented with what we have at Stanford. She did not say as much but we
gathered the idea that Stanford withstood a critical comparison with the
best.
These two delegates are not the only ones who have left the farm ex
pecting to return chock full of constructive ideas only to find that the grass
merely appears to be greener in the other fellow's yard.
