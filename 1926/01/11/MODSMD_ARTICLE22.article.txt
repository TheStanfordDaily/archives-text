CABBAGES PIPE DICTIONARY
1. Pipe, n—Ordinary gas variety.

In the hands of an expert may be used
to produce externally the same effect
as a mon-aqueous beverage taken in
ternally.
2. Pipe v.t. —A word meaning to
heed or animadvert, as in the sen
tence: Pipe de skirt. Never used with
out the demonstrative "de." Often used
actively by the above-mentioned ex
perts.
3. Pipe n. —A hollowed-out pine knot
usually costing fifty cents on the Stan
ford campus and used by roommates
for purposes of asphyxiation. The corn
cob variety formerly well known on
the campus in first-year circles has

the disastrous gastronomical effects of
the Encina Dining Hall.
4. Pipe. n. —Used in reference to a
course supposed to yield two honor

Tun—No, wazzat?

the sake of their consciences we sus
pect that the women are more con
scious of their clothes than the men.
