rolls.

Two men were dropped from the
University rolls as the result of a
session of the Faculty Committee on
Student Affairs. The immediate cause
of this action on the part of the com
mittee was a disturbance which took
place in the hall late last semester
over the tubbing of a freshman. The
peculiar part of the affair was the
fact that the men who were suspended
were given no knowledge last semes
ter or during the Christmas vacation
of the fate in Btore for them. They
were permitted to return to Stanford
and register and then told that their
presence was no longer desired.
