# SPORTS OF 1926

### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
The Big Splash in 1925 in swimming was made by the
various attempts to cross the English Channel, none of
which were successful. Mme. Sion of France, Lillian Har
rison of Argentina, Isliak Helmy of Egypt, Lieut.-Col. Frey
berg of England, and Gertrude Ederle of the U.S.A., all
failed in their trials, some of which furnished considerable
drama, and much newspaper copy.
Lieut.-Col. Freyberg, a war hero, got within a quarter of
a mile of the English coast, and Mme. Sion, known as the
strongest woman living, collapsed when within a mile and
a quarter of her goal. Ishak Helmy earned the title of
world's champion-rescuer-of-collapsed-women channel-swim
mers by saving both Lillian Harrison and Gertrude Ederle.
Gertrude's attempt got the most publicity, partly because of
her alleged criticism of her English trainer, Jabez Wolff,
upon her return to New York.

Miss Ederle, in spit*? of her defeat, set a record in swimming 23% miles
in nine hours. Just previous to her departure for France she made a record
breaking swim from the Battery in New York to Sandy Hook, 17% miles,
in a few minutes over seven hours.
The men's and women's national championships developed some new
material in 1925, although, as usual, the Illinois Athletic Club and the Women's
Swimming Association of New York grabbed off the honors. Walter Laufer,
a Seattle backstroke swimmer, was one newcomer, and Walter Spence of the
Brooklyn Central S. C., another, Spence proved to be the best breast-stroke
and all-around swimmer of the year, setting a flock of new records.
Helen Wainwright turned professional after scoring 21% points alone in
the February indoor meet at St. Augustine, and her famous club mates,
Aileen Riggin and Gertrude Ederle, followed suit in November.
Arne Borg, famous Swedish star, came to America in April to win two
national indoor titles, and returned in the fall to make his home in Chicago
and to compete for the I.A.C. Johnny Weissmuller won the national outdoor
"100" in 50 4-sths seconds, the fastest time ever recorded, and acquired his
usual quota of records and titles.
