# TALLER BUILDINGS SAFER DURING QUAKES---WILLIS
## 
### 
"Tall buildings are actually safer
than certain heights of smaller ones
during an earthquake," according to
Bailey Willis, Professor Emeritus of
Geology. This is contrary to the com
mon belief of the majority of people
and to the propaganda spread by en
terprising real estate firms.

"It is a common impression that tall
buildings are in greater danger from
earthquakes than low ones, and the
question is not infrequently asked
whether the telephone and telegraph
building in San Francisco, or the forty
story structures in New York are not
excessively dangerous," he says.

"This is apparently a mistake which
ib shown when we consider the evi
dence of practical observations, or the
theories of vibration of structures in
an earthquake. For instance, the Claus-
Spreckles building at Third and Mar
ket streets, San Francisco, is 315 feet
high and seventy-five feet wide, and
has been found by instrumental ob
servations to swing with a natural
period of two and three-tenths sec
onds. Every building has a period of
swing like that of a pendulum, accord
ing to its dimensions and the distribu
tion of weights. An earthquake also
has a period of swing and it pays no
attention to the rate at which any
other structure vibrates."
"If it happens that a building swings
with an earthquake; that is, with the
same period, the shock is like that of

a squad of men marching in step
across a bridge and keeping time with
the swing of the bridge. We all know
that in that case the swing of the
bridge will be greatly increased and
for that reason marching in step on
bridges is forbidden in military regu
lations.
"Unfortunately we cannot hold an
earthquake down to military discipline
and when its period coincides with
that of a building the building is more
likely to swing than if they swing in
different periods. Earthquake periods
vary from one-half a second to one
second and a half and most modern
structures between seventy-five and
one hundred and fifty feet high have
8T similar pendulum swing. They are
therefore more dangerous than taller
structures which swing at a slower
rate, or shorter structures whose
period is less than half a second.
"When, in addition to this relation
of vibrations, we take into account the
fact that very tall buildings must have
steel frames and that they are engi
neered with the highest skiljl, we
realize that a great structure of the
American, type is likely to be safer
than a less-expensive, less-costly build
ing, which is nearer the earthquake's
period and which is not as well built.
"There is, nevertheless, in our great
office buildings, a danger in the human
element. The Hudson Building in New
York, for instance, houses 5000 peo
plo. Should they all start to get out
at once, as they are likely to do in an
earthquake, the panic danger would
far exceed that of ftie shock itself. The
only safeguard for this is to keep still
and keep cool."
Dr. Willis also states that there
have been various kinds of special
foundations designed in order to over
come the shock of the quakes, but at
the present time there is none which
will serve for very large buildings.
Over in Japan they have put small
houses and one-story structures on
ball bearings, and have saved a great
deal of destruction by this method,
but it is evident that this could not
be done on a very large scale.

for that reason marching in step on
bridges is forbidden in military regu
lations.
"Unfortunately we cannot hold an
earthquake down to military discipline
and when its period coincides with
that of a building the building is more
likely to swing than if they swing in
different periods. Earthquake periods
vary from one-half a second to one
second and a half and most modern
structures between seventy-five and
one hundred and fifty feet high have
8T similar pendulum swing. They are
therefore more dangerous than taller
structures which swing at a slower
rate, or shorter structures whose
period is less than half a second.
"When, in addition to this relation
of vibrations, we take into account the
fact that very tall buildings must have
steel frames and that they are engi
neered with the highest skiljl, we
realize that a great structure of the
American, type is likely to be safer
than a less-expensive, less-costly build
ing, which is nearer the earthquake's
period and which is not as well built.
"There is, nevertheless, in our great
office buildings, a danger in the human
element. The Hudson Building in New
York, for instance, houses 5000 peo
plo. Should they all start to get out
at once, as they are likely to do in an
earthquake, the panic danger would
far exceed that of ftie shock itself. The
only safeguard for this is to keep still
and keep cool."
Dr. Willis also states that there
have been various kinds of special
foundations designed in order to over
come the shock of the quakes, but at
the present time there is none which
will serve for very large buildings.
Over in Japan they have put small
houses and one-story structures on
ball bearings, and have saved a great
deal of destruction by this method,
but it is evident that this could not
be done on a very large scale.
"Tall buildings are actually safer
than certain heights of smaller ones
during an earthquake," according to
Bailey Willis, Professor Emeritus of
Geology. This is contrary to the com
mon belief of the majority of people
and to the propaganda spread by en
terprising real estate firms.

"It is a common impression that tall
buildings are in greater danger from
earthquakes than low ones, and the
question is not infrequently asked
whether the telephone and telegraph
building in San Francisco, or the forty
story structures in New York are not
excessively dangerous," he says.

"This is apparently a mistake which
ib shown when we consider the evi
dence of practical observations, or the
theories of vibration of structures in
an earthquake. For instance, the Claus-
Spreckles building at Third and Mar
ket streets, San Francisco, is 315 feet
high and seventy-five feet wide, and
has been found by instrumental ob
servations to swing with a natural
period of two and three-tenths sec
onds. Every building has a period of
swing like that of a pendulum, accord
ing to its dimensions and the distribu
tion of weights. An earthquake also
has a period of swing and it pays no
attention to the rate at which any
other structure vibrates."
"If it happens that a building swings
with an earthquake; that is, with the
same period, the shock is like that of

a squad of men marching in step
across a bridge and keeping time with
the swing of the bridge. We all know
that in that case the swing of the
bridge will be greatly increased and
for that reason marching in step on
bridges is forbidden in military regu
lations.
