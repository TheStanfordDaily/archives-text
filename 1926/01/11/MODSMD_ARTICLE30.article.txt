# CALIFORNIA FORCED TO LOOK FOR NEW FOOTBALL MENTOR
## 
### 
The death of Coach Andy Smith is
forcing the University of California
to find another football mentor, and
though a number of prominent players
and coaches have been named for the
position, nothing definite can or will
bo done until Wednesday night at the
meeting of the Associated Students'
executive committee.
The most talked-of man for the job
at the present time is Nibs Price, who
has been assisting Andy Smith since
1917. Price has turned out some re
markable freshman teams and trained
some valuable men for Smith. He has
been offered the position as head
coach by several eastern and western
colleges, but has turned them down,
preferring to remain at California as
an assistant. Coach Dr. Boles, who
has been handling the linework for
California, has been questioned as to
what he would think of taking over
the work, but he has several times
voiced the decision to remain with
his medical practice, though he is
glad to remain on part time as assist
ant.
Other men who are being discussed
are Brick Muller and Babe Horrell.
Muller is probably the greatest player
ever turned out at California and is
one of the best ends in the country.
He has been out of college long
enough to have received experience
that would gain the respect of his
men. Horrell is also a capable man
and was brought up under the Smith
system.
Experts point to the fact that since
all of the older and more experienced
coaches are signed up for the 1926
season already, it would be better to
take one of the ex-stars who has been
helpful in putting California on the
football map and letting him follow
out the work of Andy Smith. In this
way the present system of play could
continue and the likelihood of losing
games because of having to break in
a new system would not be so im
minent.
Franklin B. Morse says that the in
fusion of new blood into the coaching
staffs is a good thing, and is all in
favor of having one of the young
alumni take the job. Andy Smith was
only thirty when he took over the
reins of coaching at California, and
he turned out an unbeaten eleven for
five years.
