# 'CHILDREN'S READING' PUBLISHED BY DR. TERMAN, MISS LIMA

### 
"Children's Reading," a new book
by Dr. Lewis M. Terman, head of the
Psychology department, and Margaret
Lima, formerly research assistant in
the study of the Gifted Child at Stan
ford, has just come off the press this
week. Dr. Terman, who is world-fam
ous as a psychologist, has also written
"The Measurement of Intelligence"
and "Genetic Studies of Genius" and
"Intelligence of School Children."

"Children's Reading" contains a list
of suitable books from infancy upward
for a child to read. It is much more
than a list of books; it is a guide by
which parent and teacher can be as
sured that the child will grow up with
a cultivated literary taste.

"Children's Reading" includes an
analysis of what children like and dis
like, and a study of their mental
growth in connection with reading.
Over two thousand children were
painstakingly studied by Dr. Terman
and Miss Lima in regard to their likes
and needs in literature in order that
the book be written.

This research work was made pos
sible in part by a grant from the Com
monwealth Fund supplemented by a
grant from the Thomas Welton Stan
ford fund. The results of the investi
gation as recorded in "Children's
Reading" have more than justified the
authors' study for such a book is of
invaluable aid to parents and teachers
in the cultivation of a pure literary
taste in children.
