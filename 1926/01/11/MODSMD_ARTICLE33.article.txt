# MILDRED WORSWICK TO REPORT TRIP AT CONFERENCE PARTY
## 
### 
Women's Conference will hold its
big party of the quarter Wednesday
night in the Women's Clubhouse at
7:30. Dinner will be served in three
shifts: at six, six-thirty, and seven, to
better take care of all the women. It
is also hoped that in this way groups
will be mixed up and new acquain
tances made.
The clubhouse board, under the di
rection of Mrs. Edwin J. Thomas, has
charge of the affair. If as many tickets
are sold as is anticipated, the remain
der of the clubhouse debt of $1500 will
be greatly diminished. Martha Burnett
is selling tickets for the dinner.
The program promises to be very
interesting. Mildred Worswick will
give her first speech about her trip
East to the National Collegiato World
Court Conference at Princeton, and
tell many entertaining anecdotes about
the convention. Dean Yost will also
speak. A sophomore stunt of which
Elisabeth Bakewell is in charge, will
be given. It will be play called "And
the Lamp Went Out."
The big surprise of the evening will
be the senior skit. Harriet Oliver is in
charge of this novel feature, and prom
ises that every one will find the 1926
stunt to be a great feature.
Those students arranging the pro
gram are: Helen Huneke, chairman;
Harriet Oliver, '26; Beatrice Flesher,
'26; Helene von Damm, '28; and Alice
Sohlinger, '28. Dancing will follow the
program. Phil Brooks' orchestra will
provide music for the entertainment.
