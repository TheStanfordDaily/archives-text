# STANFORD OFFICIALS PRAISE ANDY SMITH FOR SPORTSMANSHIP
## 
### 
Upon hearing of the death of An
drew Smith, coach of the California
football teams, Pop Warner, Stanford
mentor, and Alfred Masters, graduate
manager, wired the following tele
grams to the University of California:

"A worthy foe. Gracious in victory
and a true sportsman in defeat. Smith
was always willing to give the other
fellow credit for his work when his
football teams ran rough-shod over all
opposition. He was never egotistical or
selfish. He always preferred to give
the glory to his players."
"I need say nothing as to Andy
Smith's ability as a coach. His prowess
is too well known throughout the coun
try. I do say, however, that with the
passing of Andy Smith, one of the
strongest and most colorful figures in
football history is lost to the game."
Signed: Pop Warner.
"We at Stanford are deeply grieved
to hear of the death of Andy Smith.
We knew him as an opponent to be
feared and respected. I join the foot
ball fans of the entire country in say
ing, 'California, the loss is not only
yours, for football has lost one of its
greatest figures'."
Signed: Alfred R. Masters.
