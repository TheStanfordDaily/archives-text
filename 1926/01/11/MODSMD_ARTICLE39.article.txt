# PUBLISHER PRESENTS LOAN LIBRARY WITH FOURTEEN VOLUMES
## 
### 
The Robert F. Stever Loan Library
of the appointment office has just re
ceived a gift of fourteen books from
Ginn and Company, of San Francisco.
These volumes are complete in every
respect, but were unsalable because
they had been slightly damaged.

These and many other books, some
of which are regular textbooks in use
by the various courses, and others
of which are valuable as references,
are kept on hand in the loan library.
Any self-supporting student may bor
row these books free of charge, and
is allowed to keep them during the
entire quarter for which they are
needed. The appointment office re
quires only that the students return
the books when they are through with
them, in order that other students may
also use them.

Last year over 400 books were
loaned in this manner, and this year
the number will probably be increased.

Following is a list of the new books
from Ginn and Company: Elementary
Economics, by Thomas N. Carver; Se
lected Readings in Public Finance, by
Charles J. Bullock (two copies); The
Greater Poems of Virgil, by Greenough
and Kittredge; Introduction to Politi
cal Science, by Raymond G. Gettel
(two copies); Starting Points in So
cial Science, by A. G. Keller; Elements
of the Differential and Integral Cal
culus, by William A. Granville; Rail
way Problems, by William Z. Ripley;
Readings on the Relation of Govern
ment to Property and Industry, by
