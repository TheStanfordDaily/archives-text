# NEVERS IS INJURED WHEN GIANTS BEAT ALL-STARS 7 TO 0
## 
### 
Ernie Nevers' All-Stars met defeat
at the hands of the New York Giants
football team Saturday in a score of
7 to 0, but only after Nevers had been
taken out of the game with torn liga
ments in his back, just after the start
of the second half.

While Nevers was in the game he
made twenty-five yards in six attempts
and averaged forty-six yards in six
punts. But when he was taken out, the
All-Stars seemed to lack the brawn to
hold back the husky New York Giants,
although they fought consistently and
hard. Mc√üride, of the Giants, scored
the one touchdown and kicked the goal
in the last period. Near the end of
the first half Jacksonville recovered
a fumble near the Giants' 8-yard line,
and the New Yorkers were saved from
an extremely bad position only by the
gun for the end of the half.

The game was viewed by an ex
tremely small crowd, although from
the experts' point of view it was a
much better game than that between
the All-Stars and the Chicago Bears
on tho preceding Saturday. Nevers'
team has improved greatly during the
week and played real football.

Nevers will not be able to practice
for the next four or five days, but his
injury is not considered dangerous
enough to interfere with his next
scheduled game on the coming week
end.
