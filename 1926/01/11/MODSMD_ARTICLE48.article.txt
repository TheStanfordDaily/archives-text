# CELEBRATED PIANIST WILL PLAY BEFORE STUDENTS THURSDAY
## 
### 
E. Robert Schmitz, one of the fore
most present-day French pianists, will
play in the Assembly hall Thursday
night as one of the Peninsula Music
Association's series of artists. Schmitz
is distinguished not only as a notable
piano virtuoso but also as a pioneer
and prophet of the best in modern
music. He is a graduate of the Paris
Conservatory where he won a first
prize for his notable piano playing. In
America he is known chiefly as a con
ductor, but in Europe he has a reputa
tion as a composer also. He founded
and for a time led an orchestra in
Paris that still bears his name.
He has lived in the very center of
the latest developments in music and
is personally acquainted with most of
the great composers of recent years.
A list of his many musical friendships
includes such universally known fig
ures as: Claude Acliille Debussy, Vin
cent d'lndy, Paul Dukas, Charles Marie
Widor, Erik Satie, Igor Stravinsky,
and Maurice Ravel. He was the
pioneer interpreter of the works of
Debussy in Germany and England and
is a recognized authority in the play
ing of the works of that composer.
As evidence of the way in which
Schmitz takes the best in modern
music at the same time retaining the
finest classics is shown by his pro
gram played in the Scottish Rite Hall
of New York City before he left on
his transcontinental tour. The recital
was made up of the works of J. S.
Bach and of Debussy, Bach, the
father of music who lived in the
eighteenth century, and Debussy, who
died only a few years ago, and was
held by some to have said the last
word in music, form an unusual com
bination on a concert program, but
Schmitz was successful and has pre
sented the same program at other
points on his transcontinental tour.
During this month he gives a lecture
in San Francisco as an authority on
"The Modernists of Russia and Ger
many."
