shown in Milwaukee, Chicago, Mem
phis, and other cities of America.
Prominent art educators have pro
nounced it a more coherent and adapt
able exhibition to American needs
than the Cizek exhibition which has
recently made the rounds of American
cities. The Cizek collection is the work
of European pupils of a French art
teacher, Cizek.

proven so successful that school super
intendents of several cities have asked
for detailed outlines of the courses of
art study as given at Minneapolis and
