The cast for "La Plaisanterie," a
comedy in one act by Marc Sonal to be
produced by the French club Wednes
day evening in the Little Theatre at
8:15 o'clock, includes Joseph Donnay
who will play the part of Gaston Var
gis, an explorer.
Other characters in the play are
Hervey Ghislain de Bivort de la Sau
dee as llippolyte, and Marcel Ton
waide as Arthur Brumet. All these
actors are French and are well suited
to play the humorous roles which the
comedy affords.

this time is "La Paix Chez Soi" by
Georges Courteline with Barbara Ann
Eubanks and Joseph Donnay in the
cast. Both comedies are light, clever
dramas which have quick moving ac
tion as well as very good lines.
Since the war the French Club has

fit of French war orphans. Tickets are
on sale in Palo Alto at Crandall's,
and will be also available at the door
of the Little Theatre Wednesday eve
ning for one dollar.
