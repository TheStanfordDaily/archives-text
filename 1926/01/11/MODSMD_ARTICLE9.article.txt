### 
The ticket sale for the Glee Club
Novelties to be given in the Assembly
hall Friday evening at 8:15 o'clock
j will be held tomorrow, Tuesday, after
: noon at 1 o'clock in the new ticket
! office in the lobby of the Old Union.
! The dramatic ticket offices are now
i permanently situated in the new loca
i tion. Popular prices for the show are
seventy-five cents and one dollar.
With twelve acts, each one a top
i notcher and brand new, the Novelties
show next Friday night will strive to
please the campus taste. A list of the
principals to take part reads like a
j roll-call of the favorite entertainers,
! comediennes, and song-and-dance art
| ists to be found at Stanford. Under
the supervision of Del Daves, who will
himself take part in two of the skits,
an even dozen acts of the most popu
' lar variety, have been made into a
j well-balanced program.
Among the outstanding features of
the program are the acts starring
feminine talent. Marjorie Allen and
j Aileen Burks have everyone guessing
; as to the surprises in the scenery of
; their act together, which is not to be
revealed until the night of the show.
They will sing a series of popular
I songs in their own especial style,
j Peggy Randall's number will have an
j Hawaiian background.
Dorothy Dahler will not only put on
5 a funny song number in the manner
which she has made particularly her
j own, but will take part in Delmer
i Dave's original skit of a fraternal
meeting. Daves is to be none other
than a Chief Hub of the Ancient Order
of the Wheel Whose Every Spoke is
, a Standard of Truth, namely the Ex
alted Keeper of the Opal Gate. Miss
; Dahler will take the part of the
! Leader of the Women's Auxiliary:
I The Big Noise of the Lodge of the
Red Screaming Eagles who fly by
Night.
With the actual music from the
grand opera Faust and domestic words
to a hilarious situation, the skit, "I
Think I Smell Smoke," is convulsing
even the cast and chorus who are re
i hearsing it. Daves takes the role of
: the heroic janitor who risks all to
save his tenants from the tremendous
| conflagration. The accompaniment will
| be played by the new Stanford orclies
i tra directed by Mrs. Helen Engel At
; kinson, a member of the first violin
! section of the San Francisco Philhar
| monic Orchestra. The Stanford Orches
j tra will be heard for the first time at
j the Novelties.
| In spite of its humor, "I Think I
Smell Smoke" is a real vocal feat and
requires capable voices of volume and
j staying power. Besides the principals
a chorus of twenty will take part in
the same way as the usual opera
chorus.
Hal Boone and Van King will have
the Glee Club seven-piece orchestra as
i their partners in a presentation of the
; newest and snappiest in novel dances
! and popular songs. This pair made a
j great hit at the Football Show and
! have prepared new steps for this per
' formance.
| Songs by the Glee Club, the Glee
Club quartette, and vocal soloists will
! be heard. A special feature will be the
' Glee Club's presentation of the well
known "Volga Boatmen's Song" with
scenery and pantomine to match.
