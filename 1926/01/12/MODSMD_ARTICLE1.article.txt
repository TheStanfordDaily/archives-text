# ENCINA 4E VICTORS IN FIRST ROUND OF INTRAMURAL PLAY
## Theta Chi, Breakers, Phi Delts And Sequoia II Win in Games as Season Opens 
### 
Encina 4E defeated Kappa Alpha in
the feature game of the first day of
competition in the annual winter
■quarter basketball tournament which
started yesterday afternoon in Encina
gymnasium. The freshmen displayed a
decidedly superior style of game, and
had little difficulty trouncing the fra
ternity men by a 21-2 score. Other
results yesterday were: Theta Chi
defeated Encina lE, 14-11; Zeta Psi
lost to the Breakers, 14-11; Sequoia
II beat Encina 2W, 13-8; and Phi Delta
"Theta shut out Sigma Chi, 10-0.
Encina 4E played a clever game
against the Kappa Alpha five, working
the ball down the floor continually
by means of a short passing attack.
Bowers, Encina forward, played a
brilliant floor game and was the leader
in the freshman offensive. Crandall
Tvas high point man, accounting for
seven of the Encina team's points.
Kappa Alpha put up a good game,
although the team managed to score
only one basket. Davidson and Morrill
» worked well together and only the
lack of accurate shooting kept the Row
players from counting heavily.
Theta Chi Downs Encina
Theta Chi owes her victory over
Encina 1W mainly to the accurate
shots of Hogle, who chalked up eleven
points for his team. With the score
standing 4 to 1 at the end of the first
half, Hogle got his eye on the basket
and rang in five shots in quick succes
sion, which was enough to give the
Theta Chi team a three-point lead.
Dunkly, freshman forward, was the
outstanding player on his team, being
credited with six points. Both teams
played a fast passing game and relied
mainly on short shots under the goal.
The first-year guards, Conroy and
Copeland, played a stellar defensive
game and it was their work under the
basket that kept the Theta Chi offense
from running up a much larger score.
Zetes Fight Hard
The Zeta Psi-Breakers tussle was
close from start to finish, the lead
passing from one team to the other in
rapid succession. Busch, substitute
running guard for the Breakers, was
the star of the game when he dropped
in the two winning baskets in the last
minute of play. The score at half time
was 6 to 5 in favor of the Breakers.
Sibbett played a good game at for
ward for the Zetes. He displayed plen
ty of cleverness in his fioor work, and
had mauy shots at the basket, but
hard luck kept him from scoring heav
ily. E. Post was a tower of strength
at the standing guard position for the
fraternity team.
Both teams put up a rough exhibi
tion and the contest was marred by
numerous fouls. The Breakers dis
played by far the best offensive, and
the work of Carlsmith and Cook was
especially noticeable. Cook captured
high point honors with five markers.
Sigs Lose to Phi Delts
Sigma Chi exhibited a marked in
ability to find the basket in the game
with Phi Delta Theta and came out
911 the short end of a 10-0 score.
Neither team showed much in the
form of real basketball, except for
occasional flashes of form by the Phi
Delts.
Snyde, playing center for the win
ners, was the chief offensive power,
and is credited with six points. He
also played a good floor game and was
the real leader of the Phi Delt's of
fense. King and Brady showed to best
advantage for the losers.
Sequoia II won from Encina 2W in
a rather listless affair, the final count
standing at 13-8. Mack led the scoring
with five baskets and one free throw
for a total of eleven points. Paine, a
freshman center, led his team with
five points.
Encina led at half time 3 to 2 after
a period featured by many ineffective
attempts to find the hoop. Mack start
ed off in the second half with a couple
of pretty shots from the sidelines
which gave Sequoia a lead that was
never seriously challenged. Mack
counted for two more goals near the
end of the game that cinched matters
for the hall players.
Branner II was scheduled to meet
Theta Delta Chi in the last of yester
day's contests but failed to appear on

ternity men by a 21-2 score. Other
results yesterday were: Theta Chi
defeated Encina lE, 14-11; Zeta Psi
lost to the Breakers, 14-11; Sequoia
II beat Encina 2W, 13-8; and Phi Delta
"Theta shut out Sigma Chi, 10-0.
Encina 4E played a clever game
against the Kappa Alpha five, working
the ball down the floor continually
by means of a short passing attack.
Bowers, Encina forward, played a
brilliant floor game and was the leader
in the freshman offensive. Crandall
Tvas high point man, accounting for
seven of the Encina team's points.
Kappa Alpha put up a good game,
although the team managed to score
only one basket. Davidson and Morrill
» worked well together and only the
lack of accurate shooting kept the Row
players from counting heavily.
Theta Chi Downs Encina
Theta Chi owes her victory over
Encina 1W mainly to the accurate
shots of Hogle, who chalked up eleven
points for his team. With the score
standing 4 to 1 at the end of the first
half, Hogle got his eye on the basket
and rang in five shots in quick succes
sion, which was enough to give the
Theta Chi team a three-point lead.
Dunkly, freshman forward, was the
outstanding player on his team, being
credited with six points. Both teams
played a fast passing game and relied
mainly on short shots under the goal.
The first-year guards, Conroy and
Copeland, played a stellar defensive
game and it was their work under the
basket that kept the Theta Chi offense
from running up a much larger score.
Zetes Fight Hard
The Zeta Psi-Breakers tussle was
close from start to finish, the lead
passing from one team to the other in
rapid succession. Busch, substitute
running guard for the Breakers, was
the star of the game when he dropped
in the two winning baskets in the last
minute of play. The score at half time
was 6 to 5 in favor of the Breakers.
Sibbett played a good game at for
ward for the Zetes. He displayed plen
ty of cleverness in his fioor work, and
had mauy shots at the basket, but
hard luck kept him from scoring heav
ily. E. Post was a tower of strength
at the standing guard position for the
fraternity team.
Both teams put up a rough exhibi
tion and the contest was marred by
numerous fouls. The Breakers dis
played by far the best offensive, and
the work of Carlsmith and Cook was
especially noticeable. Cook captured
high point honors with five markers.
Sigs Lose to Phi Delts
Sigma Chi exhibited a marked in
ability to find the basket in the game
with Phi Delta Theta and came out
911 the short end of a 10-0 score.
Neither team showed much in the
form of real basketball, except for
occasional flashes of form by the Phi
Delts.
Snyde, playing center for the win
ners, was the chief offensive power,
and is credited with six points. He
also played a good floor game and was
the real leader of the Phi Delt's of
fense. King and Brady showed to best
advantage for the losers.
Sequoia II won from Encina 2W in
a rather listless affair, the final count
standing at 13-8. Mack led the scoring
with five baskets and one free throw
for a total of eleven points. Paine, a
freshman center, led his team with
five points.
Encina led at half time 3 to 2 after
a period featured by many ineffective
attempts to find the hoop. Mack start
ed off in the second half with a couple
of pretty shots from the sidelines
which gave Sequoia a lead that was
never seriously challenged. Mack
counted for two more goals near the
end of the game that cinched matters
for the hall players.
Branner II was scheduled to meet
Theta Delta Chi in the last of yester
day's contests but failed to appear on

Encina 4E played a clever game
against the Kappa Alpha five, working
the ball down the floor continually
by means of a short passing attack.
Bowers, Encina forward, played a
brilliant floor game and was the leader
in the freshman offensive. Crandall
Tvas high point man, accounting for
seven of the Encina team's points.
Kappa Alpha put up a good game,
although the team managed to score
only one basket. Davidson and Morrill
» worked well together and only the
lack of accurate shooting kept the Row
players from counting heavily.
Theta Chi Downs Encina
Theta Chi owes her victory over
Encina 1W mainly to the accurate
shots of Hogle, who chalked up eleven
points for his team. With the score
standing 4 to 1 at the end of the first
half, Hogle got his eye on the basket
and rang in five shots in quick succes
sion, which was enough to give the
Theta Chi team a three-point lead.
Dunkly, freshman forward, was the
outstanding player on his team, being
credited with six points. Both teams
played a fast passing game and relied
mainly on short shots under the goal.
The first-year guards, Conroy and
Copeland, played a stellar defensive
game and it was their work under the
basket that kept the Theta Chi offense
from running up a much larger score.
Zetes Fight Hard
The Zeta Psi-Breakers tussle was
close from start to finish, the lead
passing from one team to the other in
rapid succession. Busch, substitute
running guard for the Breakers, was
the star of the game when he dropped
in the two winning baskets in the last
minute of play. The score at half time
was 6 to 5 in favor of the Breakers.
Sibbett played a good game at for
ward for the Zetes. He displayed plen
ty of cleverness in his fioor work, and
had mauy shots at the basket, but
hard luck kept him from scoring heav
ily. E. Post was a tower of strength
at the standing guard position for the
fraternity team.
Both teams put up a rough exhibi
tion and the contest was marred by
numerous fouls. The Breakers dis
played by far the best offensive, and
the work of Carlsmith and Cook was
especially noticeable. Cook captured
high point honors with five markers.
Sigs Lose to Phi Delts
Sigma Chi exhibited a marked in
ability to find the basket in the game
with Phi Delta Theta and came out
911 the short end of a 10-0 score.
Neither team showed much in the
form of real basketball, except for
occasional flashes of form by the Phi
Delts.
Snyde, playing center for the win
ners, was the chief offensive power,
and is credited with six points. He
also played a good floor game and was
the real leader of the Phi Delt's of
fense. King and Brady showed to best
advantage for the losers.
Sequoia II won from Encina 2W in
a rather listless affair, the final count
standing at 13-8. Mack led the scoring
with five baskets and one free throw
for a total of eleven points. Paine, a
freshman center, led his team with
five points.
Encina led at half time 3 to 2 after
a period featured by many ineffective
attempts to find the hoop. Mack start
ed off in the second half with a couple
of pretty shots from the sidelines
which gave Sequoia a lead that was
never seriously challenged. Mack
counted for two more goals near the
end of the game that cinched matters
for the hall players.
Branner II was scheduled to meet
Theta Delta Chi in the last of yester
