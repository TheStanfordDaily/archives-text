# TEMPLETON SETS TENTATIVE TRACK OUTFIT TO WORK
## Thirty-Nine Listed to Form Probable Squad for Present Training 
### 
Thirty-nine men were named yester
day by Coach Dink Templeton as ten
tatively forming the track squad with
which he hopes to defeat U.S.C., Ore
gon, the Olympic Club, and California
this year.
This squad list may be cut or added
to as the season advances, but for the
present it will form the working group
from which Templeton must find men
to replace the stars lost from last
year's team by graduation.
The list includes the names of fif
teen lettermen, but the loss of Swede
Leistner, Tiny Hartranft, and A1
Smith, who accounted for 24 points in
last year's Big Meet, is one which
leaves the Cardinal weak in the hur
dles, weights, and distance runs.
This year's schedule will be a hard
one, with U.S.C. ranked as the hard
est team to beat. The Trojans have
practically the same team with which
they won the 1.C.4A meet last spring,
and are figuring on making up for the
two straight defeats which they have
suffered from Stanford.
Until the U.S.C. meet is over, Coach
Templeton does not plan to point for
the Big Meet. It is generally believed
that the California meet will not be
so hard for Stanford as the southern
contest.
The complete list of the squad as
published last night by Coach Temple
ton is as follows:
Abramson, 440; Adams, dashes; An
derson, javelin; Babcock, 440; Borden,
440', sprints; Bly, hurdles; Collins,
880, mile; Coverley, sprints; Doerr,
440; Dyer, broad jump; Fontaine, pole

dles; Joaquin, javelin; King, high
jump; Kerr, mile; Lloyd, pole vault.

dles; Spencer, hurdles; Storie, 440;
