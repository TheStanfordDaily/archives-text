## 
### 
Jacksonville's All-Star football team,
of which Ernie Nevers was the cap
tain, has been disbanded, according to
news from Florida today. Nevers is ne
gotiating with the New York Giants,
a team which is being primed for a
series of games in the South and
West. In the event of any failure in
making a football contract, Nevers
expects to enter the professional bas
ketball field.
The All-Stars have played but two
games of the five for which Nevers
was signed to play, losing both of
those. The first game was against the
Chicago Bears, led by Red Grange,
who defeated the All-Stars 19 to 6; the
second game against the New York
Giants ended 7 to 0 in favor of the
Giants. In this second game Nevers
received injuries to his back which
put him out of the game in the second
half and which havg held him off the
practice field for several days.
Both of the All-Stars' games have
been played before small crowds, and
consequently the promoters have lost
money on each game. In the contract
with Nevers they are to forfeit $25,000
if they vountarily stop the games, so
there will be no loss to Ernie by the
disbanding of the team.
