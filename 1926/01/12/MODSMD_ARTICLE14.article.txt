# AWARDS COMMITTEE PLANS TO COMPLETE PROPOSAL TOMORROW
## 
### 
Work of drawing up a revised
awards plan to be presented to the
student body at the mid-year elections
is expected to be completed at a
meeting of the Awards Committee
scheduled at 7:15 o'clock tomorrow
night. The meeting will be held in
Room 204 of the English building.
The Awards Committee was appoint
ed early last quarter by the Executive
Committee, the purpose of the body
being to draw up a plan of revision
of the present awards system.
The committee has gone over the
plan defeated by a 3 to 1 vote at a
Quad election last year, and has at
tempted to smooth out the weaknesses
of this plan.
To date, the only definite decision
made by the committee has been to
keep the major sports group as at
present, including football, track, bas
ketball, baseball, and tennis as Block
"S" sports. It has also been practi
cally decided that there will be two
sports divisions in addition to the
major group.
The matter of awards for these two
minor groups and of award require
ments are yet to be considered, and
a tentative grouping of the minor
sports must be approved.
This work will be completed within
a short time, as the mid-year elections
will be held in the middle of Febru
ary,
