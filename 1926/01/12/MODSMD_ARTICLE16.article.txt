# 40,000 CATALOGUES, BOOKLETS PRINTED HERE EVERY YEAR
## 
### 
Booklets and catalogues used
by the Registrar's office during
the past year total more than
40,000. Even this enormous
amount of printed matter failed
to meet the demand, and orders
for this year will require 55,000
pieces, according to a conserva
tive estimate.
The recent addition of the
Graduate School of Busiuess Ad
ministration has created a coun
try-wide demand for information
concerning its courses. It is ex
pected that the number of de
mands for copies of this cata
logue will reach 10,000'.
In previous years the General
Information and Announcement
of Courses bulletins have been
in the greatest demand.
The annual printing costs for
these pamphlets comes to nearly
$10,000 and with the expected
increase in demand the printing
bills will likewise take a boost.
