# KERR PLEASED BY VARSITY IN PRACTICE FOR BRONCO GAME
## Santa Clara, Olympic Club to Give Stiff Battles Against Cards 
### Jim Adams 
Coach Kerr seemed satisfied in last
night's practice with the progress his
charges are making, yet had little to
say concerning the Pomona game.
The improvement in shooting was
very encouraging and the team is
gradually learning to play together
with better teamwork.
This week they face two hard
games. Wednesday night the Santa
Clara five comes up to give the Cards
battle and games with the Catholic
school are always hard ones. The
Broncos recently beat the San Jose
Alumni team, which the Stanford five
defeated during the Christmas holi
days, and so the teams will not be far
from an even match, according to the
dope which this common victory gives.
Saturday night the Olympic Club
will furnish the Cards with forty min
utes of stiff opposition. The club has
turned out a good team nearly every
year and this season's squad is no
exception.
As a result of his performance in the
Pomona game and a steady improve
ment, Bill Clark has been placed as
third forward on the squad. He gives
Kerr a reliable reserve for either
Price or David.
