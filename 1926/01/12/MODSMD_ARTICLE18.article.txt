### 
Plans for the approaching tennis
! season will be the subject of a general
| tennis meeting to be held in Room 72
j at the gymnasium at 4 o'clock Thurs
j flay afternoon. All team candidates
i especially former varsity and fresh
man players, are urged to attend.
To determine the final ranking of
j the squad members a form of round
robin tournament has been arranged.
' The players are first given a provi
j sional rating by Hal Davis, tennis j
| coach, and are then required to play,
| challenge matches among themselves. j
The play continues until the end of j
! the quarter, when the two teams will'
! be chosen according to this competi
tive basis.
Last year both the varsity and the
freshman teams were seriously handi
capped in the California matches by
| lack of suitable outside competition.
! This year efforts are being made to
place Stanford in the regular northern j
i inter-club tennis league which will in
l sure the varsity members sufficient
i practice. Several of the stronger
i Peninsula high school teams are being
engaged for matches with the fresh
man team.
