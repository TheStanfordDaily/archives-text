# FIESTA PLAY BY JEAN WARO SELECTED FOR PRESENTATION
## Story Laid in San Francisco; Type of Plot Permits Colorful Sets 
### 
The Fiesta for the spring quarter
chosen for this year is "The Romance
of Resanov, the Russian," by Jean
Ward. Contrary to the usual custom,
this legend will be held at night.
The type and the plot of the story
leaves a great deal of room for color
ful stage settings and for a varied
type of dancing, both group and solo.
The story is laid in San Francisco
about the year 1806. It deals with the
lives and romance of the Russian,
Resanov, and the Spanish maid. Con
chitita. The Tsar of Russia wishes to
increase the commerce of his country
by getting the Spanish settlements on
the Pacific to trade with his ships. To
accomplish this, he sends Resanov to
beg the favor of Jos6 d'Arguello, the
commandante of the San Francisco
presidio.
The first act is taken up with the
meeting of Resanov and Conchitita,
the daughter of Jose d'Arguello, and
the development of their romance.
During this time the Russian obtains
Jos6's permission through the aid of
Conchitita. He leaves to report his
success to the Tsar, promising to re
turn. The second act shows him ex
iled to Siberia for political reasons.
Here he suffers because he is not able
to return to his Spanish sweetheart
and finally is released from his prison
by Death.
The third act is set about forty
years later. It is again in San Fran
cisco and portrays the gay and color
ful Conchitita as a sombre and peace
ful nun. The bright scene in the first
act and the sad and changed scene
in the last form a splendid contrast.
The second act sustains the interest
by bringing in a foreign setting.
