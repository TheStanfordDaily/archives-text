# Encina Commons Requests Piano for Each Dining Hall
## 
### 
To secure a piano for each dining
hall of Encina Commons is the plan
of Charles Dickenson, senior sponsor,
who has officially requested the Comp
troller for funds with which to rent
the instruments.
Dickenson's intention is to arrange
for singing of college songs during
mealtime and thus to promote a great
er feeling of sociability.
Should the Comptroller be obliged
for any reason to refuse the request,
it is likely that Encina Club will un
dertake to rent the pianos.
