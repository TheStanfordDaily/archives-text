# Helping Hands Needed

The manuscript for the Fiesta, the women's bi-annual pageant, has
been chosen. With this decision comes the challenge to every Stanford
woman to take some part in the production. There are costumes to design
—and to make—there are dancing parts to fill, there are tickets to be sold,
there is music to plan, there are programs to publish, there is something
every woman can do, and can do well. If every one does her share a spec
tacular success can be predicted, for the support of the general campus, and
of friends outside the University is assured.
Breaking away from the usual custom, "The Romance of Resanov, the
Russian," this year's Fiesta, will be held at night. The legend adapts itself
well to a night performance, for the plot requires colorful stage settings,
and unusual lighting effects. The story is laid in San Francisco; so is
particularly suited for production at a California university.
There is every reason to hope for success, but it must be remembered
that the best success is hard-earned, and the winning of it will be easy
only if every woman in the University does her share. This is the one
production of the year in which freshmen women can take part, and so
with a unified "500" behind the project we should be able to hope for
success. <
