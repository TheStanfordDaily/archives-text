# Getting Together
## 
### 
Stanford and St. Mary's have agreed to meet on the gridiron in 1927.
When the two teams last met, in 1922, the Cards were barely able to win
by a 9 to 0 scoreâ€”the result of three placekicks from the educated toe of
Murray Cuddeback.
Since that time the teams turned out by the two schools have improved
considerably, and probably proportionately, so that close, well-played games
of football should be the result of the agreement.
It is indeed a fine thing that Stanford and St. Mary's have agreed to
forget the troubles which made them sever relations some time ago. There
is really no reason in the world why the two institutions should not get
together. Proximity makes the Catholic school a logical opponent, and
certainly the high class of athletic teams it offers in competition makes it a
worth-while opponent.
