# Lady Luck and Red Grange
## 
### 
Some one-thousand-and-one theories have been advanced why "Red"
Grange has not proved the success on the professional gridiron that he did
on the amateur with the Illinois eleven.
We would rise to the occasion by submitting the one-thousand-and
second theory. His orange number on his blue jersey was the now-famous
"77." These numbers, supposedly lucky in themselves, if turned upside
down constitute the initials of our old friend "Lady Luck." With her
cognomen so prominently displayed, is it unusual that "L.L." smiled so
favorably for three years upon the red-haired youth?
Whereat we retire, expecting immediately a letter from "Red" him
self, insisting that it was his own ability which turned the trick.
AFTER RECEIVING an anonymous contribution to the Campus
Opinion department relative to distributing the Big Game bonfire wood to
the poor of Palo Alto, the Daily announced that it would print the letter
if the author would make known his name. Yesterday, we received an
other communication from this same author, but this time it was signed
by a "pen name"! It is hard to understand how people can write and sup
port startling opinions and then be afraid to expose their names.
New Charleston dangers discovered by the Daily Illini of the Univer
sity of Illinois:
"Out in lowa, 'the state where the tall enrn grows,' at Coc College, we learn that
the Charleston lias been banned in dance halls hv city officials. The reason was given
that the buildings could not stand the vibrations. If this is true, we greatly fear for
local fraternity and sorority houses where the Charleston practicc lias replaced the
usual fireside 'sessions.' Up at Northwestern a student is said to have broken his leg
while engaged in the latest example of terpsichorean art. The collapse of a Boston
dance hall last summer was attributed to this pastime. dancers arc practically
unanimous in admitting that the dance Charleston is strenuous exercise. Members of
one sorority here are said to be suffering from broken arches due to overzealous
'Charlestoning.'"
Weighty deduction and modest boast of the U.S.C. Trojan indignantly
clipped from that sheet by Dud DeGroot and "Babe" Morrell:
"Jeff C ravath, captain-elect and without a doubt the greatest center seen on the
Pacific C oast for several seasons, does not even rcceive a tumble by Mr. Ricc."

AFTER RECEIVING an anonymous contribution to the Campus
Opinion department relative to distributing the Big Game bonfire wood to
the poor of Palo Alto, the Daily announced that it would print the letter
if the author would make known his name. Yesterday, we received an
other communication from this same author, but this time it was signed
by a "pen name"! It is hard to understand how people can write and sup
port startling opinions and then be afraid to expose their names.
New Charleston dangers discovered by the Daily Illini of the Univer
sity of Illinois:
"Out in lowa, 'the state where the tall enrn grows,' at Coc College, we learn that
the Charleston lias been banned in dance halls hv city officials. The reason was given
that the buildings could not stand the vibrations. If this is true, we greatly fear for
local fraternity and sorority houses where the Charleston practicc lias replaced the
usual fireside 'sessions.' Up at Northwestern a student is said to have broken his leg
while engaged in the latest example of terpsichorean art. The collapse of a Boston
dance hall last summer was attributed to this pastime. dancers arc practically
unanimous in admitting that the dance Charleston is strenuous exercise. Members of
one sorority here are said to be suffering from broken arches due to overzealous
'Charlestoning.'"
Weighty deduction and modest boast of the U.S.C. Trojan indignantly

"Jeff C ravath, captain-elect and without a doubt the greatest center seen on the
Pacific C oast for several seasons, does not even rcceive a tumble by Mr. Ricc."
