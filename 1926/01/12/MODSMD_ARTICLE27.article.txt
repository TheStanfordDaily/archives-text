PERCY PIFFLE'S PLAY REVIEW
(Written exclusively for the Coyote
Creek Daily Owl)
The Anthrapoid Ape—A mystery
play without a plot. The heroine does
some fine acting off stage. We think
that the Ape's features should be
made up a. little more carefully. Per
haps a little rouge on the lips would
help. The leading role is taken to
perfection by Bijunk Bisunk who
spends his time trying to find out who
stole the silver-plated corkscrew.
The Coal Strike —A movie with its
setting in Northern Alaska where is
pictured a struggle between a group
of explorers and a band of elephants.
The plot centers around an attempt
to obtain coal to be used as black
diamond settings for engagement
rings for colored folks. We do not
know what became of the dynamite
that was used to blow up the mine
but the villain was finally foiled and
the gorgeous stones were picked up
from the ground by the thousands. In
the final "fade-out" we see the colored
hero placing a black diamond engage
ment ring on the finger of his affinity
during a total eclipse of the moon in
the smokiest district of Pittsburg
while three black cats cross their
path.
The Studious King—A refreshing
comic opera depicting beer drinking
among the South American Royalty.
Although the name of the production
implies long and arduous boning we
found to our surprise that no one Is
to be seen studying throughout the
entire performance. The plot is flow
iner and sparkling. We do not know
whether root beer or Budweiser was
used in the production.
* » *
A headline says: "Backbone of Sub-
Zero Wave Broken." Although we are
ready to confess that we have never
in all our young and innocent life
actually seen the backbone of a "Sub-
Zero Wave," we infer that it has the
same nerve organs and senses that
all other animals have; and so we
urgently urge that this serious matter
he immediately taken up with'the So
ciety for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals.

Cabbages did not hear this one him
self. but friend turnip whispered it
to him after dinner last night. Afore
mentioned friend turnip was strolling
down the row when he descried a
street cleaner plying his trade. As way
of greeting, friend turnip queried,
"How's business?"
The street cleaner straightened up,
emptiod his shovel, and replied jovial
ly : "Picking up."

The Anthrapoid Ape—A mystery
play without a plot. The heroine does
some fine acting off stage. We think
that the Ape's features should be
made up a. little more carefully. Per
haps a little rouge on the lips would
help. The leading role is taken to
perfection by Bijunk Bisunk who
spends his time trying to find out who
stole the silver-plated corkscrew.
The Coal Strike —A movie with its
setting in Northern Alaska where is
pictured a struggle between a group
of explorers and a band of elephants.
The plot centers around an attempt
to obtain coal to be used as black
diamond settings for engagement
rings for colored folks. We do not
know what became of the dynamite
that was used to blow up the mine
but the villain was finally foiled and
the gorgeous stones were picked up
from the ground by the thousands. In
the final "fade-out" we see the colored
hero placing a black diamond engage
ment ring on the finger of his affinity
during a total eclipse of the moon in
the smokiest district of Pittsburg
while three black cats cross their
path.
The Studious King—A refreshing
comic opera depicting beer drinking
among the South American Royalty.
Although the name of the production
implies long and arduous boning we
found to our surprise that no one Is
to be seen studying throughout the
entire performance. The plot is flow
iner and sparkling. We do not know
whether root beer or Budweiser was
used in the production.

A headline says: "Backbone of Sub-
Zero Wave Broken." Although we are
ready to confess that we have never
in all our young and innocent life
actually seen the backbone of a "Sub-
Zero Wave," we infer that it has the
same nerve organs and senses that
all other animals have; and so we
urgently urge that this serious matter
he immediately taken up with'the So
ciety for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals.

Cabbages did not hear this one him
self. but friend turnip whispered it
to him after dinner last night. Afore
mentioned friend turnip was strolling
down the row when he descried a
street cleaner plying his trade. As way
of greeting, friend turnip queried,
"How's business?"
The street cleaner straightened up,
emptiod his shovel, and replied jovial
ly : "Picking up."
