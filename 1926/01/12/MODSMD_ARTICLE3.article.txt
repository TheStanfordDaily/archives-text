Three decades ago the "wasp-waist
ed and delicate girl" wore from seven
to eight petticoats and various other
garments and her clothing weighed
from seven to twelve pounds, de
clared Dr. Clelia Duel Mosher, Medical
Adviser of Women, in a summary ac
companied with satistical charts on
health and clothing tendencies among
the fairer sex received recently by the
State Department of Physical Educa
tion.
Statistics given in the charts show
that the fashionable length of skirts
has been shortened twelve inches dur

ing the last thirty years and twenty
inch skirts are common today. The
width of young women's skirts in the
past three decades has decreased from
fifty-six inches to about thirty inches.
Stanford women of thirty years ago
were about one inch and two-tenths
shorter in height, weighed three or
four pounds less, and were on the
average older in age when freshmen
than the first-year women of today,
according to Dr. Mosher who bases
her statement on measurements of
4170 women who have attended the
University since that time.
