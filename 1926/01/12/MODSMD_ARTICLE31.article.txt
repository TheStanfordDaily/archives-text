# SPORTS OF 1926
## Two Indoor Sports 
### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Ho hum! .Look what the wrestlers and the billiard
players did to pep up their games in 1925! Just as every
one was ready to believe that "Strangler" Lewis was to be
a perpetual champion, and that Hoppe's defeat by Schaefer
a few years before was just a mistake, and that Willie
would go on ruling the green baise for eighteen or twenty
years more, darned if both of them didn't lose their titles!
Yessir, Wayne "Big" Munn was disrespectful enough to
pick up the Strangler and throw him out of the ring in
Kansas City, seriously injuring Mr. Lewis, and winning for
himself the world's heavyweight wrestling championship.
And Mr. Jake Schaefter, who had previously interrupted, for
one brief year, Mr. Willie Hoppe's long reign as Billiard
King, suddenly acquired a rush of wizardry to his hands
and dethroned his former rival once more. So there you
are —the year only a couple of months old, and a new Mat

King and a new 18:2 Balk-line King crowned already!
The "Ponderous Pachyderms" enact the next scene in the drama. The
action (if any) takes place in Philadelphia. Stantislaus Zbyszko, the original
"So's your old man," and the most agile grandfather of modern times, upsets
Big Munn twice in fourteen minutes!
Next Act—Time: May 30; Places: St. Louis and Michigan City. Joe
Steeher, the "Scissors King," himself a former champion, beats Zbyszko in
straight falls, while "Strangler" Lewis gets revenge on Munn by winning two
out of three falls. And since Lewis never relinquished the $10,000 diamond
studded belt after Munn threw him out of the ring, he claims that he is the
lawful heavyweight champion. But Joe Steeher gets our vote.
Then, to go back to the tables, Edouard Horemans of Belgium, who has as
many vowels in his first name as Zbyszko has consonants in his last, lifted
Schaefer's billiard crown from his head wit ha neat gesture in Chicago early
in December.
Three new mat champions and two new billiard champions, all in one year!
