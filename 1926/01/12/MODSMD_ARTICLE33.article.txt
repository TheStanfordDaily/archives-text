### 
UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS, Jan. 12
â€”A team composed entirely of faculty
members of the University of Kansas
met in annual combat recently with
an all-student team chosen at random
from the campus to establish the grid
iron supremacy of the university.

Officials for the game were: chap
lain, chaperone, water-boy, cheer lead
er, and referee. These positions were
filled by popular professors. A large
crowd attended the contest.

The Class of 1927 of Columbia Uni
versity was the tallest, heaviest, and
youngest freshman class of the pres
ent undergraduates.
