# E. ROBERT SCHMITZ WILL BE HEARD IN CONCERT THURSDAY
## 
### 
In the recital in the Assembly hall
Thursday night of E. Robert Schmitz
music followers of the campus and
the peninsula will have an opportunity
to hear modern music as interpreted
by a recognized master and authority
among the modernists. The young
French pianist comes as the second
artist in the Peninsula Music Associa
tion's Beries of four annual concerts.
The program which he has selected
for his concert here is a one remark
able in every respect, linking as it
does the works of such widely sepa
rated composers as Bach, Chopin,
Liszt, Debussy, Ravel, and the Ameri
can Emerson Wliithorne The recital
will open with Liszt's transcription
of Bach's Fantasie and Fugue in G
minor. The critic of the Chicago Daily
News said of Schmitz's playing of
this monumental work: "He gave a
brilliant performance and accentuated
the fact that he is now one of the
ranking pianists before the public."
Chopin Included
The second group contains three
early selections from Scarlatti and
Couperin. The third group is taken
from tho works of Chopin, "the tone
poet of tho piano." Schmitz, as a per
sonal friend of Debussy, the great
French modernist, will in his fourth
section give an interpretation of that
master's works.
The last section of the program will
come to the present time with selec
tions from Emerson Whithorne's "New
York Days and Nights," a work ultra
modern in both form and subject.
Vhithorne, one of the foremost con
temporary American composers, made
a radical departure in selecting New
York scenes as the source of inspira
tion for an interpretative suite.
Schmitz will play "Pell Street," a tone
picture of the Chinese section of New
York, and "St. Patrick's," in which
the bells of that famous Cathedral can
be heard amidst the sounds of the
metropolitan streets.
Program Chronological
The program is arranged in a
roughly chronological manner, leading
from the early seventeenth century
to the present day. Schmitz, according
to competent critics, has the ability
and artistry to weld such a diversified
selection into a musical unity. His
San Francisco recital on January 6
was divided between the works of
Bach and Debussy, a striking musical
contrast of ultra-classical and ultra
modern. The "Chronicle" critic said:
"It was a long recital; but at the close
I found myself wishing it might be
repeated." The "Examiner" said: "The
audience liked his manner of playing,
bringing out as it did, all the warmth
and vibrant color of the compositions.
Schmitz, since his graduation from
the Paris Conservatoire in 1910, has
been at the very center of the latest
in music. As piano virtuoso, as orches
tra and chorus conductor, as lecturer,
but most of all as a personal friend of
the men who are making the new
music, he has been in the front. He
first visited America in 1919 and was
acclaimed favorably by both press and
public.
