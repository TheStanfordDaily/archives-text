# NOVELTIES SHOW IS COLLECTION OF BEST IN ENTERTAINMENT
## 
### Herbert Klein 
Naming the Novelties show, which
will be produced in the Assembly hall
Friday evening, was not the simplest
thing in the world. Many possible
titles suggested themselves, any one
of which would have described one
particular feature of the show. "Gaie
ties" wouid have done well, for the
show is nothing if not gay. "Follies"
would not have done so well for, ac
cording to Delmer Daves, who is di
recting the show, the only foolishness
outside of Daves' own skit will be on
the part of those who ( do not get their
tickets soon. However, as the show is
novel in idea, in arrangement, and in
presentation, it was thought that noth
ing would do so well as "Novelties."
Prominent among the novel features
will be Peggy Randall's act with
Hawaiian setting and music to match
furnished by Moreno, Fay, Foote, and
Company. Settings are from the hand
of Les Kiler. Ever since her first ap
pearance in "Dulcy" Miss Randall has
been taking a prominent part in cam
pus dramatics.
No campus show would be anything
like complete without the assistance
of Dorothy Dahler. The "Novelties"
have secured her services in two acts.
One will be a comedy song number
in the inimitable Dahler style, and
the other will be as part of Delmer
Daves' new, different, and especially
written skit of a fraternal order lodge
meeting.
Marjorie Allen and Aileen Burke,
will have a headliner in their act of
popular songs put on in a popular
way.
A dramatic presentation of the fam
ous Volga Boat Song will be offered
by the Glee Club in a scenic setting
with costumes to match. The Glee
Club quartette will sing some late
popular songs in special arrangements.
The new Stanford Orchestra, direct
ed by Helen Engel Atkinson, will be
in the pit and play before the show
and as accompaniment for the bur
lesque of "Faust" entitled "I Think I
Smell Smoke," which will be put on
with a genuine grand opera chorus and
first-class vocalists in the principal
roles.
