# SOPHOMORES FURNISH GOOD MATERIAL FOR COACH WOLTERS' NINE
## Loss of Nevers on Mound Does Not Dim Chances For Winning Team 
### 
Crippled though the Stanford fase
ball team is by the unexpected loss
of Ernie Nevers, star hurler, the Cardi
nal nine is far from lacking material
of a most promising nature, and Coach
Harry Wolter expects little trouble in
securing a twirler from among the
various candidates whose work will
compare favorably with that of the
great blonde pitcher.
Tod Oviatt and Steve Collins, both
letter men of last season, are the out
standing contenders for the mound
position. Dinty Moore is another man
who may develop into a good hurler.
Prom last year's undefeated freshman
team comes Bob Philippi, the outstand
ing hurler of the 1928 nine. Mike Rey
nolds and Sobieski are other contend
ers among the sophomore baseballers.
Captain Cuddeback, whose consist
ent fielding and i?ast experience should
undoubtedly win him the third sack,
may be the only infield man not from
the freshman team of last year. Cook
Sypher, captain of the freshman team,
i.3 a cinch for the catcher's job. Sypher
is a catcher of long experience and
one of the best ever seen at Stanford,
according to Wolter.
At first base, Bill McGuire is giving
Chuck Johnston a hard tussle. John
ston has held down the first sack for
the last two seasons and was captain
of the varsity last year. McGuire is a
good performer and has the edge at
present, for his work fits in more
smoothly than Johnston's with that of
the rest of the infield, with which he
played all last season. In the event
that McGuire wins out, Johnston will
probably find a berth in the outfield
for his good batting is too valuable
an asset for the team to lose.
Busch and Garibaldi, two other sec
ond-year men, will likely play short
and second, respectively, for their
teamwork together was always a fea
ture of the freshman games last year.
Both these men bat well.
Competition for the outfield posi
tions is unusually strong. Besides
Draper, a baseball letter man, and
Weaver, both good fielders out for the
position, and Stewart, substitute from
last year, there are Nissen, Bill Clark,
A1 Biaggini, and Nelson David, who
are now playing basketball and may
turn out later in the season.
