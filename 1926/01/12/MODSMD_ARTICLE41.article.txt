"Fashion," or "Life in New York,"
by Anna Cora Mowatt, one of the great
hits of eighty years ago, has been
selected by Masquers Society for its
annual production to /be presented
January 29.
The play was written for a comedy
satire and is very amusing in itself.
Several years ago it was revived by
the Provincetown players in New York
and was one of the successes of the
season. It was acted in the old-fash
ioned melodramatic jwith (the
stage practically rebuilt for the can
dle footlights and antiquated curtain
arrangement.
Carrying out the stage fashions of
the time of the play, the Province
town players scored a hit. The Stan
ford presentation will follow out this
idea to make what is expected to be
one of the most novel productions of
the year.
Some quaint old musical numbers
in "Fashion," which seem very com
ical nowadays, will also be on the
program.
