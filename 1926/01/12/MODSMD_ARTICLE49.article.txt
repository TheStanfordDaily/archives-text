# TROJAN CAGE FIVE TO USE BOYER FOR POWERFUL OFFENSE
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 12.—Whether
the nucleus of an attacking plan can
successfully be built around one man
will be determined at the University
of Southern California this season.
In Capt. Kenny Boyer, All-American
forward, the Trojans have one of the
greatest cagers in the history of the
institution. But he will be practically
alone in the charge for points this sea
son for his star running mate, "Red"
Badgro, will not be racing down the
sidelines with him for several more
weeks. Badgro broke his wrist in foot
ball and has not yet taken out a court
uniform. An untried forward played
; with Boyer Friday and Saturday when
the Southern Califoinians met the
(Utah Aggies in the opening clash of
the season.
Coach Les Turner will probably use
several forwards to team with Boyer.
It is Turner's policy to make no
changes in lineup unless it is abso
lutely necessary, but he will cast aside
this plan for the next two games in
order to pick the man to play with
Boyer.
Jack Bruner will start at center.
Manual Laraneta and Johnny Hunter
will probably play guards.
Southern CaliflDrnia fans are anxious
to see a quintet selected because the
series between the three California
universities opens January 15 and 1G
with the Trojans meeting the Bears
at Berkeley.
The Southern Californians were in
pretty fair condition for the Utah test.
1 hey returned to the campus a week
early during the Christmas vacation
and put in a few evenings of strenu
ous work. The court men also went
through their paces against the Los
Angeles Athletic Club Tuesday eve
ning.
The Aggie team which played here
last week-end is not the same one
which has been touring the Southland
during the holidays. The latter outfit
hails from the Utah branch college.
