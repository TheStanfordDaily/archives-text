# Better Buildings Urged For Quake Protection

WESLEYAN UNIVERSITY, Jan. 12
—Although the possibility of an earth
quake along the Atlantic Coast Is
slight, there is need for a world-wide
campaign for better buildings to in
sure earthquake safety since the un
expected is always liable to happen,
according to Professor Wilber G.
Foye, of the Geology department, who
recently spoke to the Middletown
Scientific Association.
By means of a diagram he pointed
out the various fault zones along the
Atlantic Coast, one of the most marked
being the one which follows the Con
necticut Valley. Since the mountains
of New England are not rapidly grow
ing there is no historic nor geologic
ground to prophecy a disastrous dis
turbance.
Boston would be more affected than
New York if such a quake should oc
cur, according to Professor Foye, who
explained that New York has a founda
tion of solid rock, whereas Boston is
largely built on made land and glacial
sands which would be likely to slide
under the lateral shove of earthquake
waves.
