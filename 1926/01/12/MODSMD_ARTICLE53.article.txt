# STUDENTS SWINDLED Barber Held for Hearing PROFESSORS INVOLVED

Barbers have been known who are
versed in politics; many have spieled
on wine, women, and song, but the
first claiming to have supernatural
powers has been located in Europe,
and a story pertaining to him pub
lished in the McGill Daily.
A certain barber, while following
his trade, has branched into a sideline
of considerable interest. Having on his
list of customers the registrar of the
university and several students, he
proceeded to capitalize on the fact.
Students who were desirous of his
services and who had special mes
sages as to their conditions, could, for
a stipulated amount, have their trou
bles communicated to the faculty,
along with their excuses.
When the registrar enters for his
daily shave, the barber would urge him
to pass Student X in his particular
trouble. The influence is extended in
definitely to include all the members
of his clientele.
Since this plan has been tried, the
barber has registered one failure, one
more trial, and finally, one entrance
to the jail at La Hore to answer swin
dling charges.
Students demanded that the barber
return the money, as he had not ful
filled his part of the bargain, and they
had flunked in this or that subject.
Poor and foolish students felt they
could not lose between $125 and $200
with no results.
Roaches were found devouring
theses of Columbia University's
Ph.D.'s in the library.
