# RAM'S HEAD WILL CONTINUE TRYOUTS FOR ANNUAL SHOW
## Final Cast Should Include Nearly One Hundred Campus Actors 
### 
First tryouts for the Ram's Head
Show will continue this afternoon and
tonight. The times and places have
been set for 4 to 6 o'clock in the As
sembly hall and from 7 to 10 o'clock
tonight in the basement of the Engi
neering building. Second tryouts will
begin Wednesday.
Wednesday a list of successful try
outees will be posted on the Green
Room bulletin board. It will also be
published in the Daily Palo Alto.
A large cast of eighty or ninety
people will be selected for this show,
and it is necessary that about 500 try
outees be considered, according to
Dave Manoccir, director of the show.
Thus far only one hundred have 'ap-
peared. Last year there were about
300 tryoutees.
All men students are eligible for
parts in the show, but freshmen are
especially desired.
