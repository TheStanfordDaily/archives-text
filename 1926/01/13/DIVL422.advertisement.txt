The "Low-Down" on
C. J. Caesar
Caius Julius Caesar has been dead 1,967 two months and
and eighteen days. And yet, after all that time, Caesar is considered
a great military genius. We have his word for it that he was.
It is only by examining contemporary historians and then put
ting two and two together that we are able to determine that as a
military commander C. J. was considerable of a washout.
For an example of his military prowess, when he attempted an
invasion of Britain, he anchored his fleet off the cliffs when a safe
harbor was just around the corner, and after great sacrifices finally
succeeded in landing an army through the surf. But the storm came
up and pounded his fleet to pieces and the invasion failed.
Never at any time did Caesar exercise more than a nominal
authority over the Gauls. The minute his back was turned to make
a triumphal return to Rome, the Gauls promptly forgot all about him.
In fact, the net result of his Gallic wars was only to irritate them
to such an extent that they later swept down on Rome and made an
awful mess of things.
Yet, Caius Julius Caesar is still considered a great military
genius, because all through his writings he stressed the fact that
he was such.
Still, some people say it doesn't pay to advertise.
