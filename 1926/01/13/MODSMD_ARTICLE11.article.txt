### Clif Moore 
By Clif Moore

Better basketball and cleaner play
ing featured the second day's competi
tion in the annual intramural hoop
series played yesterday afternoon in
Encina gymnasium. The games were
faster and more interesting, and were
nearly devoid of roughness that was
so apparent on the opening day. Fol

from El Capitan, 11 to 6; Alpha Delta

team's eleven points. Both teams dis

With the score standing at 3 to 2
for the Alpha Sigs at the end of the
first half, Ferguson got the range of

rapid succession. El Capitan made a
game effort to overcome the fraternity
team's lead in the last minutes of the
game, but the Alpha Sig guards tight
