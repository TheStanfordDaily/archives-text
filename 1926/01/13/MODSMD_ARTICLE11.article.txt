# CLEANER PLAYING SHOWN IN SECOND DAY OF TOURNEY
## First Rounds of Intramural Play Completed in Four Leagues 
### Clif Moore 
By Clif Moore

Better basketball and cleaner play
ing featured the second day's competi
tion in the annual intramural hoop
series played yesterday afternoon in
Encina gymnasium. The games were
faster and more interesting, and were
nearly devoid of roughness that was
so apparent on the opening day. Fol
lowing are yesterday's results: Juni
pero Serra Club defeated Phi Gamma
Delta, 14 to 6; Alpha Sigma Phi won
from El Capitan, 11 to 6; Alpha Delta
Phi beat Alpha Kappa Lambda, 14 to
10; Theta Xi trounced Encina lE, 32
to 7; Phi Kappa Psi defeated Los
Arcos, 15 to 4; and Kappa Sigma won
by default from Encina 2E.
The Junipero Serra players exhib
ited an effective offensive against the
Fijis, and worked the ball down the
floor continually. Brown was the main
cog in the offense and it was his pass
ing and shooting that counted for the
main part of the winners' score. He
is credited with eight points. The fra
ternity quintet displayed- a marked
inability to find the basket and missed
many shots that should have counted
for goals. Condit played a good game
at center for the Fijis, and Chase
starred in the running guard position.
The score at half time was 6 to 2.
Ferguson Stars
The Alpha Sig-El Capitan tussle was
featured by the clever playing and
shooting of Ferguson, Alpha Sig for
ward, who accounted for nine of his
team's eleven points. Both teams dis
played a rather listless type of game
that was livened occasionally by Fer
guson's baskets from the sidelines.
With the score standing at 3 to 2
for the Alpha Sigs at the end of the
first half, Ferguson got the range of
the basket and sank three shots in
rapid succession. El Capitan made a
game effort to overcome the fraternity
team's lead in the last minutes of the
game, but the Alpha Sig guards tight
ened up enough to check El Capitan's
rally. Reed, El Capitan forward,
showed to best advantage for the club
team.
A.K.L.'s Stage Comeback
The Alpha Delt-A.K.L. tilt developed
into a lively affair after the Alpha
Delts had taken an 8 to 2 lead at the
end of the first half. The A.K.L.'s start
ed a varied offensive in the last period
that threatened seriously the seeming
ly safe load held by their opponents.
Harnett, A.K.L.'s star forward, found
the hoop for three baskets in the sec
ond half that nearly proved enough to
even the count.
The Alpha Delts exhibited a smooth
ly working offensive during the entire
game and worked the ball up within
scoring distance on nearly every ad
vance. Holman was the outstanding
player for the winners, and it was his
clever floor game that resulted in
many of the Alpha Delt's scores. Evans
played a stellar defensive game for
the Alpha Delts and prevented the
A.K.L.'s from running up a bigger
score by his effective guarding. Duck
etts showed to advantage in the cen
ter position for the winners.
En.cina 1E Weak
Theta Xi had an easy time with
Encina IE and had little difficulty
running up a 32 to 7 score. Scofield,
at forward, and Anderson, center,
vied for high point honors with ten
points each. Scofield played a brilliant
game throughout, and his clever pass
ing resulted in the majority of Theta
Xi's points.
Encina displayed practically no
knowledge of the game, and with the
exception of occasional flashes of
speed, gave the Row players little op
position. Theta Xi played a smooth,
short-passing game and succeeded in
working the ball under the basket on
numerous occasions. The score at half
time favored Theta Xi, 10 to 3. -
Phi Kappa Psi proved too fast for
Los Arcos in the last game on yester
day's schedule, and captured the deci
sion with a score of 15 to 4. The
fraternity quintet had a decided ad
vantage in teamwork and experience,
and outplayed Los Arcos in every
phase of the game. Knox starred for
the winners with five points. Fraser
took second honors with four markers.
Walling, Los Arcos forward, was the
outstanding player on the club team.
