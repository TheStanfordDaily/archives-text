# NEW RADIO RECORDS SET BY STANFORD STUDENT'S STATION
## 
### 
Long distance amateur radio com
munication records are being broken
regularly by radio station 601 which
is owned and operated by Brandon
Wentworth of Branner hall, who has
made and assembled all the apparatus
on a hill west of the Quad.
When Wentworth established two
way communication with the U.S.S.
Scorpion, located off Trieste, Italy,
and also with another amateur at
Johannesburg, South Africa, he estab
lished a new amateur record for the
Pacific Coast that will probably stand
for some time. Recently Wentworth
"worked" amateur station G-2SZ, Lon
don, and was the first "ham" in North
ern California to connect with the
British Isles. He has also communi
cated with stations in India, Australia,
and South American republics.
Amateur station GOI is an official
relay station of the American Radio
Relay League handling a large volume
of traffic in addition to its long dis
tance communication. Its owner is
also one of the two operators of the
University radio station 6XBM and
sends out radio frequencies bi-weekly
under the direction of the United
States Bureau of Standards. Professor
H. H. Henline is in charge of this
service at Stanford.
During the recent Santa Barbara
earthquake, Wentworth was first to
establish outside communication after
the telephone and telegraph wires had
been destroyed. He established com
munication with the H. M. Storey,
lying in the San Pedro harbor using a
spark set. The amateur operated his
set for four days and nights and han
dled all commercial traffic out of the
city as well as responding to individual
messages.
Three assistant operators, Stanford
men, work with Wentworth at the sta
tion â€”Charles P. Burgess, Phil Scofield,
and Walter A. Nelson.
