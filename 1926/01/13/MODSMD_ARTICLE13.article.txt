# SCRIBES WILL SELL SIZZLING SINKERS TO SHIVERING STUDENTS
## 
### 
Red-hot doughnuts on an ice
cold morning is what Theta
Sigma Phi will offer at the cut
rate price of one nickel each to
morrow morning. The sale will
start at 8 o'clock and will be
located in front of the Women's
Clubhouse.
The women journalists, believ
ing in all things seasonal, have
decided that hot pastry for mid
winter consumption is more ap
propriate than ice-cream cones
which have been traditional for
the last ten winters.
Theta Sigma Phi feels justified,
therefore, in taking this rash
step, and hopes that the student
body will show official sanction
by buying out the sinker stock
Thursday morning before the ped
dlers freeze to death in discharge
of their duty.
