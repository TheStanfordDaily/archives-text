# PRACTICAL SIDE OF EDUCATION IS NEED OF SOVIET RUSSIA
## Slavic Educator Claims That Younger Generation Realizes Task 
### 
"Education in its practical relation
to life is the need of the present gen
eration of Russia," said* Dr. Anna
Louise Strong in her lecture on "Edu
cation Movements in Soviet Russia"
given in the Little Theatre last night.
"The younger people feel the need of
developing a great land and people
and are very anxious for an education
in order to help their fellow men to
gain a higher life.
"In the past two years a flood of
inexpensive literature from the Soviet
printing house at Moscow has been
sent to reading huts in the Russian
villages. By this method the govern
ment is seeking to popularize new
laws, methods of industry, and agricul
ture and social unity." Other import
ant results of the Soviet regime as
outlined by Dr. Strong were the great
development of the drama by village
productions, and the drive against
illiteracy.
"Even higher education is treated
from the practical standpoint and col
lege preparatory courses are given at
the universities for energetic leaders
of the workers and peasants. In addi
tion to passing a stiff scholarship ex
amination, applicants wishing admit
tance to institutions of higher learning
must pass a social examination which
determines whether they should be
admitted or not.
Dr. Strong declared that, although
preference is given to leaders of the
people at the universities, students not
born of peasant parents are not ex
cluded. "Russian students are not liv
ing in luxury or being pampered, but
are a very hard-working lot, and their
social life is nothing when compared
to that of this country.
"The development of self-expression
on the part of the school children and
the close relation of school instruction
to productive work are the two main
characteristics of the Russian educa
tion movement today. In the children's
homes, committees of the inmates do
all of the various jobs. A sense of
social relationship and responsibility
has been developed in the Russian
children by the modern education.
"Although there are still only a
small minority of teachers trained in
the new methods, strenuous attempts
are being made to the teaching
standards of Russia. The spread of
summer schools and the energetic
work of the Department of Education
has brought about a great develop
ment of education. Intensive educa
tional work is going on among the in
dustrial groups and factories send
workers to the university so that they
may teach their fellow workers."
