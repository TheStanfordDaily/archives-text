# SANTA CLARA, STANFORD FIVES GUSH IN PAVILION TONIGHT
## Broncos Have Good Defense; Offensive Work Found Less Certain 
### Jim Adams 
Santa Clara should prove a fair
match for the Stanford basketball
team tonight when they meet at 8
o'clock in the pavilion. The Broncos
are said to play the same style of
game as the Cards and have a fairly
strong defense but a rather doubtful
offense.
Although Captain Maley and McCor
mack are the only veterans from last
season, Coach Wilson, who is new at
Santa Clara this year, has developed
a team which compares favorably with
former Mission squads.
Wilson is well known in the bay dis
trict as a coach, having been mentor
of the Stanford basketball squad in
1917 and coach of the St. Mary's foot
ball team from 1918 to 1921. He suc
ceeds Eddie Kienholz as coach of bas
ketball at Santa Clara.
In the two games that the Broncos
played against the Stanford Alumni
Club of San Jose they were defeated
in the first match but came back in
the second game and beat the Stanford
Grads by a decisive score. During the
vacation period the Card varsity won
two games from the /Alumni five in
practice tilts.
A tentative lineup announced by
Coach Wilson yesterday placed Draper
and Balini at forwards, Captain Maley
at center, and McCormack and Barsi
at guards.
Jayred did not report for practice
yesterday on account of a heel bruise,
but will probably be in shape to start
tonight. Mitchell is scheduled to be
back at the running guard berth. The
rest of the lineup will be the same as
in former games with Price and David
at forwards and Anderson at standing
guard. Through the steady improve
ment of Bill Clark Coach Kerr is given
a reliable reserve who can be used
either at forward or center.
