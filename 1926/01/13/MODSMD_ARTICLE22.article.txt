Now that the cold spell seems to have settled down upon us with
determination, it seems necessary to call the attention of the campus to
the dangers from common colds and contagious diseases of like character.
Stanford's climate is somewhat tricky—when we leave for classes we never
know whether it is going to be biting cold or balmy at noon, and so many
of us are likely to be clothed in a wrong fashion for the mid-day tempera
ture. These sudden thermometer changes are very conducive to colds and
really endanger the health of the entire student body at this time of the year.
Dr. Mosher, head of the Women's Physical Education department, is
requesting all women to report at once to her department or to their house
mothers for examination at the first sign of infection. This is a wise step
and should go far to safeguard the health of the entire campus.
An ounce of prevention pays an hundredfold in the end, and students
will do well to stop random running around and take to their beds if they
are threatened by a cold of any seriousness. This will protect the indi
vidual as well as the other members of the University community.
