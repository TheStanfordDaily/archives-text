# A 						Chance at Fame

Ram's Head is conducting try-outs for its annual production which
will be given in the near future. Reports last night were that some 150
men had tried out for places on the cast or chorus. Last year at this time
more than 300 men had done their song and dance in an effort to gain a
place in the show.
Freshmen in particular should try for places in this show. Should
even a position in the chorus be secured it will give valuable experience
which should serve as a stepping stone to parts in junior operas or campus
dramas. Many of the present campus satellites received their start in
such an inauspicious way.
The trials will be conducted during the rest of this week and it is the
hope of the Daily Palo Ai.to that a good proportion of the freshmen as
well as many upperclassmen will be on hand during this period. The fun
of trying out is worth the trouble even if the initial efforts do not meet
with success.

SOME TIME AGO the Daily announced that the students of Yale
University had voted to abolish compulsory chapel. Despite the petition
of 1,900 undergraduates for its abandonment compulsory chapel will con
tinue at Yale for this year at least, according to The New Student. The
Special College Chapel Service committee in reporting on the petition,
recommends that the rules remain unchanged for a year "as graduate
opinion and the Yale Corporation must be considered."
And from this we are forced to believe that the students are not run
ning the universities.

Gigantic battle of wits in Oklahoma as reported by the Oklahoma
Daily:
"OKLAHOMA CITY Jan. 7.â€”University of Oklahoma spellers defeated the
Oklahoma A. and M. college in a hard-fought "bee" in the Central High School au
ditorium Thursday night.
"Last year, in the first intellectual contest between the two schools, the university
won a cross-word puzzle match from the Aggies.
"The six words missed by the Aggies were "possess," "abridgment," "alumnus,"
"irresistibility," "mustache," and "acknowledgment."
"Excitement among the several hundred of persons witnessing the match rose to
high pitch when Fred McWhorter, captain of the Sooners, and Mrs. A. S. Hiatt, of
the Aggies remained opposing one another after teammates had been spelled down.
Mrs. Hiatt stumbled on the word "debauchee," and McWhorter was declared indi
vidual champion."

Progress of materialism at the University of Oregon as reported in
the Oregon Emerald:
"If husbands of the future are not happier men it will be no fault of the Uni
versity library force, for whom seven copies of "A Thousand Ways to Please a Hus
band" by Ixtuise Bennett Weaver and Helen Cowles Le Cron, have been ordered."

Greed at Obcrlin College:
"Albion, Mich, gave Oberlin her first football victory this year. Oberlin has every
intention of taking from Albion the first basketball victory as well. But still Oberlin
is not satisfied, for Oberlin is to take from Albion her city manager."

History in the making as chronicled hy the College of Pacific Weekly:
"Archania lias changed its Greek letters from Alpha Lambda Sigma to Alpha
Kappa Phi."

Equal Rights for Women condemned at the University of Oregon by its
Emerald:
"Why should the nicotine girlies get so much publicity over the smoking of
cigarettes? Like the wearing of sweatshirts it will lose its charm if the habit spreads
to the multitude."
