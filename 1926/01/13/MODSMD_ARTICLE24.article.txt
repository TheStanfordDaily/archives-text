# SPORTS OF 1926
## Form Will Tell 
### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
By "FEG" MURRAY, '16

Which do you prefer, the bathing girl or the skating
girl? Summer sports or winter? Or do you like to mix
them up, and put on your bathing suit and get on a surf
board and be towed by an automobile over snow roads, or
get into your winter togs, and strap on your skis and ride
the waves behind a speedy motor boat?
According to the figures (and figures don't lie, especially
in the case of bathing girls and skating girls), the Queen
of the Steel Blades can cover 100 yards six times as fast as
her sister who swims in the warmer (and softer) water.
The winter sports girl can travel over the ice in other
ways, the most exciting being in an Ice boat, that has sail
boating beaten ten city blocks for thrills.
Skiing affords numerous methods of attaining speed, too,
for you can be towed by a horse, an auto, or an airplane,
or even attach a motor and a propeller to your back. Water

sports cannot match these thrills, although some claim that going a mile a
minute in a motor boat has any other sport wiped off the map for excitement.
Water polo certainly cannot match ice hockey as a spectacle.
The bathing girl, in fancy diving, can nearly, but not quite, compete with
the fancy skater in grace and rhythm. And how early these "kids" attain
that much-sought "poetry of motion," too! Aileen Riggin was Olympic diving
champion at 14, and Lonya Henie, of Norway, only 12 years old, was one of
the star performers in fancy skating at the last Olympic games.
Then there is Miss Loona Sullivan, who does combine summer and winter
sports! She cut a hole in the ice each winter at Manchester, N. H., and dives
through it from a height of sixty-five feet!
