# CABBAGES and THINGS
## EDUCATION, WHAT IS IT? 
### Monroe Eaton 
A recent inquiry at the University
of Oklahoma as to why women go to
college revealed that out of every
hundred, fifteen came because the
homo town was too dead in the winter
months, five to learn the Charleston
and three to teach it, eight to become
collegiate, two for a last fling before
they married, one to hang onto her
prep school beau, a,nd one to get a
husband.
With a correction of about forty-five
to the last two categories, Cabbages is
forced to agree that these figures must
be correct.

In order to keep prospective college
women's parents from spending their
money unnecessarily, we think it
would be an excellent idea for univer
sities to establish extension courses
on the Charleston in the various large
cities and small villages throughout
the United States.

Provided the above statistics are
tiue for Stanford women it seems quite
useless for men students to "make
checks payable to Stanford Univer
sity." A much more inspiring and logi
cal motto would be, "Make checks pay
able to the Benefit of the Women of
Stanford University."

In order to accommodate co-eds ond
nspiring freshmen it would be quite
propitious for someone to start a Col
legiate Department in the universities
with a requirement of 180 units of A's
in collegiate courses, and an ability
to sing the song, for the A.B. degree.

If women come to college to catch
or prevent from being caught, some
arrangement should be made to have
June weather, a fnll moon, and canoe
ing on Lagunita throughout the entire
year. Junior proms should be given at
least once a week.

After noticing that a man at North
western University broke his leg do
ing the Charleston, Cabbages thinks
that it would be a good idea to have
an ambulance waiting outside during
all campus dances.
• • *
Now that Toyon Club is about to
give a dance to which only campus
women may be invited, the import tax
may drop.
• ♦ ♦
The idea of an all-co-ed dance is a
pood one. Perhaps a few men will be
fortunate enough to become acquainted
with some of the campus women.
