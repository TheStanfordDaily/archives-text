### 
The Editor, Sir:
Is it permissable to call your atten- j
tion to the fact that the reasoning un
derlying your editorial on increased
endowment in last night's paper is on
all fours with that of the small hoy's
essay on pins: "Pins have saved a
great many lives by not swallowing
them"?
In one department, this last quarter,
a man was "flunked out" in his senior,
year with an "intelligence test" grade |
of 104—while in the same class the
man who was number one in one of
the advanced required courses where
the students are graded competitively
liad an "intelligence test" grade of 54.1
If these were exceptional results they
would not be worth mentioning. But
they are not —at least, insofar as en
gineers are concerned.
My limited investigations incline me
to the belief that many of the publicity
stunt claims for the intelligence test
are fallacious. It would be well to
make fewer claims and determine
more facts.
Yours for straight thinking,
—G. H. Marx.
