# PROFESSOR SMITH WILL EDIT SUMMER DAILY PALO ALTO
## 
### 
During the coming summer quarter,
the Daily Palo Alto will be published
; by the Journalism department, under
! the supervision of Prbfessor Everett
W. Smith, instead of by an individual
student, as has been the case in the
past. This was agreed upon by the
Executive Committee in its regular
meeting last night, after receiving a
; request to the effect from Professor
Smith.
The Journalism department will give
! three classes which will work in con
; nection with the Daily. The reporting
: and news writing class will serve as
; the reporters and gather material for
! the paper; the editorial class will read
j copy and edit the sheet; Professor
Smith will be the editor-in-chief and
will select a manager to run the busi
ness end.
This is the first summer in which
the Journalism department has given
| classes, and it is considered that run-
I ning the Daily will make a splendid
opportunity to give the students prac
tical as well as theoretical work. Be
sides the news writing and editorial
classes, there will be a special class
! for teachers who supervise the editing
; of papers in their high schools.
Professor Smith hopes to be able to
j put the paper out twice a week, in
stead of once a week, as in the past.
He considers that with the enlarged
group who will be working there will
be a great deal more news, and hence
a more interesting paper. He also pro
poses to turn over the profits that
might accrue to the editor to the bet
j tering of the paper and the equipment
j of the Journalism department, buying
' cuts and other special equipment.
