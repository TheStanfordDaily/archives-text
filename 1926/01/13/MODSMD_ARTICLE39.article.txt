# SCHMITZ PROMISES UNIQUE PROGRAM IN CAMPUS RECITAL
## 
### 
E. Robert Schmitz, who will give a
piano recital in the Assembly hall to
morrow night, occupies a position in
the world of music that is unique.
As a leader and apostle of the mod
ernist movement in music, he is an
jiuthoritative player of the new com
positions, yet he is also recognized
as a sympathetic and inspired inter
preter of such old-time classics as the
compositions of Bach and Scarlatti.
Schmitz comes as one of the Penin
sula Music Association's artists. He is
a relatively young man and has been
on the concert stage for only fifteen
years, but has in that time acquired an
enviable reputation in Europe, and is
developing a following in America
since his first appearance in this
country in 1919.
Schmitz is known here chiefly as a
piano virtuoso. He organized and con
ducted a chorus in Paris soon after
his graduate from the Conservatorie
where he took first prize for his piano
playing. Later he organized and led
a 60-piece orchestra. Schmitz has
often appeared as conductor, soloist,
and lecturer on the same program. His
lecture in San Francisco on "The Mod
ernists of Russia and Germany" this
month is one of the features of the
Ida Scott Gregory fortnightly series
of lectures.
The program selected for perform
ance tomorrow night with John Se
bastian Bach's famous "Fantasie and
Fugue in G Minor (transcription by
Franz Liszt) running through Chopin,
Diszt, and Debussy down to our own
Emerson Whithorne, the recital could
almost be used as an illustrated lec
ture on musical masterpieces of all
ages.
The closing group of numbers will
contain two tone pictures from Emer
son Whithorne's new suite "New York
Days and Nights" which attempts to
depict scenes in and around the
world's largest city in music that is
both startling and effective. The two
scenes chosen are "Pell Street," a pic
ture of the Chinese quarter, and "St.
Patricks," named after that famous
metropolitan cathedral whose bells are
heard ringing and choirs are heard
chanting mingled with the sounds of
Broadway. Fifteen pieces will be
played arranged according to com
posers.
