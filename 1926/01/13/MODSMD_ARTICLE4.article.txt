Roble Club is planning an icy
reception for their guests on the
night of the Roble formal, Feb
ruary 5. The lobby will be deco
rated as a winter carnival, in
the midst of the snow season.
One feature will be the house that
Jack built, done in a winter ef
fect. Special features, of a novel
nature, are promised for the sup
per dance. Miss Frances Boone,
prominent in campus dramatics,
will give a clog and soft-shoe
dance. In spite of the chilly at
mosphere, other notables may
participate in the supper pro
gram.
The big feature of this dance
are the plans for a "rough hand
out." This tradition has been
neglected on the campus in the
last few years, and the Stanford
"rough" is in danger of being left
out of the handouts.
