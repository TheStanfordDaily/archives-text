# Iowa Debating Team Will Make 1927 European Trip

### 
lOWA CITY, Jan. 13â€”The debate
team of the University of lowa has
been selected by the Institute of Inter
national Education to make the trip
to Europe as the American representa
tives in 1927. It is the custom of the
Institute to send, each year, one team
from America to debate the teams in
Europe. This custom was begun sev
eral years ago when Bates College
sent men to debate Cambridge and
Oxford. Since that time three Ameri
can teams have made the trip with all
expenses paid. This action results, in
the estimation of the Institute, in bet
ter understanding between the stu
dents of the different countries and in
the improvement of the style of de
bate on both sides of the Atlantic.
There is a possibility that two teams
instead of one will take the trip on
1926.

County clubs were recently formed
by students of the University of Kan
sas.
