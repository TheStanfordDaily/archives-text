# FRESHMAN SQUAD TACKLES RICHMOND FIVE HERE TONIGHT
## Husky Hunt's Team Improves Offense But Defense Still Weak 
### 
The freshman basketball team will
meet the Richmond High School team
in the pavilion tonight at 7 o'clock as
a preliminary to the varsity game.
Coach Hunt has been drilling his men
in the art of passing and a strong of
fense is beginning to take form. The
running guard position is still giving
Husky trouble, as he has found no one
capable of playing this post to his
satisfaction. Weakness in defense is
still apparent, but is offset by a clever
passing attack.
Endo and Sexson will be given a
chance to show their worth in the
forward positions tonight. Both these
men looked good in practice yesterday
and are slated to start the game. Sex
son was in the game Saturday night
against Berkeley High and showed
promise of developing into a regular
forward. He has an excellent eye for
shooting baskets and is one of the
best floor men on the squad. Endo was
in the Berkeley game for only a few
minutes, but his work during practice
earned him the right to start.
McCandless will start in his regular
position at center. He is high point
man for the scoring this season and is
one of the main cogs in Hunt's scoring
machine.
The guards will start the same as
last Saturday, Lewis and Marks play
ing these positions.
