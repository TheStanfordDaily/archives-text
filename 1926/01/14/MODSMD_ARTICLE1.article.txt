# GLEE CLUB NOVELTIES SHOW WIDE REPERTOIRE IN PROGRAM
## Feminine Stars to Present Popular Song Numbers Tomorrow Night 
### 
Results of the final rehearsal of the
super-Novelties indicate one of the
best attractions of the year for tomor
row night in the Assembly hall. The
entire twelve acts have been groomed
to surpass any show given on the
campus in recent time. The finest of
Stanford's dramatic, vocal, and terpsi
fhorean talent, assisted by the new
Stanford orchestra, will combine to
present a thoroughly complete produc
tion.
Among the acts calculated to attract
particular interest are those staged by
leading feminine stars of the campus
stage. Aileene Burks and Marjorie
Allen will present a series of popular
songs in their own inimitable manner.
Peggy Randall will appear in an act
•of her own. A special Hawaiian set
ting with appropriate scenery of Les
Kiler's design will be used for this
act, while Moreno, Fay, and Foote will
furnish appropriate music. Dorothy
Dahler will complete the feminine
representation with a humorous song
number. Miss Dahler has a distinctive
ly individual style, which has won her
•consistent success in plays and en
tertainments.
Hal Boone and Van King, light
footed performers of Football Show
fame, will present a dancing number
in conjunction with the music of the
Glee Club seven-piece orchestra. They
promise more fancy steps and turns
than ever before.
Delmer Daves has written a comic
skit especially for the Novelties. The
setting for this bit of nonsense is in
the grand temple of the "Ancient Or
der of the Wheel Whose Every Spoke
is a Standard of Truth," and the action
takes place in the form of a meeting
of the aforesaid lodge presided over
by the "Exalted Keeper of the Opal
•Gate," played by Delmer Daves him
self. Further impossibility will be in
sured by the presence of the women's
auxiliary under the leadership of Dor
othy Dahler as the "Big Noise of the
Women's Auxiliary of the Screaming
Eagles Who Fly by Night."
Ensemble numbers by the Glee Club
will present to the campus for the first
time the new repertoire which was so
successful on the club's Thanksgiving
tour to Carmel and Del Monte. A pan
tomimic picture will illustrate the fam
ous "Volga Boat Song" as sung by
the club. Scenery, lighting, and cos
tumes have been specially arranged
for the whole spectacle.
