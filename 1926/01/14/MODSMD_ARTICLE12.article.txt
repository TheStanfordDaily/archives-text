### Herbert Klein 
The first campus musical event of
the season will take place in the
Assembly hall tonight at 8:15 o'clock
when E. Robert Schmitz, noted French
pianist and musical leader, gives a j
recital as part of the Peninsula Music 1
Association's annual concert series. !
In bringing Schmitz, the association j
is giving Stanford and the surround- i
ing region an opportunity to hear a !
man who is a masterful and brilliant 1
performer, an outstanding figure in
the world of modern music, and a dar
ing and original program planner, j
Schmitz is a player who has pleased
the public by his fiery and virile play
ing, while at the same time delighting
the critics with a technique that is '
almost unrivaled and a sincerity in I
interpretation that indicates an under
standing of the composers' intentions. |
As a youth Schmitz played well on
the violin and the piano. After enter
ing the Paris Conservatoire he devoted
himself solely to the to such good '
effect that he graduated in 1910 with I
the first prize in piano playing, i
Schmitz made a name for himself i
after his graduation as an all-around
musician, for he first a [
chorus and then a sixty-piece orches- 1
tra, which he led for some time and '
which is still in existence in Paris i
under his name. The concerts of this ;
orchestra were events in the musical j
world, for many new works were pre- j
sented at them for the first time.
Schmitz has been a champion and j
popularizer of modern music in his I
piano concerts also. He was the first j
to perform the works of Debussy, now ,
recognized as one of the most original |
figures of modern music. An entire J
group on tonight's program is devoted 1
to Debussy compositions.
Schmitz, who has been termed "a j
modernist of the modernists," numbers !
among his friends the following world- j
famous composers: Vincent d'lndy, j
Igor Stravinsky, Eric Satie, Paul i
Dukas, Claude Debussy, and many
others. He does not devote hip pro-1
grams exclusively to modernistic.
works, however, but is also a notable !
player of Bach and Chopin, as well as
other classics. The "Fantasie and
Fugue in G Minor" by J. S. Bach
will open the program tonight, and
will be followed by a group of Chopin's
compositions.
The last section will be of decided
interest to all followers of American
music. Two selections from a very
recent and novel composition by Emer
son Whithorne will be played. They
are: "Pell Street" and "St. Patrick's"
from the suite, "New York Days and i
Nights," which is practically the latest J
in modernistic music writing, harsh j
and discordant at times, yet vigorous ;
and compelling interest.
Schmitz made his first visit to the
United States in 1919 and has ever j
since been a favorite. He appeared on !
the Pacific Coast two years ago in i
concert with Jacques Thibaud, the!
well-known French violinist.

Schmitz made a name for himself i
after his graduation as an all-around
musician, for he first a [
chorus and then a sixty-piece orches- 1
tra, which he led for some time and '
which is still in existence in Paris i
under his name. The concerts of this ;
orchestra were events in the musical j
world, for many new works were pre- j
sented at them for the first time.
Schmitz has been a champion and j
popularizer of modern music in his I
piano concerts also. He was the first j
to perform the works of Debussy, now ,
recognized as one of the most original |
figures of modern music. An entire J
group on tonight's program is devoted 1
to Debussy compositions.
Schmitz, who has been termed "a j
modernist of the modernists," numbers !
among his friends the following world- j
famous composers: Vincent d'lndy, j
Igor Stravinsky, Eric Satie, Paul i
Dukas, Claude Debussy, and many
others. He does not devote hip pro-1
grams exclusively to modernistic.

player of Bach and Chopin, as well as
other classics. The "Fantasie and
Fugue in G Minor" by J. S. Bach
will open the program tonight, and
will be followed by a group of Chopin's
compositions.
The last section will be of decided
interest to all followers of American
music. Two selections from a very
recent and novel composition by Emer
son Whithorne will be played. They
are: "Pell Street" and "St. Patrick's"
from the suite, "New York Days and i
Nights," which is practically the latest J
in modernistic music writing, harsh j
and discordant at times, yet vigorous ;
and compelling interest.
Schmitz made his first visit to the
United States in 1919 and has ever j
since been a favorite. He appeared on !
the Pacific Coast two years ago in i
concert with Jacques Thibaud, the!
well-known French violinist.
The first campus musical event of
the season will take place in the
Assembly hall tonight at 8:15 o'clock
when E. Robert Schmitz, noted French
pianist and musical leader, gives a j
recital as part of the Peninsula Music 1
Association's annual concert series. !
In bringing Schmitz, the association j
