# WOMEN'S CONFERENCE PARTY IS POSTPONED
## 
### 
In memory of Laura Gardiner, who j
died suddenly Tuesday night, the Wo- j
men's Conference party planned for 'â– 
last night was cancelled at a late hour j
yesterday afternoon. As plana had j
been made to have no dinner served j
in the living groups last night, the i
supper which was to have preceded J
the meeting was held in the Clubhouse.i
This action was taken by Women's '
Council, which plans to hold the party 1
next Monday. The program will be the
same as that planned for last night, '
Dean Yost and Mildred Worswick giv- j
ing speeches, and the senior and j
sophomore classes presenting stunts. I
