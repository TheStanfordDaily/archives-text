## 
### 
"Copper from Mine to Consumer"
j will be the subject of a lecture illus
| trated by moving pictures to be given
by G. J. Piersol of the San Francisco
j agency of the American Brass Com

this evening. The talk is under the
auspices of the Stanford Branch of
the American Institute of Electrical!

and any others who may be interested
are invited to attend.
A five-reel motion picture will be
j shown demonstrating the mining, re

: and brass. The first part of the picture 1
I will show the process of taking the
| copper ore from the Anaconda copper i
| mines and the smelting of these ores
j in the Anaconda smelter. The second
i part of the film deals with the refining j
j of copper to a purity of 99.9 per cent
j and with the making and casting of
brass.
The manufacture of sheets, strips,
| rolls, rods, wire, and cable in the J
j modern brass mill are shown in parts
four and five. The uses of copper and
brass in the home and laboratory and
the methods of testing these metals
| are illustrated in the last reel. It is
being shown here especially for the
benefit of electrical and mechanical j
| engineering students who will be in
; terested in the processes of rolling j
I and wire making.
