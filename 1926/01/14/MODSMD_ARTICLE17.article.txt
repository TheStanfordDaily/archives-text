# VARSITY COMES BACK TAKING 31-7 VICTORY FROM BRONCOS
## Second Half Rally Runs Up Big Score for Card Basketball Team 
### Jim Adams 
After being held to a 6 to 4 score in
the first half the Stanford basketball
team came back in the second period
and piled up a raft of points to beat
the Santa Clara five by a score of 31
to 7. The heavy Mission team pressed
the Cards hard until the better team
work and superior shooting of the
latter broke their stubborn defense
and paved the way for the large score.
The second half was marked by the
playing of Clark and Vincenti, who
worked together like twins and ac
counted for two field goals each in
this period. David was also in good
form and made several pretty shots
from difficult positions.
Price, David, and Clark tied for high
point honors, each contributing six
points. During the first half both teams
had considerable difficulty in shooting,
although attempts were frequent. The
scoring started when a new combina
tion of Price, David, Clark, Vincenti,
and Anderson went in at the begin
ning of the second frame.
The fast teamwork of the two sopho
mores, Clark and Vincenti, speeded up
the play of the whole team. The pass
ing was better, and the offense got
away to a fast start, thanks to the well
directed passing of Anderson. He puts
the ball into play the instant he gets
his hands on it, and thus enables the
Cards to get under way before the
other team gets set.
Anderson put up a brilliant game at
standing guard. He let the Broncos
near enough the basket to slip in a
close one only once, all their other
points being made on fouls or long
shots.
Jayred was suffering from a bruised
heel and did not get into the game.
Rupe started at center but was soon
relieved by Clark. Shipkey and Mit
chell each saw service at running
guard the first half, but Kerr kept
Vincenti in the berth the entire second
period.
Santa Clara substituted frequently.
All their men were big and heavy, and
put up a fairly good defensive game
in spite of what the score of the
second half indicates. The Broncos
had difficulty in making any of their
shots register and were ragged in
their passing.
The summary follows:
Stanford (31) Santa Clara (7)
Price (C) (6) F McAuliffe (1)
David (6) F Draper (3)
Rupe (3) C Malley (C)
Shipkey G McCormick
