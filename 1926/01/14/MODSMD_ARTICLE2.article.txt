# WATER POLO SQUAD TAKES UP PRACTICE FOR COMING SEASON
## 
### 
Preparation for the coming water
polo season began in earnest this week
when both varsity and freshman teams
worked out in Encina pool under the
instruction of Coach Ernst Brandsten
last night. Last week was spent by
the squads in swimming for condition
and practice in handling the ball and
from now on until February 13 when
both the freshmen and the regulars
will play California teams practice
will be held daily. Both games with
California will be played in the Encina
pool with the regular 90-foot distance
between goals.
Brandsten has set the time for prac
tice at 4:45 o'clock in order to avoid
the early darkness. Workouts will con
tinue as yesterday with one game for
the first-year men followed by the
varsity scrimmage. Brandsten, after
the freshman practice, expressed his
belief that the freshmen would have
a first-class team this year with a lit
tle more practice. There is still an
opportunity for freshmen to come out
for the squad. Bob Burns and Cal
Strong so far have played the best
game for the first-year men, due to
their ability to handle the ball, but
others on the squad are rapidly im
proving.
Arden Allen, this year's captain,
Bob Williams, Art Stewart, Van den
Akker, and Harry Maltby were among
those in the varsity lineup. In the
team which opposed them were Bob
Harris, Herb Klein, Frank Treist,
Dixon Smith, and two men from the
freshman squad.
