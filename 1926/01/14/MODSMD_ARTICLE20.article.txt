Fundamentalism, Dayton, Tenn., the debate l>etween Clarence Darrow
and the late William J. Bryan almost forgotten by newspaper readers, re
turned to the public memory with the filing in the Supreme Court of Ten
nessee on January 10, of the brief for defense in the Scopes trial. The
case will be taken up in the higher court in February.
The case has now been whittled down to a question of the constitution
ality of the anti-evolution laws. The defense contends that the statute is
unconstitutional and violates both the state and the federal constitutions
in that it "invades religious freedom by giving a preference to a religious
establishment in the public schools." The defense will also seek to prove
that the law is an unwarranted abuse of the power of police of the state.
If the supreme court decides that the Tennessee statute is constitu
tional it will be one of the most backward steps taken in the United States
this century. Ilow can a group of men be so narrow minded that they
would withhold the knowledge gained by scientific investigators from the
children of any section of the country? Progress can only come when
science has first blazed the way. The men who developed the theory of
evolution did so in the interests of humanity and not as some sort of a
shell game with which to bamfoozle the multitudes. It is hypocrisy to
keep their discoveries and theories concealed.
And even in California the question must be given some consideration.
A Stanford professor has declared that forces are already at work to at
tempt to throttle the youth of this state with a law opposed to the teaching
of evolution in public schools. It seems hard to believe that such a thing
could ever happen in this state â€”but if this professor is right we must
keep alert and be ready to oppose such legislation should it ever appear to
be forthcoming.
