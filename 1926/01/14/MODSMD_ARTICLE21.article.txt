# Pavilion Rowdyism
## 
### 
With the basketball season in full swing, it seems the unavoidable duty
of the Daily Palo Alto to issue a Pavilion Primer of Conduct.
In the past, it was the custom that one attended basketball games to see
basketball played—which was very interesting indeed. Certain elements
in the student body, however, seem to have become obsessed with the idea
that basketball is the minor sport of the evening; that shouting "queener"
and whistling at the entrance of visiting women is the major sport. The
rest of us sit by and listen to it—which is very uninteresting indeed.
One hopes that it is only freshmen who are guilty of such attempts to
change the focal point of interest. That is, we hope and in fact believe that
students of longer residence than one quarter in the University are pos
sessed, with saner ideas of conduct.
A Stanford "rough" is so dubbed primarily from appearance; less from
action. Actions that may bring him within the confines of the definition of
a, Stanford "rough" will, however, still include him in the definition of a
"gentleman." Freshmen will always stumble at the explanation of the
word "rough"—and it seems that many have stumbled the past week.
"Rowdyism" includes many forms of deportment and among them can
be placed the acts observed at the games thus far; acts consisting of de
cisive shouts of "queener" to couples and of whistles to strange girls.
Such acts have never been the custom of Stanford men and never will
be. Undertaken by a few, undoubtedly those of tender age and thoughtless
behavior, they result in discredit to the entire student body.
