Laura Isabella Gardiner, who died Tuesday night, was one of the most
prominent of the Stanford women athletes. She was particularly out
standing in tennis, basketball, and swimming and was also tennis manager
for the coming season.
The heads of the women's physical education department have discon
tinued basketball practice—the sport in which she was most adept—for two
days. This is a fitting tribute to one who stood for good sportsmanship
and who exemplified the finest type of college woman.

Albon Holden, who criticises inaccuracies found in the selections of
All-American football teams by various writers in no uncertain language
in the Big Ten IVcckly speaks in his own accurate language as follows :
Another All-American team that amused me was the Liberty team selected by
Hugh Fullcrton, the Bugs Baer of the baseball writers, in collaboration with the
"seventy-five leading coaches." I had been led to believe by the Hearst papers that
Mr. Rocknc, whose team lost two games, Mr. Jones, whose team lost two games, and
Mr. Smith, whose team also lost two games, were the leading coaches of the country.
Surely there cannot be seventy-two leading coaches in addition to this triumvirate of
genius.

Blushing modesty at New York University:
"The prominent array of local talent which will perform next Monday and
Tuesday cannot be equalled by any other college show in the country."
