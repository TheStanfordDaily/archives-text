# SPORTS OF 1926
## Invading Athletes 
### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Among the numerous foreign athletes who will visit us
during the coming months are Mr. Charles Hoff, of Norway,
and Mr. Paolino Uzcudun, of Spain. Such a variety of
immigrants has not appeared since two years ago, when
the combination of "Spinach and Applesauce," in the per
sons of Epinard, the French race horse, and Firpo, the
"Wild Bull," put in an appearance.
Mr. Hoff, as can readily be seen (I hope) from the draw
ing, is a champion pole-vaulter. In fact, I will go so far as
to say that Hoff has gone so high as to set several world's
altitude records, his latest, and the current record, being 13
feet, 11 and 13-16ths inches. That, you will admit, is SOME
VAULT.
Mr. Paolino (for some Bay that is his last name) is a
prize-fighter and Tex Rickard hopes that he will attain
even greater heights in his line of endeavor than young Mr.

Hoff has done in his. Paloino is called "The Tiger of the Pyrenees" and also
"the Basque Woodchopper." Mr. Bill McGeehan, New York sports writer,
suggests lhat if Paolino is ever matched with Dempsey, he be allowed to take
Lis 27 into the ring with him to make it an even fight. "And," he adds, "any
u.!"*; that happened woiihl be all for the best."
Cnarley Hoff, the Norseman, has it all over Paolino for class, in my esti-
Hoff, besides being the world's greatest pole-vaulter, is a remarkable
a.l-around athlete, an especially great broad-pumper and middle-distance run-
Lawson Rob' 'son, coach of the 1924 United States Olympic team, was
loud in his praise of Hoff, while "Sparrow" Robertson, the Sage of Paris, does
not think so much of Paolino. I never did like Latin in school, either.
