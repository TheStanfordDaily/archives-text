Look these names over —all of them from the sport pages of
December, 1925. The first four were in the lineup of the Providence
Steamrollers who defeated Grange's Chicago Bears in Boston, the
other four were in the international chess tournament in Moscow.
Kozlowski, Eckstein, Golembeski, Oden —Grenewsky, Rubinstein, Wer
linsky, Reti. Mix 'em up. "The Steamrollers kicked off with a
King's Bishop's Gambit, Genewsky taking the ball at KB4. An end
run around their opponents' castle was rooked, etc., etc."
