"EDUCATORS UPHOLD COSMET
ICS; .DON'T INTERFERE WITH
HEALTH, THEY SAY"—(Headline,
Temple University Daily).
Maybe cosmetics don't interfere
with health, but there are lots of
things that they do interfere with,
especially at a university such as
Stanford where there are so many
gullible freshmen (also countless
upperclassmen) who are led wander
ing far astray from the fields of knowl
edge by the delightful, artistic, and
thrilling color effects produced by
moonlight playing on delicately rouged
lips.
In addition, there should be cited
emphatically the many practical dis
advantages of cosmetics insofar as
they directly affect members of the
masculine masses. Considering how
few women use "Kiss-proof Rouge."
we ask you all to seriously think of
the dangers of tell-tale marks which
might mar the features of modern
Romeos as a consequence of some
chance osculatory embrace.
Ponder also gentlemanly (and un
gentlemanly) reader upon the possible
dire results of surplus powder on fe
male faces (rice powder, etc.), irritat
ing manly nostrils to such an extent
that the Romeos now under discussion
are subject to extreme fits of uncon
trollable sneezing.
We must confess that the whole
topic is liable to be explosive and
ticklish, but even though we have suf
ficient courage to thresh the situation
out at length, lack of space prevents
us from filing further foolish argu
ments against the bounteous use of
sometics. —C. W.

Do you find that you are sniffing?
And in sleep with snores you choke?
Do you find that halitosis
Is for you no more a joke?
Then a panacea, brother,
You will welcome with delight,
And your sleep will be a pleasure
Thru' the watches of the night.
o
You will neither sniff nor snuffle;
Blow your nose with loud some toot!
For the cure is really simple
And is cheap enough, to boot!
Just procure some powdered sugar;
Slip it in a paper cone;
Sniff a large and husky whiffle;
And 'twill quickly clear your dome!
You can feel your halitosis
(letting feeblnr day by day.
If you sweeten up your headpiece
In this powdered sugar way. —L.A.B.
