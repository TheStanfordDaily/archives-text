# BASKETBALL SEASON OPENS AT BERKELEY WITH U. S. C. GAME
## California Squad Supported By Veterans; Southern Team Formidable 
### 
BERKELEY, Jan. 14.â€”Well supplied
with veterans in nearly all positions,
the California basketball squad will
take the floor in the Oakland audi
torium next Friday and Saturday
against a strong U.S.C. quintet in the
first contest since the resumption of
athletic relations.
Among those who are the basis for
the Bears' hope of retaining their
title of Conference champions are
George Dixon, Vernon Carver, guards;
Bill Higgins, center; and Captain
"Benny" Holmes, Milton Butts, and
Francis Watson, forwards.
Practice throughout the Christmas
vacation has kept the Bears in fair
shape, but according to Coach "Nibs"
Price a fully-finished team has not yet
been developed. The Blue and Gold
squad is working on a fast offensive
combination this season to counteract
its comparative weakness at standing
guard.
Though reports say that the Trojans
have the weakest basketball team in
years, the Trojans have been winning
steadily during their practice season.
Ineligibility and injuries have com
bined to keep the squad at reduced
strength.
Friday night will mark the first
meeting between the University of
Southern California and the Univer
sity of California athletically since
the breach of two years ago. The two
teams will play the second game of
the steri*s Saturday evening.
The freshman basketball prospects
at Berkeley are bright, as a large num
ber of former high school stars have
been working out under Coach Clinton
Evans. At present, Dougery and Wyatt,
former Berkeley high players, are
playing the forward position; Corbin,
Piedmont high, center; and Gregory,
also of Piedmont high, and Clymer,
Berkeley high, are holding down the
guard positions. The Bruin yearlings
will play preliminary games to the
U.S.C. contests.

The coaching staff of the University
of Illinois is the largest and oldest in
the country.
