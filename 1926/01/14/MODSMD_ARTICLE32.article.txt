"All For You" —Wilkes Theatre
| Aided by a chorus with some novel
\ specialties which were really novel
ties, Nancy Welford, late of "No, No,
Nanette," and William Gaxton, "All
For You" affords an enjoyable evening.
Miss Welford, who took the role' of
Alice Gray, has blue headlights, just
as well trained as they were in her
former play, as well as a charming
1 personality. Gaxton is funny as John
| Henry, and has some clever wise
I cracks. In looks and mannerisms he
seems to be resembled by the local
! celebrity, It. Irving Anscliutz.
The part of Peggy, ordinarily played
by Madeline Cameron, was taken last
night by her understudy, Marie Mar
ritt, who (lid very well as John Henry's
sweetheart, just back from Paris. Dee
i Loretta, in the role of Countess
Natalie Del Monte Veccio about whose
| home most of what is of a plot
is concerned, did an interesting and
unusual bit of characterization. Wilbur
! Cushman as Mr. Gray, Alice's father,
Frank Dawson and Dorothy Merrill in
minor roles were well cast.
| "All For You," the theme song, was
| the most catchy number, with "Mr.
| Cozy Corner Man" a close second. Al
though members of the chorus were
not all Follies queens by any means,
the English Rockets are the best
trained group that the reviewer has
ever seen on the San Francisco stage.
• "The Skeleton Dance" was an exceed
: ingly clever number, and "Capering
Coppers" served to exploit the preci
sion and technique of these ten danc
ers.
Corrine Templin did an effective
specialty in which she managed a
scarf of unusual length with much
grace, and Eddie Allan's eccentric
numbers lacked only a cigar to make
I t|iem a glorified "Frisco" of a few
years past.
The sets were attractive, and some
of the costumes very pretty. Fairly
■ good show—it runs off without frag
j ging, and is enjoyable without any
; great mental exertion. What more
j could a big butter-and-egg man or a
I college student ask? —I. S.
