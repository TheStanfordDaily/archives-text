# French Club Presents Program of Two Plays
## 
### 
The Cercle Francais successfully
presented two comedies in the Little
Theatre last night for the benefit of
French war orphans.
"La Paix Chez Soi," an amusing
satire on married life, was cast with
Barbara Ann Eubanks, as the queril
ous wife, and Joseph Donnay, as the
husband, who gave a good perform
ance. The second play, "La Plaisan
terie," employed the old plan of the
patient at the mercy of his dentist.
A particularly effective part was the
exaggerated dental instruments that
Marcel Touwaide, the dentist, flour
ished in the face of his unfortunate
patient.
The plays were directed by Eleanor
Davidson and Garth Winslow, with the
assistance of Professor Schwartz of
the Romanic Languages department.
