# Oregon Aggies, Marquette Plan Intersectional Game
## 
### 
An intersectional game will be
played at Milwaukie on Thanksgiving
Day, 1926, between the Oregon Aggies
and Marquette University. According
to comparative scores of last season a
close game is to be expected, as both
colleges have practically the same
teams for next year.

An all-university convocation at the
University of Syracuse will replace
the usual chapel.
