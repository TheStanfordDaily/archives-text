# MORE STUDENTS USE APPOINTMENT OFFICE SERVICE DURING 1925
## All Graduates From Six Departments Register For Positions 
### Frank Baker 
More students are taking advantage
of the appointment office every year,
according to Mrs. Snell, appointment
secretary, and as shown in her annual
report, 1272, or 38.1 per cent of the
3312 students in Stanford during 1924-
25 earning all or part of their college
expenses. This 1272 is made up of
f>4.l per cent of the men in the student
body, and 25.4 per cent of the women.
Of the graduates last year 266 or 31.1
per cent of the 805 to complete their
work, were registered with the appint
ment secretary.
All graduates from the departments
of education, English, bacteriology,
Germanic languages, mathematics, and
physiology were enrolled in the ap
pointment office. More inquiries were
received by the office for teachers
than it could supply. Some 1676 orders
for teachers were sent in by school
systems in ten states and ten different
foreign countries. Two hundred and
seventy people were placed in posi
tions with salaries ranging from $1100
jto $5000 and aggregating a total earn
ing capacity of $557,718. Men who had
graduated as far back as 1900 were
secured positions.
For non-teaching jobs the appoint
ment office received orders for 298
persons, from 167 different firms, lo
cated in seventeen California cities,
besides those coming from ten other
states, China, and the Hawaiian Is
lands. Ninety-seven were placed and
have a total earning power of $126,348.
Part-time workers who earned $76,-
802.92 (board figured at $30 a month
and room at $10) rendered great ser
vice to people near the campus. This
is an increase of $22,857.68 over the
previous year's earnings. Of the 2107
requisitions for the services of stu
dents 790 were for regular work
throughout the quarter, and 1317 for
strictly temporary work. The figure
for steady jobs last year was 632,
making an increase of 158. The total
earnings of the full-time workers was
$27,089.45.
The above figures on self-supporting
students are made possible because of
the complete statistics kept on each
student who receives work through
the office. Mrs. Snell has instituted a
system for keeping a record of just
how much is earned on each job, and
how long the job lasts. These statistics
have enabled the office to be in a
position to tell in a great many cases
whether a job coming one particular
place is the right kind for a certain
person.
The appointment office charges no
fee for placing people, except a nomi
nal sum from graduates for the ex
pense of gathering information for
their particular cases. As a conse
quence the University suffers a con
siderable loss every year, and pays
the deficit, usually about two-thirds
of the expense of the office, as one of
its regular functions.

work, were registered with the appint
ment secretary.
All graduates from the departments
of education, English, bacteriology,
Germanic languages, mathematics, and
physiology were enrolled in the ap
pointment office. More inquiries were
received by the office for teachers
than it could supply. Some 1676 orders
for teachers were sent in by school
systems in ten states and ten different
foreign countries. Two hundred and
seventy people were placed in posi
tions with salaries ranging from $1100
jto $5000 and aggregating a total earn
ing capacity of $557,718. Men who had
graduated as far back as 1900 were
secured positions.
For non-teaching jobs the appoint
ment office received orders for 298
persons, from 167 different firms, lo
cated in seventeen California cities,
besides those coming from ten other
states, China, and the Hawaiian Is
lands. Ninety-seven were placed and
have a total earning power of $126,348.
Part-time workers who earned $76,-
802.92 (board figured at $30 a month
and room at $10) rendered great ser
vice to people near the campus. This
is an increase of $22,857.68 over the
previous year's earnings. Of the 2107
requisitions for the services of stu
dents 790 were for regular work
throughout the quarter, and 1317 for
strictly temporary work. The figure
for steady jobs last year was 632,
making an increase of 158. The total
earnings of the full-time workers was
$27,089.45.
The above figures on self-supporting
students are made possible because of
the complete statistics kept on each
student who receives work through
the office. Mrs. Snell has instituted a
system for keeping a record of just
how much is earned on each job, and
how long the job lasts. These statistics
have enabled the office to be in a
position to tell in a great many cases
whether a job coming one particular
place is the right kind for a certain
person.
The appointment office charges no
fee for placing people, except a nomi
nal sum from graduates for the ex
pense of gathering information for
their particular cases. As a conse
quence the University suffers a con
siderable loss every year, and pays
the deficit, usually about two-thirds
of the expense of the office, as one of
its regular functions.
More students are taking advantage
of the appointment office every year,
according to Mrs. Snell, appointment
secretary, and as shown in her annual
report, 1272, or 38.1 per cent of the
3312 students in Stanford during 1924-
25 earning all or part of their college
expenses. This 1272 is made up of
f>4.l per cent of the men in the student
body, and 25.4 per cent of the women.
Of the graduates last year 266 or 31.1
per cent of the 805 to complete their
work, were registered with the appint
ment secretary.
