# COLLEGIATE PARLEY ON WORLD TRIBUNAL LAUDED BY E.W. BOK
## 
### 
The following article was written
for the Daily Princetonian by Edward
W. Bok, noted author and donator of
the Bok Peace Prize. It was published
at the beginning of the recent Inter
collegiate World Court Conference:
"To every delegate to the Intercolle
giate World Conference:
"I am happier than I can say to
have the Princetonian give me the
chance to say a word to you. To me
your coming together is the realiza
tion of a dream. To think of several
hundreds of you traveling from dif
ferent parts of the country to discuss
the World Court is nothing short of
exhilarating.
"''lt makes the blood run freer. It is
exactly what I have deeply hoped and
longed for: to see you young fellows
take an interest in what your country
is doing and should do to achieve and
maintain the peace of the world.
Elders Need Youth
"We elders need you. You can in
ject into this entire question of inter
national relations the tonic of your
younger vision and fresher idealism.
Our blood is running a bit sluggish.
Where we plead, you can insist. For
the future of this country is yours:
not ours. And you have a perfect right
to speak out and say what kind ot a
country it is that shall be handed
over to you.
"In this question of our relations to
the world, you can be particularly
valuable, with the sense of good sports
manship upon you to see that your
country shall play the game. Thus
far, it has not. We have been long
on talk and very short on action.
Proposed in 1900
"Consider how we have played the
game with the World Court: About
26 years ago we presented the plan
of a World Court to the rest of the
nations. Note the time: 26 years ago,
for too many are saying that the
World Court was born of the League
of Nations, which came into being 19
years afterward. We tried three times
to form the Court. Finally it came into
being, and 48 nations joined it: all the
great nations,' except the United
States.
"This is the sort of a game we have
been playing. It is a game into which
you can put the fresh blood of fair
dealing.
New Deal Needed
"We are sadly in need of a new deal.
Not only in this question of the World
Court, but with regard to other ques
tions. I say this because I hope you
won't begin and end with this pil
grimage. Make your voice heard with
a clear ring on this question of the
World Court.
"Don't be afraid to speak out. It is
clear speaking that we need. There
are men in Washington who seem to
be extremely hard of hearing.
Continue Efforts
"But let not this be the end of your
splendid start. Make it only a begin
ning. You have in your hands here
and now the chance to lay down the
foundation for a powerful permanent
organization to include the stream of
fresh young blood that is to come into
your colleges and which you can direct.
Be the founders of something that will
stand when you leave Princeton.

The responsibility of attending class
es at French universities is left en
tirely to the students.
