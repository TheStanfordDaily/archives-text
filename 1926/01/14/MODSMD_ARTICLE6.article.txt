## 
### 
"The student movement in China is
an effort on the part of students and
thinkers to solve China's problem on
the basis of creating a system adapta
ble to the country," declared Paul
Meng in a lecture, before the Cosmo
politan Club last night at the Y.M.C.A.
Meng is secretary of the Committee
on Friendly Relations Among Foreign
Students and secretary of the Chinese
Student Christian Association in the
United States.
"The keynote of the Chinese prob
lem," he said, "is readjustment through
creative thinking, in an effort to com
bine the best in western life with the
best in eastern civilization and to
adapt it to China. The student move
ment in China is probably more highly
organized and knows better what it
wants than any other youth movement
in the world. Social consciousness, a
new birth of nationalism, conscious
ness of need of recovering rights and
justice due China are direct results of
the Student Movement.
"The majority of college students
is not thinking along social progress
but is drifting without any social con
viction. However, there is a minority
seeking to direct the future of the
world and nurturing cosmopolitanism,
the fraternity of nations," said Meng,
who in the last year and a half has
visited seventy-three colleges and uni
versities in thirty-one states in Amer
ica.
Tienkai L. T'an, president of the
Chinese Club, gave a short talk on
"The Doctrine of Cosmopolitanism."
Two vocal solos were sung by Ben
jamin F. Culver, associate secretary
of the Y.M.C.A.
During the business meeting which
followed the speaker's program, Mar
cario G. Naval was elected a member
of the club.
