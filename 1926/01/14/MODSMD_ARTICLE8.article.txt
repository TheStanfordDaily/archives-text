# FRESHMEN DEFEAT RICHMOND HIGH IN SLOW GAME, 33-21
## Hunt's Men Improve After Failing to Score Well In First Half 
### Clif McDowell 
Getting off to a slow start, the fresh
man basketball team won a 33 to 21
victory from the Richmond High
School team in the preliminary game
last night. Coach Hunt's team was
able only to hold their own in the first
quarter, this period ending with each
I squad having four points. Hunt sent
in a new squad for the second quarter
that showed little better form than
the starting quintet, holding the Rich
mond team twelve to eight at the close
of the half.
The freshmen began to play some
thing that resembled real basketball
in the second half and had no trouble
in running up points, although the
defense was still weak. The Richmond
forwards were able to get plenty of
shots at the hoop.
Sexson, who started at forward for
the frosh, made several long shots
during the game, one of his throws
going in from the center of the court.
McCandless, center for the babes,
again came out high-point man. amass
ing thirteen of the yearlings' points.
Richmond sent several fresh men
into the game during the last quarter
that gave Hunt's team considerable
trouble. Dyer, forward for the visitors,
played a stellar game and dropped
several shots through the basket from
difficult angles.
The starting lineups were as fol
lows: Stanford'—Crafry and Sexson,
forwards; Lewis and Marks, guards;
McCandless, center; substitutes, Sib
bett, Osmonson, Kopp, Davis, Brown,
Worden, and Wilton. Richmond —Vil-
lalovas and Dyer, forwards; Barbierie
and Mulicivich, guards; Johnson, cen
ter; substitutes, Clark, Gualdoni, and
Santille.
