# OLYMPIC QUINTET EXPECTED TO GIVE CARDS REAL TEST
## Clubmen Have Clever Team; Have Played Together Two Years 
### Jim Adams 
With the Stanford team just about j
hitting its stride a good test of what
their capabilities are will be offered
tomorrow night when they go up
against the strong Olympic Club five
in the pavilion at 8 o'clock. The Club
team is largely composed of the same
members who have made up the team
for the last two years and who, con
sequently, have played together
enough to develop a fast and clever
quintet
This year the Olympic Club seems j
to be playing a rather erratic style of i
basketbal. They have been beaten by
a few teams around the Bay district
but have, on the other hand, defeated
some of the best. On their good nights
they are a hard team to stop.
The California-Olympic Club game
was called off last week on account of
the sudden death of Andy Smith. This
game would have given opportunity
for a good comparison of the Card and
Bear teams.
There will probably be no change in
the Stanford lineup with the excep
tion that Mitchell may be back at
standing guard. Jayred has recovered
from his slight injury and should be
in good shape tomorrow night. Coach
Kerr will undoubtedly give the two
sophoinorea, Clark and Vincenti, a
chance to see some action.
Just what the Cards can do on the
defense against a scoring team will |
probably be shown against the Olym- j
pics. The Club team includes a few j
sharks when it comes to shooting bas- j
kets and the guards on the Stanford j
team should have a busy night. The I
exact strength of the Cards' defense j
has not been tested since the game j
with the Grizzlies, but at that time
Kerr's men were not far enough along I
in their training for their showing to !
indicate much.
