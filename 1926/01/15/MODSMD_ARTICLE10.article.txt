"Women play an important part in
the student movement of China," said
Paul Meng in an interview yesterday.
Mens spoke at a meeting of the Cos
mopolitan Club Wednesday. "The wo
men in Peking are doing a good deal
toward the movement and established
an industrial school for poor girls in
1920. Women students as well as men
students publish papers and have
street speakers as part of the program
in the Student Movement."
Meng is a supporter of the Renais
sance in China and was one of the
lenders in a patriotic demonstration
of the Student. Movement which took
place in Peking in 1919. He is general
secretary of the Chinese Student
Christian Association in the United
States and secretary of the Committee
on Friendly Relations Among Foreign
Students.
"There are approximately 2,500.000
students and thinkers enlisted in the
student movement of China and both
men and women are working together
in this field. Monthly and weekly
papers are published and street-speak
ing is carried on as a means of pro
moting the movement in the country.
"Mass education, which is an effort
on the part of the students to give
short courses in reading and writing
to those who can not go to school, is
being promoted by the student move
ment. During the last few years educa
tion of the mass has become a definite
movement, highly organized, with paid
workers and experts. Since the first
efforts in mass education made in
1919, the illiteracy in China has been
reduced from ninety-five per cent to
thirty-five per cent. Chinese adults
are eager for instruction. Compulsory
education has only been enacted since
1911.
"That the Chinese women are not
backward in modernism is indicated
by the fact that the only bank in the
world which is managed and financed
by women is in Peking."
