# ROBERT SCHMITZ PROVES CAPABLE, FINISHED ARTIST
## Noted French Pianist Pleases Appreciative Audience In Concert 
### Music Critic 
Superlatives seem to have been de
vised in order to describe playing such
as that of Robert Schmitz, French
pianist, whose concert in the Assem
bly hall last night was the second
event of the annual Peninsula Music
Association's Artist series. Schmitz is
a really great artist and possesses a
technique seemingly able to respond
to any demands that may be made
upon it. Though he could easily have
done so, Schmitz never made his spec
tacular technical ability the chief at
traction of his playing. With all his
energy and vitality he remained the
type of performer that people go to
listen to, not to watch.
Program Varied
A program more varied # in its de
mands upon an artist than that played
last night could hardly have been ar
ranged. It held such extremes as the
marital and thrilling Chopin "Polon
aise" to the delicate "Sister Monica"
by Couperin, and had modern and
ultra-modern works of the most exact
ing sort. Schmitz never seemed to
make an effort or slight a note; in
stead, he was as easy as though he
had been playing a simple exercise.
In the first number, Bach's "Fantasie
and Fugue in G Minor," Schmitz's
artistry became apparent. Though he
played the fugal passages with a speed
that required the utmost in dexterity,
every tone was clear and distinct. The
second group of classical compositions
by Couperin and Scarlatti the pianist
put new vitality in old forms.
Schmitz proved himself a Chopin
player of delicacy and understanding
on the third group. All the romance
and enchantment of the works were
brought out, without any of the cloy
ing sentimentality that sometimes
spoils these compositions. Schmitz
played always with feeling but never
let his emotion run riot without the
check of his intelligence and mental
understanding.
Audience Pleasel
Debussy's works as he played them
seemed easier to follow and less mys
tifying than usual. This was probably
because Schmitz always, in whatever
he played, brought out the melodic
line clearly and distinctly. The num
ber "Dance" by -Debussy showed
Schmitz to be a master of the most
complicated rhythms and tempos.
The audience seemed to take kindly
to th,e two most radically modern
numbers on the program: Emerson
Whithorne's tone pictures of New York
entitled "Pell Street," and "Chimes of
St. Patrick's."
The program closed with Liszt's
"Mephisto Waltz." Here Schmitz
showed that he could be as forceful
and astounding as any modern player
with his almost unparalleled technique.
As an encore he played another mod
ern piece, "Fireworks," preceding it
by an explanatory talk in excellent
English. The audience was decidedly
appreciative at all times.

to th,e two most radically modern
numbers on the program: Emerson
Whithorne's tone pictures of New York
entitled "Pell Street," and "Chimes of
St. Patrick's."
The program closed with Liszt's
"Mephisto Waltz." Here Schmitz
showed that he could be as forceful
and astounding as any modern player
with his almost unparalleled technique.
As an encore he played another mod
ern piece, "Fireworks," preceding it
by an explanatory talk in excellent
English. The audience was decidedly
appreciative at all times.
Superlatives seem to have been de
vised in order to describe playing such
as that of Robert Schmitz, French
pianist, whose concert in the Assem
bly hall last night was the second
event of the annual Peninsula Music
Association's Artist series. Schmitz is
a really great artist and possesses a
technique seemingly able to respond
to any demands that may be made
upon it. Though he could easily have
done so, Schmitz never made his spec
tacular technical ability the chief at
traction of his playing. With all his
energy and vitality he remained the
type of performer that people go to
listen to, not to watch.
Program Varied
A program more varied # in its de
mands upon an artist than that played
last night could hardly have been ar
ranged. It held such extremes as the
marital and thrilling Chopin "Polon
aise" to the delicate "Sister Monica"
by Couperin, and had modern and
ultra-modern works of the most exact
ing sort. Schmitz never seemed to
make an effort or slight a note; in
stead, he was as easy as though he
had been playing a simple exercise.
In the first number, Bach's "Fantasie
and Fugue in G Minor," Schmitz's
artistry became apparent. Though he
played the fugal passages with a speed
that required the utmost in dexterity,
every tone was clear and distinct. The
second group of classical compositions
by Couperin and Scarlatti the pianist
put new vitality in old forms.
Schmitz proved himself a Chopin
player of delicacy and understanding
on the third group. All the romance
and enchantment of the works were
brought out, without any of the cloy
ing sentimentality that sometimes
spoils these compositions. Schmitz
played always with feeling but never
let his emotion run riot without the
check of his intelligence and mental
understanding.
Audience Pleasel
Debussy's works as he played them
seemed easier to follow and less mys
tifying than usual. This was probably
because Schmitz always, in whatever
he played, brought out the melodic
line clearly and distinctly. The num
ber "Dance" by -Debussy showed
Schmitz to be a master of the most
complicated rhythms and tempos.
