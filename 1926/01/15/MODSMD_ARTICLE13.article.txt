# ROUGHS ADVISED TO JOIN IN SEAT RUSH FOR "NOVELTIES"
## 
### 
Roughs' seats for the Glee Club
"Novelties," to be presented to
night, will go on sale at 7:15 at
the box office at the Assembly
hall. Some good balcony seats
will be sold at the special roughs'
price of 50 cents.
The management has promised
that the "Novelties" cast, which
includes the best women enter
tainers of the campus and 60
men, will score a knockout. It
therefore advises roughs to come
early and join the rush.
