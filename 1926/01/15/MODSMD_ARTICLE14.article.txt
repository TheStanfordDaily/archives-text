# HUNT'S FRESHMEN PRACTICE DEFENSE FOR SAN JOSEANS
## Garden City Squad Expected To Give Babes Workout In Saturday Tilt 
### 
With practice yesterday and this
afternoon 011 defensive tactics, Coach
Husky Hunt has been preparing his
freshman basketballers for their game
tomorrow night with the San Jose
High School team. In the game with
Richmond High Wednesday night the
frosh defense was exceptionally weak.
Richmond, greatly outweighed by the
freshmen, was given shot after shot at
the basket, and only its failure to
make these count for scores saved the
frosh team from defeat.
McCandless at center looks to be
the only man 011 the squad sure of
his position. Sexson and Sibbetts have
shown the best form at the forward
positions, but neither are as heavy as
Hunt desires. Wilton, another aspirant
for the forward job, has shown good
form in spurts and will probably be in
the game tomorrow night. Crary, who
looked like a star in the interclass
series, has shown none of his form
since joining the yearling squad.
The guard positions, with which
Hunt has been having his troubles, are
still to be filled. Lewis and Marks,
who have been doing most of the work
at these posts, are good passers, but
are weak at stopping the opponents'
attack. Worden, another guard, is
about on a par with Lewis and Marks.
Any of these three are liable to start
against San Jose.
San Jose has always had good bas
ketball teams and should give the
frosh their hardest game so far this
season. The game will start at 7 p.m.
