# WEIGHT TEAM WILL MEET SAN MATEO FIVE HERE TONIGHT
## 
### 
With the hope of keeping up the
record of fine showings made so far
this season, the 145-pound basketball
team will meet the San Mateo Junior
College five in the basketball pavilion
here at 7 o'clock tonight. This is the
only game scheduled for this evening,
as plans for a game for the 130's have
not materialized.
The decisive victory of the 145's
over the Campbell Athletic Club five
last Friday, coupled with their fine
showing against the strong San Jose
Alumni Club team, have shown that
Coach Hal Davis has a much-improved
lineup this year.
The 45's showed better in their last
game than they did in any early sea
son tilt a year ago, and their playing
was at least on a par with that they
showed in the California games last
year.
Coach Davis will probably start the
lineup which has been so successful in
previous games, including George and
Blazier, forwards; Saunders, center;
and Newcomb and Ankele, guards.
H. Moore, C. Moore, Ring, Cairns, and
Harlow will also probably get into the
game.
