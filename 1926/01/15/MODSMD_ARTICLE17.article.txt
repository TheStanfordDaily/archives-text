# DANCERS, SINGERS IN READINESS FOR "NOVELTIES" SHOW
## Twelve Vaudeville Acts Will Be Followed by Dance In Clubhouse 
### Herb Klein 
All hands are on deck for the Novel
ties vaudeville to be given in the As
sembly hall tonight and are primed to
set a record as they "hit the heights
of hilarity" that will stand for some
time on the campus. Dancing, Binging,
acting, fooling, and kidding are all in
cluded in a well-balanced twelve-act
program. Delmer Daves, stage mana
ger of the production, has arranged a
new and original list of acts, and se
cured the finest talent available on
the campus for them. That he has
been successful can bo proven by a
glance at the list of popular stars who
will appear this evening.
A Hawaiian setting has been ar
ranged by Les Kiler for Velma Ran
dall's act. Hawaiian music will bo
furnished by Moreno, Fay, and Foote.
Miss Randall has been uniformly suc
cessful in her dramatic roles ever
since her first appearance in "Dulcy."
Campus Talent Stars
A novelty in the form of a series of
popular song presentations by Aileen
Eurks and Marjorie Allen is rated as
a sure hit. The mere presence of these
two on the stage insures success but
the selection of new popular songs
which they are to sing is equally at
tractive.
"I Think I Smell Smoke" will not bo
a test to see hom quickly the Assem
bly hall can be emptied but a bur
lesque with orchestra, vocal chorus,
soloists, and all of the florid style of
grand opera writing as found in
"Faust" and other French and Italian
favorites. A notable list of campus
singers will take the leading roles.
Delmer Daves, as the janitor, will lead
in assuring the audience of the con
flagration. The accompaniment will be
played by the new Stanford orchestra
under the direction of Helen Engel
Atkinson which will be heard on the
campus for the first time. Mrs. Atkin
son, who is a member of the first violin
section of the San Francisco Sym
phony Orchestra, has led and re
hearsed the new orchestra, composed
of Stanford students, since its forma
tion last quarter.
Boone, King to Dance
The new Glee Club seven-piece or
chestra will play their latest selections
and also accompany Hal Boone and
Van King in their snappy dancing act.
The Glee Club orchestra will play for
the one o'clock dance in the Women's
Clubhouse which will follow the show.
Dorothy Dahler has a new comedy
song for her own act. Miss Daliler's
interpretations have become an insti
tution in all campus entertainments.
Delmer Daves, as the finishing touch
to the ensemble of mirth, wrote a com
edy skit in which both he and Dorothy
Dahler appear along with other fun
makers. The thing represents a lodgo
meeting in a backwoods hick town.
The lodge also has a sister organiza
tion, or in other words, a ladies' auxil
iary.
The Glee Club quartette will bo
heard in several numbers which have
been prepared especially for this show.
It will also offer several ensemble
numbers from its new repertoire.

in assuring the audience of the con
flagration. The accompaniment will be
played by the new Stanford orchestra
under the direction of Helen Engel
Atkinson which will be heard on the
campus for the first time. Mrs. Atkin
son, who is a member of the first violin
section of the San Francisco Sym
phony Orchestra, has led and re
hearsed the new orchestra, composed

tion last quarter.
Boone, King to Dance
The new Glee Club seven-piece or
chestra will play their latest selections
and also accompany Hal Boone and
Van King in their snappy dancing act.
The Glee Club orchestra will play for
the one o'clock dance in the Women's
Clubhouse which will follow the show.
Dorothy Dahler has a new comedy
song for her own act. Miss Daliler's
interpretations have become an insti
tution in all campus entertainments.
Delmer Daves, as the finishing touch
to the ensemble of mirth, wrote a com
edy skit in which both he and Dorothy
Dahler appear along with other fun
makers. The thing represents a lodgo
meeting in a backwoods hick town.
The lodge also has a sister organiza
tion, or in other words, a ladies' auxil
iary.
The Glee Club quartette will bo
heard in several numbers which have
been prepared especially for this show.

All hands are on deck for the Novel
ties vaudeville to be given in the As
sembly hall tonight and are primed to
set a record as they "hit the heights
of hilarity" that will stand for some
time on the campus. Dancing, Binging,
acting, fooling, and kidding are all in
cluded in a well-balanced twelve-act
program. Delmer Daves, stage mana
ger of the production, has arranged a
new and original list of acts, and se
cured the finest talent available on
the campus for them. That he has
been successful can bo proven by a
glance at the list of popular stars who
will appear this evening.
A Hawaiian setting has been ar
ranged by Les Kiler for Velma Ran
dall's act. Hawaiian music will bo
furnished by Moreno, Fay, and Foote.
Miss Randall has been uniformly suc
cessful in her dramatic roles ever
since her first appearance in "Dulcy."
Campus Talent Stars
A novelty in the form of a series of
popular song presentations by Aileen
Eurks and Marjorie Allen is rated as
a sure hit. The mere presence of these
two on the stage insures success but
the selection of new popular songs
which they are to sing is equally at
tractive.
"I Think I Smell Smoke" will not bo
a test to see hom quickly the Assem
bly hall can be emptied but a bur
lesque with orchestra, vocal chorus,
soloists, and all of the florid style of
grand opera writing as found in
"Faust" and other French and Italian
favorites. A notable list of campus
singers will take the leading roles.
Delmer Daves, as the janitor, will lead
in assuring the audience of the con
flagration. The accompaniment will be
