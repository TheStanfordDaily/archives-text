# "Thou Shalt Not Drink"
## 
### 
A new law, "Thou shalt not drink," which is kept no more faithfully
than most of the ten comandments, has recently come into existence,
Robert D. Weston, Harvard '86 and a prominent meml>er of the Boston
Bar Association, says in a recent article written for and published in The
Yale News. Weston attacks with great force the whole theory and practice
of prohibition and advocates instead fearless disregard of its laws.
According to Weston, there can be no morality and no moral progress
either for the individual or for the race unless all men are free and arc
held responsible for the use they make of their freedom. Hence, every
good citizen must decide for himself whether or not he should obey the
prohibition laws, purely upon a basis of moral freedom. But, to quote
W eston:
"If everybody obeys the prohibition law, then the dreary puritanical
paradise of the Prohibitionists will be established. If everyone disobeys
the law, then Prohibition will be killed. The eighteenth amendment will be
repealed in as short a time as the machinery for amending the constitution
permits. The more the law is obeyed, the farther our goal recedes. The
more the law is disobeyed, the nearer to it we get.
"Jt is utterly hopeless to seek a cure in persuading any considerable
part of those opposed to prohibition that as good citizens they ought nol
to drink. Only in the repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment is a cure tc
be found. The powers of the government must be wrested from the hands
of the mischievous busybodies bent on regulating the private lives of other
people. Prohibition has failed. It would be foolish now to take it
seriously."
Admitting, for the sake of argument, that to a good citizen keeping the
Eighteenth Amendment as it now stands is incompatible with moral free
dom, we feel that Weston is advocating a preposterous method of attaining
what is undoubtedly a worthwhile goal. He would have everyone drink
merely to break the law—which has never been the spirit of American
freedom. The Volstead act could be amended so that the average light
drinker would be satisfied, and still have the open saloon abolished.
Weston would evidently glory in having the entire Eighteenth Amendment
ousted and in returning to the days of knock-out drops and corner saloon
brawls.
The Yale News, however, hails Weston for his frankness. It feels that
prohibition was put over in an ill-concealed haste in a period of war time
need amid a deafening ballyhoo of reformers and hypocrites and is now
being supported only by hypocrites, busybodies, and fools. It wants "wise
and good men" to step to the fore and solve the problem, under which at
present " a large portion of the American people, amounting in many
'sovereign states' to a majority, are groaning under a statute they detest."
In discussing the matter the News speaks as follows:
"Amid the dismal fog of speeches and articles by hypocritical and
bigoted men it is a relief to find springing up a fresh breeze of honest and
fearless opinion. Too long have Americans been subjected to the propa
ganda of dear old ladies and of the Anti-Saloon league—propaganda which
serves to conceal rather than uncover the truth.
"Weston is quite right in drawing a distinction between laws that pro
tect people or property from injury and laws which infringe upon personal
liberty. The old and foolish 'law and order' argument has stood unassailed
long enough and people have too frequently failed to realize that when they
drank, they undermined not all law, but only the prohibition law. As Wes
ton points out, the quickest way to get rid of this killjoy statute and monu
ment of intolerance is not to obey the law but to disobey it and thus force
its repeal."
It is remarkable that a paper as sound and conservative as The Yale
News can advocate such a procedure. Perhaps there is a way out —but
certainly it is not the way of wanton breaking of laws.

are found only in Egypt and Arabia."

brawls.
The Yale News, however, hails Weston for his frankness. It feels that
prohibition was put over in an ill-concealed haste in a period of war time
need amid a deafening ballyhoo of reformers and hypocrites and is now
being supported only by hypocrites, busybodies, and fools. It wants "wise
and good men" to step to the fore and solve the problem, under which at
present " a large portion of the American people, amounting in many
'sovereign states' to a majority, are groaning under a statute they detest."
In discussing the matter the News speaks as follows:
"Amid the dismal fog of speeches and articles by hypocritical and
bigoted men it is a relief to find springing up a fresh breeze of honest and
fearless opinion. Too long have Americans been subjected to the propa
ganda of dear old ladies and of the Anti-Saloon league—propaganda which
serves to conceal rather than uncover the truth.
"Weston is quite right in drawing a distinction between laws that pro
tect people or property from injury and laws which infringe upon personal
liberty. The old and foolish 'law and order' argument has stood unassailed
long enough and people have too frequently failed to realize that when they
drank, they undermined not all law, but only the prohibition law. As Wes
ton points out, the quickest way to get rid of this killjoy statute and monu
ment of intolerance is not to obey the law but to disobey it and thus force
its repeal."
It is remarkable that a paper as sound and conservative as The Yale
News can advocate such a procedure. Perhaps there is a way out —but
certainly it is not the way of wanton breaking of laws.

A new law, "Thou shalt not drink," which is kept no more faithfully
than most of the ten comandments, has recently come into existence,
Robert D. Weston, Harvard '86 and a prominent meml>er of the Boston
Bar Association, says in a recent article written for and published in The
Yale News. Weston attacks with great force the whole theory and practice
of prohibition and advocates instead fearless disregard of its laws.
According to Weston, there can be no morality and no moral progress
either for the individual or for the race unless all men are free and arc
held responsible for the use they make of their freedom. Hence, every
good citizen must decide for himself whether or not he should obey the
prohibition laws, purely upon a basis of moral freedom. But, to quote
W eston:
"If everybody obeys the prohibition law, then the dreary puritanical
paradise of the Prohibitionists will be established. If everyone disobeys
the law, then Prohibition will be killed. The eighteenth amendment will be
repealed in as short a time as the machinery for amending the constitution
permits. The more the law is obeyed, the farther our goal recedes. The
more the law is disobeyed, the nearer to it we get.
"Jt is utterly hopeless to seek a cure in persuading any considerable
part of those opposed to prohibition that as good citizens they ought nol
to drink. Only in the repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment is a cure tc
be found. The powers of the government must be wrested from the hands
of the mischievous busybodies bent on regulating the private lives of other
people. Prohibition has failed. It would be foolish now to take it
seriously."
Admitting, for the sake of argument, that to a good citizen keeping the
Eighteenth Amendment as it now stands is incompatible with moral free
dom, we feel that Weston is advocating a preposterous method of attaining
what is undoubtedly a worthwhile goal. He would have everyone drink
merely to break the law—which has never been the spirit of American
freedom. The Volstead act could be amended so that the average light
drinker would be satisfied, and still have the open saloon abolished.
Weston would evidently glory in having the entire Eighteenth Amendment
ousted and in returning to the days of knock-out drops and corner saloon
brawls.
