# PHI KAPS DEFEAT ENCINA 4W TEAM IN FEATURE GAME
## 
### 
Phi Kappa Sigma defeated Encina
4W in the feature game of the fourth
day of competition in the annual intra
mural basketball series played yester
day in Encina gymnasium. The score
■was tied at 8 to 8 until a few minutes
before the end of the game when the
Phi Kaps scored two baskets in rapid
succession, making the final count 12
to 8. Other results yesterday were:
El Campo beat Phi Sigma Kappa, 20
to 9; Independents won from Alpha
Tau Omega, 11 to 4; El Toro defeated
Delta Upsilon, 23 to 11; and Beta
Theta Pi swamped the Chinese Club,
25 to 4.
The Phi Kap-Encina game was bit
terly contested throughout, and the
result was in doubt until the final
minutes of play. Dinsmore started the
scoring with a basket from the middle
of the floor. Rae made it 4 to 0 for
the Phi Kaps with a pretty shot from
the sidelines. Doyle counted for En
cina with his first basket and then
evened the score with another goal.
Dinsmore found the hoop again, and
Hinkle gave the Phi Kaps a four-point
lead with a shot from under the goal
as the half ended.
Score Tied
Garner started things for Encina in
the second half by ringing in a long
shot from center. Neither team scored
from this point for about five minutes,
although both made ineffective tries at
(he basket. Doyle sank his third bas
ket on a follow-up shot —which tied
the score at 8-all. With only two min
utes left to play, Dinsmore made a
set-up shot, and Rao cinched the con
test with a goal from the middle.
Dinsmoro played a good game for
the Phi Kaps at center. He tied Doyle,
of Encina, for high point honors with
six points. Rae, Phi Kap forward,
played a clever floor game and was the
leader of the Phi Kap offense.
El Campo had a decided advantage
over Phi Sigma Kappa, and had little
difficulty trouncing the fraternity
team, 20 to 9. The club players showed
an effectivo offense that worked the
ball down the floor on numerous occa
sions. Many of their score* were made
on set-up shots under the basket as a
result of clever passing.
Even Game
The game was fairly even in the
first half, and the lead see-sawed back
and forth without either team being
able to gain the advantage. Baskets
by Beardsley and Hancock were offset
by goals by Evans and Hawkins, and
the score at half time was tied at
8-all.
Bigelow, El Campo forward, ran
wild in the second period, and is cred
ited with eight points. The Phi Sigs
lost the range of the basket, and were
only able to make one point. The game
finally ended 20 to 9. Bryant played a
good game at forward for the Phi
Sigs. Hill's guarding for the club team
was highly effective, and it was his
clever work under the basket that held
the Phi Sigs' score down.
The Alpha Tau Omega team dis
played a lack of practice in the game
with the Independents, and as a con
sequence was unable to work together
smoothly. The Independents played a
clever game in the first half and suc
ceeded in running up an 8 to 0 score
against the A.T.O.'s at the end of the
first period.
Teams Slump
Both teams slumped considerably
in the last half, and the game became
extremely ragged. The fraternity team
showed occasional bursts of passing
ability, but were unable to hit the
basket. Farwell and Pegram counted
for the A.T.O.'s only scores near the
end of the contest. Wilson starred for
the Independents at forward, and Har
low played a good game at center.
El Toro sprang a surprise by de
feating Delta Upsilon 23-11 in a rather
carelessly played game. Neither team
showed any great defensive power,
and many of the scores were made on
easy shots under the goal. Fowler was
by far the best player on the court,
his accurate shooting being responsi
ble for ten of El Toro's points.
With the score standing at 8 to 5
at the end of the half, El Toro found
the range of the basket and scored
almost at will. The D.U.'s made a de
termined effort to stop the Clubmen's
offense, but were bewildered by their
opponents' passing. Hill was the best
player on the D.U. quintet, making
three field goals and two free throws.

The Betas proved too tall and heavy
for the Chinese Club, and had little
difficulty running up a 25 to 4 score.
Led by Manoccir, Beta center, the
winners played rings around their
lighter opponents, and scored many
easy shots under the basket by simply
holding the ball over the short Chi
nese.
The score at half time was 10 to 4
for the Betas, and from then on the
Chinese players were held scoreless.
Manoccir was high point man, count
ing for fifteen of his team's total.
Montgomery and Tibbe formed an ef
fective pair of guards for the Betas.
Asieh, at forward, was high for the
Chinese with three points.
