Phi Kappa Sigma defeated Encina
4W in the feature game of the fourth
day of competition in the annual intra
mural basketball series played yester
day in Encina gymnasium. The score

El Campo beat Phi Sigma Kappa, 20

Delta Upsilon, 23 to 11; and Beta
Theta Pi swamped the Chinese Club,
25 to 4.

lead with a shot from under the goal
as the half ended.
