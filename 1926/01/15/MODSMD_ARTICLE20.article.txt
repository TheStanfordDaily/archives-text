## Review of 1925â€”Golf 
### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
The golfers had a wonderful time in the year of Bobby
Jones, 1925. This stocky young man of 23 came within a
stroke of winning both the amateur and the open cham
pionships, and his feat of capturing the amateur title for
the second year in succession, and tying for first in the
open, and only losing on the second playoff, proves more
conclusively than ever that he is one of the greatest golfers
of all time.
To take up the three big tournaments chronologically,
Willie MacFarlane, of the Oak Ridge Country Club, won
the United States open championship in the hottest of heat
waves at Worcester, Mass., on the fifth of June, when he
beat Bobby Jones 72 to 73 after a second 18-hole play-off.
They had tied for first in the tournament with 291 strokes
each, and tied again in the first 18 extra holes with 75 each.
Johnny Farrell and Francis Ouimet tied for third place with

293, while two former champions, Hagen and Sarazen, tied for fourth. It was
a harrowing finish!
Jim Barnes, after a six-year quest, won the British open championship at
Prestwick on June 26. Mac Smith, also of the U.S.A., had victory in his grasp,
but took an S3 on his final round and finished fourth. Compston and Ray tied
for second.
Bobby Jones, of Atlarta, won his greatest victory in the most sensational
amfteur championship ever held, when he finished 32 up on his four opponents
c.t Oakmrnt on Sept. sth. Only sixteen qualified for this tournament, and
players likc Ouimet, Evans, Marston, Gardned, Knepper, and Corkran couldn't
get in. sensation of the party was 19-year-old Watts Gunn, also of Atlanta,
whom Bobby Jones took along to gain experience. All Gunn did was to beat
Jesse Sweetser, among others, to win fifteen successive holes, and to iose only
to Bobby Jones in the final round. He got some experience!
Joyce Wethered, greatest woman golfer in the world, beat Glenna Collett
and Cecil Leitch to win the British women's championship. Other titleholders
of the year are: British amateur, Robert Harris; Canadian open, Leo Diegel;
Canadian amateur, Don Carrick; Canadian women's, Ada McKenzie; United
States professional, Walter Hagen; United States women's Glenna Collett;
United States intercollegiate, Fred Lamprecht, of Tulane University; Western
amateur. Keefe Carter; Western open, Mac Smith; and Western women's
Mrs. E. L. Reinhart. And Jim Barnes beat Willie MacFarlane for the so-called
world's championship.
