## CYRUS BUZLOW DISGORGES ON EVILOOSHUN 
### Monroe Eaton 
The subjeckt of evilooshun as it is j
illustraited to me by mie perfessers is
indede a verie disintergraiting 1. But
wat makes me sorta tutchy on the hole
buzines is the fackt that I hev never
seen a munkie trandficksed into a man
or tuther waie bowt.
Acors I here, tel kwiet. offtun abowt j
it. Fur instense onlie todaie I herd a
cupla giez tellin abowt how a jent
makes a bet he can kiss a gurl the Ist;
time he takes her owt and the uther j
giez having to folloe him aroun to '
wach and make shure. Well I dont
knoe weather he suckseeded or not J
but eniwaise thay sed she maid a ]
munkie owta him. But I aint got no \
fatlie in these therys of evilooshun '
espechullie such as the later.
I hev also herd tell about these
munkie glands which graftin dokters j
splice into peeple but wat thay hev j
got to do with the idear of evilooshun
I dont noe. Sum saie thet peeple are i
maid yung by heving a munkies ad-!
noyds hookt onto em but lie be durned i
if I wud let eny dokter try eny munkie !
bizness with me.
Eniewaie ther maie be sumthin init I
arfterall. Perhaps if W. J. Bryan had
treated himself to a pair of munkie
glands he mite a lived longer.
The teachin of evilooshun rekwires !
a grate rele of tackt and percushun.
