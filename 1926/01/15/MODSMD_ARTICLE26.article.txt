# MAKING OF COPPER WIRE ILLUSTRATED BY MOVING PICTURES
## 
### 
The production and possibilities of
copper and brass were demonstrated
in the moving picture, "Copper from
Mine to Consumer," shown in the Lit
tle Theatre last evening by the Ameri
can Brass Company under the auspices
of the Stanford Branch of the Ameri
can Institute of Electrical Engineers.
In a brief talk preceding the pic
ture F. L. Marat gave a few interest
ing facts regarding the importance of
copper in its alloys. "Take copper out
of its alloys and you are back in the
Stone Age," he said. Following the
showing of the picture J. G. Piersol
outlined the many possible uses of
brass and also answered questions.
The mining and smelting of copper
ore were shown in the first part of
the picture. Animated drawings and
scenes taken underground in the mine
and in the smelter of the Anaconda
Copper Company illustrated the pro
cess. The smokestack of the Anaconda
smelter is the tallest in the world. It
is 585 feet high and 100 feet in circum
ference at the base.
The other parts of the picture
showed the refining of copper, the
making of brass, and the rolling and
drawing of these metals into all the
forms in which they are used indus
trially. The smallest sizes of copper
wire must be drawn through diamond
dies; in this way a mile of copper
wire weighing only an ounce may be
made.
In his talk Marat stated that it costs
the government four and a half cents
to make each one-cent piece and
eleven and a half cents for each dime.
In emphasizing the superiority of
brass to iron for many uses, Piersol
gave statistics showing that the loss
from rust in the United States during
the past year amounted to $575,000,000,
or three times the loss from fire. The
methods of testing and analyzing
brass, and the applications of the vari
ous alloys, were discussed.
