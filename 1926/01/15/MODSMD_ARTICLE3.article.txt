# ACCUSE STANFORD STUDENTS OF DRUNKENNESS PROHIBITION HAS NOT AFFECTED INTOXICATION "CANNOT LIE" SAY G. WASHINGTON SAVANTS

Blue law fanatics will raise their
hands in horror at the thought of be
ing drunk —but that is what they are
when they sleep, according to the
findings of an experiment carried on
at George Washington University for
the effects of insomnia. "What does
the drunkard do when he becomes in
toxicated? Sleeps! And, as a rule,
wakes up de-toxified." This, according
to the reports of the experiment, is
just what happens when anyone goes
to sleep.
Sleep has puzzled mankind ever
since the dawn of existence, and after
all the theories of the "Why?" of sleep
have been boiled down, humanity is
only more piqued and mystified. In
order to find some new facts that
might prove of interest to science, the
George Washington University Psy
chology department and the Medical

department worked together on this
experiment by which they kept eight
students awake for sixty hours and
recorded at various intervals the
changes made by the period of in
somnia.
Varied Group Selected
In making the test a greatly varied
group was picked; four were men and
four were women; some of them slept
six hours or less a night by habit, and
others slept as high as ten; the ages
of the subjects ranged from seventeen
to thirty-three; in general they were
normal in health. However, two show
ed high basal metabolism rates and
one had been definitely recognized as
exhibiting some evidences of hyper
thyroidism. Of the group, then, it can
be said that they were not highly se
lected in order to prove certain theo
ries; rather, they wse merely ordi-
nary and could be considered as
representative of the majority of peo
ple.
Several interesting discoveries were
made in the blood and urine tests,
which showed a similarity in blood
and urine content of the subjects to
that of a man intoxicated with some
sort of alcoholic beverage; that is,
after the subjects had undergone the
period of insomnia. This is the fact
that has led to the statement that we
become intoxicated during our waking
hours and that sleep detoxifies, and
thus refreshes, us.
Tests Given
It was found that going without
sleep did not seem to affect the men
tal alertness of the subjects to any
great extent, in fact they did just as
well on the mental tests at the end
of the sixty hours as they had at the
start. However, this might have been
caused by the growing familiarity of
the students with the type of tests
given.
The visual -and auditory apparatus
was not quite so sensitive toward the
end of the experiment as at the begin
ning. This was particularly true of the j
visual apparatus.
Insomnia Effective
A person's ability to drive an auto
mobile is decreased very markedly
after a long period of insomnia, accord-!
ing to the tests given. At the end of
forty-five hours of sleeplessness they
had a hard time handling the car for
any period at all, but at the end of
sixty hours they were improved. No j
explanation could be offered for this !
phenomena. Operations requiring a;
short span of attention were handled j
just as well during the sleepless j
period as ordinarily, but driving for
any length of time on deserted coun- j
try roads was very dangerous, as the j
monotony of the motor tended to lull
the driver to sleep.
Coffee Used
Coffee seemed to have no material
effect as a stimulant to wakefulness.
It was used throughout the test by
four of the eight subjects, but they
appeared to fare no better than the
others in keeping awake. However, it
did seem to help two of the subjects
who stayed up a night and a day
longer, though it is not certain. The
types of activities most conducive to
staying awake were found to be those
involvinng much bodily movement,
such as swimming, dancing, running
games, and the like.
It was found that from eight to ten
hours of sleep is sufficient to restore
a person to normal after having gone
without sleep for sixty hours or more.

appeared to fare no better than the
others in keeping awake. However, it
did seem to help two of the subjects
who stayed up a night and a day
longer, though it is not certain. The
types of activities most conducive to
staying awake were found to be those
involvinng much bodily movement,
such as swimming, dancing, running
games, and the like.
It was found that from eight to ten
hours of sleep is sufficient to restore
a person to normal after having gone
without sleep for sixty hours or more.

Sleep has puzzled mankind ever
since the dawn of existence, and after

have been boiled down, humanity is
only more piqued and mystified. In
order to find some new facts that
might prove of interest to science, the
George Washington University Psy
chology department and the Medical

department worked together on this
experiment by which they kept eight
students awake for sixty hours and
recorded at various intervals the
changes made by the period of in
somnia.
Varied Group Selected
In making the test a greatly varied
group was picked; four were men and
four were women; some of them slept
six hours or less a night by habit, and
others slept as high as ten; the ages
of the subjects ranged from seventeen
to thirty-three; in general they were
normal in health. However, two show
ed high basal metabolism rates and
one had been definitely recognized as
exhibiting some evidences of hyper
thyroidism. Of the group, then, it can
be said that they were not highly se
lected in order to prove certain theo
ries; rather, they wse merely ordi-
nary and could be considered as
representative of the majority of peo
ple.
Several interesting discoveries were
made in the blood and urine tests,
which showed a similarity in blood
and urine content of the subjects to
that of a man intoxicated with some
sort of alcoholic beverage; that is,
after the subjects had undergone the
period of insomnia. This is the fact
that has led to the statement that we
become intoxicated during our waking
hours and that sleep detoxifies, and
thus refreshes, us.
Tests Given
It was found that going without
sleep did not seem to affect the men
tal alertness of the subjects to any
great extent, in fact they did just as
well on the mental tests at the end
of the sixty hours as they had at the
start. However, this might have been
caused by the growing familiarity of
the students with the type of tests
given.
The visual -and auditory apparatus
was not quite so sensitive toward the
end of the experiment as at the begin
ning. This was particularly true of the j
visual apparatus.
Insomnia Effective
A person's ability to drive an auto
mobile is decreased very markedly
after a long period of insomnia, accord-!
ing to the tests given. At the end of
forty-five hours of sleeplessness they
had a hard time handling the car for
any period at all, but at the end of
sixty hours they were improved. No j
explanation could be offered for this !
phenomena. Operations requiring a;
short span of attention were handled j
just as well during the sleepless j
period as ordinarily, but driving for
any length of time on deserted coun- j
try roads was very dangerous, as the j
monotony of the motor tended to lull
the driver to sleep.
Coffee Used
Coffee seemed to have no material
effect as a stimulant to wakefulness.
It was used throughout the test by
four of the eight subjects, but they
appeared to fare no better than the
others in keeping awake. However, it
did seem to help two of the subjects
who stayed up a night and a day
