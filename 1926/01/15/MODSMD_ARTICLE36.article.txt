OREGON AGRICULTURAL COL
LEGE, Jan. 14. â€”A site for a new $150,-
000 basketball pavilion lias been cho
sen by the Oregon Agricultural Col
lege. Due to the smallness of the pres
ent pavilion, not even all of the stu
dents of the college are able to attend
basketball games, so the new project
is being made large enough to handle
over 6000 people.
