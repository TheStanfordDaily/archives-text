# UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA BARS AUTOMOBILES ENTERPRISING STUDENT PURCHASES AIRPLANE RETURN OF HORSE AND BUGGY INEVITABLE

UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA, Jan.
13.- —University of Oklahoma students
are faced with the problem of flnding a
means of locomotion in which to do
their joy-riding, for the university au
thorities have banished automobiles
from the campus and decreed that the
wheels shall turn no more.
One enterprising student brought
an airplane to school and promptly
captivated all of the campus queens,
but he was soon brought up before
the authorities and the airplane was
made to wend its weary way home
ward among the plaudits of the under
graduates.
The Oklahomans now have under
discussion the advisability of adapting
the Baylor University method of evad
ing the no-auto edict. Baylor is at
Waco, Texas, and when the local fac

ulty ruled that "There shall be 110
nocturnal automobile joy-riding,"
gloom was cast upon the campus. But
one night a creative genius brought an
old-time means of locomotion known
as the "horseand-buggy" around to
his "girl-friend's" door, and from then
or these horse-drawn vehicles have
formed the major part of the night
traffic around Waco. It is claimed that
the new system has advantages, for
there is no danger of flat tires (speak
ing of buggies, not dates), and the
responsibility of driving is reduced to
a minimum, so the Rudolphs can de
vote all of their time to their lady
friends without- parking.
Oklahoma students have broached
the subject to the faculty, but the
professors' merely joked and would
proffer no opinion on the proposition.
