# AWARDS COMMITTEE PRESENTS OUTLINE OF NEW PROPOSAL
## Report Urges Maintenance of Present Five Major Sports 
### 
With a general report ready to be
submitted to the Executive Committee
for revision and approval, the Awards
Committee last night was formally
dismissed after a meeting at which the
outlines of the new plan of awards had
been decided upon.
The outstanding features of the new
proposal are the maintenance of the
five major sports of football, track,
basketball, baseball, and tennis as at
present; the addition of polo to the
list of first-class minor sports; and the
removal of cross-country and weight
basketball from the second-class minor
sports group.
The sports will be divided into three
classes, major, first-class minor, and
second-class minor, as at present. The
list of first-class minor sports will in
clude swimming (and water polo), soc
cer, boxing, and polo. The second-class
minor sports will be fencing, golf,
gym, and wrestling, according to the
new plan.
Awards to be given for major and
first-class minor sports will remain as
at present, that is, a Block S and
sweater to award winners in major
sports, and a Circle S and jersey to
first-class minor sports men.
The award for the second-class
minor sports, however, will be changed
from the present Circle Snake S. The
new plan provides for a four-inch Ger
man S, without a circle, to replace
the old award. No jersey or sweater
will be given with this award, accord
ing to the proposal, and it can be worn
only on a jersey.
The matter of requirements for the
winning of' awards is not yet definitely
settled, but will be taken up by the
Executive Committee when it consid
ers the report of its sub-committee.
The entire plan, as then approved,
will be submitted to the Quad elec
tions February 9, and will require a
majority vote to be made a part of
the A.S.S.TJ. Constitution.
