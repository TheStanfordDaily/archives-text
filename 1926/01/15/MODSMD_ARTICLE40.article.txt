team, playing three singles and two
doubles. During the spring vacation, it
is planned to send the varsity to Los
Angeles where they will meet U.S.C.
in one of the last games before the
final match with California early in
April. Last year the Cardinals easily
defeated U.S.C., but barely won from
the Southern Branch. In the match
with California, Stanford lost one
match to four after many hard-fought
sets. The Blue and Gold varsity later
won the national intercollegiate sin
gles and doubles.
An allowance of nine tennis balls a
week will be given to the first four
men of the squad. These balls can not
be obtained from the gymnasium store
and players wishing to practice over
the week-end should secure them from
Hal Davis before that time.
