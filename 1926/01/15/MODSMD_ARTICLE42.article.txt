UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO, Jan.;
13. —Most of the prominent colleges I
throughout the country are financed
by endowments, is the discovery made j
by a recent research made at the
University of Chicago. But many other
ways are also found of financing the
higher institutions of learning.
Harvard leads all other endowed J
colleges with a grand total of $60,-
916,98C. Columbia University follows l
with 151,486,562, then Yale with $35,-
164,883, Chicago with $30,268,885, and
the University of Pennsylvania with
$12,213,000. Stanford is the largest
privately endowed institution with a
total of $28,000,000, and an additional
$10,500,000 plant.
Securing endowments does not
bother Texas. This college owns over
2,000,000 acres of land, about one-third
of which is under oil development that
nets about $50,000 in royalties each
month. Much of the land is also leased
to ranchers for grazing purposes. Un
der a bill recently passed, none of this
money can be used for the mainten
ance of the university, but must go;
into the erection of new buildings and
in making improvements of various
sorts.
