# KANSAS STUDENT REFUSES BID TO PHI BETA KAPPA
## 
### 
By refusing the honor of becoming
a member of Phi Beta Kappa a senior
student at the University of Kansas
recently took an action that is thought
to be almost without precedent in the
history of American universities. In a
public statement to the press giving
his reasons for this apparently rash
act he made clear the fact that he was
definitely opposed to the system used
by the honorary fraternity in its
choice of members.
The student stated that his refusal
was intended as a protest against a
system that holds high grades as the
goal of the undergraduate and an or
ganization that fosters this as an ideal.
His stand of opposition seems to have
been based upon a conscientious ob
jection to "apple polishing" and un
creative drudgery.
"Pleasing professors, getting good
grades, and cramming merely to pass
examinations is not obtaining an edu
cation," this senior contends. "Uni
form high grades are a false criterion
of scholarship and necessitate a waste
of energy upon the husks and forms
which are inevitable in courses taught,
not to individuals, but to classes of
thirty, fifty, a hundred, and even a
hundred and fifty.
"To obtain these high grades," ho
states, "requires a measure of docility
and useless industry that is fatal to
the independence, initiative, and spirit
of adventure that are the very life
blood, it seems to me, of the scholar
and the scientist."
The authorities at Smith College
have decreed that there shall be no
dancing of the Charleston above the
first floor of the buildings.
