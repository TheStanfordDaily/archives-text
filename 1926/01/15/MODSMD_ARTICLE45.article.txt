Roger Wolfe Kahn, son of a New
York millionaire who gave up a col
lege education to lead the Hotel Bilt
more dance orchestra, has turned out
some mighty interesting records for
the Victor.
"Down ond Out Blues," his latest,
contains many new tricks of rhythm
and melody for a many-pieced orches
tra. On the other side of this Victor
record, Art Landry plays "Swamp
Blues" with many weird effects, some
new, some old.
The Happiness Boys (Billy Jones
and Ernest Hare) have a way of mak
ing their records seem terribly short
and that is certainly true of their
latest contribution,* "That Certain
Party" and "Why Aren't Yez Eatin'
More Oranges?" The former is a sort
of "Beggar on Horseback" song call
ing for precise phrasing. The latter
advertises California Sunkist oranges
and maids.
George Olsen and His Music, who
recorded the nation's present best
seller, "Who," offers "Miami." "Here
in My Arms," on the other side of the
record, is a medley fox-trot from the
musical show, "Dearest Enemy."
Did you notice the fine compliment
Judge Jr. handed the new Victor rec
ords in the current issue of the maga
zine? Confirm the compliment for your
self by hearing some of them.
