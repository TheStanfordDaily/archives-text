# JUNIOR CLASS PLANS PROM FOR EARLIER DATE THAN USUAL
## Tickets Will Be Sold Only to 1927 Members Who Have Paid Dues 
### 
Tickets for the junior prom will be
sold only to members of the junior
class who have paid class dues of two
dollars, according to an announcement
made last night by Wilbur Adams,
president of the class of 1927. The
finance committee is making a final
canvass of all living groups this week
and next.
Another announcement stated that
tickets will be sold to members of the
class in the order that they pay the
dues."
In order to assure good arrange
ments for all details of the prom, the
committee for the event will be ap
pointed within the next two weeks.
This body will be forced to start work
at once for it is expected that the
prom will be held at an earlier date
this year.
The junior opera committee is now
working to secure a director for the
show. It is also making a plea for
additional plots. These will be accept
able at any time. Some authors have
turned in their names with the state
ment that they are working on plots.
Preliminary plans are that a stu
dent will be engaged to direct the
opera this year. Gordon Davis was
originally suggested for this position,
but he states that he will not be on
the campus at that time. Davis will
leave at the beginning of spring quar
ter for the East and return in time to
direct the senior farce.
