# RETURN OF CAPTAIN FRED TROTTER AIDS CARD POLO DEENSE
## 
### 
Captain Fred Trotter, mainstay on
defense of the Stanford polo team, is
back in his position, showing better
form than he did before his injury last
quarter. John Irwin, star man on the
offense, who registered at the Univer
sity after a period of absence from
polo ,has left again and is at present
registered at the University of Ari
zona, according to Lieutenant Charles
Whitmore, polo coach. Irwin was con
sidered one of the best men in his
position who ever rode for the Cards.
Several second squad men have been
working out with the varsity squad
and are showing fine form. Rothrock
and Triest, in particular, are expected
to give the regular players some com
petition for their positions.
Nick Kirwan, substitute quarterback
in varsity football, is a comparatively
new find. He registered for polo im
mediately after the close of the season,
and is showing up well in the second
squad. Kirwan is being playod in all
positions so as to find his place. His
riding is daring, and his shooting is
good.
The first polo squad consists of the
following men:
Captain Fred Trotter, Lyal, Vander
burgh, Kenneth Drown, Kenneth
Krohn, William Hollingsworth, George
Connolly, John Givens, Arthur Ross,
Laurence Weymouth, James Whyte,
Chauncey Thompson, and George
Ilaker.
