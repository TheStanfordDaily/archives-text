# U. S. CONSTITUTION BEST DEVISED SO FAR, SAYS JORDAN
## Eighteen Amendments Have Met Changing Conditions Of Country 
### 
"The constitution of the United
States is the best any country has yet
had," stated Dr. Jordan in his Thurs
day evening conference last night, dis
cussing the value of the two-party
system as compared with the bloc
system. "It is not surprising that we
have had 18 amendments to our con
stitution; at the time of its adoption,
conditions were entirely different from
those of today. However, one quality
which makes it different from the
constitutions of other countries, is
that there is a definite period of time
set for the President and his advisors
to hold office. It is this factor which
enables the President to formulate a
program, and carry it to its comple
tion, through a period of four years."
As a contrast to the stabilizing fea
ture characteristic of our system, Dr.
Jordan mentioned the one used in
European countries. In Germany,
France, and Italy, the party in power
goes out of office as soon as an ad
verse vote arises. As a result of this,
many small cliques or blocs are
formed, which range from the extreme
"left" group, to that classified as
"right." Examples of the various bloc
elements from "left" to "right" are:
Communistic, Socialistic, Democratic,
Central, and National Liberal Parties,
with the Nationalist-Modernist party
found at the extreme "right."
He described the party system now
used in England, which resembles, in
a general sense, the one used through
out Europe. He qualified the English,
according to their temper, and re
marked that instead of attempting to
turn everything upside down, it is
customary for them to try to "muddle
things along."
"Our two party system has been
criticized," he said, "by the fact that
one cannot tell which party is in
power, according to the appearance
of governmental action. In this way a
two-party distinction becomes practi-
cally meaningless. Nevertheless, when
the superiority of one party over the
other is meaningless, a much better
management of government results.
Instead of a revolution, there are
enough voters to swing the ballot,
when a crisis occurs."
"Two parties," he continued, "as
long as they are separated by theory
only, are all right, but when they con
tain a special interest, then it is that
we are called upon to choose between
the two."
Election Politics Told
Dr. Jordan told of an election in
Queensland, where the Liberal party
was in the majority. The leader of the
Labor party asked what concessions
they would receive if they voted with
the Liberals. When this plan was re
fused, the vote was switched to the
Conservative party, which granted the
desired concession.
A policy on this order has been
carried out repeatedly in New South
Wales, South Australia, and New Zea
land. In New Zealand, the party in
power consented to enact pension bills,
and various improvement bills, in re
turn for another party's vote.
In returning to a discussion of the
American form of government, Dr.
Jordan stated that the recall was
merely an attempt to get back to the
British system, and worked badly.
"The American Constitution," he con
cluded, "is the only factor which can
save the nation from going to pieces,
and which can prevent a sudden over
turning of the government."
