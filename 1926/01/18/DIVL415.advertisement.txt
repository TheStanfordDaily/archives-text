The "Try //"Attitude
Toward
the Bond Business
SOME college men frankly say they are
going to give the bond business a "try"
—an attitude which suggests lack of con
fidence, either in the opportunities in this
field, or in themselves.
Before merely "trying" the bond busi
ness, it would pay to look thoroughly into
its requirements and possibilities—to de
cide on facts, not on impressions or fancies.
The man who thus carefully chooses his
work in the light of his own qualifications,
gives himself the best chance to succeed.
To help you know more about the bond
business, as a basis for deciding your own
adaptability to it, we have prepared an in
formative pamphlet which we shall be glad
to send upon request.
