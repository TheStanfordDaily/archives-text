An
Open Letter
to Teachers
$
Dear Madam:
Did you ever stop to realize that your
feet can have a very definite effect on
your teaching?
When your feet are achy, when you
are "foot-conscious" and find yourself
dreading to be on your feet, you simply
can't do your best work.
Therefore, it should prove worth
while /ou to make sure you have
healthy, happy, useful feet, and you
can do this by wearing the Arch Pre
server Shoe.
This sfroe keeps feet healthy because
it provides a normal, natural support.
It keeps feet comfortable because
it prevents straining of the arch and
pinchingof the bones, blood-vessels and
nerves. It makes feet useful and active
| because it keeps them ready for any
task. With this shoe you can stand all
day long and enjoy your work.
, Yet you have smart style. The Arch
zjpc kf Preserver Shoe has "changed the ideas ;
of the Nation" because it combines foot
m fjfr. happiness with correct appearance.
*«||P» TM| F«OT Will' . , 11.
We invite you to come and let us ex
plain in detail just why this shoe is
today demanded by hundreds of thou
sands of busy women.
Very truly yours,
