# CHARCOAL DRAWINGS BY ERNEST WATSON SHOWN IN GALLERY
## 
### 
[ A collection of twenty-seven block
! prints and eleven charcoal drawings,
Iby Ernest W. Watson of Brooklyn,
I New York, are now on exhibition at
the Art Gallery.
| The block prints are made with a
j beautiful blending of colors, requiring
| as many as twenty-live impressions to
! the print. Watson has developed a
1 method which bears an interesting
! analogy to the Japanese prints.
| Japanese prints were made from
i wood blocks, to which the color (water
color mixed with rice paste) was ap
plied freely, so that the impression of
; a single block might show gradations
of color. The combination of a num
ber of such blocks in the printing of a
single picture resulted in what might
be called a full color effect, or a rela
tively unrestricted color treatment.
The principal of the Watson Method
is similar. Watson secures his grada
tions by applying the color to the
blocks with rollers so manipulated
1 that irregular or free-inking results.
These gradations may readily be seen
iin his prints, especially in the skies
! where a deep blue passes smoothly
through a sequence of color to yellow
j or orange.
The subjects on display at the Art
Gallery vary from quiet and rustic
scenes to those of the mort active and
artificial city activities. Among the
j best are: A Berkshire Sunset, Fifth
Avenue at 42nd Street, Moonlit Road,
The Noon Hour, and a James I. Oak
Chair.
