# DAVIS ANNOUNCES CASE FOR ANNUAL MASQUERS' PEAK
## "Fashion‚Äù Amusing Comedy Of New York Life Eighty Years Ago 
### 
Final announcement of the cast se- j
lections for "Fashion," which will be
given January 29 by Masquers Society,
was made this morning by Gordon
Davis, who is directing the play.
Cast selections are as follows: Adam
Turner, Cecil Doll; Count Joli Maitre,
Paul Penney; Colonel Howard, Fen
ton Barrett: Mr. Tiffany, Edward
Smith; T. Kennyson Twinkle, Felton
Kaufmann; Mr. Augustus Fogg, Syd
ney Gray; Mr. Snobson, George Mau
ser; Zeke, Herbert Boomer; Mrs. Tif
fany, Patrice Nauman; Prudence, Bar
bara Probasco; Millinette, Aileene
Burks; Seraphina, Marjorie Allen;
Gertrude, Velma Randall.
Fenton Barrett as Colonel Howard
is especially well cast for his part in
the Masquers' annual play. Barrett
took the lead in last year's Junior
Opera and has appeared in several
other campus dramatic productions.
Marjorie Allen, Aileene Burks, and
Velma Randall are all familiar figures
to Stanford theatregoers, the latter
being remembered as "Dulcy" in the
famous comedy by that name.
"Fashion," or "Life in New York,"
was written by Anna Cora Mowatt
and met with great success in its
opening during 1845. The play will be
produced by the Stanford stars in its
full nineteenth century atmosphere.
While the comedy-satire is very amus
ing in itself, the stage settings, cos
tumes, actions, and characters of
eighty years ago adds greatly to the
production from a novel and comical
standpoint. The Provincetown players
in New York revived the original play
several years ago, the Twentieth Cen
tury production meeting with marked
success.
The characters are typical of the
old-fashioned melodramatic figures of
the day, affording special amusement
by the side remarks to the audience,
remarks which are entirely out of
character.
