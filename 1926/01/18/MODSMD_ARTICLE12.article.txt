# ENTERTAINMENT IS MAIN FEATURE OF CONFERENCE PARTY
## 
### 
"And the Lamp Went Out," a play
in which every word or phrase is liter
ally interpreted by the actresses, in
this case, will be a feature of the
Woman's Conference party to be held
tonight in< the Women's Clubhouse at
7:30 o'clock.
The play will be presented by the
sophomores and promises to be very
novel in its interpretation. Its realism
j will even surpass that of the famous
i Russian writers who are known for
j their adherence to the strict truth in
j every detail. In fact the sophomores
plan to go the Russians one better and
| show what would happen if every de
! tails were interpreted literally,
j Mildred Worswick will give her first
1 official account of her recent trip East
j and of the part she took as a member
I of the Committee on Permanent Or
ganization in the National Collegiate
I World Court Conference. As this Fed-
I eration of College Students is destined
to hold an important place in college
affairs in the future, Miss Worswick's
talk will hold a great deal of interest
I for the women.
Dean Mary Yost will also speak to
I the women. The senior class has a
; surprise skit which promises to be
amusing. After the program there will
j be dancing.
