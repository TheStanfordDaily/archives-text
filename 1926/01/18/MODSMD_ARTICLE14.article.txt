# Organic Chemistry Professor Almost Turns Bootlegger
## 
### 
Alcohol flowed freely one day last
week in the eleven o'clock organic
chemistry class when Professor Frank
ling momentarily turned bootlegger
and proceeded to indulge several mem
bers of the class with the burning,
choking fluid in order to demonstrate
its properties. All the accessories of a
bootlegging establishment including a
still in full action and several bottles
of fusel oil were set up for the edifica
tion of the students.
Following the usual discussion of
the methods of making ethyl alcohol
by yeast fermentation, Dr. Franklin
showed the class bottles of the higher
alcohols or fusel oils that put the kick
and also the blindness in "white mule."
He then prepared some alcohol from a
fermented sugar solution by the well
known process of distillation.
After tasting the distilled alcohol
himself Dr. Franklin invited three of
the students to have a drink in order
to convince the class that it really
was the "genuine stuff." The fortunate
or unfortunate ones were immediately
seized with fits of coughing and chok
ing upon receiving a mouthful of the
liquid, which demonstrated, much to
the amusement of Professor Franklin
and the other students, its extra dry
properties.
Professor Franklin then poured the
rest of the liquid on the desk and
proceeded to light it, but it was neces
sary to extinguish it almost immedi
ately and wipe it off in order to avoid
seriously defacing the desk top.
