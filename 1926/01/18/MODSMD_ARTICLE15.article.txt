# STANFORD GEOLOGIST HAS RARE COLLECTION OF LAND MOLLUSCS
## 
### 
Land shells of all types lay eggs, ac
j cording to Mrs. Ida Oldroyd, one of
| Stanford's most eminent geologists.
I She has one of the finest collections
of shells and their eggs in the world
!cn exhibition in her laboratory up
| stairs in the Geology building.
The eggs in the collection resemble
â€¢ those of a bird so much that it is
| impossible for the untrained person
|to tell the difference. Mrs. Oldroyd
: procured the land shells from the
island of Trinidad. This particular
I type, known as the Bulimus land shell,
i lays its eggs in leaf molds or in simi
! lar places.
The Stanford collection contains
: specimens ranging from this very
| large egg to small eggs that are hardly
I recognizable as such. The larger the
1 egg, the harder its shell is and the
; fewer there are produced. The small
eggs are soft, round, and of close for
j mation. Among these latter are the
; round, white ones of the edible shell
| found and prized for food in Europe.
Hundreds of eggs are laid by the
1 more common varieties of shell. (The
| use of the word "shell" is expanded to
! include the organism living within the
i shell.) Those of the Pacific Coast lay
j small eggs whose coverings very
| slightly resemble shells.
The freshwater shell lays a mass or
! string of eggs, while that living in
i brackish water produces a coil. These
eggs usually adhere to aquatic plants
among which the shells live. The eggs
of saltwater, shells bear very slight
resemblance to either those of land
shells or of birds.
The eggs are at times edposited on
the shell itself, and often on other
shells. .The number of eggs laid fre
quently reaches many thousand, de
pending on their size. Those of the
j IJulimus land shell being the largest
I of the shell eggs, are the most numer
! ous, while the tiniest eggs number
millions. Each extreme and many of
those in between are represented in
the Geology department collection.
