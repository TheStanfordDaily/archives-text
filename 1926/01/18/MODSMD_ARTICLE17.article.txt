# OLYMPICS SMOTHER STANFORD IN WEIRD BASKETBALL GAME
## Cards Fail to Make Single Point in First Half; Score 34 to 11 
### Jim Adams 
Shut out complotely in the first half
with a score of 22 to 0, the Stanford
basketball team took a humiliating
drubbing Saturday night in the pa
vilion, at the hands of the Olympic
Club. The Clubmen enjoyed a delight
ful basket picnic at the expense of
the Cardinals and returned home from
the freak affair with their appetites
well satisfied by a score of 34 to 11.
The game was featured by the un
erring aim of the Club marksmen and
the inability of the excited Redshirts
to come down to earth and play bas
ketball.
The first basket for the Clubmen
came exactly in ten seconds after the
initial whistle was blown. The ball
was tipped from center to Jorgenson
who passed to Berndt underneath the
basket who dropped it in. Two more
baskets followed in close order and
the morale of the Cards was shattered.
Club Has Easy Time
Although the Olympics had no trou
ble in breaking through the defense of
Coach Kerr's men, nevertheless their
shots were aided by good luck. Out of
thirty-three attempts at the basket
during the first frame the Clubmen
scored on ten, which was almost one
out of every three. This sounds more ,
like a sharpshooter's percentage than
anything else.
On the other hand, the Cards were
hitting the basket on their shots but
they might as well have had a tub
over it for none of them would roll in.
It soon got to an uncanny stage and
when Anderson shot a free throw at
the opening of the second half, after
the ball bounced all over the ring, the
crowd cheered as if it were the win
ning point. With the jinx broken,
David started a short Stanford rally
for about nine points and then the
game settled down to a normal pace.
During this last period the Clubmen
made twelve points to the Cards'
eleven.
Stanford's Defense Poor
The Olympic Club played a man in
the hole and Kerr's men seemed un
able to work a defense for it. Jorgen
son, a former California player, would
come out from the basket to receive a
pass and then would feed the ball to a
Clubman, who always seemed open,
coming down on either side. If Ander
son followed him out it would leave
the way open for someone to sneak
around behind for a close shot. If he
played back, Jorgenson simply stepped
out a few paces and took a shot him
self. Kerr changed his running guard
twice but none of them could aid An
derson in breaking up this formation.
This is the same formation that Cali
fornia uses, and if the Cards do not
perfect something before the series
with the Bears, they will he in for a
tough time.
Berndt won high point honors with
a total of five field goals. Besides him,
Jorgenson and Hammersly were the
outstanding players on the floor. The
former California player displayed
some nice passing as well as account
ing for six points. Hammersly had the
whole Card team fooled by a shifty
dribble he used. He would pick a
course straight down the floor, head
ing directly for a Stanford player, and
then, with a clever shift of the ball,
would go completely around his op
ponent. Mcßurney, who played for
Stanford two years ago, was also re
sponsible for some close guarding.
Stanford Off Game
The whole Stanford team was off
its game. Most of the time they formed
a poor semblance of a team. Anderson
put up a fighting game at standing
guard and, although he allowed a good
! many close shots, it was not generally
his fault, but more that of the running
j guard who failed to give him aid. He
j was undoubtedly the busiest player on
the floor. David followed the ball
closely and rustled the ball more than
the rest. Kerr made many substitu
tions but every new man left the
earth as soon as he got in. Passes
were shot directly to the waiting arms
of an Olympic player and often thrown
merely to empty space.
To draw any definite conclusions
about a freak game like this would
be unwise. There was one thing about
the Cards —there never was a more
disorganized team. The result of the
test, predicted Friday, for the defens
ive powers of the team against a fast
scoring five, was that the Stanford
team went up in the air. It is at least
fortunate to have this sad fault
brought out now, before the U.S.C.
and California games.
The summary of the game was as
follows:
Stanford (11) Olympic Club (34)
David (2) F Berndt (10)
Price (C) (2) F Jorgenson (6)
Jayred (4) C Donovin (C) (2)
Mitchell G Hammersly (5)

Substitutions for Stanford: Clark,

with the Bears, they will he in for a
tough time.
Berndt won high point honors with
a total of five field goals. Besides him,
Jorgenson and Hammersly were the
outstanding players on the floor. The
former California player displayed
some nice passing as well as account
ing for six points. Hammersly had the
whole Card team fooled by a shifty
dribble he used. He would pick a
course straight down the floor, head
ing directly for a Stanford player, and
then, with a clever shift of the ball,
would go completely around his op
ponent. Mcßurney, who played for
Stanford two years ago, was also re
sponsible for some close guarding.
Stanford Off Game
The whole Stanford team was off
its game. Most of the time they formed
a poor semblance of a team. Anderson
put up a fighting game at standing
guard and, although he allowed a good
! many close shots, it was not generally
his fault, but more that of the running
j guard who failed to give him aid. He
j was undoubtedly the busiest player on
the floor. David followed the ball
closely and rustled the ball more than
the rest. Kerr made many substitu
tions but every new man left the
earth as soon as he got in. Passes
were shot directly to the waiting arms
of an Olympic player and often thrown
merely to empty space.
To draw any definite conclusions
about a freak game like this would
be unwise. There was one thing about
the Cards —there never was a more
disorganized team. The result of the
test, predicted Friday, for the defens
ive powers of the team against a fast
scoring five, was that the Stanford
team went up in the air. It is at least
fortunate to have this sad fault
brought out now, before the U.S.C.
and California games.
The summary of the game was as
follows:
Stanford (11) Olympic Club (34)
David (2) F Berndt (10)
Price (C) (2) F Jorgenson (6)
Jayred (4) C Donovin (C) (2)
Mitchell G Hammersly (5)
Anderson (3) G Mcßurney
Substitutions for Stanford: Clark,
Vincenti, Shipkey, Bryant, Crist, Rupe,
Newhouse.
Shut out complotely in the first half
with a score of 22 to 0, the Stanford
basketball team took a humiliating
drubbing Saturday night in the pa
vilion, at the hands of the Olympic
Club. The Clubmen enjoyed a delight
ful basket picnic at the expense of
the Cardinals and returned home from
the freak affair with their appetites
well satisfied by a score of 34 to 11.
The game was featured by the un
erring aim of the Club marksmen and
the inability of the excited Redshirts
to come down to earth and play bas
ketball.
The first basket for the Clubmen
came exactly in ten seconds after the
initial whistle was blown. The ball
was tipped from center to Jorgenson
who passed to Berndt underneath the
basket who dropped it in. Two more
baskets followed in close order and
the morale of the Cards was shattered.
Club Has Easy Time
Although the Olympics had no trou
ble in breaking through the defense of
Coach Kerr's men, nevertheless their
shots were aided by good luck. Out of
thirty-three attempts at the basket
during the first frame the Clubmen
scored on ten, which was almost one
out of every three. This sounds more ,
like a sharpshooter's percentage than
anything else.
On the other hand, the Cards were
hitting the basket on their shots but
they might as well have had a tub
over it for none of them would roll in.
It soon got to an uncanny stage and
when Anderson shot a free throw at
the opening of the second half, after
the ball bounced all over the ring, the
crowd cheered as if it were the win
ning point. With the jinx broken,
David started a short Stanford rally
for about nine points and then the
game settled down to a normal pace.
During this last period the Clubmen
made twelve points to the Cards'
eleven.
Stanford's Defense Poor
The Olympic Club played a man in
the hole and Kerr's men seemed un
able to work a defense for it. Jorgen
son, a former California player, would
come out from the basket to receive a
pass and then would feed the ball to a
Clubman, who always seemed open,
coming down on either side. If Ander
son followed him out it would leave
the way open for someone to sneak
around behind for a close shot. If he
played back, Jorgenson simply stepped
out a few paces and took a shot him
self. Kerr changed his running guard
twice but none of them could aid An
derson in breaking up this formation.
This is the same formation that Cali
fornia uses, and if the Cards do not
perfect something before the series
with the Bears, they will he in for a

erring aim of the Club marksmen and
the inability of the excited Redshirts
to come down to earth and play bas
ketball.
The first basket for the Clubmen
came exactly in ten seconds after the
initial whistle was blown. The ball
was tipped from center to Jorgenson
who passed to Berndt underneath the
basket who dropped it in. Two more
baskets followed in close order and
the morale of the Cards was shattered.
Club Has Easy Time
Although the Olympics had no trou
ble in breaking through the defense of
Coach Kerr's men, nevertheless their
shots were aided by good luck. Out of
thirty-three attempts at the basket
during the first frame the Clubmen
scored on ten, which was almost one
out of every three. This sounds more ,
like a sharpshooter's percentage than
anything else.
On the other hand, the Cards were
hitting the basket on their shots but
they might as well have had a tub
over it for none of them would roll in.
It soon got to an uncanny stage and
when Anderson shot a free throw at
the opening of the second half, after
the ball bounced all over the ring, the
crowd cheered as if it were the win
ning point. With the jinx broken,
David started a short Stanford rally
for about nine points and then the
game settled down to a normal pace.
During this last period the Clubmen
made twelve points to the Cards'
eleven.
Stanford's Defense Poor
The Olympic Club played a man in
the hole and Kerr's men seemed un
able to work a defense for it. Jorgen
son, a former California player, would
come out from the basket to receive a
pass and then would feed the ball to a
Clubman, who always seemed open,
coming down on either side. If Ander
son followed him out it would leave
the way open for someone to sneak
around behind for a close shot. If he
played back, Jorgenson simply stepped
out a few paces and took a shot him
self. Kerr changed his running guard
twice but none of them could aid An
derson in breaking up this formation.
This is the same formation that Cali
fornia uses, and if the Cards do not
perfect something before the series
with the Bears, they will he in for a
tough time.
Berndt won high point honors with
a total of five field goals. Besides him,
Jorgenson and Hammersly were the
outstanding players on the floor. The
former California player displayed
some nice passing as well as account
ing for six points. Hammersly had the
whole Card team fooled by a shifty
dribble he used. He would pick a
course straight down the floor, head
ing directly for a Stanford player, and
then, with a clever shift of the ball,
would go completely around his op
ponent. Mcßurney, who played for
Stanford two years ago, was also re
sponsible for some close guarding.
Stanford Off Game
The whole Stanford team was off
its game. Most of the time they formed
a poor semblance of a team. Anderson
put up a fighting game at standing
guard and, although he allowed a good
! many close shots, it was not generally
his fault, but more that of the running
j guard who failed to give him aid. He
j was undoubtedly the busiest player on
the floor. David followed the ball
closely and rustled the ball more than
the rest. Kerr made many substitu
tions but every new man left the
earth as soon as he got in. Passes
were shot directly to the waiting arms
of an Olympic player and often thrown
merely to empty space.
To draw any definite conclusions
about a freak game like this would
be unwise. There was one thing about
the Cards —there never was a more
disorganized team. The result of the
test, predicted Friday, for the defens
ive powers of the team against a fast
scoring five, was that the Stanford
team went up in the air. It is at least
fortunate to have this sad fault
brought out now, before the U.S.C.
and California games.
