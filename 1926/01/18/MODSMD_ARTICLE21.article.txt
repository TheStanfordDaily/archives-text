# Why Not a Baseball League?
## 
### 
The Pacific Coast conference guides the destiny of the larger coast
universities through very satisfactory football, basketball, and track
schedules; but it neglects entirely to provide for a baseball conference, or
even to arrange a championship series. The measure of success of the
Stanford basball squad is determined by the number of games won in the
annual series against the University of California. It has long been felt
that a baseball league, properly managed, and with a reasonable schedule
would be of untold benefit to the Stanford baseball team. Why not take
some steps for the formation of such an organization?
As it is, the Stanford players put in a hard season of preparation and
then with vyhom do they clash? Ambrose lailors, Ireland s Inde
pendents, Kenealy Seals, and so on—finally taking a trip south, during
which most anybody is played, and then ending with the California series.
How much more interest could be aroused if the eligible colleges in the
locality were gathered together and a league formed. The baseball grand
stand is always packed to overflowing for the games with the Bears—
which shows that there is interest in baseball when the opposition is of the
right sort. From this it is reasonable to believe that students would be
more zealous in their desires to attend baseball games, if a league cham
pionship stood in the offing throughout a series of games. And increased
attendance would mean increased revenue —which is certainly not offensive.
Looking to the teams available —we find California, St. Mary s, Santa
Clara, and Stanford within a few miles of each other. At Davis we have
the California Aggies, and the College of the Pacific is at Stockton. In
the south U.S.C. and Southern Branch head the list, and there are also the
smaller universities —Pomona, Occidental, Whittier, and Redlands.
Perhaps, the northern universities could band together in a group and
the southern universities in a group, play separate schedules and ai range
for the winners in each league to meet in a sort of World s Series for the
state intercollegiate baseball championship. Probably all of the universi
ties do not have strong teams at present. Baseball, however, is a sandlot
game and most American youngsters are more or less adept at it. With
proper organization every institution mentioned could develop creditable
teams to make the competition strong all around.
The idea expressed here may be somewhat impractical at present.
Granted, but at least some steps should be taken to give the Stanford base
ballers more and better competition. Not that we have anything against
the teams made up of former coast and major leagues but colk.ge compe
tition would arouse more interest and would do more good. Ihe Daily
invites contributions to the campus opinion column on this subject.

The Pacific Coast conference guides the destiny of the larger coast
universities through very satisfactory football, basketball, and track
schedules; but it neglects entirely to provide for a baseball conference, or
even to arrange a championship series. The measure of success of the
Stanford basball squad is determined by the number of games won in the
annual series against the University of California. It has long been felt
that a baseball league, properly managed, and with a reasonable schedule
would be of untold benefit to the Stanford baseball team. Why not take
some steps for the formation of such an organization?
As it is, the Stanford players put in a hard season of preparation and
then with vyhom do they clash? Ambrose lailors, Ireland s Inde
pendents, Kenealy Seals, and so on—finally taking a trip south, during
which most anybody is played, and then ending with the California series.
How much more interest could be aroused if the eligible colleges in the
locality were gathered together and a league formed. The baseball grand
stand is always packed to overflowing for the games with the Bears—
which shows that there is interest in baseball when the opposition is of the
right sort. From this it is reasonable to believe that students would be
more zealous in their desires to attend baseball games, if a league cham
pionship stood in the offing throughout a series of games. And increased
attendance would mean increased revenue —which is certainly not offensive.
Looking to the teams available —we find California, St. Mary s, Santa
Clara, and Stanford within a few miles of each other. At Davis we have
the California Aggies, and the College of the Pacific is at Stockton. In
the south U.S.C. and Southern Branch head the list, and there are also the
smaller universities —Pomona, Occidental, Whittier, and Redlands.
Perhaps, the northern universities could band together in a group and
the southern universities in a group, play separate schedules and ai range
for the winners in each league to meet in a sort of World s Series for the
state intercollegiate baseball championship. Probably all of the universi
ties do not have strong teams at present. Baseball, however, is a sandlot
game and most American youngsters are more or less adept at it. With
proper organization every institution mentioned could develop creditable
teams to make the competition strong all around.
The idea expressed here may be somewhat impractical at present.
Granted, but at least some steps should be taken to give the Stanford base
ballers more and better competition. Not that we have anything against
the teams made up of former coast and major leagues but colk.ge compe
tition would arouse more interest and would do more good. Ihe Daily
