Westerners whose knowledge of "T lie Big Swede Oberlander has been
gained through meager press reports of Dartmouth games and opinions of
All-American writers will be surprised to learn that he could scarcely
throw a forward pass l>efore the season just completed.
Oberlander played at Dartmouth in 1923 and 1924 but Dooley at quar
terback did most of the passing, according to Albon Holden, writing in
The Big Ten Weekly. When it was known that Dooley would not be back
in college in 1925, because of an injury received from a fall while horse
back riding, Oberlander decided he would learn to pass a football. So he
set to work to develop the forward pass.
For an hour a day all summer he threw passes to a fellow member of
the Dartmouth squad, with whom he spent the summer. During the fall
the Dartmouth team ran signals for an hour a day using nothing but for
ward passes. The result is football history.
Probably the average person cannot accomplish such phenomenal re
sults as Oberlander did, but, nevertheless, a lesson can be gained from his
success. And this lesson, if applied to the classroom will show a decided
change for the better in end quarter grades.

ALL MEMBERS of the Daily Palo Alto staff will be expected to
attend the staff meeting at 1:15 tomorrow afternoon in the Daily office.

Unusual seriousness over the New Year reported in the Syracuse Daily
Orange:
"Pringle Macliic, '26, president of VV.S.fi.A., resolved 'not to resolve anything,
but to do the best I can in this next year.' Ellen Lundquist, '26, speaker of Women's
Congress, resolves 'to fill the year with utmost joy by doing daily tasks to the best of
my ability and with kindness.' Alfred Stalker, chime-master, 'To ring the chimes lyud
enough and fast enough to get the students up in time for the eight o'clock classes.'"

The Daily Trojan takes a sly crack at collegiate intellect:
"No doubt if Mr. Ji«Rs ran for mayor against Mr. Einstein the former would
have a large following of college students."
