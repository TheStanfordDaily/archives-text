## Review of 1925â€”Tennis 
### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Tennis, as usual, had a good year, and more people than
ever before took part in and witnessed the game. The out
door season was featured by the "come-back" of Billy
Johnston, who not only rewon his number two ranking,
which he had lost to Vincent Richards the year before, but
who gave Bill Tilden a much harder battle than usual in
their annual finals match for the United States singles
championship.
Dick Williams and Vincent Richards won the national
doubles title, defeating Patterson and Hawkes of Australia;
while Hawkes, paired with Miss McKane of England, won
the mixed doubles championship from Miss Harvey and
Vincent Richards.
International competition was rich, rare, and spicy. Not
for years had so much interest been shown in Davis Cup
play. France, winner of the European Zone, beat Australia,

winner of the American Zone, but lost in straight matches to the United States
in the challenge round. But both Borotra and LaCoste had Tilden on the
verge of defeat.
The ladies, G. B. 'E.. provided nearly as much excitement as the men, and
certainly some tennis that was just as good. Helen Wills kept her national
title without much difficulty, beating Miss McKane of England in the finals.
She also won the doubles championship with Mary Browne, when they de
feated two other Californians. Miss Ryan and Mrs. Bundy. The English
women's team upset the dope by taking home with them the Wightman Cup,
won from the Americans 4 matches to 3.
Prance completely dominated the Wimbledon tournament, La Coste beating
Borotra for the singles championship, the two of them winning the doubles,
Suzanne Lenglen the women's singles, Suzanne and Miss Ryan the women's
doubles, and Suzanne and Borotra the mixed doubles! Borotra also won the
United States indoor title.
Elizabeth Ryan, who defeated Helen Wills at Seabright, was one of the
sensations of the year. Cranston Holman, the young Stanford player, who
lost to Ed Chandler of the University of California in the intercollegiate
tournament, and later won the junior championship and beat Tilden in an
exhibition match, was another.
