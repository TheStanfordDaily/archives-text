HOW AND WHERE TO BE ROUGH j
Being rough is an art but many
roughs don't know it.
* * *
Save the cleaner some money.
Be a real rough and wear your cords
when you take a shower.
* * *
Never shout queener at President
Wilbur when you see him with his
wife.
♦ * *
The Gorilla says he will sell his cos
tume at the end of the San Francisco
engagement with a special reduced
rate to any Stanford student who may
be able to make use of it.
Here's your chance, men! Rough a
dance in the good old fashioned way.
* * *
Here's to Shorty O'Rooney McDuff.
He fell on a cheese-grater,
And now he's a little rough.
* * *
We hear of Stanford students rough
ing dances, plays, and even lectures.
Why don't we ever hear of them
roughing class?
♦ ♦ *
Thou shalt not wear thy roommate's
unclean sweatshirt nor thy room
mate's unclean corduroys even though
he be an engineer.
* * *
Never rough a dance in a tuxedo.
♦ * *
In order to be as rough as possible
shave the back of the neck only.
* * *
Get an original odor.
Try neat's-foot oil on your corduroys.
It makes them waterproof and dirt
proof.
♦ * *
Always be courteous to a lady even
though she does bring a man to a
basketball game.
* ♦ *
Never get rough with a physics ex
amination.
• * *
Shoe polish does not prevent a man
from being rough; neither does bril
liantine.
♦ * *
It has been rumored that the Stan
ford rough has become obsolete, but
he hasn't. He has only changed his
ways.
Instead of wearing corduroys and
throwing freshmen into horsetroughs
as he used to, he now wears golf
knickers and throws paper aeroplanes
from the balcony at all campus shows.
