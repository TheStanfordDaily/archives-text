UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS, Jan. 16.
â€”The need for more women in the
medical profession, particularly in the
fields of child health and welfare, pedi
atrics, and obstetrics, was stressed in
a speech given recently by Dr. Flor
ence Sherbon during "Choose Your
Career Week" at the University of
Kansas. Dr. Sherbon stated that a
serious situation was arising from the
fact that few more women are enter
ing medicine now than were ten years
ago.
The expense of a medical training,
the difficulty of the course, and the
prejudice in favor of men in the pro
fession are reasons given by women
for not following a medical career.
Dr. Sherbon believes, however, that
these objections can all be met and
that there is a great opening for wo
men in the field at the present time.
