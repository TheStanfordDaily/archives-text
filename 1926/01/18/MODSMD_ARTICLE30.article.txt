# WEIGHT TEAM SHOWS POOR FORM IN 16-13 WIN OVER SAN MATEO
## 
### 
Although playing far below their
usual game, the Stanford 145-pound
basketballers managed to defeat the
San Mateo Junior College five Friday
night by a score of IB to 13. The
weight team led throughout the con
test, the score at half time standing
10 to C in favor of the Cards. The
Stanford five was unusually slow, and
its parsing was also considerably be
low par.
lial Blazier, forward, led the scoring
for the 45's with five markers to his
credit. Rod George, forward, took sec
ond honors with four points. Ankele,
at standing guard, played his usual
stellar game, keeping the San Mateo
forwards in check at all times. Fred
Newcomb, running guard, was put out
of the game early in the second half
on personal fouls, and his absence
weakened the team.
The Cards sunk a good many un
counted baskets, dropping the ball
through the hoop time and again just
as the whistle sounded for fouls. They
also made a counted goal at the end
of the game, when the timekeeper was
unable to make the final gun sound.
Coach Hal Davis will give his men
hard workouts all this week in the
hope of bringing them out of their
slump as evidenced Friday night, but
he will probably continue with his
usual starting lineup: Blazier and
George, forwards; Saunders, center;
and Newcomb and Ankele, guards.
