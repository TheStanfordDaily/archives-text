# JAKE IRWIN TAKES MALONEY'S PLACE AS BOXING COACH
## 
### 
Jake Irwin, star boxer on Stanford
teams for the past two years, has
been placed in charge of the boxing
team in the absence of Harry Maloney,
former minor sports director. Coach
Irwin is putting his charges through
stiff workouts in preparation for the
first intercollegiate matches with the
Davis Aggies on February 13. The first
matches will be staged at Davis, and
return bouts are scheduled here on the
following week.
The varsity squad appears very
strong this year with four letter men
left on the team. Many new fistic as
pirants are out for positions, and from
all indications, competition will be
keen. Stanford has one of the clever
est middleweiglits on the coast in Cap
tain Schall, a two-letter man. Schall
lias never lost a decision while com
peting on the varsity ,and Irwin ex
pects him to maintain his record for
another year.
The bantamweight division is cap
ably cared for by Collins, a letter man
from last lear's team. In the feather
weight class, Irwin has a dependable
boxer in Miron, who has had two
years' varsity experience. Another two
year veteran, Parsons, will again ap
pear in the lightweight division.
The welterweight class is the only
one causing Irwin trouble at this par
i ular time. Hall, former coast cham
pion, is ineligible to compete this
year. Martin, captain of last year's
team, is not registered this quarter,
so the welterweight hole will be hard
to fill. Stevenson, who reached the
semi-finals in last year's University
championship, is the outstanding can
didate at the present time. Keerl and
Wise, from last year's freshman team,
are also strong contenders for the
position.
Fain is the only man in the light
heavy class. He reached the semi
finals last year, and is considered a
first-rate performer.
The heavyweight class is also a
hard place to fill. Van Hook, regular
heavy boxer last year, graduated, and
Steele, another varsity man, is devot
ing his time to basketball. Arthur,
track and football letter man, is ex
pected to fill the vacancy, but so far
has not reported.
Offerman and Goldwater have been
showing to advantage in the light
weight class, and they may work into
a place on the team. McCall is the
only alternate for a bahtam position
that has shown any marked ability.
