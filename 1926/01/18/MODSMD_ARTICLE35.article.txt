# CALIFORNIA DEFEATS TROJANS IN TWO BASKETBALL GAMES
## 
### 
By winning from the University of
Southern California basketball team
two nights in succession the Califor
nia Varsity placed themselves at the
top of the list for the 1926 Pacific
Coast Conference Championship. Both
games were won with an easy margin;
Friday night the score was 37 to 17,
and Saturday night with a score of
32 to 12.
Nibs Price's pivot man, Bill Higgins,
was the high point man in the Satur
day game, making enough points by
himself to win the game. His total was
thirteen. Captain Kenny Boyer, the
Trojan All-American forward, was
held scoreless by the clever guarding
of Vern Carver and George Dixon, but
he broke through them the second
night and made six points.
Both Benny Holmes and Milton
Butts looked well in the basket shoot
ing, though Butts did not feed the
ball to his teammates properly at the
critical moments. Holmes, though
taken out of the game on personal
fouls, amassed twelve points while he
was in.
Eight members of the Bear squad
were in the play Saturday night. Price,
taking advantage of the heavy score
in his favor, tried out Mills at guard
and Probst at forward. Mills replaced
Carver and proved a capable man in
the position.
California plays Santa Clara next
Thursday in Harmon Gym.
