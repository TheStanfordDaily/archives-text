# RED GRANGE SCORES TWO TOUCHDOWNS IN LOS ANGELES
## 
### 
Red Grange's Bears beat George
Wilson's Los Angeles Tigers last Sat
urday, 17 to 7, before the largest
crowd that has ever witnessed a foot
ball game in the Los Angeles Coli
seum. Although Grange made both
touchdowns for the Bears, both Wilson
of the Tigers and Sternaman of the
Bears made more yardage from scrim
mage than he did.
Bullet Baker made the only touch
down for the Tigers, but it was made
possible by the work of Wilson, who
figured in all but two plays of a march
down the field from their own nine
teen-yard line to a touchdown. The
Washington halfback played an al
most perfect game for the Tigers,
making only two fumbles which were
mainly due to faulty passing from the
center.
The game was more than interest
ing from the spectators' point of view,
for it was full of spectacular runs and
forward passes. Though Grange did
not take the ball as much as Wilson
and Sternaman, he delivered the goods
when he was called on and put over
the touchdowns with comparative ease.
