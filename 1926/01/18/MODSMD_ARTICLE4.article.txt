# QUANTITY IS HARD ON QUALITY OF VAUDEVILLE

### John Doe 
There can be too much of anything
—even of a good thing. This platitude
we respectfully submit for the con
sideration of all those who are plan
ning campus entertainments of the
multi-act type. The Glee Club "Novel
ties" last Friday was like the egg:
"darn good in spots," and these spots
were sufficiently large and frequent
to make the evening on the whole a
rather enjoyable one.
But the human animal tires of
everything, even enjoyment, when it
is too protracted. Could about one
third of the Novelties have been
lopped off, and the remainder re
arranged to better effect, and the in
terval between acts reduced; in other
words, had Gordon Davis directed it,
the show would have been improved
about one hundred per cent and
enough material been left over for a
good entertainment some other time.
Few Acts Good
Some of the individual acts were as
good as anything that has been
staged around here for a long time.
First prizes: for novelty, to "I Think
I Smell Smoke," which had some pret
ty fair singing in it, for performing
ability, to Mesdames Marjorie Allen

and Aileene Burks, even if their har-'
mony isn't all that could be desired. 1
and for general funniness, to Del
Daves' vaudeville within a vaudeville,
that is, to the first three-quarters of ;
an hour of it.
Dorothy Dahler's act failed to get'
across to any appreciable extent. J
There was a lack of action in it and j
Miss Dahler's own peculiar method of ;
singing has ceased to be sufficient nov-1
elty in itself to support an otherwise '
weak act.
The Volga Boat Song, otherwise
praiseworthy, was marred by the per
fectly natural curiosity everyone felt
as to what was going to come out on i
the end of the rope, although they j
knew by experience that the curtain
would drop too early.
Good Clean Fun
Major interest naturally centers
around the Screaming Eagle stunt.
Delmer Daves had a good hunch in
the act and his character work was :
great. The gags were good, but hardly s
able to stand the strain of being con- ]
stantly reiterated, each one of them, j
till the very last laugh had to be!
squeezed out, and they gave pain rath- i
