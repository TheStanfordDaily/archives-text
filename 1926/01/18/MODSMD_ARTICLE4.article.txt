# QUANTITY IS HARD ON QUALITY OF VAUDEVILLE

### John Doe 
There can be too much of anything
â€”even of a good thing. This platitude
we respectfully submit for the con
sideration of all those who are plan
ning campus entertainments of the
multi-act type. The Glee Club "Novel
ties" last Friday was like the egg:
"darn good in spots," and these spots
were sufficiently large and frequent
to make the evening on the whole a
rather enjoyable one.
But the human animal tires of
everything, even enjoyment, when it
is too protracted. Could about one
third of the Novelties have been
lopped off, and the remainder re
arranged to better effect, and the in
terval between acts reduced; in other
words, had Gordon Davis directed it,
the show would have been improved
about one hundred per cent and
enough material been left over for a
good entertainment some other time.
Few Acts Good
Some of the individual acts were as
good as anything that has been
staged around here for a long time.
First prizes: for novelty, to "I Think
I Smell Smoke," which had some pret
ty fair singing in it, for performing
ability, to Mesdames Marjorie Allen

and Aileene Burks, even if their har-'
mony isn't all that could be desired. 1
and for general funniness, to Del
Daves' vaudeville within a vaudeville,
that is, to the first three-quarters of ;
an hour of it.
Dorothy Dahler's act failed to get'
across to any appreciable extent. J
There was a lack of action in it and j
Miss Dahler's own peculiar method of ;
singing has ceased to be sufficient nov-1
elty in itself to support an otherwise '
weak act.
The Volga Boat Song, otherwise
praiseworthy, was marred by the per
fectly natural curiosity everyone felt
as to what was going to come out on i
the end of the rope, although they j
knew by experience that the curtain
would drop too early.
Good Clean Fun
Major interest naturally centers
around the Screaming Eagle stunt.
Delmer Daves had a good hunch in
the act and his character work was :
great. The gags were good, but hardly s
able to stand the strain of being con- ]
stantly reiterated, each one of them, j
till the very last laugh had to be!
squeezed out, and they gave pain rath- i
er than pleasure. To-wit: the assump
tion that a Stanford audience must
involuntarily laugh at the mere men
tion of the word "necking" is an in
sult to the aforesaid audience, but
that word and "good clean fun" and
the somewhat superfluous girl scouts'
tabulation of the number of times she
had been kissed were nearly dead from
exhaustion when the curtain Anally
went down. Nevertheless,"the act had
merit, and Daves should get straight
"A's" for his masterful pleasing of
those faculty members who had the
honor to be mention.
Burks Replaces Randall
Aileene Burks deserves credit for |
the capable way in which she "pinch- |
hitted" for Peggy Randall in the
Hawaiian'act. The string trio in the
same act was excellent. The singing
of the Glee Club did not seem quite
as finished as formerly when the classi-!
cal regime prevailed, but it does not
take two guesses to tell that the cam
pus audiences like the more popular
style of music. The orchestra, led by
Mrs. Atkinson, was surprisingly good
both in the first number and in its ac
companiment to the grand opera bur
lesque
For the benefit of future shows it is
suggested that acts with dancing and
other forms of motion be distributed
more uniformly than they were in the
"Novelties." Concentrating all such
acts at the tail end of the program
made the first half seem rather static
and by the time the motion did come
the audience alread sated was able to
respond only with a fraction of the
energy it would have otherwise.
Northwestern University offers a
month's course for police chiefs. The
main study is the psychology behind
the perpetration of a crime.
