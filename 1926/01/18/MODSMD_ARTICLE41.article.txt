# HIGH SCHOOL HOOP TEAMS COMPETE IN WASHINGTON TOURNEY
## 
### 
UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,
Jan. 16. â€”Two hundred high school
basketball teams will be guests of the
University of Washington at the an
nual interscholastic tournament to be
held there in March to determine the
state prep school championship.
This meet will be the fourth event
of its kind that has been sponsored
by Washington to encourage basket
ball playing in the high schools. The
success of the idea is shown by the
fact that the first year the tourna
ment was held only 71 high schools
were playing basketball, while last
year 209 accredited schools in the
state had taken up the game. A record
breaking attendance is expected this
spring.
The university pays the expenses of
the teams, including seven men and
a coach, and the fraternities take care
of the housing question.
