# Student Window Washers May Affiliate With Union

### 
UNIVERSTY OF DENVER, Jan. 16.
â€”Student window washers at the Uni
versity of Denver may become af
filiated with the American Federation
of Labor, if present negotiations be
tween the University and the Union
are successful.
Complaint was made against the stu
dents because they cut the wages be
low the union scale and thus engaged
in unfair competition. A student or
ganization of workers has made this
competition especially effective.
The Union has not yet decided
whether it wants the students within
its organization.
