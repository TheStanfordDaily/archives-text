# ALLEN WILL PLAY ORGAN NUMBERS BY EMINENT COMPOSERS
## 
### 
Several numbers of more than usual
interest will be heard in tomorrow's
organ recital to be given in the Me
morial Church at 4:15 o'clock by War
ren D. Allen. "Larghetto" from the
"Clarinet Quartette" by W. A. Mozart
will open the program.
The work was originally written for
clarinet and string quartette but has
been adapted for the organ. Mozart
has been called "the most complete
illustration in music history of the
sensitive spontaneous musical temper
ament." He showed an extraordinary
seiwe of beauty in his works, particu
larly in the glorious melodies which
fill them. Pure melody attained its
highest development with him.
Saint Saens Eminent
"Fantasie in D Flat" by Camille
Saint Saens is the second number on
the program. Saint Saens, until his
death a few years ago, was the most
eminent French composer. His suc
cess in all fields of music-writing was
great. He was one of the foremost
pianists in Europe and held high posi
tions as an organist. In mastery of
form, elegance, and finish he is a
representative French artist. Besides
many vocal and operatic works, in
cluding the famous "Samson and Deli
lah," he wrote much for organ and
orchestra. He was the most successful
instrumental writer of France since
Berlioz.
Play Opera Scene
When Engelbert Humperdinck's
opera from the folk tale "Hansel and
Gretel" was produced in 1893 it had
international success and brought its
composer fame. It represents the best
use of the folk spirit in modern Ger
man music, being the familiar fairy
tale of Hansel and Gretel supplied
with excellent music containing a
goodly sprinkling of humor. The "An
gel Scene" from this opera will be
played by Mr. Allen. The music repre
sents excellently the spirit of the
opera with its combination of humor
and romance skilfully blended.
Closing the program will be "Toc
cata in G Major" by Theodore Dubois,
a French composer.
