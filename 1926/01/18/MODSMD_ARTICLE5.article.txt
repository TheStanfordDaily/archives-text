# BABE COURT SQUAD DEFEATS SAN JOSE HIGH SCHOOL 24 TO 4
## Freshmen Miss Opportunity To Run Up Big Score; Sexson Good 
### 
In a slow and uninteresting contest,!
the freshman basketball team took a ;
one-sided victory from the San Jose
High School team in the preliminary
game Saturday night. The final tally '
showed the babes on the long end of i
a 24 to 4 score.
In the first half neither team was j
able to hit the basket with any degree j
of accuracy, and the frosh defense was:
especially weak, buf although the vis
itors were given plenty of chances, j
they were able to sink only one field !
goal. The other two points came from !
foul shots. Seven other free throws j
by the high school players failed to 1
increase the score.
The freshman defense tightened up :
in the second half and the San Jose i
team was held scoreless for this
period, although this was partly on
account of their weak shooting.
Throughout the game the frosh had
innumerable chances to run up a
large score, but missed shot after
shot with amusing regularity. The
shooting of the freshmen was a little
better in the latter part of the game,
but still showed there was room for
considerable improvement.
Sexson, who started at forward for
the 1929 men, did some excellent work
in passing and pivoting. Several times
he dribbled through the entire San
Jose team for a shot at the basket.
frfcCandless played in his usual form
at center and seemed to be the only
man on the floor that was able to hit
the basket. Sibbett's passing was good
but he missed many easy shots. Coach
Hunt used his entire squad during
the game, trying to find a combina
tion that resembled a defense.
Fry, center, and Hatcher, forward,
played good basketball for the visitors.
The starting lineups: Stanford —
Sexson and Sibbets, forwards; Lewis
and Worden, guards; McCandless,
