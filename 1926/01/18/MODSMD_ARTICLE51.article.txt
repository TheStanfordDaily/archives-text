# GRADUATE STUDENTS IN GEOLOGY QUIZZED
## 
### 
Examinations for graduate students
in Geology who completed their under
graduate work at another institution
and who expect to take graduate work
in the Stanford department, were held
Saturday morning in Room 334. Simi
lar examinations will be held within
the next three weeks. All students
working toward advanced degrees in
Geology are required to take this ex
amination, but not necessarily to pass
it.
The examination is primarily plan
ned as introductory and is given with
no advanced knowledge of the type of
question to be asked. It covers all
fields relative to geology with which
the student is supposed to be familiar.
It is hoped that in this way the stu
dent will be examined on what he
knows, and not on what he is able to
"cram" on short notice.
