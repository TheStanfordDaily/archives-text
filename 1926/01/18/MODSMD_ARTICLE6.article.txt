# Wenzel to Speak Before Weekly Chemistry Seminar
## 
### 
The weekly Chemistry Seminar will
meet in Room 20 of the Chemistry
hnilding tonight, January 18, at 7:15.
Mr. Wenzel will have charge of the
program, the topic being "Lead Tet
raethyl."
"Lead tetraethyl" is a successful
substitute for gasoline, especially in
high compression engines, but due to
its deadly character it is little used.
Should the oil supply run short, how
ever, the use of lead tertraethyl would
become important. Mr. Wenzel intends
to discuss the topic from the various
journal articles that have recently
been published on the subject.
