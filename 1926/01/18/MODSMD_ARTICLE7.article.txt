# DAVID STARR JORDAN HAS SEVENTY-FIFTH BIRTHDAY TOMORROW
## Great Educator Intends to Spend Coming Year at University Home 
### 
"They had quite a celebration when
they got me up to seventy," remarked
Dr. David Starr Jordan when asked
to discuss his seventy-fifth birthday
which comes tomorrow, "but there is
not so much excitement now."
Surrounded by a collection of books
and manuscripts awaiting his pen that
would dismay most men at thirty, Dr.
Jordan discussed his plans for the
coming year. Besides a large number
of book reviews and magazine articles,
his time will be devoted to completing
several books. At this time a work on
evolution, another on giant mackerel,
and one on university ideals are nearly
finished.
"I haven't played baseball for twen
ty years," declared Dr. Jordan in fur
ther reviewing his activities, "as my
batting average got so low at that time
I had to give it up. The faculty gave
up the game at the same time, but
for a very different reason which I
can't tell."
Finding travel growing less to his
liking, Dr. Jordan plans to remain
near to Stanford as much as possible
in the future. This will permit him to
give more attention to writing and
lecture work. The noted educator will
continue to be identified with the
progress toward world peace, and es
pecially as the subject is presented
before the school children of the
world.
According to present arrangements
there will be no public or University
tomorrow in honor of the seventy-fifth
birthday of Dr. Jordan. A limited group
of intimate friends will assemble with
members of the family in the evening
to informally celebrate the event.
