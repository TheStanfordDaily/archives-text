Sequoia I started a flashy attack |
in the last few minutes of the game
against Delta Chi to win 9 to 4 in
the only intramural basketball game
played Friday. The other scheduled
tilt was forfeited to the Encina Base
ment team when only three of the
Japanese Club's players showed up.
The first half of the Sequoia-Delta
Chi game was very ragged with nei
ther team able to make much progress.
The only score of the first half came
just before half time when Brandt,
Sequoia, made a foul goal for a total
of one point.
Hardy, Delta Chi, put his team in
the lead shortly after the start of the
second half with a short field goal,
but McKenna, Sequoia, shot a difficult
basket to make the score 3 to 2. After
Lentz, Sequoia forward, made a foul
good, Delta Chi tied the score with
a set-up shot by Suffern. With two
minutes to play the Sequoia team
rallied and scored five points and put
the game on ice. Baskets by Lentz and
Fortine and a foul shot by Lentz were
responsible for the rally.
