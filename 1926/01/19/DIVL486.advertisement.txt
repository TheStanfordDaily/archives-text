CLEAR EYE PICTURES MEAN CLEAR
UNDERSTANDING
IF WHAT you read doesn't go through your eyes right, how can it
get through your mind clear? See easily and you'll understand
quickly. Eyes under strain hinder understanding. You read without
getting a clear picture. With correct glasses your eyes do not
"muddle" your mind by calling for help. The glasses give them
the strength they lack.
