# CONFERENCE PARTY HEARS WORSWICK REPORT ON TOUR
## A.W.S.U. Head Finds More Interest in National Affairs in East 
### 
Mildred Worswick, delegate to the
National Collegiate World Court meet
ing at Princeton last December and
president of Stanford women, gave a
report of her trip at the Conference
party held last night in the Women's
Clubhouse. Miss Worswick .brought
out in her talk the differences in the
various colleges of the standing, work,
and spirit of women. She left Stan
ford December 5 and visited North
western and Bryn Mawr before attend
ing the Conference.
Dinner for the committee on per
manent organization, of which Miss
Worswick was a member, was held
the night preceding the Conference
at a small tea house at Princeton. A
negro waitress, seeing the gathering,
humbly addressed the chairman of the
committee an dasked: "Suh, is dis
heah de World Court?" This is but
one of the interesting anecdotes of her
trip which Miss Worswick told in her
speech.
The National Collegiate World Court
Conference met December 11 and 12.
The meeting opened with a debate be
tween Senator I. L. Lenroot and Clar
ence Darrow on the World Court. Dis
cussion groups met the next day.
The National Federation of Ameri
can Students is a tentative organiza
tion to be changed as students see fit.
Criticism of students was heard because
they are too provincial and not inter
ested in national and international af
fairs. This organization of college stu
dents is to create a feeling of sym
pathy among students not only of
America but also of Europe and the
world.
After the conference Mildred Wors
wick visited Vassar where she was
surprised to find that the girls rode
bicycles. There are so many bicycles
that license plates are necessary to
distinguish personal property. Rad
cliffe and Smith were also visited.
An interesting fact of the Eastern
colleges is that each one has a point
system in use at the present time. It
is regarded as a remedy for all student
problems, and is indispensable. Class
spirit is prevalent in the Eastern
schools as it is the means of becom
ing acquainted with one's fellow-class
mates.
Eastern students show a great deal
more interest in national and inter
national affairs than college people in
the West do, said Mi«s Worswick.
Miss Yost spoke to the women on
the fine showing they made last quar
ter when nineteen women made
straight A averages and only one was
disqualified.
Stunts were on the program, among
them being a parody on Mildred Wors
wick's trip East, written by Harriet
Oliver and called "World Courting."
Gladys McLeod took the part of the
delegate with many interesting ideas
on courting of all kinds.
Those taking part in the senior skit
were: Beatrice Flesher, Vida Hays,
Esther Greenacre, Aileen Thorpe,
Beryl Busby, Hildegarde Tolman,
Gladys McLeod, Muriel Saxon, and
Harriet Oliver.
The sophomores taking part in the
program were: Ida Railey, Jean Stew
art, Dorothy Cohen, Hope Williams,
Elizabeth Bakewell, and Anne Hart
well. Helen Huneke had charge of the
program.

distinguish personal property. Rad
cliffe and Smith were also visited.
An interesting fact of the Eastern
colleges is that each one has a point
system in use at the present time. It
is regarded as a remedy for all student
problems, and is indispensable. Class
spirit is prevalent in the Eastern
schools as it is the means of becom
ing acquainted with one's fellow-class
mates.
Eastern students show a great deal
more interest in national and inter
national affairs than college people in
the West do, said Mi«s Worswick.

ing at Princeton last December and

ing the Conference.

manent organization, of which Miss
Worswick was a member, was held

The National Federation of Ameri
can Students is a tentative organiza
tion to be changed as students see fit.
Criticism of students was heard because
they are too provincial and not inter

dents is to create a feeling of sym
pathy among students not only of
America but also of Europe and the
world.
After the conference Mildred Wors
wick visited Vassar where she was
surprised to find that the girls rode
bicycles. There are so many bicycles
