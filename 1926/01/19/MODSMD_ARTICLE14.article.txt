# ENGLISH SOPRANO TO BE HEARD HERE IN TUESDAY SERIES
## Ursula Greville Has Made Appearances in Opera Concert Stages 
### 
Ursula Greville, English soprano,
will be heard in recital at Stanford
on February 2 as one of the regular
Tuesday evening programs given
under the auspices of the Committee
on Public Exercises. Miss Greville has
been before the public since 1920 but
since then she has established her
reputation as a singer of the first class
both in opera and on the concert stage.
She has appeared as soloist with such
noted symphony orchestras as the
Vienna Philharmonic and the State
Symphony Orchestra of New Yoi*k.

She has the distinction of being an
! editor as well as a singer, having,
\ since 1921, been in charge of "The
Sackbut," a successful English month
jly musical review.

After Miss Greville's debut in Eng
j land in 1920 she was immediately en
' gaged to take the role of "Queen of
the Night" in a production of Mozart's
1 opera, "The Magic Flute." Further
! concert work followed, including a
; tour of the British Isles. In 1922 she
i toured Germany, Austria, and Spain.
! Her New York debut came in Decem
ber of 1922. In 1923 she went to Italy
I for further study and remained for the
' opening concert of the International
[ Composers Guild in December 1924.
Deems Taylor, critic of the New
! York World and a composer of ability,
writes of her: "Miss Greville varies
| the monotony of editing 'The Sackbut,'
one of the world's few readable musi
;cal periodicals, by spreading the gos
!pel of the unhackneyed through Eu
| rope and America."
