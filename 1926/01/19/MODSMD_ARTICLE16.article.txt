# FRESHMAN WAITERS AT HOUSES MAY BE BANNED BY COUNCIL
## Frank Frye Reads Report of Trip As Stanford Representative 
### 
Discussion of a motion to prohibit
the employment of freshmen as "hash
ers" by fraternity houses occupied the
main attention of members of the
Interfraternity Conference at a meet
ing held last night in the Trophy Room
of the Old Union. No vote was taken,
action on the matter being deferred
for decision at next week's meeting.

President Frank A. Frye urged that
it is to the interest of each house to
see that all violations of the rushing
rules are promptly reported to Profes
sor W. B. Owen of the Law School.
The Interfraternity Board of Control
will meet Friday to draw up rules to
govern rushing for the coming season.
These will probably be similar to the
regulations of last year, although it is
expected the season will be shorter
and begin earlier in the spring quar
ter.

A formal report of the national in
terfraternity convention, held in the
East in December, was read by Presi
dent Frye, who attended as the repre
sentative of the Stanford body.
