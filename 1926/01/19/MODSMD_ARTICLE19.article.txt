# DR. JORDAN CELEBRATES BIRTHDAY
## FORMER STANFORD PRESIDENT REACHES SEVENTY-FIFTH YEAR No Public Demonstration; Old Guard Will Pay Respects 
### 
Dr. David Starr Jordan, chancellor
emeritus of Stanford University, and
internationally famous as educator,
scientist, and "minor prophet of demo
cracy," is seventy-five years old today,
and is observing the occasion in a
most quiet way, without celebration of
any kind.

This morning he spent like any
other morning, remaining in his home
opening mail and reading the news
papers until 11 o'clock, when he lec
tured as usual to his class in biono
mics. In the afternoon he stayed at
his house to greet callers. This eve
ning he will hold an informal recep

is his affectionate term for a group of
nine of the earliest professors in the
University, most of whom are now
retired.
Dr. Jordan was born in Gainesville,
New York, on January 19, 1851. He
graduated from Cornell in 1872, the
only man who ever received a master's
degree from that university upon the
completion of an undergraduate course.
He became a professor of zoology at
the University of Indiana in 1879, and
in 1885 was chosen as president of
that institution. Through his encour
agement and interest the University
became a center of scientific research.
Stanford's First Head
In 18.91 Dr. Jordan accepted the

Stanford University. He carried the
University through all the dai;k days
after Senator Stanford's death, solv
ing the financial problems and execu
tive difficulties that presented them
selves. Here, too, he maintained the
policy of encouraging freedom of fac
ulty research.
He became chancellor in 1913, but
in 1916 resigned this office, and be
