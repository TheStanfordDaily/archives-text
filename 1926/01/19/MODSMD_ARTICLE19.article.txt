# DR. JORDAN CELEBRATES BIRTHDAY
## FORMER STANFORD PRESIDENT REACHES SEVENTY-FIFTH YEAR No Public Demonstration; Old Guard Will Pay Respects 
### 
Dr. David Starr Jordan, chancellor
emeritus of Stanford University, and
internationally famous as educator,
scientist, and "minor prophet of demo
cracy," is seventy-five years old today,
and is observing the occasion in a
most quiet way, without celebration of
any kind.

This morning he spent like any
other morning, remaining in his home
opening mail and reading the news
papers until 11 o'clock, when he lec
tured as usual to his class in biono
mics. In the afternoon he stayed at
his house to greet callers. This eve
ning he will hold an informal recep
tion there for the "old guard," which
is his affectionate term for a group of
nine of the earliest professors in the
University, most of whom are now
retired.
Dr. Jordan was born in Gainesville,
New York, on January 19, 1851. He
graduated from Cornell in 1872, the
only man who ever received a master's
degree from that university upon the
completion of an undergraduate course.
He became a professor of zoology at
the University of Indiana in 1879, and
in 1885 was chosen as president of
that institution. Through his encour
agement and interest the University
became a center of scientific research.
Stanford's First Head
In 18.91 Dr. Jordan accepted the
presidency of the then new Leland
Stanford University. He carried the
University through all the dai;k days
after Senator Stanford's death, solv
ing the financial problems and execu
tive difficulties that presented them
selves. Here, too, he maintained the
policy of encouraging freedom of fac
ulty research.
He became chancellor in 1913, but
in 1916 resigned this office, and be
came chancellor emeritus. Dr. John
Caspar Branner, who had been asso
cited with him, not only as a class
mate and fraternity brother at Cor
nell, but as a member of the faculty
of the University of Indiana when Dr.
Jordan was the head, became the sec
ond president of Stanford.
Nationally Prominent
A career of fifty-five yeafs has car
ried him into many phases of Ameri
can endeavor and achievement. He
has served on the International Com
mission of Fisheries, on the Interna
tional Peace Committee, as a member
of the Royal Academy of Sweden, and
ot numerous other societies.
His contributions to science have
been numerous -and important. He is
a famous ichthyologist, prominent au
thor of books on genetics, economics,
and histories of internationalism. He
has always been an advocate of uni
versal peace. In 1915 he was president
of the World Peace Congress. Last
year Dr. Jordan's plan for world peace
won the Herman prize of $25,000. His
autobiography, "The Days of a Man,"
appeared several years ago.
Ruooff gives an interesting picture
of the David Starr Jordan of '94 in
"Leaders of Men." "Dr. Jordan is a
massive man, with a giant's mind. He
is an inseparable part of the Palo
Alto ranch, where professors, and stu
dents, and horses, and meadow larks,
and humming birds grow up together."

Dr. Jordan has written the follow
ing birthday message especially for
the faculty and students of the Uni
versity and for other friends living on
the campus or in Palo Alto:
"I have another birthday today,
my seventy-fifth. That is a goodly
number and it has enabled me to
know a great many people and to
see a good many things. It has
enabled me to round out three
lives, that of a naturalist-explorer,
that of a teacher and adminis
trator, and that of a minor pro
phet of democracy.
"The first two lives were for the
love of the work, and the other
from a rather austere sense of duty
in a world which was going mad.
But it is all well worth-while to live
if you have enough to keep busy,
though as Kipling observed: 'Life
drives him hard who has nothing
in the world to do.* Officially, I
have been for two years turned
out to pasture. Practically, it has
given me time for reading, writ
ing, and talking to my friends.
"Last year I sent out a New
Year's card which I now repeat:
NOT YET
The God of Bounds,
Who sets to seas a shore,
Came to me, 011 his rounds,
And said, "No more!"
—Emerson.
And I made bold to answer:
"My work is only play;
'My Father worketh hitherto,'
And I must work today."
—David Starr Jordan.
