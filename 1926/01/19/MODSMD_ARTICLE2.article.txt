# VISITING PROFESSOR TO DESCRIBE ACTION OF VOLCANIC AREA
## 
### 
W. M. Davis, professor of geology,
emeritus, of Harvard University, ar
rived on the campus yesterday to hold
a series of conferences with more ad
vanced students in geology upon sub
jects related to physiography and re
lated topics. Professor Davis is the
foremost authority in the world today
on physiographic geology.

Wednesday evening, January 22, at
7:30 o'clock in the Little Theatre, Dr.
Davis will present a lecture to the
general public on "Locational Geogra
phy." This talk will be in the nature
of a puzzle, as a certain district will
be described, the name of which will
be left to the audience to guess. Pro
fessor Davis explains it as follows:

"The lecture is on the principles of
Locational Geography, and will be il
lustrated by an account of a remark
able volcanic district which will be
described with the aid of blackboard
diagrams as including the site of a
famous city, the .name of which will
not be disclosed until the audience
guesses it.

"The object is to show the import
ance of describing physiographic sites
before local names are placed upon
them, this being the most approved
means of developing a clear idea of
the actual landscape upon which geo
graphic of historical events are to be
placed."

This lecture is one of the extra en
gagements made during Professor
Davis' service this year as the lec
turer on the Harvard Western Circuit
which regularly includes a month's
stop at Grinell College, Colorado Col
lege, and Pomona College. The first
two have already been visited. He will
spend February at Pomona.
