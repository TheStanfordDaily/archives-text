# David Starr Jordan
## 
### 
Today Dr. David Starr Jordan, chancellor emeritus, completes three
quarters of a century of accomplishment as a scientist, university admin
istrator, and "minor prophet of democracy." The first president of Stan
ford, he has been more closely associated with its growth and development
than any other individual. His wise policy and thoughtful foresight paved
the way for a great University to arise on the site of the old Palo Alto
stock farm. His confidence in the institution he had nurtured, his faith
in the early faculty and directors, and his unquenchable optimism carried
the then young University through the turbulent days of its defense of the
lawsuit in which the United States was plaintiff.
And after he had seen Stanford take its place among the Universities
of the nation he stepped back to busy himself with works of science and
the securing of world peace. He has never rested ; his duty as well as his
pleasure has been in striving to make the world a better and safer place in
which to live. His efforts have met with more than ordinary success, for
lie has Income a world figure, known, respected, and loved on three con
tinents.
It is with pleasure that The Datly Palo Alto congratulates Dr. Jor
dan today, and wishes him many happy returns on this, his seventy-fifth
birthday. In this column we are including birthday greetings from a
student who learned and received inspiration from him and later became
his successor, and from two of the professors who were his associates in
the early development of this University.

One of our best privileges here at Stanford has been that our campus has
become the home of a number of our emeritus professors. They have added
rare charm aud sentiment to one of the finest of university homes.
Leader of this group, grey, massive, gentle, is our beloved David Starr
Jordan.
Seventy-five years is a short time in those evolutionary processes he has
described so graphically to generations of students, but it has been long enough
to give him the opportunity to make a real place for himself in the world of
science, education, and world peace.
In wishing him the joys that naturally come on a birthday when the year
has been well lived, we at Stanford join with a host of others from all parts
of the world in the hope that we shall have him with us for at least another
decade of the same fruitful character as that of the last ten years.
—RAY LYMAN WILBUR.

The unbounded optimism of Dr. Jordan, his firm faith in the future of the
University, heartened us in the dark days after the death of Senator Stanford
in the summer of '93, and in the trying times of the suit against the University
to prevent distribution of the Stanford estate until $15,000,000, Stanford's
share of the debt of $27,000,000' borrowed by the Central Pacific Railway from
the government, had been paid.
On the Sunday after Senator Stanford's death, President Jordan called at
our house, 23 Alvarado Row. He had not yet seen Mrs. Stanford since her
husband's death and of course could know nothing of what was in store for the
young University. I presume he felt that he wanted to talk to somebody, so
he called on A. W. Smith, who was living with us at that time, and on me.
We sat in the front room, and listened to President Jordan as he told us that
undoubtedly dark days were before us, but, bringing his hand down on his
knee, he said, "It is bound to be one of the biggest universities of the country."
And again in the darks days of the suit, President Jordan cheered us with the
remark, "We must stand together or hang together."
Well, we stood together right loyally and that his prophecy has come true,
is due to the fact that he was able to inspire us, faculty and students alike,
with his faith and optimism. —CHARLES D. MARX.

Nearly thirty-eight years ago, Dr. Jordan inviteil me to organize the
department of botany at the University of Indiana, and when he came to
Stanford, I was fortunate enough to be asked to accompany him.
During ail these years, Dr. Jordan's friendship, and his interest in, and
appreciation of, my scientific work, has meant very much to me, and it is
indeed a privilege to offer my felicitations on his seventy-fifth birthday.
It is not necessary to speak here of the great influence which Dr. Jordan's
coming to California has had upon the development of science on the Pacific
Coast.
May he enjoy many more years of activity.—DOUGLAS H. CAMPBELL.

Nearly thirty-eight years ago, Dr. Jordan inviteil me to organize the
department of botany at the University of Indiana, and when he came to
Stanford, I was fortunate enough to be asked to accompany him.
During ail these years, Dr. Jordan's friendship, and his interest in, and
appreciation of, my scientific work, has meant very much to me, and it is
indeed a privilege to offer my felicitations on his seventy-fifth birthday.
It is not necessary to speak here of the great influence which Dr. Jordan's
coming to California has had upon the development of science on the Pacific
Coast.
May he enjoy many more years of activity.—DOUGLAS H. CAMPBELL.

TWO WERE SUCCESSFUL in the tryoutee period of one week for
the business staff of the Daily Pai.o Alto. Those who are to be con
gratulated are Ralph Tracy and Lawrence Lash. There will be a meeting
of old and new members of the business stall at 7 o'clock tonight in the

Domesitc relations in the realm of sport as dished up by the Ohio Uni
versity Green and White:
"The home five knotted the scorc at nine points and again at eleven points. The
advantage proved fickle for a while and then married and divorced each five numerous
times."
Today Dr. David Starr Jordan, chancellor emeritus, completes three
quarters of a century of accomplishment as a scientist, university admin
istrator, and "minor prophet of democracy." The first president of Stan
ford, he has been more closely associated with its growth and development
than any other individual. His wise policy and thoughtful foresight paved
the way for a great University to arise on the site of the old Palo Alto
stock farm. His confidence in the institution he had nurtured, his faith
in the early faculty and directors, and his unquenchable optimism carried
the then young University through the turbulent days of its defense of the
lawsuit in which the United States was plaintiff.
And after he had seen Stanford take its place among the Universities
of the nation he stepped back to busy himself with works of science and
the securing of world peace. He has never rested ; his duty as well as his
pleasure has been in striving to make the world a better and safer place in
which to live. His efforts have met with more than ordinary success, for
lie has Income a world figure, known, respected, and loved on three con
tinents.
It is with pleasure that The Datly Palo Alto congratulates Dr. Jor
dan today, and wishes him many happy returns on this, his seventy-fifth
birthday. In this column we are including birthday greetings from a
student who learned and received inspiration from him and later became
his successor, and from two of the professors who were his associates in
the early development of this University.

One of our best privileges here at Stanford has been that our campus has
become the home of a number of our emeritus professors. They have added
rare charm aud sentiment to one of the finest of university homes.
Leader of this group, grey, massive, gentle, is our beloved David Starr
Jordan.
Seventy-five years is a short time in those evolutionary processes he has
described so graphically to generations of students, but it has been long enough
to give him the opportunity to make a real place for himself in the world of
science, education, and world peace.
In wishing him the joys that naturally come on a birthday when the year
has been well lived, we at Stanford join with a host of others from all parts
of the world in the hope that we shall have him with us for at least another
decade of the same fruitful character as that of the last ten years.
—RAY LYMAN WILBUR.

The unbounded optimism of Dr. Jordan, his firm faith in the future of the
University, heartened us in the dark days after the death of Senator Stanford
in the summer of '93, and in the trying times of the suit against the University
to prevent distribution of the Stanford estate until $15,000,000, Stanford's
share of the debt of $27,000,000' borrowed by the Central Pacific Railway from
the government, had been paid.
On the Sunday after Senator Stanford's death, President Jordan called at
our house, 23 Alvarado Row. He had not yet seen Mrs. Stanford since her
husband's death and of course could know nothing of what was in store for the
young University. I presume he felt that he wanted to talk to somebody, so
he called on A. W. Smith, who was living with us at that time, and on me.
We sat in the front room, and listened to President Jordan as he told us that
undoubtedly dark days were before us, but, bringing his hand down on his
knee, he said, "It is bound to be one of the biggest universities of the country."
And again in the darks days of the suit, President Jordan cheered us with the
remark, "We must stand together or hang together."
Well, we stood together right loyally and that his prophecy has come true,
is due to the fact that he was able to inspire us, faculty and students alike,
with his faith and optimism. —CHARLES D. MARX.

in the summer of '93, and in the trying times of the suit against the University
to prevent distribution of the Stanford estate until $15,000,000, Stanford's
share of the debt of $27,000,000' borrowed by the Central Pacific Railway from
the government, had been paid.
On the Sunday after Senator Stanford's death, President Jordan called at
our house, 23 Alvarado Row. He had not yet seen Mrs. Stanford since her
husband's death and of course could know nothing of what was in store for the
young University. I presume he felt that he wanted to talk to somebody, so
he called on A. W. Smith, who was living with us at that time, and on me.
We sat in the front room, and listened to President Jordan as he told us that
undoubtedly dark days were before us, but, bringing his hand down on his
knee, he said, "It is bound to be one of the biggest universities of the country."
And again in the darks days of the suit, President Jordan cheered us with the
remark, "We must stand together or hang together."
Well, we stood together right loyally and that his prophecy has come true,
is due to the fact that he was able to inspire us, faculty and students alike,
with his faith and optimism. —CHARLES D. MARX.

Nearly thirty-eight years ago, Dr. Jordan inviteil me to organize the
department of botany at the University of Indiana, and when he came to
Stanford, I was fortunate enough to be asked to accompany him.
During ail these years, Dr. Jordan's friendship, and his interest in, and
appreciation of, my scientific work, has meant very much to me, and it is
indeed a privilege to offer my felicitations on his seventy-fifth birthday.
It is not necessary to speak here of the great influence which Dr. Jordan's
coming to California has had upon the development of science on the Pacific
Coast.
May he enjoy many more years of activity.—DOUGLAS H. CAMPBELL.
