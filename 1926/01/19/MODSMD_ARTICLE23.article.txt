## Review of 1925—Track and Field 
### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
The year 1925 will live long in the history of track
athletics because of Paavo Nurmi's record-breaking inva
sion of America. The hero of the last Olympic games
literally ran from coast to coast and back again, receiving
the ovation of millions and bowing in only one real defeat,
and that in his last race and not at his own distance.
The Phantom Finn left a trail of over thirty broken
records, six of which were accepted by the A.A.U. as new
world's indoor marks for standard distances. The greatest
of these was his two miles in 8 minutes, 58 1-5 seconds.
Nurmi's countryman, Willie Ritola, and Joie Ray, the
veteran American, were both spurred on to their greatest
performances by Paavo's deeds; Ritola setting new marks
for three and five miles and 5,000 meters while Ray equaled
Nurmi's best time of 4:12 for the indoor mile.
The heel and toe boys, Willie Plant, of Brooklyn, and

Ugo Frigerio, of Italy, set a flock of new marks, too, and added spice to the
greatest indoor track season ever held.
Outdoors, new marks also fell right and left, chief among them being Tom
Lieb's discus throw mark, which was shattered on successive Saturdays by
tV"> Popst vtronp boys, "Bud" Houser of U.S.C. and "Tiny" Hartranft of
Stanford. Tinv's was the farthest—ls7 feet, 1 5-8 inches. DeHart Hubbard,
the great negro atlilete of the University of Michigan, made a wonderful leap
of ?.=) feet. 10 7-.S inches, erasing Bob Le Gendre's world's record in the broad
jump. Jonni Myra, of the Olympic Club, threw the javelin 212 feet, 5 inches.
The New York Athletic Club won the national senior track and field cham
pionships, held in San Francisco, with the Hollywood A. C. carrying off the
junior title. Harold Osborn won the decathlon crown. The indoor champion
ship was won by the Illinois A.C., with New York winning the junior events.
The University of Southern California traveled to Philadelphia to capture the
Eastern intercollegiate track meet; Michigan won both the Western Confer
ence and national collegiate meets; and Stanford won the Pacific Coast con
ference title.
The presence of Lord Burghley with the Oxford and Cambridge teams on
two trips to America added a touch of royalty as well as international spice
to the season. Paddock and Murchison sprinted all the way around the world.

The year 1925 will live long in the history of track
athletics because of Paavo Nurmi's record-breaking inva
sion of America. The hero of the last Olympic games
literally ran from coast to coast and back again, receiving
the ovation of millions and bowing in only one real defeat,
and that in his last race and not at his own distance.
The Phantom Finn left a trail of over thirty broken
records, six of which were accepted by the A.A.U. as new
world's indoor marks for standard distances. The greatest
of these was his two miles in 8 minutes, 58 1-5 seconds.
Nurmi's countryman, Willie Ritola, and Joie Ray, the
veteran American, were both spurred on to their greatest
performances by Paavo's deeds; Ritola setting new marks
for three and five miles and 5,000 meters while Ray equaled
Nurmi's best time of 4:12 for the indoor mile.
The heel and toe boys, Willie Plant, of Brooklyn, and

Ugo Frigerio, of Italy, set a flock of new marks, too, and added spice to the
greatest indoor track season ever held.
Outdoors, new marks also fell right and left, chief among them being Tom
Lieb's discus throw mark, which was shattered on successive Saturdays by
tV"> Popst vtronp boys, "Bud" Houser of U.S.C. and "Tiny" Hartranft of
Stanford. Tinv's was the farthest—ls7 feet, 1 5-8 inches. DeHart Hubbard,
the great negro atlilete of the University of Michigan, made a wonderful leap
of ?.=) feet. 10 7-.S inches, erasing Bob Le Gendre's world's record in the broad
jump. Jonni Myra, of the Olympic Club, threw the javelin 212 feet, 5 inches.
The New York Athletic Club won the national senior track and field cham
pionships, held in San Francisco, with the Hollywood A. C. carrying off the
junior title. Harold Osborn won the decathlon crown. The indoor champion
ship was won by the Illinois A.C., with New York winning the junior events.
The University of Southern California traveled to Philadelphia to capture the
Eastern intercollegiate track meet; Michigan won both the Western Confer
ence and national collegiate meets; and Stanford won the Pacific Coast con
ference title.
The presence of Lord Burghley with the Oxford and Cambridge teams on
two trips to America added a touch of royalty as well as international spice
to the season. Paddock and Murchison sprinted all the way around the world.
