## PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICE OF PETTING (Cats) 
### Monroe Eaton Pelchino Pep 
A cat is a peculiar animal. Some
times you can pet it and sometimes
you can't. If you don't pay much atten
tion to it, it comes purring around
you and begs to be petted. But if you
catch it unawares, it never wants to
be petted.
You always have to be careful about
rubbing a cat the wrong way when
you pet it. I have heard of a man
getting his nose bitten half off be
cause he did this. It takes caution and
discretion to pet a cat and do it well.
Some cats bite and scratch when
you pet them without really meaning
anything by it. I had a cat once that
bit and scratched so that I had to put
on gloves before I tried to pet her.
Never say Charleston to a cat, you
may cause it to have a fit.
Most cats let you pet them because
they know if they do you eventually
will feed them. When they come pur
ring around you they don't really want
to be petted, they want to be fed.
