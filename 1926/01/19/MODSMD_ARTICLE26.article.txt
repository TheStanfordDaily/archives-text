# Bed-Time Tales for Little Pickaninnies
## 
### 
If y6u should tako a double-eagle
Away from any K. K. Kleagle,
They'd hunt you out with sniffling
beagle,
And fix you good and plenty.
If you should make your getaway
And try to hide out in the hay,
You'd hear the doggie's tuneful bay,
A-smelling out that twenty.
And when they caught you with the
goods,
They'd hike way out into the woods
In sheets and pillow-casing hoods,
And there they'd treat you pretty.
They'd hang you up as high as Haman,
And set your cotton pants a-flamin'.
Then call the skunk that they'd been
trainin'.
And kill you with the kitty.
