# STANFORD Y. M. C. A. REPORTS ON WORK DONE LAST QUARTER
## 
### 
The fall quarter has been mainly
one of survey, restuily of objectives
and function, and experimentation for
the Stanford Y.M.C.A., according to a
report issued by ltex Bell, the general
secretary. Perhaps the outstanding

activity of the quarter was the launch
ing of a comprehensive survey of so
cial forces affecting the character and
decisions of college students.

The special survey committee made
a preliminary report early in Decem
ber, the major recommendation grow
ing out of their study being to form
Jive research commissions—one on
each of the five major phases of stu
dent life: living groups, athletics, stu
dent activities, off-campus influences,
and the University as such —with a
view to discovering exact data on how
these social forces affect individual
student character and Stanford life.
The study was originally undertaken
with a view to rediscovering and re
evaluating the place of the Y.M.C.A.
at. Stanford. It has grown beyond that,
the commission recognizing that to be
incidental to the larger study.
Purpose Explained
The commission states the purpose
of the Y.M.C.A. at Stanford to be "to
associate Stanford men to discover and
practice the highest ideals of life at
tainable, under the guidance of the
teachings of Jesus."
In carrying out that objective, the
Association has held six freshman as
semblies at Encina hall, Sunday eve
nings, addressed by Bob Lewis, Pro
fessors Robinson, Bassett, Willis, and
Dr. Gardner. A freshman council of
some forty members has been organ
ized as a reaull tff the efforts of the
committee on freshman work, Bob
Hefner, '28, chairman. Stewart Way,
'29, is president of the council. Weekly
meetings are held to discuss campus,
personal, and world problems, with a
monthly dinner meeting. A cabinet of
lreshman men are entirely responsi
ble for the program of the council.
The first service of the Y.M.C.A. to
new men was rendered when, during
registration days, 1000 freshman hand
books were distributed in cooperation
with the Y.W.C.A. and the Associated
Students.
Eight Clubs Formed
Boys' work in Palo Alto and in the
campus community has been growing
steadily under the leadership first of
Thad Binkley, and now of Neal Sooy,
'28. Eight boys' clubs are organized
and running under the leadership of
college men, most of them in connec
tion with the Palo Alto churches. The
associate secretary, Ben Culver, has
been meeting with the boys' work com
mittees of the churches, with the Boy
Scout executive, and helping to work
out a comprehensive boys' work pro-1
gram for the community.

The policy of "once a member al
ways a member" has been followed
during the past years. This month the
membership committee, Clyde Smith,
'28, chairman, is making an effort to
reach every man on the rolls to se
cure his renewal of interest and mem
bership, his opinion on what the "Y"
should be doing at Stanford, his criti
cisms of the present program and
past performance, and his suggestions
on constructive development in the
next months. The Meetings committee,
under the chairmanship of Richard
Taylor, '26, is also working on this
problem, and plans three Members
assemblies during the winter and
spring quarters. The first of these
comes January 20, in the Y.M.C.A.
building, when C. D. Hurrey of New
York is the speaker. Mr. Hurrey is
secretary of the Committee on Friend
ly Relations with Foreign Students in
America, has traveled widely during
the past fifteen years among the col
leges of the world, and comes with a
message on "World Trends in Student
Thought." His recent trip in the
Orient, in Europe, and in South Amer
ica give him background for his mes
sage.

dent activities, off-campus influences,
and the University as such —with a
view to discovering exact data on how
these social forces affect individual
student character and Stanford life.
The study was originally undertaken
with a view to rediscovering and re
evaluating the place of the Y.M.C.A.
at. Stanford. It has grown beyond that,
the commission recognizing that to be
incidental to the larger study.
Purpose Explained
The commission states the purpose
of the Y.M.C.A. at Stanford to be "to
associate Stanford men to discover and
practice the highest ideals of life at
tainable, under the guidance of the
teachings of Jesus."
In carrying out that objective, the
Association has held six freshman as
semblies at Encina hall, Sunday eve
nings, addressed by Bob Lewis, Pro
fessors Robinson, Bassett, Willis, and
Dr. Gardner. A freshman council of
some forty members has been organ
ized as a reaull tff the efforts of the
committee on freshman work, Bob
Hefner, '28, chairman. Stewart Way,
'29, is president of the council. Weekly
meetings are held to discuss campus,
personal, and world problems, with a
monthly dinner meeting. A cabinet of
lreshman men are entirely responsi
ble for the program of the council.
The first service of the Y.M.C.A. to
new men was rendered when, during
registration days, 1000 freshman hand
books were distributed in cooperation
with the Y.W.C.A. and the Associated
Students.
Eight Clubs Formed
Boys' work in Palo Alto and in the
campus community has been growing
steadily under the leadership first of
Thad Binkley, and now of Neal Sooy,
'28. Eight boys' clubs are organized
and running under the leadership of
college men, most of them in connec
tion with the Palo Alto churches. The
associate secretary, Ben Culver, has
been meeting with the boys' work com
mittees of the churches, with the Boy
Scout executive, and helping to work
out a comprehensive boys' work pro-1
gram for the community.

The policy of "once a member al
ways a member" has been followed
during the past years. This month the
membership committee, Clyde Smith,
'28, chairman, is making an effort to
reach every man on the rolls to se
cure his renewal of interest and mem
bership, his opinion on what the "Y"
should be doing at Stanford, his criti
cisms of the present program and
past performance, and his suggestions
on constructive development in the
next months. The Meetings committee,
under the chairmanship of Richard
Taylor, '26, is also working on this
problem, and plans three Members
assemblies during the winter and
spring quarters. The first of these
comes January 20, in the Y.M.C.A.
building, when C. D. Hurrey of New
York is the speaker. Mr. Hurrey is
secretary of the Committee on Friend
ly Relations with Foreign Students in
America, has traveled widely during
the past fifteen years among the col
leges of the world, and comes with a
message on "World Trends in Student
Thought." His recent trip in the
Orient, in Europe, and in South Amer
ica give him background for his mes
sage.
The fall quarter has been mainly
one of survey, restuily of objectives
and function, and experimentation for
the Stanford Y.M.C.A., according to a
report issued by ltex Bell, the general
secretary. Perhaps the outstanding

activity of the quarter was the launch
ing of a comprehensive survey of so
cial forces affecting the character and
decisions of college students.

The special survey committee made
a preliminary report early in Decem
ber, the major recommendation grow
ing out of their study being to form
Jive research commissions—one on
each of the five major phases of stu
dent life: living groups, athletics, stu
dent activities, off-campus influences,
and the University as such —with a
view to discovering exact data on how
these social forces affect individual
student character and Stanford life.
