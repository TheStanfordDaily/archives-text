The Editor, Sir:
In the memorable words of Mr. John
Doe and some other great man, "There
can be too much of anything—even a
good thing." My head is in a state of
•much belaboredness, but being un
bowed I want to answer last night's
discussion of the "Novelties." This is
not a criticism of a criticism, but a
slight protest against the spirit of the
reviewer, Mr. John Doe, whoever he
may be. It has been customary in the
past and is good journalistic practice,
I believe, to sign signed articles with
the name of the writer, so the public
may read a criticism as the beliefs
of that man, and may judge them as
such. We wonder just how much Mr.
John Doe knew about criticizing the
show, who he is, and why he used all
your good space to emphasize his dis
trust in general of student ability.

In order to broaden Mr. Doe's under
standing, although I believe he is
quite aware of the situation himself,
the "Novelties" performance was the
result of but TWO regular rehearsals
in the Assembly hall. Mr. Gordon
Davis, the faculty director, according
to Doe, could have put on a better
show; well, that in itself is surprising,
indeed —but it might be added also
that anyone could have put on a better
show if the first of the quarter had
not been used for one play, the next
Monday for final tryouts for the next,
the "Novelties" sneaking in for two
nights, and then bowing its way out
again to the concert which took place
the night BEFORE the show. I know
that Mr. Doe knows we did the best
we could under the terrifying circum
stances, but it is also true that the
expected generosity of Mr. Doe was in
no way exemplified in his article, and
perhaps he was a bit ashamed the next
morning, and didn't have time to re
write it, and at the last minute, erased
his name —and stuck in John Doe.

The show was too long, but owing
to the fact that we had never had an
opportunity to put on a full rehearsal
in the hall the fact was as much of a
surprise to us as it was not to Doe.
Congratulations to Mr. Doe on the
way he grabbed that morsel and mas
terfully handled it.

In conclusion, Mr. Doe bewails the
fact that in the Volga Boat Song the
curtain was drawn before the audience
was allowed to see the barge on the
end of the rope. To be frank with you,
Mr. Doe, there was no barge on the
end of the rope, just some hard-work
ing Glee Club boys having a gay old
tug-of-war to make the more intelli
gent members of the audience happy
that it appeared as though a barge
were being pulled, without hauling one
across the stage. For him and his
helpers and for general edification, all
the facts of the case were printed on
the program—to quote: "a chanty song
sung by the Volga Boatmen as they
pull the barges down the Volga." Come
to a private rehearsal, Mr. Doe, and
we will pull a boat across the stage
for you ho that you may see the little
boat at the end of the rope.
The next time you want to write a
criticism, Mr. Doe--sign your full
name-—John Sour Dough—and we will
all be pleased to read what you think
of our work. Come around and meet
the boys!
Yours for an evening of Good Clean

reviewer, Mr. John Doe, whoever he
may be. It has been customary in the
past and is good journalistic practice,
I believe, to sign signed articles with
the name of the writer, so the public
may read a criticism as the beliefs
of that man, and may judge them as
such. We wonder just how much Mr.
John Doe knew about criticizing the
show, who he is, and why he used all
your good space to emphasize his dis
trust in general of student ability.

In order to broaden Mr. Doe's under
standing, although I believe he is
quite aware of the situation himself,
the "Novelties" performance was the
result of but TWO regular rehearsals
in the Assembly hall. Mr. Gordon
Davis, the faculty director, according
to Doe, could have put on a better
show; well, that in itself is surprising,
indeed —but it might be added also
that anyone could have put on a better
show if the first of the quarter had
not been used for one play, the next
Monday for final tryouts for the next,
the "Novelties" sneaking in for two
nights, and then bowing its way out
again to the concert which took place
the night BEFORE the show. I know
that Mr. Doe knows we did the best
we could under the terrifying circum
stances, but it is also true that the
expected generosity of Mr. Doe was in
no way exemplified in his article, and
perhaps he was a bit ashamed the next
morning, and didn't have time to re
write it, and at the last minute, erased
his name —and stuck in John Doe.

The show was too long, but owing
to the fact that we had never had an
opportunity to put on a full rehearsal
in the hall the fact was as much of a
surprise to us as it was not to Doe.
Congratulations to Mr. Doe on the
way he grabbed that morsel and mas
terfully handled it.

In conclusion, Mr. Doe bewails the
fact that in the Volga Boat Song the
curtain was drawn before the audience
was allowed to see the barge on the
end of the rope. To be frank with you,
Mr. Doe, there was no barge on the
end of the rope, just some hard-work
ing Glee Club boys having a gay old
tug-of-war to make the more intelli
gent members of the audience happy
that it appeared as though a barge
were being pulled, without hauling one
across the stage. For him and his
helpers and for general edification, all
the facts of the case were printed on
the program—to quote: "a chanty song
sung by the Volga Boatmen as they
pull the barges down the Volga." Come
to a private rehearsal, Mr. Doe, and
we will pull a boat across the stage
for you ho that you may see the little
boat at the end of the rope.
The next time you want to write a
criticism, Mr. Doe--sign your full
name-—John Sour Dough—and we will
all be pleased to read what you think
of our work. Come around and meet
the boys!
Yours for an evening of Good Clean
Fun, —Delmer L. Daves.
The Editor, Sir:
In the memorable words of Mr. John
Doe and some other great man, "There
can be too much of anything—even a
good thing." My head is in a state of
•much belaboredness, but being un
bowed I want to answer last night's
discussion of the "Novelties." This is
not a criticism of a criticism, but a
slight protest against the spirit of the
reviewer, Mr. John Doe, whoever he
may be. It has been customary in the
past and is good journalistic practice,
I believe, to sign signed articles with
the name of the writer, so the public
may read a criticism as the beliefs
