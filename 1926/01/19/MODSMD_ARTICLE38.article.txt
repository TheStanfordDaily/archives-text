# CROMWELL WORKING TO TURN OUT STAR TROJAN TRACK TEAM

### 
UNIVERSITY OP SOUTHERN
CALIFORNIA, Jan. 18. â€”In the game
of "give" and "take" which plays a
prominent part in track athletics, the
"take" side has the lead at the Uni
versity of Southern California where
Coach Dean Cromwell is busy whip
ping a mass of 50' cinder and field
stars into shape for a brilliant track
season.
The "give" part donated three point
winners of the Trojan team which last
season took the national intercollegi
ate title at Philadelphia for Charlie
White, pole-vaulter, Keith Lloyd,
sprinter, and Norm Anderson, weight
man, will not be with the Trojan
tracksters this year. These men count
ed BV6 of the Trojans' 33 points to win
the meet last season.
But to overshadow this the U.S.C.
team will still have men who last year
made 24% points. To replace the three
passing stars, four sensational l'rosh
appear. The chief one is Lee Barnes,
Olympic champion pole-vaulter in 1924.
Another is Henry Cogshall, high-jump
er who can do 6 feet 4% inches.
Johnny Parsons, flashy sprinter, is ex
pected to replace Lloyd in the dashes.
Cliff Reynolds, 120 hurdler and high
jumper, will also add class.
In addition, Morton Kaer, member
of the 1924 Olympic team, will be out
for track. Last season Kaer chose to
play basketball but selected track
again this season.
