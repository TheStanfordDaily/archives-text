UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS, Jan.
18. —A comparison of French and
American universities was made by
Professor Charles Cestre, formerly of
the University of Paris and now of the
University of Michigan, in a lecture at
the University of Illinois.
"In France a great deal of
personal work is necessary," said the
French professor, "especially in the
department of literature. So much time
is required for studying that there is
little time for outside activities. As
law is a more mechanical study, it is
only the law student who has the time
to go out for athletics."
Dormitories and fraternities have
been but recently introduced into
French universities. Due to congested
conditions, dormitories have now been
built from a gift fund at the Univer
sity of Paris. The dormitories all have
large athletic fields around them, thus
indicating a decided American influ
ence.
In commenting on French literature,
Professor Cestre said that it is the
provinces where the people are close
to nature that produce the best litera
ture. Therefore, in order to under
stand French literature, one must
know the characteristics of the
I^ovinces.
