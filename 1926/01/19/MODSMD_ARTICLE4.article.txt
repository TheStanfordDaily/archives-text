# BEST PAIR TO GET SILVER LOVING CUP AT FASHION DANCE
## 
### 
"Fashion," the comedy to be
presented by Masquers on Janu
ary 29, will start a new style in
the way ol' after-show dances.
The "Fashion" dance will intro
duce a dance contest, the winners
of which will rgeceive a hand
some silver loving cup donated
by Neilsen and Culver, local
jewelers, upon which will be en
graved the names of the two tri
umphant terpsichorean tramp
lers.
The management hastens to
state that this cup will not be
taken away from the victorious
St. Vitans, but will remain in
their possession as their very
own, to afford them "loving"
memories of their quick rise to
fame. The judges of the contest
will be announced later.
