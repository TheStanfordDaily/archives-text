| WESLEYAN UNIVERSITY, Jan. 18.
I —"The student and teacher must be
freed from the present system of in
j struction so that the teacher can con
i tinue his study and do it hand in hand
! with the student inspiring him," said
Dr. Alexander Meiklejohn, former
president of Amherst College, speak
ing at the opening of the Intercolle
giate Parley of Eastern Colleges on
American Education at Wesleyan Uni
versity.
"American colleges of today are
turning out uneducated men who
; haven't been taught the beauty of
, thought in books. In the future stu
dents will escape the present system
of instruction whereby the professor
merely hands out facts for the stu
dents to give back to him in the form
of examinations and tests. The college
ot the future will act as though the
student has come to develop himself,
and the relation with the professor
will be as one between a master and
apprentice. Both will be studying to
master a subject and the student will
be put on his own. He will be made to
assume his definite responsibility; he
will learn to think."

Only 35 per cent of the 680 men at
Syracuse University are physically fit.
Flat feet and defective eyesight are
the most common imperfectations.
