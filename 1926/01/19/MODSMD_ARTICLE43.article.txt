# MINING LAW ADDED TO CURRICULUM FOR SUMMER QUARTER
## Legal Faculty to Include Four Men From Other Universities 
### 
The Stanford Law School will offer
courses in Mining Law during the sum
mer quarter. This is a subject of great
value to men preparing to practice in
the West and is one that is given by
comparatively few universities. An
other course to be offered dealing with
Western conditions is that in Water
Rights.

The course in Mining Law will be
given by Professor J. Walter Bingham

Water Rights by R. Justin Miller, pro

the law school at the University of
Oregon, and in Personal Property by
Ralph W. Aigler, of the law school of
the University of Michigan, who was
recently elected president of the Asso
ciation of American Law Schools. Both
these men have taught in previous
summers in the Stanford Law School.

law school makes it possible for a
student to complete the entire course,
which ordinarily requires three years,
in two and one-fourth calendar years,
and in addition, since the enrollment
during the summer sessions is ordinar
ily somewhat smaller than in regular
sessions, gains the advantage of
smaller classes.

the summer quarter will include four
distinguished men from other institu
tions. Professor Aigler of Michigan,

Press."

Rights, was graduated from Stanford
in 1911 and received the degree of
Juris Doctor in 1914. He was then for

Law Courses Offered
The courses for the summer quarter
have been arranged so as to provide
not only for advanced students in the
subject but also for those beginning
their law studies at this time. For the
beginners there are courses in Torts
under William Green Hale, dean of
the law school at the University of
Oregon, and in Personal Property by
Ralph W. Aigler, of the law school of
the University of Michigan, who was
recently elected president of the Asso
ciation of American Law Schools. Both
these men have taught in previous
summers in the Stanford Law School.
The summer quarter sessions of the
law school makes it possible for a
student to complete the entire course,
which ordinarily requires three years,
in two and one-fourth calendar years,
and in addition, since the enrollment
during the summer sessions is ordinar
ily somewhat smaller than in regular
sessions, gains the advantage of
smaller classes.
Distinguished Men Here
The faculty of the law school for
the summer quarter will include four
distinguished men from other institu
tions. Professor Aigler of Michigan,
in addition to the course in Personal
Property, will also give one in Bank
: ruptcy. In collaboration with Profes
sor Evans Holbrook, a graduate of
Stanford and now also of the Michigan
faculty, he has written a book on
Bankruptcy.
Dean Hale of Oregon, who will give
the courses in Torts, is author of the
standard work on the "Law of the
Press."
