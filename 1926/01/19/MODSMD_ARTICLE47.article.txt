# MUSIC COMMITTEE SECURES SYMPHONY FOR ASSEMBLIES
## 
### 
"The Stanford Symphony Commit
tee is a group of twelve people who
have the purpose in view of bringing
the best in music, in the shape of the
San Francisco Symphony Orchestra,
to the campus as often as is feasible
each year," said Professor George J.
Peirce, professor of botany and presi
dent of the committee. "The commit
tee is able to obtain the orchestra for
three concerts.

"Two of the concerts will be given
in the Assembly hall and one in the |
Memorial Church on Founder's Day,
at a very nominal price. The admis- j
sion charged for the two Assembly hall
concerts is only enough to cover the
cost of the orchestra, for the commit
tee plans on making no profit from its
services. For this reason we are able
to sell seats for the concerts at prices
ranging from $2 to as low as fifty
cents. This is far cheaper than the
cost of making the trip to San Fran
cisco to hear the orchestra there. It
is the least expensive way that a
resident of the University or sur
rounding country can head this great
orchestra, which ranks with the best
in the country."
The orchestra, as it will come to
Stanford on the twenty-sixth of this
month and February 26, is absolutely
complete and includes over ninety
musicians. Alfred Hertz, the conduc
tor, has been at its head for ten years,
and under his leadership it has become
a musical organization of the highest
rank. A recognition of its quality was
offered when it was recorded in sev
eral orchestral numbers by the Victor
Talking Machine Company. Hertz was
for many years conductor at the
Metropolitan Opera Company of New
York. He ranks as the finest Wag
nerian conductor in America. His in
terpretations are noteworthy for their
warmth of feeling and colorful effects.
Hertz is very sympathetic and human
as a conductor and lias a host of ad
mirers here as well as in Southern
California where he is the favorite
conductor of concerts in the Holly
wood Bowl series of concerts given
each summer.
The Symphony Committee is uncon
nected with the University adminis
tration. It is a self-perpetuating body
j and replaces vacancies in its member
i ship from among the patrons and
: lovers of music in the vicinity who
jare interested in helping in its work.
Membership is strictly voluntary and
is an opportunity to serve. Though it
is mainly a. Stanford organization
some of the members have no connec
tion with the University. Professor
Lee Emerson Bassett of the Depart
ment of Public Speaking is secretary.

"The Stanford Symphony Commit
tee is a group of twelve people who
have the purpose in view of bringing
the best in music, in the shape of the
San Francisco Symphony Orchestra,
to the campus as often as is feasible
each year," said Professor George J.
Peirce, professor of botany and presi
dent of the committee. "The commit
tee is able to obtain the orchestra for
three concerts.

"Two of the concerts will be given
in the Assembly hall and one in the |
Memorial Church on Founder's Day,
at a very nominal price. The admis- j
sion charged for the two Assembly hall
concerts is only enough to cover the
cost of the orchestra, for the commit
tee plans on making no profit from its
services. For this reason we are able
to sell seats for the concerts at prices
ranging from $2 to as low as fifty
cents. This is far cheaper than the
cost of making the trip to San Fran
cisco to hear the orchestra there. It
is the least expensive way that a
resident of the University or sur
rounding country can head this great
orchestra, which ranks with the best
in the country."
The orchestra, as it will come to
Stanford on the twenty-sixth of this
month and February 26, is absolutely
complete and includes over ninety
musicians. Alfred Hertz, the conduc
tor, has been at its head for ten years,
and under his leadership it has become
a musical organization of the highest
rank. A recognition of its quality was
offered when it was recorded in sev
eral orchestral numbers by the Victor
Talking Machine Company. Hertz was
for many years conductor at the
Metropolitan Opera Company of New
York. He ranks as the finest Wag
nerian conductor in America. His in
terpretations are noteworthy for their
warmth of feeling and colorful effects.
Hertz is very sympathetic and human
as a conductor and lias a host of ad
mirers here as well as in Southern
California where he is the favorite
conductor of concerts in the Holly
wood Bowl series of concerts given
each summer.
