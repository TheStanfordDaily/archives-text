# DRAMATIC ACTIVITIES AT STANFORD BASED ON HIGH STANDARDS
## 
### Hallie Keating 
Dramatics upon the Stanfod cam
pus has been organized into an effi
cient system that is unique among
colleges. Although Stanford students
have always manifested a very real
interest in this work, it was not till
six or seven years ago that the begin
nings of the system now in use were
developed.
At that time the production of the
various plays which are traditional
upon the campus, was handled direct
ly by the various societies and class
committees. A coach from San Fran
cisco was hired for the directing, and
the technical side of the play was
theoretically directed by the members
of the group. The proceeds were used
for paying off debts of the the club
or class sponsoring the production.
Cliques in Control
This left dramatics under clique con
trol. The members of the particular
society were considered first in the
selection of casts. The technical side
was neglected. The equipment of the
Assembly hall was miserable. Sword
and Sandals furnished as much equip
ments as possible from the profits of
its one play, and a small income was
obtained from renting the sets to the
othet* groups producing plays.
Due to the efforts of Gordon Davis
and Sword and Sandals, the first step
toward the organizing of a dramatic
council was undertaken. The first
problem was establishing financial sta
bility; the second, to get away from
clique control.
Council Formed
A council was formed, consisting of
one representative from each of the
play producing units, such as Ram's
Head and the sophomore class. The
plan was that one-half of the pro
ceeds of the play should go to the
society sponsoring the play, and the
other half into a sinking fund for the
dramatic activity. A permanent sala
ried business manager was elected by
the council for one year. The difficul
ties of clique control arose here too.
This council proved impractical and
so was dissolved.
After several attempts the dramatic
council was reorganized in its present
form under associated students. As
now constituted, the council consists
of the chairman, who is the Univer
sity director of plays, Gordon Davis;
the vice-president of the student body,
Jacob Irwin; the general manager of
the University, Alfred Masters; a fac
ulty representative, Professor L. E.
Bassett, of the Public Speaking de
partment; the business manager, Paul
Bissinger; one member-at-large elect
ed from the student body, Helen
Lewis; and a salaried publicity mem
ber, Gregory Williamson.
Trained Artist in Charge
The technical and artistic side of
the theatre is taken charge of by a
trained artist, Les Kiler. A system of
yearly tryouts is used to select the
business manager. The difficulty of
finding volunteer workmen for work
around the stage has been solved by
the organization of a theatre work
shop class which studies the sets and
presentation of plays from a technical
point of view, and is given credit for
hours of work about the stage.
The old system of giving part of the
proceeds of the play to the producing
organization has been done away with,
and the entire sum is now given to
the dramatic council. This permits
the purchase of better materials, and
makes for a higher grade of perform
ance.

ly by the various societies and class
committees. A coach from San Fran
cisco was hired for the directing, and
the technical side of the play was
theoretically directed by the members
of the group. The proceeds were used
for paying off debts of the the club
or class sponsoring the production.
Cliques in Control
This left dramatics under clique con
trol. The members of the particular
society were considered first in the
selection of casts. The technical side
was neglected. The equipment of the
Assembly hall was miserable. Sword
and Sandals furnished as much equip
ments as possible from the profits of
its one play, and a small income was
obtained from renting the sets to the
othet* groups producing plays.
Due to the efforts of Gordon Davis
and Sword and Sandals, the first step
toward the organizing of a dramatic
council was undertaken. The first
problem was establishing financial sta
bility; the second, to get away from
clique control.
Council Formed
A council was formed, consisting of
one representative from each of the
play producing units, such as Ram's
Head and the sophomore class. The
plan was that one-half of the pro
ceeds of the play should go to the
society sponsoring the play, and the
other half into a sinking fund for the
dramatic activity. A permanent sala
ried business manager was elected by
the council for one year. The difficul
ties of clique control arose here too.
This council proved impractical and
so was dissolved.
After several attempts the dramatic
council was reorganized in its present
form under associated students. As
now constituted, the council consists
of the chairman, who is the Univer
sity director of plays, Gordon Davis;
the vice-president of the student body,
Jacob Irwin; the general manager of
the University, Alfred Masters; a fac
ulty representative, Professor L. E.
Bassett, of the Public Speaking de
partment; the business manager, Paul
Bissinger; one member-at-large elect
ed from the student body, Helen
Lewis; and a salaried publicity mem
ber, Gregory Williamson.
Trained Artist in Charge
The technical and artistic side of
the theatre is taken charge of by a
trained artist, Les Kiler. A system of
yearly tryouts is used to select the
business manager. The difficulty of
finding volunteer workmen for work
around the stage has been solved by
the organization of a theatre work
shop class which studies the sets and
presentation of plays from a technical
point of view, and is given credit for
hours of work about the stage.
The old system of giving part of the
proceeds of the play to the producing
organization has been done away with,
and the entire sum is now given to
the dramatic council. This permits
the purchase of better materials, and
makes for a higher grade of perform
ance.
Dramatics upon the Stanfod cam
pus has been organized into an effi
cient system that is unique among
colleges. Although Stanford students
have always manifested a very real
interest in this work, it was not till
six or seven years ago that the begin
nings of the system now in use were
developed.
At that time the production of the
various plays which are traditional
upon the campus, was handled direct
ly by the various societies and class
committees. A coach from San Fran
cisco was hired for the directing, and
the technical side of the play was
theoretically directed by the members
of the group. The proceeds were used
for paying off debts of the the club
