UNIVERSITY OF DENVER, Jan. 18.
â€”"Woman always has been and al
ways will be stronger than man," was
the remark with which Assistant Pro
fessor John E. Lawson of the Univer
sity of Denver surprised a sociology
class.
No man, could go about dressed as
a woman does and survive the winter;
he would die of exposure, is the argu
ment advanced in support of the
theory.
The woman's peculiar fondness for
the combination of heavy fur collars,
warm though flapping galoches and
sheer silk hosiery was a point dis
cussed by the champions of feminine
durability.
