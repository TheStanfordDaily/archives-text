# TERMAN SPEAKS ON CURRENT NOTION OF YOUNG GENIUSES
## 
### 
"Contrary to general opinion, gen
iuses are neither stupid when young,
nor unusually eccentric," Professor
Lewis M. Terman stated in his ad
dress on "Pedagogical Lessons from
the Biography of Genius," before the
Education Club meeting last night.

"Geniuses are so often considered
dull in their youth because their more
mature minds are misunderstood. Mod
ern teachers do not, in most cases,
recognize genius or true brightness in
a pupil; crudeness, shyness, and dirti
ness often disguise him."

Continuing his lecture, Professor
Terman said, "When further research
has been completed, it will be possible
to tell the likelihood of progress along
certain lines, in a child of twelve. The
early works of great poets, for exam
ple, clearly foretell their future great
ness; Goethe wrote a mature dialogue
at seven, while Tennyson, Pope, and
many others wrote excellent poems
before they were fourteen.

"In the future, genius will be less
common and more appreciated than
now. The best stock is dying out, and
the problem is serious."

Harold R. Benjamen, president of
the Education Club, announced that
the next meeting will be February 1.
A debate will be given by club mem
bers on the Child Labor Amendment.
