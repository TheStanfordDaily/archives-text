# CARDS TRYING TO SHAKE OFF SLUMP BEFORE U.S.C. TILT
## Kerr Confident He Can Turn Out Strong Five; Clark To Replace David 
### Jim Adams 
With the Trojans coming up Satur
day night hoping to gather up the
salvage of a wrecked Stanford basket
ball team, the Cards are trying hard
to pull together and get off the rocks
before their arrival. The defeat by the
Olympic Club has not convinced Kerr
or his men that they cannot turn out
a capable team once they can find
themselves.
The chances of the Redshlrts against
U.S.C. will be decidedly lessened with
Nelson David iu the hospital. Kerr
will probably use Clark in his place.
No other change in the line-up iB con
templated at the present time.
The affair with the Trojans will
show just what reaction the Cards
have had to their recent defeat,
whether it is for the better or worse.
The upset by the Olympians broke in
on the slow but steady climb of im
provement the Cards were making. It
may have sent them sliding back a
few notches, it may have only delayed
them, or it may have stimulated them
to greater effort.
Kerr is putting the squad through
shooting and passing drills and a hard
scrimmage every night. All the men
are working hard to stage a comeback
against the Trojans.
