# LAST YEAR'S TITLE HOLDERS BEAT BRANNER I
## S.A.E. Gets Easy 34-12 Win; El Tigre Defeats Chi Psi By 18-6 Score 
### Cliff Moore 
Sigma Alpha Epsilon, winner of the
University basketball title last year,
made an impressive showing yester
day afternoon in the second day of
competition of the second round of
intramural basketball play. The S.A.E.
team ran rings around Branner I, win
ning by a 34 to 12 count. Following
are yesterday's results: Encina 3W
beat Delta Kappa Epsilon, 7 to 4; El
Tigre took an 18 to 6 decision from
Chi Psi; Sigma Nu defeated Encina
3E in an exciting contest, 16 to 15;
Phi Sigma Kappa won from El Cuadro,
10 to 8; and Delta Tau Delta trounced
El Campo, 24 to 9.
Gibbons Stars
Gibbons, S.A.E. center, found the
basket coutinually during the first half
of the S.A.E.-Branner game, and gave
his team a lead that was never threat
ened by his opponents. The winners
displayed a smooth passing game, and
had little difficulty working the ball
under the basket. The first half ended
20 to 8, which just about shows the
relative strength of the two teams.
The second half was considerably
slower, mainly due to the S.A.E.'s
carelessness, and Branner's inability
to locate the basket. Bigelow, S.A.E.
forward, showed to advantage in the
last period, as did Frank, Branner
forward. Gibbons took high point hon
ors with 14 markers, and Bigelow was
close behind with twelve. Frank led
Branner with 8 points.
Encina 3W Wins
The Encina 3W-Deke tussle was the
poorest of yesterday's games. Both
teams played a listless type of game,
and seemed content to take wild
chances at the goal. The Dekes at
times showed flashes of good passing,
but poor shooting robbed them of a
chance for victory. With the score
tied at 2-all at the end of the first half,
Encina managed to make two baskets
and a free throw, which was more
than enough to offset the two con
verted fouls scored by the Dekes. Sil
vestri, freshman forward, scored Bix
of his team's 7 points.
El Tigre won from Chi Psi by means
of better teamwork. The club team
played the passing game for all it was
worth, and waited until they had a
close shot before making a try at the
basket. The Chi Psi's displayed a woe
ful lack of teamwork, due to the ab
sence of their two best players. Wood
head, El Tigre center, was the leader
of the club team's offense, scoring six
points in the first period. The score
at half time was 7 to 2.
El Tigre showed even better in the
second half and succeeded in working
the ball down the floor on numerous
occasions that resulted in scores.
Brown was the star for the club quin
tet with 8 points. Manzies, Chi Psi
center, scored all of his team's points
with three field goals.
Offensive Power Shown
The Sigma Nu-Encina 3E game was
a thriller from start to finish. Encina
led 8 to 7 at the end of the half in a
period that was marked by team play
and close guarding. Both teams dis
played more offensive power in the
last half, but hard luck in shooting
kept the score down.
Smalling, forward on the freshman
five, garnered high point honors with
five field goals and a free throw. Dyer
was high for Sigma Nu with 6 points.
Murphy and Quinn did some effective
guarding for the fraternity team.
Phi Sigs Win
Phi Sigma Kappa beat El Cuadro by
one field goal in a rather colorless
game, 10 to 8. Bryant, Phi Sig forward,
kept up his good intramural playing,
by counting for 6 points, in addition
to playing a clever floor game. The
score was tied 8 to 8 at the end of the
half, and the only points made during
the second period resulted from a field
goal by Bryant. Sewell played a good
game for the club team, and is credit
ed with 6 points.
The Delta Taus found little opposi
tion in El Campo, running up a 24 to
9 score with apparent ease. The fra
ternity quintet played a faster, more
clever game than the club team was
able to produce, and made many goals
from shots under the basket. Both
teams had trouble in the first half, but
the Delta Tau players got the range
of the basket in the last period and
ran up a comfortable lead.
The score at the half was 9 to 5 for
the Delts. Morrison played well for the
Row team, counting for 8 points. Bige
low starred for El Campo with two
field goals and two free throws. O'Neal
and Wire, for Delta Tau Delta, and
Hill, for El Campo, showed to advan
tage in the guard positions.

made an impressive showing yester
day afternoon in the second day of
competition of the second round of
intramural basketball play. The S.A.E.
team ran rings around Branner I, win
ning by a 34 to 12 count. Following
are yesterday's results: Encina 3W
beat Delta Kappa Epsilon, 7 to 4; El
Tigre took an 18 to 6 decision from
Chi Psi; Sigma Nu defeated Encina
3E in an exciting contest, 16 to 15;
Phi Sigma Kappa won from El Cuadro,
10 to 8; and Delta Tau Delta trounced
El Campo, 24 to 9.
Gibbons Stars
Gibbons, S.A.E. center, found the
basket coutinually during the first half
of the S.A.E.-Branner game, and gave
his team a lead that was never threat
ened by his opponents. The winners
displayed a smooth passing game, and
had little difficulty working the ball
under the basket. The first half ended
20 to 8, which just about shows the
relative strength of the two teams.
The second half was considerably
slower, mainly due to the S.A.E.'s
carelessness, and Branner's inability
to locate the basket. Bigelow, S.A.E.
forward, showed to advantage in the
last period, as did Frank, Branner
forward. Gibbons took high point hon
ors with 14 markers, and Bigelow was
close behind with twelve. Frank led
Branner with 8 points.
Encina 3W Wins
The Encina 3W-Deke tussle was the
poorest of yesterday's games. Both
teams played a listless type of game,
and seemed content to take wild
chances at the goal. The Dekes at
times showed flashes of good passing,
but poor shooting robbed them of a
chance for victory. With the score
tied at 2-all at the end of the first half,
Encina managed to make two baskets
and a free throw, which was more
than enough to offset the two con
verted fouls scored by the Dekes. Sil
vestri, freshman forward, scored Bix
of his team's 7 points.
El Tigre won from Chi Psi by means
of better teamwork. The club team
played the passing game for all it was
worth, and waited until they had a
close shot before making a try at the
basket. The Chi Psi's displayed a woe
ful lack of teamwork, due to the ab
sence of their two best players. Wood
head, El Tigre center, was the leader
of the club team's offense, scoring six
points in the first period. The score
at half time was 7 to 2.
El Tigre showed even better in the
second half and succeeded in working
the ball down the floor on numerous
occasions that resulted in scores.
Brown was the star for the club quin
tet with 8 points. Manzies, Chi Psi
center, scored all of his team's points
with three field goals.
Offensive Power Shown
The Sigma Nu-Encina 3E game was
a thriller from start to finish. Encina
led 8 to 7 at the end of the half in a
period that was marked by team play
and close guarding. Both teams dis
played more offensive power in the
last half, but hard luck in shooting
kept the score down.
Smalling, forward on the freshman
five, garnered high point honors with
five field goals and a free throw. Dyer
was high for Sigma Nu with 6 points.
Murphy and Quinn did some effective
guarding for the fraternity team.
Phi Sigs Win
Phi Sigma Kappa beat El Cuadro by
one field goal in a rather colorless
game, 10 to 8. Bryant, Phi Sig forward,
kept up his good intramural playing,
by counting for 6 points, in addition
to playing a clever floor game. The
score was tied 8 to 8 at the end of the
half, and the only points made during
the second period resulted from a field
goal by Bryant. Sewell played a good
game for the club team, and is credit
ed with 6 points.
The Delta Taus found little opposi
tion in El Campo, running up a 24 to
9 score with apparent ease. The fra
ternity quintet played a faster, more
clever game than the club team was
able to produce, and made many goals
from shots under the basket. Both
teams had trouble in the first half, but
the Delta Tau players got the range
of the basket in the last period and
ran up a comfortable lead.
The score at the half was 9 to 5 for
the Delts. Morrison played well for the
Row team, counting for 8 points. Bige
low starred for El Campo with two
field goals and two free throws. O'Neal
and Wire, for Delta Tau Delta, and
Hill, for El Campo, showed to advan
tage in the guard positions.
Following are tomorrow's games:
4:15 —Delta Chi vs. Encina Basement
4:50 —Encina 1W vs. Breakers.
7:15 —Tlieta Chi vs. Encina 4E.

ning by a 34 to 12 count. Following
are yesterday's results: Encina 3W
beat Delta Kappa Epsilon, 7 to 4; El
Tigre took an 18 to 6 decision from
Chi Psi; Sigma Nu defeated Encina
3E in an exciting contest, 16 to 15;
Phi Sigma Kappa won from El Cuadro,
10 to 8; and Delta Tau Delta trounced
El Campo, 24 to 9.
Gibbons Stars
Gibbons, S.A.E. center, found the
basket coutinually during the first half
of the S.A.E.-Branner game, and gave
his team a lead that was never threat
ened by his opponents. The winners
displayed a smooth passing game, and
had little difficulty working the ball
under the basket. The first half ended
20 to 8, which just about shows the
relative strength of the two teams.
The second half was considerably
slower, mainly due to the S.A.E.'s
carelessness, and Branner's inability
to locate the basket. Bigelow, S.A.E.
forward, showed to advantage in the
last period, as did Frank, Branner
forward. Gibbons took high point hon
ors with 14 markers, and Bigelow was
close behind with twelve. Frank led
Branner with 8 points.
Encina 3W Wins
The Encina 3W-Deke tussle was the
poorest of yesterday's games. Both
teams played a listless type of game,
and seemed content to take wild
chances at the goal. The Dekes at
times showed flashes of good passing,
but poor shooting robbed them of a
chance for victory. With the score
tied at 2-all at the end of the first half,
Encina managed to make two baskets
and a free throw, which was more
than enough to offset the two con
verted fouls scored by the Dekes. Sil
vestri, freshman forward, scored Bix
of his team's 7 points.
El Tigre won from Chi Psi by means
of better teamwork. The club team
played the passing game for all it was
worth, and waited until they had a
close shot before making a try at the
basket. The Chi Psi's displayed a woe
ful lack of teamwork, due to the ab
sence of their two best players. Wood
head, El Tigre center, was the leader
of the club team's offense, scoring six
points in the first period. The score
at half time was 7 to 2.
El Tigre showed even better in the
second half and succeeded in working
the ball down the floor on numerous
occasions that resulted in scores.
Brown was the star for the club quin
tet with 8 points. Manzies, Chi Psi
center, scored all of his team's points
with three field goals.
Offensive Power Shown
The Sigma Nu-Encina 3E game was
a thriller from start to finish. Encina
led 8 to 7 at the end of the half in a
period that was marked by team play
and close guarding. Both teams dis
played more offensive power in the
last half, but hard luck in shooting
kept the score down.
Smalling, forward on the freshman
five, garnered high point honors with
five field goals and a free throw. Dyer
was high for Sigma Nu with 6 points.
Murphy and Quinn did some effective
guarding for the fraternity team.
Phi Sigs Win
Phi Sigma Kappa beat El Cuadro by
one field goal in a rather colorless
game, 10 to 8. Bryant, Phi Sig forward,
kept up his good intramural playing,
by counting for 6 points, in addition
to playing a clever floor game. The
score was tied 8 to 8 at the end of the
half, and the only points made during
the second period resulted from a field
goal by Bryant. Sewell played a good
game for the club team, and is credit
ed with 6 points.
The Delta Taus found little opposi
tion in El Campo, running up a 24 to
9 score with apparent ease. The fra
ternity quintet played a faster, more
clever game than the club team was
able to produce, and made many goals
from shots under the basket. Both
teams had trouble in the first half, but
the Delta Tau players got the range
of the basket in the last period and
ran up a comfortable lead.
The score at the half was 9 to 5 for
the Delts. Morrison played well for the
Row team, counting for 8 points. Bige
low starred for El Campo with two
field goals and two free throws. O'Neal
and Wire, for Delta Tau Delta, and
Hill, for El Campo, showed to advan
tage in the guard positions.
Following are tomorrow's games:
4:15 —Delta Chi vs. Encina Basement
4:50 —Encina 1W vs. Breakers.
7:15 —Tlieta Chi vs. Encina 4E.
7:50 —Zeta Psi vs. Kappa Alpha.

Sigma Alpha Epsilon, winner of the
University basketball title last year,
made an impressive showing yester
day afternoon in the second day of
competition of the second round of
intramural basketball play. The S.A.E.
team ran rings around Branner I, win
ning by a 34 to 12 count. Following
