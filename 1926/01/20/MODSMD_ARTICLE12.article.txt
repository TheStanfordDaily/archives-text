### Cliff Moore 
Sigma Alpha Epsilon, winner of the
University basketball title last year,
made an impressive showing yester
day afternoon in the second day of
competition of the second round of
intramural basketball play. The S.A.E.
team ran rings around Branner I, win
ning by a 34 to 12 count. Following
are yesterday's results: Encina 3W
beat Delta Kappa Epsilon, 7 to 4; El
Tigre took an 18 to 6 decision from
Chi Psi; Sigma Nu defeated Encina
3E in an exciting contest, 16 to 15;
Phi Sigma Kappa won from El Cuadro,
10 to 8; and Delta Tau Delta trounced
El Campo, 24 to 9.
Gibbons Stars
Gibbons, S.A.E. center, found the
basket coutinually during the first half
of the S.A.E.-Branner game, and gave
his team a lead that was never threat
ened by his opponents. The winners
displayed a smooth passing game, and
had little difficulty working the ball
under the basket. The first half ended
20 to 8, which just about shows the
relative strength of the two teams.
The second half was considerably
slower, mainly due to the S.A.E.'s
carelessness, and Branner's inability
to locate the basket. Bigelow, S.A.E.
forward, showed to advantage in the
last period, as did Frank, Branner
forward. Gibbons took high point hon
ors with 14 markers, and Bigelow was
close behind with twelve. Frank led
Branner with 8 points.
Encina 3W Wins
The Encina 3W-Deke tussle was the
poorest of yesterday's games. Both
teams played a listless type of game,
and seemed content to take wild
chances at the goal. The Dekes at
times showed flashes of good passing,
but poor shooting robbed them of a
chance for victory. With the score
tied at 2-all at the end of the first half,
Encina managed to make two baskets
and a free throw, which was more
