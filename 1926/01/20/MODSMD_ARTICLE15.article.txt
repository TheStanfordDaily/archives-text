# NEW OFFENSE WILL BE USED BY BABES IN CONTEST TONIGHT
## Santa Clara to Play Squad in Final Practice Tilt Before U.C. Series 
### 
With but six days of practice left
before the California freshman series,
Coach Husky' Hunt's freshman bas
ketball team will start the last leg
of the practice series tonight when
they meet the Santa Clara freshman
team.
A new offense has been worked out
by Hunt and will be used against the
Mission babes. In practice this week
the frosh showed that the new offense
is well suited to their style of play.
The defense of the babes is still their
weak department, but the team is fast
rounding into a point-scoring combina
tion.
A setback was given Husky yester
day when it was found that Marks,
who has started most of the games
at guard, had sprained his ankle and
may not be in shape for the California
series. Endo, who showed promise of
making a berth for himself at forward,
was declared ineligible for competi
tion this quarter. The loss of these
two men, coming as late in the season
as it has, will considerably handicap
Hunt's plans.
Worden has stepped into Marks'
place at guard and in practice yester
day filled the position very well. Sex
son is still the best bet for forward,
but is troubled by weak arches. Mc-
Candless is the outstanding candidate
for the center position. Kopp, another
center, is a good floor man, but can
not approach McCandless in shootiirg.
The other forward position will be
contested for by Crary, Sibbett, and
Wilton.
The probable starting lineup as an
nounced by Hunt yesterday: Sexson
and Crary, forwards; Lewis and Wor
den, guards; McCandless, center.
