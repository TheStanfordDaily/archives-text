# Imports Will Take Back Seat at Toyon Club Hop
## 
### 
Imports will be relegated to the dis
card and "the five hundred" will reign
supreme at the co-ed dance which will
he held by Toyon Club Friday night.
This is the first attempt to restrict
a campus dance to Stanford students,
and it is hoped the women will help
make the affair a success by giving
their co-operation.
Ward Hill, Toyon Club president,
and Max Harlow, dance chairman,
have arranged to have Forest L. Hor
ner's Fairmont Hotel orchestra. A fea
ture of the evening will be a hew sys
tem of indirect lighting by means of
spotlights. Sixteen new decorative
plants have been added to the Toyon
lobby.
