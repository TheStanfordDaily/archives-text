# How Old Are We?

### 
Yesterday we heard a long story from a representative of the Peninsula
Railroad Company. It seems that hilarious, playful, or rowdyish students,
call them what you will, have been staying awake nights to think up pranks
to play on the various motormen of the company. Motormen's chairs have
been missing, ropes cut, trolleys pulled from the wire, rear gates broken
open, obstacles put in front of the car, lights turned out or broken, and
students have packed themselves on the steps and tops of the cars in an
effort to secure a free ride. Probably this list includes just a small part of
the annoying incidents which have been done to the company.
The Peninsula Railroad scarcely makes expenses on its line to the cam
pus. It is a public utility and is trying to serve the campus efficiently. If
students continue to block the progress of the street cars, the company is
going to be forced to abandon its line to the campus.
These pranks remind us of those common among grammar and high
school youths. Certainly they are not becoming to college men. Willful
waste and destruction of property seems to us to be the most heinous of
all crimes short of mayhem or murder. Yet, destruction of this sort is
just what certain students who call themselves Stanford men have been
taking great pleasure in committing.
Not only is it costly and discouraging to the company to have to 1)e the
victim of these pranks, but it is also dangerous to those who ride in the
cars and those who must cross the tracks at intersections. If the lights
are out on a car, the chances of automobiles crashing into it are increased,
and injury to persons is bound to follow. And students who hang onto the
rear platforms and ride on the tops of cars are endangering themselves.
The California Penal Code makes it a misdemeanor to ride on the rear
platform of streetcars, which in itself is sufficient cause to refrain from
the practice.
The real reason, however, is the childishness of the whole thing. Col
lege students arc supposed to be grown up, or at least almost so. Why not
show it a bit ?
Aristocratic lines drawn tight at the University of Kansas, as recorded
in the Daily Kansan:
"The fireman's ball will not be an authorized party, according to Katherine Klein,
president of W.S.G.A. Ruling also to apply to men students."
Childhood days recalled at the University of Illinois in item taken from
the police records:
"Ten men at the University of Illinois were fined $10 each in tlie Urbana police
court recently for violation of the city ordinance, which prohibits hitching on behind
vehicles with sleds."
Rise of moral opinion as discovered in the editorial columns of the
University Daily Kansan:
"It is a pity that a man wlio is in the habit of getting drunk cannot see himself
once as others see him while he is in that condition. ... In most instances the uni
versity student is rather a proud fellow. It is a wonder that his pride would allow
him to make such a fool of himself."
Defeat of High Cost of Living as noted by the University of Idaho
Argonaut:
"Three girls dwelt for one month in the 'practice cottage' of the home economics
department at an average per capita cost of 69 cents a day. This amount included
outlay for food, light, laundry, cooking, cleaning, supplies, and entertaining."
Sagacious lines from the McGill Daily, Montreal, Canada:
"The youth of our land is as good as it ever was," declared Leslie Thomson,
M.E.1.C., addressing the Old Scouts Club.

once as others see him while he is in that condition. ... In most instances the uni
versity student is rather a proud fellow. It is a wonder that his pride would allow
him to make such a fool of himself."

department at an average per capita cost of 69 cents a day. This amount included
outlay for food, light, laundry, cooking, cleaning, supplies, and entertaining."

Yesterday we heard a long story from a representative of the Peninsula
Railroad Company. It seems that hilarious, playful, or rowdyish students,
call them what you will, have been staying awake nights to think up pranks
to play on the various motormen of the company. Motormen's chairs have
been missing, ropes cut, trolleys pulled from the wire, rear gates broken
open, obstacles put in front of the car, lights turned out or broken, and
students have packed themselves on the steps and tops of the cars in an
effort to secure a free ride. Probably this list includes just a small part of
the annoying incidents which have been done to the company.
The Peninsula Railroad scarcely makes expenses on its line to the cam
pus. It is a public utility and is trying to serve the campus efficiently. If
students continue to block the progress of the street cars, the company is
going to be forced to abandon its line to the campus.
These pranks remind us of those common among grammar and high
school youths. Certainly they are not becoming to college men. Willful
waste and destruction of property seems to us to be the most heinous of
all crimes short of mayhem or murder. Yet, destruction of this sort is
just what certain students who call themselves Stanford men have been
taking great pleasure in committing.
Not only is it costly and discouraging to the company to have to 1)e the
victim of these pranks, but it is also dangerous to those who ride in the
cars and those who must cross the tracks at intersections. If the lights
are out on a car, the chances of automobiles crashing into it are increased,
and injury to persons is bound to follow. And students who hang onto the
rear platforms and ride on the tops of cars are endangering themselves.
The California Penal Code makes it a misdemeanor to ride on the rear
platform of streetcars, which in itself is sufficient cause to refrain from
the practice.
The real reason, however, is the childishness of the whole thing. Col
lege students arc supposed to be grown up, or at least almost so. Why not
show it a bit ?
Aristocratic lines drawn tight at the University of Kansas, as recorded
in the Daily Kansan:
"The fireman's ball will not be an authorized party, according to Katherine Klein,
president of W.S.G.A. Ruling also to apply to men students."
Childhood days recalled at the University of Illinois in item taken from
the police records:
"Ten men at the University of Illinois were fined $10 each in tlie Urbana police
court recently for violation of the city ordinance, which prohibits hitching on behind
vehicles with sleds."
Rise of moral opinion as discovered in the editorial columns of the
University Daily Kansan:
"It is a pity that a man wlio is in the habit of getting drunk cannot see himself
once as others see him while he is in that condition. ... In most instances the uni
versity student is rather a proud fellow. It is a wonder that his pride would allow
him to make such a fool of himself."
