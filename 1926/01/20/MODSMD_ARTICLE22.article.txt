UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA,
Jan. 18. —More than 360 junior and
senior women formed the Advisory
Group to help entering women stu
dents at the University of California
last semester. Letters of welcome were
sent to all entering women.
Plans for helping the new women
were formulated last April, when 36
captains met to discuss the advisory
system. From theße captains a Japan
ese student was chosen to take charge
of Oriental freshman women, and she
appointed a team of ten Japanese and
Chinese women to act as advisors. A
second captain was appointed to look
after all other foreign women students
entering the university, and a third to
help freshmen who came later than

the regular registration period.
The work of the advisors consisted
in taking freshmen to see their faculty
advisors, making sure that they lived
in a boarding house approved by the
Dean of Women, and taking them to
lunch and to the freshman tea on
i registration day.
