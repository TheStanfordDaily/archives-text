# SPORTS OF 1926
## Another Matty? 
### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Many football fans of the Pacific Coast stoutly main
tained throughout all last season that Ernie Nevers, All-
American fullback, of Stanford University, was a better all
around player than "Red" Grange, although the Illinois
flash got by far the more publicity. As all the world knows,
they both left school to play professional football, and the
early part of this month Manager George Sisler of the
Browns, himself a college man, signed Ernie Nevers to
pitch for his ball club during the 1926 season, at a price
"well up in four figures." There is no doubt that Nevers
is a much better pitcher than "Red" Grange, who tried
with mild success for the boxman's job on the University
of Illinois nine and finally shifted to the outfield.
Nevers'-success as a pitcher at Stanford was very pro
nounced, and his stunts in the box and at the plate bor
dered on the Frank Merriwell stuff. He won the last two

games of the three-game series with California in 1925 after being knocked
out of the box in the first game, getting a home-run in one game and a triple
and a homer in the other. His homer in the last game came with the count
two and three on him, and the bases full! Those four runs won the game.
At Stanford, Nevers was coached by Harry Wolter, former Yankee out
fielder and. before that, a pitcher. Ernie is blonde, handsome, and big, weigh
ing more ihan 200 pounds and standing over 6 feet tall. He has a good fast
ball, and a mild assortment of curves, and a very fine slow ball. Owner
] J;:i Ball. Business Manager Bill Friel, and Manager George Sisler will breathe
easier when Nevers' football schedule is finished, as many a good pitching
prospect has hurt his arm on the gridiron.
