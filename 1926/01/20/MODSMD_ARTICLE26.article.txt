LETTERS FROM THE FARM
Dear Cabbages:
Why is it that, contrary to all ac
cepted laws of poultry raising, chicken
feed never satisfies the chickens at
Stanford University?—Justin G. Al

Dear Cabbages:
Will you kindly arbitrate In the fol
lowing argument? "A" says that Cab
bages (the worthy vegetable who con
ducts this column) must always be a
botany major; while "B" insists that
this is not the case, but that Cabbages
is merely some Journalism major who
happens to be a cabbage (just as oth
ers are nuts, lemons, peaches, fishes,
etc.). —M. T. Head —A.B. (always bet
ting).

Dr. Gardner advises all college stu
dents to make sure that they use the
correct word at the right time when
writing a term paper.
As an illustration of the wrong im
pression which might be conveyed by
the use of the wrong word at the
wrong time he tells of a well-meaning
student who said, when discussing
monogamy and polygamy, "The
Greeks practice the custom of having
only one wife. This they called mono
tony."

For further elongations upon the
subject of the use of cosmetics by the
female of the species, we are forced
to quote once more from the columns
of the Temple University Daily, Phila
delphia.
"Of course our girls use cosmetics.
To banish all cosmetics would be like
banishing all soaps."
Cabbages admits that mebbe this is
true, but there's one thing that he
knows is true. If cosmetics were to be
abolished, soap would surely be
brought back to at leaf a measure of
its former importance in the periodical
ablutions of the mebers of the rouge
covered feminine world. —C. W.
