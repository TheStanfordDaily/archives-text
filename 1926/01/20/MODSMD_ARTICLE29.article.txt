# CAMPUS OPINION

### 
The Editor. Sir:
One can hardly blame Mr. Daves for
rallying to the defense of his dramatic
production, so severely handled by Mr.
J. Doe; but it is to be regretted that
his defense contained so much of de
nunciation and of excuses. Proof that
the reviewer couldn't properly criti
cize a dog-fight, the advancing of evi
dence to show that the entertainment
was up to standard in all details,
would have been acceptable. To admit
that the show wasn't all that it should
boen, and then to bawl out the
reviewer for saying so, adds little to
the prestige either of the Glee Club or
of the injured director.
That the show went on with only
two rehearsals was its fault. Lack of
rehearsal is not a reason for present
ing a poor show; at most it can only
be a reason for cancelling it. If a play
is not ready to go on, it should not be
allowed to go on. To present an en
tertainment improperly prepared is
unfair to the cash customers, is in
jurious to other productions following
it and to the name of Stanford dra
matics in general, and above all, is evi
dence of poor showmanship. Standards
on the Assembly hall stage are admit

tedly high; the organization that can
not utia.n those standards has no
place on the stage.
I regret exceedingly that the Glee
Club saw fit to attempt to break into
the vaudeville game, no matter how
fine an entertainment they may have
produced. With the Football Show, J
Ram's Head, Junior Opera, and other j
incidental offerings during the year, j
the campus is pretty well supplied
with revue and musical comedy stuff.'
The Glee Club is the only organization
that has devoted itself to presenting
programs of the better sort of music.
Admittedly, the Glee Club has had j
tough sledding at times, but one slim
season shouldn't sond the organization
scurrying to the flesh-pots of Jazz. Ap-1
parently its recent venture was a
financial success; aside from that it
injured the carefully built prestige of
the Glee Club and of Stanford dra
matics, it marked the surrender of a
principle, and it led to the writing of j
at least two letters to the Daily, both !

May I close the second of these un-1
necessary letters by the suggestion |
that it is the privilege of newspaper 1
writers to sign whatever name they 1
jolly well please to their effusions, and j

The Editor. Sir:
One can hardly blame Mr. Daves for
rallying to the defense of his dramatic
production, so severely handled by Mr.
J. Doe; but it is to be regretted that
his defense contained so much of de
nunciation and of excuses. Proof that
the reviewer couldn't properly criti
cize a dog-fight, the advancing of evi
dence to show that the entertainment
was up to standard in all details,
would have been acceptable. To admit
that the show wasn't all that it should
boen, and then to bawl out the
reviewer for saying so, adds little to
the prestige either of the Glee Club or
