# COACH WOLTER HAS TWO VETERANS FOR 1926 VARSITY NINE
## 
### 
With but two veteran regulars re
maining from last year, Ilarry Wolter,
Cardinal varsity baseball coach, has
set to work to build a new team from
the eighty men who are reporting to
him daily.
Of the seven regulars who are lost
to the 192G diamond nine, Ernie Nev
ers, star pitcher, will probably be most
missed. For the past two years Nevers
hud turned the California teams back
practically single-handed. Jim Lawson,
Nevers' battery mate, has played his
alloted three years and will be missed.
But two members of last year's in
field remainâ€”Captain-elect Cuddeback
at third and "Chuck" Johnston at
first. Coach Wolter will have to de
pend mainly on the members of last
season's freshman team to fill the
vacancies. Tod Oviatt and Steve Col
lins are the only chuckers from last
year's varsity squad. Both of these
boys have been improving steadily
and they will probably have to carry
most of the burden this year. From
the frouh, Wolter falls heir to three
likely lookilng prospects in Philippi,
Sobieski, and Reynolds. "Dinty" Moore,
of football fame, has shown promise of
future greatness, as has Brook, a
southpaw transfer.
Johnston May Catch
"Chuck" Johnston has been shifted
from first to his old position behind
the plate. King and Widaman, substi
tutes last year, and Sypher of the frosh
will be other leading candidates for
the catcher's job. Sypher, who was cap
tain of the 1925 frosh, looks like one
of the best prospects seen here in
many years. He is a natural ballplayer
with a world of confidence, plenty of
experience, and a lot of the old fire.
"Syph" is a splendid fielding catcher,
and a good hitter.
In case Sypher should be ready for
a regular berth, Johnston can be
shifted to first base, where he played
last year. However, Bill Maguire of
the freshmen looked like a first-class
ballplayer at the initial sack last sea
son and he may step right in. Maguire
is at least an average fielder and a
demon slugger. "Chuck" Johnston's
greatest asset is his versatility, and
if he is neither needed behind the plate
nor at first, he will be a big help in
the outfield. Snyde and Compton are
other candidates who will have a
chance at first base.
Hyland on Second?
Garibaldi and Dick Hyland are the
leading contenders for a regular place
at second base. Garibaldi played bet
ter than average "ball for the frosh and
Hyland is a hitter of no mean ability.
Hyland's prowess with the stick will
make him a valuable man to have on
the squad.
Captain Cuddeback should be due
for a great season at the difficult cor
ner. Cuddy is one of the most sensa
tional college third-basemen on the
coast when he is in form, and he is
a good hitter. He will have plenty of
competition from Draper, Watt, and
Morrill.
Three Shortstop Candidates
Lovelace, a substitute last year,
Soutliworth, who just returned to col
lege, and Busch of the frosh are the
"big three" at short. Lovelace is a
steady ballplayer and may come along
fast this year. Busch, a clever little
fielder with a wonderful throwing arm,
is putting up a great battle for a regu
lar position.
Wolter has plenty of material for
the three outfield positions. In addition
to Draper and Stewart, who took turns
in the outer garden last year, there
are Clark, Sims, Nissen, and Weaver
of the frosh, and Dinsmore, Hunter,
and Hoxie. Clark will report for base
ball after basketball season is over.
Coach Wolter intends to keep his
squad of eighty men for several weeks
in order to insure that no good pros
pects slip through his fingers. The
Cards will probably open their season
in the traditional way by meeting Cliff
Ireland's Independents some time next
month.
