# WORK COMMENCED ON NEW EQUIPMENT FOR MASQUERS PLAY
## 
### 
Work has already commenced for
remodeling the Assembly hall stage
for the production of "Fashion," Mas
quers Society play to be presented
January 29, under the direction of
Leslie Kiler, who has charge of the
technical work.
Since the stage conventions of the
period from 75 to 80 years ago were
to the theatre as something entirely
artificial, this principle will be carried
out by the use of painted rooms, furni
ture, and backgrounds. Some of the
drops which were in vogue at the time
of the original production of "Fashion"
may have to be done by an old scene
painter from San Francisco, as this
sort of stage design is now almost a
lost art.
An old curtain imported from San
Francisco depicting a female figure in
an attitude of repose, and entitled
"Happy Hours," has been procured to
replace the front proscenium cur
tains. The outline of the stage will be
altered to make the apron seem larger
and more prominent than it was in the
old stage, and candle footlights will be
used.
When the play was first produced
American stage settings followed the
European fashions in stage conven
tions. The theatregoer of that day did
not demand the realism that he does
today, and regarded the theatre as
something entirely artificial. Thus he
was contented with painted furniture,
mirrors, and backgrounds to an extent
which would not be tolerated continu
ously today, but which seem quaint
and interesting for a single perform
ance.
Stage structure has developed since
the "50's" to an amazing extent. Mod
ern inventions, stage machinery, and
electrical lighting have made possible
effects which would amaze the author
of "Fashion" or "Life in New York."
Every effort will be made to duplicate
the original performance as nearly as
is possible.
