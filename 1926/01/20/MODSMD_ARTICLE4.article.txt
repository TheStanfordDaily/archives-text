# ROBERTSON, PARKS GIVEN LEADS IN RAM'S HEAD
## 
### 
Alan Robertson and Charles Parks,
two of the most versatile of Stanford's
present dramatic figures, will head the
annual Ram's Head show east which
was announced last night by Dave
Mannoccir, director of this year's pro
duction. Pat Kelley, who took the
leading feminine role in the 1925 show,
will again play that part.
Ram's Head's 1926 show, which will
be given in the Assembly hall Febru
ary 12, was written by Dave Lamson
and Mike Ely, two former editors of
Chaparral. No name has as yet been
given the production, which is a bur
lesque on the "Rover Boys at College,"
one of a series of some twenty-odd
volumes dealing with the adventures
of Tom, Sam, and Dick Rover.
Kelley Plays Leading Lady
Robertson, as Jack Dalton, and
Parks as Dick Rover, with Kelley as
Dora, are the central figures of the
plot. Leonard Schwartz, who played in
"You and I," "The Goose Hangs High,"
and "Dulcy," will appear as Sam
Rover, while A1 Cass, '28, will make
his first appearance as Tom, the third
of the famous trio.
Drusilla, daughter of President Du
barry of the university, is to be
played by Melzar Lindaey of last
year's Ram's Head fame, while Ken

the institution. Chantry took promi
