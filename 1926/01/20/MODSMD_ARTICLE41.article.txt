# WATER POLO SQUAD DEVELOPS STRENGTH IN DAILY WORKOUTS
## 
### Herbert Klein 
Intensive practice and Ernst Brand
uten's coaching are developing the dis
connected group of individual players
who began the season into a water
polo team, a team with coordination
and scoring power equal to last year's
seven. Workouts and practice games
are being held each afternoon at 5
o'clock in Encina pool.
The team which has been providing
workouts for the varsity is by no
means weak. Ineligibles, graduates,
and second-string men compose the
squad, which includes Wally O'Connor,
ineligible because of a leave taken out
;last quarter; Colin Smith, a transfer
with long swimming experience; Chris
tiansen, a graduate, and members of
last year's frosh team.
In the varsity line-up Captain Arden
Allen and Bob Williams have been
playing as guards with the third back
field position usually taken by Graham.
This forms one of the fastest back
flelds over gathered together at Stan
ford.
Art Stewart is playing forward regu
larly, Kryne van den Akker is being
tried out in the sprint position. The
third forward may be Johnny Mack,
Harry Andrews, or Phil Brooks, who
has come out for water polo and will
make a strong bid for the position.
Poulson looks to be the best bet at
goal. Others who are out for places on
the team are Harry Maltby, center
back of last year's freshman outfit,
Ewing Sibbett, and probably William
Hollingsworth.
Both the freshman and varsity
games against California will be
played February 13 in the Encina
pool. According to present indications,
Brandsten should preserve his remark
able records of victories intact, with
the varsity winning Its game by a
big margin and the freshmen triumph
ing almost as easily.
