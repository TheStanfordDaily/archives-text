# PROGRAM ARRANGED FOR CAMPUS RECITAL OF S. F. ORCHESTRA
## 
### Herbert Klein 
The probable program has been ar
ranged for the San Francisco Sym
phony Orchestra concert in the Stan
ford Assembly hall January 26. Under
the direction of the orchestra's con
ductor, Alfred Hertz, the following
numbers will be presented: Anton
Dvorak's famous "New World Sym
phony," Tcliaikowsky's Violin Concer
to with Michael Piastro, concert mas
ter of the orchestra as soloist, and a
modern number as yet undecided.
The program should be very popu
lar since the "New World Symphony"
is one of the most played in America,
at least, of any symphonic work. It
was composed by Dvorak, Bohemia's
greatest composer, after he had spent
several years in New York, and was
dedicated by him to America before
he returned to his native land. The
melodies in it are all original but are
modeled along the lines of native
Indian and southern negro melodies
and rhythms which Dvorak regarded
as the only typical folk music pro
duced in this country. The second
movement is the famous "Largo" with
its negro-like melodies.
Music-lovers of the campus and sur
rounding territory will have a good
opportunity to become acquainted with
the work of Mischel Piastro, violinist,
when he takes the solo role in Tcliai
kowsky's "Violin Concerto." Piastro,
new this year as concert master in
the San Francisco orchestra, is rated
as one of the finest violinists in the
West. Piastro replaced Louis Persinger
who resigned in order to travel as the
first violinist of the San Francisco
String Quartette which is rapidly
gaining a favorable reputation for
itself in the East.
The modern number —no matter
what it is—should be of great interest,
for Alfred Hertz has made a reputa
tion as a foremost interpreter of the
lateßt in orchestral music and has
always been among the first to give
performances of modern compositions
of European and American composers.
He conducted Deems Taylor's "Thru'
the Looking Glass" suite with great
success for the first time in the West
and has played new works of Stravin
sky, Ravel, and others.
The orchestra will play twice at
Stanford besides the January 26 con
cert. On February 16 it will give a
second concert in the Assembly hall
and on Founders' Day, March 9, it
will play the concert in the Memorial
Church as was done last year. The
three concerts have been made pos
sible through the work of the Stanford
Symphony Committee, which is headed
by Professor G. J. Peirce.

what it is—should be of great interest,
for Alfred Hertz has made a reputa
tion as a foremost interpreter of the
lateßt in orchestral music and has
always been among the first to give
performances of modern compositions
of European and American composers.
He conducted Deems Taylor's "Thru'
the Looking Glass" suite with great
success for the first time in the West
and has played new works of Stravin
sky, Ravel, and others.
The orchestra will play twice at
Stanford besides the January 26 con
cert. On February 16 it will give a
second concert in the Assembly hall
and on Founders' Day, March 9, it
will play the concert in the Memorial
Church as was done last year. The
three concerts have been made pos
sible through the work of the Stanford
Symphony Committee, which is headed
by Professor G. J. Peirce.
The probable program has been ar
ranged for the San Francisco Sym
phony Orchestra concert in the Stan
ford Assembly hall January 26. Under
the direction of the orchestra's con
ductor, Alfred Hertz, the following
numbers will be presented: Anton
Dvorak's famous "New World Sym
phony," Tcliaikowsky's Violin Concer
to with Michael Piastro, concert mas
ter of the orchestra as soloist, and a
modern number as yet undecided.
The program should be very popu
lar since the "New World Symphony"
is one of the most played in America,
at least, of any symphonic work. It
was composed by Dvorak, Bohemia's
greatest composer, after he had spent
several years in New York, and was
dedicated by him to America before
he returned to his native land. The
melodies in it are all original but are
modeled along the lines of native
Indian and southern negro melodies
and rhythms which Dvorak regarded
as the only typical folk music pro
duced in this country. The second
movement is the famous "Largo" with
its negro-like melodies.
Music-lovers of the campus and sur
rounding territory will have a good
opportunity to become acquainted with
the work of Mischel Piastro, violinist,
when he takes the solo role in Tcliai
kowsky's "Violin Concerto." Piastro,
new this year as concert master in
the San Francisco orchestra, is rated
as one of the finest violinists in the
West. Piastro replaced Louis Persinger
who resigned in order to travel as the
first violinist of the San Francisco
String Quartette which is rapidly
gaining a favorable reputation for
itself in the East.
The modern number —no matter
what it is—should be of great interest,

tion as a foremost interpreter of the
lateßt in orchestral music and has
always been among the first to give
