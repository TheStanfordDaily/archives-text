# NEW LIGHTING PLAN FOR PAVILION GETS SANCTION OF BOARD
## 
### 
Relighting of the basketball pavilion
was sanctioned by the Board of Ath
letic Control last evening subject to
the approval of the finance committee.
Final plans for the work on the pa
vilion will not be ready until the latter
part of the week, although J. R. Crav
at h, San Francisco electrical and il
luminating engineer, has presented
tentative plans and estimates for the
relighting.
Although originally designed to pro
vide the best possible illumination by
means of powerful spotlights directed
against the ceiling of the structure,
thus eliminating the glare objection
able to players, the lighting system
has proved a signal failure, due to
shadows cast by the steel supporters
for the roof. The contrast between the
bright ceiling and the dark floor has
caused practically every visiting team
to complain of the lighting.
Cravath, who originated the lighting
system, visited the pavilion at the
time of the freshman game last
Wednesday, and inspected the present
system of illumination.
Work of illuminating the pavilion
will begin as soon as definite arrange
ments meeting with the approval of
the finance committee have been made,
according to Alfred It. Masters, gradu
ate manager.
