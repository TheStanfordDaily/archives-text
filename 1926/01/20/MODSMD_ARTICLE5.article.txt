# JORDAN TO SPEAK OF HAWAIIAN TRIP BEFORE EUPHRONIA
## 
### 
Euphronia Debating Society's first
| open meeting of the winter quarter
J will be held tonight at 7:30 o'clock in
j the lobby of the Old Union, with Dr.
| Jordan as the speaker. He will speak
ion his recent visit to Honolulu and
J the Hawaiian Islands where he was
J instrumental in the founding of the
; Pan-Pacific Research Institute for the
study of marine life.
Euphronia is planning a series of
I debates to be held among members
| of the society at bi-weekly meetings.
In the past few years, debating as the
j major activity of the society, has
! given way to meetings at which promi
i nent men discussed current topics.
Open forums and debates with teams
i from Mills College, the College of the
! Pacific, and other members of the de
| bate league of which Euphronia is a
; member, also formed a prominent part
of the organization's program.
The purpose of the new plan for
! debates within the society itself, is to
| stimulate real interest in debating,
j not as a mere matter of competition
with other university teams.
Under present plans, the questions
for the bi-weekly debates are to be
submitted as a motion in public busi
ness, by a member of Euphronia. The
I member making the motion shall give
I the opening speech, to be followed by
the leader of the opposition. The
seconder of the motion will then de
! bate on the question, followed by the
i one seconding for the opposition. The
1 debate will then be open to any mem
i ber who wishes to speak, and the mo
j tion will be discussed until the time
| for closing the debate.
Motions may be made on any debat
j able question, although the president
i is to have ten days' notice of the mo
tion to be debated. The president will
also have authority to select between
two or more motions submitted for de
bate on the same date.
The first of these debates will take
. place either Wednesday or Thursday
of next week, while the others will be
held every two weeks. The plan en
deavors to combine a good debate
with free while opportun
ity for actual debating and for extern
; poraneous speaking will be offered the
' Euphronia Debating Society members.
