# PROFESSOR DURAND NAMED TRUSTEE FOR $2,500,000 AIR FUND
## 
### 
Dr. William P. Durand, professor j
| emeritus of mechanical engineering at
Stanford, has been appointed one of a j
; board of ten trustees for a $2,500,000
1 fund given by Daniel Guggenheim,
! banker and noted mining man, for the
I purpose of furthering the interests of
aeronautics.
The trustees, leaders in aviation, !
engineering, law, and finance will
have unrestricted power to do any-;
thing which, in their judgment, may '
i develop aeronautics. The general pur-1
poses of the fund, as outlined by Mr. j
Guggenheim, are to be as follows:
Purpose Outlined
To promote aeronautical education |
in both institutions of learning and
among the general public.
To assist in the development of com- j
! mercial aircraft and aircraft equip
j ment.
To further the application of air-;
craft in business, industry, and other j
i economic and social activities of the 1
| nation.
In addition to his wishes that the j
fund be restricted to civil activities
and that it not be used in work which i
is properly a government function, j
| Guggenheim said he hoped the trus- j
J tees would, as far as possible, avoid j
duplication of effort with other aero-;
nautical organizations; that they
would plan the work carefully, to con
centrate effort and to carry any in
vestigation through to a definite con- j
elusion, and that they would maintain J
a simple inexpensive directing organi-1
zation, depending on outside estab- i
liehed agencies, wherever possible, to j
â–  carry out the aims of the fund.
Dr. Durand consulted with Mr. Gug- j
genheim during his recent stay in the
' East where he acted as secretary of
! President Coolidge's air board. The
position of trustee will entail only oc
: casional meetings with the board mem
i bers to formulate the policy for the j
disposition of the Guggenheim fund.
