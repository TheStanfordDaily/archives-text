# GERMAN STUDENTS ATTITUDE STILL CONSERVATIVE
## Interested in Athletics But Opinions Reflect War, Says Dr. Marx 
### 
While the interest of the German
j student is turning more and more to
[ athletics, and his activities into closer
; co-operation with his fellow students,
i his attitude tends to remain conserva
; tive and his opinions reflect some of
i the war prejudice and post-war bitter
|nesB. This is the opinion of Dr. Charles
:D. Marx, professor emeritus of the
i Engineering department, following his
recent visit to Germany.
Taking as his subject, "Informal
Impressions of Germany," Dr. Marx
1 spoke in the Little Theatre last night
on the various social, political, and
; economic conditions existing in that
j country today. The object of his trip
abroad was to attend the centennial
celebration of the Karlsruhe Polytech
nic School, where he received ad
| vanced instruction immediately
lowing his graduation from Cornell in
18S1. This reunion was attended by
| representatives from all the leading
technical schools and universities both
:on the Continent and in North and
| South America.
In commenting on the equipment of
; the famous German school, Dr. Marx
| declared that its laboratories were
! equal to and in some cases better
than those at Stanford. There has
been considerable progress made in
1 education despite the hardships fol
lowing the war. A noteworthy ten
dency toward giving scholarships has
: sprung up in Germany in recent years.
The students are not ashamed to
work their way through college now,
as they were formerly.
That industrial conditions in Ger
many are particularly bad at present
was the impression received on every
hand by Dr. Marx as he traveled
j through the country. A number of
businesses, especially the steel prod
ucts industries, have been forced to
, run part time, or in many cases to
! cease production entirely. It is esti-
I mated that more than 1,000,000 men
! are unemployed at this time. The
chemical manufacturers have suffered
from American competition due to the
disclosure of German chemical secrets
in this country at the time of the war.
Political conditions are very con
fused throughout the entire country.
I As one prominent educator remarked
to Dr. Marx, "The Germans aren't
i politically right." Despite the aspira-
I tions held by some of the existing
political parties, Dr. Marx does not be
j lieve that the signs of the times point
I to a return of the monarchy.

than those at Stanford. There has
been considerable progress made in
1 education despite the hardships fol
lowing the war. A noteworthy ten
dency toward giving scholarships has
: sprung up in Germany in recent years.
The students are not ashamed to
work their way through college now,
as they were formerly.
That industrial conditions in Ger
many are particularly bad at present
was the impression received on every
hand by Dr. Marx as he traveled
j through the country. A number of
businesses, especially the steel prod
ucts industries, have been forced to
, run part time, or in many cases to
! cease production entirely. It is esti-
I mated that more than 1,000,000 men
! are unemployed at this time. The
chemical manufacturers have suffered
from American competition due to the
disclosure of German chemical secrets
in this country at the time of the war.
Political conditions are very con
fused throughout the entire country.
I As one prominent educator remarked
to Dr. Marx, "The Germans aren't
i politically right." Despite the aspira-
I tions held by some of the existing
political parties, Dr. Marx does not be
j lieve that the signs of the times point
I to a return of the monarchy.
