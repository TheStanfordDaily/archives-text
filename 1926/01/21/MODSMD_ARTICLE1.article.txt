# DR. JORDAN SPEAKS ON MARINE STATION WORK IN HONOLULU
## Research Institute Has Big Opportunity for Study Of Sea Life 
### 
The work and future of the Pan-
Pacific Institute at Honolulu formed
the subject of a talk by Dr. Jordan at
an open meeting of Euphronia Debat
ing Society last evening. Dr. Jordan,
who recently returned from his seven
teenth trip to the Hawaiian Islands
where he has been acting as the Insti
tute's president, has spent a longer
time at Honolulu than at any place
other than his home on the campus.
In telling the story of the Research
Institute, which has as its primary
purpose the providing of an opportun
ity for scientists to study marine life,
Dr. Jordan first told of the establish
ment of the mine station at Wood's
Hole on Cape Cod, the largest and
oldest marine station.
Under the leadership of Agassiz, the
.great American educator, fifty students
and teachers of Natural History were
called together at Penikese, a little
island eighteen miles from shore. "It
is not school books we want, but stu- j
dents," Agassiz used to say. "The book
of nature is always open and all I can
do or say will be to lead students to
study that book and not to pin their
faith to any other."
Dr. Jordan, in 1873, represented Illi- j
nois at Penikese. Shortly after, owing j
to financial difficulties, the school was;
moved to Wood's Hole on Cape Cod,
directed by Spencer F. Baird, secre- i
tary of the Smithsonian Institution and
founder of nearly all the national bu-;
reaus of science in Washington.
' With humble beginnings and numer-1
<ius hardships, the Wood's Hole sta-!
lion has grown, until today, directed |
by Dr. Frank Lillie of the University j
of Chicago, the institute is by far the
largest in existence.
Among the visitors at the Massa
chusetts station was Timothy Hopkins,
trustee of Stanford University. Desir
ing to establish a station of the same I
type on the Pacific Coast, Hopkins j
founded the marine station at Pacific j
Grove, which is considered among the
five best stations of the present time, j
The newly founded station at Hono- j
lulu has a decided advantage in its
international character. Belonging
alone to neither to Hawaii nor to the
United States, it is situated "near the ,
shores of the Pacific where most of the j
people on earth find their homes." The
Honolulu station also has far more
facilities for studying tropical insects,
and flower and fruit life, in addition to
work in investigating the marine life,;
especially the plankton of the surface. [
The Pacific has three to five times as
many kinds of animals as the Atlantic, j
Founded chiefly through the agency j
of Alexander Hume Ford, the institute [
is the home of many scientists repre- j
senting large concerns such as sugar j
and pineapple growers. In addition i
there are many noted men such as Dr.
Ichikawa, the fishery expert of Japan, |
Dr. Larson of Cornell, and others who
are engaged in scientific work on the
islands.
While at the Pan-Pacific Research
Insitution, Dr. Jordan completed two
books on which he was at work, be
sides several pamphlets and a number
of addresses. Although invited to
spend this winter as acting president
of the Hawaiian station, Dr. Jordan
said that he doubted if he would at
tend.
