Illustrated Review will be on sale
Monday. Copies may be obtained at
the Bookstore. Subscriptions for the
balance of this year will be $1.50, J. E.
McDowell, alumni secretary, an- j
nounced.
This issue contains several features
especially interesting to students. One
article contains the results of the in- i
telligence tests given incoming fresh- i
men during the last three or four
years.
Another article involves a discus
sion of the independent study plan, as
used by Stanford. Most of the students
are vaguely familiar with this plan,'
but this will give them an opportunity |
to find the details for themselves.
The Review also contains a story of
the alumni of Stanford who have be
come prominent journalists. One of
these is, of course, Maxville Ander- j
son, the author of "What Price Glory." ;
Mr. Anderson was a graduate student
at Stanford in 1914.
The cover design is a photograph of
a silhouetted eucalyptus tree on the
road to Roble bridge. This picture re- j
ceived a prize in a recent Boston cam- j
era contest.
