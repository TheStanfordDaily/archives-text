# FRESHMAN QUINTET WINS EASILY FROM BRONC BABES 27-13
## Hunt's Yearlings Display Improvement; Will Be Ready for Cubs 
### Cliff McDowell 
With little competition the freshman
basketball team won from the Santa
Clara freshmen last night by a score
of 27 to 13. The Cardinal babes were
given plenty of shots at the basket,
and hard luck on several close shots
kept them from running up a larger
score. The frosh showed that they
are constantly improving and will
reach their top form when they meet
the California Cubs January 29.
Santa Clara started the babes on
their scoring march when one of the
Bronco yearlings became confused and
tried to sink the ball in the Stanford
basket. He narrowly missed his shot
but McCandless touched it on a fol
low-through shot.
Babe Offense Strong
Husky Hunt's offense was too
strong for the visitors, and shots at
the hoop, were frequent throughout
the game. The defense of the Card
freshmen showed considerable im
provement since the last game, the
majority of play being in the visitor's
territory.
McCandless was playing in wonder
lul form last night, accounting for
thirteen of the babes' points. Crary
played better than in any other start
this season, making several spectacu
lar shots. Sexson played his usual good
floor game, but was off on his shoot
ing. Lewis handled the ball very well
and broke up many of the Santa Clara
plays. His shooting was much better
than before, as he sank three field
goals and two foul shots. Word9n
seems to fit in very well as a running
mate for Lewis at the other guard
position. He has learned the art of
covering under the basket, and al
lowed but few close shots. Moore and
Harrington starred for the visitors.
Meet Cubs Next Week
The California and Stanford fresh
men meet on the court a week from
Friday in the first game of what prom
ises to be a hotly contested series.
California has a big, heavy team to
match against Hunt's light, fast outfit.
Both teams have played Berkeley
High School, and on a basis of com
parative scores California has a slight
edge over the Stanford freshmen.
The starting lineup for last night's
game:
Stanford —Crary and Sexsou, for
wards; Lewis and Worden, guards;
McCandless, center. Substitutions:

men meet on the court a week from
Friday in the first game of what prom
ises to be a hotly contested series.
California has a big, heavy team to
match against Hunt's light, fast outfit.
Both teams have played Berkeley
High School, and on a basis of com
parative scores California has a slight
edge over the Stanford freshmen.
The starting lineup for last night's
game:
Stanford —Crary and Sexsou, for
wards; Lewis and Worden, guards;
McCandless, center. Substitutions:
Renzel, Wilton, Kopp, Davis, Klabau,
Gsmonson, Sibbett, and Robb.
Santa Clara freshmen: Varanni and
Segreti, forwards; McGovern and
Draper, guards; Moore, center. Sub
stitutions: Killkenni, Harrington,
Bricca, and Graham.
With little competition the freshman
basketball team won from the Santa
Clara freshmen last night by a score
of 27 to 13. The Cardinal babes were
given plenty of shots at the basket,
and hard luck on several close shots
kept them from running up a larger
score. The frosh showed that they
are constantly improving and will
reach their top form when they meet
the California Cubs January 29.
Santa Clara started the babes on
their scoring march when one of the
Bronco yearlings became confused and
tried to sink the ball in the Stanford
basket. He narrowly missed his shot
but McCandless touched it on a fol
low-through shot.
Babe Offense Strong
Husky Hunt's offense was too
strong for the visitors, and shots at
the hoop, were frequent throughout
the game. The defense of the Card
freshmen showed considerable im
provement since the last game, the
majority of play being in the visitor's
territory.
McCandless was playing in wonder
lul form last night, accounting for
thirteen of the babes' points. Crary
played better than in any other start
this season, making several spectacu
lar shots. Sexson played his usual good
floor game, but was off on his shoot
ing. Lewis handled the ball very well
and broke up many of the Santa Clara
plays. His shooting was much better
than before, as he sank three field
goals and two foul shots. Word9n
seems to fit in very well as a running
mate for Lewis at the other guard
position. He has learned the art of
covering under the basket, and al
lowed but few close shots. Moore and
Harrington starred for the visitors.
