# HUSKY HUNT TO SUCCEED KERR AS MENTOR OF VARSITY FIVE
## Board of Athletic Control Recommends Selection of Freshman Coach 
### 
Ernest P. Hunt, director of fresh
man sports, has been named by the
Board of Athletic Control to succeed
Coach Andrew Kerr, varsity basket
ball mentor who resigned to take a
position as director of physical educa
tion at Washington and Jefferson. The
decision of the board must be approved
by the Board of Trustees and by Presi
dent Wilbur before Hunt's appoint
ment officially takes effect.
Husky Hunt is at present coach of
freshman basketball, football, and
baseball, and will continue in this
capacity until the basketball season of
next year. No successor to his posi
tion as freshman hoop coach has been
named.
Tiny Thornhill, varsity line coach
and assistant to Pop Warner, will be
the only assistant in the fall sport, as
Kerr's position as backfield coach will
not be filled.
Hunt, who came to Stanford in 1922,
has met with signal success in direct
ing freshman activities. His yearling
teams defeated the Bear babes in both
1923 and 1924, the only defeats the
Berkeley cubs have suffered in foot
ball at the hands of Stanford since
the "Little Big Game" has been held.
Winning teams in both basketball and
baseball have attended the Cardinal
babes since Hunt's advent.
Before coming to Stanford, Hunt
held positions in the physical educa
tion faculties at Indiana University,
where he took out an A.B. degree in
1913, at Linton, Ind., Monte Vista,
Colo., Waco, Texas, and at Berkeley
high school from 1918 to 1921. While
coaching the Yellowjackets, he turned
out some of the strongest interscholas
tic teams in California.
Among Hunt's former proteges at
Berkeley high school are Howard Mit
chell, Fred Swan, Jimmy Dixon, and
Mike Murphy. Several other former
Yellowjackets have played on both
Stanford and California teams.
