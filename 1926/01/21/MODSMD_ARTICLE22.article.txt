# Why Be Quitters?

Reports from the Board of Athletic Control yesterday indicate that
only 340 rooters' tickets had been sold for the U.S.C. game at the close of
the regular sale. With more than 3000 students registered in the Univer
sity this is a sign of a deplorable lack of interest in the basketball team and
in things Stanford generally.
Perhaps the Stanford basketball team is not an aggregation of confer
ence champions; perhaps it has l>een defeated twice this season; perhaps
the Trojans are still recovering from a trouncing at the hands of California
still these things are certainly not reasons why nine-tenths of the Stanford
student body should ignore the approach of the first conference tilt or why
such a percentage of those who declare the Stanford spirit is what it should
be should hie themselves off to the city or the movie or elsewhere in pref
erence to seeing a defeated Stanford team play basketball against a no
torious enemy.
We admit that the varsity looked exceptionally weak in its clash with
the Olympic club last week. Still, the Redshirts are capable of playing
better ball, and we have every reason to believe that they will when
aroused by the natural antagonism against the southerners. U.S.C. is
coming up prepared to give a good account of itself, and since both teams
appear to be on a par a good, close, hard fought game should be the result.
The mere thoughts of a possible close game with a final Stanford vic
tory should not be necessary to draw crowds to the pavilion. Coach Andy
Kerr has a group of a dozen or so men who are out working harder every
night than they would be if they were winning. These men are entitled to
the support of every meml>er of the student body. They are doing their
best. The Associated Students are not.
