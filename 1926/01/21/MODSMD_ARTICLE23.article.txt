# Up from the "Cellar"

It is granted:
(1) That a great University must find it very difficult to concern itself
with details;
(2) That the details given attention are undoubtedly quite important
little details;
(3) That Stanford University accomplished quite a feat of evolution
in adding a "Cellar" to an important but paltry "Roughs' Roost";
(4) That "Bud" and "Jack" and the rest of the confectionery servitors
are doing their best.
But the Daily Pai.o Alto wonders if:
Stanford University, in its attention to details, could not improve the
service in its confectionery, otherwise known as the "Cellar"? The food,
when one finally gets it, is good—which speaks well for the kitchen force.
Why not add to said force and give 9 p.m. orders attention before 10 p.m. ?
A University does not itself ordinarily visit "Cellars" in the quest of
an evening lunch or an after-show "bite," but surely officials of Stanford
University themselves have visited the "Cellar" and wondered—with hun
dreds of others—if their orders would appear before breakfast the next
morn.
Wherefore, the Daily Palo Alto, though it has never managed a
"Cellar," wonders if an improvement in service could be made by Stanford
University for its confectionery.
