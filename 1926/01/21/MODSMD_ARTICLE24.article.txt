# Let There Be Light"

Many will note with satisfaction that tentative plans have been made
for improvement in the pavilion lighting system. At present, spotlights
directed at the ceiling to avoid direct light achieve their purposeâ€”but cast
heavy shadows over the pavilion floor.
As a result of the dim light so given, visiting teams particularly have
found it difficult to pass the ball accurately or to catch a fast ball. Coaches
have been known to compel their men to dress in darkness in the dressing
rooms to make the pavilion lights appear brighter.
With an efficient lighting system, a disagreeable element in pavilion
construction will have been removed with resulting satisfaction to all
concerned.
