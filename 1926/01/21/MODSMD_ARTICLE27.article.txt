# SPORTS OF 1926
## The 						Gold-Digger 
### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
So here's the "Orchid Man" back again, out-Patting
Patti in the way of farewell tours, and liable to get away
with considerable cash for just one more great "kissing
the-canvas" act. That boy sure commits murder when it
comes to drawing in the customers, and, though he nearly
always fails to justify his title as champion of any sort, he
usually gives the fans a run for their money in the way
of dying gamely, gracefully, and dramatically.
"Those Georges," as he (or they) is (or are) sometimes
called, is (or are) a great actor (or actors). That much is
certain. But as a fighter—there must be some mistake!
What a pity that pretty Helen Wills sailed for France on
the very same day that Gorgeous Georges sailed for Amer
ica. Too bad that she didn't wait and K.O. the orchid man
before going across to beat Suzanne. She probably could
do it; and it would simplify matters so.

In looking over Georges' brief ring career in America, it is easy to see
that there is nothing to cheer about. In 1920 he knocked out Battling
Levinsky in four rounds in a bout that has always been questioned. Anyway,
it served to build up his match with Dempsey in 1921, when he was knocked
out in four rounds. And it was in that bout, in the second round, that he
landed the only good punch that he ever struck in these United States—a nice
righ to Mr. Dempsey's whiskers that really dazed the champion. Then in
1924 Carpentier returned, to be badly beaten by Tommy Gibbons, who kindly
withheld the knockout for Gene Tunney to administer two months later.
But give the kid credit—he's been fighting since he was fourteen, and has
held every championship of France. And he has a war record, an engaging
smile, a marvelous pair of legs, and a very elegant bathrobe!
