By means of hypnotic suggestion
which made subjects believe that poi
sons administered to them were noth
ing but water, two Swedish scientists
have been able to offset the effect of
the poisons on the human system.—

Cabbages thinks that if hypnotism
can counteract poison it ought to be |
able to counteract about anything else,!
including mumps and bawl-out records, j

Our scientist friends would do well
to write a textbook on hypnotism hints
for hysterical horseflies and hypocon
driacal home brewers.
* * *
It would be a great advantage to
students who have eight o'clock class
es in the chemistry or medical build
ings If Fords could be hypnotized into
starting on cold mornings.
* * *
Those who find difficulty in getting
campus dates should try hypnotizingj
the statues at the entrance to the j
library. Many other possibilities will
also be found in the museum and the
art gallery.
* * *
At last a means has been found by j
which all students living on the cam-j
pus can get good food. If campus |
cooks who have difficulty in persuad-;
ing students to eat their cooking would
employ hypnotists for each meal they
would have no trouble in disposing of
even the odds and ends.

Women who are able to get only
blind dates should try hypotism on
their escorts.
♦ * *
Those who have trouble in passing
examinations will find the power of
hypnotism a great asset. Just catch
your professor alone in his office, j
bring your pen and examination book
along, and go to it.
• • *
Dja ever try to hypnotize anybody
with a saxophone. It can be done (by
some people).
* * *
Now that Toyon Club is going to
give a dance to which only co-eds will
be admitted, hypnotism may come in
handy.
»• * *
It Is probable that bootleggers will
sooner or later find themselves unable
to compete with skillful hypnotists.
The prohibition laws say nothing
about hypnotism, and ginger ale may
be sold legally.

Novelties brought in too much doe.
