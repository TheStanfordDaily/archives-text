# CAMPUS OPINION
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Permit rae to express the following
opinion: Why does the Executive Com
mittee take it upon itself to foist upon
the students its idea of what a new
name for the "Daily Palo Alto" should
he? Only one name is submitted and
we are asked to vote upon it. Such a
meager choice has the taint of "take
it or leave it" about it.
The writer is in accord with any
fair plan to change the name of the
"Daily" since it is admittedly not as
strongly suggestive of Stanford as
might be, and must be confusive to
off-campus persons. It seems, however,
that we could make a more fortunate
choice than "The Daily Card," which
is suggestive of nothing in particular.
If a new name is to be adopted let
us take the step after fair considera
tion and some time to select a name
really representative of united student
opinion. Couldn't the "Daily" inau
gurate a short campaign for new
names, and then have the names sub
mitted by straw vote or regular elec
tion, or both, to a student vote? This
seems a more reasonable plan.
