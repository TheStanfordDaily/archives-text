# TRACK MEN OPEN WORK TO PREPARE FOR HARD SEASON
## Stanford Squad Loses Eight Point-Winners Through Graduation 
### Fred Swan 
Track men are beginning to turn
out in earnest for the grind of the
hard season that faces them. As the
track team shapes up at the present ;
time plenty of work and rebuilding
has to be done before the important
meets.
Stanford Is hard hit by graduation,
losing eight potential point-winners: ;
Hartranft, in the weights and the hun-'
died; Leistner, hurdles; Smith, 880'
and mile; Crookshank, broad jump; :
Evers, javelin; Campbell, 100 and 220;
Charles, two-mile; Dole, hurdles. Of
these men, Hartranft and Leistner
were the best point-gainers, and were
big factors in winning the Big Meet j
last year.
Weak in Sprints
Louis Caspar is the one remaining
veteran in the sprints. Besides the
diminutive runner Coach Templeton
plans to use Tom Work, Hoffman, and
Wilbur Adams. The possibility of a ■
strong combination in this event j
seems slight at the present time.
Miller and Storie look to be among
the winners in the 440. They are both
smart runners and when they are in
shape can do the distance under forty- j
nine seconds. As running mates for!
these men there will be Babcock, !
Doerr, Bordeif, and McGulre. Captain 1
Richardson will bear the brunt of the
work in the 880 and should clean up
In this event, although he will have
plenty of competition and must be in
his best form to win.
Hoffman Succeeds Hartranft
Biff Hoffman is the strong man in
the shot and discus this season, and
bids fair to follow in Tiny Hartranft's
footsteps. In practice the other night
he tossed the discus 134 feet from a |
standing throw; and put the shot forty-1
five feet. With Houser at U.S.C. and |
Gerkin at California, Hoffman will
have ample opportunity to demon
strate his ability. Richards, Weaver,;
Evans, and Wankowski are working j
on the weights and may come through j
in the course of the season.
In the high jump there is plenty of i i
taient. Tommy Work, Muhs, and King ■
can all do over six feet consistently,
and Bryant does around five feet ten.
Ted Shipkey looks to be the best in
the javelin and should hit his stride
this year. Harlow, Joaquin, and Stan
ley are coming along well and should
break into the point column.
Good Vaulters Scarce
Stanford looks weak in the pole;
vault, as Fontaine, Scofield, Carlsmith,
and Ross are of ordinary caliber. In
the broad jump the veteran Dick Mac- j
Rae is back and may be counted on
to finish among the leaders in the
meets. If Sid Meeks shows improve
ment over last year, he will give Mac- j

Rae a run for honors. Anderson of J
the freshmen will undoubtedly be
heard from, as he has possibilities.
Bill Kerr, the veteran in the mile
run, is working out daily and should
liave a better season than he did last
year. Ranney and Collins of last year's
frosh will attack the four-lap event
and show possibilities of coming
through.

Dds at Columbia University does not
smoke or use cosmetics.
