# RECITAL PROGRAM INCLUDES WORKS OF BEETHOVEN, HANDEL
## 
### Herbert Klein 
The Adagio from Beethoven's I
"Moonlight Sonata" will be played by |
Warren D. Allen, University organist, |
at his concert in the Memorial Church
next Sunday afternoon at 4 o'clock.
The sonata is one of the most often
played of the works of Beethoven
(1770-1872), who bridged the way be
tween the classicism of earlier musi
cians and the romantic school of j
music which followed. Beethoven did j
not give this work the name of "Moon-1
light Sonata," that title being attached
by popular fancy. The composer called
his sonata, of which the Adagio is the
second movement, "Sonata quasi una
fantasis" or "Sonata, partly a fantasy."
It was written for the piano but has
been adapted for the organ.
"Hymnus" by Rossetter G. Cole, an
American composer, will be the first
number on the program. Cole is one
of America's most gifted composers
for the organ, and his symphonic
works have met with wide recognition.
"Hymnus" is a song of consolation.
"Cappriccio in F Major" is a com
position of George Frederich Handel
and is arranged for the organ by Sig
frid Karg Elert. Handel (1685-1759)
has-been called "the German musician
who wrote Italian music in England."
Although he was born in the same
year and only a few miles away from
Bach, he was influenced by the melo
dious style of music prevalent in Italy
rather than the polyphonic German
style brought to its summit of perfec
tion by Bach.
The recital will close with "Toccata
and Fugue in D" by J. S. Bach. In the
fugue several melodies are interwoven
into a complex structure of sound of |
great depth and power.
