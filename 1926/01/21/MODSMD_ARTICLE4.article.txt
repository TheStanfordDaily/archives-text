# Masquers' Drama 'Fashion' Revived First In New York
## 
### 
"Fashion," Masquers' play to be pro
duced January 29, was first revived
in 1924 by the Provincetown Players
in New York. It opened at the Prov
incetown Playhouse, but soon moved
to the Greenwich Village Theatre in
order to accommodate larger audi
ences. After concluding a successful
season in New York, "Fashion" was
taken under the auspices of the Amer
ican Drama League to Chicago where
it also enjoyed a popular run.
Stanford is fortunate enough to
have the original manuscript used by
the Provincetown Players to aid in
the production of the play. A set of
photographs of settings and costumes,
as well as some old songs which were
found after much research on the part
of the Provincetown Players, have
also been sent to Gordon Davis, dra
matic coach and director of the play.
"Come, Birdie, Come," one of the
quaint songs which the producers
here have is otherwise practically im
possible to procure.
Audiences who witnessed "Fashion"
when it was revived fell into the spirit
of the times which the play repre
sents, and losing the reserve which
inhibits modern audiences, they ap
plauded the hero and hissed the vil
lain. Such demonstrations were con
sidered entirely proper displays of
feeling in the 40's when this comedy
was originally presented.
"The forerunner of the modern
American satirical comedy" is the
term used to characterize "Fashion"
by the Drama magazine.
Under the leadership of George
Cram Cook, formerly connected with
the Provincetown Players, this or
ganization sponsored many ambitious
performances, pioneering in various
plays which departed from the ortho
dox style.
