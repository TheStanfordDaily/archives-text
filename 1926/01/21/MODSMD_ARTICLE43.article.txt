### 
Ernie Nevers will return to the'
Pacific Coast within a week or ten
days, according to \V. Finlaw Geary,
Santa Rosa attorney, who accom
panied the former Card fullback on
the latter's trip East to play two pro
fessional games in Florida. Geary de
nied reports that Ngvers was to enter
the University of Wisconsin.
Red Grange and Nevers cannot be
compared as players, the attorney
said. Grange is an open field runner,
while Nevers is a line-plunger and a
defensive star. Geary stated that, al
though the Nevers-Grange.game failed
to attract a large crowd, it gave the
promoters what they wanted, adver
tisement for Florida.
Nevers, who is now in Superior,
Wisconsin, visiting with two brothers,
George C. Nevers and John S. Nevers,
will report for spring training to the
St. Louis baseball club March 1, Geary
said.
