# INDEPENDENTS WIN FROM ENCINA 3W IN SECOND ROUND
## Rough Playing Marks Games; Toro Defeats Phi Kaps, 14 to 10 
### Clif Moore 
Rough playing was the outstanding
feature of the second round of intra
mural basketball games staged yester
day in Encina gymnasium. The Inde
pendents defeated Encina 3W in the
best exhibition of the day, 19 to 7.
El Toro outfought Phi Kappa Sigma
in a close contest that ended 14 to 10
for the club team. Beta Theta Pi had
little difficulty beating Sequoia I by
a 22 to 7 count, and the Japanese Club
downed the Chinese Club 8 to 3, in
the last game on yesterday's schedule.
Delta Upsilon forfeited to Alpha Tau
Omega.
The Independents played a short
passing game that was effective in
working the ball down the floor on
numerous occasions which resulted in
baskets. Martin, Independent forward,
had a good day with the basket, mak
ing six field goals and two free throws
for a total of fourteen points. The
score at half time was 11 to 3. Doyle
played a good game at guard for the
freshmen, and seemed to be the only
man capable of stopping the winner's
offense.
The El Toro-Plii Kap battle was a
rough-and-tumble affair from start to
finish. The Phi Kaps played a much
.better game, on the whole, than did
El Toro, but seemed unable to hit the
basket when good passing had worked
the ball within scoring distance.
The Phi Kaps seemed to hold the
advantage in the first half, and ran up
a 9 to 3 score, due mainly to some
clever shooting by Rae. The El Toro
players came back with a stronger of
fense in the last period and ran up
eleven points to the Phi Kaps' one.
Clifford was responsible for the El
Toro victory, with seven points, all
made in the last half.
Beta Theta Pi ran rings around Se
quoia I, and had a rather easy time
scoring twenty-two points-to Sequoia's
seven. Mannoccir, Beta center, kept
up his high point-scoring with eleven
markers to his credit. Stimpson was
high for the losers with four points.
The Betas relied on a short passing
game to work the ball under the bas
ket, where Mannoccir was usually
waiting to tip it in. The winners dis
played a good defense, and the guard
ing of Montgomery and Tibbe was
responsible in keeping the Sequoia
score down.
The Chinese-Japanese'tussle was a
fast exhibition of dribbling and pass
ing, but neither team could locate the
basket. The Japanese displayed the
better teamwork, but showed a hesi
tancy in trying for the basket.
Endo, Japanese center, was the in
dividual star of the game, and was the
real leader of his team's playing. Endo
captured high point honors with six
of his team's eight points. Ilsieh was
the best player for the Chinese.
Following are tomorrow's games:
4:15 —Encina II vs. Theta Delta Chi.
4:50 —Sigma Chi vs. Branner 11.

made in the last half.
Beta Theta Pi ran rings around Se
quoia I, and had a rather easy time
scoring twenty-two points-to Sequoia's
seven. Mannoccir, Beta center, kept
up his high point-scoring with eleven
markers to his credit. Stimpson was
high for the losers with four points.
The Betas relied on a short passing
game to work the ball under the bas
ket, where Mannoccir was usually
waiting to tip it in. The winners dis
played a good defense, and the guard
ing of Montgomery and Tibbe was
responsible in keeping the Sequoia
score down.
The Chinese-Japanese'tussle was a
fast exhibition of dribbling and pass
ing, but neither team could locate the
basket. The Japanese displayed the
better teamwork, but showed a hesi
tancy in trying for the basket.
Endo, Japanese center, was the in
dividual star of the game, and was the
real leader of his team's playing. Endo
captured high point honors with six
of his team's eight points. Ilsieh was
the best player for the Chinese.
Following are tomorrow's games:
4:15 —Encina II vs. Theta Delta Chi.
4:50 —Sigma Chi vs. Branner 11.
Rough playing was the outstanding
feature of the second round of intra
mural basketball games staged yester
day in Encina gymnasium. The Inde
pendents defeated Encina 3W in the
best exhibition of the day, 19 to 7.
El Toro outfought Phi Kappa Sigma
in a close contest that ended 14 to 10
for the club team. Beta Theta Pi had
little difficulty beating Sequoia I by
a 22 to 7 count, and the Japanese Club
downed the Chinese Club 8 to 3, in
the last game on yesterday's schedule.
Delta Upsilon forfeited to Alpha Tau
Omega.
The Independents played a short
passing game that was effective in
working the ball down the floor on
numerous occasions which resulted in
baskets. Martin, Independent forward,
had a good day with the basket, mak
ing six field goals and two free throws
for a total of fourteen points. The
score at half time was 11 to 3. Doyle
played a good game at guard for the
freshmen, and seemed to be the only
man capable of stopping the winner's
offense.
The El Toro-Plii Kap battle was a
rough-and-tumble affair from start to
finish. The Phi Kaps played a much
.better game, on the whole, than did
El Toro, but seemed unable to hit the
basket when good passing had worked
the ball within scoring distance.
The Phi Kaps seemed to hold the
advantage in the first half, and ran up
a 9 to 3 score, due mainly to some
clever shooting by Rae. The El Toro
players came back with a stronger of
fense in the last period and ran up
eleven points to the Phi Kaps' one.
Clifford was responsible for the El
Toro victory, with seven points, all
made in the last half.
