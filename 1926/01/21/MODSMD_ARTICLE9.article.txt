## 
### 
Age and experience will vie with !
agility and youth on the Stanford dia
mond Friday afternoon when the!
alumni of Northern California meet l
the varsity baseball nine in their an
nual game and the first contest of the
season. The "old timers" may spring
a surprise and repeat th6ir victory of
last year when the varsity went down
to defeat by a 4 to 3 score. The game
will be called at 3 o'clock.
Coach Harry Wolter has announced
that he will not play for the alumni
this year as he has done in the past,
and Lefty Heckendorf, manager of
the alumni aggregation, will use Dave
Oliva at first base. With Newland,
Dave Brown, and Stan Hawkins play
ing in the outfield, the "grads" expect
to have some high-class fly-chasers.
Dink Templeton, varsity track
coach, will probably start on the
mound for the veterans and may give
the varsity sluggers plenty of trouble, j
Mush Stevens is slated to play at
shortstop, and Lefty Heckendorf will
be at third base for the alumni. The
veterans are looking for a steady
catcher, and a player to hold down
second is needed.
Coach Wolter has not announced
any line-up for the game and will prob
ably try outvseveral candidates for the
various positions. This will be the first
game of the season for the varsity and
should show up any glaring faults.
