# VARSITY GOLFERS MEET CALIFORNIA IN ANNUAL MATCH
## LANG WILL LEAD SQUAD Freshmen Tangle With U.C. Babes in Contests at Berkeley Course 
### 
Varsity and freshman golf teams
will meet the University of California
teams tomorrow at the Berkeley Coun
try Club in the annual golf matches.
Stanford is accorded a good chance to
win, according to Captain Dick Lang.
The strongest men on the California
varsity are John Talt and Lloyd
Thomas. Talt has played on his team
for three years and is considered one
of the best amateur golfers in the
state.
Captain Dick Lang was the only
Cardinal man to win his match last
year, and is expected to play some
fine golf in the contest tomorrow.
Eddie Meyberg was the star of last
year's freshman squad, and advanced
to the semi-finals in the Pacific Coast
Intercollegiate Golf tourney. Frank
Ditzler is playing his fourth year on
the varsity, and is showing great
steadiness. Bob Vermilya and Horace
Hindrey were on the freshman team
last year.
Wilson Veteran
Jim Wilson, another varsity veteran,
is showing the form which enabled
him, paired with Claude Wakefield, to
win the intramural championship for
Sigma Nu last year.
California is greatly weakened by
the loss of Lauren Upson, who is at
tending Tulane College. Upson was a
main cog in the outfit that defeated
the Cardinals last season. Talt and
Thomas are expected to give Lang and
Meyberg a hard battle in the two fea
ture matches. Six singles matches will
be played in the morning and three
doubles in the afternoon.
Play at Berkeley
The exact strength of the California
team is not known, but in recent years
it has beaten Stanford consistently.
As the matches will be played at the
Berkeley Country Club, home links of
the Bear team, the edge in familiarity
with the course goes to California.
In the freshman matches tomorrow,
Stanford hopes to add to her victories
over the Blue and Gold. Ward Ed
monds is a very brilliant golfer, as is
Bob Syer, champion of the San Jose
Country Club. Herbert Fleishacker is
as well known in golfing circles as he
is in shot-putting. Other freshman
players are Doug White, A1 Purkiss,
and Dick O'Brien.
