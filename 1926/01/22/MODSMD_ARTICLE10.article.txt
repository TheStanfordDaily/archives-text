# Intramural Fives Make Big Scores In Second Games
## 
### 
One-sided scores featured the games
played yesterday in the second round
of the annual intramural basketball
series. Phi Delta Theta, displaying
one of the smoothest working offenses
seen so far this season, ran up a 23
to 1 score against Sequoia 11. Delta
Chi won easily from Encina Basement,
14 to 1; Breakers defeated Encina IE
in a loosely played contest, 22 to 7;
and Theta Chi had little difficulty in
disposing of Encina 4E, 21 to 9. Kappa
Alpha and Zeta Psi both failed to show
up for their scheduled game.
The Phi Delt team played good bas
ketball against Sequoia 11, and suc
ceeded in making many baskets from
tip-off plays. • Snyde, Phi Delt center,
played his position in a capable man
ner, and was the real leader of his
team's offensive. He is credited with
seven baskets for a total of 14 points.
The winners had possesion of the
ball most of the time in the first half,
and would have undoubtedly run up a
much larger score if it hadn't been
for tough luck under the goal. Sequoia
was completely shut out in the first
period on the short end of a 7 to 0
score.
Delta Chi Wins
Delta Chi found an easy opponent in
Encina Basement, and encountered
little trouble in winning the game.
The fraternity team showed a glaring
inability to make close shots, however,
and were unable to run up a large
count because of many missed chances
under the goal. The first half was
ragged, and ended 5 to 0 for Delta
Chi.
The Row quintet showed a marked
improvement in the second period, and
played much faster basketball. Rowles,
Delta Clif running guard, got his eye
on the basket in this period, and sank
three field goals for high point honors.
The freshmen counted their one point
on a free throw by O'Sulliv^n.
Breakers Look Peculiar
The Breakers played a peculiar type
of game against Encina IW, on some
plays looking like real champions, and
on others seeming to have little
knowledge of the game. Their play
was inconsistent on the whole, but
was powerful enough to down the
freshmen. Most of the club's offensive
strength lay in Cook, who found the
basket for a total of nine points.
With the first half ending 12 to 4
for the Breakers, Encina started a
rally that looked promising, but poor
shooting at close range spoiled some
effective passnig work. Cook and Carl
smith worked especially well in the
second half and passed the ball around
j the freshman defense on numerous oc
| casions. Holt, Encina center, starred
with five points.
Good Teamwork
The Teta Chi-Encina 4E game pro
duced some very good teamwork 011
the part of the fraternity players,
j Sawyer, Green, and Richman formed
a smoothly working offensive combina
tion, and passed the ball under the
basket in a clever manner. Encina
played raggedly for the major part of
the game, and were unable to find the
! basket on easy shots.
The first half ended 11 to 4, and the
j same margin was maintained by Theta
j Chi for the remainder of the game.
I There was no outstanding point-scorer
lon the fraternity team, nearly every
j player counting for one or two bas
kets. Bowers was high for the fresh
men with four points.
