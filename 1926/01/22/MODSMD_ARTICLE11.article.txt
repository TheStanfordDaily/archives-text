# MUSICAL SCORE OF RAM'S HEAD SHOW TO HAVE CONTINUITY
## 
### Marietta Fry 
An important meeting of the
men's chorus has been called by
F. D. Mannoccir for Monday eve
ning, from 7 to 10 o'clock, in the
Old Union.
The music for this year's Ram's
Head Show promises to be unusually
good. It is satirical and light in char
acter and follows the movement of
the book throughout, giving an excel
lent opportunity for many variations.
John L. Wiggin is in charge of the
score for this performance.
A definite continuity, a thing which
has not been done before in a campus
production of this type, is preserved
throughout the show. A complete mu
sical score is planned instead of the
usual disconnected songs. Arthur Kay,
who compiled the music for "No, No,
Nannette," has been asked to arrange
the score.
The songs were written principally
by Jean Wakefield, Gordon Hall, Jr.,
John L. Wiggin, and Kenneth W. Hess,
all of whom wrote for the "Football
Gaieties" and are well known in this
line. A new idea is being used by in
corporating a few "sure-hits" from past
student shows that are too good to be
forgotten, into this year's score. The
opening number, written by Kenneth
Hess, appears several times during
the course of the show, establishing
the basic idea of the plot, ft ironical
and quite different from the usual
musical comedy song.
Wiggin is well qualified to direct
the musical side of the show. He has
written many songs for many past
campus productions and was musical
director for "The 1925 Football Gaie-j
ties." He has displayed a faculty for
grouping songs without resulting in
monotony.
