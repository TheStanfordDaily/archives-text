# OR. RAY LYMAN WILBUR COMPLETES TENTH YEAR AS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF UNIVERSITY
## President Predicts Growth in Equipment During Next Decade 
### Ruth Jordan 
That Stanford should continue to
i develop towards unity of its students
I and buildings in the next decade as it
has in the last few years, is the hope
i expressed by President Ray Lyman
j Wilbur in speaking of the future of
the University on the occasion of the
! tenth anniversary of his inauguration
; as president of Stanford.
"Each year finds the University
j better equipped to help those who
| wish to do advanced study and re
' search, the true field of a university,
j The increase in Stanford's enrollment
| in these last few years has been more
j and more in the upper division and
j graduate study. Students are coming
! to us better prepared to do advanced
; and more worth-while work," Dr. Wil
bur declared.
The educational system of the state
is tending toward a change from the
present system to that of combining
the first two years of the college and
the last two years of the high school
into the junior college, and starting
| the work of the University at what is
j now the third year. Stanford's system
lof limitation of the lower division
! works in with this plan, and the Uni
! versity will be able to take its place
as a university of advanced and gradu
ate work when this change of system
takes place.
Students Better Prepared
"Each year our students are coming
I better prepared to assimilate what we
j can give them," said President Wil
bur, "and more students are returning
; after graduation to take work leading
| to advanced degrees."
i Stanford is working towards having
graduate schools in the leading fields
i so that the University may better take
j its place among the universities of the
world. At the present time there are
j schools of medicine, law, engineering,
| education, and business at Stanford,
; and the addititon of a school of reli
gion would pjit us on a plane with
i other leading universities.
I An endowment is needed to estab
j lish a school of religion which would
' be conducted on the broadest plane
possible, in full keeping with the un
denominational attitude and freedom
of thought that is characteristic of
Stanford.
Building Approved
"The limitation of lower division
students, the increase in the number
J of the more distinguished scholars on
the faculty, the increased opportunity
offered to students going into higher
fields of research all point toward the
j growth of the University both in its
standard of student and its ranking in
the universities of the world,".Dr. Wil
bur said.
The building plans approved a few
! years ago will continue to be followed
during the next decade. More build
ings, better housing and classroom ac
j commodatioris, and a greater realiza
j tion and use of the unique position
