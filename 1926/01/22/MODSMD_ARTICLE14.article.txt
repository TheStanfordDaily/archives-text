# UNIVERSITY HAS GROWN STEADILY DURING DECADE

Steady campus improvements, in
| crease 'in enrollment, advances in re
l quirements and scholarship, creation
of new departments, reorganization of
undergraduate instruction, adoption of
| the honor system, installation of the
! four-quarter plan, and the launching
of the endowment campaign for Stan
ford are among the achievements
1 made during the last ten years that
Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur has been
president.
Growth of the University is evi
; denced not only by the increase in
enrollment which was little more than
2000' in 1916 and has now passed the
! 3000 mark, but by the addition of
! numerous buildings. Laying of the Art
j Gallery cornerstone in 1916 marked
j the beginning of the second quad-
I rangle. Another unit of the quadrangle j
j was added when the Library was com
' pleted a few years later. Following the
i completion of the new library the old
: library was remodelled into the pres
ent Administration building.
Church Completed
With the completion of the church
in 1916 the hall formerly known as
| the chapel was changed into what is
; now the Little Theatre with its stage
and equipment suitable for small
plays and lectures. Jordan Hall and
other buildings have undergone altera- \
i tions in order to increase the facilities
of the University; the postoffice has
been enlarged, and two large wings
i were added to the men's gymnasium. !
I
During the past ten years adequate
living halls have been provided
through alterations of buildings and
erection of new dormitories. The base
ment and attic of Encina were
J equipped to provide accommodations
for an additional hundred rooms. In
1918 Roble hall was completed for
women, and old Roble hall, now Se
quoia, was converted into a men's
living hall. Additional accommodations '
for men wile provided with the con- 1
struction of Toyon and Branner halls.
Installation of dining halls for men
is also a recent improvement.
A home for Dr. Jordan was built
within the last decade as was the
presidential house on the ridge above
Lagunita. Xasmln House, Dr. Jordan's
former home, is now in use as a hall i
for graduate women.
Hospital Improved
The Stanford Hospital In San Fran- i
! cisco and the Stanford School of Nurs-

I ing are other expansions of the Uni
: versity. Improvements in the hospital
have been made from year to year.
; The Hopkins Marine Station at Pacific
Grove and the aeronautical experi
mental laboratory have been completed
within the last ten years. The Stan
ford Home for Convalescent Children
was erected in 1920 in that portion of
the former Stanford residence which
is still standing, and has been in
; creased by the Kate D. Laughlin unit.
J The Stanford Union is a recent addi
tion made possible through an anony
mous contribution of $100,000.
Athletic facilities were improved by
; the completion of the stadium in 1921
: and the basketball pavilion a year
later.
Worthy of particular note in the last
j decade is the acquisition of the Hoover
i War Library with which only one
other library of its kind in the world
! can compare. This is a government
collection in France.
Attitude Changes
One of the significant parts of Stan
| ford's history within the past ten
years is the change which has taken
place in the public attitude toward
the institution. Before the last decade,
Stanford, in the estimation of the
, public, was a wealthy, privately-en
dowed college. However, the public
! now views Stanford as a great nation
al institution needing and meriting
support outside its own people and
the Stanford family. Previous to
President Wilbur's inauguration, Stan
ford, except for the Cooper Medical
College, had received no gifts increas
ing its endowment resources from any
one outside the immediate Stanford
family. In order to meet urgent finan
cial needs to provide more adequate
salaries, more buildings, and expan
sion in the Medical School and Stan
ford Hospitals, a campaign was
launched in 1921-22 to s'ecure outside
gifts.
But beginning with 1921-22 substan
tial gifts.have added to Stanford's re
sources. A gift from the Carnegie cor
poration amounted to $700,000, and one
from the Education Board amounted
to $300,000 as part of $1,000,000 to be
raised for the purpose of increasing
salaries of professors. Gifts have been
received from business men of the
Mate for the Graduate School of Busi
ness. Donations of various big elec
trical manufacturing and power com-
panies have made possible the Ryan
Laboratory, which is now under con
struction.
Standards Raised
Scholarship requirements not only
for admission but for remaining in the
University have been steadily raised.
Revision in entrance requirements
makes it necessary for every appli
cant to present fifteen recommending
units. In 1924 intelligence tests became
a supplementary entrance require
ment.
With the increase in scholarship re
quirements has come a gradual lessen
ing of restrictions upon students of
ability. The legislation making stu
dents on probation ineligible to par
ticipate in student activities was re
pealed. At the same time a rule was
passed to the effect that a student
who reaches a B average may carry
as many units as he wishes. The pres
ent Independent Study Plan put into
effect this quarter is a further evi
dence of the lessening of limitations.
An earlier indication of placing re
sponsibility upon students was the
adoption of the Honor System in ex
aminations in 1921 following the re
quest of some 1700 students, each of
whom signed an individual card ask
ing that the Honor System be in
stalled.
Important changes in the depart
ments have taken place, and signifi
cant development has been made in
the graduate schools including the
Graduate School of Business, School
of Mining and Metallurgy, and the
Law School, all of which were put on
a graduate basis within the last de
cade.
Instruction Reorganized
Reorganization of the undergraduate
instruction in the University is char
acterized as the most important edu
cational advance of the year 1920. The
present system which is the one
adopted at that time, replaced the for
mer major department system for the
first two years which had been in
effect previous to 1920.
The present four-quarter plan is an
innovation which went into effect with
the beginning of the academic year
1917-18.
