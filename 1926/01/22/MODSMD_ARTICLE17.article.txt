# Needed—A New Name
## 
### 
It was suggested in a communication to the Campus Opinion depart
ment yesterday that student opinion be canvassed and a straw vote taken
to determine the most suitable name with which to replace The Daily
Palo Alto. This letter was written as a protest to the action of the
Executive Committee in recommending that "The Stanford Card" he sub
mitted to the students at the general election in February as a suitable title.
The Daily Palo Alto feels that its editors and managers should have
the right of selecting the name to be presented to the student body at the
next election, if one is to be presented at all. It has been thought ad
visable to change the name of the paper because Daily Palo Alto is so
frequently confused with Daily Palo Alto Times.
News items and mail of all sorts —both business and editorial —ad-
dressed to one paper is constantly being received by the other. State
ments and advertising matter are being missent, causing both trouble and
expense to the parties concerned. This difficulty could be easily overcome
by changing the name of the Daily Palo Alto, and at the same time a
name connecting the paper with Stanford could be secured.
To an outsider "Palo Alto" means nothing. If "Stanford" was in
the masthead the daily would have far more power as a publicity agent.
For these two reasons, we feel that "The Stanford Daily News" or " 1 he
Daily Stanford" would be the most appropriate names if there is to be a
change.
The word "daily" must be used, because it lends prestige to a college
paper, since so many of them do not appear every day; "Stanford" is
necessary to connect the paper with the university to the casual reader;
and "news" is of valife because it clearly indicates the type and purpose
of the paper. The name already suggested, "Card" means nothing to an
outsider —it might just as well be a racing card, a baseball score card, or
even a playing card.
