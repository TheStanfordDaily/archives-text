# A 						Decade of Progress
## 
### 
Ten years ago today Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur was formally installed
as president of the University from which he had graduated just twenty
years previously. Dr. Wilbur had seen Stanford grow from its compara
tively humble beginnings; he had kept closely in contact with it; so, when
he stepped into office, he was fully prepared to guide its destinies.
A young president and a young university might have seemed to be a
bad,combination; but the last decade has shown that the fears were en
tirely unwarranted. President Wilbur has faithfully carried on the ad
ministration—constantly improving, but never revolutionizing.
Dr. Wilbur has helped to secure large sums by gifts for Stanford.
With this money, and with funds arising from the payment of tuition
by the students, he has been able to increase the size of the university, to
provide better facilities for studies, and better living accommodations for
students. He has placed Stanford among the leaders scholastically, with
out discouraging athletics or recreation, and he has kept pace with the
most progressive trend in education.
We say President Wilbur has done all this, which is an exaggeration.
The conduct of the University is in the hands of the Board of Trustees
on one hand and the faculty on the other; but both rely on the president
for suggestions and guidance. So, it is fair enough to give the President
praise for the progress that has been made th<? past ten years.
