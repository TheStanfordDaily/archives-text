# FRESHMAN QUINTET TO MEET STOCKTON TOMORROW NIGHT
## 
### Cliff McDowell 
Coach Husky Hunt's freshman cag
Â«rs will receive their final test Sat
urday night when they meet the Stock
ton High School quintet in the pre
liminary to the U.S.C. game. Stockton
held the state championship last year
and will give the frosh their hardest
game until the California series.
The teamwork of the frosh has been
constantly improving and Husky is
well satisfied with the progress they
have shown. The team is fast, aggres
sive, and can shoot well. Offensively
they are stronger than any freshman
team in the last few years.
Marks, who was out of the last
game with a sprained ankle, is fast
rounding into shape and is expected
to he ready for the California games.
The rest of the team is in fine condi
tion, with the exception of Worden,
who received a few bruises in the
game Wednesday night. Crary seems
to have come out of his slump and is
playing much better than in the early
part of the season. McCandless has
played top-notch basketball during the
entire practice season and should star
in the Stockton and California con
tests.
In commenting on the team yester
day Hunt said, "The spirit of the team
is excellent and I feel confident they
will give a good account of themselves
in their final test."
The tentative starting lineup is
Crary and Sexson forwards; Lewis
and Worden, guards; McCandless,
center.
The game will start at 7 o'clock.
