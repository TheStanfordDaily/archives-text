# SPORTS OF 1926
## Mayor and Champion 
### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
There have been many famous Walkers in history—
from sleep-walkers to jay-walkers—but right now the two
most famous are His Honor James J. Walker, Mayor of
New York City, and Mickey Walker, welterweight champion
of the world. Cyril Walker is still a prominent contender
for golfing honors, hut he lost his national open golf title
last summer at Worcester, and Prank Walker, baseball's
champion business man, who sold himself to the New York
Giants over a year ago, has passed out of the majors.
Willie Plant and Ugo Prigerio, champion Walkers, added a
lot to the 1925 track season, but there was no International
golf competition' during last year for the Walker cup,
donated by George Herbert Walker.
But, to get back to the two most prominent of the
Walker clan, Mickey has prospered and become famous
under the state boxing law fathered by Jimmy, who put it

through when in the state senate. Without that law, there would be no
boxing in New York state, and, although Mickey has, at times, been in bad
with the worthy commission that rules the "cauliflower industry" in the
metropolis and its environs, the law fostered by Jimmy has been a good one
and Mickey has been a good champion.
'I is the day that Walker, the lighter, was to have battled Tommy
Milligan, European champion; but, for reasons of its own, the New York
pf"te boxing commission wiped the fight off the slate about two weeks ago.
You can imagine Walker (Mickey) complaining to Walker (Jimmy) that "It.
ain't fair—we Walkers should hang together."
"Yes," according to a Hylan man opposed to prize-fighting, "they should!"
