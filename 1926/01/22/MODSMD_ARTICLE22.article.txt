# CABBAGES and THINGS
## KNICKERBOCKER'S DIARY 
### Monroe Eaton 
Saturday—Went to the Glee Club
Novelties last night. Took that swell
dame from Palo Alto. Her father runs
a varnish and hair, tonic store. Got all
varnished up when I took her home.
Head feels kind of funny today; think
one of those paper aeroplanes some
body threw at the show must have
had a rock in it.
Sunday—Went to the basketball
game last night. Think the score
keeper must be used to chalking up
football scores. Wonder where the
O.C. got those trick baskets.
Monday—Spent a quiet Sunday.
Practiced that new step of the
Charleston where the girl hangs by
her heels from your neck. Took a flat
tire out riding and got three more.
Came home and went to see a "Cinder
Kiss for Ella." Don't see what the
cinders have got to do with it.
Tuesday—Slept through my eight,
nine, and ten o'clock classes this morn
ing. Didn't have any eleven o'clock
class today so slept through it too.
Just found out that the girl I took out
last Sunday was married. Hurrah! Saw
something in the Dippy tonight about
sour dough in the Glee Club. Well, if
they must fight amongst themselves,
why let them.
Wednesday—Got chased by a speed
cop this afternoon out Palm Drive and
all around the president's house. Fin
ally fooled him by driving into the
garage and then backing out as he
went by. Heard a guy telling today
about how he was a bear at necking.
Well, if he is a bear, I'm a giraffe.
Thursday—Took out the varnish
man's daughter again last night. Don't
like her line so well. Too much of a
clothes line.

We see that ballplayers must have
good tonsils and teeth.
We might add that people who have
false teeth should never attempt to
do the Charleston.

There will be chaperones at the dance.
