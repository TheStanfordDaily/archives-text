# CLARK ASKS SOCCER PLAYERS TO ATTEND SPRING PRACTICE
## 
### 
Spring soccer practice will be held
for the next four weeks, according to
Don Clark, who is in charge of soccer
during the absence of Harry Maloney.
Clark requests all men interested in
this sport to attend practice, as several
vacancies will be left open in the
Cardinal squad through graduation.
New men wishing to learn the game
are also urged to report.
Jack Franklin, captain of the squad,
and Miles Gray, Dave Clark, Carlos
Miron, Scot Quigle, and Arthur Schoen
will all be missing from the Stanford
team next year, while Smith, who
broke his leg in the California game,
is still unable to attend practice.
The election for captain of next
year's team, and the presentation of a
medal to the man considered the most
valuable player on the squad will take
place at a dinner for the team later
this quarter.
Close competition should mark the
interclass soccer contests which will
be held during the first two weeks of
the spring quarter. Last year the 1925
team took honors, while the freshmen,
junior, and sophomore squads were in
a triple tie for second place.
