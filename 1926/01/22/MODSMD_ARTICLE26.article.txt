UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA,
Jan. 21. —"Intellectual training is a
lifelong process," says Professor Leon
J. Richardson of the University of
California, in an article in the Spokes
man, monthly magazine of the Exten
sion division of the university. He
points out that unless one continues
his education, that which he already
has will deteriorate.
"Laziness and ignorance produce the
'stand-patter'," Professor Richardson
continues. "The man who keeps him
self intellectually alive is the progres
sive in the domain of the mind. *
"The quaint custom of framing "col
lege diplomas and hanging them on
the walls seems to be disappearing, as
it is realized that the end of college
is not the end of one's education.
