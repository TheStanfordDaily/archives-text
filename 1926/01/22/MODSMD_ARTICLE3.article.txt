# HIP FLASK OFFERED AS TROPHY IN QUAD VERSE COMPETITION
## 
### 
The poet in Bohemian New
York, inspiring and perspiring to
produce a verse that will bring
him fame —or more immediately
—a meal.
Presto! The scene shifts to a
Stanford living group. A would
be artist pecking at a dilapidated
typewriter, wearing his fingers
to the bone, praying that his
verse will find favor with the
Quad editors so that he may be
enriched by a beautifully en
graved shaving mug, or a silver
hip-pocket flask (unfilled).
The list of prizes for the Quad
verse contest which has just
started and which will run in
definitely, is as follows: first
prize, a silver flask; second prize,
a dinner at Tait's on the beach
with a member of the opposite
sex; third prize, a porcelain shav
ing mug. Contributions should be
mailed to Box 100, . Poetry Editor.
