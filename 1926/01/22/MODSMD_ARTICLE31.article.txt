## "Dodson's Hints on Musical Hits" 
### 
All Stanfordites will be interested
to learn that the Stanford Band has
been invited to record for the Victor.
The invitation came as the result of
a suggestion by this firm to Richard
Taylor, band manager. Taylor has re
ceived a letter from Camden, New
Jersey, Victor headquarters, stating
that several trial records will be ar
ranged for when the next recording
organization comes West.

New Victor records, on sale today,
include some mighty fine popular num
bers.
Waring's Pennsylvanians contribute
"Thanks for the Buggy Ride" and
"I've Got Some Lovin' To Do." The
former sets forth, in the Pennsyl
vanians' best dance music and vocal
choruses, the no uncertain advantages
of an old-fashioned buggy over the
modern automobile.
"I've Got Some Lovin' To Do," not
to be confused with "Want a Little
Lovin'," is in much the same manner
with several rather frank vocal chor
uses â€”one by a single voice that's
funny for its own sake. Both numbers
are fine for the Charleston or what
have you.
George Olsen's Orchestra, whose re
cent recordings have been quite the
vogue, offers "Fond of You" and
"Journey's End." They only average
as Olsen records go, but that makes
them considerably above the general
run.
Paul Whiteman records "I Wonder
Where My Baby Is Tonight" and "Lo-
Nah" as his first phonograph appear
ance in some time. Typical Whiteman
records, these, with detailed precision
of orchestration and playing not found
in many contemporary organizations.
