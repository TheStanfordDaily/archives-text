# ORCHESTRA PROGRAM WILL BE EXPLAINED BY V. LICHTENSTEIN
## 
### Herb Klein 
Victor Liclitenstein, a foremost au
thority on music, will lecture next
Monday evening at 8 o'clock on the
structure of the symphony orchestra
and the program of the San Francisco
Symphony at its concert next Tuesday
evening. The talk has been arranged
by the Committee on Public Exercises
in connection with the Symphony's
recital and is a new feature this year.
The lecture is open to everyone, re
gardless of whether or not they have
tickets for the concert.
The classes and arrangements of
instruments that go to make up the
modern orchestra is one of the most
interesting subjects in modern music
and is necessary information for any
one who seeks to derive the fullest
enjoyment from orchestra concerts.
Liclitenstein has had actual experience
in orchestra work, being a member of
the first violin section of the San
Francisco Orchestra under Alfred
Hertz.
The major portion of his talk will
be devoted to an analysis of the three
works on the orchestra program Tues
day night. These are the "New World"
symphony by Dvorak, "The Afternoon
of a Faun" by Debussy, and "Violin
Concerto" by Tchaikowsky. By giving
the historical background and the
meaning of each work, Liclitenstein
will enable his audience to appreciate
the program the next night to a
greater extent. The individual themes
or "tunes" out of which the music is
built will be separately played and
discussed so that tliey may be recog
nized and appreciated when played by
the orchestra.
The "New World" symphony, a work
of four movements, will be analyzed
with illustrations of the native Indian
and negro themes which have given
the work its distinctive character of
the only great symphonic work from
native American sources. In doing so
Mr. Lichtenstein will explain the sym
phony form which has become the ac
cepted pattern for the world's great
music.
The lecturer has a comprehensive
musical background and an intimate
acquaintance with his subject. His ex
perience includes years of study
abroad and work under some famous
European conductors. He has played
violin iu orchestras directed by Eu
gene Ysaye and Arthur Nikisch. He
lias been a member of the San Fran
cisco Symphony Orchestra since 1921
and since that time has given courses
of lectures in San Francisco of the
symphony orchestra and the opera
which have enjoyed great popularity
under the name of "symphonylogues"
and "operalogues."
