# RED GRANGE PLAYS IN SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY AFTERNOON
## Tigers Are Headed by Wilson And Bailey; Are Called Best Coast Team 
### 
Red Grange and his Chicago Bears
will oppose the San Francisco Tigers,
headed by Buck Bailey and George
Wilson, Sunday afternoon at 2 o'clock
in the Kezar Stadium in San Fran
cisco. Bailey and Wilson are the best
linesman and backfield man, respec
tively, on the Pacific Coast, and have
gathered around them a team that will
give the Bears a tough struggle. Coach
Babe Hollingberry of the Olympic Club
stated: "Gee, wouldn't it be great to
have a dream and have it come true
when I wake up and find I had that
backfield and line presented to me
for the season."
The Bears have been at Cloverdale
at the ranch of Red's manager, C. C.
Pyle, for a couple of days' rest before
the game. Grange received a well
earned rest away from the crowds that
follow every move he makes, and the
countless number of interviews and
speeches he is obliged to make.
The Wheaton ice man stated that he
had a great deal of respect for the San
Francisco team and that from all of
the reports he had heard and what he
had seen of the several players who
are to play against him Sunday, the
Chicago Bears are in for the hardest
game of the tour. Red also gave out a
bit of information that George Wilson
was the greatest halfback he had ever
seen in college or since he has been
playing the professional game.
In the line of the Tigers, George
Baker, former Cardinal varsity center,
will be in his position, with Buck
Bailey and Stew Beam holding down
the guard positions. Harry Shipkey
and Percy Locey will play tackles, and
undoubtedly cause the "Phantom
Ghost" a lot of trouble. Dick Redd,
former Oregon captain, and Bob
Brown, of the Olympic Club, will be
on the wings. Don Newmeyer and Joe
Lidderdale, as well as Dewey Lyle,
who played for the Rock Island pro
fessional team, complete the linemen.
The starting backfield will be com
posed of Wilson, Fitzke, Kincaid, and
Stockton. Ilollingberry stated that this
backfield is the best combination that
had ever been assembled on the Pa
cific Coast. Rabbit Bradshaw, Jimmy
Blewett, and Red Dungan are also on
the team and will be ready to go into
the game when needed.
