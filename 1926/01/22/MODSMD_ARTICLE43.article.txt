# AMERICAN TOWNS BETTER THAN THOSE OF EUROPE-JORDAN
## 
### 
America is not one gigantic gopher
prairie, as some of our foreign critics
make out, nor are the typical "Main
Street" towns â€¢of the Middle West
such bad places after all. This was
the central theme followed by David
Starr Jordan in his regular Thursday
evening conference held at his home
last night.
Basing his talk on the experiences
and impressions received in his many
travels throughout the world, Dr.
Jordan compared the conditions exist
ing in the small country towns in the
American states with those found in
smilar places in various foreign coun
tries. In almost every case, the con
clusion reached was much in favor of
American "Main Streets."
Dr. Jordan found the average man
in the Continental small towns much
more stupid than his counterpart in
the villages in this country. In many
cases this is the fault of a government
which does not give the lower classes
an opportunity for education. Schools
anywhere in Europe do not compare
with those in California, further de
clared Dr. Jordan. One of the outstand
ing things in favor of the American
sytem is that it tries to educate every
body; a state of affairs that is sadly
reversed abroad.
