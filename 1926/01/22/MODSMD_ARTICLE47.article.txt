You can't put anything over on Mother
when it comes to buying the eats for
the family. Ask your Mother, Miss
Sorority and Mr. Fraternity, where
she would buy her meats if she came
to Palo Alto to live. And why do we
get the majority of the mothers that
come to the campus during the sum
mer vacation for customers? Because
we sell only one grade of meat, and
that the very best. There is a big dif
ference in the cost of Cow Beef and
fancy Steer Beef. We buy only the
highest grade of Steer Beef. So it is
with all the other meats we buy. We
handle one grade only all the time.
Many of the founders of Stanford Uni
versity bought meat from us when
Stanford was young and are still our
satisfied customers. If you are not a
customer now we invite you to be
come one; we will appreciate your
monthly account, and you will like
our quality and our service.
