# CARDS GIVEN EVEN BREAK WITH U.S.C. IN SERIES OPENER
## KEN BOYER TROJAN ACE Southern Quintet Doped to Provide Hard Battle For Kerr's Team 
### Jim Adams 
In the first conference game of the
I season the Stanford basketball team
I will match skill with the U.S.C. five
jat 8 o'clock tomorrow night in the
j pavilion. Before the Olympic Club up
j set the Cards would have been favored

to win from the
Trojans but on ac
count of their poor
showing on that
occasion, and with
Nelson David out
of the game they
are placed upon
about even terms

j with the latter.
The Trojans' stock fell when Cali
fornia handed them a couple of de
feats last week at Berkeley. With the
l exception of a drubbing they took
j from the Utah Aggies the U.S.C. team,
! nevertheless, made a good showing
j against all its opponents in South
j ern California.
Boyer Star Forward
The Southerners have built their
team around their star forward, Cap
tain Kenny Boyer, who has been

J labeled by someone
|as All-American.
This young man is
| a demon shot, a
speedy dribbler,
and a first-class
floor man. He is
j the scoring part of
i the trojan offense.

A team with a dead-eye shot like
I
j Boyer on it is bound to be dangerous.
! If he is not closely guarded he is a
j threat every time he has the ball
j within shooting range. If a guard is
placed on him it draws attention
away from the other players, who are
given better opportunity to sink a few
j themselves. Although the rest of the
: Trojan team are not up to the stand
ard of Boyer they are, nevertheless,
! average basketball players, and that
is enough to keep the Cards on their
| toes.
Man in the Hole
Stanford may play a man in the
hole if the work Kerr has put his men
through the last few practices means
1 anything. Clark, who will take David's
place at forward, has been used in
| this formation.
| If the Cards can get together and
play the basketball of which they are
' capable, they ought to send the Tro
jans home defeated. What they learned
in the Olympic Club game should pre
! vent them from going up in the air if
Boyer gets loose and starts sinking
I them.
Captain Price is due for a good
night. He has participated in only two
| light practices in order to remedy the
; staleness which has marked his play
i ing so far. With the exception of Clark
in David's place, the line-up will be
the same with Price, Jayred, Mitchell,
1 and Anderson starting the game.
