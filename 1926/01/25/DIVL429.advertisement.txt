PALO ALTO BEAUTY SALON
j j The Smart Wave j
Expresses Personality
In deciding on the wave of best becom
ingness the smart decision takes into
consideration contour of line and type
of hair cut. At the moment the Marcel is
distinguished by its wide, natural effect
rather than a "set" look. For those who
have permanent waves or naturally curly
hair the Finger Wave perfects the out
line of the head. And the Paper Curl—
most lasting of tong waves—gives the
effect of greater luxuriance to the hair.
The result in becomingness is entirely in the
hands of the operator, whose skill is the
deciding factor of smart effect
