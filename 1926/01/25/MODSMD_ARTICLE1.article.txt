# TICKET SALE FOR MASQUERS' DRAMA OPENS TOMORROW
## MANY STARS HAVE PARTS Play Suitable Because of Opportunity for Large Female Cast 
### Isabel Schanck 
The seat sale for "Fashion," Mas
quers' play to be produced Friday eve
ning in the Assembly hall at 8:15
o'clock, will open tomorrow at 1
o'clock in the afternoon at the new
ticket offices In the Old Union. The
popular prices of fifty cents and one
dollar will prevail.
Aided and abetted by three titles—
"Fashion," "Life in New York," and
"Gertrude the Governess," this popu
lar comedy of the '40's is particularly
suitable for production by Masquers
Society because it affords parts for so
many women. The cast includes sev
oral of the most experienced actresses
on the campus. Last year's Masquers'
play, "You and I," had only one of
the society's members in it.
Many Stars
Marjorie Allen, Aileene Burks,
Peggy Randall, and Patrice Nauman
are all well known to Stanford play
goers by reason of their active partici
pation in dramatics during the past
i'ew years. Miss Allen's last role was
that of Margaret in "Dear Brutus,"
Barrie's fantastic comedy presented
last quarter. In the part of Polly in
-"Polly with a Past," Miss Burks is re
membered for her excellent charac
terization in the 1925 Senior Farce.
Miss Randall made her debut in
campus dramatics with the production
of "Dulcy," the 1927 sophomore play,
.and also took part in "Ace High," the
Junior Opera of last spring, as well
as in "The Goose Hangs High," pre
sented hero last fall. The change in
the fashions of the leading lady in
her new role will be evident. As Ger
trude, Miss Randall has what would
be the ingenue nowadays, but the old
fashioned stage ideal of eighty years
