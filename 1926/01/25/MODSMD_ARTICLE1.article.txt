## MANY STARS HAVE PARTS Play Suitable Because of Opportunity for Large Female Cast 
### Isabel Schanck 
The seat sale for "Fashion," Mas
quers' play to be produced Friday eve
ning in the Assembly hall at 8:15
o'clock, will open tomorrow at 1
o'clock in the afternoon at the new
ticket offices In the Old Union. The
popular prices of fifty cents and one
dollar will prevail.
Aided and abetted by three titles—
"Fashion," "Life in New York," and
"Gertrude the Governess," this popu
lar comedy of the '40's is particularly
suitable for production by Masquers
Society because it affords parts for so
many women. The cast includes sev
oral of the most experienced actresses
on the campus. Last year's Masquers'
play, "You and I," had only one of
the society's members in it.
Many Stars
Marjorie Allen, Aileene Burks,
Peggy Randall, and Patrice Nauman
are all well known to Stanford play
goers by reason of their active partici
pation in dramatics during the past
i'ew years. Miss Allen's last role was
that of Margaret in "Dear Brutus,"
Barrie's fantastic comedy presented
last quarter. In the part of Polly in
-"Polly with a Past," Miss Burks is re
membered for her excellent charac
terization in the 1925 Senior Farce.
Miss Randall made her debut in
campus dramatics with the production
of "Dulcy," the 1927 sophomore play,
.and also took part in "Ace High," the
Junior Opera of last spring, as well
as in "The Goose Hangs High," pre
sented hero last fall. The change in
the fashions of the leading lady in
her new role will be evident. As Ger
trude, Miss Randall has what would
be the ingenue nowadays, but the old
fashioned stage ideal of eighty years
ago was of an older woman with more !
experience and knowledge of life than
is now considered the forte of the
ingenue. The part will also give Miss
Randall opportunities to display the
charming aptitude for comedy which
has been one of her outstanding char
acteristics as an actress.
Miss Naumann Has Role
Mrs. Tiffany will be played by Miss
Nauman. In "Ace High," the 1926 Jun
ior Opera, and as Lady Mac Duff in
"Macbeth" last year she further
strengthened her reputation by her
interpretation of character parts. Mrs.
Tiffany is similar to the famous Mrs.
Malaprop of Sheridan's "The Rivals,"
and has many very amusing lines to
add to the humor of the situations
which are in themselves intensely
funny.
Most of the men who take part in
"Fashion" are new to Stanford dra
matics. Fenton Barrett and Cecil Doll,

however, are both actors who are
familiar to the campus. Doll had the
role of the chief of police in the sopho
more play "In the Next Room," and
will appear as Adam Trueman, the
fearless, honest, and serious-minded
farmer who exposes to the public gaze
the wicked sophistication of New York
life.
Barrett in Lead
Barrett has the good fortune to be
very well cast as Colonel Howard, the
juvenile lead. A great deal of subtlety
is necessary for the modern actor to
pose successfully in the attitudes of
the old-fashioned matinee idol. Barrett
achieves the effect that such a role
should create with an easy grace. Evi
dence of changing fashions is notice
able in this type of part also, for it is
one rarely seen on the stage nowadays.
Under the direction of Gordon
Davis, dramatic coach, with Leslie
Kiler superintending the technical
changes, "Fashion" is daily becoming
more and more a quaint and altogether
delightful comedy.

Upperclass women at the University
of California, Southern Branch, have
been selected by the Women's Athletic
Association to coach freshman and
sophmore basketball teams.

Miss Randall made her debut in
campus dramatics with the production
of "Dulcy," the 1927 sophomore play,
.and also took part in "Ace High," the
Junior Opera of last spring, as well
as in "The Goose Hangs High," pre
sented hero last fall. The change in
the fashions of the leading lady in
her new role will be evident. As Ger
trude, Miss Randall has what would
be the ingenue nowadays, but the old
fashioned stage ideal of eighty years
ago was of an older woman with more !
experience and knowledge of life than
is now considered the forte of the
ingenue. The part will also give Miss
Randall opportunities to display the
charming aptitude for comedy which
has been one of her outstanding char
acteristics as an actress.
Miss Naumann Has Role
Mrs. Tiffany will be played by Miss
Nauman. In "Ace High," the 1926 Jun
ior Opera, and as Lady Mac Duff in
"Macbeth" last year she further
strengthened her reputation by her
interpretation of character parts. Mrs.
Tiffany is similar to the famous Mrs.
Malaprop of Sheridan's "The Rivals,"
and has many very amusing lines to
add to the humor of the situations
which are in themselves intensely
funny.
Most of the men who take part in
"Fashion" are new to Stanford dra
matics. Fenton Barrett and Cecil Doll,

however, are both actors who are
familiar to the campus. Doll had the
role of the chief of police in the sopho
more play "In the Next Room," and
will appear as Adam Trueman, the
fearless, honest, and serious-minded
farmer who exposes to the public gaze
the wicked sophistication of New York
life.
Barrett in Lead
Barrett has the good fortune to be
very well cast as Colonel Howard, the
juvenile lead. A great deal of subtlety
is necessary for the modern actor to
pose successfully in the attitudes of
the old-fashioned matinee idol. Barrett
achieves the effect that such a role
should create with an easy grace. Evi
dence of changing fashions is notice
able in this type of part also, for it is
one rarely seen on the stage nowadays.
Under the direction of Gordon
Davis, dramatic coach, with Leslie
Kiler superintending the technical
changes, "Fashion" is daily becoming
more and more a quaint and altogether
delightful comedy.

Upperclass women at the University
of California, Southern Branch, have
been selected by the Women's Athletic
Association to coach freshman and
sophmore basketball teams.
The seat sale for "Fashion," Mas
quers' play to be produced Friday eve
ning in the Assembly hall at 8:15
o'clock, will open tomorrow at 1
o'clock in the afternoon at the new
ticket offices In the Old Union. The
popular prices of fifty cents and one
dollar will prevail.
Aided and abetted by three titles—
"Fashion," "Life in New York," and
"Gertrude the Governess," this popu
lar comedy of the '40's is particularly
suitable for production by Masquers
Society because it affords parts for so
many women. The cast includes sev
oral of the most experienced actresses
on the campus. Last year's Masquers'
play, "You and I," had only one of
the society's members in it.
Many Stars
Marjorie Allen, Aileene Burks,
Peggy Randall, and Patrice Nauman
are all well known to Stanford play
goers by reason of their active partici
pation in dramatics during the past
i'ew years. Miss Allen's last role was
that of Margaret in "Dear Brutus,"
Barrie's fantastic comedy presented
last quarter. In the part of Polly in
-"Polly with a Past," Miss Burks is re
membered for her excellent charac
terization in the 1925 Senior Farce.
