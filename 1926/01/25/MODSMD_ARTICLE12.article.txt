# THETA DELTA CHI LOSES TO ENCINA IN RAGGED GAME
## Second Round of Intramural Basketball Completed; Branner Forfeits 
### 
Encina 2W nosed out the Theta
Delta Chi team in the only intramural
basketball game played Friday by the
score of 3 to 2 after a ragged exhibi
tion of the game. Branner II forfeited
the other scheduled tilt to the Sigma
Chi team.
The freshman team had a slight ad
vantage in play during most of the
first half, keeping the ball under their
opponents' goal a great part of the
time, but all their attempts at field
goals went wild with the exception of
two which were not allowed. Cook,
Encina center, made the only point of
the half in the last minute of play with
a foul goal.
The Theta Delt team went into the
lead early in the first half with their
only field goal of the game. With the
aid of snappy passing by Cook, who
played the best floor game for the
freshmen, Hill put Encina back in
the lead with a clever shot. The rest
of the last half was fruitless as far as
points were concerned.
This week in the intramural tourna
ment will further limit the number
ol teams left in the running for the
tourney championship. In the games
for today in League V there will prob
ably be no change in the leaders.
