while his voice is both forceful and j
pleasing. Crocker was a member of |
the team to debate Oregon in his J
sophomore year, and together with
William L. Gosslin, debated the South
ern Branch and Pomona last spring
vacation. He also was a member of
the team to debate California last
quarter.
Baer Second Debater
Baer, the second Stanford speaker,
employs a more informal style of de
bate, being in direct contrast to that
oZ his colleague. In addition to suc
ceeding Robert Littler as debating
manager, he has represented Stanford
on the freshman team of two years
ago, and against the Kansas Agricul
tural College in their debate with
Stanford last year. Baer was also
| Stanford representative to the Pacific
I Coast#Advertising Clubs Convention at
! Seattle last summer, where he was
1 one of the prize-winners in the speak
ing contest.
The three Utah debates will be in
the informal style used by the Oxford
debaters in their tour last year. The
j aim is to give an interesting and
■ thorough discussion of the subject,
j rather than to argue on technical
! points. No decision, either by judges
| or by the audiences will be taken.
The Stanford debaters will return
I to the campus next Sunday.
