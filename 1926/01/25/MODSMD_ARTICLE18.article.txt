# STANFORD DOWNS U.S.C. IN FIRST CONFERENCE GAME
## FINAL SCORE 25 TO 11 Southern California Loses Fight When Boyer Is Put Out on Fouls 
### Jim Adams 
Showing a marked improvement in
all departments, the Stanford basket
ball team swept to an easy victory
over a listless U.S.C. five, Saturday
night in the pavilion, with a score of
25 to 11. The Cards took an early lead
which was never threatened by the
Trojans and the half ended with a 16

It was not until late in the last
period that the Southerners made their
first and only field goal, when Wheeler
slipped one in under the basket. The
Trojans seemed to lack both fire and

the class that he is reputed of having.
With Boyer gone, the Trojans were
without a point-getter and they had to
be content with keeping down the
score of the Cards.
Guards Play Well
Vincenti and Anderson were the
leading performers for Stanford. The
former put up a scrappy game at run

and got the offense off to a fast start.
The credit for the low score of the
Trojans goes largely to Anderson who
time after time smeared the U.S.C.
forwards under the basket. He ex
perienced a little hard luck when
Bruner, the lanky Trojan ceuter, fed
him an elbow and Andy lost a couple
of teeth as a result.
With two referees on the floor there
was hardly a foul that escaped their
eyes and as a consequence each team
