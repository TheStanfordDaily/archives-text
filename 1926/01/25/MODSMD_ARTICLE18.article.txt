# STANFORD DOWNS U.S.C. IN FIRST CONFERENCE GAME
## FINAL SCORE 25 TO 11 Southern California Loses Fight When Boyer Is Put Out on Fouls 
### Jim Adams 
Showing a marked improvement in
all departments, the Stanford basket
ball team swept to an easy victory
over a listless U.S.C. five, Saturday
night in the pavilion, with a score of
25 to 11. The Cards took an early lead
which was never threatened by the
Trojans and the half ended with a 16
to 4 score in favor of the Reds.
It was not until late in the last
period that the Southerners made their
first and only field goal, when Wheeler
slipped one in under the basket. The
Trojans seemed to lack both fire and
spirit. Kenny Boyer, U.S.C. star for
ward, was forced out of the game
early in the first half with four per
sonal fouls before he could really show
the class that he is reputed of having.
With Boyer gone, the Trojans were
without a point-getter and they had to
be content with keeping down the
score of the Cards.
Guards Play Well
Vincenti and Anderson were the
leading performers for Stanford. The
former put up a scrappy game at run
ning gu&rd. His speed added a stimu
lant to the playing of the whole team
and got the offense off to a fast start.
The credit for the low score of the
Trojans goes largely to Anderson who
time after time smeared the U.S.C.
forwards under the basket. He ex
perienced a little hard luck when
Bruner, the lanky Trojan ceuter, fed
him an elbow and Andy lost a couple
of teeth as a result.
With two referees on the floor there
was hardly a foul that escaped their
eyes and as a consequence each team
had an abundance of free throws. Out
of their twenty-one chances the Tro
jans only registered nine. The Cards
scored on seven of their thirteen at
tempts.
Stanford Improves
The most noticeable improvement in
the playing of the Stanford five was
in their passing. They still experience
trouble In hanging on to the ball but
their passes were all well directed.
This naturally led to better teamwork.
Clark and Price tied for high-point
honors with six points each to their
credit. Clark, who played a very com
mendable game as substitute for
David, shot a couple of beautiful field
goals. He got his other two markers
on free throws. Price sauk three from
the field.
Whether the playing of the Stan
ford team instilled any fear in the
hearts of the California basketball
team, who were spectators at the
game, is not known, but it is certain
that the Cards' chances against the
Bears next Saturday went up several
points.

Stanford (25)— U.S.C. (11)—
Price (C) (6) F Boyer (C) (1)
