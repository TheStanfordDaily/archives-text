# "BOO!" Said the Crowd

Mr. "Red" Grange started to catch a punt yesterday afternoon at
Kezar stadium. The ball hit his hands and bounded away. "800, ' said
the crowd. A certain Mr. Ilealy, late of Dartmouth but now of the
Chicago Bears, took a few vicious kicks at the head of one Bob Htzke.
"Boo," shouted the crowd. The Bears left the field at the half on the
short end of a7to 0 score. "Boo," roared the crowd. And "Boo! Boo! '
The spectators who are flocking to see the Phantom (iray Ghost in
all parts of the United States are sounding the death knell of professional
football. They are going to see Grange tear off a few 50, 75, or 100
yard runs. Instead they are seeing some hard charging, spectacular
football —but Grange isn't in the limelight, and so they are staying to
boo, to wisecrack, and to make fun of the efforts of the players.
The attitude of the crowd is reflected in the work of the men on the
field. When the stands are hissing and booing, the players are driven
to rough, dirty tactics. The result is a condition worse than at the
average prize fight. Unless the crowds settle down and demand the
'same type of sportsmanship as is seen at college contests professional
football will wear itself out and pass into comparative oblivion, at least
is this true for the west coast of America.
The work of the two professional teams yesterday was unusual.
Both lines charged as if the men had their homes mortgaged on the
outcome of the game; the tackles and ends were down the field so fast
on punts that it was suicide for the safety man on the other team to
attempt to catch the ball; the backs did some spectacular ball carrying.
If such a game had been played by two college elevens it would have
been declared a world-beater —provided, of course, that the unnecessary
roughness was eliminated. But, instead of appreciation, there was
nothing but hissing and booing. It merely means that professional
football will never draw the class of people which forms the colorful
stands at college games. If it gets by, and we think it won't, it will
deteriorate into a type of prize fight between twenty-two men—much
like the old "nigger-free-for-all."
