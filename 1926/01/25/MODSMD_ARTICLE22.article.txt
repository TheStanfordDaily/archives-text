# The 						Team Comes Through

Last season Stanford did something in football that it has not
accomplished for many years—it defeated California. The undergradu
ates were pleased, the alumni were jubilant. Then the fans turned to
the second major sport of the year, taking it for granted that things
would run along smoothly. However, this did not prove to be the case.
In the first important game the varsity five took a bad licking. Then
came the Olympic Club clash which proved still more disheartening.
Things looked bad, and so last Saturday, the night of the first
conference game, fully 50 per cent of the student body did not attend —
certainly not a very good way of showing interest.
The Daily Palo Alto is not laboring under the delusion that an
organized rooting section is essential to a winning team; nor ynti that
100 per cent attendance must be had; but it is loud on its condemnation
of "quitters."
The varsity did not quit. The score shows this. But, on the other
hand, the rooters' ticket sale shows only too clearly that there are too
many "quitters" enrolled in the University. Now suppose someone
works out a psychology test which will make the elimination of these
undesirables possible.

Remarkable state of affairs at Pomona College as reported in the
columns of The Student Life:
"The members of the Kappa Theta Epsilon fraternity appeared on the
campus Wednesday evening wearing the pins of that organization. Since
that time the new fraternity's emblem has been attracting much comment."

The woman speaks! A co-ed's worldly advice on the old, old ques
tion, as gleaned from the Tulanc Hullabaloo :
"Falling in love is all right; but marriage is what I call going too far for mc.
I think it is perfectly terrible the way these girls and boys run off and marry without
the least idea of wliat they arc doing; of any ideas about home, of the family, of
anything. I don't think it ought to be allowed. The collegc authorities ought to do
something about it and stop them."

Strange and taking ways uncovered by the McGill Daily:
"There was once a comb on a chain in the Union wash room. It is not
there now; it is gone."

Astounding rashness collected and published by the Oklahoma Daily:
"A member of the student council Thursday night was bold enough to
make a statement that political parties should exist openly on the university
campus."
