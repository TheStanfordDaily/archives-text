# SPORTS OF 1926
## The 						Rambling Rabbit 
### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Rabbit Maranville played with Pittsburgh in 1924, Chi
cago in 1925, and will play with Brooklyn in 1926! Rather
a rapid change in address for one so small. And perhaps
if he hadn't played with the bright lights bo often, he'd
still be playing with Boston, where he started his long
major league career back in 1912. But now Walter James
Vincent Maranville —for that is his full name —has come
under the soothing influence of "Large Wilbert" Robinson,
who knows how to handle wild ballplayers as well as he
handled wild pitches in the days of yore when he was the
star catcher for the Baltimore Orioles.
The Rabbit's career around second base will be watched
with interest by all National League fans. He may ex
perience a wonderful year, as he certainly has had his ups
and downs lately—especially downs —and fortune is due to
smile on him once more. You recollect that as soon as he

was traded from Pittsburgh to the Cubs the Pirates won the National League
pennant and the world's championship. He broke his leg at the start of the
1925 training season, after being named captain of the Chicago team (who said
a rabbit's foot was lucky!); and as soon as he was named playing manager,
his team los' twelve out of fifteen games on its first road trip. Then the Cubs
finished in last place, and he was sent to Brooklyn for the waiver price of
$4000.
But we all like this little man —he's a splendid player, even though he isn't
as fast us he used to be, he's a fighter (he was born on November 11), and
he's a comedian! More power to you, Mr. Rabbit!
