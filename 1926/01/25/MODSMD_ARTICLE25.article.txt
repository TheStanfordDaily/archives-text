After noticing that the Quad will
award in its verse contest, as first
prize a silver flask, as second prize a
dinner at Taits at the Beach with one
of the opposite sex, and prize
a porcelain shaving mup, our sprmr of
propriety prompts us to suggest the
following supplementary ruies:
1. The first and second prizes shall

2. The third prize shall be awarded
to the person, male or female, who
shows the greatest need for it.
