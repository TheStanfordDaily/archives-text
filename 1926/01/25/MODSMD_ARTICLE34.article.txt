# TEMPLETON DEFEATS VARSITY BASEBALL NINE BY 7-6 SCORE
## But Learns that Wolter's Men Had Already Won Game 
### 
Hitting a clean two-bagger which
scored the winning run, Dink Temple
ton, track coach and occasional
pitcher, literally won his own ball
game when the alumni downed the var
sity nine by a 7 to C count in an extra
inning contest Friday afternoon, only
to learn that his run did no good, as
the game was officially over an inning
before. A miscalculation on the part
of the scorekeepers at the end of the
seventh had reckoned the tally at 6 to
6 instead of G to 5 in favor of the var
sity.
The game last year resulted in a
similar situation, both sides claiming
victory; but the decision was given
to the alumni. This year's bout is a
"no-decision affair."
The alumni took an early lead when
Lefty Heckendorf drove out a three
bagger, scoring two men, and then
scoring himself when Sheets reached
first on an error. McHose crossed the
plate in the second and Templeton in
the fourth, giving the grads five tallies
at the end of the seventh. The varsity
having made two runs in the second
inning, and a similar number in the
third and fifth, the game was officially
over at the end of the seventh.
The varsity succeeded in getting a
man on base in the first of the eighth
inning, but the alumni tightened
up and took the measure of the next
three batters. When the alumni came
to bat Fat Hawkins hit a one-bagger,
stole second, and on the next play
advanced to third. Templeton, the
next man up, crashed one into short
right field which netted him two bags
and scored Hawkins.
The varsity was composed of two
veterans, Chuck Johnston at first base
and Captain Murray Cuddeback at
third; six men from last year's fresh
man team, Cook Sypher behind the
plate, Don Garibaldi at second, Jim
Busch at shortstop, and Eugene Nis
sen, Weaver, and Bob Simms in the
outfield. Dick Hyland was seen in ac
tion on the Stanford diamond for the
first time, and he gave a creditable
account of himself from the pitcher's t
box. As would be expected so early in j
the season, teamwork was woefully I
lacking, and errors were many and
close between.
The work of Templeton on the i
mound for the graduates was the sur-!
prise of the afternoon. Scheduled to !
take considerable beating from the |
varsity sluggers, he turned the tables j
and kept them well in hand. He did i
not receive proper support from his j
teammates. Only once was he given j
much assistance, and that was in
the sixth inning when, with a man on j
third, a man on second, and no outs, i
the next three batters were put out
at first
Stanley Hawkins, Dave Brown, and
Howard Sheets covered the outer lot |
for the alumni, while the infield was
made up of Fat Hawkins behind the
bat, Ed Zwierlein on first base, Nip
McHose on second, Lefty Heckendor
fer on third, and Wakefield at short.

Busch at shortstop, and Eugene Nis
sen, Weaver, and Bob Simms in the
outfield. Dick Hyland was seen in ac
tion on the Stanford diamond for the
first time, and he gave a creditable
account of himself from the pitcher's t
box. As would be expected so early in j
the season, teamwork was woefully I
lacking, and errors were many and
close between.
The work of Templeton on the i
mound for the graduates was the sur-!
prise of the afternoon. Scheduled to !
take considerable beating from the |
varsity sluggers, he turned the tables j
and kept them well in hand. He did i
not receive proper support from his j
teammates. Only once was he given j
much assistance, and that was in
the sixth inning when, with a man on j
third, a man on second, and no outs, i
the next three batters were put out
at first
Stanley Hawkins, Dave Brown, and
Howard Sheets covered the outer lot |
for the alumni, while the infield was
made up of Fat Hawkins behind the
bat, Ed Zwierlein on first base, Nip
McHose on second, Lefty Heckendor
fer on third, and Wakefield at short.
Hitting a clean two-bagger which
scored the winning run, Dink Temple
ton, track coach and occasional
pitcher, literally won his own ball
game when the alumni downed the var
sity nine by a 7 to C count in an extra
inning contest Friday afternoon, only
to learn that his run did no good, as
the game was officially over an inning
before. A miscalculation on the part
of the scorekeepers at the end of the
seventh had reckoned the tally at 6 to
6 instead of G to 5 in favor of the var
sity.
The game last year resulted in a
similar situation, both sides claiming
victory; but the decision was given
to the alumni. This year's bout is a
"no-decision affair."
The alumni took an early lead when
Lefty Heckendorf drove out a three
bagger, scoring two men, and then
scoring himself when Sheets reached
first on an error. McHose crossed the
plate in the second and Templeton in
the fourth, giving the grads five tallies
at the end of the seventh. The varsity
having made two runs in the second
inning, and a similar number in the
third and fifth, the game was officially
over at the end of the seventh.
The varsity succeeded in getting a
man on base in the first of the eighth
inning, but the alumni tightened
up and took the measure of the next
three batters. When the alumni came
to bat Fat Hawkins hit a one-bagger,
stole second, and on the next play
advanced to third. Templeton, the
next man up, crashed one into short
right field which netted him two bags
and scored Hawkins.
The varsity was composed of two
veterans, Chuck Johnston at first base
and Captain Murray Cuddeback at
third; six men from last year's fresh
man team, Cook Sypher behind the
plate, Don Garibaldi at second, Jim
Busch at shortstop, and Eugene Nis
sen, Weaver, and Bob Simms in the
outfield. Dick Hyland was seen in ac
tion on the Stanford diamond for the
