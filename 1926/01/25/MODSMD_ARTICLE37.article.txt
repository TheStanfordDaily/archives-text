# LICHTENSTEIN WILL GIVE EXPLANATORY TALK ON SYMPHONY
## 
### Herb Klein 
An explanatory talk on the struc
ture of the symphony orchestra and
the program of the San Francisco
Symphony, in Its concert here tomor
• row night, will be given by Victor
Lichtenstein in the Assembly hall at
8 o'clock this evening.
Lichtenstein is well known as the
originator of the popular San Fran
] cisco musical lecture series entitled
j "Symphonylogues" and "Operalogues"
in which he explains the current pro
| grams of the orchestra and the offer
; ings of the opera season. He speaks
with authority on his subject for he
is an accomplished violinist and a
member of the first violin section of
the San Francisco Symphony under
j the first violin section of the San
i Francisco Symphony under Alfred
j Hertz. The compositions he will ex
plain are familiar to him from the
part he has taken in their perform
ance by the orchestra on many previ
ous occasions.
Has Informal Style
Lichtenstein has an easy and enjoy
ably informal style of discourse. His
explanations are not technical and can
readily be understood by those previ
ously unfamiliar with orchestras and
their music. The comment has been
frequently made that his talks have
the effect of making the music they
have explained far more vital as well
as more easily understandable to the
listeners. The structure of the modern
orchestra, with its division into string,
woodwind, brass, and percussion sec
tions, is a uecgssary piece of knowl
edge for anyone who wishes to derive
the maximum amount of pleasure from
concerts, and Lichtenstein has the
ability to make this clear and inter
esting.
Will Analyze Program
The analysis of the orchestra's pro
gram, which will occupy a large part
of the talk, will give the historical
and social background of each piece
and its composer and take up the
musical structure of the numbers. To
morrow's program is one which is
especially suited for such an explana
tion. The interesting facts surround
ing the origin of the "New World"
Symphony, the major work of the pro
gram, the symphonic form which it il
lustrates, and the unique and peculiar
style of "Afternoon of a Faun," the
modern work, are all interesting sub
jects which will add greatly to appre
ciation of the orchestra's concert.
Educated in Europe
Lichtenstein received his musical
education in Europe where he played
as a member of several noted orches
tras. He was violinist under Arthur
Nikisch, Europe's foremost conductor
at that time, and also under Ysaye, in
Belgium. He is a musical critic as well
as performer, and has written exten
sively for musical periodicals. Since
coming to California in 1921 he has
been a member of the orchestra, head
of his own violin school, and a regular
lecturer on Music Appreciation, pro
gram analyses, and tendencies in
music. He has given a thirty-lecture
summer course in the university ex
tension division.
The talk tonight is arranged by the
Committee on Public Exercise and all
are invited regardless of whether they
hold tickets for Tuesday's concert or
not.

woodwind, brass, and percussion sec
tions, is a uecgssary piece of knowl
edge for anyone who wishes to derive
the maximum amount of pleasure from
concerts, and Lichtenstein has the
ability to make this clear and inter
esting.
Will Analyze Program
The analysis of the orchestra's pro
gram, which will occupy a large part
of the talk, will give the historical
and social background of each piece
and its composer and take up the
musical structure of the numbers. To
morrow's program is one which is
especially suited for such an explana
tion. The interesting facts surround
ing the origin of the "New World"
Symphony, the major work of the pro
gram, the symphonic form which it il
lustrates, and the unique and peculiar
style of "Afternoon of a Faun," the
modern work, are all interesting sub
jects which will add greatly to appre
ciation of the orchestra's concert.
Educated in Europe
Lichtenstein received his musical
education in Europe where he played
as a member of several noted orches
tras. He was violinist under Arthur
Nikisch, Europe's foremost conductor
at that time, and also under Ysaye, in
Belgium. He is a musical critic as well
as performer, and has written exten
sively for musical periodicals. Since
coming to California in 1921 he has
been a member of the orchestra, head
of his own violin school, and a regular
lecturer on Music Appreciation, pro
gram analyses, and tendencies in
music. He has given a thirty-lecture
summer course in the university ex
tension division.
The talk tonight is arranged by the
Committee on Public Exercise and all
are invited regardless of whether they
hold tickets for Tuesday's concert or
not.
An explanatory talk on the struc
ture of the symphony orchestra and
the program of the San Francisco
Symphony, in Its concert here tomor
• row night, will be given by Victor
Lichtenstein in the Assembly hall at
8 o'clock this evening.
Lichtenstein is well known as the
originator of the popular San Fran
] cisco musical lecture series entitled
j "Symphonylogues" and "Operalogues"
in which he explains the current pro
| grams of the orchestra and the offer
; ings of the opera season. He speaks
with authority on his subject for he
is an accomplished violinist and a
member of the first violin section of
the San Francisco Symphony under
j the first violin section of the San
i Francisco Symphony under Alfred
j Hertz. The compositions he will ex
plain are familiar to him from the
part he has taken in their perform
ance by the orchestra on many previ
ous occasions.
Has Informal Style
Lichtenstein has an easy and enjoy
ably informal style of discourse. His
explanations are not technical and can
readily be understood by those previ
ously unfamiliar with orchestras and
their music. The comment has been
frequently made that his talks have
the effect of making the music they
have explained far more vital as well
as more easily understandable to the
listeners. The structure of the modern
orchestra, with its division into string,
woodwind, brass, and percussion sec
tions, is a uecgssary piece of knowl
edge for anyone who wishes to derive
the maximum amount of pleasure from
concerts, and Lichtenstein has the
ability to make this clear and inter
