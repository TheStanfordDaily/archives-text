# EDUCATIONAL CLUB GIVEN CHAPTER OF PI LAMBDA THETA
## 
### 
Pi Lambda Theta, national women's
I educational fraternity, has accepted
the petition of the local Women's Edu
' cation Club for a charter. Upsilon
j chapter will be installed at Stanford
as soon as a date is set by the fra
ternity officials.
The fraternity was organized with
Alpha Chapter at the University of
Missouri. The admission of the Stan
ford Club brings the chapter roll to
twenty. University of Southern Cali
fornia has the only other California
chapter. There is a club at the Univer
sity of California that is now petition
ing for a chapter.
National requirements of Pi Lambda
Theta to which petitioning bodies
must conform make the local organiza
tion an honorary society composed of
upper division and graduate women.
Its members are selected from the
highest fourth of the women regis
tered in the education department and
their scholastic average of "B" must
be maintained.
Each club applying for admission is
also required to be at work on its
own research problem, which must be
completed and ready for publication
at the time of installation. Work of
this type was begun last quarter by
the Women's Education Club on the
problem, "Why Teachers Leave the
Profession." Questionnaires were sent
to Stanford alumni engaged in educa
tional work and the returns tabulated.
Research along other lines is being
continued on this question and, al
though the work will not be complete
for several years, its major details
will be ready when the chapter is in
stalled.
The club was organized in Febru
ary, 1924, and has been sponsored by
Dr. John C. Almack of the Education
department. First information was i
sent to Pi Lambda Theta in January, j
1925, and the preliminary petition sent i
in June. Officers of the club are Lillian !
Bidwell, president; Katherine Ewell,
vice-president, and Marian Toll, secre
tary.
