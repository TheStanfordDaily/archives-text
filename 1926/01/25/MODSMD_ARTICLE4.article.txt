# THIEVES BREAK IN POSTOFFICE BOXES; REMOVE CONTENTS
## 
### 
Usinfe an inkwell as an imple
ment an unknown thief, or gang
of thieves, late Saturday night
broke the glass in the doors of
several boxes at the University
postoffice completely removing
the contents. The exact amount
taken is not yet known, but it is
barely possible that the boxes
broken into were empty at the
time.
That it was the work of an
inside gang is firmly believed by
the authorities for they broke
into only particular boxes and in
those boxes took everything but
the dust.
At the postoffice it is believed
that the crime was committed by
some young rascals who were
bent on mischief, and who didn't
realize that they might be bent
on the way to the penitentiary
if their identity were discovered.
