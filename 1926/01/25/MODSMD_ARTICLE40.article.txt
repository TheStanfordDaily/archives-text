# Board of Athletic Control Loses Most Active Member
## 
### 
Leland W. Cutler of San Francisco, 1
for ten years probably the most active
member of the Stanford board of ath
letic control, resigned from the board
Friday.
Cutler gave as his reason for resign
ing, pressure of business and the fact
that the board has now accomplished
what it set out to do, making this an
appropriate time for him to step out.
