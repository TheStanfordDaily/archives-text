# WEIGHT BASKETBALL TEAMS WIN TWICE IN FRIDAY'S GAMES
## 
### 
Stanford's 145-pound basketball team
defeated the University of California
Pharmacists 15 to 9 in the pavilion
Friday night. In a preliminary game
the 130-pound squad downed the Fre
mont Union High School five 16 to 5.
The 145's played an excellent offen
sive game with effective passing, but
were sadly lacking in the ability to
ring the basket. In the first half two
shots counted for Bcores out of forty
two attempts. The average was little
better in the last period.
The defense was fair. With the Bla
zier, George, Sanders, Newcombe,
Ankele combination working together
satisfactorily, the prospects for a vic
tory over the California weight team
are brighter than they have been in
some years.
During the first half both teams ran
about even. The score stood 1 to 1 for
about six minutes; it then climbed
slightly to give the Cardinals a 6 to 5
lead at the end of the period. Van
King substituted for Blazier in the
opening of the last half, and started
by scoring on a long, side shot. Har
lowe looked good at the other forward
position.
With five Stanford substitutes in the
game the Pharmacists built up a 9 to
8 lead, but the first string men were
sent in with a few momentß to go
and cinched the game with three bas
kets and a foul shot.
The 130's failed to function too well
and could only score 16 points on the
weak high school team. Whitney and
Thomas split all the honors, scoring
fourteen points between them. Brock
way slipped in the other basket.
