# FRESHMAN QUINTET BEATS HIGH SCHOOL CHAMPS 20 TO 15
## Babes Display Good Form in Last Preliminary Game; McCandless Stars 
### 
Stanford's freshman quintet again
emerged with a clean slate, defeating
the Stockton high school five 20 to 15
in the preliminary contest last Satur
day. The Stockton Tarzans, who have
held the state scholastic championship
four out of the last five years, led the
Cardinal babes at the half, but the
Stanford team soon took the lead in
the final period, holding their narrow
margin with the final gun.
The game was one of the fastest
played in the pavilion this year.
Playing better ball than in any of
their other victories, the freshmen
proved that California will be given
keen competition in their annual
series. The first game with California
will be played Friday night, which
leaves but one week of practice left
to put the yearlings in top form.
McCandless Stars
McCandless played an excellent
game for the 1929 team, scoring a ma
jority of their points by his spectacu
lar shooting. Sexson, Crary, and Sib
bett all played good ball while in the
game. The former was especially adept
at working the ball down the court,
his passing and pivoting giving the
freshmen many of their shots at the
hoop. Osmonson, substitute forward,
played well Saturday, showing a de
cided improvement in shooting.
Berg, Stockton guard, was high
point man for the visitors, two of the
high school player's field goals being
long shots from difficult angles. Sweet,
forward for the Tarzans, was one of
the fastest men on the floor. Several
times he raced the full length of the
court before any of the Cardinal men
could stop him.
Defense Improves
The defensive work of the frosh
showed marked improvement, Lewis'
guarding stopping the advance of the
Stockton forwards time and again.
Worden and Marks alternated at the
other guard, the two being on a par
for this position. Their playing in prac
tice this week will probably determine
which one starts against the Blue and
Gold freshmen.
The starting lineups:
Stanford: Sexson and Crary, for
wards; Lewis and Worden, guards;
McCandless, center. Substitutions: Os
monson, Sibbett, Marks.'
Stockton: McCoy and Sweet, for
wards; Bower and Berg, guards; Bush,
center. Substitution: Vallerino.
Referee: Harold Taggart.
