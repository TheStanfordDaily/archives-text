# GLEE CLUB CONCERT OVER RADIO MEETS WITH PUBLIC FAVOR
## 
### 
The concert of the Stanford Glee
Club over radio KTAB last Friday
night was very popular with the listen
ers-in. Long distance phone calls with
appreciations and requests for repeti
tion of numbers showered in upon the
station.
Lack of time prevented the fulfill
ment of all these requests, but the
club sang its group of three negro
spirituals over twice. Clarence Young
and Tom Drake were obliged to re
peat their novelty song, which the an
nouncer entitled "the collegiate ver
sion of 'It Ain't Gonna Rain No More'."
Jtobert Reed, piano soloist of the
club, played a group of piano selec
tions after which the club repeated
several numbers by popular request.
The Glee Club will be heard over
radio KPO of San Francisco in the
near future.
