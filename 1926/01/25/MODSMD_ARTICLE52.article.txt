# HEADS OF WOMEN'S ASSOCIATIONS MEET TO DISCUSS PLANS
## 
### 
Round-Table Discussion whose mem
bers compose the heads of all the
women's organizations, met last Fri
day to consider organization plans for
the coming quarter.
This group meets once each quarter
to compare the plans and hopes of
each organization. The head of each
association outlines its course of ac
tion for the quarter. This is done in
order to eliminate any conflict between
the organizations. Suggestions and
criticisms are especially desired on
any school affairs that the women con
sider warrant such action. Suggestions
concerning the Fiesta are especially
wanted. All suggestions will be placed
in a box located in Mies Yost's office.
The main object of these meetings
is to form a better spirit of co-opera
tion among the organizations.
Those attending the Round-Table
Discussion were: Mildred Worswick,
president Associated Women; Jean
Ward, president W.A.A.; Margaret
Cosgrave, executive chairman of
Fiesta; Allene Thorpe, women's edi
tor of Quad and Daily Palo Alto;
Peggy Dietrlck, head sponsor; Esther
Greenacre, president Y.W.C.A.; Wanda
Westerfield, president Pan-Hellenic,
and Pauline Hoffman, president of
Roble.
