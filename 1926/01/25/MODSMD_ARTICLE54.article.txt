# RANKING OF TENNIS PLAYERS CHANGED BY FIRST MATCHES
## 
### 
Although Cranston Holman and Cap
tain Lionel Ogden maintained their
first and second place standing on
the Cardinal tennis squad, several
changes resulted from the first match
es of varsity competition.
Paul Fairchild, formerly third player
on the Stanford squad and one of the
team which played against California
last year, dropped to fourth place by
virtue of a defeat at the hands of Alan
Herrington, captain of the freshman
team last year. Gomer Thomas and
Ralph McElvenny, both members of
last year's babe squad, retained fifth
and sixth places respectively, Thomas
defeating his opponent who in turn
defended his position by trimming
Frank Dunn.
Alan Mc√üay lost to Dunn and re
mains in eighth place, followed by
Hutton Miller who defeated Ramund
Murphy for the ninth ranking posi
tion.
Competition between men on the
varsity squad will continue for several
weeks. A new schedule of matches has
been posted on the bulletin board in
the gymnasium, the contests between
players ranked below sixth place to
be played off before Wednesday night.
The first six of the varsity will have
until Friday to play their opponents.
