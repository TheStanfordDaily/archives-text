# Ram's Head Show Will Rehearse In Old Union Lobby
## 
### 
Typical nineteenth century melodra
matic characters will be the roles for
the players in the annual Ram's Head
show which will be presented in the
Assembly hall February 12. Written
by Dave Lamson and Mike Ely, for
mer Chaparral editors, the play, which
is as yet unnamed, is a burlesque on
the famous "Rover Boys" series whose
exploits thrilled the young reader of
pre-war times.
Tom Rover, the comedian of the
cast, will be portrayed by A1 Cass,
with Charles Parks as Dick, the man
ly, straight-forward youth of the fam
ous trio. Together with Leonard
Schwartz, who has been chosen for the
part of Sam Rover, the three are
finally ejected from their college
through the efforts of Jack Dalton,
Dick's rival, and Drusilla, the typical
scheming college vampire.
Drusilla, played by Mel Lindsay,
happens to be the President of the
Associated Anti-Kissing League. While
advocating her cause at this particu
lar college, she contrives with Dalton,
played by A1 Robertson, to arrange the
expulsion of the trio. Dalton, accom
panied by his villain's black mustache,
is the sinister character of the plot,
and his evil ways cause the Rover
Boys many difficulties.
The part of Dora, the typical sweet
and innocent young miss, will be
taken by Bat Kelley. Lee Flood and
George Eardley, who were to have
taken the parts of Caroline and Ole,
have changed parts, Flood to portray
the negro servant and Eardley the
"colored mammy."
Chorus rehearsals will be held at 7
o'clock this evening in the lobby of
the Old Union, while the cast will
meet at the same time in the Little
Theatre.
