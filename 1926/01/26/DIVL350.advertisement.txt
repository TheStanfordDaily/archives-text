SOMETHING NEW in
Flannel Trousers
More color in the fabrics; more
snap in the cut than ever before.
New shades in sky blue, silver
grey, and sunburn buff. Handsome
stripes of blue, grey, and fawn.
Tailored uncommonly well. Snug
at the waist, pants straight,
smaller at the cuffs.
Have a look at 'em.
