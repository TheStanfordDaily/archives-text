WATCH THE MEN WHO ENJOY THEIR WORK
VOU SEE MEN who have unlimited capacity for work. They gen
erally get ahead. Work doesn't tire anyone, but the strain you're
under while you work does. It wears you out. Do a quarter of what
another does and you're fatigued. The greatest strain is eye strain.
It means a drain on your nervous energy. That's the force that drives
people forward when none is wasted on weakening eyes.
