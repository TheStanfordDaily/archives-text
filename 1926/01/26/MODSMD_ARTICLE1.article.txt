# ENCINA 3E COMES FROM BEHIND TO DOWN EL CAMPO
## RAGGED PLAY YESTERDAY Other Victors Are S. A. E., El Tigre, Dekes, Sigma Nu, El Cuadro 
### Gordon French 
Encina 3E team sprang a surprise
rally on the El Campo team to noße
them out by one point, 22 to 21, in the
feature contest in yesterday's intra
mural basketball tilts. A one-handed
whot by Smalling, fast freshman for
ward, in the last half minute of play,
made the deciding basket.
The Sigma Alpha Epsilon quintet
won its third straight tilt by the score
of 31 to 7 over the Encina 3W team,
while El Tigre held its tie for the lead
in League V by winning a ragged
game from the Branner I team, 9 to 2.
Delta Kappa Epsilon rallied to win
from Chi Psi 6 to 4, Sigma Nu out
played Phi Sigma Kappa, 12 to 8, and
El Cuadro failed to appear for its
game with Delta Tau Delta.
Bigelow Runs Wild
The Encina 3E Ave forged to the
front early in the first half of its tilt
with El Campo and continued to in
crease the lead until the end of the
period, due largely to clever shooting
by Zombro for six points and Smalling
lor five. With El Campo on the short
end of a 15 to 9 score, Bigelow, club
team forward, got his eye on the
basket and scored five baskets in rapid
succession before the freshman outfit
awoke from their daze.
With three minutes to go and the
score 19 to 15 against them the En
cina squad started a rally which net
ted five points, including two long
shots by Thomason, but Holmes of the
club five put his team back in the
lead only to have Smalling win the
game. Bigelow was high point man
with thirteen points to his credit,
while Smalling and Thomason tied
for second honors with eight digits
each.
S.A.E. Crushes Encina
The S.A.E. five ruined the Encina
3E team in a one-sided game; the
first half ended 16 to 2, but the Encina
quintet put* up a better fight in the
second half and managed to score
five points. McDermott and Gibbons
tied for high point man for the S.A.E.
team with five baskets each. Keyes,
the fraternity guard, played a good
floor game and scored a field goal.
The El Tigre team scored an easy
victory over the Branner I five in an
uninteresting tilt. They were leading
7 to 0' at the half but seemed over
confident in the second period and
could score only two points on fouls
while Branner scored a field goal.
Dekes Rally
The Dekes rallied in the last half
of their tilt with four points already
chalked up by the Chi Psi outfit and
overcame a 4 to 2 lead in a tightly
fought contest. Ogden, Deke forward,
scored all six points for his team. The
result was quite an upset as previously
the Chi Psi team had held the strong
S.A.E. squad to a 12 to 11 victory.
The first half of the Sigma Nu-Phi
Sigma Kappa tilt was almost even 6
to 5 but the Phi Sig team fell behind
12 to 8 by the end of the game. Todd
was high scorer with six points.
