# MILLIONS OF PEOPLE LIVING MAY NEVER SLEEP STANFORD SAGE DISPUTES THIS BY EXPERIMENTS STUDENTS FORCED TO STAY AWAKE MANY HOURS

Rather than thinking that we go to
sleep drunk, and wake up 'detoxified,
H. R. Laslett, who has been carrying
on experiments in the Psychology de
partment, would say that sleep be
comes necessary just the same way
as food or water do. He would say
that sleep, therefore, is a positive re
action, and not a negative one, as so
many have tried to prove all through
the past centuries.
One expert, Irenee DuPont, of the
DuPont-Nemeus corporation, is so rad

will be found which, when taken into
the human system, will accomplish the
results of eight hours of sleep."
In order to confirm his own theories
Mr. Laslett last quarter made an ex
periment with four Stanford students,
Frederick E. Hines, John A. Leiter,

Harold W. Peterson, and Edward C.
Tabler. He had them cut down on
their average amounts of sleep by
forty per cent, and then tested at
various intervals the effect of the in
somnia.
Before starting out on the experi
ment he gave the men eighteen prac
tice periods of tests so they would
become thoroughly familiar with the
types of examinations and would not
find much difference between the time
they started taking the regular tests
after they had been going without
sleep and the time they finished. Dur
ing the practice period he gave them
tests once each day, five days of the
week. When the real work started
they were given tests every day, and
then when they were allowed to fall
back to their normal hours of sleep a
