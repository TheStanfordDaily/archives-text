# MILLIONS OF PEOPLE LIVING MAY NEVER SLEEP STANFORD SAGE DISPUTES THIS BY EXPERIMENTS STUDENTS FORCED TO STAY AWAKE MANY HOURS

Rather than thinking that we go to
sleep drunk, and wake up 'detoxified,
H. R. Laslett, who has been carrying
on experiments in the Psychology de
partment, would say that sleep be
comes necessary just the same way
as food or water do. He would say
that sleep, therefore, is a positive re
action, and not a negative one, as so
many have tried to prove all through
the past centuries.
One expert, Irenee DuPont, of the
DuPont-Nemeus corporation, is so rad
ical as to offer the following sugges
tion: "I think it is likely that material
will be found which, when taken into
the human system, will accomplish the
results of eight hours of sleep."
In order to confirm his own theories
Mr. Laslett last quarter made an ex
periment with four Stanford students,
Frederick E. Hines, John A. Leiter,

Harold W. Peterson, and Edward C.
Tabler. He had them cut down on
their average amounts of sleep by
forty per cent, and then tested at
various intervals the effect of the in
somnia.
Before starting out on the experi
ment he gave the men eighteen prac
tice periods of tests so they would
become thoroughly familiar with the
types of examinations and would not
find much difference between the time
they started taking the regular tests
after they had been going without
sleep and the time they finished. Dur
ing the practice period he gave them
tests once each day, five days of the
week. When the real work started
they were given tests every day, and
then when they were allowed to fall
back to their normal hours of sleep a
few more days of tests were given to
get any change in recovery, and when
the recovery took place.
Sleep Few Hours
Pour and three-quarter hours a night
was the average sleeping time for the
men after the forty per cent had been
deducted. At the end of the period
the men did not show any appreciable
change in any of their mental or phys
ical actions. However, Mr. Laslett is
certain that if this shortage of sleep
were carried on for some months or
years the person would become irrita
ble and nervous. Napoleon is accred
ited with having slept only four hours
a night for twenty years, but such
things are always apt to be exagger
ated, and there was only one Napo
leon.
The intoxication theory, which is
being expounded by so many psycholo
gists today, can hardly be totally cor
rect, according to Mr. Laslett. He says
if going without sleep is carried too
far, convulsions, such as occur when
too much liquor is taken into the sys
tem, or a poisonous snake bites a per
son on the leg, will take place. These
do not ordinarily occur after going
without sleep, so it is hard to believe
that this can be the sole cause of
sleep.
W. H. Howell, probably the greatest
living authority on sleep, has three
separate theories of sleep: first, that
the brain shuts the door and cuts off
the nerves and organs of the body al
most completely when it becomes
tired; second, that sense organ reac
tion is withdrawn; and third, that the
blood supply of the brain is diminished
and that sleep is necessary to restore
the sufficient quantity.
Positive Reaction
Laslett thinks that this last theory
of Howell's is the most likely because
it admits of a positive reaction, much
the same way as when the body tissues
run out of food and it is necessary to
eat, or when the internal organs be
come parched and water is needed to
"wet the whistle."
A new experiment is being tried this
quarter by Laslett in which he will
have a group of students go without
sleep for a continuous period of sev
enty-two hours. He conducted an ex
periment two years ago for fifty hours
and obtained some very satisfactory
results.
