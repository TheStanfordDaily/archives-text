# MODERN ORCHESTRA, SYMPHONY PROGRAM SUBJECT OF TALK
## Victor Lichtenstein Says That Themes Are Important Factor in Music 
### 
"The modem orchestra offers to the j
listener a complex marvelous struc- j
ture of varied tone characteristic of
many instruments which go to make j
it up; but it does more than this: it
expresses the mood of the composer |
for every listener to hear and appre- j
ciate according to his own mental j
stature." Such was the statement of:
Victor Lichtenstein in his lecture lastj
night on the structure of the orches- ;
tra and the program of the San Fran
cisco Symphony in its first concert j
here tomorrow night.
Mr. Lichtenstein was assisted by an
accompanist who played piano arrange- (
ments of the orchestral scores of the!
symphony which were analyzed. His !
talk was clear and unteclinical at all j
times, and the music, as he described â– 
it, was a vital and living thing, of!
very human appeal.
The structure of the modern orches-j
tra was contrasted with the classical l
orchestra as it existed before 1840.!
The four sections into which all in- J
struments are grouped: string, wood
wind, brass, and percussion, is the j
same now as formerly, the difference
lying in the addition to each group of,
new instruments with their added tone
qualities. Among the newer instru- j
ments are the piccolo, English horn,
harp, tuba, and trombone.
"Each instrument has its own dis
tinctive tone color and individual ex
pressive power which is different from j
that of any other instrument. The com- i
poser gives the instruments varying j
roles to play in the drama of sound
which is his work," said Lichtenstein. j
"The themes or melodies are the clues I
that guide the listener through the |
great mass of sounds in the orchestra. '
Melody is, after all, the essential thing j
in music, even being more important
than harmony. Every great symphonic j
work has had noble themes."
