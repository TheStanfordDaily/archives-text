# CALIFORNIA GLEE CLUB WILL ELIMINATE JAZZ
## 
### 
The University of California Glee 1
Club will henceforth sing nothing but !
classical numbers, according to an !
announcement by Brick Morse, direc-1
tor of the club. This policy will be 1
followed in both home and traveling
pcrformanc.es. The change comes as a
result of the opposition of the Asso
ciated Students Executive Committee j
to a proposed European tour of the j
club. The committee felt that the type |
of program the club had been putting
on in the past with jazz bands, vaude
ville stunts, and popular songs, were
not representative of the University
of California. Joel H. Hildebrand. dean t
of men, suggested that the club change
its policy and Morse agreed.
"Dean Hildebrand feels that the
club can be carried on with only
classical numbers on its program,"
says Morse. "We are going to make
a sincere effort to attain that goal."
The Glee Club is a self-supporting
organization conducted under the As
sociated Students of the University
of California. It has taken extensive
tours, having traveled three times to
Europe, twice to the Orient, and twice |
to Alaska.
