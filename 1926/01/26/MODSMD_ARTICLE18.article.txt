### Herbert Klein 
Alfred Hertz and the entire San
Francisco Symphony Orchestra of
ninety-five musicians will give a con
cert in the Stanford Assembly hall
at 8:15 o'clock tonight. This will be
the first appearance of this, the West's
greatest musical organization on the
campus since last year. The orchestra
is brought to the campus through the
efforts of the Stanford Symphony Com
mittee members who have secured it
for two concerts besides the one to
morrow night: one in the Assembly
hall on February 16, and the last for
the Founders' Day concert in the Me
morial Church on the evening of
March 9.
Tickets for the concert tonight will
be on sale at the box office. Single
seats are priced at ?1.25, $1.75, and
$2.25 for single concerts. A few
roughs' seats in the balcony will be
available tonight for 50 cents.
A notable program has been ar
ranged by Alfred Hertz, nationally
famed conductor, for his first concert.
Heading the list of three compositions
will be the ever-popular "New World"
symphony by Dvorak, which has be
come one of this country's favorite
orchestral numbers, partly because of
the wealth of beautiful melodic and
rhythmical effects with which it is
filled, and partly because it is the
only great symphonic work written for
and of America. The composer, Anton
Dvorak, was a Bohemian and the
greatest musician of his native land.
After a period of three years spent in
teaching in New York City he wrote
his fifth symphony which he dedicated
to "the new world."
Mischel Piastro, the new first violin
ist of the orchestra, and one of the
finest violin players in the West, will
be the soloist with the orchestra in
Tchaikowsky's Violin Concerto which
completes the program. Tchaikowsky's
masterful musicianship and the emo
tionality of his music have made him
one of the most played-of composers
and a favorite with modern audiences.
