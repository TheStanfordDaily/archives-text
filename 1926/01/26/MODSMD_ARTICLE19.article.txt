Women's Athletic Association re
quests that all women who have re
ceived awards for participation in ath
letic competition at Stanford shall
wear their awards tomorrow on Quad,
according to an announcement made
last night by Jean Ward, president of
the association.
The board of the association recom
mended at its last meeting that all
awards, both letters and class nu
merals, should be worn on Quad every
Wednesday. Tomorrow will be the
first day for this ruling to be enacted.
The purpose of this action is to get
the women more accustomed to wear

and to start a tradition for the Quad
wear of athletic letters and numerals
by women as well as men.
