# English Praise for Stanford
## 
### 
A bit of praise for Stanford University came recently from England
by way of the Outlook magazine. M. C. Hollis, a member of the Oxford
debating team which traveled throughout America and visited the west
coast last year, "true to his national instinct," as the Outlook puts it, has
given the nation a few of his impressions of the country he visited.
"The American University" is the title and as may be surmised, the
article was general and mildly condemnatory. Again true to his national
instinct, Hollis was only politely critical —but it would take a genuine
American collegian stubborn in defense of his Alma Mater, to deny the
truth of his statements and many of his deductions.
Organization, fraternities, mass education, and loss of individuality
among students are pointed out as characteristics of the American Univer
sity. lie admits, however, that "no generalization about America can be
at best more than half a truth." Leading up to the Stanford comment,
Hollis asks the question, "Why is it that people are best educated when
they live by the sea? The advantages of the East are manifest. It has
age and tradition, which are so necessary to culture.
"But why if you leave Yale and Harvard on the east coast, is it neces
sary to travel six days to the west coast to find their equal ? * * * We
are often told that it is because the sea brings it (California) into contact
with other cultures and saves it from the isolation of the Middle W r est.
But the explanation is surely too facile. I do not believe that the excel
lence of Stanford is entirely due to the fact that the students go down
from Palo Alto to watch the steamer coming into San Francisco.
"I think, rather, that the explanation, if it is not in natural virtue, is in
the climate —the climate of California, which has forced the people, per
haps unwillingly, perhaps unadmittingly, into leisure. For a leisurely life
is the greatest need of the American university of today. By far the great
est vice of American education is that there is much too much of it."
We except with blushes the praise bestowed upon our university, mean
while attempting to refrain from the facetious remark that "Leisure is un
doubtedly a great need." Furthermore, although "backslapping" by one's
self is difficult and yet under the stress of praise, (if the paradox is
understood) we feel that Stanford may pardonably rock back in its desk
chair with satisfaction at Mr. Hollis' reference to "the excellence of Stan
ford."
And yet, to what does our English visitor refer? "The excellence of
Stanford." Later he links us with leisure—"the greatest need of the
American university of today." Naturally it is the scholarly leisure of the
English university; that leisure that consists, we are told, of diversified
sports, and individual education. It cannot l>e said of Stanford that it
possesses such offerings in their entirety. We can only wonder then if
Hollis did not refer to our pleasing isolation from metropolitan haste, our
attempt at diversified sports, and our progress toward individuality in
education. To complete the self-examination, may we be pardoned if we
wonder if Hollis did not refer in part to our personnel?
As he states, there cah be no true generalization concerning America.
Least of all, we believe, there can be none concerning its institutions. Such
bouquets, therefore, as have been presented in the course of the above
paragraphs must be received with the proverbial grain of salt and the
"excellence of Stanford" subjected to an impartial criticism. While we
of the West "point with pride" to certain features of Stanford, the East
may point with scorn, and while we enjoy a fancied place in the sun of
English favoritism, it would be unreasonable to believe our position im
pregnable.
