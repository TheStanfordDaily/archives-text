THE WINTER ARMOUR
As the winter season for full moons
will soon be open, we take pleasure
in presenting this intriguing poem
about the coldness of love:
I've watched thee grow frub tedder twig
To sproutigg vide, thou lovely thigg,
Add dow, before with paid I choke,
Pray, lebbe be thy bighty oak,
Pray, twide about by willigg deck,
I'll dever let thee go, by Heck.
So Rduggle dowd, thou twidigg vide,
Add rest thee od by vadly side.
—L.A.B.

What the library really needs is
what it really needs, and that is more
big feet and a louder heating system.
Some people have the big idea that
the floor of the library is a skating
rink. Others labor under the delusion
that they are marching into the gates
of Rome in triumph. Still others have
the habit of getting their canal boats
to show the austere firmness of their
dignity through solid and heavy and
measured contacts with the floor.

The heating system takes the prize
for combativeness, however. Such pon
dering and mortal agonies does it emit
i that the whole thing more closely re
! sembles the proverbial boiler factory.
Between the heavy-hoofed gentry and
; the heating system, a din can be
kicked up that beggars description.
Except for these two, and the lack of
the Police Gazette, the library is all
right, however. Hooray for books, big
feet, and hot air! —J. S.

The San Francisco Bulletin seems
:to be assiduously attempting to com
pletely abolish 'ell on earth, according
(o the following clipping from the
front page of that paper:
"If a gir is to make her way in Wa
1 street, she ought to he a reguar feow.
Pear Kramer, 30 years od and en
tirey personabe, who is probaby the
youngest woman ever appointed to the
! board of directors of a v>nnvi™e in*H
tution, hods this view. Her first task
as she assumed her new duties was
to begin nrenarations a $ •
merger of Engish, German, and Ameri
can firms."
