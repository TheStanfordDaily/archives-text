## Big Boy Buckeye 
### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
"Garland may not be the most he-sounding of first
names for a ball player, but Garland Buckeye is certainly
a he-man if there ever was one. (And what's in a name,
anyhow? One of the Dartmouth football team was named
Fauntleroy.) Garland is six feet tall and weighs 240
pounds! Besides baseball, this boy Buckeye has played
pro football for half a dozen seasons, so if you think there's
anything ladylike about him, why—well, just meet him
once.
Garland Buckeye should be one of Tris Speaker's best
pitchers during the coming season. He got off to a poor
start last year, due to a case of "flu" caught during training
season, but when he finally did get under way he won eight
games in succession. His final rating at the end of the
season was fourteen games won and eight lost, or a per
centage of .636. He pitched one shutout, and held the

Tigers to four hits in one game, driving in nve runs nimseu wun iwo gigtuiuu
homers.
Cleveland was well supplied with southpaws last year, having Smith,
Shaute, Miller, Yowell, and Cole, besides the aforementioned Buckeye. And
1 lie lad with the first name like a wreath of flowers not only led all the team
in weight, bur he had a higher pitching percentage than any Cleveland hurler
—right-handers as well as southpaws.
