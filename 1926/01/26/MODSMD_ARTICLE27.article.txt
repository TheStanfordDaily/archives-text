# UNIVERSITY OF UTAH DEBATERS SET FOR STANFORD INVASION
## 
### 
With the University of Utah de
baters scheduled for the first forensic
contest of the Stanford barn-storming
tour, Theodore F. Baer and George N.
Crocker, Cardinal representatives, will
arrive in Salt Lake City tonight. Baer
and Crocker left the campus yesterday
on the Southern Pacific, and will be
away from Stanford until Sunday,
while participating in debates with
the University of Utah, the Utah Agri
cultural College, and the Brigham
Young University.
Utah, the first opponents of the
Stanford team, will be encountered to
morrow night. "Resolved, That the
younger generation's freedom of
thought and action is detrimental to
society" will be the subject for de
bate, the Utah team supporting the
negative of the question.
No decision either by judges or by
the audience will be given at the close j
of the debates. Unfair decisions, and i
general dissatisfaction following deci- {
sion debates have caused the mana
gers of the teams to do away with
decisions. The aim is to give a thor
ough discussion on both sides of the
question, rather than an argument on
technical points.
Little is known of the strength of
the University of Utah team. Coached
by Don Lewis, the Utah debaters met
Hollis, Mac Donald, and Woodruff, of
the Oxford team, which later debated
Stanford during the fall quarter of
last year. Both Utah and Stanford
were given decisions in these con
tests.
Each speaker will be allowed fifteen
minutes for the opening addresses.
The affirmative will have three re
buttals of six, seven, and three min
utes, while the negative will have two,
each of eight minutes' duration. Baer,
of Stanford, will open and close the
debate at Salt Lake City tomorrow
night.
