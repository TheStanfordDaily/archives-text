# EMINENT ARTIST VISITS STANFORD CAMPUS PAINTER OF ROYALTIES ADMIRES STUDENT LIFE ENDEAVORS TO SPEED IT UP AT $1.00 A THROW
## 
### Frank Baker 
Charles Pape, the self-styled "great
est living sketcher of the college stu
i dent." has at last arrived at Stanford
on his annual lecture and sketching
tour. Pape travels from college to col
lege enlightening students in methods
j of salesmanship and drawing pictures
of all who desire to have an artist's
conception of themselves hung on the
wall.
Pape has been acclaimed the "Man
with the Golden Hand." He also has a
golden voice. He believes in giving
one his money's worth, so instead of
charging the enormous fee he used to
charge the Prince of Wales and the
crowned heads of Europe, he is sketch
ing college students for the nominal
sum of $1 per sitting. He does this
because it is the way he likes to live.
He admires the jollity of the campus
and the simple directness of the stu
dents. In fact, he is a clever ci'ayon
and chalk colorist from Chicago—and
points East.
Gives Speed
When asked if he had ever sketched
any albinos Pape said that he had
not, but that he had sketched a lot of
"Octo —er —generians." He claims that
Raphael, Rembrandt, and the rest were
all right in their day, but what the
modern world wants is speed. So he
gives 'em speed. Instead of taking six
years to paint a portrait, he guaran
tees to do one in six minutes.
This genius is not a temperamental
and touchy person as are so tnany of
the greater thinkers and artists; he is
just one of the people and he wants

everyone to understand that —"for, as
a fact," he says, "I am merely the
greatest, sketcher in the world."
Not often is so versatile a genius as
| Pape discovered. He resembles the
artists of the Renaissance, who were
not only adepts with the brush, but
were sculptors, architects, and gold
smiths, as well. Pape is working on
two inventions, for which he has pat
ents. One is a lining for the back of a
heel when the lining of the heel wears
out. The discovery has three wonder
ful qualities to recommend it: it will
not wear out, it can be inserted in the
shoe in a moment and will stay, and
last of all, it will keep the shoe, if it
be an oxford, from rubbing holes in
the stockings in conspicuous places.
Invents Paint Brush
His other invention is a fountain
paint brush, after the style of foun
tain pens. A set of these brushes can
be purchased for a small sum and the
smelly, dirty palette can be kissed
goodbye. This, according to Pape, will
enable the wealthy patrons of art who
dabble on canvas at home to do their
work without dirtying up the room,
and should be a great innovation.
Having just come from Hollywood
where he has been sketching promi
nent movie stars, he is planning to
stay on the campus for a few days to
sketch those whom he missed last
year, and then go back to Harvard,
Yale, and Princeton. At least that's |
what he Baid one time. Another time ;
he said he was in search of work j
enough to enable him to get to Seattle, j

Pape has been acclaimed the "Man
with the Golden Hand." He also has a
golden voice. He believes in giving
one his money's worth, so instead of
charging the enormous fee he used to
charge the Prince of Wales and the
crowned heads of Europe, he is sketch
ing college students for the nominal
sum of $1 per sitting. He does this
because it is the way he likes to live.
He admires the jollity of the campus
and the simple directness of the stu
dents. In fact, he is a clever ci'ayon
and chalk colorist from Chicago—and
points East.
Gives Speed
When asked if he had ever sketched
any albinos Pape said that he had
not, but that he had sketched a lot of
"Octo —er —generians." He claims that
Raphael, Rembrandt, and the rest were
all right in their day, but what the
modern world wants is speed. So he
gives 'em speed. Instead of taking six
years to paint a portrait, he guaran
tees to do one in six minutes.
This genius is not a temperamental
and touchy person as are so tnany of
the greater thinkers and artists; he is
just one of the people and he wants

everyone to understand that —"for, as
a fact," he says, "I am merely the
greatest, sketcher in the world."
Not often is so versatile a genius as
| Pape discovered. He resembles the
artists of the Renaissance, who were
not only adepts with the brush, but
were sculptors, architects, and gold
smiths, as well. Pape is working on
two inventions, for which he has pat
ents. One is a lining for the back of a
heel when the lining of the heel wears
out. The discovery has three wonder
ful qualities to recommend it: it will
not wear out, it can be inserted in the
shoe in a moment and will stay, and
last of all, it will keep the shoe, if it
be an oxford, from rubbing holes in
the stockings in conspicuous places.
Invents Paint Brush
His other invention is a fountain
paint brush, after the style of foun
tain pens. A set of these brushes can
be purchased for a small sum and the
smelly, dirty palette can be kissed
goodbye. This, according to Pape, will
enable the wealthy patrons of art who
dabble on canvas at home to do their
work without dirtying up the room,
and should be a great innovation.
Having just come from Hollywood
where he has been sketching promi
nent movie stars, he is planning to
stay on the campus for a few days to
sketch those whom he missed last
year, and then go back to Harvard,
Yale, and Princeton. At least that's |
what he Baid one time. Another time ;
