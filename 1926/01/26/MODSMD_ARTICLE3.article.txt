# CHAPARRAL EDITOR SETS DEADLINE AT HIGH NOON, FRIDAY
## 
### 
Humorists with sentimental or
otherwise amorous tendencies must
get their feelings of affection, sorrow,
or despair into a concrete and concise
written form before Friday, for the
deadline for contributions to the Val
entine number of Chaparral falls on
that day at exactly twelve o'clock
noon.
Although contributions of a pic
torial nature will not be unwelcome,
the poetry and prose of love will be
looked upon with much more favor by
the editor than the cartoons of affec
tion.
The next issue of Chaparral will
consist of valentines to the nth power.
Valentines from freshmen or seniors,
valentines from apple polishers to
their professors, and valentines from
the committee on scholarship may
take their place in the number. All
Valentinos should do their stuff.
