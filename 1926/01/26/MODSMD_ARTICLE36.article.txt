# INFALLIBILITY OF "OLD TESTAMENT" IS DISCUSSED BY DAVIS
## 
### 
"Most scientific men do not believe
in the infallibility of the Old Testa
ment, fail to regard the decrees of the
early Christian councils, but have a
devout belief in the ethics of Christ,"
said Professor W. M. Davis Sunday
night in his talk on "The Faith of
Reverent Science" at the freshman
assembly held in Encina hall.
"The Old Testament is only a preju
â–  diced record of the moral development
j of a barbarous, ignorant, and rude peo
j pie being extremely human in its gro
, tesque ideas of deity and miracles."
| Professor Davis claims that the ad
vancement of science has made it im
possible for scientific men to believe
in the sudden origin of the earth.
Noah's ark and the deluge, or Joshua's
command making the sun to stand
still.
In attacking the orders of the early
councils of the Christian church Pro
fessor Davis stated "The Sermon on
the Mount has had less influence on
religion in Europe than the Nicene
creed because of the tvrannioal power
of the church authorities. The world's
practice of ethics have been lagging
behind scientific advance."
