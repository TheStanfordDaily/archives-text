# CHESS CLUB MEMBERS COMPETE FOR RANKING
## 
### 
Rapidly played chess matches, in
which only fifteen seconds are allowed
for each move, are being played by
members of the Chess Club to
determine a new temporary rank
ing, it was announced at a meeting of
the organization last night. Rankings
will be changed periodically until just
before the California match in April.
The seven ranking players at that
time will participate in the match.
Certificates were issued to members
of the team which played against
California last year in recognition of
their participation.
The match between the four rank
ing varsity players and the four rank
ing freshmen was postponed because
no definite rating of varsity players
has been possible as yet.
Louis B. Zapoleon, chess coach, was
elected honorary member of the club.
