# FORMER STANFORD MAN RECEIVES BIG SHELL OIL POSITION
## McDuffie, ’09, Makes Quick Rise to Production Manager Office 
### 
| The biggest job of its kind in the
1 world is being filled by William C.
McDuffie, Stanford '09, who left the
University in his junior year and took
a job as mucker in the Kern County
oil fields. Ending the most spectacular
rise ever seen in this business, Mc-
Duffie recently left Los Angeles for
I Venezuela to enter upon his work as
' general production manager for the
Royal Dutch Shell Company. This con
; cern has main offices in Amsterdam,
: Holland, and holdings in five conti
' nents and the Dutch East Indies.
McDuffie, coming here from Berke
ley in 1905, registered in the oil and
mining department, which he left to
take a job as day laborer with a pipe
; gang of the Caribou Oil and Mining
I Company. In 1910 he stepped from
| tool-dresser for the Caribou company
I to a position with the North American
I Consolidated Company. In less than
' five years he was superintendent, and
j in 1915 he made the step which began
I his startling rise. He took his first
: job with the Shell Company of Cali
i fornia as superintendent of its Coal-
I inga field.
Seven years later he became gen-
I eral field superintendent for the Shell
1 company. With greater scope for his
; talents, he soon showed his worth by
| bringing in the Signal Hill field, the
■ most sensational strike in the oil his
| tory of California. On June 15, 1923,
|he was made vice president of the
j California Shell company.
Last year, McDuffie was called to
j Amsterdam, returning in December
with his new job. The position was
[specially created for his ability. Mc-
Duffie, at this phenomenal height, is
but 40 years old.
