# WEIGHT TEAMS VIE WITH HIGH SCHOOL FIVES IN PAVILION
## 
### 
The weight basketball squads will
play a double-header in the pavilion
tonight, the 145-pound team meeting
McClymonds High School of Oakland
at 8 o'clock, while the Palo Alto High
will take on the 130-pound aggregation
in the preliminary game, starting at
7 o'clock.
After their fair showing Friday
night against the University of Cali
fornia Pharmacists, the 145's should
display a fast offensive drive tonight
with Hal Rodney George, and
Fred Newcombe in the lineup. With
the weight men taking a considerable
lead, the substitutes may show up
well.
The lack of scoring power has handi
capped the 130-pound team this season
and they will have to shoot plenty of
baskets to beat the Palo Alto squad.
Thomas and Whitney will probably
start in the forward positions, while
Macey will play center.
