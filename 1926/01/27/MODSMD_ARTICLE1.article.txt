### Ballotboxer 
The campus will lapse into its semi
annual political turmoil next Monday
when nominations for class and stu
dent body officers open. From Monday
at 8 o'clock until Friday noon campus
politicians may throw their candidates'
bats into the ring. Said hats may be
removed by reluctant candidates up
to 11 o'clock Saturday morning.
This year members of both sexes
may nominate each other. In previous
years only women could nominate
women and men nominate men, but a
recent ruling of the Executive Com
mittee makes reciprocal nominations
possible. The nomination ballots will
be dropped in a box provided for the
purpose on the quad, and daily returns
-will be published in the Daily Palo
Alto, as announced by John A. Sutro,
chairman of the election board.
