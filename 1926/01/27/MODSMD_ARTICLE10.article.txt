## 
### 
A grandson of Anna Cora Mowatt,
author of "Fashion," was discovered
living at Menlo Park in the person
of Jlarry Dalton, a member of the
faculty of the Menlo School for Beys,
when the name of the Masquers' play
for Friday was made known to him.
This relationship was discovered
when Cecil Doll, who takes the role
of Adam Turner, the simple, honest
farmer in the play, was speaking to
Dalton about the old-fashioned cos
tumes and the atmosphere of the nine
teenth century with which the Stan
ford production is to be colored. When
Doll went on to tell briefly of the play,
Dalton remarked that it reminded him
of a play written by his grandmother,
and upon being asked his grandmoth
er's name he said, "Anna Cora Mow
att." Thus it was disclosed that the
play was the same.
Anna Cora Mowatt was born in
France, of American parentage, in
1819. Coming to this country at an
early age, she spent her girlhood in
New York. At the age of fifteen she
married, and in the following year,
"1834, published her first novel.
"Fashion," which became her best
known work, was her only attempt at
drama.
Following the success of her play,
Mrs. Mowatt went on the stage and
created quite a name for herself in
emotional roles. It was not until al
most the end of her career that Mrs.
Mowatt was afforded the opportunity
to take part in her own play. As
Gertrude, the lead in "Fashion," Mrs.
Mowatt scored a distinct personal tri
umph in both New York and London.
Her work is of interest not only be
cause of the fact that she was one of
the earliest American female drama
tists, but also because "Fashion" itself
had a great influence on the subse
quent trend of American drama.
