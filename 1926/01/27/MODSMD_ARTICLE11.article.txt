# THETA SIGMA PHI ANSWERS DEMAND FOR HOT DOUGHNUTS
## 
### 
Tlieta Sigma Phi will hold its
raid-week doughnut sale tomor
row morning. The bargain coun
ter will be located in front of the
Women's Clubhouse, and busi
ness will commence at 9 o'clock.
Regular customers who are
familiar with the excellent quality
of Theta Sigma Phi's personal
brand of sinkers are cordially in
vited to be present with their
friends, provided they are accom
panied by the nominal fee which
it has been customary to charge
â€”one nickle each.
Only eighteen dozen have been
procured from the Palo Alto fac
tory which supplies Theta Sigma
Phi, so sleep late, miss breakfast,
and take advantage of this extra
ordinary sale on your way down
to the daily grind, is the advice
of the enterprising scribes.
