# "SIEGFRIED" TO BE SHOWN HERE NEXT WEDNESDAY EVENING
## 
### 
"Siegfried," a German film produc
tion by the UFA Company which made
"Passion," will be shown in the As
sembly hall next Wednesday evening
under the auspices of the Dramatic
Council.
By special arrangement, the Dra
matic Council has been able to secure
this film. "Siegfried" plays only in
legitimate theatres, and ran in the
Capitol theatre in San Francisco dur
ing the Christmas holidays. The same
orchestra which accompanied the
showing in San Francisco will be
brought to the campus for the local
performance.
Hugo Riesenfeld, the New York di
rector and composer, wrote a musical
score for "Siegfried" which is largely
made up of selections from Wagner's
"Ring Cycle" operas. On this opera
and the Norse Saga the story of the
film is based. Fritz Lang is the di
rector.
