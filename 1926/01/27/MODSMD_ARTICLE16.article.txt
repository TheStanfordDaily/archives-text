# CALIFORNIA QUINTET SHOWS STRENGTH IN PRELIMINARY GAMES

I Strong on the offensive, and stronger
I on the defensive, adequately describes
| the ability of the California varsity
basketball squad. The Santa Clara con
test gave an excellent exhibition of
i the power of the Bruin quintet. Using
| second-team men a good part of the
j time, the Blue and Gold team piled
up 53 points while holding the Bron
chos to thirteen.
In every game except one, the Bears
have scored more than 25 points, and
no opposing team has been able to pile
j up 20 points against the Bruin five.
I St. Ignatius and the Trojans both ap
j proached this mark, but could only ac
cumulate 17 points in their games
! against the Bears.
Strong as the Bruins are, however,
j they are not conceded better than a
50-50 chance of defeating Stanford,
i The Bruins played exceptionally well
i against the Trojans, and won a pair
of games from the Southerners, 37-17
I and 32-12, but Stanford's 25-14 win
j over the U.S.C. team last week places
j the two quintets on practically even
; terms.
During the early part of the season
the Bruins made most of their points
|by feeding Fran Watson and Milt
Butts, but as the season progressed,
the Bears began to feed Bill Higgins,
lanky All-Conference center. Bill was
high-point man in five consecutive
games, and in one game he amassed
a total of 17 points.
George Dixon and Vern Carver have
been displaying a splendid brand of
; basketball, and it has been largely
j their work which has kept the scores
! of the opposing teams as low as they
have been.
Besides having a good first five, the
Bruins have a capable set of reserves.
Milt Butts and Dudie Brobst have been
high-class subs for Captain Holmes
and Fran Watson, the first-string for
wards, while Newt Davis and Frank
i Couper have played well when they
have relieved Dixon and Carver. Swede
Peterson is a splendid center, but he
; has not seen much service as Higgins
I is too valuable a man to bench, even
j for a short period.
