# SPEEDY DELIA CHI SQUAD WINS FROM CHINESE CLUB FIVE
## SUFFERN SCORES MOST Betas Beat Japanese Club; Sequoia Defeats Encina Basement Quintet 
### Clif Moore 
Delta Chi won easily from the Chi
nese Club in the feature game of yes
terday's play in the third round of the
annual intramural basketball series.
The fraternity team showed a fast
offense and had little trouble running
up a 30 to 2 score against the Chinese
players. Beta Theta Pi took a rough
and-tumble contest from the Japanese
Club, 17 to 5. Sequoia defeated Encina
Basement 17 to 9 in the final game on
yesterday's schedule.
Bill Suffern had an exceptionally
good night at the basket for Delta Chi,
and starred in the game with the Chi
nese Club. Suffern found the goal from
all angles, and is credited with a total
of 18 points resulting from nine field
goals. This is the highest number of
points any intramural player has made
in a single game so far this season.
Suffern Stars
The Delta Ch,is worked well to
gether and advanced the ball down
the floor by means of clever passing.
Suffern was usually on the receiving
end of the offense and rarely missed
his tries at the basket. The Chinese
had considerable trouble getting
around their bigger opponents, and
were prevented from scoring on many
occasions by the effective guarding of
the Delta Chi defense.
Rowles and Burns played a good de
fensive game for the fraternity quin
tet. Rowles displayed an ability to hit
(the basket on long shots, and is cred
ited with three goals from near the
center of the court. Tuan was the only
j Chinese player to break into the scor
ing column, his field goal in the second
half saving his team from a shut-out.
Betas Show Teamwork
The Betas played a good passing
game in their tussle with the Japanese
Club. The result of good teamwork,
however, was lessened by poor shoot
ing under the basket, and it was this
defect that kept the fraternity team
from running up a much larger score.
The Japanese players tried too much
dribbling and not enough attempts at
the basket.
Mannoccir, Beta center, and one of
the high-point scorers of the intra
mural series, had a poor night under
the basket. He and Kissinger tied for
high point honors with six markers
each.
Japanese Checked
The first half was marked by the
inability of both teams to find the
basket, and the period ended with, a
6 to 3 score in favor of the Betas. In
the second half, the Row players be
gan to work better together, and were
more successful in scoring. The Japa
nese were checked by the guarding of
Montgomery and Bushnell in an effec

tive manner in the last period. Endeo,
center on the club team, was high with
two field goals to his credit.
The Sequoia-Encina Basement con
test was very raggedly played, in ad
dition to being marked by constant
fouling by both teams. Sequoia had
many chances at the goal, especially
in the last half, and missed a good
opportunity to run up a decisive score
by failure to make short shots.
Sequoia Wins
McKenna, Sequoia forward, captured
high-point honors with eight points.
He and Mack worked to advantage in
the forward positions, and were the
main offensive strength of the win
ners. Thornton, freshman forward, hit
the basket for seven of his team's nine
points, and is also credited with a
good defensive game.
Following are the games on tomor
row's schedule:
4:ls—Encina 1W vs. Encina 4E.
4:50 —Theta Chi vs. Zeta Psi.

ing under the basket, and it was this
defect that kept the fraternity team
from running up a much larger score.
The Japanese players tried too much
dribbling and not enough attempts at
the basket.
Mannoccir, Beta center, and one of
the high-point scorers of the intra
mural series, had a poor night under
the basket. He and Kissinger tied for
high point honors with six markers
each.
Japanese Checked
The first half was marked by the
inability of both teams to find the
basket, and the period ended with, a
6 to 3 score in favor of the Betas. In
the second half, the Row players be
gan to work better together, and were
more successful in scoring. The Japa
nese were checked by the guarding of
Montgomery and Bushnell in an effec

tive manner in the last period. Endeo,
center on the club team, was high with
two field goals to his credit.
The Sequoia-Encina Basement con
test was very raggedly played, in ad
dition to being marked by constant
fouling by both teams. Sequoia had
many chances at the goal, especially
in the last half, and missed a good
opportunity to run up a decisive score
by failure to make short shots.
Sequoia Wins
McKenna, Sequoia forward, captured
high-point honors with eight points.
He and Mack worked to advantage in
the forward positions, and were the
main offensive strength of the win
ners. Thornton, freshman forward, hit
the basket for seven of his team's nine
points, and is also credited with a
good defensive game.
Following are the games on tomor

4:50 —Theta Chi vs. Zeta Psi.
7:15 —Breakers vs. Kappa Alpha.

nese Club in the feature game of yes
terday's play in the third round of the

up a 30 to 2 score against the Chinese
players. Beta Theta Pi took a rough
and-tumble contest from the Japanese
Club, 17 to 5. Sequoia defeated Encina
Basement 17 to 9 in the final game on
yesterday's schedule.
Bill Suffern had an exceptionally
good night at the basket for Delta Chi,
and starred in the game with the Chi
nese Club. Suffern found the goal from
all angles, and is credited with a total
of 18 points resulting from nine field
goals. This is the highest number of
points any intramural player has made
in a single game so far this season.
Suffern Stars
The Delta Ch,is worked well to
gether and advanced the ball down
the floor by means of clever passing.

end of the offense and rarely missed
his tries at the basket. The Chinese
had considerable trouble getting
around their bigger opponents, and
were prevented from scoring on many
occasions by the effective guarding of
the Delta Chi defense.
Rowles and Burns played a good de
fensive game for the fraternity quin
tet. Rowles displayed an ability to hit
(the basket on long shots, and is cred
ited with three goals from near the
center of the court. Tuan was the only
j Chinese player to break into the scor
ing column, his field goal in the second
half saving his team from a shut-out.
Betas Show Teamwork

game in their tussle with the Japanese
Club. The result of good teamwork,
however, was lessened by poor shoot
ing under the basket, and it was this
defect that kept the fraternity team
