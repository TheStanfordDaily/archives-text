### Clif Moore 
Delta Chi won easily from the Chi
nese Club in the feature game of yes
terday's play in the third round of the
annual intramural basketball series.
The fraternity team showed a fast
offense and had little trouble running
up a 30 to 2 score against the Chinese
players. Beta Theta Pi took a rough
and-tumble contest from the Japanese
Club, 17 to 5. Sequoia defeated Encina
Basement 17 to 9 in the final game on
yesterday's schedule.
Bill Suffern had an exceptionally
good night at the basket for Delta Chi,
and starred in the game with the Chi
nese Club. Suffern found the goal from
all angles, and is credited with a total
of 18 points resulting from nine field
goals. This is the highest number of
points any intramural player has made
in a single game so far this season.
Suffern Stars
The Delta Ch,is worked well to
gether and advanced the ball down
the floor by means of clever passing.
Suffern was usually on the receiving
end of the offense and rarely missed
his tries at the basket. The Chinese
had considerable trouble getting
around their bigger opponents, and
were prevented from scoring on many
occasions by the effective guarding of
the Delta Chi defense.
Rowles and Burns played a good de
fensive game for the fraternity quin
tet. Rowles displayed an ability to hit
(the basket on long shots, and is cred
ited with three goals from near the
center of the court. Tuan was the only
j Chinese player to break into the scor
ing column, his field goal in the second
half saving his team from a shut-out.
Betas Show Teamwork
The Betas played a good passing
game in their tussle with the Japanese
Club. The result of good teamwork,
however, was lessened by poor shoot
ing under the basket, and it was this
defect that kept the fraternity team
