# The 						Cultural Aspect

### 
Most of the serious minded youths alxnit the campus are caught
in a whirl of books and hectic cramming for examinations within a
few days after the quarter begins. And as the term progresses the pres
sure and strain becomes worse gradually—there is time for nothing but
lecture notes and reference books. Then, to keep from breaking, there is
an occasional movie or trip to the city. And for the happy-go-lucky type,
for whom studies and honor points are meaningless, the card table, the
flowing bowl, and the All-snappy story magazine hold perpetual charm.
In the meantime the world goes on alxnit us, and we are scarcely con
scious of what it does. One class of students is continually buried in dry
texts, the other in vastly different pursuits—both concerned with little out
side of their narrow, divergent spheres. Why is it we cannot realize that
most of the things of interest in later life are not found in a path so narrow
and so expressionless? How many Stanford students have read the Green
Hat or the Constant Nymph? How many of them can talk intelligently
of Eugene O'Neill? Or how many of them could discuss with a reason
able degree of assurance fifty per cent of the works of art and literature
contained within the Harvard Classics?
The ignorance of college students in just such things as these is what
stamps college educations as failures in the minds of many well-read and
cultivated individuals. Our required courses and major departments pre
pare us for a specialized field. If we are not careful we will know nothing
of the wealth of material found outside of this field when we leave Stan
ford. To supplement college courses we should acquaint ourselves with
the best of current drama and fiction. We should keep abreast of the day's
news. We should become rounded and broadened as well as crammed with
statistics, rules, and theories.
Probably one in seventy-five does this. The rest of us just can't find
time. When we might have a spare moment we find ourselves caught in
the midst of a bull session.
How much better it would be for every student to force himself to
read for a certain number of hours every week upon subjects in no way
connected with his courses. The English department has prepared a com
prehensive list of the best books in the world of fiction, poetry, art, drama,
religion, and like subjects. Even though one is not enrolled in Free Read
ing wouldn't it be a good plan to secure this list and set about becoming
acquainted with the books mentioned?
Time is fleeting. Why let it slip? Or as Omar would have it:
"Ah make the most of what you yet may spend,
Before we too into dust descend,
Dust into dust and under dust to lie,
Sans wine, sans song, sans singer, and sans end!"

cultivated individuals. Our required courses and major departments pre
pare us for a specialized field. If we are not careful we will know nothing
of the wealth of material found outside of this field when we leave Stan
ford. To supplement college courses we should acquaint ourselves with
the best of current drama and fiction. We should keep abreast of the day's
news. We should become rounded and broadened as well as crammed with
statistics, rules, and theories.
Probably one in seventy-five does this. The rest of us just can't find
time. When we might have a spare moment we find ourselves caught in
the midst of a bull session.
How much better it would be for every student to force himself to
read for a certain number of hours every week upon subjects in no way
connected with his courses. The English department has prepared a com
prehensive list of the best books in the world of fiction, poetry, art, drama,
religion, and like subjects. Even though one is not enrolled in Free Read
ing wouldn't it be a good plan to secure this list and set about becoming
acquainted with the books mentioned?
Time is fleeting. Why let it slip? Or as Omar would have it:
"Ah make the most of what you yet may spend,
Before we too into dust descend,
Dust into dust and under dust to lie,
Sans wine, sans song, sans singer, and sans end!"
Most of the serious minded youths alxnit the campus are caught
in a whirl of books and hectic cramming for examinations within a
few days after the quarter begins. And as the term progresses the pres
sure and strain becomes worse gradually—there is time for nothing but
lecture notes and reference books. Then, to keep from breaking, there is
an occasional movie or trip to the city. And for the happy-go-lucky type,
for whom studies and honor points are meaningless, the card table, the
flowing bowl, and the All-snappy story magazine hold perpetual charm.
In the meantime the world goes on alxnit us, and we are scarcely con
scious of what it does. One class of students is continually buried in dry
texts, the other in vastly different pursuits—both concerned with little out
side of their narrow, divergent spheres. Why is it we cannot realize that
most of the things of interest in later life are not found in a path so narrow
and so expressionless? How many Stanford students have read the Green
Hat or the Constant Nymph? How many of them can talk intelligently
of Eugene O'Neill? Or how many of them could discuss with a reason
able degree of assurance fifty per cent of the works of art and literature
contained within the Harvard Classics?
The ignorance of college students in just such things as these is what
stamps college educations as failures in the minds of many well-read and
cultivated individuals. Our required courses and major departments pre
pare us for a specialized field. If we are not careful we will know nothing
of the wealth of material found outside of this field when we leave Stan
