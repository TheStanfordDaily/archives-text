Intramural basketball teams hopelessly out of the running for the
league championships are developing defaulting propensities with increas
ing frequency,as the season progresses. Having teams withdraw from the
series when their players begin to discourage of winning a plaque is con
trary to the aims and purposes of the intramural sports system. It re
sults in a general loss of interest in the play, narrows the competition to a
few of the letter teams, but worst of all it robs the men on the losing teams
of the wholesome sport and exercise which it was hoped they would receive.
Having shown that it is bad in a number of different ways on princi
ple to withdraw from the competition after losing the second contest, we
can think of even another reason why teams should not withdraw. len
points are granted to each group entering a team in the basketball tourney
and these points are added to the yearly intramural point standing. Two
points are subtracted every time the team forfeits a game, and so the living
group's chances of coming out near the top at the end of the sport season
is lessened every time a game in a particular sport is forfeited.
