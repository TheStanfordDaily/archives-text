# SPORTS OF 1926
## Rube's Rainbow's End 
### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Meet Mr. Marquard, player, manager, and president of
the Providence Club of the Eastern League. The "Rube,"
as he is known from coast to coast, has had a notable
baseball career, and it is to be hoped that he will find his
new position both enjoyable and remunerative.
Unlike Napoleon, Richard le Marquis began with his
Waterloo, and gradually worked his way up until he was
one of the best advertised, best paid, and most popular
pitchers in the business. In 1906 Rube pitched for the
Waterloo club out in lowa. From there he went to Indian
apolis, and from there to the Giants, for John McGraw
purchased him in 1908 for the then unheard-of price of
$11,000'.
In 1909 the merry villagers turned out in large quanti
ties to give this new high-priced beauty the once over.
The Rube obliged by pitching a terrible game. There was

murmuring from the innumerable multitudes. Mr. Marquard tried again, and
again failed to please. The murmuring had now assumed all the aspects of
the well-known Bronx cheer, and some even dared to call the new expensive
southpaw "the 311,000 lemon." And so the Rube's first season as a Giant went,
eiKM-ie v'th only five wins and thirteen defeats against his name.
Put Mc-Graw didn't lose faith in this youngster, and all the world knows
how Marquard came through in 1911, winning twenty-four games and losing
only seven. Arid in 1912 he made his remarkable record of winning nineteen
s . aight. To me, his best record, however, is his long career in the majors,
and it was clue to the fact that success and popularity failed to spoil him when
he was young. Rube never smoked or drank—and he pitched ball for eighteen
years.
