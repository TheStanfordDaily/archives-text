CONFESSIONS OF FEMALE FROSH,
OR THE RED PERIL OF PALO ALTO
By Letitia Lemon
Volume I, Book 1, Chapter 1, Episode I
My First Jollyup
I will tell you first of my experiences
at a sort of barbaric dance given at a !
noted girls' dormitory, the name of
which I dare not mention, on the cam
pus of a well-known university (too
well-known to mention) where I once !
toiled and labored to make Phi Beta;
Kappa. My registration was cancelled j
after the first quarter (for reasons
which I shall not discuss, but for which
the evils of the scholastic system of i
examinations is undoubtedly to blame), i
But as I was saying, they were giv- >
ing a so-called jolly-up (the name itself
is very suggestive) at the hall where
I was staying. (I moved out of that ■
hall into a boarding house in Palo Alto [
after the first month because the lock
out rule, an infernal institution rife
with suggestion of evil, offended me
so.)
I was in my room reading (let me
see, what was it?) the .... Ladies' I
Home Journal (I never read tranhv
magazines such as the Wienerwurst
and many other whose names would
not bear mention), when suHHenlv
door was burst open and three girls
who lived near me in the hall entered.
"Come on." they said, "let's go to
the jolly-up."
At first I refused, saying that I could
not dance, but they insisted until I
was finally almost dragged from my
room by them. This was the first jolly-!
up of the year. I had never been to j
one before so I did not know their
infernal machinations.
Besides, the name suggested to me
then a sort of pleasant gaiety; I did
not suspect the real meaning of the
term jolly-up. I also remembered the
good times I had had at the barn
dances back in dear old TiO~v
out, Nevada, when Mr. Firebug, the
fiddler, used to play Virginia reels and i
hesitation waltzes for us. and how we j
girls used to dance together until al- i
moßt as late as eleven o'clock some
times.
This was entirely different; but how
was I to know? So I combed my hai r
and put on my best bib-and-tucker and i
left my room (to return later). My
friends-led me down the hall and into 1
the lobby. There I saw a sight that
made a rod glow come n-m* m y face.
