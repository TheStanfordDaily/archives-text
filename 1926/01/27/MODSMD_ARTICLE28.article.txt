# VARSITY, FRESHMAN WATER POLO TEAMS SHOW IMPROVEMENT
## 
### 
With less than three weeks to go
lor their games with California, both
varsity and freshman water polo
squads are working out daily. The
rough spots in the playing of both
teams have been smoothed off in the
last week by additional practice and
Ernst Brandsten's coaching.
Brandsten aims to produce teams
that will be superior to California in
condition as well as teamwork, for the
Stanford playing will be based more
than ever on a fast swimming game
with men constantly on the jump. Ac
curate passing of the ball, speedy
dribbling down the tank, and constant
shifting of all players, especially
those in the forward line, so as to be
free from the men guarding them, are
the principles Brandsten is drilling
into frosb and varsity alike.
Allen is Mainstay
Heading the list of veterans on the
varsity Bquad is Arden Allen, this
year's captain, who is a mainstay in
the backfield. Bob Williams will play
in a guard position. Both he and Allen
are able to go well under a minute for
the 100-yard dash. The third backfield
position will probably be taken by Ken
Graham.
Van den Akker, of last year's fresh
man squad, has been playing sprint
position with Art Stewart, of last
year's varsity, as one forward. The
other forward position is not yet sure.
Both Johnny Mack and Harry An
drews have been working out in that
position,
Backfield Is Fast
The water polo team will probably
average faster man for man, than any
Stanford has had for some time. The
forward combination, already effective
at shooting the ball, should be scoring
regularly in a couple of weeks when
the men will have attained the neces
sary accuracy into their shots at the
net. The fast backfield will probably
make the California game a spectacu
lar one to watch for the guards will
be taking a swim down the tank fol
lowed by a peg at the California goal
quite regularly unless the Blue and
Gold team is several times better than
there is reason to expect.
Yale seniors voted "The Sea Hawk"
the most popular moving picture.
