### 
UNIVERSITY OF lOWA, Jan. 25 â€”
Students in Europe have not been hit
by the jazz age, according to Professor
Starbuck of the University of lowa,
who has recently returned from a trip
to the continent.
The young people of Europe, he
states, have taken modern tendencies
very seriously. Radical trends in dress,
the use of paint and rouge, and the
so-called "flapper" question have not
touched the young people of univer
sity age. Modernism, there, is con
fined to intellectualism and discussion.
Boston College's registrar has given
two students of the same name an
extra one to distinguish them.
