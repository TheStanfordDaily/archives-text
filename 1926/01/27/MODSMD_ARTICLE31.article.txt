The Illustrated Review for Febru
ary, release of which has been delayed
a week because of illness of members
of the staff, will be on sale at the
Bookstore tomorrow. There will be no
Quad sale.
The emphasis in this copy of the
Review is being placed on topics that
will particularly interest the student.
In the Christmas number, while the
articles were of universal interest, the
issue was designed primarily for the
alumni. This issue was mailed to all
members of the alumni association.
The cover of the February number
will represent a silhouette of one of
the eucalyptus trees on the road to
Roble bridge.
One of the first pictures of the new
Ryan high power laboratory which is
being constructed near Frenchman's
dam is shown.
Subscriptions for the Review for the
balance of the year may be secured at
the alumni office for $1.50.
