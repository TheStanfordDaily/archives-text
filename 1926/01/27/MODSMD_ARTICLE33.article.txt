# New Women on Probation Excluded from Rushing
## 
### 
New Women who are on probation
at the end of winter quarter shall
neither be rushed nor bid spring quar
ter according to a recent rule passed
by Panhellenic. This regulation was
made in order to co-operate with the
University in securing better scholar
ship.
This action of Panhellenic has re
ceived the approval of Dean Yost who
says regarding the rule, "It is one of
the moat public spirited things Pan
hellenic has ever done."
