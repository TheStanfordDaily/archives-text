the Stanford 130-lb. basketball squad it
I>ut on a burst of speed in the extra tl
five-minute period, and won from the A
Mountain Vie # w High School 24 to 17 is

for baskets. o
The 130's and Mountain View were a
evenly matched teams. Mountain View s
started off with a rush and shot sev- o
eral baskets while Stanford was ac- j a
cumulating one point. Then the weight 1
team revived and began making bas-j p
kets with pleasing regularity. They
gradually drew up on the Mountain t
View team, and when time was called c
they had tied the count. In the extra j 1:
five-minute period Ray made two field s
goals and Whitney and Thomas one f
apiece, while Mountain View was held i i
to one basket, Virda making a pretty \
shot from near the sidelines.
Thomas was high-point man for
Stanford with twelve markers, Ray
i with seven counters, and Whitney with j (
five completing the scoring for the f
Redshirts. Larson, who went in at
standing guard in the latter part of (
the game, played his position in an
excellent manner, taking the ball off
| the backboard and starting it on its (
j way toward the Stanford goal time
i after time. He showed the pep that .
j is needed by the Cardinal lightweights, j
|if they are to win their game with j
i the California midgets this week.
The hoopsters from McClymonds
j High School, Oakland, got away to a
| fast start, and soon rang up several .
I goals .while they held the middle-!
weights to a couple of free throws and
a field goal. Whittaker, forward, and
Kleckner, center, made some good
shots for the high school boys during
this period.
Thei Stanford team did some poor
passing and failed to start their of
fense fast enough, while the high

shots for the high school boys during

passing and failed to start their of
fense fast enough, while the high

j points that won the game.
George was high-point man for the
Stanford team with seven markers, I
while Whittaker led his squad with a

With the score standing 16-all as j
the gun signalled the end of the game, b
the Stanford 130-lb. basketball squad it
I>ut on a burst of speed in the extra tl
five-minute period, and won from the A
Mountain Vie # w High School 24 to 17 is
last night in the pavilion. The 145'b tl
lost to McClymond's High School 20
to IC, because of unskillful shooting IN
for baskets. o
The 130's and Mountain View were a
evenly matched teams. Mountain View s
started off with a rush and shot sev- o
eral baskets while Stanford was ac- j a
cumulating one point. Then the weight 1
team revived and began making bas-j p
kets with pleasing regularity. They
gradually drew up on the Mountain t
View team, and when time was called c
they had tied the count. In the extra j 1:
five-minute period Ray made two field s
goals and Whitney and Thomas one f
apiece, while Mountain View was held i i
to one basket, Virda making a pretty \
shot from near the sidelines.
Thomas was high-point man for
Stanford with twelve markers, Ray
i with seven counters, and Whitney with j (
five completing the scoring for the f
Redshirts. Larson, who went in at
standing guard in the latter part of (
the game, played his position in an
excellent manner, taking the ball off
| the backboard and starting it on its (
j way toward the Stanford goal time
i after time. He showed the pep that .
j is needed by the Cardinal lightweights, j
|if they are to win their game with j
i the California midgets this week.
The hoopsters from McClymonds
j High School, Oakland, got away to a
| fast start, and soon rang up several .
I goals .while they held the middle-!
weights to a couple of free throws and
a field goal. Whittaker, forward, and
Kleckner, center, made some good
shots for the high school boys during
