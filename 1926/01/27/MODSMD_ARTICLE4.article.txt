# "FASHION" CAST COPIES SONGS FROM OLD BOOKS
## 
### 
Old songs are included in the pro
duction of "Fashion," to be presented
Friday evening at 8:15 o'clock in the
Assembly hall. Marjorie Allen and
Fenton Barrett, who have two of the
leading roles as Seraphina and Colonel
Howard will take part in the musical
numbers. Miss Al-

len has been in
several Junior Op
eras, and was in a
song number of
"The Glee Club
Novelties."
Barrett is a mem
ber of the Glee
Club, and was in
several numbers in
the "Novelties."

Among the numbers which Miss Allen
and Barrett will sing are "We Met,"
"Call Me Pet Names, Dearest," and
"Only a Faded Flower."
Titles such as "Come, Birdie, Come,"
"Croquet," and "Not for Joe," are in
cluded in the musical repertoire. Gen
eral direction of the music has been
taken over by Reidar Torjussen. Most
of the songs are of a character which
is so entirely out of style nowadays
that they are almost impossible to
procure.
The Provincetown Players who first
revived "Fashion" have sent to Stan
ford some of the songs, and others

[ were found by Torjussen in old song
[ collections in the Stanford library.
Still others came from collections so
| valued as relics by their owners that,
the cast members had to copy the
music out of the books.
Katherine Julye, of San Francisco,
who directed the music for the San
Francisco Players Club production of
"Fashion," will be in charge of the
accompanying. Violins and harps are
to be used. Miss Julye, who wrote the
music for "Croquet," will play the
harp, and Miss Elizabeth Peirce of
Stanford, the violin. Some of the
songs belong to the

action of "Fashion,"
others are used as
specialties between
acts, so that there
will be no waits.
Costumes for the
production have
been specially de
signed by Gold
stein's, Costumer
of San Francisco.

Old brooches, cameos, earrings, and
bracelets have been lent for the oc
casion by the families of cast mem
bers. Under the direction of Leslie
Kiler the Assembly hall stage is being
remodeled to conform with the stage
conventions of the middle nineteenth
century.
