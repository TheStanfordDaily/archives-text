# VITALITY SHOWN IN HERTZ ORCHESTRA'S SYMPHONY CONCERT
## "From the New World" Gives Colorful Display of Melody, Rhythm 
### Herbert Klein 
Vitality was the outstanding char
acteristic of the San Francisco Sym
phony concert in the Assembly hall
last night. The orchestra, under the
leadership of Alfred Hertz, seemed to
give to every number a living quality
in the lyrical parts as well as in the
many stirring climaxes. Mischel Pias
tro, first violinist, received an ovation
from the audience for his masterly
and inspired playing as soloist in
Tcliaikowsky's "Concerto for Violin,
D Major," which closed the program.
Piastro gave a splendid exhibition of
well-nigh perfect technique, and artis
tic feeling of the highest order in bis
playing.
Symphony Opens Program
The "From the New World" sym
phony which opened the program with
its wealth of colorful melody and pow
erful rhythms, displayed to good ad
vantage ' the perfect unity of the
strings and the brilliance of the or
chestra's brass section. Parts of the
first movement were veritable dis
plays of rhythm. The famous "Largo,"
the second movement, contained all
extremes from the dreamy whisper of
the first negro-like melody to the over
powering volume of full orchestra.
Here, too, were some wonderful har
monic effects. The third movement
opened with a very rapid, almost wild
theme followed by a middle section of
a graceful singing quality. The rapid
rhythm returned at the close. In the
closing "Allegro" movement there was
a summing-up of various themes heard
in preceding movements that seemed
to unite the entire symphony into one.
The full orchestra played in unison
the fiery opening melody. An impres
sive finale marked the close.
"The Afternoon of a Faun," by De
bussy, was a demonstration of the ex
cellent woodwind section of the San
Francisco orchestra. These instru
ments, which have so much to do in
building the vague and misty tone pic
ture of the faun's reveries, did their
part to perfection.
Piastro Is Master
Mischel Piastro had ample oppor
tunity to display all his virtuosity in
the concerto, giving the impression of
an absolute master of his instrument
and the music. The tone of his violin
was rich and warm. His phrasing was
excellent.
The last movement, of Russian folk
dance origin, followed directly after
the second. The energy and fire which
both soloist and orchestra put into
this number was superb.
The orchestra will be heard here
next on February IG.

erful rhythms, displayed to good ad
vantage ' the perfect unity of the
strings and the brilliance of the or
chestra's brass section. Parts of the
first movement were veritable dis
plays of rhythm. The famous "Largo,"
the second movement, contained all
extremes from the dreamy whisper of
the first negro-like melody to the over
powering volume of full orchestra.
Here, too, were some wonderful har
monic effects. The third movement
opened with a very rapid, almost wild
theme followed by a middle section of
a graceful singing quality. The rapid
rhythm returned at the close. In the
closing "Allegro" movement there was
a summing-up of various themes heard
in preceding movements that seemed
to unite the entire symphony into one.
The full orchestra played in unison
the fiery opening melody. An impres
sive finale marked the close.
"The Afternoon of a Faun," by De
bussy, was a demonstration of the ex
cellent woodwind section of the San
Francisco orchestra. These instru
ments, which have so much to do in
building the vague and misty tone pic
ture of the faun's reveries, did their
part to perfection.
Piastro Is Master
Mischel Piastro had ample oppor
tunity to display all his virtuosity in
the concerto, giving the impression of
an absolute master of his instrument
and the music. The tone of his violin
was rich and warm. His phrasing was
excellent.
The last movement, of Russian folk
dance origin, followed directly after
the second. The energy and fire which
both soloist and orchestra put into
this number was superb.
The orchestra will be heard here
next on February IG.
