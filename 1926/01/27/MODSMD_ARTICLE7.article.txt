# DAVIS TO LECTURE WITH NEW METHOD ON VOLCANIC AREA
## Harvard Physiographer Will Describe Tract; Audience Must Guess Name 
### 
William Morris Davis, professor of
geology, emeritus, of Harvard Univer
sity, and lecturer this year on the
Harvard Western Circuit, will talk on
an "Interesting Volcanic Area" tonight
at 7:30 o'clock in Room 320.
The method to be used in present
ing this lecture is based on a descrip
tion of the area, withholding the name
of it, so that the audience must guess
where it is from the data presented.
He will include the relation of the
geology and geography of the area to
the activities going on there under
human control.
Professor Davis, one of the leading
authorities on physiographic geology
in the world today, has made a note
worthy record. He was early associ
ated with the development of physi
ography in America, and through his
own observations added several valu
able concepts to the science.
In 1912 he conducted an expedition,
composed of leading European and
American geologists and geographers,
through the entire United States. He
has made several trips to Turkestan,
Persia, South Africa, Australia, and
New Zealand. He is particularly in
terested in the origin of the moun
tains of the western part of the United
States.
Dr. Davis' work at Stanford this
quarter has consisted of seminars Willi
graduate students in geology upon sub
jects related to physiography.
All who are interested are invited
to the lecture tonight. The topic will
be expanded with non-technical terms.
