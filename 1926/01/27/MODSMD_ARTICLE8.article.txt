be held especially for mechanical and
electrical engineering students and for
students who intend to enter these
two departments.
Committees are now at work arrang
ing for speakers and entertainment.
Since the Stanford Branches of the
American Society of Mechanical Engi
neers, and the American Institute of
Electrical Engineers represent the
largest engineering organizations in
the country the smoker will be of
considerable importance in engineer
ing circles. It will also enable lower
division students who intend to major
