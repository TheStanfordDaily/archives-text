# STANFORD TEAM UNDERGOING WEEK OF HARD TRAINING
## STEELE MAY BE ELIGIBLE Victory Over U.S.C. Enhances Cards' Prospect for Bear Game 
### Jim Adams 
With the California game only three
days away the Stanford basketball
team is earnestly engaged in laying a
snare for the unsuspecting Bears that
will migrate down to the Stanford
"Farm" Saturday night. Encouraged by
their victory over U.S.C., the Cards
, are confident that with a week of
j hard work they can meet the already
; proven Blue and Gold squad on almost
j even terms.
There is still some doubt as to Gur
i don Steele's eligibility but it is ex
pected that he will be declared in good
; standing tomorrow. W-hat use Kerr
| will make of the big center is not
i known but it is probable that Jayred
will start and Steele will be slipped in
i at the first sign of the former slowing
j down. Jayred plays a good fast game
j at center for a short time but tires
; easily and so a reliable substitute will
| be of great use.
The first five scrimmaged against a
I scrub team using the California offense
i last night. The Bears have played a
man in the hole to great advantage
! this season and the success of the
j Cards against them will depend great
ly on what check they can place on
i this style of play.
Vincenti seems to have won a first
team berth at running guard, although
Mitchell will no doubt be used con
siderably also. There is a possibility
i of Kerr making a shift in his forward
: positions as Clark, by his continual
I improvement, is making, a strong bid
! for a regular job.
As a result of constant drill Kerr
! has finally developed pretty fair team
work among the team. Less juggling
I of the ball and more accurate passing
was especially noticeable in the game
I with the Trojans. Saturday night
should see a smooth-working five of
Redshirts and if they can find the
; basket it can be safely predicted that
i the Bears will be in for a tough time.
