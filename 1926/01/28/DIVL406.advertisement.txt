IT'S THE CUT OF YOUR CLOTHES THAT COUNTS
Piping Rock Flannel
for your next suit
Comfort! It's the most comfortable fabric a man ever got
into. All good flannels are easy to wear, but Piping Rock is
more so. You can tell that the moment you see one, from
its beautiful texture, its silky finish. And there's nothing
that tailors like quite so well. Lastly, the colorings—those
clear, positive shades you don't see in any other cloth. And
a great range of them. Piping Rock Flannels—originated by
and exclusive with—Society Brand.
