# ENCINA 4E SCORES SHUTOUT WIN OVER FIRST FLOOR SQUAD
## Sigma Chi Takes Close Game From Encina 2W; Zetes Lose to Theta Chi 
### Clif Moore 
Displaying one of the fastest of
fenses seen in this year's series, En
cina 4E defeated Encina 1W yester
day in the intramural basketball tour
nament. The fourth-floor frosh five
won the game, 22 to 0, marking up the
third shut-out game recorded in the
tourney. Theta Chi defeated Zeta Psi,
25 to 6; Sequoia II beat Theta Delta
Chi, 11 to 5; and Sigma Chi won a
close game from Encina 2W, 11 to 10.
Kappa Alpha forfeited to the Breakers.

Encina 4E played an exceptionally
clever passing game against the first
floor players. The winners' teamwork
was almost perfect; and time after
time they worked the ball down the
court by means of accurate passing
that resulted in baskets from short
shots under the goal. Encina 1W
played raggedly throughout the entire
game, and was no match for the clever
fourth floor quintet.
Bowers, 4E forward, was the out
standing star of the game. He was the
leader of the offense, and made nine
field goals. Deltrich played a nice
game at standing guard for 41, and
his stellar defensive work was re
sponsible for the opponents' shutout.
Zets Off Form
Zeta Psi, regarded as one of the
strongest teams in League I, had an
off day against Theta Chi, and were
defeated by a large score. Theta Chi
played good basketball and seemed
too fast for the heavier Zete combina
tion. The losers had a good many
chances at the basket but seemed to
tally unable to connect for points.
Green, Theta Chi forward, was high
point scorer with 3 field goals. Hoff
man, playing center for the Zetes,
showed to advantage, and is credited
with two baskets.
Sigma Chi Wins Thriller
Sigma Chi and Encina 2W staged
a regular battle in a closely played
contest that finally ended in an 11 to
10 decision for the fraternity team.
Brady's long field goal near the end
of the game decided the issue for
Sigma Chi. The score at half time was
8 to 3 for Encina.
The Row quintet played a much
faster game in the last period, and
made two baskets within a minute
after the start of the half.
Brady, Sigma Chi center, took high
point honors with 5 markers. Snyder,
running guard for the freshmen, dis
played the best individual prowess of
any player on the floor. He made two
baskets, both from nearly center. Mc-
Clellan, at standing guard for the fra
ternity team, did some effective guard
ing.
Theta Delts Lose
The Sequoia 11-Theta Delt tussle
was raggedly played, and neither team
displayed any great knowledge of the
game. Flashes of good basketball were
shown at times, but good passing work
was usually offset by poor shooting.
Numerous fouls were called, with both
sides offending about evenly.
Mack, Sequoia forward, made two
field goals and three free throws for
a total of seven points.
Following are the games on tomor
row's schedule:
Alpha Delta Phi vs. Encina IE at
4:15.
Theta Xi vs. Phi Kappa Psi at 4:50.
