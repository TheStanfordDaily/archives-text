# NEW ACTORS WILL PLAY IN MASQUERS COMEDY, "FASHION"
## Five to Make Campus Debut; Song Numbers Have Big Part in Production 
### 
Several new actors in the cast of
"Fashion," to be produced tomorrow
evening in the Assembly hall at 8:15
o'clock, will be introduced to campus
theatregoers. Edward Smith, Paul Ten
ney, Felton Kaufmann, Sydney Gray,
and George Mauser will all appear for
the first time on the Stanford stage.
Fenton Barrett and Cecil Doll have
taken part in dramatics before; Bar
rett is remembered for his work in
"Ace High," the 1926 Junior Opera,
and Cecil Doll for his character work
in "In the Next Room," produced last
quarter.
Tiffany in Distress
Smith will play Mr. Tiffany, the hus
band of Mrs. Tiffany (Patrice Nau
man). Mrs. Tiffany's extravagances in
attempting to climb the social ladder
and marry off her daughter Seraphina
cause Mr. Tiffany much distress, and
eventually lead to difficulties with his
clerk, Mr. Snobson, the villain. George
Mauser plays Mr. Snobson very well.
He does especially good work in the
third act, and has one of the best
songs, "Not For Joe."
Count Joli Maitre, believed by Mrs.
Tiffany to be all that is socially de
sirable, will be played by Paul Tenney.
Tenney took part in the recent Glee
Club "Novelties." The roles of Augus
tus Fogg and T. Tennyson Twinkle
will be taken by Sydney Gray and
Felton Kaufmann.
Music Important
Barrett, Tenney, Kaufmann, and
George Mauser are members of the
Glee Club. Since song specialties will
be important in "Fashion," the selec
tion of cast members who have trained
voices is fortunate.
Aileene Burks as Millinette has a
part which is different from other roles
which she has played. Millinette is the
French maid employed by Mrs. Tif
fany, and her knowledge of the past
of Count Joli Maitre allows her an
opportunity to make herself an im
portant member of the household. Mar
jorie Allen, Peggy Randall, and Pa
trice Nauman will take the other femi
nine roles.
The curtain which has been pro
cured for the production of "Fashion"
has been imported from San Francisco,
and following the style of the period
when the play was first given, depicts
a female figure and is entitled "Happy
Idle Hours." Under the direction of
Leslie Kiler the painted furniture,
which is a part of the scenery, is
nearing completion.

"Ace High," the 1926 Junior Opera,
and Cecil Doll for his character work
in "In the Next Room," produced last
quarter.
Tiffany in Distress
Smith will play Mr. Tiffany, the hus
band of Mrs. Tiffany (Patrice Nau
man). Mrs. Tiffany's extravagances in
attempting to climb the social ladder
and marry off her daughter Seraphina
cause Mr. Tiffany much distress, and
eventually lead to difficulties with his
clerk, Mr. Snobson, the villain. George
Mauser plays Mr. Snobson very well.
He does especially good work in the
third act, and has one of the best
songs, "Not For Joe."
Count Joli Maitre, believed by Mrs.
Tiffany to be all that is socially de
sirable, will be played by Paul Tenney.
Tenney took part in the recent Glee
Club "Novelties." The roles of Augus
tus Fogg and T. Tennyson Twinkle
will be taken by Sydney Gray and
Felton Kaufmann.
Music Important
Barrett, Tenney, Kaufmann, and
George Mauser are members of the
Glee Club. Since song specialties will
be important in "Fashion," the selec
tion of cast members who have trained
voices is fortunate.
Aileene Burks as Millinette has a
part which is different from other roles
which she has played. Millinette is the
French maid employed by Mrs. Tif
fany, and her knowledge of the past
of Count Joli Maitre allows her an
opportunity to make herself an im
portant member of the household. Mar
jorie Allen, Peggy Randall, and Pa
trice Nauman will take the other femi
nine roles.
The curtain which has been pro
cured for the production of "Fashion"
has been imported from San Francisco,
and following the style of the period
when the play was first given, depicts
a female figure and is entitled "Happy
Idle Hours." Under the direction of
Leslie Kiler the painted furniture,
which is a part of the scenery, is
nearing completion.
