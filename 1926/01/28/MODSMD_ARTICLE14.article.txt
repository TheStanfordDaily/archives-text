# SUNSPOTS VISIBLE TO NAKED EYE BY SMOKED GLASSES
## Rotation of Sun Will Cause Disappearance of Blots At End of Week 
### 
Several sunspots, including one of
unusual size which is visible to the
naked eye, have been observed this
week by Nelson P. Case, instructor in
astronomy. As the maximum period
of these phenomena has been reached,
they will be shadowing the sun for
the remainder of the week, when the
I
bodies will be lost to view through the
rotation of the sun.

Members of the astronomy class
were the first persons in the vicinity
of the campus to notice this unusual
occurrence. While on the way to at
tend their eight o'clock class, several
amateur star-gazers were puzzled
when they discovered the blots.

The largest of these sunspots has a
diameter of approximately 75,000 miles
and is about one-fifteenth of the sun's
diameter, according to computations
made by Case. A number of the bodies
may be seen through smoked glasses;
the largest can be observed through
the haze of early morning.

Sunspots are caused by circulatory
movements of gases from the interior
of the sun to the surface during the
heating and cooling processes and are
present now at their maximum, ac
cording to Case. This period occurs
every 11.1 years and is being observed
by the Mount Wilson and Lick ob
servatories.
Case is lecturing in astronomy this
quarter during the absence of Profes
sor Sidney D. Townley, who is now
acting professor of astronomy at Har
vard University.
