# STANFORD MERMEN SHOW PROMISE FOR MEET WITH BRUINS
## 
### Herb Klein 
For the California meet, scheduled
I for March 5, Ernst Brandsten, coach
I of the Stanford swimming team, has
a wealth of material, with stars in
I all events.
In the sprints there is an amazing
i array of talent. There are, for in
i
j stance, at least ten men now swim
ming regularly at the Encina pool who
can do the hundred free-style in one
minute or less: Wally O'Connor, Arden
Allen, Bob Williams, Carl Stevenson,
Phil Brooks, Bill Danford, Colin Smith,
and A1 and Andy Christensen. O'Con
nor, who was on the last Olympic re
lay team, does his century around 56
seconds; /fllen, captain of this year's
' water polo team, around 57, with Wil
! liams, Stevenson, and Smith close be
, hind.
The squad has already broken, in
j practice, both the 400- and 800-foot
J relay records. The old record in the
| 400-foot relay is 1:06 1-5, and the
team has already done 1:05 1-5 this
I ouarter, with every indication that the
mark will be considerably bettered in
the Berkeley meet. The present Pacific
Association record in the 800-foot re
lay is 2:28 3-5, which was unofficially
i shattered at the pool last Saturday to
the tune of 2:27 2-5.
Carl Stevenson will again be the
Cardinal star in the 220 free-style. He
seems to develop constantly and now
goes the furlong in 2:26. He can also
swim in the backstroke if needed to
' cinch a second place to Allen's first.
There seems little reason to doubt
J that Allen will break the 100-yard back
stroke record, for he goes several sec
i ends under the mark easily in prac
j tice. Since the meet last year he has
I rounded out his list of strokes by
becoming a first-class breast-stroker,
making the 100 in 1:17 or better. He
will probably not swim in this event
j unless California has a fast man in
j (lie breast-stroke.
