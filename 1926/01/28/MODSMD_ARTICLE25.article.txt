# Are Colleges Worth Their Keep?

That American colleges are not really worth their keep to the demo
cratic masses whose labor supports them and that they «ire not producing'
men and women imbued with the noblest American ideals and traditions
seems to be the opinion expressed in a recent story in The New Student.
To quote The New Student:
"No automobile factory could survive if it turned out such relatively
few numbers of good motor cars as the American colleges turn out
relatively few numbers of capable, educated, cultivated and happy men
. . . . American industries are forced by economic pressure to produce
something of real value to mankind.
"Compare, for a moment, the American college to an American auto
mobile plant or cannery. Assume that the colleges are implicitly designed
to take the raw material of human intelligence and to equip it to live
satisfactorily, happily, and nobly in an ever more complicated and more
highly evolved civilization.
"The iron ore fed into a modern steel plant comes out useful steel.
The youth and intelligence fed into an American university should come
out useful and noble material. It comes out, rather, the froth of
plutocracy.
"America flaunted in the face of the world great aspirations—aspira
tions clearly voiced by scores of men. America represents one of the
most dominant forces in the life of mankind. Its wealth, its power are
helping to shape and mold all the world. Mankind today possesses a
great body of exact knowledge, the basic essentials of which can with
relative ease be given to every man or woman who will take them. Such
instruction frees and ennobles the persons receiving it and enlarges their
conception of the value and the meaning of the great adventure of life,
equips them properly to live complete lives, to be happy and harmonious
in their social relations, to help bring a better world into being.
"Are these institutions really worth their keep to the democratic
masses whose labor supports them ? Are they producing men and women
imbued with the noblest American ideals and traditions? Do they repre
sent a true expression of America, or rather an expression of tendencies
and purposes inimical to all that America has stood for?"'
Granting that the average American university is not perfect, still
we must admit that it is the only kind of university we have and that it
is filling a very necessary place in the United States at the present time,
and if it weren't for the colleges real progress would be very slow.
