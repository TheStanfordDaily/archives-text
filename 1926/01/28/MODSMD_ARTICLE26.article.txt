# "Siegfried"
## 
### 
The Dramatic Council has completed arrangements whereby the film
version of "Siegfried" will be shown on the campus next Wednesday
evening. This great German epic is a great and unusual picture, one of
appalling grandeur, and quite different from the everyday film,
"Siegfried" was originally a Wagnerian opera, and the film carries
the same appeal, primarily by reason of the magnitude of its production
and the fascination of its legendary story. A beautiful love story is
blended with a tale of dragons and dwarfs.
The Dramatic Council has secured this picture only after surmounting
considerable difficulties, and it is only fitting that its efforts should be
rewarded by the whole-hearted support of the student body.

Sudden collapse of joy in library at Spokane College, as per interview
with the Spokane College Echo:
"We must go about meeting this problem in a serious way," stated Henry
Howard, a member of the vigilance committee in charge of maintaining order
in the library. "Personally I don't get a kick out of watching a bunch of
students who have to act like babies all the time."

Many-faced faculty discovered by the Pacific University Index:
"The students and the faculty enjoyer an informal get-together in the

Cruel words hurled at ambitious junior Greeks by one William F. llol
man, president of the Inter fraternity council at the University of Min

"High school fraternities arc an abomination. There is no reason on cartli for
them. They do no good whatever and almost invariably are bad."

Winsome item of glad tidings found in the Oklahoma Daily under the
heading,."Charleston Still Hot":
""The success of the Charleston dancc of course was assured before, hut a little
while ago somebody else discovered that it would reduce the hips, and so now instead
of dying out and fading away like the ultimate petals of the Last Rose of Summer,
it is doomed to live on unquenched."
