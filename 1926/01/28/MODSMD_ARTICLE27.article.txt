JUST OUT
Cabbages has just acquired
a rare first edition; it is none
other than a copy of rules for
girls in Roble Hall. No copies
are permitted outside the
building, but in this case a
bribe to the printer brought
these lucrative results:
Rules for Quarterly Visitors at Roble
Hall—Drawn Up and Devised by
My Opal Appal, of the
Intelligensia
1. Be yourself. (Motto of the Girls
League for the Suppression of Flesh-
Colored Lipstick.)
2. Girls fond of driving will find a
list of fraternity numbers in the booth
in the hall. If this means proves un
successful, a hammer and nail will be
found in the closet.
3. If the room gets too warm, open j
the window and see the fire escape.
4. Girls fond of jumping are invited
to lift the mattress and watch the bed i
spring.
5. Girls seeking dates may find them
in the store in the basement.
6. Girls troubled with the nightmare
will find a halter under the bed.
7. Don't worry about paying your
bills; the house is supported by a
foundation.

We suggest that a special day be
set aside for entertaining the crews
of the local trains that leave San Fran
cisco at 2:30 a.m. and 6:30 a.m., re
spectively, in order that the trainmen
may gain a good impression of the
University. —J. s.
