a serips of graphic lines drawn from
1e glorious and unblemished history

Cabbages respectfully submits the

following snack of kittenish conversa
tion which took place recently between
two freshman women, one from the
University of California, and the other
from Stanford:
Louise (U.C. '29) —Is that the way
you wear your hats at Stanford? We
don't think that is collegiate at Cal.
Frances (Stanford '29) —Is that so?
How interesting. Well, if you wore
them this way at Cal you don't think
we would wear them the same way at
Stanford, do you?"
Exit both —Meow, meow, meow.
