# ROME VOLCANIC DISTRICT DESCRIBED IN DA VIS TALK
## 
### 
Introducing a new method of lectur
ing to a campus audience, William
Morris Davis spoke on his "mystery
topic," "Rome," last night in the
Geology building to appreciative lis
teners. His method, that of describing
the physiographic features of the dis
trict, and then asking the,audience to
guess its name, met with approval.
The actual guessing was aided by the
hints he threw out in the way of
literary allusions.

Aided by a graphic drawing of the
region he was to explain. Dr. Davis
began by showing the mountains and
the plain, upon which four volcanic
craters stood. By developing this origi
nal drawing he showed that the rivers,
blocked by the formation of these vol
canoes, united in a lake and finally

wore away a valley exit. In the valley
cut by the escaping water, a city was
built.
13y bringing out that "all roads
should lead to such a place," and that
"seven hills of villages would make
quite a city," that such a city would
be "eternal," and that anyone should
"do as they do," Dr. Davis showed
that the place he was describing was
Rome.
In concluding his talk, Professor
Davis stated that the ordinary method
of travel could be augmented by the
addition of new facts gleaned by ob
servation of the condition and type of
landscape being passed through. He
hoped, he said, that his audience had
gained a new concept of the location
of Rome.
