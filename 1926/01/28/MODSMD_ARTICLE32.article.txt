# CALIFORNIA QUINTET HAS CLEAN RECORD FOR EARLY SEASON
## 
### Jim Adams 
In the California basketball team
the Stanford five will have for its op
ponents in its second conference game,
Saturday night in the pavilion, last
ye ar's Pacific Coast Conference Cham
pions and an aggregation which at
present is making the strongest bid
for the same honors of,any team on
the Coast. The Bears have not tasted
defeat this season, although they have
met some of the strongest teams in
the northern part of the state, as well
as the Trojan cagers
Last Tuesday night the Bears de
feated the Davis Farm squad by the
good score of 33 to 13. Coach Nibs
Price took the opportunity to give his
substitutes a workout to have them
in shape to be called, if necessary,
into the Stanford game. Although the
California team as a whole was off
form, Captain Benny Holmes came
into his own for the first time this
season. His playing up to this time
has been far below his usual stand
ard but if his comeback Tuesday
means that he is now back to form,
the Cards are given an additional man
to worry about.
Miggins Is Star
Higgins, all-coast center last year,
will be the individual that will give
the Redshirts the most trouble. This
clever player stands about six feet
three, which gives him a height that
is of particular value in getting the
ball off the backboard as well as
dropping it through the basket. Un
usual for a big man, Higgins is also a
shifty dribbler and a fast, steady floor
man. In nearly all the California games
to date he has held high-point honors
for the Bears. His shooting eye is not
confined to close range, but is ex
tended to a point where he is danger
ous with the ball whenever within a
reasonable distance.
Watson, who is paired with Captain
Holmes at forward, is the second best
shot to Higgins on the team. He is a
fast, heady player and when Holmes
is in form, the two make a clever com
bination that is hard to stop. In addi
tion to these two, Coach Price has
Butts, who can be used with slight
weakening of the lineup.
Carver Experienced Guard
George Dixon and Carver are the
regular guards. Carver has had two
years of varsity experience. He is
playing a different style of game this j
year; instead of playing back as a!
standing guard, he follows the ball on I
the offense to about the middle of
the floor. From this position he was
able to make eight points in one of
the U.S.C. games. Dixon plays about
the same style of game, although he
doesn't come up to the calibre of
Carver. This is his first year of varsity
experience, but he has played a great
deal of basketball.

Even if Higgins was out of the game
Coach Price would not have much to
worry about, because in Peterson, star
of last year's frosh team, he has a
promising player who fits in with the
regulars very nicely.

Off and on the Bears use a four-man
defense, keeping one of the forwards
back to be the foundation for the of
fensive play when they get the ball.
When a team hasn't a proper defense
for this style it is very harassing,
as was shown in the Stanford-Olympic
Club game.
