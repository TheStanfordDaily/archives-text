# NEW SEISOMETRIC STATION WILL BE BUILT AT STANFORD
## 
### 
In -conjunction with the Carnegie
Institution of Washington the Seismo
logical Society of America has se
cured the promise of funds for the
upkeep of four seismometric stations
to be located at Stanford University,
the University of California, Lick Ob
servatory at Mt. Hamilton, and at the
California Academy of Sciences at San
Francisco.
President Campbell of the Univer
sity of California has agreed to ap
propriate $2000 per annum for the up
keep of the instruments at Berkeley
and Lick Observatory, and for the
study of all the records. President Wil
bur of Stanford and Dr. Evermann of
the Academy of Sciences have made
similar promises so that the mainten
ance of the stations and the gathering
of results are assured.

The seismometer is a modern in
strument that registers nearby micro
tremors or miscroscopic earthquakes.
One of these instruments set up at the
Mount Wilson Observatory Labora
tories regularly picked up the starting
of an electric car three miles away by
recording the vibrations which the
movement sent through the elastic
rocks to the foundations of the build
ing in which it was installed.

The instrument was invented by Dr.
H. O. Wood, the seismologist, and Dr.
J. A. Anderson, the physicist, at the
instigation of the Carnegie Institution.
It consists of a fine wire stretched by
a weight ,witli a bit of copper wire
fastened to one Bide of it, and a mir
ror attached to the copper. The first
wire is the thickness of the finest
spider web, is about six inches long,
and is made of tungsten steel. The
bit of copper wire is a half inch long
and about a tenth of an inch in diame
ter. The latter being placed on the
side of the steel wire causes it to
twist when disturbed and the instru
ment is called, therefore, a tortion
seismometer. The record is made by a
mirror, attached to the copper wire,
which concentrates a beam of light on
a rotating drum, covered with photo
graphic paper, on which the point of
light traces a record. As long as there
is no disturbance, the line is straight,
but upon disturbance a sharp zig-zag
figure is made by the vibrations of
the wire.
These instruments are installed at
the stations, which are known dis
tances apart. When an earthquake
shock starts from a center within sixty
miles of these stations, it will be
registered by them. Since the pre
liminary shock, coming directly from
the origin through the rock to the
station travels at the rate of 3.§ miles
per second, while the surface shock,
traveling along the surface of the
earth moves at a rate of two miles
per second, there is an interval be
tween the arrival of the first and the
second shock which is registered on

the machine. By computations from
this it can be determined how far the
origin is from the station. By a similar
process, distances from the other sta
tions can be measured, and the loca
tion of the center determined.

miles of these stations, it will be
registered by them. Since the pre
liminary shock, coming directly from
the origin through the rock to the
station travels at the rate of 3.§ miles
per second, while the surface shock,
traveling along the surface of the
earth moves at a rate of two miles
per second, there is an interval be
tween the arrival of the first and the
second shock which is registered on

the machine. By computations from
this it can be determined how far the
origin is from the station. By a similar
process, distances from the other sta
tions can be measured, and the loca
tion of the center determined.
In -conjunction with the Carnegie
Institution of Washington the Seismo
logical Society of America has se
cured the promise of funds for the
upkeep of four seismometric stations
to be located at Stanford University,
the University of California, Lick Ob
servatory at Mt. Hamilton, and at the
California Academy of Sciences at San
Francisco.
President Campbell of the Univer
sity of California has agreed to ap
propriate $2000 per annum for the up
keep of the instruments at Berkeley
and Lick Observatory, and for the
study of all the records. President Wil
bur of Stanford and Dr. Evermann of
the Academy of Sciences have made
similar promises so that the mainten
ance of the stations and the gathering
of results are assured.

The seismometer is a modern in
strument that registers nearby micro
tremors or miscroscopic earthquakes.
One of these instruments set up at the
Mount Wilson Observatory Labora
tories regularly picked up the starting
of an electric car three miles away by
recording the vibrations which the
movement sent through the elastic
rocks to the foundations of the build
ing in which it was installed.

The instrument was invented by Dr.
H. O. Wood, the seismologist, and Dr.
J. A. Anderson, the physicist, at the
instigation of the Carnegie Institution.
It consists of a fine wire stretched by
a weight ,witli a bit of copper wire
fastened to one Bide of it, and a mir
ror attached to the copper. The first
wire is the thickness of the finest
spider web, is about six inches long,
and is made of tungsten steel. The
bit of copper wire is a half inch long
and about a tenth of an inch in diame
ter. The latter being placed on the
side of the steel wire causes it to
twist when disturbed and the instru
ment is called, therefore, a tortion
seismometer. The record is made by a
mirror, attached to the copper wire,
which concentrates a beam of light on
a rotating drum, covered with photo
graphic paper, on which the point of
light traces a record. As long as there
is no disturbance, the line is straight,
but upon disturbance a sharp zig-zag
figure is made by the vibrations of
the wire.
These instruments are installed at
the stations, which are known dis
tances apart. When an earthquake
shock starts from a center within sixty
miles of these stations, it will be
registered by them. Since the pre
liminary shock, coming directly from
the origin through the rock to the
station travels at the rate of 3.§ miles
per second, while the surface shock,
traveling along the surface of the
