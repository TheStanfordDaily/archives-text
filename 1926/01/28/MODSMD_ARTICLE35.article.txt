## 
### 
Lack of application was accounted
the largest single factor In the failure
ot college students by Joseph F. Bar
low of the New York University in an

interview given on the subject recent
ly. The decided change in environ
ment, ignorance of the amount of 1 work
required for good marks, and the fact
that a few students who made high
records in high school are meJntally
unable to do college work were addi
tional causes of student-failure sug
gested by other professors of the uni
versity.
"The first year in college is a pro
bationary period; all those who pass
the required work in their first year
demonstrate their ability to acquire
a degree," Mr. Barlow stated.
L. B. Fenneman, instructor in gov
ernment, said on this topic that some
students haven't the ability to enter
outside activities and do college work
at the same time. However, the good
atlllete, he added, can generally do
good enough work to keep out of the
danger zone. Any man with average
ability should not fail if he applies
himself. Required subjects are good
mental discipline, Professor Fenneman
believes, and failure in them indicates
inability to go on with college work.
