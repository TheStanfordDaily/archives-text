# FRESHMAN CAGERS SHOW IMPROVEMENT IN FINAL PRACTICE
## 
### Clif McDowell 
Coach Husky Hunt's Stanford fresh
man basketball team held their last
practice yesterday afternoon in pre
paration for the game with the Cali
fornia freshmen in the pavilion tomor
row night. Hard practice was the
schedule for the early part of the week,
and the babes are now resting before
the start of their final series.

Considerable time has been spent
by Hunt in developing his team de
fensively, and a great improvement
has been noted in this department.

California is reputed to have a
strong freshman quintet and will enter
the game the favorite by a slight mar
gin. The Bear Cubs are a heavier team
than the frosh, but it is doubtful if
they are as fast. The California frosh
have made an impressive showing in
their practice season, running up large
scores in every game. The Blue and
Gold also has a decided advantage in
its large reserve force.

Wyatt and Dougery have done most
of the work at the forward positions
and Corbin has been holding down the
center job. Gregory and Eisen are
about evenly matched for the running
guard position, and Clymer has
cinched the job of standing guard.
Killian has also been used at running
guard in Gregory's place with the lat
ter shifted to center.

Hunt was well pleased with the
showing the frosh made against the
Stockton High School team last Satur
day night and is expecting the game
tomorrow night to be a nip-and-tuck
affair, with little advantage on either
side.
