## 
### 
Ursula Greville, English soprano,
will give a recital in the Assembly
ball Tuesday as part of the Com
mittee on Public Exercises' series of
Tuesday evening events. Miss Gre
ville is one of the younger group of
singers, having made her debut in
1920, but she has already taken many
notable parts in opera and gained
widespread recognition for her con
cert work. Her accomplishments are
not confined to vocal art as she has
been editor of "The Sackbut," a promi
nent musical periodical, for several
years.
Immediately after Miss Greville's
debut in concert work she was en
gaged to sing the role of "Queen of
the Night" in Mozart's opera, "The
Magic Flute." Later she toured the
British Isles, Germany, Austria, and
Spain. On this tour she was soloist
with the Vienna Philharmonic Orches
tra at one of their concerts. Her
American debut was in 1922. After
this followed a period of study and
training in Italy until December 1924
when she returned to New York for
the opening concert of the Interna
tional Composers Guild,- later appear
ing as soloist with the New York State
Symphony Orchestra.

Deems Taylor, critics of the New
York World, and a prominent com
poser, wrote of her appearance with
the State Symphony in Carnegie Hall:
"Ursula Greville, who varies the grind
ot editing 'The Sackbut,' one of the
world's very few readable musical
periodicals, by spreading the gospel
of the unhackneyed through Europe
and America, sang two old and very
beautiful airs .... with distinction
and impressive command of mood."
