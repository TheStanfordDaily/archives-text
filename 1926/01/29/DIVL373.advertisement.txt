HIGH GRADE
MEATS
Miss Sorority and Mr. Fraternity,
we particularly address this ad
vertisement to you because we
know we sell the kind of meats
you are accustomed to when
home. We sell the highest
grade meats every day in the
year. For over a quarter of a cen
tury we have been purveyors of
fancy meats to the residents of
Stanford University and vicinity.
And our prices are just as low
for what you get as any place
in town. At the end of the month
your bill will surely be no bifcger
than if you bought meats of a
quality other than the best. Your
account is solicited; you will ap
preciate our kind of meat and
service.
