Mrs. Tiffany, and Miss Nauman will

ney, Edward Smith, Felton Kaufmann,

harp, and Miss Elizabeth Peirce of

In order to create the atmosphere
of the 40's when the play was origi
nally produced no. pains have been
spared by the technical directors. Les
lie Kiler and his staff have completely

and put in candle footlights. Painted

Stage Remodeled

nally produced no. pains have been
spared by the technical directors. Les
lie Kiler and his staff have completely

and put in candle footlights. Painted
furniture will take the place of modern
stage requisites, and an old curtain
has been procured from San Fran
cisco to carry out the effect.

for this performance. Costume and
chorus work is under the supervision
of Chrysella Dunker Kiler.
A 1 o'clock dance in the Women's
Clubhouse with Harold Todd's orches
tra furnishing the music will follow

formance of "Fashion" to be produced
this evening in the Assembly hall at
S:l5 o'clock, will be placed on sale at
the box office at 7 o'clock.
Dress rehearsal which ran off smooth
ly last evening under the direction of
Gordon Davis, dramatic coach, further
insured the success of the revival of
this quaint old comedy under the au
spices of Masquers Society.
For the first time in several years
the Masquers play has roles which
allow the participation of most of the
members of its society. Peggy Ran
dall, Marjorie Allen, Aileene Burks,
and Patrice Nauman are all experi
enced actresses who are familiar to
campus playgoers, both by reason of
their talent and by the many roles
which they have created during the
past few seasons.
Randall Has Lead
Miss Randall has the lead as Ger
trude, the governess in the home of
Mrs. Tiffany, and Miss Nauman will
take the role of Mrs. Tiffany. Miss
Allen will play Seraphina, Mrs. Tif
fany's daughter, and Miss Burks will
be Millinette, an interesting character
bit which is different from other roles
which she has taken.
Fenton Barrett, Cecil Doll, Paul Ten
ney, Edward Smith, Felton Kaufmann,
George Mauser, and Sydney Gray will
take the male roles.
Old songs by various members of I
the company and by the cast as a
whole for curtain acts will be included !
in the program. A chorus of five mem- j
hers with Doris Bonner, Vida Hays,
Katherine Kamm, Nelty Lefranc, and
Margretta Stroup will appear in the
ballroom scene in the second act and
also in a curtain act.
