# U.S.C. RETIRES FOR TWO WEEKS' PRACTICE
## 
### 
I U.S.C., Jan. 28. â€”Now that both Cali
, fornia and Stanford have romped mer
rily over the Trojan cagers, the South
ern Californians will retire from the
limelight for the period of two weeks,
i When they from the solitude
;of their own gymnasium they will
i have gone through a period of inten
sive work and will be set to meet
both the Hears and the Cards in return
games here.
Trojan fans, while entertaining little
hope that the U.S.C. team can defeat
I the two northern opponents, believe
the games will be much closer and
thrilling than were the three games to
i date with Stanford and California.
