# FRESHMAN FIVE READY FOR CALIFORNIA GAME
## 
### Clif McDowell 
Stanford's freshman basketball team
will meet its California rivals in the
pavilion tonight in the first game of
their annual series, and will be fight
ing to avenge the defeat the Bear
Cubs meted out in football last fall.
From the outlook it appears that the
two teams will meet on an almost
even basis, with a slight advantage on
the side of the visitors.
California has won all of her games,
and the Cardinal babes have also
come through with a clean slate. The
showing of the Blue and Gold frosh
has ben more impressive, however, as
they have run up large scores in each
game. California has the advantage
on the matter of reserve strength.
Wyatt and Dougery have been doing
most of the work at the forward posi
tions. Corbin is the best center the
Cubs have, although Killian, who is a
guard, can jump at center when ne
cessary. Clymer has maintained the
standing guard position through the
practice season and is scheduled to
start in that place. Gregory and Eisen
have been fighting it out for the other
guard position along with Killian.
Stockton Defeated
Coach Hunt's team made an excel
lent showing last Saturday night when
they defeated the strong Stockton
High School team. Three of the play
ers on the Stockton team have played
together for three seasons and were
on the State Championship team last
year. Husky's strongest team has been
with Sexson and Crary at the forward
positions, McCandless at center, and
Lewis and Worden at the guards. Sex
son has played consistently good bas
ketball throughout the season. Crary

got off to a bad start, but seems to
have hit his stride in the last two
games.
McCandless has been the outstand
ing star of the team, coming out with
: high-point honors in every game. His
floor game is excellent and he is the 1
best shot 011 the squad. Lewis, Wor- j
den, and Marks have been doing the !
defensive work at the guard positions.
There is little difference between
Wor&en and Marks, and both will'
probably be used in the game tonight.
Marks is also able to play forward |
| when called upon. Sibbetts, Wilton,
| and Osmonson have also shown good |
\ form at forward in practice games, j
I Kopp has substituted for McCandless
at center in the early season games j
| and is ready to step in at this posi- j
I tion.
No practice was held by Hunt yes
i terday or today and the babes will
I start the game tonight in excellent
condition. The squad has been free
from injuries this seasop, with the
exception of Marks, who injured his
ankle two weeks ago. He is recovered
j now and will undoubtedly be in the '
game.
Coach Hunt said yesterday, "The j
California freshmen have a good |
team, but the game Friday night will
be close. I expect the frosh to make
a good showing, and they are set to
win."
The probable starting lineups:
Stanford — California —
! Sexson F Wyatt
Crary F Dougeryj
