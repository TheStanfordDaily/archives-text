# WEIGHT TEAM GAMES TO PRECEDE FROSH, VARSITY ENCOUNTERS
## 
### 
Preliminary to the California-Stan
ford freshman basketball game in the
pavilion tonight, the 130-pound teams
of the two universities will clash in
the first contest of their series. To
morrow night the squads representing
the 145-pound division will battle each
other as a curtain-raiser for the var
sity struggle.
According to Coach Hal Davis, both
of the Stanford outfits seem to be bet
ter teams than they were last year.
Although several stars were lost by
graduation, the teamwork shows im
provement over that of the last sea
son or so. The passing and shooting
of the Stanford teams has been rag
ged at times in the last two games.
This can be partly explained by the
fact that several of the men on the
teams have had to make the weight
limit for their class. Losing weight
will slow anyone down. The boys are
now all right, for they weighed in
yesterday, and in the lay-off before the
game they may be expected to regain
some of their speed and power.
The line-up that will start for the
130's as given out by Coach Davis is
as follows: Whitney and Thomas, for
wards; Rayn, center; and Brockway
and Fritts, guards. Thomas has a
good eye for the iron loop and may
be expected to give an excellent ac
count of himself this evening. Whit
ney, his running mate, should also
make his presense felt. Ray, at cen
ter, due to his aggressiveness and
fight, has the call over Macy, who,
however, will probably get in the
game some time during the evening.
Larson May Play
Brock way and Fritts will start at
the guard positions. They are both
i good men, but Larson should break
into the game early at standing guard.
If the rest of the team shows the pep
| and fire that characterized bis playing
iin the Mountain View high school
j game last Tuesday night, the Califor
; nia midgets will be in for a warm eve
ning.
Macy, center, and Spradling and
Lindbloom, forwards, form an import
ant part of the reserve offensive power
j of the squad. Sano and Myron, run
ning guards, and Winn and Quigley,
standing guards, complete the roster.
The teamwork should be only slightly j
l weakened if any or all of these boys
! get into the fray.
The Stanford 145-pounders have a
fair chance to win their game with
the California tossers. They have been
going well so far this season. McCly
monds high school beat them by a
small margin last Tuesday night, but
the loss of this game should merely
inspire them to put forth their great
est efforts against the Berkeley boys.
The team has slowed down somewhat
in the last two games as it could not
get to passing and shooting at the
same time.
Starting Lineup
The following lineup will start:
Blazier and George, forwards; San
ders, center; and Newcombe and An
kele, guards. Blazier is an on-and-off
performer. If Saturday happens to be
one of his on nights he will give the
California guards something to worry j
about. George was high-point man i
against McClymonds. He and Blazier
generally work well together. Sanders ;
at center plays a nice game, but Cook
will probably see some action, for he
has been going good recently. Harlow
and King, forwards, head a list of
capable substitutes. Evans, Cairns, 1
and Lowry, at running guard, are al-.
most sure of getting a chance to pro
vide California with some stiff com
petition. Clover, standing guard, and |
King, who can sit in at either forward j
or at standing guard, complete the!
squad roster. '
