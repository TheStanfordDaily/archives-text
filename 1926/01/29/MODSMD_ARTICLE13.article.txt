Stanford and California freshmen was
expressed by Coach Husky Hunt at
the freshman rally held last night in

first to be arranged by the new fresh

most successful of the year.

freshmen will assemble this evening
before the game in the lobby of En

in a body. In this way the freshman
rally committee hopes to arouse
greater spirit before the contest.
