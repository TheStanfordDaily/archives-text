# CALIFORNIA CONCEDED EDGE OVER CARDINALS IN FIRST GAME OF ANNUAL COURT SERIES
## CARDS' DEFENSE STRONG Bears Have Unbroken String Of Victories; Redshirts Twice Vanquished 
### Jim Adams 
By reason of a better record of past
performance the California basketball
team is conceded an edge over the
Stanford five when the two meet, Sat
urday night, at 8 o'clock in the Stan
ford pavilion in the first game of their
annual series. The Bears *can turn in
a clean slate, having beaten all their
opponents to date with good scores
while the Cards have suffered two
defeats although both were adminis
tered by two strong teams, neither of
which have played the Blue and Gold
outfit this season.
U. C. Offense Good
Judging from the scores of the
U.S.C. games California seems to have
a better scoring offense than Stanford
and about an equal defense. The
Berkeley team won its games from the
Trojans by 37 to 17 and 32 to 12
scores respectively, while the Cards
won by a 25 to 14 score. The most
impressive comparison on the basis
of comparative scores is that of the
Santa Clara games. Stanford beat the
Broncos 31 to 7. California won a 53
to 13 victory from them. This brings
cut clearly that the Bears have a scor
ing team.
The Redshirts, on the other hand,
are stronger on the defense. Probably
the Blue and Gold squad hasn't met a
team this season with as tight a de
fense as the Stanford five has. Al
though this may have considerable
effect on the Bears it cannot be
overlooked that they are rated by
seme as having a stronger defense
than offense.
The outcome will rest chiefly on
just what check the Cards can put on
Higgins and Watson, the two Califor
nia individual stars, and on how the
former will hold up under heavy fire.
Stanford lacks an accurate shooter
while California has the two afore
mentioned demons.
Clark to Start
David is still weak from his recent
illness and Kerr will probably start
Clark at his place in the forward
berth. Captain Price will be at the
other forward position, Jayred at cen
ter, and Vincenti and Anderson at
guards. The squad engaged in a light
workout last night and will take a
rest today.
Kerr will be fairly well supplied in
reserves with Steele, Mitchell, Ship
key, Newhouse, and Bryant on hand,
although the team will be considerably
weakened if Price or Clark goes out
unless David is in shape to play.
The California line-up will be: Cap
tain Holmes and Watson, forwards;
Higgins, center, and Dixon and Car
ver, guards.
