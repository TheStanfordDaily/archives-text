# Waiting for the Bear
## 
### 
Four Stanford basketball teams have finished their preliminary prac
tice and are now waiting for the arrival of as many quintets wearing
the colors of the Golden Bear with whom they will tangle in the pavilion
tonight and tomorrow night. Strange to say, Stanford is not a favorite
to win a single one of the contests, but that is all the more reason why
the players are going to fight until the final whistles in the various
games have indicated the basketball supremacy of the two institutions
for the season of 1926.
It has long been traditional of Stanford that its teams have worked
all the harder when the odds were against them. We can count on the
same spirit from the players in the games on the sport card this week.
The question, however, is whether or not the Stanford students will do
their share. They have been decidedly disinterested so far this season,
but there is a chance that the California series will bring them out of the
state of chronic lethargy into which they have sunk.
An encouraging indication conies from the preparations being made
by the freshmen. The first year men held a rally last night for their
team, and they plan an even greater demonstration this evening. Fresh
men will leave Encina to enter the pavilion in a body. Later they will
have stunts in addition to the regular organized cheering. The freshmen
are to be commended for their attitude and it is the sincere hope of the
Daily Palo Alto that the upperclassmen will not be put to shame by the
members of the class of 1929.
