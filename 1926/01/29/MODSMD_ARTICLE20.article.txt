# Kid Tricks

### 
At the last two productions in the Assembly hall the audience down
stairs has been bombarded by a fusillade of aeroplanes, darts, and
random missives coming from the direction of the roughs seats over
head. The full-price spectators, as a result, have been greatly annoyed
and irritated to the extent that they find it difficult to resume interest
in the players on the stage.
If the roughs would realize that a large percentage of those down
stairs are not students they might be more willing to attempt to act as
they should —rough perhaps, but still gentlemen. Many people from
up-peninsula cities are in the audience, together with professors and
their friends. Some of these are valuable patrons of the Stanford drama
and as they become more interested they might be willing to come to the
aid of the Dramatic Council in various ways. If the roughs, however,
persist in making their visit to the campus miserable, they are going to
take their patronage elsewhere—to the loss of the dramatic progress of
Stanford.
But, the biggest reason of all is that Stanford is allegedly a university
and not a high school, nor even a circus. Perhaps we have a great
collection of wild animals here —but, according to the psychologists who
examined them, they have a chance of becoming intelligent. How alxmt
it? Let's cut out the kid tricks.

Riverside High, discussing the various colleges in the editorial
columns of the Spotlight:
"Many splendid schools are in Southern California. U.S.C., although
handicapped as far as a large campus is concerned, is well worth considering.
It seems an especially fine school for girls."
