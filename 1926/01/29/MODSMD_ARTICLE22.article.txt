# Instrument to Measure Sound-Proof Walls Found

### 
UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS. Jan. 28
A new method of measuring the sound
transmitted through a wall has been
; made possible by a recent invention
| of Professor F. R. Watson of Illinois.
"Sound-proof walls and floors" is
(lie cry of the thousands of flatdwellers
who are hourly assailed with the wait
ings of their neighbors' saxophone, or
jazz records. Professor Watson's new
method allows a test to be made of
partitions and floorings before they
are put in the building, so that building
companies can put in the right kind
of walls and floors, insuring quietude.
The instrument modified will lead
to a quantitative measurement of
noise. This will aid in deciding legal
questions which sometimes arise as to
when a noise constitutes a disturb
ance.
