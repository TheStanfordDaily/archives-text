The heat was scattered everywhere;
The desert sun was hot.
When in upon his black cayuse,
Rode Cactus Pete McWhat.
Now in the little one-hoss town,
A restaurant maiden shy,
In passing out the hash and soup,
Had captured Pete's one eye.
He snuck into the eating joint—
Xo steal the maid away;
But she had seen the villain come,
She waited,' and they say
As soon as he stopped in the door,
She punctured Pete McWhat!
Too bad to end our tale like this —
The son was not so hot. —L.A.B.
m * *
Now that nominations are nearly
upon us we think that the Election
Board should start advertising for
roasted ballot boxes with special stuf
fing.
* * *
Cabbages hereby nominates for the
office of Gatekeeper to the Hall of
Fame, Mr. X, because nobody knows
who he is.
♦ • *
The Masquers' play, "Fashion," will
be presented this evening. Many shock
ing costumes will undoubtedly be seen
in the production.
* * *
We understand that the Assembly
hall is being remodeled for the play
so as to conform with the stage con
ventions of the middle nineteenth cen
tury.
It's about time.
* * ♦
People who go to the play may ex
pect the Assembly hall to have a rela
