# THE 						RED PERIL OF PALO ALTO

My First Jolly-Up (Continued)
As I came into the lobby a fresh
flush swept over my face, and also over
the faces of my companions. All the
lights in the lobby were covered with
red crepe paper.
The music was not going when we
arrived in the lobby. If it had been, I
am sure I would not have come near
the place. (Jazz music, as they call it,
always affects me very peculiarly. It
makes me want to laugh, and when I
laugh I always lose my dignity.)
Presently the music began.
"Wait here," said my friends. "We'll
be back later."
They started to walk around the
room but they had no sooner gone five
steps (about fifteen feet), before two
boys came up and accosted them. (I, of
course, thought that they were ac
quainted, but I found out later that
they were not.) I stood where I was
for some time (about half an hour)
witching with surprise and humilia
tion the antics of those on the dance
floor. 1 could not imagine myself per
forming in that way. Presently a man
came up to me and accosted me in
much the same vile manner as my
friends had been. I turned away, but
he persisted.
