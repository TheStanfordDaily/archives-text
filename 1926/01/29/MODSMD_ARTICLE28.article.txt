Alpha Kappa Lambda won a fastly
played game from Los Arcos in the
third round of the annual intramural
basketball series played yesterday in
Encina Gymnasium. The fraternity
team was forced to play its best style
in order to win by a 23 to 10 score.
Junipero Serra Club defeated Alpha
Sigma Phi in a one-sided tilt, 23 to 6,
Kappa Sigma downed Phi Gamma
Delta in another uneven game, 34 to 9,
and Encina 2E won from El Capitan
in a ragged contest, 9 to 5. Branner
II forfeited to Phi Delta Tlieta.
The A.K.L.-Los Arcos tussle was
featured by fast teamwork and clever
dribbling. The fraternity quintet start
ed out with a rush, and ran up six
points before Los Arcos broke into
the scoring. From then on the win
ners kept their advantage, although
they were forced to show their full
strength. The score at half time fa
vored the A.K.L.'s, 11 to G.
Junipero Serra played a clever pass
ing game against the Alpha Sigs, and
had little trouble running up a deci
sive score. The club aggregation
passed the ball down the court in an
effective manner, and many field goals
were made as a result of good team
work. Alpha Sigma Phi was on the
defensive most of the game, and did
not get much of an opportunity to try
for the basket. The score at half time
was 8 to 5.
Displaying a smoothly working of
fense, Kappa Sigma ran rings around
Phi Gamma Delta in a flashy contest.
Middleton, Southworth, and Stevens
formed an unbeatable scoring combi
nation for the Kappa Sigs. Middleton
and Southworth each counted for 11
markers, and Stevens is credited with
ten. Bullard was high for the Fijis
with four points.
Encina 2E and El Capitan had a
hard time keeping hold of the ball,
and as a consequence, their game
was marred by poor playing. Both
sides had numerous chances at the
basket, but seemed unable to get the
range. Defensive playing on both sides
was decidedly superior to the offen
sive.
The games this afternoon will com
plete competition in round three. Two
more weeks of play remain in the in
tramural series before the champion
ship round will be staged to deter
mine the University titleholders. The
winners of the eight leagues will com
