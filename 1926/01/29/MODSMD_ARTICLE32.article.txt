# Faculty Will Try to Make Oberlin Popular
## 
### 
OBERLIN, Ohio, Jan. 28.â€”How Ober
lin can be made more attractive to
men and what can be done to insure
an increased attendance of male stu
dents at Oberlin will be the work of
a recently appointed committee com
posed of faculty members of the uni
versity.

Data will be collected from other
colleges that have successfully en
rolled their full quota of men. It is
possible that some of these institu
tions will be visited that first-hand
knowledge may be obtained.
Students of Oberlin will be given an
early opportunity to offer whatever
suggestions they may have.

Women students at Pennsylvania
may smoke in their, own rooms.
