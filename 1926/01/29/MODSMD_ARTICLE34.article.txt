# BEARS OPTIMISTIC OVER POSSIBILITIES OF STANFORD GAMES
## Weight Teams Will Meet U.C. In Preliminaries; California Given Edge in Tilts 
### 
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA,
Jan. 28. â€”With four games scheduled
for this week-end between Stanford
and California, basketball followers
should fine some real entertainment in
Palo Alto. On Friday the 130's and
l'reshmen from both schools will meet
ut Stanford, and on Saturday the 145's
will play the preliminary to the first
game of the varsity series.
Although the 130-pounders will put
up a good fight Friday evening, the
real interest will be centered around
the freshman fracas. Both of the year
ling squads can boast of no defeats
and appear to be in the pink of con
dition.
However, the Bruin babes appear to
be in a stronger position as they have
run up some high scores against their
opponents, while the Stanford live has
been hard pressed for points against
the same teams. John McCandless, cen
ter of the Cardinals, l\as been the out
standing player, while Dougery of the
Bruins was awarded the captaincy of
the 1925) team for his effective work.
When the two universities meet Sat
urday night the outlook is less hopeful
for the Stanfordites than in the fresh
man tilt The California cagers have
run up some high scores and have not
been really threatened in any of their
preliminary contests. The Cardinals on
the other hand have gone to defeat
at the hands of the Olympic Club and
the Southern Branch. Coach Kerr's
quintet has been working hard and is
in good shape, but with such men as
Holmes, Higgins, Watson, Carver, and
Dixon, working together like a ma
chine, Nibs Price ought to come home
well satisfied from his first encounter
with Stanford. .
