# CHAPEL, ASSEMBLY FORMERLY LOCATED IN LITTLE THEATRE
## 
### Ruth Sievers 
The Little Theatre, now in the
center of the Quadrangle, was twenty
years ago the center of University
life, when it served as a classroom,
assembly hall, and chapel. At that
time the building was known as the
Chapel, for the Memorial Church was
not completed until 1905. When the
University opened in 1891 only the
Inner Quadrangle with the exception
of the Memorial Church, was finished.
The interior of the Little Theatre
was entirely different then than it is
today. The principal use of the build
ing was that of a church, and both
morning and evening services were
held there. Sunday speakers from San
Francisco and elsewhere were secured
by a faculty committee. The floor
of the room was level and covered
with rows of folding chairs, 011 the
backs of which were wire racks for
hymn books and bibles. A small organ
of the old-fasliionel pumping type
was used. On the platform there were
three large chairs padded with red
plush. A small vestry room was lo
cated near the door, while at the back
of the building there was a space for
the large choir of voluntary students.
Walls Decorated
The walls of the room were deco
rated with religious pictures. Among
them was the "Descent from the
Cross" by Benjamin West, a noted
American artist, which is now kept
in the Museum.
The Little Theatre, in the minds of
many graduates, is intimately asso
ciated with Dr. David Starr Jordan, for
it was there that he conducted his
large class in evolution. At that time
such a course was a radical innovation.
Lectures Popular
Regularly once a week the building
was crowded for the regular Tuesday
evening lecture. These lectures were
extremely popular during the first
years of the University, but they later
lost their popularity and were discon
tinued until they were revived by
President Wilbur a few years ago.
The name of the "Little Theatre"
was not given the building until it
was remodeled twelve years ago. It
was then used considerably for public
speaking, a course which developed
rapidly under the guidance of Profes
sor Lee Emerson Rassett. Lesser dra
matic productions were staged in Ihe
room, while all the large student plays
were given in the men's old frame
gymnasium.

Four students at Illinois were re-1
cently arrested for stealing three'
Christmas Irees that were being used
to decorate the streets.

hymn books and bibles. A small organ
of the old-fasliionel pumping type
was used. On the platform there were
three large chairs padded with red
plush. A small vestry room was lo
cated near the door, while at the back
of the building there was a space for
the large choir of voluntary students.
Walls Decorated
The walls of the room were deco
rated with religious pictures. Among
them was the "Descent from the
Cross" by Benjamin West, a noted
American artist, which is now kept
in the Museum.
The Little Theatre, in the minds of
many graduates, is intimately asso
ciated with Dr. David Starr Jordan, for
it was there that he conducted his
large class in evolution. At that time
such a course was a radical innovation.
Lectures Popular
Regularly once a week the building
was crowded for the regular Tuesday
evening lecture. These lectures were
extremely popular during the first
years of the University, but they later
lost their popularity and were discon
tinued until they were revived by
President Wilbur a few years ago.
The name of the "Little Theatre"
was not given the building until it
was remodeled twelve years ago. It
was then used considerably for public
speaking, a course which developed
rapidly under the guidance of Profes
sor Lee Emerson Rassett. Lesser dra
matic productions were staged in Ihe
room, while all the large student plays
were given in the men's old frame
gymnasium.

Four students at Illinois were re-1
cently arrested for stealing three'
Christmas Irees that were being used
to decorate the streets.
