# FOSSILS CONTAINED IN SANDSTONE USED FOR QUAD BUILDINGS
## 
### Lynn Bramkamp 
All rocks have a history which can
in part be deciphered from the evi
dence which the rocks themselves fur
nish. The rocks in the Quad buildings
or others that come from nearby
places contain fossils which are known
to be the remains of shore clams and
snails that lived only during the Cre
taceous period, which is relatively late
in geological history. Years, the com
mon measure of time, cannot be used
to tell how long ago this period was,
all that can be said being that in the
long series of events that is known
these animals lived very late.
The fossils found are those whose
descendants today live along the
shores of tropical or warm temperate
oceans. From this it is inferred that
the climate was tropical or sub-tropical
in the region where, and at the time
when, these rocks were laid down. The
fossils are similar to others found in
similar rocks in Japan. This is evi
dence that the Cretaceous shores of
California and Japan were continuous
or nearly so, and that this afforded
routes for the migrations and mingling
of their two widely separated faunas.
The material in the Quad stones is
largely quartz or sand grains that have
been cemented together. These grains
were carried down by streams from an
area which contained an abundant
supply of quartzitic material as a
source. The material closely resem
bles the debris that the streams at the
present time are carrying down from
the Sierras and depositing in the Great
Valley.
This similarity of material, together
with other evidence, suggests the con
clusion that the Sierra Nevadas were
already in existence during the Cre
taceous period. The presence of these
marine deposits over the Coast Ranges
indicates that while they were being
laid down, the Pacific Ocean covered
the site of the latter ranges, and pos
sibly the greater part of the Great
Valley.
These, in brief, are a few high lights
recorded by the rocks of the Quad.
