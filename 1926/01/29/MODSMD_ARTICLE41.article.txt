TON, PULLMAN—Sadness and gloom
of a doubtful quality pervaded the
campus Tuesday morning while the
invitations to the annual Sigma Delta
Chi "Gridiron Banquet" were being de
livered.
At the start of the noon hour a
handsome hearse moved from its shed
drawn by two trustworthy steeds from
the Veterinary Department, which had
purchased them for purpose of study,
and began a staid progress toward
the lower part of the campus. In ad
vance of the hearse were two splendid
war horses hung with glittering trap
pings of pure iron, ' slightly rusted.
These chargers carried two of the
chief mourners who directed the line
ot march. The trappings of the team
that "Drafted" the hearse were the
finest obtainable and cost $4.23.
It was in this way that the invita
tions to the Gridiron Banquet were
delivered to the prominent fraternity
men of the campus.
