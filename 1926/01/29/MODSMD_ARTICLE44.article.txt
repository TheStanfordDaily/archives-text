# OGDEN UNABLE TO COMPETE IN TENNIS MATCHES MONDAY
## 
### 
The varsity tennis team will open
the 192G intercollegiate tennis season
Monday afternoon at 2:30 when it
plays the University of California,
Southern Branch, on the local courts.
A five-man team will be used, playing
five singles and two doubles matches.
The Stanford team will be handi
capped by the loss of Lionel Ogden,
captain and second ranking player,
who sprained his ankle in the present
intramural basketball series. To fill
this vacancy, Alan Herrington will
move up to No. 2, Paul Falrchild to
No. 3, Gomer Thomas to No. 4, and
Ralph McElvenny to No. 5. Herring
ton probably will be used to substitute
in the first doubles combination of
Holman and Ogden, and either Thom
as or McElvenny will be paired with
Fairchild to form the second team.
Little is known of the comparative
strength of the Grizzlies. At Los An
geles last spring, they almost defeated
Stanford, and this season they un
doubtedly will present as strong a
team. Some comparisons can be drawn
after Saturday, when the Branch plays
California on the courts at Berkeley.
