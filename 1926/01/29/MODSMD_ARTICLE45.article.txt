## "Dodson's Hints on Musical Hits" 
### 
Tom Waring, one of the few so
called "whispering" vocalists who
really has a good voice, has recorded
"I'm Tired of Everything but You"
and "Let's Forget." Melodious songs,
these, half-sung, half-spoken in the
popular manner of the moment.
His brother, Fred, and the Pennsyl
vanians offer two new ones —"I Love
My Baby" and "Collegiate Blues." The
first is played swiftly and almost en
tirely without instrumental soloists. It
is pre-eminently for the Charleston.
"Collegiate Blues" is in slow rhythm,
with plenty of variation, trick stuff,
and occasional musical references to
the old-timer "Collegiate."
Paul Whiteman popularizes two
classics by playing "Hymn to the Sun"
as a fox-trot and "Caprice Viennois"
as a waltz. You'll be surprised how
adaptable these records are to the
modern dances and how at the same
time they retain much of their classi
cal heritage.
"Song of the Vagabonds" and "Only
a Rose," two hits from the musical
play "The Vagabond King," have been
made into acceptable fox-trots by the
International Novelty Orchestra.
If you like waltzes played by a group
of musicians who know tlie waltz bet
ter than the fox-trot listen to The
Troubadours play "When I Dream of
the Last Waltz with You" and "Kosher
Kitty Kelly."
