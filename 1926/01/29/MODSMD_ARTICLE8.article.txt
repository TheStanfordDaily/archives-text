# WAR PUT EUROPE BACK 100 YEARS JORDAN ASSERIS
## COUNTRIES WEAKENED Ablest Men Killed; Poorest Stock Left Responsible For Repopulation 
### 
That the recent war put Europe
back at least one hundred years, was
the opinion set forth by Dr. Jordan
in his discussion of the biological ef
fects of war at the conference held in
his home last night. The killing off of
the able men is the greatest price
paid by the race to war; it is the
fundamental cause of the downfall of
nations.
Dr. Jordan based his discussion on
the historical examples of the decline
of Rome and Spain, and more recently
France and England. Rome easily fell
prey to the barbaric tribes, not be
cause of moral laxity, wealth, and
internal dissatisfaction, but because
all of its best blood had been killed
off in the building and maintaining of
the empire and in civil strife.
The case of Spain, one-time ruler
of a little part of the old world and
most of the new, was in some re
spects similar to that of Rome. The
flower of the Spanish blood was sent
abroad in conquest and exploration,
while the poorest stayed behind to
breed the generations which brought
their country to its present weak po
sition. Spain made men and wasted
them, both in colonial exploits and in
narrow public policy.
Characterizing Napoleon as the
greatest sham in history, Dr. Jordan
credited him with depleting France
of much of its vital stock. The next
generation in that country will be
very weak as a result of the World
War. "England has paid highly for her
foreign colonies," declared Dr. Jor
dan in touching upon her biological
status. "Many of the English smaller
towns have literally 'gone to sleep'
as a result of the loss of their leading
men through war and colonization."
The colleges of the country con
tribute a heavy quota of those who fail
to survive the major conflicts. So
much was this the case that in 1915
there was not a single athlete in
Oxford University. Among the eighty
six from Stanford who lost their lives
in the war there were several whom
Dr. Jordan rated as among the ablest
students he had ever seen.
