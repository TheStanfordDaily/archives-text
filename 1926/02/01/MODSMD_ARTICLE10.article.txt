# Old Time Stage Is Reproduced By Masquers Society
## 
### C. H. P 
Those who attended Friday night's
performance of Anna Cora Mowatt's
famous play of the forties, "Fashion,"
with the expectation of witnessing an
intensely interesting and fast-moving
dramatic vehicle, were, perhaps, a bit
disappointed, for "Fashion" was cer
tainly not that. Those, however, who
went expecting to see a replica of old
time stage direction, technique, and
acting, certainly should have come
away with the conviction that Gordon
Pavis and his cast of thirteen had
executed a very creditable performance.
From the lighting of the old taper
footlights to the poetic epilogue, the
entire production represented consist
ently and in detail the manner in
which plays were staged eighty years
ago. , In this consideration, credit
should be first given to the technical
staff headed by Leslie Kiler and
Chrysella Kiler who so cleverly exe
cuted the old-time sets, the roller cur
tain, the antique lighting effects, etc.,
and to Gordon Davis, director, who
was able to duplicate this old produc
tion to such a degree of perfection,
and to put together such an enjoyable
entertainment in the extremely short
space of ten days.
Women Outstanding
The women were the outstanding
actors of the performance, and it may
truly be said that not one of them
failed to make a marked impression.
Few shows at Stanford have been for
tunate enough to have included in the
cast such a delightful variety of femi
nine ability. Patrice Nauman, Velma
Randall, Aileene Burks, Marjorie Al
len, and Barbara Probasco all gave
splendid individual performances, and
showed a complete understanding of
their parts.
Patrice Nauman, as Mrs. Tiffany,
played an exceptional part in an ex
ceptional way, and deserves no end
of commendation for her performance.
She was never out of character, her
stage presence was excellent, and she
seemed always to have just the proper
maturity for the part. Miss Nauman
failed at times to derive quite all the
humor from her delicious French
"faux passes," but part of the blame
for this may be put upon the audience,
who often failed to respond, and ,
seemed at times not to quite compre- J
hend what the thing was all about, or J
just what the company was trying to j
put over. The greatest compliment I
that can be paid Miss Nauman is that
she consistently reminded one of the |
famous Mrs. Fiske playing her im- 1
mortal Mrs. Malaprop in Sheridan's
"The Rivals."
Randall Scores
Velma Randall, as Gertrude, the
charming ingenue, scored a decisive
victory in a part which heretofore
would have been considered quite for
eign to her. She was, as always, com- j
pletely sure of herself in every situa- j
tion. At all times she displayed the |
poise and stage presence of an experi
enced actress, and she showed rare
sense of comedy by taking advantage
of every possible opportunity both in
her acting and singing. By bringing
out all the subtleties of comedy in her
part on the one hand, and displaying
exceptional emotional ability on the
other, Miss Randall proved that she
possesses a remarkable versatility.
Aileene Burks added life and color
to the production by a vivid portrayal
of Millinette, the French maid. Al
though the part was not a long one,
it gave her an opportunity to display
her ability at characterization which
she did in a very admirable manner.
It may also be said of Miss Burks that
she was continually in character and
very consistently and colorfully
French.
Allen Sings Well
Marjorie Allen, as Seraphina Tiffany,
was delightful in her comedy, always
the s'weet and appealing "Belle Char
mante" of the forties, she looked and
acted the part. Her songs were espe
cially well done. Barbara Probasco
played Prudence, the "meddlesome old
lady," in an effective manner, al
though she fell into juvenile tenden
cies at times. The part, however, gave
her a chance for some good comedy,
and she handled some difficult situa
tions well.
Outstanding among the men was
George Mauser as Snobson, the Ameri
can misfit. He showed a rare intelli
gence of situation and exceptional
self-assurance. His drunken expose of
Mr. Tiffany was one of the salient
features of the show, and his song
was received with "shouts of approba
tion" from an enthusiastic audience.
Paul Tenney did well as Count Joli
maitre. A week of illness prior to the |
performance put him at somewhat of j
a disadvantage, but he made up for
his frequent lack of expression by his j

poise and suavity, and a delightful
singing voice.
Edward Smith showed good matur
ity in his portrayal of Mr. Tiffany. He
has good possibilities for development
and will no doubt be heard from again
soon.
Difficult Role
Cecil Doll as Adam Trueman, the
Catteraugus farmer, had, perhaps, the
most difficult part among the men,
and he did it very creditably. He was
fortunate in having a fine make-up
which served to din; occasional ten
dencies toward youthful expression. It
was unfortunate that he lost his vi
tality in his last and most important
speech, but this did not detract seri
ously from the admirable manner in
which he carried off a difficult role.
Felton Kaufmann, as Mr. Twinkle,
showed himself to be a comedian of
some talent. His song was extremely
funny and well put over. Fenton Bar
rett was acceptable as Colonel How
ard, the hero, although the part was
more or less colorless. Barrett at
times had difficulty in some of his
dramatic manoeuvers, but that type of
part is always hard to do, and inclined
to be unsympathetic.
Negro Comedy
Hal Boomer made a good comedy
negro, and was always able to draw a
laugh, or at least a snicker, from the
house. His recital in the first act was
rather weak, but people who can't sing
shouldn't be made to try. Sidney Grey
handled a minor part well. He was
Augustus Fegg, a friend of the Tif
fanys.
The musical end of the production
was well handled by Miss Kathryn
Jule at the harp, and Miss Elizabeth
Peirce at the violin. Both are musi
cians of talent. One of the high lights
of the show was the Polka, which was
very well done, and proved very popu
lar with the audience.

famous play of the forties, "Fashion,"
with the expectation of witnessing an
intensely interesting and fast-moving
dramatic vehicle, were, perhaps, a bit
disappointed, for "Fashion" was cer
tainly not that. Those, however, who
went expecting to see a replica of old
time stage direction, technique, and
acting, certainly should have come
away with the conviction that Gordon
Pavis and his cast of thirteen had
executed a very creditable performance.
From the lighting of the old taper
footlights to the poetic epilogue, the
entire production represented consist
ently and in detail the manner in
which plays were staged eighty years
ago. , In this consideration, credit
should be first given to the technical
staff headed by Leslie Kiler and
Chrysella Kiler who so cleverly exe
cuted the old-time sets, the roller cur
tain, the antique lighting effects, etc.,
and to Gordon Davis, director, who
was able to duplicate this old produc
tion to such a degree of perfection,
and to put together such an enjoyable
entertainment in the extremely short
space of ten days.
Women Outstanding
The women were the outstanding
actors of the performance, and it may
truly be said that not one of them
failed to make a marked impression.
Few shows at Stanford have been for
tunate enough to have included in the
cast such a delightful variety of femi
nine ability. Patrice Nauman, Velma
Randall, Aileene Burks, Marjorie Al
len, and Barbara Probasco all gave
splendid individual performances, and
showed a complete understanding of
their parts.
Patrice Nauman, as Mrs. Tiffany,
played an exceptional part in an ex
ceptional way, and deserves no end
of commendation for her performance.
She was never out of character, her
stage presence was excellent, and she
seemed always to have just the proper
maturity for the part. Miss Nauman
failed at times to derive quite all the
humor from her delicious French
"faux passes," but part of the blame
for this may be put upon the audience,
who often failed to respond, and ,
seemed at times not to quite compre- J
hend what the thing was all about, or J
just what the company was trying to j
put over. The greatest compliment I
that can be paid Miss Nauman is that
she consistently reminded one of the |
famous Mrs. Fiske playing her im- 1
mortal Mrs. Malaprop in Sheridan's
"The Rivals."
Randall Scores
Velma Randall, as Gertrude, the
charming ingenue, scored a decisive
victory in a part which heretofore
would have been considered quite for
eign to her. She was, as always, com- j
pletely sure of herself in every situa- j
tion. At all times she displayed the |
poise and stage presence of an experi
enced actress, and she showed rare
sense of comedy by taking advantage
of every possible opportunity both in
her acting and singing. By bringing
out all the subtleties of comedy in her
part on the one hand, and displaying
exceptional emotional ability on the
other, Miss Randall proved that she
possesses a remarkable versatility.
Aileene Burks added life and color
to the production by a vivid portrayal
of Millinette, the French maid. Al
though the part was not a long one,
it gave her an opportunity to display
her ability at characterization which
she did in a very admirable manner.
It may also be said of Miss Burks that
she was continually in character and
very consistently and colorfully
French.
Allen Sings Well
Marjorie Allen, as Seraphina Tiffany,
was delightful in her comedy, always
the s'weet and appealing "Belle Char
mante" of the forties, she looked and
acted the part. Her songs were espe
cially well done. Barbara Probasco
played Prudence, the "meddlesome old
lady," in an effective manner, al
though she fell into juvenile tenden
cies at times. The part, however, gave
her a chance for some good comedy,
and she handled some difficult situa
tions well.
Outstanding among the men was
George Mauser as Snobson, the Ameri
can misfit. He showed a rare intelli
gence of situation and exceptional
self-assurance. His drunken expose of
Mr. Tiffany was one of the salient
features of the show, and his song
was received with "shouts of approba
tion" from an enthusiastic audience.
Paul Tenney did well as Count Joli
maitre. A week of illness prior to the |
performance put him at somewhat of j
a disadvantage, but he made up for
his frequent lack of expression by his j

poise and suavity, and a delightful
singing voice.
Edward Smith showed good matur
ity in his portrayal of Mr. Tiffany. He
has good possibilities for development
and will no doubt be heard from again
soon.
Difficult Role
Cecil Doll as Adam Trueman, the
Catteraugus farmer, had, perhaps, the
most difficult part among the men,
and he did it very creditably. He was
fortunate in having a fine make-up
which served to din; occasional ten
dencies toward youthful expression. It
was unfortunate that he lost his vi
tality in his last and most important
speech, but this did not detract seri
ously from the admirable manner in
which he carried off a difficult role.
Felton Kaufmann, as Mr. Twinkle,
showed himself to be a comedian of
some talent. His song was extremely
funny and well put over. Fenton Bar
rett was acceptable as Colonel How
ard, the hero, although the part was
more or less colorless. Barrett at
times had difficulty in some of his
dramatic manoeuvers, but that type of
part is always hard to do, and inclined
to be unsympathetic.
Negro Comedy
Hal Boomer made a good comedy
negro, and was always able to draw a
laugh, or at least a snicker, from the
house. His recital in the first act was
rather weak, but people who can't sing
shouldn't be made to try. Sidney Grey
handled a minor part well. He was
Augustus Fegg, a friend of the Tif
fanys.
The musical end of the production
was well handled by Miss Kathryn
Jule at the harp, and Miss Elizabeth
Peirce at the violin. Both are musi
cians of talent. One of the high lights
of the show was the Polka, which was
very well done, and proved very popu
lar with the audience.

dramatic vehicle, were, perhaps, a bit
disappointed, for "Fashion" was cer
tainly not that. Those, however, who
went expecting to see a replica of old
time stage direction, technique, and
acting, certainly should have come
away with the conviction that Gordon
Pavis and his cast of thirteen had
executed a very creditable performance.
From the lighting of the old taper
footlights to the poetic epilogue, the
entire production represented consist
ently and in detail the manner in
which plays were staged eighty years
ago. , In this consideration, credit
should be first given to the technical
staff headed by Leslie Kiler and
Chrysella Kiler who so cleverly exe
cuted the old-time sets, the roller cur
tain, the antique lighting effects, etc.,
and to Gordon Davis, director, who
was able to duplicate this old produc
tion to such a degree of perfection,
and to put together such an enjoyable
entertainment in the extremely short
space of ten days.
Women Outstanding
The women were the outstanding
actors of the performance, and it may
truly be said that not one of them
failed to make a marked impression.
Few shows at Stanford have been for
tunate enough to have included in the
cast such a delightful variety of femi
nine ability. Patrice Nauman, Velma
Randall, Aileene Burks, Marjorie Al
len, and Barbara Probasco all gave
splendid individual performances, and
showed a complete understanding of
their parts.
Patrice Nauman, as Mrs. Tiffany,
played an exceptional part in an ex
ceptional way, and deserves no end
of commendation for her performance.
She was never out of character, her
stage presence was excellent, and she
seemed always to have just the proper
maturity for the part. Miss Nauman
failed at times to derive quite all the
humor from her delicious French
"faux passes," but part of the blame
for this may be put upon the audience,
who often failed to respond, and ,
seemed at times not to quite compre- J
hend what the thing was all about, or J
just what the company was trying to j
put over. The greatest compliment I
that can be paid Miss Nauman is that
she consistently reminded one of the |
famous Mrs. Fiske playing her im- 1
mortal Mrs. Malaprop in Sheridan's
"The Rivals."
Randall Scores
Velma Randall, as Gertrude, the
charming ingenue, scored a decisive
victory in a part which heretofore
would have been considered quite for
eign to her. She was, as always, com- j
pletely sure of herself in every situa- j
tion. At all times she displayed the |
poise and stage presence of an experi
enced actress, and she showed rare
sense of comedy by taking advantage
of every possible opportunity both in
her acting and singing. By bringing
out all the subtleties of comedy in her
part on the one hand, and displaying
exceptional emotional ability on the
other, Miss Randall proved that she
possesses a remarkable versatility.
Aileene Burks added life and color
to the production by a vivid portrayal
of Millinette, the French maid. Al
though the part was not a long one,
it gave her an opportunity to display
her ability at characterization which
she did in a very admirable manner.
It may also be said of Miss Burks that
she was continually in character and
very consistently and colorfully
French.
Allen Sings Well
Marjorie Allen, as Seraphina Tiffany,
was delightful in her comedy, always
the s'weet and appealing "Belle Char
mante" of the forties, she looked and
acted the part. Her songs were espe
cially well done. Barbara Probasco
played Prudence, the "meddlesome old
lady," in an effective manner, al
though she fell into juvenile tenden
cies at times. The part, however, gave
her a chance for some good comedy,
and she handled some difficult situa
tions well.
Outstanding among the men was
George Mauser as Snobson, the Ameri
can misfit. He showed a rare intelli
gence of situation and exceptional
self-assurance. His drunken expose of
Mr. Tiffany was one of the salient
features of the show, and his song
was received with "shouts of approba
tion" from an enthusiastic audience.
Paul Tenney did well as Count Joli
maitre. A week of illness prior to the |
performance put him at somewhat of j
a disadvantage, but he made up for
his frequent lack of expression by his j

poise and suavity, and a delightful
singing voice.
Edward Smith showed good matur
ity in his portrayal of Mr. Tiffany. He
has good possibilities for development
and will no doubt be heard from again
soon.
Difficult Role
Cecil Doll as Adam Trueman, the
Catteraugus farmer, had, perhaps, the
most difficult part among the men,
and he did it very creditably. He was
fortunate in having a fine make-up
which served to din; occasional ten
dencies toward youthful expression. It
was unfortunate that he lost his vi
tality in his last and most important
speech, but this did not detract seri
ously from the admirable manner in
which he carried off a difficult role.
Felton Kaufmann, as Mr. Twinkle,
showed himself to be a comedian of
some talent. His song was extremely
funny and well put over. Fenton Bar
rett was acceptable as Colonel How
ard, the hero, although the part was
more or less colorless. Barrett at
times had difficulty in some of his
dramatic manoeuvers, but that type of
part is always hard to do, and inclined
to be unsympathetic.
Negro Comedy
Hal Boomer made a good comedy
negro, and was always able to draw a
laugh, or at least a snicker, from the
house. His recital in the first act was
rather weak, but people who can't sing
shouldn't be made to try. Sidney Grey
handled a minor part well. He was
Augustus Fegg, a friend of the Tif
fanys.
The musical end of the production
was well handled by Miss Kathryn
Jule at the harp, and Miss Elizabeth
Peirce at the violin. Both are musi
cians of talent. One of the high lights
of the show was the Polka, which was
very well done, and proved very popu
lar with the audience.
Those who attended Friday night's
performance of Anna Cora Mowatt's
famous play of the forties, "Fashion,"
with the expectation of witnessing an
intensely interesting and fast-moving
dramatic vehicle, were, perhaps, a bit
disappointed, for "Fashion" was cer
tainly not that. Those, however, who
