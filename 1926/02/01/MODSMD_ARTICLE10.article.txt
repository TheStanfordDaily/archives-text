# Old Time Stage Is Reproduced By Masquers Society

### C. H. P 
Those who attended Friday night's
performance of Anna Cora Mowatt's
famous play of the forties, "Fashion,"
with the expectation of witnessing an
intensely interesting and fast-moving

entertainment in the extremely short
space of ten days.

splendid individual performances, and
showed a complete understanding of
their parts.
Patrice Nauman, as Mrs. Tiffany,
played an exceptional part in an ex
ceptional way, and deserves no end
of commendation for her performance.
She was never out of character, her
stage presence was excellent, and she
seemed always to have just the proper
