## 
### 
Ursula Greville, English soprano,
will give a recital in the Assembly
hall tomorrow night at 7:30 o'clock
as one of the series of Tuesday events
presented by the Committee on Pub
lic Exercises. Miss Greville, who has
been called "the disciple and apostle
of modern English song," is one of
the most distinguished among the
younger vocal artists, and sings both
classical and modern music.
Miss Greville has arranged a dis
tinctive program for her concert to
morrow night. The songs are grouped
by their subject and sentiment rather
than by their period. Most of them
are modern works and many will be
new to Stanford. The four groups are
"Folk Songs," "Songs of Despair,"
"Tree Songs," and "Songs of Trust
and Treachery." Therese Bauer will
be accompanist.
Among the folk-songs in the first
group are: "Shenandoah," "I'm O'er
Young," and "Charlie Is My Darling."
The "Songs of Despair " include com
positions with lyrics by such noted
poets as Walter de la Mare and Bliss
Carman.
Miss Greville made her debut in
England in 1920. Since then she has
taken leading roles in opera and has
occupied a prominent place on the
concert stage. One of her first roles
was that of the Queen of the Night
in Mozart's opera, "The Magic Flute,"
a vocal part of the utmost technical
difficulty. Since that time she has
taken concert tours through the Brit
ish Isles, Austria, Germany, and Spain.
In 1922 came her first American ap
pearance, and after a period of study
in Italy, her return for the opening
concert of the International Compos
ers Guild in 1924. She later appeared
as soloist with the New York State
Symphony Orchestra.
