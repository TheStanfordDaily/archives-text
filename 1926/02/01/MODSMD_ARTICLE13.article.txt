# THETA XI DEFEATS PHI PSIS TO TAKE LEAD IN LEAGUE IV
## Independents and El Toro Are Favored to Win Today's Battles 
### Gordon French 
Theta Xi nosed out the Phi Kappa
Psi quintet 15 to 11 to take the undis
puted lead in League IV of the intra
mural tournament after a fast, excit
ing game Friday afternoon. A rally
by the Phi Psi team threatened to
give it the victory, but the Theta Xi
squad scored five points in the last
few minutes to retain its lead. The
Encina IE players scored their first
victory in three starts and upset all
the dope by disposing of the hitherto
undefeated Alpha Delta Phi quintet
11 to 9.
Prazier, Phi Psi forward who has
been one of the outstanding stars of
the intramural season, played his
usual fast floor game and showed the
best form of anyone in the game. He
also grabbed the high-point honors
with seven points. His speedy offen
sive playing was largely responsible
in keeping his team in the running,
but the work of Wisely and Mack,
Phi Psi guards, kept the Theta Xi
score down. Anderson, who played
a good floor game, and Scofield were
high-point men for Theta Xi with
three baskets apiece.
Phi Psi's Start Scoring
The Phi Kappa Psi team started
with a rush when Frazier opened the
scoring with a neat shot, and Knox
made it 4-0 with a shot from near
mid-floor. The Theta Xi five then got
under way and gained an 8-4 lead near
the end of the half.
The second half was almost a dupli
cate of the first, with the Phi Psi team
dominating the first part of the play
and their opponents holding the edge
in the later stages of play. Frazier
scored all five points to give his team
the edge, 11-0, but again the Theta Xi's
rallied and also scored five points.
Dope Upset
The first big upset of the season
occurred in the Encina lE-Alpha Delta
Phi contest when the high-scoring
Alpha Delta team could not get its
offensive working. The first half was
close and hard-fought. The freshmen
ended the period with a one-point lead,
the count standing 5 to 4. At one time
in the second half it looked dark for
the Encina players, but they came
back strong to take that victory. The
high-scorer for the game was Richards
of the hall five, with eight points,
while Holman of the Alpha Delts came
in one point behind.
In today's games Independents and
El Toro are favored to win from Phi
Kappa Sigma and Alpha Tau Omega
fives in the feature games. The only
undefeated team in League VIII, Beta
Theta Pi, is scheduled to win its
fourth straight victory in a tilt with
Delta Chi.
Tomorrow's feature game for League
I is between the Breakers and Encina
4E. Phi Delta Theta- and Theta
Delta Chi mix in the best tilt
scheduled for the evening play, while
Sequoia II battles the Sigma Chi quin
tet in a fast contest in League 11.

fourth straight victory in a tilt with
Delta Chi.
Tomorrow's feature game for League
I is between the Breakers and Encina
4E. Phi Delta Theta- and Theta
Delta Chi mix in the best tilt
scheduled for the evening play, while
Sequoia II battles the Sigma Chi quin
tet in a fast contest in League 11.
Theta Xi nosed out the Phi Kappa
Psi quintet 15 to 11 to take the undis
puted lead in League IV of the intra
mural tournament after a fast, excit
ing game Friday afternoon. A rally
by the Phi Psi team threatened to
give it the victory, but the Theta Xi
squad scored five points in the last
few minutes to retain its lead. The
Encina IE players scored their first
victory in three starts and upset all
the dope by disposing of the hitherto
undefeated Alpha Delta Phi quintet
11 to 9.
Prazier, Phi Psi forward who has
been one of the outstanding stars of
the intramural season, played his
usual fast floor game and showed the
best form of anyone in the game. He
also grabbed the high-point honors
with seven points. His speedy offen
sive playing was largely responsible
in keeping his team in the running,
but the work of Wisely and Mack,
Phi Psi guards, kept the Theta Xi
score down. Anderson, who played
a good floor game, and Scofield were
high-point men for Theta Xi with
three baskets apiece.
Phi Psi's Start Scoring
The Phi Kappa Psi team started
with a rush when Frazier opened the
scoring with a neat shot, and Knox
made it 4-0 with a shot from near
mid-floor. The Theta Xi five then got
under way and gained an 8-4 lead near
the end of the half.
The second half was almost a dupli
cate of the first, with the Phi Psi team
dominating the first part of the play
and their opponents holding the edge
in the later stages of play. Frazier
scored all five points to give his team
the edge, 11-0, but again the Theta Xi's
rallied and also scored five points.
Dope Upset
The first big upset of the season
occurred in the Encina lE-Alpha Delta
Phi contest when the high-scoring
Alpha Delta team could not get its
offensive working. The first half was
close and hard-fought. The freshmen
ended the period with a one-point lead,
the count standing 5 to 4. At one time
in the second half it looked dark for
the Encina players, but they came
back strong to take that victory. The
high-scorer for the game was Richards
of the hall five, with eight points,
while Holman of the Alpha Delts came
in one point behind.
In today's games Independents and
El Toro are favored to win from Phi
Kappa Sigma and Alpha Tau Omega
fives in the feature games. The only
undefeated team in League VIII, Beta
Theta Pi, is scheduled to win its
fourth straight victory in a tilt with
Delta Chi.
