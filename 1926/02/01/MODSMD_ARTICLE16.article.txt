# CARDS NOSED OUT OF VICTORY IN FIRST CONTEST WITH BEARS
## Field Goal by Butts During Last Minute Gives His Team 18 to 17 Win 
### 
Making two points by a long shot
from the side of the court in the last
minute of play, Milton Butts, substi
tute California forward, snatched a
victory from the Stanford five by a
one-point margin in the first game of
the annual Stanford-California basket
ball series played in the pavilion Sat
urday night.
As the gun shot with the Bears lead
ing 18 to 17, Captain Fred Price of
the Cardinals was awarded a free
throw on a personal foul. A sink would
have meant an extra period of play;
but the law of averages operated too
well. The ball tottered on the edge of
the basket, fell away from the hoop,
and one of the most exciting contests
ever enacted in the Stanford pavilion
came to a close.
Cards Surprise
Going into the game as the under
dogs, the Cardinals staged a decided
surprise. Supposedly weak in all de
partments of the game, the Cards
opened a trick offense centered
around Bill Clark at forward. The
guards, Vincenti and Anderson, broke
up the Bears' defense time after time.
Clark emerged from the contest as
the high-point man, with eleven points
to his credit —three field goals and
five free shots. Higgins, the Bears'
center, was his nearest competitor
with eight counters.
Defense Efficient
The lead see-sawed from start to
finish. After five minutes of scoreless
playing, Clark dribbled half way down
the floor and scored from under the
basket. While doing so he was' fouled,
and, by sinking the two free throws, he
put the Cards four points to the good.
A minute later Carver of California
tallied one point on a free throw.
Five minutes passed with both
teams' defenses functioning efficiently,
and then Carver slipped in a field goal
from under the basket. Again Clark
scored a difficult shot, bringing the
score to 6 to 4. In the remaining few
minutes of the half Higgins gained
three points, on a free throw and a
field goal, and Captain Holmes put in
a foul try, giving the Bruins a 7 to 6
lead at the half.
The second half was a rough and
tumble affair. Three California men,
Carver, Dixon, and Holmes, were or
dered off the floor because of four
personals, while Jayred was the only
Stanford man to commit four fouls, al
though several others were in danger.
Bears Lead
About four minutes from the final
gun the score stood 15 to 10 in favor
of the Bears. Anderson put in a bas
ket from the middle of the floor. Clark
followed next from the tip-off with a
pretty dribble and shot. He was fouled
while shooting and made both of the
free throws, giving Stanford a one
point lead. This was held only a min
ute, for Higgins, the California cen
ter, again came through in a pinch,
sinking a free throw. Stanford wiggled
into the lead once more when Price
was fouled and made the throw. Then
Butts, the substitute Bear forward,
put down a difficult shot from the side
of the court.
With only a few seconds remaining
to play the ball was taken to center.
A fraction of a second before the gun
was shot Captain Price was fouled
by Butts. Three thousand spectators
sat breathless as he walked up to the
basket. But the ball hesitated on the
rim of the basket and dropped to the
floor.

the high-point man, with eleven points
to his credit —three field goals and
five free shots. Higgins, the Bears'
center, was his nearest competitor
with eight counters.
Defense Efficient
The lead see-sawed from start to
finish. After five minutes of scoreless
playing, Clark dribbled half way down
the floor and scored from under the
basket. While doing so he was' fouled,
and, by sinking the two free throws, he
put the Cards four points to the good.
A minute later Carver of California
tallied one point on a free throw.
Five minutes passed with both
teams' defenses functioning efficiently,
and then Carver slipped in a field goal
from under the basket. Again Clark
scored a difficult shot, bringing the
score to 6 to 4. In the remaining few
minutes of the half Higgins gained
three points, on a free throw and a
field goal, and Captain Holmes put in
a foul try, giving the Bruins a 7 to 6
lead at the half.
The second half was a rough and
tumble affair. Three California men,
Carver, Dixon, and Holmes, were or
dered off the floor because of four
personals, while Jayred was the only
Stanford man to commit four fouls, al
though several others were in danger.
Bears Lead
About four minutes from the final
gun the score stood 15 to 10 in favor
of the Bears. Anderson put in a bas
ket from the middle of the floor. Clark
followed next from the tip-off with a
pretty dribble and shot. He was fouled
while shooting and made both of the
free throws, giving Stanford a one
point lead. This was held only a min
ute, for Higgins, the California cen
ter, again came through in a pinch,
sinking a free throw. Stanford wiggled
into the lead once more when Price
was fouled and made the throw. Then
Butts, the substitute Bear forward,
put down a difficult shot from the side
of the court.
With only a few seconds remaining
to play the ball was taken to center.
A fraction of a second before the gun
was shot Captain Price was fouled
by Butts. Three thousand spectators
sat breathless as he walked up to the
basket. But the ball hesitated on the
rim of the basket and dropped to the
floor.
The lineup follows:
Stanford- 1 - , California —
Price (C) (2) F Holmes (C) (2)

Making two points by a long shot
from the side of the court in the last
minute of play, Milton Butts, substi
tute California forward, snatched a
victory from the Stanford five by a
one-point margin in the first game of
the annual Stanford-California basket
ball series played in the pavilion Sat
urday night.
As the gun shot with the Bears lead
ing 18 to 17, Captain Fred Price of
the Cardinals was awarded a free
throw on a personal foul. A sink would
have meant an extra period of play;
but the law of averages operated too
well. The ball tottered on the edge of
the basket, fell away from the hoop,
and one of the most exciting contests
ever enacted in the Stanford pavilion
came to a close.
Cards Surprise
Going into the game as the under
dogs, the Cardinals staged a decided
surprise. Supposedly weak in all de
partments of the game, the Cards
opened a trick offense centered
around Bill Clark at forward. The
guards, Vincenti and Anderson, broke
up the Bears' defense time after time.
Clark emerged from the contest as
