# CLASSICAL PERIOD MUSIC ON PROGRAM OF ORGAN RECITAL
## 
### 
The works of composers of the 17th
and 18th centuries will make up the
program of Warren D. Allen's organ
recital Tuesday afternoon at 4:15
o'clock in the Memorial Church.
"Rigaudon in C Minor" by Lully will
open the program. The Rigaudon is
one of the many classical dances in
which form a large part of the com
positions of the early composers were
cast. It is a rapid dance of French
origin. Jean Pabtiste Lully (1633-87)
was one of the most noted composers
of his time in Italy.
Frescobaldi, one of the greatest of
the musicians who came before Bach,
is represented by his "Toccata per
l'elevazione." The toccata is a brilliant
composition resembling the modern
etude for piano or organ. Frescobaldi,
who lived from 1583 to 1644, was or
ganist at Saint Peter's and drew large
crowds there by his recitals. He wrote
many pieces for the services of Saint
Peter's, of which the Toccata is one.
Two Bach numbers, "Rejoice Now,
Christians," a Chorale-Prelude, and
"Passacaglia in C Minor," will close
the program.
