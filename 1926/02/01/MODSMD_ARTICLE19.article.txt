# Elections Again
## 
### 
Today marks the first clay of nominations for nine University
and all class offices, the privilege of nominating" being open the entire
week with the annual mid-year election on February 9.
As ysual, nominations by the score will pour into the office of the
Election Board. There will appear interest aplenty in the coming affair
and, many a would-be politician will be flattered by viewing his name
Sn print as eligible for some worthy position. In the past, however, it
has! been shown that the fire and fervor of political endeavor will wane
somewhere around Friday and by the time election day rolls around
the following Tuesday, it will take many a prod on the part of the
nominees themselves to move the campus to the polls.
Stanford rarely sees the political pot boil as do many universities.
PeHiaps the lack of election fireworks is a blessing for it is inevitable that
needless feuds will spring from the intense excitement of even a univer
sity election. Witness, for example, the childish Hall-Row enmities
that have resulted in the past from even the mild campaigns staged here
in the University. We are thankful they have been few and short-lived!
With a decrease in personal squabbles, however, interest in repre
sentation has dropped. Theoretically the two should not be bound but
practically they seem inseparable, for in the heat of the battle personal
dislikes will arise.
The problem before the University now is crystallized in the desire
of a few to increase the interest of the campus in the coming election
without a recurrence of ancient feuds. It was accomplished in a
measure last year. Stanford has outgrown greatly its tendency toward
internal strife, so that a step in that direction need not be feared, and if,
following the California basketball game and midquarter exams, all
else but the election can be dropped from the student mind, a representa
tive group of officers is assured.
