# A 						Surprised Bruin
## 
### 
A certain group of young' men, commonly called the Stanford basket
ball team, outpassed, outguarded, and almost outscored the supposedly
invincible Blue and Gold quintet in the pavilion Saturday night. The
Bear came down to the Farm expecting to find honey in every tree
stump, ready and waiting to melt in his mouth, but when he lumbered
onto the floor he found a bee by the name of Vincenti and another by
the name of Anderson ready to ward off any attack he should make. The
result was that he got quite a sting and was barely able to get back to
his lair with a slight advantage in the form of an 18 to 17 victory.
The first game of the California series gave the Bruin the surprise
of his life, for he had been a two to one favorite. The game should also
make the Stanford student body sit up and take notice. The Stanford
players fought against unsurmountable odds and almost overcame them
—and there was very little support from those who should be backing
the team.
Our congratulations go to Coach Andy Kerr and every man who
played in that contest —they proved themselves made of the true Stanford
stuff —real fighters when fighters are needed. Those who preferred a
movie to the game Saturday might learn a lesson from this and be
prepared to do their bit when the time for the second game comes around.
