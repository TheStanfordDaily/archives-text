# JUNIORS WIN
## 
### 
Motor ability tests, which were
taken by all freshman and sophomore
women at the University of Oregon,
and by the Physical Education majors,
showed the junior majors to have the
highest average. Out of a possible
score of three, the freshmen and
sophomores scored an average of one
point each, the underclass majors two,
and the Junior majors an average of
three points.
