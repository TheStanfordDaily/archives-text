# THE 						RED PERIL OF PALO ALTO
## 
### (By Letitia Lemon 
My First Jolly-Up Continued
From Friday
Never before had I seen the rules
of propriety cast aside as they were
in this transformed den of debauchery.
The man who had accosted me per
sisted, but my good sense told me to
avoid him. Still he kept pursuing me.
I never would have given in to him
had not one of my friends told me not
to be a snob.
So I finally succumbed and let this
man to whom I had never been even
introduced put his arm about me.
(Even then I never would have yield
ed if I had not beenÂ»the last girl in
the room not dancing.) The first dance
was not disagreeable but when he
continued to stay with me after the
second dance I began to sence an
ulterior motive.
At the end of the trird dance I felt
it necessary that I ask him his name.
He told me that it was John Smith
and asked me mine. At the end of the
fourth dance I began to feey very
much alarmed at his persistence (the
partners of the other girls were al
ways changing), and when he asked
me if I didn't want to "go outside"
(I did not fully appreciate the mean
ing of this subterfuge then, but I in
stinctively refused), I knew that he
had no good intentions.
After my sixth dance with him I
was genuinely alarmed. I dared not
excuse myself for fear that he might
follow me again as he had before. The
seventh dance was the last and I
trembled with fear at what might fol
low. But my resistance had been suc
cessful, at the end of the dance John
Smith (I found out later that this was
not his real name), foiled in his at
tempts, left me in disgust.
