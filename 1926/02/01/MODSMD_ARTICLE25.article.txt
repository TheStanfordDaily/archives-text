A round-table discussion led by Dr.
C. F. Tolman of Stanford to collect all
of the available data on white sala
ceous shales of California and to
which Doctors L. B. Becking and
David Starr Jordan made important
contributions was â€¢ the chief feature
of popular interest in the program of
the meeting of the Pacific Branch of
the Geological Society of America held
at Stanford last Friday and Saturday.
The interest in this California shale
lies in the fact that it was in it that
most of the petroleum of the statfe
was formed. The origin and life his
tory of the mountain ranges of Nevada
and California was the subject of a
paper read by Professor W. M. Davis.
The chairman of this year's meeting
