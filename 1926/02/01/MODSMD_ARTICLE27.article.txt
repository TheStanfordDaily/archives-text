UNIVERSITY OP SOUTHERN
CALIFORNIAâ€”An exciting lottery
was held at the University of South
ern California recently when track
managers representing the various
fraternities drew lots for the honor of
carrying the colors of sonorities in
the Annual Interfraternity Track and
Field Meet. Suspense was added to
the drawing by the fact that there
were four more fraternities than
sororities, hence four fraternities were
destined to dra wblanks.
The sorority whose knights errant
win the meet will be awarded a silver
loving cup. The winning fraternity
will be presented with the usual cham
pionship placque, and the individual
point-winners will receive gold, silver,
and bronze medals.
