Rudolph Valentino is starred in
"The Eagle," now playing at the Im
perial Theatre, San Francisco. We fol
low his flight as a Roosian chaussier,
Roosian exile .Roosian bandit, Roosian
teacher, and Roosian lover. In spite
of this, however, the atmosphere of
the whole film is well preserved. It is
cast well. The sub-titles are full of
ironic comments —of the steeliest kind.
The plot is evidently popularized
from the Btage play, and film of "The
Czarina," in which Doris Keane and
Pola Negri respectively starred. It has
been considerably changed and
brought down to the level of the worst
of ug. The plot is the old story of the
queen's favorite, who loves another
and fairer maid, and who deserts the
queen for same maid, in spite of all
considerations of wealthy fame, and
power.
The picture stuff is sufficient enter
tainment to justify the predominant
Russian spirits.—H. K.
