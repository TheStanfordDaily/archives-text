## Blue and Gold Squad Holds Middleweight Team to One Field Goal 
### Joe Carroll 
Uncorking a fair passing game and
a defense that held the Cardinal mid
dleweights to a single field goal, the
University of California 145-pound
basketball team won the first game of
their annual series with Stanford Sat
urday night by a 17 to 7 score.
California started off with an attack
fast enough to net the Bruins a 13 to 3
lead at half time. During this period
Stanford did not make a single basket
and converted only three foul goals
out of ten free throws.
The second half told a different
story, as the Redshirts held California
even. The Bear tallies came from four
foul goals out of nine attempts. Cook
made the only field goal that Stanford
scored. His teammates hit the basket
for two points out of eight free shots.
Both teams played a fairly fast,
rough game. Fourteen fouls were
called on Stanford, while sixteen were
chalked up against the Berkeley boys.
Lerer and Magnesi of California were
both ruled out of the contest on per
sonal fouls.
George, at forward, played a good
floor game for the Cardinals. While
he made only one point, he put a lot
of fight in the Stanford team. Ankele
did some nice work at standing guard.
Bacigalupi, a substitute guard for
the University of California, was the
high man of the game with five points.
Tofanelli, forward, and Leith, center,
made four tallies apiece for the Bear
145-pounders. The Bruin team passed
well and broke rapidly into either
offensive or defensive formations.
The line-up was as follows:
Stanford (7) â€” California (17)
