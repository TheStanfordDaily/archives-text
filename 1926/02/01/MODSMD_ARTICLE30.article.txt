# U.S.C. Changes Schedule For Final Examinations
## 
### 
UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN
CALIFORNIA, Jan. 29.â€”Three exami- j
nations of two hours each will occur
on each day of the end-semester finals
at U.S.C. this year, according to a
new plan announced recently by the
officials of the university. This is a
complete change from the system
used last year in which only two
examinations two hours in length
could be given in a day.
The time that will be saved under
the new system in completing the I
examinations is a strong argument in
its favor. It will be a disadvantage to
some students, though, who will be ,
forced to take three finals in ope day. |
