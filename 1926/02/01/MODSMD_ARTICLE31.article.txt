"With a rush that netted them»to a 16
to 6 lead at the end of the half. The

basket. Thomas rang up the only field
goal that the Redshirts scored the
first half, the other points being gained
from free throws. Meanwhile the Cali
fornia offense garnered seven baskets
from the field, and two on fouls. The
Bruins were handling the ball nicely,

Berkeleyites. They were almost as
good as the team that started the
game.

guard for the Cardinals, but Larsen
and Sano both got into the game dur
ing the first half. Sano made a nice
shot from under the basket in the
