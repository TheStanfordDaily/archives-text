# DEBATERS RETURN TO CAMPUS AFTER UTAH COLLEGE TOUR
## 
### 
Youth's freedom in thought and ac
tion was defined as both an evil to
society and also as a means of solving i
society's problems by the Stanford de-;
baters, Theodore F. Baer and George j
N. Crocker, and their three opponents,
the University of Utah squad at Salt
Lake City, the Brigham Young Univer
sity at Provo, and the Utah Agricultural j
College at Logan, Utah. " Baer and
Crocker returned to the campus yester
day following their three debates.
"Resolved, That the freedom of
thought and action of the younger gene
ration is detrimental to the interests of
society" was the question for the three
forensic contests, the Cardinal pair up
holding the affirmative against their
opponents.
Oppose Utah
Utah, the first team to oppose the
Palo Altoans, was represented by John
Carlisle and Milton Badger. In this
debate, which was held in the university
assembly hall last Wednesday evening,
Crocker, telling of the increased crime
that he traced to youth's freedom, said
that the home was nothing more than
a telephone booth surrounded by sleep
ing rooms, which occasionally one is un- i
fortunately forced to spend some time!
in. He declared that youth could only
be saved by home and church influence.
Baer, the second Stanford speaker,
quoted statistics to prove that the free
dom of the younger generation'has led
to an increase in crime.
More freedom instead of the restric- 1
tion which younger generation now en- j
joys, was the plea of both Carlisle and
Badger, the Utah debaters. Badger
declared that crime was the result of,
economic conditions, and that modern
youth had given it no new stimulus.
Carlisle said that willingness to face
and think out the facts of life, whether
they be ugly or not. was something
which youth contributed to society. He
declared that youth possesses an ideal- j
ism that, if allowed expression, would
do a great deal to remedy many social j
evils. Freedom was defined as the right j
to think as one chooses and to do as one
chooses.
Both Stanford and Utah agreed that l
the church and home influences were'

the key to youth's training, and that a
more modern outlook should be taken
in order to give guidance. Parents who
broke the law in the prescncc of the
new generation came in for especial
criticism.
The Brigham Young University, the
second Stanford opponents, were con
tested the following night at Provo,
Utah. The debate, again a no-decision
contest, formed a part of the home
coming celebration held by the Utah
institution. More than two thousand
students and alumni formed the audi
ence for the debate.
Norman Christensen and Rodney
Pickett were the Utah Agricultural Col
lege debaters, who met the Stanford
pair Friday night. Although the Ag
gies and Stanford have met several
times at Stanford, this was the first time
the debate had been held at Utah. As
the debate was in the nature of an open
forum affair, no decision either by
judges or audience was given.
The Stanford men left for San Fran
cisco on the following day, arriving at
Stanford yesterday evening.

to an increase in crime.
More freedom instead of the restric- 1
tion which younger generation now en- j
joys, was the plea of both Carlisle and
Badger, the Utah debaters. Badger
declared that crime was the result of,
economic conditions, and that modern
youth had given it no new stimulus.
Carlisle said that willingness to face
and think out the facts of life, whether
they be ugly or not. was something
which youth contributed to society. He
declared that youth possesses an ideal- j
ism that, if allowed expression, would
do a great deal to remedy many social j
evils. Freedom was defined as the right j
to think as one chooses and to do as one
chooses.
Both Stanford and Utah agreed that l
the church and home influences were'

the key to youth's training, and that a
more modern outlook should be taken
in order to give guidance. Parents who
broke the law in the prescncc of the
new generation came in for especial
criticism.
The Brigham Young University, the
second Stanford opponents, were con
tested the following night at Provo,
Utah. The debate, again a no-decision
contest, formed a part of the home
coming celebration held by the Utah
institution. More than two thousand
students and alumni formed the audi
ence for the debate.
Norman Christensen and Rodney
Pickett were the Utah Agricultural Col
lege debaters, who met the Stanford
pair Friday night. Although the Ag
gies and Stanford have met several
times at Stanford, this was the first time
the debate had been held at Utah. As
the debate was in the nature of an open
forum affair, no decision either by
judges or audience was given.
The Stanford men left for San Fran
cisco on the following day, arriving at
Stanford yesterday evening.
Youth's freedom in thought and ac
tion was defined as both an evil to
society and also as a means of solving i
society's problems by the Stanford de-;
baters, Theodore F. Baer and George j
N. Crocker, and their three opponents,
the University of Utah squad at Salt
Lake City, the Brigham Young Univer
sity at Provo, and the Utah Agricultural j
College at Logan, Utah. " Baer and
Crocker returned to the campus yester
day following their three debates.
"Resolved, That the freedom of
thought and action of the younger gene
ration is detrimental to the interests of
society" was the question for the three
forensic contests, the Cardinal pair up
holding the affirmative against their
opponents.
Oppose Utah
Utah, the first team to oppose the
Palo Altoans, was represented by John
Carlisle and Milton Badger. In this
debate, which was held in the university
assembly hall last Wednesday evening,
Crocker, telling of the increased crime
that he traced to youth's freedom, said
that the home was nothing more than
a telephone booth surrounded by sleep
ing rooms, which occasionally one is un- i
fortunately forced to spend some time!
in. He declared that youth could only
be saved by home and church influence.
Baer, the second Stanford speaker,
quoted statistics to prove that the free
dom of the younger generation'has led
to an increase in crime.
