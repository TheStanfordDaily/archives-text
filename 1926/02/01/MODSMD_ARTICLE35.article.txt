# False Alarm Brings Out Fire Engines at Midnight
## 
### 
A false alarm turned in from a fra
ternity house caused the campus fire
department to rush all of its motor
equipment to the Alpha Phi house at
12:15 o'clock this morning, to find not
even a wisp of smoke in evidence but
only a crowd of expectant roughs.
Much to the disappointment of the im
promptu rooting section the firemen
turned around immediately and had
their trucks back in the firehouse a few
minutes after the alarm had been turn
ed in.
Chief Dugan knows the source of the
telephone call which brought out the
department, and the responsible parties
will be severly reprimanded.
