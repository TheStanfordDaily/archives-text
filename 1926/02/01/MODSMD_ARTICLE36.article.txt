# WORKS OF SPECIAL INTEREST IN NEXT SYMPHONY CONCERT
## 
### Herbert Klein 
A program of remarkable interest has
been prepared for the second concert
here of Alfred Hertz and the San Fran
cisco Symphony Orchestra on the even
ing of Tuesday, February 16. Four
compositions have been selected from
among the most popular and distinctive
work in musical literature.
An interesting parallel is found in two
of the modern numbers: "Danse
Macabre" by Saint-Saens and "The
Sorcerer's Apprentice" by Paul Dukas.
Both are comparatively recent com
positions of the French school; both
are "programme" music, as they tell a
story; and both are based on ancient
legends which they interpret in terms
of music. But musically the two are
an interesting contrast.
Dance of Death
"Danse Macabre" or "Dance of
Death" is based upon the ancient tale
that once each year at midnight Death
comcs to the graveyard, and seating
himself upon a tombstone, fiddles a
dance for the skeletons who come troop
ing from (he graves. The wild dance
goes on until the cock crows when
Death must leave and the skeletons
hurry back into their graves. In the
music death is heard tuning his ancient
fiddle, and the remarkably realistic imi
tation of a cock's crow that ends the
mad dance.
In "The Sorcerer's Apprentice" is
found a rare example of humor ex
pressed in music. The composer, Paul
Dukas, is a contemporary French com
poser, and one of the greatest masters
of orchestration in Europe. He took
for this piece the story of the disobedi
ent apprentice to the master sorcerer.
The novice overhears his master mak
ing his magical spells, and, while the
old man is away decides to try them

himself. He therefore charms a broom
stick to draw water from the river so
as to save himself work. The incanta-;
tion works perfectly but after enough j
water has been drawn the apprentice !
realizes that he has not learned how to !
turn the charm off. The broomstick'
continues to bring water which begins i
to flood everything; the apprentice is;
nearly frantic. Finally the sorccrer i
himself comes home and stops the '■
broomstick and drives the disobedient
apprentice away.
Humor in Music
The talc is handled with cleverness
and humor in the music. The jerky
motions of the broomstick and the
gurgling sound of the water as it rises
higher and higher is well imitated.
Thfe San Francisco Orchestra is one
of the foremost musical organizations
in the country. Under the leadership j
of Alfred Hertz it has developed in the j
last ten years to a position of preemi-!
nence. A feature of this orchestra is j
the number of women who play in it. j
There are six feminine members.

Illinois students are declared not as
riotous as they were a year ago.

of orchestration in Europe. He took
for this piece the story of the disobedi
ent apprentice to the master sorcerer.
The novice overhears his master mak
ing his magical spells, and, while the
old man is away decides to try them

himself. He therefore charms a broom
stick to draw water from the river so
as to save himself work. The incanta-;
tion works perfectly but after enough j
water has been drawn the apprentice !
realizes that he has not learned how to !
turn the charm off. The broomstick'
continues to bring water which begins i
to flood everything; the apprentice is;
nearly frantic. Finally the sorccrer i
himself comes home and stops the '■
broomstick and drives the disobedient
apprentice away.
Humor in Music
The talc is handled with cleverness
and humor in the music. The jerky
motions of the broomstick and the
gurgling sound of the water as it rises
higher and higher is well imitated.
Thfe San Francisco Orchestra is one
of the foremost musical organizations
in the country. Under the leadership j
of Alfred Hertz it has developed in the j
last ten years to a position of preemi-!
nence. A feature of this orchestra is j
the number of women who play in it. j
There are six feminine members.

Illinois students are declared not as
riotous as they were a year ago.
A program of remarkable interest has
been prepared for the second concert
here of Alfred Hertz and the San Fran
cisco Symphony Orchestra on the even
ing of Tuesday, February 16. Four
compositions have been selected from
among the most popular and distinctive
work in musical literature.
An interesting parallel is found in two
of the modern numbers: "Danse
Macabre" by Saint-Saens and "The
Sorcerer's Apprentice" by Paul Dukas.
Both are comparatively recent com
positions of the French school; both
are "programme" music, as they tell a
story; and both are based on ancient
legends which they interpret in terms
of music. But musically the two are
an interesting contrast.
Dance of Death
"Danse Macabre" or "Dance of
Death" is based upon the ancient tale
that once each year at midnight Death
comcs to the graveyard, and seating
himself upon a tombstone, fiddles a
dance for the skeletons who come troop
ing from (he graves. The wild dance
goes on until the cock crows when
Death must leave and the skeletons
hurry back into their graves. In the
music death is heard tuning his ancient
fiddle, and the remarkably realistic imi
tation of a cock's crow that ends the
mad dance.
In "The Sorcerer's Apprentice" is
found a rare example of humor ex
pressed in music. The composer, Paul
Dukas, is a contemporary French com
poser, and one of the greatest masters
of orchestration in Europe. He took
for this piece the story of the disobedi
ent apprentice to the master sorcerer.

ing his magical spells, and, while the
