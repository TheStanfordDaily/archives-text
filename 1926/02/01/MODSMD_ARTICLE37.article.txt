# PLANS FORMULATED FOR ENCINA FORMAL
## 
### 
Complete plans were formulated for
the annual Encina Club formal which
will take place February 19 at a meet
ing of the dance committee held Fri
day evening. It was decided, in view
of the crowded condition of the floor
at previous dances, that the number
of tickets to be sold will be limited to
150. These will go on sale in two
weeks.
Programs have been ordered which '
are exact duplicates of those distri- i
tuted at the Yale senior ball last year.
One of the best orchestras on the
coast is being secured, but the identity
of the band leader is being withheld,
along with information pertaining to
the decoration motif.
