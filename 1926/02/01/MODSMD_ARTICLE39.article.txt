"Lawyers in general practice are
repeatedly called upon for general ad
vice regarding the patent system,"
Mr. Lyon said, in discussing the lec
tures, "and the knowledge of the pat
ient system which should be had by
a lawyer in general use is practically
the same as the knowledge of this
system which the manufacturer or en
gineer should possess.
"It will be the object of the lec
tures to acquaint the industrial man
and the man in general law practice
with the patent system, insofar as the
industrial man must have such knowl
edge of his own protection, and inso
far as the general lawyer should know
the system as part of his equipment to
practice law."
