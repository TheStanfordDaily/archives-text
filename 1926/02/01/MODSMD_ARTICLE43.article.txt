# "BRICK" MORSE WILL RESIGN AS DIRECTOR OF CAL GLEE CLUB
## 
### 
Clinton ("Brick") Morse will resign
his position as director of the Univer
sity of California Glee Club according
to his own announcement. The re
signation comes following a row be
tween the director and the California
Associated Students executive com
mittee. Morse has held the position
for the last thirty years.
The student governing body refused
to sanction the Glee Club's annual
European tour a few days ago, on the
ground that the Glee Club's programs
had consisted too largely of jazz,
vaudeville and popular numbers, and
that they did not adequately represent
the university to the world. Morse
stated that light music was given
in response to public demand. He said,
"The Glee Club is self sustaining and
would not be a success unless it
catered to that demand."
Morse has refused to resist the de
mand for his resignation which friends
have urged him to do. Although the
execuitve committee was not unani
mous in its action Morse says he is
going to resign without any fight.
Morse said that he had investigated
rumors that there was drinking and
gambling among the club members on
its tours, but had found them untrue.
