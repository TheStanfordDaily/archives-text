# SPORTS OF 1926
## Football and Golf 
### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Do Football and Golf mix? Can a duck swim? Did you
ever hear of the Tulane University football team, unde
feated during 1925 and conquerors of Northwestern, who
beat Michigan, and the equal of Missouri, who beat
Nebraska? Well, one of the mainstays of the Tulane var
sity was none other than Fred Lamprecht, intercollegiate
goif champion of the U.S.A. Lamprecht played first in the
line, then as fullback, and then as end as a receiver of
forward passes. Whether or not the quarterback yelled
"fore" before giving the ball to Fred, I do not know, but
he certainly could drive holes through the opposing for
wards.
Emerson Carey, Jr., elected captain of the 1926 Cornell
varsity, is another star football player who also shines
on the linksâ€”or the other way 'round, if you prefer it.
Carey was one of the best guards in the East; in fact, he

was the one Cornell player that Gil Dobie thought enough of to mention as
All-American caliber. As a golfer, Carey was good enough to win the Western
junior championship.
There are other football players of the present who also can show to
advantage with a niblick or a brassie, and many football stars of other days
have gone in for golf seriously with splendid results. Eddie Driggs, of
Princeton, Long Island itmateur champion, is one who recently won new
honors, and, to go further back, "Snake" Ames, also of Princeton, and Brink
Thorne, of Yale, are two who stand out. Amos Alonzo Stagg was one of the
founders of the huge Olympic Fields Golf Club, near Chicago. He, Gil Dobie,
and "Gloomy Gus" Henderson are the best golf players among the football
coaches.
