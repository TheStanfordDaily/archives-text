# GORDON DAVIS WILL ORGANIZE CLASS IN THEATRE DIRECTION
## All University Students Are Eligible for New Course; Meets Tomorrow 
### 
In order to fill the need for student
directors, a class in theatrical direc
tion will be organized immediately
under the supervision of Gordon Davis.
He will meet interested students to
morrow night at 7:30 o'clock in the
Green Room in the English building.
The class, which is open to all, will
be organized under the system of
elimination, cuts to be made monthly.
Although at present the course will be
considered an activity, University
credit may be given for it in the fu
ture.
While at present the positions of
electrician and business manager are
occupied by students chosen by the
tryout system, under a technical di
rector, there has been no place made
for the students who are interested
in directing. Not only will this class
give these students an opportunity for
getting some practical experience in
directing, hut it will be of assistance
to those students who want to follow
up theatrical work out of college, such
as in Community Little Theatre work,
and dramatic coaching in high schools
and colleges. It will supplement some
of the work of the public speaking
department in this line.
"What I hope to do with this group,"
said Davis, "is to develop a corps of
assistant directors who will be capable
of directing student shows. I will be
able to recommend them to outside
schools on the peninsula which need
students to direct theri plays."
The work of the class will be in
assisting in the actual directing of
plays during the quarter. In time the
students can take over an act, or a
whole rehearsal.
