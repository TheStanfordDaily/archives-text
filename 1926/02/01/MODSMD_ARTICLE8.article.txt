# STRONG BERKELEY YEARLINGS BEAT HUNT'S FIVE 26-16
## OUTCOME LONG IN DOUBT Light Stanford Aggregation Succumbs to Powerful Attack of Cubs 
### Cliff McDowell 
Showing unusual strength in both
defensive and offensive departments,
the California freshmen won the first
game of the annual basketball series
from the Cardinal babes by a score
of 26 to 16. The score in no wise indi
cates the clo/eness of the contest, and
it was not until the last part of the
second half that the outcome was sure.
At half time the California frosh
led 10 to 7, and after five minutes of
play in the second half the Stanford
babes were leading 13 to 10. The game
was one of the most fiercely fought
contests seen this year.
The tall, rangy players from across
the bay weVe able to intercept many
of the Stanford passes and convert
them into score-making plays. It was
evident from the start that the lighter
Stanford team was playing under a
handicap.
McCandless, the center for the
Cardinal freshmen, stood out above
every other player on the court. He
emerged high-point man of the game,
making ten markers, three more than
any California man made. Aside from
his remarkable shooting, McCandless
distinguished himself by his floor
work. His passing was excellent and
his defensive play kept the Berkeley
team from running up a larger score.
Gregory and Wyatt tied for scoring
honors for the visitors with seven
points each.
Sexson and Crary, who started at
the forward positions for the Cardinal
babes, played good basketball, but
were too light to effectively break
through the California defense. Sib
bett and Wilton, who started the sec
ond half as forwards, brought new life
into the team, but were unable to hold
the lead they succeeded in making.
Kopp went in at center and McCand
less was shifted to forward in the
latter part of the game, and demon
strated that he can hold the center
job very well. McCandless was just
as good at forward as he had been
at center. Lewis and Worden, Stanford
guards, were unable to break up the
Blue and Gold offense. Coach Hunt's
men fought until the final gun, but
the combination of Wyatt, Gregory,
and Corbin was too much to overcome.
