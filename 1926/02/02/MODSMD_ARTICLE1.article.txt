Louis Mercado and John Sano, a
member of the 130 basketball team,

from an entry list of seventeen in the
featherweight class. The former has

several close decisions, while McCall

will no doubt show him the hardest
fight of the featherweight matches.
The match between Goldwater and
Raaf should be one of the feature
events of the evening. Raaf is an ex
ceptionally tall lightweight, with a
