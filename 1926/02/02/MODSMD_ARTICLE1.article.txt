in the pavilion. Twenty-five cents will
be charged for admission the charges
to be used by Circle ( 'S" society for

The fourteen finalists for tonight's
matches have been singled from an
entry list of more than a hundred stu
dents. Elimination bouts have been
fought in the Encina gymnasium dur
ing the past week.
Louis Mercado and John Sano, a
member of the 130 basketball team,
will tangle in the only fight of the ron
tamweight class. As no other entries
were made in this division, the final
tonight will decide the championship.
Sano is favored to win over his fresh
man opponent, largely because of the
.advantages of age and experience.
Burgess vs. McCall
Burgess and McCall are the finalists
from an entry list of seventeen in the
featherweight class. The former has
advavneed to the finals by virtue of
several close decisions, while McCall
lias shown his ability to hit hard and
fast in knockouts during the elimina
tion rounds. McCall should win hon
ors in this match, although Burgess
will no doubt show him the hardest
fight of the featherweight matches.
The match between Goldwater and
Raaf should be one of the feature
events of the evening. Raaf is an ex
ceptionally tall lightweight, with a
long reach and clever footwork. Gold
water has been far superior to his
previous opponents, eliminating sev
eral via the knockout route, and has
shown ability to give and take punish
ment. The two have met several
times in past matches, with Goldr
water coming out ahead of his larger
opponent. He is favored to win to
night by decision, although the bouts
should be fast and close.
Keerl Favored
Welterweight finalists are Bob
Keerl and Harry Stevenson. Keerl
defeated Cowan in a close bout yes
terday, the match going four rounds
before the judges could decide on the
better man. Keerl shows a hard, fast
punch which has proved too much for j
his opponents in previous matches, !
but has been bothered by an injury of
his left hand. He should defeat Stev
enson unless the hand seriously handi
caps his hitting.
Felix Farewell won his way into the
finals of the middleweight division by 1
defeating Zieber in another four-round ;
semi-final yesterday afternoon. The
two opponents for tonight's bout are
evenly matched, and ability to go an
extra round should decide the winner.
Sluggers on Deck
Mustain and Dorman, the light- j
heavyweight fighters, should stage a
slugging match for the benefit of the
audience this evening. The former
will probably win due to his superior
hitting ability. O'Sullivan and Hazel
tine, the heavyweight contenders, are
another even pair, with the breaks of
the bout promising to determine the
champion.
Jack Feeley of Palo Alto will ref
eree the contests, while Fred FYehe
and Mort Blackburn will be the judges.
Three rounds of one minute and a
half each will compose each bout,
while an extra frame will be called in
case of draw decisions. Tickets may
be purchased at the pavilion.

will no doubt show him the hardest
fight of the featherweight matches.
The match between Goldwater and
Raaf should be one of the feature
events of the evening. Raaf is an ex
ceptionally tall lightweight, with a
long reach and clever footwork. Gold
water has been far superior to his
previous opponents, eliminating sev
eral via the knockout route, and has
shown ability to give and take punish
ment. The two have met several
times in past matches, with Goldr
water coming out ahead of his larger
opponent. He is favored to win to
night by decision, although the bouts
should be fast and close.
Keerl Favored
Welterweight finalists are Bob
Keerl and Harry Stevenson. Keerl
defeated Cowan in a close bout yes
terday, the match going four rounds
before the judges could decide on the
better man. Keerl shows a hard, fast
punch which has proved too much for j
his opponents in previous matches, !
but has been bothered by an injury of
his left hand. He should defeat Stev
enson unless the hand seriously handi
caps his hitting.
Felix Farewell won his way into the
finals of the middleweight division by 1
defeating Zieber in another four-round ;
semi-final yesterday afternoon. The
two opponents for tonight's bout are
evenly matched, and ability to go an
extra round should decide the winner.

heavyweight fighters, should stage a
slugging match for the benefit of the

another even pair, with the breaks of
the bout promising to determine the
champion.
Jack Feeley of Palo Alto will ref
eree the contests, while Fred FYehe

from an entry list of seventeen in the
featherweight class. The former has
advavneed to the finals by virtue of

fight of the featherweight matches.
