# English Soprano Ursula Greville To Sing Tonight
## 
### Herbert Klein 
Ursula Greville, lyric soprano, will
be heard in recital tonight presented
by the Committee on Public Exercises
as one of the Tuesday evening series
of entertainments. The concert will
start at 7:30 o'clock in the Assembly
hall.
Miss Greville started her vocal
career six years ago in England, her
home. Since then she has taken promi
nent operatic roles, sung as soloist
with noted orchestras, and success
fully on the concert stage, both in
Europe and in America. She has come
to be known as a foremost exponent
of the best in modern and ultra-mod
ern vocal music as well as achieving
the reputation of a classical singer of
note. Critics have pronounced her
voice one of extraordinary purity and
flexibility. Her upper range is very
high so that she has been successful
in singing some of the most difficult
coloratura songs.
Program Divided
The program tonight is divided into
four groups according to the mood
and subject of the songs rather than
their dates of composition. Beginning
with "Folk Songs" the program goes
through "Songs of Despair," "Tree
Songs," and "Songs of Trust and
Treachery." A large part of these are
new and have not been heard on the
campus. Miss Greville has the distinc
tion of being the prophet and exponent
of the new and interesting in music
and her programs are arranged with
this idea in view. She will be accom
panied by Therese Bauer.
Several poets of note are the au
thors of the lyrics of these songs. The
list includes Walter de la Mare and
Bliss Carman.
Is An Editor
Miss Greville is prominent in mod
ern music not only as a singer but
also as an editor and critic. Her musi
cal periodical, "The Sackbut," is
among the most influential and pro
gressive publications of its kind in
England. She has had several songs
composed especially for her voice that
would be impossible for most other
singers because of technical difficul
ties and high notes.
Her operatic roles include the diffi
cult part of "Queen of the Night" in
Mozart's "Magic Flute." Last year she
was soloist at the first New York
concert of the International Composers
Guild, and later for the New York
State Symphony Orchestra. Her tours
have taken her before audiences
throughout the British Isles, Germany,
Austria, and Spain.
