# CARDINAL QUINTET LEAVES FOR HARD SOUTHERN SERIES
## START TONIGHT ON LARK Will Play Two Games With Rejuvenated U.S.C. Five, Meet Branch Once 
### Jim Adams 
Disappointed over the defeat by the
Bears but encouraged by an unher
alded strong showing, fourteen Stan
ford basketball players along with
Coach Andy Kerr and Manager Bill
Tucker, will leave tonight on the Lark
for Los Angeles where they are sche
duled to play a hard three-game series
with U.S.C. and the Southern Branch.
In the first tilt, Thursday night, the
Cards will encounter a rejuvenated
Trojan team which is of a different
make-up than the one the Redshirts
beat a week ago. Coach Les Turner
now has Gene Dorsey and Bruce Mac-
Haffle in the lineup, and the U.S.C.
quintet is considerably strengthened
thereby. Friday night the Grizzlies,
who handed the Stanford team a lac
ing on their recent northern trip, will
meet Kerr's men. U.S.C. will play the
Cards again Saturday night to end up
the series. All the games will be
staged in the Olympic Auditorium and
a large crowd is expected to turn out
to see the Stanford five in action
againßt the best of the South.
Start Reserves Friday
Coach Kerr is taking with him Cap
tain Price, David, Clark, David, Bry
ant, Jayred, Steele, Rupe, Vincenti,
Mitchell, Shipkey, Christ, Anderson,
Newhouse, and Biaggini. In view of
the fact that it would be too much
of a task for the first five to play
three games on three successive eve
nings it is planned to start the sub
stitutes against the Southern Branch
team and give the regulars a rest.
Kerr will probably use Christ, Bryant,
Rupe, Shipkey, and Newhouse in this
affair.
The Cards will not have the easy
time against the Trojans that they
had in their last game. The addition
of Dorsey and MacHaffle give Boyer
the necessary support for him to im
bibe more freely in his favorite sport
of sinking baskets. By virtue of one
victory to their credit and their sur
prising showing against California,
however, the Stanford five is favored
to take both contests from the U.S.C.
squad.
Grizzlies Classy Team
In the Grizzlies the Redshirts will
meet one of the classiest basketball
teams on the Coast and inasmuch as
the regulars will not see much action
the Branch is conceded an easy vic
tory.
While in Los Angeles the team will
be quartered at the Alexandria Hotel.
Wednesday afternoon the varsity is
scheduled for a work-out in the Olym
pic Auditorium and that night the
Stanford Alumni Club of Los Angeles
will entertain them as guests of honor
at a dinner. The squad will return
home on the "Sunset Express" Sunday
evening.

duled to play a hard three-game series
with U.S.C. and the Southern Branch.
In the first tilt, Thursday night, the
Cards will encounter a rejuvenated
Trojan team which is of a different
make-up than the one the Redshirts
beat a week ago. Coach Les Turner
now has Gene Dorsey and Bruce Mac-
Haffle in the lineup, and the U.S.C.
quintet is considerably strengthened
thereby. Friday night the Grizzlies,
who handed the Stanford team a lac
ing on their recent northern trip, will
meet Kerr's men. U.S.C. will play the
Cards again Saturday night to end up
the series. All the games will be
staged in the Olympic Auditorium and
a large crowd is expected to turn out
to see the Stanford five in action
againßt the best of the South.
Start Reserves Friday
Coach Kerr is taking with him Cap
tain Price, David, Clark, David, Bry
ant, Jayred, Steele, Rupe, Vincenti,
Mitchell, Shipkey, Christ, Anderson,
Newhouse, and Biaggini. In view of
the fact that it would be too much
of a task for the first five to play
three games on three successive eve
nings it is planned to start the sub
stitutes against the Southern Branch
team and give the regulars a rest.
Kerr will probably use Christ, Bryant,
Rupe, Shipkey, and Newhouse in this
affair.
The Cards will not have the easy
time against the Trojans that they
had in their last game. The addition
of Dorsey and MacHaffle give Boyer
the necessary support for him to im
bibe more freely in his favorite sport
of sinking baskets. By virtue of one
victory to their credit and their sur
prising showing against California,
however, the Stanford five is favored
to take both contests from the U.S.C.
squad.
Grizzlies Classy Team
In the Grizzlies the Redshirts will
meet one of the classiest basketball
teams on the Coast and inasmuch as
the regulars will not see much action
the Branch is conceded an easy vic
tory.
While in Los Angeles the team will
be quartered at the Alexandria Hotel.
Wednesday afternoon the varsity is
scheduled for a work-out in the Olym
pic Auditorium and that night the
Stanford Alumni Club of Los Angeles
will entertain them as guests of honor
at a dinner. The squad will return
home on the "Sunset Express" Sunday
evening.
Disappointed over the defeat by the
Bears but encouraged by an unher
alded strong showing, fourteen Stan
ford basketball players along with
Coach Andy Kerr and Manager Bill
Tucker, will leave tonight on the Lark
for Los Angeles where they are sche
duled to play a hard three-game series
with U.S.C. and the Southern Branch.
