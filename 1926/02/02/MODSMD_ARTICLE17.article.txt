# A 						New Editor
## 
### 
John N. Levi was elected editor of The Daily Palo Alto for the
rest of the college year at the regular staff election this afternoon. Levi
formally takes over the editorial reins next Tuesday.
The past few weeks have been the first ones in a long time preceding
a Daily election when the staff has not been a hotbed of political hubbub.
Levi received his position unanimously without internal opposition of
any sort. He has easily outdistanced his competitors, and we feel confi
dent in his ability to navigate safely the storm-threatened waters of
campus opinion.
Levi's record on the Daily during the past six quarters has been a story
of hard jobs well done. He has held a wide variety of positions and suc
ceeded in every one. During the past term he has been managing editor
and as such has been largely responsible for the improved appearance in the
make-up of the Daily Palo Alto.
