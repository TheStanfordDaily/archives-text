# Senior Dues
## 
### 
Efforts are l)eing made by the officers of the 1926 class to collect a
large percentage of the class dues outstanding at the present time. Ad
mitting that it is decidedly discouraging and very much of a nuisance to
be forced to pay over two dollars to the class at this time of the year, The
Daily Palo Alto nevertheless feels that every senior should make an
earnest effort to meet his obligation to the class.
The graduating class has many expenses arising at the time of com
mencement and senior week, and in addition it is customary for the senior
class to leave a gift of some sort to the University. For these reasons it
will be seen that the senior year of all years is the one in which dues should
be paid promptly. The officers must have assets in the treasury so that
they will be able to look to the closing of the class's activities and prepare
to finish the year without financial embarassment.
No senior will be allowed to have his name on the senior roll unless
he has paid his dues to the class. Committees are at work now collecting
the money, and it is to l>e hoped that the members of the class of 1926 will
co-operate with them, and will pay up promptly.
