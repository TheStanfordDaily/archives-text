Declaring that prohibition is a farce and that it has already tried and
convicted itself, Senator Edward I. Edwards of New Jersey branded
the leaders of the Anti-Saloon League as a band of unconscionable and
inordinate bigots whose only claim to recognition and fame is their
moronic normalization, in a recent speech before the Association Against
the Prohibition Amendment, and reported in the Daily Mini.
Edwards described the Volstead Act as the ''most despotic, corrupt,
tyrannical and autocratic piece of class legislation ever placed upon the
statute books in a once free country, "According to him prohibition is a
more vital issue now than it was five years ago.
It is true that the columns of the daily newspapers are as filled with
prohibition enforcement data now as they were five or six years ago.
The law is certainly not meeting with success, or as Senator Edwards
says, it would not be the "burning, palpitating, red-blooded national
issue (that it is) today. And when the law is proving so unsuccessful,
perhaps the efforts of some very capable and energetic senators will meet
with success—and then there will be an amendment allowing at least
light wines and beers.
