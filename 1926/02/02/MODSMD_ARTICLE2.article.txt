# ENGINEERS TO HEAR TALKS BY RYAN AND DURAND AT SMOKER
## 
### 
A smoker tor engineering students
and intending engineering majors will
be given tomorrow evening at 7:30
o'clock in the lobby of the Old Union,
by the Stanford branches of the Amer
ican Institute of Electrical Engineers
and the American Society of Mechan
ical Engineers.
C. V. Moroney, superintendent of the
West Coast Sugar Refining Company,
will be the chief speaker of the eve
ning. His subject will be of general
interest to engineering students. Pro
fessor 11. J. Ryan and Dr. W. F.
Durand, past national presidents of
the American Instituto of Electrical
Engineers and the American Society
of Mechanical Engineers, respectively,
and Professor G. H. Marx will be the
other speakers.
Each of the societies will present an
original skit. The meeting is of espe
cial importance because it is being
given by the two largest engineering
organizations of the University com
bined, and because of the presence at
the smoker of two past national presi
dents. Professor Ryan was president
of the American Institute of Electrical
Engineers in 1924 and Dr. Durand has
recently resigned his office as presi
dent of the American Society of Me
chanical Engineers.
One of the chief purposes of the
smoker is to give prospective engi
neers in the lower division an oppor
tunity to become acquainted with the
members of the two organizations.
