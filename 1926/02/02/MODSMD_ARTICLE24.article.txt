The spitball pitchers seem to be nearing the end of the
slimy trail. Their saliva won't dampen the diamonds for
very many years longer, and be the cause of long-drawn-out
games and infield errors. •
Look over the list of the spitters now in the majors. All
of them have seen at least ten years of major league ser
vice, and their average age is thirty-five years. It doesn't
require much vision to see the year when this trick delivery
will be a thing of the past. The rule, passed several years
ago, that barred newcomers from ever using this method of
pitching was a good thing. Of course it was only fair to
permit the hurlers who earned their living by throwing
the "spitter" to continue to use it, but during the 1925 sea
son only a few of these were really effective.
Stanley Coveleskie of the champion Washington Sena
tors stood head and shoulders over any other spit ball

pitcher last year. Although he was ineffective against Pittsburgh in the world
series, losing two games, he led the American League with twenty wins and
six losses for a percentage of .800. Old Jack Quinn won thirteen and lost
eleven, while Urban "Red" Faber won one less than Quinn and lost the same
number. Another Urban, Urban Shocker, also won twelve, but lost thirteen
gar
In the National League the spitball pitchers fared much worse than those
in i c younger circuit—SothOron, Mitchell, and Grimes all losing more games
than they won, the total for the three being thirty victories and forty-six
defeats. Clarence Mitchell, of the Phillies, is the. only left-handed "spitter" in
captivity.
