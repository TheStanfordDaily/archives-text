THE TRUE PURPOSE AND VALUE
OF A STREET CAR
Grand Forks, N. D. (North Dakota) j
—Special Dispatch A.P.— (Amalga
mated Penpushers):
Students at the University of North
Dakota have recently been having a
"grand old time" quarreling over the j
respective merits and demerits of a
"Street Car Prom": which translated |
means that they have been contem- j
plating the advisability of inaugurat-1
ing a prom, the sole means of trans- 1
portation to and from which should ■
be street cars.
Although the proponents of this uni-'
form transportation system favored
the wholesale acquisition of taxicabs,
they abandoned this idea because of
the fact that the taxi companies re
fused to violate their "meter principle"
by furnishing special flat rates to the
students for this affair.
To quote from the North Dakota
Student:
"The street car company offers to
provide special cars to and from the j
prom. Ample room, both going and
coming, is promised by the company."
However, we fail to discover from
the article whether or not any special
form of seclusion is to be furnished
(dim lights, curtains, etc.) for those
who are amorously inclined.
Reading further we see, "Up to the
present time, the co-eds have been ]
the main objectors to the idea, their
reasons being that it takes away from
the dignity of the prom and that the >
snow which is very liable to be pres-1
ent at the time of the prom will spoil
their pumps."
Cabbages doesn't see why in the 1
world the girls should be afraid of
spoiling their pumps. We feel certain
that the gallant males would be only i
too glad of seizing this opportunity of
playing "hero" by carrying the timid
dance partners across the snow in
their brawny arms.
Why not have a democratic prom
of this sort at Stanford? Imagine the
possibilities of a "Toonerville Prom."
We could even go farther and ex-1
elude Tuxedos, making cords or dirty
flannels the badge of admission.

On the other hand, this sort of a
prom might not be so successful at
Stanford unless the street car com- j
pany put in branch lines to the cactus
gardens and Roble bridge.

There was a young fellow from Lutz
Whose father was partial to butts,
In an alley he spies,
A cigar, Bankers size,
His intentions were stopped by a Stuts.

Two tobacco-chewing freshmen were
wending their way hungrily toward
Encina hall after the Cit. Midterm,
when the following conversation en
sued :
First T.C.F.—Do you expect to rate
under that fellow in front of you?
Second T.C.F.—"Yeh!"
