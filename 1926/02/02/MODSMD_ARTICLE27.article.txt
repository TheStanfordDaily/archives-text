"DANCING MOTHERS"
President Theater, San Francisco
Here is a play that starts out con
ventionally enough: The mother is
nearing forty; she is being neglected
by her husband and her 19-year-old
daughter is making a bee line for the
bow-wows with drinking, smoking, and
wild parties. The poor mother decides
to have a fling at life herself before it
is too late. So far so good. The tra
ditional outcome would be for the hus
band to get jealous and come back to
the fold of the family and the daughter
would realize that she had been set
ting her mother a bad example and
start staying home nights; so that the
final curtain would go down on a hap
pily reunited and never-to-be-parted
again family group. But it doesn't
happen that way at all. It ends real
istically and logically with a situation
faintly suggestive of Ibsen's "Doll's
House." The father and daughter are
home but mamma has gone and isn't
coming back, either.
There are very few dull spots; the
lines are good and everything runs
smoothly. Although the plot is de
cidedly unusual, there is a feeling of
inevitability in the way it works out.
Florence Roberts as the mother who
makes herself master of her fate, and
Leneta Lane as the spoiled and speedy
daughter take the honors of the show
from the male members of the cast.
Frederik Vogeding as the indulgent
father and unfaithful husband seems
always to be shouting and on the verge
of an apoplectic stroke. Kenneth
Daigneau seems destined to be the
dastardly villain at the opening of the
drama, for he plays the role of a
wealthy and unreliable bachelor who
is supposed to be getting the daughter
of the house into his clutches, but by
the end of the play he has gone up
several hundred points in the au
dience's estimation. Ho is convincing
and compelling in his love making.
This play is especially recommend
ed for those jaded souls who will
wager large sums that they can tell
the finish of a play after seeing the
first act. It may not be a masterpiece
but it is something different and a
good evening's entertainment.
