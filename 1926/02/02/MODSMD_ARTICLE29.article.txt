# STANFORD STUDENT SEEKS CURE FOR RATTLESNAKE BITE
## Experiments to Find Serum for Anti-Toxin to Rattler s Poison 
### Templeton Peck 
To develop a serum which will build
up an immunity from rattlesnake poi
son is the object of an unusual series
of experiments to be conducted in the
psychology laboratories by Leonanle
Keeler, a research student in psy
chology.
Keeler's hypothesis is that by re
peatedly introducing minute amounts
of rattlesnake poison into the blood
stream of small animals, such as rats,
he can, if the doses are small enough,
prevent them from dying, so that,
through the natural activity of the
blood in attacking the poison, an anti
toxin will be developed which can be
obtained for the use of man. The
serum will be taken directly from the
blood of the rats.
First Plan Dangerous
A previous plan of the experiment
was to attempt to render the animals
immune and if this were successful,
Keeler intended to inject the poison
directly into "his own body in very
minute quantities and observe the re
sult. The heads of the department
discouraged this plan, however, as be
ing unduly dangerous.
The rattlers which will supply the
poiso nto be used in the experiments
are now confined in the zoology labor
atories. The largest of the four
snakes, all of which were captured by
Keeler, is forty-two inches in length,
and has seven rattles.
Rattlesnake bites, while rarely fatal
if properly attended to, are neverthe
less a serious occurrence, and the fear
of them keep many people from en
joying the mountains and the deserts
which are the snake's habitat.
Is Mountaineer
Keeler is an experienced mountain
climber and naturalist and collects his
snakes on occasional excursions into
the Sierras. He has never been bit
ten by a rattler, but was once struck
at while extracting the fangs from a
large specimen. He received a gen
erous squirt of the poisonous liquid
in an eye. After removing the fangs,
of a snake caught on the trail which
renders the snake practically harm
less, Keeler carries it in a flour sack.
At his home in Berkeley, Keeler
formerly kept a large collection of
snakes, including two young boa con
strictors. One escaped into the hills,
causing a sensation in the newspapers.
A litter of fourteen young rattlers was
born in captivity, a very rare occur
rence. One survived for more than a
year, shedding its skin seven times
during the period and leaving a but
ton each time. This fact has con
vinced Keeler that the number of rat
tles which a snake bears does not nec
essarily equal his age in years, as is
the popular belief.

Rattlesnake bites, while rarely fatal
if properly attended to, are neverthe
less a serious occurrence, and the fear
of them keep many people from en
joying the mountains and the deserts
which are the snake's habitat.
Is Mountaineer
Keeler is an experienced mountain
climber and naturalist and collects his
snakes on occasional excursions into
the Sierras. He has never been bit
ten by a rattler, but was once struck
at while extracting the fangs from a
large specimen. He received a gen
erous squirt of the poisonous liquid
in an eye. After removing the fangs,
of a snake caught on the trail which
renders the snake practically harm
less, Keeler carries it in a flour sack.
At his home in Berkeley, Keeler
formerly kept a large collection of
snakes, including two young boa con
strictors. One escaped into the hills,
causing a sensation in the newspapers.
A litter of fourteen young rattlers was
born in captivity, a very rare occur
rence. One survived for more than a
year, shedding its skin seven times
during the period and leaving a but
ton each time. This fact has con
vinced Keeler that the number of rat
tles which a snake bears does not nec
essarily equal his age in years, as is
the popular belief.
To develop a serum which will build
up an immunity from rattlesnake poi
son is the object of an unusual series
of experiments to be conducted in the
psychology laboratories by Leonanle
Keeler, a research student in psy
chology.
Keeler's hypothesis is that by re
peatedly introducing minute amounts
of rattlesnake poison into the blood
stream of small animals, such as rats,
he can, if the doses are small enough,
prevent them from dying, so that,
through the natural activity of the
blood in attacking the poison, an anti
toxin will be developed which can be
obtained for the use of man. The
serum will be taken directly from the
blood of the rats.
First Plan Dangerous
A previous plan of the experiment
was to attempt to render the animals
immune and if this were successful,
Keeler intended to inject the poison
directly into "his own body in very
minute quantities and observe the re
sult. The heads of the department
discouraged this plan, however, as be
ing unduly dangerous.
The rattlers which will supply the
poiso nto be used in the experiments
are now confined in the zoology labor
atories. The largest of the four
snakes, all of which were captured by
Keeler, is forty-two inches in length,
and has seven rattles.
