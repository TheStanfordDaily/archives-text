# TREES IN ARBORETUM REPRESENT CLIMATES OF MANY COUNTRIES

By Calvin Wood
Plants from almost every climate
and region in the world can be suc
cessfully grown in the Arboretum.
Such regions of extreme range of cli
mate as Alaska, the West Indies, Nor
way, the Caucasus, the Himalayas,
China, and the Sahara, are represented
by plants which are growing on the
University grounds.
An arboretum, contrary to the popu
lar conception, is not solely a park
full of trees and interesting plants. It
is a scientific institution of practical
utility and benefit to various branches ,
of science. A personnel of scientifi
cally trained men, botanists, students
of forestry, and landscape designers,
carry on the practical work of an j
arboretum. It has 011 its grounds well
eqipped laboratories, herbaria, and
libraries.
The beginnings of Stanford's arbo
retum were laid by the Stanfords
when the University grounds were
their country estate. In the first years
of the institution little attention was j
paid to it. Eucalyptus trees, planted j
to protect young trees of more valu-1
able and rarer species, were allowed •
to crowd and hinder the growth of the
valuable ones. Efforts to beautify the
campus and develop the arboretum
were not started until ten years ago.
A plan has been suggested to ex
tend the arboretum into a series of
beautiful parks along San* Francis
quito creek and 011 adjoining hills to
Searsville lake, from there possibly
to join other parks about Crystal lakes
and along the Skyline boulevard to
the coast.
Advice for the development of the
arboretum has been given by John |
McLaren, the designer of Golden Gate
park, and landscape designer of the
Panama Pacific International Exposi
tion. The grounds are under the gen
eral supervision of Ur. Leltoy Abrams,
professor of botany, and under the
immediate charge of Gardener Dailey,
an expert landscape designer and for
mer Stanford student.
