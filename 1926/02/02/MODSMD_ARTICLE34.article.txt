## 
### 
According to A. E. Roth, plans have
been completed for a $40,000 apart
ment house to be the residence of
four members of the University fac
, ulty, and which will be located be
tween Sequoia hall and Dr. Jordan's
house. Dr. Alonzo Taylor, of the Food
Research Institute, Professor Frank
Alfred Golder and Ralph H. Lutz of
the history department, and John H.
Sellards, Director of the Summer
Quarter and Endowment Secretary,
will be the joint tenants and owners .
of the house. They will lease the
grounds from the University.
Construction of the building will be
under the supervision of the Univer-
sity and has been contracted for by
Bakewell and Brown. The architec
ture will be made to harmonize with
the rest of the university buildings,
with a stucco roof, and sandstone fin-
ish. This is the first building of its
kind to be erected on the campus, and
corresponds in design to the individ-
ually owned apartment houses which
have been recently constructed in
large cities.
Before graduating, students of the
University of Southern California:
must be able to pass an examination
in spelling.
