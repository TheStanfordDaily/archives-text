# CARD TENNIS STARS DECISIVELY DEFEAT SOUTHERN BRANCH
## Stanford Players Take Every Matchâ€”Southerners Win One Doubles Set 
### 
With loss of but a single set, the
varsity tennis team yesterday crushed
the University of California, Southern
Branch, in the first intercollegiate
tournament of the season. The visitors
were unused to the asphalt courts and
with this handicap fell victims in all
five singles and both doubles matches.
Cranston Holman, premier Cardinal
player, defeated Alan Duff, ranking
star of the Branch, in a loosely-played
encounter. Holman took an early lead
from Duff but under the continued
"dinking" play of the latter became
listless and the last set went to deuce
games. The score stood five games all,
with Holman serving. Duff won the
first two points but Holman, becoming
aroused, followed his crashing service
to the net, gathered in the necessary
points, and on the next game ran out
the match 6-2, 7-5.
Alan Herrington fared better against
Fred Houser, Branch representative,
in the second singles tilt. After a
period of slight unsteadiness, he set
tled down and took the match 6-4, 6-2.
Houser played clever ball, sneaking
in several placements to end long
rallies, but in the majority of ex
changes he lost to Herrington's forc
ing drives.
Paul Fairchild, No. 3 of the Stan
ford team, fought a hard first set with
Robert Stanford, of the Blue and Gold,
but came back strong in the second
set to score an 8-6, 6-1 victory. Stan
ford opened the play with an effective
service and drive which prolonged the
issue through deuced games. Fairchild
slowly warmed to his task and in the
later contests had things all his way.
Gomer Thomas and Ralph McEl
venny, playing fourth and fifth man,
respectively, settled their matches in
short order. Thomas started in his
characteristic manner on Roger Var
gas and soon had the first set 6-1.
Under a barrage of drives and volleys,
Vargas found little opportunity for
his skimming chop strokes. His best
efforts gained him only one more
game. Ralph McElvenny had little
trouble with Ronald Smith and won
6-0, 6-1. Smith consistently tossed up
easy "sitters," which his opponent
promptly killed.
In the first doubles match, Holman
and Herrington easily captured the
initial set 6-1, but dropped the follow
ing one 6-4. The Duff-Houser combina
| tion tried hard to add the last set to
j win the match. They lobbed and
lobbed again to neutralize the net at
tack of their hard-volleying opponents
but lost the set, 6 to 2.
Fairchild and McElvenny played
Stanford and Smith in the final dou
bles match as dusk came. The light
lasted just long enough to witness the
Cardinal players come off the court
with a 6-2, 6-4 victory in a loose, un
impressive contest.
During the spring vacation a return
engagement will be played in Los
Angeles with the Grizzlies, who are
rounding out their northern invasion
with matches against California, Saint
Mary's and Santa Clara during this
week.
