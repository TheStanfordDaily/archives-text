# THREE YEARS WINTER PREDICTED FOR IDAHO
## 
### 
UNIVERSITY OF IDAHO, Jan. 29.â€” I
Three years of continuous winter,
without a ray of the summer's sun, is
a condition that Moscow, Idaho, may
have beginning next year. Such is the |
opinion of many notable men, and com
ing from a statement issued by Pro
fessor Virgil R. D. Kirkham, of the
University of Idaho.
"In the Scandinavian 'Saga' there
are tales of the three winters with no
trace of summer in between them,
when the entire race was nearly
wiped out," says Professor Kirkman.
"There have been records of such re
currences on the continent, and nu
merous legends of plagues. All these
recured in periods of 286 years. The
next period is due to begin during the
1926-27 season when the northern and
southern latitudes of the entire world
may not see summer for three years.
