RESULTS OF YESTERDAY'S GAMES
Independents 17, Phi Kappa Sigma 13.
Encina 4W 5, Delta Upsilon 0.

By Gordon French
Sensational rallies, a shut-out, and
evenly matched play were dished out
to intramural basketball fans in yes
terday's game. El Toro retained the
joint leadership of League VII with
the Independents, and the Betas con
tinued to top League VIII in the play
among the division leaders.
The first game on the program
proved to be far the best one. The
Phi Kaps started off with obvious in
tentions to upset the dope and plainly
had the Independents, favorites, wor
ried during the first half. Frye, Phi
Kap center, led in the attack with two
field goals, while McCullock helped
out with three scores and Hinkle with
two. Soon after the start of the second
half, however, the badly frightened
Independents began to gain on the
fraternity quintet and got their attack
to working smoothly. Martin, Inde
pendent forward, made three baskets
and, with the addition of a foul goal
in the first half, obtained high-point
honors, while Guthrie, center, added
two more field goals for an aggregate
score of six points. Wilson, Independ
ents guard, besides playing a fast floor
game, contributed a classy shot.
Little more can be said of the ragged
Encina 4W-Delta Upsilon fracas other
than the fact that both teams showed
a tendency to wander aimlessly about
the floor. Encina's representative
could score only one basket but that
was enough to win. The only two
points scored in the first half were
foul shots by Doyle, freshman guard.
Frazier sank the only goal and Doyle
dropped in another foul to end the
scoring.
El Toro ran circles around the Alpha
Tau team to completely whitewash it.
The score was 4-0 at half time. Ar
thur and Crever, who played a good
game at running guard, tied for high
point honors with two baskets apiece.
In a rough and tumble battle the
Beta aggregation maintained its un
blemished record by outscoring the
Delta Chi five. Mannoccir, Beta cen
ter, was high scorer with five points,
while Kissinger, forward for the win
ners, and Whitfield, opposing center,
each scored four points. Many fouls
were called but many more could
easily have been called.
Chinese Show Ability
The diminutive Chinese Club for
wards ran under and around the er
ratic guarding of the Encina Basement
team to outscore them by eight points.
The short passing attack of the Chi
nese was very effective and disclosed
a good deal of practice on their part.
Robertson was the only good shot of
the freshman team and after he was
forced to retire due to an injury to
his leg early in the second half, the
hall team could not focus their attack.
He scored four points before going
out. Pan and Hsieh were the leading
scorers for the Chinese with two bas
kets apiece. Chun, lanky Chinese
guard, helped materially in keeping
his opponents' score down besides
scoring two points.
Sequoia Downs Japanese
Endo, flashy Japanese Club center,
stood out head and shoulders above
anyone else's playing in floor work in
his team's game with the Sequoia I

team. However, his shooting was not |
up to its usual standard and he scored j
only three points. His clever dribbling
was the best seen 011 an intramural
team this year. Lentz, Brandt, and
Stimpson caged three shots in rapid
succession to give Sequoia a 6-0 lead.

Little more can be said of the ragged
Encina 4W-Delta Upsilon fracas other
than the fact that both teams showed
a tendency to wander aimlessly about
the floor. Encina's representative
could score only one basket but that
was enough to win. The only two
points scored in the first half were
foul shots by Doyle, freshman guard.
Frazier sank the only goal and Doyle
dropped in another foul to end the
scoring.
El Toro ran circles around the Alpha
Tau team to completely whitewash it.
The score was 4-0 at half time. Ar
thur and Crever, who played a good
game at running guard, tied for high
point honors with two baskets apiece.
In a rough and tumble battle the
Beta aggregation maintained its un
blemished record by outscoring the
Delta Chi five. Mannoccir, Beta cen
ter, was high scorer with five points,
while Kissinger, forward for the win
ners, and Whitfield, opposing center,
each scored four points. Many fouls
were called but many more could
easily have been called.
Chinese Show Ability
The diminutive Chinese Club for
wards ran under and around the er
ratic guarding of the Encina Basement
team to outscore them by eight points.
The short passing attack of the Chi
nese was very effective and disclosed
a good deal of practice on their part.
Robertson was the only good shot of
the freshman team and after he was
forced to retire due to an injury to
his leg early in the second half, the
hall team could not focus their attack.
He scored four points before going
out. Pan and Hsieh were the leading
scorers for the Chinese with two bas
kets apiece. Chun, lanky Chinese
guard, helped materially in keeping
his opponents' score down besides
scoring two points.
Sequoia Downs Japanese
Endo, flashy Japanese Club center,
stood out head and shoulders above
anyone else's playing in floor work in
his team's game with the Sequoia I

team. However, his shooting was not |
up to its usual standard and he scored j
only three points. His clever dribbling
was the best seen 011 an intramural
team this year. Lentz, Brandt, and
Stimpson caged three shots in rapid
succession to give Sequoia a 6-0 lead.

RESULTS OF YESTERDAY'S GAMES

By Gordon French
Sensational rallies, a shut-out, and
evenly matched play were dished out
to intramural basketball fans in yes
terday's game. El Toro retained the
joint leadership of League VII with
the Independents, and the Betas con
tinued to top League VIII in the play
among the division leaders.
The first game on the program
proved to be far the best one. The
Phi Kaps started off with obvious in
tentions to upset the dope and plainly
had the Independents, favorites, wor
ried during the first half. Frye, Phi
Kap center, led in the attack with two
field goals, while McCullock helped
out with three scores and Hinkle with
two. Soon after the start of the second
half, however, the badly frightened
Independents began to gain on the
fraternity quintet and got their attack
to working smoothly. Martin, Inde
pendent forward, made three baskets
and, with the addition of a foul goal
in the first half, obtained high-point
honors, while Guthrie, center, added
two more field goals for an aggregate
score of six points. Wilson, Independ
ents guard, besides playing a fast floor
game, contributed a classy shot.
