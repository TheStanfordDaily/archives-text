evenly matched play were dished out
to intramural basketball fans in yes
terday's game. El Toro retained the
joint leadership of League VII with
the Independents, and the Betas con

among the division leaders.
The first game on the program
proved to be far the best one. The
Phi Kaps started off with obvious in
tentions to upset the dope and plainly
had the Independents, favorites, wor

Kap center, led in the attack with two
field goals, while McCullock helped
out with three scores and Hinkle with
two. Soon after the start of the second
half, however, the badly frightened
Independents began to gain on the
fraternity quintet and got their attack
to working smoothly. Martin, Inde
pendent forward, made three baskets
and, with the addition of a foul goal
in the first half, obtained high-point
honors, while Guthrie, center, added
two more field goals for an aggregate
score of six points. Wilson, Independ
ents guard, besides playing a fast floor
game, contributed a classy shot.

Encina 4W-Delta Upsilon fracas other
