# "UFA" GERMAN MOVIE COMPANY NOTED FOR EFFECT OF REALISM
## 
### 
"Passion," "Deception," "The Cabi
net of Dr. Calagari," and "The Last
Laugh" are among the famous produc
tions of UFA, the German film com
pany which produced "Siegfried," to
be shown tomorrow night in the As
sembly hall at 8 o'clock.
This picture is said to be the most
ambitious which UFA has yet at
tempted, outdoing its previous suc
cesses, which have proved very popu
lar.
"Passion" was the first film of UFA
to be produced in the United States,
and one of the first German films ever
shown here. As Dubarry, Pola Negri
was introduced to American audiences,
with Ernest Lubitsch, now her di
rector in Hollywood, directing the pic
ture.
"Deception," with Ernil Jannings as
Henry VIII, also scored populority in
United States. His most recent ap
pearance was in "The Last Laugh,"
rated as one of the best films of 1925.
It was noteworthy also because it con
tained only one substitute.
"The Cabinet of Dr. Calagari"
showed the marvelous technical abil
ity of the Germans, and their senstive
ness in adapting the settings the emo
tional tone of the picture. In fact, it
is said that emotional impressionism
was carried in this picture to its high
est point on the screen.
The spirit of the epic in "Siegfried"
has been developed with intense real
ism. Instead of leaving a portion of
a bit of action to the imagination, as
is the custom in America, the German
film shows the entire action. Film
critics in United States are divided
as to whether this is an advancement
over the American method of partial
suggestion.
Tickets are available in the Dra
matic Manager's office in the Old Un
ion, and will be on sale at the box
office at the Assembly hall tomorrow
evening.
