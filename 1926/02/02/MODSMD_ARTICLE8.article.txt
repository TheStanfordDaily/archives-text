# Rain Drops and Wind Lash Daily Observer As Lake Slowly Fills
## 
### 
Buffeted and lashed by wind and
rain, an adventurous Daily reporter
managed to fight his way through
the stormy elements and reach La
gunita early this morning. The
modern Balboa, after staggering up
the steep bank, was able to see
dimly through the mists which ob
scured the countryside. There be
fore him lay a sheet of water â€”La-
gunita, the alluring siren which will
soon ensnare the romantic from
their classes.
Yes, we will have lots of water
this year. In fact, we have many,
many gallons of the fluid already
and more coming in every moment.
Before the storm started this morn
ing the water level was high enough
to completely surround the stone
base of the marker. Despite the
fact that no rain fell here last
night enough water came in through
the creek to raise the lake a full
six inches.
