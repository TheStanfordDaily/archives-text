# FROSH WATER POLO TEAM LOOKS GOOD IN DAILY WORKOUTS
## Brandsten Drilling Men for Game With U.C. Babes February 13 
### 
With its game coming on February
13 the Stanford freshman water polo 1
squad has determined to make the j
day an unlucky one for the blue and
gold babes. With this end in view
they have been working out daily and (
Saturday morning with a game after
that of the varsity squad. Ernst
Brandsten, coach of aquatic sports,
predicts a victory for the Cardinal
freshmen after thoroughly sizing up
his men.
Water polo practice at Berkeley has '
just started, while Brandsten li'as been
coaching the first-year men regularly
for the past three weeks.
Last Saturday a game was arranged '
between the frosh and a team made j
up of sophomores. The second-year ■
men were only able to defeat the
babes by a scant goal or two and the j
game was close all the time.
Strong Capable Forward
In Cal Strong, Bob Burns, and Tom
Thurlow, Brandsten has the mainstays
of his team. Strong is a capable for- 1
ward and has a straight-arm shot at
the net that is next to impossible for
any goal guard to stop. Burns handles
the ball well and passes accurately, as
well as being speedy at swimming the j
ball up and down the tank. He and !
Thurlow work well together.
Thurlow has been playing center |
back position but Brandsten plans to
have him exchange places with Burns j
for some of the plays. Thurlow re- j
ceived his training in the aquatic |
game with the Venice Swimming Asso- j
ciation, and is a dangerous man at j
guard. He manages to keep his for
wards supplied with the ball.
Burke Promising Guard
The frosh seem to have a good goal!
guard in Burke, a big boy who is rap-1
idly developing the knack of stopping '
the ball before it hits the net. The
goal guard is the last line of defense ;
in water polo and can often hold a I
stronger team to a low score by his !
ability. The babes should be able to j
hold their opponents scoreless if all ;
goes as it should and the players don't
get rattled.
The rest of the team is of average j
or better quality and all are improv-,
ing daily. Hunter at forward, Parker, •
Thou, and Cole, two of whom will play ;
guard, are all developing rapidly in j
ability to handle the ball and in cool- 1
ness "under fire."
Brandsten plans in a short time to
start working the freshmen against j
easier teams in order that they may j
work out plays and passing combina- j
tions. From all appearances they will j
turn out a water polo seven in a class j
with that of last year's frosh, and one j
which will supply some good material
for future varsities.
