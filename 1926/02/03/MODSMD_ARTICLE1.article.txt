### 
Coach Husky Hunt's babe quintet
will meet the San Mateo Junior Col
lege five in the pavilion at 8 o'clock
fonight in the first of the late season
practice games. Three weeks remain
before the frosh meet the California
freshmen and a schedule of hard
.games has been arranged to get the
team in shape for this coming game
with the Bruin cubs.
Hunt has been trying new combina
tions in practice this week and will
-continue to change the players about
until he is satisfied with their play
ing. Robb was tried at running guard
in practice yesterday and Lewis was
shifted to forward. Davis was used
at forward in scrimmage yesterday
and, though lacking in experience, is
an aggressivve player and shows con
siderable promise.
All honors for hard luck are voted
unanimously to Kopp, the center who
substituted for McCandless in the
game Saturday night. Kopp's show
ing was such that Husky saw fit to
promote him to the first squad in
practice Monday. In practice that
same afternoon Kopp suffered a se
verely sprained ankle and will prob
ably be out for the remainder of the
season. His loss has put a crimp in
Hunt's plans, as he was experiment
ing with a combination of Kopp at
tenter and McCandless at one of the
forward positions. ,
The starting lineup, as announced
by Hunt yesterday, is as follows:
Sibbett and Renzel, forwards; Lewis
and Worden, guards; McCandless,
center.
