# SINGLE KNOCKOUT ENLIVENS NOVICE BOXING TOURNEY
## Finals Lack Color Shown in Elimination Bouts; Big Crowds See Fights 
### 
A single knockout brought the fans
to their feet during the seven bouts
of the annual novice boxing tourna
ment which was held last night in the
pavilion. Felix Farewell, middleweight
boxer, was awarded a technical kayo
when Referee Jack Feelery stopped
the uneven battle between Farewell
and Brunner after th latter had been
knocked down for a count of six.
'the annual novice tournament,
sponsored by Circle "S" Society
proved its popularity with the stu
dents, as over 800 attended the bouts
in spite of the inclement weather.
Many of these who had witnessed
some of the elimination bouts which
were held last week were somewhat
disappointed, as the final matches
lacked both the boxing ability and
aggressiveness shown in many of the
preliminary rounds.
McCall Featherweight Champ
McCall, featherweight, reached the
top pinnacle in this division by defeat
ing Burgess in the first bout of the
evening. Opening the first round by
sending his opponent to the floor with
a hard left to the face, McCall had
Burgess swinging wildly as the bell
showed the lack of condition of both
boxers, and the two standing still and
trading weak punches, McCall's blows
ended the frame. The other two rounds
telling on his rival. The match was
extremely slow for the featherweight
division.
Goldwater, diminutive lightweight,
won the plaudits of the fans by show
ing a decided edge over Raaf, his op
ponent. Goldwater scored heavy rights
and lefts to the latter's face, and by
his clever guarding avoided most of
his game rival's blows.
Offerman Beats Parsons
Parsons and Offerman, substituting
for the bantamweight final bout,
fought four rounds, with the latter
winning the judges' decision after go
ing an extra frame. Parsons started
out at a pace too fast to last, the two
flailing each other with blow after
blow in windmill fashion during the
first two rounds. Parsons plainly
showed the effects of his early efforts,
and Offerman's victory came largely
at* a result of better condition.
Harry Stevenson, rugged welter
weight, won the medal as novice cham
pion in this division by taking a deci
sion over Bob Keerl in a closely fought
contest. Following the first round, dur
ing which the two cautiously adjudged
each other, Stevenson opened the sec
ond frame by drawing blood from
Keerl's eye. His opponent connected
twice with rights to Stevenson's face,
but hard blows in the third round
clearly gave Stevenson the decision.
Dorman-Mustain Good
Dorman won the light-heavyweight
championship from Mustain chiefly by
clever timing of his blows, and by
guarding Mustain's punches. The two
put up one of the best bouts of the
evening, and four rounds was neces
sary before the judges could give the
edge to one of the two finalists.
Heavyweight honors were awarded
to O'Sullivan by a very unpopular de
cision after the fourth round of his
match with Hazeltine. The two were
lacking in aggressiveness, either cau
tiously feinting, or coming into clinch
es which the referee was slow in
breaking. Hazeltine showed the great
est desire to mix, and superior ability
in the eyes of the fans and newspaper
men, but not jof the referee.
The proceeds o fthe tournament will
be used by the Circle "S" society for
a trophy case and for medals for the
winners of the bouts.
