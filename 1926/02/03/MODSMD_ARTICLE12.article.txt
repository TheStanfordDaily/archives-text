# MAY 7 APPROVED AS DATE OF 1927 JUNIOR PROMENADE
## Kenneth Graham Named to Aid Menzies in Planning Decoration Scheme 
### 
May 7 was set as the date for the
Junior Promenade at the weekly meet
ing of the Executive Cqmrnittee last
night. This comes on the Friday night
of Junior Week. Saturday night the
Junior Opera will be given.
Three new committee-members were
chosen yesterday by Victor P. Greis
ser, chairman. Kenneth C. Graham
was appointed sub-chairman of the
decoration committee, with Dorothy
Gates and Sydney Meeks as new mem
bers on the same committee.
Where the Prom will be given has
not been definitely decided yet as the
committee is trying to make it an
artistic affair, and consequently wants
the best available space. Branner hall
has been offered, but will not be used
unless Toyon hall is also available.
The committee announces that due
to the amount of time necessary to
serve a regular dinner this custom
will be discontinued. Refreshments,
however, will be served as they were
last year.
First chance on tickets will go to
the juniors who have paid their class
dues, then seniors may have any that
remain. The intention is to keep the
dance as strictly upperclass as possi
ble and to have only a small crowd.
Only as many tickets will be sold as
are necessary to pay the expenses of
the Prom itself. The price will be ?5,
and as none of the money is to go
into the general treasury of the Junior
Class, but will all go toward bettering
the dance, the committee expects to
have an unusually successful and
brilliant Prom.
