# DEADLINE SET FOR POETRY CONTEST AS FEBRUARY 3
## 
### 
The deadline for the Quad poetry
contest has been set at February 23.
All contributions should be sent to
Poetry Editor, Box 33. Any brain
children wandering around in search
of a home should be sent at once to
the Quad.
Poems may be of any length, size
or color, with no particular restric
tion upon the type of poetry sub
mitted. Local color is appreciated, but
not demanded. Quality rather than
quantity is the main thing.
The prizes still stand as originally
offered: a silver cup, a dinner at
Taits, and a copy of this year's Quad.
In spite of the nature of the prizes,
poetry of a serious, or semi-serious
nature is desired. Humorous poems
will be gratefully received, but will
be turned over for the use of the
Razz section.
The policy of introducing student
poetry in general is a new one in the
history of Quads. Plans are for the
poetry section to be the keynote of
the entire volume. The Poetry Editor
wants to demonstrate that the mind
of the student is not entirely occu
pied with gin and width of trousers
as the conception of college humor
seems to be.
