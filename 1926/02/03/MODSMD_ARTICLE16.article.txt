# SIGMA CHI QUINTET NOSES OUT SEQUOIA IN CLOSE TILT 14-13
## Phi Delta Theta Overwhelms Theta Delta Chi Squad; Branner Forfeits 
### Clif Moore 
Sigma Chi won a close contest from
Sequoia 11, 14 to 13, and Phi Delta
Theta took a one-sided decision from
Theta Delta Chi by a 33 to 2 score in
the only two intramural games played
yesterday. Branner II forfeited to En
cina 2W. The games scheduled for the
afternoon were postponed.
The Sigma Chi-Sequoia tussle was
close from beginning to end, with the
lead see-sawing back and forth. Both
teams played a good style of basket
ball, and the contest was featured by
clever dribbling and effective passing.
Mack Sequoia Star
Mack played a stellar game at for
ward for the Sequoia quintet, and his
playing was one of the highlights of
the game. He counted for three field
goals, and his passing was responsi
ble for the other baskets scored by
Sequoia. Brady played a good game at
center for Sigma Chi. The work of
King and Clark at guards for the fra
ternity team was effective in keeping
down Sequoia's score.
The Phi Delts had little difficulty
running up a big score against Theta
Delta Chi. Snyde, Garibaldi, and Ken
ney formed an offensive combination
that was hard to stop, and the guard
ing of Reynolds and Fletcher kept the
losers from even making a threat to
challenge the lead.
Theta Delts Baffled
The winners played a fast passing
game that completely baffled the
Theta Delt guards. Time and again
Snyde, or one of the Phi Delt forwards,
received the ball under the basket,
after a series of good passes had
worked the ball down the court. Snyde
was the outstanding player on the
winning five, and is credited with a
total of 15 points. Garibaldi took sec
ond scoring honors, with five baskets
for 10 points. Harter made the Theta
Delts' only goal in the last period,
after the first half had ended 19 to 0.
Following are tomorrow's games:
4:15 —Theta Xi vs. Los Arcos.
4:50 —Branner I vs. Chi Psi.
