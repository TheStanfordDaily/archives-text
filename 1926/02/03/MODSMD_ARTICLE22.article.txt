# A 						Concrete Crusade
## 
### 
When the small town editor finds that his community has outgrown
dirt sidewalks he resorts to a stereotyped course of procedure.
First, he searches diligently for feature news bits pertaining to muddy
pitfalls. For emphasis he may fabricate slightly. Second, he seizes upon
the first important man who visits the town, forcing an interview from
this worthy. For instance, Heziah Ogelthorpe, President of the Amalga
mated Sausage Trust, drifts into the scene. The sentiment attributed to
this gentleman will read as follows: "Blankville is one of the most promis
ing towns in the state. Concrete sidewalks will permit even more rapid
strides forward than have been taken by the community since I was last
here."
After such a startling statement the editor gets in his licks. Figures
are forthcoming, showing the saving in clothing that would be effected
could the mud be eliminated. The city council is urged into action, and
when the sidewalks are installed Blankville may become the most prosper
ous community in the state, and then again it may not. At any rate, its
inhabitants are decidedly more comfortable.
The Daily might resort to the same methods as its country contem
poraries, if it cared to fabricate or if distinguished visitors would only show
up with the rain. Hut, however that may be, something could surely be
done to improve the condition of the paths that surround Toyon and
Branner halls. A few more heavy rains and the Administration will be
obligated to require men residents of these living groups to take a swim
ming test before they are allowed to navigate the perilous waters.
