THE ETHER JAG
Now that people are being happily
married and equally as happily di
! vorced by radio the possibilities of the
ether seem almost without limit.
Even iu our college life radio could
be put to many uses that would go a
; long way toward eliminating the dis
; comforts and hardships of a college
! education.
* * *
For campus communication expen
sive long distance sets would be un
necessary.
Just convert your fountain pen or
your hip flask into a pocket-portable
self-filling radio set, hook a loud
speaker onto it and you will be all
set to enjoy one of the greatest boons
of mankind.

No loncjer will it be imperative to
arise at 7:55 to attend an 8 o'clock
class. Just put on your earphones the
night before, tune in to Biology 1, Ele
mentary Greek, Descriptive Geometry,
History 169, Journalism 101, or Phy
i sics 2, sleep through the lecture in
real comfort, and awake with a clear
conscience.
* * *
What a benefactor to mankind
would be th.e replacement of the tele
phone by the radio.
When you want to call your fav
orite sorority, instead of having to
listen to seventeen different operators
tell you in thirty-one different inflec
tions of the voice that the "lion's
buzy," all you have to do is tune into
station A.P., P.8.P., K.K.G., or anv
other specifying the wavelength of
conversation desired, and carry on a
delightful tete-a-tete (if the static
doesn't interfere) over your own pri
vate wireless.
* * *
Think of the adwantage of taking
a final examination by radio.

Those who are worrying about the
loss of moonlight and canoes because
Lagunita is not filling up very fast
should move to Toyon or Branner
Hall.
Since the last rains, those portions
of the landscape that were once gravel
walks have become lakes of magnifi
cient size.
* * *
It is rumored that a 12,000 ton
pleasure yacht will soon be launched
on the New Branner Lakes.

Cabbages holds out for bigger and
better mud puddles.
