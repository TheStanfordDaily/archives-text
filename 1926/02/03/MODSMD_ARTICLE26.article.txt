### Letitia Lemon 
Enisorle II College Brutality.
Pummppy of Episode I.
A voung gentleman mistakes Letitia
fnv n peach at a jolly-up and gets
pWted.
Continuation of the Narrativve.
After my experience at the jolly-up
I was determined never to so much as
notice a man again. But I did, in
spite of my better judgment, and it
was on the very next day at that.)
John Smith was to come into my life
again on that very day.
(Of course my ill feelings toward
him were somewhat alleviated when
one of my friends told me that I was
to blame his dancing so many times
with me, because I did not allow him
to dance with some one else.)
But I must tell you now of one of
the yearly occurrences that helped to
make me despise college. I speak of
that frightful orgy where brutality
reigns unchecked, that blasphemous
baptism of the soul, that foul waste of
human purity, where good men are
dragged down into the scum and mire,
and innocent freshmen are cast head
long into bottomless pits, that ruinous
and oily practice of the lower classes,
the Freshman-Sophomore Mud Fight.
It was here that John Smith and I
were to meet again.
