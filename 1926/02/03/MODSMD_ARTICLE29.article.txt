# SPORTS OF 1926
## 
### "FEG" MURRAY, ’16 
The cross word puzzle fans of Cincinnati were looking
for a four-letter word that meant a good, left-handed first
baseman, so the Reds up and purchased Pipp from the
Yankees. Now the Rhinelanders (no relation) are grinning
from ear to ear, for the death of the popular Jake Daubert
at the close of the 1924 season left a vacancy in the Red
infield that was not in any measure filled by Bressler,
Niehaus, or Holke.
Wally Pipp is thirty-three years old, and has seen
eleven straight years of service on the initial sack for the
Yankees, but there should still be plenty of good baseball
left in him. And good enough baseball to make the Reds a
pennant contender in 1926.
Pipp was noted for many things during his illustrious
career in a New York uniform. He was noted for being a
two-fisted gentleman, who spoke as seldom as Cal Coolidge

or the sphinx, yet who hit straight. In 1920 he was known as a member of
that famous double play combination, Peck to Pratt to Pipp. In 1921, '22, and
'23 hf> was known as a member of "Murderers' Row," and his batting average
of .329 in 1922 is just 100 points higher than his 1925 percentage. Wally was
also twice American League home run king in years gone by, and for a long
time led his teammates in driving in runs.
Pipp was also noted for his Dad, who was a great fan and followed the
fortunes of the Yanks on the road as well as at the Polo Grounds and the
Yankee Stadium. Pipp, Senior, will be missed as well as Wally. And all of
this leaves Columbia Lou Gehrig in sole possession of first base, which isn't
so bad for Lou, or first base, either one.
FEG MURRAY SAYS—
Tennis isn't professionalized yet, but so many players are trying
to dope the outcome of the Wills-Lenglen match that the net-prophets
are becoming a real menace.
