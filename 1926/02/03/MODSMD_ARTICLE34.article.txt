# CARD WATER POLO TEAM HAS TRAINING JUMP ON CALIFORNIA
## 
### Herbert Klein 
California water polo teams will be
gin their season this week with a
workout at the pool of tho Athens
Club of Oakland, according to a notice
in the Daily Californian. According
to this Stanford players will have an
advantage over their blue and gold
opponents when they play them on
February 13 for daily scrimmage has
been going 011 at Encina pool since
the first week of the quarter, and
Coach Ernst Brandsten has already
developed seven with scoring ability.
The Berkeley team will have as
mainstays Captain Paul Keen, Art
Hargrave, Cliff Mayne, Dusty Rhodes
and Sid Glasson. These players
should form one of the strongest
teams California has had for some
time, but it is extremely doubtful if
they will be able to give the Cardinal
players any serious competition.
Three Veterans
Veterans from last year's team are
Arden Allen and Bob Williams in the I
backfield, and Art Stewart in the for-j
ward lineup. Allen, who is this year's'
captain, has seldom been scored |
against. He and Williams will together 1
form one of the steadiest backfield
outfits Stanford or any other college
team has ever had. Both can do a lOO
yard free-style in about 57 seconds
and their speed at dribbling a water |
polo ball is proportional.
Ken Graham, who has been taking;
the third backfield position is not as I
speedy as the other two but is con
sistent at taking the ball away from
opposing forwards, because of his
long reach.
Strong Backfield
The backfield lineup has proved
nearly as effective as the forward so
far this season, in number of goals
shot, and Brandsten intends to drill
the team regularly in a play in which ■.
a guard, either Allen or Williams j
swims the ball down the tank for a;
fast heave at the goal while the for
wards will pull their men out of the :
•way.
Art Stewart has an effective back
hand shot as well as a fast stra.ght
aim but is a little slow in getting
these wound up. Kryne van den'
Akker of last years freshman team
has been playing sprint position j
regularly. He is active at dribbling 1
and keeps constantly on the move at 1
a rate that should wear out guards j
who would follow him. Hfe is rather
light for the game. |-
Brooks Is Fast
Phil Brooks has been working out
for several nights in a forward posi
tion and may play sprint for ho is
faster than Van den Akker.
Students at the Colorado Teachers
College voted to continue the custom
of freshmeu wearing green caps and
bandanas.

should form one of the strongest
teams California has had for some
time, but it is extremely doubtful if
they will be able to give the Cardinal
players any serious competition.
Three Veterans
Veterans from last year's team are
Arden Allen and Bob Williams in the I
backfield, and Art Stewart in the for-j
ward lineup. Allen, who is this year's'
captain, has seldom been scored |
against. He and Williams will together 1
form one of the steadiest backfield
outfits Stanford or any other college
team has ever had. Both can do a lOO
yard free-style in about 57 seconds
and their speed at dribbling a water |
polo ball is proportional.
Ken Graham, who has been taking;
the third backfield position is not as I
speedy as the other two but is con
sistent at taking the ball away from
opposing forwards, because of his
long reach.
Strong Backfield
The backfield lineup has proved
nearly as effective as the forward so
far this season, in number of goals
shot, and Brandsten intends to drill
the team regularly in a play in which ■.
a guard, either Allen or Williams j
swims the ball down the tank for a;
fast heave at the goal while the for
wards will pull their men out of the :
•way.
Art Stewart has an effective back
hand shot as well as a fast stra.ght
aim but is a little slow in getting
these wound up. Kryne van den'
Akker of last years freshman team
has been playing sprint position j
regularly. He is active at dribbling 1
and keeps constantly on the move at 1
a rate that should wear out guards j
who would follow him. Hfe is rather
light for the game. |-
Brooks Is Fast
Phil Brooks has been working out
for several nights in a forward posi
tion and may play sprint for ho is
faster than Van den Akker.

California water polo teams will be
gin their season this week with a
workout at the pool of tho Athens
Club of Oakland, according to a notice
in the Daily Californian. According
to this Stanford players will have an
advantage over their blue and gold
opponents when they play them on
February 13 for daily scrimmage has
been going 011 at Encina pool since
the first week of the quarter, and
Coach Ernst Brandsten has already
developed seven with scoring ability.
The Berkeley team will have as
mainstays Captain Paul Keen, Art
Hargrave, Cliff Mayne, Dusty Rhodes
and Sid Glasson. These players
should form one of the strongest
teams California has had for some
time, but it is extremely doubtful if
they will be able to give the Cardinal
players any serious competition.
