# UNIQUE GERMAN PICTURE WILL BE SHOWN TONIGHT
## 
### G. W 
The presentation of the film "Sieg
fried," released by UFA, the famous
German producers, will take place
under the auspices of the Dramatic
Council at promptly 8 o'clock tonight
in the Assembly hall. The earlier hour
for commencing has been necessitated
by the facts that this is a mid-week
performance, and that the film is of
somewhat unusual length. The produc
tion should be over by 10 o'clock.
Film Is Unique
"Siegfried" has been acclaimed by
American critics as one of the most
unique films ever released in the
United States. The old Gothic saga
relating the exploits of the semi
mythical hero, Siegfried, is one of the
classic epics of literature, ranking
with the Anglo-Saxon "Beouwulf," the
Roman "Aeneid," and| the Greek
"Odyssey." It is significant that the
Germans have filmed the production
with accuracy as regards the legend,
but have, at the same time, maintained
the plot interest throughout at a high
pitch. Very few American film ver
sions of classics have been able to
do this without alteration and devia
tion from the originals, many even
having introduced extraneous charac
ters and plot elements.
Lang Director
The film was produced under the
direction of Fritz Lang, whose work
for UFA has elicited much praise; the
filming of the picture was supervised
by Carl Hoffman, camera-man of
"Passion," which introduced Pola
Negri to American audiences, and the
photography has been favorably com
mented on in several magazines,
among them "The Theatre Arts
Monthly," which devoted several
pages of pictures to "Siegfried" in a
recent issue. The mythical monsters
and grotesque dwarfs in the picture
have been filmed in a very realistic
manner, many breath-taking and start
ling scenes having been the achieve-

ments of Hoffman's artistry.
The title role of Siegfried, the hero,
is being taken by Paul Richter, who
ranks in Germany as does John Barry
more in the United States. In the film
version of the famous legend he is
appearing in the longest and most
taxing role in which he has been seen
on the screen, although he has han
dled somewhat similar parts on the
legitimate stage in Berlin, Vienna, and
elsewhere on the continent. Margaret
Schoen, who plays opposite him as
Kreimhild, is also well known. Others
who take part are Hanna Ralph as
Brumhilde, Theodore Loos as King
Gunther, and Hans Schlettov as Hagen
Tronje.
Score Is Effective
The Dramatic Council has arranged
for the orchestra from the Capitol
Theatre in San Francisco, where
"Siegfried" was shown recently, to
furnish the music for the Stanford
presentation. The score is one of ex
ceptional effectiveness; Hugo Reisen
feld, the well-known New York direc
tor and composer, adapted it from
Wagner's opera, "The Ring Cycle,"
the plot of which parallels that of
"Siegfried" to a great extent. Musical
authorities have agreed that it is one
of Wagner's strongest operas, and tho
adaptation of its arias to be run with
the film has resulteJ in a score which
follows the moods and emotions of the
picture with more accuracy than is
usual.
Owing to the fact that the picture
was released in California at such
times as to make it difficult to have
been witnessed by Stanford students,
the Dramatic Council has sponsored
this campus showing. A bioc.k of
tickets whMÂ« was reserved from the
