# Piano Ordered for Encina Commons Dining Hall No. 7
## 
### 
A piano to be placed in dining hall
No. 7 of Encina Commons is expected
within a few days. Charles W. Dicken
son, senior sponsor, has ordered
the instrument from San Francisco.
Freshman pianists will lead in singing
during dinner hour, in an attempt to
make the meals more enjoyable. If
the undertaking in the one hall
proves successful, Encina club will
probably rent two more pianos for
use in the other halls, according to
Dickenson.
