# GREVILLE SHOWS PERSONAL CHARM IN SONG RECITAL
## English Soprano Presents Unusual Program With Modern Compositions 
### Music Critic 
A fascinating personality with real
ability in acting and mimicry was re
sponsible for the success of Ursula
Greville's concert in the Assembly
hall last night to as great an extent
as her clear and powerful but not ex
ceptional soprano voice. Miss Grev
ille's gestures and facial expressions
added greatly to the effectiveness of
her songs. The little informal, explana
tory talks with which she preceded
each song delighted the audience and
put them in a sympathetic mood for
what was to follow.
Her songs, with the exception of the
first group of folk-songs, were com
positions of contemporary English
composers, although many of their
lyrics were by American poets. A
strong vein of modernism ran through
the program, again with the exception
of the first group, so that there was
little of actual melody in the popular
sense. To compensate for this there
was much of that which was new and
different in these songs which Miss
Greville never failed to see and bring
out to best effect.
Acting Spontaneous
Miss Greville must be admirable in
operatic roles for her acting out of
songs seemed natural and spontaneous
and did not have any of the artifi
ciality which many other singers on
the concert stage appear to put into
their gestures and expressions. Exam
ples were her rendition of the folk
song, "I'm Owre Young," in which
she gave a very distinctive mimicry
of a maiden sewing, Walter de la
Mare's "Mad Prince" in which she
acted the role of the demented prince,
and her last and most thrilling offer
ing, "The Cupboard," with her imita
tion of the dialogue between the
mother and daughter.
The opening number, "Shenandoah,"
a sea chanty, was sung rather off key,
but Miss Greville soon hit her stride,
and in songs such as "Moon," by
Gerard Williams, was lyrical and com
pelling. "In Cuckoo," an encore, she
gave a clever imitation of the bird.
"There Is No More to Say" was nota-
J ble for bold and startling harmonic
effects.
Gives Personal Comment
The songs were grouped in four divi
sions, Folk-Songs, Songs of Despair,
j Tree Songs, and Songs of Trust and
Treachery. Miss Greville's experience
as a critic and editor of the English
musical periodical, "The Sackbut,"
enabled her to give a personal com
ment on nearly every composer and
poet represented in the program. She
has a great fund of musical knowledge
and a wide acquaintance with the
people who are writing the songs and
symphonies of today.
Her volume was great whenever she
chose to use it, and her singing was
vigorous and unrestrained in the many
songs which called for forceful tech
nique.
In one of her talks Miss Greville
stated that she found American audi
ences open-minded and receptive in
their attitude toward the new songs
which she is constantly bringing be
fore the public.
The recital was given under the
auspices of the Committee on Public
Exercises.

The songs were grouped in four divi
sions, Folk-Songs, Songs of Despair,
j Tree Songs, and Songs of Trust and
Treachery. Miss Greville's experience
as a critic and editor of the English
musical periodical, "The Sackbut,"
enabled her to give a personal com
ment on nearly every composer and
poet represented in the program. She
has a great fund of musical knowledge
and a wide acquaintance with the
people who are writing the songs and
symphonies of today.
Her volume was great whenever she
chose to use it, and her singing was
vigorous and unrestrained in the many
songs which called for forceful tech
nique.
In one of her talks Miss Greville
stated that she found American audi
ences open-minded and receptive in
their attitude toward the new songs
which she is constantly bringing be
fore the public.
The recital was given under the
auspices of the Committee on Public
Exercises.
A fascinating personality with real
ability in acting and mimicry was re
sponsible for the success of Ursula
Greville's concert in the Assembly
hall last night to as great an extent
as her clear and powerful but not ex
ceptional soprano voice. Miss Grev
ille's gestures and facial expressions
added greatly to the effectiveness of
her songs. The little informal, explana
tory talks with which she preceded
each song delighted the audience and
put them in a sympathetic mood for
what was to follow.
Her songs, with the exception of the
first group of folk-songs, were com
positions of contemporary English
composers, although many of their
lyrics were by American poets. A
strong vein of modernism ran through
the program, again with the exception
of the first group, so that there was
little of actual melody in the popular
sense. To compensate for this there
was much of that which was new and
different in these songs which Miss
Greville never failed to see and bring
out to best effect.
Acting Spontaneous
Miss Greville must be admirable in
operatic roles for her acting out of
songs seemed natural and spontaneous
and did not have any of the artifi
ciality which many other singers on
the concert stage appear to put into
their gestures and expressions. Exam
ples were her rendition of the folk
song, "I'm Owre Young," in which
she gave a very distinctive mimicry
of a maiden sewing, Walter de la
Mare's "Mad Prince" in which she
acted the role of the demented prince,
and her last and most thrilling offer
ing, "The Cupboard," with her imita
tion of the dialogue between the
mother and daughter.
The opening number, "Shenandoah,"
a sea chanty, was sung rather off key,
but Miss Greville soon hit her stride,
and in songs such as "Moon," by
Gerard Williams, was lyrical and com
pelling. "In Cuckoo," an encore, she
gave a clever imitation of the bird.
"There Is No More to Say" was nota-
J ble for bold and startling harmonic
effects.
