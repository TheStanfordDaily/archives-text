### G. W 
"Ray, Ray, Rover Boys" has been
announced by Ram's Head Society as
the title for their forthcoming show,
to be presented in the Assembly hall
on February 12.
The show, written by Dave Lamson
and Mike Ely, marks the return of
the Ram's Head show to the old tra
ditional type of burlesque, which
scored successes for "Koo-Koo Kubis
town," "Biff, Bang, Bolshevik," and
other annual shows of the society.
"Ray, Ray, Rover Boys," which is
based upon the antics of the Rover
boys, who have been so aptly satirized
by the able pen of Corey Ford in
"Judge," is a book of unusual clever
ness and brilliance. The burlesque,
which ranges from great delicacy to
that of the broadest style, has afforded
much amusement to the cast which
has been reheaising for the pa 3: t*?n
days. Much satire is a'so included in
the theme of the show, which makes
distinct digs at various phases of col
lege life.
Ely and Lamson, the authors, are
both well known as humorists on the
campus. Both are former editors of
"Chaparral," Ely having edited Vol
umes twenty-four and twenty five,
serving two terms, and Lamson hav
ing been in charge of the comic last
year. While editor of "Chaparrai" Ely
was awarded the cup offered by
"Judge" magazine in its annual Col
lege Humor Contest for the best indi
vidual contribution submitted by an
undergraduate. He has also been a
collaborator in two previous Ram'i
Head shows, "The Merchant of Men
ace," with Carl Shoup and Henry
Mack in 1923, and with Dan Evans in
last year's production, "The Devn's
Daughter."
Lamson took a prominent part in
campus dramatics prior to his gradua
tion last fall. His two most recent
appearances were in Shaw's "Andro
cles and the Lion" and in "Polly witn
a Past," last year's senior farce. He
was also the author of "Fantasia
Fromage," a collegiate satire, and
"What Price Phi Bete?" a burlesque
on the famous "What Glory?" in
the Football Gaieties last November.
Blocks of seats at the Hennepin-
Orpheum theatre were refused to
groups of fraternity pledges at the
University of Minnesota. One group,
in order to secure such seats, had to
sign a bond pledging themselves to
silence and responsibility for all dam
age done.

appearances were in Shaw's "Andro
cles and the Lion" and in "Polly witn
a Past," last year's senior farce. He
was also the author of "Fantasia
Fromage," a collegiate satire, and
"What Price Phi Bete?" a burlesque
on the famous "What Glory?" in
the Football Gaieties last November.

"Ray, Ray, Rover Boys" has been
announced by Ram's Head Society as
the title for their forthcoming show,
to be presented in the Assembly hall
on February 12.
The show, written by Dave Lamson
and Mike Ely, marks the return of
the Ram's Head show to the old tra
ditional type of burlesque, which
scored successes for "Koo-Koo Kubis
town," "Biff, Bang, Bolshevik," and
other annual shows of the society.
"Ray, Ray, Rover Boys," which is
based upon the antics of the Rover
boys, who have been so aptly satirized
by the able pen of Corey Ford in
"Judge," is a book of unusual clever
ness and brilliance. The burlesque,
which ranges from great delicacy to
that of the broadest style, has afforded
much amusement to the cast which
has been reheaising for the pa 3: t*?n
days. Much satire is a'so included in
the theme of the show, which makes
distinct digs at various phases of col
lege life.
Ely and Lamson, the authors, are
both well known as humorists on the
campus. Both are former editors of
"Chaparral," Ely having edited Vol
umes twenty-four and twenty five,
serving two terms, and Lamson hav
ing been in charge of the comic last
year. While editor of "Chaparrai" Ely
was awarded the cup offered by
"Judge" magazine in its annual Col
lege Humor Contest for the best indi
vidual contribution submitted by an
undergraduate. He has also been a
collaborator in two previous Ram'i
Head shows, "The Merchant of Men
ace," with Carl Shoup and Henry
Mack in 1923, and with Dan Evans in
last year's production, "The Devn's
Daughter."
Lamson took a prominent part in
campus dramatics prior to his gradua
tion last fall. His two most recent
appearances were in Shaw's "Andro
cles and the Lion" and in "Polly witn
a Past," last year's senior farce. He
was also the author of "Fantasia
Fromage," a collegiate satire, and
"What Price Phi Bete?" a burlesque
on the famous "What Glory?" in
the Football Gaieties last November.
