ROBLE FORMAL— FEB. 5
a I wish I were
in his Shoes!
You'll hear many a Fellow say this about you
when he sees you wearing a pair of our New I
Tuxedo Dance Pumps. Their Correct Style—
Balloon Shaped "Zep" last; their wonderfully
attractive leather—Black Shell Cordovan; the
Skilled Craftsmanship and their very Flexible
(tanned especially for such shoes) place
these oxfords a long stride ahead of other danc
ing pumps. Made by Heywood of Worcester and
priced at $12
Try them on, Flex their soles and you can't be
without them.
