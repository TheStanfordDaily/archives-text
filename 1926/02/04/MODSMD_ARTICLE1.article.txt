# WOMEN SUBMIT COMPLETE REPORT ON POINT SYSTEM
## Council Opens New Plan to General Criticism for One Week 
### Sylva Weaver 
The report of the Point System com
mittee appointed last quarter to draft
some means of regulating women's
activities was accepted by the Wo
men's Council Tuesday night, and re
leased for publication this morning by
Barbara Perkins, chairman.

The plans for the system will be
open for criticisms and suggestions by
the women for one week, until Febru
ary 10. Suggestions are to be mailed
to Barbara Perkins, chairman of the
committee, or put in the A.W.S. sug
gestion box in Miss Yost's office. The
committee will re-draft the system ac
cording to the criticisms received.

A special Quad election will be held
to determine whether the point sys
tem will be installed at Stanford. The
installation of a point system will vi
tally affect women's activities. The
committee urges all women to study it.

The proposed point system is the
result of careful study and investiga
tion on the part of the committee. The
heads of the various organizations on
the campus were interviewed to col
lect facts as to the duties of the of
fices and the amount of time necessary
to perform them.

It was a hard task, according to
Barbara Perkins, to map out a plan
that would be reasonably lenient and
yet sufficiently restrictive to be called
-a point system.

The point system is not a means of
giving honorable recognition to stu
dents for activities, and it is not a
means of rewarding merit. It is a sys
tem devised to prevent a small group
of women from being overburdened
with activities, by distributing the of
fices and committee work more evenly
among the women. By restricting the
number of college activities in which
one person may take part, the point
system aims at three things:

1. To spread among the many stu
dents those privileges, pleasures, and
honors which have previously been
monopolized by a few.

2. To benefit the organizations or
activities by assuring each position or
office an officer whose Interests are
rather than so scattered
