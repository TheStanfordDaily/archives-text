# Ram's Head Show To Have Daves In President's Role
## 
### 
Delmer Daves has been added to the
Ram's Head Show cast. He is to play
the part of Professor Pembroke, presi
dent of the university. President Pem
brooke, a typical burlesque type, is
the father of Dora, the sweet, young
heroine. Daves has played a variety
of parts in campus productions, rang
ing from Macbeth in last year's Eng
lish Club play, to vaudeville numbers,
such as the skit in the Glee Club
Novelties.
With Daves taking this part, an
other star has been added to the al
ready all-star cast. Charles Parks,
Alan and Leonard Schwartz
have all figured in campus dramatics
for the past few years. Pat Kelley
took the woman's lead in "The Devil's
Daughter," last year's Ram's Head
show. Lee Flood and Sid Lewis also
have taken parts in past Ram's Head
shows. Mac Lewis entered dramatics
with this year's sophomore play, "In
the Next Room." George Eardley is
known on the campus for his clog
dancing. A1 Cass is making his first
appearance but he promises to rival
the better-known comedians in his
part as one of the Rover Boys.

The name, "Ray, Ray, Rover Boys,"
which has been chosen, is extremely
appropriate, as it gives the keynote to
the play. It is college as public opinion
would have it, but, even so, it ridi
cules some existing college customs.
The authors of the play, Mike Ely and
Dave Lamson, are past-masters at sa
tire and have reached the height of
their success in this burlesque. Since
both authors have attended Stanford
for over four years, they are particu
larly well qualified to write on college
life.
