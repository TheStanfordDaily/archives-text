# "NIBS" PRICE WILL SUCCEED SMITH AS CALIFORNIA COACH
## 
### 
Clarence "Nibs" Price was last night
approved by the Executive Committee
of the Associated Students of the Uni
versity of California as Andy Smith's
successor at California as head foot
ball coach. Dr. Albert Boles, who has
been line coach under Smith, will con
tinue in that capacity under Price.

Under the terms of the contract to
be offered Price he will coach the
Bears for a period of three years at a
salary of $9000 per year. This agree
ment will date from February 1.
Price's signature has not been affixed
to this document, but it is understood
that he is in accord with the provi
sions, as they are the same as out
lined by the athletic council earlier
in the week, with which he agreed.

Coach Price entered the football
coaching field at San Diego high
school where he turned out successful
teams every year. He brought out a
number of the West's greatest stars
while there. Brick Muller, Pesky
Sprott, and Cort Majors were all
trained under Price in high school.

Price's work wa3 so successful that
he at once attracted the attention of
California, and in 1917 he was asked
to coach the Bruin Cubs. He turned
out nothing but winning teams while
coaching the babes. Then Smith made
him assistant, and he devoted his time
particularly to offensive and baekfield
play.
Price knows more about the Smith
system than any other man in the
country, and is therefore well quali
fied to carry on his work. He has pro
fessed an admiration for his late
superior's methods and intends to con
tinue along the same lines. He has
done a great deal of scouting for Cali
fornia and is hence acquainted with
the conditions of the other teams in
the conference.
California ranks herself as one of
the first to put in an alumnus as foot
ball coach when she signs Nibs Price.
A few universities in the East have
the graduate coaching system, but
California is one of the few in the
West to have a grid coach from the
ranks of its former players.
