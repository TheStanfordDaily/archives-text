# FRESHMEN DEFEAT SAN MATEO HIGH IN SLOW GAME, 24-17
## Hunt Shifts Starting Lineup to Use Second Squad Men in Contest 
### Cliff McDowell 
Playing slow and uninteresting bas
ketball, the Cardinal freshjnan team
defeated the San Mateo High School
team in the pavilion last night by a
score of 24 to 17. The outcome of the
game was never in doubt, as the frosh
took the lead early in the game and
held it to the finish.

Coach Hunt used three men last
night who had been on the second
squad before this game. These same
three men, Renzel, Robb, and Davis,
proved to be the stars of the game,
and will give the old first-string men
something to worry about. Renzel,
starting at forward, played a wonder
ful game, and came out with high
point honors, the first man to beat
McCandless out of this honor this sea
son.
Robb played standing guard and
played the best game at this position
that has been seen so far. Lewis, who
started the game, will have to play
better than he did last night to keep
Robb off the team. Davis scored five
points during the game and displayed
a good brand of basketball at center.
He knows a lot about the game and is
a tricky player.
McCandleßs failed to show anything
sensational last night and was retired
from the game early in the second
half on four personal fouls. Sibbett
and Osmonson each collected two
points but were weak on passing.
Weir, playing forward, was the out
standing star for the visitors, making
seven points and tying Renzel for
scoring honors. One of Weir's field
goals was made from a shot starting
near the center of the court and drop
ping cleanly through the basket.
The lineups:
Stanford freshmen: Sibbett and
Renzel, forwards; Lewis and Worden,
guards; McCandless, center. Substi
tutes: Osmonson, Davis, Robb, Crary,
and Sexson.

San Mateo High: Weir and Province,
forwards; Hinzie and Raymonds,
guards; A. Chanteloup, center. Sub
