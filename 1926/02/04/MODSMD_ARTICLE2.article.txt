Passing the ball well, working the
floor in a finished manner, and mak
ing most of their shots at the basket
count, the San Jose high school 130-
pound basketball team won from the

of the second quarter. Stanford made
only one more basket in this half
while San Jose was making six points
on two field goals and two free throws,

trailing 12 to 8 as the half ended.

for (he Redshirts in the second half,
while San Jose only made five markers
during this period. The teams were
playing a more even game.

last night than they did against Cali
fornia last week. Their passing and
teamwork has improved to quite an
extent, but they still need a great
deal of practice on shooting. Whitney
was high man for the Cardinals, net
ting seven points. He also played a
fast floor game. Thomas also played
a good game.
