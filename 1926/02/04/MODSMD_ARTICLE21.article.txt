# "Fashions in College Morals"
## 
### 
A defense of the much maligned and constantly criticised college gen
eration has been attempted by Charles A. Seklon in his recently published
series of articles "Fashions in College Morals." His investigation was
made at eight representative colleges—Stanford, California, Washington,
Oregon, Wisconsin, Chicago, Harvard, and Princeton.
Seklon characterizes present day literature depicting university life as
creating an impression that college is a place "where a young man majors
in alcoholism, elects sex indulgence, and rounds out his course by learning
to cheat at examinations." But, in making rottenness appear to be the rule
instead of the exception they give no true picture of American colleges
today, is the view advanced by Seldon.
Seldon's visits on the various campuses prove that books like The Barb
and The Plastic Age convey a decidedly exaggerated and perverted point
of view and give an entirely wrong impression. At Harvard he found
that half the student body was "bone dry" and that cheating at examina
tions was an offense punishable by expulsion. There has only been one
case of dishonesty there in three years, he found. The two parties he at
tended, typical of all student dances, were in sharp contrast to the sex and
rum orgies described in the contemporary college novel. Drinking and
profanity were not "college styles," his investigation showed.
Such a series of articles as this one prepared by an unbiased observer is
is the best possible recommendation for the honestly and morality of the
college generation. It can do more to satisfy those who decry the heed
less, sophisticated younger generation than columns in the editorial sec
tions of college papers—almost its only defenders.
