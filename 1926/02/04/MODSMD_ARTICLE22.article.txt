# A 						Business Clean-Up at Washington
## 
### 
For years the useless extravagance, waste, and red tap connected with
the conduct of the Federal government has been deplored by business men
and legislators, but little has been done to correct the faults. Now Con
gressman Martin L. Davey of Ohio comes forward with a bill which pur
ports to give President Coolidge blanket power for two years to reor
ganize the business structure of the government and to eliminate thou
sands upon thousands of unnecessary employees and the endless duplica
tion of alleged effort which exists at present. In the words of Davey, who
has observed the departments and bureaus of the government at Wash
ington at close range for seven years, "There is an inexcusable waste of
much more than a half billion dollars a year."
Davey's measure provides an extreme cure—he would brush away all
the useless office holders at a single sweep. Because his idea calls for such
a drastic reform it is certain to be vigorously opposed in congress. We
who have no desire for an office job in Washington are all for the measure
—it will save us a lot of money in one way or another. The present ma
chinery of government is greatly over-organized, and a great deal of good
can come to the nation if this bill is passed.
