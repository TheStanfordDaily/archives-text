# Another Success
## 
### 
Another success was scored last night by the Dramatic Council when it
brought to the campus the Continental film version of the German epic
"Siegfried." If the film had not been imported fans in this vicinity would
have found difficulty in seeing it, since the producers stipulated that it must
be shown only in houses that are ordinarily used for legitimate stage pro
ductions.
That the Council's effort was appreciated was shown by the full house,
and by the praise of the audience. It is hoped that the Council can bring
other such productions here during the year.

Chronicle:
"I hesitate to tell you my preferences. I really have none. However, he must be
good looking, and not afraid to spend a little money on me. May I add that lam not
very tall, dark ami considered quite the Sheba. Signed, "L."
.
Generosity shown in add from the University Daily Kansan:
"FOR RENT —Room with sleeping porch, steam heat; two boys."
Insiduous influence of Greece found working under cover by the
Dakota Student:
"The Flickertail Follies will not be a fraternity and sorority affair if we can, in
any way, bring means to prevent it," said Ralph Curry, Follies manager, yesterday.
Casting out of the devil from the mid-quarters of the University of
North Dakota, as in the editorials of the Dakota Daily Student:
"Perhaps during examinations you may sec some one else who is so desperate!
that he would lose his honesty rather than his credit in the course. Should such a
situation arise, do your duty. Show the University authorities that the students of
the University of North Dakota arc men and women and not children and crooks."
