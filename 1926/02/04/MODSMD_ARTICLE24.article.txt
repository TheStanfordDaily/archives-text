# SPORTS OF 1926
## What'll He Do 
### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Here is Willie Ritola, Nurmi's right-hand man, who
if it weren't for Nurmi, would probably hold as many
records as the Abo Antelope does himself. Or perhaps,
on second thought, Ritola wouldn't be nearly as famous
as he is now if it weren't for the inspiration of Nurmi's
remarkable running, which urged Willie on greatly to
exceed his best previous efforts.
At any rate, Ritola has an enviable list of records,
both indoor and outdoor, and he should continue to smash
records for several years to come. In the current indoor
season, it is quite possible that the "Flying Finn the Sec
ond" will do better than ever, because he will not be suffer
ing from that "inferiority complex" which certainly throt
tled his running in the races last winter in which he was
opposed to Nurmi.

How well I remember the famous "veal pot-pie race"
in which Nilrmi collapsed near the finish after setting a couple of "world
records at intervening distances. Ritola was trailing far behind, his head
thrown back, arms swinging wildly, face distorted with agony, and eyes
seeming nearly to pop out of his head. His running was a great contrast to
that of Nurmi, who moved with all the rhythm of the golf swing of Bobby
Jones and the lack of effort of AValter Johnson's pitching motion.
When Nurmi's sudden collapse came, Ritola took a new lease on life —he
put on extra speed, ran with much better form, and passed by his stricken
countryman with a broad grin on his face. One couldn't help wondering at
the speed with which the inferiority complex disappeared and also how much
finer it would have been for Ritola to have stopped running too, and gone to
Paavo's assistance. That "grudge stuff" between the two was all applesauce,
anyway; they often met at Jake Weber's in the evening to gossip over a
friendly bottle of half-of-one-per-cent.
But anyway, it will be interesting to see if Ritola runs better with Nurmi
absent than he did with Paavo present.
