Both Kappa Sigma and the Junipero
Serra Club won their fourth straight
victories to remain even in their race
for the championship of League 111,
so the title will be at stake in their
meeting next week. Theta Chi lived
up to predictions when it completely
swamped the Kappa Alpha squad.

In by far the fastest game of the
evening the Junipero Serra team ral
lied in the last half to overcome El
Capitan's lead and Avin a six-point vic
tory. It was a battle from start to
finish with the Junipero Serra five
having a decided advantage in floor
work due mostly to a well developed
short passing attack. In the first half
their shooting was far below normal
and nullified their superior floor work.
Baskets by Reed and Foster and a
pair of foul shots by Reed gave El
Capitan a two-point lead at half time,
as the best the opponents could get
was four points, three by Harold and
one by Miron.
Serra Spurts Ahead
With the opening of the second half,
the Junipero Serra Club got going and
scored nine points before El Capitan
could recover from the shock. Two
baskets by Brown and one each by
Espy and Harold were chiefly re
sponsible for the deluge of points.
Conklin sank a difficult side-line shot
to break his opponents' winning
streak, but Harold shortly after re
taliated with another basket. Reed,
El Capitan forward, ended the scoring
for his team by caging a short shot.
With a lead of 15 to 10 the Catholic
quintet coasted through the last few
minutes of play for a 16 to 10 victory.
A foul shot by Morrell late in the
second half kept the Kappa Alpha five
from being shut out completely by the
fast Theta Chi team. Theta Chi ran
wild in the first half to score fifteen
tallies while holding their opponents
scoreless. Dice led his team's scorers
with three baskets and Richman fol
lowed him with two. In the second
half Sawyer scored three more points,
while Helmke added the other two
points.
Encina 1E Wins
The Encina IE quintet gained pos
session of fourth place in League IV
and a .500 percentage by handing the
Alpha Kappa Lambda team a 15 to 8
defeat. The first half was quite slow
and the freshmen could garner only
five points, but this was more than
enough, as a foul shot by Barnett was
all the fraternity team could gather.
Both teams played a much better
game in the second half, but the En
cina five continued to have the edge.
Hawley and Richards were the big
guns for the winners in this half, mak
ing six and four points respectively.
Barnett was the only A.K.L. to dis
play much offensive ability; he
brought his total points up to six.
Encina 2E shut out the Phi Gamma
Delta quintet in the second half after
the Fijis had obtained a 3 to 2 lead
at the end of the first half. The final
score was 11 to 3. Savage of Encina
was high man with four points.
The schedule for tomorrow is as
| follows:
4:15 —Sigma Nu vs. Delta Tau Delta.
4:50' —Encina 3E vs. Phi Sigma
| Kappa.
