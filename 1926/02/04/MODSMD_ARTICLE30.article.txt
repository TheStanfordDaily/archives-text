# INTELLIGENCE TEST SCORES CORRELATE WITH GRADE POINTS
## 
### Margaret Mudgett 
That there in definite correlation
between intelligence scores ami schol
arship is shown by statistics compiled
in the second number of the Faculty
Bulletin issued by the Registrar's of
fice. Intelligence score averages are
higher for recent classes, while schol
arship is also higher in recent years.

The Bulletin contains a letter from
one of the faculty asking if the Intel
ligence Test is not too greatly relied
on in the selection of entering stu
dents. Karl M. Cowdery, head of the
Personnel Research department, re
plied that the test is only taken as
one of many factors in deciding upon
candidates for admission.

Cowdery, backing his argument by
statistics concerning entering groups
of the past few years, urged that too
much emphasis could not be laid on
the test. The first thing considered in
regard to admission is the adequacy
of the high school preparation of the
candidate. After this requirement is
fulfilled, the next consideration is the
probable success of the candidate in
University activities. In regard to the
latter, it has been found that there is
clearly a tendency for low testing in
dividuals to be less successful in their
academic work than are those with
higher scores.

In the fall of 1924 the average test
score of the 1368 applicants for ad
mission was 74.9. Of the 803 accepted,
six freshman men and one freshman
woman had scores of below 50. Of
eighteen freshman men admitted with
scores of below 55 only five succeeded
in making a "C" average for their first
year. Only one of three women with
scores below 60 met this standard. The
story of the applicants for 1925-26 is
similar, although the average of test
scores is at the higher level of 77.4.

At present the scores of the under
graduate student body range from 19
to 122, with an average score of 76.7.
Many of the very low scores are of
foreign students, whose language dif
ficulty renders their scores invalid.
The graduate students have an aver
age of 81, but 135 has been attained.
The test covers a wide range of sub
ject matter and is a test that is free
from influence of any particular high
school teachers.

The freshmen have the highest aver
age of any class. It has been found
that those of the class of 1928 who
survived and gained sophomore stand
ing at the completion of their first
year have a much higher score aver
age than those who survived, but who
did not make sophomore standing. The
average of the former was 79.9 and
of the latter 74.5. Those with "B" or
better records averaged 87.9 on the
intelligence test scale. The class of
1928 showed a markedy higher aver
age scholastically than classes enter
ing before the requirement of the
Thorndike examination.

In the Bulletin Cowdery announces
the addition of Robert G. Bernreuter
as half-time assistant in research work
in the department.

six freshman men and one freshman
woman had scores of below 50. Of
eighteen freshman men admitted with
scores of below 55 only five succeeded
in making a "C" average for their first
year. Only one of three women with
scores below 60 met this standard. The
story of the applicants for 1925-26 is
similar, although the average of test
scores is at the higher level of 77.4.

At present the scores of the under
graduate student body range from 19
to 122, with an average score of 76.7.
Many of the very low scores are of
foreign students, whose language dif
ficulty renders their scores invalid.
The graduate students have an aver
age of 81, but 135 has been attained.
The test covers a wide range of sub
ject matter and is a test that is free
from influence of any particular high
school teachers.

The freshmen have the highest aver
age of any class. It has been found
that those of the class of 1928 who
survived and gained sophomore stand
ing at the completion of their first
year have a much higher score aver
age than those who survived, but who
did not make sophomore standing. The
average of the former was 79.9 and
of the latter 74.5. Those with "B" or
better records averaged 87.9 on the
intelligence test scale. The class of
1928 showed a markedy higher aver
age scholastically than classes enter
ing before the requirement of the
Thorndike examination.

In the Bulletin Cowdery announces
the addition of Robert G. Bernreuter
as half-time assistant in research work
in the department.
That there in definite correlation
between intelligence scores ami schol
arship is shown by statistics compiled
in the second number of the Faculty
Bulletin issued by the Registrar's of
fice. Intelligence score averages are
higher for recent classes, while schol
arship is also higher in recent years.

The Bulletin contains a letter from
one of the faculty asking if the Intel
ligence Test is not too greatly relied
on in the selection of entering stu
dents. Karl M. Cowdery, head of the
Personnel Research department, re
plied that the test is only taken as
one of many factors in deciding upon
candidates for admission.

Cowdery, backing his argument by
statistics concerning entering groups
of the past few years, urged that too
much emphasis could not be laid on
the test. The first thing considered in
regard to admission is the adequacy
of the high school preparation of the
candidate. After this requirement is
fulfilled, the next consideration is the
probable success of the candidate in
University activities. In regard to the
latter, it has been found that there is
clearly a tendency for low testing in
dividuals to be less successful in their
academic work than are those with
higher scores.

In the fall of 1924 the average test
score of the 1368 applicants for ad
mission was 74.9. Of the 803 accepted,
six freshman men and one freshman
woman had scores of below 50. Of
eighteen freshman men admitted with
scores of below 55 only five succeeded
in making a "C" average for their first
year. Only one of three women with
