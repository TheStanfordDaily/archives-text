# CAMPUS OPINION
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
This is a plea for a chance at an
education. It is not directed in any
way against the faculty of Stanford
University. It is merely intended to
present the ideas of a considerable
number of the present freshman class.
We feel that the present campaign
on the part of members of the faculty
to eliminate "apple polishing" is not
only failing of its purpose, but giving
rise to a situation more dangerous
than the one they seek to eliminate:
We feel that a system of education
wherein the student sees his profes
sor for qply forty-odd minutes on an
average of three times a week is i
wrong. Students should feel free to j
call uppn their professors and the pro
fessors upon their students. This situ
ation is prevalent among many large
universities both in the United States
and abroad. We feel that informal con
versation between the student and
professor is of much more value to
the student's mental development than
many of his classroom lectures.
Strange as it may seem, we even have

professors whom we would feel hon
ored and happy to claim as friends.
We feel that a spirit of comradeship
between the teacher and student is
not foreign to a great university, but
an essential part of it.
The present crusade against the
"apple polisher" has made it almost

impossible for the average fr.eshman
to meet his professors in that spirit
of straightforward frankness which
might lead to a worthwhile friendship.
If we admire and like a professor, and
are interested in his field of knowl
edge, we feel that we must inhibit
ou,r true feelings and enthusiasms

i lest our advances be considered
"apple polishing."
This is a problem which can bo
solved by the professors and not the
students, and we have every confi
dence that Stanford professors will
listen sympathetically to our point of
view.â€”P. M. S.
