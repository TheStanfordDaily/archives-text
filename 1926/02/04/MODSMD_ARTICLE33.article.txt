## "SIEGFRIED"—ASSEMBLY HALL 
### 
In spite of distressing halts in the
film, in the most tense momenta of
the picture, "Siegfried" could not help
but be effective, if only the technical
skill of its makers were taken into
consideration. Every detail, from the
dragon to the retinue of the kings, was
-worked out most carefully. The Ger
mans certainly demonstrated in this
picture, as in "The Last Laugh," that
they know what can be done with the
movies, and do it.

As a spectacle, "Siegfried" was
much more awe-inspiring than as a
drama, partly because the story had
several weak spots, and partly because
some of the actors were not of suffi
ciently heroic types to carry their
roles. Paul Richter as Siegfried and
Hanna Ralph as Brunhilde had the
■moat difficult parts. Richter looked
.{enough like John Barrymore to justify
iiis having that title in Europe, while
. Miss Ralph, as the cold-hearted Ice
land prfncess, completely overshad
owed Margaret Schoen. Miss Schoen
vas very disappointing, not only be
cause she was not beautiful, but be
cause of her weak characterization.

Hagen Tronje, the one-eyed villain,
liad a wonderful make-up, and took his
role well. Theodore Loose, as the pusil
lanomous King Gunther, was adequate.
The honors of acting undoubtedly went
to Siegfried and Brunhilde. Their in
terpretation of their roles was magnifi
cent.

Accompanied by the orchestra from
the Capitol Theatre in San Francisco,
with the score adapted by Hugo Rei-
HPiifeld from Wngner's "Finf* Ovcle."
the presentation waa greatly |BIf«
hanced. The Dramatic Council ae
eerves commendation for its efforts in
making possible the showing of such
a picture as "Siegfried" on the cam
pus, and as soon as they perfect the
art of eliminating the blanks between
reels, here's hoping that they bring
on another movie.—l. S.
