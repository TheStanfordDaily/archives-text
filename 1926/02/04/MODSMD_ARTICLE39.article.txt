# FROSH RAID SOPHOMORES
## 
### 
Members of the sophomore class at
Columbia University went to their
class banquet in moving vans, in order
to escape the freshman raiding parties.
One van became stuck and was at
tacked by freshmen. Twenty-five sec
ond-year men were captured, but they
were released in time to hear the
after-dinner speeches.

A financial clinic to assist students
and graduates in solving their per
sonal and business financial problems
has been established at the University
of Denver.
