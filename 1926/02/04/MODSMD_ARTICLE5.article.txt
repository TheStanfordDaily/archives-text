# LEVEL OF LAGUNITA RISES FAST DURING CONTINUED STORMS
## 
### 
Lagunita will be full within
two weeks, according to present
Indications. The level of the lake
has raised over twenty inches
during the last twenty-four hours,
and is now six feet at the deep
est point. The precipitation has
been so heavy in the hills that
there is now enough water to
fill all the surrounding lakes.

Since the beginning of the
storm last Thursday, 5.20 inches
have been recorded in the gauge
kept at the City Engineer's office
in Palo Alto. Despite the density
of the present storm, the season's
total is still short of normal,
reaching only 8.49 inches.

Warnings have been broadcast
that another storm, which will
equal the present one, is on its
way from the north Pacific and
should reach California within
forty-eight hours. If the new
storm comes up to the expecta
tions of weather observers, Cali
fornia's crops will have more
than enough water, and all dan
ger of a serious shortage during
the summer will be passed.
