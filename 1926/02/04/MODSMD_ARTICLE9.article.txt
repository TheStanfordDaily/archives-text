# REVAMPED TROJAN QUINTET TO MEET CARDINAL IN SOUTH
## Coach Turner Changes Lineup In Effort to Get More Powerful Squad 
### Jim Adams 
The revamped Trojan basketball
five may make things tough for the
Cards when the two teams meet to
night in the Olympic auditorium at
Los Angeles, although the Redshirts
are favored to win by virtue of their
one victory over U.S.C. and the
strength displayed against the Bears.

Stanford enters the third conference
game with a percentage of .500 while
U.S.C. holds cellar honors with .000
per cent, having dropped two games
to California and one to Stanford.

If' reports from the South are true,
however, the present Trojan five
bears no resemblance to the old team,
for with the addition of Dorsey and
MacAffle a wholly different appear
ance is made in their playing. Dorsey
is a strong defensive player and bol
sters the guarding department of
Coach Turner's quintet considerably.
MacAffle carries a flattering prep
school reputation and works in nicely
at center in his first varsity year. The
work of these two gives Boyer more
freedom for scoring activities.

Kerr will probably start Captain
Price and Clark at the forward berths,
Jayred at center, and Vincenti and
Anderson as guards. If David is in
shape he may start at his old position
in Clark's place.

Stanford's stock rose several points
by their unexpected opposition to
California last week, when only fate
robbed them of a victory. With the
Trojans now boasting a first-class bas
ketball team a large crowd is expected
to turn out to see the two rivals in
battle again.
