at morning, noon, or night, is
the most important item on your
bill of fare. Your health and
feelings certainly depend to a
large extent on the kind of food
you eat. The world looks bright
er and you are happier, and your
mind and body are better fitted
to carry on if you get the best of
food. If you scrimp on your foods
you will surely pay for it in
more ways than is always ap
parent at the time. We are
sellers of fine meats. We buy
from big wholesalers that are
well equipped to serve us, and
whose net profit is never more
than a half a cent per pound.
When you buy from us you are
sure of the best and you will feel
safe and satisfied. We invite
your patronage.
