# STANFORD DEFEATS TROJAN TEAM IN CLOSE CAGE GAME
## Price, Clark Star for Cards, Varsity Plays Grizzly Five Tonight 
### 
(Special Dispatch to Daily Palo Alto)
Keeping the lead throughout the en
tire game, although pressed hard by
a fighting Trojan team, the Cards
emerged victorious last night in the
first game of their southern tour at
Los Angeles, beating U.S.C. by a score
of 24 to 21. Twice Coach Les Turner's
men tied the score, but timely bas
kets by the Stanford cagers put them
out in front again.
At the end of the first half the Red
shirts were leading by a score of 13
to 7 and to the 4000 fans in the Olym
pic Auditorium it looked as if the
Trojans were hopelessly lost. A series
of baskets by Boyer, Thomas, and
Macllaffie at the opening of the sec
ond period tied the score. U.S.C. tied
the score again at 14 all after both
teams had registered a free throw, but
a couple of field goals by Bill Clark,
who was high-point man for the Cards
with eight markers, and a pair of
free throws by Shipkey, gave Stan
ford a small margin.
U.S.C. was lax in making free
throws into points and this fault re
duced their total score considerably.
Out of 14 attempts the Trojans scored
on 7 while the Cards made 8 out of a
possible 12.
Besides Clark, Captain Price played
a good brand of ball, following the
former closely in scoring honors with
six points. Price afforded the South
ern fans an acrobatic treat by sinking
a basket from a sitting posture on the
floor.
Captain Boyer was the outstanding
player of the U.S.C. team, gathering
a total of ten points for his team be
sides exhibiting some brilliant floor
work.
This win gives the Cards two vic
tories over the Trojan five with one
more game to be played Saturday
night. Tonight Stanford will play the
fast Grizzly outfit. If Kerr uses his
regulars the Branch team ought to
get a run for their money.
The summary of the game is as fol
lows :
Stanford (24)— U.S.C. (21) —
Price (C) (6) F Boyer (C) (10)
Clark (8) F Thomas (4)
Jayred (2) C MacHaffie (3)
Vinceni (4) G Dorsey (3)
Anderson G Laraneta (1)
Substitutes for Stanford: David,
Steele, Mitchell (2), Shipkey (2), New

Keeping the lead throughout the en
tire game, although pressed hard by
a fighting Trojan team, the Cards
emerged victorious last night in the
first game of their southern tour at
Los Angeles, beating U.S.C. by a score
of 24 to 21. Twice Coach Les Turner's
men tied the score, but timely bas
kets by the Stanford cagers put them
out in front again.
At the end of the first half the Red
shirts were leading by a score of 13
to 7 and to the 4000 fans in the Olym
pic Auditorium it looked as if the
Trojans were hopelessly lost. A series
of baskets by Boyer, Thomas, and
Macllaffie at the opening of the sec
ond period tied the score. U.S.C. tied
the score again at 14 all after both
teams had registered a free throw, but
a couple of field goals by Bill Clark,
who was high-point man for the Cards
with eight markers, and a pair of
free throws by Shipkey, gave Stan
ford a small margin.
U.S.C. was lax in making free
throws into points and this fault re
duced their total score considerably.
Out of 14 attempts the Trojans scored
on 7 while the Cards made 8 out of a
possible 12.
Besides Clark, Captain Price played
a good brand of ball, following the
former closely in scoring honors with
six points. Price afforded the South
ern fans an acrobatic treat by sinking
a basket from a sitting posture on the
floor.
Captain Boyer was the outstanding
player of the U.S.C. team, gathering
a total of ten points for his team be
sides exhibiting some brilliant floor
work.
This win gives the Cards two vic
tories over the Trojan five with one
more game to be played Saturday
night. Tonight Stanford will play the
fast Grizzly outfit. If Kerr uses his
regulars the Branch team ought to
get a run for their money.
