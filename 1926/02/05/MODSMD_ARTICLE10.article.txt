# Hunt Will Start Changed Lineup Against Salinas
## 
### Cliff McDowell 
With the varsity basketball team in
the South this week, the Saturday
night game in the pavilion at 8 o'clock
will be between the freshman quintet
and the Salinas High School team.
Hunt has been remodeling his team
since the California game and will
present a slightly different lineup
when his squad takes the court to
morrow night. Robb, who starred at
standing guard in the game Wednes
day night against San Mateo High
School, will start at that position, and
Renzel, who surprised the crowd by
taking high-point honors in the same
contest, is slated to start at one of the
forward positions.
In practice yes.terday the frosh
looked decidedly better than they
have for some time. The new com
bination seems to work more smoothly
and pass better than any five Hunt
has used this season.
Davis, another second-team man
that has suddenly jumped into promi
nence, may start at the other forward
position in place of Sibbett, but both
these men are due to get in the game.
The raggedness that appeared at
times in the game Wednesday night,
probably due to the new lineup, was j
absent in practice yesterday. Hunt is |
rebuilding his team completely in j
preparation for the next game with !
the California freshmen, two weeks
distant.
The tentative lineup as given out
by Hunt yesterday: Renzel and Davis
or Sibbett, forwards; Worden and
Robb, guards; McCandless, center.
