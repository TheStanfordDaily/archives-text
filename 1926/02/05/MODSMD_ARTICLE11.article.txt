# WET WEATHER STOPS VARSITY BASEBALL PRACTICE FOR WEEK
## 
### Herb Klein 
Baseball practice has been halted
on account of rain and the team may
be unable to play the two practice
games scheduled for Saturday and
next Wednesday. The diamond can
dry to a playable condition in one
day of sunshine if given an oppor
tunity. The game scheduled by Coach
Harry Wolter for next Wednesday is
with the San Francisco Police team.
The only workout this week was
held for the pitching staff on Tues
day. Oviatt, Collins, Phillipi, Reynolds,
and Sobieski practiced twirling in
spite of the weather.
The team will have several good
sluggers, and the batting average is
sure to be a good many points higher
than last year. The 192S team is sup
plying Wolter with some of his most
valuable material. Sypher is one of
(he most capable catchers that have
been at Stanford in some time, and
has that position cinched. Garibaldi
at second and Busch at shortstop are
two further contributions the former
freshman team is likely to make, be
sides Phillipi, Sobieski, and Reynolds,
pitchers.
Oviatt and Collins are veterans and
lettermen from last year's team at
the mound position and will be strong
ly in the running.
Maguire and Johnston are running
the first base position. At present Ma
guire appears to have the edge, but
Johnston will probably be shifted to
a fielder's berth because of his hitting
ability.
Garibaldi at second and Captain
Cuddeback at third seems the prob
able combination. Hyland is also out
for second. There is no lack of good
material for the outfield positions.
