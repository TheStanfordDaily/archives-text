# CRITICISMS DESIRED BY COMMITTEE ON NEW POINT SYSTEM
## Revisions Will Be Guided by Pressure Brought Upon Plan by Women 
### 
All criticisms of the proposed Point
System regulating women's activities
must be in the hands of the Commit
tee by February tenth, according to
Barbara Perkins, chairman.
Discussion of all kinds followed the
release of the plans for the Point Sys
tem yesterday when the rules were
announced to the campus. All group
ings of offices and restrictions of ac
tivities are open to revision before
the Quad election which will take
place during the last week of Febru
ary.
The women are urged to study care
fully each phase of the plan, as its
installation will vitally affect the hold
ing of offices and participation in com
mittee work of every woman. A thor
ough investigation of the five group
ings of offices and their restrictions is
necessary before an intelligent vote
can be taken.
Suggestions Desired
Suggestions and criticisms concern
ing the distribution of offices in the
different groups and the restrictions
placed upon individuals as members
of the five groups are to be mailed to
Barbara Perkins or left in the sugges
tion box in the Dean of Women's of
fice.
The system will be revised by the
Committee according to the pressure
brought upon it by the women before
it is submitted to a campus election.
If the Point System is adopted, its
j regulations will not go into effect un-
I til fall quarter although the restric-
I tions will hold in spring quarter elec
! tions for offices to be held in fall
I quarter.
Mildred Worswick, president of the
Associated Women Students, while
she was in the East recently, found
that all the Eastern colleges she vis
ited had some method of regulating
women's activities in the form of a
point system.
Study Made
The Point System Committee com
posed of Barbara Perkins, chairman,
Martha Burnett, Anne Harris, Eleanor
Davidson, and Helen Erskine, has
made a detailed study of the duties
and amount of time necessary to per
form every campus office efficiently.
The Committee has devised a system
to prevent a small group of women
from being overburdened with activi
ties, by distributing the offices and
committee work more evenly among
the women.
The purposes of the Point System
are three in number:
1. To spread among the many stu
dents those privileges, pleasures, and
honors which have previously been
monopolized by a few.
2. To benefit the organizations or
activities by assuring each position or
office an officer whose interests are
concentrated rather than so scattered
i that her efforts become inefficient.
3. To protect prominent individuals
; from being burdened with more out
side work than is safe for their studies
or their health.
In Thursday's Daily one mistake in
the rating of Group 11, Restriction b,

I quarter.
Mildred Worswick, president of the
Associated Women Students, while
she was in the East recently, found
that all the Eastern colleges she vis
ited had some method of regulating
women's activities in the form of a
point system.
Study Made
The Point System Committee com
posed of Barbara Perkins, chairman,
Martha Burnett, Anne Harris, Eleanor
Davidson, and Helen Erskine, has
made a detailed study of the duties
and amount of time necessary to per
form every campus office efficiently.
The Committee has devised a system
to prevent a small group of women
from being overburdened with activi
ties, by distributing the offices and
committee work more evenly among
the women.
The purposes of the Point System
are three in number:
1. To spread among the many stu
dents those privileges, pleasures, and
honors which have previously been
monopolized by a few.
2. To benefit the organizations or
activities by assuring each position or
office an officer whose interests are
concentrated rather than so scattered
i that her efforts become inefficient.
3. To protect prominent individuals
; from being burdened with more out
side work than is safe for their studies
or their health.
In Thursday's Daily one mistake in
the rating of Group 11, Restriction b,
was made. It should read: b. One ac
tivity in Group 111 plus one in Group
IV.
All criticisms of the proposed Point
System regulating women's activities
must be in the hands of the Commit
tee by February tenth, according to
Barbara Perkins, chairman.
Discussion of all kinds followed the
release of the plans for the Point Sys
tem yesterday when the rules were
announced to the campus. All group
ings of offices and restrictions of ac
tivities are open to revision before
the Quad election which will take
place during the last week of Febru
ary.
The women are urged to study care
fully each phase of the plan, as its
installation will vitally affect the hold
ing of offices and participation in com
mittee work of every woman. A thor
ough investigation of the five group
ings of offices and their restrictions is
necessary before an intelligent vote
can be taken.
Suggestions Desired
Suggestions and criticisms concern
ing the distribution of offices in the
different groups and the restrictions
placed upon individuals as members
of the five groups are to be mailed to
Barbara Perkins or left in the sugges
tion box in the Dean of Women's of
fice.
The system will be revised by the
Committee according to the pressure
brought upon it by the women before
it is submitted to a campus election.
If the Point System is adopted, its
j regulations will not go into effect un-
I til fall quarter although the restric-
I tions will hold in spring quarter elec
! tions for offices to be held in fall
I quarter.
