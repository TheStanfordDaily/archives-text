# BEAR LIGHTWEIGHTS DRILL FOR SECOND STANFORD CONTEST
## 
### 
University of California, Feb. 4. â€”-
I After defeating their rivals, the Stan
| ford Cardinals, in the first series, the
California 130- and 145-pound quintets
| February 19 and 20. The lightweight
will meet in their second contests on
| teams will play the preliminary to the
I California-Stanford freshman game at
' the Oakland Auditorium.
An air-tight defense in which Coach
Wayne McCorkle has drilled his 145-
pound team was the factor that en
abled the Bruins to annex their first
game. The Cardinals were able to
| score but one field basket in the en-
I tire contest due to the fine defensive
work of Captain Werner, forward;
Leith, center; and Davenport, guard.
These three men were the nucleus of
the California five-man defense.
California is also represented by a
I fast lightweight team which has been
moulded together by Coach Bishop.
During the next two weeks Coach
Bishop will give his charges plenty of
I shooting practice in order to put them
in better shape for the next Stanford
I contest.
