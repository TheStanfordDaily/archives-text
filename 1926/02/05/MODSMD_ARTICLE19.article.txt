# Suggestions Needed

### 
The Women's Point System committee appointed last quarter to draft
some means of regulating women's activities has released a plan which has
been accepted by Women's Council. The fact that this body has accepted
the proposed scheme does not mean that the plan is perfect. The proposed
plan is far from perfect even though careful investigations have been
made by the members of the committee.
The plans for the system will be open for criticisms and suggestions by
the women until February 10. Suggestions are to be mailed to the chair
man of the committee, or put in the Associated Women Students sugges
tion-box in the office of the Dean of Women. When each individual has
had, and we hope taken, the opportunity of making suggestions for im
provement in the system the committee will re-draft the plan according to
the criticisms received.
This is not the time to vote on whether Stanford should have a women's
point system or not. That will be done at a special Quad election, but now
is the time to consider whether the plan proposed is the best plan that can
be devised. The only way the committee can remedy any weaknesses in
the scheme is to have the benefit of suggestions from each Stanford woman
who has any ideas or corrections to offer.
The committee has stated the purpose of the point system as being one
devised to prevent a small group of women from being overburdened with
activities, by distributing the offices and committee work more evenly
among the women. The aims are as follows:
1. To spread among the many students those privileges, pleasures and
honors which have previously been monopolized by a few.
2. To benefit the organizations or activities by assuring each position
an officer whose interests are concentrated rather than so scattered that her
efforts become inefficient.
3. To protect prominent individuals from being burdened with more
outside work than is safe for their studies or their health.
The committee has formulated these aims and this system in an effort
to help Stanford women, but aims and the work of the committee alone
cannot make a perfect system. It is up to the individual to study the pro
posed plan, and to make suggestions.
