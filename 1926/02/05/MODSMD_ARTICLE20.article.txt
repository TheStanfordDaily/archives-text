# Stanford Fight
## 
### 
Dispatches from Los Angeles this morning were loud in their praise
of a fighting Stanford team, a basketball five that snatched victory out of
Trojan hands by superior spirit as well as superior ability.
A week ago a team from Berkeley was battled to a standstill for thirty
minutes by a Stanford quintet determined ot win by fight what the sport
critics Ixdieved they could not win by inherent skill.
Sport has distinguished itself as a favorite American occupation by
such examples of do-or-die spirit as have been shown by the Cardinal five
the past two weeks. In fact, it might be said that it is more to a team's
credit to play the game for all that is in it than to sluff through a poor game
and win by a few points. Win or lose, a team that does give the fans a
thrill by such exhibitions of spirit will be long remembered.

Revival of love as practiced in the days of the horse and buggy, as
noted in the Minnesota Daily:
"Grandmother was a mean flingcr of good times, say the Methodist students who
are sponsoring an Old Tyme Party featuring a sleigh ride and a basket social Friday
night, at the Wesley foundation, 1209 Fourth street southeast."
