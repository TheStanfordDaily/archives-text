# Washington Club Declares Drinking Not Prevalent
## 
### 
University of Washington â€” Hip
flasks and drinking are not prevalent
among college students was the deci
-1 sion reached by members of the Ink
well Club in their recent discussion of
the question, "Is Prohibition Succeed
ing?"
"In my two years as student pastor
at the University of Washington I
have never seen one of the students
drunk," Rev. O. A. Bremer asserted.
"Although I have been in intimate
contact with large numbers of stu
dents, perhaps I have merely been
lucky in not seeing any of them in
toxicated. But I doubt that there is
much drinking at Washington, and I
am convinced that prohibition is suc
ceeding."

Students at U.S.C. must pass a spell-
J ing test before they can graduate.
