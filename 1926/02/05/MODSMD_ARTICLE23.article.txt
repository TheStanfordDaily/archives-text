# SPORTS OF 1926
## Did You Know That— 
### "FEG" MURRAY, '16 
Roger Conti, the sensational French billiardist, made
two unfinished runs of 472 and 477 in a tournament in
Paris in December 1924? Conti also had a grand average
of 69.44 in 2500 points, which is something else to cheer
about.
The late Eugen Sandow, whose name is synonymous
with strength, could not crush an egg between the palms
of his hands? You can crush an egg if you grip it in
certain ways, but neither you nor anyone else can crush
it by pressing against its ends with your palms. Eggs
have weak sides, but their ends are strong enough to
resist all the crushing power of a Sandow or a Hacken
schmidt.
The Berkeley Braves and the Brambleton team of the
Norfolk City Football League played seventeen consecutive

scoreless quarters? The teams met on Thanksgiving Day
jr. 1920 for the league championship for which they were tied. They played
four ouarters to a scoreless tie. A month later they celebrated Christmas
by playing five scoreless quarters. Then they battled again on New Year's
Day—six quarters this time, starting early in the morning, with the usual
score. So it was decided to let it go until next football season, as they had
run out of holidays.
"When the two teams met again in 1921, the Berkeley Braves won G to 0,
but the only score came in the third quarter. That made seventeen quarters
in succession with no touchdowns, field goals, or safeties —nothing but goose
eggs!
FEG MURRAY SAYS—
Now that Bill Tilden has gone in for the drama, how about star
ring other sport leaders in some of the successful Broadway shows?
For instance —
"The Vagabond King," with Jack Dempsey; "The Student Prince,"
with Red Grange; "Abie's Irish Rose," featuring Bennie Leonard and
Mickey Walker; "Easy Come, Easy Go," with Edouard Horemans;
"Head First," with Frank Frisch; "The Poor Nut," Nick Aitrock.
