FAMOUS REMARKS WHICH ARE
HISTORICALLY INCORRECT
1. "It's awfully hard to believe all
1 the things you read in that column
called 'Cabbages,' isn't it?"
2. "Let's run down to the Union and
; get one of those rich, creamy milk-!
j shakes."
?,. "I've got the keenest blind date
; at Roble tonight."
4. "The laws of heredity are terribly
simple things after all, aren't they?" !
5. "What nice looking fraternity I
houses you have here at Stanford. I'm
sure the boys all have nice large:
| rooms, haven't they?"
6. "Yes, ma'am. We get university |
credit for the hours we take at the
Convalescent Home."

Cabbages is of the firm belief that ;

on the Row due to the fact that the
present trees leaked badly in the re

student who committed suicide during I
the week of finals:
"College is but a jest, and all profs

Rare and marvelous repast discov- j
ered in the columns of a small North
ern California paper:
"Last Wednesday evening the Groes- j
beck family entertained the members i
of the Arbuckle Club at dinner and
dancing. The unique menu which was
served the guests was much more ap- j
petizing than the name would indi-1
cate, consisting of dead cow roasted, j
fried groundhog, pounded spud, com
monsap, stack of wheat, cow grease, i
hot love apples with stems mixed in, j
bleached boquet, chopped cow fodder,
Bohemian sip with golden gooy, et :
sand dulce, Adam's ale, kackle berry
pie, and moulded curd."

with a substance of doubtful origin.
(How can I express my feelings at
the sight of a sophomore disappearing
under the water while on the bank
there remained a pair of trousers?)
But it turned out that the trousers
belonged to someone else who did not
appear to claim them.
But it pains me to go further in my
description of this brutal struggle. I
left the freshman pit and, hoping to
see something more worth while, went
over to the sophomore pit. But I was
not to remain long.
My attention was attracted at once
bv a group of sophomores struggling
with a freshman who was putting up
a valiant fight. First they had him by
the arms but he fought like a demon
and broke away from them. Then they
caught him by the feet and dragged
him to the pit, but again he kicked
loose. At last, by the combined efforts
of twelve sophomores, he was thrown
into the pit.
As he climbed out I saw his face, all
covered with black oil. I drew back
in a paroxysm of horror. It was John
Smith. I turned and fled in horror
from the dreadful scene.
Oh! the brutality of those sopho
mores.

words, complete extermination of pro
