# COLUMBIA SENIORS QUIZZED TO FIND COLLEGIATE VIEWS
## Answers to Questionnaire "Solve" Many Perplexing Problems of Life 
### Monroe Eaton 
Such questions as: "Has your col
lege education been worth while?
What is your favorite evening news
paper? Do you have bachelor tenden
cies? Have you ever been kissed? Has
prohibition been a good thing for the
country? Would you marry for money?
Do you swear? What is your favorite
drink? Have you ever called 'at your â€¢
earliest convenience'? and what do j
you consider the most healthful ac- j
tivity?" are asked of all seniors at
Columbia University before they
graduate.
In the annual questionnaire, the pur
pose of which is to obtain statistics
from the senior class for use in the
Columbia year book, seniors at that
university are given an opportunity
to express their opinion on everything
from newspapers and drink to occupa
tions and the conferring of the dis
tinction of being the most typical
Columbia man.
Seniors Given a Week
The questions are passed out to
the seniors in the form of a written
questionnaire which they must an
swer in the space of a week's time.
The voting is under the management
of the editor of the Columbian, and
is conducted in much the same way
as an ordinary student election. There
is always a great demand by New
York newspapers for the first results
of the questionnaire.
Probably the most truthful aver
ages are those giving the height,
weight, and age of the members of
the senior class. Last year the seniors
at Columbia averaged five feet ten in
height, weight one hundred and fifty
pounds, and twenty-one years of age.
Honors Conferred
About six great honors are con
ferred by the class through the ques
tionnaire. Besides the most typical
Columbia man, there are elected the
man who has done most for Columbia,
the man who has done the most for
his class, the best athlete, the best j
speaker, the best writer, the best all- j
round man, and the most popular man. |
The results of last year's question- j
naire showed that fifty men never!
read New York newspapers, that over'
half the class did not attend daily;
chapel, and that the class of 1925 pre->
ferred liquor to water as a drink. It
also revealed that only two-thirds of
the members of the class smoked and
that the majority would marry for
money. The expected salary of the I
class members, five years after gradu-1
ation, was set at $6000.
Who's the "Purest"
Questions relating to women deal j
with the best-liked girls' collbge, the !
most-frequented girls', dormitory, the
favorite campus actress, the bestj
dancer, and the "purest." The wittiest
and the most brilliant man are also
chosen.
"The senior questionnaire," says the
Columbia Spectator, "is an annual cus-,
torn that allows the Columbian an op-;
portunity to compile an official set I
of figures showing what the members
of the graduating class eat, drink, and
swear, and what their opinion is on
several pertinent and impertinent
problems of college and of life."
