# GOLF TEAMS WILL COMPETE IN COAST MEET AT DEL MONTE
## 
### 
Members of the Stanford varsity
and freshman golf teams will com-1
pete in the Pacific Coast Intercolle
giate Golf Championship to be held
at Del Monte February 21-23, and
should finish well up toward the top. j
This year's tourney is expected to I
attract a more representative field of
college golfers than have ever played I
in a similar event before. Washington,
California, St. Mary's, Santa Clara, I
U.S.C., and the Southern Branch are
sending their best men down to com-;
pete with the Cardinals, and there is
a possibility that several other coast
colleges will be represented. Dick
Lang, captain of the team, is presi-!
dent of the Pacific Coast Intercolle
giate Golf Association, and is direct- 1
ing the tourney.
Eddie Meyberg, semi-finalist in last
year's championship play, and Lang, !
who is better now than he has ever |
been before, should be one of Stan- j
ford's strongest threats. Lang defeated
Johnny Tait, California ace, in the
annual match with the Bruins a few ,
weeks ago, and Meyberg won his game i
in easy fashion. Other men who will j
make the trip are Fritz Ditzler, Jim
Wilson; Ashton Stanley, and Horace j
Hindry of the varsity squad, and j
Bobby Syer, Herb Fleishhacker, Neal j
Miller, and Bob Vermilya of the frosh. !
Most of these players know the Del i
Monte and Pebble Beach courses well, |
and should be able to hold their own !
with the best of them.
Lauren Upson, wonder man on the ;
California team for the past three j
years and present coast titleholder,
will not be able to defend his crown |
this year as he is attending Tulane |
University, and the Blue and Gold has i
no other player who can put in a i
serious bid for first honors. Jack West-1
lake of the University of Washington,
runner-up for the national collegiate
title last season, and Harold Thomp
son, the Southern Branch star who
made such an excellent showing in'
the California amateur championships
in 1925, appear to be the most likely
contenders.
