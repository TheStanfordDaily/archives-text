# FENCE GAME STOPS SLUMBER OF ENTIRE GAMMA PHI HOUSE
## 
### 
Blood-curdling shouts of human
voices, combined with the noisy
clash of bamboo sticks in the
early hours of the morning have
been the cause of much alarm
among the members of the
Gamma Phi Beta sorority lately.
The cause of the disturbance was
found to he two ardent devotees
of the art of Japanese fencing
practicing every morning in the
Japanese Club yard, across from
the sorority house.
Toyoda, once middle school
champion fencer in Japan, and
Yasuda, another adept in the art,
have been holding their work
outs between the hours of G and
7 o'clock in the morning. In an
interview, Toyoda explained that
in Japanese fencing the fencers
always called in a loud voice the
spot on their opponent's body
which they intended to strike,
and that this accounted for noisy
vocal demonstration. The foils
are made of four pieces of split
bamboo and are about four feet
long.
