# Charleston Good Exercise Asserts Minnesota Doctor
## 
### 
: "Students suffer far more from too
little exercise than too much," de
clares Dr. J. Anne Norris, director of
i physical education for women at the |
| University of Minnesota. "There is
little danger in anyone's overdoing the j
I Charleston. As soon as he gets warm I

and breathless, he stops —at least,
long enough to rest.
"As far as I have observed, the
dance requires concentrated attention
and localized control of the muscles;
both are desirable. The novice seems
to get more exercise out of the
Charleston than one who has mastered
it."
Reminded that knee-caps have been

dislocated by Charleston fans, Dr. Nor
ris replied that kneecaps had also
been dislocated by skating or by
merely walking down the street, prov
ing that the fault lies in the knee, not
the dance.

The Charleston has been banned by
the students at Indiana for fear of
damaging the buildings.
