# CHURCH GROUP WILL DISCUSS D.P.A. "CURE"
## 
### 
"The Daily Palo Alto; Its Causes,
Consequences, and Cure," will be dis
cussed by the Canterbury Club of the
First Presbyterian Church of Palo
Alto at 6:30 o'clock Sunday evening
at the church. This organization, com
posed chiefly of Stanford students,
was recently reorganized under the
presidency of Neal Sooy. Margaret
Owen will lead the discussion. Inter
ested students are invited to attend.
Criticism of the Daily which has
been advanced recently by certain
students was responsible for selection
of the topic. An effort will be made
to secure a fair presentation of both
sides of the question. In addition to
the discussion, the club's program will
include piano solos by Ileidar Torjus
sen and vocal selections by a male
quartet.
