Twenty-five freshmen have turned

sophomore football manager positions.
The candidates will be kept at work
during the winter and spring football
training periods, and in the fall those
who are successful will fill, with
others, the thirty sophomore manager
places. Calvin Flint, junior manager,
is in charge of recruiting the try
outees.
Freshmen at Penn State are forbid

pockets.
Brigham Young students voted to
