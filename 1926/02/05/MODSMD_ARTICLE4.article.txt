# FRESHMAN TRACK MEN SHOW WELL IN CLASS MEETS
## Babes Strongest in Sprints, Weights; Hulsman Best In Pole Vault 
### Fred Swan 
Although the present storm is keep-
I ing the track athletes indoors, the
league is still hard at work doping
lout prospects for the coming season.
The material that is available for the
varsity is rather well known. As usual
the frosh prospects will be in the
1 dark until they have their meets later
in the season.
In the Friday meets of the track
classes some of the frosh have shown
| good early-season form. Zambro in
the sprints looks to be a cinch to
' finish among the winners in the meets
i this season. He also is a broad-jumper
j of no small ability. Stillson and Steb
| bins round out a strong trio in the
! sprints.
Mile Event Strong
Pascoe and Self will carry the bur
! dent of the mile. This event looks
I fairly strong at the present time,
i Other men may show up in the coming
! meets to strengthen these milers.
i Stanford will be well fortified with
| frosh 440-yard men. In a recent Fri
s day meet d'Allessio and Dales both
j won their heats in fast time, Dales
being the faster of the two. Gibbs and
| Smith are worthy supporters in this
event.
j So far the only half-milers to appear
j for the frosh are McKinnon and Clum.
j They finished one and two in a recent
! class meet. Some more men will have
to be developed to keep this race on
a par with the other distances as far
as material is concerned. Carley is
| the only frosh to have any success
with the two-mile and he is not run
ning too strong at the present time.
Payton seems to be a fairly good
I prospect in the furlong and, although
1 his work in the early season is noth
ing unusual, he may come strong
later. Some hurdlers will have to be
; dug up somewhere. To date the frosh
1 have only one man that has shown
any ability at all, and that has been
in the low hurdles.
Goodcell Placed
Goodcell seems to be the javelin
j thrower of the frosh so far, and has
placed in several of the meets. There
I are plenty of good weight men on the
babe squad. In the shot put, Fleish
hacker, Forster, and Way are three
strong men who will place with any
kind of competition. Fleischhacker
has been taking things easy and may
be hard pressed by Forster to uphold
his laurels. In a recent practice For
ster tossed the pellet forty-three feet
and is showing the get-ahead spirit
j right along.
As a freshman pole-vaulter Hulsman
! can make many of the varsity men
1 step to reach the heights with him.
1 Hulsman has a peculiar style of taking
off in the pole vault. Most vaulters
step off with their left foot; Hulsman,
however, shows a complete reversal
; of form and takes off with his right.
| This was considered off form until
; Brownell, of the University of Illinois,
j who is intercollegiate pole vault cham-
I pion, developed it as a separate and
J definite form.

' finish among the winners in the meets
i this season. He also is a broad-jumper
j of no small ability. Stillson and Steb
| bins round out a strong trio in the
! sprints.
Mile Event Strong
Pascoe and Self will carry the bur
! dent of the mile. This event looks
I fairly strong at the present time,
i Other men may show up in the coming
! meets to strengthen these milers.
i Stanford will be well fortified with
| frosh 440-yard men. In a recent Fri
s day meet d'Allessio and Dales both
j won their heats in fast time, Dales
being the faster of the two. Gibbs and
| Smith are worthy supporters in this
event.
j So far the only half-milers to appear
j for the frosh are McKinnon and Clum.
j They finished one and two in a recent
! class meet. Some more men will have
to be developed to keep this race on
a par with the other distances as far
as material is concerned. Carley is
| the only frosh to have any success
with the two-mile and he is not run
ning too strong at the present time.
Payton seems to be a fairly good
I prospect in the furlong and, although
1 his work in the early season is noth
ing unusual, he may come strong
later. Some hurdlers will have to be
; dug up somewhere. To date the frosh
1 have only one man that has shown
any ability at all, and that has been
in the low hurdles.
Goodcell Placed
Goodcell seems to be the javelin
j thrower of the frosh so far, and has
placed in several of the meets. There
I are plenty of good weight men on the
babe squad. In the shot put, Fleish
hacker, Forster, and Way are three
strong men who will place with any
kind of competition. Fleischhacker
has been taking things easy and may
be hard pressed by Forster to uphold
his laurels. In a recent practice For
ster tossed the pellet forty-three feet
and is showing the get-ahead spirit
j right along.
As a freshman pole-vaulter Hulsman
! can make many of the varsity men
1 step to reach the heights with him.
1 Hulsman has a peculiar style of taking
off in the pole vault. Most vaulters
step off with their left foot; Hulsman,
however, shows a complete reversal
; of form and takes off with his right.
| This was considered off form until
; Brownell, of the University of Illinois,
j who is intercollegiate pole vault cham-
I pion, developed it as a separate and
J definite form.
Although the present storm is keep-
I ing the track athletes indoors, the
league is still hard at work doping
lout prospects for the coming season.
The material that is available for the
varsity is rather well known. As usual
the frosh prospects will be in the
1 dark until they have their meets later
in the season.
In the Friday meets of the track
classes some of the frosh have shown
| good early-season form. Zambro in
the sprints looks to be a cinch to
' finish among the winners in the meets
i this season. He also is a broad-jumper
j of no small ability. Stillson and Steb
| bins round out a strong trio in the
