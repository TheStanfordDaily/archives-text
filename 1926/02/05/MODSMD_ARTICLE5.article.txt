# S.A.E. SQUAD SHOTS OUT DEKES BY 32-0 SCORE
## El Tigre Wins Easily From Encina 3W; Chi Psi Beats Branner I 
### Gordon French 
The Sigma Alpha Epsilon quintet
continued its unchecked march for its
second intramural championship in
succession by completely smothering
the Delta Kappa Epsilon five yester
day by the overwhelming score of
32 to 0. El Tigre easily won its fourth
victory over Encina 3W, and will at
tempt to stop the fast-traveling S.A.E.
team next week. Chi Psi nosed out the
Branner I team in the closest tilt of
the day by two points, 14-12. Theta
Xi ran circles around the Los Arcos
squad to win 23 to 2, and El Campo
won by default from El Cuadro in
the other games played.
The S.A.E. game was just a ques
tion of how low a score the Dekes
would hold their opponents to, as
what few shots the Dekes did get
went wild. The S.A.E. quintet scored
goals with such monotonous regularity
that long before the first half ended
it had a lead of 15-0, but for the rest
of the half it slacked up and only
scored one field goal more. Returning
to their original fast play in the
second half, the S.A.E.'s piled up fif
teen points more before the the end
of the game.
McDermott Leads Scoring
The S.A.E.'s scoring was almost
monopolized by McDermott, forward,
and Gibbons, center, with fifteen and
eleven points respectively. Bigelow,
the other S.A.E. forward, was far be
low his usual form last night and
could score only one field goal.
The Branner I-Chi Psi game was nip
and tuck all the way with the result
uncertain until the final basket. Peter
son, Branner center, tossed a short
shot in to open the scoring, but soon
after Walker, Chi Psi, sank a shot
from mid-floor to tie the score. Within
a minute Frank put Branner back in
the lead only to have King tie the
score. Menzies, lanky Chi Psi center,
put his team securely in the lead with
three baskets before the half ended,
as the best Branner could do was a
foul goal by Frank and a field goal
by King.
Menzies High Man
With the score 10-7 against it, Bran
ner tried to rally, but the best it could
do was to gain one point, outscoring
its opponents 5-4. Menzies was high
point man with eight points. Frank
was the best scorer for Branner with
five points.
El Tigre had little trouble outscor
ing the Encina 3W team, 24 to 4. At
half time the El Tigre players had
managed to hold Encina scoreless and
