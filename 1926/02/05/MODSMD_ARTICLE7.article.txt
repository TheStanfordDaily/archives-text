# FOREIGNERS HAPPY IN AMERICA SAYS DR. JORDAN
## European Political Methods Main Subject of Talk By Chancellor 
### 
Foreigners find in America just
about what they are looking for, de
clared Dr. Jordan last night in his
discussion of "Paris in America." If
jan English saloonkeeper comes to
I this country, he satisfies himself that
our prohibition law is a farce; if a
reformer comes, he finds a much im
proved condition.
Dr. Jordan based most of his re
marks on his experience with Euro
pean political methods, and particu
larly as they evolved into war condi
tions. "In practically all cases," he
j said, "war was brought on by mili-
I tarists and politicians for the purpose
I of retaining power." War, in any case,
i is the most powerful thing known for
, uniting people of a country. "It is a
| matter," remarked Dr. Jordan, "of a
! people hanging together or hanging
| separatively."
The narrow policies held by Euro
i pean governments in regard to free
dom of speech and religion led to the
] emigration of some of the most ener-
I getic of their peop'e to the United
| States. Characterizing democracy as
j the soundest form of government, Dr.
I Jordan said that it was strong enough
i in itself without bothering about sup-
I pressing such petty things as "Red"
| speakers, and imprisoning such men
!as Debs.
"The only way to get peace is to
j get rid of armies, and be decent to
other people. The bulk of the people
of any country are all right,remarked
| Dr. Jordan at one point, "but the bulk
: of politicians should bear close watch
| ingâ€”a thing which they do not usually
get."
