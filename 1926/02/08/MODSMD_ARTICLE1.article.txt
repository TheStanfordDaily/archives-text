# TWO LOS ANGELES BASKETBALL TEAMS FALL BEFORE STANFORD
## U.S.C. Out of Conference Running After Losing Twice to Cards 
### Jim Adams 
Ned Anderson, first string guard
on the Stanford varsity, was kept
out of the final U.S.C. game be
cause of a sprained ankle that he
received in the first contest of the
Southern series. Anderson will
likely be rested up this week so
he will be in perfect condition for
the second California game on
February 21.
Bearing the laurels by three vic
tories the Stanford basketball team
plus Coach Andy Kerr and Manager
Bill Tucker returned to the campus
this morning from Los Angeles where
they exhibited a classy brand of bas
ketball before the Southern fans in
a three-game series. The Cards beat
the Trojans 30 to 22 Saturday night,
to wind up the series, in a close affair
which was decided in favor of the
Redshirts only after an extra five-min
ute period, complete with thrills, was
played.
U.S.C. went down before Coach
Kerr's men Thursday night 24 to 21,
while the Southern Branch were the
surprised victims the following eve
ning with a score of 32 to 29. The
last win over the Trojans gives Stan
ford a string of three straight vic
tories over their Southern rivals and
puts them definitely out of the run
ning for conference honors.
Hard-Fought Games
Coach Les Turner's team showed
every bit of their newly developed
•strength and gave the Cards a pair
of close, hard-fought tilts. The sur
prise of the series, both to the Cardi
nal and Branch supporters, came in
the second game, Friday night, when
the highly lauded Grizzly five, rated
as one of the best teams on the
Pacific Coast, bowed before the fight
ing Stanford squad even after Kerr
had kept his regulars out of the affray
until early in the second period.
It was a hard program laid out for
the Redshirts, to play three hard
games on successive nights but they
came through in great style, thanks
to the strategy of Coach Kerr and the
fighting spirit of the men.
In the last Trojan tilt Stanford was
leading 19 to 18 with about ten sec
onds to go when Boyer was fouled and
awarded a free throw. While the spec
tators hung on to the edge of their
seats in silent anxiety the Trojan
captain took careful aim and sank the
ball to tie the score and necessitate
an extra period.
Boyer Sinks One
Boyer soon after nearly brought
down the rafters over his head when
he looped a long one for a couple of
points and as a result put the fans
in hysterics. A different cry went up
soon after, for this basket was fol
lowed by a series on the Stanford
side contributed to by Jayred, Price,
David, and Mitchell, which placed the
Cards out in the lead 30 to 22.
